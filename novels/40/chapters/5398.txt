Feng Ying shook her head, “No, there is no Old Sir over there.”

Yang Kai did not know what to say.

Why could he see the old man, when the others could not?

The Old Ancestors all converged in that direction. So obviously the Old Ancestors had seen him as well.

Xiang Shan and the others now realized that Yang Kai did not look like he was joking. They also did not understand why the Old Ancestors had suddenly left.

“There really is an old man over there?” Xiang Shan asked with a deep voice.

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded confidently.

Mi Jing Lun and the others frowned.

“Could it be the one with the white jade hand?” Xiang Shan remarked as he thought of what Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao had said the other day. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I don’t know if it’s the man with the white jade hand, but he seems Human,” Yang Kai replied casually.

Mi Jing Lun said solemnly, “If there is someone there, yet we can’t detect him, then his strength is simply unfathomable.”

Mi Jing Lun glanced at Xiang Shan before suddenly smiling as they both patted Yang Kai’s shoulder, “You want to know what he is telling the Old Ancestors?”

Earlier on, Mi Jing Lun did not know why Yang Kai looked so frustrated and curious, but now he understood.

How could Yang Kai be the only one who was curious? Although the Old Ancestors would certainly reveal some key information to them later, they might not necessarily tell them everything.

It was certainly better if they could hear it for themselves.

However, none of them dared to do anything rash. Since the Old Ancestors did not call for them, who would dare to go forward on their own? None of them was able to shoulder the responsibility if something went wrong.

Yang Kai had learnt long ago not to get involved in Big Head Mi’s schemes and shook his head decisively, “No!”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao once commented that Mi Jing Lun was quite petty and vindictive; thus, Yang Kai knew he should not try to best him in an argument. In fact, if Yang Kai had the necessary strength, he would have resorted to fists first and asked questions later; after all, the best way to deal with anyone petty was to beat them into submission.

Likewise, this same reasoning applied to Xiang Shan.

Unfortunately for him, the two Big Heads were too similar in their thinking.

Yang Kai was alerted as soon as Mi Jing Lun spoke, but it was too late.

“No, you certainly want to!” Mi Jing Lun said firmly, taking out a tea set and shoving it directly into Yang Kai’s hand before ‘casually’ suggesting, “That Old Senior must have grown lonely after so many years and long forgotten the taste of tea. Go and brew the Old Senior a pot of tea!”

Upon saying so, both Mi Jing Lun and Xiang Shan directly used their hands, which were still on Yang Kai’s shoulders, to throw him out.

Yang Kai was shocked and wanted to resist, but was unable to do so.

In a flash, Yang Kai was hurled out towards where the Old Ancestors had gathered.

“Damn you Big Head Xiang! Big Head Mi!” Yang Kai cursed as he flew across the void. Those two Big Heads were such bullies.

“Is this… appropriate?” Liu Zhi Ping appeared confused when she saw Yang Kai flying towards where the Old Ancestors gathered. In fact, she was slightly worried.

She could not see where the so-called Old Sir was; however, she could clearly see that the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Masters had their guards up as they surrounded ‘something’.

Anyone or anything that could cause over 100 Old Ancestors to act so cautiously must be very powerful.

Now that Yang Kai was thrust into their midst, how would he sort out any misunderstanding?

“It’s fine,” Mi Jing Lun said with a smile, “The Old Ancestors are all gathered there, so if something really happens, they can also protect him. Moreover, he is only in the Seventh Order, so the Old Ancestors and that Old Senior should not care if a Junior like him barges into their gathering.”

If possible, Mi Jing Lun wanted to go personally; however, as a peak Eighth-Order Master, it was less appropriate or believable for him to act like a na?ve Junior rather than a real youngster like Yang Kai.

“But… but…”

“Look, we can’t see that Old Sir, but Yang Kai can. Maybe there is something unique about him?” Xiang Shan continued along with Mi Jing Lun’s reasoning, “Since he is unique, he should receive preferential treatment as well.”

After saying that, Mi Jing Lun and Xiang Shan looked at each other and grinned.

Ou Yang Lie’s face twitched repeatedly as he stared at these two with narrowed eyes.

[They managed to think up so much sophistry in so little time? How can they live with themselves if they do this every day, all day long?] Ou Yang Lie cursed in his heart and then walked away, feeling ashamed just standing with them.

Yang Kai also cursed and swore at the two Big Heads; however, they just smiled back at him encouragingly, which irked him even more.

He had already been thrown towards the Old Ancestors, and was halfway there before he managed to steady himself, so it was far too late to turn back as that would only be more embarrassing.

Thus, he emboldened himself to hold the tea set with both hands, keep his head up, and strode forward.

The Old Ancestors obviously saw him and appeared puzzled at his sudden intrusion.

With a bull-headed boldness he had cultivated his whole life, Yang Kai ignored them outright and directly flew to the Old Sir and said with a smile, “Old Sir, you must be thirsty. Please have some tea.”

Upon saying this, regardless of whether he caused the Old Ancestors to be upset, Yang Kai placed the tea set on the old man’s side and got busy.

Yang Kai naturally broke out into a cold sweat as Cang curiously observed him.

He came to serve tea and was only in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, so regardless of whether this Old Sir was a friend or foe, he would not make a move against a Junior thousands of times younger than him, right?

Soon, Cang did not bother about this interesting Junior and turned to look at one of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, “Let’s continue.”

Yang Kai did not know which Old Ancestor spoke, but a voice from behind followed, “According to the ancient records, the Cave Heavens and Paradises seemed to have appeared overnight in the 3,000 Worlds. Then a wide range of disciples began to train the next generation to prepare them for the Black Ink Battlefields for each of the Great Passes…”

Yang Kai listened for a while and understood that the Old Ancestor was talking about the founding of the Cave Heavens and Paradises, which happened so long ago that rather than records, it was more like legends and myths that the current Old Ancestors only somewhat knew of.

After all, there was not much written about it in the ancient books.

Some time later, the same Old Ancestor also briefly spoke about the many years of struggles between the Human Race and Black Ink Clan. It was not until the last few hundred years that the Human Race gradually achieved the upper hand. Eventually, they decided to launch a crusade and advanced to this location.

The Old Ancestor did not say much in detail and just broadly described the events of history. He did not mention anything sensitive such as the Purifying Light or the Evil Purging Divine Spears.

They still had no way to determine whether this old man in front of them was a friend or foe. Though the possibility of him being an ally was very high, it was always good to be cautious.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai’s had finished his work. He brewed the tea from Mi Jing Lun’s treasured tea leaves collection and respectfully presented it, “Old Sir, have a cup of tea.”

Cang answered with a smile, “You’re quite thoughtful, little one.”

The Old Ancestor who spoke just now glanced at Yang Kai with a frown. He was the one who spoke all the while instead of Cang, who barely spoke a few words. If anyone needed a cup of tea, it was him.

Cang drank the tea and Yang Kai took back the cup and refilled it.

Yang Kai ignored the glare of the many Old Ancestors. There were more than 100 of them here, so surely, they did not expect him to serve every one of them, right? How could he serve so much tea?

It was better for him to serve one person. After drinking three cups in a row, Cang smacked his lips and exclaimed, “I haven’t tasted this for years. I’ve almost forgotten what tea tasted like.”

The Myriad Demons Heaven Old Ancestor softly said, “If Senior wants to drink tea, this brat can stay here to serve Senior as long as you like.”

Yang Kai suddenly shot a glare towards him.

[What is the meaning of this? Why are you so quick to abandon me? Are you all in agreement to isolate me? Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you taught me some Eye Secret Techniques!] He thought.

Unfortunately for Yang Kai, he soon realized that none of these Old Ancestors who had lived for so long cared about niceties with a mere Junior. The Myriad Demons Old Ancestor did not even glance at Yang Kai as he continued, “Senior, while drinking tea is a small matter, we have many doubts and hope that Senior can answer them.”

Cang nodded and said, “This Old Master knows, but there is so much to cover. I don’t even know where to start. How about this? Ask me what you want to know and I will answer accordingly.”

The Old Ancestors were surprised that he was so quick to offer up his knowledge.

The Old Ancestors exchanged glances for a moment before one of them asked, “How should we address Senior?”

In fact, since they arrived, they had been telling him about the history of the 3,000 Worlds and had not asked him anything.

The old man said with a smile, “Cang!”

“Cang? As in the Cang from the sky(苍天)?” The Old Ancestor raised his eyebrows slightly.

Cang slowly shook his head, “The Cang(苍) from common people (苍生)”

Although the words were nearly the same, they had very different meanings.

The Old Ancestors were noticeably less wary.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao then asked, “A few years ago, when I and several others were trapped in the Black Ink Nest Space, was it Senior who rescued us?”

Cang nodded and replied, “En, it was me.”

Although they had speculated that it was him, this was not confirmed until now.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao immediately cupped her fists, “Many thanks, Senior.”

If Cang had not broken the Black Ink Nest Space trap from the outside, the Old Ancestors would have died inside. He was their saviour.

“No need to thank me. It could be considered as you having saved yourselves. If not for the leaking of the aura from your battle, I would not have thought to strike at that moment.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao pondered for a moment before understanding what Cang meant.

On that day, the Bright King Cave Heaven Old Ancestor detonated his Soul at the border of the Black Ink Nest Space, opening a crack in it in an attempt to open a way out for other Old Ancestors.

It was the Bright King Old Ancestor’s efforts that allowed the aura of that great battle to leak out; otherwise, even if the battle was intense in that enclosed space, how could Cang have noticed it? How then could he have saved them in time?

“Regardless, I will never forget this life-saving kindness. If I don’t die in the battle ahead, I will certainly do whatever is within my ability to assist Senior when you require it.”

Cang smiled and replied, “We can discuss the future in the future.”

In truth, regardless of the result of the war, Cang did not expect to live much longer. It was already pushing the limits of his endurance to live till today, and he was missing his old friends and felt he should reunite with them soon.

His old friends must have been waiting impatiently for him.

Another Old Ancestor asked, “So, is the Black Ink Clan’s Mother Nest really here?”

As he spoke, he looked towards the vast darkness before them.

When the Old Ancestors broke out of the Black Ink Nest Space with the help of an outside force, they had determined that the person who had aided them must be very close to the Mother Nest. Otherwise, there should have been no way to break through the Black Ink Nest Space from the outside.
