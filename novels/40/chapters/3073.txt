The fact that Wu Kuang had been reborn sent shockwaves across the Dragon Clan, rendering them speechless for a long time. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just then, a figure appeared on the horizon, flying over from afar in an unstable manner. Looking like an intoxicated bee, the person appeared quite weak as he flailed through the air, like he would fall into the sea at any moment.

Everyone turned to look at him with doubtful gazes.

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly after he recognized who the person was.

Zhu Qing uttered curiously, “It’s Li Jiao.”

With a pale face, Li Jiao suddenly spat a mouthful of blood. Upon seeing Yang Kai in the distance, he anxiously called out to him, as though he had met his long lost family member, “Palace Master Yang…”

Yang Kai hurriedly went over and supported his weight before checking on him. Upon making sure that he wasn’t at risk of losing his life, Yang Kai spoke to him using Divine Sense, “Is Fu Chi dead?”

“Yes!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed, “Did you kill him?”

Li Jiao shook his head.

He wanted to kill Fu Chi, but he was no match for him in the end. If that unwelcome guest hadn’t barged into that place at the most critical moment, he would have lost his life by now. Although Li Jiao understood the consequences of killing a member of the Dragon Clan, the situation he was in did not allow him to think things through. As he thought about what Lu San Niang had suffered through over the years, he knew that he could only get revenge for her by killing Fu Chi.

“It was Wu Chen! He killed Fu Chi!” Li Jiao uttered.

“Wu Chen?” Yang Kai’s expression turned awkward when he heard that. [How could it be him?]

Yang Kai could now set his mind at ease upon learning that it wasn’t Li Jiao who had killed Fu Chi; however, he still couldn’t believe what Li Jiao had said. When he was certain that Fu Chi was dead, only two possibilities came into his mind. First, Li Jiao suddenly experienced a surge of power and managed to slay him. If that was the case, Li Jiao shouldn’t even dream about leaving Dragon Island. Perhaps even his Fire Dragon Palace would be destroyed as well.

However, Yang Kai was doubtful this was possible. The reason he allowed Li Jiao to race after Fu Chi at that time was that he knew that given Li Jiao’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to kill Fu Chi. The most Li Jiao could do was to fight with Fu Chi to vent his anger. It would be unrealistic to think that Li Jiao could really kill Fu Chi.

The second possibility was that Wu Kuang had killed Fu Chi. That was far more likely, and perhaps the only possibility. However, what Li Jiao just told him was beyond his imagination.

[It was Wu Chen who killed Fu Chi?] Yang Kai had always felt that something was off about Wu Chen, so he had been wary of him. However, for the past month, Wu Chen had never shown any sign of hostility towards him. Instead, he had offered him help a number of times.

What concerned Yang Kai was the way Wu Chen’s cultivation had strangely broken through.

Initially, Wu Chen was just a Second-Order Emperor, but one month later, he had become a Third-Order Emperor. Although it was just a difference of a Minor Realm, it was as difficult as ascending to the Heavens for most cultivators.

Yang Kai did not know how Wu Chen got the opportunity to achieve this breakthrough, but he just felt that the latter was more complicated than he appeared to be.

“Who is Wu Chen?” Fu Zhun suddenly questioned.

Li Jiao uttered the last sentence directly instead of using Divine Sense, and everyone in that place had incredible cultivation, so naturally, they could hear what he had said clearly. Now, they were certain that Fu Chi had passed away. Upon finding out the culprit’s name, naturally, the Dragon Clan members wanted to know more about Wu Chen.

After Fu Zhun pressed him with her Dragon Pressure, Li Jiao spurted out blood again, looking like he was about to lose his life.

Yang Kai immediately stood in front of him and replied, “He’s a Human from Half-Dragon City.”

Fu Zhun snarled, “How did a lowly Human manage to kill a member of the Dragon Clan?” She suddenly stared at Li Jiao and narrowed her eyes, “Fu Chi’s blood aura still lingers on his body. You must be lying! It was you who killed him!”

Li Jiao hurriedly shook his head, “It wasn’t me! It was really Wu Chen! Although I fought with Fu Chi, in the end, I wasn’t able to do anything to him. In fact, he was just about to kill me when Wu Chen suddenly appeared out of nowhere and used some strange Secret Technique to instantly subdue Fu Chi.”

“How is this Wu Chen so powerful?” Zhu Yan was shocked by these words. It was almost impossible to instantly subdue an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon. How could there be such a Master hidden in Half-Dragon City?

After giving it a thought, Zhu Yan uttered solemnly, “Tell us everything in detail. If you tell a single lie, your life will be forfeit.”

Although Li Jiao appeared battered, he remained calm and collected. So, he didn’t look like he was lying.

After nodding slightly, Li Jiao began to arrange his thoughts.

Yang Kai gently grabbed Li Jiao’s wrist and directed his Emperor Qi into the latter’s body. After Li Jiao recovered a little, he shot Yang Kai a grateful glance before he began narrating the story.

He did not try to hide anything as he told them how he followed Fu Chi to the deserted Spirit Island and went all out to kill him. He also told them how Wu Chen appeared out of nowhere suddenly, and the transformation of Wu Chen’s body as well as the wild swings in his personality.

“After I fled from that place, I heard Fu Chi’s screams. Following that, rain started falling from the sky even though there were no clouds above. Although I’m just a Dragonborn, I know a thing or two about Fallen Dragon Rain, so that’s why I was certain Fu Chi had died, and the person who killed him was Wu Chen.”

Naturally, he was gleeful that Fu Chi was killed, even though he wasn’t the one who killed him. Nevertheless, Li Jiao had dealt some serious damage to Fu Chi using his desperation attacks, allowing him to vent some of his anger.

It would have been quite difficult for Wu Chen to end Fu Chi’s life if not for Li Jiao’s prior assault. Taking that into consideration, he had contributed to Fu Chi’s death. In other words, he had personally gotten his revenge.

Although he knew that Wu Chen was dangerous, Li Jiao still felt grateful to him.

After everyone heard his story, a myriad of expressions came over them.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai uttered, “You mean, both his appearance and temperament changed…” [Wu Chen, Wu Chen… Wu Chen! Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen!]

Wu Chen was just an alias, a simple combination of Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen’s names, which was perfect for them. After all, these two Great Emperors now shared the same body, so it was apt that they had made an alias by combining their names.

Upon realizing this, Yang Kai put on a bitter smile.

No matter how imaginative he was, it was impossible for him to associate Wu Chen and the two Great Emperors; after all, Wu Chen didn’t show any demeanour that resembled that of a Great Emperor, not to mention that he was extremely thin, and he looked like a monkey. All in all, he looked nothing like either of those two Great Emperors.

Now, it seemed that Wu Kuang had obtained full control of the body, and Duan Hong Chen had been suppressed. Yang Kai wondered how Wu Kuang had managed to do that.

As he thought about it, Yang Kai became shocked all of a sudden. He recalled that 500 of them were recruited to this place to build the palace, but one month later, only about 300 were left. What’s more, most of those who had gone missing were Emperor Realm Masters. Yang Kai didn’t think too hard about what had happened to them, for their life-or-death had nothing to do with him; however, upon realizing Wu Chen’s identity, he now knew what their fate was. Wu Kuang must have devoured them.

Now, there was a reasonable explanation for the fact that Wu Chen’s power had increased significantly in just one month. He was the legendary Heaven Devouring Great Emperor who had created the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. Judging from how the Embodiment cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, Yang Kai understood that those cultivators must have become the food for Wu Kuang’s growth.

Since Yang Kai could figure out Wu Chen’s identity, naturally, Mo Huang, Zhu Yan, and the others could do the same. Mo Huang had just said that Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen were now living in the same body, which verified what Li Jiao said about Wu Chen’s personality swings.

Now, everyone realized the severity of the situation.

Fu Zhun immediately extended her hand towards Li Jiao and uttered, “Come with me.”

All the Dragon Clan members were shocked that Wu Kuang had killed a Dragon, but now, the most important thing for them was to find out Wu Kuang’s whereabouts. He had snuck into Dragon Island and even pretended to be a lowly Human, so it was impossible that he was just here to kill a Dragon.

In order to look for Wu Kuang, they had to bring Li Jiao with them, only he knew the location where Wu Kuang had made the move that caused Fu Chi’s death.

When Li Jiao saw Fu Zhun’s fair hand extend towards him, he became rooted to the spot as the Emperor Qi in his body stopped running entirely, he was barely even able to breathe. He was like an inexperienced rabbit that was stunned on the spot when a falcon was coming at him with sharp claws.

It was then he came to realize just how massive the gap between the Dragon Clan’s Second Elder and him was. Even with his prided Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, it only took an instant for him to be utterly suppressed. His already pale face turned a shade whiter at that moment.

Just then, cracking sounds could be heard as Yang Kai turned his hand into a Dragon Claw and, ignoring the hindrance of space, he reached for Fu Zhun’s fair hand.

As soon as he started moving, the Embodiment made a move as well by attempting to land a fist on Fu Zhun’s cheek. The attack appeared forceful and ruthless.

Right then, a phantom flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes as he felt a forceful thump on his chest, upon which he was sent flying backwards for more than hundreds of metres before he spat a mouthful of blood. Then, as if struck by lightning, the Embodiment stiffened and directly fell into the sea.

Shocked, Zhu Qing hurriedly flew towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai covered his chest with his hand and raised his gaze, only to see that Li Jiao had been picked up by Fu Zhun as though he was a chicken. Then, she leapt into the air and flew in a particular direction. Seeing that, the other Dragon Clan members hurriedly followed her.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth and cursed at Fu Zhun. Although he knew that he was no match for someone as strong as a Great Emperor, he couldn’t stay put when Fu Zhun made a move against Li Jiao. Despite the difference in their powers, he had to show her that he was unyielding.

It was only because Fu Zhun didn’t want to waste time on him that she simply pushed him out of the way. Otherwise, he would have suffered a more severe injury.

“You’re quite bold.” Mo Huang shot Yang Kai a glance, but it wasn’t certain whether what he just said was praise or mockery.

It wasn’t until this moment that he finally took the time to observe Yang Kai. For some reason, he wasn’t fond of him. In fact, he was aware of the reason, but he just didn’t want to acknowledge it.

If it weren’t because Mo Xiao Qi had been longing for this brat, Mo Huang would have thought that this young man was a rising star worthy of praise. After all, no other young First-Order Emperor would have the guts to break into Dragon Island, let alone the ability to turn the place upside down.

Zhu Yan remained on the same spot as he looked past the void that was hundreds of metres away and gazed at Yang Kai and Zhu Qing, who were standing together. Then, he uttered, “Both of you, come with us.”

He couldn’t let Yang Kai and Zhu Qing stay in this place because he was worried that Yang Kai might seize the chance and flee from Dragon Island. The Dragon Clan couldn’t accept such an outcome. It had been an eventful day for the Dragon Clan already, but if Yang Kai managed to end everything by abducting a Dragon woman who was qualified to be an Elder, the Dragon Clan would lose what face it had left.
