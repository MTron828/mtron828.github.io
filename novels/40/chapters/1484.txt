Qu Zheng, like Mo Xiao Sheng, was a master at the peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, but he had been in retreat these past years to try to comprehend the mysteries of the Origin King Realm and thus rarely showed himself. Mo Xiao Sheng mostly handled all of the Union’s day-to-day matters.

This situation was quite common on Shadowed Star. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Because of the constraints of the World Principles here, the limit any cultivator could achieve was the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, but all masters who reached this level would naturally not be content with the status quo and would strive to achieve the legendary Origin King Realm.

No one had succeeded, but that didn’t hinder these masters’ determination and enthusiasm to explore greater heights in the Martial Dao and Heavenly Way.

When the Emperor Garden opened, Qu Zheng had also entered, but the trip had not been very rewarding. At this time, what was being discussed with Mo Xiao Sheng was an after-action report on the Emperor Garden.

Suddenly, there was the sound of footsteps from outside the hall and a disciple’s voice called out, “Reporting to Union Master and Great Elder, Thunder Typhoon Sect’s Fang Peng is here to request a meeting.”

“That Old Ghost Fang?” Qu Zheng frowned as he muttered with displeasure, “That old dog dared to come to my Heaven Battling City? Does he not put this Qu in his eyes?”

Mo Xiao Sheng also showed a look of suspicion. One had to know that Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect were the two giants of Shadowed Star. Although they weren’t blood enemies, they did have some small skirmishes between them with several disciples from both forces perishing at the other’s hands each year.

However, showing up at the other force’s headquarters was nothing short of a great taboo!

Moreover, Fang Peng’s identity was extraordinary: he was none other than the Sect Master of Thunder Typhoon Sect, making his status equivalent to Qu Zheng’s.

With his high status and sensitive identity, arriving at Heaven Battling City unannounced was likely to cause friction and possibly even disputes between the two giants. At worst, it might result in an all-out war, so after hearing the disciple’s report, Qu Zheng couldn’t help becoming angry.

“Union Master, please calm yourself,” Although Mo Xiao Sheng also had many doubts, his wit was sharper than Qu Zheng’s, and he hurriedly said. “Fang Peng must have something important to discuss with Union master since he dares to arrive in Heaven Battling City. If that’s the case, you might as well hear what he has to say; it won’t be too late to decide how to respond afterwards.”

Hearing this proposal, Qu Zheng felt it was somewhat reasonable; moreover, as this place’s master, he wasn’t afraid of a lone Fang Peng, so he nodded lightly after he pondered for a moment, “Very well, then we’ll act per Great Elder’s intention, but if that old dog really came here to provoke my Heaven Battling Union... Hmph! This old master will let him know what the price of overconfidence is!”

Just after these words were spoken, a loud laugh came from outside the hall, and a hearty voice called out, “I’ve not seen you for many years, but it seems Brother Qu’s temper is as short as ever.”

At the same time this voice sounded, a figure appeared outside the hall. The Heaven Battling Union disciple was thoroughly shocked by this person’s appearance and hurriedly tried to block him, but he was easily kicked aside and unable to get up. Immediately after, the uninvited guest walked into the hall directly, wearing a carefree smile, without the slightest trace of politeness, as if this place was his own private courtyard.

Qu Zheng’s expression turned gloomy as Mo Xiao Sheng frowned, a clear look of displeasure appearing on both their faces.

The man who walked in was Fang Peng, the Sect Master of Thunder Typhoon Sect, but neither of the two seated inside had expected that this guy would be so thick-skinned.

After entering the hall, Fang Peng found a place to sit down for himself before turning to Qu Zheng and saying, “Brother Qu, I’m a guest from afar, so why don’t I see tea being served? Is Heaven Battling Union really so stingy?”

“Hmph, if it were someone else who had arrived, this Qu would definitely welcome them, but you... we have no tea for the likes of you,” Qu Zheng snorted coldly.

Fang Peng just curled his lips, not bothering to dwell on this seemingly irrelevant topic.

“Old Ghost Fang, instead of taking care of your Thunder Typhoon Sect you’ve run tens of thousands of kilometres to my Heaven Battling City. Why?” Qu Zheng got straight to the point, “Cheng Peng Xuan fell in the Emperor Garden, so if you leave Thunder Typhoon Sect rashly, aren’t you afraid someone will take the opportunity to stir up trouble?”

“Who would dare?” Immediately after Qu Zheng’s mentioned Cheng Peng Xuan falling, Fang Peng’s face became gloomy and he coldly snorted, “Although Great Elder Cheng’s demise is unfortunate, my Thunder Typhoon Sect is no pushover; who would dare court death by challenging us?”

“Your courage isn’t small,” Qu Zheng sneered, his eyes faintly flashing, “If this old master were to make you remain here forever, I think your Thunder Typhoon Sect would be nothing more than a flock of chickens waiting to be slaughtered.”

“Make me remain here?” Fang Peng pointed to himself with a grin, “Don’t try to boast shamelessly, Brother Qu! If you have such confidence, you are welcome to try burying this Fang in Heaven Battling City.”

Hearing this taunt, a dangerous light flickered across Qu Zheng’s eyes as if he really wanted to take action.

This couldn’t be helped though, since Thunder Typhoon Sect would likely collapse if Fang Peng was beheaded here, leaving only Heaven Battling Union to lord over Shadowed Star.

However, Fang Peng remained utterly calm and relaxed, as if he had something to rely on, causing Qu Zheng some confusion and stopping him from acting ruthlessly.

Mo Xiao Sheng also felt confused. Although Fang Peng’s strength was indeed exceptional, since he had entered the heart of Heaven Battling City, his life was no longer his to control. This old dog couldn’t have lost his mind and taken the initiative to deliver his head, could he?

“En, enough nonsense,” After a long, silent stalemate, Fang Peng waved his hand and said, “Truth be told, this Fang daring to come to Heaven Battling Union alone this time was simply because he was ordered to.”

“Ordered?” Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng were both startled, “To do what and by who?”

Fang Peng was Thunder Typhoon Sect’s Sect Master, who could order him to do anything? Both of these men’s hearts clenched when they realised the answer to this question.

“Who do you think?” Fang Peng squinted at them.

Exchanging a glance, both Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng turned severe, and only after a long silence did Qu Zheng hesitantly ask, “Could it be them?”

“En, it’s them. Who else could order this Fang into action personally?” Fang Peng grinned meaningfully, “Or do you think this old master would willingly come here to die? While this old master may not be young, he still hasn’t lived nearly enough. How could I waltz right into this tiger’s den without something to take advantage of?”

Although his words weren’t pleasant to the ear, Qu Zheng and Mo Xiao Sheng could only look at each other and suppress the murderous intent in their hearts.

Since the other party had come here under ‘their’ orders, they could not do anything to him. Although Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect were the two giants of Shadowed Star, their strength was insignificant compared with that side.

Thousands of years ago, the Ancient Yang Sect was comparable to Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect, but because it had offended that side, it had been uprooted overnight, showing just how terrifying their power was.

Usually, their people were completely indifferent to worldly affairs, so why would they suddenly order Fang Peng to contact Heaven Battling Union at this time?

“Brother Fang, if you have something to say then get to the point, you and I know that while Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect can lord over Shadowed Star, we still fall short of their power. Since they’ve begun to move, the Heaven Battling Union and I naturally won’t just stand by,” Qu Zheng took a deep breath and his attitude became much more easygoing.

“Brother Qu really understands what must be done!” Fang Peng laughed before he too assumed a solemn expression, “That little brat from High Heaven Sect has left the Flowing Flame Sand Field.”

Qu Zheng was taken aback, and quickly reacted, “You mean that boy called Yang Kai?”

“Indeed!” Fang Peng nodded lightly, “And from his movements, it seems he wants to go to Shadow Moon Hall!”

“Shadow Moon Hall?” Qu Zheng frowned, “What does this have to do with us?”

“Why does Brother Qu try to play dumb?” Fang Peng sneered, “Although High Heaven Sect is nothing of importance itself, since it is located inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, no one can pose any threat to it. If it’s given enough time to develop, will Shadowed Star still have a place for you and me?”

“Brother Fang’s meaning is to strangle this danger in its cradle?”

“Exactly!” Fang Peng nodded sincerely, “If he had remained hidden inside the Flowing Flame Sand Field, I’m afraid no one would have any way to deal with him, but since he’s decided to come out on his own, he no longer gets to decide whether he lives or dies.”

“That being said, I heard that this boy’s strength and means are extraordinary. No average person would be able to do anything to him.”

“So what? No matter how great his strength might be, he’s still a boy who just broke through to the Origin Returning Realm. You and I have countless masters at our disposal, could it be that you think we have no way to take him?”

“En,” Qu Zheng nodded lightly, feeling like he had been making a bit too much of a fuss, but he still suspiciously asked, “But what does any of this have to do with ‘them?’”

“A great deal!” Fang Peng grinned meaningfully, “High Heaven Sect has an Origin King Grade Starship. Hasn’t Brother Qu heard?”

“This Qu has heard such rumours, but is it truly an Origin King Grade Starship?” Qu Zheng was a little sceptical.

“Whether or not it is real, you might as well ask Elder Mo. Elder Mo has seen it with his own eyes.”

Qu Zheng shot a look over at Mo Xiao Sheng who nodded solemnly and said, “En, there’s no doubt that it is an Origin King Grade Starship; however, I have no idea how they made it or where they found it.”

“It doesn’t matter where they got it. The key is that as long as we can obtain that Starship, we can leave the Shadowed Star and go to another Cultivation Star to break through to the Origin King Realm!”

As soon as this statement came out, both Mo Xiao Sheng and Qu Zheng’s eyes lit up with desire.

The Origin King Realm was something they always dreamed of reaching but could never achieve; however, with an Origin King Grade Starship, it might just be possible.

“Presumably, Brother Qu understands what this means, moreover... Ye Xi Yun has joined High Heaven Sect and currently holds the status of Great Elder. Do you think that side will just let High Heaven Sect off?” Fang Peng grinned deviously.

“So that’s how it is!” Qu Zheng nodded lightly, finally comprehending the whole picture. Whether it was because of that Origin King Grade Starship or Ye Xi Yun, it was impossible for ‘them’ to sit by and watch High Heaven Sect develop. That side would definitely be looking for any opportunity to wipe High Heaven Sect out.

And their Sect Master Yang Kai’s little outing was one such opportunity!

“Is this matter to be undertaken by just our two forces?” Qu Zheng asked.

“For the time being, but that side seems to be sending people as well.”

“Hmph, manipulative bastards.” Qu Zheng snorted coldly. It was almost inevitable that that Origin King Grade Starship would fall into their hands if High Heaven Sect was really eliminated. At that time, Thunder Typhoon Sect and Heaven Battling Union would only get some leftover soup to drink.

“Their fist is bigger, after all.” Fang Peng smiled helplessly, “I’ve delivered their message, but as for the specifics, that is for you and me to discuss. Because this is related to that Starship and Ye Xi Yun, we can’t just kill Yang Kai but must capture him alive instead to use as a bargaining chip to force High Heaven Sect to surrender.”
