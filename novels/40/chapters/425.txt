The flag which had originally been obtained by Yang Kang’s team was suddenly taken away. This made Yang Kang, who was filled of joy, unable to help feeling awkward.

Moreover, immediately after this unknown man snatched the flag, he had thrown it into the sky and it had subsequently disappeared.

But although Yang Kang let out an angry roar, he didn’t dare to act rashly.

The extremely powerful Spiritual Energy which could only belong to a Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary master still lingered about.

Not only did Yang Kang not dare to act, but everyone in the field didn’t dare move about hastily.

Such a master hiding nearby was an extreme deterrent to everyone. None of them knew who this person was, but they all knew that this master was not one of their own.

Because of the deterrent Divine Sense, the cultivators who were originally pressuring Yang Tie and the Duan Mu Family’s remaining masters had withdrawn a good amount of their strength.

The only exceptions were the Wind and Cloud Dual Guards; this pair of old men rushed about the battlefield, casually using their Martial Skills and launching attacks towards Yang Kang’s allies. Although the people brought by Yang Ying felt that these two were somewhat unfamiliar, none of them gave it much thought as it had only been a day since most of them had met, allowing the Wind and Cloud guards to stroll freely upon the battlefield.

After a few rounds, the Wind and Cloud guards had already arrived in front of Yang Tie.

When he saw that the situation was deteriorating, Yang Kang couldn’t help yelling out, “What are you doing!? Quickly capture my Third Brother!”

With the flag gone, the only prize left was Yang Tie himself, if he were to lose him too, Yang Kang would have not only failed to steal a chicken but also have lost his rice too.

Yang Kang’s shout finally shook everyone awake, all of his allies once again putting forth their best effort.

Yang Ying also roared, “Stop them!”

The cultivators on both sides once again engaged in an all out struggle.

As the Wind and Cloud Guards approached Yang Tie, amidst the chaos, they actually received a lot of assistance from Yang Ying’s allies, successfully bypassing the two Duan Mu Family masters who were stubbornly guarding Yang Tie and seizing the latter.

Yang Ying laughed happily when he saw this and called out, “Good work you two, bring him to me!”

“Yes!” The Wind Guard loudly replied.

“Hurry!”

“Catch!”

As he spoke, he threw Yang Tie out of the crowd.

But what happened next confounded Yang Ying. The unknown man who had just snatched the flag, actually jumped into the air and caught Yang Tie before soaring away with him.

At the same time, the Wind and Cloud Dual Guards also leapt up into the air and flew away, disappearing into the night sky.

“Fifth Brother, Seventh Brother, thanks!” A familiar voice drifted over from the distance.

The faces of Yang Kang and Yang Ying suddenly filled with shock and anger as they simultaneously exclaimed, “Ninth Brother!”

The spectators who heard the two brother’s cries also became amazed!

Ninth Brother! Apparently the one who had appeared was the Yang Family’s youngest Young Lord, Yang Kai!

Earlier, Yang Kang had said that Yang Zhao and Yang Shen had taken their forces to Yang Kai’s compound to look for trouble, and given his performance earlier today, coupled with the fact that he hadn’t been able to recruit any significant help, even though his situation was better than Yang Tie’s, he was still in danger of being eliminated tonight.

At this time, shouldn’t that Yang Kai be holed up in his base? How come he had suddenly appeared here to reap the fisherman’s benefits?

Also, he seemed to have brought two strong helpers with him.

[This person simply didn’t fear the Heavens!]

None of the crowd could understand, and even Yang Kang’s exclamation just now was filled with a thick tone of disbelief, yet all of this only further excited this audience.

It was as if this unexpected turn of events was just the good show they had wanted to see.

Only a moment later, Yang Kai had already taken Yang Tie several thousand meters away, his True Qi pushed to the limit as his figure flickered through the night sky, leaving behind only a long trail of afterimages.

“Sure enough, it really was the Little Lord!” Tang Yu Xian smiled and muttered; when she had seen the golden streak, Tang Yu Xian had already suspected it was the Golden Feather Eagle, so now after hearing Yang Kai’s voice she immediately confirmed her judgment.

“You already knew?” Yang Kang glanced at her unpleasantly.

Tang Yu Xian maintained her expression and shook her head, “It was just a guess. I wasn’t certain until now.”

Yang Kang’s expression was ugly but he didn’t say anything more, he knew that Tu Feng and Tang Yu Xian were both very respectful of Yang Kai. For this time’s Inheritance War he had deliberately chosen these two as his guards, not only because their strength was good, but also to disturb Yang Kai.

He didn’t expect that at such a critical juncture, he would actually bring such a disgrace upon himself.

Both the flag and the person had actually been taken away by Yang Kai, while he and Yang Ying had both lost many of their troops but ended up with nothing.

The depression in his heart could easily be imagined.

“Pursue!” Yang Kang gnashed his teeth and flew up.

Yang Ying also wore a gloomy expression and followed suit.

The two groups quickly soared away, leaving behind only the shattered ruins of Yang Tie’s mansion as well as the five injured Duan Mu Family masters.

In order to pursue Yang Kai and recapture Yang Tie who was robbed by him, both Yang Kang and Yang Ying had had no intention of dealing with these remaining Duan Mu cultivators.

The first battle of the first night had wound up with a fisherman reaping the entire harvest, this outcome had greatly exceeded the expectations of everyone present, the spectating crowds quickly followed the pursuers.

These people were also now very interested in this Ninth Young Lord, Yang Kai, who was both bold and daring. They wanted to know what kind of person the youngest Yang Family Young Lord was, and what gave him the confidence to pull off such a stunt.

In the back of their minds, this crowd actually didn’t want Yang Kai to be caught.

With such a person participating, this Inheritance War would no doubt be more interesting and exciting.

As for the bloody aftermath in Yang Tie’s compound, the five remaining Duan Mu Family masters exchanged a glance before smiling helplessly, sitting down, and tending to their injuries.

They had tried their best.

This time, the Duan Mu Family had sent out around forty people, but after this one battle, only five had survived!

The Duan Mu Family had suffered a great loss here in terms of personnel, but in terms of reputation, they had gained significantly! Those who had witnessed this battle would have nothing but praise for the Duan Mu Family, who had loyally stood by their allies even in the face of certain defeat.

Such a family was worthy of becoming friends with.

So in the long run, the Duan Mu Family hadn’t just lost, but rather gained.

Yang Kang and Yang Ying hurriedly chased after Yang Kai with their respective allies, and at first they could still see his retreating figure, but as time passed, even his shadow disappeared.

Many Immortal Ascension Boundary masters had released their Divine Senses in an attempt to lock onto Yang Kai’s position, but as they did, it seemed like their Divine Senses sank into an endless sea, unable to play any effect at all.

It was as if Yang Kai and Yang Tie had simply vanished into thin air.

This result had made both Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s expressions grow uglier.

“The speed of your Ninth Brother is too terrifying!” Gao Rang Feng muttered, his face filled with astonishment. Even while Yang Kai was holding another person, he had still managed to evade a large group of Immortal Ascension masters, such speed could only be described as monstrous.

“No matter how fast he is, with so many Immortal Ascension Boundary masters Divine Senses searching for him, how could he hide his whereabouts and aura?” Kang Zhan shook his head, unable to understand how Yang Kai had accomplished this.

Yang Ying’s eyes flashed before glancing towards Tang Yu Xian and smirking, “Fifth Brother, I heard that the Blood Warrior you brought with you has a particularly powerful Soul, could it be that even with her Divine Sense she can’t find Ninth Brother’s trail?”

Listening to Yang Ying, Yang Kang also turned his eyes questioningly to Tang Yu Xian.

However, Tang Yu Xian just shook her head and said, “I tried, but I can’t find any trace of the Little Lord.”

Yang Kang frowned and quickly said, “Yu Xian, I know that you have a good relationship with Ninth Brother, but don’t forget, right now it is the Inheritance War and you are a Blood Warrior of the Yang Family’s Blood Warrior Hall!”

Tang Yu Xian obviously understood this and also understood this and replied without hesitation: “The Blood Warriors know the difference between public and private affairs, since Young Lord Kang has exchanged enough merits for my and Tu Feng’s services, before Young Lord Kang falls in this Inheritance War, both of us will fully assist you!”

After listening to Tang Yu Xian’s words , Yang Kang knew not to pursue this matter any further, correcting his expression and nodding slightly, “I didn’t mean to question your loyalty. Since even you can’t find him, Ninth Brother must have a powerful master helping him hide his whereabouts.”

“You mean... the owner of that Divine Sense?” Yang Ying suddenly remembered the horrifying Spiritual Energy which had suppressed all of them earlier.

“It should be. With such a powerful master beside him, he could easily do this,” Yang Kang brow wrinkled, muttering to himself, “Strange, where did Ninth Brother find such a powerful helper?”

In the Inheritance War, many of the world’s forces participated; among them, the Eight Great Families had never sent anyone who exceeded the Immortal Ascension Boundary Fifth Stage before.

Other first-class forces would generally not send out Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters either, such powerhouses tended to be older and of very high rank, so they would refrain from interfering in events like the Inheritance War. Additionally, other forces and families couldn’t afford to risk such masters, as they were part of their respective Sect’s foundation.

So for first-class forces, the highest level of master they would normally send would be an Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage, of course, this wasn’t some kind of absolute rule and as the Inheritance War dragged on and became more heated, Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters sometimes appeared on the battlefield.

As for second-class forces, they rarely had masters stronger than the Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage.

For instance, in the Blood Battle Gang, only Sect Master Hu Man was an Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage. As the leader and pillar of the gang, how could he possibly get involved in such a dangerous affair? As for the Storm Hall, there wasn’t even a single Immortal Ascension Boundary Eighth Stage, Sect Master Xiao Ruo Han had only reached the Seventh Stage.

The available masters which second-class forces could send to participate in the Inheritance war were at most Immortal Ascension Boundary Sixth or Seventh Stage.

When it came to third-class forces, there were few masters who had reached the Immortal Ascension Boundary period, so the cultivators they could spare were even weaker than those sent by second-class forces.

Death in the Inheritance War wasn’t uncommon, and if these weaker forces suffered too many losses, it would lower their overall strength and quite possibly damage their foundation to the point where they might not be able to recover. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Because of this, no matter which forces were involved in the Inheritance War, the amount of manpower they would send out would only be as much as they could afford to lose.

As for Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, none of the Yang Family Young Lords had managed to attract one yet.

If Yang Kai really had such a boost with him, even pursuing him was a big risk for Yang Kang and Yang Ying, how could they have time to worry about grabbing benefits from him?

“It seems Ninth Brother has won big this time!” Yang Ying shook his head and grinned helplessly.

The flag was robbed by him and now even Yang Tie had fallen into his hands. One person and one flag could be exchanged for many useful things from the main family. Artifacts, Martial Skills, Secret Arts, pills, spirit herbs, refining materials, all of these things could be used to enhance his own strength, as well as the strength of his allies.

“Only if he can survive tonight,” Yang Kang coldly snorted. Right now, shouldn’t his home base be under siege? Instead of consolidating his mansion’s defence, Yang Kai had actually ran out and launched an attack. Although he had managed to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth, such a risk was definitely not worth it in Yang Kang’s opinion.
