The huge ship sailed for three months before finally arriving at the outskirts of the Chaotic Dead Territory.

An Eighth-Order Ancestor, the one Yang Kai had met before, was still stationed outside the Territory Gate. Although the current Chaotic Dead Territory was much less dangerous because of Yang Kai’s previous visit and it could even be said that there was no longer any danger at all, when it came to the almighty Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer, none dared to lower their vigilance.

The Territory Gate was guarded by many High-Rank Open Heaven Masters at all times, just in case.

“Senior Da Yi!” Yang Kai jumped down from the ship and respectfully greeted the Eighth-Order Ancestor.

The last time he met this Eighth-Order Master, Yang Kai had no idea how to address him, so he didn’t ask any question; however, when he was in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Yu Xiang Die told him that this person was an Eighth-Order Ancestor of Great Battle Cave Heaven, Clear Horizon Divine Monarch, Da Yi.

Clear Horizon Divine Monarch slightly nodded before looking behind him with a puzzled expression and calling out, “Liu Mu?”

They might have different backgrounds, but as Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, they naturally knew each other; after all, each of the Cave Heavens and Paradises had only so many Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. After having lived for so many years, everyone was basically familiar with each other.

Six Wood Divine Monarch stepped forward and respectfully cupped his fist, “Senior Brother Da Yi!”

Da Yi furrowed his brow, “What happened?”

He had already sensed the auras of many living people on the ship with his powerful Divine Sense, but he could not understand why Yang Kai and Liu Mu had brought these people here.

Furthermore, the presence of 30 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters on the ship also made him very concerned.

For the mobilization of such a huge force, several Cave Heavens and Paradises would have had to come together. He faintly felt that something big must have happened.

“Senior Brother Da Yi, it’s better if you see for yourself.” Liu Mu stretched out, gesturing him an invitation.

Clear Horizon Divine Monarch pondered for a moment before nodding in agreement.

Upon boarding the ship, he was beside himself in shock when he saw thousands of imprisoned Black Ink Disciples. Not to mention the fact that there were still some obvious traces left behind even if the Black Ink Disciples had been sealed by a Secret Technique.

For example, Fan Xiu Qi, who had advanced from the Fifth-Order to the Sixth-Order. He might have broken his Open Heaven Realm Order limit, but it also left a great deal of hidden danger in his body. Not only had his body dramatically expanded, but many lumps and black cysts had also appeared on his body, making him look extremely gruesome.

Liu Mu and Yang Kai accompanied Da Yi as the latter studied the Black Ink Disciples’ situation, briefly explaining what had happened in Black Territory.

Da Yi was surprised when he heard everything, “The Black Ink Clansman is actually hiding in Black Territory?”

Liu Mu corrected him, “Not hiding, but imprisoned. Right now, those old ghosts are discussing how to deal with him.”

“Then these Black Ink Disciples…”

Liu Mu glanced at Yang Kai before explaining, “Yang Boy said that the two inside had the ability to purge the Black Ink Strength, striking at the root of the problem, so we brought these Black Ink Disciples here.”

Da Yi naturally knew who ‘the two’ he was referring to. He had followed Yang Kai inside and had personally seen them after all.

“Are you confident?” Da Yi looked at Yang Kai.

“I’ll try my best!” Yang Kai didn’t dare give a definite answer. Although he had gotten along quite well with Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, he had no idea what was going on in their minds.

Da Yi slightly nodded his acknowledgement, “I’ll accompany you.”

As an Eighth-Order Ancestor guarding the Territory Gate, it was his duty to monitor every single movement related to the Chaotic Dead Territory.

After a simple arrangement, the others remained guarding the Territory Gate while Da Yi followed the ship into the Chaotic Dead Territory.

Liu Mu and the 30 High-Rank Masters immediately became a little nervous as the ship entered the Chaotic Dead Territory.

They had all heard of the Chaotic Dead Territory and knew how dangerous it was, but when they personally laid their eyes on it, they were totally confused. Much to their surprise, the Chaotic Dead Territory was completely calm and serene, without the slightest hint of danger.

This was very different from the rumors.

Each of their Sects had an Ancestor who was once stationed at this place. Even as the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestors, they could only enter the periphery of the Chaotic Dead Territory for a short time to investigate the situation and could not venture in too deep, otherwise their lives would be forfeit.

Rumour had it that the Chaotic Dead Territory was filled with the fallout of the Sun’s Burning Light and the Moon’s Serene Glimmer clashes. Every time they fought, it would bring about unimaginable destruction.

Seemingly noticing everyone’s curiosity, Da Yi explained, “The Chaotic Dead Territory used to be extremely dangerous, but ever since Yang Kai came here, this place has calmed down significantly.”

Hearing this, Liu Mu asked in surprise, “What did you do to turn their hostility into friendship?”

Yang Kai didn’t know how he should explain. The only reply he could give was, “You will know when you meet them.”

Liu Mu nodded before he took a deep breath and straightened his back, trying his best to put on a dignified air. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Apart from a large Spirit Province that seemed to be pieced together, there was nothing else inside the Chaotic Dead Territory.

This Spirit Province was created by Yang Kai and Da Yi together, using an abandoned Universe World from the adjacent Great Territory.

A glimmering ball of light that looked like a sun was hanging high above the Spirit Province, illuminating its surface.

The light seemed extremely gentle, but when Liu Mu used his Divine Sense to examine it, he suddenly let out a muffled groan as he stumbled and started bleeding from his mouth and nose.

“Ancestor!” Everyone was shocked.

Liu Mu immediately waved off, “I’m fine! Don’t try to probe that thing.”

Just now, when his Divine Sense came into contact with the light, he instantly felt a destructive force envelop him. It was so overwhelming that even an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Master like him was unable to resist it and was instantly injured.

If even someone as strong as him could get this injured, how could the other Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, who were also curious about this light, dare to rashly investigate? The few people who were about to probe it secretly rejoiced.

Fortunately, the injuries to Liu Mu’s Divine Sense weren’t too serious. Also, he knew that nothing in this Chaotic Dead Territory could be underestimated, so when he was investigating the ball of light, he had done so cautiously. These little injuries weren’t that big of a deal.

Be that as it may, the fact that he had suffered a loss even before meeting the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer made him realize just how powerful these two beings were.

The ship flew towards the Spirit Province and soon came to a stop in the void. Everyone looked down from the deck and was immediately stunned.

The cause of their shock was the sight of countless small stone-like men charging at each other like a tide on the plains of the Spirit Province.

These Small Stone Man didn’t seem to have high intelligence and were simply letting out strange cries as they rushed forward.

However, their numbers were overwhelming; there were at least hundreds of thousands of soldiers on each side.

Everyone looked on in amazement, because even with their vast experience, they had never seen a race like this. They could not determine which race they belonged to.

What was even more surprising was the fact that such a large group of living creatures were actually surviving in the Chaotic Dead Territory where the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer existed.

However, what happened next left everyone confused.

The two armies formed by the Small Stone Man, after colliding with each other, actually began to fight. Each of these Small Stone Man were holding weapons of varying shapes and sizes in their hands. They were trying their best to hack their enemies into pieces, for which they were willing to use even their hands and teeth if they had to.

The two armies moved as swiftly as the wind. By the looks of it, they were well-trained and were clearly directed by some brilliant commanders.

While the two armies were engaged in a fierce battle, more squads emerged from the sides, flanking and intercepting their respective enemies.

“What’s going on?” Liu Mu was completely confused. These Small Stone Men might be living creatures, but obviously they were not that strong. He could destroy them all by himself, but what he saw in front of him really confused him.

“They are the Small Stone Race. The are very similar to ants in their behaviour. They are a race I discovered in the New Great Territory,” Yang Kai explained.

“New Great Territory!” Liu Mu’s brow rose as he recalled the New Great Territory that had appeared besides the Star Boundary. The New Great Territory was occupied by Yang Kai as soon as it appeared, so there was nothing the Cave Heavens and Paradises could do about it. They knew nothing about the New Great Territory, but now he knew that Yang Kai had actually discovered a new race inside.

“Seniors shouldn’t look down on the Small Stone Race.” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Their intelligence might not be high and they might not be able to cultivate, but if we keep them inside our Small Universes, they are highly beneficial.”

Liu Mu immediately became interested, “What are the advantages?”

“They reproduce extremely quickly as long as enough resources are provided, and each one of them provides ten times the benefit of other living creatures to the Small Universe’s foundation.”

Everyone was stunned for a moment before they all gasped in shock. Even Da Yi looked at Yang Kai in surprise, clearly seeking confirmation.

Yang Kai affirmed, nodding, “This Junior’s Small Universe has many Small Stone Race members as well as many Humans, so the comparison is quite obvious.”

The look in Six Wood Divine Monarch’s eyes suddenly became hot, “Yang Boy, you see, when you were in danger in Black Territory, this Monarch was the first to rush to help you. So about this Small Stone Race…”

Yang Kai replied, “If Senior wishes, this Junior can naturally send some to Golden Antelope Paradise.”

“You don’t want money?” Liu Mu cautiously asked.

Back in Black Territory, Yang Kai had sold his Profound Yin Bamboo to the many High-Rank Open Heaven Masters, and his profiteering look had left a deep impression on him.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but break into laughter, “As long as Senior can afford it.”

Da Yi coughed lightly and stated, “My Great Battle Cave Heaven also wants a batch.”

“No problem, whichever Cave Heaven Paradise wants them, I’ll have someone take care of it when we return to the Star Boundary,” Yang Kai readily agreed, “But let me make one thing clear to all of you. Although the Small Stone Race’s reproduction rate is extremely fast, it is very dependent on cultivating materials. The more material one invests, the faster their reproduction rate will be.”

Liu Mu nodded his acknowledgement, “Naturally, there is nothing in life which is truly free.”

The battle on the plains was extremely intense. The two armies fought back and forth, but they were actually evenly matched. The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters felt their hearts ache, looking at so many Small Stone Race members dying every breath.

They didn’t take it seriously when they didn’t know that the Small Stone Race could bring them benefits, but now that they knew how amazing the Small Stone Race was, every death seemed like a terrible loss to them.

Liu Mu couldn’t help but want to forcefully collect a batch of them and raise them in their Small Universe.

Fortunately, he did not act impulsively.

When the battle between the two armies reached its climax, two more teams joined the battle from the rear of both sides.
