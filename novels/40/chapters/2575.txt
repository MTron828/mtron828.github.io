When the Monsters heard this, they all had strange expressions as they glanced at Yang Kai, thinking to themselves, [Small? What the heck? This guy is clearly huge! Is this Human blind?] There was also the Divine Binding Chain’s suppression involved. If it wasn’t for the Divine Binding Chain, this guy could become even larger and would likely wreck the palace.

Before the Monsters could finish thinking about this topic, they saw that Yang Kai had actually stepped forward and was striding with large steps, his eyes filled with a complex expression. It seemed as if his entire world only contained the big guy over there.

Xie Wu Wei was shocked as he shouted, “Be careful, Young Master Yang! This guy has a violent temperament and has incredible strength. Please stand back for the time being and allow this King to deal with him!”

He didn’t know what Yang Kai was trying to do, but he had personally experienced before just how difficult this big guy could be to deal with. Back when he was trying to make him submit, many of his subordinates had died, and even he had taken a blow that caused him to spit out lung-full of blood, nearly dying right there and then.

If it wasn’t for seeing that this big guy was incredibly strong and wanting to make it submit to him, Xie Wu Wei would have killed it long ago rather than trapping it here.

As a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Master, Yang Kai would likely suffer from approaching this big guy so recklessly, even if he was bound by the Divine Binding Chain.

Yang Kai ignored Xie Wu Wei of course and continued walking forward. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xie Wu Wei furrowed his brow and was about to step forward to stop him, but Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly flickered forward and blocked his way while reaching out with one hand to stop him.

“Girl, what do you mean by this!?” Xie Wu Wei had a dark expression as he looked at Zhang Ruo Xi. A trivial Third-Order Dao Source Realm dared to act like this to him? If it wasn’t for his Soul Brand being under Yang Kai’s control, he would have slapped her already.

Ruo Xi had no fear though as she calmly stated, “Since Sir is doing this, he must have a plan in mind. Monster King, you simply need to silently watch what happens.”

She also didn’t know what Yang Kai was doing or why he would suddenly step forward, but she trusted him blindly and would not allow anyone to disturb him.

Xie Wu Wei was furious. If only he wasn’t a Soul Slave now! His life and death were connected to Yang Kai’s life, why else would he possibly care if this Human brat lived or died?

Xie Wu Wei had an ugly expression as he stood where he was, secretly circulating his Monster Qi as he prepared to jump over to save Yang Kai at any moment. He also gestured to his subordinates so that they would immediately save him if they noticed anything going wrong.

The Monsters all felt rather nervous as they watched Yang Kai go up to the big guy.

[It’s not Xiao Xiao…]

The excitement in Yang Kai’s heart gradually faded as he looked at the fifteen-metre-tall stone giant before him, gradually realizing that this stone giant wasn’t Xiao Xiao, because he shared a Soul connection with Xiao Xiao. If this stone giant before him was Xiao Xiao, it would have been impossible for him to not sense that link.

More importantly, even though Yang Kai was quite close now, the stone giant was still roaring in fury, acting like it wanted to kill him. It was struggling madly, but it was bound in place by the Divine Binding Chain.

“Hou!” The stone giant roared as a fierce gust of wind blew to the extent Yang Kai’s face became distorted. Flying sand and rock shards flew everywhere in the palace, and the walls themselves rumbled, as if they would collapse at any moment.

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense and tried to communicate with the stone giant, but found that it was in such a state of fury that it completely ignored him.

Yang Kai was helpless to do anything else other than ask out loud, “Are you Xiao Xiao’s clansman?”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but think that it wasn’t a coincidence that he met a stone giant who was identical to Xiao Xiao after transforming. Perhaps there were more than just two Stone Puppets in this world apart from Xiao Xiao and his Embodiment. Perhaps there was a mysterious race of Stone Puppets in this world. Perhaps Xiao Xiao had sensed his own clan was here, which was why he had entered the Ancient Wild Lands!

Or, perhaps this Monster even knew who Xiao Xiao was.

“Hou…”

However, only an angry roar greeted him. The Monsters watching in the distance all felt really afraid as they thought, [This Human is quite bold! He’s so relaxed even when facing a stone giant that even Sir Monster King wasn’t an opponent for single combat.]

Without mentioning anything else, just Yang Kai’s courage alone was enough for the Monsters to respect him.

But, he still seemed to be rather idiotic, and the Monsters around wondered if Yang Kai would soon be flattened into a pancake.

“In that case, have you seen him before?” Yang Kai reached out and tapped the air to create Xiao Xiao’s image before him.

The image displayed quite clearly what Xiao Xiao had appeared like back when he separated from Yang Kai. Xiao Xiao had a foolish and honest appearance with spirited eyes. He was only half of an average Human’s height and there was obvious sharpness to his stone skin. It was as if he was wearing a layer of stone armour that appeared quite sturdy.

On top of that, Xiao Xiao was carrying a pitch-black stick on his shoulder. Xiao Xiao had one hand on the stick, and his other hand was on his forehead as he gazed off into the distance.

The roaring stone giant suddenly quieted down, the fury in its eyes receding as he stared blankly at the image in front of him before he glanced at Yang Kai again. Soon, a confused look appeared on his face.

Xiao Xiao was simply too attention-grabbing with his Heaven Shaking Pillar.

“You’ve seen him before, haven’t you?” Yang Kai was delighted when he observed the stone giant’s expression.

The stone giant remained silent for a while before it slowly nodded.

[As I thought!]

Yang Kai was overjoyed as he hurriedly asked, “Where is Xiao Xiao now? Is he alright?”

Yang Kai was really eager to find out how Xiao Xiao had been recently as he blamed himself deeply for separating from him back in the Starlight Corridor. While he found Liu Yan rather quickly, and even found Chi Yue and the others, who were now safely cultivating in the Thousand Leaves Sect, Yang Kai had still been unable to locate Xiao Xiao after all this time.

The Star Boundary was a dangerous place, and Yang Kai didn’t know how Xiao Xiao was currently doing. In fact, Yang Kai felt incredibly worried after hearing from Yin Le Sheng that Xiao Xiao had entered the Ancient Wild Lands.

How could Yang Kai not be overjoyed now that he suddenly had a clue to Xiao Xiao’s whereabouts?

Yang Kai only wished that he could enter this stone giant’s mind to directly find out about how Xiao Xiao had been doing recently.

The stone giant opened its mouth and said in a coarse and low voice, “Who are you to the little one?”

The stone giant didn’t pronounce its words very clearly, making it evident that it rarely spoke. Additionally, its voice was like thunder that caused the entire palace to rumble.

All the Monsters were stunned as they looked with stupefaction at the scene in front of them. All of them were howling in their hearts, [this big guy actually opened its mouth and spoke!?] They had all been thinking for all this time that this big guy didn’t have any sentience and was unable to communicate with intelligent living beings. Only now did they understand that rather than not having any sentience and being unable to communicate, it simply didn’t bother to talk to them.

Xie Wu Wei also had a strange expression as he was secretly astonished.

He could now tell that Yang Kai seemed to have a connection of some sort with this stone giant. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easy for him to calm down the stone giant’s rage and make it speak. Xie Wu Wei had spent such an effort leading his subordinates in trying to capture the stone giant, so was Yang Kai going to be angry at him…?

Xie Wu Wei felt really distasteful inside. If Yang Kai really got angry at him in front of so many of his subordinates, what was he going to do about his loss of face?

Xie Wu Wei even secretly wondered if he should have his subordinates leave right now so that he wouldn’t feel as awkward.

“Little one…” Yang Kai smiled because he realized that the stone giant was referring to Xiao Xiao, “The little one hatched with my Blood Essence. I also personally raised him.”

There wasn’t any need to explain anything else, as these two sentences were plenty.

The stone giant nodded in response as it spoke in its rumbling voice, “So, the Venerated One that Elder spoke of was you!”

“Elder…” Yang Kai arched his brow, not knowing who this Elder that had suddenly come up was. Still, he wasn’t in the mood to ask as he simply inquired, “Is Xiao Xiao doing well now? He hasn’t met with any danger over these years, has he?”

The stone giant answered, “Since you’re the Venerated One to the little one, you are a guest of my clan; I have no need to hide anything from you. The little one found our clan many years ago, and the clan also accepted him. He’s safe now.”

“You guys have your own clan?” Yang Kai was slightly surprised. Although he had already guessed at it previously, he still couldn’t help but be surprised now that it was confirmed. The Stone Puppet Clan was naturally impervious to weapons and possessed immense physical strength. Even one would be difficult to deal with if it was allowed to reach the peak, but if there was a big group of them…

It was likely that even a Divine Spirit would have to retreat before them.

The stone giant stated proudly, “Although we of the Stone Spirit Clan are low in number, we have not gone extent just yet. Honoured guest, why are you so surprised?”

[Stone Spirit Clan…]

Yang Kai was rendered somewhat speechless. It seemed that he had been incorrect to call them the Stone Puppet Clan before as they addressed themselves as the Stone Spirit Clan, but this was simply a matter of a name, which wouldn’t be any trouble for him to change to.

“Can you take me to see Xiao Xiao?” Yang Kai spoke up again with another question.

The stone giant fell silent for a moment after hearing this, and it was quite some time before it spoke, “You want to take the little one away? The little one is now a member of the clan, so it’s impossible for him to leave with you again. Our Stone Spirit Clan won’t be restricted by anyone. Anyone who has designs on our Stone Spirit Clan is an enemy.”

Yang Kai smiled, “I just want to go see him, not take him away.”

The stone giant swept its eyes over him for several glances before he nodded, “It seems you’re not lying…”

Yang Kai was astonished as he thought, [You can even tell if I’m lying or not?] Still, he didn’t have a good understanding of the Stone Spirit Clan, so he didn’t know if they had any special talents or Divine Abilities apart from refining ore.

“I can satisfy the honoured guest’s request, but currently…” The stone giant tugged on the chains binding its limbs as it spoke, which caused the chains to rattle. It was indicating to Yang Kai that it wasn’t even able to defend itself right now, so it was likely strong in will but weak in strength.

“That’s simple,” Yang Kai turned his head as he replied, “Monster King, please come over for a bit.”

Xie Wu Wei’s mouth twitched as he walked over somewhat unwillingly.

He had heard Yang Kai’s conversation with the stone giant quite clearly, so he knew what Yang Kai wanted him to do; however, he had finally managed to find an opportunity to capture this stone giant when it was alone to imprison it here. Xie Wu Wei had originally intended on making the stone giant submit and work for him, but never expected that Yang Kai would suddenly appear.

“Young Master Yang, what command do you have for me?” Xie Wu Wei walked over and spoke in a low voice, pretending not to know what Yang Kai wanted.

Yang Kai tilted his head, “Release him!”

“This…” Xie Wu Wei had a hesitant expression.

The stone giant was glaring angrily at him as if he had killed his father and stolen his wife. The stone giant seemed to be absolutely irreconcilable with him.

Xie Wu Wei had a bitter expression, “Young Master Yang, it’s not that this King is unwilling, but look at how he’s acting. If this King releases him, he is likely to immediately stir up trouble and ruin this land. If he starts causing a ruckus, my entire mountain will likely be flattened.”
