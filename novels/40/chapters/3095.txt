A blast of Qi slashed at Yang Kai’s chest with a loud boom.

Yan Qing didn’t even spare him a glance. Although he didn’t expend much energy when attacking him, he was a Third-Order Origin King after all. A person who didn’t exude any Qi at all would surely end up in a miserable state after getting hit by his strike.

The young man would be considered lucky if only his bones were broken. Most probably, he would simply explode into a cloud of blood mist.

In the next moment though, Yan Qing’s body shook, upon which he turned to look at the young man in disbelief. The young man simply lifted his hand and brushed the part on his chest where he was attacked, as though nothing had happened to him. Then, he put on a grin and approached Yan Qing.

[What!?] Yan Qing couldn’t believe his eyes. [Why is he still fine?]

In disbelief, he scanned Yang Kai with his Divine Sense and became certain that the latter had never cultivated before. [This guy is just like any ordinary person.]

With a frown, he pushed out a palm with 30% of his power in an attempt to probe the young man.

Nevertheless, the young man still didn’t evade the attack and let it hit his chest. His figure didn’t shake one bit, and he appeared totally at ease.

Yan Qing was flabbergasted, as he realized that he had gravely underestimated the young man. [He could parry two palms from me without using any Qi. Is he…]

“You’re a Body Tempering Master!”

There was a peculiar group of people in this world who cultivated their bodies instead of the internal Qi. It was rumoured that they could reach the summit of Martial Dao as well, upon which their bodies would become immortal and indestructible. No one could verify this statement because, compared to the orthodox method of cultivation, Body Tempering was too uncommon. It had been a long time since anyone tried to cultivate solely their body. They could only read about it from the historical records in ancient times.

[Is this young man He Yun Xiang’s backer?] Yan Qing couldn’t help but have this thought.

If this person really was a Body Tempering Master, then it would be difficult to deal with him. That was because Body Tempering Masters only cultivated their bodies, so their vitality was strong, and it was hard to kill them. Although this path was extremely difficult, one could obtain a horrifying power if one had succeeded. At the same cultivation realm, almost no one could be his equal.

Yan Qing quickly brought out his full strength as he sent out a third palm. He wanted to see just how strong this Body Tempering Master was.

The howling of wind could be heard as his Saint Qi converged into a swirl on his palm. As his terrifying aura spread across the hall, he pushed out his palm at the young man.

*Hong…*

The spark of energy caused the entire hall to shake. After that, a perceptible green palm illusion headed for Yang Kai’s chest.

Yan Qing widened his eyes in an attempt to see clearly what would happen to the young man.

Nevertheless, he was astounded by the outcome. The strike that he had used his full strength to deliver still couldn’t move the young man one bit. Not even a crease was formed on his clothes.

[I’m no match for him!]

In the blink of an eye, a person was standing right before him all of a sudden. The young man, who was tens of metres away from him earlier, seemed to have teleported and suddenly appeared before his eyes. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Duo!” Yan Qing reacted quickly. As he growled, a beam of green light shot out of his mouth and headed for Yang Kai’s eyes when the young man was unsuspecting. It was a palm length needle, which was an Origin King Grade High-Rank artifact. It was basically formless, so no one could have prepared to parry it.

Needle shaped artifacts were rare because they were hard to refine. Nevertheless, this one was extremely powerful, and it was one of Yan Qing’s most formidable trump cards.

However, this trump card didn’t provide him any sense of security. After he launched the attack, he immediately retreated in an attempt to widen the gap with the young man.

Then, he stopped moving abruptly, as his neck was suddenly clenched by a large hand, which caused him to suffocate. The moment his neck was constricted, his entire body turned limp, and the Saint Qi in his body no longer listened to his command.

With a clang, the long needle fell to the ground.

Yan Qing was gripped by fear, as he saw that this young man broke his trump card easily by blowing out some air.

[How is that possible? No! This must be a trick! An illusion! Hahaha!]

Just then, all the doors and windows were broken at the same time as more than a dozen people leapt into the hall.

Certainly, the Masters outside the hall could perceive the movements inside, which was why when they realized that the people in the hall had gotten into a scuffle, they immediately broke into the place. All of them exuded Origin King Realm auras.

The old man at the front had grey hair, but he still appeared very energetic. He was a Third-Order Origin King Realm Master whose aura was even stronger than that of Yan Qing. He was none other than the Yan Family’s Great Elder, Yan An!

He wielded the long sword in his hand as the tip of the blade swung from side to side. All of a sudden, the sword was thrust out, upon which countless sword waves condensed into a beam of light and shot towards Yang Kai’s back.

The attack was ferocious in every way. He had displayed his Sword Dao to its utmost, which caused the others to gasp in amazement. They were all immersed in his skills as though they had plunged into the boundless world of sword cultivation.

*Chi…* The long sword jabbed into the young man’s back and stuck out from his chest without any hindrance.

[Got him!] The feeling coming from the long sword made Yan An realize that his attack was successful. That was the unique feeling of a sword jabbing into a Human body. As the smell of blood permeated the place, those Yan Family’s Origin King Realm Masters at the scene were elated.

“Ah!” He Yun Xiang shrieked.

She had never expected that the invincible Yang Kai couldn’t even parry one strike from the Yan Family’s Great Elder. Certainly, she saw Yan An breaking into the place just now, but she had total confidence in Yang Kai, so she didn’t attempt to block the attack. Instead, she just stood to the side and watched the good show with a smile.

Then, she saw this unbelievable sight.

[What happened? How is that possible?] Earlier, Yang Kai had shown absolute power and defeated the Second Elder Yan Qing with ease. So, how did the Great Elder Yan An stab his sword into his back so easily? Even though he was facing away from the old man, he shouldn’t have made this kind of rookie mistake.

“Junior, you shouldn’t have been so presumptuous!” Yan An snorted as a cold aura radiated from his long sword and froze Yang Kai’s back. With the wound as the centre, a layer of frost spread across his entire body.

“Great Elder, you… *Pu…*!” Yan Qing’s flustered voice was then heard. He sounded despondent, and it seemed that he was puking blood when he was speaking.

Yan An raised his head and looked at Yan Qing, only to see the latter flashing an eerie grin at him.

With a frown, he thought, [What’s wrong with Second Elder? Why is he grinning at me like this?] While he was feeling doubtful, the familiar face in front of him contorted and turned into an unfamiliar young man’s face.

“What?” Yan An was flabbergasted.

If the person facing him was the young man, then who was it that he just stabbed his sword into?

He wouldn’t dare to keep thinking about it, as his forehead had been drenched in cold sweat. Upon a closer look, he felt his soul leaving his body. The man he had just stabbed his sword into was familiar to him in every way, including his figure, clothes, height and hair. The person was none other than the Second Elder!

[What happened? What is going on? My attack against the young man was successful, so how did the outcome change to this?] Despite the Great Elder’s powerful cultivation and calm temperament, he was still flustered at this moment.

“An illusion!” He Yun Xiang’s gaze brightened as she could finally set her mind at ease. [I knew he wouldn’t be killed so easily!]

Earlier, at that moment, all of them in the hall had been deceived by a powerful illusion technique as they mistook the Second Elder Yan Qing for Yang Kai. There were no traces of the young man using the technique, but he could draw all the Origin King Realm Masters at the scene into an illusory world without them realizing it, which went to show how horrifying his power was.

The golden glint on Yang Kai’s left eye subsided as his vibrant Spiritual Energy settled. Then, he tutted and mocked. “Great Elder, how did you have the heart to make a move on your fellow clansman like this? I wonder if there are any grudges between you two? Did he sleep with your woman? Or did he kill your father? I didn’t expect that you’d retaliate against him and attack him ruthlessly in this situation! I’d like to tell you that you’ve done a good job! As men, we should retaliate against our enemies in a straightforward manner. Great Elder, you’re a role model for all of us.”

“You…” Exasperated, Yan An pulled out his long sword.

*Pu…* Yan Qing spat blood again, which Yang Kai evaded with ease. The colour had been drained from his face. If he hadn’t known the Great Elder so well, he would have thought that the latter really had some grudges against him and took this opportunity to retaliate against him.

[I could forget the fact that you jabbed your sword into me, but why did you pull it out without informing me?] The excruciating pain was unbearable, and Yan Qing was almost frozen to death by the coldness. He knew that Yan An’s Mysterious Yin Algidity was extremely atrocious.

“I’ll kill you!” Yan An had gone mad with rage as he thrust his sword towards Yang Kai.

His reputation had been destroyed because of this young man in front of him. The fact that he had harmed his fellow clansmen was an unforgivable sin. From now onward, his reputation would be tarnished beyond redemption, and he would lose his right to keep the position as Great Elder. Most probably, he would have to retire and spend his remaining life in seclusion somewhere far from the centre of power.

Yan An had been in the Third-Order Origin King Realm for a long time, but faced with the old man’s furious attack, Yang Kai just put on a faint smile and reached out his hand.

*Chi…* The crisp metallic clanging sound resonated in the hall.

A basin of cold water seemed to have been poured down on Yan An at that moment, extinguishing all his fury and replacing it with fear and horror.

Upon a closer look, he could see that, while the young man was clenching Yan Qing’s neck, he also reached out his other hand and pinched the long sword slashed at him. The young man appeared nonchalant, as though he was pinching a falling leaf instead of an Origin King Grade artifact, which had been used to kill countless people.

Yan An was shaken to the core as his eyes were brimming with shock. He hurriedly tried to infuse his Saint Qi into the long sword and pressed forward instead of retreating.

With a sneer, Yang Kai flicked a finger on the long sword, which caused a clanging sound on the weapon.

Yan An’s heart froze as his sword almost flew out of his hand. He used all his energy to clench the hilt, but he couldn’t stop his sword from heading to the side.

*Chi…* The sound of a weapon piercing into a Human body could be heard. The long sword had penetrated Yan Qing’s chest and pierced into his heart.

“Uh…” Yan Qing widened his eyes as he let out a lethargic breath through his throat. With difficulty, he turned his head and stared fixedly at Yan An. Then, he opened his mouth and expended his last bit of energy to utter, “Damn you!”

After that, his head slumped to the side, and all his aura disappeared.

While all of them were dumbfounded, Yan An had lost his ability to think as his mind had turned blank, and his lips were trembling uncontrollably.
