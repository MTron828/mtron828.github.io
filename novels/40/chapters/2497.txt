Since he was at a point of no return, he decided to just go with it. Yang Kai gritted his teeth as he waved his hand and countless Source Crystals spilled out of his Space Ring, piling up around his body.

Immediately, he sat cross-legged, letting go of his body and mind, ignoring all the outside factors, and focused solely on the Heavenly Way fluctuations brought about by the dispute between the two Great Emperors.

No one had ever been promoted this way.

But Yang Kai had no choice.

However, he soon discovered that this might be an opportunity for him; every gesture, and even every line in their conversation brought out a trace of mystical power that coincided with the Heavenly Way.

He was absorbing the two Great Emperors’ insights on the Heavenly Way, using it as the cornerstone to pave his own Martial Dao.

The benefits were indescribable.

Yang Kai quickly forgot the condition of his surroundings and was completely immersed in his own enlightenment. The surrounding Source Crystals were turned into dust by a moment of violent tremor, releasing a pure and rich World Energy, slowly converging at the top of Yang Kai’s head, gradually forming a Heavenly Manifestation.

“Huh? There’s a little ant in here!”

Although the two Great Emperors were focused on their intense battle, given their cultivation level, their perceptions were extremely keen, so they sensed Yang Kai almost immediately. When Wu Kuang stole a glance at him in the midst of combat, his eyes glinted in disdain.

He really was not bothered by a trivial Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator’s presence.

Not to mention him in his peak, he could easily crush a Dao Source Realm Master like an ant even in his current state.

[How did this little brat follow this Old Master here?] Duan Hong Chen was slightly surprised.

This was the place where Wu Kuang was ‘buried’, feigning death. The entrance of the black hole was sealed by his own special restriction, and it would be impossible to even find the entrance, let alone enter this space.

Otherwise, it would not have taken so many openings of the Shattered Star Sea and tens of thousands of years for Duan Hong Chen to, only now, find this place.

He had always known that the Source Sea was where Wu Kuang was hidden, but had no clue of his specific location up until now, and he could only enter this place when the Source Sea underwent an abnormal change, forming a black hole that devoured a large amount of fallen cultivators.

It was mostly due to his understanding of Wu Kuang that he was able to break through the restriction.

An Emperor Realm Master couldn’t enter, and even a peak Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would be powerless in the face of that restriction.

So, how did this little brat enter? Was it possible that the restriction at the entrance was weakened after he entered and this boy took advantage of that?

Duan Hong Chen felt a little disgruntled about this. If he had known this could happen, he would have destroyed the entrance after entering.

He did not know that Yang Kai was able to enter here thanks to the jade slip left by Wu Meng Chuan. That jade slip was a key to go through the restriction safely into the black hole.

This was what Wu Kuang left for his descendants.

Everything that had happened was simply a coincidence.

Duan Hong Chen let out a sigh of relief as he only detected Yang Kai, while Mo Xiao Qi and Zhang Ruo Xi were nowhere to be seen. It would be troublesome if those two girls were here.

“How dare you get distracted when fighting this King!? Duan Hong Chen, you deserve to die today!” Wu Kuang shouted, clapping his hands together, and slamming them forward.

*Huhuhu… *

There was a strange sound, and a violent wind suddenly swept out of his palm, billowing towards Duan Hong Chen.

This was no ordinary gust, and instead seemed to contain the aura of Elemental Source Strength. It was extremely terrifying, as the Heavens and Earth collapsed and space shattered wherever it swept.

“Primordial Astral Wind!” Duan Hong Chen’s complexion changed drastically as he blurted out in shock, “You can still use the Primordial Astral Wind after having lost your body!?”

Wu Kuang laughed contemptuously, “Primordial Astral Wind is a type of Elemental Source Strength, it’s formless and invisible, and it’s also connected with the Soul of this King. Who told you that I wouldn’t be able to use it once I lost my body? Hahaha, since you dare to look down on this King, you will have to pay the price! Even if all that’s left of this King is bare bones, you will still need to submit to me!”

Saying so, the Primordial Astral Wind blew right in front of Duan Hong Chen, preparing to engulf him.

At the moment of crisis, the panic in Duan Hong Chen’s eyes vanished and was replaced with calm as he clenched his hands together in a firm seal and lifted his chest up high to growl, “Turn the ground into a prison!”

*Hualala… *

An emerald green light burst out suddenly, enveloping Duan Hong Chen. At the same time, the phantom of a humongous tree appeared, expanding from the Earth to the Heavens.

The emerald green tree phantom was exuding Elemental Source Strength similar to the Primordial Astral Wind.

*Hong Hong Hong… *

The Primordial Astral Wind rushed straight toward the enormous green tree, and the trunk swayed violently as the leaves rustled wildly, but Duan Hong Chen remained still and unharmed; Wu Kuang’s attack was completely resisted.

“Divine Tree Bai Yi!” Wu Kuang exclaimed in astonishment at the sight of the tree phantom, somewhat unable to believe his eyes. He gritted his teeth and roared, “Duan Hong Chen, how dare you play with this King?”

He thought Duan Hong Chen would not be able to resist his Primordial Astral Wind with the look of panic etched on his face, but how could he have known that Duan Hong Chen would summon the phantom of the Divine Tree Bai Yi at the last moment to completely counter the Primordial Astral Wind.

He was obviously mocking Wu Kuang just now, committing the unforgivable sin of allowing him to experience the huge letdown from joy to disappointment.

Duan Hong Chen pushed his Emperor Qi to expand the phantom Divine Tree Bai Yi, wiping the cold sweat on his forehead as he smiled in relief, “This Old Master was almost scared to death. Fortunately, this Old Master was prepared, otherwise, this Old Master would have failed miserably with such an easy task.”

“Bastard, how dare you slander this King as an easy task!? Duan Hong Chen, don’t get too arrogant! Doesn’t this Bai Yi Source Strength belong to that bastard Iron Blood? He has always regarded it as his most precious treasure, how could it be in your hands!?” Wu Kuang roared again and again, his eyes full of unwillingness. Suddenly his expression changed, and guessed, “Could it be… Iron Blood has fallen?”

Duan Hong Chen snorted coldly, “Although this Old Master also hopes that Iron Blood will die early, it’s disappointing that not only does that bastard not have any trace of getting old, he seems to be turning younger the longer he lives. I’m so envious of him. Recently, he seems to have taken a disciple and is now putting in all his effort to train her for whatever reason. Damn it, disciples are just a plaque to Masters, they always try to cheat us! Forget it! I’m starting to get teary-eyed!”

He might have thought of Wen Zi Shan as he said this with gnashed teeth.

“Since he is still alive, how was he willing to hand over the Divine Tree’s Source to you!?” Wu Kuang barked.

Duan Hong Chen grinned cunningly, “Because this Old Master told him that if he didn’t hand over the Divine Tree’s Source, this Old Master would gather hundreds of young and fit men to seduce his treasured apprentice! How could his disciple resist the temptation? So, he gave it obediently.”

Wu Kuang was dumbfounded, “The hell?”

Duan Hong Chen curled his lips, “You have no idea how much he cares about his treasured apprentice. That little girl seems to possess a Special Constitution and is the perfect candidate to inherit his mantle. This Old Master has met that little girl once. Young people nowadays really are different, she already has the vague demeanour of Iron Blood back then, just one punch from her is enough to kill anyone in the same realm! She punched this Old Master in the face before I left Iron Blood Fort, and even my forehead cracked, splashing blood everywhere!”

Wu Kuang cackled loudly, “You deserved it, no one in this world can be more shameless than you!”

“Many thanks!” Duan Hong Chen beamed.

“So what if you have the Divine Tree Source? You are not its true owner! How can you fight this King’s Primordial Astral Wind?” Wu Kuang pointed out.

“I had to give it a try. Do you think this Old Master should just wait to die?”

The exchange between the two was temperamental, jumping from chattering like old friends for a moment to treating each other like mortal enemies the next. If there were other audiences present, they would have been extremely confused.

At the same time, the two Elemental Source Strengths were constantly colliding in madness, breaking the space and filling the sky with the power of wind and wood. A terrifying scene.

The sweeping strength of the Primordial Astral Wind was extremely powerful. If an Emperor Realm Master was sucked into it, not even their bones would remain; but the phantom of the Divine Tree Bai Yi was incomparably firm and sturdy. Regardless of how the wind billowed from southeast to northwest, and its leaves rustled madly, it remained standing, closely protecting Duan Hong Chen. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Space itself within a hundred-kilometre radius warped as all the blood on the ground evaporated.

At this stage, it was a competition of who had a better control of their respective Elemental Source Strengths, and the result would not be visible in a short time. Both Wu Kuang and Duan Hong Chen were irrevocably committed to this battle.

Duan Hong Chen would definitely take the opportunity for a counterattack if Wu Kuang retrieved the Primordial Astral Wind, and with his current condition, Wu Kuang would not be able to resist the attack of Divine Tree’s Source at all.

The Primordial Astral Wind and the Divine Tree Source Strength were both precious treasures comparable to the Phoenix True Fire. Not only were they extremely rare and valuable, but they were also equally formidable.

Wu Kuang, who was still in a skeleton form at the moment, was particularly vulnerable to the Divine Tree Source though, and there would not be a chance for him to regain his physique once the power of Divine Tree Source Strength invaded his form.

He was not in a position to make a single mistake.

He finally dropped his initial dismissiveness to face the battle seriously.

Duan Hong Chen had waited for tens of thousands of years to defeat him, so how could he not be prepared? Every act Duan Hong Chen had performed since the beginning was deliberately targeting him.

The battle between the two Great Emperors was intense and fierce, so even though they were aware that Yang Kai was breaking through to the Emperor Realm some distance away, they ignored him and did not bother to suppress the aftermath of their attacks.

Wu Kuang did not care about Yang Kai’s life while Duan Hong Chen had no ability to care.

He knew that Yang Kai was a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, and would try to protect Yang Kai if he could, but he could not spare any attention on anything besides his battle with the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, Wu Kuang.
