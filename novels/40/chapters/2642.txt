“Space Principles! Someone actually used a Spatial Technique!” Someone suddenly bellowed. Even though the shout was not too loud, it echoed all over the wilderness clearly.

The faces of all the Emperor Realm Masters grew solemn hearing this.

The Dao of Space was an esoteric Dao that only a few could use even when considering the entire Star Boundary. It was rumoured that the man who was the most proficient in the Dao of Space was a Master from the Eastern Territory’s Spirit Beast Island.

But that man supposedly had a powerful Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation.

Now though, a mere First-Order Emperor actually used a Spatial Technique to such a skilful degree.

“I think that bell is the Mountains and Rivers Bell!” Another person recognized the bell.

“The Mountains and Rivers Bell? The relic of the Yuan Ding Great Emperor?”

“Yes, it was indeed the Mountains and Rivers Bell! I’ve long heard from my disciples that the Mountains and Rivers Bell appeared in the Shattered Star Sea, but at some point disappeared. Now, it seems like someone has refined the Mountains and River Bell and brought it out of the Shattered Star Sea.”

“Sii… He is proficient in The Dao of Space and managed to refine the Mountains and Rivers Bell… what a great fortune he has!”

“Who was that young man!?”

While everyone was still in doubt, Feng Xuan suddenly roared to the Heavens with an outraged face, “Yang Kai! This King swears he will kill you if it is the last thing he ever does!”

“Yang Kai!”

“Wasn’t that the name of the one the Seeking Passion Sect has been looking for?”

“It is said that he has a close relationship with Ice Heart Valley, and because of that, the Seeking Passion Sect sent troops to Ice Heart Valley to force information about him out of Bing Yun.”

“So, that little brat was Yang Kai!”

……

No matter whether Yang Kai was famous or not before today, he was destined to become famous after today, for he had killed a Seeking Passion Sect Elder and captured Nanmen Da Jun right in front of the Seeking Passion Sect’s Sect Master, Feng Xuan. Furthermore, he managed to make a successful retreat. No ordinary genius could accomplish the same feats Yang Kai had.

The hot news of Yang Kai wielding Space Principles and possessing the Mountains and Rivers Bells naturally spread out rapidly.

It was just a matter of time before the name of Yang Kai would be known throughout the entire Northern Territory.

Not everyone could master the Dao of Space as it depended on one’s natural talent for this Dao, nor would it be possible to comprehend it even if Yang Kai was captured and they tortured him for information; however, the Mountains and Rivers Bell was the titular artifact of the Yuan Ding Great Emperor, and rumour had it that it was an Ancient Exotic Artifact that was brought out from the Ancient Wild Lands, a treasure that all envied.

During the War of Great Emperors, even though he had to bear serious danger, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor still chose to kill Yuan Ding first because he was afraid of the Mountains and Rivers Bell in his hands.

This was a treasure that even the strongest Master in the history of the Star Boundary feared! If one could lay their hands on it, his or her strength would soar.

Yang Kai and Ji Yao teleported back to the borders of Ice Heart Valley.

After sensing a tremendous energy fluctuation, Zhang Sun Yin immediately rushed out and looked over at the direction of Ji Yao and Yang Kai nervously, “Senior Brother Yang, you’re injured!” She exclaimed as she saw blood at the corner of his mouth.

Yang Kai waved his hand lightly, “I’m fine!”

Zhang Sun Ying continued, “You two are finally back! Honoured Master has been worried about both of you these past few days. Honoured Master would have gone out to seek you two if she was not afraid that she would alarm the enemy.”

While speaking, Zhang Sun Ying suddenly glanced at Nanmen Da Jun who was being held captive by Yang Kai, asking, “Who is he?”

Ji Yao answered, “Nanmen Da Jun!”

Flabbergasted, Zhang Sun Ying jumped on with joy, “You succeeded!?”

She had no clue about what Yang Kai was doing outside for these past few days. It was only after Ji Yao departed that she found out Yang Kai was going to deal with Nanmen Da Jun, and now that the latter had been captured, there was no doubt that they had succeeded.

Yang Kai nodded, and pushed Nanmen Da Jun forward to her, “I’ll turn him over to you, it will be up to Senior Bing Yun to decide whether he lives or dies. I need to heal myself first.”

Then, he turned to Ji Yao, “Junior Sister Yao, come and find me tomorrow. I’ll need your help.”

Ji Yao nodded without asking any questions.

After that, Yang Kai disappeared.

Although his cultivation was sealed, Nanmen Da Jun still showed the demeanour of a Grandmaster without a single trace of panic on his face. He looked around and stated calmly, “So, this is Ice Heart Valley. This King has long wanted to visit this place, but I didn’t expect to come here with the identity of a prisoner.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhang Sun Ying and Ji Yao exchanged a look, the former stretching out her hand to gesture, “This way, Grandmaster Nanmen. I’ll take you to see our Honoured Master!”

Nanmen Da Jun smiled faintly, “En, lead the way!”

He looked calm and unaffected, which made many disciples of Ice Heart Valley see him in a new light. Although he was responsible for the dire situation of Ice Heart Valley, there was no real grudge between Nanmen Da Jun and Ice Heart Valley, he was simply working after receiving payment.

Since they had captured him, the crisis of Ice Heart Valley was resolved, and there was no point in harassing him.

Inside the room of the small courtyard, Yang Kai sat cross-legged and swallowed a few healing pills before quietly cultivating.

After a night of effort, Yang Kai had basically recovered and no longer showed any signs of injury.

The next morning, Yang Kai opened the door and left his room.

Ji Yao was already waiting outside.

Yang Kai requested as he glanced at her, “I want to see Senior Bing Yun.”

“Follow me!” Ji Yao answered. While leading the way, she took out her communication artifact and sent a message to Bing Yun.

Not long after, the two arrived at Bing Yun’s residence.

Needless to say, Bing Yun expressed her thanks to Yang Kai when they met. Without his help, they would never have been able to capture Nanmen Da Jun so easily.

Bing Yun’s cultivation was extraordinary, but some things just could not be achieved merely by strength.

“What are you going to do with Nanmen Da Jun?” Yang Kai asked.

Bing Yun replied, “We have made an agreement. In exchange for Ice Heart Valley guaranteeing his safety, he has agreed to never act against Ice Heart Valley again. Now, he is considered a guest, and I will send him away when the war is over.”

“Senior is kind-hearted,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

If it were him, he would certainly teach Nanmen Da Jun a painful lesson first. Even if he did not kill him, he would still torture him to relieve his anger.

Bing Yun smiled, “In the end, he is an Array Grandmaster of our era. Perhaps, Ice Heart Valley will have need of his services in the future, so it is better to build a good relationship with him. He was not targeting us intentionally in any case.”

Instead of continuing their discussion about Nanmen Da Jun, Yang Kai asked, “Has Senior prepared the things that I requested?”

After hearing this, Bing Yun tossed a Space Ring to him, “They are all inside. Check if it’s enough for you.”

Yang Kai caught it and nodded as he scanned it with his Divine Sense, “It’s enough.”

Puzzled, Bing Yun questioned, “What do you need so many Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades for? As far as I know, these materials can only be used to refine Space Rings. Do you know Artifact Refining as well?”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “I don’t know Artifact Refining, but other than refining Space Rings, these materials have another great use.”

With a single thought, a realization dawned on Bing Yun, “Space Arrays?”

“Exactly!” Yang Kai admitted with a nod, “I want to arrange a Space Array in Ice Heart Valley. I wonder if Senior has a suitable place in mind? It’s better to be a place well guarded and hidden.”

Bing Yun was confused, “Why go through all the trouble? Our Ice Heart Valley has a Space Array here, and can travel to most of the places in the Northern Territory. Although it has been sealed recently, it can still be opened.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have to personally arrange this Space Array.”

Seeing his insistence, Bing Yun pondered for a while before she continued, “How about the Ice Lake?”

Yang Kai raised his brow, “The place where Zi Yu was imprisoned before? It’s indeed a good choice.”

Bing Yun concluded, “Then that place it is.”

“But isn’t that a Restricted Area of Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai frowned.

Bing Yun smiled faintly, “It was a Restricted Area before, but since you took that bead out, it’s not a Restricted Area anymore.”

Yang Kai was stunned and he chuckled in embarrassment.

When he came to Ice Heart Valley a few years ago, he took the Bead of Winter from the aforementioned Restricted Area. It was because of this opportunity that he gathered all of the Four Seasons Beads, allowing him to comprehend the Time Flies Seal Divine Ability of Flowing Time Great Emperor in the Shattered Star Sea.

In the past, Ice Heart Valley had used the Bead of Winter to create a Restricted Area which was useful for both cultivation and imprisonment, but without the bead, the Restricted Area naturally collapsed.

“It is not a simple feat to arrange a Space Array. Yang Kai, are you proficient in arrays as well?” Again, Bing Yun questioned curiously.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I only know how to arrange this one type of array, and even that was taught to me by a Senior Expert due to some opportunities in the past.”

With these words, a woman in all black emerged in Yang Kai’s mind.

[Yang Yan… ]

Yang Kai had not seen her for a long time. All these years, Yang Kai had been wandering the Star Boundary, but he never heard of a great force that had a Master called Yang Yan, and there was no news of Lin Yun’er, who Yang Yan had taken away with her.

After shaking off these distracting thoughts, Yang Kai got up and announced, “I shall go and arrange the array without delay. Junior Sister Yao, please assist me.”

Bing Yun ordered, “Yao’er, go with Yang Kai. If he has any needs, try to meet them.”

“Yes!” Ji Yao received her order.

The two immediately walked out of the palace and headed to the Ice Lake Restricted Area of Ice Heart Valley. Soon, they arrived at the place.

When Yang Kai came here last time, it was dreadfully cold due to the presence of the Bead of Winter, but now it was no different from the other places in Ice Heart Valley.

The altar in the centre of the island in the middle of the lake was still there, where the Bead of Winter was originally placed.

Yang Kai scanned the island with his Divine Sense and carefully examined the surrounding terrain, “This place is good, I shall arrange it here,” he said with satisfaction.

He stretched his hand and waved, summoning out a pile of materials along with a large amount of Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jades.

Yang Kai had arranged this kind of Space Array many times before. Previously, when he was in Heng Luo Star Field, he had arranged enough Space Arrays to connect almost every major Cultivation Star, allowing free travel between them all in an instant.

Before Yang Kai set up those Space Arrays, it would take about several months to several years for a cultivator to travel from one Cultivation Star to the next closest Cultivation Star across the vast Heng Luo Star Field.

However, with Yang Kai’s help, one could instantly reach his or her destination through the Space Array network, greatly saving time and avoiding the perils of travelling through the Starry Sky.

It could be said that Yang Kai’s contribution to Heng Luo Star Field was unprecedented, unmatched in history by any other.

It had been a long time since he last set up a Space Array, so Yang Kai could not help feeling a bit out of practice at first; however, his foundation was still there, so after a moment of preparation, he began to work.
