Yang Kai glanced over at the hundred or so gathered before him and smiled, “Netherworld Sect is it… They seem to follow me no matter where I go.”

Among the hundred people, were about ten who had extremely dark and chilly auras, including the man surnamed Wu and the person who previously attacked Qi Hai. It was obvious that they had cultivated dark and evil Secret Arts.

These people’s auras gave Yang Kai a sensation that was identical to Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Cheng’s auras.

The identities of these ten or so people were thus quite obvious.

In the Eastern Territory, apart from those from the Netherworld Sect, there weren’t any other Sects that possessed such gloomy auras.

Apart from the ten or so people from the Netherworld Sect, the remaining people had varied cultivations. All of those who were looking at Qi Hai had expressions filled with concern, so they were obviously people from Qi Family Fort.

Soon, Yang Kai focused his attention on another old man as he furrowed his brow slightly, “Old Ban? Why are you here as well?”

This old man was Old Ban, the guide who previously took Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi into the Ancient Lands.

Old Ban could only smile bitterly when he heard Yang Kai’s question, “They wanted to enter the Ancient Lands… They are the knives, while I’m just the fish on a chopping block…”

His words clearly expressed the helplessness in his heart.

“Old thing, shut your mouth!” A Netherworld Sect disciple next to Old Ban immediately glared at him. Old Ban’s expression changed as he really didn’t dare to say anything more, but he still secretly sent Yang Kai a message saying, “Little Brother, hurry and leave. It seems these people are from the Netherworld Sect and came here just for you.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, right after he said that, the Netherworld Sect disciple who previously glared at him shouted, “This old thing even dares to secretly send him a message? You’re courting death!”

Right after he spoke, he immediately sent his palm slapping towards Old Ban.

Old Ban was only in the First-Order Dao Source Realm, so even though he did his best to act covertly, the movement of his Divine Sense was naturally not missed by the Netherworld Sect disciple who was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Seeing that Old Ban was refusing a toast, the Netherworld Sect disciple intended to make him drink a loss.

The person that the Vice Sect Master was looking for had already appeared of his own volition, so there was naturally no more need to enter the Ancient Lands. Since they weren’t going to enter the Ancient Lands anymore, they no longer needed someone to lead the way; therefore, it wouldn’t matter if he beat Old Ban to death.

The Netherworld Sect disciple’s palm showed absolutely no mercy, causing Old Ban’s face to completely pale as the wind from the attack approached.

Right as the palm was about to strike Old Ban though, another palm suddenly came out from the side and met the disciple’s palm at a strange angle.

“Who!?” The attacking Netherworld Sect disciple was astonished, but before he could even tell who had intercepted his attack, the two palms had already struck each other.

A torrential force with the power of a tidal wave crashed into the Netherworld Sect disciple. He felt as if this power smashed through his defences like they were dry weeds or rotting wood before directly invading and rampaging through his body.

*Pu…*

The Netherworld Sect disciple spat some blood as he flew out and rolled several times after falling to the ground.

When he got back up again and checked himself, his face immediately became ashen as he exclaimed in despair, “My meridians… My meridians have all been destroyed!”

He kept roaring hysterically as he raised his head. Only then did he see clearly that the person who attacked him was actually the person named Yang Kai, immediately gritting his teeth while shouting, “How can you be so vicious?!”

After Yang Kai saved Old Ban, he put the latter back down where he originally stood and glanced lightly at the Netherworld Sect disciple with a mocking grin, “It seems neither your family nor your Sect have taught you how to show proper respect to our Elders. Since you don’t even have such basic knowledge, destroying your meridians is a small form of punishment. Remember to respect your Elders in the future.”

The Netherworld Sect disciple was already in a state of despair, but after listening to Yang Kai’s preaching at him, he couldn’t help but spurt a mouthful of blood. He then turned to the man surnamed Wu and pleaded, “Sir Vice Sect Master, your disciple’s meridians have been destroyed! Sir, you have to enforce justice on behalf of this disciple!”

The man surnamed Wu coldly snorted, “You have brought disgrace to the Sect, scram now!”

The disciple was dumbfounded. He never expected Sir Vice Sect Master would actually be so unkind. Not only did he not help him, but even reprimanded him. He suddenly felt that there was no meaning in life. Infuriated and forlorn, his eyes rolled back as he fainted right away.

The man surnamed Wu coldly looked at Yang Kai and lightly snorted, “First-Order Emperor Realm, not bad.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile, unabashed, “Just so so…”

Afterwards, the smile on his face receded as he turned his head, looking coldly at Qi Hai, “Brother Qi Hai, you have let me down, this Young Master is saddened greatly by your conduct.”

Qi Hai became uneasy after hearing this, his face filled with shame and embarrassment, but he still grit his teeth and justified himself, “Brother Yang, had this Qi not been forced to, this Qi would not do something like this. It’s just that my wife’s life is at stake. Unfortunately, Brother Yan has the Phoenix True Fire but is unwilling to extend a helping hand, so this Qi can only depend on others.”

Yang Kai heaved a sigh and indifferently stated, “Brother Qi, this Young Master admires your feelings for your wife, unfortunately… even if you betray me, this Vice Sect Master doesn’t seem to appreciate your favour.”

Qi Hai’s face was immediately filled with bitterness.

Previously, the members of the Netherworld Sect came to the Qi Family Fort just because the Qi Family Fort was a local tyrant that was more familiar with the Ancient Lands than them. At that time, Qi Hai was angry that Yang Kai was being so stingy, not willing to extend a helping hand to him in his time of desperation, so he didn’t hesitate to agree to Vice Sect Master Wu’s request. He even brought several members of Qi Family Fort and prepared to enter the Ancient Lands to search for Yang Kai’s traces.

Only, Yang Kai had come out of the Ancient Lands before they could venture in and had a run-in with them, face to face.

“Where there is a will, there is a way,” Qi Hai grit his teeth and added, “This Qi believes that even rocks and metal would give in to sincerity. As long as Vice Sect Master Wu is willing to use the True Fire for this Qi once, this Qi is willing to pay any price.”

While speaking, he turned his head and looked at the man surnamed Wu, who had an indifferent look on his face, his expression basically showing no change whatsoever.

Yang Kai chuckled before agreeing, “Brother Qi is right, but… Didn’t Qi He Feng tell you that the Phoenix True Fire is no longer with me?”

Qi Hai rebuked with a forced smile, “Brother Yang, who would be willing to give something as precious as the Phoenix True Fire? This Qi had only asked for a small favour, something as simple as lifting your hand, but to me, was more important than my own life. Why are you making all sorts of excuses now?”

Yang Kai’s face turned colder, “Believe what you like, but I have already given away the Phoenix True Fire, and the one who received it is not with me any longer. Originally, I was still thinking of bringing that person to the Qi Family Fort after she returns because of the favour to me last time. In any case, it wouldn’t be much effort, but now… It seems the Young Fort Lady’s fate must be left to the Heavens to decide.”

Qi Hai’s face suddenly distorted as he asked in a trembling voice, “Brother Yang… The Phoenix True Fire is really not with you?”

Yang Kai made a cold snort, not bothering to answer his question. In truth, he didn’t have any friendship with Qi Hai, and it was already quite lucky of Qi Hai to have not been silenced by Yang Kai back in the Shattered Star Sea. This time, he actually let the word out that Yang Kai obtained the Phoenix True Fire, which made Yang Kai quite angry.

Seeing Yang Kai’s expression, Qi Hai suddenly realized that Yang Kai wasn’t lying; after all, Qi He Feng had already mentioned this to him when he had returned to the Qi Family Fort.

Now, when Yang Kai reiterated it again, he began to believe it a bit more.

In a flash, his heart was filled with remorse and fury. He felt as if a bitter gourd had been stuffed into his mouth and he dumbly stood in place, as if he had lost his soul.

“Are you Netherworld Sect’s Vice Sect Master?” Yang Kai turned his attention to the stalwart old man, frowning.

“Bold!” The old man who had attacked Qi Hai before angrily shouted, “Why are you still not on your knees after seeing Sir Vice Sect Master?”

Yang Kai sneered and retorted, “Who do you think you are to make this Young Master kneel before you?”

The old man wanted to say something but was stopped by the man surnamed Wu.

The man surnamed Wu, indifferently looking at Yang Kai and gave a nod of appreciation, “Mentality is good, cultivation is also good. Boy, this King wants to accept you into the Netherworld Sect, what do you think?”

“Ah!” The group of Netherworld Sect members looked shocked after hearing this. They had never expected their Vice Sect Master to think so highly of Yang Kai. The Netherworld Sect was a top Sect of the Eastern Territory, and its reputation was only below that of Serene Soul Palace. It wasn’t a place where just anyone could enter.

But since it was the Vice Sect Master, it was naturally not difficult for him to admit someone.

The Netherworld Sect disciple, who had fainted after Yang Kai had destroyed his meridians, happened to have woken up right then, and was completely shocked after hearing this, causing him to stare at Yang Kai with bulging eyes.

“You want me to join the Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh.

The man surnamed Wu nodded, “Yes, this King is the Netherworld Sect’s Vice Sect Master, Wu Yuan Zheng. As long as you agree, this King is willing to accept you into the Sect.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin while maintaining a calm and composed look, “This Young Master is… not interested in being a Netherworld Sect disciple.”

Wu Yuan Zheng proposed again, “What if this King offers you an Elder’s position?”

“What!?” The Netherworld Sect disciples reacted as if they were struck by lightning, paralyzing them on the spot.

As for the Netherworld Sect disciple whose meridians had been crippled, he coughed a mouthful of blood before fainting again.

He was expecting his Vice Sect Master to avenge him and kill Yang Kai, but he hadn’t expected for the things to proceed beyond his imagination. Not only did the Vice Sect Master not avenge him, he even wanted Yang Kai to join their Sect, going so far as to offer him an Elder’s position.

Once Yang Kai became a Netherworld Sect Elder, he would have no chance to avenge himself. He would have no choice but to let the matter of him being crippled remain unsettled.

“An Elder…” Yang Kai also stood there as dumb as wooden chicken, as if he couldn’t believe his ears. He looked at Ji Yao and asked, “Yao’er, your Master didn’t hear it wrong, did he?”

Jia Yao blankly replied, “Your Disciple also heard it.”

She couldn’t help but sneer. [Honoured Master is Ice Heart Valley’s Ancestral Founder, while Ice Heart Valley’s status is almost on par with the Netherworld Sect’s. What is this Wu Yuan Zheng thinking trying to ask Honoured Master to join the Netherworld Sect? Was his head kicked by a donkey? How laughable!]

Wu Yuan Zheng indifferently stated, “Of course, the premise is that you must hand over the Phoenix True Fire to this King. As long as you hand over the Phoenix True Fire, all the grievances between you and my Netherworld Sect will be written off. This King guarantees that you will be an Elder of the Sect as well. What do you think?”

Yang Kai put on an excited look, “That sounds very good.”

Wu Yuan Zheng slightly smiled and added, “This King’s Sect is among the top of the Eastern Territory’s forces, so even if you are just an Elder, such status isn’t inferior to the Sect Master of a second-class Sect. You are still young and have a bright future, so it’s not impossible to reach this King’s status in time.”
