Chapter 79 - The price for looking

The current Su Yan was only wearing her underwear. Thus her her jade white curvaceous backside, along with her perfectly rounded bottom, long and slender legs and her snow white skin, were all seen by Kai Yang.

Even though it was at night, Kai Yang still saw everything quite clearly.

That back was so perfectly curved, while her glossy shoulders emitted a scent of seduction. That exquisitely balanced waistline rested on a pair of perfectly round buttocks, not too big and not too small, the overall picture caused ones blood vessels to expand and ones heart rate to skyrocket. The underwear that clung to her bottom a bit obscenely, only served to make his heart pound even more fiercely.

Because her skin was so fair and white, and because her undergarments were both white in colour, it seemed as if her entire body was on display.

Maybe it was because she heard the movements behind her, she immediately used her hand to cover her chest and turned her body halfway towards the door. In her other hand was a white nightgown; it seemed that she was just in the middle of changing.

(TL: Nah genius, and does Su Yan love white or something?)

The two people’s gazes met in midair, Kai Yang looked startled but couldn’t help that his gaze travelled downwards to her white and full chest. Su Yan on the other hand, was quivering with anger and a flash of killing intent could be seen in her eyes

That was because she saw a pair of blood red eyes! These blood red eyes were like those of a hungry wolf, with hints of gluttony, unbridled as it swept its gaze across her irreproachably. Not only this, the male was breathing coarsely, like his ** was rising.

“Ka cha cha........” With Su Yan as the centre, a sheet of ice quickly spread across the room in all four directions. Her dark red lips pursed, coldness within her eyes.

Kai Yang finally realised something wasn’t right so he quickly turned his body around and sprinted away from the room with his top speed.

His speed was very fast and in three breaths time, he had already run out of the room. But before he could choose a clear direction to head in, from behind him he heard a loud cracking sound. A large hole had appeared in the middle of the house, a white figure flew out from within the hole. Reaching Kai Yang, he could could see traces of fury on that cold face.

Kai Yang immediately retreated a few steps and took up a defensive stance as he thought of a way to explain everything. But thinking it over, no matter what he said, it would make no difference.

Any girl who had her back seen like that, wouldn’t let the culprit off easily!

Su Yan had already dressed herself, while she stood there looking at Kai Yang frostily. Although she knew that Kai Yang probably didn’t do it on purpose, because he wouldn’t have known he would wake in Black Wind Trade, not to mention that he would be in the house opposite to her,she couldn’t forgive him.

You could only say it was a big misunderstanding! But even though it was just a misunderstanding, Su Yan couldn’t just let the matter slide like this!

She was waiting for an explanation, an explanation that would calm her fury.

Unfortunately, that male who was standing directly opposite to her, didn’t say a single word. His eyes were still that blood red colour and he let out a heavy aura of bloodthirstiness, without the slightest bit of cowardice or shame.

Good, then I don’t want your explanation, rather I only want to beat you up to relieve this lump in my throat!

An ice crystal slowly formed on Su Yan’s fingertips. Then she flung her fingertips forward and that ice crystal flew out towards Kai Yang.

As it flew out, I rapidly grew in size whilst also rotating at high speeds. By the time it reached Kai Yang, it was the size of the a wash basin.

Kai Yang didn’t dare to be negligent in the slightest. Activating his True Yang World Qi, his fist collided with the ice crystal.

His fist aching, the Yin attributed ice crystal and Yang attributed True Yang World Qi collided, cancelling each other out. When the punch connected with the wash basin sized ice crystal, it quickly shattered into pieces. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Sou, sou, sou.......the shattered ice crystal became sharp ice shards that bombard Kai Yang.

Kai Yang couldn’t react in time, so more than ten wounds appeared on his body, causing blood to flow freely. His already battered body, became even more battered and seemed on the verge of collapse.

Kai Yang yelled in a low voice and the golden skeleton once again showed its might. As the warm feeling spread, he felt his body’s strength slowly increase bit by bit.

Shock could be seen in Su Yan’s eyes. She thought that her move would be more than enough to knock Kai Yang unconscious, she never would have thought that her move would be countered.

Her body swaying, like an immortal fairy that descended amongst mortals, she flew towards Kai Yang. In an instant, she was at Kai Yang’s shoulder.

An ice-cold feeling immediately spread from his shoulder and he hurriedly retreated a few more steps. Turning to see it, Kai Yang narrowed his eyes as he saw a layer of ice on his shoulder, that was quickly forming ice crystals.

Without any hesitation, Kai Yang tore off the clothing around his shoulder and called out a drop of Yang Liquid to smear on his shoulder.

Hiss hiss......the ice hissed, Kia Yang’s shoulder burned like a burning piece of iron, momentarily becoming bright red. The coldness that had been spreading, was burned away by that Yang Liquid drop, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Su Yan became even more stunned, she had never imagined that Kai Yang would be about to use such freakish methods to to melt her ice qi. Frost appearing in her eyes, Su Yan called upon the Thousand Layered Snow Waves which swarmed around her, hiding her body within the layers of snow, as they rotated towards Kai Yang.

The Thousand Layered Snow Waves were not only majestic like a snowstorm but also extremely powerful, in an instant Kai Yang was swallowed up by the waves of snow.

The bone piercing cold, froze his heart. Even though he cultivated the True Yang Tactics, Kai Yang felt that he would soon freeze and become an ice sculpture.

He knew that this senior sister Su Yan was extremely angry, although there was no killing intent in her attacks, it was clear that she wanted to severely teach him a lesson.

However this situation gave Kai Yang an idea. Although his opponent was much higher levelled than him, and he couldn’t resist in the slightest, he could still use it to test his findings.

This opponent was a thousand times better than Su Mu.

Within the snowstorm, Su Yan continuously attacked and Kai Yang was completely unable to defend himself, groaning with each blow. A trail of blood leaked out from the corner of his mouth, while his body was shivering from the cold, bitterly fighting the invasion of the cold air.

In the midst of this predicament, Kai Yang’s thoughts became clearer and clearer and he actually gave up all forms of resistance and began to openly receive the entirety of Su Yan’s attacks.

“What’s the matter, what’s the matter?” The ruckus had woken several others, with the Second Elder Su Xuan Wu being the first to arrive at the scene, followed by Su Mu leading Li Yun Tian and the rest over.

Seeing the scene before them, the arriving people couldn’t help but unconsciously take a deep breath.

Snow was flying wildly all over the place, Kai Yang’s ** upper body was visible as he stood still with his eyes closed, he was currently enduring all of Su Yan’s attacks. His body looked like a very shredded rag sack, repeatedly being hit by Su Yan. As he was being hit, his body flew all over the place from the impacts, but never seemed to touch the ground.

“Hiss.......” Su Mu exhaled a breath of air, “How did senior brother Kai provoke elder sister?”

“It could be that senior sister is extracting revenge for the things that happened a few days ago.” Li Yun Tian suggested with great fear.

“It must be so, otherwise with senior sister’s temper, why would she beat senior brother Kai for no reason?”

“Our pitiful senior brother Kai. His injuries have yet to fully heal, yet he has already invited such a great calamity. Senior sister’s attack are too ruthless.”

All of the whisperings from the group of people were heard by Su Yan, they only served to anger her more. Today it was Kai Yang who had seen her body, causing her to act out. But from their mouths, it seemed like she was the villain with a small mind, extracting her revenge.

Su Yan’s hands became even more ruthless.

p.s. Sorry guys, my maths teacher is ruthless. I had another test today on parametrics.......so I spent the week studying, since we only learnt the topic this term. Plus I only slept 4 hours last night, zzzZZ. Hope you enjoyed the chapter and good night.
