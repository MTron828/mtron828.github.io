As everyone looked on, Yang Kai remained motionless, simply standing in place silently with his eyes closed.

However, a pure and rich Spiritual Energy overflowed from his body.

The strength of this Spiritual Energy caused everyone present to pale in shock.

Potent streams of Spiritual Energy penetrated The Void and seemed to extend outwards towards some unknown location.

Yang Kai had cultivated the Dao of Space for many years, and tearing space was always the best method to escape from a trapped space, but this method had not been suitable to use to leave Shadowed Soul Island, as this was an independent isolated world with its own World Principle barrier. Unable to locate Shadowed Star, even if Yang Kai could tear space, he could only move about inside Shadowed Soul Island, not leave it.

However, now that he had touched upon Shadowed Soul Island’s World Principles and could use his Saint Qi, along with his connection to Shadowed Star as its Star Master, it was not too difficult for Yang Kai to determine the location of Shadowed Star.

Sending his Divine Sense across The Void, it did not take long for Yang Kai to find the barrier which separated Shadowed Soul Island and Shadowed Star.

Suddenly opening his eyes, Yang Kai’s Space Force poured out madly as he stretched out his hands as grasped the space in front of him.

Like dragons going out to sea, Yang Kai’s hands sank directly into The Void under everyone’s rapt attention.

Exclamations resounded as thousands of cultivators widened their eyes and stared at this incredible scene. Seeing Yang Kai’s two arms suddenly disappear was a phenomenon beyond their level of understanding.

The next moment, Yang Kai suddenly let out a deep shout.

Spreading his arms apart rapidly, the space in front of him was ripped open like a piece of cloth, revealing a pitch-black crack.

This crack grew bigger and bigger, and from it, came a terrifying, chaotic aura, like the maw of an ancient beast that was trying to swallow this world whole!

Yang Kai took a deep breath and released his grip after the crack expanded to about thirty metres in length.

However, rich Space Force was still pouring out of Yang Kai’s body like a sharp spear, thrusting into the Void Crack and slowly forming a stable Void Corridor connecting Shadowed Soul Island and Shadowed Star.

Sha Hu was dumbfounded.

A month ago, Yang Kai said that he had found a way to leave this place, and although Sha Hu did not doubt him, he was still unclear how Yang Kai was planning to achieve this.

Only now did he understand what Yang Kai was relying on.

He had actually cultivated the extremely rare and esoteric Dao of Space, and was so proficient in it that not only could he tear space with his own strength, he could even construct a safe Void Corridor!

Even considering the entire Star Field, there was likely no one else who was capable of this. Sha Hu believed that even those legendary Origin King Realm masters could not do what Yang Kai had just done.

“How long are you planning on staying here? Weren’t you all eager to leave?”

Just as Sha Hu was lost in a daze, Yang Kai’s voice suddenly entered his ears, and after regaining his composure, he swiftly waved his hand and shouted, “Follow this old master!”

Saying so, he dove into the Void Corridor constructed by Yang Kai and was swallowed by darkness.

The disciples of Sea Temple followed closely behind, disappearing one by one.

Everyone from the Sea Clan hurriedly followed, with Qian Mo nodding slightly to Yang Kai as she passed by. The little dolphin flipped her tail and made a series of cries as she went through, seemingly telling him to quickly follow.

After the cultivators of Sea Temple and Sea God Palace disappeared, the other cultivators rushed forward.

The Void Crack torn by Yang Kai was thirty metres long, wide enough to accommodate many people walking side by side, so even if there were thousands of cultivators waiting, the exodus proceeded extremely quickly. In less than half a cup of tea’s time, Yang Kai was the only one left on Shadowed Soul Island.

Turning his head and looking around, after confirming that there were no more people living here, Yang Kai entered the Void Corridor.

This Void Corridor was constructed by him, so Yang Kai knew how to traverse it better than anyone, allowing him to swim through The Void in but a moment before a flash of light appeared before his eyes and he appeared somewhere above the sea.

As the unique smell of sea breeze blew across Yang Kai’s face, he heard countless cultivators crying out and shouting, all of them clearly excited to have finally left Shadowed Soul Island.

From the moment they fell onto Shadowed Soul Island, they thought they would never be able to come out and would be forced to spend their whole life under the grip of Ming Yue, but now, they had actually returned home to Shadowed Star.

So, after Yang Kai emerged, many cultivators turned looks of gratitude towards him.

Regardless of whether Yang Kai charged them a certain amount of compensation, it was a fact that they had escaped from Shadowed Soul Island. Everyone was thrilled for having been delivered from imprisonment.

“Yang Kai!” Sha Hu quickly flew over and was relieved to see that Yang Kai was safe.

Yang Kai nodded lightly before he turned his head and stretched out his hand towards the Void Crack behind him, causing it to close and soon disappear.

Without this Void Crack, no one but Yang Kai would be able to return to Shadowed Soul Island.

“Where is this place? Are we somewhere on the Limitless Ocean?” Yang Kai asked.

“Pang Zhen and the Sea Clan’s people have already gone to investigate, they should be back soon,” Sha Hu replied.

Yang Kai nodded and waited quietly.

After about an hour, Pang Zhen and Qian Mo returned with joyful looks upon their faces.

“Martial Uncle, this is indeed the Limitless Ocean! We’re ten thousand kilometres east of my Sea Temple’s headquarters, Black Reef Island!” Pang Zhen reported excitedly.

“That’s good news!” Sha Hu also showed a smile on his face, “It’s been three hundred years since this old master last saw home. Yang Kai, this old master offers his sincerest thanks.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “Old Sha is too polite. If you really want to thank me, you might as well promise me one thing.”

“Name it! As long as it doesn’t violate the principles of this old master’s ancestors, this old master can promise you anything,” Sha Hu declared boldly.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and said, “It’s nothing so serious, I just want to establish an exchange of materials between my High Heaven Sect and your Sea Temple; after all, the products produced inland and out at sea are vastly different. Last time I spoke to Island Master Pang about this, Sea Temple didn’t seem to be keen on my proposal and failed to respond to me.”

Pang Zhen’s expression became a little embarrassed.

“Then there’s nothing to think about, this old master can agree to this matter immediately; after all, an exchange of goods will benefit both of us. My Sea Temple will not refuse! When this old master returns to the headquarters, he will see to it!”

“Many thanks, Old Sha.” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Sha Hu was the former Second Temple Master of Sea Temple, and although he had disappeared for nearly three hundred years, his status and seniority remained unchanged. Since he had agreed, there would obviously be no problems with this matter.

“Sect Master Yang, I wonder if my Sea God Palace can participate in this matter as well?” Qian Mo suddenly asked with a smile from the side.

“Do you want to participate too?” Yang Kai looked at Qian Mo in amazement.

“Naturally. My Sea God Palace’s ability to collect deep-sea materials is even better than Sea Temple’s. Since Sect Master Yang is willing to form a trade relationship with Sea Temple, surely there is no reason for him to reject me Sea God Palace, right?”

“Of course I won’t refuse, my High Heaven Sect will gladly do business with General Qian Mo’s Sea God Palace,” Yang Kai laughed.

“Then it’s settled, it’s just that the inland and the Limitless Ocean are quite far apart, so the transportation of large quantities of materials may be troublesome...”

Sha Hu also nodded lightly, agreeing with Qian Mo’s statement. The reason why the deep sea and inland materials could not be exchanged on a large scale was primarily because of the distance between the two regions, a problem no cultivator on Shadowed Star had been able to solve up until now.

“There’s no need to worry about that, I will arrange a Space Array to connect High Heaven Sect with your two forces, then the distance between us won’t be a problem,” Yang Kai explained the solution he had come up with long ago.

Both Qian Mo and Sha Hu were stunned for a moment, but when they recalled the scene just now of Yang Kai tearing space, they believed he was capable of such a feat.

“In that case, this General will eagerly await Sect Master Yang’s arrival!” Qian Mo smiled.

“This old master will also be waiting to hear the good news!” Sha Hu added.

As they talked, many cultivators had already left this place. The people of Sea Temple and Sea God Palace had a brief discussion as well before bidding their farewells to Yang Kai and returning to their respective headquarters.

The little dolphin was reluctant to leave Yang Kai, however, and was unwilling to leave.

In the end, Yang Kai had to gift her a few bottles of Shadowed Heaven Pills to placate her.

After an hour, only the eight hundred or so cultivators who had yet to offer compensation to Yang Kai remained, all of them looking towards him, waiting for his orders.

“You can all travel to High Heaven Sect by yourselves. After you arrive there, someone will welcome and assign you some work. Those who need to contact your relatives or Sects can do so at will. As long as you deliver enough materials, this Sect Master will return your Soul Brands,” Yang Kai said.

“Many thanks, Sect Master Yang!” The hundreds of people cupped their fists one after another.

Yang Kai nodded but did not say anything more, his figure simply flickering as he disappeared.

Upon returning to Shadowed Star, he could once again mobilize the forces of the star as its Star Master. Every time he moved, Yang Kai could cross several tens of thousands of kilometres or even hundreds of thousands.

In less than half an hour, Yang Kai had already arrived outside the Flowing Flame Sand Field.

Looking at the familiar scene, Yang Kai smiled slightly. No matter how wondrous the outside world was, when the body and mind were exhausted, it was always best to return home!

Disappearing once more, Yang Kai re-appeared inside High Heaven Sect.

Without disturbing too many people, Yang Kai first visited his parents before he met with the Elders of High Heaven Sect to ask about the situation on Shadowed Star these past few months he had been missing.

Corpse Spirit Religion had basically been completely uprooted while all the surviving great forces of Shadowed Star’s inland were in a perpetual state of business. High Heaven Sect had become a true leader of Shadowed Star after this battle and was undoubtedly one of the most powerful Sects in existence, holding supreme prestige.

In fact, if Qian Tong of Shadow Moon Hall had not become an Origin King Realm master, this ‘one of’ could be removed.

Shadow Moon Hall, where an Origin King Realm assumed command, was indeed worthy of being on par with High Heaven Sect.

In addition, there were already many great forces and families on Shadowed Star who intended to ally with High Heaven Sect in hopes of following its lead. Ye Xi Yun had taken the liberty to agree to these requests entirely.

It could be said that the current High Heaven Sect had already surpassed the original Star Emperor Mountain, both in terms of strength and prestige.
