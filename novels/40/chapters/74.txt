Chapter 75-76 - All Hail Treasurer Meng

“That’s right then!” Su Xuan Wu laughed non stop, “In the duel between Wei Zhuan and Su Mu, why was he wearing a defensive artifact? Is this not breaking the Main Gate rules? How should we handle this?”

He didn’t ask about Kai Yang first, but went to rope in Wei Zhuan first, causing the Grand Elder to stare blankly at him, unable to respond.

“If Wei Zhuan really used his own skill to win against Su Mu, then it’s no wonder for Su Mu’s loss. But since Wei Zhuan was under the protection of his defensive artifact and used that protection to humiliate my grandson, First brother how can this be endured?” Su Xuan Wu bellowed out in fury as he slammed his palm down on the arm of his chair, turning it into smithereens.

Wei Xi Tong couldn’t help but lower himself: “Second brother, please quell your anger. Wei Zhuan’s defensive artifact was given to him by myself, but that was only because I wanted to make sure he would be safe. But he was like a child and actually used the artifact’s power to duel with others. This was Wei Zhuan’s fault.”

Right after this, an angry voice immediately sounded out: “Wei Zhuan, why haven’t you apologised and admitted your wrongdoings to your senior brother Su yet?”

Wei Zhuan was extremely clever and immediately cupped his hands towards Su Mu, saying: “Senior Su, this time it was this junior brother’s fault and he says his apologies to you. Senior brother, you are a great person with great forgiveness, so please don’t care about my wrongdoings!”

“Humph!” Su Mu overexaggerated his disregard.

But since things had reached this point, how could Su Xuan Wu say anything else?

The Grand Elder said: “Wei Zhuan was wrong, but Kai Yang committed a bigger violation of the rules. With a divine weapon in hand, he threatened to kill Wei Zhuan. If not for the Disciplinary Hall Disciples timely intervention, then I’m afraid that Wei Zhuan would have lost his life already. This was done with extremely evil intentions, so Kai Yang must be punished accordingly and used as an example to others.”

The Fourth Elder Zhou Fei and the Fifth Elder You Zi Zai both nodded their heads in agreement.

However the Second Elder laughed out coldly: “Wei Zhuan broke the rules and only needed to apologise to be forgiven, meanwhile Kai Yang needs to suffer the punishment? Could it be because Wei Zhuan is your grandson first brother, so he can have special privileges? If this is the case, then how would our great Elder Council have any reputation and prestige in Sky Tower?”

Wei Xi Tong’s face turned grim: “Second brother, your words are piercing. Kai Yang’s wrongdoings and Wei Zhuan’s wrongdoings cannot be put on the same level. Wei Zhuan only wore a defensive artifact to protect himself, not to hurt others. While Kai Yang’s weapon was used for attempted murder and could be used at anytime in the future, so second brother you should be able to see the differences!”

Su Xuan Wu replied: “I dare to ask first brother, who has seen Kai Yang with this so called treasure? If this weapon really existed, then why couldn’t the Disciplinary Hall Disciples confiscate it or find it on Kai Yang’s body? Old Four, did your Disciplinary Hall report of anything similar to that being found?”

The Disciplinary Hall came under the jurisdiction of the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei. When he was addressed, he merely shook his head and said: “Although it wasn’t found, under the eyes of the many disciples present, they all saw Kai Yang holding a blood red blade, this is the undeniable truth.”

Su Xuan Wu laughed coldly, and then using his World Qi, he formed a long and slender blade comprised completely of World Qi. Although it’s form flickered, you could still feel its power and majesty.

“If this was the case, then am I not also in possession of a weapon?” Su Xuan Wu laughed mockingly, looking at the three opposing people facing him.

“This is only the fine use of World Qi, how could it be considered as a weapon?” The Fifth Elder You Zi Zai shook his head faintly.

“Second brother means that Kai Yang who is only at the initial element third stage can already use his World Qi to this extent?” The Fourth Elder Zhou Fei looked at Su Xuan Wu with a smile, that was not a smile.

These words were such a joke. Because only when a martial practitioner reached the true element stage, and their World Qi became True Qi, were they able to form their Qi into a solid substance. While Kai Yang was only at the initial element third stage and the distance between it and the true element stage was like a thousand and eight hundred li. How could he have this ability?

“I didn’t say that his control over his World Qi had reached such a state, but have my fellow brothers forgotten martial skills can also make this possible?” Su Xuan Wu snorted out.

“Impossible. Even if he used such a peculiar martial skill, a mere initial element third stage martial practitioner cannot possibly destroy the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail.” Wei Xi Tong replied while repeatedly shaking his head.

“There is nothing impossible in this world. It can only be that my fellow brothers have been far too busy snatching power these past years that you simply cannot keep up with the times!”

These words were slightly unpleasant to hear, and Wei Xi Tong’s face immediately turned cold: “Second, are you really insisting on protecting that Kai Yang?”

“So what if I am!” Su Xuan Wu suddenly stood up, “These affairs this time, in simple terms, it is only a duel between the younger generations, but you insisted on causing such a fuss. Since you insist, then I shall humor your endless pestering. You either punish both Kai Yang and Wei Zhuan, because they have both broken the Main Gate rules, sparing neither. Or this matter will be considered settled and no one shall pursue this matter any further.”

“That cannot do!” Wei Xi Tong rebuked this proposal in one go, “If it is as you say, then Kai Yang really used a weapon to break the Embroidered Cloud Locking Mail. But at such a young age, he is already this ruthless, so in the future he will definitely stray off onto the wrong path. My Sky Tower Pavilion cannot have such people!”

“He is only at the initial element stage, how are you to know whether or not he will fall into depravity in the future? Could it be that first brother can foresee the future?”

“Second brother…….” Just as the Fourth Elder Zhou Fei was about to say something, he was cut short by a rage filled shout from Su Xuan Wu. Pointing his finger at Zhou Fei’s nose, he cursed him: “Old Four, before the Head went into seclusion, he left you in charge of the Disciplinary Hall. And in these past years, let’s see and what the Disciplinary Hall has done? Fair and just, when have they been so? If the Disciplinary Hall can only suppress disciples and enter a power struggle, then what use is it to you? Tomorrow I shall go to the Head and ask him to strip you of your Disciplinary Hall duties! What a show!”

The Fourth Elder cursed till his eyes started to twitch in fury, but he couldn’t refute anything he had said and could only feel wronged inside.

“Second brother, what if I am adamant about expelling Kai Yang from Sky Tower?” Wei Xi Tong asked, his face devoid of warmth.

“You dare!” Su Xuan Wu didn’t back down.

“Fine, then we shall follow those rules that the Head had set, and decide by vote. If the Grand Elder’s opinion wins, then second brother should have no objections right?”

“He he, raising your hand and voting?” Su Xuan Wu laughed loudly, “First brother, you don’t really think that I, Su Xuan Wu, am an idiot right? To vote by raising your hand, is there any need for it?”

“This isn’t good, that isn’t good, then what will satisfy you? Are you not even putting the Head’s rules in your eyes.” Through this quarrelling, Wei Xi Tong had also been angered.

From within the Elder Hall, smoke was rising, so much so that it was about burst out.

“Calm yourselves, all of you calm yourselves and come and drink a cup of tea. Everyone, cool your heads.” The Third Elder who had yet to say anything, finally intervened and advised them all to not act rashly.

The Third Elder was gentle in nature, and though he stood on the side of the Second Elder, he didn’t intervene in any of the disputes. Not to mention that his name is the exact same as his catchphrase, He Bei Shui, drink a cup of tea!

As soon as there was any friction between the Elders, he always mediated between them like this. It was just that the results weren’t very big.

“I won’t drink!” Both the First Elder and Second Elder bellowed out at the same time, looking at each other with distaste, refusing to comply with each other.

The Third Elder was left helpless and could only continue to enjoy it himself.

Justs as the Elders were arguing and causing a ruckus, a person’s voice sounded out from outside the door: “This disciple has some important information he needs to inform the Elders about!”

The Fourth Elder’s eyebrows immediately crinkled together and he promptly said: “Come in!”

While the Elders were discussing things, disciples didn’t dare disturb them. Since someone came to disturb them, it must be something important regarding Sky Tower.

When the Elders were informed of this, they momentarily stopped their quarrels.

When that disciple walked in, the Fourth Eler Zhou Fei asked: “What is the matter?”

“Reporting to the Elders, someone has forcibly charged into the Sky Tower Forest Prison and saved the ruckus causing Kai Yang, Li Yun Tian and the

“What?” The Fourth Elder immediately stood up on the spot, while the other Elders were also equally startled.

“Who is the one who is so daring, that they dared to charge into the Forest Prison to save them?”

That Sky Tower disciple didn’t dare to reply and could only lift up his head and stare timidly.

Su Xuan Wu’s heart thumped and he suddenly had a bad premonition.

From all of this, the Grand Elder could work out what had happened and he immediately calmed down before instructing the disciple: “You, speak.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“It’s…….it’s Su Yan, senior sister Su!”

Once those words were spoken, the Grand Elder’s smile expanded greatly. More importantly, even the Fourth Elder and Fifth Elder looked at Su Xuan Wu weirdly, while the Third Elder continued to drink his tea.

Su Xuan Wu’s expression changed non-stop, angered to point he couldn’t stop grinding his teeth together, he shouted: “Did you see clearly? That person who had charged into the Forest Prison really was Su Yan?”

That Disciplinary Disciple was so scared that he trembled non-stop, and replied at once: “This disciple saw it as clear as day. I clearly know of senior sister Su Yan’s name and fame and if the Second Elder doesn’t believe me, then you may make a trip to see for yourself!”

“No need.” Su Xuan Wu waved his hand and went on a spiritual journey. A short while later he had arrived at the Forest Prison and felt an ice cold chill. This type of chill, apart from Su Yan, no one else in the entire Sky Tower possessed it.

This girl really didn’t know of the severity of the situation, too reckless!

“Second brother, how would you view this situation?” The Grand Elder asked with an extremely large smile, holding his cup of tea as he waited for him to come back to his body. He was calm and unruffled as he asked.

At that moment, the Grand Elder was quite calm.

If both sides were refusing to allow each other to win, then this event would be the key allowing a side to win.

What type of place is the Forest Prison! That was the place where disciples who had committed wrongdoings were placed in Sky Tower! No matter if Kai Yang hadn’t committed any wrongdoings, if he was locked in there, until a proper resolution had been made, he could not leave.

But now it was great, Su Yan had stormed the place and forcibly tried to take him away. A spur of the moment decision, the result was that she had gone and broken a major rule in Sky Tower!

If this wasn’t properly taken care of, even Su Yan would have to be punished!

Wei Xi Tong knew that Su Xuan Wu definitely wouldn’t allow Su Yan to be roped in. Since this was the case, he must take a step back and give him face, but of course, that would be on the premise that he was allowed to deal with Kai Yang!

Now that you think about it, none of these five elders were related to Kai Yang in any other way. Up until today, the big fuss they had caused was only for their own personal gain, fighting over the leadership of Sky Tower.

Now the Grand Elder felt that he would win this battle.

If this affair were to be spread out, then all of the disciples would think that his faction would be the true decision making faction in Sky Tower. And then their goal would be achieved.

Su Xuan Wu’s face became ashen, and his expression struggled for quite a while, before saying in a resentful tone: “However first brother wants to deal with it, then you shall deal with it!”

Since Su Xuan Wu was forced to concede, how could he have the mind to quarrel with them further? In order for Su Yan not to be punished, then Kai Yang must be sacrificed.

Where the hills are green, there will be wood to burn. In the future, there will always be a chance to get revenge!

“Old ghost!” As soon as Su Mu heard those words, his eyes opened wide and looked at Su Xuan Wu in disbelief.

“What did you call me?” Su Xuan Wu flared up in anger like he was talking with his siblings.

“Grandpa! You can’t be like this!” Su Mu immediately corrected himself.

“You have no right to say anything regarding this matter!” Su Xuan Wu glared at him fiercely.

“Senior brother Kai has saved my life, you cannot not care about him. If you do not care about him, then that is being highly ungrateful!”

“You shut up!” All this speaking had caused Su Xuan Wu’s face to turn bright red, and although he was unwilling in a hundred different ways, he was under the knife and was fed this, what could he do?

With Su Mu chattering like an insect beside him, Su Xuan Wu’s hand lashed out in the air, immediately afterwards Su Mu froze like a statue, unable to move or speak only able to hear.

“Wait until we get home for me to deal with you!” Su Xuan Wu’s nostrils flared with heat and anger.

“He he!” The Grand Elder laughed with satisfaction, “Since second brother has no objections, then this shall be settled like this.”

Finishing, he looked at the disciple still standing there: “Send down this command, the Trial Disciple Kai Yang has repeatedly broken Main Gate rules, his actions ruthless thus the Disciplinary Hall will capture and imprison him in the Forest Prison until the Head returns to decide his punishment. As for Su Yan……..since she is young and ignorant, and this was also her first offense, we shall not take it too seriously. What do my fellow brothers think about it?”

How could the other Elders have any objections?

“Go then!” With a wave of his hand, a order tablet flew into that Disciplinary Hall disciples hands.

The Elder Command, seeing this tablet was equivalent to seeing the person himself! With this order tablet, Su Yan would no longer dare to act recklessly.

“Yes!” That Disciplinary Hall disciple received the order and swiftly walked out.

A short while later, from the direction of the door front came a bloodcurdling scream, and the sound of someone falling to the ground could be heard. The Elder’s faces changed significantly, and just as they were standing up to find out what happened, a person’s voice was heard.

“Fellow Elders have such power.” The voice rang out, while a thin, old man with wispy white hair walked inside. When he walked inside, he was also carrying the disciple who had just left, but he had been knocked unconscious, even the elders had been suppressed by this old man.

That man walked to the kneeling Wei Zhuan and Su Mu and casually lifted up one of his legs and kicked Wei Zhuan to the side: “Go go go, don’t block the way!”

Wei Zhuan’s body flew out, as he wailed miserably.

In the Elder Hall, all five Elder’s faces were changing non-stop and Wei Xi Tong narrowed his eyes and said to the person: “Treasurer Meng?”

The person who had just arrived, really was the Contribution Hall’s Meng Wu Ya!

Speaking of this person, all five Elders were confused.

Ten or so years back, this person had suddenly appeared in Sky Tower. They didn’t know what relationship he had with the Head, but with this he had started to reside in Sky Tower and was in charge of the Contribution Hall. Many times, they had tried to inquire about him from the Head, but each time they were left confused and without answer.

But all five Elders knew that this person was an expert! They also knew that he was below their Head.

Fortunately this person had no goal and only spent his days inside the Contribution Hall, knowing his place. Because of this, they didn’t pay much attention to him.

But today he had come uninvited to this place.

Wei Xi Tong had a faint feeling, that when he was facing this Treasurer Meng, the pressure he felt was stronger than what it was like when he was facing their Head.

In the midst of his smile, Wei Xi Tong began to speak: “May I ask as to why Treasurer Meng has come to my Elder Hall?”

Meng Wu Ya didn’t respond, he only smiled and looked at Su Xuan Wu. Su Xuan Wu was quite confused, thinking was it because his face had started to grow flowers, otherwise why would he be looking at him?

“You think that your decision is correct?” Meng Wu Ya suddenly questioned?

“What?” Su Xuan Wu stared blankly.

p.s. Phew, finally got this chapter out. I apologise for the lack of chapters last week, because as I have previously mentioned I had a test on the first Friday back, so I had to study and prep for it a bit.
