In other words, these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had been corroded by the Black Ink Strength, and they had no choice but to cut off parts of their Small Universes to protect themselves.

For the past 100 years, all of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises who had been assigned to Black Territory had been cultivating Profound Yin Bamboo in seclusion, and had gained extraordinary benefits.

The Profound Yin Bamboo was one of the Twelve Minor Universe Pillars and was extremely beneficial to High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, especially when it came to resisting Black Ink Strength.

However, even with the Profound Yin Bamboo protecting their Small Universes, these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were still unable to resist the invasion of the Black Ink Strength. It was a proof in itself of the Black Ink Royal Lord’s strength.

Fortunately, the situation still had not fully deteriorated. Many Eighth-Order Ancestors were still safe and sound. Surrounding themselves with World Force, and coupled with the protection of the Profound Yin Bamboo, there was no need to worry about being corrupted by the Black Ink Strength in short order.

Yang Kai withdrew his gaze and closed his eyes, focusing on recovering as soon as possible.

The battle that was supposed to end quickly was progressing in an unexpected direction. Who knows how many Masters would be dead after this battle ended?

Time slowly passed.

Yang Kai’s emotions had slowly calmed down. He was well aware that it was useless for him to be anxious in this situation. The most important thing right now was to quickly regain his strength.

Two days later, Yang Kai finally opened his eyes.

Lan You Ruo had been waiting for him all this while, and when Yang Kai opened his eyes, she turned around and asked, “Are you done?”

Yang Kai stood up, nodding, “Don’t stray too far from me!”

Lan You Ruo curled her lips up, “I should be the one saying that!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She was a Seventh-Order Master while Yang Kai was just a Sixth-Order Master. She should be the one protecting Yang Kai on the battlefield.

The two of them smiled at each other before rushing towards the battlefield.

After two days of fighting, the battlefield had become even more chaotic. Looking around, Yang Kai saw that the number of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had greatly decreased. A quick estimate put the losses at around 200.

Such casualties were really shocking.

On top of that, he also saw many High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters attacking their fellow disciples.

Obviously, these people had been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength!

In the face of the attacks by these Black Ink Disciples, the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who still retained their rationality had their hands and feet tied. That’s why, the entire battlefield was thrown into chaos even when the number of corrupted High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters was not too high.

Yang Kai’s timing was impeccable.

Liu Mu had sensed Yang Kai’s approaching even when he was far away. He was finally able to vent all the frustration he had accumulated over these two days and angrily launched a palm strike at a nearby corrupted disciple. The Black Ink Disciple didn’t even try to dodge his Ancestor’s attack and instead launched a suicide attack intent on perishing together with him.

Liu Mu cursed loudly, “Brat, you’ve got guts, I’ll give you that! You even dare to fight this Old Master!”

Having finished speaking, he slammed his palm onto the other party’s chest, releasing a burst of World Force, causing the Black Ink Disciple to freeze for a moment as if he had been struck by lightning.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Liu Mu formed a series of hand seals and slapped him several times, thoroughly imprisoning him. Afterwards, he grabbed the corrupted disciple and flew towards Yang Kai.

The two came face to face shortly after. Liu Mu didn’t say a word, he just threw the Black Ink Disciple to Yang Kai. Yang Kai was also prepared for this as a beam of purifying light shot towards the Black Ink Disciple the next moment.

A look of pain appeared on the Black Ink Disciple’s face, but it gradually eased up as the Black Ink Strength was expelled.

Just a moment later, the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who had been corrupted by the Black Ink Strength had regained his clarity of mind.

He had not forgotten what he had just done, so shame filled his face.

Right then, Liu Mu returned with another Black Ink Disciple in hand.

Seeing this, Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He wanted to participate in this great battle, so he rushed over in a hurry; after all, the purifying light he had mastered was the nemesis of the Black Ink Strength. Perhaps his participation would provide an edge to the Cave Heavens and Paradises, but by the looks of it, Liu Mu was treating him like a logistics doctor.

Yang Kai couldn’t even complain about it though as right now, he was the only one who was capable of dispelling the Black Ink Strength.

Liu Mu tossed the Black Ink Disciple to Yang Kai, removing the Black Ink Disciple’s restriction before shouting at the man, “Scram back and be careful, if you get corroded by the Black Ink Strength, hurry up and seek out Yang Boy!”

“Yes!” The Black Ink Disciple, who was the first to be rescued, accepted the order, and rushed back to the battlefield.

“I’ll leave him to you!” Liu Mu nodded to Yang Kai before returning to the battlefield.

One Black Ink Disciple after another was sent to Yang Kai to be purified. Many of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters corrupted by the Black Ink Strength, who still retained a certain amount of sanity, also rushed over and sought Yang Kai’s assistance on their own.

The light of purification kept shining as the Black Ink Strength was constantly being dispelled. For a moment, Yang Kai had his hands full.

During the purification process, Yang Kai didn’t relax his vigilance. Whether or not these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had been corroded by the Black Ink Strength and had been turned into Black Ink Disciples through and through, it was impossible to tell from their appearances alone. The more Black Ink Disciples there were, the more there were chances of a few of them hiding themselves to launch sneak attacks.

Therefore, when Yang Kai was purifying a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master of the Black Ink Strength, and a Black Ink Disciple suddenly struck out and attacked him, he wasn’t surprised at all.

He had no idea which Cave Heaven or Paradise this Seventh-Order Master belonged to, but his strength was quite extraordinary. He unleashed a powerful Divine Ability as soon as he made a move.

Yang Kai instantly summoned his Azure Dragon Spear and thrust it forward.

A blast of World Force swept out as Yang Kai’s spear stabbed into his opponent’s shoulder, but this Black Ink Disciple didn’t care at all, as if all that mattered to him was killing Yang Kai.

Lan You Ruo had been standing guard by Yang Kai’s side, protecting him against every High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who had come on their own for help.

At the same time Yang Kai was attacked, she also attacked, her slender jade palm containing a massive amount of energy ruthlessly striking the Black Ink Disciple’s body.

The Black Ink Disciple was sent flying by their combined attack and Yang Kai promptly retreated.

At the same time, a streak of light came zooming towards them from nearby. It was none other than Six Wood Divine Monarch. Liu Mu’s brow twitched hard at the sight of this and he furiously roared, “Brat, you dare!”

The Black Ink Disciple, who had just sneak attacked Yang Kai, probably knew that he lost his chance and could not do anything further. As such, he self-destructed without a moment of hesitation. Furthermore, his Small Universe burst open after his death under his plan, filling the entire void with a pitch-black energy.

Liu Mu quickly stopped and stared at the Small Universe that was filled with Black Ink Strength.

Although he was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and had the Profound Yin Bamboo protecting his Small Universe, he did not want to be corrupted by this strange energy either.

The thing that put him at ease a little was that Yang Kai and Lan You Ruo made their way out of the Small Universe shortly after.

They were surrounded by the purifying light, which prevented them from being corroded by the Black Ink Strength.

*Hong hong hong…*

Suddenly, a series of deafening explosions sounded. Liu Mu promptly turned his head as a solemn look filled his face.

Originally, a dozen or so Black Ink Disciples were still left on the battlefield, but at this moment, these Black Ink Disciples simultaneously self-destructed, shattering their Small Universes and turning the entire battlefield chaotic and filling it with countless Shattered Spirit Provinces. More importantly, each of these Spirit Provinces had a thick layer of Black Ink Strength surrounding them.

At the same time, their Small Universe’s World Force was swallowed by the Black Ink Master after their deaths.

Liu Mu handed over the last Black Ink Disciple he had captured to Yang Kai. He seemed to have aged several hundred years in an instant after seeing the death of so many Masters.

Since this battle started, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had lost somewhere between two to three hundred cultivators, all of whom were Seventh-Order Masters. All of the Cave Heavens and Paradises had suffered heavy casualties.

Although they had also caused quite a bit of damage to the Black Ink Master, they would have to pay a great price if they wanted to kill her.

However, this was the Cave Heavens and Paradises’ responsibility since ancient times. When the vast universe faced a crisis, everyone could choose to escape from it, but they had to face it head-on.

Their great and indomitable status means that they shouldered an equally heavy responsibility to the ordinary people.

When the entire Black Territory was completely sealed off, the Eighth-Order Ancestors of the Cave Heavens and Paradises had already decided that they would eliminate the Black Ink Master even if it cost all of their lives.

“It’s your turn!” Liu Mu turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, purifying the Black Ink Strength from the last Black Ink Disciple’s body, “I shall fulfill my duty!”

The cruel battlefield caused Yang Kai’s heart to tremble. Only now did he truly understand how strong the Black Ink Royal Lord was. The reason he managed to come out alive after being trapped in that cage for 100 years with her was completely due to the Super Array restricting her strength.

She might not be at her peak due to having been imprisoned for countless years, yet she was able to slaughter so many people even after having been surrounded by over 1,000 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. Yang Kai couldn’t even imagine what would have happened if she was able to regain her full power.

While remaining vigilant, Yang Kai also yearned greatly for the legendary Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm was comparable to the Black Ink Royal Lord!

“Follow me closely!” Liu Mu shouted and took the lead to rush towards the battlefield.

Yang Kai and Lan You Ruo followed close behind.

Yang Kai was unable to see the entire battlefield clearly from this distance, so only when he stepped onto it did he understand the murderous intent lingering in the air.

An enormous spider web had appeared in the vast void at some point, covering a radius of 10,000 kilometers. At the center of this spiderweb was the territory of the Black Ink Master. Every thread of this spiderweb was created from a thick Black Ink Strength. When the Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises entered this net, all of them were like insects trapped in the web, at the risk of being eaten by the spider at any moment.

This was the home field for the Black Ink Master, and she had everyone’s life and death in her hand within this web.

The strands of webbing formed from the Black Ink Strength were like living creatures, occasionally bouncing, and cutting, injuring those who got too close.

Yang Kai finally understood what had happened in the last two days. Many of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had no experience fighting against the Black Ink Clan, so they were completely caught off guard by the sudden appearance of this spiderweb. When the spiderweb cut towards them, more than a dozen High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had lost their lives on the spot.

As for those who were injured by the spider web, their wounds were corroded with the Black Ink Strength. So, even if all of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had the Profound Yin Bamboo protecting their Small Universes, they still couldn’t avoid the fate of being turned into Black Ink Disciples.

The Profound Yin Bamboo could help them resist the power of the Black Ink Strength better, but it was unable to completely repel it like the World Spring. At most, it could delay the inevitable of being corrupted by the Black Ink Strength.

Far fewer dazzling Divine Abilities or Secret Techniques were being used as all the Masters were trying to get in close to the Black Ink Master to bypass her outer defenses, but every time they did, they were blocked by the threads.

Only a small number of people were able to reach the Black Ink Master and confront her directly.
