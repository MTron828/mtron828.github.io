At the hall in the centre of the tree cave, Yi Quan invited Yang Kai to take a seat.

Yi Quan was very enthusiastic and Yang Kai did not stand on ceremony either. Even though there was such a large gap between their cultivations, Yi Quan had never been the type to care about petty things, so he did not mind.

Then, he pulled out a jar of wine like it was a magic trick as well as two cups, pouring one for Yang Kai and himself.

“Is this the Monkey God Wine that Senior mentioned before?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, taking a deep breath to feel the wonderful aroma washing over him. The fragrance of wine that permeated through the air also seemed to have a great effect on his Soul. It actually made him feel incredibly good when the aroma blended into his body.

“It is indeed!” Yi Quan smiled and picked up the cup in front of him, taking a sip before saying proudly, “The things we produce here are very different from those on your side, but they have their own special characteristics. The Spirit Monkeys in my Heavenly Monster Mountain spent a great deal of time and effort to brew this Monkey God Wine, it is very beneficial to one’s Soul.”

“The glass is not full, Senior...” Yang Kai looked at Yi Quan a little apologetically as he motioned to the cup in front of him.

That is because Yi Quan only gave him half a cup when he poured the wine.

“Haha!” Yi Quan laughed as he looked at Yang Kai. He said, “Speak after you drink this half-cup. If you can drink more, then this King will not be stingy.”

When he heard this, Yang Kai understood immediately that this Monkey God Wine was probably going to be strong, not something an ordinary cultivator could withstand. In Yi Quan’s opinion, as a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, Yang Kai should only be able to handle half a cup.

When he thought of this, Yang Kai did not say anything more. Picking up the cup in front of him, he began to drink slowly.

The Spirit Wine was sweet as dew, yet it rushed to his head like ice when he swallowed it down. A cold feeling gushed up from his throat to the top of his head, and Yang Kai could not help but shake spiritedly. Yet, when the wine entered his belly, it brought about a burning force that travelled through his limbs and bones.

Even after it circulated through his body a few more times, the wine continued going strong.

Yang Kai muffled a soft grunt and felt the changes inside himself carefully.

He discovered that his Soul Avatar, which had sustained some damage from his earlier fight with Ban Qing, was restoring itself at a speed visible to the naked eye.

This discovery lifted Yang Kai’s spirits, and he drank the rest in a large gulp without hesitation.

“Slow down!” Seeing this, Yi Quen quickly shouted lest Yang Kai drink too fast out of greed and cause some harm to himself.

But before he finished speaking, Yang Kai had already put his cup down and did not say anything, just sitting in place, his eyes closed as a look of reminiscence appeared on his face.

“Ai...” Yi Quan sighed and said to himself, “I still wanted to talk to you more about the outside world, but it looks like I’ll have to wait a few days.”

He figured that with Yang Kai’s meagre cultivation, downing half a cup of Monkey God Wine would knock him out for at least a couple of days before he sobered up, which made him laugh bitterly. He had taken out the Monkey God Wine with good intentions because he could see that Yang Kai had been in a big fight and his Soul Avatar had some slight damage to it, but he didn’t want to miss this opportunity to talk either.

“What does Senior wish to talk about?” Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes and the light in them was perfectly clear, without the slightest hint of looking drunk.

“Huh?” Yi Quan was stunned, looking strangely at Yang Kai as he asked suspiciously, “You’re fine?”

“Do I not look fine, Senior?” Yang Kai smiled. While speaking, he had already reached out without any trace of politeness and grabbed the jar of Monkey God Wine in front of Yi Quan, poured himself a full cup, and drained it down while praising, “Good wine!”

With one and a half cups in his belly, his Soul Avatar had already recovered completely. Not only that, but his Soul had also been tempered thoroughly. As for the excess energy contained in the Monkey God Wine, it all poured into the Seven-Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.

Just as it absorbed the precious Soul Jade, the Soul Warming Lotus absorbed the energy contained in the Monkey God Wine and fed it back to Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar in a temperate manner so that he could continue to benefit from it.

“This...” Yi Quan was completely dumbfounded and was staring at him slack-jawed.

At his level of power, few things could surprise him, but Yang Kai’s actions still left him puzzled. He could not understand how Yang Kai did not get drunk.

After all, even Wen Zi Shan who came here for the first time did not dare to drink the fine wine of the Heavenly Monster Mountain in this way. No one could withstand such wanton consumption, but Yang Kai had done so and appeared as if nothing had happened.

“It seems like... you really are different from the rest!” Yi Quan quickly understood and smiled, “I don’t think all the people from the outside are like you, right?”

“Naturally not,” Yang Kai laughed, “Junior is...” He hesitated for a moment, not knowing how he should explain it, only able to say after a while, “I have my own tricks to digest it.”

Yi Quan nodded and did not continue questioning him. Just as he was about to open his mouth to speak, he saw Yang Kai grabbing the jar with both hands, “Junior gives his thanks to Senior for this gift!”

As soon as he said that, he had already begun drinking from the bottle in large gulps.

Watching him chug down the wine, Yi Quan could not help his mouth from twitching.

In a dozen breaths, Yang Kai had already finished the bottle of Monkey God Wine without leaving a single drop behind. Wiping his mouth impatiently and looking eagerly at Yi Quan, he then asked, “This wine... Is there any more of it?”

“You still want more?” Yi Quan glared at him and said, “You little brat, what do you take this for? Each bottle of Monkey God Wine takes the entire Spirit Monkey clan a hundred years of work to brew! What you’ve drunk already cost them a hundred years of effort!”

Even the good-tempered Yi Quan was angered by Yang Kai’s shameless demands.

If he had known this was the case, then why would he have brought out such a treasure to entertain Yang Kai? He was simply turning blue with regret in his guts.

“Ahem...” Yang Kai lightly coughed. With a bit of alcohol still in his system, he said, “Senior is such a great man, there’s no need to be so stingy...”

He only dared to speak such words since he saw that Yi Quan did not hold any malice towards himself. Otherwise, speaking to any other peak Twelfth-Order Master would have gotten him into deep trouble.

“Stingy...” Yi Quan’s eyes almost popped out as he fell speechless. After pondering for a moment though, he grinned and said, “Good, if you can tell me more about the outside world, then this King will reward you with another bottle. How about it?”

“Truly? You mean what you say, Senior?” Yang Kai was instantly energized and asked, “May I ask what Senior would like to hear about?”

“Anything!” Yi Quan was not too demanding, “The last time Wen Zi Shan was here, he told this King a bit about the outside world, but unfortunately that guy had gotten drunk and yammered on like a madman. It was unbearable!”

“Then let’s start with Temple Master Wen...” Yang Kai smiled and lightly coughed, assuming the manner of a storyteller as he began to regale Yi Quan with stories.

The Star Boundary was vast, and it had not been long since Yang Kai arrived there as well, so he didn’t know too much, not even knowing the names of all Ten Great Emperors yet, but even so, the information he had was still beyond Yi Quan’s reach.

And, as Yi Quan was keen to know this information from the outside world, he naturally listened in with great interest.

Azure Sun Temple, Heavenly Martial Holy land, Orthodoxy Temple, Star Soul Palace, and even the entire Southern Territory, Yang Kai told him all he knew.

The people, the places, all sorts of strange stories, the Sealed Worlds used for tempering oneself, both big and small, as well as the ancient legends passed down through word of mouth. There was no order to what he spoke of as Yang Kai basically just rambled on about whatever came to mind.

Yi Quan just listened quietly, only interrupting him at special times to ask a few questions before gesturing for him to go on.

Everything about the outside world seemed to make the Lord of Heavenly Monster Mountain curious and eager.

The wonders of a body of flesh, the mysteries of all sorts of Secret Techniques and Artifacts, these were all new and fresh to beings of this world who had no idea what such sensations would be like.

Like that, their conversation lasted a whole day and night.

Yang Kai’s mouth was dry from all the talking, so he naturally sought an opportunity to ask for another bottle of Monkey God Wine from Yi Quan to moisten his throat.

Yi Quan was also listening with great attention and all the information that he had never been exposed to before fascinated him.

The Divine Ascension Mirror World was too small, so the world outside was undoubtedly more exciting.

Moreover, Yi Qian was already a master at the peak of the Twelfth-Order. Beyond that was the realm of Great Emperors.

Such a height could not be reached through hard work alone, it also required incredible opportunities.

When trying to reach such a height, anything new you could see and experience may become a critical breakthrough point.

The opportunities that Yi Quan needed were not available in this world, but they might be present in the outside world, so he was incredibly interested in travelling there. Perhaps, in a world that he had never seen before, he may be able to find his path towards becoming a Great Emperor! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Unfortunately, he was only a Soul without a physical body, so there was no way he could survive for long in the outside world. Once he left this place, he would be rejected by the outside World Principles and quickly die.

“When Wen Zi Shan came here, he told this King that if he could create a body that could integrate perfectly with this King’s Soul, then this King may have a chance to escape from this prison. This King wonders how much you know about this?” At a certain moment, Yi Quan suddenly interrupted Yang Kai and asked.

“The Flesh Incarnation Pill?” Yang Kai raised his brows and casually answered.

“What is this ‘Flesh Incarnation Pill’?” Yi Quan’s eyes suddenly lit up and he hurried to ask.

“Uh...” Yang Kai thought for a moment and continued, “It is a type of Spirit Pill. Due to the special situation here, Spirit Pills do not seem to exist.”

“And what are Spirit Pills exactly?” Yi Quan was completely baffled.

“Let’s put it this way. There is a special group of people called Alchemists in the outside world who use special tools and techniques to fuse certain types of herbs, removing their impurities, and enhancing their essences before condensing the latter into pills. These pills are called Spirit Pills and they generally have far stronger effects than their raw materials.”

“Then is the Flesh Incarnation Pill a type of Spirit Pill?” Yi Quan asked with glowing eyes.

“That’s right. Supposedly, if a being like Senior were to ingest it, then Senior could grow a body for yourself.”

“Supposedly?” Yi Quan raised a brow.

Yang Kai laughed. “Because this Spirit Pill is only rumoured to exist. No one has ever made it.”
