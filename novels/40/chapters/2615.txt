After Yin Le Sheng took on such a powerful opponent, his death was not the biggest deal, though it was still saddening. However, in this case it was his own fault for being imperceptive, and he had also cost the Netherworld Sect two Emperor Realm Elders and a Vice Sect Master.

This time, the losses suffered by the Netherworld Sect were immense.

Fu Bo was certain that the one who killed these people was Luan Feng, so his attitude softened as he didn’t dare to think of getting revenge. What worried him the most right now was whether Luan Feng would let things go. If she was unwilling, then it would be yet another calamity for the Netherworld Sect.

Having someone whose status was no less than a Great Emperor show up in person was no joke, and the Netherworld Sect could easily be erased from the Star Boundary if anything went wrong!

Yang Kai snorted lightly, “Yin Le Sheng kept pestering me, but I was magnanimous and kindly spared him in the Shattered Star Sea. To think he still had delusions of causing problems for me, this is very troubling indeed…”

[You’ve already killed him, what the heck are you troubled about! The one who really should be troubled is me!] Fu Bo was enraged, but did not dare to retort.

“As the old sayings go, the folly of the son is the fault of the father, and a Master for a day is a Father for a lifetime. Yin Le Sheng may be dead, but you also have quite a large responsibility as his Master. If you taught him well, then he wouldn’t have been so thick-headed and narrow-minded!”

As expected, the Netherworld Sect and Fu Bo were dragged into this matter.

Though he had known this was coming, Fu Bo was still filled with resentment upon hearing Yang Kai’s words. He dearly wished he had never taken Yin Le Sheng as his Disciple, but with the current state of things, he could not possibly escape?

“What does Your Excellency want?” Sighed Fu Bo.

With Luan Feng glaring at him from behind Yang Kai, Fu Bo’s heart was full of anxiety. He was terrified that he would say something to offend Yang Kai, who would then take the opportunity to give him more substantial trouble.

Yang Kai snorted, “The spiritual wounds and psychological trauma your Disciple caused me are indelible. Even today, I am greatly disturbed when I recall what happened, and I have suffered from sleeplessness and a loss of appetite. Those memories are like evil ghosts, they haunt me and cannot be dispelled…”

Fu Bo raised a hand to interrupt him, and said dejectedly, “Please name your price, Your Excellency.”

He finally figured it out. This time, Yang Kai was not here to actually do anything to the Netherworld Sect or Fu Bo; instead, it seemed like he was here for extortion.

And though it was painful to pay up, Fu Bo did heave a sigh of relief. If he could solve this calamity with Source Crystals, that was still acceptable. The only thing was that this cost… was not going to be low.

Yang Kai side-eyed him in anger, “Aren’t you underestimating me a little too much, Sect Master Fu? You think I can be so easily bribed?”

Fu Bo was stunned, wondering if he could possibly have misunderstood and became anxious once more, completely unable to comprehend what Yang Kai had come to the Netherworld Sect to do.

But Yang Kai suddenly changed his tune, “But… if Sect Master Fu is truly sincere,” he said, stroking his chin, “Then perhaps I won’t be unwilling to put things to rest.”

At those words, Fu Bo was so mad he felt like spitting blood. When Yang Kai was speaking so severely just now, Fu Bo almost thought he was someone with principles. Little did he expect to see Yang Kai’s true colours show so easily.

After all that talk, he was still just here for extortion…

“If I may ask, Your Excellency… how large should this ‘sincerity’ be?” Fu Bo asked darkly.

“If I had tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of Source Crystals,” Yang Kai said flippantly, “Then perhaps I could forget about the matter of people from your noble Sect causing me trouble, and I would be able to sleep peacefully from now on.”

“Tens… hundreds… of millions…” Fu Bo wiped the cold sweat from his forehead in shock, and asked, “Mid-Rank Source Crystals?”

“Preposterous!” Yang Kai’s expression turned to rage and he glared at Fu Bo, “It seems like Sect Master Fu’s sincerity is not enough to quell my fury! Lady Feng!”

At his yell, Luan Feng immediately took a step forward, “What are your orders, Young Master Yang?”

“Wait, wait, wait!” Fu Bo jumped, seeing Luan Feng step forward, and hurriedly raised a hand to halt things. He was pouring cold sweat as he cowered and asked weakly, “Could Your Excellency actually mean… High-Rank Source Crystals?”

Yang Kai sneered coldly, “If Sect Master Fu understands, then why play dumb?”

Fu Bo swallowed in spite of himself, finally understanding the extent of Yang Kai’s greed.

While it wasn’t impossible for the Netherworld Sect to provide that many High-Rank Source Crystals, it would be a huge blow to their resources if they did. The Netherworld Sect was a top Sect in the Eastern Territory and it had many Source Crystal lodes under its control that yielded great profits each year; however, with so many disciples in the Sect, its annual consumption rate was also quite astonishing.

If they really were to satisfy Yang Kai’s demands, then for at least the next few years, the disciples’ cultivation resources would be greatly reduced.

Fu Bo was beside himself with rage. The Vice Sect Master of his own Sect, two Elders, and even his Legacy Disciple had been killed, yet not only did the enemy come to extort him, he even demanded the lion’s share of their resources. Such a thing would infuriate anyone, but Fu Bo had no choice when he was so outclassed. It truly was vexing.

Just as Fu Bo was hesitating, a voice was suddenly heard from outside the hall, “Sect Master, Zhong Yong requests to see you!”

“Great Elder?” Fu Bo frowned, wondering why the Great Elder would come here at such a time. He naturally didn’t wish others to see his distressed state when he was floundering, but then again, perhaps having another person there could be helpful too. With the Great Elder there, they might just be able to recoup some of their losses; after all, he was no outsider.

At that thought, Fu Bo answered, “Come in!”

On the other side, Yang Kai cast a glance at Luan Feng, his mouth curling into a faint smile.

Luan Feng looked as cold as ever as she snorted quietly.

When they had just arrived at the Netherworld Sect, Luan Feng had killed a man who was entranced by her beauty and tried to assault her. That young man had declared his identity as the grandson of the Great Elder.

And now, with the Great Elder of the Netherworld Sect suddenly showing up, how could she not know the reason?

It was clear that he came for revenge.

That was indeed the truth. Earlier, the alluring woman who was with the dead young man had gone to see the Great Elder immediately after giving directions to Yang Kai’s group, and reported everything that had happened.

The Great Elder flew into a rage, and upon learning that Yang Kai and Luan Feng were here to find Fu Bo, he rushed over as well.

It was unacceptable that one of his kin was killed within the Sect’s headquarters. Not to mention, that was his only grandchild. Not only was the crime absolutely unforgivable, but the sheer brazenness of the killer was enough cause for the old man to take offence.

Zhong Yong entered the hall with an icy expression, and the murderous intent in his eyes was so strong that it was almost tangible. After bowing to greet Fu Bo, he immediately looked towards the two women standing behind Yang Kai.

He had heard from the Third-Order Dao Source Realm disciple that his grandson’s killer was a woman with mature and noble looks.

Luan Feng and Ji Yao differed greatly in the impressions they gave off, so Zhou Yong quickly identified which of them was the murderer.

At this moment, Fu Bo was frowning deeply as he pondered how to best explain the current situation to the Great Elder, so he could help come up with ideas, completely failing to notice Zhou Yong’s fury and murderous intent.

Before Fu Bo could break out of his reverie though, Zhou Yong suddenly roared, “Lowly wench, are you the one who killed my grandson!?”

“Huh?” Fu Bo nearly jumped out of his skin as he stared at Zhou Yong in alarm, “Great Elder, what are you talking about?”

[Did I just mishear him?? Did Zhou Yong just hurl that kind of insult?]

Zhou Yong reached out his hand and pointed at Luan Feng, who stood behind Yang Kai, his voice full of fury as he shouted, “Sect Master, it was this slut who cruelly murdered Zhou Ji, my only grandchild, inside the Sect!”

“Zhou Ji?” Fu Bo frowned, “That good-for-nothing waste?”

He knew Zhou Ji was Great Elder Zhou’s grandson. If it was any ordinary disciple, he could not possibly remember their name; after all, in his position and with the Sect having some ten thousand disciples, he could not care less about a mere First-Order Dao Source Realm disciple.

But Zhou Ji, being the Great Elder’s grandson, was naturally different.

Fu Bo had heard about him before and knew that he was a waste with no interest in cultivating. All he did was use his status as the grandson of the Great Elder to get away with any trouble he caused.

But still, that little brat had never damaged anything crucial to the Sect or preyed on any female disciples of notable aptitude. Thus, for the sake of the Great Elder’s face, Fu Bo had never been bothered to deal with him.

He could not have expected that the good-for-nothing had actually gotten himself killed. Not only that, but it also happened inside the Sect… and it was done by the formidable Master that even Fu Bo was intimidated by.

Zhou Yong’s face was full of anguish, “While Ji’er may not have been a good disciple, he was still young! With my personal tutelage, he could’ve one day achieved greatness, but now he is dead! This wench killed him, and now the Zhou family line… has been cut off!”

Fu Bo’s face was as black as it could be as he snuck a glance at Luan Feng’s reaction before roaring, “Great Elder, shut your mouth!”

This woman was pretty much equivalent in status to a Great Emperor! How could Zhou Yong be so blind, repeatedly insulting her by calling her a lowly wench? If he really angered her, then the consequences would be more than they could bear.

At that moment, Fu Bo’s regret was immense. If he had only known this would happen, he would never have let Zhou Yong in. Now, not only was Zhou Yong no help at all, but he was also adding to the trouble.

“Sect Master,” Zhou Yong said, enraged, “Even if they are your guests, I must have my revenge for the death of my grandson!”

He thought that Yang Kai’s group was here, invited by Fu Bo.

But even if they were Fu Bo’s guests, he was unfazed. As he was not only a Third-Order Emperor Ream Master, but also the Great Elder of the Netherworld Sect, his position was of extreme significance. Zhou Yong was sure that the Sect Master would take his side.

However, things were turning out quite contrary to his expectations. Fu Bo instead glared at him and snapped, “Great Elder, I ask you to think of the bigger picture!”

“The bigger picture?” Zhou Yong sneered, “My lineage has ended, what bigger picture is left!? Sect Master, if you allow me to have my revenge, that is all I could ask for, but if you don’t, then I must kill these people even if I have to leave the Netherworld Sect!”

Fu Bo shuddered as he asked in a dark tone of voice, realizing that he was in deep trouble now, “What nonsense are you talking about?”

With the Vice Sect Master and two Elders dead, if the Great Elder chose to leave the Sect as well, then the Netherworld Sect’s power would absolutely plummet. If that happened, then it would be impossible to keep things running even for a Third-Order Emperor Realm Sect Master like himself.

“Please accede to my wishes!” Zhou Yong said with solemn determination, cupping his fists.

He had only said those words as a bluff, and did not really wish to leave the Netherworld Sect; after all, he had committed his life to the Sect and sacrificed greatly for it. How could he cut ties with it so easily?
