Many people could die on the spot even if they were only advancing into the First-Order or Second-Order Open Heaven Realm. Of course, it was less likely for a person to fail when trying to advance into a lower Order of the Open Heaven Realm under the same conditions. That was an indisputable fact.

There was no method or auxiliary aid to improve this situation in the entire 3,000 Worlds, much less a Spirit Pill that could help to improve the success rate of a cultivator in advancing into the Open Heaven Realm. There might have been such knowledge in the past, but as time went on, this knowledge was lost or eliminated for various reasons. It was no wonder that the audience was in an uproar when this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill appeared at auction in Thousand Birds Territory’s Star City. That was something that had been lost with the ages after all.

On the stage, the old man said, “Although I cannot say that this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill is able to guarantee the absolute success in one’s advancement, it can increase the success rate by 50%.”

There was another commotion in the hall. Increasing the success rate by 50% was a terrifying figure. It could almost be said that as long as a cultivator was fully prepared, success in the advancement into the Open Heaven Realm was guaranteed.

Many tyrannical Divine Senses extended outward from the various private rooms, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill.

If this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was a genuine product, then the starting price of 2 million Open Heaven Pills was definitely not expensive. If one were to consider that this deal also came with the pill recipe, it could even be said to be an extremely cheap transaction! After all, who did not have several Juniors or Disciples with excellent aptitude? Used in the right place, this Spirit Pill could create a very powerful Master! How could the worth of such a Master be measured by a mere 2 million Open Heaven Pills? Even a price of 20 million would be worth it!

It was just that… What could their spying tell them? It didn’t take long for these Divine Senses to be retracted in disappointment.

The person who spoke just now asked, “This King would like to go onstage to inspect the item. Can you accommodate my request?”

Red Clouds Auction House seemed to have anticipated this situation, so the man’s request had only just rung out when the old man on the stage nodded in response, “Of course.”

The door to a B Block private room opened and a middle-aged man with a brave and heroic figure walked out. He came to the stage in a few steps and cupped his fist to the old man before he carefully picked up the jade bottle. Opening the bottle cap, he studied the contents carefully and took a sniff of its fragrance. His eyebrows would wrinkle slightly before relaxing again from time to time. Having only heard of the existence of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, he himself had never seen it before; therefore, he could not determine whether this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was the real deal either.

A short while later, he put the jade bottle down and picked the jade slip up. Closing his eyes, he perceived the contents of the jade slip for a moment. Then, he slowly shook his head. He placed the jade slip down and turned around to return to the private room.

Although the jade slip contained the pill recipe for the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, there were many seals placed on the jade slip. There was no way to catch a glimpse of the full pill recipe without breaking these seals. That person’s examination would only allow him to observe what Red Clouds Auction House allowed, such as the main ingredients needed to refine the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill.

The old man on the stage said, “Are there any others who would like to come and inspect the items? You are free to come and have a look for yourself.”

There were indeed many people who wanted to check the items, and so for the next quarter hour, many Open Heaven Realm Masters filed out of the private rooms and approached the stage to investigate the Spirit Pill and its recipe. Even the Proprietress could not contain her curiosity and went to take a look.

When she returned, Bai Qi asked, “Proprietress, is that a genuine product?”

To which she replied, “Red Clouds Auction House is directly owned by Red Clouds Cave Heaven. With their reputation at stake, they will not make fraudulent claims regarding auction items. The item itself should be real, but…”

“But what?”

“But, even if that item is genuine, don’t think that you can refine another Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill with that pill recipe. One of the main ingredients has long since gone extinct. Do you think they would have offered up the pill recipe if there was a way to refine the Spirit Pill themselves?”

The realisation struck Bai Qi, “The pill recipe is useless, but they offered the pill recipe together with the Spirit Pill. That will give people the illusion of having received a great bargain, so the price will naturally go up.”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “What is the main ingredient that has gone extinct?”

Before the Proprietress could answer, he heard somebody inside one of the private rooms exclaim loudly, “World Source Liquid is a treasure that can only be formed when new Worlds are born! Where will we find something like that!? This pill recipe is useless! Useless!”

Yang Kai was stunned by those words, “World Source Liquid?”

The Proprietress nodded, “That’s right. The main ingredient that has long gone extinct is World Source Liquid. Unless you can find a newly formed world… Why do you have such unnatural expressions?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

She looked up only to see Yang Kai and Old Bai staring at each other with extremely strange looks.

Old Bai blinked and pointed at Yang Kai, “He has World Source Liquid.”

Bai Qi was disturbed by Qin Ji, Ling Chun Qiu, and Yue He during his advancement into the Open Heaven Realm back in the Sealing Yang Domain and nearly lost his life as a result. In the end, Yang Kai had given him World Source Liquid with the mentality that giving a dead horse medicine couldn’t harm it. That was what pulled him back from the brink of failure. He would not be alive today if not for Yang Kai.

Consuming World Source Liquid was a wonderful experience. It felt as though his entire being had been transported back to the time when the World was first created, allowing him to witness the beginning of Heaven and Earth splitting apart. Even now, he could still recall the experience vividly.

Both the Proprietress and Yue He turned to stare at Yang Kai with their beautiful eyes, unable to hide their surprise.

“You really have World Source Liquid?”

Yang Kai nodded woodenly.

“Where did you find World Source Liquid!?” The Proprietress was extremely shocked.

He explained, “The Universe World I came from had a Sealed World that still retained the primordial atmosphere from when the world was just formed. I entered that place once before and obtained the World Source Liquid by chance.”

While Yang Kai was speaking, another person in the auction hall spoke up, “May I ask where you obtained this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill and its pill recipe?”

The old man on the stage replied, “To tell you the truth, this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill and its pill recipe were both obtained from a Universe Cave Heaven. The Universe Cave Heaven was quite ancient, dating back at least a few hundreds of thousands of years. As for the specific details regarding the great Senior who left behind this Universe Cave Heaven, please forgive this Old Master for having no comment.”

“En, understandable!” That person responded and stopped asking questions.

Inside the private room, Yang Kai frowned slightly and asked, “What is a Universe Cave Heaven? Is it a Universe World?”

The Proprietress shook her head slowly, “No. A Universe World is a Universe World. Likewise, a Universe Cave Heaven is a Universe Cave Heaven. There are also Universe Paradises. A Universe Cave Heaven is the legacy left behind by an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master after their death. On the other hand, the legacy left behind by a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master is known as a Universe Paradise.”

Yang Kai was only more confused by her explanation and asked in puzzlement, “What do you mean?”

So she tried to explain, “How should I put it? You know that Open Heaven Realm Masters have to split Heaven and Earth apart in their bodies to form a Small Universe, right? Possessing a Small Universe is what defines the Open Heaven Realm. For an Open Heaven Realm Master to strengthen themselves, they need to increase the heritage of their Small Universe. The greater their heritage, the greater their strength. Nevertheless, there is still a difference between a Universe World and a Small Universe, regardless of how powerful that Small Universe is.”

Yang Kai still did not quite understand her explanation.

Still, she continued, “But, if a cultivator advances into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm and reaches the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, their Small Universe will transform into an actual Universe World, which is almost indistinguishable from a real Universe World.”

His entire body shuddered at those words, “Almost indistinguishable?”

“The Small Universe of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters can even accommodate living creatures or allow countless people to settle down peacefully in it. It can be said that they themselves are walking Universe Worlds. In fact, most High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters will bring living creatures, sometimes even Humans, into their Small Universes once they reach the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. If these living creatures and Humans live and flourish within their Small Universe, then the Small Universe will be filled with life and will experience further development. Since doing so strengthens the Small Universe, it correspondingly strengthens the cultivator as well.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded as it was his first time hearing such information. But then again, he had not been in the Outer Universe for long and had next to no interactions with High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, so it was only natural that he was unfamiliar with such things. If he had not participated in the auction today, he might not have had access to such information for a very long time.

“As for what is the difference between a Small Universe and an actual Universe World,” the Proprietress continued her explanation, “When a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master is about to die, he can choose to seal off his Small Universe. In that case, his Small Universe will not collapse and disappear with his death. Instead, it will be preserved as a peculiar existence that transforms into a Universe Paradise or a Universe Cave Heaven. These Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens contain all the wealth of these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. You will enjoy great benefits if you ever manage to enter any one of them.”

Yang Kai immediately understood, “In other words, Red Clouds Auction House obtained the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill and its recipe by entering a Universe Cave Heaven left behind by a dead ancient Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Is that right?”

“That’s probably the case.” She gently nodded, “Throughout the ages, the 3,000 Worlds have given birth to countless High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, so even if only a small part of them chose to seal off their Small Universes at their moment of death, there are still countless Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises out there. It is just that not many people know where these Universe Cave Heavens and Universe Paradises are located.”

Bai Qi smiled widely, “Just because something is very rare doesn’t mean that there are none out there though. There are always people with Heaven-defying luck who will receive the opportunity to obtain the legacy of such Seniors. Their cultivation will generally soar as a result.”

During their conversation, the bidding for the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill had already started in the auction hall. Everybody knew that the main ingredient for refining the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was long extinct. Even so, the Spirit Pill was a genuine product; thus, the bidding scene was extremely lively.

In less than ten breaths, the price of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill had climbed from the starting price of 2 million Open Heaven Pills to 10 million Open Heaven Pills. Moreover, it was still rising at an extremely fast rate.

...

Leaving aside the powerful effects of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill that might even save the life of an important disciple or Junior and rescue the future hope of a great force at a critical moment in the future, just the pill recipe alone had research value. It might be possible to find substitute ingredients from existing materials. It did not matter even if the authentic Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill could not be refined. As long as a similar imitation product could be refined, it would bring in a steady stream of income for any great force.

Among the many Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in the private rooms, which one of them was not a Sect Master or Elder who held real authority in their respective great forces? It was only natural that nobody was willing to give up on something that could benefit their entire Sect. If they succeeded in their attempt, they could even make a huge contribution to their great force. The people who claimed that the pill recipe was useless earlier were either too biased or wanted to mislead the others and reduce their competition.
