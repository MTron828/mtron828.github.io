Yang Kai introduced Bian Yu Qing and the two women greeted each other.

“In the future, the two of you can discuss matters of Void Land between yourselves and act as you see fit. There’s no need to ask me,” he said.

“Yes!” The two women responded respectfully.

Yang Kai was used to leaving matters to others. He had a free and unrestrained temperament. Expanding his domain territory and conquering his enemies were nothing to him. On the contrary, asking him to remain in one place and manage the development of the land was difficult.

That was why he was adamant about bringing Hua Qing Si and Bian Yu Qing with him.

It was just that Hua Qing Si had not followed him and chose to remain at High Heaven Palace; therefore, there was no choice but to put most of the burden on Bian Yu Qing. The 600,000 people he brought with him this time were all from the Star Boundary, so Bian Yu Qing was familiar with their origins and could easily make arrangements for them. It was just that Void Land was in the Outer Universe after all, a place she did not know much about. If she worked with Yue He, they could complement each other’s strengths and cover each other’s weaknesses.

With the two of them managing Void Land, Yang Kai would no longer need to worry.

Aside from the Great Emperors, Yang Xiao, Yang Xue, and several others who left to investigate, the remaining people among the 600,000 quietly stood in place. Although they were looking at their surroundings in amazement, they were like a well-disciplined army and did not make any unnecessary noises.

So many people suddenly arrived at Void Land all at once, so it was safe to say that the top priority at the moment was to assign lodgings to them. Fortunately, Void Land was not small. There were a total of seven Spirit Provinces, so it was not hard to accommodate these people.

Yue He and Bian Yu Qing immediately gathered together and discussed this matter.

The 600,000 people were soon separated into seven groups and were then led away by some people, splitting up to head to one of the seven Spirit Provinces. These people leading the way used to belong to Yue He’s Small Orchid Palace. After Small Orchid Palace was disbanded and destroyed, they followed Yue He to Void Land. It could be said that they were the first batch of immigrants. By now, they were already a part of Void Land. Having arrived earlier, they were a little more familiar with Void Land. If nothing else, leading the way was not a problem for them.

While these people were busy working, Yang Kai suddenly heard a cry coming from the depths of Earth Spirit Land. It was followed by a furious roar. Immediately afterward, the ground shook and the World Energy became chaotic. It felt like there were people fighting in the depths of Earth Spirit Land.

Yang Kai was stupefied, but when he detected a certain flitting aura, he quickly turned to look in that direction and shouted, “Shit!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, he shifted his body and rushed over in that direction. Similarly, the expressions of Yu Ru Meng and the others changed slightly and they hurriedly followed after Yang Kai.

While flying over, Bian Yu Qing asked, “Lady Yue He, are there any unvanquished enemies left in Void Land?”

Yue He shook her head, “It’s not an enemy. It’s just… This person’s existence is a little special. I can’t explain it well, but you will understand once you’ve seen yourself.”

Bian Yu Qing gently nodded in response.

A short while later, a group of people gathered in the middle of Earth Spirit Land where the central Main Hall was located.

A ferocious Monster was lying on the ground over there, his entire body exuding the aura of a Divine Spirit. Who else could it be but Qiong Qi? It was just that Old Qiong had revealed his true appearance at this moment. He was also restrained on the ground, completely unable to move. What bound his movements were numerous fine filaments that emitted a bright white light. The harder he struggled, the tighter those filaments dug into his skin. It didn’t take long for his entire body to be covered in blood.

On the other side, Liu Yan had transformed into a Fire Phoenix. Her body was soaring in mid-air, but her mouth was also bound by identical threads. She was unable to utter a single sound.

Outside the Main Hall stood a beautiful woman with an enchanting figure and a pair of cold eyes. She was holding Yang Xiao in one hand and Yang Xue in the other. There was no aura coming from her body. Nevertheless, Yang Xiao, who was usually a fearless little bastard, was currently quivering in fright. His complexion was pale and he couldn’t even muster the courage to fight back. Yang Xue pursed her red lips lightly as her complexion was also pale.

Yang Kai’s face twitched at the sight.

This woman was Zhu Jiu Yin, who had been healing in retreat all this while. Ever since they took over and established Void Land, she had been in seclusion and never showed herself at all. In the entire Void Land, nobody else knew about her existence aside from the people who followed Yang Kai out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

Calculating the time, it had been nearly a year since they came out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, and although her injuries were not completely healed, they should be much better by now.

Yang Kai felt a huge headache as he had no idea what this little brat had done to anger Zhu Jiu Yin.

*Shua shua shua…*

Countless figures came rushing over, one after another. They were the Great Emperors who came to check out the situation after they noticed the commotion. When they saw Qiong Qi, Liu Yan, Yang Xiao, and Yang Xue in such a state, they were shocked.

It had to be said that the combat power of these four was quite remarkable, especially Qiong Qi. As Flowing Time Great Emperor’s mount, he had lived for tens of thousands of years and his strength outside the Star Boundary was not inferior to a Great Emperor’s. However, all four of them had been completely subdued even though only a short time had passed since the commotion began.

On the other hand, the woman was calm and unruffled. She was definitely an Open Heaven Realm Master!

[We definitely can’t afford to offend her!]

The next to arrive on scene were the two Elders of the Dragon Clan, Fu Zhun dan Zhu Yan.

Fu Zhun looked over and saw her son being held up in the air by an unknown woman and immediately lost her temper as she shouted, “Who are you!? Put Xiao’er down immediately!”

“Dragon Clan?” Zhu Jiu Yin tilted her head to the side and glanced at the two Great Elders of the Dragon Clan. She did not think much of them though and instead looked over at Yang Kai with great interest. Her beautiful eyes were elegant, sparkling with a strange light.

Yang Kai frowned, “Senior, I don’t know what my Adopted Son and my Little Sister have done to upset you, but please be merciful.”

To which Zhu Jiu Yin coldly snorted, “If this Queen had not been merciful, do you think they would still be alive? This Queen was recuperating from her injuries in peace when they suddenly barged in. If this had happened in the past, I would have killed them on the spot.”

Feeling speechless, Yang Kai glared fiercely at Yang Xiao. [This brat sure does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth, accidentally offending Zhu Jiu Yin.]

“Many thanks, Senior. They only just arrived here, so they do not know of your greatness. I will discipline them thoroughly later.”

Zhu Jiu Yin’s eyes flashed before she casually tossed Yang Xiao and Yang Xue on the ground.

Only then did Yang Kai let out a breath of relief. Although this woman had made an oath on her Source to become his Protector and swore never to harm him, that oath only applied to him and not the people around him. If she refused to let go of this matter, it would also give him some trouble.

There was a whooshing sound suddenly and Yang Kai’s vision blurred for a moment. Then, he found that Zhu Jiu Yin had appeared right in front of him. She was so close that their faces nearly touched. Thus, he jumped back in fright and asked, “What is it, Senior?”

“Move aside!” She pushed him away and studied the person standing behind him with great interest.

As their gazes met, Shan Qing Luo looked at the woman in front of her with a strange expression. For some reason, she felt an inexplicable sense of affinity towards this person. It felt as though this woman in front of her was a long-lost relative.

“What is your name?” Zhu Jiu Yin asked with a smile.

“Shan Qing Luo!”

She nodded and lifted a hand to grab Shan Qing Luo’s jade white hand. In front of everybody’s eyes, she placed one of Shan Qing Luo’s fingers in her mouth and bit down gently.

Shan Qing Luo furrowed her brow in response, clearly feeling that her skin had been broken.

Zhu Jiu Yin drew a drop of blood and tasted it on her tongue before spitting it out with a look of disgust, “Why is your bloodline so thin?”

“Senior, you…” Shan Qing Luo seemed to understand something at that moment and her beautiful eyes lit up with a mixture of shock and delight.

Zhu Jiu Yin grabbed Shan Qing Luo’s hand without allowing for objections and headed towards the Grand Hall behind her, “Come with me.”

Shan Qing Luo followed, glancing back at Yang Kai with a mixture of excitement and unease.

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but did not know what to say.

Zhu Jiu Yin halted abruptly and turned back to look at him, “From now on, this girl belongs to me. Do you have any objections?”

“None!” Yang Kai hurriedly replied.

“Lucky you know what’s good for you!” Zhu Jiu Yin coldly snorted and continued onward.

Yang Kai quickly shot a look at Shan Qing Luo that seemed to say, “Don’t worry.”

The door to the Grand Hall slammed shut with a loud bang, blocking out everybody’s line of sight. Everybody then turned their gaze to Yang Kai instead as Zhan Wu Hen frowned and asked, “Who is that woman?”

Su Yan was also a little worried and asked, “Husband, she took Luo’er away. Will she be okay?”

Yang Kai smiled, “It’s fine. This is a great opportunity for Luo’er.”

Zhu Jiu Yin was a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider. Yang Kai had learned about the Divine Spirit known as the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider from Shan Qing Luo a long time ago. This couldn’t be helped; after all, Shan Qing Luo also possessed a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Source.

Just now, Zhu Jiu Yin had ignored everyone else and only showed interest in Shan Qing Luo, clearly aware of the bloodline within the latter. Now that she had taken Shan Qing Luo away with her, Shan Qing Luo’s cultivation would gain an overwhelming advantage over everybody else with the personal guidance of a Great Senior like her.

Yang Kai had cooperated with Zhu Jiu Yin in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary firstly because had no other choice, but secondly to create a path for Shan Qing Luo in the future. Otherwise, he could very well have gone and cooperated with Jin Wu instead.

It was extremely difficult to chance upon another Divine Spirit of the same Race. The 3,000 World’s might be vast, but there were precious few Divine Spirits like the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider left. If he missed Zhu Jiu Yin, only the Heavens knew when he would come across another Heavenly Moon Demon Spider.

After Yang Kai revealed Zhu Jiu Yin’s identity to the others, Yang Xiao and Yang Xue were filled with a sense of dread. They never imagined that they would accidentally provoke such a terrifying existence. Likewise, Fu Zhun and Zhu Yan also felt some lingering fears. If a Master of that level had truly intended to kill Yang Xiao, nobody could have stopped her even with so many people present.

Even so, they also felt a sense of excitement in addition to their fear.

That was because they witnessed the terrifying heights a Divine Spirit could grow to. They were part of the Dragon Clan after all. Among all the Divine Spirits, the Dragons and Phoenixes were considered rulers as they were the strongest. If a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider could grow to such terrifying heights, then what would members of the Dragon Clan be like if they were to develop and mature?

It was just that they had not known how to continue refining their bloodline. Over countless years, they had remained stagnant and unable to progress further; however, they were now in the Outer Universe so their situation might just improve!

Regardless of whether it was the Dragon Clan’s Elders, Qiong Qi, or Liu Yan, they seemed to have found a sliver of hope in the darkness. As long as they followed this trace of hope, there would come a day when they escape the darkness surrounding them to see the real light beyond.
