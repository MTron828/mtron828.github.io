Su Ying Xue and Qing Kui led Yang Kai to forward while Qing Kui hospitably told him some general information about Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Yang Kai repeatedly nodded as he listened to him.

A moment later, they arrived at a detached building where there was a pretty-looking female disciple who greeted them. Since she was just an Emperor Realm cultivator, she was supposed to be a maidservant in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.

The maidservant saluted Su Ying Xue and Qing Kui before uttering softly, “Greetings, Elders.”

Su Ying Xue nodded gently, then turned to look at Yang Kai, “The Dao Theory Assembly is still half a month away, so you’d better get some rest here. When the time comes, someone will inform you how to take part in the assembly.”

Qing Kui landed a forceful slap on the other man’s shoulder, “You have my best wishes, Junior Brother Yang.” He seemed to have high hopes in Yang Kai.

An embarrassed Yang Kai quickly replied, “Senior Sister Su, Senior Brother Qing, I’m worried there’s a misunderstanding here. I’m not here to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly.”

Su Ying Xue and Qing Kui were startled.

“What do you mean? Why have you come all the way here if you’re not going to participate in the Dao Theory Assembly?” Su Ying Xue asked with a frown.

Yang Kai replied following a sigh, “This matter has something to do with me after all. Since I’m aware of that, I have to come over to have a look. Where’s Senior Sister Qu now? Can I see her?”

Su Ying Xue stared fixedly at him with a furious expression while Qing Kui hurriedly said, “It’s not convenient for Junior Sister Qu to meet anyone now. Please stay here for the moment, Junior Brother Yang. We can talk about it at a later time.”

Then, he sent a signal to the maidservant, who then extended her hand and said, “This way please, Sir.”

“We’ll take our leave now since we have other matters to attend to. I’ll visit you again soon.” Qing Kui patted the other man’s shoulder, then released his power to engulf Su Ying Xue and shot into the sky.

Yang Kai was about to say something when they abruptly left. After the two of them were out of sight, he followed the maidservant to enter the building and get some rest.

“How could he say he’s not going to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly when he’s already here!?” Su Ying Xue was incensed, “In that case, the plan of those great forces will succeed. By then, Qu’er will have to marry a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Perhaps the winner will be some worn out old man!”

Qing Kui grinned, “Just like what you’ve said, he’s already here. Do you think he can refuse to participate in the Dao Theory Assembly?”

Su Ying Xue gazed at him with vigilance, “What are you trying to do?”

An innocent looking Qing Kui replied, “Nothing. Let’s go. We have to inform Honoured Master about it. He must be pretty anxious by now.”

As they spoke, they dashed towards a certain Spirit Peak and soon after, landed before a palace.

Before they even entered though, they heard a man bellowing, “How dare they do that! What a bunch of shameless bastards! Do they even have any regard for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven? Father here will go out and kill them all now!” Following that, some things were heard breaking to pieces.

Su Ying Xue and Qing Kui exchanged glances as they couldn’t help but flinch. It wasn’t until the noises subsided that they dragged their feet inside.

The ground inside the Grand Hall was a mess and many servants were cleaning things up with stiff expressions.

In the centre of the hall stood a ferocious-looking man with his hands behind his back. He was clad in a robe embroidered with snake patterns, and he had a golden crown on his head. Presently, he was recklessly releasing his powerful Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm aura, which caused the servants to shudder in fear.

The person was none other than Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Inner Elder, Xu Ling Gong. He was also the Honoured Master of Qu Hua Shang, Su Ying Xue, and Qing Kui.

Just then, Qu Hua Shang shuffled forward with a longsword that was even bigger than her in her hands. Upon reaching the man, she lifted the sword and said in a clear voice, “Your sword is here, Honoured Master.”

“What are you doing?” Xu Ling Gong gazed at her.

Qu Hua Shang batted her eyes and replied, “Didn’t you say you were going out to kill them all? Let’s go now. I’ll cheer for you from behind.”

“Do you think I don’t dare to do it?” Xu Ling Gong sported a grim expression and took the longsword and dashed towards the door, “I’m going now. No one can stop me!”

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue sported dark expressions. Following an exchange of glances, they sprinted forward and respectively grabbed Xu Ling Gong’s arms.

“Calm down, Honoured Master! We can discuss this first.”

“Please don’t act on impulse, Honoured Master. It will certainly feel good to kill them now, but that won’t solve the problem. Why would you invite trouble to yourself for no results?”

The two of them hurriedly dissuaded Xu Ling Gong from acting rashly.

As though Xu Ling Gong had just noticed them, he said, “Oh, Su’er and Qing’er.”

Su Ying Xue quickly snatched the longsword from her Honoured Master and tossed it at Qu Hua Shang before glaring at her. In response, Qu Hua Shang playfully stuck out her tongue.

“Please have a seat and drink some tea, Honoured Master.” Qing Kui pulled Xu Ling Gong towards a chair and got him a cup of tea from the side.

Xu Ling Gong grunted and took a sip of the tea. All of a sudden, he blew his top again and threw the cup to the ground, which caused it to break into pieces. In a furious voice, he said, “Since you’ve returned from outside, I suppose you’ve heard something.”

Qing Kui replied with a straight face, “Yes. The Territory Gates around Yin-Yang Territory have all been cordoned off and all foreign Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who were planning to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly were chased away. Only Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters are being allowed to enter.”

“They’ve gone too far!” Xu Ling Gong pounded his fist against the table, “How can those Fifth-Order trash even hope to marry my Disciple? Who do they think they are? They should look at themselves in the mirror first!”

With the longsword in her hands, Qu Hua Shang said with a nonchalant smile, “I don’t mind marrying a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. at that point, I’ll bring the person to meet you, and you can just come up with a random reason and kill him. It won’t be so bad being a widow.”

Xu Ling Gong’s eyes brightened when he heard that as he gazed at Qu Hua Shang and said with an elated expression, “You’re indeed clever, little girl. How did you even come up with that idea?”

Qu Hua Shang replied, “It’s all thanks to your teachings, Honoured Master.”

Xu Ling Gong guffawed with a proud expression, “Of course it’s because of my teachings. My Disciples are all intelligent and talented.”

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue sported helpless expressions. Then, Su Ying Xue glared at Qu Hua Shang and said, “How can you make a scene here beside Honoured Master? When you really have to marry a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from one of those Cave Heavens or Paradises, you’ll spend most of your days crying.”

Qu Hua Shang scoffed, “Let’s see who will be the one crying in the end.”

Su Ying Xue shook her head and gazed at Xu Ling Gong, “Honoured Master, why has this matter even come to such a point? It isn’t like there have never been any disputes or even casualties between the Cave Heavens and Paradises. It’s an age-old admonition that the disciples of the Cave Heavens and Paradises must not fight against each other, but everyone knows that conflicts still happen. Why is Qu’er getting this kind of punishment?”

Upon hearing that, Xu Ling Gong sighed, “There are indeed some conflicts between the Cave Heavens and Paradises, and it’s true that there have been casualties as a result. However, those were just internal struggles among the Cave Heavens and Paradises. But now, Qu’er has made a mistake for an outsider. Moreover, that brat attempted to directly ascend to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, which broke the taboo.”

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue frowned. Given their powers and statuses, they were aware of some secrets that were not known to most people. As they recalled the stories of the carnage of many years ago, they could faintly grasp the severity of the matter. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Cave Heavens and Paradises were trying to make their stance clear. They would never allow anyone to directly ascend to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, and this incident could serve as a warning to all other cultivators of that determination.

If an event like this ever happened again, the disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises should know what to do and remember which side to take.

“Yin-Yang Cave Heaven is one of the 36 Cave Heavens, so while we can resist a certain amount of pressure, Qu’er will have to suffer some punishment…” Xu Ling Gong sighed.

Then, his expression turned furious all of a sudden, “However, those old bastards are too shameless! How can they pull such a dirty trick just because they aren’t willing to let a Sixth-Order disciple get married into our Sect?”

...

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue traded glances, then the former said, “We have a potential solution to that, Honoured Master.”

Xu Ling Gong gaped at him and asked, “What solution do you have?”

Qing Kui replied, “I reckon that the person who has caused all this will have to solve this problem as well.”

Xu Ling Gong became startled for a moment, “Are you talking about that Yang Kai?” Then, he became vexed, “I’m still mad at that brat! If I ever see him, I’ll kill him with my sword! It’s because of that thief that Qu’er’s happiness is ruined!”

“Uh… Well… Honoured Master…” Qing Kui appeared hesitant.

Xu Ling Gong shot him a glare, “Stop stuttering like a woman and speak up!”

“To be honest with you, Honoured Master, Yang Kai has arrived in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. He’s currently resting in Riverside House now,” Qing Kui said meekly.

Xu Ling Gong became startled for a moment before he stood straight up and bellowed, “Father here will go hack him to death now!” When he attempted to take his sword though, Qu Hua Shang hugged it tightly and shook her head at him.

“Let go!” Xu Ling Gong yelled.

“No!” Qu Hua Shang repeatedly shook her head.

“Are you trying to go against me, little girl?” Xu Ling Gong was incensed.

...

“If you want to hack him to death, you’ll have to kill me first!”

Qu Hua Shang extended her fair neck and presented her head to Xu Ling Gong, who then pushed her away.

“Why would I kill you? Father here only wants to hack him to death! How did that little bastard have the nerve to come to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven? It does save me the trouble since he is already here though. Today, Father will end his life!”

As a commotion broke out, the hall descended into chaos.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue hurriedly went over to placate Xu Ling Gong and eventually made him sit down again, though they were now drenched in sweat, feeling exhausted.

“Honoured Master, Yang Kai is in fact in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, not the Fifth-Order,” Qing Kui quickly reported as he was worried that any further delay would result in more chaos.

“So what if he’s in the Sixth-Order? As a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, I can kill him easily,” Xu Ling Gong scoffed.

On the other hand, Qu Hua Shang was astonished, “Impossible! I saw Junior Brother Yang ascend to the Fifth-Order. He refined a Fifth-Order Yin Element treasure, I’m sure of it. How could he be in the Sixth-Order now?”

Qing Kui replied, “I have no idea; however, I tested him, and I can confirm that he’s indeed in the Sixth-Order.”
