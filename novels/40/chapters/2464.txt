Emperor Authority Beads had always been rare, so even if Feng Xi was the Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master, it was next to impossible for him to have a second one. Right now, Feng Xi was nothing but a stray dog, so Yang Kai basically didn’t put any importance on him.

Before entering the Shattered Star Sea, he could easily crush a cultivator in the same realm and could be considered invincible in the Dao Source Realm. In the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai had comprehended the Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Divine Ability and subdued the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Additionally, his Spiritual Energy and Source Qi had grown noticeably.

Yang Kai believed that if he were to now face Feng Xi’s Emperor Authority Bead, he would not be in as precarious a situation as he was before.

“Senior Brother Yang, you must not be careless. Feng Xi is no longer what he used to be…” Seeing Yang Kai not caring one bit about Feng Xi, the Ice Heart Valley disciples quickly warned him.

But she could finish her words, Yang Kai suddenly raised his head, gazing towards the depth of the void in a certain direction before shouting, “They are coming!”

“They’re coming?” The three Ice Heart Valley disciples were stunned after hearing this and immediately looked in the direction Yang Kai was looking, but even if they spread their Divine Senses, they couldn’t detect anyone.

Yang Kai explained with a smile, “My Star Seal is seven-pointed, so the distance I can sense them approaching from is much farther than yours.”

“Feng Xi also has the seven-pointed Star Seal!” One of the Ice Heart Valley disciples’ pretty faces turned pale, “Since Senior Brother Yang can sense them, Feng Xi can definitely sense us too. How many are they?”

Yang Kai replied, “I sense two, so there should be three!”

If Feng Xi had a seven-pointed Star Seal, Yang Kai would naturally be unable to sense his existence; however, what made him puzzled was that Feng Xi had a seven-pointed Star Seal. How did he achieve that?

Yang Kai had only obtained a seven-pointed Star Seal after collecting several dozen Star Seals left by the dead cultivators in The Void. How could Feng Xi kill several dozen people all on his own? Although he was quite strong, his strength wasn’t that exaggerated, right? All the cultivators in the Shattered Star Sea weren’t good to provoke.

While he was feeling uncertain, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had already caught three auras that were approaching rather quickly, and he found one of them to be quite familiar; it was none other than Feng Xi.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s eyes bulged as he muttered in shock, “When did Feng Xi advance to the Emperor Realm?”

He had clearly noticed a distinct Emperor Aura lingering around Feng Xi, and although this aura was unstable, there was no doubt that Feng Xi had already reached the Emperor Realm.

This discovery shocked Yang Kai more than when he learned that it was Zi Yu who was making the breakthrough here. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had only spent a year and a half in the Void, yet so many things had happened outside?

First, Zi Yu was on the verge of a breakthrough, and now, Feng Xi had already been broken through to the Emperor Realm. What about geniuses of the other Sects? Were they also advancing at a similar pace?

“It’s all because Feng Xi reached the Emperor Realm that we sisters aren’t his opponent anymore and could only flee. Fortunately, his realm hasn’t been consolidated yet, otherwise we wouldn’t have even been able to escape,” an Ice Heart Valley disciple added with a wry smile.

Yang Kai quickly regained his calm and finally understood why this young woman had said that Feng Xi was no longer what he used to be.

Although there was only a difference of one step between the Third-Order Dao Source Realm and First-Order Emperor Realm, the gap in strength was worlds apart.

“Senior Brother Yang, you’d best flee!” The Ice Heart Valley disciples anxiously stated, “Feng Xi has enmity towards you. If he sees you, he won’t let you go.”

“What would you do if I leave?” Yang Kai glanced at her.

The lead young woman replied, “Feng Xi has been chasing us all this time, not because he wants to kill us, but because he wants to force Eldest Senior Sister to submit. So, we don’t actually have to worry about our lives.”

Yang Kai added, “Even if Feng Xi has no intention of killing you, do you think he will just sit back and watch while Zi Yu breaks through?”

The Seeking Passion Sect cultivated the Dao of Passion, so in order to truly make Zi Yu his, Feng Xi had to possess absolute strength to suppress her. As such, there was no way Feng Xi would allow Zi Yu to succeed in her breakthrough; he would definitely interfere because once Zi Yu advanced, his advantage would disappear.

But at this critical juncture, how could they let anyone interfere with Zi Yu?

If Feng Xi properly controlled his strength, it should still be possible for him to make Zi Yu fail without killing her, but if he didn’t, Zi Yu might very well die under the World Energy Baptism.

No matter what the result was, it wouldn’t be acceptable to Zi Yu.

The three Ice Heart Valley disciples had obviously thought of this, so despite asking Yang Kai to leave, all three of them looked incredibly anxious and worried.

“Perhaps, we can replace Eldest Senior Sister and make Feng Xi give up?” One of them agonizingly suggested.

The other two turned pale, but they remained silent.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “It’s not that I am disdaining you, nor is it that you aren’t beautiful, but think about how many wives and concubines Feng Xi has and what kind of beauties he hasn’t seen? Since he has taken a liking to Zi Yu, naturally he won’t easily give up. It could be said that Sister Zi Yu’s existence is a kind of heart demon to him already, one he needs to overcome in order to continue his Martial Dao. The three of you can’t replace Zi Yu.”

“What should we do then? Should we fight?”

Yang Kai grinned viciously as he indifferently stated, “Don’t worry, if they dare to come, none of them will escape alive.”

Once he proclaimed this, the three young women looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, their faces filled with surprise.

Yang Kai’s earlier statement could be blamed on him having outdated intelligence, not knowing Feng Xi had already broken through to the Emperor Realm, but now when he still dared to say the same after learning about Feng Xi’s true strength, he seemed arrogant and overconfident.

[No matter how strong Senior Brother Yang is supposed to be, he is still just a Dao Source Realm cultivator, right?]

[How can a Dao Source Realm be an opponent of an Emperor Realm? The two are basically not on the same level. If it really came to a fight, Senior Brother Yang would miserably die for sure.]

Noticing the strange looks on their faces, Yang Kai knew what was going through their minds, but he didn’t bother to explain himself. Instead, he turned serious as he stated, “An Emperor Realm Master’s attacks are all extremely powerful, and Sister Zi Yu is at the critical point in her breakthrough. She cannot be disturbed, not even the slightest bit, so I will find a way to distract Feng Xi, while the three of you guard Sister Zi Yu to the best of your abilities.”

“Senior Brother Yang, are you planning to…” An Ice Heart Valley disciple suddenly covered her charming red lips, looking at Yang Kai with gratitude and surprise; she had clearly understood his intentions.

He was clearly planning to disregard his own safety to give Zi Yu time and space to break through.

Suddenly, her face turned determined as she declared, “Senior Brother Yang, I will join you!”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, asking, “What do you think you can do?”

She bit her lips and replied, “I can do whatever Senior Brother Yang can do.”

She seemed to have decided to ignore her life or death.

Yang Kai failed to stop himself from laughing as he refused, “No, I’ll be fine alone.”

After having said so, he didn’t haggle with her anymore and flew directly towards the approaching enemies, leaving just one sentence, “Watch over Zi Yu. If you can comprehend anything from her breakthrough to the Emperor Realm, it will also be greatly beneficial to you. Don’t miss this good opportunity!”

And with that, he disappeared from their sight, leaving the three Ice Heart Valley disciples anxiously gazing in the direction he disappeared towards, wondering whether they should chase after him.

But it was also true that right now Zi Yu needed someone to stand guard here. As such, they didn’t dare to act rashly despite feeling as anxious as ants on a hot wok.

Somewhere in the void, three Seeking Passion Sect disciples, who were rushing towards the Ice Heart Valley disciples, all wore excited looks, and their leader was none other than Young Sect Master Feng Xi.

Ever since Feng Xi broke through to the Emperor Realm half a year ago, the three of them have been all but invincible in the Shattered Star Sea. Thanks to Feng Xi, the two disciples with him had also upgraded their Star Seals to six-pointed ones.

Feng Xi even had a seven-pointed Star Seal! One could imagine how many they had killed during this time in order to rob them of their Star Seals and treasures.

The might of the Emperor Realm had filled Feng Xi with confidence, making him feel as if no one was his opponent anymore.

As he rushed forward, Feng Xi suddenly furrowed his brow and his figure came to stop as he narrowed his eyes and scanned the scene before him.

“Young Sect Master, what happened?” Seeing this, the other two disciples hurriedly stopped and turned to him curiously.

Feng Xi indifferently replied, “Someone is coming towards us.”

A yellow-faced youth turned angry after hearing this and coldly snorted, “Who is so stupid that he dares to challenge Young Sect Master?”

Another middle-aged man, who was dressed like a scholar, added, “Probably some blind fool just begging for death!”

Feng Xi agreed with a nod, “Naturally we should kill this newcomer, but why does this aura… feel so familiar? It’s like I’ve met him somewhere before.”

While speaking, Feng Xi suddenly felt extremely uneasy and his heart started beating wildly, making him restless. This reaction surprised him as, ever since he had broken through to the Emperor Realm, such a sensation had never plagued him no matter how many enemies he had to face. He believed he had already reached a point where his emotions could always remain as tranquil as an ancient well, but now, his anxiety was running wild.

[Who is it?] Feng Xi suddenly became a little concerned as he narrowed his eyes and stared ahead.

After a short while, a streak of light shot over from the distance and stopped not too far away from the Seeking Passion Sect trio. When the light dissipated, a face that Feng Xi was familiar with and hated deeply appeared before him.

“How is that possible!?” Feng Xi’s face distorted horribly as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Two and a half years ago, when he had first entered the Shattered Star Sea, he and Yang Kai had been teleported close to one another, and knowing that he wasn’t Yang Kai’s opponent, Feng Xi had decisively used his Emperor Authority Bead. After that attack, Yang Kai’s aura had completely disappeared, so Feng Xi believed that Yang Kai had died.

It became a fact after he had not encountered Yang Kai over these years nor heard any news of him.

The terror that was Yang Kai had all but disappeared from Feng Xi’s memories.

But now, this nightmare had appeared in front of him like a ghost. Furthermore, he was perfectly alive and well.

But how was that possible? How could a Dao Source Realm cultivator not die even after taking a hit from an Emperor Authority Bead head-on? Feng Xi’s mind was in turmoil and he couldn’t help but ask, “Are you a man or a ghost?”

Yang Kai pursed his lips and grinned widely, “Young Sect Master is still as besotted as ever after these two years. How can you ask such a direct question when I have just arrived? How would you like me to answer?”
