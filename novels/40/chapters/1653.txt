Chi Huo smiled happily, his red hair dancing even without any wind, a strong momentum radiating from his body as he spiritedly pointed his hand at Su Yan and said to Wei Feng behind him, “Little beast, this girl is yours from now on, whether you torment or kill her, it’s all up to you to decide!”

He was not satisfied with the victory in front of him and wanted to further irritate the leadership of Ice Heart Valley and try to provoke them into making a rash decision.

However, everyone from Ice Heart Valley remained silent, just wearing despondent expressions, not even questioning Luo Li’s decision.

This made Chi Huo extremely disappointed, but also a bit contemptuous.

The actions and attitudes of these people from Ice Heart Valley may have been taken for the good of the Sect, but they had lost all moral standing as a result. He believed that after this incident, the future Ice Heart Valley would certainly not need to be feared!

Wei Feng smiled deviously, the injuries on both his cheeks making his laughter somewhat weak as he spoke unclearly, “How could disciple torment or kill her? Disciple is completely unwilling to even hurt her. Disciple thanks Supreme Elder! Supreme Elder’s might is truly unparalleled!”

Although Wei Feng was timid and weak, he was good at sucking up, so his few words further energized Chi Huo, and even made him feel this little brat was not so unpleasant to the eye.

“Good!” Luo Hai clapped his hands with a faint smile on his face. “This King congratulates you all. I hope your two Sects can use this as an opportunity to further peace between you in the future; after all, it benefits no one for the two greatest forces on Scarlet Wave Star to constantly fight and kill one another.”

“Brother Luo Hai, if you have nothing urgent to attend to, why not come back to Brilliant Flame Sect to share in the wedding festivities?” Chi Huo looked at him and sent out an invitation.

Luo Hai shook his head slowly, “No, this King has been away for too long already, it is time he returned to Green Mountains Star.”

Ice Heart Valley everyone looked at Chi Huo, seeing him boast and bluster in such a domineering fashion, but not daring to say anything. Even Luo Li adopted a stance of ‘what the eyes do not see, the heart does not grieve’.

“Yang Kai, come with me!” Luo Hai looked at Yang Kai and spoke in a tone that allowed no refusal.

Yang Kai sneered slightly without even looking at him, his eyes sweeping across the faces of everyone from Ice Heart Valley.

All of them, however, set aside their gazes, with looks of guilt upon their faces.

Even Ran Yun Ting was the same, but soon, she turned back and snapped back, “You’ve brought this upon yourself, you have no one else to blame!”

Yang Kai sneered even more.

Gently patting the back of Su Yan’s hand, Yang Kai said, “Senior Sister, go and salute these so-called Elders of yours. From now on, you have nothing to do with them!”

“Of course, I’ll listen to you,” Su Yan nodded obediently before stepping forward and sweeping her eyes across the Ice Heart Valley Elders. After bowing deeply, she lifted her head and spoke to Ran Yun Ting, “This is the last time Disciple will call you Honoured Master. Disciple offers here sincere thanks for Honoured Master’s generous teachings over these years. Please be well in the future, Honoured Master!”

Ran Yun Ting opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something, but ultimately, she just turned her eyes away.

Su Yan seemed to break free of the shackles binding her at that moment and returned to Yang Kai’s side lightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Little brat, don’t be stubborn, just follow Brother Luo Hai obediently. As for this little girl next to you, she belongs to my Brilliant Flame Sect from now on,” Chi Huo coldly snorted.

Yang Kai and Su Yan looked at each other and suddenly smiled at the same time, their smiles dispelling the oppressive atmosphere in the ice palace like a scorching sun.

“If you want to take away Senior Sister, you must first step over my corpse!” Yang Kai suddenly said.

At the same time, Su Yan’s soft voice came out, “I pledge to live and die together with Junior Brother!”

The momentum of the pair suddenly soared as their Saint Qi burst out.

The Saint Qi of one person was of an extremely hot Yang Attribute, while the other was extremely cold Yin Attribute.

An unexpected change appeared next, as Yang Kai and Su Yan’s Saint Qi seemed to resonate and blend together.

More violent energy fluctuations came out suddenly.

Everyone’s complexion changed slightly as they turned their eyes towards the young man and woman standing side by side in front of them in shock.

Luo Hai’s eyes flashed as well, a look of amazement filling his face as if he had just discovered something extraordinary. Luo Li, who had been closing her eyes tightly, opened them at that moment as a strong light flashed across their depths.

Chi Huo also expressed surprise together with the other two Origin Kings present.

From an outsider’s perspective, Yang Kai and Su Yan seemed to become a single entity at this moment, their Second-Order and First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivations superimposing upon one another without the slightest conflict, directly reaching an intensity equivalent to the peak Third-Order.

“Interesting, this is a Dual Cultivation Technique, right?” Luo Hai frowned. With his profound knowledge, it was natural for him to see at a glance that Yang Kai and Su Yan had already reached an extremely deep level of connection. Otherwise, their two completely opposite Saint Qis would never have been able to merge together so perfectly.

“Bastard!” Chi Huo shouted.

In his opinion, Su Yan was already Wei Feng’s woman, but this woman had apparently dual cultivated with Yang Kai, this was nothing less than an insult to Brilliant Flame Sect.

Was retaining her purity not a pre-requisite for cultivating the Ice Jade Secret Art? How else could this scene be explained?

As soon as Chi Huo’s voice fell, a deafening roar suddenly sounded inside the ice palace. This roar was so deafening and majestic that it seemed to be able to shake the soul of any who heard it. When it rang out, everyone, including the three Origin Kings, felt their hearts jump.

As for the Ice Heart Valley Elders, all their expressions changed dramatically.

“This is...” Luo Hai stood up, tremblingly as he stared at the change Yang Kai was undergoing.

A golden aura suddenly shot out from Yang Kai’s body and quickly transformed into a massive golden phantom.

This phantom was more than a hundred meters long and radiated a blinding golden light, its hard scale armour shining like the strongest protection in the world, strong enough to resist any attack.

Two eyes the size of small houses and filled with endless majesty and indifference appeared and seemed to look down loftily from above.

Everyone felt a humble sense of insignificance before these eyes.

“A Golden Dragon!” Luo Hai’s eyes shot open as her tone of voice even rose slightly.

Staring fiercely at this golden phantom, it was as if he was witnessing something absolutely impossible.

Chi Huo stood in place, his eyes flashing with unreadable light.

He had not imagined that such amazing wealth was hidden in Yang Kai’s body!

[Did Luo Hai chase this boy to Scarlet Wave Star because of this? No, looking at Luo Hai’s face, he seems to have just learned about this as well.]

[Did this little brat have other secrets as well?]

Before Chi Huo’s thoughts could finish, however, another resounding voice rang out.

This sound was not as shocking as the previous Dragon Roar, but it seemed capable of piercing the Heavens themselves.

Accompanied by this cry, another ray of light shot out from Yang Kai’s body and flew above Su Yan’s head, transforming into a pure white phantom.

*Hua...*

This phantom unfurled its wings to a similar hundred-metre length as the Golden Dragon and a deep and profound chill suddenly filled the air. At that moment, the purest energy in the surrounding world began rapidly gathering towards Su Yan.

Luo Li’s expression changed dramatically this time as she stared at the massive white phantom above Su Yan’s head and exclaimed, “Ice Phoenix!”

“What!?” Luo Hai was thoroughly shocked this time and could no longer maintain his outwardly calm demeanour.

The Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix were both legendary Ancient Divine Spirits that had long gone extinct, but today, he saw both appear from Yang Kai.

Although this was not a real Golden Dragon or Ice Phoenix, the faint Source fluctuations radiating from them could not be faked.

In other words, these two phantoms possessed at least part of the Source strength from a True Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix that had died!

Just how much untold wealth was there on this boy! Luo Hai looked at Yang Kai with fiery eyes.

The strange domain of scorching heat and frigid cold expanded as Yang Kai and Su Yan stood side by side, an awe-inspiring aura radiating from their forms.

Pillars of golden and white light shot into the sky, like two giant swords cutting through the Heavens, parting the clouds in half.

All of Ice Heart Valley bore witness to this spectacle as they stood dumbfounded in place, not knowing what was happening.

The ice palace had become a ruin as the two completely opposite yet complimentary energies burst out, shattering any kind of protective barriers and Spirit Arrays.

The dozen or so Elders from Ice Heart Valley were forced to circulate their Secret Arts to resist the pervasive scorching heat and ice-cold air.

Wei Feng required Chi Huo’s protection to simply keep his life.

Out of everyone present, only the three Origin Kings could resist this horrible aura head-on without difficulty.

Ran Yun Ting was stunned as she stared blankly at Su Yan at this moment, a deep feeling of regret surging up in her heart.

She had told Yang Kai that Su Yan would fly from the branch to become a phoenix one day and that someone like him was not worthy of her.

But now, Su Yan had done just that. With the power of a true Ice Phoenix’s Source, she was fully capable of utilizing the Divine Abilities and strengths of an Ice Phoenix, essentially becoming one herself.

But all of this had been given to her by Yang Kai.

The Ice Phoenix Source had clearly flowed from Yang Kai’s body to Su Yan’s.

In this world, the only being capable of standing on par and walking together with a phoenix was a dragon.

Ran Yun Ting turned her gaze towards the massive Golden Dragon phantom above Yang Kai’s head and formed a silent, bitter smile.

The many Elders from Ice Heart Valley and even Luo Li herself wore similar expressions.

Luo Li had never anticipated the situation developing like this. If she had known, she would never have agreed to Chi Huo’s outrageous request, even if she needed to sacrifice all of Ice Heart Valley as the price.

What kind of Heaven defying opportunity was it to possess an Ice Phoenix’s Source? With this Source, the backlash from the Ice Jade Secret Art was no problem at all. Su Yan would surely lead Ice Heart Valley to a glorious future and reach heights she could only ever dream of.

Such a talent was worth the entire Sect using their lives to protect!

But unfortunately, she had pushed her away like a useless pawn, just to maintain the Sect’s pitiful existence.

The light in Luo Li’s eyes suddenly became a little dim as she coughed up a mouthful of blood.

She suddenly discovered that she had just made the biggest mistake of her life.
