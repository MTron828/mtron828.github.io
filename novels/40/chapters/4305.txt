Similarly, both the auras around Chu Liu Shan and Kong Feng fluctuated violently, seemingly ready to attack at any time.

Guo Nu revealed a troubled expression. He did not want to make an enemy of the Proprietress. Unfortunately, he could only side with Chu Liu Shan now that things had progressed to this point, so he sighed softly, “Junior Sister Lan, why must you do this?”

Yang Kai’s expression was extremely gloomy.

If it came down to a fight, the Proprietress would surely suffer a loss. Although both the Proprietress and Yue He were in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, they were still outnumbered. Leaving aside the fact that Chu Liu Shan and the others were also in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, even the Fourth-Order and Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters inspecting the ships were a formidable force that could not be ignored. It could be said that First Inn would definitely suffer a loss if it came down to a battle.

He was not willing to let the Proprietress and Yue He suffer because of him; thus, he sighed inwardly. [It’s so depressing to be weak. Even if I obtain something good, I can’t keep it. Do I really have to hand over the Seventh-Order Monster Core?]

Yang Kai was extremely reluctant. All the cultivation resources he obtained along his journey were the results of personal effort, great opportunities, and massive amounts of luck.

The Wood Element Power came from the Immortal Tree he obtained in his early years, which happened naturally. He later obtained the Fire Element Power by stealing the Golden Crow carcass from under the noses of a bunch of Open Heaven Realm Masters. It could be said to be a narrow escape from death. Next, obtaining the Earth Element Power was a daunting experience but not dangerous. He had picked up and refined the Monster Core of an Earth Attribute True Dragon. Nevertheless, it was only possible for him to find the Monster Core thanks to the Dragon Source in his body.

His Water Element Power came from the Moon Essence he obtained and refined in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, having to escape from Kun Sha at that time. Lastly, he obtained the Yang Element Power by refining the Seventh-Order Primordial Yang Profound Ginseng. Even that had come with quite a hefty price tag.

It had taken so much effort, and he had struggled so hard just to pave the way to advance directly into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm. All his efforts had been for the sake of a brighter future. He wanted to set foot in a wider sky and enjoy better scenery.

Obtaining the Seventh-Order Metal Element Monster Core this time had also been a lucky coincidence. Who could say whether he would come across another opportunity like this? What kind of dangers would he face to obtain the cultivation resources he needed again? How long would he have to wait?

Once he refined the Seventh-Order Monster Core, he would only be one step away from advancing into the Open Heaven Realm! How could he reconcile himself with the idea of falling short right at the last moment!? But, what could he do even if he was extremely reluctant? Under the current circumstances, a huge battle was inevitable unless he brought out the Seventh-Order Monster Core. It was a given that First Inn would be the one to suffer if a battle broke out.

The scene was tense and a battle could erupt at any time.

Yang Kai swore ruthlessly to himself, [Even if I have to destroy the Seventh-Order Monster Core, I will never sell it to Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven or allow Heavenly Sword Union to get their hands on it!]

At this moment, Senior Brother Mao, who had remained silent throughout the entire situation suddenly said, “Boy, do you have a Seventh-Order Monster Core in your possession?”

Yang Kai looked up and calmly replied, “There’s no such thing!”

Senior Mao Brother nodded lightly, “In that case, there’s nothing to be done here. You may leave.”

After saying that, he waved them away.

Everybody was dumbfounded by this turn of events and Kong Feng shouted, “Brother Mao!”

Senior Brother Mao asked coldly, “How can I help you, Brother Kong?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Kong Feng exclaimed, “This brat definitely has a Seventh-Order Monster Core in his possession! We can’t let him just leave like that; otherwise, it will lead to a huge problem in the future!”

Senior Brother Mao replied indifferently, “He claims that he does not have one. Why do you keep insisting otherwise? Do you want to snatch his Space Ring from him to check?”

“That...” Kong Feng was suddenly at a loss for words. [I can’t do something so shameless. No matter how brazen he is, this Yang Kai is still just a Junior. How can a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like myself snatch his Space Ring in public!?]

Even he could not act so shamelessly as it would severely tarnish his reputation and face. Otherwise, instead of trying to negotiate with Yang Kai, he would have simply stolen it from him directly.

“Junior Sister Lan, I apologise for the commotion.” Senior Brother Mao cupped his fist at the Proprietress, then he turned to the ship and shouted, “Are you done with the inspection!? If you’re done, then return immediately!”

The group of people who boarded the ship for inspection earlier quickly leaped down. After that, he waved his large hand, “Let them through!”

Nobody objected when he allowed them to pass. Chu Liu Shan and Kong Feng exchanged a glance with each other and were unhappy with the situation, but they were also unwilling to fall out with this Senior Brother Mao. The people from Great Battle Heaven were not to be trifled with.

“Many thanks, Senior Brother Mao!” The Proprietress gave Senior Brother Mao an elegant bow before she drove the ship towards the Territory Gate.

Before they left, Yang Kai’s expression changed when he heard a transmission from Senior Brother Mao, “Take care of yourself, kid.”

He nodded at Senior Brother Mao gratefully. He knew that if not for Senior Brother Mao speaking up at a critical moment, things would not have been resolved so smoothly today.

When the ship passed through the Territory Gate and vanished out of sight, Chu Liu Shan finally said, “Brother Mao, I heard that several Great Battle Heaven disciples became acquainted with Yang Kai inside the Blood Monster Cave Heaven.”

Senior Brother Mao glanced sideways at Chu Liu Shan and responded lightly, “You are very well-informed, Brother Chu. But, if you have time to worry about Great Battle Heaven disciples, why don’t you spend it figuring out a method to track Black Crow Divine Monarch’s whereabouts instead?”

Chu Liu Shan’s gaze flickered slightly. Staring in the direction of the Territory Gate, he gave a soft snort.

…

At the same time, on the ship, the Proprietress gave Yang Kai a strange look, “Are you acquainted with Great Battle Heaven?”

Yang Kai pondered the question, “Perhaps, it’s because I rescued several Great Battle Heaven disciples in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven.”

He couldn’t help thinking about Bu Lian Zhong and the others. Back at the swamp filled with countless Void Cracks, Yang Kai had helped the trapped Bu Lian Zhong and his companions to escape. It could be considered that he had saved their lives. It was just that he was separated from Bu Lian Zhong and the others when they later arrived at the blood lake.

In any case, Yang Kai had not taken such a trivial matter to heart. Rescuing Bu Lian Zhong and the others was just a matter of convenience. He never imagined that his actions would return to benefit him or that Great Battle Heaven would return the favour here.

The Proprietress immediately understood the situation and nodded lightly, “The people of Great Battle Heaven are upright and just. Since you rescued those Great Battle Heaven disciples, it makes sense why Senior Brother Mao reciprocated the favour just now.”

Yue He asked, “Young Master, did you really obtain a Seventh-Order Monster Core?”

Likewise, Old Bai looked over curiously.

These were people Yang Kai trusted friends and allies, so there was no need to hide anything from them. He nodded in response, “That’s right. But, it was a lucky coincidence. The Monster Beast was heavily injured in the first place, and I also used the Divine Ability Bead given to me by Proprietress from the outset. That’s how I managed to kill it.”

The Proprietress narrowed her eyes slightly, “What Elements are you missing now?”

Yang Kai replied, “After refining this Metal Element Power, then only the Yin Element will be left.”

Old Bai was shocked, “Only one left…”

It had not been long since Yang Kai came to the 3,000 Worlds, so it was shocking that he was going to advance into the Open Heaven Realm so soon!

Which Emperor Realm cultivator would not spend decades, if not centuries before advancing into the Open Heaven Realm? Very few people could successfully refine the Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements and advance into the Open Heaven Realm within a hundred years. The main reason was that finding suitable cultivation resources took much time, energy, and money.

This was true for any cultivator, including the disciples from the major Cave-Heavens and Paradises. The only exceptions were Core Disciples like Qu Hua Shang and Gu Pan who were carefully nurtured by the Sect and given basically unlimited resources.

Be that as it may, even Core Disciples like them would need to spend some time refining these resources and consolidating their foundations; therefore, it could take between several years to several decades just to refine the necessary Elements. Those with poorer aptitude would take an even longer time.

Soon, Old Bai became excited, “Tsk. Tsk. You’re going to advance directly into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm! Brat, you’re reaching the sky in a single step!”

If Yang Kai could advance directly into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm, it would be no different from ascending to the Heavens in one bound. Be it in terms of strength or status, there would be Earth-shaking changes.

...

On the other hand, the Proprietress and Yue He were not happy; instead, they looked at each other worriedly.

Yang Kai was already being targeted by the major Cave-Heavens and Paradises. Although it could be said that not every Cave-Heaven and Paradise was out to cause trouble for him, there would always be some.

Those Masters had been holding back from making a move personally because they were still concerned about their respective reputations. They did not wish to be seen as oppressing the weak. The main reason for their inaction was that they believed it would take much more time for Yang Kai to grow and develop. However, if news about the Seventh-Order Metal Element Monster Core spread out, some people might become desperate.

“Brat, you should focus on carefully refining the Metal Element Monster Core in retreat once you return. As for the Yin Element… I’ll search for you.” The Proprietress sent a transmission to Yang Kai.

She had warned him against taking this path in the past, but now that he was already so far down it, all she could do was support him as much as possible. She might not be able to acquire a Seventh-Order Yin Element treasure, but she certainly had more connections than him.

“En!” Yang Kai replied respectfully. Suddenly recalling something, he hurriedly took out a jade bottle and handed it over, “Proprietress, take a look at this and see if it will be useful for you!”

This jade bottle contained one of the Innate Open Heaven Pills that he obtained in the Blood Monster Divine Palace.

She took the bottle from him suspiciously, but after opening it and sweeping the contents with her Divine Sense, her expression changed drastically. She quickly resealed the jade bottle and glanced at Yang Kai in astonishment, “Where did you get this!?”

With how knowledgeable and experienced she was, she immediately understood what this Open Heaven Pill was, as well as its true origins.

Yang Kai of course answered her honestly.

Upon hearing his explanation, she returned the jade bottle to him, “This is useless to me right now. You should keep it for yourself. If I ever have a need for it in the future, I will ask you for it then.”

...

She had advanced directly into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so her cultivation would only reach its limit when she reached the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Taking this Open Heaven Pill now was a complete waste.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai understood that she was still restrained by the Heart Demon Oath she took in the past after hearing what she said. As long as Golden Rainbow Province and Boundless Altar remained standing, she would never be able to advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Otherwise, she could have advanced into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm even without the help of this Innate Open Heaven Pill!

Sighing softly, Yang Kai put the jade bottle away before adding, “In that case, please don’t forget to come to me when you need it.”

Yang Kai also secretly made a vow. [When I advance into the Open Heaven Realm, the first thing I’m going to do is eliminate Golden Rainbow Province and Boundless Altar to resolve her Heart Demon Oath]

Old Bai probably guessed Yang Kai’s intentions, so he secretly gave him a meaningful look, one that said ‘make sure to call me when that time comes.’

During his advancement into the Open Heaven Realm, Bai Qi nearly failed because of Qin Ji of Golden Rainbow Province and Ling Chun Qiu of Boundless Altar. If Yang Kai had not given him the World Source Liquid at the critical moment, he would not be standing here today. This blood feud never left Bai Qi’s thoughts and was something that would need to be repaid one day.
