Saying this, the Charm Demon actually turned around and made the request on Yang Kai’ behalf, but the Demon Kings she asked all shook their heads. They looked at Yang Kai as if he was dead meat, their expressions full of ridicule and mockery.

The Charm Demon turned back and looked at Yang Kai regretfully, “Little Brother, it’s not that Elder Sister is unwilling to help you, but they’re not willing to let you pass at all. What are you going to do?”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Regardless, I still have to thank Elder Sister. Please step aside first for now.”

“What are you planning to do?” The Charm Demon was taken aback.

Yang Kai said frankly, “If they’re not willing to retreat, then I can only use force. Elder Sister, your skin and body are delicate and soft, you should stand farther away to avoid being accidentally injured later.”

The Charm Demon was confounded and felt that Yang Kai’s words were ridiculous. For a boy no better than a Low-Rank Demon King, he sure talked big, was he tired of living? But seeing his serious expression, she asked again, “You mean… you want to force your way through?”

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded. If they wanted to fight, he’d humour them.

Raising his hand, the unadorned Mountains and Rivers Bell was summoned and an ancient and desolate aura burst forth from it. On the bell were magnificent patterns that gleamed with fascinating light while an oppressive force descended from the sky like an invisible hammer.

Feeling this suppressive force, the Demon Masters hovering in the sky paled. It felt as if there was a lofty mountain suddenly placed over their heads. Their insides churned, and they couldn’t breathe as they fell to the ground involuntarily.

Some of the weaker Demon Great Generals spurted blood as they flailed about to stabilize themselves. Be that as it may, they failed to hold their ground and plummeted from the sky one after another.

Even the Demon Kings with powerful cultivation found their movements impeded. Left with no choice, they used their respective Secret Techniques to free themselves of the suppression.

But suddenly, the Mountains and Rivers Bell grew bigger and fell straight from the sky. The enormous bell overshadowed quite a few Demon Kings, swallowing them like the mouth of a giant beast, inducing their panic-stricken shouts.

*Hong…*

The Mountains and Rivers Bell fell to the ground, quaking the entire Demon Fury City, causing many old and unsecured buildings to collapse.

Everyone and everything sunk into silence. All the Demon Race members’ eyes were filled with shock, gawking in the enormous bell’s direction. At this moment, several Demon Kings with fairly good cultivations were suppressed under the bell and one of them was ranked among the top ten Masters of Demon Fury City.

But even such a powerful Demon King failed to react before this fearsome attack. And now, who knows whether he was dead or alive.

Very soon, the answer was revealed to everyone.

Yang Kai made a few hand seals as the Mountains and Rivers Bell slowly grew smaller and smaller before flying back to his hand, leaving several mutilated corpses on the ground, each one flattened like a biscuit as if they had been smashed down with a hammer.

Everyone gasped in shock at the sight of this. Many Demon Race Masters had their faces go pale while the Demon Kings who had ridiculed Yang Kai just now could no longer utter a word. Their hearts had been gripped with fear and all of them unconsciously took a step back, trying to distance themselves from Yang Kai.

Just a casual attack caused such devastation here, so who could stand against this Human in Demon Fury City? Even the strongest Demon Kings couldn’t achieve such a feat with a single blow. If anyone really provoked this person, perhaps the entire Demon Fury City would be destroyed!

*Gudong…*

The now pale Charm Demon made a nervously gulp and stuttered, “Little Brother, you’re really too bad, pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger and scare all of us. Elder Sister was almost scared to death,” She somehow squeezed a smile out, but it looked uglier than if she were crying. Her voice was shaky and it was obvious how frightened she was right now.

Although she was also a Demon King, her strength was at the lower end among the Masters of Demon Fury City. If such an attack was launched at her, she would have definitely had a miserable end.

It wasn’t until this moment she finally realized that this harmless looking Human with an amiable smile actually wielded such destructive power.

Yang Kai, holding the Mountains and Rivers Bell, shook his head in denial, “Elder Sister, you’re mistaken.”

“How so?” The Charm Demon asked while grumbling in her heart. All she knew was that a wrong word from her now might bring about her doom. Her figure involuntarily trembled when she took a glance at the little bell in horror.

Yang Kai replied with a serious look on his face, “I never said that I’m not a tiger, so how can I be pretending?”

“En, en, you’re right,” the Charm Demon nonchalantly replied, “They had eyes but failed to see. They were dogs looking down on others. They deserved to die.”

Yang Kai smiled and continued, “Elder Sister, it has been a pleasure talking to you, I can’t help but want to continue our lovely conversation, but what can I do, I still have pressing matters to attend to.”

“Hehe…” The Charm Demon’s face turned stiff and promptly stepped aside, “Since Little Brother has such important matters awaiting him, he should quickly go and not delay.”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded in agreement, “Then this Young Master will take his leave first. No one is going to stop me now, right?”

The Charm Demon denied, shaking her head, “Naturally; no one here is blind.”

Many Demon Kings’ faces turned grim but none dared to say anything. They were afraid that if their tongue slipped and they somehow ended up provoking this Human again, a few more would have to part with their lives.

“That’s good,” Yang Kai winked at the Charm Demon, “Elder Sister doesn’t need to be sad or worried, it’s not like this Young Master will never come back. When I do, perhaps we can share a romantic evening together. At that time, Elder Sister will come to know the charm of this Little Brother.”

[Where am I sad or worried?] The Charm Demon cursed in her heart but she didn’t dare to show it.

The crowd of Demon Kings’ faces turned incomparably ugly. They were terrified by Yang Kai’s words and wanted nothing more than for him to quickly scram and hopefully die on Yin Wind Mountain. Many wished they could go up and push him along so he would move faster.

Fortunately, Yang Kai didn’t continue with this little game, otherwise, the Demon Kings would have been driven mad. Swiftly, he boarded the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, which then soared through the air before flying straight towards Yin Wind Mountain.

The Charm Demon finally heaved a sigh of relief and only now did she realize that her entire back was drenched in sweat as a cold breeze hit her, sending her shivering.

Noticing the pairs of eyes gazing at her, the Charm Demon grit her teeth and shouted, “What’re you looking at? I didn’t kill them.”

“You shouldn’t have told him so much,” a Demon King with a majestic aura coldly snorted. Demon Fury City had never suffered such an insult before. A mere Human had broken into the city and wantonly slaughtered a few Demon Kings, yet none could stop him.

The Demons all felt ashamed and needed a scapegoat to blame.

The Charm Demon was the only one among them who spoke to Yang Kai directly, so she was obviously the best choice here.

“Are you blaming me?” The Charm Demon lashed out in a sharp voice, feeling quite wronged.

“If you haven’t chatted with him, why would Demon Fury City face this undeserved catastrophe?”

The Charm Demon dumbfoundedly gawked at the speaking Demon King as she truly hadn’t expected to be accused with such a flippant reason.

“Hm? Someone else is approaching!” That Demon King turned his head and saw a handsome red-haired young man meandering over. This young man however had a gloomy look and tight frown on his face, clearly annoyed about something.

He flew straight into Demon Fury City without a care in the world, completely disregarding all the Demon Race Masters as if he was taking a stroll in his own backyard.

The Demon Kings blew their tops.

Demon Fury City had stood in the Revolving World for over ten thousand years, but when had it ever been despised like this? Forget about that Human who, although had low cultivation, possessed a treasure which was completely overpowered, just who the Hell did this red-haired Human think he was?

After looking around and exchanging eye signals with each other, many Demon Race Masters immediately flew up into the air, blocking the red-haired young man’s way.

Zhu Lie stopped and coldly glared towards the front, the anger in his heart on the very edge of erupting.

Zhu Qing and Yang Kai’s relationship had left him extremely irritated, but what was done could not be undone, leaving him with a problem without a solution. He was left with nowhere to vent his anger, and now someone presented themselves on a silver plate.

He took a deep breath and indifferently asked, trying his very best to calm himself down, “Which one of you is the strongest?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

This question was rather baffling but many Demons subconsciously glanced toward a certain direction. Before everyone’s eyes, a Demon King with a robust waist and soaring Demon Qi stepped forward and replied in a thunderous voice, “This King is Hao Fei, who are you?”

It was the very same guy who was reprimanding the Charm Demon before. He was acknowledged by all the Demon Kings here as the strongest and was just a step away from breaking the shackles of the world to reach the Demon Saint Realm.

He was confident that he would break through within a century, and as long as he could become a Demon Saint, he could attack Human Imperial City and finally break the unchanging pattern of the Revolving World, enslaving all Humans and turning this place into a paradise for the Demon Race once and for all.

He had such ambitions and also had the potential to achieve them.

When Yang Kai had just used the Mountains and Rivers Bell to launch that terrifying attack, he reckoned that he couldn’t take the blow after weighing his chances a little, so he swallowed his pride and arrogance, but at this moment, he couldn’t remain hiding in his shell like a turtle.

The Demon Race was belligerent by nature and respected strength above all else. If he hadn’t answered, he would have been looked down upon by his clansmen, and most importantly, it would be detrimental to his own cultivation.

He secretly made up his mind to humiliate this red-haired young man and let him know the strength of Demon Fury City’s strongest Master.

He disdainfully stared ahead, his eyes indifferent, seemingly not putting anyone in them.

In response, Zhu Lie lightly threw out one word, “Die!”

Just as he said this, his figure left a fiery trail as he shot straight towards the Demon King named Hao Fei like a meteor.

Hao Fei’s expression changed as the moment Zhu Lie made his move, he instinctively sensed his opponent’s strength and hurriedly pushed his Demon Qi to resist.

*Roar~*

A deafening dragon roar suddenly rang out, causing everyone’s ears to ache.

This dragon roar seemed to contain a very peculiar power that caused any who heard it to momentarily freeze.

Hao Fei was shocked and hurriedly tried to protect his mind while shaking off this crisis.

But at this moment, his vision was suddenly filled with fiery red, as if the entire world was burning. The next instant, an enormous dragon head appeared out of nowhere, shrouding the entire world, its enormous eye gazing down at him arrogantly, causing Hao Fei’s entire figure to turn stiff as his hands and feet went cold.
