Thunderous rumbles shook the world, wind blew fierce as the Sun and Moon dimmed.

Many weaker cultivators who didn’t know what was happening couldn’t help but bow their heads and pray to the Heavens when they saw this.

Miao Fei Ping’s aura surged as the might of his Grand Dao filled the air. He then looked down and started speaking, his voice shook the world, “After my breakthrough to the Open Heaven Realm, this World will no longer be able to accommodate me. After my departure, the Void Dao Temple will choose a person to serve as the Temple Master. My Fellow Brothers and Sisters, please assist them.”

Saying so, he turned his head towards Seven Stars Sect and nodded slightly before taking a step forward.

When his feet landed, space shattered like a mirror.

Everyone who saw this scene was shocked.

After a long time, the shattered Void gradually returned to its usual state, but when they looked again, Miao Fei Ping was nowhere to be seen. He had disappeared without a trace. The entire world was devoid of his aura.

He had shattered the Void and left this World!

Many of the Emperor Realm Masters’ hearts skipped a beat.

Judging by what Miao Fei Ping had said, he had already broken through to the Open Heaven Realm. Void World was unable to contain him after breaking through to the Open Heaven Realm, so he had no choice but to shatter the Void and leave. Although they didn’t know where he would go after leaving this world, it was obvious he had gone to a place with a higher Martial Dao.

This was the first person to break the shackles of the Emperor Realm and break free from the barriers of the World, causing a sensation that shook Void World and which would not be forgotten for hundreds of years.

At this moment, in addition to the shock brought about by Miao Fei Ping’s shattering the Void, the various Sects and Deacons were also concerned about something else.

It was who was going to be the next Temple Master.

The Void Dao Temple had only been founded 100 years ago, but all of the disciples it had taken in these past 100 years were extremely talented. In just a short time, these people had achieved many things that ordinary cultivators would never be able to achieve in their lifetime.

One could imagine how these disciples would become the cornerstones of the entire Void World in the future. They might even advance to the Open Heaven Realm, shatter the Void, and leave, just like Miao Fei Ping.

Who would not want to have such a powerful force in their hands? Be that as it may, Miao Fei Ping, the first Temple Master, was chosen by the Dao Temple. And before he left, he said that the next Temple Master would be chosen by the Dao Temple.

Who would be appointed as the next Temple Master?

Many Sect Masters were already thinking about how to contribute so that their Elders or Deacons could become the next Temple Master.

Nonetheless, their various plans and schemes were destined to be futile.

As soon as Miao Fei Ping left, a beam of light descended from the Dao Temple towards one of the Deacons.

At the same time, all the Deacons received a message.

[The second Temple Master is Tang Wen!]

Tang Wen himself hadn’t expected that the position of the Temple Master would fall upon his head, so he couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. It wasn’t until the various Deacons all paid their respects to him that he reacted.

Just as Miao Fei Ping had stated, Tang Wen was steady and virtuous, so even though he had obtained the position of Temple Master, his conduct was still the same as before. He quickly raised his hand and addressed everyone, “Fellow Deacons, please don’t think that things will change after this, treat me like before, there is no need to be so polite. I hope everyone can help me in the future. This Tang will manage the Void Dao Temple together with all of you and will not let down the World, nor Temple Master Miao.”

Much to Seven Stars Sect’s disappointment, the second Temple Master position had actually fallen on Tang Wen. Nonetheless, they felt much more at ease after thinking about the various cultivation resources that the Ancestor had bestowed upon them over the years. They believed that the Ancestor must have had his own reasons for doing something like this; there would be no Seven Stars Sect today without the Ancestor after all. So, although they were disappointed, they didn’t complain and instead worked even harder to cooperate with the Void Dao Temple.

The matter of the Void Dao Temple had come to an end. Miao Fei Ping’s breakthrough to the Open Heaven Realm and his act of shattering the Void had been a sensation throughout the world, causing the Emperor Realm Masters to cultivate even more diligently. Everyone yearned to break through to the Open Heaven Realm as soon as possible.

At the same time, on a universe fragment outside Blue Sky Pass, Miao Fei Ping was advancing to the Open Heaven Realm.

When the Emperor Realm Masters of Void World witnessed him shatter the Void and leave, they all thought he had broken through to the Open Heaven Realm, but in reality, he was just following Yang Kai’s script.

He didn’t know why the Ancestor was doing this, but since it was a request from the Ancestor, he naturally would follow it to the dot.

After leaving Void World, Miao Fei Ping began his true breakthrough to the Open Heaven Realm.

His aptitude was originally only enough for him to advance to the Fifth Order, but because of the World Tree clone’s feedback, he could now advance to the Sixth Order, though he had to take some risks.

No one could help him break through to the Open Heaven Realm, not even Yang Kai. The only help he could provide was some experience in breaking through to the next Realm for reference.

On the universe fragment, not only was Yang Kai here, but also Feng Ying and Bai Yi. They were naturally not here to watch a spectacle, but to stand guard; after all, this place was on the outskirts of Blue Sky Pass, and the Black Ink Clan had been a little reckless these days. If some ignorant Black Ink Clansman came here and disturbed Miao Fei Ping’s breakthrough, it would be a disaster for the latter.

Fortunately, everything went quite smoothly with no Black Ink Clan interference and no dangerous moments during the breakthrough. By the time the dust settled, Miao Fei Ping had advanced to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Yang Kai, looking at his excited face, couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

He recalled how he met Miao Fei Ping for the first time when he was just a boy; he was quite a mischievous kid who bullied Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya from time to time, relying on his age. It wasn’t really bullying though, just children being children.

Years had gone by in the blink of an eye, and now that boy had broken through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Seeing the sight before him, Yang Kai couldn’t help wondering how his three Disciples were doing; however, Yang Kai estimated that they had yet to break through to the Open Heaven Realm.

It wasn’t that his Disciples’ aptitudes were worse than Miao Fei Ping’s. Zhao Ye Bai was indeed lacking in terms of talent, but Zhao Ya’s aptitude was incomparable, and his Third Disciple, Xu Yi’s aptitude wasn’t bad either. Furthermore, since all three of his Disciples had obtained one of his Grand Dao’s true inheritances, their future prospects were limitless.

The reason Miao Fei Ping had advanced so quickly was mainly because he had been living in Yang Kai’s Small Universe and had spent a different amount of time cultivating compared to his three Disciples.

Recalling how this brat came from his own Small Universe, Yang Kai suddenly felt like was watching his own child grow up.

“Ancestor!” Miao Fei Ping excitedly walked over to Yang Kai, obviously unable to contain his joy at the success of his breakthrough, “Disciple has not disappointed Ancestor’s expectations and successfully advanced to the Open Heaven Realm.”

Yang Kai lightly nodded his acknowledgement, “Advancing to the Open Heaven Realm is just the beginning. You are now a Sixth-Order Master, so you have a high chance of advancing to the Eighth-Order in the future. However, the cultivation of the Open Heaven Realm focuses on accumulating strength over a long period of time. You must not become arrogant or impatient, never try to rashly push yourself to advance.”

Miao Fei Ping respectfully replied, “Disciple will remember!”

Afterwards, he turned to Feng Ying and Bai Yi and bowed, thanking, “Many thanks, Martial Aunts, for protecting me.”

Feng Ying waved her hand and stated, “It was nothing, don’t mind it.” Bai Yi, on the other hand, had a reserved personality and simply nodded without saying anything.

Feng Ying continued, “But brat, you call him Ancestor, yet you call us Martial Aunts. The seniority is a mess. You’ve actually lowered our status by several generations.”

Miao Fei Ping didn’t know how to respond.

Yang Kai suggested as a smile appeared on his lips, “You’re right. How about this, don’t call me Ancestor from now on, just call me Martial Uncle.”

“How… how can I do that?” Miao Fei Ping looked distraught.

Yang Kai stated, “On this Black Ink Battlefield, all Humans only have one relationship, fellow comrades who share life and death. Whether it’s Ancestor or Martial Uncle, they’re all just titles. If you find it difficult to call me Martial Uncle, you can just call me Squad Leader.”

Miao Fei Ping honestly replied, “Disciple will call you Martial Uncle.”

“It’s up to you.” Yang Kai smiled, “Let’s go, I’ll bring you back to the Great Pass to register yourself. You’ve just arrived here, you still have a lot to learn.”

After leading Miao Fei Ping back to Blue Sky Pass, Yang Kai took him to the Western Army Headquarters and went to Zhong Liang, explaining Miao Fei Ping’s origins. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Zhong Liang was already aware that Yang Kai’s Small Universe had many Humans living in it. Moreover, these Army Commanders were very optimistic about the future of these Humans because of the existence of the World Tree clone.

Be that as it may, a cultivator needed time to grow, so no one had expected to see results so quickly.

Today, there was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, tomorrow, there would be more Sixth-Order and even Seventh-Order Masters! These Masters would become the backbone of the resistance against the Black Ink Clan.

As such, Zhong Liang readily registered Miao Fei Ping and issued him an Identity Token.

Under Yang Kai’s request, Miao Fei Ping was assigned to the Dawn Squad, becoming a member of the Squad.

Afterwards, Miao Fei Peng had to find a place to live. Blue Sky Pass had many places for the soldiers to live though, and many of these were unoccupied, so this was not an issue.

After Miao Fei Ping asked about Yang Kai’s residence, he chose a place nearby, not minding anything else.

In any case, he was still a newcomer. He didn’t have any Military Merits to speak of, and because he had just advanced, he needed time and resources to consolidate his cultivation.

Without Military Merits, he did not have anything to exchange for cultivation resources. Fortunately, Yang Kai had a lot of resources on hand so he gave him a few and told him to go back and cultivate. Miao Fei Ping naturally didn’t dare disobey his orders.

On the way back, Miao Fei Ping uneasily asked, “Martial Uncle, the show I put on before I left looked quite spectacular, but if someone else were to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, wouldn’t it be exposed?”

Yang Kai explained with a smile, “In the current Void World, who else do you think has a chance to break through to the Open Heaven Realm besides you?”

Miao Fei Ping answered, “There are many of them, and although they’re all completing the Powers in their Dao Seals right now, a few will reach that Realm some day or the other, there is quite a good chance of that happening.”

“Yes, there are many of them, but they are different from you. You can leave Void World and come to Blue Sky Pass, but others cannot.”

“Why?”

Yang Kai pointed around and asked, “Look carefully, what’s common about everyone here?”

Miao Fei Ping observed them for a moment before replying, “All of them are Fifth-Order Masters and above. Even Fifth-Order Masters are rare, basically all of them are Sixth-Order and above.”

“That’s right, basically everyone here is a Sixth-Order Master or higher because this is the Black Ink Battlefield where we are fighting against the Black Ink Clan. If their Order is too low, they won’t be of much help here. In fact, even the Fifth-Order Masters you’re seeing are only in that Realm because their cultivations regressed from the Sixth-Order.”

Miao Fei Ping pondered for a moment before asking, “Does Martial Uncle mean that those who cannot break through directly to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm are not qualified to come here?”

“Precisely.”

“Disciple understands,” Understanding suddenly dawned upon Miao Fei Ping.
