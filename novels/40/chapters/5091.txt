“The Royal Lord takes this matter extremely seriously. Since Nie An is trying to achieve a breakthrough, I believe the Royal Lord will give him all the support he needs. The Royal Lord might even personally assist him. If the Royal Lord makes a move, Nie An might be able to succeed.”

The success of Nie An’s breakthrough was related to the Black Ink Clan’s future, so it was expected that Mu Guang wouldn’t sit on the sidelines.

Yang Kai initially thought that Nie An wouldn’t succeed in ascending to the Eighth Order; however, he wasn’t so sure now if Mu Guang decided to help. No one knew what methods the Royal Lord had.

Regardless, this matter had to be dealt with accordingly; otherwise, even if Yang Kai managed to take all of the Artifact Refiners away from this Sealed World, he still couldn’t stop the Black Ink Clan from carrying out their plan.

This made him fall into a dilemma. He initially intended to execute his plan today, but a variable like Nie An came out of nowhere all of a sudden.

Fortunately, there was still room for manoeuvre. At this moment, Yang Kai was relieved that this Sealed World was not filled with Black Ink Strength; otherwise, his plan would have come to a halt at this point.

Presently, he had to make some changes.

After giving it a thought, he said, “Senior Brother Wu, we have to confirm whether Nie An is dead or alive. It would be great if he lost his life during his breakthrough; however, if he returns safely, that’ll mean he’s successfully become a Great Grandmaster. By then, the Warship will be perfected.”

“What do you want to do?” Wu Xing He asked.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t have a solution right now, we can only wait. After all, it’s not like we can ask the Black Ink Clan about it. During this period of time, you have to be cautious to avoid coming into direct contact with the Black Ink Clan. There’s no ambient Black Ink Strength in this Sealed World, so as long as you don’t get too close to the Black Ink Clansmen, you won’t be corrupted. If you happen to be invaded by Black Ink Strength, you have to immediately inform me and I will purify it for you.”

“Got it.” Wu Xing He nodded, then said, “As for Wang Si Bo and Guan Ning, do you want to dispel their Black Ink Strength only when you’re in the final stages of the plan, or do you want to act in advance?”

Yang Kai asked, “What do you think?”

After pondering on it for a moment, Wu Xing He replied, “The risk will be increased if we act now; after all, even if they regain their Human nature, they’ll still be at risk of getting corrupted again. However, they’re Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and Artifact Refining Grandmasters; what’s more, they frequently come into contact with me. Guan Ning is especially sensitive, so I’m worried that I’ll accidentally expose myself…”

“We’ll act in advance, then.” Yang Kai directly made a decision, “I’ll need you to work closely with me.”

“Got it. I’ll inform you when everything is prepared,” Wu Xing He nodded.

“Also, I want to take control of this Sealed World’s portal; that way, it’ll be easier for us to flee when executing the plan.”

Upon hearing that, Wu Xing He shook his head, “That won’t be easy. Mei Qiong has never left the portal over the years. How are you going to take control of it?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I have my own methods; however, I’ll have to pass through the portal.”

“Does that mean you have to leave this Sealed World once?” Wu Xing He asked.

Yang Kai nodded, “En. Do you have any idea how we can do it?”

After a moment of deliberation, Wu Xing He replied, “I can have you head to the Royal City to buy some materials for me. I believe the Black Ink Clan won’t turn me down.”

“That sounds good.”

“However, there will be a Black Ink Clansman who will follow you. The two Territory Lords will never leave this Sealed World, so the person who will go with you will most likely be a Feudal Lord.”

“That’s fine. I’ll make sure that the Feudal Lord won’t notice whatever I do.”

Since the other man was so confident, Wu Xing He stopped trying to dissuade him.

After they discussed the matter for a while longer, Yang Kai left and returned to his own house to get some rest.

A few days later, Qing Lei was seated on the platform that was above the mountain valley. As he looked down, he was able to monitor everything that was going on in the mountain valley from his position. No anomalies could be hidden from him.

With that said, nothing major had happened since the day he started guarding this place and the Human Artifact Refiners had always been working hard to perfect the Warship. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unfortunately, many years had passed, but the thing they created was still not usable.

Just then, a figure shot up from the valley and landed in front of him.

Qing Lei lifted his gaze and realised that this person was one of the Artifact Refining Grandmasters, Wu Xing He.

Wu Xing He saluted him respectfully, “Sir Qing Lei.”

“What’s wrong?” Qing Lei asked impassively.

Wu Xing He replied, “I need some materials that we are running low on in this Sealed World. Will you please allow me to go to the Royal City to buy them?”

Upon hearing that, Qing Lei furrowed his brows, “What materials do you need that have to be purchased in the Royal City?”

Wu Xing He randomly mentioned some materials, which were all quite precious.

Qing Lei replied, “Got it. I’ll tell someone to send them to you.” Although those materials were valuable, there was never a lack of resources in the Black Ink Clan; moreover, this project was related to the Black Ink Clan’s future, so the Royal Lord was fully supportive of it. Regardless of what materials they needed, they just had to make a request, and someone from the Royal City would send them over.

Wu Xing He seemed to have expected this kind of response, so he said, “Sir, the quality of these materials is critical. Someone who is not proficient in Artifact Refining might not be able to fight the appropriate ones. As such, I have to personally head to the Royal City.”

“You want to personally go there?” Qing Lei was surprised. In the past, Wu Xing He had asked for more materials on several occasions, but he only came over and told him what he needed, and the materials would be sent to him. He had never requested to personally head to the Royal City.

Wu Xing He nodded, “I have to go there to make sure that all the materials are up to standard so that the progress won’t be held up. Some of the materials they sent us previously were substandard and could not be used.”

Qing Lei became fidgety, “You and the other two Grandmasters are in charge of this project now. If you’re gone, who will continue developing the Warship?”

After giving it a thought, Wu Xing He suggested by saying, “Why don’t I tell someone to go over there on my behalf?”

Qing Lei asked, “Who is it?”

Wu Xing He replied, “The newcomer, Yang Kai. His aptitude in Artifact Refining is just as good as mine, so he’ll definitely grow to be a Grandmaster one day.”

Qing Lei didn’t understand what aptitude in Artifact Refining had to do with the purchase of materials; however, since Wu Xing He had recommended this person, he decided to stop questioning him. He thus nodded, “He’ll be the one, then. I’ll tell someone to accompany him.”

Saying so, he waved his hand.

The next moment, a Feudal Lord behind him stepped forward.

Qing Lei ordered, “Bring that Human to the Royal City and come back quickly.” Then, he passed a token to the Feudal Lord.

After taking the token, the Feudal Lord flew towards the mountain valley alongside Wu Xing He.

A moment later, Wu Xing He called out to Yang Kai, who was getting some rest in his place. As Yang Kai was told what to do, he nodded.

“You have to come back quickly,” Wu Xing He ordered with a solemn expression.

Yang Kai stared fixedly at him and nodded, “Don’t worry, Senior Brother Wu. I’ll come back as soon as possible.”

He then said to the Feudal Lord on the side, “Please.”

Without saying anything, the Feudal Lord led Yang Kai to fly towards the portal.

When they arrived at the portal, the Feudal Lord passed the token to Mei Qiong, who was guarding this place. Since the token was authentic, they were allowed to leave.

The moment the portal was opened, Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord subsequently dashed out of it.

In the blink of an eye, the Feudal Lord passed through the portal and arrived in the outside void. When he turned his head though, he realised that Yang Kai was nowhere in sight.

This startled him for a moment, for it had never happened before. Supposedly, since they entered the portal at the same time, they should reappear together. Nevertheless, he was the only one there at the moment while Yang Kai was missing.

While he was puzzled, the portal before his eyes contorted slightly. Following that, Yang Kai’s figure came into his sight.

Although he found the incident strange, he didn’t read too much into it and just beckoned to Yang Kai, “Let’s go.”

He then flew towards the Royal City.

The Sealed World wasn’t far away from the Royal City. When Yang Kai was led to the Sealed World from the Royal City back then, it only took them an hour to arrive.

Therefore, one hour later, Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord came to the Royal City. With the Feudal Lord leading the way, they soon reached a street where all sorts of resources were sold.

It took Yang Kai another hour to purchase all the materials that Wu Xing He wanted.

Yang Kai didn’t intend to stay in the Royal City for long, and the Feudal Lord apparently wanted to go back as soon as possible; hence, they soon left the Royal City.

One hour later, before they arrived at the Sealed World’s portal, Yang Kai felt that something was coming from behind. When he turned his head, he saw a large ship charging forward in their direction. In the blink of an eye, the large ship got very close to them.

Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord certainly noticed it. Seeing that the large ship wasn’t going to stop, they quickly moved to the side.

Even so, Yang Kai was almost hit by the large ship.

Upon stabilising himself, he lifted his gaze and saw that the large ship had moved across several hundred kilometres ahead. He frowned at the sight.

Although the large ship had brushed past him quickly, he clearly detected two powerful auras from the vessel. One of them was a Territory Lord while the other was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Putting the Territory Lord aside, the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master gave off a violent and dangerous aura, as though he would explode at any moment.

Yang Kai was astonished. He had pretended to be a Black Ink Disciple and snuck into the Black Ink Clan’s territory twice, but he had never come across an Eighth-Order Black Ink Disciple before.

Usually, an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master wouldn’t be corrupted by Black Ink Strength unless a Royal Lord personally made a move. However, in every major battle, the Royal Lord would have to deal with an Old Ancestor from the Humans’ side, so they wouldn’t have any spare energy to use their Secret Technique to corrupt Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. If they did so, they would be giving the Old Ancestor a chance to injure them.

Hence, there were some Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciples, but Eighth-Order Black Ink Disciples were extremely rare.

The direction the large ship was heading suggested that it was going to the Sealed World.

A strange idea suddenly sprang into Yang Kai’s mind.

[Would it be so coincidental?]

The Feudal Lord turned to look at Yang Kai, and upon making sure that the latter was fine, he continued moving forward without saying a word. Yang Kai quickly followed him.

A short while later, they arrived at the Sealed World’s portal. At this moment, a large ship was parked in the void as it was waiting for the portal to open. The large ship was the one that Yang Kai had seen earlier.
