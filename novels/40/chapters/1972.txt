“Is having more people useful?” Xu Qing sneered as he looked at Yang Kai contemptuously, “How much strength can the two of you exert at this moment?”

From his point of view, Yang Kai had just stood in front of Mo Xiao Qi to resist the Firebird’s attack, which must have caused him a great deal of consumption. After that, Yang Kai had even been contaminated with those black flames, so even being alive was pure luck.

As for Mo Xiao Qi, after she used her water sphere artifact, she looked ready to collapse.

The two of them were obviously not at their peaks and should not be able to display too much strength.

On the other hand, he was in good condition, so he did not fear them.

Yang Kai just chuckled lightly and said, “If Brother Xu really thinks so, then you might as well give it a try.”

Seeing Yang Kai look so confident and composed, Xu Qing could not help frowning, wondering whether Yang Kai was just acting mysterious or was truly confident.

Nearby, Mo Xiao Qi still stood there with a despondent look on her face as she stared towards the now soulless Xu Ruo Mei and muttered, “Why did you try to attack me?”

Yang Kai turned his head to glance at her and couldn’t help snapping, “Idiot, men die for wealth like birds die for food, don’t you understand such a simple truth? Did your parents not tell you this before you ran out?”

“I didn’t,” Mo Xiao Qi shook her head vigorously, a look of panic flashing across her eyes as she waved her hands at Yang Kai. “You absolutely cannot tell my father I am here, or he’ll punch me!”

“I don’t even know your father, how am I supposed to tell him?” Yang Kai nearly coughed up blood when he heard this completely out of place response.

“That’s right!” Mo Xiao Qi suddenly showed a look of relief.

“Enough!” When Xu Qing saw the two of them continue to banter back and forth like he was not even there, he lost his calm and roared angrily and snapped, “Brother Yang, if you don’t want to die, leave now, you have no reason to fight with this Xu.”

Yang Kai chuckled as he glanced faintly towards Xu Qing and said, “We truly have no reason to be hostile with one another, but... what Brother Xu can think of, this Yang can also understand.”

Xu Qing was taken aback for a moment as he looked at Yang Kai in surprise before saying with some amazement, “Brother Yang really conceals himself deeply, but if that’s the case, why do we not work together? We can split the spoils half and half.”

“No, no,” Yang Kai shook his head before pointing to himself and saying. “If I have one shortcoming, it’s that I always like to eat alone, I don’t like sharing with others. If Brother Xu understands his limits, he should leave now before it’s too late.”

“Isn’t Brother Yang afraid he won’t be able to stomach so much by himself?”

“I have a good appetite!”

Mo Xiao Qi looked at the two of them blankly as she interjected, “What are you going to eat? I have some spirit fruits here; would you like them?”

Saying so, she really took out two tender looking spirit fruits from her Space Ring. The moment these fruits appeared, a rich fragrance filled the air, and judging from the energy fluctuations coming from them, they were obviously not ordinary fruits but instead rare treasures.

“Even if you don’t speak, no one will think you’re a mute!” Yang Kai glared at her angrily.

Mo Xiao Qi instantly felt wronged.

“Hmph, since Brother Yang has said so, is there no room for discussion?” Xu Qing gulped as his eyes became slightly red. Everything Mo Xiao Qi took out from her Space Ring stimulated his greed further and he became even more convinced that there were countless treasures hidden she was still hiding.

He was certain that if he could grab this Space Ring, he would not have to worry about cultivation resources for the rest of his lifetime, so how could Xu Qing endure?

“From the moment Brother Xu attacked me, we had nothing to discuss,” Yang Kai sneered.

“Good! Then let this Xu test whether Brother Yang is capable of backing up his words or not!” As soon as Xu Qing’s voice fell, his power suddenly surged and his physique began to rapidly inflate.

The clothes on his body began to rip and were soon torn to shreds while at the same time, countless golden hairs began to sprout from Xu Qing’s bare skin.

After just three breaths, Xu Qing’s entire image had undergone tremendous changes.

Now, he was more than five meters tall and had a slightly hunched figure with unusually long arms, rippling muscles, and bloodshot eyes. From his throat, a bestial roar rang out and together with the thick golden hair that covered his entire body, he looked exactly like a giant golden ape.

Yang Kai was quite shocked.

It was the first time that he had seen this kind of Secret Technique, at least, there were no Secret Techniques that would allow one to assume the form of a Monster Beast in his native Star Field. This only went to show how full of mysteries and wonders the Star Boundary really was.

However, what surprised Yang Kai more was that even in the dangerous situation they were in earlier, Xu Qing had actually held back such a card, yet was now not hesitating to use it to deal with him.

“Beast Soul Symbiosis? Golden Hair Giant Ape?” Mo Xiao Qi exclaimed from the side, her beautiful eyes trembling slightly before she made a move that Yang Kai found difficult to believe.

She actually lifted both her hands and covered her eyes, not daring to look at Xu Qing who was now practically naked, most of his ‘vitals’ exposed to the air.

[This silly girl!] Yang Kai had nothing to say as he completely gave up any idea of relying on her help in the coming battle.

Meanwhile, Xu Qing, who had displayed his trump card Secret Technique, roared before he transformed into a streak of golden light that rushed directly towards Yang Kai.

A fist bigger than a carriage smashed down at the same time, with a force that seemed capable of crushing mountains and splitting seas.

[Quite fast!]

Yang Kai instantly realized how difficult an opponent Xu Qing would be, and after taking a deep breath, he stabilized his stance to meet the approaching fist with one of his own.

A look of mockery appeared in Xu Qing’s eyes as he sneered, “Want to stop my punch? Don’t be so presumptuous!”

The huge fist fell even faster as Xu Qing added more strength to it.

*Hong...*

There was a loud bang and Yang Kai snorted as half his body was beaten into the ground while Xu Qing’s five-meter-tall body also staggered backwards, almost flying out directly.

His golden-haired face filled with astonishment as he never expected Yang Kai’s physical power to be so immense, but he still quickly stabilized his figure and raised his other fist up high before slamming it down with the force of a falling meteor, causing an ear-splitting roar of wind as it cut through the air.

Yang Kai was half-buried at the moment so he could not move freely and had no way to avoid this blow.

With no other choice, he could only raise his arms to guard himself.

With another loud bang, Yang Kai was smashed into the ground completely, leaving only his head half-exposed.

Xu Qing did not even spare Yang Kai a second glance, not caring whether he was alive or dead, instead just charging over towards Mo Xiao Qi with all haste.

In his opinion, it was meaningless to engage in a life or death battle with Yang Kai. As long as he snatched Mo Xiao Qi’s Space Ring, his goal would be achieved.

Mo Xiao Qi still stood there, covering her eyes, ignorant of the approaching danger, her face was beet-red all the way to the tip of her ears. For Mo Xiao Qi, who was as pure as a piece of white paper, even just the bare upper body of the beast-like Xu Qing was more than she could bear, much less what had been exposed down below.

In her heart, she was truly panicking.

[I saw it, I saw it! I won’t go blind right? Right?]

Aunty Feng’s teaching of ‘never look at the ugly body of a man or it will blind your eyes!’ still rang loudly in her ears.

Mo Xiao Qi still remembered that when Aunty Feng had told her this, she wore a completely serious expression and spoke in a serious tone, so she firmly believed her.

Xu Qing was extremely fast and arrived beside Mo Xiao Qi in an instant. Looking down at this naïve girl who was completely unguarded against him, and the glittering Space Ring on her hand, Xu Qing could not help grinning.

Reaching out swiftly, he grabbed towards Mo Xiao Qi’s Space Ring.

Having learned his lesson from Yu Ruo Mei’s pitiful example, he did not dare attack Mo Xiao Qi; after all, who knows what kind of power the Artifact Armour she was wearing still had? If he followed in Yu Ruo Mei’s footsteps after reaching this point, it would be a really bad joke.

His goal from beginning to end was Mo Xiao Qi’s ring.

However, just when his huge hand was just a meter away from Mo Xiao Qi, the two earrings she was wearing suddenly released a faint ring as they transformed into two dazzling rays of light which shot towards Xu Qing like arrows from the string.

This unexpected counterattack caused Xu Qing’s eyes to shrink and all the golden hairs on his body stood on end.

His complexion changed drastically, and he no longer dared to approach Mo Xiao Qi, instead forcing himself to retreat rapidly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The two dazzling lights did not relent, however, and pierced towards Xu Qing from left and right.

At this moment of crisis, Xu Qing released a desperate roar as golden light radiated from his body, making him seem even larger than before.

Two puffs rang out as the golden light halo around Xu Qing’s body was instantly pierced through and he staggered backwards a few steps with a great snort.

The two rays of light then swiftly returned to Mo Xiao Qi’s delicate earlobes.

Now, there was a big hole in Xu Qing’s abdomen out of which blood poured like a fountain. In a panic, Xu Qing circulated his Qi in order to staunch this outflow.

Looking over at Mo Xiao Qi incredulously, he couldn’t believe that this seemingly defenceless girl in front of him was able to cause him such heavy losses without lifting a finger or even intending to fight back.

Yu Ruo Mei dying was not unjust!

“Who are you?” Xu Qing growled.

At this time, if he could not guess that Mo Xiao Qi’s background was enormous, he would not have been an Origin King Realm cultivator. He was now secretly regretting being blinded by Mo Xiao Qi’s wealth.

She was no doubt the descendant of some great Sir.

When dealing with such a person, if he could wash his hands cleanly after the fact, it was fine, but the slightest mistake or leak of information would only result in a relentless pursuit!

If he fell into the hands of her elders, a swift death would be the best outcome he could hope for.

However, now that he had already acted, there was no turning back. Since regrets were of no use, he could only steel himself and go all out to silence all the witnesses to the crime.

Just as he was lost in thought, a rich murderous intent suddenly erupted behind him. Xu Qing was startled and hurriedly turned his head to find Yang Kai furiously falling towards him, his body covered in a blinding five-coloured glow, his face filled with anger. The violent power which surged from Yang Kai’s fists made him seem like an enraged beast, causing Xu Qing to slightly shudder.
