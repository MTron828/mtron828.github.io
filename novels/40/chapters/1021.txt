“Fully mastered their strength?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Having a comply understanding of the mysteries of the strength one uses, allowing them to display its full potential and might!” Bi Ya explained with a smile.

“Fair enough,” Yang Kai was a bit confused. Although Gui Zu’s previous words had made him very excited and he secretly felt that a whole new world of possibilities had opened in front of him, it may have also just been Gui Zu speaking randomly.

He couldn’t offer Yang Kai any kind of advice or guidance on the matter.

“Your slave has never met such an astonishing genius, but I have witnessed two people who cultivate opposite attribute strengths fight side by side. Those two forces should have interfered with one another but instead they mutually enhanced each other,” Bi Ya added, “These types of cultivators are actually not that rare, I believe Master has also encountered some before.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he turned to stare at Bi Ya, his burning gaze making it seem as if he wanted to swallow her whole.

Bi Ya wore a forced smile and shyly whispered, “What does Master want, staring at your slave so?”

Yang Kai didn’t answer as a thousand different thoughts flashed across his mind.

It was as if he had found a light in the darkness, Bi Ya’s unintentional words had made Yang Kai remember a vital point.

It was indeed extremely difficult or even impossible for two opposing forces to fuse together; however, two people who cultivated different attribute forces could work side by side while complementing one another, such things often happened.

This was also the case when him and Su Yan!

Su Yan controlled frigid cold while he used blazing heat, the two of them shouldn’t be able to cooperate at all, but when they fought side by side, each of them would obtain a massive boost in strength!

And this was all because of the existence of the Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art!

The two of them were dual cultivators, the primary forces in each of their bodies blending with one another before returning back to themselves in an endless cycle. Su Yan’s icy strength and his True Yang strength would purify and sublimate one another, increasing their density and intensity.

[Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art?]

Yang Kai’s expression changed, sinking into an even deeper state of contemplation.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled the scene of him and Su Yan dual cultivating. He entered a state of epiphany, as if Su Yan was right in front of himself, the two of them achieving a union of heart and soul, unable to extricate themselves.

*Hong...*

In the midst of his reflection, Yang Kai felt like a barrier of fog around him lifted, allowing him to see further into this unknown realm.

His body shook greatly and a profound light overflowed from his eyes.

At this moment, he had thought of a possibility.

Ice and fire were able to fuse because they flowed together in a never-ending cycle, not restraining one another, but promoting and enhancing each other’s strength. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ice and fire were capable of this, so his True Yang Saint Qi and evil power should be able to as well.

Strictly speaking, the evil power contained inside his Unyielding Golden Skeleton was a type of Cold Attribute strength, just different from Su Yan’s Ice Attribute strength; it was a type of cold that could cause one’s mind and soul to feel as if they had been dropped into the deepest levels of purgatory.

An invisible wave of force exploded from Yang Kai’s body and in instant, an alternating hot and cold aura surrounded Bi Ya, causing her to feel a sweltering heat difficult to bear, then a frigid chill like the coldest of winters in rapid succession.

“Are you alright?” She called out in alarm, immediately discovering that Yang Kai’s situation was unusual, frightening her greatly.

During this time, she had done her very best to please Yang Kai in order to make him feel some sympathy, all so she could obtain his asylum. If Yang Kai had any kind of accident, all her efforts would be wasted.

Bi Ya was naturally nervous.

“Get back!” From somewhere unseen, Gui Zu’s sternly shouted, and immediately, Bi Ya found herself held by an invisible force and thrown out of the stone chamber.

A breeze brushed past her face in the next instant and Bi Ya was amazed to discover that Gui Zu was now standing beside her, his gloomy eyes filled with profound light as he stared towards Yang Kai who was sitting in the stone room in front of him.

“Senior, what happened to him?” Bi Ya summoned her courage and asked.

“I’m not sure, but he seems to have had some kind of harvest!” Gui Zu frowned, “What were you talking to him about just now?”

Bi Ya quickly explained everything that just transpired.

Gui Zu listened to her explanation as his expression fluctuated, soon grinning strangely, “This boy, just because of a few words from this old master, was actually able to achieve such a result? I really don’t know if it’s a blessing or a calamity!”

“Senior... Is he in danger?” Bi Ya covered her mouth in fear.

“He’s trying to fuse together two opposite attribute forces, what do you think?” Gui Zu grinned, “It’s already impressive he wasn’t killed on the spot, his courage is certainly not small.”

“Senior, can’t you stop him?” Bi Ya exclaimed and hurriedly said, “Don’t you need him to help find a way to escape this place? If he dies...”

“If he dies, he dies. Besides, this little boy isn’t sincerely trying to help this old master. Even if he does find a way to escape, I’m afraid the first thing he’ll do is look for a way to leave this old master behind! Heh, if he dies, this old master just needs to collect his remnant Soul and search his memories.”

Bi Ya suddenly understood that it was useless. Regardless of what she said now, Gui Zu would not change his stance of non-interference.

“Little girl, it’s not like you really care about his safety, why act so nervous?” Gui Zu looked at Bi Ya and snickered.

Bi Ya wore a forced smile, “Senior must be joking... I really don’t want him to die now.”

“What happened?” Shen Tu shouted and quickly appeared, falling into a state of shock the moment he arrived at the stone chamber’s door and hurriedly calling out, “Brother Yang, what’s happening? Why is his appearance so strange? “

As soon as he asked this though, Gui Zu’s brow furrowed and he shouted, “Fall back!”

Saying so, he disappeared.

Seeing the seriousness with which Gui Zu was acting, how could Bi Ya and Shen Tu dare to remain? Using their movement skills, they quickly rushed out.

Just as the two of them appeared outside, two opposing forces suddenly broke out from the mountain.

One was burning hot, the other was cold and malevolent.

Both of these forces were incredibly powerful and had flooded the entire stone tunnel network before spreading out beyond the confines of the mountain peak.

Lu Gui Chen, who had been staying nearby, turned his head and stared in shock towards the mountain.

Yue Xi, who was talking with He Zao and He Miao, also turned to face the same direction, her pretty face filling with surprise.

The entire mountain was now engulfed in a bizarre phenomenon, seemingly having been divided into two distinct zones.

The left half of the mountain was filled with burning hot Yang Attribute strength, radiating bright golden light, while the right half was bathed in a jet black evil energy that was filled with a bloodthirsty and cruel aura.

These two forces were polar opposites and were visibly clashing against one another, causing the entire mountain to tremble, as if it would collapse at any moment.

“What’s going on?” Lu Gui Chen muttered as he rapidly withdrew. At the same time, everyone else around the mountain fell back more than a dozen kilometres before coming to a stop.

“This is that Junior’s aura. What is he doing?” Yue Xi narrowed her eyes and asked He Zao and He Miao.

“I don’t know. When we came out, he didn’t seem to be doing anything in particular,” He Miao shook her head.

“Bi Ya of Purple Star should know something,” He Zao turned her eyes to the side where both Bi Ya and Shen Tu were staring towards the mountain with nervous looks.

Lu Gui Chen also noticed this point and immediately asked them about it.

Listening to their conversation, Yue Xi quickly understood the truth of the matter.

A strange look appeared on her pretty face and soon a burst of laughter escaped from her lips, “That Junior is dead for sure this time, I don’t even need to take action. Hmph, just an overconfident brat, a mere First Order Saint daring to try such a stunt, it really makes one wonder how he lived this long.”

“Master, is Yang Kai in danger?”

“His life is hanging by a single thread!” Yue Xi said with a happy look upon her face.

“Master, please save him. I know you’re annoyed that he acted disrespectfully towards you, but you don’t really wish to see him die, right?” He Zao begged.

“Naturally I want him to die, the sooner the better!” Yue Xi ground her teeth, “And besides, this kind of thing can’t be interfered with by others. Haven’t you seen that Senior Gui Zu standing back?”

He Zao and He Miao looked up and indeed saw Gui Zu’s just standing in the sky, observing.

“If anyone tries to forcefully stop him, he will die without a doubt!” Yue Xi frowned and quickly said, “Now, whether he lives or dies, is all up to him.”

After saying this, Yue Xi suddenly noticed that He Zao and He Miao were staring at her strangely, causing her to snort and turn her pretty face away.

He Zao giggled, “Master’s really had a change of heart. You don’t seem to be bearing much of a grudge anymore.”

“Little girl, don’t make fun of your Master,” Yue Xi said bitterly, “If he doesn’t die this time, later you must keep your distance from him, at least ten meters!”

“Yes!” He Zao and He Miao nodded.

“Senior, can’t you try to find some way to help him?” Shen Tu stood at the foot of the mountain and yelled towards Gui Zu.

Gui Zu grinned, “There’s nothing this old master can do. After this, he will either die or soar to untold heights. No matter which end it is though, this old master is very much looking forward to it, so even if this old master had a way to, he wouldn’t stop this.”

He was truly quite interested in Yang Kai now.

Although he had been shocked when he learned that Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, and had been paying more attention to Yang Kai’s movements these past few days, it wasn’t until this moment that he discovered he had somewhat underestimated Yang Kai.

With only a few words from him, this boy had been able to rapidly comprehend the deeper mysteries of his own strength. This wasn’t something an ordinary cultivator could achieve.

Gui Zu wanted to see if Yang Kai could succeed, and if he did, what this new fusion of these two opposite attribute strengths would be like and how much his strength would improve.

If he didn’t die, his future would certainly be incredibly bright, even possibly becoming the greatest genius in the entire Star Field.

At the foot of the mountain, everyone stood and stared towards the mountain peak covered in these two opposite forces as they clashed against one another.

Some people hoped Yang Kai would quickly die, some hoped he would survive, and some were completely indifferent, only taking this as an interesting show to watch. Everyone had a different mood and watched with different expressions upon their face.
