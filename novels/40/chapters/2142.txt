“Senior Brother Hua Gu...” One of the middle-aged men looked for a while and asked the elderly man in a low voice with a suspicious expression. “How is it possible that a Saint King Realm cultivator has entered the Four Seasons Realm?”

“Damn it! She must be a disciple of those Great Sects!” Another middle-aged man suddenly voiced out, indignant with gritted teeth, “To think Evil Moon Valley was only allowed to take up three spots! For just three spots, even the Orthodoxy Temple had to pay a considerable amount to obtain them! But these bigger Sects... To think they could so recklessly squander such an opportunity. To think they would even allow a disciple in the Saint King Realm to occupy one of them. This is simply too much!”

After hearing him say his piece, the elder one, called Hua Gu, also nodded. “Junior Brother Zhou An has a point, these two women should hail from one of the Great Sects. It only makes sense that their origins are as such. Otherwise, it is impossible for a Saint King Realm cultivator to enter this place. Just look at her. She seems to have just broken through and is already at the threshold of Origin Returning Realm!”

As he spoke, Hua Gu displayed hints of envy and jealousy.

When he cultivated, he had to risk his life for the few cultivation resources available, but for these disciples from Great Sects, it was different.

They could easily enter the Sealed World, where others could only enter with great effort. Furthermore, with such an opportunity, they could easily advance.

When he compared the difference in both situations, his mind started to fume.

The middle-aged man who spoke earlier showed some fear and said hesitantly, “Since they are from one of the Great Sects, we’d better go first, in case we cause a misunderstanding. That would be horrendous.”

“Xiong Ning, what are you afraid of?” The middle-aged man named Zhou An gave the Xiong Ning a sidelong glance and coldly snorted, “Even if they are disciples of a Great Sect, they are only at First-Order Dao Source Realm and Third-Order Saint King Realm. Even if they are the disciples from a Great Sect, with their strength, even if there was a misunderstanding, what could they possibly do to us?”

“Who says I’m afraid?” Xiong Ning became angry out of shame and roared, “I just don’t want to invite trouble for nothing!”

“Humph, gutless rat!” Zhou An coldly snorted with a look of contempt. He disdained his fellow disciple a fair bit.

“The bead in that woman’s hand... that should be an amazing artifact!” Hua Gu suddenly whispered, his eyes staring straight at the Sealed World Bead held in Liu Yan’s hand.

Zhou An’s eyes twinkled and he asked in a low voice, ” Senior Brother Hua Gu, what are you trying to say?”

Xiong Ning obviously also realized something was up and his expression slightly changed.

Hua Gu faintly smiled. “We are currently deep underground. There is no one here and hardly anyone would pass by. What’s more, the other party’s strength is low and they are holding suich great treasures.”

Zhou An, after hearing this, understood and smiled, “I have long seen how these Great Sect disciples act and have been displeased with them for a long time now. Always flaunting their might and believing themselves to be unbeatable just because they have a good backer. So, what? Senior Brother Hua Gu, tell me what you plan to do. This Junior Brother will follow you to the end!”

“So, it comes to this...” Xiong Ning could feel his limbs tremble, as his stomach churn. He incoherently warned, “If their Sect ever finds out what happened to them, not only will we be finished, Evil Moon Valley will not be spared.”

Zhou An shot Xiong Ning a cold glare. “If you are afraid then get lost. We do not need to have someone who will just blow wind in our face and dare not do anything. But let me be clear. If you back out now, you will not obtain any portion of the artifacts and Source Crystals obtained. Since these two women are from a Great Sect, I expect a lot of prized possession to be on them!”

When Xiong Ning heard that, he gulped, and a greedy expression appeared on his fearful face.

He was silent for a few breaths before he finally gritted his teeth and agreed. “Fine. I will accompany the two Senior Brothers to advance and retreat together!”

“That’s more like it!” Zhou An couldn’t help but smile when he saw Xiong Ning agree.

“You three pieces of trash!” Not far from the other side. Liu Yan suddenly spoke up coldly, and her first sentence made the three Evil Moon Valley members’ eyebrows jump. “What the hell are you muttering about?”

Hua Gu forced himself to hold back the displeasure in his heart. “The three of us fellow brothers noticed a strange energy fluctuation deep within this canyon. So, we came to check it out. But to think what we found were two girls here, who caused it. “

“That’s all?” Liu Yan replied, still as cold as ice.

“That’s all!” Hua Gu replied.

“Since you’re done with your investigation, why don’t you get lost?” Liu Yan’s words were sharp, without the slightest intention to give face to the other party. This made the men from Evil Moon Valley further convinced that Liu Yan must be from one of the Great Sects. After all, only the disciples of these Great Sects would be so arrogant and domineering, even in the face of someone more powerful.

A deep-seated explosion was occurring within Hua Gu, but he still placed a smile on his face as he asked, “May I ask which Sect do you hail from?”

“What does it have to do with you!?” Liu Yan coldly snorted.

“Let’s be nice.” Hua Gu smiled faintly, “From my point of view, you can only hail from a select number of Sects. I am from Evil Moon Valley, and we have had many exchanges with other Great Sects. We have quite the harmonious relationship with them. Although I must admit that we have interrupted you two, since we have met, let’s consider it to be a sign from fate.”

He paused for a moment, his gaze turned to Zhang Ruo Xi as he spoke. “I see that this girl seems to be on the verge of breaking through a Great Realm. But I guess that is to be expected. After all, this place is extremely rich in World Energy. However, we do not know if there are any fierce Monster Beasts around. With the energy fluctuation, it would not be strange for you two to attract a Monster Beast. I am afraid with your current level of strength, it would be difficult to cope with any Monster Beast from this place.” He spoke, acting righteous. To hit the hammer while it was still hot, he suggested, “We might not be the best but we would like to stand guard for the two of you.”

Zhou An nodded vigorously at the side and continued, “Exactly. We would like to stand guard for you, even if a Monster Beast were to come, you do not have to be afraid.”

Meanwhile, Xiong Ning stayed silent.

Liu Yan laughed coldly, “Just the three of you trash? If a Monster Beast appears, I’m afraid the three of you won’t be able to fight it!”

“Your words are too hurtful!” Hua Gu’s heart was about to explode and leave his chest. He bared it and spoke with a sullen face, “We only have good intentions. Even if you don’t want to accept them, there is no need to belittle us to that extent!”

“That’s right, although Evil Moon Valley is not a Great Sect like yours, it is not something that can simply be insulted by anyone!” Zhou An shouted righteously. Though, those who were listening carefully, would not know how he connected Liu Yan’s words with ‘insulting’ Evil Moon Valley.

“What’s the point of all this farce? Just spit it out. Are you targeting me or this artifact?“ Liu Yan said, lightly tossing up the Sealed World Bead in her hand. “If you want it, try and grab it. Why beat around the bush?”

As this statement was made, Hua Gu’s and others’ faces changed.

“Senior Brother....” Zhou An turned his head and looked at Hua Gu.

Hua Gu pondered for a moment and replied in a low voice, “It doesn’t look like she has other fellow disciples around. We have been circling around them for so long and yet, we do not sense anyone else.”

“Then, is this really a heaven-sent opportunity!?” Zhou An had an excited expression as he licked his lips. He was completely eager and did not bother to hide anything. He turned to look back at Liu Yan with a ferocious expression, and said in a cold voice. “Little girl, when I beat you to the ground and strip you of your clothes, you better not cry for mercy! “

He originally never had such evil intent against Liu Yan, however, her words had created a lingering trace of hatred that could only be quelled with such an act.

Once his emotions erupted, he immediately wanted to rob the artifact, and her dignity!

The thought of having the opportunity to ravish and defile a beautiful woman from a Great Sect, who he would never dare to even glance at in the past, made Zhou An’s blood boil.

“Do it!” Hua Gu bellowed.

In an instant, the three from Evil Moon Valley’s Source Qi started to surge. Although they were facing a woman who had a lower cultivation than them, the three were not the slightest bit sloppy or careless. They were giving their all.

The old man opened his mouth and spat out a huge bell. The body of the bell was densely engraved with countless small and complicated characters, Source Qi poured into it and the bell swelled up even bigger, a growth rate visible to the naked eye. Once it was done, it looked like a golden fortress.

This bell was clearly a defensive artifact.

Though Hua Gu summoned this artifact, not to defend himself, but to capture Zhang Ruo Xi.

He had a clear objective. After all, no matter how strong Liu Yan was, Zhang Ruo Xi was only a Third-Order Saint King. With such a cultivation, she was too weak to struggle against him. As long as he could capture Zhang Ruo Xi first, he knew Liu Yan had to concede.

So when he struck, his target was Zhang Ruo Xi.

But when the bell was about to envelop Zhang Ruo Xi, Liu Yan suddenly let out a cold snort. “In your dreams!”

She raised her hand and a black feather, about three metres long, shot out and flew to Zhang Ruo Xi’s side, turning into a burning barrier that wrapped Zhang Ruo Xi’s entire body.

The moment the feather became a barrier, a pressure that did not seem to belong to this world suddenly descended. This scared the three from Evil Moon Valley as their bodies trembled with fear.

It was as if, in the feather, there was an extremely strong will that was hidden within, leering at the three of them. This caused the three of them to instantly break out in a cold sweat, soaking their clothes.

“What is this!?” Hua Gu’s eyes widened as he stared at the pitch-black flame barrier wrapping around Zhang Ruo Xi. The terrifying scorching power spread out, as if it desired to burn all of existence.

Zhang Ruo Xi, who was sitting within the barrier, remained motionless. As if she was not affected at all.

The bell-like artifact, however, which was glowing due to the terrifying heat from the flames, had its small complicated word engravings melted away one by one. Worse, as soon as the bell came into contact with the black flame barrier, it was tainted with a trace of this black flame. This flame did not go out and continued to burn the spirituality of the artifact.

“Divine Spirit’s aura!” Hua Gu shouted in horror.

He was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator. Even if he had never seen a Divine Spirit before, he could still deduce with his experience. This frightening pressure, which seemed to be able to burn all of existence. This all indicated to him that they were up against one of the most terrifying beings that ever existed. A Divine Spirit!

Naturally, his guess was not far from the truth. This dark feather was none other than a feather from a Divine Spirit, Luan Feng.

Yang Kai gave the Luan Feng feather he found to Liu Yan, and after spending so much time, Liu Yan finally completed her refining of it. She even managed to obtain a trace amount of Divine Spirit power from it.

Even if this Divine Spirit power was weak, it was not something that a Dao Source Realm cultivator could compete against.

That was why Liu Yan did not fear these three.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
