“Why has Senior Luo come here in person?”

After inviting Luo Lan into the palace and offering her a seat in the greeting hall, Yang Kai could not help asking.

“Little Brother is Young Master’s friend. This Queen should naturally come here personally,” Luo Lan pursed her lips and smiled. “Why, am I not welcome?”

“Nonsense, Senior being able to visit my humble home is a great honour,” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

Of course, he did not believe that someone like Luo Lan would be so idle that she had time to come sight-seeing here, which meant that the reason she gave him was not the real one!

For a simple trade on behalf of Sword Union, Luo Lan could send any of her subordinates to complete it. Why would she need to come out in person?

Yang Kai faintly sensed that Luo Lan had some other purpose in coming here, but since the other party did not say anything yet, he didn’t ask.

“It’s quite quiet here,” Luo Lan turned her eyes around as she spoke. This palace stretched over ten kilometres in radius, but only Yang Kai, Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao lived here. With the three women in retreat though, it was almost like Yang Kai was the only one who was present.

In normal times, the palace was indeed all but silent.

“Why not have Zhu Liang find some servants to take care of this palace?” Luo Lan asked, seemingly concerned.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “That’s not necessary, I can handle things here myself, what would there even be for servants to do?”

“Fair enough, peace and quiet are best,” Luo Lan smiled before suddenly saying. “En, these are the Space Spirit Crystals that Little Brother requested. Although this Queen tried her best to collect them, as you know, Space Spirit Crystals are very rare so I don’t know if this quantity can meet your requirements.”

Saying so, Luo Lan took out a Space Ring, flicked her wrist, and sent it over to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and caught it before sweeping its content with his Divine Sense, only to frown lightly at what he saw.

Luo Lan was observing carefully and couldn’t help asking in surprise, “What’s wrong? There are many Space Spirit Crystals in this Space Ring. Is it not enough for Little Brother?”

Yang Kai frowned and nodded, “It’s not much.”

Luo Lan wore a solemn look and asked, “What do you need so many Space Spirit Crystals for? These things don’t really have another purpose other than refining Space Rings, right?”

Yang Kai chuckled but did not answer.

Luo Lan seemed to realize she had asked something she shouldn’t have and apologized, “This Queen was simply curious, you don’t have to answer if you don’t want to. Alright, if you wait for a while, I can contact the Home Star and have them collect some more for you.”

“How long would that take?” Yang Kai asked.

“The Home Star is not close to here, so even if they manage to collect some Space Spirit Crystals, it will take some time to deliver it. It would be at least a year, but even so, I don’t know how many Space Spirit Crystals they would be able to collect.”

“Forget it then,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

The Space Spirit Crystals that Luo Lan brought this time were not few, but for Yang Kai’s goal, they also weren’t many. These Space Spirit Crystals would only be enough to arrange a single Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array, which obviously could not meet Yang Kai’s needs.

If he wanted to connect Tong Xuan Realm to Shadowed Star, he would need to build at least two or three Space Arrays to serve as transfer points in between!

“The formation of Space Spirit Crystals is quite difficult, and generally speaking, they only appear as by-products in different mineral lodes, making their number quite scarce. However, this Queen has heard of a place where numerous Void Cracks form large numbers of Space Spirit Crystals...” Luo Lan suddenly began speaking about a seemingly unrelated but associated topic, immediately acting mysterious and asking. “Is Little Brother interested in perhaps looking for Space Spirit Crystals on his own?”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes before chuckling, “This is the real purpose of Senior coming here in person, right?”

Luo Lan smiled and did not try to deny it, “Since you’ve seen through me, then I won’t bother hiding.”

“Senior knows of a place where there are Void Cracks which form Space Spirit Crystals?” Yang Kai asked.

“En,” Luo Lan nodded. “I wonder if Little Brother is interested in going there?”

“And if I say I’m not?” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

Luo Lan didn’t seem surprised and simply laughed lightly, “Well... In addition to Space Spirit Crystals that may exist there, that place is also home to Shocking Void Beasts!”

“Shocking Void Beasts?” Yang Kai muttered under his breath as his eyes fixed on Luo Lan deeply and said, “It looks like Senior knows I am proficient in the Dao of Space. Was it Gu Jian Xin who told you?”

“If this wasn’t the case, do you think this Queen would come here in person?” Luo Lan smiled, “Since you used Space Force in front of the Young Master, you should have already known this would happen; however, you may rest assured, only I and Young Master know of this. No one else will.”

“It doesn’t matter if others know or not,” Yang Kai shrugged. “If I was afraid that people would know, I wouldn’t have used Space Force to kill Li Ming Hai.”

Luo Lan was startled, then smiled bitterly.

She could not help but feel like all the initiative she had in this situation was shattered by Yang Kai’s few words, making her feel somewhat weak.

After pondering for a while, she said in a serious tone, “Little Brother, since you cultivate the Dao of Space and have significant achievements in this domain, you must be aware of the benefits a Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core would have for you. This kind of exotic beast which can freely shuttle The Void is said to have gone extinct long ago, but there is one place where they still survive. If you can obtain one of their Monster Cores, I think your comprehension of the Dao of Space will increase a level. On top of that, there is a huge possibility that there are many Space Spirit Crystals in the place, more than enough for your needs. If I am not mistaken, you need Space Spirit Crystals to cultivate Space Force too, yes?”

Yang Kai neither confirmed nor denied her guess, simply asking, “And where would that be?”

Seeing him finally showing some interest, Luo Lan’s expression brightened but did not directly answer, instead asking, “If I told you that there is a higher realm above the Origin King Realm, would you think I am lying to you?”

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Luo Lan was stunned by his immediate response.

“Someone once told me that the Martial Dao has no peak! The Origin King Realm can naturally not be the ultimate goal of us cultivators,” Yang Kai explained casually.

“So that’s how it is!” Luo Lan relaxed and smiled; she had thought Yang Kai knew some terrifying information, but it turned out he just had his own dreams and aspirations.

In truth, Yang Kai really had this startling piece of information, but he had no intention of letting that be known.

Luo Lan added, “No one knows whether the Origin King Realm is the highest realm a cultivator can reach, but with a legendary character like the Starry Sky Great Emperor having once appeared, many Origin Kings feel that there must be a realm above the Origin King Realm. Additionally, above the Star Field we live in, there must also be a higher realm.”

“Why do you say that?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Because the place I spoke of to you is actually a fragment that was severed from that higher realm,” Luo Lan said solemnly. “We call it the Severed World, and the World Energy and World Principles of that place are somewhat different from those of any Cultivation Star in the Star Field. Not only that, but that place contains countless opportunities. Without even mentioning the various rare and precious cultivation resources there, some people even managed to bring back herbs and ores which surpass the Origin King Grade from it. These precious resources allowed some to easily enhance their cultivation. We Origin Kings have an exceedingly difficult time enhancing our cultivation, but if one is lucky enough to find some rare resource from that place, it may be enough to break through one’s shackles and reach a higher level.”

“The Severed World?” Yang Kai frowned.

“En, the World Principles there are more suitable for cultivators to cultivate in.”

“And that’s the place you want me to go to?”

“Yes,” Luo Lan nodded.

“If what you say is true though, wouldn’t those Third-Order Origin Kings who have secluded themselves from the world and go there to attempt to break through to a higher realm?”

“No,” Luo Lan smiled, “After all, that place is only a fragmented world, and although it comes from a higher realm, it still exists within the Star Field, so it cannot satisfy the needs of those Third-Order Origin Kings to make a breakthrough. There have been a few Third-Order Origin Kings who entered that place before, but the result was that none of them could enhance their cultivation further. Also... how many Third-Order Origin Kings do you think there are in the Star Field? Most of them are old monsters that no longer appear unless something sensational occurs.”

“But there will be Second-Order Origin Kings there, right?”

“Possibly,” Luo Lan nodded.

“Since it is a place where Origin Kings go to seek opportunities, why ask me to accompany you there? I’m only a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator,” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“You may be a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, but you’re anything but normal, right?” Luo Lan asked, “This Queen has never heard of any Third-Order Origin Returning Realm that can kill an Origin King, and don’t say it was because you made a sneak attack. If an Origin King could be casually killed just because they were sneak attacked, they would not be an Origin King. I came to you first because you are not weak, so you shouldn’t be a burden for me, but more importantly, I need your help specifically for something in that place!”

“You need my help specifically?” Yang Kai raised his brow thoughtfully but quickly understood, “Because I cultivate the Dao of Space?”

“Exactly!” Luo Lan nodded, her expression saying that it much easier dealing with a smart person, “The Severed World is filled with Void Cracks, some visible, some not, but all of them extremely dangerous, even to Origin Kings. Every time that place opens, several Origin Kings get lost to those Void Cracks, I do not want to suffer such a fate! Since you are proficient in the Dao of Space though, it should be easy for you to sense those Void Cracks.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded, “But... will it be alright for you to bring in an Origin Returning Realm cultivator like me?”

“Why not?” Luo Lan chuckled, “Any Origin King that is qualified to enter can bring another person with them, so you won’t be the only Origin Realm cultivator there!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“There will be others?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“Yes, but not many; however, since that place is extremely well suited for Origin Kings to cultivate in, it is naturally an excellent place for Origin Realm cultivators to cultivate as well. Some people even enter that place in order to break through to the Origin King Realm.”

Speaking until here, Luo Lan said, “That’s all the information I know about this. I came here today to ask Little Brother for his help; of course, this is also a good opportunity for you.”

“Opportunities are accompanied by risks.”

“You’re already a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator at such a young age, so you must have already experienced more than your fair share of risks, no?” Luo Lan giggled lightly, “Cultivation itself is a process of competing against others, the Heavens, and oneself. Only by going all out will one succeed!”
