Yang Kai was in a good mood when he saw this Territory Lord, not only because he could avenge Huang Si Niang’s Soul Clone, but also because if he was trapped here, that meant that the Great Evolution Army was going in the right direction.

One of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters near Yang Kai was also overjoyed, “This guy is really unlucky to come here of all places. Now he has truly gotten caught in a trap.”

Yang Kai laughed lightly and reached out at the space in front of him with his hand.

The Territory Lord looked at the scene and scoffed sarcastically. This damned place was full of Void Cracks, each one practically indestructible. Even he could not withstand being cut by those cracks. He knew this well as he had tried several times to break out and each time he ended up being cut up even worse than before.

What made him feel more desperate was that while some of these cracks were visible to the naked eye, others were totally invisible, so there was no way he could detect them.

The location of these cracks was also not fixed as their location changed as time went by.

He was a Territory Lord. How could he be trapped here if not for all these damned Void Cracks?

Now this Seventh-Order Human even dared to grab at these Void Cracks with his bare hand. He would definitely suffer some pain, and if he was unlucky, his hand might even be cut off.

While he was thinking about this, he saw Yang Kai’s hand wave, and the hidden cracks of the Void appeared one after another. Then with some mysterious power, Yang Kai grabbed a huge crack and held it in his hand!

The Territory Lord was dumbfounded when he saw the Void Crack shatter in Yang Kai’s hand. He could not believe what he had just seen!

Territory Lord was stunned and frozen in place.

Then he suddenly remembered that he had encountered this Human in the previous battle. He seemed to have some power related to the Dao of Space. He did not understand such a power, and did not recall this immediately; however, what just happened undoubtedly explained something.

After destroying one of the Void Cracks, Yang Kai asked, “Do you want to die or live?”

Words were not as convincing as showing the other party that he had the means to save his life. Now, all that was left was the other party’s desire to live.

The Territory Lord pursed his lips and did not say a word.

However, Yang Kai did not mind the snub. There was a blood feud between the Human Race and the Black Ink Clan, one that could never be resolved. Turning down Yang Kai’s offer was only to be expected.

Yang Kai asked, “What’s your name?”

The Territory Lord was silent for a long time before he replied, “Ge Chen!”

Yang Kai’s brow rose slightly as a response meant that the other party had some desire to live and might cooperate with them.

It was easy to understand how this Ge Chen felt. He was caught between a death trap and his enemy was now willing to give him a chance to survive. Anyone would grasp the opportunity to survive.

“I’ll ask you a question. If you answer me honestly, I’ll save you and guarantee that no one will do anything to you for half a day. After half a day, whether you live or die depends on your own ability.”

Ge Chen said in a gruff voice, “How can I trust you?”

He knew that if the tables were turned and it was he who discovered a trapped Human Master, he would definitely not let him go so easily.

Yang Kai snickered and said, “Let me summarize the situation you are in. Whether you like it or not, you have to trust me. If you choose to trust me, there is a chance you will survive, if you choose not to trust me, you can remain here. I will not kill you, but good luck trying to get out of here on your own.”

Ge Chen’s expression turned grim.

He also knew that what Yang Kai said was the truth. It felt horrible to him that his head was on the chopping block while Yang Kai held the axe. If he could get away from here on his own, would he still be standing here?

He had already attempted many times and each time he only wound up worse than before. If hadn’t acted cautiously, he would have already died long ago.

However, Yang Kai was just a Seventh-Order brat who had no right to represent the Human Race.

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master standing beside Yang Kai said impatiently, “Enough nonsense. Yang Kai said that no one will attack you for half a day, which means that you can escape for half a day. Mo Zhao, that son of a bitch, died during the battle over the Royal City. You are one of the few Territory Lords that managed to escape. What else can you do to survive? Yet, you still dare to question us?”

The Humans did not know much about the situation in the Black Ink Clan, especially about the previously speculated Mother Nest. Although it was certain that there was a higher rank Black Ink Nest above the High-Rank Black Ink Nests, they still did not really know what exactly the Mother Nest was. What was there to lose from letting a Territory Lord live if he could tell them something about the Mother Nest?

This Eighth-Order Open Heaven Master was definitely aware of Yang Kai’s intentions, which was why he said this.

Ge Chen shook his head, looked past the two of them and said, “If it’s the Old Ancestor who guarantees to spare my life, I will tell you anything you want.”

“Impudence!” The Eighth-Order Master sternly shouted.

After the Eighth-Order Master roared though, the Old Ancestor suddenly appeared behind them. Apparently, she also found out about the situation somehow and rushed over long ago, but hid from sight.

When the Territory Lord saw Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao, he obviously looked a bit nervous. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

This was the Supreme Human Master who killed Royal Lord Mo Zhao. Every Black Ink Clansman would be terrified of her.

“Upon my name, I swear I will not kill you as long as you answer a few questions,” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao looked at Ge Chen and said flatly, “You can choose not to answer, but if you dare to lie… I have ways to make you beg for death.”

Ge Chen looked conflicted for a while, but soon resigned himself to his fate and nodded, “Good!”

Old Ancestor replied, “Regarding your High-Rank Black Ink Nests, is there a higher Black Ink Nest that is the source of the Black Ink Clan?”

Ge Chen frowned and answered, “I’m not sure. Maybe.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao stared at him with narrowed eyes and asked, “Do you have a death wish?”

Ge Chen quickly said, “I’m really not sure about this. I’m not lying.”

The Old Ancestor narrowed her eyes and asked, “How could you not know such a simple matter as a Territory Lord?”

Ge Chen explained, “There are differences between Territory Lords. These things may be known to Innate Territory Lords, but I am an Acquired Territory Lord and don’t know much about the secrets of the clan.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao was puzzled and asked, “Innate? Acquired? What are the differences between an Innate Territory Lord and an Acquired Territory Lord?”

Even Yang Kai, who had lived amongst the Black Ink Clan for years, never knew that there were any differences between the Territory Lords.

“After a High-Rank Black Ink Nest is fully grown, the earliest Territory Lords spawned from it are considered Innate Territory Lords. After that, they are all Acquired Territory Lords.” As he said that, he glanced at Yang Kai, “Sir Che Kong, the one this boy killed, was an Innate Territory Lord.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao glanced at Yang Kai, but he just shrugged and smiled awkwardly.

He was in a life-or-death situation, so who would care about whether a Territory Lord was Innate or Acquired? Furthermore, he had never heard of such a difference.

“What’s the difference?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked. She had a hunch that this time, she might be able to get a lot of extremely confidential information about Black Ink Clan from Ge Chen.

Ge Chen thought for a moment before answering, “There are definitely big differences. Innate Territory Lords existed long before Acquired Territory Lords and are generally much more powerful. However, the biggest difference is that they were directly born from the High-Rank Black Ink Nests. Thus, when they are born, they immediately have the strength and status of a Territory Lord!”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s eyes constricted and Yang Kai was even more surprised as he exclaimed, “A Royal Lord Black Ink Nest can directly spawn Territory Lords?”

If that was the case, how come there were so few Territory Lords?

Although there were more Territory Lords compared to Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, if what Ge Chen said was true, then there should be many, many more Territory Lords. Why did the Black Ink Clan not simply create more Territory Lords and overwhelm the Human Race?

“Is there some kind of limit?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked curiously.

Ge Chen nodded, “Yes. There is a limit. I have heard other Territory Lords say that the birth of an Innate Territory Lord is inseparable from the Source Domain. In the ancient times, the Royal Lords emerged from the Source Domain with their own High-Rank Black Ink Nests. Those Black Ink Nests carried some of the Source Domain’s power in them, and only by relying on that power could Innate Territory Lords be born.”

[Source Domain…] Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao and Yang Kai were both in awe.

It was the first time they had heard the term ‘Source Domain’. The term alone caused their imaginations to run wild.

This was revealed by Ge Chen of his own accord, so they did not know if he did it intentionally. It now was clear that he did not want to die; otherwise, why would he reveal such secrets so easily?

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao wanted to urge him to reveal more and said, “In that case, the power of the Source Domain as you call it is what allowed the High-Rank Black Ink Nest to directly birth to Territory Lords, but by doing so, that power is drained and cannot be replenished.”

“That’s right,” Ge Chen said bitterly, “We Acquired Territory Lords climb up slowly through hard work and cultivation; yet, when compared to the Innate Territory Lords, we are much worse in terms of status and strength.”

“Then you guys must really be miserable…” Yang Kai snickered.

Ge Chen shook his head and said, “There is a saying among your people, the Heavens are fair in all things. Although Innate Territory Lords are born extremely powerful, they will forever be Territory Lords for the rest of their lives. On the contrary, Acquired Territory Lords who achieved our status through cultivation have a chance to one day become Royal Lords.”

“Why is that?” Yang Kai was puzzled. According to reason, the Innate Territory Lords should be more privileged.

Why was it different when it came to the Black Ink Clan?

“I don’t know,” Ge Chen shook his head, “Sir Mo Zhao was once an Acquired Territory Lord too!”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao fell silent.

It was a short conversation, but the information gathered was enormous.

Innate Territory Lords, Acquired Territory Lords, Source Domain…

There were also Royal Lords who came out of the Source Domain with their own Black Ink Nests.

Mo Zhao, who had advanced to become a Royal Lord through his own efforts, was not one of them. The High-Rank Black Ink Nest that they found at Great Evolution Pass was left behind by a Royal Lord 30,000 years ago. Mo Zhao simply took over the nest.

Without dwelling too much on it, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked, “Back to my question, is the Mother Nest… in your so-called Source Domain?”

Ge Chen shook his head and replied, “I have never heard of a Mother Nest, so I don’t know if it is in the Source Domain. None of us Acquired Territory Lords have ever been in contact with the Source Domain; however, some of us had some guesses about the existence of a greater Black Ink Nest. If there really is a ‘Mother Nest’, as you call, it in this world, then it can only be in the Source Domain.”
