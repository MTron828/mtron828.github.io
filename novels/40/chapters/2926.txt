Gao Xue Ting was going to destroy that half of the Demon Spirit as soon as she finished speaking, but Yang Kai arrived in front of the Demon Spirit in a flash, reached into the Radiant Sun Mirror’s light and grabbed the Demon Spirit.

“Junior Brother, you…” Gao Xue Ting’s beautiful face paled.

Yang Kai grinned at her, “Rest assured, nothing bad will happen. I’ll have to trouble everyone to stand guard for me!”

The others were all nervous around the Demon Spirit, but Yang Kai was completely undaunted. His years in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld made him realize that a trivial Demon Spirit couldn’t do anything to him, because he also had the extremely pure Ancient Demon Qi sealed inside of him. What’s more, he also had an Ancient Demon’s Black Eye. As they say, barefooted people were not afraid of those who wear shoes.

But he couldn’t explain that clearly to everyone, so he could only act first.

Since things had already come to this, Gao Xue Ting had no way of stopping him any longer, so she simply reminded him, “You must be careful. If anything goes wrong, let go immediately!”

“I’ll remember,” Yang Kai nodded his head.

He then sat cross-legged in the air with his eyes closed, using his Divine Sense to communicate with that half of the Demon Spirit so he could search for Gong Yue’s whereabouts.

Chen Wen Hao, Gao Xue Ting, and Feng Ming formed a triangle surrounding him. Gao Xue Ting’s beautiful eyes were fixed on Yang Kai’s body and not moving for even an instant. If she found anything off, she would instantly envelop him with the light of the Radiant Sun Mirror.

Chen Wen Hao and Feng Ming exchanged glances, both of them seeing a trace of admiration in each other’s eyes. This couldn’t be helped; after all, they didn’t have the guts to do the same as Yang Kai when faced with such a strange Demon Spirit, yet this youth took the risk despite being the least powerful one of the group. This was something worthy of respect.

It was also at this moment that they both truly felt that new geniuses emerged into the world in each age. They had cultivated to the Second-Order Emperor Realm, so their aptitudes were naturally among the highest in the Star Boundary. They were also leading figures when they were young, the rising stars of their generation, filled with vigour and determination, just like Yang Kai right now.

Times changed, but what remained the same was the rise of talented people throughout the ages.

There was silence all around, with the several dozen cultivators from that small Sect below still not even daring to move. They were scattered all over the mountain peak, and had watched their Sect Master explode and die inexplicably. Trepidation and fear had already seeped deep into their bones, and they looked upon the four Masters in the sky as if they were looking at Gods without even so much as a thought of taking revenge for their Sect Master.

They had no idea that their Sect Master’s death was unrelated to Yang Kai and his group. They thought that their Sect Master had been killed by the man named Feng Ming and further reinforced their beliefs that these Masters from big Sects were abominable people lacking in humanity.

..…

There was only darkness ahead, as if Yang Kai was walking in the land of nihility. There was no light around, nor any sound. There wasn’t a single thing he could feel. He was using his mind to communicate with that half of the Demon Spirit, hoping to trace back to its source to look for the other half. As long as he could find the other half of the Demon Spirit, he would be able to find Gong Yue.

But progress was slow. It was Yang Kai’s first time attempting such a thing and he was inexperienced, so he had to grope his way through the whole ordeal.

He explored that endless darkness for a long time before changing his strategy, splitting some of his attention to sense the outside world.

Finally, he got some results. In the darkness, Yang Kai could feel that this half of the Demon Spirit had a vague but non-severable connection with something, and he began tracing that weak link.

The darkness slowly changed. Something seemed to appear in his field of vision, but it was too blurry, so he couldn’t see it properly.

Yang Kai pushed his Spiritual Energy and Divine Sense harder and harder, even absorbing the half Demon Spirit into his own Knowledge Sea. Then, he scoured it with his Spiritual Energy, breaking through all its innate defences.

Slowly, his vision began to clear up.

It seemed to be a mountain, a lonely mountain peak with a beautiful view, pleasant landscape, and rich World Energy.

Yang Kai suddenly felt that this mountain peak looked familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before; however, since the image wasn’t too sharp, he didn’t dare to confirm where it was so soon.

This was apparently Gong Yue’s surroundings that Yang Kai was able to observe through the inextricable connection between the two halves of the Demon Spirit. As long as he could confirm the location of this mountain peak, he would be able to determine Gong Yue’s location.

Once again, he increased the intensity of his Spiritual Energy.

This time, Yang Kai saw even more. There was a figure on the mountain peak, and that person looked somewhat similar to Gong Yue. He was standing quietly in a certain spot of the mountain peak, not moving at all, as if he were dead.

Yang Kai’s current situation was very peculiar. It was as if he was inside a dense ball of liquid, blurring his vision to the point that no matter how he tried he couldn’t see clearly, making him feel anxious.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai felt like he heard something. The sound was like a faded echo, muffled and intermittent, making it hard for Yang Kai to grasp onto it.

The sound came again, and this time, Yang Kai could hear it more clearly. It sounded like a dog barking, going ‘wang wang wang’. His vision moved, and Yang Kai saw a small dog-like creature standing not far away from the blurred figure, barking vigorously.

After barking for a while, that little thing actually pounced onto the figure and bit at it.

The figure remained unmoving as if he could not feel anything.

It was at that moment that the man seemed to sense something. He suddenly raised his head and looked in Yang Kai’s direction. His sharp gaze seemed able to break through the many layers of obstacles and meet Yang Kai’s eyes across the endless void.

The blurred view changed at that moment, becoming much clearer all of a sudden.

Yang Kai’s body shook, his eyes snapped open and his jaw dropped.

“Are you alright?” Gao Xue Ting’s hands were covered in sweat. She hadn’t been this nervous since before she broke through to the Emperor Realm. But at this moment, she was speaking with a trembling voice, fearing that Yang Kai’s mind had been corrupted by the Demon Spirit.

Yang Kai shook his head, looking a little dazed.

“Did you find him?” Chen Wen Hao asked.

“Spirit Sword Peak!” Yang Kai stared at Gao Xue Ting and muttered a response.

Gao Xue Ting was stunned at his words, “What?”

“Spirit Sword Peak. Gong Yue is in Azure Sun Temple, on my Spirit Sword Peak!” Yang Kai felt just how ridiculous his words were saying them. He had the constant feeling that what he saw just now wasn’t real, that it was just an illusion, but there was nothing he could find that could prove it.

“Gong Yue is in Azure Sun Temple?” Feng Ming’s eyes also went wide, obviously a little sceptical.

“That’s what I saw,” Yang Kai stood up and cast a spell to force out the Demon Spirit half from his Knowledge Sea before he crushed it with his hand. Since he had already tracked Gong Yue’s whereabouts, this half of the Demon Spirit was no longer of any use to them.

“How did he get to Azure Sun Temple?” Feng Ming asked.

“I don’t know!” Yang Kai shook his head. Not only was Gong Yue at Azure Sun Temple, but he was also at his Spirit Sword Peak!

Spirit Sword Peak was the Spirit Peak that Yang Kai received after becoming an Elder of the temple; it was in a relatively remote location, but whether it be the scenery or the World Energy, it was fantastic, and it was also protected by a powerful Spirit Array.

That was the reason why Yang Kai felt that the peak looked familiar. Even though he had not been staying on Spirit Sword Peak for long, it was his territory after all, so how could it possibly not look familiar to him?

Gong Yue was the former Patriarch of the Gong Family, so he had profound knowledge of Spirit Arrays. The Spirit Array on Spirit Sword Peak could block ordinary Masters, but not necessarily Gong Yue.

If that were all, then Yang Kai would have just thought that what he saw was just an illusion, a trick by Gong Yue to lead them in the wrong direction.

However, that barking confirmed to him that Gong Yue really had gone to Azure Sun Temple and really was on his Spirit Sword Peak.

Because there was indeed a black creature that looked similar to a puppy on Spirit Sword Peak. Even though the creature was a little strange, it had an inexplicable strength. However, Yang Kai had only seen it twice and didn’t pay it too much attention.

“Why would Gong Yue go to the Azure Sun Temple? Is he seeking death?” Chen Wen Hao frowned. With Gong Yue’s strength, he wouldn’t be able to make it out alive if he bumped into the four of them. It was reasonable to say that he should find a place to hide, but of all places, he chose to run towards danger, heading all the way to Azure Sun Temple.

The temple was full of powerful Masters, so how could Gong Yue survive going there?

“I can’t contact them. Junior Brother, can you try?” Gao Xue Ting suddenly spoke after having been silent the whole while. After finding out that Gong Yue had gone to Azure Sun Temple, she immediately took out her own Jade Elder Token and tried to contact her fellow Elders inside the temple.

To her surprise, her Jade Elder Token wouldn’t connect.

Yang Kai quickly took out his Jade Elder Token and immersed his Divine Sense into it.

After a short while, he looked at Gao Xue Ting and shook his head, “There’s no response!”

This place was a little far from Azure Sun Temple, but of course, it wasn’t far enough to be uncontactable. If any Elders in the temple received their message, then they would have given them a response right away; however, neither of them received a response in their attempts.

“Something happened to the temple!” Gao Xue Ting’s face changed.

“Let’s go!” Feng Ming shouted, also realizing the seriousness of the situation.

Yang Kai immediately summoned his Flowing Clouds Shuttle, and the four of them entered it in a line. Then, the Flowing Clouds Shuttle made off like a bolt of lightning, disappearing in the blink of any eye.

After the four people left, the disciples of the small Sect who had been on edge the whole time gradually came back to their senses and fell to the ground, cold sweat covering their backs. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

They waited for a few moments to make sure that the senior experts really left far away and were not going to return before the remaining several dozen disciples began fighting each other for the position of Sect Master. Swords clashed as they engaged in a fierce battle for some time.

Inside the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, both Yang Kai and Gao Xue Ting had uneasy looks on their faces.

Chen Wen Hao reassured them, “Even though I have no idea what Gong Yue is trying to do at the temple, he is undoubtedly throwing himself into the net. With Temple Master Wen standing guard at the temple, Gong Yue won’t be able to stir up any waves, so do not fret. Perhaps Gong Yue will already be dead by the time we arrive.”

The worry on Gao Xue Ting’s face did not diminish, but she still responded, “I hope so.”

Looking at the situation, Yang Kai vaguely realized that something wasn’t right and quietly sent a message to Gao Xue Ting, “What’s happening at the temple? Is it something I don’t know?”

Gao Xue Ting glanced at him and answered, “The Temple Master is occupied with something at the moment. If Gong Yue is really causing trouble inside the Sect, then Temple Master won’t be able to do anything.”
