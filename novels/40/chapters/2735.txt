Chapter 2735, You Must Have Cheated

“Sure enough, Brother Ji is a true Grandmaster!” Yang Kai praised, looking at the Spirit Pill with Pill Veins. It truly was amazing to be able to refine an Emperor Grade Spirit Pill with Pill Veins. Even he himself did not often see Pill Veins when he refined Emperor Grade Spirit Pills.

This alone made Ji Ying worthy of his status as an Emperor Alchemist.

“Not at all, it is all thanks to Brother Yang that this Ji was able to form Pill Veins today!”

“This… What does this have to do with him?” Mi Qi retorted at the side, “Being able to achieve Pill Veins is a reflection of Grandmaster Ji’s Alchemy skills. How does it relate to him?”

“That’s right. If he hadn’t interfered, then there would probably be more than one Spirit Pill with Pill Veins right now!” Li Jiao chimed in.

Ji Ying shook his head and did not bother to explain as he believed that Yang Kai did not need his explanation.

Being able to refine an Emperor Yuan Pill that formed Pill Veins this time was all thanks to the pressure Yang Kai gave him. Even though he let his mind wander twice halfway through, Ji Ying was able to obtain a certain kind of enlightenment under that immense pressure, and only then was he able to achieve such a shocking result.

Otherwise, based on his usual abilities, he may not be able to produce even one Emperor Yuan Pill that formed Pill Veins out of a hundred furnaces. For one to appear in just one furnace today was truly a miracle.

But if he were to refine another furnace of Emperor Yuan Pills right now, he might not be as lucky.

Seeing that Ji Ying did not speak, Mi Qi and Li Jiao thought that he was just being polite with Yang Kai. How could they figure out all the intricacies of the situation? At once, Mi Qi said, “Palace Master Yang, we’ve already finished checking the Spirit Pills refined by Grandmaster Ji. I wonder how the Spirit Pills that Palace Master Yang refined are?”

“Heh heh, Palace Master Yang’s Alchemy skills are also quite amazing, I’m sure he managed to refine Pill Veins,” Li Jiao had deliberately put Yang Kai on a pedestal, but his intentions were obviously sinister.

Yang Kai smiled.

“Since we’ve already made our bets, take them out and let’s see the results,” Mi Qi had a smug face as if he’d already won, “Palace Master Yang wouldn’t be holding onto the Spirit Pills because he’s conscious that he can’t win against Grandmaster Ji, would he?”

Ji Ying quickly interjected, “Must the two of you speak in such a way? Brother Yang is also an Emperor Alchemist, and also the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace. We are all going to be living together in the Northern Territory in the future so we are sure to see much of each other. Why not just forget about today’s incident? Let us have a drink and let bygones be bygones while we discuss our various experiences in the outside world.”

He agreed to compete with Yang Kai in Alchemy out of impulse from anger, but now he actually began to feel a little worried for Yang Kai.

He was lucky enough to refine an Emperor Yuan Pill that formed Pill Veins, but Yang Kai couldn’t be that lucky as well, right? If he were to lose, then that would cost him five billion High-Rank Source Crystals. Both he and his First Disciple benefited greatly from Yang Kai today, especially his Disciple who was still in the midst of an epiphany. Clearly, Ji Ying’s Disciple must have gained a lot from the competition just now, so if Yang Kai really lost five billion because of him, then Ji Ying would definitely feel terrible about it.

That was why he wanted to act as the peacemaker to settle things between these three. Ji Ying had deliberately pointed out Yang Kai’s identity as an Emperor Alchemist so that Mi Qi and Li Jiao would hopefully know when to back down. As long as they could give up on this bet today, then they would definitely be able to befriend Yang Kai, and once they did so, would they have to worry about not getting any benefits in the future? At the very least, Yang Kai definitely would not refuse if they were ever to need help refining any Spirit Pills in the future.

Li Jiao and Mi Qi exchanged glances. Naturally, both of them understood Ji Ying’s intention, and both of them showed a troubled expression on their faces.

If it were any normal matter, they would be able to show Ji Ying some face, but five billion High-Rank Source Crystals were on the table here. Even if it was them, they still felt a little hesitant.

After a while, Mi Qi frowned, “Grandmaster Ji, a man is only as good as his word. Since Palace Master Yang has made a bet with us, then he should keep his promise. If Brother Li and I were to just let this go, then we would also be underestimating Palace Master Yang. I’m sure Palace Master Yang wouldn’t be happy about that.”

Ji Liao nodded, “Brother Mi is right. Please forgive us, Grandmaster Ji. It is not that we are unwilling, but… A bet is a bet, after all.”

Ji Ying’s face couldn’t help but turn a little sour from their answers. He didn’t expect that these two would not give him face even after he personally stepped out to persuade them. It seemed like they were determined to oppose Yang Kai to the end.

Just as Ji Ying was about to say something though, Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand to stop him and said, “Brother Ji doesn’t have to say anything. This Palace Master is willing to accept his losses if he were to lose.”

Li Jiao and Mi Qi were happy to hear this and liberally praised, “Palace Master Yang is truly an honourable man. If there is anything High Heaven Palace needs in the Northern Territory in the future, then just say the word. Our two Sects will surely not refuse.”

Who didn’t know cheap talk like this? If he really needed their help, then they might help depending on the circumstances. What’s more, they didn’t think Yang Kai would seek them out for help. Even if High Heaven Palace would not become enemies of their two Sects after this, they wouldn’t be getting along peacefully.

Yang Kai smiled, “This Palace Master only said he is willing to accept his loss, not that he has already lost. Are you two so confident that you can take five billion Source Crystals back with you today?”

Li Jiao and Mi Qi were both dumbfounded while the latter commented, “Let’s take a look at the Spirit Pills that Palace Master Yang refined then.”

“Yes, that’s right. We have to take a look first.” Li Jiao also nodded repeatedly.

He was definitely going to lose anyway, so the least they could do was show him his loss bright and clear.

Ji Ying sighed. Since things have already come to this point, there was nothing he could do to stop them either. Five billion High-Rank Source Crystals was indeed a high enough number for Li Jiao and Mi Qi to risk offending him.

“Brother Ji, if you could help me with the inspection.” Yang Kai tossed the jade bottle in his hands to Ji Ying.

Ji Ying caught it and nodded, “Alright.”

After saying that, he opened the bottle and poured out the Emperor Yuan Pills inside.

All eyes were on his hand, and the breathing of the crowd seemed to have grown considerably quicker.

As the three Monster Kings exchanged glances, a fierce glint emerged in their eyes. Without needing to say anything, the three of them had already decided that they would immediately take down Mi Qi and Li Jiao if Yang Kai were to lose this match.

They wanted to take away five billion High-Rank Source Crystals today? Only in their dreams!

“Nine… Nine pills?” Li Jiao’s originally expectant eyes suddenly widened in astonishment at the nine Spirit Pills on Ji Ying’s left hand, his expression instantly transforming into one of shock.

Yang Kai actually managed to refine nine Emperor Yuan Pills, which was no worse than Ji Ying at all. Didn’t that mean that Yang Kai’s mastery in the Alchemic Dao was comparable to Ji Ying’s?

It’s not like just any Emperor Alchemist could just refine nine Spirit Pills.

“Pill Veins?” Mi Qi drew a breath of cold air as he stared at one of the pills.

That one Spirit Pill looked exactly the same as the one Spirit Pill Ji Ying refined with Pill Veins. There were dense lines over the surface of the pill, like an exquisite pattern that contained some sort of profound mystery.

“Ah?” Ji Ying was also thoroughly shocked.

It was within his expectations that Yang Kai was able to refine nine Emperor Yuan Pills as it would have been stranger if he failed to do so. However, the surprising thing was the fact that one of them actually formed Pill Veins.

Ji Ying was able to achieve such a feat out of a series of coincidences and good luck, but he didn’t expect Yang Kai’s luck to be so good as well.

“That’s… That’s impossible…” Mi Qi rubbed his eyes hard as if he was afraid they were playing tricks on him, but it seemed true that one of the Spirit Pills did have Pill Veins around its surface.

“You must have cheated!” Li Jiao’s face sank as he glared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “Be careful what you say, Palace Master Li. You can eat whatever you want, but you can’t just say whatever you like! When did this Palace Master cheat?”

Li Jiao grunted, “You were the one who proposed to refine the Emperor Yuan Pill. This Spirit Pill with Pill Veins must have been obtained by you beforehand, and now you’ve brought it out to fill the gap!”

Hearing this, Mi Qi also thought it was logical. Yang Kai very quickly stuffed the Spirit Pills into the jade bottle from his furnace as soon as he was finished refining them, then he also asked Ji Ying to take out his Spirit Pills first. The jade bottle had been in his hands during that whole duration, so it was completely plausible that he could have swapped out the Spirit Pills.

[That’s right, now that makes sense!]

[What a treacherous little brat! Such dark designs are simply abominable!]

“Palace Master Yang, this isn’t appropriate, is it?” Mi Qi was blue-faced from anger. Those five billion High-Rank Source Crystals were right at his grasp, but were now up in the air because of Yang Kai’s cheating, so he wasn’t very happy. The worst part was, neither he nor Li Jiao had any evidence to prove their claims.

“Whether I swapped it in or not, just ask Brother Ji and you’ll know the answer,” Yang Kai curled his lips in disdain, not even bothering to argue with them.

Li Jiao and Mi Qi both turned their heads towards Ji Ying.

Ji Ying nodded, “These nine Spirit Pills all came out of a furnace just now. They were not made beforehand.”

“What!?”

“That’s impossible, Grandmaster Ji. Please take a closer look!”

“Are you doubting even my words now?” Ji Ying’s face turned dark, feeling extremely displeased. Even though he intended to befriend Yang Kai, he would not lie about such matters as it concerned his honour. Mi Qi and Li Jiao were simply questioning his character and credibility by making such a remark. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Both Mi Qi and Li Jiao were shocked, and only then did they come to realize they had angered and offended Ji Ying.

Mi Qi quickly said, “You misunderstand, Grandmaster Ji. Naturally, we do not dare to question your word, but we do not know what this little brat’s character is like, so we have to be on our guard. Please, Grandmaster Ji, take another look! Have these pills been tampered with in any way?”

Ji Ying answered indifferently, “Each refinement produces a batch of Spirit Pills that have unique traces that can never be replicated perfectly again. Those who have not immersed themselves in the Alchemic Dao for a long enough time will not be able to tell, but from what this Ji can see, these nine Spirit Pills all indeed came from the same furnace.”

Mi Qi and Li Jiao were both dumbfounded at those words.

“Of course, the easiest way to tell is by the fact that these Spirit Pills are all still warm. If you don’t believe me, feel free to inspect them yourselves.” As he said that, Ji Ying threw the Emperor Yuan Pill with Pill Veins directly to Mi Qi at the side.

Mi Qi caught it and felt it carefully. Just as Ji Ying said, the Spirit Pill was indeed warm and had obviously just been refined.

His heart sank into the abyss as he handed it over to Li Jiao so that he could feel it too.

Yang Kai sneered, “Are the two of you still going to say that this Palace Master cheated?”

Mi Qi laughed dryly, “Of course not, we were just making a joke, a small joke. Please pay it no mind, Palace Master Yang.”

“That joke wasn’t funny at all.”

Li Jiao coughed dryly, “Both of you refined nine Spirit Pills with a single one forming Pill Veins. So does that mean… it’s a tie?”

“A tie it is then, no winners or losers!” Mi Qi quickly added in, but the look of disappointment on his face was obvious.

Yang Kai chuckled, “The quantity is the same, even with regards to forming Pill Veins, so the deciding factor is quality. There are always differences in efficacy!”

Ji Ying nodded at his words, “That’s right. The difference in quality can really distinguish things.”
