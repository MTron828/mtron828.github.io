“You are angering this King!” Shi Huo roared menacingly from inside the Mountains and Rivers Bell, pounding and shaking it as he shouted, “Little Brat, you’d best not let this King out, otherwise, the first thing I will do is kill you!”

As soon as he said this, Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Guo’s faces turned as black as the bottom of a pot.

Just now, Yang Kai said that he was afraid that Shi Huo would trouble him after coming out, and now, Shi Huo actually said just that. Furthermore, judging by his tone, he wouldn’t rest until he had taken care of Yang Kai. Only someone totally ignorant would say such things in this situation.

“Shi Huo, enough with the nonsense!” Luan Feng couldn’t help but shout, lest Shi Huo say something beyond irredeemable.

Yang Kai pointed at the Mountains and Rivers Bell with a look of horror and added, “Sirs and Madam, did you hear him? How could I dare to lift my Soul Imprint from the Mountains and Rivers Bell!? Although this Junior’s life may not be worth much, I don’t want to die in vain either!”

Fan Wu gazed at Yang Kai and replied, maintaining a stoic face, “Shi Huo has a very stubborn temperament. It’s impossible to make him swear. You can forget about this; however, I can promise you that he won’t trouble you after coming out.”

Yang Kai snorted and stated, “You are you, and he is he, how can you tell what’s on his mind?”

Fan Wu looked at the Mountains and Rivers Bell and shouted, “Shi Huo, tell him.”

The Mountains and Rivers Bell sunk into silence before Shi Huo’s reluctant voice resounded, “Alright, this King isn’t going to argue with a little brat.”

“Good enough?” Fan Wu looked at Yang Kai again.

Yang Kai forced a smile and stated, “It’s just a word, a play with words, nothing more, nothing less. I still don’t feel safe. Why not let me take the Stone Spirit Clan a few thousand kilometres away first…”

“That’s absolutely impossible!” Fan Wu looked impatiently, “If you feel that you can’t accept this King’s condition, then we can only let Shi Huo be suppressed, and you… will stay here forever as well.”

Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, so if he was really allowed to withdraw a few thousand kilometres, Fan Wu wasn’t sure he could stop him from fleeing, so how could he agree to this condition?

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly as he asked, “Is there no room for discussion?”

Fan Wu slightly raised his hand and stated, “I will give you three breaths to consider. After three breaths, this King will kill you. Think quickly!”

Yang Kai grit his teeth as a look of humiliation appeared on his face. He was rarely forced to this degree, but today, he was really pushed into despair.

Fan Wu continued to raise his hand, his aura growing more and more dangerous.

Seeing that he was about to make a move, Yang Kai heaved a sigh and finally relented, “I agree.”

Fan Wu lightly nodded, not the least bit surprised; after all, no one wanted to play with their life. He then stoically said, “Let Shi Huo out first.”

Yang Kai made a hand seal and stretched his hand out. Immediately, the enormous Mountains and Rivers Bell rose with a thrum, revealing Shi Huo’s figure. Shi Huo’s entire body was covered in blazing black flames, and his eyes were filled with incomparable anger.

Yang Kai was as vigilant as he could be. Once he noticed Shi Huo having any ill intentions, he would immediately suppress him again. Suppressing him before was just a fluke. Now that Shi Hou was prepared, he had little chance of success.

Fortunately, Shi Huo just glared at him and let out a cold snort, not making any moves.

“Remove your Soul Imprint,” Fan Wu urged.

Yang Kai took the Mountains and Rivers Bell back, looked at it for a while, before his Divine Sense surged as he erased his Soul Imprint on the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

The small Mountains and Rivers Bell burst with a flash of light before it became incomparably quaint.

Yang Kai casually threw it towards Fan Wu.

Fan Wu flicked his wrist to receive the Mountains and Rivers Bell, but the instant he tried to take it into his sleeve, a tremendous force emanated from the bell, making him unable to catch it.

With a bang, the Mountains and Rivers Bell fell to the ground, quaking the ground for a moment. It then remained completely still, as if it had taken a root there.

“The Ancient Exotic Artifact has a well-deserved reputation!” Fan Wu’s eyes flickered with shock. Even if the Mountains and Rivers Bell was ownerless, he couldn’t pick it up. In this world, perhaps only the one who was acknowledged as its Master could control it at will.

Suddenly, violent energy fluctuations originated from somewhere.

“Shi Huo, what are you doing!” Luan Feng exclaimed at the same time.

Fan Wu’s face slightly changed as he looked up. To his surprise, Shi Huo was charging at Yang Kai with a ferocious grin on his lips. His fist covered in blazing pitch-black flames smashed down at Yang Kai as he shouted, “Little Brat, surrender your life!”

Yang Kai’s face drastically changed. Although he had been paying attention to Shi Huo, he hadn’t expected a Divine Spirit to go back on his word so shamelessly. After seeing Yang Kai’s Soul Imprint on the Mountains and Rivers Bell removed, he actually didn’t hesitate to attack him.

Caught by surprise, Yang Kai didn’t even have the time to dodge.

The scorching energy radiating from the fist seemed to be able to melt anything within several meters of it and the power behind it seemed capable of cracking the world.

*Hong…*

As the punch came down, Yang Kai grunted before he was smashed straight into the ground, his figure completely disappearing from sight.

“Hou!”

The Stone Spirits angrily roared, their eyes turning red with rage, especially the Embodiment. Watching Yang Kai smashed into the ground, the energy in their enormous bodies immediately surged, but they were restrained by many Monster Kings at the moment so they were unable to break free.

“Shi Huo! Do you know what you are doing!?” Luan Feng shouted, grinding her teeth, her pretty face colder than the ice.

Fan Wu and Cang Guo’s faces were also extremely ugly.

They had just sworn that they would let Yang Kai leave alive, but they hadn’t expected Shi Huo to renege on their promise. He was blinded by anger and ignored their credibility.

Once the word of this spread, how would the Monster Kings under them view them? How would they stand tall in the Ancient Lands in the future? The people with the highest combat power were gathered in the Ancient Lands here, and several dozen pairs of eyes were currently fixed on them.

“It’s over, it’s over…”

The nearby Xie Wu Wei’s face turned pale. He almost went limp and slumped down on the ground.

Even if he was a Monster King comparable to a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, he couldn’t help falling into despair at the sight of this scene. Although he had been far behind the four Divine Venerables, he had arrived here quite a while ago and had constantly been on edge about Yang Kai’s safety. He was secretly rejoicing for having escaped the catastrophe, seeing Yang Kai reach an agreement with the Divine Venerables, but who would have thought that Shi Huo would go back on his word and sneak attack a First-Order Emperor Realm boy!

Xie Wu Wei was Yang Kai’s Soul Slave, so his life and death was tied to Yang Kai’s. Once Yang Kai died, he would have to part with his life too.

[It’s really over! I’ve been killed by that brat Yang Kai!] Xie Wu Wei looked sad and angry. [If I knew this would happen, I would have rather chosen to die in the Ten Thousands Spirits Tomb. At least I would get to die in the final resting place of all the Ancient Lands residents. I wouldn’t be lonely after death!]

[It couldn’t be any worse! I’m going to die here for no reason and won’t even get a proper burial.]

But very soon, Xie Wu Wei noticed that something wasn’t right.

Because he wasn’t dead. He touched his body in disbelief and could clearly feel his heart beating. Suddenly, his pupils contracted as if he had realized something and he hurriedly looked towards the enormous pit.

[If I’m alive, then Yang Kai is alive too.]

[But how is that possible? How is he still alive after being sneak-attacked by a Divine Venerable?] UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Shi Huo!” Fan Wu shouted, word by word, grinding his teeth, “He had already agreed to remove the Soul Imprint from the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Why did you kill him!? Can’t you be a little tolerant?”

“Tolerant?” Shi Hou coldly snorted. The scorching flames over his body receded as he stated, “This King only knows an eye for an eye, and tooth for tooth. That brat dared to suppress this King with the Mountains and Rivers Bell. His death isn’t worth pitying!”

He turned his head and asked, suddenly turning his gaze at the three Divine Venerables, “Why, are you going to fight with this King for that brat? Give me a break, that brat is dead, and the dead are worthless.”

Although his words were offensive, they were undeniably true. What value did a dead person hold? What was the point of falling out with Shi Huo for a dead human boy?

“You shouldn’t have done this!” Fan Wu stated in a calm and composed manner. He wasn’t sorry about Yang Kai’s death, but was angry about Shi Huo discrediting them. When one’s status and strength had reached to their level, their word became more important than their lives.

“Alright, alright!” Cang Guo immediately intervened to mediate, “Since things have already happened, it’s pointless to blame him. We were wrong in this matter. Let’s bury… this human with honour.”

It seemed that giving Yang Kai a burial was the highest honour they could offer …

Luan Feng lightly nodded before sighing and proposing, “This kid should be a peerless genius. This Queen will take care of this. He will definitely not be treated poorly.”

Fan Wu nodded, fiercely glaring at Shi Huo. Whereas Shi Huo just stood there with an indifferent expression on his face. Rather he smiled and stated, “I got my revenge, it feels good!”

At this moment, the several Divine Venerables seemed to have sensed something as they looked towards a certain direction together.

Immediately, they saw a figure rushing over. Judging by the figure, it belonged to a woman, only, her cultivation wasn’t that strong, only Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

And closely following behind her was another figure with the cultivation of Second-Order Emperor Realm.

Two figures, one ahead and one behind, were quickly approaching, with the woman in the lead looking extremely anxious.

The group of Monster Race Masters in the outer ring tried to stop them, but they were knocked down by the Second-Order Emperor.

In a flash, the two figures had rushed over.

*Shua shua…*

Both of them abruptly came to stand still in the air. The woman in the lead looked at the enormous pit below with a look of disbelief. All of sudden, she started crying as tears rolled down her cheeks and fell down to the ground like pearls.

The woman in the rear was unkempt, messy, and wearing tattered and dirty clothes.

These two had rushed into the place where the Monster Race was gathered, rushed to the front of the four Divine Venerables. Their suicidal act had left many Monster Race members in surprise.

“Ruo Xi…” Embodiment, looking at the figure in the air, sighed with an astringent look on its face.

No doubt, Ruo Xi had suddenly rushed over after seeing Yang Kai sneak-attacked by Shi Huo, throwing all caution to the wind.

And the one, who came with her, was undoubtedly the Ice Heart Valley’s Third Elder.

The Third Disciple stood behind Ruo Xi with a ferocious look hanging on her face, making weird noises. She looked as if she was a beast defending its territory, warning others not to approach.

However, when Fan Wu glanced at her just once, the Third Disciple trembled as she shrank into a ball.
