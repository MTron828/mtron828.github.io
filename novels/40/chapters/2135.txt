“Is he a disciple of the Azure Sun Temple?” Lan Xun saw Yang Kai standing together with a group of disciples from Azure Sun Temple.

“What did you say, Princess?” Xiao Chen asked.

“Nothing,” Lan Xun shook her head.

Xiao Chen frowned slightly. Although he was a little upset at Lan Xun’s lack of communication, she was the daughter of the Bright Moon Great Emperor, holding a noble status, and it was inappropriate to keep asking. He followed her eyes and saw Yang Kai, and snorted coldly inside, “How could such a trivial person like him interest the Princess?”

On the other side, after killing the disciple from a small family, Wu Chang was calm and relaxed, as if he had only killed a cockroach, and continued to look at Xia Sheng with his head turned.

Xia Sheng said, “Brother Wu Chang is so strong!”

Wu Chang smiled coldly, without saying a word. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I don’t care about the life or death of others, but will Bother Wu Chang give me a reasonable explanation for attacking my Junior Sister?” Xia Sheng squinted ahead of him.

Wu Shang said, “Brother Xia wants an explanation? Sure. My explanation is that no one can fly over my head, except if they’re dead!”

Xia Sheng froze. He did not expect that Murong Xiao Xiao had been attacked for such an absurd reason.

Murong Xiao Xiao came back to her senses, pursed her lips and said, “I just wanted to go to the Star Soul Palace.”

She had an acquaintance at the Star Soul Palace that she had not seen for a long time and wanted to meet, but she got attacked by Wu Chang just as she started to fly and fell from shock.

Wu Chang said, “Brother Xia should be thankful that she is from Azure Sun Temple, otherwise...”

“Otherwise?”

“Otherwise, she would be dead!”

“I see,” Xia Sheng grinned. Suddenly, he made an unexpected move.

He leapt, as swiftly as the wind towards and over Wu Chang’s head, and with a twist of his body, he flew back and leapt across Wu Chang’s head again.

While flying, he shouted, “I flew here, I flew back, then I flew here again, and I flew back again. Hit me if you can.”

He flew several times back and forth, then landed right above Wu Chang, with his hands on his hips and looked down, “Do you believe that I will pee on your head?”

As he spoke, he pulled up his pants, preparing to do what he had just said.

Murong Xiao Xiao and a few other female disciples of the Azure Sun Temple blushed.

Xiao Bai Yi and the others were speechless, turned their heads and pretended to not know this person.

“Hahaha!” The audience laughed at Xia Sheng’s extremely crude behaviour, which was extremely inappropriate for a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

“Xia... Sheng!”

Wu Change was also subjected to shifting moods. With such a violent and perverse personality, he would not allow others to be provocative and presumptuous in front of him. He let out a low growl as Xia Sheng lifted his pants, and his arms shook violently. A tornado-like force rushed straight into the sky in an attempt to swallow Xia Sheng.

“Paltry tricks!” Xia Sheng snorted coldly, opened his palms and pressed downwards.

With a surge of Source Qi, the World Principles became chaotic, and a gigantic palm took shape and fell from the sky like a huge mountain. It had not landed, but gave everyone a destructive oppression.

*Hong...*

The giant palm collided with the tornado, and the World Energy raged in all directions.

At the same moment, Wu Chang leapt with his red and snow-white palms together, and two completely different auras were released with mysterious runes appearing around him.

He charged towards Xia Sheng like lightning.

Xia Sheng’s face was replaced by a solemn expression. With a change of his hands, clanging sounds of metals were transmitted from the void, and immediately many weapons, blades of every shape and design, appeared by his side. These weapons were formed by World Energy.

He stretched out his hand, and countless swords and blades charged downwards as ordered.

*Hong hong hong...*

The intense sound shook the air, a dazzling light burst out and swallowed both Xia Sheng and Wu Chang. For a while, no one could see the battle between the two, only the sounds of explosive kicks and punches could be heard from the void.

Yang Kai stared with his eyes narrowed, dazzled by the battle above.

It was the contest between the top rising stars from the top two Sects of the Southern Territory. In other words, it was the highest level battle of the Southern Territory. Such battles were rare for him.

Not only could he compare his own shortcomings from the fight between the two, but he could also collect more information.

“Is Senior Brother Xia going to be okay?” Murong Xiao Xiao asked, feeling responsible for what was happening. If she had not accidentally flown over Wu Chang’s head, she would not have caused such trouble.

“How could anything happen to him!?” Xiao Bai Yi snorted coldly, completely unworried for Xia Sheng’s safety, then continued, “He has a good chance to escape death if a normal Emperor Realm fights against him, how bad can it be if it’s just a Wu Chang?”

Yang Kai’s interest perked as he listened to Xiao Bai Yi.

Xiao Bai Yi obviously knew Xia Sheng well, but he did not elaborate, and Yang Kai did not ask.

Judging from the battle, it seemed that Xia Sheng did not reveal his true strength, and of course, Wu Chang was not at his full strength either.

“Childish!” In a remote area on the mountain valley, where a certain Sect named Eight Paths Sect had stationed, a cross-legged youth who was meditating and watching the battle in the air, had commented disdainfully.

Eight Paths Sect was not a top tier Sect in the Southern Territory, but it was not weak. It was on the same level as the Flying Saint Palace, and there was an Emperor Realm Master in the Sect.

Eight Paths Sect was fortunate enough to have seven slots to enter the Four Seasons Realm this time.

The cultivation levels among the seven were not equal, some were Third-Order Dao Source Realm, and some Second-Order and First-Order.

The youngster who spoke was only Second-Order Dao Source Realm, but judging from the reactions of the others, he was the leader among them.

The only Third-Order Dao Source Realm was a middle-aged man in his forties. He smiled and said, “You can’t stand battles like this, Junior Brother Luo Yuan?”

Luo Yuan replied, “They are just testing each other, nothing interesting.”

“You call this testing?” Another Second-Order Dao Source Realm woman exclaimed, “Why do I feel like they’re about to kill each other?”

“That’s because your cultivation is not high enough.” Luo Yuan replied bluntly, not caring if he had embarrassed his fellow disciple.

The woman choked for a moment, then chuckled dryly.

The middle-aged man said, “Junior Brother Luo Yuan indeed has sharp eyes. We’re counting on you in the Four Seasons Realm this time.”

Luo Yuan frowned, “Rest assured, after this expedition to the Four Seasons Realm, I will make Eight Paths Sect a renown Sect in the Southern Territory, but I’m not planning to take a bunch of trash with me, so don’t follow me when we go in, otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!”

No one dared to speak up to his arrogance, only fearing him quietly.

The middle-aged man said, “Of course we will be a hindrance to Junior Brother. You can do as you like.”

“Hmph!” Luo Yuan snorted coldly, closed his eyes, and said no more.

The others looked at each other gloomily.

It was quite unacceptable for them to be called ‘trash’, as they were all Dao Source Realm cultivators with equitable strength. However, knowing Luo Yuan’s temper and character, they did not refute.

The battle in the void continued.

Xia Sheng and Wu Chang were at a tie, none could overpower the other, the only result from the battle was the collapse of the void and the disorder of the World Principles.

“Enough!”

The majestic, furious bellow struck Xia Shang and Wu Chang like lightning, and they both froze mid-air, faces pale, and cold sweat dripping down their foreheads.

Two streaks of light flashed below them, and two people appeared.

Immediately, the light dispersed into spider webs. In a blink of an eye, it transformed into two cages, confining Xia Sheng and Wu Chang in mid-air.

The same voice echoed, “Xia Sheng of Azure Sun Temple, and Wu Chang of Heavenly Martial Holy Land, this King will confine you until the opening of the Sealed World for instigating a fight. I hope you will take this as a warning!”

Xia Sheng’s face turned green and quickly responded, “Sir Xiao, this disciple is innocent!”

He had recognized the owner of the voice and quickly begged for mercy. It was the voice of Xiao Yu Yang, the Silver Star Envoy of Star Soul Palace.

Xiao Yu Yang deliberately ignored him.

Wu Chang, who was also confined in the other cage, gave him a cold look and snorted, “Coward!”

“It’s none of your business!” Xia Sheng rolled his eyes at him and continued pleading, “Sir Xiao, please understand! This disciple has always abided by the rules! Unless someone provoked me, I would never do this kind of thing, Sir Xiao please let me go.”

He pleaded for a while before deciding that it was useless, then he changed his tone, “Sir Xiao, please at least confine me on the ground? It’s too embarrassing to be locked up in the air.”

“Will you shut up?” Wu Chang was initially not affected by the confinement. After all, it was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master who confined him, so it was only natural that he could not resist. However, what Xia Sheng had said was true, it was indeed quite embarrassing, and he became angry out of shame.

Xia Sheng narrowed his eyes at him, “What’s wrong? Did I disturb you?”

“Noisy!” Wu Chang snorted coldly.

“How dare you say that!” Xia Sheng was angry, he pulled up his pants, said, “Would you believe that I will pee right in your face all the way from here? The breeze is blowing towards you!”

The corners of Wu Chang’s mouth twitched. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

He did not want to be shameless like the other party.

He only left a cruel remark, saying “Let’s settle this when we enter the Sealed World!”
