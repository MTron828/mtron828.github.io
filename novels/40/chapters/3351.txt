At that instant, all the clansmen looked to Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun as they wanted to know what really happened.

Presently, all of Fu Zhun’s focus was on Yang Xiao and she couldn’t see anything else, which was why she wasn’t aware of the stares around her. Although her face was pale and dispirited, her gaze was still filled with happiness. That was because Yang Xiao had just explained to Zhu Qing that she was his mother. Her eternally cold gaze had softened, and there was now a sense of longing in her expression. No one could believe that she was really the famed Dragon Clan’s icy Second Elder.

Zhu Yan sighed, “That’s right. He’s Lin’er. I hid him somewhere else instead of putting him into the Dragon Grave in the past.”

Although it was Fu Zhun who had done so, Zhu Yan decided to bear the responsibility. She had broken the rules, so if the truth of the matter were to come out, even an Elder like her would be punished.

Fu Xuan’s expression changed, “So, he’s really your child?”

In response, Zhu Yan nodded gently.

All the Dragon Clan members were more pleasantly surprised than they were shocked, as they had never expected that this chubby little kid was the child of Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun. It had been a long time since the last member of their clan had been born, so the birth of this child was wonderful news. Moreover, he was the descendant of two Tenth-Order Dragons.

Fu Xuan asked curiously, “Yang Kai, how did you manage to hatch him?”

In the past, she had personally inspected the egg and concluded that there was no hope for the child; hence, it had never crossed her mind that the egg would hatch one day.

Yang Kai shrugged, “I’m not sure myself.”

He honestly had no clue about it as he wasn’t even aware of Yang Xiao’s birth when it happened. He only learned all about it after waking from his trance.

“Lin’er, come over here and let me have a look at you.” Fu Zhun’s voice was very gentle, which caused all members of the Dragon Clan to find it hard to get used to it.

Appearing to be hesitant, Yang Xiao remained hiding behind Zhu Qing. He seemed to be on pins and needles as he fidgeted awkwardly.

Fu Zhun remained tender as she put on a smile and beckoned to him, “Come here.”

At that instant, Yang Xiao scratched his face and asked for Yang Kai’s help with his gaze.

“Smelly brat, get over here!” Yang Kai said in a not so tender voice.

Yang Xiao’s neck shrank as he replied meekly, “Father has to promise that he won’t smack me after I go over.”

“Huh? You dare negotiate with me?” Yang Kai glared at him.

A dejected Yang Xiao seemed resigned to his fate as he obediently shuffled towards Yang Kai.

Seeing that, Fu Zhun nearly fainted with a crestfallen expression. She was his mother, but he didn’t respond to her when she beckoned to him. Instead, her child went over to a stranger after that person called out to him. In comparison, she looked like a failure.

Zhu Yan also sported a dark expression as he thought that Yang Kai was trying to embarrass his wife.

“Father, what do you need to tell me?” Yang Xiao hung his head low as if he had made a huge mistake, and his voice sounded lethargic.

Yang Kai grinned and replied gently, “There’s nothing much I need to tell you. It’s just that you’re totally naked now, so you should put on some clothes. It’s really embarrassing.”

After he finished speaking, Yang Kai cancelled his Dragon Transformation Secret Art and returned to his Human form. Then, he fished out some clothes from his Space Ring and helped the boy put them on.

The clothes were slightly loose, but they did suit him.

Seeing what he was wearing, Yang Xiao wriggled his limbs and became displeased as he asked, “Why girl’s clothes?”

“You should count your blessings that you have clothes to wear at all. How dare you be so picky?” Yang Kai lifted his hand in an attempt to punch the young kid’s head again, but before he could do so, he felt two people staring at him with sharp gazes.

Raising his head, he realised that Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun were glaring resentfully at him. Embarrassed, he lifted his fist to his mouth and coughed before he adjusted Yang Xiao’s clothes instead.

Yang Xiao asked curiously, “Father, why do you have clothes for a little girl?”

“I prepared them for a kid I know,” Yang Kai nonchalantly explained. The clothes of course belonged to Liu Yan. Although she was about seven to eight years old, she had a petite figure; therefore, her clothes could fit Yang Xiao fairly well. In any case, it was better than if he let the boy put on an adult’s clothes.

Yang Xiao’s gaze brightened, “Do I have a Sister?”

Yang Kai coughed, “Not yet.”

He then stole a glance at Zhu Qing and grinned, “You’ll have Brothers and Sisters in the future.”

Yang Xiao clapped his hands and laughed, “Ah! They’ll be my Younger Brothers and Sisters then. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of them.”

“It’s good that you’re so thoughtful,” Yang Kai patted the young kid’s chest to flatten the wrinkle on his dress before he spun him around to make him face Fu Zhun and Zhu Yan. After that, he whispered in his ear, “They are your real father and mother; the blood in your veins comes from them. Go over to them. Don’t make them sad.”

Then, he pushed Yang Xiao forward, causing him to stagger slightly. Yang Xiao turned around and shot him a disgruntled look, apparently displeased.

Yang Kai glowered at him in return.

At that instant, Yang Xiao became dejected, and in front of everyone’s eyes, he slowly shuffled towards Zhu Yan and Fu Zhun, his head hanging down slightly.

Presently, the Dragon Clan’s two Elders were staring fixedly at the young boy in front of them. As a man, Zhu Yan had to restrain himself. Although he was agitated, he still pretended to be nonchalant. On the other hand, Fu Zhun had completely lost control as her entire body was trembling. She lifted her hand in an attempt to touch her child, but at the same time, she appeared worried that her actions might repulse her child, so she fell into a dilemma. Nevertheless, the softness on her face was able to melt the hardest steel, looking nothing like the usually stern Second Elder anymore.

She felt bitter and resentful when she saw Yang Xiao being so intimate with Yang Kai. If he hadn’t pulled some dastardly trick behind her back, her child wouldn’t have called her an insane woman when they first met, and he wouldn’t have refused to acknowledge that she was his mother.

However, at this moment, she only felt grateful to Yang Kai. Without his push, Lin’er wouldn’t have come over to her side. Unfortunately, she could sense that Lin’er was instinctively wary of her, and he wasn’t willing to come into contact with her.

Seeing this, Zhu Qing, Fu Xuan and the others heaved a sigh in their hearts while they held their breaths and watched things develop.

After a cough, Yang Xiao sniffled and hung his head low as he said in a hushed voice, “Father, Mother.”

“Good! Good! Good!” Zhu Yan finally let out a breath and nodded repeatedly, even repeating himself three times as his eyes became teary.

On the other hand, Fu Zhun called out in a choking voice, “Lin’er!”

Lowering herself, she pulled Yang Xiao into her embrace and hugged him tightly, as if she was afraid that she would lose him forever if she let him go.

Yang Xiao found it hard to breathe as his eyes almost popped out. He instinctively felt uncomfortable, and was even a bit repulsed by this woman who was hugging him; however, upon inhaling a whiff of her fragrance, he calmed down as he fell into an indescribably serene state.

This kind of contradiction made him feel puzzled as he just let her hug him without moving a muscle.

“Second Elder’s dearest wish has finally been granted,” Zhu Qing’s eyes turned somewhat moist as she rested her head on Yang Kai’s shoulder and let out a fragrant breath, “You’ve finally done something good.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes, “What do you mean? Are you saying that I’ve never done anything good in the past?”

Zhu Qing pressed her lips together and smiled, “For the Dragon Clan, you’ve really never done anything good.”

Yang Kai snorted defiantly. He had to admit that the Dragon Clan had incurred a lot of losses because of him, but in return, they had benefited immensely from him. The Dragon Blood Flowers he had planted alone were a great source of wealth.

“Anyway, how did you hatch a Dragon Egg?” Zhu Qing looked curiously at him.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’m really not sure.”

Zhu Qing went on to ask, “In the past, that Dragon Egg didn’t have enough Source Strength, so there was no hope for it to hatch; however, it now seems that Yang Xiao’s Dragon Qi is quite abundant, so it’s apparent that his Source is quite strong. How did you make up for his lost Source Strength?”

“I’m capable of doing that?” Yang Kai was amazed. [How did I make up for his Source Strength? Was it taken from my Golden Divine Dragon Source? But I don’t think I’ve suffered any losses on my side.]

“By the way, what is his attribute?” Zhu Qing asked.

Yang Kai spread his palms, “I have no idea. I only know that he’s a little White Dragon.”

“A White Dragon?” Zhu Qing finally had an idea, “He must be an Ice Dragon then. Second Elder is an Ice Dragon after all.”

“Whatever his attribute is, his future must be bright as he is the child of two Tenth-Order Dragons,” Yang Kai grinned and thought that Yang Xiao was truly lucky. This boy was born with an almost unfair advantage. His parents were both as powerful as Great Emperors, and he was a member of the Dragon Clan. There would be no one in this world who would dare to offend him.

Zhu Qing looked smilingly at him, “Have you decided to acknowledge him as your son?”

Yang Kai replied, “What’s wrong with it? I’m the one who hatched him, so it’s perfectly justifiable that he calls me father.”

Initially, he still found the whole situation rather odd, but after Yang Xiao called him ‘father’ several times, Yang Kai figured it was totally acceptable.

Zhu Qing objected to this of course, “But that will mess up the seniority… Although I’m also an Elder of the Dragon Clan, I’m a Junior to Great Elder and Second Elder. Now that Yang Xiao calls you father, it means that you and Great Elder are Brothers. Will I have to call you uncle from now on?”

Yang Kai gasped and shot her a look, “Qing’er, don’t call me that as you please. Do you understand that you’ll make my blood boil?”

Zhu Qing pressed her lips together, “Shameless!”

While they were having a chat, Fu Zhun was still hugging Yang Xiao tightly as her tears almost completely soaked his clothes.

As a clever child, Yang Xiao extended his hand and gently patted Fu Zhun’s back as he silently consoled her. Feeling the rhythmic pats, Fu Zhun suddenly felt that she had no more regrets in life and wouldn’t mind even if she died the next moment.

As Zhu Yan took in the sight, he felt gratified and stopped blaming Yang Kai for stealing the Dragon Egg.

In fact, if Yang Kai hadn’t stolen the egg, Lin’er wouldn’t have stood a chance to be born; therefore, he and Fu Zhun actually owed him a huge favour. Initially, he was displeased at the fact that Lin’er called himself Yang Xiao; however, after giving it a thought, he decided to let his child decide on his own name. In fact, the name ‘Xiao’ bore a pretty good meaning, so he stopped caring about the name change.

Only after a long time did Fu Zhun release Yang Xiao and hold his shoulders instead. With somewhat puffy eyes, she sized her child up as if she could never take enough glances at him. Although her eyes were all swollen, happiness was written all over her face.
