“Let her go, if you want to ask something, ask me, leave her out of this. She’s just in the Emperor Realm, she doesn’t know anything,” Hei He quickly rushed over and fiercely shouted, coughing blood and gritting his teeth.

Xuan Yuan Heaven’s Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters promptly surrounded him. Hei He was outnumbered and was easily taken down in a few exchanges. His cultivation was sealed and he was left in a sorry state.

“I gave you an easy way out, but you just had to take the hard way!” Xuan Yuan Heaven’s Sixth-Order Elder coldly snorted. He looked at Hei He, and then at the unconscious woman in his hand before indifferently stating, “There’s no need to trouble yourself, this Elder will investigate it himself.”

Saying so, his Spiritual Energy madly surged towards the woman’s Knowledge Sea.

Hei He’s eyes shrank at the sight of this as he cried out in horror, “How could you use such despicable methods as an Elder of Xuan Yuan Heaven!?” The young man in front of him was actually using Soul Search!

Soul Searching Techniques were extremely vicious. One needed to have absolutely superiority in terms of Soul strength to use this kind of method. However, once a Soul Searching Technique was used, the subject of the technique would either have his or her Soul destroyed, or suffer serious damage to their Soul, so no one would do so casually.

Hei He had never imagined that this young man in front of him, who was a prestigious Xuan Yuan Heaven Elder, would so brazenly use a Soul Search on an Emperor Realm Junior.

The difference between a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and Emperor Realm cultivator who had just formed their Dao Seal was like the difference between the Heavens and Earth. When this Outer Elder used his Soul Searching Technique, the woman was unable to resist.

Her frail and delicate body suddenly started uncontrollably trembling as her beautiful eyes widened in pain. Blood immediately started gushing out of her mouth, staining her clothes red. At the same time, Xuan Yuan Heaven Elder’s expression changed from curiosity to surprise and then to excitement.

A moment later, Xuan Yuan Heaven’s Elder’s Spiritual Energy calmed down and his eyes shone brightly as a sinister grin appeared on his face, “So you came from such a place. Hahahaha, what a surprise! We were really wearing out our iron shoes while seeking our own feet.”

He casually threw the woman in his hand aside. The woman’s eyes were dull and lifeless. Although she had not died, it was clear that her Soul had been severely damaged. Even if she was not dead, she was crippled.

“You’ll die a horrible death for this!” Hei He roared in anger, thinking how his Master had handed over the Star Boundary’s people to him to take care of. He had never thought that the first time he had brought someone out, such an accident would occur. If his Master were to find out about this, he didn’t know what kind of fate he would suffer.

How could a Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder and so many Fifth-Order Masters tolerate Hei He’s outburst? They immediately launched their punches and kicks, causing the latter to vomit blood.

“Bring them along, they’ll make a good present for Brother Pei and Martial Uncle Zuo!”

…

Void Territory, a month later…

The constant struggle between the two sides had left both exhausted, but since a blood feud had already been formed, no one would back down.

Another fierce confrontation came to a close as both sides withdrew their forces.

A short time later, inside the main hall, Yang Kai was checking the number of casualties when a terrifying pressure suddenly spread from afar. Yang Kai’s expression promptly changed as he stood up and looked towards the source of this pressure, shouting, “Zuo Quan Hui!”

[Could it be that he couldn’t bear anymore and has decided to take action personally?]

Many of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Masters in the hall also wore solemn looks on their faces. Iron Blood Great Emperor and the others, who had remained hidden until now were all palming their fists in anticipation. If Zuo Quan Hui were to act, they would no longer have to remain hiding.

However, before Yang Kai could figure out what was happening, Chen Tian Fei rolled in like a ball and reported in a panic, “Sir, there’s something wrong on Heavenly Sword Palace’s side. Zuo Quan Hui is personally pursuing someone.”

“Who is it?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Chen Tian Fei shook his head, the fat on his face rippling as he replied, “This subordinate doesn’t know, it’s too far to see.”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed as his figure flickered and he appeared outside the hall the next moment. He focused his gaze towards the distance before exclaiming, “Luan Bai Feng has been exposed.”

Luan Bai Feng had been hiding well ever since she had joined Zuo Quan Hui’s side, but this time she had been exposed somehow. At this moment, she was fleeing in their direction, leaving a long trail of light behind her. Whereas Zuo Quan Hui and a large group of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was hot on her tail.

[Did she attack Zuo Quan Hui?]

He had previously given Luan Bai Feng an order to find an opportunity to launch a sneak attack on Zuo Quan Hui. Although there was a gap of an entire Order between them, if Luan Bai Feng was careful and meticulous, it was not impossible for her to succeed.

[But why did she choose to make a move now?]

Yang Kai was unable to understand this, but he didn’t have time to think about it and shouted right away, “Senior Iron Blood, please remain here for the time being with the other newly promoted Sixth-Orders, the rest will follow me!”

Since Zuo Quan Hui had made his move, it was only natural that he would not be able to sit still. In his camp, Yang Kai was the only one who could fight Zuo Quan Hui and not immediately die.

Since Luan Bai Feng had been exposed, if he didn’t go to her aid, she would most likely die.

Space Principles surged as he brought ten Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters with him and rushed forward.

As the distance between them shortened, Yang Kai could clearly see the shadow of a huge hand behind Luan Bai Feng grabbing towards her. Luan Bai Feng was fleeing with great difficulty. She seemed to be injured as her snow-white dress was dyed red.

What surprised Yang Kai was that Luan Bai Feng didn’t seem to be alone. She was holding a figure in each hand, but it was difficult to tell whether they were alive or dead.

[Who is it?] Yang Kai slightly frowned.

However, as they got closer, Yang Kai felt a faint connection. This connection was something only those who had left their names on the Loyalty List could have.

His Loyalty List was now filled with the names of nine people, among which was Luan Bai Feng’s who was before; Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hui Gu were beside him; and Chen Tian Fei, and Yun Xinghua were stationed at Void Land headquarters.

Only Hei He and Xin Peng remained.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s heart clenched as an uneasy feeling gripped him.

Space Principles fluctuated even more violently as his figure flickered, rapidly approaching Luan Bai Feng.

The giant hand behind Luan Bai Feng was getting closer, and seeing that she could no longer dodge, Yang Kai could only grit his teeth and take out his Azure Dragon Spear, thrusting it forward.

A huge black ball suddenly appeared on the tip of the spear as World Force burst forth, sending out a terrifying shockwave.

A giant black hole suddenly appeared on the huge illusory phantom of a hand that was grabbing towards Luan Bai Feng, sending out a powerful suction force.

The giant hand collapsed. Although it was still able to grab towards Luan Bai Feng, she barely managed to dodge.

At long last, Yang Kai met up with her. His figure flickered as he directly arrived beside Luan Bai Feng, asking in concern, “Are you alright?”

Luan Bai Feng nodded, her face was slightly pale, “Many thanks, Sir!”

If it weren’t for Yang Kai’s timely assistance just now, it would have been impossible for her to escape the pursuit of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Yang Kai gently nodded and looked towards the two people in her hand, meeting the gaze of one of them.

The man’s face was covered in blood and his aura was extremely weak. He looked up at Yang Kai with great difficulty and weakly called out, “Sir!”

“Hei He!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he looked to the other side, only to meet a pair of blank eyes.

“Lan Xun!”

Of the two people Luan Bai Feng was carrying, one was Hei He, the other was the daughter of Bright Moon Great Emperor, the Sect Master of Star Soul Palace, Lan Xun!

[How did Lan Xun and Hei He appear in the Heavenly Sword Palace? What did they encounter?] In an instant, Yang Kai’s mind was filled with thousands of thoughts. His heart was burning with rage at the sight of their miserable state.

“Sir, this humble subordinate has failed you, please punish me!” Hei He clearly only had half his life left, yet he was still thinking about the task Yang Kai had given him.

“Now is not the time to talk about these things, take Lan Xun to our Void Land’s encampment first,” Yang Kai suppressed the fire in his heart and quietly ordered.

Hei He nodded hard as he struggled to stand up. He covered Lan Xun with his energy before quickly retreating.

“Are you still able to fight?” Yang Kai looked towards Luan Bai Feng.

Luan Bai Feng brushed her hair behind her ear, “I won’t die!”

Yang Kai nodded and coldly looked ahead. The Sixth-Order Masters with him stood in a straight line, their auras surging.

10,000 kilometres away, the group of Heavenly Sword Union’s Sixth-Order Masters who were pursuing them suddenly stopped. There were a total of ten of them. Yang Kai’s eyes swept over them one by one before suddenly fixing on one of them.

“Yin Xin Zhao!” Yang Kai’s face sank slightly.

The nearby Luan Bai Feng reported, “He just arrived. I didn’t have time to send you a message. He was the one who brought Hei He and Lan Xun here. I escaped with them, using the excuse of imprisoning them.”

However, escaping from the Heavenly Sword Palace was not an easy task. Even though Luan Bai Feng was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, she was still severely injured by Zuo Quan Hui’s palm. If it weren’t for Zuo Quan Hui’s trust in her and his lack of vigilance, she probably wouldn’t have had a chance to leave the Heavenly Sword Palace at all.

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai took a deep breath. Although there was no air in the void, Yang Kai still felt a gust of chill blowing over him.

Fortunately, he had arranged for Luan Bai Feng to join Zuo Quan Hui’s side; otherwise, Hei He and Lan Xun would have died today. It was also thanks to Luan Bai Feng’s decisiveness that she had been able to save Hei He and Lan Xun, albeit at the expense of her identity being exposed.

Yang Kai didn’t know why Hei He and Lan Xun had fallen into Yin Xin Zhao’s hands; he could only ask Hei He about this matter later. Moreover, Lan Xun’s condition made him a bit worried. It was obvious from her appearance that she was unconscious and listless. He had no idea what kind of horrid things she had gone through.

Back then, Bright Moon Great Emperor had sacrificed his life for the Star Boundary. Without the Bright Moon Great Emperor, the current Star Boundary would have ceased to exist. Lan Xun was his only blood related descendant left, so Yang Kai couldn’t allow anything to happen to her.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a bit regretful. When he brought those 600,000 people from the Star Boundary to Void Land, many from Star Soul Palace had also come with him, but Lan Xun refused. To her, the Star Boundary was the home of Bright Moon Great Emperor who had used his life to protect it, so she was extremely attached to it.

That was why she had chosen to remain in the Star Boundary and Star Soul Palace.

Yang Kai didn’t force her; after all, there were many people who had stayed behind to guard the Star Boundary, including Yang Ying Feng, Dong Su Zhu, and High Heaven Sect’s Head Manager, Hua Qing Si. Yang Kai had also ordered Hei He to guard the Star Boundary, so he thought nothing would happen.

However, something unexpected had happened.

If he had known such a situation would occur, he would have brought Lan Xun along. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But thinking about it carefully, if it wasn’t Lan Xun this time, it could have been Hua Qing Si, or someone else.

Suppressing the roiling emotions in his heart, Yang Kai looked ahead again, but he failed to see Zuo Quan Hui’s figure. Zuo Quan Hui was clearly chasing them, but he was nowhere to be seen.
