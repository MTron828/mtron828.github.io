The battles between the Ancient Barbarian Races had always been simple and crude. It was their instinct to rush forward courageously, but that was only limited to ordinary warriors. The battles between Shamans were not martial battles, but rather competitions between their cultivations and Shamanic Spells.

For that reason, Ya had already conceived several plans to defeat Ah Niu in an instant the moment he agreed to the challenge; after all, there was no way a mere High-Rank Shaman Apprentice like Ah Niu could create any trouble for him. More importantly, he undoubtedly held the upper hand in all aspects, be it cultivation realm or combat experience.

Therefore, he couldn’t help blanking out in confusion when he saw Yang Kai rushing toward him in a straight line. [Isn’t he a Shaman? Why isn’t he using any Shamanic Spell? Why is he attacking like an ordinary warrior?]

Although the unexpected shock made Ya hesitate for a moment, he was ultimately an experienced Mid-Rank Shaman Warrior and quickly recovered, beginning his chanting in that ancient and jerky language. Waving the wooden staff in front of him lightly, the air rippled suddenly and transformed into a strong, transparent shield. Then, he continued without stopping and pointed his staff forward, sending out a ball of fire the size of a washbasin towards Yang Kai.

[I win!] These were two of the most basic Shamanic Spells, one for defence and one for offence. Even so, it perfectly reflected Ya’s talent as a Shaman. Even a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior would not be able to defend against this fireball. [This High-Rank Shaman Apprentice can only hate himself for being so weak!]

Ya calmly stood in place, unmoving, his eyes filled with a playful look as he quietly admired the scene where he had defeated Ah Niu.

When the fireball appeared, the villagers of the Blue South Village screamed in shock, their faces filled with worry and fear. Ah Hu opened his mouth to shout out a warning, but Yang Kai turned a deaf ear and ran straight towards it.

*Hong…*

The light from the explosion lit up the entire canyon so brightly that nobody could open their eyes. Simultaneously, the hearts of the hundred Blue South Village’s villagers sank to the bottom of the sea.

[It’s over… It’s over. Ah Niu is done for… How can he survive after taking such a large fireball head-on? I can’t believe we lost the Blue South Village’s ray of hope just like that!] Ah Hu clenched his fists tightly. He was filled with self-blame. He should have stopped Ah Niu from battling against Shaman Ya, even if it risked blaspheming the Barbarian Gods. That would still have been better than him losing his life.

Ah Hu and the rest regained their vision a moment later and glared in Ya’s direction. Then, they suddenly widened their eyes in surprise as if they had seen a ghost. Some villagers even rubbed their eyes vigorously before checking again.

On the other hand, the expressions of the Raging Flame Clan’s clansmen, who were originally taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune, changed abruptly. They were shocked and frozen by the sight in front of them.

Ya was standing stiffly in place while Ah Niu, who should have been defeated by the huge fireball, had appeared in front of Ya at some point. Ah Niu was staring at Ya with a smile, seemingly uninjured, with only his hair slightly burnt.

“Shaman Ya, I think I won this battle. What do you think?” He smilingly lifted his head to look at Ya.

Ya’s expression twitched slightly. He couldn’t understand how the situation ended up like this no matter how hard he thought about it. His fireball should have been a direct hit, so how did this scrawny boy avoid it? [No, I can’t just lose like this…]

“The battle has just started!” Ya roared as the ancient language sounded from his mouth again. Lifting his staff, he pointed it at Yang Kai; however, he didn’t get a chance to release his Shamanic Spell again as just as he lifted his staff, Yang Kai threw an uppercut at him.

The Shamanic Spell Shield standing in front of Ya was warped by the force, like a flying banner being hit with a rock. The force of the blow soon exceeded the limit of the Shamanic Spell Shield, and it shattered into pieces.

Ya widened his eyes to the size of saucers and a chill simultaneously ran down his back. The reason he had not dodged aside when Yang Kai closed the distance between them and stubbornly tried to release a Shamanic Spell instead was that he had absolute confidence in his Shield. He believed that Ah Niu was incapable of breaking his defensive Shamanic Spell, which is why he had calmly remained in place. Who could have known that the Shamanic Spell Shield he was so proud of couldn’t even withstand a single punch from the opponent?

[I didn’t make any mistakes with the Shamanic Spell just now, right? How is it so fragile?]

*Hong…*

A fist landed on Ya’s face, causing it to warp from the force of the blow, sending several teeth flying. Following that, a body nearly twice Yang Kai’s size flew high like a paper kite and landed heavily on the ground with a thud.

Before Ya could climb to his feet, Yang Kai lunged at him like a cheetah, grabbing him by the neck with one hand and raising the other in a clenched fist.

Grinning, he said, “Shaman Ya, will you admit defeat? Or, do I have to hit you until you admit defeat?”

That body that should have been weak suddenly became as majestic as a towering mountain in Ya’s field of vision.

“S-S-Such shamelessness!” Ya yelled furiously, his eyes filled with great reluctance to admit defeat. [If not for Shaman Niu’s strange and tricky tactics, which caught me by surprise, I would not have lost this battle! I am a Mid-Rank Shaman Warrior! He is nothing more than a High-Rank Shaman Apprentice! There’s almost a Great Realm of difference between us!]

Yang Kai sneered, “When you encounter a Barbarian Beast someday, will you also expect the Barbarian Beast to compete with you using Shamanic Spells? Will it keep its distance from you and give you time to chant and prepare yourself?”

Ya was dumbfounded, rendered speechless by those words.

“Let go of Shaman Ya!”

“Hurry up and release him!”

The Raging Flame Clan’s clansmen hurriedly gathered around and soon surrounded Yang Kai on all sides. They glared at him furiously and exuded hostility. Although hurting a respected Shaman was a huge crime for any member of the Ancient Barbarian Race, the clansmen of the Raging Flame Clan couldn’t remain indifferent upon seeing their Shaman being restrained on the ground.

Yang Kai turned his head, his gaze sweeping across the Raging Flame Clan’s clansmen coldly before his mouth curled into a disdainful smile.

“Stand back!” Ya shouted, gesturing for them to stand down.

The clansmen from the Raging Flame Clan reluctantly retreated when they heard what Ya said. Even so, they did not let down their guard against Yang Kai. If Yang Kai were to murder Ya, it would surely provoke a mad thirst for revenge in them.

On the other hand, Ya was much calmer after experiencing the reluctance of admitting defeat and the humiliation of being defeated by the weak, sighing as he admitted, “You’re right. I was careless!”

He refused to admit that his strength was inferior to Yang Kai’s, simply feeling he had been far too careless. That was the reason why he failed miserably in such an easy task.

Yang Kai understood Ya’s feelings, but he couldn’t be bothered to argue about it. Thus, he tilted his head to the side and asked, “So, this battle…”

Ya sighed, “You won. All the war trophies are yours.”

There was no need to continue struggling. Furthermore, he was too ashamed to continue struggling after being pinned to the ground.

“You have my respect!” Yang Kai grinned and loosened his hold on Ya’s neck. After getting up, he helped Ya up too.

Ya turned away and spat out a mouthful of blood, still feeling a burning pain in his cheek. Moreover, two of his teeth had been knocked out by Yang Kai’s punch just now. His face had gone numb previously, but now that the numbness was fading, he could feel pain set in.

He didn’t say much, though, as the loser had no qualifications to make demands. He simply glanced at Yang Kai with a complicated look before waving his hand at his men, “Let’s go!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The clansmen of the Raging Flame Clan fell in line behind their Shaman without a word, preparing to rush back to their village during the night.

“Shaman Ya, wait a moment!” Yang Kai called out.

“What is it?” Ya turned his head and looked at Yang Kai, puzzled.

“Shaman Ya, don’t you want these beasts?” Yang Kai asked, pointing to the frozen dead beasts piled up like a mountain.

Ya’s expression warped when he heard those words as he snapped angrily, “Shaman Niu, are you trying to humiliate me?”

He had lost the duel and was no longer qualified to receive a share of these beasts anymore. Thus, the question Yang Kai directed at him at this moment seemed to him like a deliberate provocation aimed at him.

Yang Kai shook his head lightly, “That was not my intention. It’s just that you mobilized so many of your clansmen and travelled so far… You must have been searching for food for the winter, right, Shaman Ya?”

Ya took a deep breath and let out a heavy sigh, “Isn’t that the same for you?”

Yang Kai smiled, “In that case, I am willing to share some with you, Shaman Ya!”

“What?!” Ya was stunned while even the clansmen of the Raging Flame Clan were extremely surprised, all of them staring at Yang Kai in astonishment.

“I didn’t count the numbers in detail the last time I came here; however, there should be around three or four hundred dead beasts in this mountain valley. But you see, Shaman Ya… Only about a hundred villagers from my village could accompany me this time. Even if each of us drags two beasts back with us, a large portion of them will remain here, and a heavy snowstorm is approaching, so we won’t be able to come here again once we return to the village. In other words, the remaining beasts will be left frozen here. If you’d like, Shaman Ya, you can bring the remaining beasts back to your village. Although there are not as many in number, it should be enough for the winter if you ration your supplies carefully.”

“A-A-are you really willing to do that?” Ya could barely believe what he was hearing. Was this Shaman Niu willing to share some of his spoils with them? What Yang Kai just said was basically correct. There were somewhere between three and four hundred dead beasts in this mountain valley. Moreover, they did not have enough manpower to bring back all the beasts to the village.

[Even if we only take the remaining beasts, there will be at least a hundred of them! These wild beasts are incredibly large, so each one will be enough for one person to fill their belly for an entire month! If we ration our supplies carefully, we can definitely survive the winter with this amount! But, how could this be possible? I can’t believe there are people willing to give away what food supplies they have!] Shaman Ya thought to himself.

In these ancient times, doing this was equivalent to lending out one’s wife to become somebody else’s plaything in the present day. Therefore, Ya could not wrap his head around the notion; it simply did not make sense. Whatever the case; if this Shaman Niu was being sincere, he would have earned Shaman Ya’s entire village’s gratitude.

“Of course! In the name of the Barbarian Gods, I, Shaman Niu, will give you the remaining beasts!” Yang Kai looked solemn.

With these words, Ya no longer felt doubtful. When a Shaman invoked the name of the Barbarian Gods, there would be no falsities in their words. Ya looked at Yang Kai quietly for some time before he suddenly bowed with his hand on his chest and quickly said, “Shaman Niu, please forgive me for being rude and arrogant before. Thank you for your magnanimity and generosity. The Flame Sickle Village of the Raging Flame Clan will remember your kindness forever. You will be our eternal friend!”

Similarly, the other villagers of the Flame Sickle Village of the Raging Flame Clan bowed with their hands on their chests. That was the highest courtesy the Ancient Barbarian Race could give to another.

Meanwhile, Ah Hu and the others stood behind Yang Kai with looks of pride on their faces!
