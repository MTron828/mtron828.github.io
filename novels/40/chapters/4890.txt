“Do we have a Ninth-Order Master on our side?” Yang Kai asked.

“How can we have a Ninth-Order Master here?” Liu Mu curled his lips.

Yang Kai was beside himself in shock. This was a bit different from what he had imagined. Originally, he had thought that each of the hundred or so Cave Heavens and Paradises would have at least one Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master assuming command after countless years of accumulation.

But that didn’t seem to be the case.

The Black Ink Master in Black Territory was extremely dangerous, so if there really was a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in any of the Cave Heavens and Paradises, he or she would have definitely not sat back and done nothing. No matter which Sect he or she belonged to, they would have definitely come here to handle this situation. This was the only way to ensure the smooth eradication of the Black Ink Master.

But even now, there was no sign of a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master appearing, and Liu Mu had confirmed this fact.

In other words, the Cave Heavens and Paradises really didn’t have any Ninth-Order Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

[But how is that possible? How could so many Cave Heavens and Paradises be unable to give rise to a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master after countless years of accumulation? Sure, only a few geniuses were capable of making the initial breakthrough to the Seventh-Order, but still, a few could. Could it be that none of them had successfully advanced to the Ninth-Order even after all this time?]

Yang Kai was having a hard time understanding this, but this wasn’t the time to investigate.

Staring out in the direction of the Black Ink Master, Yang Kai asked, “Can you beat her?”

“It’s not a matter of can or can’t, we must!” Liu Mu stated in a heavy voice, “Black Territory has been completely sealed off. No one can leave this place until the battle ends!”

The Cave Heavens and Paradises had obviously decided to go all out; they would either succeed or die trying. As Black Territory had been completely sealed off, the Black Ink Master would be forever trapped in Black Territory even if they lost this battle, unable to leave this place.

Yang Kai’s heart sank. The Cave Heavens and Paradises had already prepared for the worst, which was indirect proof in itself of the Black Ink Clan’s strength.

“One, two, three…” On the other side, the Black Ink Master started lightly counting, her voice quite pleasant to the ear. Suddenly, a smile bloomed on her face, “Forget it, there are too many snacks to eat. I’ll just kill all of them, then there won’t be any left.”

There were indeed a lot of people here, and all of them were either Seventh-Order or Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. The cultivators below the Seventh-Order were not qualified to participate in this battlefield.

The number of Seventh-Order and Eighth-Order in the Cave Heavens and Paradises numbered over 1,000. It had to be known that each of these Seven-Order and Eighth-Order Masters was a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who had lived for countless years and seen and experienced all kinds of things. Every single one of them would be respected by the most people in the 3,000 Worlds.

Over 1,000 people were split up into a hundred or so teams under the leadership of their Eighth-Order Masters and spread around, surrounding the Black Ink Master. Everyone had a solemn look on their faces as they stared at the giant spider-like Black Ink Master.

Although these people had long known about the existence of the Black Ink Clan, this was the first time any of them had actually laid eyes on one; her image caught them a little by surprise.

Many people thought that such an evil existence should be more imposing, but now it seemed that it was actually just ugly and disgusting.

“Go heal yourself! You may be of help later!” Liu Mu gently walked above Yang Kai’s head, his figure flickered as he arrived near the Golden Antelope Paradise Masters, standing at their forefront.

Yang Kai withdrew his Dragon Form and quickly retreated.

The Proprietress approached from behind to help Yang Kai. When they met, Lan You Ruo’s eyes were fixed on Yang Kai’s waist. There was a huge gaping wound there, with black energy lingering around the wound, preventing it from healing as his blood kept flowing out.

Lan You Ruo reached out to support him and led him back, asking with concern, “Are you okay?”

“I’ll live,” Yang Kai replied before asking worriedly, “Where are our people?”

“Everyone else has withdrawn from Black Territory. There are only the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters left here now.”

Yang Kai lightly nodded his acknowledgement. Those below the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm were not qualified to participate in this great battle. If they were allowed to remain, they would only be taken advantage of by the Black Ink Master. Once they were corrupted by the Black Ink Strength, they would become Black Ink Disciples, which would only divert the attention of the Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Making them withdraw from the front lines was the best option.

The two retreated to a relatively safe location, an abandoned Spirit Province left after one of the Ore Stars was destroyed. Yang Kai quickly found a place and sat down cross-legged.

The next moment, a yellow light glowed in his left hand and a blue light in his right. Yin and Yang merged together as the purifying light enveloped his wound.

As the World Spring had sealed off his Small Universe, the Black Ink Strength would not be able to harm him in the slightest no matter how strong it was. However, this thick layer of Black Ink Strength was lingering around his wound, so it needed to first be purified before he could heal himself.

Yang Kai had been locked in a cage with the Black Ink Master for over 100 years and had been injured countless times by her, so he was already familiar with how to treat such injuries.

Under the effects of the purifying light, wisps of black smoke emerged from his wounds and were reduced to nothingness in the blink of an eye. After a while, the Black Ink Strength was completely expelled, whereupon Yang Kai used his Wood Element Power to heal his injuries.

The Black Ink Master’s attack just before Yang Kai escaped had been quite devastating, almost cutting him in half despite him having taken his Dragon Form. It was only by luck that he had been able to survive.

It would be quite a hefty task for him to recover from this kind of grievous injury; furthermore, he had been locked inside the cage with the Black Ink Master for over 100 years, where he had to constantly be on guard. His body and mind were both exhausted, so he really needed some rest.

Suddenly, powerful energy fluctuations came from afar, followed by non-stop flashes of dazzling light.

“It’s begun!” Yang Kai muttered as he looked towards the battlefield.

He was quite far away, as such he was unable to see much.

All he knew was that over 1,000 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm simultaneously made their moves. Their Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities left colourful dazzling trails as they shot towards the Black Ink Master. By the time Yang Kai looked up, the Black Ink Master was already drowned by this dazzling light.

Even from such a great distance, Yang Kai could feel the fearsome power contained in each of these Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities.

In this world, perhaps only the Black Ink Royal Lord was worthy of being taken so seriously by the Masters of the Cave Heavens and Paradises; after all, this was an existence comparable to a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

No one could survive such an attack, not even the Black Ink Royal Lord!

Yang Kai almost thought that the battle would be decided right that instant, but to his astonishment, the Cave Heavens and Paradises kept attacking, without showing any intention of stopping.

Yang Kai was able to witness the marvelous Divine Abilities of every Cave Heaven and Paradise, all of which was extremely profound and dazzling.

But the next moment, Yang Kai’s confidence began falling little by little, because there was a giant black cloud where the lights had flooded. And the dazzling brilliance of the Divine Abilities was unable to disperse this thick black cloud no matter how they tried.

Right then, the Black Ink Master’s voice reverberated throughout the void, her voice filled with pain and ridicule, “You filthy livestock have only become weaker over the generations! Your ancestors were far better than you!”

Just as she was finished speaking, a change suddenly occurred.

It was unknown what happened, but the tight encirclement around the Black Ink Master fell into shambles, causing countless openings to appear in their formation.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s pupils shrank.

He saw the head of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master suddenly fly high into the air as a fountain of blood gushed out from his neck, raining down on his nearby companion’s head and face. When his companion looked over, he was totally confused, seemingly unable to react to what had just happened.

Although Yang Kai couldn’t see the expression on the man’s face because he was too far away, he could feel his shock and confusion.

There were some who were suddenly torn apart as their remains flew everywhere.

Some even exploded into blood mist, leaving nothing behind.

In an instant, more than ten people had lost their lives.

Each and every one of them was a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master who had taken millennia to reach their current Realm; but today, their lives were harvested like wheat from a field.

Yang Kai’s heart was gripped with fear!

Without the influence and constraints of the Super Array, the Black Ink Master’s strength had far exceeded his imagination. If the Black Ink Master was this strong during the 100 years he had been fighting her, he would have died long ago.

After the death of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, his or her Small Universe would be left behind, transforming into Universe Paradise.

Logically speaking, these Universe Paradise’s portals were hidden in the Void, so unless someone knew where they were or for some reason the portal was opened, it was difficult to find them.

But at this moment, these Small Universe’s portals suddenly exploded under a mysterious force. The World Force contained in these Small Universes immediately transformed into massive waves of energy visible to the naked eye, rushing towards the Black Ink Master before being devoured by her.

Yang Kai’s heart sank.

He thought back on the many Black Ink Disciples who had been trying to sacrifice themselves. Those Black Ink Disciples’ cultivation wasn’t high, only at the Third or Fourth-Order, but under the summoning of the Black Ink Strength, they swarmed over and crashed straight into the Spirit Array, dying without hesitation.

They had killed themselves to provide the Black Ink Master with the energy she needed to restore her strength. After their death, the World Force released by their Small Universe’s dispersed, supplementing the Black Ink Master to recover her strength!

According to Luan Bai Feng’s original plan, she would have gathered Open Heaven Realm Masters from all over the 3,000 Worlds over the course of many years. These Black Ink disciples would on one side destroy the Super Array’s Ore Stars, while at the same time, sacrifice themselves to provide the energy for the Black Ink Master to recover.

Unfortunately, this plan had been foiled by Yang Kai before it could be implemented for any significant length of time.

Now though, the instant death of a dozen or so High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had undoubtedly greatly helped the Black Ink Master.

After a brief moment of chaos, the formation of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master fell into complete disorder. Almost everyone was fighting by themselves and Yang Kai couldn’t tell what was happening, but he got the feeling that these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were fighting an invisible enemy, plunging into an abyss of misery.

A short while later, several more High-Rank Masters fell.

Immediately after, a large number of Spirit Provinces appeared out of thin air with thick Black Ink Strength lingering about them. The thick ink-like power was constantly squirming and was extremely eye-catching. The Spirit Provinces were very soon dyed completely in black.

Some High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had swiftly cut off a portion of their Small Universe’s territory.

Had they had no other choice, the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would have never acted in such a manner. Once a part of their Small Universe was severed, it would not only permanently damage their foundation, causing their strength to decline, but it would also permanently halt the progress of their Martial Dao.

Long story short, it meant that they had no other choice but to do this.
