With his powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, the middle-aged man was extremely quick in fleeing when he put his mind into it.

In the blink of an eye, he had burnt his Blood Essence and fled a hundred kilometres away.

Dread filled his heart as he looked back, only for him to turn dazed with shock. He was unexpectedly unable to locate Yang Kai’s figure from his distant position. It was as though Yang Kai had disappeared into thin air.

The middle-aged man’s heart sunk, as an ambiguous feeling of fear and terror started to spread within him.

A series of chaotic spatial fluctuations rippled out in front of him before a jet-black figure suddenly surfaced from within.

The figure was shrouded by endless Demon Qi, masking his face. However, the golden and black radiance beaming out from his face caused great waves of fear to surge within the middle-aged man’s heart.

After seeing those two eye beams, the middle-aged man’s thoughts froze, his consciousness grew chaotic and his Soul shook with unease.

With a furious howl, he immediately summoned his short spear. Forming complicated seals with his hand, Source Qi poured madly into the short spear.

*Whoosh...*

The short spear started to expand in size, and in a blink of an eye, turned into a giant pole several dozen meters in length. With a slight tremble, it proceeded to shoot right at Yang Kai.

This was the middle-aged man’s most powerful attack, and he was rather confident of it. Even Emperor Realm masters wouldn’t dare ignore an attack like this coming their way.

Acting in a similar fashion to those demons, Yang Kai appeared to have already lost his consciousness, leaving only a primal bloodthirst. Faced against the impending danger, he did not show any attempt to avoid it, simply standing still.

Only when the spear was just about to reach his body did he send a fist forward.

His fist was enveloped in jet-black demonic Source Qi, so dense that it appeared corporeal.

“You’re courting death!” The middle-aged man could not help but exclaim loudly in happiness. He opened his eyes wide, wanting to see the result of his attack, to see Yang Kai being smashed into bits.

*Boom...*

A massive sound rang out. Yang Kai did not move an inch from his original location, but the incoming spear was met with a berserk energy blast. The long spear body instantly turned dim, before transforming back into its original smaller size. Moreover, it was sent flying backwards at a speed faster than it had moved at during the start of the attack, before disappearing without a trace.

“Huh?”

The middle-aged man’s eyeballs were almost popping out of their sockets, as he was utterly incapable of believing what he had just seen. He rubbed his eyes vigorously, before taking another look, and indeed, saw Yang Kai’s completely unhurt appearance.

Just as he thought he had lost his mind, Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand.

Great amounts of pure Demon Qi gushed out from his body, before flowing to his arm, causing it to seemingly grow in size.

In the blink of an eye, a gigantic jet-black palm took shape, before patting down towards the head of the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man’s face lost all colour as he made a hasty attempt to evade. Nevertheless, despair filled his heart as he discovered that the space around him had unknowingly solidified into a glue-like substance, turning into a makeshift prison around him.

He was utterly incapable of evading.

All of the blood drained from the middle-aged man’s already deathly pale face. With a loud shout, he summoned a shield-like defensive artifact. Sending his Source Qi into it, the artifact immediately transformed into a barrier before him.

Not only that, he continued to form hand seals, while rapidly muttering, “Heaven, Earth, Mystery, Martial...”

Source Qi within his body surged madly.

Before he could properly execute that unknown Secret Technique, the jet-black mountain-like palm had already smashed down.

*Crack...*

The barrier formed by the shield artifact shattered like a piece of glass, as countless cracks formed across its surface before it shattered into pieces, unable to provide any defence at all. In the next instant, the giant palm landed on the middle-aged man’s body.

He was only able to let out a terrified shriek before there was silence. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As the giant palm gradually dissipated, other than the gigantic palm print, the only thing left on the ground was a pile of mush.

Under that palm, the middle-aged man with a powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation was utterly incapable of resisting and was immediately smashed to death. Even the artifacts and Space Ring he carried had been shattered into pieces.

The items in his Space Ring were sent into an eternal exile in the void.

After accomplishing that feat, a totally emotionless Yang Kai raised his head and looked in the other direction.

Over there, Hua Qing Si, who had split up with the middle-aged man when both of them had fled, turned her head around in dread, her beautiful eyes trembling in fear. Just a moment ago, she was faintly able to hear the miserable shriek ringing from the far distance, which caused terror to fill her heart, while also pushing her to increase the speed at which she was fleeing.

However, right at this moment, the space before her turned blurry, before a jet-black figure appeared to obstruct her path.

“How’s this possible?” Hua Qing Si’s expression changed drastically, while her heart sank to an all-time low.

She and the middle-aged man had fled in different directions. After that, she had personally witnessed Yang Kai pursuing the latter. However, within a few breath’s time, Yang Kai had actually managed to kill that man before arriving here to obstruct her path?

This was a feat that even Emperor Realm masters couldn’t accomplish!

Looking at the jet-black figure and sensing the malicious and bloodthirsty aura radiating from him, Hua Qing Si’s face turned pale, while a bitter frown appeared at the corner of her mouth.

Nevertheless, she did not immediately take action. Instead, she made a faint smile, and in her terror, displayed her charm and elegance.

Since he was able to kill the middle-aged male in a single strike, this meant that he was also capable of destroying her at will. Therefore, there was no use in putting up any resistance at all.

At this moment, the only thing she could hope for was to awaken Yang Kai’s consciousness that was hidden in the deepest part of his heart.

“Little Brother...” Hua Qing Si said in a soft voice, her voice containing a gentleness that had never been there before. “Could you give way? You’re blocking my path.”

Yang Kai did not move an inch, continuing to stand at this original location as he quietly stared at her, appearing as though he was looking right at a stranger he had never met before.

The mysterious black and golden light beaming from his eyes filled Hua Qing Si’s heart with dread, though she was helpless to do anything about them.

She felt just like a little lamb coming face to face with the savage king of the jungle, with her fate resting in the other’s hands.

The only thing that Hua Qing Si could feel fortunate about was that Yang Kai did not immediately take action upon seeing her, giving her a glimmer of hope for her survival.

“It’s your elder sister. Do you remember me, Little Brother?” Hua Qing Si pushed her loose hair strands behind her ear as she continued her attempts to get through to him.

For good or bad, Yang Kai appeared to be affected by the words she had said, as his eyelids started to tremble violently, as though his consciousness was struggling to break through.

“Little Brother, I’ve just saved your life just now... you aren’t going to kill me and repay my kindness with enmity, right?” Hua Qing Si’s robes were drenched by the cold sweat coming from her body, revealing her beautiful and voluptuous figure. Huge beads of sweat rolled down along the curves of her face, deathly pale in shade yet stubborn and resolute.

“ROAR...”

All of sudden, the Demon Qi-cladded Yang Kai clutched his head, letting out a deep roar in the process.

Hua Qing Si was terrified by his sudden actions, causing her to retreat a few steps. However, a thought flashed through her mind. With his strength, it wouldn’t matter how far she retreated. This caused her to chuckle bitterly in helplessness, before standing her ground.

“If you’re not going to talk... this elder sister will leave, okay?” Hua Qing Si tested the waters with a gentle voice. Not getting any response from Yang kai, she exclaimed in happiness, “Our friendship wouldn’t change, just like the mountains and streams! Till we meet again!”

After saying those words, she displayed her Divine Ability to split herself into butterflies once again, transforming into countless five-coloured butterflies that fled into the distance like a berserk gale.

However, right at this moment, Yang Kai suddenly straightened his body and extended his hand, before grabbing fiercely at the location the countless butterflies were headed towards.

The butterflies dissipated away, revealing Hua Qing Si, who wore an ugly and bitter look on her face.

Feeling somewhat angry, she shouted out, “What the hell do you want? You didn’t even say a single word, and you won’t let me go! What? You just want to kill me!?”

Turning a deaf ear to her words, Yang Kai made a grab towards the location she was at.

“Huh?” Shock flooded Hua Qing Si’s heart as she exclaimed, “I’m just joking, okay? How can you not know it? No, noo...”

As words left her mouth, she desperately summoned her Source Qi in defence.

However, with the disparity of her strength compared to Yang Kai, it meant that he could suppress her with ease.

Before her Source Qi could surge out of her body, Hua Qing Si felt her body tighten, as though she had been bound by an invisible force. A stifling feeling came flooding over, followed by confusion as her Divine Sense grew chaotic before her vision blacked out.

When she was finally able to react, Hua Qing Si stared blankly at the wide and spacious wilderness she now stood in, her pale face appearing just like a sheet of snow.

Turning her head in all directions, she discovered that the ground was flat, dense vegetation surrounding where she stood. A mighty wind blew by, making her feel content with its refreshing breeze.

This wasn’t the Star Boundary!

Right from the beginning, Hua Qing Si could feel the difference between this place and the Star Boundary. She wasn’t able to explain this strange feeling, but she nevertheless was able to confirm that this place was definitely not the Star Boundary.

[Am I dead?] A blank look appeared on Hua Qing Si’s face as she stood there, bewildered.

[So death isn’t as terrifying as I had imagined it to be. I didn’t even feel like I had died at all...]

[So, would a person come to a place like this after death? Then where did that irritating fellow from the Flying Saint Palace go? Could this place be the legendary Netherworld?]

“Oh... He actually didn’t kill you. Instead, he sent you in here. From the looks of it... the main body’s consciousness is still present! At the very least, he still has some level of control!”

All of a sudden, thunder-like sounds rang out in Hua Qing Si’s ears. The voice was so powerful it sounded like the beating of war drums, giving Hua Qing Si a big scare.

“Who is it!?” Hua Qing Si’s expression changed drastically as she shouted out in vigilance, turning her head to scan in all directions. Nevertheless, she wasn’t able to detect anybody.

“Above, look above!” The voice rang out once again.

After the reminder, Hua Qing Si hastily raised her head.

What entered her vision were two stone pillar-like existences that stood by her side.

When she had just arrived here, she had already noticed those two stone pillars. However, her mind was still stuck within the ‘I’m dead’ mentality, so she did not think twice about them.

At this moment, after taking a closer look, a myriad of expressions flashed through Hua Qing Si’s face, from astonishment, to shock, amazement, and surprise.

After finally gaining a clear look of what exactly was by her side, Hua Qing Si made a small step and floated several dozen metres back.

Looking from a distance, Hua Qing Si was finally able to see with greater clarity.
