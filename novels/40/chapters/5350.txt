Yang Kai might have seen so many deaths that he was already accustomed to it, but his mood still became heavy.

There were not many Special Operations Squads. Each Great Pass only had a handful at most, and each of their Squad Leaders had a high chance of advancing to the Eighth Order.

Many of the current Eighth-Order Division Commanders once used to be Squad Leaders of such elite Squads.

Not to mention, the Snow Wolves Squad had 10 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in total, so it was not just Yao Kang Cheng who had good chances of advancing to the Eighth-Order.

Now that they had been completely wiped out, the Human Race had lost a couple Eighth-Order seedlings.

But this was still not what weighed most heavily on Yang Kai’s mind. The thing he was most concerned about was the condition of the Royal Lord, and whether or not the Royal Lord had personally killed the Snow Wolves Squad.

Unfortunately, no one knew what had happened back then, so the only way to learn what happened was to wait for the real war to begin.

Yang Kai put away the remains of the Warship before his aura surged. He was like a bright lamp in this dark and dreary void filled with the Black Ink Strength. The next moment, he left a dazzling trail of light in his wake as he shot off, searching for a target to vent his anger.

Yang Kai encountered the returning Black Ink Clan forces in the vast void from time to time, and all the Black Ink Clansmen he ran into were mercilessly killed.

Five days later, Yang Kai, who was hunting the Black Ink Clan, suddenly noticed powerful energy fluctuations coming from a certain direction. Someone was fighting!

He immediately flew towards the source to check up on the situation; whereupon he saw a Human Warship circling around a Low-Rank Black Ink Nest, attacking it until it was riddled with holes.

A Feudal Lord stood atop this Black Ink Nest, angrily roaring while casting a series of Secret Techniques, though he was unable to do anything to the Warship.

When the two races encountered each other in the void, the Humans, who possessed Warships, always had a huge advantage. Whereas the Feudal Lords, who were unwilling to abandon their Black Ink Nests, essentially became a target.

What’s more, at this point, it was basically impossible for the Feudal Lords to abandon their Black Ink Nests. A Feudal Lord could use his or her Black Ink Nest to empower themselves and fight back against the Human Squads, but if they abandoned it, they would lose all their chances of making it out alive.

The Human Squad was just an ordinary Squad with a dozen or so members, led by two Seventh-Order Masters.

By the time Yang Kai arrived, the Black Ink Nest was already on the verge of collapsing. A few High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen courageously shot straight towards the Warship under the orders of the Feudal Lord, but none of them was able to even get close before being blown to pieces by various attacks fired by the Warship’s arrays.

By the looks of it, this group of Black Ink Clansmen would not be able to hold on for much longer. The Black Ink Nest would be destroyed in at most an hour, and by then, only one or two Feudal Lords would remain alive.

Victory was set in stone for the Humans!

The Feudal Lord’s heart jumped into his throat and he immediately turned his gaze towards Yang Kai, but all he saw was a rapidly approaching spear tip.

A shockwave spread outwards as Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord flew past each other, continuing on for several tens of thousands of kilometres before they stopped and stabilized themselves. The next moment, Yang Kai’s skin split apart as blood spurted from a fresh wound that had been inflicted on him.

The Feudal Lord’s desperate counterattack had ultimately managed to injure Yang Kai.

The number of Black Ink Nests Yang Kai had destroyed in the past few days since the war started was hard to count, and the number of Feudal Lords that had perished at his hands was even higher.

Furthermore, Yang Kai would always go all out every time he attacked, trying to eliminate the enemy in the shortest time possible so that he could quickly rush to the next location.

It was impossible to remain unscathed in such a high-intensity battle.

Currently, the number of wounds on Yang Kai’s body was almost the same as the number of Black Ink Clansmen he killed. If it wasn’t for his powerful Dragon Vein, these wounds alone would have rendered him immobile.

The strongest aspect of a powerful Dragon Vein was its tenacity and recovery ability. So, Yang Kai did not take these small wounds seriously.

On the other hand, at this moment, the huge Black Ink Nest behind Yang Kai had been split in half, and the Master of the Black Ink Nest, the Feudal Lord who had clashed with him, was missing half of his body.

The Feudal Lord was not dead yet, but he was quickly reduced to blood mist under the constant barrage of the Human Race Warship.

By the time Yang Kai returned to the battlefield, the fight was already over.

The Squad Leader must have seen Yang Kai before as he quickly stepped forward and greeted, “Brother Yang!”

He was secretly in awe. Yang Kai’s entire body was currently surrounded by a thick murderous intent, one so dense that it was almost tangible, which was proof of just how many Black Ink Clansmen he had killed over these last few days.

Yang Kai’s body was covered in blood and wounds, the glorious trophies of his battles along the way.

Yang Kai nodded slightly before curiously asking, “Where did you come from?”

He had not seen the two Seventh-Order members of this Squad among the 500 Seventh-Order Masters assigned to him previously. Although he didn’t know all 500 of them personally, he still had some impression of their faces.

The Seventh-Order Master, who had greeted him, replied, “A number of us were deployed from Great Evolution Pass under orders from the Army Commander to intercept the fleeing Black Ink Clansmen.”

Yang Kai immediately understood. Xiang Shan’s arrangement was thorough and reasonable.

500 Seventh-Order Humans had been sent to ambush the Black Ink Clan’s outer defence line, but once the Black Ink Clan received the news about the impending attack, the Feudal Lords on the periphery would definitely be recalled to the Royal City.

On the other hand, Great Evolution Pass was right ahead of the returning Feudal Lords. So, Great Evolution Pass had deployed a few Squads to intercept these returning Feudal Lords.

Yang Kai also realized that he must have killed his way around the entire perimeter of the Royal City, otherwise he wouldn’t have encountered someone from Great Evolution Pass.

Yang Kai did not waste any more time on small-talk. He raised his Azure Dragon Spear and cautioned, “Be careful, if you encounter a strong enemy, try to team up with the other Squads. There should be some of our people nearby.”

Yang Kai instantly teleported away after having cautioned the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

All of them had witnessed Yang Kai’s might with their own eyes. The same enemy, against whom their Squad had been battling for a long time, was taken out by Yang Kai in just one attack.

There was a massive gap between them.

The others in the Squad consoled their Leader with a smile, “We don’t have that kind of power, so we can’t move alone, but there is no need to belittle ourselves. War is not fought by one man alone.”

The Seventh-Order Squad Leader nodded in agreement, “That’s right, this is a war, a life and death struggle between two races. We just have to do what we are capable of doing.”

Next, he pointed in a certain direction and shouted, “Let’s head in that direction!”

Everyone loudly responded as the Warship set sail.

Elsewhere, Yang Kai silently calculated the speed and route of the Black Ink Clan’s forces before he proceeded around the Royal City once more while slowly approaching it, moving in a large spiral path.

Everyone was drawing closer to the Royal City; the Human Race was like this, and so was the Black Ink Clan. At some point, they were bound to run into each other.

A great war could break out in the inner ring of the Black Ink Clan’s defence line at any moment.

The Humans had killed innumerable Black Ink Clansmen, while suffering almost negligible casualties.

The Black Ink Clan had spent a great deal of time and effort to construct a massive defence line. Originally, they thought that they could use it to block the Human Race’s advance, but now, this defence line was nothing more than a flower vase. It could even be considered a burden.

All the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests had been moved to the outermost ring in order to expand this defence line, which meant thousands of Black Ink Nests and at least twice as many Feudal Lords had been sent out. Individually, the forces of these Black Ink Nests weren’t worth considering, but taken as a whole, over 5,000 Feudal Lords and dozens of times more soldiers was a formidable force.

Such manpower was indispensable to the current Black Ink Clan.

If such a force were to be cut off and eliminated before the real battle even began, the Black Ink Clan’s overall strength would suffer greatly. Furthermore, the loss of so many Feudal Lords would result in a big gap in the command hierarchy between the highest and lowest levels of the Army.

After several days of continuous ambushes and raids, the Black Ink Clan had lost over 2,000 Feudal Lords and at least 10 times as many High and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen.

If these 2,000 Feudal Lords and tens of thousands of Black Ink Clansmen were gathered in one place, the Human Race Army would have to pay a huge price to eliminate all of them.

But so far, the Human Army had lost less than 30 soldiers.

The reason for this was because these Feudal Lords were scattered quite far away from each other. As long as the Human forces found an opportunity, they were quickly eliminated one by one.

The war had yet not started, but the Humans had already established a great advantage, so how could they not win?

While the Human Squads were triumphantly advancing, the Black Ink Clan was fleeing in a great panic, fleeing in the Royal City’s direction. In the end, only a very few managed to escape from the Human Race’s pursuit and interception.

Only the Black Ink Clansmen in the direction opposite of Great Evolution Pass’ arrival stood a chance of escaping back to the Royal City.

Of course, if they were down on their luck, they might run into Yang Kai, who was circling around the Royal City.

After 10 days, Yang Kai was flying across the void with his spear, blankly looking around.

It had been over a day since he had last seen any Black Ink Clansmen, and it was not as if they had all been killed.

The Black Ink Clansmen stationed at the outer defence line were a month’s journey from the Royal City if they were bringing their Black Ink Nests along with them. Great Evolution Pass was only discovered 15 days after it crossed the periphery of the defence line, so the Black Ink Clan should have started heading back to the Royal City after receiving that message.

Only 10 days had passed since Great Evolution Pass was discovered. In other words, the returning Black Ink Clansmen who were still alive should still be some 20 days away from the Royal City.

Some of them might have been faster, and some might have been slower, some would have been farther from the Royal City and some would have been closer, but all in all, there would not be that much gap between them.

But Yang Kai failed to find any. There was nothing but empty void around him.

About 30% of the Black Ink Clansmen in the outer defence line had been eliminated, so the remaining 70% must be scattered in various directions. It might seem that there were still quite a lot of them alive, but it wasn’t that easy to find them.

After a quick calculation, Yang Kai realized that Great Evolution Pass was now just a few days away from the Royal City.

The huge battle was imminent!

Yang Kai stared into the void for a while before putting away the Azure Dragon Spear and disappearing soon after.

The final battle would be fought at the Royal City in a few days. Considering this, the best course of action was to conserve his strength, so he returned to Great Evolution Pass!

Yang Kai reappeared aboard a Purifying Black Ink Battleship anchored in Great Evolution Pass.

Before he could regain his senses, a hubbub of noises entered his ear.

“Don’t block the way, keep moving, keep moving.”

“Eh, so soft… what is it?”

“Which little bastard is touching this Great Aunt? Surnamed Cao, was it you!? I knew it! You always had dirty intentions towards me! You always pretended to be dignified, but today you’ve finally revealed your true colours!”

“Junior Sister, what are you saying? I never had any dirty intentions towards you!”

“What do you mean? Are you saying this Great Aunt is ugly?”

“No, no, absolutely not…”

“What do you mean then? Explain yourself!”

…

“Senior Brother, you’re stepping on my foot.”

“This Old Master is injured, my guts are flowing out, which blind fool even knocked into this Old Master’s wound, Aiya… it hurts like Hell.”

…

“Keep moving, keep moving, don’t stop!”

Yang Kai was completely dumbfounded.

Looking around, he soon noticed that the Universe Array was completely overcrowded with people continuing to teleport back from the outside. It was so cramped that people were literally stepping on each others’ toes.
