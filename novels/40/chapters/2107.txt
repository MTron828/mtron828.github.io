In the Small Sealed World.

After an unknown amount of time, Yang Kai slowly woke up.

When his eyes snapped open, the previous scene ran across his mind and he promptly sat up in surprise, then furrowed his brow and started observing the state of his body.

He discovered in surprise that the source of his trouble, the Demon Qi, had disappeared completely and there wasn’t even a wisp of it left in his body.

But, an indescribable pain was spreading from his belly, it was a scorching, yet bone-chilling pain, and it was very strange.

He quickly lowered his head to observe his belly and he discovered a strange golden-silver pattern there, as if it had been branded on his flesh.

“What the hell is this?” Yang Kai observed that mark in bewilderment.

When his consciousness fell upon the mark, his vision went black, as if the whole world had suddenly descended into darkness. Frantic roars were reverberating among the boundless darkness, as if something confined there was attempting to break out.

Yang Kai was astounded and he bit on his tongue. He made use of pain to recover his sobriety.

As he took another look ahead of him, there wasn’t any boundless darkness left, and everything he had just seen was a mere illusion.

“Is it a seal?” He raised his brows and revealed a surprised expression.

At this moment, he finally understood what had happened.

The golden-silver mark branded on his belly was obviously a profound seal, which had sealed the Demon Qi in his body and the strand of Demon Sense in his Knowledge Sea.

“Does such a thing exist in this world?” He let out a muffled shout and his expression changed dramatically.

He had already experienced that Demon Qi and Demon Sense, and was clearly aware of the density of the former and the ferocity of the latter.

Even with his current power, after he had been engulfed by Demon Qi and controlled by Demon Sense, he became able to contend against three First-Order Emperor Realm Masters. Its great power could be discerned from this.

But at this moment, a naturally formed seal suppressed them, and if he didn’t pry into it closely, he wouldn’t have even noticed that his body still contained Demon Qi and Demon Sense. [How strong is this seal?]

Upon thinking of this, Yang Kai turned his head around to gaze at the Golden-Silver Tree, and a stupefied look appeared on his face.

The Golden-Silver Tree had been growing well, yet at this moment, its leaves were yellow and drooping, as if they lacked enough nutriment, while its golden and silver radiance had disappeared completely.

It looked like it had lost most of its vitality!

The seal had obviously been formed by the mysterious power of the Golden-Silver Tree, and it had ended up in this state after its power was extracted.

The Golden-Silver Tree had been in the medicine garden for only a year, but the Small Sealed World’s medicine garden contained innumerable plots of Heavy Earth and five Earth Vein Crystals, which was excellent for spirit grasses’ growth.

A year in the medicine garden was equivalent to a hundred years in the outside world!

The Golden-Silver Tree’s hundred years essence had been extracted by Yang Kai, and it wouldn’t be strange for the natural seal formed by such a thick essence to suppress Ancient Demon Qi.

Upon thinking of this, Yang Kai was shaken up at first, then delight welled up in his heart.

If he wasn’t wrong, then he wouldn’t have to worry about the Demon Sense’s corruption in the future.

He didn’t know how long the seal on his belly would last, but as long as the Golden-Silver Tree had another year here, then it would again form that mysterious power, and even if the seal weakened, he could draw help from the Golden-Silver Tree’s power to continue suppressing the Demon Sense.

He was very curious about what kind of Exotic Ancient Tree possessed such great power!

As such a thought ran across his mind, he stretched his hand and flickered to the Embodiment and Hua Qing Si to where he was.

“Have you resolved it?” The Embodiment observed Yang Kai and didn’t detect any Demon Qi on him. He was quite baffled!

Yang Kai nodded and used his Divine Sense to transmit relevant info to his Embodiment.

After he mulled it over, the Embodiment understood everything. He nodded and said, “So, that’s how it’s!”

The Embodiment also looked toward the Golden-Silver Tree with a flickering gaze.

“Little brother, hi,” Hua Qing Si revealed a faint, yet weird-looking smile with great difficulty. Yang Kai’s former might had traumatized her. Fu Si Tong’s power wasn’t any lower than hers, yet he had been easily swatted to death by Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn’t kill her immediately, but she had been imprisoned by him and didn’t have any sense of security, that’s why, as she spoke, she deliberately revealed her charm. She said, “I was quite worried about you because of your previous dire state.”

Yang Kai cast an indifferent glance at her and didn’t comment over her statement. He said, “I’ll ask you a question.”

“Little brother, go ahead and ask,” Hua Qing Si said sheepishly.

“Can you recognize this tree?” Yang Kai pointed at the Golden-Silver Tree and spoke.

In his eyes, Hua Qing Si was a member of the Star Soul Palace with pretty good power, and she must be quite knowledgeable. That’s why she might know something about it.

But, he quickly noticed that once Hua Qing Si cast a glance at the exotic tree, only confusion appeared in her pretty eyes. She obviously couldn’t recognize it!

But, the Immortal Tree next to it emitted an astounding Life Force, and Hua Qing Si couldn’t help but cast several glances at her and an unusual light flashed past her pretty eyes.

“This is the Immortal Tree,” Yang Kai explained.

Hua Qing Si’s body shook and an astounded look appeared on her at first, then her face immediately fell, and she covered her ears and shook her head. She started mumbling morbidly, “I don’t want to hear anything, I don’t want to hear anything...”

Yang Kai was taken aback and he cast a glance at the Embodiment. He asked, “Did this woman go crazy?”

The Embodiment chuckled in response, “The more she knows, the more precarious her situation will become. She’s quite clever.”

“So, that’s why...” Yang Kai nodded and looked mockingly at Hua Qing Si. He said, “It doesn’t matter whether you heard it or not, in any case, you won’t get back your freedom.”

“Smelly brat!” Anger appeared on Hua Qing Si’s face and she looked at Yang Kai with gnashed teeth. She said, “Did I ever offend you? Why do you have to torment me? Did you forget that I have once saved your life when you were in danger? It’s me who saved you, and if I didn’t intervene in time, you would have been killed by that useless Fu Si Tong, yet you didn’t show any gratitude. Rather, you repaid kindness with malice. I must have been blind to save you. If I had known that it’ll end here, I would have left you to die. At least, I wouldn’t have to suffer in this prison.”

She revealed an infuriated look, and she stood at the moral high ground, as she criticized and denounced Yang Kai with forceful and resounding words, and she only got more worked up the more she spoke and her pretty face got flushed out of fury, while her chest heaved up and down.

Yang Kai didn’t utter a word and only looked at her with great interest. He waited for her to finish her speech before he shook his head and said, “Even if you didn’t intervene, Fu Si Tong wouldn’t have been able to harm me, and if he really dared to attack me, it’s only him who would suffer.”

Yang Kai was very confident about this!

At that time, Yang Kai wasn’t able to control his body, but it wouldn’t be easy for anyone to break through the Demon Qi engulfing his body. If Fu Si Tong dared to assault him, he would have faced the backlash and counterattack of the Demon Qi.

“Despite this, you can’t deny that I intended to save you, and I’m your benefactor. You can’t treat me like this and imprison me there,” Hua Qing Si said through gnashed teeth.

“Didn’t you have your own selfish reasons for saving me?” Yang Kai looked with a smile at her.

Hua Qing Si said angrily, “I have no enmity with you and I didn’t even know you prior to this ordeal, so what selfish reason would I harbour? Don’t tell me you think I have taken a liking to your handsome face?”

“Aren’t you from the Star Soul Palace?” Yang Kai asked this question out of the blue.

“That’s right,” Hua Qing Si said proudly and threatened him. “I’m from the Star Soul Palace. If you’re sensible, then hurry up and let go of me, or you’ll end up facing great trouble.”

“I didn’t kill Han Leng, but I was at the scene when he got killed,” Yang Kai squinted his eyes and spoke.

“What are you talking about?” Hua Qing Si looked around diffidently.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Fu Si Tong came to Maplewood City to investigate Han Leng’s cause of death. So, didn’t you also come here for the same reason?” He said confidently and calmly, “Besides this, I can’t think of any other reasons for masters of your calibre to visit the little and insignificant Maplewood City.”

“Can’t I just say that I have passed by here on the way?” Hua Qing Si said obstinately.

“You really came because of Han Leng’s death, didn’t you?” Yang Kai looked in surprise at her.

This had been only his own conjunction, but now, he was completely sure of it. When he spoke a while ago, Hua Qing Si’s emotions fluctuated a little, but she had hidden it well.

If they were outside, Yang Kai wouldn’t have been able to detect it, but they were now in the Small Sealed World and nothing could escape his Divine Sense.

“Did you just trick me?” Hua Qing Si was taken back and she spoke out of exasperation.

“You have come to investigate a banished disciple. It looks like Han Leng either has an outstanding familial background or carried an important secret.” Yang Kai wore a pensive look and stroked his chin. It looked like he was only talking to himself, but his Divine Sense didn’t leave Hua Qing Si even for a moment. “The former possibility is quite unlikely, as it’s said that the Star Soul Palace has hunted him down many times, and if he has any outstanding familial background, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a miserable state. Then it’s likely the other possibility, isn’t it?”

“I’ll kill you!” Hua Qing Si let out a sharp shout and used her body’s Source Qi to launch an attack against Yang Kai.

She was quite wary of Yang Kai due to his former prowess, but he was now only a First-Order Dao Source Realm and she probably could deal with him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Kai had only stretched and clenched his hand, and the power of the Principles suddenly moved and stranded Hua Qing Si’s mid-air and she couldn’t break free no matter how hard she struggled. She was quite helpless and she could only cast a meaningful glance at the Embodiment.

A weird expression appeared on Yang Kai’s face and he cast a glance at the Embodiment, he said, “Didn’t you tell her that everything in this world is within my control?”

“Well, she didn’t ask.” The Embodiment laughed in response.

“Then why is she giving you a meaningful glance?”

“She’s probably asking me to charge forward with her.” The Embodiment wore an innocent look.

“Hey, why are you chatting so merrily?” Hua Qing Si turned pale with fright and she yelled at the Embodiment, “Big Stone, don’t you want to regain your freedom? This is your best chance, so why aren’t you making a move, yet?”

The Embodiment spread out his arms and said, “I can’t provide any help, I’m sorry, but you’re by yourself.”

Hua Qing Si was left without a choice and she could only size up her situation, then bite her rosy lips and look at Yang Kai pitifully with her watery eyes. She said softly, “Little Brother, I’ve made a mistake, please let me down.”

The Embodiment said in surprise, “Where did your integrity go?”

“If you shut up, none will take you for a mute,” Hua Qing Si looked at him angrily then said through gnashed teeth, “Traitor!’

An embarrassed look appeared on the Embodiment’s face.
