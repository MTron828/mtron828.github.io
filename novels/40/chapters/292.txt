This young woman was clearly irritated, like a tiny enraged tiger, and angrily declared, “That little brat Yang Kai lives here? When Senior Brother Fan returned to Purple Fern Valley, he immediately went into retreat, saying he needed to cultivate lest even a second-class Sect’s disciple beat him and no one has seen him since. It’s all that Yang Kai’s fault! This time, I’ll make sure to capture him and make him pay!”

This Senior Brother Fan she mentioned was the no doubt that Fan Hong who had previously come to High Heaven Pavilion.

Luo Xiao Man and Fan Hong were both Elite Disciples of Purity Fern Valley and had grown up together, sharing deep roots between them, so now that she had not been able to see her sweetheart for the past several months, she naturally resented Yang Kai very much.

Qiu Yi Meng could only smile wryly and softly say, “Sister Xiao Man please control yourself, our main purpose here is to inquire about the Demon Lord’s information, everything else is secondary. Don’t make things more complicated for us!”

However, Luo Xiao Man was clearly not convinced and pouted, “I don’t care! In any case, I have to bring this Yang Kai kid back to Purple Fern Valley so that Senior Brother Fan and he can have a fair fight, that way the knot in Senior Brother’s heart can be resolved.”

Declaring so, she quickly went up, shook Qiu Yi Meng’s arm, and whined profusely, “Elder Sister Qiu, isn’t he just some second-class Sect disciple? When you’re taking care of the big matters I can just secretly bring people to capture him, it won’t disturb your plans, I promise.”

Qiu Yi Meng sighed and helplessly nodded, “Fine, he is, after all, still a young disciple, to think High Heaven Pavilion is so underwhelming...”

“Hee hee, Elder Sister Qiu is the best.” Luo Xiao Man happily smiled.

At that moment, Bai Yun Feng, who was standing nearby, lightly coughed, still grinning as he reminded, “Junior Sister Luo, it is not that I wish to dampen your moral and raise others’ prestige, but that Yang Kai is not someone so easily dealt with. A year ago he was only a Separation and Reunion Boundary cultivator, but he could already defeat me, and I and Brother Fan’s strength are quite similar. Now that a year has passed, the extent to which he has grown is difficult to determine, even if you bring him back to Purple Fern Valley and allow him to fight Brother Fan, I’m afraid...”

“Hmph! How can my Senior Brother Fan lose to some nobody from this backwater place!?” Luo Xiao Man grunted unhappily, her eyes dodging slightly sideways, “Big deal... I can just injure him enough to let Senior Brother Fan beat him.”

As these few juniors were talking, one of the Immortal Ascension Boundary Ninth Stage masters suddenly frowned, “Young Lady, something is wrong with the situation; there are far too few people here!”

Qiu Yi Meng’s expression slightly changed, and she asked seriously, “What do you mean?”

This old man quickly released his Divine Sense and a moment later bitterly replied, “It looks like High Heaven Pavilion anticipated that a crisis would befall it and has already made preparations. There are five Immortal Ascension Boundary masters gathered together to resist us while further behind them a lot of people have gathered together, they should be High Heaven Pavilion’s core younger generation disciples, it looks like they are preparing to escape!”

“In your dreams!” Qiu Yi Meng coldly snorted before quickly ordering, “Some of you go capture those five Immortal Ascension Boundary masters. If they dare to resist, kill without mercy! The rest of you come with me!”

“Yes!”

Because Bai Yun Feng had before informed them about the existence of Ling Tai Xu and Meng Wu Ya, two Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, the Qiu Family had this time directly dispatched four Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters as well.

With these four people, the Qiu Family was confident it could deal with Ling Tai Xu and Meng Wu Ya.

This large group of people suddenly split into two forces and proceeded forward in an organized manner. The four Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, followed by seven or eight other Immortal Ascension experts, flew straight towards Ling Tai Xu’s group while the rest, led by Qiu Yi Meng, raced towards the Coiling Dragon Stream.

Inside the Coiling Dragon Stream, Yang Kai and Su Yan were enjoying a moment of tenderness when suddenly his face suddenly changed, and he stared off into the distance.

“What happened?” Su Yan immediately noticed Yang Kai’s change and quickly asked.

“Someone has come!” Yang Kai’s expression became heavy, and he quickly shouted, “Everyone move faster, they’ve already found us.”

Up top, there were still around twenty younger generation disciples who had not been brought down, so when they heard Yang Kai’s cry, the several remaining Martial Uncles quickly pushed their True Qi, which dramatically increased their speed.

These remaining juniors were one after the other tossed into the Void corridor and disappeared.

A moment later, all of them had been safely evacuated.

“Martial Nephew...” The few remaining Martial Uncles quickly flew towards Yang Kai’s side, while vigilantly gazing towards their approaching enemies.

“You all go first!” Yang Kai ordered, “I’ll hold them off!”

“En!” No one hesitated, and all of them dove into the void corridor.

“Where are you running!?” From the distance, an angry voice roared, the sound hardly faded before a beam of light shot towards them. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

They had arrived much faster than Yang Kai had imagined.

Yang Kai and Su Yan’s expressions both became serious. Together, they circulated their True Qi and released their own palm strikes towards the oncoming light.

With a muffled bang, the attacks collided, neutralizing each other, and soon after twenty or thirty figure appeared, which caused Yang Kai and Su Yan’s bodies to tremble slightly, retreat back a few tens of meters, and nearly fall down.

“That brat. Yang Kai... we meet again!” From within the crowd, the white robed Bai Yun Feng grimly cried.

Encountering his enemy once more, this time holding absolute superiority, naturally Bai Yun Feng would not give Yang Kai the slightest face.

“You are Yang Kai?” Luo Xiao Man looked him up and down disdainfully, “Is that it? I thought you’d have three heads and six arms, turns out you’re just an ordinary brat.”

Qiu Yi Meng grinned, also a bit of curious about this young kid, but when her sight landed on Su Yan, her eyes couldn’t help shrinking.

Qiu Yi Meng felt a lot of pressure from this icy young woman, like she was standing before an grand eternally snow-capped mountain.

A Master! And one who’s strength and cultivation were no less than hers! Qiu Yi Meng’s beautiful eyes flashed a trace of wonder, never imagining that she would see such a Heaven defying talent in this tiny remote High Heaven Pavilion.

On top of that, it wasn’t just this woman’s strength which was outstanding, even her beauty could only be described as country destroying, compared with her own looks, Qiu Yi Meng actually couldn’t help feeling a sense of inferiority.

Qiu Yi Meng involuntarily snorted coldly and quickly dispersed the faint jealousy she felt in her heart.

“You two, this time we have come to your Sect to ask you some questions, I hope you won’t make things difficult for us.” Qiu Yi Meng took a deep breath and said to Yang Kai and Su Yan, her eyes quietly glancing towards the dark void corridor nearby.

Even with her knowledge and status, she did not understand what this unusual thing was, provoking her curiosity as she tried to examine it.

Yang Kai smiled back disdainfully, “If young miss has simply come to ask some question why bring so much combat strength to my High Heaven Pavilion?”

He had long ago sensed Ling Tai Xu and the Elders engaging in battle and was clear that they were facing many Immortal Ascension Boundary masters so it was obvious they had no intention of settling things peacefully.

However, Qiu Yi Meng did not mind his arrogant tone and still faintly smiled, “If we do not show some strength, would you obediently lay down your pride and come with us? This is just another method of negotiating but I advise you not to resist or else I’m afraid you’ll have to suffer.”

Yang Kai’s face was gloomy. Opposite him were twenty or thirty people, and a number of them were Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, all of whom had locked their Divine Senses onto him and Su Yan.

As soon as they made the slightest movement, they would immediately be ruthlessly attacked!

The void corridor was several tens of meters away and still open, but it would not be long before it closed on its own.

[Can we escape?] Yang Kai thought to himself as he turned to see Su Yan. Her expression was perfectly calm like still water. Even in the face of twenty or thirty masters, she remained indifferent.

“Since it seems you two don’t wish to cooperate, I have no choice, seize them! We’ll question them later.” Qiu Yi Meng decisively issued an order. From the beginning till now, the light and carefree smile never once left her face.

“Yes!” Two of the Immortal Ascension Boundary experts stepped out from behind her and contemptuously sneered towards Yang Kai and Su Yan as they approached.

Yang Kai clenched Su Yan’s delicate hand and whispered, “You go first, don’t worry about me, they won’t dare really harm me.”

Su Yan hesitated for a moment before nodding gently. In this moment of crisis, she did not stubbornly insist on remaining by Yang Kai’s side like some naive woman because she was aware of Yang Kai’s true identity. This was his greatest protection, but if she stayed behind, it would only make the situation worse.

In that instant, the two of them had understood each other’s intent.

The two Immortal Ascension Boundary masters had already approached to within five meters.

But at that moment.

The Demonic Qi from the Coiled Dragon Stream suddenly surged and more than a dozen black as night dragons rushed up and struck the two Immortal Ascension Boundary masters.

This Demonic Qi contained a hidden unparalleled evil intent. The frontal impact of which did not deal much damage but instead attacked their Souls, which dazed them for a moment.

The two Immortal Ascension Boundary masters were obviously stunned as they showed pained expressions. Their eyes suddenly turned red as their reason began to crumble, like they were viscous beasts which had suddenly been freed after being imprisoned for hundreds of years, instantly rampaging about at everyone around them!

Yang Kai’s eyes shined, as he realized that Old Demon down below must have felt his unease and used this method to help him.

Unfortunately, this was the limit of what Old Demon could do.

“Go!” Yang Kai roared and quickly pulled Su Yan towards the void corridor.

This sudden change had sent the Qiu Family, Bai Family, and Purple Fern Valley people into a state of shock. All of them were greatly unsettled by the malicious intent radiating from the Demonic Qi dragons.

Before they could collect themselves, Yang Kai and Su Yan had broken through their blockade and were quickly approaching the unknown dark channel.

“Stop them!” Qiu Yi Meng yelled and immediately pursued them while launching a fierce attack.

“Where are you trying to run!” Luo Xiao Man also hurriedly gave chase. The whole reason she had joined this expedition was to capture Yang Kai and bring him back to Purple Fern Valley so Fan Hong could beat him. How could she tolerate Yang Kai escaping now?

As soon as these two women moved the others came back to their senses and also activated their movement skills.

In a flash, Yang Kai and Su Yan had dove into the void corridor, Su Yan in front, Yang Kai behind.

Inside this chaotic channel, Yang Kai quickly turned around and ferociously pushed his True Qi, bombarding the corridor walls.

He wanted to destroy the passage in order to ensure that the High Heaven Pavilion members could safely escape.

But Qiu Yi Meng and her forces also possessed incredible speed, so more than half of them had managed to enter the void corridor before Yang Kai could shatter it.

Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man who were in the lead, looked around at the chaotic space and couldn’t help but tremble.

The two women had no idea where this was, but since Yang Kai had dared to come in there shouldn’t have been any danger.

Determined, Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man also launched their own attacks towards Yang Kai.

Inside the Void corridor, as their respective True Qis swirled about and collided, a violent explosion occurred, instantly rupturing the already chaotic space.
