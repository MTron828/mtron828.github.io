With this thought, Xu Wei suddenly broke out into a cold sweat as his expression grew solemn as he stared at Yang Kai.

His instincts were telling him that dealing with Yang Kai was definitely not going to be simple or easy. That much was obvious from his performance in the medicine valley of the Severed World. How could a simple cultivator withstand an attack from Zi Long?

Now, this boy had easily diffused his full-powered attack...

Xu Wei used his Divine Sense to sweep Yang Kai and his complexion immediately changed as he called out in amazement, “You... you... you really broke through to the Origin King Realm!”

“What?” Zi Dong’s expression turned abruptly ashen as he stared at Yang Kai with cold eyes, seemingly trying to kill him with his glare.

[The Origin King Realm! This bastard is actually an Origin King now!?]

[He had broken through to the Origin King Realm one step earlier than me...]

[Earlier than Xue Yue or Gu Jian Xin!]

This boy had left behind the three young masters of the Star Field! Zi Dong’s dreams about one day surpassing Xue Yue and Gu Jian Xin and becoming the leader of the younger generation now seemed ridiculous.

The bastard in front of him had achieved the goal he had been fighting to achieve for so many years.

[Unforgivable!] In this world, no one deserved such honour and glory other than himself! Zi Dong felt suffocating anger in his chest that threatened to burn his soul down and in the next instant he roared grimly, “Xu Wei, what are you waiting for? Quickly kill him!”

With this shout, Xu Wei finally snapped out of his daze and said with a solemn expression, “Boy, you are the most talented and frightening young man this old master has ever met. If possible, this old master would have liked to become friends with you, but since the Young Master has issued orders, today you must die!”

“Enough nonsense,” Yang Kai glanced at him coldly and spat disdainfully.

Xu Wei coldly snorted, “You’ve just broken through to the Origin King Realm, but instead of consolidating your realm, you decided to run out to seek death. So be it, this old master will let you see what a real Origin King is!”

As soon as these words came out, Xu Wei expanded his Domain and covered Yang Kai in it.

Xu Wei smiled triumphantly as he approached step by step towards Yang Kai while faintly saying, “In this Domain, this old master can dominate everything, including your life!”

“You think only you possess Domain?” Yang Kai snorted as he stretched out his hand, “I have one too!”

An invisible force filled Yang Kai’s fingertips and with a snap, the surrounding space seemed to shatter.

When this sound rang out, Xu Wei seemed to take a devastating hit and his old face once again aged noticeably. His complexion going pale, Xu Wei called out in alarm, “How can this be? Your Domain... how is that possible!? How is it so solid!? How can it surpass this old master’s Domain, which has been refined over hundreds of years? You just broke through! It’s not possible!”

He yelled madly as if unwilling to believe what he was seeing.

“If time was all that it took to become strong, there’d be no difference between geniuses and average people in this world. Old Dog, just accept your fate,” Yang Kai waved his hand and his Domain spread out, directly blasting Xu Wei’s Domain into dust and instantly suppressing the other party.

“Secret Technique, Moon Blade!” Yang Kai waved his hand and a crescent moon shaped Space Blade shot out towards Xu Wei.

This was Yang Kai’s new Space Blade, which had been improved greatly after his Space Force was refined and enhanced. Although the shape was the same, in terms of power and stability, it was on a completely different level.

A dozen Moon Blades blocked Xu Wei’s escape routes, causing his eyes to shrink.

Xu Wei was nearly frightened to death and did not hesitate to bite his tongue and spit out a mouthful of Blood Essence while pushing his Saint Qi hard to escape.

Yang Kai smiled coldly as his figure flickered and the power of his Domain surged upwards.

Xu Wei instantly felt like a mountain was pressing down on him. Desperately pushing his Saint Qi, Xu Wei still tried his best to dodge the incoming Moon Blades, but just as he was trying to move, Yang Kai opened his mouth and let out a thunderous roar.

Secret Technique, Shocking Void Roar!

This was the Divine Ability that Yang Kai managed to comprehend after absorbing the ancient Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core. Although Yang Kai was not able to exert the full might of this Divine Ability, it was still effective enough to interfere with Xu Wei.

Sure enough, a roar rang in Xu Wei’s ears, one that seemed to be laced with Space Force, making it impossible for him to identify where it was coming from, and in that disoriented state, he was unable to dodge the approaching Moon Blades.

“No!” Xu Wei screamed.

His cry was stopped as the dozen Moon Blades passed through his body. Xu Wei’s figure collapsed in the next instant, his five viscera and six organs still beating as they split apart.

Looking at this scene quietly, Yang Kai raised his brow and nodded to himself, “Not bad!”

He was interested in testing out his new strength and comprehensions, so in his fight with Xu Wei, he had almost gone all out, using the various Secret Techniques he had newly completed over the past few months.

Whether it was Exile, Moon Blade, or Shocking Void Roar, all of them were recently developed by Yang Kai.

Using these three moves, a veteran Origin King like Xu Wei had been killed.

Space Secret Techniques were both powerful and difficult to guard against.

Not far away, Zi Dong stared in shock.

He never expected that Xu Wei would be destroyed by Yang Kai in just a few breaths. Wasn’t Xu Wei an Origin King? How could he have died so easily? Even if Yang Kai also broke through to the Origin King Realm, he should not have been able to achieve such an easy victory.

What happened?

[Xu Wei must have had too much of his vitality and essence drained by the Shattering Void Shuttle, causing him to be unable to display his real strength as an Origin King which allowed that bastard to win.]

Thinking so, Zi Dong calmed down and his complexion improved. he was comforted, as if as long as Yang Kai hadn’t become strong.

“You want to run? After entering my Domain, you think you can leave without my consent?” Yang Kai suddenly turned his gaze to a certain spot in the void somewhere and coldly snorted, sending out a stream of pure Spiritual Energy that soon collided with something and exploded.

At that seemingly empty location, a figure flickered slightly before appearing, a fearful expression on his face as he grit his teeth and stared at Yang Kai.

Kong Fa!

When Xu Wei attacked Yang Kai, Kong Fa had surreptitiously concealed himself and approached, obviously looking for a chance to snatch Yang Kai’s Space Ring.

Although Kong Fa was also an Origin King, he was not capable of confronting Gui Zu or Zi Long. He knew that he would need to be cunning if he wanted to obtain the Immortal Tree, and Xu Wei attacking Yang Kai was undoubtedly a good opportunity to try to fish in troubled waters.

However, how could he have known that Xu Wei, who he had known for many years and shared many adventures with, would be killed so easily?

When he saw Xu Wei’s death, Kong Fa felt cold sweat drip down his forehead and no longer dared to have any crooked thoughts as he quickly tried to retreat.

However, nothing could escape Yang Kai’s notice inside his Domain, so how could Kong Fa have gone unnoticed?

Kong Fa’s expression only became more shocked after he was struck by Yang Kai’s Divine Sense Attack.

Because he could feel just how tyrannical Yang Kai’s Divine Sense impact was. That was definitely not the Spiritual Energy of a cultivator who had just recently broken through to the Origin King Realm! It was comparable to an established Second or Third-Order Origin King!

Kong Fa’s brow twitched as simply standing inside Yang Kai’s Domain made him feel extremely uneasy. After remaining silent for a moment, he finally said quietly, “This little friend, this old master has no malicious intent towards you, so why not let this old master leave? This old master promises that he won’t interfere in this matter again.”

“No malicious intent?” Yang Kai sneered, “Then why were you trying to sneak closer to me?”

[Why ask something you already know the answer to you brat?] Kong Fa cursed in his heart, but could not come up with an appropriate answer, only able to form a wry smile, “Just now, this old master indeed had some improper thoughts, but after seeing little friend’s Heaven-Defying methods, this old master has understood that there is nothing for him here any longer. Since that is the case, why not...”

“Since you’ve come, don’t even think about leaving,” Yang Kai interrupted him without waiting for him to finish, a cold murderous intent flashing across his eyes. “Since you dared aim at me, you must pay the price. “

Kong Fa frowned as some faint anger appeared on his face, “This old master was willing to settle this peacefully, so why must little friend act so unreasonably?”

“Don’t try to act like a noble Senior now, it’s far too late!” Yang Kai’s expression turned stern, “Today, you must die!”

“Arrogant Junior!” Kong Fa was furious. He had taken the initiative to back down, but Yang Kai had refused to give him any face, a grave insult.

Although Yang Kai’s method of killing Xu Wei just a moment ago shocked him, Kong Fa could also tell that Xu Wei was not in good condition. If Xu Wei had been at his peak, Yang Kai should not have been able to so easily kill him.

But Kong Fa was an unscathed and genuine First-Order Origin King. This little brat who didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth had just broken through, yet he now claimed he would take his life, it was the height of arrogance.

“Arrogant? You can debate that with yourself in the underworld!” Yang Kai sneered, his thoughts flashing as he increased the power of his Domain again.

*Chi chi chi chi...*

In the surrounding space, a dense cloud of tiny Void Cracks began to appear and swim about like fish.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s aura suddenly exploded.

“Peak of the First-Order? Impossible!” Kong Fa screamed, almost biting his tongue in the process.

Yang Kai had not yet released his full aura, making it impossible for Kong Fa to determine his exact strength, but now feeling the strength of this aura, Kong Fa’s eyes bulged visibly.

How was this boy a newly broken through Origin King?

Clearly, he was at the peak of the First Order!

After an Origin King broke through, they couldn’t cultivate to the peak of a Minor Realm without at least a hundred years of effort, and even that would be the speed of a true genius. For ordinary cultivators, spending hundreds of years to reach such a level was not uncommon.

He and Xu Wei, after breaking through to the Origin King, had each spent a hundred years in retreat to just consolidate their realm before spending another three hundred or so years to reach the peak of the First-Order.

This brat had disappeared just a few months ago but now had a cultivation equal to his own.

Kong Fa suddenly felt that he had lived all his years in vain.
