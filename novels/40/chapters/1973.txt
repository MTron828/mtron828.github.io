Yang Kai underestimated the power of the animal-like Xu Qing mainly because he did not know anything about the Golden Hair Giant Ape.

If he knew that this Golden Hair Giant Ape, even in ancient times, was a species famous for its physical strength, he would not have acted so carelessly and been smashed into the ground as a result.

In ancient times, the Golden Hair Giant Ape could easily lift mountains...

Fortunately, Yang Kai’s skin was thick and his flesh was tough, so although he was a little embarrassed, he was not injured.

However, Xu Qing’s attack completely enraged him.

Using his Third-Order Origin King Domain infused with his comprehension of the Dao of Space, Yang Kai thoroughly suppressed Xu Qing and engulfed him in an ocean of tiny Void Cracks.

Yang Kai smiled grimly as he waved his hand and shot out a series of Moon Blades towards his target.

Xu Qing’s complexion changed drastically as although he could not determine what kind of power Yang Kai’s Moon Blades were composed of, just the solidification strength of his Domain was enough to threaten his life.

Disregarding the injury to his lower abdomen, Xu Qing roared to the Heavens as his golden hair stood on end, transforming into steel needle-like existences that pierced Yang Kai’s Domain and allowed him to break free of its pressure.

The sound of the air being cut rang out as Yang Kai’s Moon Blade’s slashed forward, erasing everything in their path but failing to hit their mark.

Yang Kai swiftly turned around and locked onto Xu Qing’s position where he saw that at some point a giant axe had appeared in his opponent’s arms and was now being chopped down towards him.

Yang Kai roared in anger as the five-coloured glow from his body shone even brighter. Using his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, his right arm was covered in a layer of dragon scales as he punched out towards the approaching axe.

The two forces impacted each other like two colliding mountains, causing the surrounding world to tremble.

“What!?”

Xu Qing’s complexion changed once more as he watched his artifact axe fly out while Yang Kai remained unharmed, his body only reeling back slightly before he once again charged forward.

Xu Qing’s blow just now, even if used against a fully prepared Third-Order Origin King, should have at least caused serious damage if it did not kill them directly, but Yang Kai clearly looked unscathed.

[Just how strong is his physical defence?]

Xu Qing’s anger was also stimulated by this sight, and instead of shrinking back, he charged towards Yang Kai as well.

The two quickly became entangled in a fierce battle, but from the very beginning, it was Xu Qing who was at a clear disadvantage. Yang Kai only became more and more ferocious during the fight, using various Secret Techniques that caused Xu Qing to complain constantly in his heart.

[How can this be? I’ve used my Golden Hair Giant Ape’s Beast Soul Symbiosis that allows me to surpass any Origin King cultivator. No one can compete with me... could it be his Source Qi...]

Xu Qing was both shocked and suspicious, and as such thoughts crossed his mind, fear or worry began to creep into his heart, keeping him from maintaining his composure.

Xu Qing was being comprehensively suppressed by Yang Kai in all respects, and new wounds were being added constantly to the ones he already suffered.

After just half a cup of tea’s time, Xu Qing found his defences on the verge of collapse and realized that he would die sooner or later if he continued to fight Yang Kai.

Realizing this, he began thinking of how to withdraw.

It was at that moment that the sound of something breaking through the air rang out from the horizon while at the same time a burst of loud laughter sounded, “The Heavens have blessed me today, I actually get to pick up a bargain here, hahahaha!”

As soon as his words fell, a flying ship suddenly blocked the sun overhead. On the deck of this flying ship was a lineup of eight cultivators, each with a heavy aura about them. Leading this group was an old man that was now transfixed by the Firebird imprisoned in the blue water sphere.

Yang Kai and Xu Qing both hurriedly withdrew from their battle when this third party suddenly appeared.

The next moment, Yang Kai arrived by Mo Xiao Qi’s side and frowned, raised his head to the sky while at the same time he spread out his Divine Sense to check the surrounding region.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s face turned ugly.

His brief scan had discovered countless cultivators hurriedly approaching here, obviously drawn by the loud cry the Firebird had let out earlier.

Worse, on the flying ship that arrived first, the old man leading them was clearly a Dao Source Realm master. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As soon as the old man’s voice fell, however, another figure flew over in a flash of light. When the light faded, a middle-aged man dressed in scholarly robes appeared and sneered, “Old Jiu, you’re quite fast.”

The old man heard this voice and turned a look of disgust towards the middle-aged man while saying coldly, “Chen Shi Qi, did you come here to join the fun too?”

The middle-aged man named Chen Shi Qi smiled when he heard these words and replied, “If Old Jiu can come here, why can this Chen not?”

“En, my Raging Fire Temple is also interested in joining the fun, I hope Old Jiu won’t refuse,” Another voice sounded as a tiger-shaped chariot appeared from a different direction, a burly man riding atop it.

This man was as big as a bear and his body gave off an obvious Fire Attribute aura. Even his hair and beard were a dark crimson coloured.

“Hmph!” Seeing this person from Raging Fire Temple arrive, Old Jiu and Chen Shi Qi could not help snorting, unpleasant looks filling both their faces as they showed extreme wariness towards this brawny man.

“Three Dao Source Realms!” Yang Kai frowned. Although he couldn’t tell exactly, he could vaguely estimate the strength of these three people. The man called Old Jiu and Chen Shi Qi who arrived first were probably First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators while the brawny man was a Second-Order.

So as soon as the brawny man appeared, Old Jiu and Chen Shi Qi stopped arguing and after a quick glance, moved slightly closer together, seemingly forming an alliance.

“Temple Master Luo appearing here in person is unexpected. Doesn’t Temple Master Luo need to assume command back in Raging Fire Temple? I heard that your Temple recently hasn’t been very peaceful,” Old Jiu said coldly.

The big man surnamed Luo chuckled lightly and said, “Old Jiu need not worry, those small disputes inside the Temple were easily resolved by this Luo.”

Hearing this, Old Jiu’s face sank as he knew that this ‘easy resolution’ probably involved the death of many people.

One should not be fooled by the carefree and light-hearted attitude Temple Master Luo gave off; in truth, he was a cruel man whom many within the vicinity of Maplewood City feared.

As these three masters talked, more and more cultivators gathered around, most in groups while those like Chen Shi Qi who were all alone were extremely rare.

This situation made the three Dao Source Realm experts quite dissatisfied, and they even considered expelling all these mixed fish, but none of them took the lead to do so because they were worried about stirring up public anger.

Yang Kai frowned slightly as he felt this matter was about to become a bit difficult.

While he was hesitating though, Temple Master Luo suddenly asked, “Old Jiu, you’re well learned. Do you recognize this Monster Beast?”

He had been staring at the Firebird wrapped in a water sphere but was unable to recognize its species, so he decided to ask.

Old Jiu frowned and said, “If this old master is not mistaken, this little thing seems to belong to the Phoenix bloodline.”

“Phoenix?”

“An Ancient Divine Spirit?”

Many cultivators heard this and revealed looks of surprise while also taking a few steps back in shock.

The title of Ancient Divine Spirit was too shocking. Even a common cultivator would feel terrified when they heard it. Even the ten Great Emperors would feel somewhat hesitant when facing an Ancient Divine Spirit; after all, such Monster Beasts were rulers descended from ancient times. A True Ancient Divine Spirit was powerful enough to destroy a world!

Yang Kai’s eyes also flashed when he heard these words. If that was the case, it would also explain why he felt a faint coercion from this Firebird.

While dragons had Dragon Pressure, phoenixes had Phoenix Pressure. If this Firebird really belonged to the Phoenix lineage, it would naturally give off an innate pressure that could deter any living creature.

Chen Shi Qi nodded to the side, “This Chen also agrees with Old Jiu’s view, but this Chen cannot see which family it specifically belongs to.”

Temple Master Luo chuckled, “I heard that there was a Divine Spirit called the Luan Feng in ancient times, one that had both Phoenix and Azure Luan bloodlines. This Luo is not talented, but he had seen some ancient records before regarding this creature and this little one has some similarities, but I am not certain.”

“Luan Feng?” Old Jiu frowned before he suddenly shouted at Xu Qing who was standing to the side, “Brat, answer me, what kind of power has this thing used?”

Xu Qing had already lifted his Beast Soul Symbiosis state and restored his original appearance, but his face was a little pale. Obviously, he had experienced a great deal of consumption in the previous battle. Hearing Old Jiu’s question at this moment, he did not dare conceal anything and quickly began narrating what had transpired before.

As they listened, everyone, including the three Dao Source Realm masters grew visibly more excited.

Because according to Xu Qing’s description, this Firebird may really be a Luan Feng.

That was a genuine Ancient Divine Spirit!

In other words, this little Firebird was an infant Divine Spirit!

If they could capture it and bring it back to their respective power, once it grew up, they would have a Divine Spirit as a helper, a privilege only the top ten Emperors might be able to enjoy.

Thinking so, many people’s breathing became short as this was an opportunity to reach the Heavens in a single bound.

Old Jiu, Chen Shi Qi, and Temple Master Luo looked at this little Firebird with undisguised greed.

“We need to leave!” Yang Kai saw how the situation was developing and realized that this was not a place he could remain any longer, so he hurriedly and quietly warned Mo Xiao Qi.

“Can I take my hands off now?” Mo Xiao Qi asked timidly.

“You’re still covering your eyes!?” Yang Kai was stunned and quickly moved her hands away from her eyes.

Regaining her sight, Mo Xiao Qi looked around for a moment and called out in shock, “So many people?”

“En, if we don’t leave now, we won’t be able to!” Yang Kai ground his teeth.

“But... my little Luan Feng!” Mo Xiao Qi bit her red lips and looked at the Firebird that was imprisoned by her artifact. Even though she was naïve, she knew that in front of everyone’s eyes it would be impossible to carry off this Firebird.

“You knew it was a Luan Feng?” Yang Kai looked at Mo Xiao Qi in amazement.

“En, I knew the first time I saw it,” Mo Xiao Qi spoke as if it was obvious.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment before he began cursing viciously to himself.

If he had known that it was a juvenile Luan Feng in Clear Jade Mountain, even if Mo Xiao Qi had given him ten times the benefits, he would never have come here.
