Chapter 1585, Half-Monster Race

“Enough. Xue Lian, since you are here in this Queen’s palace, you will have to abide by this Queen’s rules. Do you think you’re still in Blood Flood Dragon Territory? Before you came here, did Xue Jiao not teach you how you should conduct yourself?” Chi Yue scolded, “This Queen will forgive you this once, but if anything similar happens again, you know the consequences!”

Xue Lian’s face filled with a look of struggle but eventually he cupped his fists and said, “Xue Lian was disrespectful and hopes Senior Chi Yue will not take offence.”

“Mi Tian, ​​take him back with you to rest, there aren’t many days left before you Juniors have to set off. Make sure you watch him well, if he tries to stir up trouble again, this Queen will hold you responsible!” Chi Yue turned her gaze towards Mi Tian, who had been keeping his distance the whole time, and declared coldly.

“Yes!” Mi Tian replied obediently. No matter how arrogant or rampant he was, he knew he had to act cautiously in front of Chi Yue. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

None of the Monster Race’s Ten Great Tribal Lords could be provoked carelessly, let alone Chi Yue who ranked amongst the strongest.

He quickly flew over to Xue Lian, wanting to bring him away.

“Human, you’d best remember this. This matter isn’t settled!” Xue Lian looked at Yang Kai hatefully and left some threatening words before flying off.

Yang Kai simply sneered and watched these two fly off for a while before withdrawing the Golden Dragon into his body.

“You also go back,” Chi Yue casually waved to Yu Xiong and the others before turning her eyes back to Yang Kai and ordering, “As for you, come with this Queen!”

Saying so, she swiftly stretched out her hand towards Yang Kai and exerted a gentle force that instantly enveloped him.

Perceiving that Chi Yue had no malicious intent, Yang Kai did not try to resist and simply allowed her to do as she willed.

The next moment, the pair disappeared.

“Adoptive Mother!” Shan Qing Luo exclaimed.

“Rest assured, Little Sister. Adoptive Mother shouldn’t want to harm him. With Adoptive Mother’s great strength, if she really had ill intentions, he would not be able to resist,” Yu Xiong comforted

Shan Qing Luo hesitated for a moment before gritting her teeth and hurrying towards Chi Yue’s private palace.

Inside her chambers, Chi Yue and Yang Kai’s figures appeared.

Yang Kai looked around and found that the decor here was quite simple, but it had a noble aura to it despite its sparseness.

[This should be where Chi Yue lives.] He speculated.

After bringing Yang Kai here, Chi Yue stared straight at him, her phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, not showing any further movement.

Yang Kai was an island of calm, however, staring back at her without fear.

After a while, Chi Yue gently nodded and then spoke in a tone that made it impossible to tell if she was complimenting or ridiculing him, “Your courage is indeed not small, there likely isn’t a second human who dares to stare at this Queen. Do you really believe this Queen won’t act against you?”

“Probably not,” Yang Kai chuckled, “Senior doesn’t look like a person who bullies the weak.”

“If you really think so, then you greatly underestimate the value of your Divine Dragon Source!” Chi Yue took a deep breath and put on a solemn expression, “To tell you the truth, I am also quite interested in the Divine Dragon Source in your body, so much so that even now I am thinking about killing you and seizing it. With it, this Queen may be able to spy into greater depths of the Heavenly Way and break through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm. Do you have any idea how many years this Queen has waited for such an opportunity? I can barely resist such temptation!”

Yang Kai still didn’t show any fear after hearing this however, simply nodding lightly and saying, “If Senior says so, it means that you don’t want to kill me. En, may I know the reason?”

“Seems you’re not stupid!” Chi Yue snorted coldly before turning around and taking a seat, not trying to conceal her intentions at all as she explained, “There are three reasons. First, this Queen cannot guarantee that after killing you she can seize that Divine Dragon Source. Since it chose you, it means it has recognized you as well, and this Queen is not certain she can make it recognize her. Second, even if it does accept me, I still may not have an opportunity to break through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm.”

Yang Kai nodded in understanding, “And the third reason?”

“You are the one Qing Luo loves, if this Queen really killed you, I would lose Qing Luo. The gains do not outweigh the losses. Her future potential is far greater than this Queen’s!”

“Junior admires Senior’s straightforward and upright talk!” Yang Kai grinned.

“Cease your flattery, this Queen cares not for it,” Chi Yue’s expression remained solemn. “Although this Queen does not want to kill you, do you know how much trouble you’ve caused this time?”

Yang Kai frowned for a moment before thoughtfully asking, “Is Senior referring to Xue Lian?”

“What trouble is he?” Chi Yue snorted, “The trouble this Queen refers to is naturally the other Tribal Lords on Monster Emperor Star!”

Yang Kai was stunned briefly but soon understood what Chi Yue was implying.

“You still underestimate the attraction of your Divine Dragon Source to us. If a Human Origin King learned you possess a Divine Dragon Source, they may be surprised, even amazed, and possibly find a way to strangle you before you fully mature, but to us Monster Race cultivators, the Divine Dragon... the Divine Dragon is a supreme sovereign, an existence that the hundreds of millions of my Monster Race’s clansmen worship. Who wouldn’t want to have such a treasure for their own?” Chi Yue said gravely, “What do you think will happen once news of this leaks out to the other nine Tribal Lords? At that time, all of them will not hesitate to travel to this Red Moon Territory to target you! When that happens, do you think this Queen will speak to protect you or not? This Queen does not belittle her strength, but two fists cannot block four strikes. Do you now understand how much trouble you’ve caused for this Queen?”

“En...” Yang Kai was surprised, “Junior never thought about this, but Senior, is this time’s matter really Junior’s fault? In the end, doesn’t Senior carry some responsibility for allowing things to reach this point?”

The time he was fighting Xue Lian was not short, and Yang Kai was certain Chi Yue had noticed it; however, since she had not moved, she had obviously tacitly consented to it. There was even a chance she was the one who had secretly arranged for this fight to happen.

Chi Yue glared at Yang Kai ferociously, naturally refusing to admit she played any part in this.

“To put it bluntly, this Queen has nothing to do with you, any trouble you caused, you’ll have to solve yourself. This Queen won’t interfere,” Chi Yue declared, almost as if she were trying to sweep Yang Kai out completely.

“Heh heh, Junior had no intention to ask Senior for shelter,” Yang Kai touched his nose, “If they want the Divine Dragon Source in my body, they must have the ability to take it!”

Chi Yue frowned and looked at him blankly, taking quite some time to recover from her shock before sneering, “Just how rampant are you? Even not putting the Tribal Lords of my Monster Race into your eyes. This Queen always knew that humans were arrogant, but never has she encountered one as wild as you.”

“Those who have the ability can act however they please!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly, “Though it may displease Senior to hear this, even if you wanted to kill this Junior, you may not be able to succeed.”

Chi Yue narrowed her phoenix eyes and questioned in an icy tone, “Are you provoking this Queen?”

Yang Kai just shook his head slowly, “Junior has no such intentions, he is simply speaking the truth.”

Chi Yue stared at him seriously, as if wanting to see if he was trying to act mysterious while in reality was bluffing, but all she could see was the steadfast expression on Yang Kai’s face that showed no sign of guilt from telling a lie. She really did not know where Yang Kai got his confidence from.

She was a Second-Order Origin King while he was a mere Second-Order Origin Realm brat. There was a gap of an entire Great Realm between them, so even if his performance in his battle with Xue Lian was impressive, Chi Yue was confident it would only take her one strike to kill him.

Having lived for so many years, she had never met such a wild and aggressive boy like Yang Kai!

However, it was undeniable that although this brat was a little arrogant, he had his own unique charm. No wonder Qing Luo had fallen inextricably in love with him.

“You still have a trump card to use!” Chi Yue’s pretty face finally showed a hint of surprise.

She thought that Yang Kai had been going all out in his fight against Xue Lian, but after hearing him just now, she realized that Yang Kai had still been holding back!

Xue Lian’s defeat was not undeserved! Compared to this human boy, all the rising stars of the Monster Race like Mi Tian and Xue Lian were simply mediocre...

“Indeed!” Yang Kai readily admitted.

Chi Yue sighed softly, looking at Yang Kai as if seeing a true monster. After a long time, she waved her hand languidly, “Forget it, it’s useless to investigate these things now! Right now, you can be considered a member of the Half-Monster Race, and as your elder, this Queen will naturally not embarrass you too much. Good, I will not try to prevent or interfere in the relationship between you and Qing Luo anymore, we can just... let nature take its course.”

“Since when did I become a member of the Half-Monster Race?” Yang Kai yelled with a blank face. Chi Yue’s comment had made him very unhappy.

He was clearly one hundred percent human, guaranteed exchange if not genuine!

“Huh! Do you think that’s an insult to you?” Chi Yue looked at Yang Kai coldly, “This is an opportunity that others cannot even dream of possessing! Boy, you should be doing your best to show a look of satisfaction!”

“An opportunity...” Yang Kai’s brow twitched, hesitating for a moment before asking, “Is Senior referring to that so-called Divine Dragon Source?”

“Indeed! Your current situation is somewhat similar to Qing Luo’s. As a human, you have inherited the Source of a powerful Monster Race, so you can now be considered a Half-Monster!” Chi Yue nodded.

“Regarding this Divine Dragon Source matter, can Senior explain about it to Junior?” Yang Kai asked.

“What do you want to know?” Chi Yue asked back.

“Junior would like to know everything about it...” Yang Kai looked at Chi Yue with a mischievous smile.

Chi Yue frowned, but didn’t get angry, instead deciding to explain patiently, “You should have heard the term ‘Ancient Divine Spirit’ already, yes? In ancient times, Ancient Divine Spirits were powerful creatures that were born at the dawn of the Heavens and Earth. They were the predecessors of my Monster Race and the strongest of existences! My Monster Race nowadays has tens of millions of races that were derived from the blood of these Ancient Divine Spirit, but most have only inherited faint traces of those bloodlines, so they are relatively small and weak. Others, however, have inherited stronger bloodlines which make them more formidable. En, that Xue Lian who you fought carries the bloodline of the Blood Flood Dragon, a descendant of the True Dragons. His bloodline is also quite strong, which is why he was instantly suppressed when the Divine Dragon Source in your body revealed itself, and why that Divine Dragon Source was so interested in Xue Lian’s Monster Core. If it had been allowed to swallow Xue Lian’s Monster Core, it would be able to strengthen itself.”

Yang Kai listened carefully, nodding his head from time to time. This was information straight from the Monster Race’s Red Moon Tribal Lord so undoubtedly it carried great authority.
