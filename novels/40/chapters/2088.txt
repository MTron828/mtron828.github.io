After their close brush with death, the Qin Family guards had turned pale with fright and shock.

Walking over from the side, Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense around the bodies of those people. Only after making sure that they did not show signs of being invaded by Demon Qi did he calm his heart.

However, looking around him, a large hole several dozen metres wide had appeared over where the hidden chamber used to be. Clearly, this was the result of Jiang Chu He’s self-destruction.

“Many thanks for saving our lives, Sir,” After pulling themselves together, all of the guards cupped their hands towards Yang Kai in gratitude.

Waving his hands, Yang Kai did not say anything back to them. Instead, he turned towards Qin Yu. “Sister Qin, follow me to see City Lord Duan. We need to tell him about what we’ve discovered.”

Qin Yu nodded her head silently.

Extending his hand, Yang Kai pulled her to his side, before flying out of the residence.

Although the Secret Technique Qin Yu displayed had allowed Yang Kai’s Divine Sense to be grafted onto her, letting him observe quite a bit from Qin Yu’s perspective, he wasn’t able to gather more details than her. Therefore, it was still better for Qin Yu to brief Duan Yuan Shan personally.

On the way, Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense into his communication artifact and confirmed Duan Yuan Shan’s current location.

It didn’t take long before the two noticed the City Lord of Maplewood City on the city walls.

“Thank you for your efforts, Brother Yang!” Duan Yuan Shan had a stressed look on his face. After seeing Yang Kai and Qin Yu approaching, he cupped his hands towards Yang Kai, before turning his gaze towards Qin Yu, “I’ve heard from Brother Yang that you’ve discovered something?”

Qin Yu nodded her head and replied, “That’s right, City Lord. Thanks to Senior Yang capturing a live Demon, Yu’er was able to do a Soul Search and I’ve indeed discovered something.”

Duan Yuan Shan’s eyes lit up. “Speak!”

Qin Yu immediately explained everything she had managed to uncover when she was in Jiang Chu He’s Knowledge Sea.

After she was done, Duan Yuan Shan’s face turned somewhat pale as he exclaimed in shock, “So according to what you said, that mine’s actually where the remnants of the Ancient Great Demon were buried?”

Qin Yu shook her head. “I’m also not sure about that, as the scenes that appeared within Jiang Chu He’s Knowledge Sea were not linked up, so we don’t know exactly what was sealed ten thousand feet beneath the surface. However, from what we can see of the current situation, it’s extremely likely that it is indeed the remnants of that demon’s corpse!”

If it was the remnants of the demon corpse, it would naturally be able to produce that much Ancient Demon Qi.

However, if even those great powerhouses from ancient times were unable to completely eradicate the demon corpse, with the cultivation standard of Maplewood City’s cultivators, what could they do about it?

With the seal having been broken, if the demon corpse remnants weren’t moved away, Maplewood City would turn into a living purgatory. However, who could actually carry that out? Furthermore, who would dare to touch them? The Ten Great Emperors were the only ones who could achieve that.

Considering all of these, a wave of terror shook through Duan Yuan Shan’s heart. Looking towards Yang Kai, he said, “What are your thoughts on this, Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai shook his head. “I didn’t see anything else!”

What he meant was that Qin Yu had already described everything that he had seen.

“City Lord Sir...” All of a sudden, Qin Yu shouted out. “Perhaps, I might have a way that could slightly alleviate the current situation.”

“Oh?” Hearing her words, Duan Yuan Shan hastily turned to look at Qin Yu. “What way?”

Although Qin Yu only had a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivation realm, being the Maplewood City City Lord, as well as the strongest person of this city, Duan Yuan Shan had some knowledge regarding the details of Qin Yu’s strength. He knew that he could not discount this little girl. If not for her congenital weakness, she would definitely become an extraordinary figure.

If she said that she had a way, it might just work.

“Add another seal below! Before this, I made a detailed investigation. Although that seal has grown weaker after countless years, it isn’t completely useless. A corner of the seal has just suffered some damage due to the Jiang Family’s wanton mining. As long as we can repair the damage, we can stop the Demon Qi from seeping out. When that happens, the demonic creatures and Demon Qi on the outside would be left stranded with nowhere to go. Water without a source will always be eliminated one day.”

“You can repair it?” Duan Yuan Shan asked doubtfully.

Qin Yu hesitated for a moment, but she still replied: “I can give it a try!” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“How confident are you?”

“Sixty percent!”

Duan Yuan Shan fell silent, seemingly unsure of how to proceed.

“City Lord Sir, although I don’t have full confidence in repairing that seal, the damage that it has will only become worse if we leave it as it is. I’m afraid that it wouldn’t take long for even more Demon Qi to seep out. At that time, there will be absolutely no way for Maplewood City to maintain its defence. Therefore, we need to repair that seal no matter what!” Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes glimmered as she stared at Duan Yuan Shan, a change from her usual delicate image.

“From what you’ve said, this matter absolutely needs to be done?” Duan Yuan Shan asked solemnly.

Qin Yu nodded her head.

Giving a long sigh, Duan Yuan Shan continued, “Even if that’s the case, how will we be able to get to the location of the seal safely? How can we defend against the countless demonic creatures and the corrosion of the Demon Qi? Although this city lord has a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, I don’t have the confidence to last that long in the Demon Qi. What if...”

Yang Kai nodded his head, before adding on, “The Demon Qi has extremely strong corrosive properties. Most Dao Source Realm masters can’t endure more than half an hour against it. With City Lord Sir’s strength, an hour will be the limit!”

Having fought outside of the city, he had a deep impression after a head-on confrontation with the Demon Qi. Therefore, his words on this matter were highly credible.

“Furthermore, you need to be there for the repair of the Spirit Array. With your cultivation, heading into the Demon Qi...” Yang Kai tilted his head as he looked at Qin Yu, unable to finish his sentence.

Nevertheless, his meaning was clear.

With her Second-Order Origin Realm cultivation, just making contact with the Demon Qi would cause her to become a Demon.

Yet, Qin Yu replied with a smile. “Since I’m the one that proposed this idea, I naturally have a way to deal with that.”

“What way?” Both Yang Kai and Duan Yuan looked at her with doubt.

“By relying on a Spirit Array!” Qin Yu gave a faint smile. “Although I definitely can’t move about myself, if I rely on the strength of the Spirit Array and connect the strengths of a number of Dao Source Realm masters, I might be able to travel as I please among the Demon Qi!”

“Really?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

Duan Yuan Shan looked pensively at Qin Yu, before chuckling and saying. “You shouldn’t keep people in suspense, great niece. Tell your Uncle Duan about how great that Spirit Array is. If it’s really possible, Uncle Duan will definitely reward you for your contributions!”

“Uncle Duan...” A sullen look appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he looked at Duan Yuan Shan.

He suddenly realized that this City Lord Duan was an exceedingly shameless person! In accordance with his generational status, he was on the same level as Qin Zhao Yang. Qin Zhao Yang was Qin Yu’s grandfather, so Duan Yuan Shan would naturally be a figure in the same generation as her grandfather.

Him calling himself Uncle Duan and her as niece was a plain attempt to establish a relationship. If this actually happened, he might have to call Qin Zhao Yang uncle in the future. “I’m not sure if Uncle Duan has heard of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array?” Qin Yu asked with a faint smile, her beautiful eyes gleaming with elegance.

“The Seven Points Black Tortoise Array?” A frown appeared on Duan Yuan Shan’s face as he sunk into thought.

All of a sudden, his expression changed greatly as he exclaimed, “The Spirit Array that was the secret inheritance of one of the Eastern Territory’s Great Sects, The Black Tortoise Sect from twenty thousand years ago?”

An incredulous look appeared on his face, with his eyeballs almost popping out of their sockets. From the looks of his reaction, it seemed as though this Seven Points Black Tortoise Array was something extraordinary.

Yang Kai was brimming with curiosity as he continued to listen to their conversation. He could not help but to look towards Qin Yu, wanting to know the details.

Qin Yu clapped her hands in excitement. “Uncle Duan is indeed extremely knowledgeable. This Seven Points Black Tortoise Array is indeed the secret inheritance of one of the Eastern Territory’s Great Sects, The Black Tortoise Sect, from twenty thousand years ago.

Duan Yuan Shan quickly added, “According to rumours, the naming of the Black Tortoise Sect offended the Divine Spirit, the Black Tortoise. Enraged, the Black Tortoise raised endless waves that surged through the East Sea, battering against the Black Tortoise Sect headquarters. After the battle, the Black Tortoise Sect suffered innumerable losses and casualties, but an extraordinary genius from that sect comprehended a powerful Secret Technique from the might of the Black Tortoise and created a Spirit Array, which was named the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array! A hundred years later, the Black Tortoise came back and launched an attack, the Black Tortoise Sect relied on this exact Spirit array to counter it. After paying a substantial price, they managed to chase the Black Tortoise back and deal a serious blow to it!”

Duan Yuan Shan took a deep breath, before continuing with a look of fear on his face, “Although this matter occurred twenty thousand years ago, there aren’t many sects that were able to survive after being targeted by a Divine Spirit. Furthermore, with the great fame of the Black Tortoise Sect, it would be strange if this City Lord didn’t know about them.”

“Uncle Duan is really knowledgeable,” Qin Yu covered her mouth as she gave a delightful laugh, her smile appearing like a blossoming flower.

Duan Yuan Shan laughed bitterly in response. “No matter how much I know, I still won’t match up to you.”

As the two of them bantered, Yang Kai was dumbstruck as he looked from the side.

The Divine Spirit, the Black Tortoise! That was a first-class existence that rivalled the True Dragon and Heavenly Phoenix since ancient times! It was one of the strongest living creatures in the world. Apart from existences like a True Dragon or Heavenly Phoenix, who else would be able to rival it?

However, the Black Tortoise Sect had actually managed to rely on a Spirit Array to force the Black Tortoise to retreat. Just from that, one could see the might of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array.

Nevertheless, the Black Tortoise Sect was really unlucky, as they were targeted by a Divine Spirit just due to the name of their sect. No one could be blamed but the sect creator, for not putting much consideration into the naming of the sect, and actually daring to use the Black Tortoise’s name.

“So what happened to the Black Tortoise Sect?” Yang Kai asked in curiosity.

Duan Yuan Shan shot an odd look at Yang Kai and replied: “After being targeted by a Divine Spirit, how would they have any good ending at all? It was said that when the Divine Spirit, the Black Tortoise came to attack the sect for the third time, it brought along a group of offspring. Although the Black Tortoise Sect had its extraordinary Spirit Array, how would it be able to defend against a coordinated attack from a group of Divine Spirits? They were destroyed.”

“How disastrous!” Yang Kai exclaimed.

“Hmph! They have only themselves to blame for their outcome!” Duan Yuan Shan didn’t seem concerned, “After them, no other sect dared to use the names of Divine Spirits for the sect names anymore.” Turning to look at Qin Yu, he shot her a meaningful grin and said, “However, although the sect has been destroyed, it is said that several of its disciples managed to escape with their lives, carrying with them quite a few of the sect’s Secret Techniques with them, one of which being the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array!”

Hearing this, Qin Yu replied in annoyance. “Why do you need to say in such a roundabout manner, Uncle Duan? Our Qin Family’s ancestor was indeed a disciple from the Black Tortoise Sect, therefore, the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array was passed down from our ancestor. However, when our ancestor had learned it, it wasn’t a complete Spirit Array. When the Black Tortoise Sect was teaching its disciples this Spirit Array, they only taught each of them a part of it. It required seven people to combine their strength, with each person in charge of their portion of the array.”
