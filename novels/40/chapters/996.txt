Chapter 996, Best Of Luck To You

Seeing the middle-aged man’s nearly materialized murderous intent, Shen Tu couldn’t help his neck from shrinking somewhat but he still maintained his aloof grin and snickered, “We didn’t want to come back.”

No fool would return back to the cage they had just fled from if it wasn’t the only option available to them. Shen Tu would have already escaped this place together with Yang Kai with Wu Suo.

“Grandmaster, you can rest assured. With me here, no one will dare to hurt you,” The middle-aged man turned to Wu Suo and comforted down.

“If any of you tried to make a move, I’ll immediately kill him!” Yang Kai’s Saint Qi and Divine Sense were already locked onto Wu Suo as he stared around indifferently.

“Little brat, you dare!” The middle-aged man’s face changed again, a faint hesitation appearing in his expression, clearly worried about harming the innocent while punishing evil.

On the contrary, Wu Suo, who was the one actually clutched by Yang Kai, waved his hands and hurriedly said, “Gui Che, put aside your grievances. I finally persuaded these two to bring me to the power room so there’s no time to waste. What’s most important now is for us to leave here as quickly as possible.”

Hearing him say this, Lu Gui Chen’s expression also became dignified, “The outside fields seemed to have undergone some kind of change. Grandmaster, what exactly is happening?”

“The energy fields are going to erupt, hurry up and steer the Starship away from here!” Wu Suo shouted before turning to Yang Kai, “Boy, if you want to live, take me to the control array.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai nodded and followed his instructions, bringing Wu Suo to a corner of the power room.

Shen Tu followed, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings.

The Purple Star cultivators also began taking action under the command of Lu Gui Chen, starting up the Starship.

Over on Yang Kai’s side, he kept Wu Suo firmly under his control.

A Star Chart suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai, a giant, beautiful, three-dimensional representation of the Star Field shrunk down countless times.

This massive Star Chart was stored inside the Starship actually came from the same source as the Star Charts stored inside Star Shuttles, but it was far more comprehensive.

Wu Suo immediately immersed his consciousness into this giant Star Chart.

He was the Starship’s Chart Master and was responsible for setting the Starship’s course. He could find the safest and fastest escape route for the Starship in the shortest amount of time.

Shortly after, on the giant Star Field map, a bright line was drawn by Wu Suo, the beginning of which was where the Starship currently was, and the endpoint where the Starship needed to go.

If no accidents occurred, the Starship would follow this route and sail out of the Chaotic Abyss.

After completing all this, Wu Suo let out a long breath and nodded to Lu Gui Chen.

Lu Gui Chen nodded back and quickly ordered the Starship to set sail.

“Three Saint King Realm masters, the pressure sure is big,” Shen Tu stood next to Yang Kai and silently observed Purple Star’s lineup.

Inside the power room, in addition to Lu Gui Chen, there were another two Saint King masters as well as many Saints.

He and Yang Kai were like lost sheep in the middle of a pack of wolves, surrounded on all sides. The slightest carelessness would spell their doom. It was only thanks to Wu Suo’s great status that the Purple Star cultivators didn’t dare act rashly.

“Do you have any ingenious plan for after this?” Shen Tu glanced over at Yang Kai.

“Nope, just taking things one step at a time and waiting until we leave the Chaotic Abyss to think about it,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Shen Tu sighed faintly, only feeling that his luck was the worst. He had only been flying close to the Chaotic Abyss when he was suddenly caught by the crew of this Starship and now he actually had to pass through this life or death crisis.

“How did these two people come in?” On the other side, Lu Gui Chen gloomily asked.

Liu Shan, who was standing next to him, grinned and said, “The weaker one was brought back by Bi Ya.”

“Bi Ya?” Lu Gui Chen’s gaze crossed the crowd and accurately landed on an enchanting woman, his eyes flashing in the next instant as a cold flash of Spiritual Energy rushed out of his forehead.

Amongst the crowd, Bi Ya screamed miserably and held her head, experiencing an unimaginably painful sensation, causing her clothes to instantly become soaked in sweat, exposing her exquisite curves for all to see.

Unfortunately, none of the Purple Star cultivators were able to appreciate this beautiful picture as they were all too anxious, none of them daring to even breathe heavily because they knew how terrifying Lu Gui Chen was when he was angry.

“I’ll spare your life for now, but once this crisis is averted, I’ll settle accounts with you!” Lu Gui Chen coldly snorted.

Bi Ya was filled with fear as her tender body shivered, quickly bowing her head, “Many thanks for Senior’s mercy, this subordinate will surely make reparations for this sin!”

Saying so, her beautiful eyes landed on Yang Kai, a burning hatred flashing across them!

She hadn’t expected that this seemingly insignificant young man would actually cause her so much trouble. If she had known this was going to happen, even if she had ten times the courage she wouldn’t have dared to bring Yang Kai back to Starship. She would have simply killed him back in the Chaotic Abyss.

She hated Yang Kai deeply and couldn’t wait to peel his skin and torture him brutally.

“Senior, the Saint Crystals don’t have enough energy,” Suddenly, one of the Purple Star cultivators reported.

Lu Gui Chen once again shot a cold glare towards Yang Kai and Shen Tu.

Shen Tu shrugged his shoulders indifferently, “That’s right, I shot that crystal cannon barrage, what are you staring at me for? If you have time to stare at me you might as well replace the Saint Crystals instead.”

The energy required to fire the crystal cannons was enormous, Ke Meng had used them twice before he perished and with Shen Tu firing them once more, it had nearly drained all the energy from the Saint Crystals inside the power room.

Now, if the Starship wanted to escape the Chaotic Abyss at full speed, the energy remaining in these Saint Crystals would obviously not be enough.

“It’s too late to replace them,” Lu Gui Chen took a deep breath and shouted, “All those above the Second Order Saint Realm are to provide power to the Starship.”

Many cultivators in the surrounding wore bitter and unwilling expression, but seeing the look in Lu Gui Chen’s eyes, they didn’t dare object, obediently sitting down in the place where Yang Kai and Shen Tu had formerly been imprisoned, grabbing the shackles and attaching them to themselves, allowing them to draw out their Saint Qi to supplement the energy of the Saint Crystals.

In an instant, sixty Saint Realm cultivators shivered, their hearts filling with remorse.

These cultivators continuously stuffed pills into their mouths while tightly gripping Saint Crystals in their hands to supplement their consumption.

Shen Tu grinned as he watched these Purple Star cultivators forced to bear the same pain and suffering they had subjected him to.

With sixty Saints now providing energy to it, the speed of the Starship increased dramatically.

However, in the next moment, a deafening humming sound rang out, and the Starship’s speed plummeted. Not only that, but some kind of massive, invisible force appeared and latched onto the Starship, making it impossible to move forward.

Under the influence of this invisible force, the Starship began to fly backwards at an increasing rate.

“It’s too late! It’s too late!” Wu Suo’s face went ashen as his body shook like a leaf in a storm, muttering unconsciously, “It’s all over.”

As soon as these words came out, the entire Starship seemed to lose control and began tumbling through the Starry Sky, knocking everyone off their feet and sending them smashing into the power room walls.

“Look outside!” Someone suddenly screamed.

Everyone turned their eyes to the window.

Yang Kai’s eyes shrank and a sense of terror he was unable to suppress spread from the depths of his heart.

Outside, the unimaginable energy lingering around the massive stars was erupting, sending out visible ripples of light that were rapidly spreading across the entire Chaotic Abyss. .

The energy fields centred on these massive stars were all bursting, creating a chaotic chain reaction of explosions.

At the very centre of Chaotic Abyss though, there was a massive black hole that seemed to be capable of swallowing everything around it.

The Saint King-class High-Rank Starship, with everyone still on board it, was actually being drawn towards this black hole which now seemed like the giant maw of a great ominous beast ready to swallow them whole.

In front of this horrifying display of force, whether it was the Transcendents, Saints, or even Saint Kings, all of them realized in this moment their own insignificance.

Before this black hole, no one could guarantee they could survive.

Lu Gui Chen shouted out and tried to direct the Purple Star cultivators to stabilize the Starship, but it was all to no avail.

“It turns out that this is the true danger of the Chaotic Abyss,” At the critical moment, Shen Tu suddenly said to Yang Kai, “No wonder no one knows about this. After witnessing it, is there any other option other than to wait for death?”

“Wait for death?” Yang Kai glanced over at him and coldly snorted, “I won’t sit here waiting to die.”

“Heh heh, you’re not the only one. Hey... Isn’t that Sword Union’s Starship?” Shen Tu pointed outside the window and shouted.

Yang Kai looked in the direction he pointed and was struck speechless.

Purple Star’s Starship was being sucked into the black hole, unable to resist, and it appeared that Sword Union’s Starship was not fairing any better. This Starship was flying erratically, seemingly completely out of control.

As the Sword Union Starship tumbled and rolled, the seemingly solid materials that made up its hull were being continuously being peeled off and sinking into the black hole.

Yang Kai estimated that the Starship he was on was experiencing a similar fate.

The two Starships had originally fled in different directions, but neither of them had succeeded in escaping and were now both being drawn back.

If things continued on the way they were, the two Starships would likely collide before they were swallowed up by the black hole.

Such a disaster would absolutely bring about total destruction.

“Brother, best of luck to you, I hope you can survive this calamity,” Shen Tu said with a dignified look before he immediately sat down cross-legged. In the next moment, lightning arcs surged around him, wrapping him up in a kind of cocoon.

He had clearly noticed that the situation was critical and was attempting to withstand the coming collision by putting up his strongest defensive stance.

Yang Kai didn’t bother with him and even cast aside Wu Suo who was supposed to be his safety charm.

At this moment, the Purple Star cultivators had no time to attend to anything else as they were all feeling the threat of death. In this chaotic scene, no one would care about him.

Yang Kai’s expression became dignified as he watched Sword Union Starship’s rapidly approach.

The distance between the two Starships was getting closer and closer, just as they were about to collide, Yang Kai fully pushed his Saint Qi.

Yang Kai summoned his Silver-Leaf Saint Grade High-Rank artifact and transformed it into a defensive light halo tightly wrapped around his body while simultaneously displaying his Nine Heavens Divine Skills to their fullest extent.

Grand Heavenly Shields appeared all around Yang Kai, covering him in layers of overlapping protection.
