Chapter 1669, You’re the One Who’s Going to Die

Although this round moon-shaped artifact was incredibly powerful, Wei Gu Chang’s frequent use of it was consuming his strength rapidly. During the battle, he was constantly stuffing pills into his mouth in an attempt to restore his Saint Qi, but it was far from sufficient.

The five Origin Returning Realm masters who were besieging him and Dong Xuan’er were acting quite cautiously, not going for a decisive blow but instead keeping their distance while focusing on consuming their physical strength and Saint Qi, seemingly intent on capturing them alive.

Not far away, a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master stood with his hands behind his back, watching Wei Gu Chang with cold eyes while occasionally shouting, “Martial Nephew Wei, don’t be stubborn, hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Mirror and Martial Uncle will give you a chance to live!”

“Ptui!” Wei Gu Chang spat. Although he was completely dishevelled, the look of contempt on his face was still clear, “Xie Chen, it is repulsive to think you once called yourself an Elder of Shadow Moon Hall. Not only are you a coward who covets life and fears death, stooping to colluding with those evil monsters to harm the Sect, but you’re even serving them like a whipped dog now, hahaha... if you want the Heavenly Moon Silver Mirror, come get it yourself!”

Wei Gu Chang was covered in blood, but that did not change his heroic character.

Xie Chen’s face went cold as his eyes filled with murderous intent.

Wei Gu Chang’s words undoubtedly hit his sore spot.

Taking a deep breath, however, he remained where he was and continued to call out, “Nephew Wei, you may be a rising star of the younger generation, but don’t you understand that wise birds choose the best roosts to live in? Today’s Shadowed Star has only one true ruler, the glory Shadow Moon Hall and all other big Sects once possessed is gone forever. Out of consideration for your youthful naivety, Martial Uncle will not make things difficult for you. If you hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Mirror, you may leave. You are free to refuse, but... You may not care if you die, but what about Xuan’er? She is still just a young flower; do you not feel the slightest guilt about dragging her to death here with you?”

Wei Gu Chang’s expression changed slightly when he heard these words. Still immersed in this fierce battle, he could not help turning his gaze towards Dong Xuan’er, the hot-blooded ruthlessness on his face instantly being replaced with a touch of tenderness.

Xie Chen was extremely cunning, only needing a few words to shake Wei Gu Chang’s momentum.

Noticing his Wei Gu Chang’s gaze, Dong Xuan’er grit her teeth and shouted, “Senior Brother, don’t listen to his nonsense! He is no longer our Martial Uncle. Xuan’er being able to live and die together with Senior Brother is her greatest wish! No matter what, we cannot hand the Heavenly Moon Silver Mirror over to them!”

“Xuan’er...” Wei Gu Chang murmured.

At that moment, Xie Chen’s eyes flashed, and he swiftly condensed his Saint Qi as he pointed his finger towards Wei Gu Chang.

A black light burst from Xie Chen’s fingertip the moment Wei Gu Chang’s guard dropped and delivered a blow to the latter’s chest.

Wei Gu Chang was knocked back, seemingly taking a serious hit, coughing up a mouthful of blood as his momentum quickly weakened, only managing to stabilize himself after tumbling a few dozen meters through the air.

“Senior Brother!” Dong Xuan’er called out pitifully, her voice filled with a hint of profound sadness and distress.

A vicious look flashed across Xie Chen’s face as he cackled loudly, “Brat, this is the price for daring to fight with this old master! Now, let us see how you refuse to die. Kill him for me!”

“Despicable!” Wei Gu Chang grit his teeth and yelled as he saw his enemies madly charge towards him, releasing many artifact attacks and Secret Techniques. At this moment, Wei Gu Chang’s Saint Qi was in chaos and the silver moon artifact above his head had grown dim, so he was unable to put up any kind of defence.

Death was beckoning to him.

Strangely, Wei Gu Chang’s expression softened at this moment as he cast a glance towards Dong Xuan’er, his eyes filled with guilt and distress.

Behind Dong Xuan’er, two other Origin Realm cultivators launched violent attacks towards her.

Dong Xuan’er simply smiled back at him, as if everything else in the world had faded from her view.

Before death, the two did not need words, just a simple glance was enough to convey their satisfaction. They had not been born in the same year, the same month, or the same day, but they could die together, never to be separated again

Wei Gu Chang reached out his hand towards Dong Xuan’er, a gesture Dong Xuan’er returned.

Their two palms met mid-air, and it was as if their hearts and minds merged into one.

Pulling each other into a tight embrace, the pair closed their eyes and waited for the inevitable to come.

Screams filled the air in the next instant as violent energy fluctuations erupted and the sound of bones breaking rang out; however, the death Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were expected never came...

Wei Gu Chang frowned and opened his eyes suspiciously only to see a familiar face not far away, smiling towards him.

Wei Gu Chang was instantly stunned as his eyes widened, unable to believe what he was seeing.

After rubbing his eyes vigorously to make sure he was not imagining things, Wei Gu Chang could not help crying out, “Brother Yang!”

The person standing next to him was none other than Yang Kai!

Wei Gu Chang’s heart jumped wildly.

Yang Kai had left Shadowed Star for a long voyage across the vast Star Field, something Wei Gu Chang was well aware of because he had heard Fei Zhi Tu mention it more than once, each time wearing a disgruntled and regretful expression.

If not for his cultivation having fallen that day, Fei Zhi Tu would have left Shadowed Star together with Yang Kai to experience the mysteries and excitement of the Star Field. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

But at that last moment, fate played a cruel prank on him and his cultivation fell.

In the end, only Qian Tong left with Yang Kai from Shadow Moon Hall.

Yang Kai had left seven or eight years ago and there had been no news from him since then. No one knew whether he had safely made it to the Star Field or not.

But today, at this critical moment, Yang Kai had magically appeared and saved their Senior Brother Junior Sister pair!

[Since Yang Kai is back, what about Elder Qian?] Wei Gu Chang hurriedly turned his head to look around, but apart from discovering two shockingly beautiful women, there were no signs of Elder Qian.

Wei Gu Chang’s heart sank.

“Elder Qian is fine. Brother Wei doesn’t need to worry,” Yang Kai knew what he was thinking when he saw his look and quickly comforted him, “It’s been many years since we last met, but Brother Wei... en, it seems you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

Hearing Yang Kai’s joking tone, Wei Gu Chang grinned, blood dripping from the corner of his lips, giving him a wild and fierce look as he snickered, “Is Brother Yang making fun of this Wei?”

“I wouldn’t dare!”

“Senior Brother... let me go first,” Dong Xuan’er’s shy whisper entered Wei Gu Chang’s ears.

Startled, only now did he remember that he was still embracing Dong Xuan’er tightly.

Feeling the soft and tender body in his embrace heat up sharply while exhaling an orchid scent beside his ear aroused a certain sense of euphoria in Wei Gu Chang that made him extremely reluctant to let go.

Although the Senior Brother and Junior Sister pair had been in love with each other for many years, they had never truly been intimate. Only when they were facing death a moment ago had they tossed away all sense of shyness and embarrassment and broken this final barrier between them.

Gently letting go of Dong Xuan’er, Wei Gu Chang scratched his head, “I’ve shown Brother Yang something embarrassing.”

Dong Xuan’er stood aside with a blushing smile, her head down, keeping silent.

Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang looked at each other and smiled knowingly.

“Brother Wei and Sister Dong being able to express their true feelings in the face of adversity is something quite touching. How could this Yang laugh at such a display?” Yang Kai said seriously before immediately turning his eyes forward and asking indifferently, “What happened here? I was only gone for a few years but it seems something big has happened to Shadow Moon Hall.”

Hearing this, Wei Gu Chang’s face grew cold as he recalled, “Not just Shadow Moon Hall, all of Shadowed Star has been turned upside down. I won’t be able to explain everything in short order, but to be succinct, this dog here was once a high-level Elder of my Shadow Moon Hall, but he betrayed the Sect and helped a terrible enemy commit all kinds of heinous sins, including killing the older Hall Master and imprisoning City Lord Fei!”

“The old Hall Master was killed, and City Lord Fei was imprisoned?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“Exactly!”

“Little beast, it’s you!” On the opposite side, Xie Chen looked at Yang Kai gloomily, hatred flashing across his eyes, as if he held some kind of absolutely irreconcilable resentment with him. Smiling wildly, Xie Chen shouted, “You’ll really wear out iron shoes while seeking your feet! This old master has been searching for you for so many years, but I never expected you would actually deliver yourself to me today! Magnificent! Today this old master will kill you and avenge my clansmen’s deaths!”

“Do you know me?” Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously.

Xie Chen growled, “Do you remember Xie Li and Xie Hong Wen who died at your hands nearly ten years ago?”

“Xie Li, Xie Hong Wen?” Yang Kai frowned but quickly recalled, “You mean that Xie Family Young Master who led people to attack me in the Flowing Flame Sand Field and his father who later tried to seek revenge for him?”

“Indeed!”

“Who are you to them?” Yang Kai asked, still not certain about the other party’s identity.

“Xie Li is my Elder Brother and Xie Hong Wen is my nephew! Today, this old master will finally have his revenge! Little beast, do you have any last words to say?” Xie Chen ground his teeth and roared, his eyes turning red, like a wild beast.

Yang Kai sneered, “Xie Hong Wen and Xie Li died because of their own stupid decisions, they have no one to blame but themselves.”

“To think you dare still make such an audacious argument, you murderer!? Fine. If that is how you think, you dying today is no one’s fault but your own!” Xie Chen cried out hysterically.

Yang Kai sneered and shook his head, “Old dog, that’s where you’re wrong, you’re the one who’s going to die today.”

Xie Chen laughed, “Yellow-mouthed brat, you think this old master will listen to your nonsense?”

“It doesn’t matter whether you listen or not. Forget it, since this is Shadow Moon Hall’s business, I will not intervene. Elder Qian can clean up his Sect himself,” Yang Kai didn’t bother with Xie Chen anymore and instead used his Divine Sense to communicate with Qian Tong inside the Sealed World Bead

“Elder Qian...” Wei Gu Chang heard this, and a happy expression flashed across his face as he looked around, “Where is Elder Qian?”

“Is my Master here?” Dong Xuan’er also wore a look of pleasant surprise.

“En,” Yang Kai grinned, waving his hand as he condensed a mysterious power, forming a whirlpool mid in front of him.

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er’s gazes were instantly drawn to this whirlpool and soon saw an elderly figure walk out from it.

Qian Tong!

“What is this!?” Xie Chen’s face changed slightly as he stared at the strange vortex, unable to figure out how Qian Tong came out from it. This vortex seemed to be connected to another world, but he was unable to draw any definitive conclusions about it.

Soon, however, Xie Chen’s gaze focused on Qian Tong, a look of dread spreading across his face.
