Chapter 955, Star Shuttle

The Starry Sky was filled with a terrifying pressure that, if one‚Äôs physique was not intrepid enough, they would die without a doubt. At the very least, one needed to be a Third Order Saint in order to resist the pressure of the Starry Sky.

This was a place of legend and very few had ever set foot there.

The legendary Great Demon God was even rumoured to have explored the vast Starry Sky, where he ultimately met his end.

Regardless of whether these rumours were true or not, it was certain that the Starry Sky was extremely dangerous.

If the masters from Ice Sect had thought this was just an ordinary Void Corridor entrance to Mysterious Small World and had rushed inside, the result was likely to be disastrous.

With the exception of Ice Sect‚Äôs Sect Master, Qing Ya, the others would have been unable to resist the Starry Sky‚Äôs pressure.

Yang Kai‚Äôs thoughts were in chaos as he stood stupidly in place for who knows how long, not knowing what to do next.

It wasn‚Äôt until he saw several broken bones out of the corner of his eye that he came back to his senses.

Yang Kai‚Äôs hands trembled as he reached out and drew these lightly drifting bones towards him, picking them up hesitantly and carefully examining them, only breathing a sigh of relief a moment later.

These bones should belong to a Bone Race cultivator that had rushed into the Starry Sky, and were unable to bear the huge pressure to end up crushed.

This, however, only reinforced Yang Kai‚Äôs previous guess.

The masters from Ice Sect should really have escaped through this Void Corridor and the Bone Race cultivators had chased after them, resulting in them being struck by the Starry Sky‚Äôs pressure and dying on the spot.

Looking carefully, Yang Kai discovered a great many broken bones scattered about; it seemed that several Bone Race cultivators had died here.

But if that was the case, what about the Ice Sect Elders and Su Yan?

There was no trace of their deaths here at all; it was as if they had magically vanished into the Starry Sky.

As his mood gradually stabilized, Yang Kai crushed the bones in his hand before using the Flying Heavens Shuttle to begin searching the vast Starry Sky for any clues he could find.

He did not let off any suspicious areas, his Divine Sense extended out as far as possible as he fantasized about suddenly finding a trace of Su Yan, or better yet finding her hiding safely under the protection of Qing Ya in some corner of the Starry Sky, just waiting for his arrival.

Unfortunately, he was destined to be disappointed.

Yang Kai searched a ten thousand kilometre radius around the Starry Sky entrance, combing over every last centimetre but failed to find any clues.

Time passed by, and after an unknown number of days, Yang Kai returned to the Void Corridor, turning his head back once to stare deeply into the Starry Sky‚Äôs depths before rushing inside.

As soon as he returned to Tong Xuan Realm, he flew directly to Water Spirit Temple!

In this world, if anyone knew the whereabouts of Ice Sect‚Äôs survivors, it would be the Bone Race masters. If they had any news about Su Yan, no matter the danger, he had to find out.

The largest island inside Water Spirit Temple‚Äôs territory was also the location of its headquarters, but since its destruction, this place had become occupied by the Bone Race.

At this moment, all the Bone Race cultivators had gathered here.

Every one of them now had a complete physique and were no longer a walking skeleton.

At first glance they appeared no different than the humans of this world, but their green glowing eyes made them easily identifiable.

Nearly two hundred Bone Race cultivators had gathered here, their green eyes flickering with an ominous light, causing the entire island‚Äôs atmosphere to feel and appear gloomy.

In contrast to this atmosphere, these Bone Race masters were in the midst of revelry, celebrating their recovery after thousands of years of slumber, each of them wearing an excited look.

Their cheers echoed across the surrounding sea.

They had all assembled in a giant circle at the centre of which was a huge pool of blood filled with broken pieces of meat and bone. Huge bubbles constantly emerged from this blood pool and burst open, sputtering out a rich blood fog that dyed the sky above it in a crimson hue.

Many pale bones and unknown herbs floated in this blood pool.

Bright flashes appeared from time to time at the bottom of the pool, forming a profound and complex array.

‚ÄúSenior Luo, it‚Äôs almost time,‚Äù A Bone Race cultivator walked up to the head middle-aged man and reported.

The middle-aged man nodded lightly, his face indifferent, standing up in the next instant.

The noisy Bone Race cultivators all fell silent as they turned their gazes towards him.

Ke Luo swept his eyes over the crowd for a moment before speaking, ‚ÄúA few thousand years ago, my clan inadvertently arrived in this world, thinking it was a good opportunity to open up new territory, but we never expected to be set upon by a great expert. My clan was defeated, our masters all died in battle while the rest of us could only escape to the remote glaciers of this world to slumber away the centuries. But now, we have awoken! That powerhouse who killed our clan‚Äôs masters has already died, so now there is no one in this world who can resist us!‚Äù

The Bone Race masters all cheered in excitement, their voices resounding louder and than ever before.

Ke Luo lifted his hand to silence the crowd before continuing, ‚ÄúTonight, new clansmen will be born. Each of us must contribute our strength to help them rise!‚Äù

All the Bone Race masters nodded.

In the next moment, all of them began to act, and the vital essence which formed each Bone Race‚Äôs physique welled up and poured into the blood pool.

The blood pool instantly being to churn, as if it was boiling up, the flesh, blood, bones, and herbs floating within swirling about violently.

Along with what sounded like a burst of cries and howls, many fuzzy faces appeared inside the blood pool. These faces were like ghosts that were trapped within the blood pool, none of them able to escape from its depths.

All the Bone Race masters stared at the blood pool with excitement and expectation.

Suddenly, the bones inside the pond sank down and with a crackling sound and began to fuse together, undergoing earth-shaking changes.

With a great splash, a complete skeleton stood up from the blood pond, its pitch black eye sockets soon filling with a green fiery light.

However, compared to the rest of the Bone Race masters nearby, this skeleton‚Äôs green eyes were very dim, like candles blowing in the wind that could be extinguished at any time.

This skeleton appeared somewhat dazed, as if he didn‚Äôt understand his own situation.

However, following his instincts, he began absorbing the vital essence contained within the blood pool.

At a rate visible to the naked eye, this feeble skeleton gradually became covered in a layer of flesh, and a moment later, skin also appeared.

It now looked like a shrivelled up old man.

More skeletons began to emerge from the blood pool and soon at least a hundred of them had appeared. As these new skeletons emerged, the blood inside the pool also rapidly reduced, and within half an hour, everything had dried up.

At the bottom of the now drained pool, there were some remnant herbs and bones which seemed to be useless scraps.

Ke Luo nodded lightly, a look of satisfaction appearing on his face, but just as he was about to issue some orders, an indifferent voice suddenly echoed from the night sky, ‚ÄúSo this is how you‚Äôre born!‚Äù

Ke Luo‚Äôs eyes flashed as he turned them towards the sky.

He was only able to catch a glimpse of a golden light rapidly descending towards him, carrying with it a huge destructive force.

His face changed dramatically and Ke Luo quickly pushed the power in his body, trying to block this golden light attack, but he was a step too late.

With a loud bang, the newly born Bone Race clansmen who were still standing in the remnants of the blood pool were struck. Unable to withstand this blow, their bones were shattered and blew apart, not a single one of them surviving.

Bone Race clansmen born this way were clearly extremely fragile when they first step into this world.

‚ÄúWho goes there!‚Äù Ke Luo‚Äôs expression warped as he called out angrily.

Wrapped in a cold aura, Yang Kai stood mid-air over the heads of the gathered Bone Race masters and looked down at Ke Luo fearlessly.

He also felt that among the Bone Race gathered here, this person was the strongest and possessed the highest status. UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If he wanted to know something, this was the best person to ask.

All the Bone Race masters‚Äô visions landed on Yang Kai, their Divine Senses locking onto him, their expression gloomy.

Among the crowd, one of the Bone Race masters stared at Yang Kai for a moment before he exclaimed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you!‚Äù

‚ÄúSir, he is the one who owns that Star Shuttle!‚Äù He quickly reported to Ke Luo.

Hearing this, Ke Luo‚Äôs expression brightened as he let out a laugh, ‚ÄúNo wonder you show no fear despite having such pitiful strength, you think you can rely on your Star Shuttle to escape. Unfortunately for you, you‚Äôve miscalculated. That Star Shuttle of yours is useless in front of me.‚Äù

As he spoke, the surrounding world seemed to stagnate, as if an invisible barrier had been erected with Yang Kai firmly placed in the middle of it.

Yang Kai‚Äôs brow wrinkled as he carefully probed his surroundings, but upon not sensing anything out of the ordinary, he became even more alert.

‚ÄúHuman, hand over your Star Shuttle and I can grant you the honour of joining my clan!‚Äù Ke Luo lifted his hand towards Yang Kai and said in a commanding tone.

‚ÄúStar Shuttle?‚Äù Yang Kai‚Äôs brow wrinkled, immediately thinking of something and taking out the Flying Heavens Shuttle, ‚ÄúDo you mean this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Ke Luo‚Äôs green eyes fixed on the Flying Heavens Shuttle, ‚ÄúGive it to me!‚Äù

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, ‚ÄúYou call it a Star Shuttle, do you know what this artifact is?‚Äù

Despise flashed across Ke Luo‚Äôs eyes as the other Bone Race clansmen also laughed at Yang Kai‚Äôs ignorance.

‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt know what a Star Shuttle is? In any Star Field, it‚Äôs one of the most common artifacts!‚Äù One of the Bone Race down below shouted.

‚ÄúStar Field?‚Äù Yang Kai raised his brow.

Ke Luo impatiently explained, ‚ÄúA Star Field is a Star Field! Your world is really too remote, you don‚Äôt even know about Star Fields and Star Shuttles.‚Äù

‚ÄúOther than travelling quickly, this artifact doesn‚Äôt have any other function, what do you want it for?‚Äù Yang Kai asked.

‚ÄúHmph, without a Star Shuttle, how could one traverse the Starry Sky? Each Star Field is so vast that anyone trying to cross it casually will lose their way and end up dying alone of old age!‚Äù

Yang Kai‚Äôs expression changed. Although the other party hadn‚Äôt said much, he had managed to glean from useful information.

This Star Shuttle seemed to originally be designed for use in the Starry Sky, which explained why it possessed such great speed.

But this was not the most critical piece of information the Bone Race master‚Äôs words had revealed.

Staring deeply at Ke Luo, Yang Kai asked solemnly, ‚ÄúYour race isn‚Äôt from Tong Xuan Realm?‚Äù

Ke Luo laughed, ‚ÄúWhen did I say we were?‚Äù
