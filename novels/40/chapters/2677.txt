Hot breath met her face, sending tingles all over Zhu Qing’s body, making her feel extremely uncomfortable. Looking up, Yang Kai’s eyes were flashing an obscene light as he stared at her with clear lust.

Blood drained from Zhu Qing’s beautiful face instantly, unaware that she was bewitched by Yang Kai’s Dragon Transformation Secret Technique.

Yang Kai would not have had such a visceral reaction being in this proximity to Zhu Qing if she was an average person, but she was different, her very existence would definitely trigger him to release the most primitive carnal desire hidden in his heart.

Such was the draconic nature!

Perhaps Yang Kai did not realize it himself, but it was an instinct he could not resist.

Yang Kai did feel odd though as he was clearly determined to teach Zhu Qing a harsh lesson, but the feel of her in his arms and the scent of her bodily fragrance dissipated the hostility in his heart inexplicably. On the contrary, another feeling was boiling violently within him.

It was a feeling he had suppressed for years and had not had a chance to release, a man’s basic instinct.

Looking up and down at Zhu Qing with a scrutinizing gaze, Yang Kai secretly admired her extremely alluring figure. Her peaks were round and voluptuous, undulating like great mountains, and the dip of the front of her dress was simply dizzying, tantalizing his throbbing libido, drawing his eyes in like a whirlpool, making him unable to extricate himself.

The lingering scent made Yang Kai feel agitated as his blood began to boil.

He breathed in this scent deeply with an extremely intoxicated expression, lowering his head slightly as his scorching gaze moved down to the exposed delicate white skin.

The claws that grabbed Zhu Qing’s fist and arm were no longer satisfied with just this little contact and he began to stroke and caress his prisoner lightly. The soft and tender hands were just a wonder to his touch.

Two clearly distinguishable streaks of steam puffed from his nostrils that collided with Zhu Qing’s neck, sending her into a daze.

“Impudence!” Zhu Qing reprimanded in a frail squeal, her beautiful face losing all colour as she shouted. A trivial Human dared to gaze upon her with such presumptuous eyes? It was simply unforgivable! He needed to be cut into ten thousand pieces for this sin alone! However, what made Zhu Qing even more shocked was that she too was being affected by his aura.

If it was someone else, not to mention a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, her emotions would not have fluctuated at all even if she was held like this. However, she felt a subtle reaction from her body when she was bathed in Yang Kai’s aura.

She was horrified and furious.

Just what was happening?

As she struggled, her strong and powerful calf was quickly lifted, sending a knee flying mercilessly towards Yang Kai’s crotch.

It was a failed attempt, however, as Yang Kai’s legs immediately clamped down on the approaching thigh, leaving Zhu Qing unable to slip out from the brute force of his grip.

Zhu Qing’s legs couldn’t be considered slender, but they still had astonishing proportions. The muscles on her legs were supple but also firm, their feel invoking even more lust and desire in Yang Kai.

With both arms restrained and one leg clamped tight, Zhu Qing looked as though she was clinging on to Yang Kai, their posture as ambiguous and amorous as could be.

Especially when Yang Kai was half-naked in his torn robes, increasing the intimacy of their embrace significantly. Although there was not any skin-to-skin contact, only a thin layer of fabric separated them.

Zhu Qing’s expression changed again as panic finally flooded her beautiful face.

Yang Kai took a deep breath of her scent again, completely indulging in it while at the same time struggling to maintain his rationality, frowning deeply as he interrogated, “What did you do to me?”

He instinctively thought that his unstable mood was the result of some technique Zhu Qing used. He really did not expect that this woman not only had astonishing brute strength, but was also proficient in Charm Techniques.

He had no idea what she did to affect his latent desires.

This was truly an odd situation. Yang Kai had come into contact with a number of women who cultivated Beguiling Techniques, and each of them was coquettish and charming, but as for Zhu Qing, she did not seem to have cultivated any such technique.

Unable to express her discomfort when she heard this, Zhu Qing could only grit her teeth and threaten him, “What could I have done to you? Let go of me now, or I’ll kill you!”

Yang Kai flexed his arms, pulling her tightly towards him. At that moment, the two bodies closed the short distance between them to enter a tight embrace, and a pair of astonishingly soft mounds pressed up against Yang Kai’s chest.

Yang Kai clearly felt the two swells pressing against his chest, causing the rampant desires in his heart to rapidly expand.

Blowing gently on Zhu Qing’s delicate earlobes, Yang Kai whispered, “Do you know what playing with fire is?”

Zhu Qing was in a strange daze, and his voice sent a shudder through her body. Although she could not see her own face now, she was sure her ears were definitely scarlet.

Sure enough, Yang Kai pulled his head back slightly, staring at her earlobe with interest for a while before grinning, “So sensitive?”

Anger boiled within Zhu Qing out of embarrassment. She suppressed the discomfort in her heart and coldly glared at Yang Kai who was right in front of her and threatened again, “Let me go, otherwise there won’t be a single place for you to hide in the entire Star Boundary! I mean it!”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold as he raised his hand, grabbed her hair, and yanked back abruptly.

Zhu Qing shrieked as her body bent back involuntarily, revealing an expression of pain.

“Do I look like I’m joking with you?” Yang Kai’s face was full of hostility, as if he had become another person, “You provoked me one-sidedly, and wanted to kill me, now you dare to threaten me after I’ve captured you? You’re not dull in the head are you?”

“You brought this on yourself…” Zhu Qing gritted her teeth and closed her beautiful eyes slowly. When she opened them again, she let out a sudden dragon roar that resounded through the sky. Yang Kai could clearly see a huge fiery red dragon phantom manifest behind Zhu Qing. Immediately afterwards, Zhu Qing’s tender body was filled with the majesty of a dragon, and her long black hair suddenly turned a flaming red. Not only that, two small, delicate dragon horns appeared on top of her head.

After this change, Zhu Qing’s aura suddenly became extremely dangerous.

Yang Kai was stunned, but he quickly curled his lips and challenged, “A Dragon Source? I have one too!”

No wonder Yang Kai felt a little strange when he first saw Zhu Qing. He did not realize it at that time, but looking back now, he did feel an inexplicable sense of intimacy with her. However, Yang Kai was distracted by Zhu Qing’s overbearing attitude causing that inexplicable intimacy to quickly be replaced by disgust.

Only now did he realize that this intimacy was not an illusion, but rather because the other party also had a Dragon Source.

This made sense. This insane woman looked young, with a petite and exquisite figure, but possessed extraordinary power. Obviously, this was because she had a Dragon Source.

As Yang Kai finished speaking, his body trembled.

A high-pitched dragon roar pierced the Heavens as a huge Golden Divine Dragon phantom suddenly soared upwards and hovered behind Yang Kai. The house-sized dragon eyes were full of endless majesty as it stared at the land before it.

“Ancestral Dragon…” Zhu Qing’s aura froze as she stared blankly at the Golden Divine Dragon behind Yang Kai, a complex mixture of shock, fright, and joy filling her beautiful eyes.

As the Golden Divine Dragon stared down at her, Zhu Qing’s tender body trembled with an inexplicable sense of humility.

The next moment, the Golden Divine Dragon phantom returned to Yang Kai’s body and disappeared.

“What did you say?” Yang Kai frowned as an absurd feeling that he could easily kill Zhu Qing in front of him filled him after he pushed his Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength. This feeling was preposterous, but it was also completely doubtless, causing Yang Kai to not hear Zhu Qing’s mutterings in between his confusion.

Yang Kai was slightly stunned, because Zhu Qing’s aura, which had greatly risen upon the activation of her Dragon Source, immediately returned to normal. Her long red hair turned black again, as if her power was suppressed by an inexplicable force. Even the two dragon horns on her head disappeared. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Both of her glistening pupils stared blankly at Yang Kai, reflecting an indescribable emotion.

The blood inside his body tumbled and his breathing became heavier and heavier as Yang Kai gradually became unable to resist the evil thoughts in his heart.

With her staring at him with those watery eyes, and the combination of the warmth of their embrace, Yang Kai’s rationality finally shattered.

He bound her tightly with increasing strength as if he was trying to squeeze Zhu Qing into his body. Zhu Qing could not help choking as she clung to Yang Kai involuntarily.

He leaned down to capture her red lips, kissing her wantonly and domineeringly.

“Mmm… mmm…” Zhu Qing struggled, her eyes bulging as the shame of being violated enveloped her, a feeling she had never felt before. She fought hard to resist, but she could not even summon thirty percent of her strength under the natural suppression.

“Still playing hard to get at this time!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, clearly sensing that Zhu Qing’s strength had decreased greatly from before, concluding that she was using some profound Beguiling Technique to seduce him, otherwise, why was he unable to suppress his own carnal desires as a First-Order Emperor Realm Master?

[Since you want to play with fire, then this Young Master will grant your wish! We’ll see who has the advantage when this is all over!]

The red lips of the woman in front of him were extremely hot, like living flames, giving Yang Kai an unimaginable joyful experience. In the short moment when Zhu Qing lost focus, he took advantage of an opening and forced his tongue into her mouth, capturing her little tongue, sucking on it greedily.

Unsatisfied, Yang Kai released her hands and took her waist from behind with one hand, moving it down to her round bottom, kneading it as he pleased. His other hand reached up and grasped hold of her other softness, massaging the peak he grasped vigorously.

Having her hands released from his restraint, Zhu Qing fought back, but she was unable to exert even a third of her full strength. She hammered Yang Kai repeatedlypowerful but still failed to stop his rampant violation. On the contrary, this action only aroused his fierceness and thirst.

Gradually, her resistance became weaker, and the natural instincts that were suppressed in her bones gradually surfaced. Zhu Qing circled her arms and embraced Yang Kai, her nails dragging across his bare back, leaving trails of blood as a strange moan leaked from her lips.

A crystal clear tear formed from both joy and pain silently rolled down from the corner of her eye across her cheek as the clash between her instincts and her rational mind left her at a complete loss.
