The milky white lights continued roaming around inside his Soul Avatar, numerous like the stars in the sky, and every few moments, his body would solidify a little, and the aura of vitality coming from it gradually became stronger.

At a certain moment, Tian Yan’s gradually solidifying body suddenly emitted a strong attractive force that shook the World Energy around Spirit Sword Peak, causing it to surge towards him, and was swallowed up in the blink of an eye.

An even stronger attractive force emerged soon after, causing the wind and clouds above Spirit Sword Peak to howl as the Word Energy from afar rapidly rushed in to fill the area; however, this was still not enough to satisfy Tian Yan’s needs.

His body that was formed by the Spirit Pill was just like a bottomless spit, and no matter how much World Energy came, he would devour all of it.

Discovering this, Wen Zi Shan immediately made a move. He used his mind to communicate with Azure Sun Temple’s Sect Defending Array and had it gather World Energy from around Azure Sun Temple towards Spirit Sword Peak. Yang Kai also summoned his own Jade Elder Token to control the World Energy coming into Spirit Sword peak, pouring it into Tian Yan’s body.

The two of them worked closely in tandem.

Following the influx of World Energy, the vitality in Tian Yan’s body grew stronger and stronger.

If there was any hint of instability in his vitality earlier, then it was now slowly being removed, and Tian Yan’s body was transforming into a real flesh body.

The omnipresent Heavenly Way seemed to have discovered something at this moment and a Heavenly Manifestation suddenly gathered above Spirit Sword Peak. Even though it was faint and hadn’t taken shape yet, Yang Kai and Wen Zi Shan were still startled.

World Force! Yang Kai could clearly sense a faint shred of World Force manifesting.

The World Principles of each world were different, and the only thing they had in common was World Force. In simple terms, this was the power of the World itself made manifest. Emperor Realm Masters comprehended World Principles to manifest their own Principle Strength while Great Emperors gained insight into World Force. This was the fundamental difference between the two of them.

Tian Yan’s existence was not allowed by the Star Boundary. The Divine Ability he used earlier was able to conceal him and help him avoid the Heavenly Way’s judgement initially, but as time passed, his deceptive methods gradually fell short, allowing the Heavenly Way to sense his existence.

Indeed, not much time was left. If Tian Yan could not mold his body before the might of the Heavenly Way revealed itself, then he would definitely be rejected from this world and be exiled to oblivion. When that time came, Yang Kai may not be able to save him even with the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus.

Yang Kai and Wen Zi Shan both looked grim. More and more quickly they pumped the World Energy around Azure Sun Temple into Tian Yan’s body. This was all they could do, the rest was up to Tian Yan’s own efforts.

Time gradually passed and the flow of World Energy in Azure Sun Temple did not pause for even a breath. The sound of wind and thunder constantly echoed above Spirit Sword Peak as Tian Yan’s body became more and more solid, and his vitality stronger and stronger.

Meanwhile, the Heavenly Way’s might that was gathering atop Spirit Sword Peak also grew stronger, just like a sharp blade hanging above everyone’s heads, ready to cut them down at any moment, putting everyone present on edge.

At one moment, Tian Yan suddenly opened his eyes and he formed several profound hand seals that seemed neither fast nor slow. The body which he had just shaped was like a vast ocean fed by a hundred rivers. It swallowed up the World Energy within several dozen kilometres in one gulp, and the milky white lights swimming around his body suddenly disappeared.

The sky was still moonlit, and it was not known when Spirit Sword Peak restored its peace, with the Heavenly Way’s judgement which had been gathering the whole time somehow disappearing without a trace.

Yang Kai’s eyes darted around, looking at Tian Yan at one moment, then at Wen Zi Shan the next before looking up at the sky, confused.

“Congratulations, Senior!” Wen Zi Shan suddenly spoke, smiling as he cupped his fists in Tian Yan’s direction.

Tian Yan also smiled, “This would not be possible without the assistance of two friends. This Old Master gives his sincerest thanks.”

Wen Zi Shan was cheerful, “This Wen only provided some small aid. It was thanks to Yang Kai’s Flesh Incarnation Pill that Senior was able to mould a flesh body.”

Yang Kai asked, “Does this mean Senior succeeded?”

He was able to hear a thing or two from their conversation. If it had not succeeded, then Tian Yan wouldn’t be so relaxed.

Tian Yan smiled, “It’s a success.”

“That’s wonderful!” Yang Kai was delighted. Only then did he release his Divine Sense to scan Tian Yan’s body, but when he did, he was dumbfounded.

Because at this moment, Tian Yan actually gave off an extreme feeling of weakness. Not the type of weakness like a lamp running out of oil, but rather a very natural type of weakness. Or rather, it should be described as… infantile.

Yang Kai did not feel any fluctuation of power from his body, like Tian Yan was just an ordinary mortal who had never cultivated before.

“Senior, you…” Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment.

Tian Yan smiled, “The Heavenly Way is not easy to deceive. Even if I can conceal it for a moment, there’s no way to conceal it for a lifetime. I can only comply with the Heavenly Way’s Will. At this moment, this Old Master should be equivalent to a newborn baby.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Kai’s jaw dropped. This situation seemed to be different from what he expected…

He originally thought that Tian Yan would still be a Great Emperor level Master after moulding his body, but who could have anticipated that the final result would be like this? However, upon thinking about it, it did make sense. How could such a good thing be realistic? Tian Yan was indeed a Great Emperor in the Divine Ascension World, but that was only with regards to his Soul. Since his body was moulded by the Flesh Incarnation Pill, it would be impossible for him to reach the level of Great Emperor no matter how much World Energy he devoured.

Considering all this, Yang Kai relaxed as he realized his thinking was too naive.

Wen Zi Shan commented from the side, “With Senior’s foundation, even if he has to cultivate from the very beginning, it probably will not take much time for him to return to his peak.”

“I hope so.” Tian Yan smiled, “But before that, this Old Master will need to spend some time in the temple.”

Wen Zi Shan laughed, “This Wen only hopes Senior does not mind the simplicity of his temple. Please, stay as long as you wish. Does Senior need me to arrange for another spiritual peak?”

“No need. Here is fine. Yang Boy does not seem like one to settle in one place, and this peak is clean and remote. It is a suitable place for me to rest and recuperate. Moreover… This is the place where this Old Master was conceived after all. Cultivating here will be just like a baby in a mother’s womb. It may require some adapting if I were to move to some other place now.”

“In that case, I will follow Senior’s wishes. I will send some disciples to bring over some cultivation supplies tomorrow. If there is anything else Senior needs, please let me know.”

“Then, please send some ancient books over. Any type is fine, the more the better.”

“Very well. This Wen will excuse himself for now.” Wen Zi Shan cupped his fists and looked at Yang Kai for a moment before leaving.

Tian Yan turned his head to look at Yang Kai and smiled, “You seem a little disappointed.”

Yang Kai laughed embarrassed, “I’m not really disappointed, it’s just a little different from my expectations. Ah, you should walk a little slower. Let me help you.” As he spoke, he moved over to help Tian Yan who was about to stand up.

Tian Yan was clearly not used to his flesh body and he stumbled as soon as he stood up. Fortunately, Yang Kai was just in range to help or he would have fallen.

Just as he said, he was like a newborn baby at this moment. He had to learn everything from scratch.

There was a palace on Spirit Sword Peak, and though it wasn’t very big, it was more than enough to house two people.

While chatting, Yang Kai and Tian Yan made their way towards the palace.

After just a few steps, Tian Yan suddenly paused. Yang Kai had no idea what he was doing, but when he looked over, Tian Yan looked blank and dull-eyed as if he had lost consciousness.

Yang Kai was shocked and was worried that something had happened and was about to investigate when Tian Yan’s eyes moved again, his consciousness returning to his body in a flash.

“The fusion of body and soul is not quite stable. My Soul left my body just now,” Tian Yan explained, shaking his head in frustration while walking more and more cautiously.

“It won’t stay this way, will it?” Yang Kai asked worriedly.

“Naturally not. It will be fine in a few days, but I’m afraid it will be difficult during this period.”

They paused three times along their way, and each time it was because Tian Yan’s Soul would accidentally disconnect with his body. Yang Kai had a hard time settling Tian Yan down into his room, and more and more he could feel that Tian Yan’s words were right.

[He really is just like a newborn baby!]

The next day, Wen Zi Shan sent someone to deliver a large number of jade slips that contained a variety of contents to Tian Yan’s room. Meanwhile, Tian Yan had not left since retreating into the room yesterday. Yang Kai did not disturb him either and just flew to the platform at the top of Spirit Sword Peak.

Forming seals with one hand, the Mountains and Rivers Bell flew up.

A dragon roar came out, and at the same time, Zhu Lie, who was trapped inside transformed into a two hundred-metre-long Great Dragon, opening his big red mouth and snapping towards Yang Kai.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai looked at him in contempt and used his Golden Divine Dragon Source to execute the Dragon Transformation Secret Art.

His body suddenly rose up, and a crackling sound came from all his bones. Short horns grew out from his forehead, and his skin was covered in armoured scales.

The Great Dragon who had just pounced in front of him let out an involuntary grunt, and his two hundred-metre-long body crumbled like a burst bubble. Pitifully, Zhu Lie transformed back into his human form and just happened to have flown right in front of Yang Kai where he was met with an iron fist, almost making it look as if he had taken the initiative to receive this punch.

Zhu Lie was knocked away with a loud bang and he crashed into the side of a mountain not far away, plunging several tens of metres into it.

He was dizzy for a while, but when his vision cleared up, Yang Kai was already standing in front of him. There was a strong suppressive force coming out from his forty-metre tall Half-Dragon Form that made him feel uncomfortable.

“Seems like your memory still hasn’t improved.” Yang Kai sneered and extended a dragon claw, picking Zhu Lie out of the rubble as if he were grabbing a baby chicken. Zhu Lie struggled with all his might, but to no avail.

This scene happened countless times in the past month or so. Each time that Yang Kai lifted the Mountains and Rivers Bell, Zhu Lie would try to sneak in a fierce attack, but without that special Dragon Scale, he simply could not resist Yang Kai after he used his Dragon Transformation Secret Art. Even though his real strength was a few levels higher than Yang Kai, he was still defeated without any ability to resist.

Practically every time, Zhu Lie would end up getting beaten soundly.
