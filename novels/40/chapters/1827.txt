Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai were both straightforward people that could not bear being so despised and humiliated by Yang Kai.

Plucking Flower Finger was a supreme Secret Technique that Lin Yu Hao had developed after many years. It was extremely powerful and could kill the target without drawing any blood, very much in line with his style.

In a flash, a flower made of World Energy shot out from his finger, while an invisible energy locked on to Yang Kai.

Yin Zheng Kai, on the other hand, stood aside; he had no intention of attacking with Lin Yu Hao, focusing all his attention on Yang Kai instead. He had a hunch that Lin Yu Hao’s ultimate technique would be useless against Yang Kai because this young man seemed very strong.

Be that as it may, he could gauge Yang Kai’s depth through Yang Kai’s reaction. So, Yi Zheng Kai was keeping an eye on him.

But in the next moment, a look of terror took over his face as he muttered to himself, “How is this possible?”

Yang Kai didn’t even move his body. All he did was gently blow and it directly dispersed Lin Yu Hao’s Plucking Flower Finger, the flowers scattering into petals before it could touch Yang Kai.

Lin Yu Hao was also dumbstruck. He glanced at Yi Zheng Kai as a chill ran down his spine.

The other party had broken his strongest Secret Technique just like that, evidence that Yang Kai’s cultivation had reached a level that the two couldn’t even fathom. Even if there was too big of a gap in their cultivation, such a thing was still impossible.

“What a superb Secret Technique.” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “Unfortunately, your cultivation is too low. It can’t play a big role.”

It sounded insulting, but rather than feeling insulted, a pondering look appeared on Lin Yu Hao’s face.

In cultivation, it didn’t matter who started cultivating first, what mattered was who had higher cultivation. Yang Kai might seem young, but he was naturally qualified to comment with his strength.

Having said this, Yang Kai’s face sank again. “You two have been hiding here, drinking tea and discussing the Dao without paying attention to the worldly affairs. It might look like you are free and unrestrained but are you really free to do as you like?”

Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai looked at each other. An embarrassed look appeared on their faces.

Yang Kai sneered and continued, “If you feel that you are free and at peace, then forget it, but I don’t think you are. If you want to escape from the world, then why care about the world? Why bring trouble to yourself for nothing? It’s really ridiculous. Either seclude yourself in the mountains and forests for your entire life or enter the world of mortals, enjoying all aspects of life. On the road of Martial Dao, your heart needs to be free and at ease. You need to keep forging ahead with firm determination. If you calculate your gain and losses, being overly cautious and indecisive, you will never achieve anything in your life!”

“Needs to be free and at ease!” Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai were hit with a shock. A pondering look immediately appeared on their faces. Their expression kept on changing; sometimes they looked confused, sometimes they looked excited. It seemed as if they were comprehending something.

Yang Kai glanced at them and chuckled. He then beckoned to the girl named Ling’er. “Miss, pour me another cup, and don’t be so angry.”

Ling’er nibbled her lips and hugged the teapot tightly while glaring at Yang Kai. It seemed as if she could guard it with her life.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose in embarrassment.

Right at this moment, Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai suddenly let out a long roar towards the sky. Their long roars immediately summoned the winds and clouds. In the blink of an eye, the Nine Heavens Holy Land was covered in lightning and thunder. It seemed as if a blanket of dark clouds had fallen from above.

“Oh!? It looks like they are about to advance!” Yang Kai looked at the sky. It was clearly the baptism of the world that a cultivator had to face when he was about to break through by a Great Realm.

He hadn’t expected these two guys, who had occupied the Nine Heavens Holy Land like a dove occupies the magpie’s nest, would break through their own shackles because of his words. Just from this, it was quite evident that these two guys were very talented. It was just that they were limited by the meagre World Energy of Tong Xuan Realm, and were unable to break through.

Just as they finished howling, Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai flew into the sky with a serious look on their faces and separated from each other, preparing to face the World Energy baptism.

“What did you do to the two Young Lords?” Ling’er’s beautiful face lost all colour as she rushed to Yang Kai and asked loudly.

The other girls also rushed over and surrounded Yang Kai. Worry and anger were clearly visible in their beautiful eyes; worried for Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai while angry at Yang Kai.

It seemed that as long as something happened to Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai, they would beat Yang Kai to death.

“I didn’t do anything. Weren’t you watching?” Yang Kai was in a jam. “I just spoke a few words to them that’s all.”

“Then why are they like this?” Ling’er was on the verge of crying.

“Don’t worry, they will come down stronger in a while!” Yang Kai patiently explained.

“Save it for someone who would believe you, you scoundrel! Sisters, let’s beat him up.” A round-faced girl from the crowd shouted angrily.

Just as she proposed this, all the girls raised their fists and rained their punches at Yang Kai.

“Huh, where is he?” In the next moment, Ling’er screamed in shock. She was shocked to discover that Yang Kai, who should be sitting on the chair, couldn’t be found anywhere. All their punches just hit the air.

“Was he... a ghost?” That round-faced girl turned pale as she asked cautiously.

Just as she said this, everyone turned pale and shuddered in horror when they recalled that they had been with the ghost for so long.

On one of the Nine Peaks, Yang Kai heaved a sigh. “The girls are afraid of nothing these days.”

These girls’ Martial Dao cultivation might not be high, but their determination to defend Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai was not a joke. It really made Yang Kai helpless. If he stayed any longer, he might have been crushed by the waves, so Yang Kai had no choice but to flee decisively.

In the sky, two human figures stood in the air as the might of heaven and earth struck them one after another, making them scream, but their cries contained unyielding will and joy.

After a long while, the phenomena over the Nine Heavens Holy Land finally and slowly scattered.

Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai immediately appeared in the pavilion at the same time. They looked at each other and burst into laughter.

Although the two looked quite embarrassed, they had already broken through the Saint Realm and advanced to the Saint King Realm.

“Young Lords, are you all right?” Ling’er and the girls anxiously rushed over and asked.

“We are okay! Well, where is that friend?” Lin Yu Hao looked around but when he didn’t find Yang Kai, he was shocked.

“That Ghost was driven away by us!” Ling’er waved her fist as she claimed the credit.

“Ghost...” Yi Zheng Kai’s face twitched a little. Although he had no idea how strong Yang Kai was, judging by the fact that Lin Yu Hao and he advanced simultaneously with just a few words from him was a proof in itself that Yang Kai stood at a height they could only look up to. Even if they had broken through to the Saint Realm, they didn’t dare to compare themselves with Yang Kai.

Such a powerful expert had been called a ghost by these girls.

“You actually drove him away?” Lin Yu Hao looked upset.

“Young Lord, did we do something wrong?” Ling’er asked nervously. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“No harm, no harm!” Yi Zheng Kai hurriedly waved his hand, “It’s not related to you, you guys...”

Yi Zheng Kai abruptly paused before he could finish anything. He perked his ears to listen closely. Suddenly, a look of joy appeared on his face. He immediately looked at Lin Yu Hao and found that he too was looking at him happily. The two understood each other and nodded slightly.

“You guys stay here, Brother Yi and I will be back in a jiffy.” Lin Yu Hao ordered before he stamped on the ground and shot towards a direction. Yi Zheng Kai closely followed behind him.

After a few minutes, the two simultaneously arrived at the peak where Yang Kai was. When they caught sight of that mysterious and eminent figure, both of them turned serious and cupped their fists. “Thank you very much for your advice, Senior. I hope Senior can forgive us for our past transgression.”

Although they didn’t know how old Yang Kai was, since he was stronger than them, he might be an old monster who had lived for hundreds of years. Addressing him as a Senior wasn’t shameful.

“Senior!?” Yang Kai touched his nose and said with a chuckle, “Don’t address me like that, I’m very young. Furthermore, I didn’t point you to how to break through, you broke through on your own. It has nothing to do with me.”

Had Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai not prepared to go out and contribute to the continent, Yang Kai would not have bothered to pay attention to them.

At first, he had decided to drive the two away. This Nine Heavens Holy Land was his territory, so he wanted to lay a Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array here. How could he allow someone else to occupy it? But after he noticed that these two were good-hearted, Yang Kai came up with another idea.

Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai looked at each other before the former asked, “Then... how do we address you, Friend?”

“Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai!?” Yi Zheng Kai furrowed his brow. “I think... Where have I heard this name? It sounds so familiar.”

“Your Excellency, you wouldn’t happen to be...” Lin Yu Hao, on the other hand, looked at Yang Kai in shock. “Are you...”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“It’s really you!?” Lin Yu Hao was dumbfounded.

“Brother Lin...” Yi Zheng Kai looked at Lin Yu Hao for help. He still hadn’t figured out where he had heard the name Yang Kai.

“Brother Yi is truly forgetful.” Lin Yu Hao smiled bitterly, “Weren’t we just discussing that we will follow the Nine Heavens Holy Lord’s footsteps? Now, that very Lord had appeared before us and Brother Yi can’t even recognize him!?”

Yi Zheng Kai lost his voice, “Nine Heavens Holy Lord! So you are the Nine Heavens Holy Lord!?”

Nine Heavens Holy Land Lord was like the Great Demon God to the entire Tong Xuan Realm. He was a legendary figure.

Many people only knew of Nine Heavens Holy Land Lord but unaware of his name, just like the Great Demon God. After so many years, everyone only knew of Great Demon God, but most had forgotten his name.

Yi Zheng Kai couldn’t recall for a while, but when Lin Yu Hao reminded him, he was completely shocked.

In the next moment, his expression changed as drops of cold sweat trickled down his forehead. He immediately cupped his fists and apologized, “It turns out that Holy Master Yang had appeared before us, but Brother Lin and I had eyes but failed to see. I hope Holy Master Yang will forgive us.”

Lin Yu Hao too apologized in horror, “Since Holy Master Yang has returned, Brother Yi and I will immediately leave the Nine Heavens Holy Land. I hope Holy Master Yang won’t blame us for disturbing this paradise.”
