Hei Yuan’s expression darkened, “Do you think you’re capable of doing it?”

“You’ll soon find out if I’m capable or not!” Yang Kai snorted, looking high-spirited as he pointed his spear at his opponent, “Don’t even think about running away, as today, either you die, or I perish, there is no third possibility!”

“Run?” Hei Yuan was so furious that he started laughing as his Territory Lord aura rose. Black Ink Strength swirled around his burly figure as he roared, “How dare a trivial ant like you challenge this Lord! You court death!”

As his horrifying pressure burst forth, space started contorting. Under the influence of his fury, Hei Yuan’s robust figure expanded and became even more intimidating.

Standing in front of Hei Yuan, Yang Kai was so petite that it was as though he was really just an ant.

In the next instant, a huge fist came at Yang Kai. Faced with such an imposing attack, Yang Kai had never been more solemn, because wherever the fist went, space would shatter apart.

This showed how powerful a Territory Lord truly was, and the situation was quite unlike what Yang Kai had imagined. The damage to Hei Yuan’s Soul didn’t seem to affect his strength at all.

This reality surprised Yang Kai, but he didn’t have time to ponder on it. Faced with Hei Yuan’s punch, he didn’t hesitate to cover himself in spear light and charge towards his opponent. As he infused his Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm World Force into the Azure Dragon Spear, he was determined to pierce through whatever stood in front of him.

As the violent forces clashed, Yang Kai felt an immense power sweeping across his figure. He almost lost grip of his spear as the force easily shattered all of his defences, causing him to see stars as he was sent flying backwards while spraying out a mouthful of blood in mid-air.

If not for the fact that he had the World Tree’s clone, his Small Universe would have turned upside down because of this one attack. Once a cultivator’s Small Universe was shaken, his power would severely weaken. When that happened, his life or death would be controlled by his opponent.

Despite the fact that Yang Kai’s Small Universe was robust, he couldn’t make up for the gap between their powers.

A relentless Hei Yuan was determined to capture Yang Kai and charged forward, throwing out his fist again.

Yang Kai raised his spear to intercept the attack, but his attempt was futile and he was sent flying away again.

*Hong hong hong…*

A violent force swept across the void with every attack that Hei Yuan launched. Despite being defiant, Yang Kai was powerless to counterattack, as though he was a mere sandbag.

Barely a moment later, he was covered in blood, looking completely battered.

Struck by Hei Yuan’s fist again, Yang Kai flew out several hundred kilometres and crashed into a universe fragment and remained there, unmoving.

Hei Yuan strode towards Yang Kai, and with every step he took, he crossed several dozen kilometres. It only took him a moment to reach Yang Kai, and as he looked down at him, he spoke in a voice so loud that it reverberated across the void, “Have you lost all hope, ant? Don’t worry. I won’t kill you, for you are still useful to the Royal Lord. I initially had no idea where to look for you, but since you’ve delivered yourself right to me, I’ll not let you go.”

“Stop shamelessly boasting,” Yang Kai sneered as he stood straight up without a warning, the blood on his face giving him a hideous look, “Do you seriously think I’m unable to fight back? I was just trying to ascertain the gap between our strengths.”

The calm expression on Yang Kai’s face made Hei Yuan even more furious though and he exerted more force with his grip, resulting in the sounds of bones cracking. He lifted Yang Kai and said grimly, “Have you ascertained the gap between us now?”

Yang Kai let out a breath, “En, and you’re not as powerful as I thought.”

“Now who is boasting shamelessly?” Hei Yuan growled, “You’re in my grasp now. I can squeeze you to death if I feel like it!”

Yang Kai just grinned at him though, and in the next instant, an invisible force condensed into a spike and stabbed into Hei Yuan’s forehead. An unsuspecting Hei Yuan felt that a stake had penetrated his head. He was instantly overwhelmed by excruciating pain, which caused him to flail and groan in agony.

Yang Kai, who was right in front of him, gripped his spear and stabbed it into Hei Yuan’s left eye, directly destroying it. Black Ink Strength and dark blood gushed out of the now empty eye socket and dyed Yang Kai black.

Hei Yuan roared even louder as he staggered backwards.

In excruciating pain, he instinctually tightened his grip in an attempt to kill Yang Kai. Certainly, Yang Kai wouldn’t let that happen. As he roared, he transformed into a 30,000-metre-long gigantic creature and effortlessly broke free from Hei Yuan’s grip. Yang Kai next directly struck Hei Yuan with his Dragon Tail and sent him flying away like an arrow.

Hei Yuan only managed to stabilize himself with difficulty after flying across several thousand kilometres. As he covered his wounded eye with one hand, he sported a grim expression, dark blood streaming through the gaps between his fingers.

Yang Kai had turned back into his Human Form, and with the Azure Dragon Spear in hand, he sauntered towards Hei Yuan. Although he still looked battered, he wasn’t dispirited at all; instead, he appeared condescending.

As the Human drew closer, Hei Yuan couldn’t help but step backwards, his only remaining eye filled with horror.

Yang Kai said impassively, “Do you think you can intimidate me just by showing your strength? Such a display only proves how weak you are. I guess it’s really hard to heal the damage in your Soul. Am I right, Sir Hei Yuan?”

“You knew from the start!” Hei Yuan said through clenched teeth.

Yang Kai snorted, “Of course I knew. If I wasn’t confident, I wouldn’t have looked for you in the first place. This place will be your grave. Are you ready to die, Hei Yuan?”

Upon finishing his words, he lifted his spear and vanished into thin air.

When he reappeared, he was already right in front of Hei Yuan. In an overbearing manner, Yang Kai thrust his Azure Dragon Spear towards his enemy’s other eye.

A flustered Hei Yuan extended his fist in a hurry in an attempt to intercept this attack, but in that instant, Yang Kai pushed his Spiritual Energy again and launched another attack on Hei Yuan’s Soul.

Instantly, Hei Yuan growled, feeling as though someone had stuck a knife into his head. The pain caused his figure to shudder. Just like Yang Kai had said, it wasn’t easy to heal the damage to one’s Soul, and Hei Yuan’s was badly injured during their previous confrontation in that special space. It was now a fatal weakness which Yang Kai could use against him.

If he were at his peak, Yang Kai couldn’t have easily attacked his Soul; however, given the state he was in, Hei Yuan couldn’t possibly fend off Yang Kai’s attack on his Soul.

His injured Soul was attacked once again, which caused his defence to slip and Yang Kai easily bypassed it with his spear.

At the critical moment, Hei Yuan tilted his head and saved his remaining eye from being gouged out. Although there was now a wound on his head, physically he was still fine.

Just as Yang Kai was ready to push out his spear again, Hei Yuan swung his arm out and swept him away. The next moment, he turned around and ran away at full speed.

Yang Kai couldn’t believe that his opponent had fled just like this. He had been targeting the damage in Hei Yuan’s Soul, so the latter was completely powerless to go against him. If Hei Yuan hadn’t fled, he would be doomed.

As Yang Kai stared at his opponent’s back, he slightly lowered his head, “No one can flee from me. Don’t even dream about it, Hei Yuan!”

Saying so, he manipulated Space Principles.

Instantly, Hei Yuan’s movements became sluggish, as though he was stuck in a quagmire. But soon, a powerful force burst from his figure, which allowed him to struggle out of the constraint.

Yang Kai frowned in surprise, for this was the first time he saw that someone able to break through his Space Principles restraint with such ease.

However, Hei Yuan was still a Territory Lord while Yang Kai was just a Seventh-Order Master, so the raw power difference between them was still quite large. It wasn’t surprising that Hei Yuan could do this.

Based on Yang Kai’s observation, Hei Yuan was still able to fully utilize his strength as long as his Soul wasn’t attacked.

But when his Soul was targeted, his power would drop considerably.

Initially, Yang Kai wanted to settle this issue quickly, but now it seemed that he had to act carefully. It would be terrible if Hei Yuan became desperate and went all out against him without caring for his own life.

Yang Kai still remembered vividly that when he joined forces with Bai Yi to deal with the wounded Zhu Feng back then; they were almost killed despite the Territory Lord being terribly wounded.

At the thought of this, Yang Kai chased after his opponent and shouted, “You can’t run, Hei Yuan!”

At the same time, he struck with his spear and manipulated Space Principles to restrict Hei Yuan’s movements.

Noticing the danger coming from behind, Hei Yuan turned around and roared before pushing out his fist. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

A well-prepared Yang Kai used the same trick by sending out a Spiritual Energy attack. Instantly, Hei Yuan staggered, and his punch was significantly weakened.

While enduring the attack, Yang Kai jabbed his spear into the side of Hei Yuan’s belly and madly surged his World Force. A hole was formed in Hei Yuan’s abdomen as a result.

The two of them traded injuries, and seeing how Yang Kai was forced back, Hei Yuan quickly turned around and fled.

Soon, Yang Kai caught up though and repeated the process.

Barely half a year ago, Yang Kai had been running away from Hei Yuan for such a long time that the World Force in his Small Universe had almost dried up. Now, the prey had become the hunter. He was the one pursuing Hei Yuan. It seemed that Hei Yuan had run out of luck.

Hei Yuan knew that he was unable to flee from Yang Kai as the latter was a Master of the Dao of Space; however, he didn’t lose hope. Every time Yang Kai attacked him, he would be injured as well. As they kept wounding each other, Hei Yuan hoped that Yang Kai would be the one who could no longer persevere. Only then would he stand a chance to escape.

Unfortunately for Hei Yuan, he wasn’t aware that this was the situation Yang Kai had deliberately created.

In fact, Yang Kai wasn’t unable to dodge Hei Yuan’s counterattacks at all. There were several times when he could have completely evaded such attacks, but he still chose to clash with Hei Yuan despite knowing that he would be wounded as well.
