Zhong Liang said, “Since those Humans are living in your Small Universe, you can just ensure that there’ll always be food on the table for them and that they won’t have to worry about anything when cultivating. Additionally, you can provide some incentives for giving birth. That way, you’ll be able to increase the population.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai nodded, “You have a point. I’ll come up with ways to go about it.”

In fact, the population of Humans living in his Small Universe had increased significantly over the years; after all, his Small Universe was abundant in resources, and there were no major conflicts. Even the commoners living in it wouldn’t have to worry about most basic needs.

Yang Kai had never been concerned about the number of people living in his Small Universe. Being born, growing old, falling ill, and passing away were all parts of the cycle of life, and it was this very cycle that continued to strengthen the heritage of his Small Universe.

Now that there was a World Tree clone in his Small Universe though, Yang Kai had to seriously consider how to increase the Human population.

“You’ve just obtained the World Tree, so it’s not certain whether there are any downsides. You shall stay in the Inner Sanctum for the time being and not go anywhere,” Zhong Liang ordered, “Moreover, it has been peaceful around Blue Sky Pass recently, and we aren’t anticipating any major conflicts for several decades to come. You should seize this chance to cultivate and increase your strength.”

“Yes,” Yang Kai replied, “Sir, I’d like to head to Pill Hall.”

Zhong Liang asked in puzzlement, “Pill Hall? Why are you going there?”

Yang Kai replied, “The owner of the Sealed World that I consumed was a Grandmaster Alchemist. I happened to study the basics of Alchemic Dao in the past and have refined a lot of that ancient Senior’s Alchemic Dao Essence after taking in his Sealed World. Therefore, it could be said that I’ve acquired some of his inheritance.”

Zhong Liang’s brow twitched, “You’re also well-versed in the Alchemic Dao?”

“I only studied a bit of it in the past. My achievements in it aren’t worth mentioning now,” Yang Kai replied humbly.

Ding Yao frowned, “Do you want to continue cultivating the Alchemic Dao? You’ll risk being a jack of all trades but a master of none. Only by focusing on what you’re best at would you have a bright future in the Martial Dao.”

Shen Tu Mo nodded in agreement, “There isn’t a lack of Alchemists on the Black Ink Battlefield. What we lack are ingredients to use in Alchemy. Don’t get distracted because of that.”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Sirs have misunderstood. I’m not planning to cultivate the Alchemic Dao. Other than acquiring a part of the Senior’s inheritance, I also discovered a handwritten record he’d left behind in the Sealed World. Although it is tattered and incomplete, some of the information is still useful. I just want to give something I found a test. If I succeed, it will result in pills that will be useful to those in the Inner Sanctum.”

“A handwritten record?” Ding Yao was surprised.

Yang Kai waved his hand and fished out something that was the size of a palm. It was neither made from gold or jade. This item appeared quite dated and was tattered with quite a number of cracks on it.

It was the handwritten record left behind by the Sealed World’s former owner.

If Yang Kai hadn’t swallowed the entire Sealed World, he wouldn’t have found this thing.

The handwritten record was buried deep beneath the ground.

Doing so, he had practically rummaged through the entire Sealed World and dug up everything that was hidden within it.

This handwritten record was one of the rewards of that effort. Another reward was a number of rare herbs that hadn’t been picked in the Sealed World.

Yang Kai and Bai Yi hadn’t fully explored the Sealed World back then and had simply stopped doing so after discovering the medicine garden. Naturally, there were still a lot of herbs in the Sealed World which were all now transplanted to the medicine garden in his Small Universe.

The information in the handwritten record was messy; after all, this thing was both ancient and damaged. Nevertheless, Yang Kai was aware that this handwritten record contained the Senior’s insights on Alchemy as well as some strange pill recipes.

One of the relatively complete pill recipes especially caught his attention.

After taking the handwritten record from Yang Kai, Zhong Liang infused his Divine Sense into it and went through the information. A moment later, he asked with a frown, “You can understand this?”

As he examined it, he realised that there was indeed some information in the handwritten record; however, the words used were different from the modern language, so it was hard for him to comprehend it. There were also some strange words that were unrecognisable to him. They were apparently some ancient characters that had long ago ceased to be used.

Yang Kai replied honestly, “I can only understand some of it, so I need to verify some things through experimentation.”

After all, he had refined a lot of Alchemic Dao Essence from the Sealed World, so it could be said that he had acquired a part of the Alchemist’s inheritance. Yang Kai was probably the only one in the world who could understand the handwritten record.

After Ding Yao and the others went through the note, they all appeared puzzled. Just like Zhong Liang, they didn’t understand it.

Following a moment of deliberation, Zhong Liang nodded, “You can go to Pill Hall. I’ll inform them about it so that they’ll give you the assistance you need.”

“Many thanks, Sir.”

Zhong Liang waved his hand, “However, you must focus on cultivating and must not waste your time.”

“I’ll not forget your guidance, Sir.”

Zhong Liang and the others soon left the place.

It was then that Yang Kai returned to Dawning Light and met up with the members of Dawn. Dawning Light soon turned into a streak of light that flew towards the Inner Sanctum.

Upon entering Blue Sky Pass, Yang Kai directly headed to the Pill Hall.

The Pill Hall was a complex located in the Northwest sector of Blue Sky Pass. All the Alchemists in Blue Sky Pass gathered together in this place.

It had to be noted that there were over 20,000 soldiers in Blue Sky Pass, so the need for Spirit Pills was insatiable. They wouldn’t require expensive Spirit Pills to cultivate, but when war broke out, the rate at which healing pills and restorative pills were consumed would be astonishing.

Therefore, regardless of whether there was a war going on or not, those in the Pill Hall were always swamped with work. Every Alchemist there had to exert themselves to produce the Spirit Pills that were needed by the soldiers in the Inner Sanctum.

There was also a large medicine garden in the Pill Hall where a lot of rare Spirit Herbs were grown. Those from the Inner Sanctum couldn’t possibly always rely on the people in the 3,000 Worlds to send them herbs, so every Great Pass had its own medicine garden that was well taken care of.

In the medicine garden in Blue Sky Pass, there were actually hundreds of Profound Yin fruit trees.

The need for Profound Yin Spirit Fruits was also insatiable. A lot of soldiers in the Inner Sanctum had given up parts of their Small Universe before, so they longed for these fruit trees to bear fruit.

Someone was already waiting for Yang Kai when he arrived at Pill Hall.

The person’s eyes brightened when he saw Yang Kai, and then he shuffled forward and cupped his fist, “You must be Senior Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai saluted him back, “It is this Yang.”

There was a hospitable smile on that person’s face, “I am Tang Qun. The Hall Master has told me to receive you here. He has ordered that any demand you have is to be met.”

“I’m sorry for troubling you, then,” Yang Kai replied gratefully.

“This way, please.” Tang Qun extended his hand.

Yang Kai thanked him again and followed him into the Pill Hall. The moment he stepped inside the main building, he felt a gush of hot air whisking across his face. The Alchemists inside were clearly busy at work.

Both sides of the main hall were lined with secret rooms. Most rooms were closed while only a small number of them were open and empty. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai looked around and realised that there was an Alchemy Furnace in every room that was not closed. There was also a Grand Array inside every room that was used to produce a potent Alchemy Flame.

As Tang Qun moved forward, he explained, “There are three kinds of Pill Rooms in the Pill Hall, graded as Heaven, Earth, and Mortal. Every room is equipped with an Alchemy Furnace and a Grand Array that’s used to produce and regulate Alchemy Flames. In total, there are 200 Mortal Rank Pill Rooms, 50 Earth Rank Pill Rooms, and 8 Heaven Rank Pill Rooms. What kind of Spirit Pills are you going to refine and what Pill Room would you like to use, Senior Brother Yang?”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai replied, “I’m not in a rush to make any pills. There’s something I need to ask you about, though.”

Tang Qun replied, “Go ahead. This Tang will tell you everything he can.”

Yang Kai then fished out a strand of Spirit Grass, “How much of this Spirit Grass do you have in the Pill Hall?”

After taking the Spirit Grass, Tang Qun examined it and said, “Obsidian Grass? We have some reserves of it in the Pill Hall, but there’s not a lot. It’s just a supplementary ingredient for refining the Heavenly Pearl Soul Soothing Pills, so there isn’t a huge demand for it. Although we have some of this grass in the medicine garden, it’s not a lot as we’ll only use it infrequently.”

“A medicine garden?” Yang Kai was astounded, “There’s a medicine garden in the Pill Hall?”

Tang Qun replied with a smile, “Of course we have a medicine garden in the Pill Hall. Many of the Spirit Herbs found in the Sealed Worlds have been moved back to this place; after all, a lot of herbs on the Black Ink Battlefield are different from those in the 3,000 Worlds. Sometimes, even the Master Alchemists can’t identify them. We still don’t know what the uses of some of the herbs in the medicine garden are. Regardless, we’ve transplanted them to this place.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I need some of this… Obsidian Grass.”

In the handwritten record left behind by the ancient Alchemist, this Spirit Grass was not a supplementary ingredient for producing Heavenly Pearl Soul Soothing Pills, but the main ingredient for refining another kind of Spirit Pill. In the handwritten record, this Spirit Grass was not named Obsidian Grass; however, since Blue Sky Pass had its own name for it, Yang Kai didn’t find it necessary to correct them.

He just wanted to try out a pill recipe recorded in the handwritten record. It would be fine if he failed; however, if he succeeded, it would be wonderful news for the Human Race.

Yang Kai then listed a few other herbs. Tang Qun took note of them and told some people to send these herbs over.

Then, Tang Qun asked, “Are you going to be refining pills now, Senior Brother? What kind of Pill Room do you want?”

After pondering on it for a moment, Yang Kai replied, “I’ll use a Heaven Rank Pill Room, then.”

Since the Pill Rooms were divided into Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Ranks, he reckoned that the highest Rank Pill Room would be the best. He was pretty skilful at Alchemy back then, but compared to his cultivation now, his mastery of Alchemy left much to be desired. His skills in Alchemy were no longer on par with his cultivation, so he reckoned that he could increase the chance of successfully producing the pill he was trying to by using a better room.

Tang Qun nodded, “There happens to be an empty Heaven Rank Pill Room. Please come with me, Senior Brother.”

Upon finishing his words, Tang Qun led the way.
