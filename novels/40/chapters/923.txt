Chapter 924, Wait And See

Outside the nine peaks, Yang Kai was being hugged by two identical twin beauties while the veiled Little Senior Sister stood nearby and smiled.

The Holy Land disciples who were responsible for guarding this place all starred with looks of pure admiration on their faces, all of them thinking that their Holy Master was a real man with deep and profound methods, even capable of conquering these two beautiful sisters.

“Alright, haven’t you two had enough yet?” Yang Kai was on the verge of suffocating while the amazing softness he felt on his chest was making him feel awkward so he quickly pinched the two young women’s waists playfully to get them to release him.

The two sisters swiftly released Yang Kai and directed bitter stares towards him.

“What?” Yang Kai asked vigilantly, “You delivered yourselves on your own, it’s not like I was trying to take advantage of you.”

“After not seeing you for so many years, I see you’re still as good at annoying others as always,” The charming woman snorted, “All this time we’ve been thinking and worrying about your safety but it turns out you’ve become a big shot Holy Master here, it seems all our worries were in vain.”

“You were worried about me?” Yang Kai stared at her with a stunned look upon his face, “I’m honored.”

“That’s wrong... I didn’t... it was Mei’er who was always thinking of you,” The woman’s face turned bright red as she let fly a flurry of denials.

“Elder Sister was too.”

“Was not!”

“Good, you don’t want to start quarrelling as soon as you meet each time, let’s go inside to talk,” Xia Ning Chang also regained her composure and softly interjected.

Yang Kai grinned and beckoned to the two sisters, “Come with me, there’s no need for you to feel like an outsider here.”

“No thanks,” The Elder Sister snorted, pulling her little sister and Xia Ning Chang’s hands as she lead them into the nine peaks.

Yang Kai shook his head wryly as he stared at their backs, his face gradually becoming serious.

The two sisters were none other than the Blood Battle Gang’s famous Hu Sisters, Hu Jiao Er and Hu Mei Er.

Because Yang Kai had constantly been seeking for information about the Central Capital during this time, when he heard Great Elder report that a pair of twins had come to see him, he couldn’t help thinking about the Hu Sisters.

Then, as the Great Elder described them, Yang Kai all but confirmed his guess.

Back in the Inheritance Heaven’s Cave, Yang Kai and Su Yan obtained the ultimate inheritance, the one which belonged to Dragon Phoenix Palace.

The Hu Sisters also obtained a profound inheritance called the Twin Qi Shared Spirit Divine Art. After cultivating this Secret Art, the two sister’s auras and True Qi fluctuations had become exactly the same.

The Hu Sisters being here meant that the Central Capital and Tong Xuan Realm really had been connected, and perhaps something had happened to them.

“Holy Master... these two girls...” Xu Hui, who had been on the sidelines the whole time, hesitantly spoke, wanting to probe what the relationship between the twins and Yang Kai was but also feeling like he was acting too nosy.

“It’s not what you think!” Yang Kai shot him a glance.

“I understand,” Xu Hui nodded quickly.

Inside the nine peaks, the two sisters walked around and explored their surroundings, constantly exclaiming. Even in Tong Xuan Realm, Nine Heavens Holy Land was considered a top force, so the scenery and aura within the nine peaks were obviously incomparable to anything the Central Capital had.

Arriving here immediately broadened the two sister’s horizons, making them appear like two country girls who had never seen the big city before.

Back in the Holy Master Court, Xia Ning Chang helped the two sisters settle in while Yang Kai personally poured tea for them. An Ling’er also soon came bringing with her a tray of rare spirit fruits.

The Hu Sisters seemed to have not had a good rest for a very long time, the look of exhaustion on their pretty faces apparent to all and their True Qi auras showing signs of overdraft. Upon smelling the spirit fruits, the two of them gulped unconsciously.

Hu Jiao Er reached out and unceremoniously took two pieces of fruit, handing one to Hu Mei Er before biting into the one she kept.

Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang sat down next to each other and waited for the Hu Sisters to restore themselves.

After eating several spirit fruits in succession, the two seemed to recover some of their vigour and Yang Kai asked, “Judging from your travel worn looks, it seems you’ve been on the road for quite some time, yes?”

The Hu Sisters nodded together, “It’s been almost three months.”

Yang Kai took a soft breath, “It’s been hard for you.”

Both of them were First Order Transcendents, so three months of constant travel had no doubt been extremely draining, it was inevitable that they were exhausted.

“Yang Kai, you have to hurry back, there may be something happening on that side,” Hu Jiao Er suddenly frowned as she spoke anxiously.

“I know,” Yang Kai gently nodded.

“You know?” The Hu Sisters stared blankly at him.

“To be honest, some things have happened here in the recent period and I have been searching for a way back, it’s just that until now I haven’t been able to discover any clues so your arrival is really fortuitous. Tell me carefully about how you got here.”

The Hu Sisters exchanged a look before Hu Jiao Er began explaining, “Do you still not remember where the Inheritance Heaven’s Cave opened? That mine that belonged to my Hu Family.”

“Of course I remember,” Yang Kai nodded.

“It was three or four months ago when a strange phenomenon occurred in that place.”

After listening to Hu Jiao Er’s remarks, Yang Kai realized how the two sisters had come to Tong Xuan Realm and also why they trekked tens of thousands of kilometres to find Nine Heavens Holy Land.

Three or four months ago, in the place where the Inheritance Heaven’s Cave once opened, a dark hole suddenly appeared. After receiving notification about this event, the Hu Sisters went in to investigate.

Currently, in the Blood Battle Gang, and even throughout their entire world, the Hu Sisters’ strength ranked among the highest.

Because they had confidence in their own strength, the Hu Sisters weren’t afraid of any dangers and boldly entered the dark hole, planning on carefully exploring what lay on the other side.

After all, they had already experienced the Inheritance Heaven’s Cave and mistakenly thought that this dark hole was quite similar to the entrance which had appeared that time. Little did they know that the Void Corridor that appeared this time was actually a pathway leading to Tong Xuan Realm.

And so, the two of them accidentally arrived in Tong Xuan Realm.

The two sisters searched around for two days and soon discovered that they had come to a completely different place than they had expected. They also discovered many traces of cultivator activities and even noticed several masters they could not see through.

At that moment, they realized they had arrived in an entirely different world.

While preparing to return to Blood Battle Gang though, the sisters discovered to their horror that the entrance they had passed through was already surrounded by cultivators from a certain force.

Among the cultivators guarding the entrance, there were many powerful masters. All alone, the two sisters understood they could not approach this place easily and whenever they tried they were forced to retreat.

Under the circumstances, the two of them could only wait nearby hoping to find a chance to sneak through.

However, such an opportunity never arrived.

At that time, they remembered Yang Kai who had left the Central Capital ten years ago and with the mentality of using medicine to treat a dead horse, went around inquiring about him, hoping that perhaps he too was in this world and that if he was, he could help them return home.

Neither of them held out much hope but they still went around asking.

Throughout Tong Xuan Realm, Nine Heavens Holy Land’s reputation had reached an unparalleled height and Yang Kai as the master of the Holy Land was equally well known.

After inquiring for a while, the sisters found that the age and appearance of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Holy Master were quite similar to the young man they knew so they immediately rushed over to Nine Heavens Holy Land.

The reason why the two sisters were so excited when they saw Yang Kai was that because he was the Yang Kai they knew. With all the tension and burden weighing down on them for the past few months finally lifted, they even momentarily lost their self-control and clung on to him.

“I didn’t expect that you really were the Holy Master of this place, but seeing how you are, things should be simple to resolve. Since you command the Holy Land, you must be able to communicate with that force to ensure they don’t harm Blood Battle Gang and the other people on that side, right?” Hu Jiao Er looked at Yang Kai eagerly, pinning all her hopes on him.

“Do you still remember the way back? Also, what was the name of the force that drove you away?”

“I don’t remember the way back...” Hu Jiao Er slowly shook her head, “This place is far too vast, but I heard from some cultivators back there that the force occupying the way back was called Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple.”

“Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple?” Yang Kai frowned, vaguely feeling like he had heard that name somewhere before.

“That place is not close,” An Ling’er, who had been sitting and listening the whole time, spoke up, “These two must have taken a roundabout path, otherwise they should have been able to reach the Holy Land within two months from that location.”

“Do you know about that force?” Yang Kai turned to look at her.

An Ling’er smiled, “Saintesses learn many things, naturally that includes the strength and location of the world’s important forces. Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple is a relatively powerful force with several Saint Realm masters, the most powerful one probably having reached the Second Order.”

“Basically on par with the Holy Land!”

“You could say that,” An Ling’er smiled and nodded, “However, in terms of reputation and prestige they are absolutely incomparable with the current Holy Land. Still, they shouldn’t be underestimated.”

Listening to her, the Hu Sisters’ faces became dignified.

In their eyes, this Nine Heavens Holy Land was quite tyrannical, but if it was only equal in strength with Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple, it was uncertain if they could rely on this place’s influence to resolve the other side’s crisis.

“Then we’ll have to see if they know their limits, if they’re willing to back down, naturally we won’t embarrass them, but if they aren’t...

“What then?”

“Just wait and see!” Yang Kai grinned, his eyes flashing a cold light, like a sharp blade.

The Hu Sisters’ beautiful eyes light up as they filled with expectation.

This man was just as domineering as he was in the past!

Anyone who dared look down on or act hostile towards him would pay a heavy price.

The hearts of the two sisters relaxed once again, feeling that as long as Yang Kai acted, they wouldn’t need to worry about their Sect at all.

Yang Kai immediately sent out a Divine Sense Message and a moment later, the sound of rushing wind filled the hall.

The Holy Land’s six Elders and the four Ancient Demon Clan leaders simultaneously appeared.

“Holy Master.”

“Master!”

All of them bowed as they stared towards Yang Kai seriously. They didn’t know why he had suddenly summoned all the high-level members of the Holy Land together, but they faintly smelled an unusual aura.

Feeling the tyranny strength of these ten people, the Hu Sisters suddenly found themselves having difficulty breathing. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Back in their old world, their strength was top-notch, and if they collaborated together, they were nearly invincible, but at this moment they were shocked to discover that even together they were not the match of any single person here.

At the same time as they felt shocked, they also felt excited seeing the strength Yang Kai commanded.
