In the Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, everyone looked around at each other, still in shock and confusion, mixed with a great deal of pleasant surprise.

“President... are these land deeds really for the entire Soaring Dragon Street?” Gao Hong asked with a trembling voice. If so, the value of this box of land deeds was simply inestimable!

Under the leadership of Hua You Meng, the people of Five Paths Chamber of Commerce had worked hard for more than twenty years before finally managing to purchase a small shop on Soaring Dragon Street, and they weren’t even the official owners, simply renters with a thirty-year contract. Not only did they need to pay a large sum of money to Purple Star City’s administration every year, but the city would come to take back this shop when their contract was over.

But now, a box of more than thirty land deeds had fallen into Hua You Meng’s hands...

This box represented the ownership of more than thirty shops on a main street! Any merchant could see the massive value in it.

Gao Hong and the others almost fainted from happiness.

Hua You Meng’s hands were also trembling as she checked through the box again before she looked up at all the expectant eyes around her and haltingly said, “It’s true...”

“Hahahaha, it is our Five Paths Chamber of Commerce’s time to rise!” Yao Qing kept patting his bald head, seemingly too excited to even settle down, his eyes flashing a fierce light as he thought about the bright future ahead of them. “That damn Heavenly Yuan Firm next door has always been competing maliciously with us, hmph, now let’s see how they fight with us! Just wait, I’ll be sure to sweep them out of their store! That’s right, that Treasure Pill Hall down the street also needs to go. When I went with Hai Tang last time, those arrogant bastards berated us before throwing us out, but now their land deed is in our hands. Let us see if they dare throw Father here out now! Next time, Hai Tang and I will go over there and teach them a lesson!”

Hai Tang stood by his side and nodded vigorously, apparently holding a deep grudge about what had happened last time.

“Only villains seek petty vengeance!” Xia Jing Wu glared at Yao Qing, who only smirked and rubbed his head awkwardly, not daring to offer any rebuttal. In Five Paths Chamber of Commerce, Hua You Meng had the highest prestige, followed by Xia Jing Wu as the chamber of commerce’s strategist. Sometimes, his words carried even more weight than Hua You Meng’s.

“Uncle Xia, how do you see this matter...” Hua You Meng finally recovered from the huge shock and turned to Xia Jing Wu hesitantly.

The latter stroked his beard without any excitement, instead wearing a deep frown as he pondered, only quietly whispering to Hua You Meng a moment later, “President, the core of this matter is there.”

Saying so, he gestured towards the backyard before continuing, “Whether it is the attitude and compensation of Commander Lu yesterday or today’s land deeds, none of it is because of our Five Paths Chamber of Commerce’s abilities. Since the key to all of this does not lie with us, President might as well consult with the one whose opinion does matter. Perhaps, he will have a better understanding of what to do next.”

Hua You Meng thought for a moment before nodding lightly and ordering, “You’re all free to go about your business as usual, but keep what has happened today a secret. As for the chamber of commerce, it will remain closed today.”

Saying so, as if the wind was carrying her feet, Hua You Meng hurried back to the backyard.

Soon after, she returned to the guest house where Yang Kai was staying.

Yang Kai looked at her with a smile, apparently aware of what had just happened outside.

Hua You Meng took out the jade box without any hesitation and placed it on the table in front of Yang Kai before saying, “Sir, this is far too precious for my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce to enjoy. Keeping it will likely just provoke more misfortune for us, so I hope Sir can process it appropriately.”

After recovering from her shock and excitement, she gradually realized that Lu Tian Feng having someone deliver this box of land deeds to her was entirely because of Yang Kai. She did not know Yang Kai’s true background, but because he was here, just one day ago, Lu Tian Feng put on a humble and even reverent demeanour towards Five Paths Chamber of Commerce; however, if one day Yang Kai were to leave, these thirty land deeds would definitely become a disaster to them.

An ordinary man is innocent, but treasures can make one guilty. In Purple Star City, even in the outer city, land deeds were extremely rare and precious treasures that only the most powerful merchants and organizations were qualified to possess. Five Paths Chamber of Commerce was simply too small to have such qualifications.

Would Yang Kai always be there to shelter Five Paths Chamber of Commerce? Hua You Meng knew the answer was no; after all, the other party was an Origin King. It was already the accumulated good karma of their ancestors that he had been willing to help them once, so how could they expect him to continue protecting them from now on?

Yang Kai glanced at her thoughtfully before saying, “Since they were given to you, President Hua should accept them. In any case, these things are worthless to me; even if I accepted them, they’d have no use.”

Hua You Meng gave a wry smile, “But...”

Yang Kai stretched out his hand to interrupt her, “No buts. You can relax and just accept them without any worries. I will bear all the consequences if there are any.”

Hua You Meng stared at Yang Kai in a daze as she was able to understand what kind of commitment he was making. Gratitude welling up inside her heart, she took a deep breath and declared, “Since Sir has said so, this Mistress will simply offer her sincere thanks.”

Although her cultivation was not bad, she was a businesswoman at her core, and no businesswoman would refuse this box of land deeds.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “But I want to know, how does President Hua plan to deal with these land deeds?”

“How do I plan to deal with them?” Hua You Meng froze for a moment before saying, “I have always had a dream: I always wanted to hold the land deed of my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce in my own hand, but land deeds in Purple Star City are so expensive that they are quite difficult to acquire. Our original plan was to spend another ten years or so to save up enough Saint Crystals and buy our land deed, then use this shop as a foundation to slowly develop from a small chamber of commerce to a large chamber of commerce. Standing shoulder to shoulder with a giant like Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce may be impossible, but I wish to one day stand tall enough to not be bullied by anyone!”

As she spoke, she seemed to let go of her restraints and caution, her pretty face turning ruddy with a hint of excitement, “This is not just my personal dream though, but also Uncle Xia, Sister Hong, Yao Qing, and Hai Tang’s dream. We have been working hard towards this dream, doing everything from street peddling to wandering aimlessly to sell our wares. After living such a life, who would not want to have a stable home? Now, this dream has been achieved so easily... With these land deeds, my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce can expand to more than ten times its original size. We will be able to hang our sign above the entire Soaring Dragon Street now and my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce will be able to sell our goods throughout Purple Star City!”

Reaching the end of her speech, Hua You Meng felt her heart racing as her eyes flashed brilliantly, as if she could see a beautiful picture of the future unfold in front of her, sinking her into a wondrous dream.

It was not until she noticed that Yang Kai was looking at her with a smile that Hua You Meng’s expression turned embarrassed, her face going quite red as she whispered, “I’ve shown Sir something embarrassing...”

“Everyone’s dream is sacred, why would I laugh at yours?” Yang Kai said seriously, “President Hua should have struggled very hard these past decades, yes?”

“There has been much hard work, but with my fellow brothers and sisters by my side, hard work is not a problem,” Hua You Meng smiled sweetly, dazzling Yang Kai for a moment.

Seemingly perceiving the change in Yang Kai’s eyes, Hua You Meng quickly lowered her head as her heart began to pound violently, feeling quite nervous as she hoped he would not suddenly take interest in her.

However, when she thought about it again, it actually didn’t seem like a bad proposition to catch the eye of such a young and promising Origin King. Although she had not been in contact with him for long, Hua You Meng was quite proud of her ability to read others. Yang Kai was different from those other Origin Kings who only knew how to act lofty and arrogant. Not only was he approachable, but his appearance wasn’t bad either, having a brave and heroic face and a well-built body...

[What are you thinking about!?] Hua You Meng suddenly screamed to herself as she could not wait to find a hole to crawl into and disappear.

“Good, President Hua seems to have a comprehensive plan for ​​the future, but I wonder if you would be willing to listen to my advice?” Yang Kai naturally didn’t know what Hua You Meng was thinking about, so he simply continued the conversation.

“Sir is the benefactor of my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce. If you have any advice, please do say it,” Hua You Meng quickly composed herself and said.

“These land deeds... Don’t keep any of them, sell them all!” Yang Kai quickly said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Huh?” Hua You Meng was startled, not having expected that Yang Kai would say such a thing. If she did this, then the future dream she had just described would disappear.

All her dreams would never be realized.

“Do you trust me?” Yang Kai looked at Hua You Meng sincerely, staring straight into her eyes.

Being stared at with such a focused gaze, Hua You Meng suddenly became flustered and put aside her eyes before nodding subconsciously, “This Mistress naturally trusts Sir.”

“Very good. While it is not convenient for me to give a specific reason, you can’t keep these land deeds. It would be best to deal with them as soon as possible. One day, you will understand why I am giving you this advice.”

He came to Purple Star City this time to steal their Star Emperor Token, and there was no doubt he would soon come into conflict with Purple Star. Although Lu Tian Feng deliberately showed his favour because of the existence of the Purple Star Order, even sending over so many land deeds, once Yang Kai’s real purpose was exposed, Five Paths Chamber of Commerce would definitely be implicated. At that time, they would definitely not be able to remain in Purple Star City and these land deeds would all become worthless.

The best option for them would be to gather a large number of Saint Crystals while by selling off the land deeds now.

As long as they had enough Saint Crystals, what worry would they have about their chamber of commerce’s future?

Although Hua You Meng did not understand why Yang Kai asked her to do this, after calming down and thinking for a while, she vaguely thought of something and couldn’t help trembling as she nodded, “I understand.”

Yang Kai looked at her deeply and smiled, “President Hua is really an intelligent person.”

“I’m just a small woman who is following Sir’s advice. En, can I ask for Sir’s assistance in a certain matter then?”

“What matter?” Yang Kai became curious.

“Could you accompany me out?”

“What for?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“It’s like this...” Hua You Meng explained, “There are too many land deeds here, and if we really must sell them, I’m afraid my Five Paths Chamber of Commerce won’t be able to do so for a good price, as that is simply beyond our ability. This Mistress wants to hand over these land deeds to Clear Sky Auction House for them to process, that way they will promote them at their auction on our behalf and allow us to maximize our profit while minimizing our risk.”
