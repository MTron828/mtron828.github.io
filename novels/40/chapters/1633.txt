Chapter 1633, I Must Go

Su Yan and Qing Ya actually joined Ice Heart Valley!

Fate was truly unpredictable.

As early as a few years ago, Yang Kai had dealings with people from Ice Heart Valley in the Emperor Garden, and now, after arriving on Scarlet Wave Star by accident, he had learned just how powerful a force Ice Heart Valley was.

However, Yang Kai had never thought that Su Yan and Qing Ya had joined Ice Heart Valley.

If he had known this earlier, he would have come looking for them sooner.

However, Ice Heart Valley only accepted female disciple and was famous for its disciples all cultivating Ice Attribute Secret Arts and Secret Technique. It was truly a suitable place for Su Yan and Qing Ya; after all, Ice Sect, which they had originally belonged to, was quite similar.

“Su Yan has missed you greatly, but she was unable to return to Tong Xuan Realm. She kept telling me all these years that once she could travel the Star Field alone, she would definitely go back to find you,” Qing Ya looked at Yang Kai and couldn’t help reminiscing about Tong Xuan Realm which she had left all those years ago.

“I know, I’ve been looking for her all these years as well,” Yang Kai smiled, but just as he was about to inquire more about Su Yan with Qing Ya, he suddenly frowned and said, “This isn’t a place to stay and talk, we should leave here first.”

Saying so, Yang Kai stretched out his hand and used his Saint Qi to wrap up Qing Ya before quickly disappearing from where they stood.

Ten breaths or so later, a group of seven or eight cultivators appeared in the spot Yang Kai and Qing Ya had just left and their leader furrowed his brow, “There were people here just now, how did they suddenly disappear?”

“Perhaps they noticed our auras and ran away,” Someone speculated.

“En, no matter, our priority is to reinforce our Sect in the battle up ahead,” The leader waved his hand and led the others towards the battlefield.

A few tens of thousands of kilometres away from that battlefield, in a small city, Yang Kai and Qing Ya found an inn and rented a small room.

Inside the room, Yang Kai asked about how Su Yan had been these past few years carefully.

Learning that she was well and had not only entered Ice Heart Valley but also worshipped its Great Elder Ran Yun Ting as her Master, Yang Kai felt completely relieved.

Ice Heart Valley had an Origin King Realm master protecting it, and could not be considered a weak force, so the cultivation of their Great Elder was not low. Being accepted as the disciple of such a master was a great blessing for Su Yan.

Yang Kai even felt faintly grateful to this Ran Yun Ting.

Had it not been for her careful guidance, it would have been impossible for Su Yan to reach the First-Order Origin Returning Realm in such a short time!

Xia Ning Chang had refined Tong Xuan Realm’s Star Source to achieve her current cultivation, so Su Yan being able to stand on equal footing with her simply through her own efforts in cultivation showed how outstanding her aptitude was.

Qing Ya even informed Yang Kai that Su Yan was already preparing to break through to the Second-Order.

Yang Kai felt happy for her from the bottom of his heart!

As for why the pair had joined Ice Heart Valley, it was a simple stroke of luck.

According to Qing Ya, after they were separated from Qian Yue, they had arrived on Green Mountains Star through a Void Corridor. There, Qing Ya, Su Yan, and Qian Hao stayed and cultivated for a time on Green Mountains Star, but with their low strength at the Second and Third-Order Saint Realm, they were unable to earn too many Saint Crystals, far from enough to satisfy their cultivation needs.

All that changed when they met Ran Yun Ting by chance. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At that time, Ran Yun Ting had been on Green Mountains Star for some unspecified reason and after seeing Su Yan, was overjoyed with her innate talent and immediately offered to bring her back to the Ice Heart Valley to cultivate.

How could the trio refuse such a good offer?

After carefully inquiring about Ice Heart Valley, Su Yan and Qing Ya decided to join. As for Qian Hao, because he was a man, he was unable to follow them.

However, Ran Yun Ting arranged for Qian Hao to enter a Sect which was attached to Ice Heart Valley and now he had reached the Second-Order Saint King Realm.

After hearing what Qing Ya said, Yang Kai wore a strange expression.

“So you really were at Green Mountains Star,” He smiled bitterly.

Qian Yue had stayed on the Green Mountains Star for some time but was never able to find any information on Su Yan and the others. Apparently, they had simply been too late.

If Yang Kai had arrived on Green Mountains Star twenty or thirty years earlier, he might still have been able to meet them, but when Qian Yue was there searching for them, Su Yan and the others had already left for Scarlet Wave Star.

“Right, Qian Yue has been missing you greatly as well.”

“You’ve met Qian Yue? Is she alright?” Qing Ya asked with pleasant surprise. After they had been separated that year, she no longer knew how Qian Yue was doing and had been worried about her all this time. Now hearing Yang Kai’s words, Qing Ya was incredibly happy.

“Naturally, she is well, but you should ask her yourself,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Ask her myself?” Qing Ya frowned slightly, wondering what Yang Kai meant.

Yang Kai simply closed his eyes and scanned the Sealed World Bead with his Divine Sense. Quickly finding Qian Yue and confirming that she was not in retreat, he called out to warn her before swiftly bringing her out of the Sealed World Bead.

“What’s the matter?” Qian Yue asked with some confusion after she appeared.

“Look who I found,” Yang Kai pointed behind her and smiled.

Qian Yue turned around and her beautiful eyes instantly bulged as tears formed at their corners. Trembling slightly, she called out in joyful surprise, “Sect Master!”

“Qian Yue...” Qing Ya was also extremely excited.

Although the Star Field was filled with wonders, they had never forgotten their longing to reunite with one another. On Tong Xuan Realm, in the Ice Sect, Qing Ya and Qian Yue had a close relationship, just like sisters, so now that they had met once more after so many years of separation, they were both naturally very emotional.

Both of them had puffy red eyes.

Embracing one another and confirming that they were both well and had advanced greatly in their respective cultivations, the two women continued celebrating joyfully.

“Yang Kai, you actually found Sect Master!” Qian Yue turned a grateful look towards Yang Kai. Since meeting him on Shadowed Star, Qian Yue had always taken looking for Qing Ya and the others as her goal, almost to the point where it became a heart demon for her.

Yang Kai had fulfilled her greatest wish today!

“Where is my brother? Where is Su Yan? Are they alright?” Qian Yue asked anxiously.

“Both your brother Qian Hao and Su Yan are doing well. The Sect he has joined is called the Illusion Soul Sect, you don’t have to worry about his wellbeing,” Qing Ya comforted.

“That’s good, that’s good,” Qian Yue’s cheeks were wet as she continued weeping tears of joy while her face was filled with smiles.

“Come, tell me about your situation over these past few years, I’ve already told Yang Kai about our affairs,” Qing Ya took Qian Yue’s hand and sat down to chat.

Qian Yue obliged and began telling her story.

Learning that she had almost become a brothel woman used to satisfy men, Qing Ya’s expression became ice-cold and she could not help shooting a grateful glance towards Yang Kai.

When she heard that Yang Kai had now almost unified an entire Cultivation Star, Qing Ya was thoroughly shocked.

Even if there were no Origin Kings there, it was not a simple matter to unify a Cultivation Star. Not only did it require overwhelming strength, but also great personal skill and charisma.

Time passed slowly as the two women revelled in their reunion, seemingly never running out of words to say to one another.

Yang Kai did not try to interrupt them and simply sat the side, listening attentively.

It was not until evening that Qing Ya seemed to come back to her senses and apologized to Yang Kai, “It seems we’ve become lost in our conversation.”

“Senior Qing Ya is too serious, I can understand how you feel.”

If he had met Su Yan again like this, he would likely not have shown any more restraint.

“Your cultivation is now far beyond mine, so don’t call me Senior anymore,” Qing Ya smiled. “On top of that, you are a Sect Master now, so whether it is in terms of strength or status, I am no longer comparable to you. If you call me Senior again, it will only make me feel ashamed.”

“Senior is my Senior, that will never change,” Yang Kai shook his head. He never felt that he could despise his elders just because of his strength grew beyond theirs.

“If you don’t mind, please address me as Elder Sister,” Qing Ya smiled, “Su Yan and I now share a Senior Sister, Junior Sister relationship, and this is the Star Field, not Tong Xuan Realm anymore, so there’s no need to be tied down to our past.”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Then just as I address Su Yan, I will call you Senior Sister.”

“Very good,” Qing Ya nodded, thinking of Su Yan, she smiled knowingly. “Su Yan should have heard about you by now, and although she mostly remains in the Inner Island in secluded retreat, not having contact with the outside world, before I left the Sect I wrote her a letter. She comes to visit me at least once a month, so she must have seen that letter and know you are on Scarlet Wave Star by now.”

“Can I enter Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai asked expectantly.

“Do you want to go?” Qing Ya frowned, “Although Ice Heart Valley hasn’t treated Su Yan or me poorly, Ice Heart Valley has moved quite overtly to search for you this time. I don’t know the specific reason, but if you take the initiative to show up in Ice Heart Valley, it is impossible to say what might happen.”

“Then can Su Yan leave Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai asked again.

Qing Ya shook her head, “Great Elder has extremely high expectations for Su Yan, and right now is a crucial moment for her as she prepares to break through to the Second-Order. With the battles between Ice Heart Valley and Brilliant Flame Sect growing ever more frequent, it is highly unlikely Great Elder will allow Su Yan to leave the Sect.”

“Then I must go!” Yang Kai quickly said.

“You...” Qing Ya opened her mouth, seemingly wanting to persuade him, but as soon as she saw the firmness in his look, she knew that no matter what she said it would be useless and immediately sighed. “Let me think about it for a moment.”

Yang Kai nodded and fell silent.

After a long time, Qing Ya sighed and looked up at Yang Kai again, “If you want to enter Ice Heart Valley, you’ll have to expose your identity and allow my Ice Heart Valley’s people to take you in. There is no other way. Ice Heart Valley has never allowed men to set foot into its territory, and for thousands of years there has never been an exception!”

“As long as I reveal myself, they will take the initiative to welcome me in?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“I am not certain, because I don’t know why Ice Heart Valley is looking for you. However, since the actions they took are so big, the Great Elder and Valley Master must have some concerns about you. So, I think it is possible.”

“Then we’ll do that!” Yang Kai grinned, “I’ll have to bother Senior Sister Qing Ya with this.”

“It’s no trouble for me, I simply need to report to the Elders and they will definitely send someone over to escort you back to the Sect!” Qing Ya said seriously, “But are you sure you want to do this? If you enter Ice Heart Valley, there’s no way to predict what will happen to you.”

“It’s fine, I just want to meet Su Yan as soon as possible,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Good. Since you’ve decided to do so, I will contact them,” Qing Ya nodded, took out a communication artifact from her Space Ring, and poured her Divine Sense into it.

Soon after, an obvious Divine Sense fluctuation came from her communication artifact.

A moment later, Qing Ya put away her communication artifact, turned to Yang Kai, and said, “Thirteenth Elder is nearby, she will personally take you back to Ice Heart Valley!”

Silavin: Damn it. We know of the dangers, but he does not. Well, no one inside can realistically harm him. The worst should be an injured First-Order Origin King. So, he should not have too much trouble with her.

However, he will face that old geezer again.

But discover what will happen next time! In the next chapter (actually, a few more than that but ya know)!
