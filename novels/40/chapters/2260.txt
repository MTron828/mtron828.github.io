“En?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Qin Zhao Yang continued, “The power of this sword can only be unleashed in your hands. Little Brother Yang, you can make use of it first until one day, when Yu’er enters the Emperor Realm, then you shall return it to her, is it acceptable?”

Qin Zhao Yang was acting like an old man who would die soon and was arranging his own funeral affairs.

A shimmer of light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes as he realized that Qin Zhao Yang was taking precautionary measures.

Although Qin Zhao Yang was not young anymore, he was still a Dao Source Realm cultivator, so there was no worries about him living a few more decades without any accidents.

However, his cultivation was not remarkably high, and the path of cultivation was always filled with thorns, so no one could guarantee they would have a peaceful death or predict what kind of disasters or crises would befall them.

If such a day came, no one would be left to protect the Qin Family anymore.

Qin Zhao Yang wanted Yang Kai to keep the Myriads Sword for a few reasons. First, an ordinary man is innocent but his treasures made him guilty, so he was worried that the Myriads Sword would draw trouble to the Qin Family. Second, he probably wanted to use this as a bridge, in order to bring Yang Kai closer to the Qin Family.

As long as the Myriads Sword was still in Yang Kai’s hands, he would definitely not sit back and watch if the Qin Family ever suffered any tribulations and, if worse came to worst, there would still be someone to take care of Qin Yu.

Yang Kai already guessed the intentions of Qin Zhao Yang with just a quick thought, but after pondering for a while, he decided not to refuse and replied, “Since Patriarch Qin trusts this Yang so much, I shall make use of this sword for some time in a way that will not damage the prestige of the Qin Family’s ancestors!”

He was familiar with the use of the Myriads Sword now and had already comprehended the few Sword Dao Secret Techniques that could only be used properly with this treasure, so Yang Kai had no objections to keeping it since it could still come in handy.

“Very good, very good!” Qin Zhao Yang was overjoyed.

*Hong long long... *

At that moment, a muffled sound of thunder was heard, like the stampede of thousands of dragon horses, shaking the Heavens and Earth for a moment. At the same time, the surrounding World Energy shook violently.

“What happened?” Qin Zhao Yang turned his face and asked in shock.

Yang Kai’s eyes also flashed brightly and he instantly released his majestic Divine Sense to scan the surroundings. Soon, he looked in a particular direction outside of the city and muttered, “The source seems to be over there. It’s as if something extremely powerful has awakened.”

“Let’s investigate!” Qin Zhao Yang shouted after listening to his words.

Yang Kai was thinking the same and quickly executed his Movement Skill to fly off.

Just after flying out of the Qin Residence, they ran into a beautiful figure who was standing quietly mid-air. It was Ye Jing Han from Thousand Leaves Sect.

The young woman seemed to have not left and kept waiting outside the Qin Residence.

After she saw Yang Kai’s figure, her beautiful eyes lit up and she called out to him, “Grandmaster Yang! Grandmaster Yang!”

“Go away, go away. Don’t block the way!” Yang Kai waved his hand impatiently and flew past her so fast that he was just a black dot in the sky in the blink of an eye.

Ye Jing Han looked at his shadow with gritted teeth, stomping her foot before hurriedly chasing after him.

“Patriarch Qin...” Yang Kai, who was flying in front, glanced back at Ye Jing Han and whispered, “Did this woman tell you why she was looking for me?”

Qin Zhao Yang grinned and answered, “Little Brother Yang is famous, handsome, and in possession of a good cultivation, the very definition of an outstanding man, so isn’t it normal that young girls would be attracted to you?”

After listening to Qin Zhao Yang’s flattery, Yang Kai brushed his hair back, straightened his chest, and slightly lifted his head.

A moment later, his face sank as he spat, “Can we be serious here?”

Qin Zhao Yang shook his head, “She didn’t tell this Old Master clearly, she just said that she needed to talk to you. I saw that this woman was quite pretty, and even though she is a little older than you, she has a tender body and mesmerizing eyes. Little Brother Yang, why don’t you consider listening to her request?”

Yang Kai bulged his eyes and scanned Qin Zhao Yang up and down, as if he needed to examine this person again. After a long examination, he replied, “Patriarch Qin, please behave yourself. It’s inappropriate for an old man to say something like this!”

“HAHAHAHA!” Qin Zhao Yang laughed out loud, patted Yang Kai on the shoulder and spoke in earnest, “You are wasting your youth if you are not indulging. Young man, seize the opportunity!

“Anyway, I don’t think it’s anything good. Don’t pay attention to her!” Yang Kai curled his lips.

During their conversation, numerous other flowing lights had appeared around them. Apparently, they were the Dao Source Realm Masters who were living in Maplewood City and similar to Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang, they were also on their way to check the situation.

“Ah! Yang Kai! You bastard!” An angry voice suddenly came from the side.

Yang Kai turned his head and saw a familiar face staring at him furiously.

This person was the former Maplewood City Vice City Lord, Zhuang Pan!

There was another person beside Zhuang Pan, a good-looking young man with red lips and white teeth. His cultivation was not high, just First-Order Dao Source Realm.

Inexplicably, Yang Kai suddenly felt that this person was a bit familiar, but he was certain that he had never seen him before.

“Yang Kai!” After hearing Zhuang Pan, the eyes of the young man beside him brightened, looking towards Yang Kai with a scorching gaze and asking Zhuang Pan, “So, he is the brat surnamed Yang you mentioned?”

“It’s him, that little rat!” Zhuang Pan gritted his teeth.

“Who are you calling a rat?” Yang Kai looked at Zhuang Pan in contempt and smiled sarcastically.

Zhuang Pan’s face turned red, but he was not stupid enough to step into Yang Kai’s trap, instead just glaring at him with hatred.

“Patriarch Qin, who is this young man?” Yang Kai whispered to Qin Zhao Yang. He saw that although this young man was handsome, he looked sinister. If one were to consider that he was shoulder to shoulder with a villain like Zhuang Pan, Yang Kai knew for sure that he was not anything decent.

“Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master, Ning Yuan Shu!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Young Palace Master?” Yang Kai was shocked, but he quickly figured it out. It seemed that after the death of the former Flying Saint Palace Young Palace Master, someone new had been promoted to take up the position. Since Ning Yuan Shu and Ning Yuan Cheng were biological brothers, it was natural that they looked similar to each other so it was no wonder Yang Kai found him to be familiar just now.

When they were speaking, Ning Yuan Shu ordered Zhuang Pan, “Since it’s him, then there’s no need to be polite. Zhuang Pan, seize him, this Young Master wants to interrogate him.”

After receiving the command, Zhuang Pan turned his head pitifully and said with a frightened stutter, “Young Palace Master, that... well... that is...”

“What? Do it quickly! Do you dare disobey my commands?” Ning Yuan Shu got frustrated looking at him and slapped his face, causing Zhuang Pan’s neck to shrink in fear.

“This subordinate... can’t beat him,” Zhuang Pan answered with a look of grief. After saying it, he was like a deflated ball.

Ning Yuan Shu stared at him with his eyes widened, “He is a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, the same as you. What’s more, Lord Father had trained you personally for three days, why can’t you beat him?”

“Last time I was miserably beaten by him until the spirituality of my artifact had been lost...” Zhuang Pan muttered.

“Waste! What use are you then?!” Ning Yuan Shu was infuriated and kicked Zhuang Pan on his waist. Zhuang Pan screamed in pain, and staggered to the side.

Ning Yuan Shu ignored Zhuang Pan and glared at Yang Kai as he bellowed in a deep voice, “Boy, come over here now!”

He looked egotistic, as if he was the owner of the world and no one would dare to disobey his command.

When the surrounding cultivators heard him, they were startled and immediately put some distance between them and Ning Yuan Shu.

These cultivators were mostly just coming back from the Qin Residence where they had witnessed the earlier scene caused by Yang Kai. All of them knew Yang Kai was not a person who they should mess with, so when they saw Ning Yuan Shu plucking at the whiskers of this tiger, who would dare to stay near him?

Even for those cultivators who had no idea about this, they were quickly being informed by their friends and were made aware of the current situation.

In a heartbeat, all the cultivators in a hundred-metre radius of Ning Yuan Shu vanished.

Ning Yuan Shu was bewildered, but thinking everyone was deterred by his imposing presence, his ego only swelled further, making him truly feel like the first Master beneath the Heavens.

“Patriarch Qin...” Yang Kai made a weird expression and asked, “Why do I hear a dog barking in this wilderness?”

Qin Zhao Yang burst into laughter, “Probably just some wild dogs wandering about, Little Brother Yang doesn’t need to care about it!”

If before, as the Patriarch of a small family, he would not dare to offend Flying Saint Palace. Even though Flying Saint Palace was not a big Sect, there was still an Emperor Realm Master helming it with countless Dao Source Realm cultivators at his command.

The Qin Family’s good days would come to an end if they offended such a great force, as everyone in the Qin Family could be easily slaughtered by a single Second-Order Dao Source Realm Master sent by Flying Saint Palace.

But right now, he was full of gratitude and respect towards Yang Kai, so he was more than willing to offend Flying Saint Palace. Even if it was Star Soul Palace, he would probably still side with Yang Kai.

Both of them spoke loudly, not trying to conceal their voices, so Ning Yuan Shu naturally heard them and flew into a rage.

“How dare you spout such drivel, boy! Do you know who this Young Master is?!” Nin Yuan Shu smiled in anger and shouted at Yang Kai with a sinister face.

Yang Kai then looked at him from the corner of his eyes, “Who the hell are you?”

Ning Yuan Shu looked extremely annoyed and fulminated against him, “Listen carefully, this Young Master is Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master, Ning Yuan Shu!”

“Flying Saint Palace Young Palace Master?” Yang Kai could not help bulging his eyes in fear, “You are the Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master?”

“Indeed!” Ning Yuan Shu felt instantly satisfied after seeing his frightened appearance and put on a wicked smile like that of a poisonous snake.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn and responded in a serious tone, “Sorry, never heard of such a place.”

“You...” Ning Yuan Shu was maddened again after realizing that Yang Kai was toying with him and shouted loudly, “Die!”

As he shouted, he pushed his Source Qi, creating a vortex-like power around his figure as it flickered, leaving behind a number of afterimages as he flew in front of Yang Kai and sent out a palm strike.

“This is your fate for offending me!” He did not forget to sneer as he moved in to attack.

However, his palm strike was destined to accomplish nothing as Yang Kai simply stretched out his hand, intercepted this palm by seizing Ning Yuan Shu’s wrist, and diverted it aside.

Ning Yuan Shu was caught completely off guard and lost his balance, almost crashing into Yang Kai in the process.

When he looked up, his face was only a palm length away from Yang Kai’s, the perfect distance to witness the taunting grin filled with mockery on his opponent’s face.
