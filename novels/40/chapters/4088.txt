Yang Kai was overjoyed, “Can you tell where it is?”

He had heard from Pu Bai Xiong that there were several other Divine Medicines that had assumed human form just like him in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, and Yang Kai was very interested in them. He never thought that he would suddenly enter the territory of another Divine Medicine, and from what Pu Bai Xiong said, this fog was actually a technique of that Divine Medicine!

This was a strange and unpredictable technique, and Yang Kai had no idea what that Little Mushroom that Pu Bai Xiong was talking about was to have such potent abilities.

“Nothing hard about that.” Pu Bai Xiong shook his head, “I visit her place often. Follow me, I’ll take you to see her.”

With a leap, he jumped to the ground and dashed forward. In a few steps, he had already rushed into the mist and disappeared from sight.

Looking back, he laughed, “Smelly brat, if you hadn’t ended up in here, then Uncle Pu would not have known how to deal with you! You just had to end up here obliviously, and now you’ll suffer for it!”

As a Divine Medicine that had assumed human form, it took a lot of effort for him to finally gain a sentience, so how could he be willing to be captured by Yang Kai? The way he cooperated with Yang Kai earlier was all just a ruse; he was waiting for the opportunity to free himself, which had finally come.

“I’ll go and look for Little Mushroom, then I’ll have her trap you here for the rest of your life!” Pu Bai Xiong was feeling proud of himself, “Trying to match wits with Uncle Pu? You’re too naive!”

His legs, which were formed from two roots, ran quickly, and he slipped deep into the mist in just a flash.

It did not take long before he entered a cave where Pu Bai Xiong shouted, “Little Mushroom, are you home?”

His voice echoed in the cave, but he received no answer.

Pu Bai Xiong muttered, “Has that foolish little girl fallen asleep again? Yes, she must be asleep.”

Walking inside, he soon reached the depths of the cave, and at the deepest part, he found a fifteen-centimetre-tall mushroom rooted on spirit soil. The umbrella mushroom undulated faintly, as if it were breathing slowly. Following its motions, endless spores that could not be seen by the naked eye were floating out of its top, filling the air. It was these spores that formed that psychedelic fog earlier that caught Yang Kai in an illusion when he stepped into this place. All kinds of illusions flooded his vision, stopping him from finding his way out.

There was a brilliant light above the umbrella mushroom, flowing beautifully.

Pu Bai Xiong went up to the umbrella mushroom and lifted his hand, formed out of roots, and tapped it, “Little Mushroom, wake up! There’s trouble!”

“Em?” A lazy voice sounded, followed by the opening of a pair of big eyes atop the umbrella mushroom. She seemed to be drowsy and had yet to fully wake up. Glancing at Pu Bai Xiong, she shut her eyes lazily, “Why is it you? Come to disturb my dreams again? Go away, I’m going back to sleep.”

The voice was crisp and tender, like the voice of a young girl.

Pu Bai Xiong whacked her on the head this time, which made her eyes spin, “Before you sleep, do me a favour!”

The big eyes on top of the umbrella mushroom suddenly opened again. Then, they fixed onto a place behind Pu Bai Xiong with panic as She exclaimed, “Pu Bai Xiong, why did you bring someone in here!?”

Pu Bai Xiong jumped in fright and quickly turned around to look, yet he saw nobody behind him, “Little Girl, what are you talking about? There’s nobody behind me!”

“There’s clearly someone there!” The umbrella mushroom screamed. The appearance of the fifteen-centimetre-tall mushroom distorted, and she transformed into a young girl with an umbrella mushroom hat growing atop her head. Her butt fell to the ground and she wailed, “I’m finished, this is the end for me! I’m going to be eaten!”

As she cried, the near-invisible spores gushed into the air madly. Pu Bai Xiong panicked at the sight and shouted, “Don’t cry! If you keep crying, then Uncle Pu won’t be able to stand it! Ekk!? There are so many stars!”

“You can actually see me? En, of course, since this fog is part of your ability, it’s only natural that you can perceive me inside of it.”

A voice suddenly emerged behind Pu Bai Xiong like a ghost. Pu Bai Xiong, whose eyes were filled with illusions, was stunned back into his senses. When he turned around, he saw a ripple behind him where Yang Kai’s figure was revealed.

Yang Kai removed the Shadowless Veil and stowed it away.

The moment Pu Bai Xiong was released from the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai had been on high alert. Sure enough, Pu Bai Xiong did prove himself to be untrustworthy. If Yang Kai had not been following this guy closely, then he might really have let him escape.

“Why are you here?” Pu Bai Xiong was so shocked that his face paled instantly. Then, he laughed to himself, “No, it’s not you, definitely not you! This is an illusion! Wake up, wake up, me!”

The mushroom on the other hand continued to cry, “It’s not an illusion, he’s really here!” Her tears flowed down her cheeks, forming into a dense mist before it could touch the ground.

Pu Bai Xiong turned stiffly to look at the mushroom, “It’s... not an illusion?”

Yang Kai chuckled.

*Pu tong*

Pu Bai Xiong’s roots went soft and he fell to his knees. He looked at Yang Kai with an ingratiating smile while pointing at the mushroom, “Sir, I found you a Divine Medicine! This little girl should be very tasty. You can stew soup out of her!”

“Wah!?!?” The mushroom cried even louder. While crying, she cursed, “Stinky grape! Dead grape! You actually brought someone to harm me! I should have known that you were no good! I’ll fight you!”

Saying so, she pounced on Pu Bai Xiong and threw a barrage of kicks and punches at him.

Pu Bai Xiong naturally resisted. The two Divine Medicine that had assumed human form fought irreconcilably in front of Yang Kai, and soon, they had beaten each other black and blue. Somehow, the two Divine Medicines were moving sneakily towards the entrance as they fought and were just about to pass Yang Kai.

Leaning down, Yang Kai grabbed them with one hand each.

Pu Bai Xiong sniffled and turned his head to the side, pretending that nothing had happened.

The mushroom, however, was frowning as she looked at Yang Kai with a resigned sob.

“It looks just like the real thing,” Yang Kai commented as he looked at the two Divine Medicines in his hands, clicking his tongue in amazement before suddenly shouting, “Break!”

A glow erupted from the Demon Eye of Annihilation, and his vision distorted before the two Divine Medicines in his hands suddenly transformed into two cold, hard stones.

Everything he just saw was just another illusion!

At the same time, he saw Pu Bai Xiong and the mushroom creeping outside like little thieves. At this moment, they had turned around in fear, only to see Yang Kai looking at them with a wide grin.

The mushroom cried out and fell limp on the ground.

Pu Bai Xiong, on the other hand, shouted, “Split up!”

With that, his roots turned speedily as he fled towards the outside.

“Solidify!” Yang Kai instantly froze the surrounding space, locking Pu Bai Xiong in place, unable to move. Only his eyes were still turning around. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Astonishing!” Yang Kai walked step by step over to the two Divine Medicines with his hands folded behind his back. When he entered the fog, he had no idea what he was getting into and had unknowingly fallen for someone’s trick. Later, he found out that the fog had hallucinogenic effects, so he acted more carefully. He kept on relying on the abilities of his Soul-Warming Lotus to clear his mind. If not for that, he would not have been able to follow Pu Bai Xiong all the way here, much less break the mushroom’s illusion.

Such methods were likely difficult for one to defend against, even for the average Open Heaven Realm Master. As expected of a Divine Medicine born in the Primordial Land that had assumed human form. They were indeed extraordinary.

“Don’t commit the same mistake a third time. You’re courting death, you damn grape.” Yang Kai sneered.

He reached out and grabbed Pu Bai Xiong. Staring at the grapes on his head, Yang Kai’s eyes flickered.

Pu Bai Xiong’s face paled, “Sir, I won’t do it again!”

“I’ve heard those words before!”

Pu Bai Xiong put up his fingers and swore to the Heavens, “It’s true this time! This lowly one swears to be honest. This one swears to follow and render his service to Sir!”

“If something like this happens again...”

“You can stew me!” Pu Bai Xiong looked earnest.

Yang Kai nodded and placed him on his shoulder. Then, he turned to look at the mushroom with a pleasant face, “If you wish to turn into a pot of mushroom soup...”

The mushroom quickly said, “This one will follow and render her services to Sir!”

Yang Kai said approvingly, “A promising young woman!”

The mushroom smiled a truly ugly smile through her tears.

After a few simple questions, Yang Kai learned that the mushroom before him was a Profound Multi-Coloured Illusionary Mushroom that had assumed human form. The Profound Multi-Coloured Illusionary Mushroom had only one ability, the creation of illusions, but in this field it was unmatched. If one were to accidentally eat a piece, then one may very well fall into an illusion forever, unable to extricate themselves ever again. After assuming human form, the Profound Multi-Coloured Illusionary Mushroom’s ability to create illusions expanded enormously. During her drowsy moments, she released a large range of spores into the surrounding area simply by instinct.

Yang Kai leaned down to grab the mushroom, placing her on his other shoulder before walking out.

This mist was created by the spores of Little Mushroom, and it was capable of entrapping most living beings in an illusion; however, the illusions did not affect other Divine Medicines such as Pu Bai Xiong. That was how this grape was able to find the sleeping place of the mushroom so accurately. Since she was leaving this place, she naturally retracted the fog covering this area.

As they moved forward, the mist around them became thinner and thinner before turning into countless spores that poured back into the mushroom’s body.

By the time Yang Kai took the two Divine Medicines out of the area, the mist was no longer there.

Where the mist used to exist, there were actually thousands of cultivators lying asleep on the ground. It was apparent that they had accidentally entered this area and were caught in her illusion.

Now that the mist was lifted, it would not take long for them to wake up again. In a sense, it was Yang Kai who saved their lives; otherwise, they would have died in their sleep here.

With Pu Bai Xiong pointing the way, Yang Kai sped up, in search of the Innate Fruit Tree.

The Primordial Land had been open for several days, and more than 200,000 people had gathered. Despite the great opportunities to be found here, this place also came with many dangers. Just the seven-coloured tunnel alone had taken the lives of tens of thousands, most of whom were killed in sneak attacks.

The dandelions that Yang Kai encountered protecting the grape earlier, the strange swamp, and even the Profound Multi-Coloured Illusionary Mushroom’s mist were all deadly existences.

Everything in the world was the same. Great opportunities were always accompanied by great risks. There was no cultivator who did not have to walk through a road of thorns as they ascended the Grand Dao.

Countless had died because of the littlest distraction, and only those with Heavenly luck could make their way to the peak.

A few days later, the grape suddenly spoke once they reached a place, “Sir, not far from here is another Divine Medicine similar to Little Mushroom and I. Does Sir want to procure it?”
