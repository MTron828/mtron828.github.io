Chapter 1412, Emperor Garden’s Mutation

The cultivators from all the great forces residing in and around Heavenly Fate City had been waiting for the moment when the Emperor Garden opened!

No one could explain the scene occurring before their eyes, but there was indeed a possibility that it signified the Emperor Garden opening.

Believing so, everyone could not help feeling agitated, their bodies trembling as they carefully monitored the movements surrounding the Emperor Garden.

Although everyone was excited, no one dared fly up to see what was happening. The aura fluctuations coming from the original location of the Emperor Garden were nothing short of terrifying, so among those gathered, none dared risk their lives to investigate. In the current situation, before anyone could even arrive at the Emperor Garden, they would likely be torn to pieces by the rampaging World Energy.

Even the woman surnamed Ye did not dare move any closer, simply standing in place as her expression fluctuated.

The expressions of Yang Kai, Chang Qi, and the other two old men were equally awed as the four of them stood at the edge of Dragon Cave Mountain’s Mountain Defending Array and stared up into the sky.

Suddenly, a fragrant wind brushed past them as another person appeared by their side. Yang Kai turned his head and, sure enough, discovered Yang Yan standing nearby, looking up into the sky.

“That is not the Emperor Garden opening!” Yang Yan muttered softly with an indifferent expression. Unfortunately, her words were only heard by Yang Kai since the others present had their full attention fixed on the dramatic changes unfolding before them, none of them even realizing that Yang Yan had spoken.

“What is happening then?” Yang Kai asked hurriedly. In the chaos and confusion just now, he had momentarily forgotten that Yang Yan was the Starry Sky Great Emperor’s Soul Clone and should know about the Emperor Garden’s situation.

Since Yang Yan said that this was not a sign that the Emperor Garden was opening, she must have a reason for thinking so.

“I’m not certain, but this is not the Emperor Garden opening. However... it does seem to be related to how one is supposed to enter the Emperor Garden,” Yang Yan’s brow furrowed, not quite sure of herself. This was understandable though as she was not the complete Great Emperor and many of her memories were blurry and unclear.

Yang Kai frowned but did not ask any more.

When she noticed that Yang Yan had appeared, the woman surnamed Ye showed a look of joy and arrived in front of the Mountain Defending Array with a flicker. Gazing respectfully and excitedly towards Yang Yan, this woman was about to say something when Yang Yan stopped her, “We can speak later. For now, just come inside!”

Saying so, Yang Yan waved her hand and sent out a pulse of Saint Qi to open a hole in the light curtain big enough for a single person to pass through.

The woman surnamed Ye blushed slightly as she wore a flattered look before nodding politely and replying, “Yes!”

In the next instant, her tender body flickered and she passed through the Mountain Defending Array, followed closely by Ge Qi who was still wearing the same timid look upon his face as he occasionally glanced over at Yang Yan. His glances didn’t last long though, seemingly worried that, if he stared, he would be blaspheming her with his eyes.

Chang Qi, Hao An, and Ning Xiang Chen finally came to their senses but were immediately dumbstruck as they stared towards the woman surnamed Ye, their faces filled with disbelief.

As the three of them were standing next to Yang Yan the whole time, they had naturally heard how this woman surnamed Ye spoke to her just now.

This made them unable to believe their ears as they exchanged confused glances.

Did they hear wrong? A woman like this, whose strength was astonishing and whose status was immense, when facing Yang Yan, acted like a faithful servant. What exactly was happening here?

Although Yang Kai also felt a little surprised, he was still far better off compared to Chang Qi and the others; after all, he already knew Yang Yan’s true identity. He thus suspected this woman was somehow connected to the true Starry Sky Great Emperor, otherwise, it would have been impossible for her to display such an attitude.

Although he still had some doubts, Yang Kai understood that this was not the time to sort them out and firmly pressed them down, preparing to ask about them when an opportunity arose later.

Glancing over at the buck-toothed cultivator, Yang Kai chuckled and cupped his fists, “Brother Ge, we meet again.”

*Hai hai...*

Ge Qi coughed uncomfortable before quickly lowering his head and insisting, “It’s Xiao Qi, please just call me Xiao Qi.”

Although he had not figured out the relationship between Yang Kai and Yang Yan, he didn’t dare try to act aloof; after all, his Martial Ancestor was humbling herself in front of Yang Yan, so if he did not act humbler, would not that be the same as disparaging his Martial Ancestor?

How could he dare act superior to his Martial Ancestor?

Yang Kai’s brow twitched but he did not object. He was just a Third-Order Saint King while this monkey-faced man was a genuine First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, so although the latter was not very old, calling him Xiao Qi made Yang Kai quite uncomfortable.

After this brief episode, everyone’s eyes once again turned to the Emperor Garden high up in the sky.

The crash of thunder continued endlessly as countless bolts of lightning continued to rampage across the sky, like great dragons swimming through the Heavens, a terrifying scene to behold. At the same time, the Emperor Garden was now completely covered in five-coloured clouds, leaving only its outline visible amongst the innumerable flashes of lightning.

The clouds of Five Element World Energy continued to rapidly gather towards the Emperor Garden.

And this scene did not just appear near Dragon Cave Mountain and Heavenly Fate City, but was actually occurring all over Shadowed Star!

Almost everyone witnessed this grand event with their own eyes, and under the immense pressure this phenomenon released, even Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters felt as weak as ants.

Somewhere on Shadowed Star, there stood a towering mountain over ten thousand metres high with its peak hidden amongst the clouds where rivers of World Energy seemed to ebb and flow. Obviously, there were several excellent Earth Veins that converged here, otherwise, the ambient aura would not have been so dense.

The scenery of this high mountain was also quite beautiful, with rugged rock faces dotted with numerous exquisite pavilions. It was clearly the headquarters of a certain Sect.

Star Emperor Mountain!

This was the most tyrannical existence on Shadowed Star, a behemoth that greatly surpassed even Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect. Although its name resounded like thunder across the world, Star Emperor Mountain always kept a low profile, with few of its members ever even leaving the Sect. As such, it was nearly impossible for Shadowed Star’s ordinary cultivators to see a cultivator from Star Emperor Mountain in their lifetime.

At this moment, in a palace built at the highest point of Star Emperor Mountain, an elderly man with sage-like features and not the slightest energy fluctuations radiating from his body, as if he were a mere mortal, sat cross-legged, looking as tranquil as an ancient well.

When the sudden mutation occurred, however, this elderly man awoke from his meditation and stared towards the direction of the Emperor Garden, a profound light flashing across his eyes that seemingly allowed him to see across all obstacles and observe the Emperor Garden directly.

It took a while before he raised his brow and said to himself, “Are the Emperor Jades about to appear?”

After he finished muttering to himself, a look of joy flashed across the elderly man’s face and he immediately stood up. The moment he got to his feet; a wave of Shi no less intense than the one released by the woman surnamed Ye spread out.

His figure flickering, this elderly man suddenly disappeared from the place he was standing, and when he appeared again, he was already several thousand metres away, where an indifferent-looking young man sat cross-legged on a stone platform, staring transfixed at the clouds of five-coloured aura lingering in the air.

Seeing the elderly man suddenly appear, the young man was startled and hurriedly got up and bowed, “Disciple greets Honoured Master.”

If Yang Kai was here, he would surely recognize this indifferent young man at a glance, it was Leng Qing who he had met twice in the Flowing Flame Sand Field!

After demonstrating his incredible strength and means, this young man had managed to occupy the best location in the pool of Soul Cleansing Divine Water, angering and frustrating Qu Chang Feng. Later, Yang Kai had met Leng Qing face-to-face in the fourth layer of the Flowing Flame Sand Field.

At that time, Leng Qing was attacking the Supreme Profound Sect’s Sect Defending Array.

Of the cultivators on Shadowed Star in the same major realm as him, Yang Kai only cared about two, Lu Ye and Leng Qing.

Although that was said, Leng Qing had already broken through from the Third-Order Saint King Realm to the First-Order Origin Returning Realm.

“En, relay my orders: All Elders are to be dispatched,” The elderly man commanded lightly.

Leng Qing was stunned by this command and hurriedly cupped his fists to ask, “May disciple dare ask Honoured Master what you want the Elders to leave the mountain for?”

The elderly man was not upset by this question and calmly explained, “The Emperor Jades are about to appear, so all Elders are to collect as many as possible. This matter is related to the quotas for entering the Emperor Garden, so they must exert their full effort. Even if they must snatch them from others, they should not hesitate.”

“Yes!” Although Leng Qing was confused, he did not dare ask any more and quickly withdrew.

After Leng Qing left, the elderly man coughed slightly while covering his chest, his face turning slightly pale.

He was injured, but it was a mystery what kind of foe or what kind of profound method could wound a master like him.

“Since the Emperor Jades have appeared, it won’t be long before the Emperor Garden opens. Hateful, it’s all that slut’s fault that I am wounded at such a time!” A fierce look appeared on the elderly man’s face as he grumbled an annoyance.

As for who the ‘slut’ he was talking about was, no one knew.

Near Dragon Cave Mountain, all the gathered cultivators were closely watching the movement of the Emperor Garden.

The strange mutation lasted for more than half a day before suddenly a new change occurred which caused everyone’s spirits to shake and their eyes to widen, drawing in the attention even further.

Everyone saw high up in the sky the five-coloured glow which had engulfed the Emperor Garden fade at a rate visible to the naked eye.

At the same time, the loud rumbling which had filled the air ceased while the rampant flood of Five Element World Energy became tranquil, as if it had never happened.

Everyone stared at the Emperor Garden again in amazement, but in the next moment, they all gasped.

Because the Emperor Garden now looked quite different from before. Not only was it larger, but many new buildings that had not been there originally could also be seen now, as if they had been revealed during the strange mutation which had shaken the world.

This discovery caused everyone to wonder if the recent changes were a good or bad thing.

“Yes, this is the true form of the Emperor Garden...” Yang Yan muttered thoughtfully as she explained, “What we saw before was only half of the Emperor Garden while the other half had been hidden somewhere. Only after the two combined into one could the Emperor Garden truly manifest. En, the Emperor Garden will be soon open!”

After hearing this, Yang Kai turned back to look at her but saw that Yang Yan’s brow was furrowed, as if she was lost in thought.

Right now, the Emperor Garden gave off an even more majestic and profound aura than before, causing everyone present to tremble.

Emperor Pressure!

The power of the Emperor Pressure exuded by the Emperor Garden after its most recent change was truly terrifying, dispelling any thoughts of moving the people gathered here had as they all unconsciously gulped.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
