“Seeking Passion Sect’s Vice Sect Master?” Yang Kai was taken aback. A figure flashed in his mind as he quickly cried out, “Yao Zhuo?”

Bing Yun confirmed, nodding, “That’s right, him!”

Ji Yao, who had been silent all the while, curiously asked, “You know Yao Zhuo?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Kai nodded, “When I came to Ice Heart Valley last, I had some interactions with him.”

Last time he came to Ice Heart Valley, he just happened to arrive for the marriage between Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley. Seeking Passion Sect’s Young Sect Master, Feng Xi, had fallen in love with Zi Yu and tried every means to obtain her. Ice Heart Valley was forced to agree to the marriage under that pressure.

It was Yao Zhuo, who brought Feng Xi to Ice Heart Valley to greet the relatives.

At that time, Yao Zhuo was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm while Yang Kai was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm. There was a huge gap in their strength.

But Yao Zhuo was still injured by the Emperor Authority Bead gifted by Bing Yun to Yang Kai.

Later, Yang Kai even snatched Yao Zhuo’s ring. In that Space Ring were the gifts prepared by Seeking Passion Sect for the wedding, allowing Yang Kai to make a fortune from it.

This happened only a few years ago, so Yang Kai remembered it very vividly. So, when Bing Yun mentioned Seeking Passion Sect’s Vice Sect Master, he of course recalled Yao Zhuo.

On another side, Zhang Sun Yin’s lips moved up and down as she informed Ji Yao about what happened a few years back via Divine Sense Message.

Ji Yao was speechless after hearing the full story and suddenly realized that Yang Kai was an out and out robber. A few years back, he had snatched the Space Ring of a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master when he was just in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, and during his time in the Ancient Wild Lands, he had extorted a lot of wealth from the three remaining Divine Venerables.

He was nothing less than a natural-born thief.

“How did Yao Zhuo suddenly advance to the Third-Order Emperor Realm?” Yang Kai slightly frowned.

Although Yao Zhuo was in the Second-Order Emperor Realm a few years back, breakthroughs, especially in the Emperor Realm, were incredibly difficult, often requiring hundreds, if not thousands of years of effort.

Yet Yao Zhuo had made such quick progress in his cultivation in such a short period of time.

Bing Yun replied, shaking her head, “I also have no idea. Perhaps he came upon some opportunity and made a sudden breakthrough.” She sighed and continued, “Originally, my Ice Heart Valley and Seeking Passion Sect were indeed well-matched in strength, but since Yao Zhou’s breakthrough to the Third-Order Emperor Realm, that balance was broken. I am not a match for Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo together, so naturally Ice Heart Valley was quickly suppressed. Coupled with those recruited by Seeking Passion Sect, Ice Heart Valley has fallen into an absolute disadvantage.”

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgment as he asked, “Then what is Senior planning? You couldn’t be thinking of hiding in the valley forever?”

Bing Yun denied, shaking her head, “I have no plans for the time being. I can only rely on the Sect Defending Array to guard the Sect for the time being.”

“The Sect Defending Array won’t last for much longer,” Yang Kai quickly said.

“Why do you say so?” Bing Yun was taken aback.

Yang Kai explained, “Junior Sister Yao and I ran into a patrol outside Ice Heart Valley upon our return, and according to him, Seeking Passion Sect has invited someone named Grandmaster Nanmen who happens to be proficient in cracking Spirit Arrays. Senior, have you heard of this individual?”

“Grandmaster Nanmen…” Bing Yun furrowed her brow slightly.

An Ruo Yun, on the other hand, cried out in shock, “Nanmen Da Jun!?”

Sun Yun Xiu and Zhang Sun Ying’s pretty faces also turned pale; apparently, they knew about this Grandmaster Nanmen.

Bing Yun cast a questioning gaze at An Ruo Yun, who hurriedly replied, “Honoured Master, Nanmen Da Jun is indeed an Array Master and is a famous figure in the Northern Territory. He is very accomplished in the Dao of Arrays.”

Bing Yun’s pretty face sank as she asked, “What is his background? Does he have a connection with the Seeking Passion Sect?”

She had left the Northern Territory for too long, so she had not heard of Nanmen Da Jun.

An Ruo Yun replied, “He should have nothing to do with the Seeking Passion Sect. As far as this Disciple knows, Nanmen Da Jun was just a commoner who obtained an ancient inheritance related to Spirit Arrays in the past. He is self-taught and does not belong to any Sect or Family. Apparently, because he had suffered greatly and was bullied a lot in his youth, he now only believes in money, not loyalty or people. As long as he is paid well enough, anyone can hire him.”

Sun Yun Xiu agreed, nodding, “But Nanmen Da Jun has always been a hidden dragon, only showing his tail but never his face. I never thought that Seeking Passion Sect could actually find him. They must have paid quite a hefty price.”

Bing Yun also turned serious as she asked, “Yang Kai, is this news true?”

Yang Kai replied, “I have only heard from an outside source. Whether it’s true or not, Senior should just ask herself.”

Saying so, Yang Kai kicked Fang Ming Hui, who was lying on the ground, and stated, coldly snorting, “Get up, if you keep pretending to be dead, I will really kill you!”

Fang Ming Hui, who seemed unconscious, immediately got up with a jolt. His face was pale as he cupped his fasts and greeted, “Greetings, Senior Bing Yun, greetings, beautiful Seniors, this lowly one is Fang Ming Hui, a member of Jade City’s Fang Family. I have nothing to do with Seeking Passion Sect, Seniors, please understand!”

He had woken at some point and had obviously heard most of the conversation, so he knew that the one sitting before him was Bing Yun.

“Did I ask you this? Did I ask you to say this?” Yang Kai went up and started kicking and punching him. While beating him black and blue, he stated, “If you dare to speak more nonsense, I will tear you into ten thousand pieces.”

Fang Ming Hui didn’t even try to protect himself and obediently took the beating, pleading with a crying face, “Sir, I will speak whatever you want me to speak!”

Yang Kai snorted, “Senior Bing Yun has some questions to ask you, honestly answer her; otherwise, you will regret it.”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Fang Ming Hui repeatedly nodded.

Although he had known that his Fang Family’s disciples had all been killed, he couldn’t even think of taking revenge at this moment. Who asked him to be weak, who asked him to actively take part in a battle between two top Sects?

Bing Yun, looking at Fang Ming Hui, asked, “What’s this about Nanmen Da Jun?”

Fang Ming Hui replied, grimacing, “Senior, I am also not that clear about it. This lowly one had just heard a rumour from someone he knows that Sect Master Feng Xuan… I mean, that old bastard Feng Xuan invited Grandmaster Nanmen, who began researching methods to break the Sect Defending Array upon arrival. Supposedly he claimed to need half a month to a month to find an appropriate method. Once the Array was broken, at that time, the hundred thousand cultivators gathered outside will charge into Ice Heart Valley and flatten it.”

“Is that everything you know?” Bing Yun furrowed her brow.

Fang Ming Hui replied, “Senior, please understand! My Fang Family isn’t a strong force and although we have taken refuge with the Seeking Passion Sect, we were only responsible for patrolling the periphery. We really don’t know about such confidential matters, nor have we done anything despicable to Ice Heart Valley.”

Yang Kai added, “He also said that the Seeking Passion Sect had issued a Recruitment Order, promising many benefits to anyone who joined their crusade.”

“I already know about this,” Bing Yun nodded, “Otherwise how could Seeking Passion Sect alone have gathered a hundred thousand people?”

Ice Heart Valley’s disciples numbered less than ten thousand at its peak, and after fighting various big and small battles over the last few years, their numbers had dropped to just around seven thousand. Seven thousand vs a hundred thousand was a difference in numbers that could send anyone in despair, not to mention that the Seeking Passion Sect has also recruited many Masters, while also possessing two Third-Order Emperors.”

Once the Sect Defending Array was broken, Ice Heart Valley would surely fall, and at that time, perhaps only a few disciples would be able to escape with their lives.

The situation was so severe that a gloomy atmosphere filled the hall.

They thought that with the Sect Defending Array, the Seeking Passion Sect could only stare at them but not deliver a fatal blow, but now they came to realize that it was just wishful thinking on their part.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before speaking, “Ice Heart Valley is in this predicament because of me. If I were to…”

Feng Xuan didn’t hesitate to start a war between the two Sects, ignoring the general situation of the Northern Territory, because he wanted to avenge his son, Feng Xi, while it was Yang Kai who killed Feng Xi. Yang Kai felt that if he took the initiative to show his face, he should be able to lure Seeking Passion Sect away. At that time, the danger Ice Heart Valley was facing might be resolved without even needing to fight.

“Impossible!” Before he could finish his sentence though, Bing Yun refuted, shaking her head.

An Ruo Yun, Sun Yun Xiu, Zhang Sun Ying and the others also began to dissuade him.

Bing Yun continued to explain, “Although you may have been the spark that started this conflict, Feng Xuan’s Seeking Passion Sect has been eyeing my Ice Heart Valley since long ago. You also know all about Seeking Passion Sect’s Seeking Passion Supreme Art, and how many Seeking Passion Sect disciples have been cultivating it. On the other hand, my Ice Heart Valley’s disciples are all talented and beautiful, making them the best furnaces to cultivate their Secret Art. Therefore, even if you surrendered yourself to them, Seeking Passion Sect would not stop. Since the things had reached this point, they will settle for nothing less than the total destruction of Ice Heart Valley.”

What she said made sense, drawing a sigh from Yang Kai’s lips.

Bing Yun stood up at that point and said, “Although my Ice Heart Valley is now in dire straits, the Seeking Passion Sect won’t be able to destroy us so easily. Yang Kai, you need not worry about this issue. Since you are here now, stay a few days to rest. Zi Yu, take your Martial Uncle Yang to an appropriate accommodation.”

“Yes!” Zi Yu answered, turning to Yang Kai and saying, “Uncle Yang, this way please.”

Yang Kai nodded, knowing that Bing Yun and the others still had matters to discuss, and that it wouldn’t be appropriate for an outsider like him to be present, he obediently followed Zi Yu.

Leaving the main hall, the beautiful scenery in Ice Heart Valley came into view.

After walking for a while, Zi Yu suddenly pursed her lips and said with a smile, “It was Senior Brother a few years ago, but now it’s Martial Uncle.”

Yang Kai was startled, but soon laughed and said, “If Sister Zi Yu doesn’t mind, let’s speak casually to each other like before.”

When the two met a few years ago, Yang Kai referred to Zi Yu as Junior Sister, but now Bing Yun’s words had raised him a generation higher.

But this was not surprising. Yang Kai got along well with Ji Yao, as if they belonged to the same generation, so with Zi Yu being Ji Yao’s Junior, it was only appropriate that she address him as Martial Uncle now.

Zi Yu shook her head immediately and replied, “I’m afraid I cannot agree to that. If Ancestral Founder were to hear about such disrespectful behaviour, I would certainly be punished.” After a pause, she continued, “Right, I also want to thank Martial Uncle Yang for his assistance in the Shattered Star Sea. If not for Martial Uncle Yang leading those bastards away, Zi Yu is afraid that she wouldn’t have been able to break through so smoothly.”

“It was just a small matter, no need to worry about it,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

The two of them continued chatting until they arrived at a small, exquisite courtyard decorated with red plum trees and snow frost lotuses.

“Martial Uncle Yang, there is no need for you to be polite when you come to Ice Heart Valley, just call if you have any instructions,” Zi Yu showed Yang Kai into the courtyard and said.

“Good, you can return, I’ll be fine here,” Yang Kai nodded.

Zi Yu bowed politely before taking her leave.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked around the courtyard before opening the door to a certain hut, entering, and sitting down cross-legged to meditate and cultivate.
