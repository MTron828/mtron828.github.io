But right then, Feng Xuan’s heart clenched as a sense of anxiety assailed his heart and Soul. It was an intuitive response, one that only became more accurate as one’s cultivation increased.

He looked at Yang Kai with widened eyes, and noticed a solemn look on the other party’s face while he quickly formed some strange hand seals. An inexplicable aura began to spread from Yang Kai, it was so profound and mysterious that it even shocked Feng Xuan. He couldn’t help but want to immerse himself in this domain and try to comprehend it.

[What Secret Technique is this?] Feng Xuan was anxious and doubtful. Although he instinctively felt that something was wrong, he still couldn’t restrain his curiosity and he stared forward with widened eyes, trying to understand what was happening.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai had already finished forming his seals and a mysterious seal floated before him which then flew out with a push of his palms.

“Times Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!” Yang Kai’s reverberating voice resounded in Feng Xuan ear like the calling of death from the deepest depths of Hell.

Feng Xi’s face drastically changed as he shouted in shock, “Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Divine Ability, Time Flies Seal!”

Unlike an ordinary cultivator, Feng Xuan was a Third-Order Emperor, the Sect Master of the Seeking Passion Sect, and a descendant of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor.

As such, his knowledge and experience were extremely rich. As soon as Yang Kai made this move, Feng Xuan recognized it as the famed Divine Ability of Flowing Time Great Emperor. Feng Xuan’s heart beat wildly as his face was covered in shock, his eyes filled with incomparable excitement.

The Flowing Time Great Emperor was the only Master in the Star Boundary’s history to have comprehended the Dao of Time. In hundreds of thousands or even millions of years of history of the Star Boundary, there had been no other.

Throughout the ages, countless Masters had tried to comprehend the Dao of Time, but none even entered the threshold. This alone was proof of the profoundness of this Dao. Feng Xuan believed that with the fall of the Flowing Time Great Emperor, no one in this world would ever comprehend the Dao of Time again.

But now, he actually saw the unique Divine Ability of the Flowing Time Great Emperor on Yang Kai.

Did that mean Yang Kai obtained the inheritance of the Flowing Time Great Emperor? If that wasn’t the case, how could he use the Time Flies Seal!?

For a moment, Feng Xuan was filled with envy and jealousy, but also some slight astonishment. His mood was extremely complicated.

As soon as the Time Flies Seal appeared, Feng Xuan knew that he had underestimated Yang Kai’s strength as he was affected by the strange Principle Strength. Feng Xuan actually felt everything around him slow down.

He knew that this was just an illusion; a misconception born under the effect of the Dao of Time.

Shocked and horrified, Feng Xuan summoned his sword again and poured Emperor Qi into it. Immediately, Sword Qi emerged from the pale blue long sword and Sword Intent soared. There was a solemn look on Feng Xi’s face as the six desires in his eyes vanished and the seven emotions receded.

“Seeking Love Without Indulging in it, just like Seeking Heavenly Way Without Dao! Daoless Emotionless Cut!”

The same Secret Technique, cast by the same body, but with profound differences between them. When Feng Xi displayed this Secret Technique, it was easily broken by Yang Kai’s Space Divine Ability, but when it was displayed by Feng Xuan’s Soul Descend, it literally shook the world.

The horizontal Daoless Emotionless Cut flew across and crashed into the Time Flies Seal, seemingly leaping across the barrier of time and space.

Two completely different Principle Strengths clashed with one another, shattering the space around them.

Deafening rumbles resounded as the shockwave from the impact propagated outwards.

Whether it was Feng Xuan or Yang Kai, both were like lone boats sailing in the sea during a storm, their figures rocking left and right as if they would be toppled at any moment.

The nearby yellow-faced youngster and the middle-aged scholar weren’t fairing any better. Under the corrosion of the two Principle Strengths, their eyes had lost their lustre and their minds grew dull. At the same time, their figures quickly withered and even their hair had turned grey. Everything happened in an instant, but for these two it seemed as if thousands of years had passed.

*Hong hong hong!*

Deafening explosions rang out to no end, but soon Yang Kai was sent flying. In this clash, he actually fell into a disadvantage.

It wasn’t that the Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Divine Ability was worse than the Seeking Passion Sect’s Secret Technique. Rather, it was Yang Kai who was weaker than Feng Xuan.

Seeing this, Feng Xuan’s eyes narrowed as a ferocious look filled his face. His figure jolted as he prepared to use another lethal technique with the remaining energy in his host body.

Although he wanted to capture Yang Kai alive and extract the inheritance and Secret Techniques of the Flowing Time Great Emperor, Feng Xi’s current condition did not allow him to do so.

After hosting a Soul Descent, the damage Feng Xi would suffer would naturally be enormous. Feng Xuan had also forcibly used the Daoless Emotionless Cut. If Feng Xuan continued to entangle with Yang Kai, Feng Xi’s body would fall apart even if he were to triumph.

Feng Xuan was currently feeling remorseful and angry.

Had he disregarded his face and made a move on Yang Kai that day in Ice Moon City, he might not be facing this kind of trouble today. Perhaps he might even have been able to capture Yang Kai and obtain the Flowing Time Great Emperor’s inheritance.

Feng Xuan would then possess the inheritances of two Great Emperors for himself and his goal of ruling the entire Northern Territory would be just around the corner.

“How can you seek love without emotions? How can you pursue Martial Dao without Dao!?” When Yang Kai was pushed back, he suddenly shouted with a hideous look on his face, “Your Seeking Passion Sect is only deceiving itself, hahaha!” He started laughing crazily.

Feng Xuan angrily rebuked, “What does a short-sighted Junior like you know? Die!”

Just as he said this, he swung the sword straight down at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai furiously roared, “You think you can kill this Young Master? You aren’t worthy! Mountains and Rivers Bell, suppress him!”

With a wave of his hand, a bell-shaped artifact the size of a palm suddenly flew out. It was the Mountains and Rivers Bell that Yang Kai had subdued just recently.

Even the Time Flies Seal couldn’t defeat Feng Xuan, so Yang Kai was now only left with the Mountains and Rivers Bell. If even the Mountains and Rivers Bell couldn’t suppress Feng Xuan, Yang Kai would immediately flee.

He believed that even if did suffer heavy injuries, Feng Xuan would still have a difficult time killing him with his mastery of the Dao of Space.

As soon as the Mountains and Rivers Bell appeared, Yang Kai immediately felt his Source Qi and Spiritual Energy being drained rapidly. In a flash, his reserves were completely empty.

Yang Kai was horrified and his face turned pale as his head felt like it was splitting.

This was the first time he had used the Mountains and Rivers Bell, so he was unaware of the hefty price he had to pay.

In the past, when his cultivation was meagre, he had experienced something similar when he had used the Annihilation Thunder Bead, but compared to what he was feeling at the moment, that experience paled in comparison.

At this moment, Yang Kai clearly felt his death approaching.

[Instead of damaging the enemy, this Ancient Exotic Artifact starts aiming for my life. Who knows what it would finally do?]

He braced his spirit and stared at Feng Xi with bloodshot eyes.

Feng Xi’s face drastically changed as he involuntarily blurted out in alarm, “Mountains and Rivers Bell? The Yuan Divine Great Emperor’s Natal Artifact!?”

He was thoroughly shocked this time. He was already amazed when Yang Kai had used his Space Secret Techniques; after all, not everyone could comprehend and cultivate the Dao of Space. Afterwards, Yang Kai had displayed the Flowing Time Great Emperor’s Divine Ability, much to Feng Xuan’s shock. Feng Xuan couldn’t fathom what kind of opportunities Yang Kai had encountered to actually obtain all these treasures that many Masters would trade their lives just to catch a glimpse of.

But at this moment, Yang Kai even summoned the Natal Artifact of the Yuan Divine Great Emperor. Feng Xuan almost bit off his tongue in shock.

[Fake, this must be a fake!]

Feng Xuan screamed in his heart, but his gaze was completely locked onto the tiny bell. The Mountains and Rivers Bell suddenly grew bigger as it rang out. Its knell reached straight into the depths of the Soul, making anyone who listened to it restless. Also, many mysterious patterns and runes began glowing on the surface of the ancient bell while an ancient and desolate aura leaked from it and pervaded the surroundings, giving Feng Xuan a sense of suffocation.

It was really the Mountains and Rivers Bell! This ancient aura could not be imitated!

Feng Xuan’s face instantly turned pale as paper.

Without wasting any more time on thinking, he turned and fled from here.

However, a mystical force suppressed the nearby region, sealing space, so, much to Feng Xuan’s shock and dismay, he was actually unable to move even a bit. Even the Emperor Qi in Feng Xi’s body seemed to be locked inside his meridians, unable to circulate it.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell’s ring could suppress worlds!

When the knells tolled, the suppression began, and no one could escape from it. Even someone proficient in the Dao of Space like Yang Kai would be frozen in place by the Mountains and Rivers Bell, not to mention Feng Xuan.

If this wasn’t the case, this bell would not have been able to suppress the Phoenix True Fire for tens of thousands of years.

As the Mountains and Rivers Bell came down on him, Feng Xuan felt his Soul tremble and he shouted desperately, “Junior, stop! If you dare to kill my son, this King will chase you down to the ends of the world and rip you into ten thousand pieces!”

“Fuck you!” Yang Kai cussed, coughing a mouthful of blood.

*Hong…*

Without any surprise, Feng Xi was directly suppressed under the Mountains and Rivers Bell, completely vanishing from the sigh.

“Ah…”

The yellow-faced youngster and the middle-aged scholar, who were now both old, feeble men, stood trembling in place, their eyes bulging and ready to pop out at any moment in shock.

Yang Kai was just a Dao Source Realm cultivator, but he had actually suppressed their Sect Master’s Soul Descent…

Could a Dao Source Realm really do this? Both of them felt a chill gripping their hearts as they shivered from head to toe.

“Young Sect Master, is he… is he dead?” The yellow-faced old man opened his mouth to speak, but his teeth fell out as he did, making his words muffled.

The same went for the old scholar.

Although the two weren’t hit by the Time Flies Seal directly, they were affected by the Dao of Time and were now far past their prime.

“Cough cough…” Yang Kai kept coughing, looking extremely miserable, but he still managed to slightly flick his finger, shooting a burst of Source Qi into the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

*Hong…*

The bell rang once again, releasing a terrifying shockwave.
