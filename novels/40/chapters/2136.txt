A battle between dragons and tigers ended due to the intervention of an Emperor Realm Master.

“Is this all right now?” Xiao Yu Yang, who was at the station of Star Soul Palace, looked at Gao Xue Ting and Chen Wen Hao and asked.

Gao Xue Ting replied, “Thank you, Senior Xiao!”

Chen Wen Hao also nodded lightly.

Even though the rising stars of the two Sects did not have a pleasant encounter, it did not affect the relationship between the Emperor Realms of both Sects. To them, it was just some youngsters being competitive with each other.

Who had not been through this phase before?

“It’s okay, but these two kids are really hyperactive.” Xiao Yu Yang chuckled.

“Elder Gao has Xia Sheng under her while Brother Chen has Wu Chang under him, I envy them so much!” Feng Ming suddenly spoke bitterly from the side.

Gao Xue Ting glanced at him and asked, “Isn’t there a Zhuang Bu Fan in your Orthodoxy Temple?”

Feng Ming smiled, “Although Bu Fan’s name means extraordinary, he has only an ordinary physique. How can he be compared with these two kids?”

“Didn’t Brother Feng already pass down the Reverse Heaven and Earth Phantom Trick of your noble Temple?” Chen Wen Hao looked at Feng Ming and said, “Why so humble? Too much humility is hypocrisy.”

“Heh heh...” Feng Ming grinned and responded with a smiley face.

“It’s enough, will you stop testing each other?” Xiao Yu Yang could not help but roll his eyes, “It’s a good thing that the little kids are being active, but remember, the elders better just observe and not interfere. We are all from the Southern Territory, so I don’t wish for infighting!”

“What Senior Xiao said is right!” Everyone nodded together.

“Oh yeah, Senior Xiao...” Gao Xue Ting suddenly said, “Regarding the matter that the three of us asked when we went to the Star Soul Palace last time... is there any response?”

Hearing this, the faces of Feng Ming and Chen Wen Hao turned solemn and focused on listening.

Xiao Yu Yang frowned. After pondering for a while, he said, “About that Ancient Great Demon... The Great Emperor said that the demon hasn’t perished yet, but is only hibernating. However, the Great Emperor has no idea of its exact location.”

“Even the Great Emperor doesn’t know?” Feng Ming’s expression changed.

“The Great Emperor only told me eight words!” Xiao Yu Yang quickly said.

“What eight words?” Gao Xue Ting wondered.

“Seems dead but alive, alive but seems dead!”

“What does this mean?” Feng Ming was puzzled by the words.

Xiao Yu Yang shrugged his hands, “I don’t understand either. But relax, the Ancient Great Demon has been sealed for so many years, so its Divine Ability is no longer like in the past. If he dares to show up and do evil in the future, this King will slay it with his own hands.”

“With the words of Senior Xiao, we are not worried.” Chen Wen gave out a sigh of relief and nodded.

Last time, Feng Ming, Gao Xue Ting and he teamed up against the Ancient Great Demon. Unfortunately, they had failed at the last minute, as the Ancient Great Demon performed a terrifying Divine Ability and trapped them in a dark and boundless world. By the time they escaped it, the demon was long gone. In desperation, they went to the Star Soul Palace to request a meeting with the Bright Moon Great Emperor in hopes of receiving some guidance from the Great Emperor.

Regrettably, the three of them went to the Star Soul Palace but did not manage to meet the Great Emperor. In the end, they could only tell Xiao Yu Yang and let him pass on the message for them.

That was why the first thing that Gao Xue Ting did was to find Xiao Yu Yang as soon as she got here, in order to find out about the demon.

“Okay, let’s not think about the matter of the demon for now. Let’s talk about the Four Seasons Realm this time.” Xiao Yu Yang said.

When everyone heard it, they knew that he was going to talk about the matter of the Star Seal, and their faces immediately turned serious.

...

At the station of the Azure Sun Temple, Yang Kai, who was meditating crossed leg and recuperating, had his expression changed suddenly, opened his eyes and looked in a certain direction.

He frowned, pondering for a while, then he stood up and walked in that direction.

“Junior Brother Yang,” Murong Xiao Xiao hurriedly shouted when she saw him, “where are you going?”

She was like a burnt child that dreaded fire. She initially just wanted to hang out with her friends at the side of Star Soul Palace, but did not expect to trigger a storm and caused Xia Sheng to get detained. She was secretly blaming herself.

At this moment, seeing that Yang Kai was about to leave the station, she asked with concern.

“Just walking around!” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Then, you have to be careful,” Murong Xiao Xiao exhorted but did not stop him.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and continued to walk forward.

“Why do you care about the outsider’s life?” Xiao Bai Yi unpleasantly snorted beside her.

Murong Xiao Xiao responded, “Junior Brother Yang came with us after all.”

“You still call him Junior Brother?” Xiao Bai Yi glared at Murong Xiao Xiao, “He is not our temple’s disciple!”

Murong Xiao Xiao stuck out his tongue and said, “Senior Brother Xiao, do you particularly dislike him?”

“It’s not that I dislike him.” Xiao Bai Yi coldly snorted, “Just that he is not pleasing to my eyes!”

Murong Xiao Xiao shook her head slowly without saying much.

On the other side, Yang Kai kept going until he walked out of the mountain valley and came to a dense forest before stopping.

The breeze was whispering and the leaves rustled.

Yang Kai sighed and asked, “Since you called me over, why don’t you show up yourself?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he heard a chuckle. A pretty figure appeared on top of a tree, looking down at him with a pair of beautiful eyes filled with curiosity.

She stared at Yang Kai, clicked her tongue and said, “I did not expect you to be promoted to Dao Source Realm in such a short time. A master from a low-level Star Field indeed has an extraordinary aptitude!”

Yang Kai looked at her with his head lifted, and chuckled, “Protector Bian, it’s been a long time!”

The woman who quietly transmitted her voice to him previously and told him to meet here was astonishingly one of the four guardians of the Blue Feather Sect, Bian Yu Qing!

It was this woman who took him into the Blue Feather Sect at that time.

And the Blue Feather Sect was also Yang Kai’s first stop in Star Boundary!

Bian Yu Qing knew some of his details and understood that he was a cultivator from a low-level Star Field. It was precisely for this reason, Bian Yu Qing accepted him into the Sect. Otherwise, with Yang Kai’s cultivation only being a Second-Order Origin King at that time, Bian Yu Qing would not be interested in him at all.

This woman had the cultivation of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm!

Meeting Bian Yu Qing again reminded Yang Kai about Liu Xian Yun who was with him at that time. This girl was like him, coming from a low-level Star Field, a place named Grand Desolation Star Field, and was also taken into the Blue Feather Sect by Bian Yu Qing.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun were separated when they fled from a calamity.

After such a long time, Yang Kai had no idea about how Liu Xian Yun had been.

“It’s remarkable that you still remember this Queen, which makes this Queen very gratified.” While he was still pondering, Bian Yu Qing smiled. With a slight effort of her feet, she gradually landed in front of Yang Kai, like a goddess descending from the sky.

“The great grace of Protector Bian was carved on this little brat’s heart, how can it be forgotten?” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Although Bian Yu Qing took him in the Blue Feather Sect with an ulterior motive, this woman did not abuse him or treat him harshly. Of course, she did not deliberately care for him either, so Yang Kai just treated her with an indifferent attitude. Even though he sounded grateful, he did not mean it at all.

Bian Yu Qing looked at him, “You are good at lying through your teeth! If you really remember the kindness of this Queen, why did you come over so reluctantly?

“That’s not true!” Yang Kai showed an innocent face, “It’s just that I didn’t expect to meet Protector Bian here.” After a pause, he spoke, “Protector Bian is not alone, right?”

He glanced at the side while speaking.

Bian Yu Qing raised her eyebrow and said unexpectedly, “You, little brat, are sharp.”

She waved to her side, “Don’t hide anymore, come out.”

After her words, the laughter from a man was heard, “Haha, Junior Brother Yang. After a long time, you still look great!”

Yang Kai looked aside with a smile, and cupped his fist, “Senior Brother Kou!”

Surprisingly, that person was Kou Wu, a confidant of Bian Yu Qing. Kou Wu was the first Dao Source Realm Master that Yang Kai saw after coming to the Star Boundary and also the guy who caught him and Liu Xian Yun and sent them to Bian Yu Qing.

But unlike Bian Yu Qing who was apathetic, Kou Wu still took a little care of Yang Kai during that period, so Yang Kai had a good impression of him.

“This Kou is surprised that Junior Brother Yang is already in the Dao Source Realm,” Kou Wu scanned Yang Kai up and down with an amazed expression.

When he first met Yang Kai, Yang Kai was just a Second-Order Origin King, who knew nothing about Star Boundary. He did not understand how Yang Kai could get to the same level as him in just a short time.

No wonder it was said that the cultivators from the low-level Star Fields have outstanding aptitude and extraordinary potential. He did not believe it much before, but after seeing Yang Kai, he started to believe it.

“It’s just a fluke.” Yang Kai answered casually. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What amazed this Queen even more is that you have become the disciple of Azure Sun Temple? It seems that Azure Sun Temple has put in a lot of effort into you!” Bian Yu Qing smiled faintly.

Previously, when she was watching the show between Xia Sheng and Wu Chang, she accidentally saw Yang Kai’s presence, so she privately transmitted a voice message to him, to meet her outside.

Yang Kai was resting at the station of Azure Sun Temple, and she naturally thought that Yang Kai had joined Azure Sun Temple. If so, it would make sense to her that he could swiftly be promoted to Dao Source Realm.

Blue Feather Sect, a small Sect that didn’t even have one Emperor Realm, was incomparable to a well-resourced Sect like Azure Sun Temple.

“Protector Bian had misunderstood,” Yang Kai shook his head. “I’m not from Azure Sun Temple.”

“Do you think this Queen is blind?” Bian Yu Qing glared at Yang Kai ferociously.

Yang Kai said, “I just came here together with the people from Azure Sun Temple for some reasons, believe it or not.”

“Really?” Bian Yu Qing was stunned at his words. She was astonished, but she felt that Yang Kai did not have any reason to deceive her on this matter, so she stopped asking anymore.

“As for me, I’m really curious about which great force are Protector Bian and Senior Brother representing here?” Yang Kai looked at the two of them suspiciously.

Kou Wu answered, “Of course it’s Blue Feather Sect!”

“Both of you are still in the Blue Feather Sect?” Yang Kai’s expression changed and he immediately thought of the Sect Master of Blue Feather Sect, Wu Meng Chuan.

This guy was the descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. When he was being released from Bone Prison by Yang Kai during the last time, he turned the entire Blue Feather Sect upside down. Miao Qi, Tong Chong and Zhu Jun Shan, the three great guardians of the Sect were no match against him and were slain on the spot.

Luckily Bian Yu Qing was out of the Sect during that time, and she was the only one who escaped this calamity.
