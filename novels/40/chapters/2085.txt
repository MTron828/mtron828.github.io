Yang Kai smiled, though he did not give any reply. Instead, he turned towards the old swindler. In a flash, he appeared beside the man. Extending his leg, Yang Kai kicked him. “Don’t act dead. Hurry and stand up.”

“Sir, I’ve just suffered a miserable beating. I beg of you to uphold justice and punish those evildoers!” Lying on the ground, the old swindler wore a look of misery as he gazed at Yang Kai, tears streaming from his eyes and mucus flowing from his nose as he started to complain. “Sir, if you’re unable to teach them a lesson, this old master will not stand up.”

“Then you can continue talking while lying down then.”

A look of speechlessness immediately appeared on the old swindler’s face.

Squatting down, Yang Kai cast a deep gaze at the man as he asked in a deep voice, “Let me ask you. How did you end up outside in the Demon Qi?”

Walking over, Qin Zhao Yang grinned as he looked towards the old swindler. “This Qin is also very curious about this matter.”

Being stared at by two great Dao Source Realm Masters caused an involuntary tremble to run through the old swindler as he hastily answered, “These two sirs, is there some kind of misunderstanding? I’m here to ask for reinforcements from Maplewood City.”

“Reinforcements?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, while a pensive look appeared on Qin Zhao Yang.”

“I came from Forest City.” The old swindler replied.

Yang Kai could not help but frown.

“Forest City is 3000 kilometres away from Maplewood City. It is a smaller city than Maplewood city, and the average realms of its cultivators are lower.” Qin Zhao Yang added before his expression suddenly changed as he continued in a solemn voice, “Could it be that Forest City has already...”

“Forest City is in danger, two sirs!” An anxious look appeared on the old swindler’s face. Nevertheless, after looking to his left and right, he sighed and said, “From the looks of it, Maplewood City is also in danger. What can we do?”

“What’s the current situation in Forest City?” Qin Zhao Yang asked as an ugly look set in on his face.

“Extremely bad. It is surrounded by Demon Qi and demonic creatures, just like Maplewood City, and you sirs should know what kind of city Forest City is. It probably can’t hold on much longer. Furthermore... there seems to be a Demon over at Forest City that has probably reached the Dao Source Realm!”

“Jiang Tai Sheng!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“The Jiang Family’s old ancestor?” Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed drastically.

Yang Kai nodded his head and said: “That’s why I didn’t spot any traces of Jiang Tai Sheng at all. When I headed out just now, I kept a constant guard against this person in fear that he would suddenly appear to launch a sneak attack against me, yet he did not appear at all. So he was not in Maplewood City, but had headed to Forest City. Obviously, he is trying to use the Demon Qi to create more Demons.”

“That is a possibility. Furthermore, the chances of that happening are extremely high!” Qin Zhao Yang’s face turned ashen in shock. “Although Forest City isn’t large, there’s still a few hundred thousand people present in it. If all of them were to be corroded into Demons...”

After saying this, a scene surfaced within his mind, causing an involuntary shiver down his spine.

“Did you all request for help from any place other than Maplewood City?” Yang Kai questioned.

The old swindler nodded his head and replied, “Of course we did. However, Maplewood City is the closest city to us. Furthermore, this old master is extremely familiar with Maplewood City, so I volunteered to come here. If I had known that I’d get into trouble, I wouldn’t have come over here.”

“It’s all due to your actions!” Yang Kai shot a dark look at him.

The old swindler gave an embarrassed smile. “I’m just lucky, just lucky. Furthermore, if not for sir attracting such a large number of demonic creatures, it would have been impossible for me to enter the city safely.”

With a smile, Yang Kai nodded slightly, before shouting out, “Make sure to take good care of this old swindler, better not let him run away!”

As he said those words, he suddenly extended his hand to touch the old swindler’s body. The power of domain circulated, entering the old swindler’s body and sealing his cultivation.

The old swindler was dumbstruck by this series of events!

Even Qin Zhao Yang seemed to not expect Yang Kai’s sudden hostility, causing him to be stunned for a moment.

A flash of radiance surfaced within Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes as she stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, not knowing what he was planning to do.

“Sir, you...” The old swindler stared at Yang Kai with his wide open eyes, while misery and pity set onto his face.

“Take him away!” Noticing the surrounding cultivators just standing around, Yang Kai promptly shouted out with a stern tone.

It was only after his shout that two guards from the City Lord’s Mansion stepped forward. Holding the old swindler by his arms, they proceeded to fly off in the direction of the City Lord’s Mansion. It seemed that they were planning on locking him up in the prison there.

“This is a misunderstanding, Sir! I’m only here to ask for reinforcements! I’m on your side! Sir, you can’t treat me like this!” The old swindler started to cry and weep, as he gradually disappeared into the distance!

“Little Brother Yang, you aren’t going to lock that person up just because he frequently swindles others, right? Or is there a deeper reason for this?” Qin Zhao Yang shot a pensive look at Yang Kai as he asked.

Qin Yu was also brimming with curiosity towards this matter.

“Of course not.” Yang Kai shook his head. “However, with only a Third-Order Origin King cultivation realm, this person was actually able to pass through the Demon Qi blockade safely. There’s some kind of secret hidden in his body, and I’m very interested in that.”

“Does Little Brother Yang want to extract this secret from him?” Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes lit up.

Origin King Realm cultivators weren’t lacking in Maplewood City at all. If all of them had the ability to travel through the Demon Qi with ease, there would have been no need to be as terrified as they were. Everyone would have been able to head out of the city and kill every single one of those demonic creatures.

“That old thing seems to be crafty and cunning, so it might not be an easy task to discover his secrets. Besides, even if he reveals it to us, not everyone might be able to use it... in any case, we’ve done everything we can do.” Yang Kai replied in an indifferent tone.

“That’s right!” Qin Zhao Yang nodded his head, agreeing with Yang Kai’s words. Pointing towards Jiang Chu He, whose cultivation had been suppressed but was still roaring away endlessly, he asked, ”Little Brother, how should we deal with this person?”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Jiang Chu He. “I captured this fellow to try and extract some information about the outside. However, with his condition right now...”

He could not help but to let out a bitter laugh.

Jiang Chu He already seemed to have lost all conscious thought. How could Yang Kai gather any information from him? The only method would be for someone to risk the possibility of a backlash and use a soul searching type of Secret Technique on him.

However, to utilise such a Secret Technique, it would require the user to have a cultivation realm much higher than the target. If not, the risk of suffering a backlash from Jiang Chu He’s rage-filled demonic consciousness would be extremely high.

Even within Maplewood City, the highest cultivation realm anyone else had was the Second-Order Dao Source Realm; it was simply unsuitable for this task.

Although Yang Kai’s Divine Sense could rival a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, he did not know any Soul Searching Arts. Even if he were to forcefully utilise one, he might not necessarily obtain any useful information

“If that’s the case, perhaps my humble self might be able to offer some assistance.” Qin Yu suddenly spoke up.

“You?” Yang Kai looked towards Qin Yu with a stunned and confused look. He was afraid that he might have heard wrongly, as from what he could see, Qin Yu’s Second-Order Origin Returning Realm was present right before him.

“Yu’er!” However, as though some great enemy had appeared, Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed drastically as he roared out sternly. “Stop fooling around!”

With a smile, Qin Yu replied, “ Old Ancestor, Yu’er isn’t fooling around. Of course, with Yu’er’s cultivation, I naturally can’t deal with Jiang... use my Secret Technique on this demon. However, with the aid of the Spirit Array, Old Ancestor and Senior Yang, we might be able to give it a try!”

Yang Kai’s brows twitched after hearing her reply. Taking a deep look at Qin Yu, he said, “Our first meeting was in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. At that time, this one had already felt that Sister Qin was an extraordinary person. Now, it seems like that is indeed the truth!”

“Thanks for the praise, Senior Yang,” Qin Yu smiled gently. “This humble girl’s too weak and fragile, so how can I stand up to your praise? As for Sir, you’ve managed to reach the Dao Source Realm at such a young age and have an immeasurably long future ahead of you. You truly fill this humble girl with admiration for you.”

“Old Sir Qin,” Yang Kai asked as he turned towards Qin Zhao Yang. “Do the ladies in your family always speak like that?”

Qin Zhao Yang laughed and replied, “Little Brother Yang, if you’re interested, you can come to my Qin Family to choose a few. There are quite a few unmarried girls in my Qin Family, so there is bound to be one that will catch your eye, Little Brother.”

Yang Kai’s face turned black, “You really know how to joke, Old Sir Qin.”

Qin Zhao Yang smiled. “This old master isn’t joking.”

Yang Kai gave a light cough to change the subject. Looking at Qin Yu, he said, “Sister Qin, you have to know that there is a sizable disparity between your cultivation realm and Jiang Chu He’s. If you don’t have the confidence, don’t dive recklessly into danger. If not, it would not be good if something untowards happened to you.”

“Many thanks, Senior Yang, for your concern. This little girl is naturally acting within one’s reaches,” Qin Yu nodded gently with a tranquil and calm look on her face. “This little girl still has some level of confidence.”

“That’s good to hear.” Yang Kai nodded and no longer attempted to dissuade her.

No one dared to play a joke with their own lives. Since Qin Yu said that she was confident, she definitely had her reasons. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What about you, Old Sir Qin?” Yang Kai asked as he turned towards Qin Zhao Yang.

A solemn look hung on Qin Zhao Yang’s face. After remaining silent for quite a while, he raised his head and looked at Qin Yu. “Yu’er, there’s really no need for you to do this. After all, this tribulation is something that the entire Maplewood City must face. If worse comes to worst, we can beseech City Lord Sir to take the risk and use the Soul Searching arts!”

Qin Yu replied, “As of right now, Sir City Lord is responsible for the entire city’s safety. If something really happens to him, the entire Maplewood City will be finished. That’s not the case for Yu’er. Even if something happens to me, it will not affect the general situation! Old Ancestor, the absolute majority of our Qin Family is in the city. If the city falls, our Qin Family will definitely fall! I wish to do something for our family!”

“You... sigh...” A look of speechlessness washed over Qin Zhao Yang’s face, as he did not know how to persuade her to back down.

On the contrary, Yang Kai’s expression changed to one of surprise as he looked at Qin Yu. He did not expect that a little girl like her would actually be able to take the big picture into consideration.

“However, before we start anything, this little girl still has something to ask Senior Yang.” All of a sudden, a smile appeared on Qin Yu’s face as she turned her head towards Yang Kai.

“What is it?”

Qin Yu’s lips twitched, though no sound rang out.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, thought silently for a moment, before gently nodding his head.

A look of delight replaced her smile as Qin Yu clapped her hands. “If that’s the case, then Yu’er has about an 80% chance to succeed. Furthermore, I only need Senior Yang’s help. Old Ancestor, you can stay here and continue defending the city.”

“You don’t need this old master?” Qin Zhao Yang asked in surprise.

Qin Yu smiled and replied, “Senior Yang’s is extraordinary after all.”

Heaving a sigh, Qin Zhao Yang said, “Since that’s the case, then this old master has nothing much left to say. However, since this matter concerns the entire Maplewood City, this old master will still have to inform Sir City Lord before proceeding. Furthermore... we have to inform City Lord Duan about the matter of Forest City, so you all need to wait a short moment.”

As he said those words, he took out his communication artifact. Sending his Divine Sense into it, he proceeded to inform all the Dao Source Realm Masters about the matters of the Forest City and Jiang Chu He, and more importantly, pass the information to Duan Yuan Shan.
