Chapter 986, Elder Sister Will Protect You

Amidst the Starry Sky, Yang Kai continued wandering about.

It had been some time since he had separated from He Zao and He Miao, but he had not made any progress finding a way out.

One day, as Yang Kai was drifting aimlessly once again, three auras suddenly appeared to his rear. These auras were fierce and contained a thick aggressive intent, causing Yang Kai to suddenly feel as if there were needles pricking his skin.

It wasn’t He Zao and He Miao!

From what Yang Kai could infer, the three people approaching him from behind were all Third Order Saints!

Their auras made Yang Kai feel quite unhappy as well as a little vigilant, as if he wasn’t being followed by three people but three bloodthirsty beasts.

[Avoid or wait?] The two contradictory thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, but he quickly decided on the latter, bringing his Star Shuttle to a halt.

The other three had obviously discovered him, otherwise, they wouldn’t be acting so obviously. If he was to try to avoid them now, it would only result in them chasing him down.

Yang Kai wasn’t sure that his Star Shuttle was fast enough for him to outrun them.

Most importantly though, was that he had finally met a second group of people, presenting him with an opportunity to escape this situation. If he could obtain a copy of their Star Chart, it would naturally be best.

He Zao had said that as long as one had a proper Star Chart, they would have a chance to leave this Chaotic Abyss, and although that chance wasn’t great, it was still worth a try.

Facing three Third Order Saints, Yang Kai estimated that even if it really turned into a fight, with his current strength, if he went all out, it shouldn’t be too dangerous.

As such, he was not afraid.

Three streaks of blue light rushed across the Starry Sky, drawing long cyan trails behind them as they rapidly closed in on Yang Kai’s position.

Shortly after, in a flash of light, three figures appeared in front of Yang Kai.

Each of these three people had their own Star Shuttle, unlike He Zao and He Miao, who were sharing one. This demonstrated that whoever these three were, they had significant financial resources.

There were two men and one woman. One of the men was tall and strong with a stoic look while the other man was thin and short, a cynical smile adorning his face. The thin man was playing with a silver-coloured dagger in his hand as a cold light flashed across his eyes from time to time, staring towards Yang Kai with obvious ill intentions.

As for the woman, she possessed an enchanting figure and a pair of lustrous eyes that she used to examine Yang Kai with great intensity, a look of interest soon surfacing on her face.

When they appeared, Yang Kai knew that his concerns were correct. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not everyone out here was as reasonable as the two sisters, He Zao and He Miao. At first glance, it was obvious that these three weren’t good things; if he didn’t act appropriately, the consequences would be bad.

“Little brat, where are you from?” The burly man stared at Yang Kai coldly and asked in a commanding voice. From his tone and demeanour it was obvious he was completely indifferent to Yang Kai’s existence, as if he could freely control whether he lived or died.

“From a lower world,” Yang Kai carefully considered his words as he replied, “I’ve been lost here for a long time, unable to find my way out. If it’s convenient, can I borrow your Star Chart to make a copy?”

These were the words He Zao had said to him before, and although he didn’t know how to copy a Star Chart, Yang Kai figured it wouldn’t be difficult to figure it out once he got hold of a Star Shuttle with one.

“Copy our Star Chart?” The man grinned deviously at these words before nodding mockingly, “Fine, but you have to answer my question honestly first.”

“What do you want to know?” Yang Kai didn’t display any joy on his face because he could feel that this person wasn’t being earnest with him.

As soon as the burly man had agreed to his request, the thin man nearby had stretched out his tongue and licked the dagger in his hand, his eyes flashing a barely concealed killing intent.

Yang Kai figured that the moment he answered this question, the skinny man would immediately attack. The other party had never even considered allowing him to borrow their Star Chart.

“You said you’ve been lost here for a long time, yes? Did you ever meet a pair of girls? En, they would have been wearing white robes with a sword-shaped symbol embroidered on their chests.”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed, immediately understanding that he was asking about He Zao and He Miao.

In his mind, a flash of light went off as he suddenly remembered that the first time he met the pair of sisters, He Miao had mentioned something about him being sent by ‘those people’, obviously they were being pursued by someone.

Could it be that the three people in front of him were the ones chasing them?

Yang Kai’s brief contemplation revealed a slight flaw which the burly man’s eyes didn’t miss, causing him to approach closer and shout, “You’ve met them, right?”

“Why are you looking for them?” Yang Kai didn’t answer right away.

“Boy, that’s not something you need to know, just answer my question and you’ll receive some benefits. Of course, if you are unwilling to answer, I don’t mind forcing you to cooperate,” The skinny man laughed maliciously, staring at Yang Kai like a vicious snake.

With denying at this point being meaningless. Yang Kai simply nodded, “Yes, I’ve met them.”

“When did you meet them, and where are they now?” The burly man eagerly asked, as if He Zao and He Miao were incredibly important to them.

“I don’t know the exact time, probably about a month ago, they were resting on an asteroid. I stopped to ask them for direction,” Yang Kai put on an honest expression.

“A month ago? What kind of asteroid was it? Where was it located?”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, “I can’t remember!”

“Waste!” The burly man shouted, anger spreading across his face.

A cold light flashed across the depths of Yang Kai’s eyes.

“Liu Shan, why bother getting angry at him...” The enchanting woman smiled and said, putting on an inviting expression as she stepped forward, swaying her hips rhythmically, emphasizing her wondrous curves, “A little fellow like him who lost his way here, what more could he possibly know? At the very least, we can be sure that those two sluts are still here.”

Saying so, she turned to look at Yang Kai and called out, “Little boy, you don’t need to be afraid, Elder Sister just wants to ask you a few things. Were those two also lost when you met them?”

When he heard her voice, it was like an invisible hand was stroking his heart, causing Yang Kai’s blood to boil and his primitive instincts to flare up.

A Seduction Technique!

Yang Kai’s heart grew even colder as he suppressed the imbalance in his body while putting on a slightly dazed look and replying, “Yes, they were also lost, I heard them say that their Star Chart was damaged.”

Yang Kai’s performance made the beautiful woman quite satisfied and caused her to shoot a triumphant look towards the big man named Liu Shan; however, the big man seemed to deeply disdain this woman’s methods while simultaneously looking down on Yang Kai even further, believe that this youth had too easily fallen for this beauty’s little tricks.

“Haha, it’s good that they’re lost!” The skinny man cackled.

“Kill him, since he doesn’t know where those two sluts are, he’s of no use to us,” Liu Shan waved impatiently.

A cold aura suddenly burst from the skinny man, seemingly quite eager to attack Yang Kai.

“No need to be so anxious!” The beautiful woman quickly interceded.

“You want him? Don’t forget that we’re still in the middle of a mission, after we finish up here, you can have as many men as you like,” Liu Shan calmly stated.

“What about if I wanted you??” The beautiful woman threw a wink towards Liu Shan.

“Stop, I don’t want to have anything to do with you, I quite enjoy the feeling of being alive.” Liu Shan coldly snorted, not feeling the slightest bit of temptation.

“Then don’t kill him, a young Saint Realm man isn’t something easily obtained, isn’t it too wasteful to just kill him?” The beautiful woman narrowed her eyes next and seriously remarked, “Moreover, we’ve just obtained some important intelligence, shouldn’t we hurry back and report to the higher-ups? Could it be that you want to continue exploring this place? Do you think it’ll be easy to located two people in this vast region?”

Liu Shan hesitated for a while before nodding, “Fine, this time we’ll go along with you, we truly should go back and report about this!” He didn’t seem to want to annoy this beautiful woman and thus finally compromised.

“Little boy, come along with Elder Sister. Elder Sister will protect you, as long as you stay with me, no one will hurt you,” The beautiful woman eagerly beckoned to Yang Kai.

“Thank you,” Yang Kai’s mouth curled into a grin as he continued, “I actually want to work with you; the truth is I have a grudge with those two sluts.”

“Oh? What kind of grudge?” The beautiful woman stared at him with interest, even Liu Shan and the skinny man were somewhat curious.

“They apparently used up all their Saint Crystals and pills, so they robbed me of mine,” Yang Kai said with an angry look.

The beautiful woman covered her mouth as if she was appalled while Liu Shan and the skinny man swept Yang Kai quickly with their Divine Senses and confirmed that he didn’t have any storage artifacts on his body.

They knew what kind of cultivations He Zao and He Miao had. Yang Kai, as a First Order Saint, would certainly not be their opponent.

Therefore, Yang Kai’s remarks didn’t arouse any suspicions.

“Wait until we find them, then we’ll let you dispose of them,” The beautiful woman took Yang Kai’s arm into her own as she exhaled a hot breath into his ear, her luscious chest tightly wrapping Yang Kai’s elbow as her tender body pressed up against him.

“Really?” Yang Kai said in a pleasantly surprised voice as an obscene look appeared on his face.

“Really, when the times comes, we’ll torture them together!” The beautiful woman smiled and nodded, “I most enjoy handling this kind of thing.”

The skinny man put on a mocking look as he sneered, “Of course, the premise is that you live until then. Kid, if I were you, I’d choose to be killed right now rather than going back together with her.”

“Liu Sha, even if you don’t speak, no one will mistake you for a mute,” The beautiful woman glared wickedly towards the skinny man.

Liu Sha shrugged his shoulders and obediently shut up.

“Is it dangerous to go back with you?” Yang Kai turned to look at the beautiful woman, a cheap look on his face, as if he didn’t know how to write the word dead, boldly pressing his arm up against her full chest as he did.

At such a close distance, as long as he unleashed his full strength, this beautiful woman would have no hope of living, but he decided against acting rashly. Although he felt that these three weren’t the slightest bit trustworthy, they should at least be able to lead him out of the Chaotic Abyss.

This was what Yang Kai most wanted right now, so he held back his urge to attack.

“How could that be?” The beautiful woman smiled enchantingly, “Not only will there not be any danger, but Elder Sister will also give you an unforgettable experience.”

“Then I’ll eagerly wait,” Yang Kai nodded.
