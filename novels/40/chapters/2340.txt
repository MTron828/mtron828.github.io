Shi Cang Ying’s bloodstained hand was now placed over Du Xian’s head.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian grew up as childhood sweethearts, cultivating together and growing up with strong affection for each other. They had long ago taken the other as their other half, but they had yet to reach the peak of their Martial Dao, so they had decided it was not yet time for them to marry.

The two had secretly agreed that when the both of them reached the Emperor Realm, Du Xian would ask for her hand in marriage from Ye Hen.

They believed that Ye Hen definitely wouldn’t refuse when the time came.

Never would Ye Jing Han have expected that day would never come as right now, before her eyes, her lover was going to be killed.

“No, Martial Uncle Shi! Please don’t!” Ye Jing Han’s body went limp and she toppled directly onto the floor, pleading.

But Shi Cang Ying’s face was cold and unmoved, “We can settle things simply if you just deactivate the Array.”

Ye Jing Han instantly fell out of sorts. Deactivating the Array would expose Thousand Leaves Sect’s greatest secret to their enemies and leave it open for them to probe into, but if she refused, from Shi Cang Ying’s ruthless display earlier, Du Xian would certainly die.

She simply did not know what to choose.

“Just ignore him, Ye’er. This old dog has lost his mind!” Du Xian suddenly shouted, “They will not let us go even if you remove the Array. Senior Brother will depart first but you have to stay well. I will not let you down in the next life!”

As he finished speaking, the Source Qi in his body surged up violently and reached a level that even he could not control in just a moment.

“Hmph!” Shi Cang Ying coldly snorted and reached out to slap Du Xian heavily on the shoulder. The raging Source Qi was instantly doused down and went back to normal.

Du Xian was dumbfounded. Seeing that he couldn’t even self-destruct in this situation, he had completely become a fish on someone else’s chopping block.

Ye Jing Han was also taken aback. She couldn’t be any clearer about what Du Xian was trying to do earlier, but when she saw Shi Cang Ying seal Du Xian’s cultivation, she actually felt a little thankful to this traitor. If he had not done so in time, Du Xian would definitely have exploded before her eyes, and Ye Jing Han would not be able to bear such a result.

This change of events had completely shattered Ye Jing Han’s psyche. Even though she knew that things would not end well if she were to dispel the Array, she still held a glimmer of hope in her heart. Looking teary-eyed towards Shi Cang Ying, she pleaded, “Martial Uncle, I can remove the Array; however... you have to let them go. They are not part of our Thousand Leaves Sect. This matter has nothing to do with them!”

The people she was referring to were Chi Yue and the others.

When he heard her say that, Ye Hen slowly shut his eyes. He knew that there was truly no going back now. Ye Jing Han may still be able to retain one thread of hope of surviving if she defended the mountain valley, but if the Array was lowered, then the consequences would definitely be dire.

Unfortunately, he was unable to move or even speak now. There was nothing he could do to stop her.

Du Xian was also desperately shaking his head at Ye Jing Han, but to no avail.

Shi Cang Ying’s cold voice sounded, “Martial Uncle is unable to make a decision on this matter.”

But as soon as he was done speaking, Qiu Ze said generously, “Fine. This King will agree to your request as long as you undo the Spirit Array obediently.”

“As if anyone would believe you!” Hua Qing Si muttered under her breath. How could she not know that Qiu Ze was merely wagging his tongue? He had no intention of letting them go at all.

In the mountain valley, Ye Jing Han wiped her tears and looked at Chi Yue and the others, “It was our Thousand Leaves Sect that dragged you into this. I will dispel the Spirit Array. When that time comes, run away at once! I will try to cover you as much as I can.”

Hua Qing Si frowned, “Sister Ye, you should come with us as well.”

She too knew that Ye Jing Han was at the end of her rope here. The lives of her own father and her lover were in the hands of someone else, so she naturally could not just stand by and watch. That was why Hua Qing Si did not blame Ye Jing Han for her decision.

It was just that... Qiu Ze was still here. Hua Qing Si did not have the slightest confidence that she could escape here with Chi Yue and the others. If it were just herself, then she had eighty percent confidence she could flee. She may not be able to defeat Qiu Ze, but there was still a chance for her to escape.

But Chi Yue and the others were only First-Order Dao Source Realm, and Chai Hu was only a Third-Order Origin King. Dreaming of escaping in front of so many experts was no doubt a fool’s errand.

Hua Qing Si decided in her heart that she would keep Chi Yue and the others safe no matter what. The rest would be up to Yang Kai once he appeared.

Faced with Hua Qing Si’s situation, Ye Jing Han only shot her a bitter smile and shook her head.

Hua Qing Si knew that she had made up her mind and could only sigh, no longer persuading her.

“What are you waiting for?” Shi Cang Ying began urging her impatiently. The Source Qi on the palm placed on top of Du Xian’s head was fluctuating as if it could take Du Xian’s life at any moment.

Ye Jing Han’s tender body trembled. She no longer dared to delay matters and quickly formed seals with both hands.

As the seals were formed rapidly, layer after layer of Sealing Arrays, Illusion Arrays, and Killing Arrays were dispelled.

Qiu Ze spread out his Divine Sense and paid close attention to the situation. Once he sensed that all the Spirit Arrays in the mountain valley had been undone, he couldn’t help but chuckle, “Martial Niece Ye has made a wise choice. You are much smarter than your father.”

After Ye Jing Han dispelled the Arrays, her entire body felt weak as if she had completely lost her strength. She could only let out a low shout, “Go!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As soon as her words came out, Hua Qing Si and the others exchanged glances and immediately tried to flee the area.

But before they could make any moves, the array base platform buzzed and a clear fluctuation of Space Principles spread out at once. Following that, a dazzling light was emitted from the platform.

“What?” Shi Cang Ying, who was already rushing towards Ye Jing Han and the others stopped in place and stared at the platform in a daze, seemingly not expecting the platform to operate at such a moment. What’s more, it seemed like someone had teleported over.

A glint also flashed in Qiu Ze’s eyes and as he stared fixedly at it.

When he saw the array base platform earlier, he thought that it was broken. If not, why did Ye Jing Han and the others not escape? Instead, they holed themselves up in the mountain valley, but now, it seemed things were not as he imagined.

Someone had teleported over from somewhere. Didn’t that mean that the platform was fine? Who was the person who arrived? And where did the platform connect to?

Unlike the bewilderment of Shi Cang Ying and Qiu Ze, the ashen-faced Ye Hen’s eyes went wide and his body began to tremble uncontrollably when he saw the light.

The entrance to the Sealed World... was repaired!

The entrance to the Sealed World which had been closed off for ten thousand years had finally been repaired!

The generations of Thousand Leaves Sect’s Sect Masters had taken it as their mission to restore the entrance, but none of them had ever succeeded in doing so. But now he was able to witness the moment the Sealed World’s entrance was reopened with his own eyes.

In an instant, Ye Hen could not help but feel that he would not have regrets even in his death, and he could not help but laugh like a fool.

As long as the entrance to the Sealed World was repaired, the inheritance of the Thousand Leaves Sect would not be cut off. Then, there would be a chance for the Sect to shine again.

But when he remembered the situation he and the Thousand Leaves Sect were currently in, Ye Hen’s heart sank to the bottom again.

Naturally, he knew who it was that repaired the entrance; after all, Yang Kai was the only person who had gone in in the past few days. Who else could it be but him? While he couldn’t help but sigh in admiration at his daughter’s judgment, he also lamented that the Heavens did not allow Thousand Leaves Sect more opportunity to rise again.

If he had just a few more days, Ye Hen was sure he would be able to obtain the lost Secret Arts and Secret Techniques in the Sealed World, then he would be able to activate the Earth Grade puppets in the main peak’s square again.

With the help of those Earth Grade puppets, Thousand Leaves Sect would not have fallen into this situation. Even if they were not the opponents of Qiu Ze and the others, they would still be able to fight them to the death.

But the entrance just had to be repaired at this time.

Now not only was Thousand Leaves Sect done for, their inheritance which had been lost for ten thousand years would also fall into the hands of their enemies.

With just Yang Kai, Ye Hen did not believe he would be able to stop Qiu Ze.

Just as these thoughts were running through his mind, two figures gradually appeared at the platform. One of them was Yang Kai, but the other was a seven or eight-year-old girl that looked like a jade doll. This little girl had long fiery red hair that almost ran down to her ankles like a soft waterfall. She was wearing the clothes of a man which looked loose and out of place on her. It could be seen at a glance that the clothes belonged to Yang Kai, but such attire did not take away from her beauty in the slightest. Instead, it added a playful touch of cuteness to her, so that anyone who saw her would not be able to look away. Especially her little pink cheeks of hers that tempted one to pinch them.

When the two of them appeared, they clearly did not understand the situation unfolding before them. It wasn’t until he could smell the faint scent of blood that Yang Kai’s face sank and he released his Divine Sense.

In an instant, his face turned ugly.

He could see that Chi Yue and the others were all wounded, hiding behind the array base platform as they watched Ye Hen and Du Xian that were being kept in place by the others, their auras weak and unstable. He could see a nervous look on Shi Cang Ying’s face, as well as Luo Jin who was glaring at him with flames of hatred flickering in his eyes.

“Young Master Yang!” As soon as Hua Qing Si saw Yang Kai, she knew their saviour had come. She could not help but breathe out a sigh of relief and smiled bitterly, “If you showed up any later, we would’ve been done for!”

“I’m sorry, Young Master Yang...” Ye Jing Han looked at Yang Kai nervously, “It was our Thousand Leaves Sect that got you all involved in this.”

After a pause, she hurriedly said, “You should take them and run away from here quickly!”

Even though she had seen Yang Kai’s abilities and knew that he was strong, there was an Emperor Realm Master here. She did not think Yang Kai’s strength could compare to a Master at that level.

Only after hearing her words did Yang Kai look away from Qiu Ze, smiling, “En, this is a tricky situation.”

Even though he still didn’t quite understand how all this came about, he could clearly tell friend from foe in this situation.

“Was that guy the one who hurt you?” Yang Kai glanced at Qiu Ze as he asked.

Hua Qing Si was already at the peak of the Dao Source Realm, so there was really no other person here who could hurt her except for him.

“Yes!” Hua Qing Si gently nodded, “He seems to be the Palace Master of Sky Illumination Palace and has just ascended to the Emperor Realm not too long ago. His cultivation is not stable yet. If that wasn’t the case, you would not be able to see your Sister Hua anymore.”

“Good. Anyone who dares touch any of my people must die,” Yang Kai sneered.

As soon as these words came out, all of the outsiders stared at him as if he was a fool.
