“Haha, this old man was kidding, President Ai Ou. You don’t have to take it seriously!” All of a sudden, Zuo De broke into a big laugh as he spoke.

God knows if he was really joking or really had planned to take a rest but changed his words after noticing that Ai Ou looked unhappy.

Zue De might have a noble standing, but Ai Ou’s status wasn’t low either. Naturally, he couldn’t ignore Ai Ou’s feelings.

“Hehe, Grandmaster, if you are really tired, you can take a rest for a few days. I’m not in a hurry. In any case, I have already waited for so long, it won’t hurt to wait for a few days more.” Ai Ou’s reaction wasn’t slow either. He had no choice but to give the opposite party a chance to get out of this embarrassing situation. Furthermore, he had given an obvious message, [You have already kept this old man waiting for so long!]

“Saving the patient comes first!” Zuo De waved off and said decisively.

“Thank you very much, Grandmaster.” Ai You heaved a sigh of relief. His scowl eased down immediately.

“Zhan Yuan greets the Honored Teacher. Honoured Teacher is really kind and benevolent. You are putting people first even though you are tired from the journey. You are a model for everyone. You are really great. You have this left Zhan Yuan in admiration!” The hook-nosed man stepped out of the crowd and made his way to Zuo De, ass-kissing Zuo De.

Zuo De glanced at him, looking a bit confused. But soon, he burst into laughter. “So it’s you! Hmm, you are already a Mid-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist, you have made progress. Good job!”

Zhan Yuan was highly delighted upon receiving this compliment. He looked as if he had eaten an entire pot of honey. He immediately flattered Zuo De, “Had I not been lucky enough to receive guidance from the Honoured Teacher back then, this Zhan Yuan would not have achieved what he has today. Honoured Teacher, please receive this Zhan Yuan’s worship!”

As he spoke, he started kowtowing on the ground with an earnest look on his face, devoutly.

Zuo De nodded and praised, “You are quite good. This old man just gave you a few pointers because you looked depressed. Who would have thought that you will remember it till today? If you want, you can stay by this old man’s side from now on. This old man just happened to be lacking an assistant.”

“Absolutely! Absolutely! Thank you very much, Honoured Teacher. Disciple will follow the Honoured Teacher wherever you go!” Zhan Yuan beamed with joy. He kept thanking, again and again.

Although he was a Mid-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist, it was not shameful to act as Zuo De’s assistant. It was a once in a lifetime chance; others could not get it even after begging for it. Zhan Yuan could have never thought that he could get such an awesome job just by stepping forward and speaking a few words with Zuo De.

Furthermore, Zuo De had practically agreed to Zhan Yuan being his disciple with his words, which was more beneficial than anything.

He was just ranked in the middle among the Origin Grade Alchemists, but with the identity of Grandmaster Zuo De’s disciple, his status would be completely different in the future. Everyone below Origin King Grade Alchemist would have to be polite to him.

For a moment, Zhan Yuan was so happy that he was practically ready to dance in joy.

Some Origin Grade Alchemists glanced at Zhan Yuan with envy.

By following Zuo De, even if it was just an assistant, they felt that one would learn a lot of good stuff. And if by some fluke of luck, one’s comprehension reached an appropriate level, he might just become the next Zuo De!

Who would not be envious of such a good opportunity?

After beaming in joy for a while, Zhan Yuan suddenly approached Zuo De and whispered to him something, acting mysterious and all.

He had lowered his voice pretty much to nothing; it was almost impossible to discern what he was saying. Before Grandmaster Zuo De, no one dared to use their Divine Sense to eavesdrop, so no one really knew what he was talking about.

Immediately, everyone glanced at Yang Kai sympathetically, one after another!

Everyone knew that Yang Kai’s life would turn miserable from now on. He had offended an Origin King Grade Alchemist. No one in this world would refine pills for him. It was extremely difficult for an Origin King Realm master to advance even an inch in cultivation. Without the assistance of pills, he might only make a little progress. Perhaps he might remain stuck in the Second-Order Origin King Realm for his entire life.

[What a pity! Such an outstanding genius, who might have had a chance to become a Third-Order Origin King in the future, stand at the peak of the Star Field, will have his future cut-short.]

A look of regret appeared on the faces of many Alchemists.

Meanwhile, Zuo De narrowed his eyes, glancing in Yang Kai’s direction a few times before withdrawing his gaze, as if he didn’t care about him at all.

Zhan Yuan kept babbling as if he wasn’t finished. Ai Ou, on the other hand, looked unhappy at the sight of this, but he didn’t urge. Rather he kept waiting patiently.

As he had said before, he had been waiting for a long time, he wasn’t in a rush.

Not to mention, Zhan Yuan could barely be considered as Grandmaster Zuo De’s half disciple. He had gained a noble status in a flash. Ai Ou would have to be considerate to him a bit.

After a long time, Zhan Yuan finally stopped talking with a flattering smile hanging on his lips.

Zuo De nodded slightly, looking kind and amiable. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ai Ou timely interrupted, “Grandmaster, please come in!”

“Mhmm.” Zuo De agreed. Supported by Zuo Ling, he made his way into the main hall, step by step. When he walked by Ai Ou’s side, he gestured to him. Ai Ou immediately understood, he promptly started walking shoulder to shoulder with Zuo De.

Others followed behind them in small scattered groups.

“President Ai Ou, this old man came to Water Sky City for two things, one to refined Soul Source Restoration Pill for Mrs. Gu, and as for the second, I would like to get your consent for one other thing.” Zuo De talked to Ai Ou while walking.

“Grandmaster, whatever you need, you just have to mention it. My Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce will never refuse you as long as we can do it.” Ai Ou replied earnestly.

“Hehe, don’t be so quick to agree because I’m afraid you won’t agree.” Zuo De calmly smiled.

Ai Ou proudly assured, “My Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s business is spread all over the world. Although I dare not say how rich I am. If we can’t even fulfil Grandmaster’s request, how can we have any qualifications to invite you.”

“If President Ai Ou says so, then this old man would not beat around the bush.” Zuo De paused and straightened out his thoughts. Only then did he continue, “This old man came this time to talk about my granddaughter’s marriage.”

He pointed at Zuo Ling, who was supporting him.

“Talk about marriage!?” Ai Ou’s heart skipped a beat. He was a little displeased. Intentionally or unintentionally, he glanced at Xue Yue before he forced a smile and replied, “Miss Zuo Ling is Grandmaster’s granddaughter. She is a girl of noble status and also extremely beautiful. I wonder which punk in my Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce got lucky to be fancied by Miss Zuo Ling?”

“President Ai Ou, please don’t play dumb.” Zuo De smiled and proudly said, “There aren’t many people in this world who are worthy for my Ling’er, and the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce just happened to have one. Furthermore, Ling’er has known him since childhood and fell in love with him. When Ling’er heard that this old man was coming to Water Sky City, she brazenly followed this old man and forced this old man to propose marriage. If I didn’t agree, she said that she would burn this old man’s beard... sigh, I have really spoiled this girl.”

Zuo De looked distressed.

“Grandpa!” Zuo Ling flushed red all over. She fiercely tugged Zuo De’s arm, but her pretty eyes were furtively looking at Xue Yue’s reaction. She believed that even a fool would understand what Zuo De meant. She very much wanted to know Xue Yue’s reaction.

But in one glance, Zuo Ling’s heart immediately sank because she found that Xue Yue’s face had gone pale and appeared to be at a loss.

[Does Brother Xue Yue not like me?] Zuo Ling’s heart was filled with unease.

“Is Grandmaster talking about... Xue Yue?” Ai Ou couldn’t pretend to be a fool anymore. He was left with no choice but to continue.

“That’s right,” Zuo De smiled and continued, looking at Xue Yue with satisfaction. “Third Young Lord is extraordinarily talented; he is a dragon among men. He is young, handsome, and is also the successor of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. If President Ai Ou can agree to this marriage, hehe, this old man would also get a son who will tend to him and lay him to rest after his death. Perhaps I will remain in Water Sky City in the foreseeable future.”

His words gave a very important message, that if Xue Yue and Zuo Ling became husband and wife, the Zuo De will really become a member of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce in the future. He would live in Water Sky City and refine pills for Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

If Ai Ou was in any urgent need, he wouldn’t have to go all the way to invite him over.

This was a huge temptation for any great force or any cultivator for that matter. If Xue Yue was really a man, Ai Ou would not be mulling over it, he would have promptly agreed.

Compared to the happiness of his son, an Origin King Grade Alchemist was undoubtedly more important.

But Xue Yu was a girl!

This was simply impossible!

Even if Ai Ou agreed now, everything would be exposed on their first night. Zuo De would be completely offended then.

So, Ai Ou was in a pretty big dilemma. He felt powerless for the first time in his life.

“What’s wrong!? Does President Ai Ou have some concerns?”

Originally, Zuo De thought that if he personally proposed a marriage, Ai Ou would give him a face no matter what. Not to mention, Ai Ou was requesting Zuo De’s help. But when he proposed, Zuo De didn’t get the eager response that he had imagined. Rather, Ai Ou looked extremely embarrassed.

This made Zuo De very unhappy. His tone grew colder and colder.

“That’s not the case, that’s really not the case. Grandmaster misunderstood.” Ai Ou waved his hand quickly. He immediately realized that if he didn’t handle today’s matter properly, it would lead to a great deal of trouble.

But he couldn’t think of a proper excuse for a short while. He stood in a daze.

Zuo De let out a cold snort and said, “This old man is here to propose marriage, and the Soul Source Restoration Pill is this old man’s show of good faith. If President Ai Ou agrees to this marriage, this old man will refine ten bottles of Origin King Grade pills for the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce every year!”

Everyone’s gasps could be heard in the hall, staring Zuo De in shock.

Ten bottles meant a hundred pills.

It would have been nothing if it was a normal pill. But it was a hundred Origin King Grade pills! Each pill was priceless. Even for an Alchemist such as Zuo De, it was easier said than done.

Everyone immediately understood that Zuo Ling held an extremely high position in Zuo De’s mind. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to offer such generous conditions.

Ai Ou’s heart started pounding. Deep in his heart, he was exhilarated but was extremely annoyed as well.

In the past, when Zuo De was asked to refine Origin King Grade pills, not only would Ai Ou have to provide a large number of ingredients as remuneration but would also have to depend on whether Zuo De was in a good mood or not. Even so, he got only twenty or so Origin King Grade pills from Zuo De.

And last year, he only got five pills!

And now, this old man was offering a hundred pills every year. Obviously, he could do it with ease. Ai Ou had no idea how Zuo De had been hiding all this.

This made him very annoyed. He felt that all the expensive gifts his Chamber of Commerce had offered to Zuo De had been fed to the dogs.
