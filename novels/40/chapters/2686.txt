“Ten million!” A voice sounded abruptly.

The clamorous auction house fell silent in an instant as numerous people turned to look at room one with their faces twitching.

That was because they recognized the voice that offered ten million High-Rank Source Crystals had belonged to Yang Kai. Naturally, they felt resentful.

The price was terrifyingly raised from three million to ten million, more than tripled in one go. Such a price gap shocked all the Emperor Realm Masters.

But then again, a Heaven Grade Puppet was really worth such a price. Although ten million High-Rank Source Crystals was not cheap, it was completely worth it for a Heaven Grade Puppet. It could only be said that the boy in room one was decisive enough to offer a high price straightaway to deter most of the competitors who coveted it.

Auctions were competitions of wits and guts, and if one could not afford more than the new bid, he could only give up on it.

“What the hell!” Wu Ming who hid behind the stage scolded angrily.

Although the others thought that Yang Kai was acting generously and decisively to win the Heaven Grade Puppets, he knew what Yang Kai was really up to. The bidding price was just a number to Yang Kai, because he was not planning to pay at all. Therefore, not to mention ten million, he would even dare to offer a hundred million if he needed to.

Considering all this, Wu Ming’s heart clenched as cold sweat trickled down his forehead.

[Don’t tell me this little brat… really is going to offer a hundred million later?]

“Boy, how bold you are!” The old man in room seven yelled with a slight tinge of anger. He cursed Yang Kai in his heart for not understanding decorum. No one would raise the bid to such a high price like this. If the bidders cut one another’s throats, it would only benefit the organizer. If Yang Kai did not buy the two previous Heaven Grade Puppets, he would suspect that Yang Kai was a plant from the auction house.

“Ten million High-Rank Source Crystals for a Heaven Grade Puppet. Boy, your calculations aren’t bad, but unfortunately, you’ve run into this Old Master today,” the old man from room seven sneered and offered, “Eleven million.”

The price of his bid was actually almost close to his limit, but Yang Kai’s action was so unruly that he could not bear it and secretly decided to compete with him to the end. He wanted to make him understand that old ginger was spicier than young ginger.

“One hundred million!”

Yang Kai sat on his chair, resting his cheek on his palm, holding a cup of tea and sipping gently.

*Pu… *

Ye Jing Han almost laughed out loud. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this point, how could she not understand Yang Kai’s plan? This auction was just a joke to Yang Kai, so there was no difference between ten million, hundred million, one billion or even ten billion to him. They were just numbers that he shouted, never intending to pay up in the end.

Ye Hen and Du Xian also revealed odd expressions, secretly wiping the sweat on their foreheads.

Backstage, Wu Ming’s face turned black. As he expected, the little brat really dared to bid a hundred million.

On the contrary, gasps could be heard one after another from all the private rooms as countless eyes in the hall converged towards room one.

“Did I hear him right? One hundred million? Did he mean Low-Rank Source Crystals or High-Rank Source Crystals?”

“Dream, dream. I must be dreaming.”

“This little brat is crazy! Does he really have so many Source Crystals to spend? If he can’t finish spending them, he can just spare some for me! What a waste!”

“Young Lord, this humble one is willing to serve you. This humble one’s capital is quite impressive, big, soft and white…”

…..

The hall was buzzing excitedly. Yang Kai’s bid of one hundred million left them totally flabbergasted, just like a loud boom of thunder that shocked them to the state of dizziness and confusion.

“You, you, you…” The old man in room seven became furious after recovering from his shock and crushed the arm of his chair as he shouted, “Little brat, don’t go too far!”

Yang Kai curled his lips and glanced lightly at room seven, “As you said, this is an auction, so naturally the one with the most money gets what he wants. How is this Young Master going too far?”

“You are clearly bidding maliciously! This is ridiculous!” He doubted that Yang Kai would really be willing to spend a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystal to buy a Heaven Grade Puppet. The value of a Heaven Grade Puppet was only ten to twenty million. What was the concept of a hundred million? Even those first-class Sects may not be able to take out so many Source Crystals at once.

Yang Kai snorted, “If you can’t afford to play, don’t play. It’s better to find a place to enjoy the rest of your life when you’re old. Why come out and make a fool of yourself?”

“You are infuriating this Old Master!” The old man was fuming and turned to Hua Qing Si, “Madam, is this auction simply going to allow this man to make a mockery of the rules and bid maliciously? Is there no one here who will maintain order?”

This was the branch of Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce’s regulations, which was extremely damaging to its credibility. The old man questioned her, thinking that Hua Qing Si was a member of the Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce.

Hua Qing Si glanced faintly at room seven and answered, “However much he bid is his business. I didn’t see him causing any trouble, but on the contrary, you’re the one who’s interrupting the auction.”

The old man was shocked, but then he remembered that the boy in room one seemed to be quite close with this auctioneer. They were even whispering to each other on stage just before the auction started, so it was only natural for her to help him instead of an outsider.

“Snakes and rats in the same nest, colluding with each other!” The old man flicked his sleeves, feeling extremely disappointed with Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, mumbling out loud, “I don’t believe he can come up with a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals.”

If any random person could take out a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals, they would not be called High-Rank Source Crystals anymore. Even this old man could only gather up to twenty million High-Rank Source Crystals by almost emptying the coffers of his Sect. Given that Yang Kai looked so young, and his cultivation was only First-Order Emperor Realm, how could he have such rich financial resources?

“Old Zhou is right. This boy is definitely here to make trouble. He should be kicked out!” Someone yelled immediately. It was the Emperor Realm Master from room thirteen.

“Expel him! This kind of person should not be allowed to participate in the auction. He already picked up two bargains, what is Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce even doing?”

All of a sudden, the crowd became riotous and began demanding Yang Kai be thrown out of the auction.

The main reason was that the offer of one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals was too terrifying. This was just the third auction item, and there were more Heaven Grade Puppets to come as well as the rumoured Star Master. If Yang Kai hiked up the price indiscriminately every time, who could defeat him?

They could not let him stay any longer for the sake of their own benefits.

Twenty or thirty Emperor Realm Masters shouted together, their Emperor Intent pulsing from each private room, as if the end of days was about to descend, frightening the wits out of the cultivators in the lower hall.

Hua Qing Si also frowned on the stage. If it was just one or two people, she did not need to pay it any mind, since this auction was really just a show. However, now that there were so many Emperor Realm Masters complaining, she had no idea what to do. If she did not handle this well, it might cause Yang Kai a dreadful disaster.

Wu Ming sneered backstage, secretly feeling satisfied about the situation. He showed no intention to step out and calm the situation because he could not wait for Yang Kai to draw the hatred of everyone present, making it easier to facilitate the next part of the plan.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai bellowed from room one while picking the wax from his ear.

The noise from all directions was causing his brain to buzz.

“Little brat, how dare you shout at us!” The old man in room seven now couldn’t wait to fight it out with Yang Kai. The situation was completely in his favour and he did not put Yang Kai in his eyes anymore, snapping righteously, “If you are smart, quickly disappear from this Old Master’s sight. If you don’t, everyone here will teach you how to show proper respect!”

Just when he finished his sentence, all of a sudden, a figure bizarrely emerged in the air above the auction hall. It was Yang Kai.

“You… What are you doing!?” The old man was taken aback. Even though he was watching everything from his private room, he did not notice how Yang Kai appeared just now.

A pair of eyes now stared back though, penetrating the walls and Spirit Arrays, seemingly stabbing straight into his heart.

Yang Kai stared coldly at room seven for a moment before he swept his gaze across the hall finally declaring, “All you trash are accusing this Young Master of maliciously bidding because you don’t believe this Young Master can take out one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals. Then let this Young Master ask you, what if I can take them out?”

“Impudence!”

“Ridiculous!”

“This is so outrageous. The blasphemy!”

Although the cultivation of the Emperor Realm Masters here was not considered high, they were all still pillars of their respective Sects and forces. Each of them had exceedingly high status, so it was only natural for them to be infuriated after Yang Kai referred to them as trash.

“If you can take them out, this King will eat three kilograms of shit!”

The voice came out from nowhere and no one knew which private room it came from. Obviously it was just some random yelling and the person did not want to expose his position.

However, Yang Kai accurately locked his gaze on room thirteen and replied in amazement, “This friend has such strong taste. This Young Master admires you greatly!”

Inside room thirteen, a certain middle-aged man’s face turned pale. He did not expect that he would fail to hide his position with his Secret Technique and was instantly spotted by Yang Kai. He was now deeply regretting his choice of words. If he knew this, he would not have shouted recklessly.

It was just that Yang Kai was so unpleasant to his eyes that he instinctively wanted to annoy him.

The others also looked at room thirteen with various expressions.

“Good, since Your Excellency is so enthusiastic, this Young Master will fulfill your wish!” Yang Kai clapped his hands then turned to room seven and asked, “Old thing, how about you?”

“You?” The old man sneered disdainfully. Obviously, he did not believe that Yang Kai could come up with so many Source Crystals.

“Yes, me. Tell me what you’re willing to wager, or are you all talk?” Yang Kai snorted.

The purpose of him coming here this time, firstly was to rescue Chi Yue and his Seniors, and secondly to recover the Heaven Grade Puppets of Thousand Leaves Sect. Since there were people who dared to interrupt him, he would not show any kindness.

The old man retorted, “If you can take them out, this Old Master will take down his head and let you use it as a ball.”

To him, Yang Kai was just a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even if he really could take out one hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals, he was not afraid of him either. It was not a big deal for him to fight with Yang Kai; in fact, he very much wanted to teach Yang Kai that there was always a bigger fish.

“Very good,” Yang Kai grinned, “Then, prepare your head for this Young Master.”

While speaking, he turned around and flew to the stage where Hua Qing Si was located. After landing and examining the surroundings, he announced, “Open your dog eyes and watch carefully, tell me if this Young Master is maliciously bidding or not!”

With a wave of his hand, a big hill of Source Crystals appeared on the stage. Each of the Source Crystals emitted blinding white light as they released an amazing aura. All of a sudden, the whole auction venue was completely filled with World Energy.
