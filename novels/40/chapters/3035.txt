Inside the hall, the sounds of the carnal acts gradually stopped.

Outside the hall, Yang Kai stood dumbstruck.

That moment stretched out as if time had frozen at that very moment. Then, the woman’s slightly opened eyes met his peeping gaze. Their eyes seemed to meet for a moment and Yang Kai’s heart jumped in fright. [This is bad!]

Up until today, he had gone through many difficult challenges in life to get to where he was; however, what he witnessed just now was so unbelievable that he was utterly shaken. It wasn’t until this moment that he realized that the Dragon Clan member inside the hall was none other than Fu Ling, the one who came to pick them up when they first arrived in Dragon Palace.

Fu Ling’s slightly opened eyes slowly became sharp and compelling. It was clear that she had noticed his presence, so how could he dare to stay for another moment longer? Pushing his Space Principles, Yang Kai immediately disappeared from that spot.

Fu Ling frowned and stood up slowly. A touch of liquid flowed down her thighs but she ignored it. She didn’t even bother to cover up her body and simply walked straight out just like that. Glancing at the spot where Yang Kai had been standing just a moment ago and seeing nothing there, her scowl deepened and she turned her head to look into the distance, snorting softly as she did so.

…..

Yang Kai flew above the sea with an awkward expression. He had not expected to encounter something like that. It wasn’t his intention to peep, it was just that the scene was too shocking, so it was inevitable that he took a few more glances. That was why he accidentally revealed his presence.

[I wonder if she noticed me. She probably did. Otherwise, the look in her eyes wouldn’t have changed so much. Will she come looking for me? Will she cause trouble for me?] Based on the Dragon Clan’s temperament, that possibility was almost certain. Fortunately, Fu Ling did not know who he was even if she wanted to search for him. Moreover, she had not paid any attention to him when they met several days back. She would not remember a nobody like him. Therefore, there was no need to worry too much about it.

Although the lifestyle of that female Dragon might be a little more corrupt than usual, her figure and appearance were extraordinary. She was a Divine Spirit, a Dragon, after all; it was only natural for her to have extraordinary looks.

Recalling the scene he witnessed, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling his heart racing as a result. Obscene images filled his mind as he continued to explore a few more islands to no avail. Hence, he decided to return for now. A few days had passed since he left the island and he did not know how Lu San Niang and her daughter were doing. Besides, he was also worried that Yuan Wu would cause trouble for them.

Half a day later, Yang Kai returned to the island. Landing on the ground, he glanced around but did not see Lu San Niang or her daughter anywhere. He did not know if they were hiding or doing something else.

Just as he was about to begin searching for them, the sound of water splashing about suddenly rang out from the sea nearby. At the same time, a peal of clear and sweet laughter entered his ears. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Turning his head in that direction, Yang Kai saw two graceful figures slowly rising from the sea. It was Lu San Niang and her daughter. He did not know what they had been doing under the sea, but they were clearly returning at this moment.

Both the bodies of mother and daughter were dripping wet, their clothes pressed tightly against their bodies, vividly revealing their graceful curves. One was mature and voluptuous while the other was young and alluring.

Yang Kai’s eyesight was so sharp that even if they were standing far away, he could take in that beautiful scenery clearly just by looking in that direction. Thus, he shifted his gaze away without saying anything and looked somewhere else, simply feeling relieved that they were safe.

The laughter continued. It was Lu Yu Qin’s voice. She seemed to have encountered something pleasant and was laughing non-stop. All of a sudden, the laughter broke off as she had probably noticed his presence. The mother-daughter pair exchanged a glance with each other before hurriedly using their Qi to remove the water from their clothes. After that, they flew over hand-in-hand.

“Little Brother Yang!” Lu San Niang greeted Yang Kai and landed not too far away. What happened just now might have made Lu Yu Qin a little shy, so she was hiding behind her mother and did not dare to show her face. Moreover, her cheeks were a little flushed.

Only then did Yang Kai look in their direction and nodded lightly with a smile, “I’m glad you’re having fun, Elder Sister Lu.”

He thought that the mother-daughter pair had been playing in the sea.

She smiled and asked, “Did you gain anything from your trip, Little Brother Yang?”

She might not know the exact reason why he was going out, but she knew that he had a purpose. It was just that she could not inquire too deeply into the matter since he did not take the initiative to tell her about it.

“I was just looking around,” he replied.

“The scenery around Dragon Palace is beautiful indeed. Little Brother Yang, please wait for a moment, let’s talk when I return after delivering something.”

He asked suspiciously, “Deliver?”

“This!” While speaking, she flicked her wrist and a Luminous Pearl suddenly appeared on the palm of her hand. The Luminous Pearl was not small, about the size of a man’s fist. It was unexpectedly round and full, and one glance was enough to tell that it was a first-class product. It was also exuding a soft light, which gave off a very warm feeling.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up at the sight. Although this kind of Luminous Pearl did not have much value to one’s cultivation, women loved such things. That couldn’t be helped; this kind of Luminous Pearl was best used for lighting up dark places and was many times better than using other kinds of luminous stones.

“This pearl is pretty good.” He nodded in praise.

She replied, “This is one of Dragon Palace’s specialties. It’s known as the Radiant Night Pearl. It’s hard to find this in the outside world.”

“Who are you going to give this to?”

Her expression became a little unnatural. Mulling over it for a bit, she decided to answer anyway, “I was going to give it to Yuan Wu…”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened immediately, “Did he make you do this?”

When he left, all 500 people had been given tasks. Only Yang Kai, Lu San Niang, and her daughter had been exempted. It wasn’t because Yuan Wu was being respectful towards Yang Kai but simply because he did not dare to command the three of them to do anything. He had suffered a terrible loss in Yang Kai’s hands after all.

[I can’t believe Yuan Wu did something like this the moment I left!] Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling annoyed. [It looks like the lesson I gave him before isn’t enough!] He immediately turned to look towards the centre of the island.

When Lu San Niang saw his expression, she immediately understood what he was thinking and hurriedly explained, “It’s not like that. He did not force me to do anything.”

“Then, why did you…” He looked at her with a frown.

She explained, “I volunteered to do this.”

[Volunteered to do this? Why?] Yang Kai said, “You don’t have to do that. He won’t dare to do anything to you.”

“I know.” She smiled wryly, “But, I want to leave this place as soon as possible. The Dragon Clan gave us a deadline of one month, but if we can finish building the palace a little earlier, then we can leave this place sooner too.”

After listening to her explanation, Yang Kai immediately understood what she was trying to do. This place was her nightmare, and every moment she spent here was another moment where she was tortured by the memories of this place. It was only natural that she did not wish to stay here for long. She just wanted to leave as soon as possible.

Knowing this, his anger cooled. If she had volunteered to do this, then there was nothing he could say to that, “Why do they need these kinds of Luminous Pearls? For lighting?”

She nodded, “Yes. Such a large palace will surely need these pearls as decoration. Besides, I am very familiar with the coastal area around here. I also know where I can easily find these pearls, so it’s not that difficult of a task. I might as well do what I can do.”

At this moment, Lu Yu Qin suddenly stuck her head out and proudly exclaimed, “Mother found several hundred of them all at once!”

Lu San Niang had lived here for 200 to 300 years, so even if she couldn’t stray too far from the island, she must have been active in the nearby areas. Therefore, she was familiar with the nearby coastal region. Asking her to find these kinds of Luminous Pearls was obviously more efficient than asking others to do the same.

“Did Yuan Wu make things difficult for you again?” He looked at her and asked the question.

“No,” she shook her head, “His attitude might not be good, but he did not cause any trouble for us either.”

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Brother Yang, please excuse me for a moment. I need to deliver these pearls to him.” Afterwards, she said something to Lu Yu Qin before flying away.

Only Yang Kai and Lu Yu Qin were left. He smiled at her, but she seemed to be afraid of strangers and simply stood there awkwardly, blushing slightly without saying anything. Thus, Yang Kai looked for something to talk about and chatted with her. Unfortunately, she only replied with a few words or non-committal nods. It seemed like she didn’t dare to talk to him.

A short while later, Lu San Niang returned with a smile. She looked at Yang Kai and added, “Yuan Wu probably saw you coming back so he didn’t even dare to give me attitude this time around.”

“People like him only dare to bully the weak but are terrified of the strong,” Yang Kai snorted coldly. He looked down on people like Yuan Wu, but that was only if they did not do anything to him. If they so much as provoked him, it would not end at just giving them a lesson.

All of a sudden, Lu San Niang’s expression grew solemn and she whispered, “I heard them talking just now. It seems that quite a few people died while mining the Ice Spirit Snow Jade. Moreover, one of them was in the Emperor Realm.” Her expression seemed to be filled with lingering fears. She was clearly grateful for having Yang Kai’s protection; otherwise, she might have been assigned to mine the Ice Spirit Snow Jade too.

“Somebody in the Emperor Realm died?” Yang Kai was astonished. He knew that mining the Ice Spirit Snow Jade was no easy task and would surely be fraught with dangers, but even so, he did not expect people to die in the endeavour after just a few days!

“Yes. I didn’t hear much about the exact details so all I know is that a cold explosion occurred at the mineral lode of the Ice Spirit Snow Jade. A few people failed to escape in time, and they froze to death as a result.”

He asked, “What about Wu Chen?”

Yang Kai did not understand that monkey-like man at all. That man had helped Yang Kai out of a sticky situation and later volunteered to mine the Ice Spirit Snow Jade, which recovered some of Yuan Wu’s face. He seemed to be a good person who was considerate of others; however, Yang Kai had the feeling that that man was not that simple and couldn’t help being rather concerned about him.

She replied, “I’m not sure. I did not see him. He should still be mining the Ice Spirit Snow Jade; after all, this is a task handed down by the Dragon Clan. Nobody dares to procrastinate on that matter. Even if they want to proceed more carefully, they can only grit their teeth and continue working at pace or they risk not meeting the deadline.”

“That’s true.” Yang Kai nodded. He was the only one among the 500 people here that couldn’t care less about this matter. The others were working hard to complete the task given by the Dragon Clan within the one-month deadline; after all, it was a matter that involved their life-or-death. If they did not work hard on it, they would only be waiting for death.

While Yang Kai was speaking with Lu San Niang, a commotion sounded from the other side. The sounds seemed to be coming from the place where the palace was going to be built. Apparently, something had happened there.

Neither Yang Kai nor Lu San Niang was bothered by the commotion. However, several people soon came flying from the other side, rushing directly towards Yang Kai and Lu San Niang.
