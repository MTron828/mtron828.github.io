Tiea revealed her outstanding cultivation and power as soon as she unleashed the three bursts of Qi. Following three soft noises, three fat insect Monster Beasts were immediately split into two. Pale yellow juices spurted out, and a disgusting smell permeated the air instantly.

More Monster Insects pounced on them, spitting out highly corrosive venom. Tiea moved skillfully to dodge and found an opening to cast her powerful Shamanic Spells, resulting in countless injuries and deaths among the enemy.

On the other hand, Yang Kai dived straight into the swarm of Monster Insects with his fists clenched, like a brave warrior of the Barbarian Race. His fighting style was totally opposite to Tiea’s elegance, but his speed in killing insects was no slower than hers. With his Shamanic Spells shielding his body, Yang Kai had no need to fear their venom or juices.

Within half an hour, the nest of Monster Insects was cleaned up.

Without saying a word, they began to look for Monster Cores among the dead bodies.

However, when Yang Kai got the Monster Cores, he realized that they were incredibly small, not at all comparable to the Monster Cores of the Monster Beasts outside. All of them were ugly, and other than their small size, the energy contained inside was dreadfully poor too.

This was probably due to the environment here.

These Monster Insects lived by leeching the energy inside the Evergreen Divine Tree, so although they grew faster, they were certainly not as sturdy as the Monster Beasts outside, and even their Monster Cores were not as impressive.

Though, it did not really matter. Despite their poor quality, this could be compensated for with the tremendous number of these Monster Insects. Ever since Yang Kai came to the Ancient World, his appetite had been insatiable. He definitely had devoured at least eight hundred to a thousand Monster Beast Cores and would not let any Monster Core escape as long as he could use it to quickly break through to the Shaman Master Realm.

After collecting all the Monster Cores, Tiea looked up and shouted, “Grandpa Qing, next.”

When the words fell, a hole split nearby that would lead to the next Monster Insect nest.

The pair went to several places continuously slaughtering all the Monster Insects they found. Suddenly, a question floated into Yang Kai’s mind, “Since Senior Qing can feel the existence of these Monster Insects. Why doesn’t he drive them away by himself and instead rely on others?”

Although Yang Kai did not know much about Senior Qing’s strength, he still could make a slight guess about it. The Monster Insects in his body were just a small problem to such a powerful Master, so if Senior Qing really wanted to, he undoubtedly could get rid of them by himself, but he seemed to always ask Tiea to help him with this instead.

Tiea’s answer was simple, “Grandpa Qing never kills.”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he was utterly speechless.

Although he could not totally agree with Senior Qing’s philosophy, considering that he was a tree of protection and blessing, Yang Kai could more or less understand why he had such apprehensions.

Over the next three days, Yang Kai and Tiea had cleaned numerous Monster Insect nests, and although the quality of the Monster Cores was still poor, there was a countless number of them.

After three days of continuous battle, Tiea started panting lightly, but Yang Kai was still as mighty as a dragon, which truly amazed Tiea.

“That’s good enough for now, you two little ones may come back.” Senior Qing’s voice suddenly reached their ears.

At the same time, a passage immediately appeared in front of them with a faint light at the end of the darkness.

Yang Kai and Tiea exchanged a glance then walked towards the passage.

Not long after, they returned to Yang Kai’s Tree Cave.

Senior Qing was still standing there, and he smiled at Yang Kai, “Many thanks, young man.”

“It’s a pleasure to help others. Don’t mention it, Senior.” Yang Kai grinned, holding a bag of Monster Cores with him happily.

It would certainly not be a problem for him to become a Shaman Master with these Monster Cores.

On the other hand, Tiea apologized, “Grandpa Qing, when I am stronger, I will help you to get rid of the Insect Queen!”

Yang Kai was stunned momentarily before turning and asking, “There is an Insect Queen?”

Tiea replied, “If not, why do you think those insects could not be killed once and for all? Every time Grandpa Qing wakes up, I have to clean them up, but there will still be more insects the next time I go in again.”

“Senior, you should have said so sooner,” Yang Kai immediately put down his bag, and remarked excitedly, “Open the passage, I will go and meet the Insect Queen!”

Tiea looked at him like he was insane.

Senior Qing smiled lightly and shook his head, “Your strength is not sufficient, so you are not its opponent at the moment.”

Tie added, “It was an existence comparable to a Shaman King. Be careful or it will swallow you.”

Yang Kai had never fought against a Shaman King before, so he naturally had no idea how strong it was. The hierarchical division of power of this world was very different from that in later generations. In this Ancient World, Shaman Kings were already great heroes with overwhelming power. Given that, in the present day, they would probably be equivalent to an Emperor Realm Master!

People like Tiea were probably equal to Dao Source Realm cultivators.

When Yang Kai was about to retort after being mocked by Tiea, Senior Qing suddenly informed, “You have a guest here, and she has been waiting for you for two days. You’d better meet her first.”

Yang Kai frowned and peeped out of the cave suspiciously. When he looked down, he saw a familiar figure pacing back and forth anxiously.

[Yu!]

Yang Kai did not expect that the guest who Senior Qing mentioned would actually be her. Although he and Yu had fought side by side, they were not close after all. After bringing Yang Kai to Frost and Snow City, Yu stopped contacting him, so why was she looking for him this time?

Senior Qing continued, “Young man, you have helped me scratch myself, so take this green leaf as a gift.”

While speaking, Senior Qing stretched out his hand and with a twirl of his wrist, a green leaf immediately appeared between his fingers. He flicked it gently, and the green leaf floated towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught the green leaf, but he did not feel the fluctuation of power from it, so he asked curiously, “Senior, may I ask what the use of this green leaf is?”

Senior Qing smiled lightly, “It’s just a little something that will allow you to return to your residence with a single thought as long as you are within the scope of my shelter.”

“I see!” Yang Kai raised his brow and carefully stored the green leaf. Although this green leaf could only return him to his Tree Cave and it seemed to be of no great use, since it was given by Senior Qing, he could only accept it.

Without another word, Senior Qing disappeared with a flicker.

After three days of fighting, Tiea looked a little exhausted, so after saying goodbye, she returned to her own Tree Cave to rest.

After the other two left, Yang Kai peeped out of the cave, looked downwards, and called out, “Are you looking for me?”

Yu looked up when she heard this voice and revealed a pleasantly surprised smile. She then mumbled an incantation and a green light shrouded her, allowing her to float up gradually and soon enter Yang Kai’s Tree Cave.

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked at her as he asked.

When Yu was about to disclose her intentions, she suddenly swept her eyes up and down at Yang Kai as if she realized something shocking, “Are you already a High-Rank Shaman Warrior?”

[How long has it been? Wasn’t it just a month ago?]

When she brought him back from White Net Mountain, Yang Kai was just a Low-Rank Shaman Warrior, so how could he break through to the High-Rank Shaman Warrior Realm in such a short time? Yu would not have believed that someone in this world could be promoted two Minor Realms in such quick succession if she had not witnessed this with her own eyes.

For comparison, her cultivation had not changed one bit this past month.

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and did not explain.

With the foundation of an Emperor Realm Master, he had no bottlenecks in his cultivation of the Ancient Shaman Arts. He only needed to accumulate enough power then he could naturally make a breakthrough. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was even taking into account the overly poor quality of his Secret Art; the Secret Art that he cultivated was taught to him by the Village Chief. How could a Secret Art from a tiny place like Blue South Village be any good? If Yang Kai could obtain the Secret Art used by a Shaman Saint, his rate of cultivation would surely be much faster.

Yu returned to her senses after a while of shock but still looked like she just suffered a heavy impact, remarking lightly, “Shaman Niu, Shaman Che wants to see you!”

“Shaman Che? Who is he?” Yang Kai frowned.

A respectful expression appeared on Yu’s face as she answered, “Shaman Che is one of the Shaman Grandmasters in our Frost and Snow Clan.”

“Why does a Shaman Grandmaster from your Frost and Snow Clan want to see me?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

It was not like he had never seen a Shaman Grandmaster before as Tiea was a Shaman Grandmaster herself; however, due to her sensitive origins, she dared not to expose her identity. If not for her Nomad Clan background, she could easily become a leader who stood above ten thousand people. Therefore, Yang Kai did not feel nervous at all even when Yu informed him about this solemnly.

After a short hesitation, Yu continued, “Are you… really the one who made that healing medicine?”

“Of course!” Yang Kai nodded as he admitted.

Yu was awed, “I didn’t expect you to be a Herbalist. En, many of our clansmen bought the healing medicine from you during this time, and its effects have been excellent. As such, our Frost and Snow Clan would like you to make a stock of it for us. Of course, we will prepare all the materials for you, you just need to refine it.”

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded after listening to her. He would be delighted if he heard about this three days ago, because that was the time when his healing medicine could not be sold and he was worried about how to earn Monster Cores. If Frost and Snow Clan had this intention, he would not have to worry about not having sufficient Green Coins to buy resources.

However, he just got a plentiful harvest from helping Senior Qing and was thinking of refining the Monster Cores of the Monster Insects now in order to break through to the Shaman Master Realm.

Therefore, he felt a little helpless when the Frost and Snow Clan suddenly approached him now.

After pondering for a while though, Yang Kai responded, “Alright, lead the way.”

In any case, it would not take him too much effort to refine some healing medicines, so it should be fine for him to cultivate while he did so.

When Yang Kai agreed, Yu was immediately elated and nodded, “Many thanks.”

“The Barbarian Race is all one family,” Yang Kai laughed.

Led by Yu, Yang Kai went out of the Tree Cave and walked all the way to the most magnificent palace in the city. Such a palace was rare in the Ancient World as the homes where Ancient Barbarians lived were generally simple. Only those with extremely high status would live in palaces like this.

The palace complex of Frost and Snow City was essentially the royal palace of Frost and Snow Clan, one where the Shaman Kings of the Frost and Snow Clan lived.

The Shaman Grandmaster named Che also resided in this palace.

With Yang Kai’s current status, it was already a great honor to meet a Shaman Grandmaster; therefore, it was impossible for him to see a Frost and Snow Clan Shaman King.
