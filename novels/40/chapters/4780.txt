The higher one’s Order in the Open Heaven Realm, the stronger one became, and there was a huge disparity in strength between each Order. Take Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters like themselves for example. With their strength alone, they were completely powerless against a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, let alone an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. In the eyes of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was probably no different from an ant.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai had been pursued by an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. With him standing here unscathed, there was no need to further elaborate on what happened at the end. It was obvious that he had successfully escaped the pursuit of that Eighth-Order Master.

Such a feat was even more shocking and admirable compared to how he challenged and defeated all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise by himself.

“It was during that incident that I had the opportunity to enter the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land. As you know, Senior, I have a Dragon Clan bloodline. Entering the Ancestral Land is like a fish diving into water for me,” Yang Kai continued, “This Junior saw a Black Ink Giant Spirit God who was suppressed and sealed in the Ancestral Land since ancient times.”

“A Black Ink Giant Spirit God!” Yuan Du’s expression became excited.

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded, “Speaking of which, I didn’t understand why the Giant Spirit God had that appearance at the time, much less why a Giant Spirit God was suppressed and sealed in the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land in the first place. After all, the Giant Spirit God Clan has a gentle, almost child-like temperament. As long as one does not provoke them, they will not provoke others. For a long time, this Junior had wondered why the Giant Spirit God was suppressed and sealed in ancient times. Just what kind of conflict took place between that Giant Spirit God and the Divine Spirits in the Ancestral Land?

“It was not until later when this Junior was enlightened by Elder Shi Zheng that I understood. The Giant Spirit God had embraced the Black Ink. That was probably the reason why the Divine Spirits in the Ancestral Land were in conflict with him back then.”

Yuan Du’s eyes were shining so brightly that he looked terrifying, “That must be the reason. Looks like the Giant Spirit God had indeed been enlightened.” Pacing back and forth with an excited and agitated expression, he suddenly stopped moving and asked, “Martial Nephew, are you sure the Giant Spirit God is dead?”

Yang Kai revealed a look of remembrance, “Although countless years have passed, the Giant Spirit God’s corpse remains perfectly intact. The Divine Spirits in the Ancestral Land claimed that he was dead, but I’m not sure about the specific circumstances. I’ve never observed the Giant Spirit God from up close after all. In any case, the Divine Spirits in the Ancestral Land have designated that area as a Restricted Area, so nobody dares to approach carelessly.”

Those words were peppered with half-truths. He could be certain that the Giant Spirit God was dead; after all, many Divine Spirits headed by the Phoenix Clan and the Kun Clan had risked danger and ventured deep into the Giant Spirit God’s body to investigate. Their investigation did not reveal the slightest hint of vitality.

“If that’s the case, then there’s a possibility that he’s not dead!” Yuan Du’s expression became even more excited, “How powerful is a Giant Spirit God!? How could he possibly be killed so easily!? Even the Divine Spirits can’t achieve something like that! He’s simply suppressed and sealed in that place. I’m sure he is accumulating strength and waiting for the chance to rise again!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Having said that, Yuan Du laughed heartily and reached out to pat Yang Kai on the shoulder, “Martial Nephew, you are the lucky charm of the Black Ink Disciples! You brought such great news as soon as you arrived!”

“Honoured Master,” Gu Ling’er called out from the side, “Are we going to figure out a method to rescue the Giant Spirit God?”

Yuan Du quickly said, “Of course! We definitely need to rescue such a powerful helping hand. Nevertheless, we need to confirm whether he is still alive first. If he is still alive, then we must rescue him. But, if he is dead, then there’s no point. Besides... that place is the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land. With our strength alone, I’m afraid our hope of success is slim to none.”

Judging from his words, he could not confirm whether the Giant Spirit God was alive or dead even though he seemed pretty confident that the Giant Spirit God was still alive earlier.

He turned to look at Yang Kai, “I’m afraid we will have to rely on you for this matter, Martial Nephew. It is the Divine Spirit’s Ancestral Land after all, so only you can freely access that place.”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “I will do whatever it takes!”

Yuan Du nodded in satisfaction, “But, before that, we should ask the Divine Lord for advice. Come with me.”

After saying that, he beckoned to them and led them in a certain direction.

Zong Yu Quan and the others immediately followed with excited expressions, as though something good was going to happen.

On the other hand, Yang Kai’s heart raced slightly. The ‘Divine Lord’ that Yuan Du mentioned just now forcefully reminded him of the Black Ink Clansman! If he was not mistaken, then the ‘Divine Lord’ that Yuan Du mentioned was most likely the Black Ink Clansman hiding in the shadows!

[Will I face my greatest trial so quickly?] There was no denying that Yang Kai came to Lang Ya Paradise for this purpose. What’s more, he had been working hard in this direction. It was just that the opportunity to approach his target came so quickly that he was mentally unprepared.

In front of Yuan Du and the others, he could simply use the Black Ink Strength suppressed and sealed in his Small Universe to conceal the truth and deceive them.

However, could he keep his identity hidden in front of a true Black Ink Clan member? Would the Black Ink Clan have some sort of special method to distinguish between friend and foe? He did not know. Unfortunately, he had no choice but to proceed forward at this point. His only option was to take things one step at a time. In the worst case, he could transform into a Grand Dragon and fight to the death.

At this moment, there was something else that puzzled him even more. [Could it be that the Black Ink Clansman is hidden in Yuan Du’s Small Universe World? Otherwise, there is no explanation for his current behaviour.]

A short while later, they arrived at an empty space where an altar in the shape of a Nine-Layer Pagoda stood on the ground ahead. It was several tens of metres tall and made from an unknown substance. More importantly, there was an eerie and sinister aura pervading it.

Yang Kai had been guarding against the Black Ink Clan and contemplating how he should react when faced with the true Black Ink Clan member. Therefore, he couldn’t help feeling confused when he suddenly caught sight of the altar. [What the Hell is that for!?]

On the contrary, the Black Ink Clan that he had been guarding against was nowhere to be seen.

Zong Yu Quan, Gu Ling’er, and the others clearly knew what was going to happen in advance. It might not even be their first time here, so their expressions were calm. Nonetheless, their gazes were extremely feverish when they looked in the direction of the altar, almost as though filled with reverence.

Yuan Du stepped forward with a solemn expression. Standing below the altar, he reached his hand out and grabbed at something. A short sword appeared in the palm of his hand. Then, he slashed the sword down his wrist. The short sword was extremely sharp. Not to mention, he had dispelled his defensive powers, so as soon as the sword came slashing down, his flesh churned and fresh blood spurted out violently.

He raised his hand and scattered his blood across the altar while chanting something. Nobody knew what he was muttering, but following his actions, his entire Small Universe began to vibrate. The Black Ink Strength churned and wriggled as though it had a life of its own.

Meanwhile, Zong Yu Quan and the others watched and waited with fiery gazes.

Yang Kai turned his head to the side, leaned close to Gu Ling’er’s ear, and whispered, “Senior Sister Gu, what is Senior Yuan Du doing?”

Gu Ling’er blushed slightly but patiently explained nevertheless, “Honoured Master is trying to communicate with the Divine Lord.”

[Communicate...] He suddenly understood. The Black Ink Clansman was not in this Small Universe. Why else would they need to go through such tedious procedures? Although Yang Kai did not know where the Black Ink Clan member was hiding, was it really possible for Yuan Du to communicate with them just by doing this? He couldn’t help being extremely sceptical!

After waiting for a long while, the altar remained unresponsive. On the contrary, Yuan Du’s complexion became pale due to excessive blood loss. Even if he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, it was impossible for him to last long when his blood was spilling freely from his wrist like a fountain.

Yang Kai leaned towards Gu Ling’er again and whispered, “Senior Sister, there’s no response!”

Gu Ling’er continued to blush, “It’s like that sometimes. Not every attempt to communicate will succeed!”

“Why?” Yang Kai was puzzled. Logically speaking, the Black Ink Clansman should be very responsive to the Black Ink Disciples. Be that as it may, her words indicated that the success rate of this communication method was rather inconsistent.

Despite not understanding the reason for everything that was happening at the moment, Yang Kai carefully recorded this scene in his heart. He would need to report his findings to Li Yuan Wang and the others later. As Elders from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, they might know something.

“I don’t know either.” She slowly shook her head.

After a whole hour had passed, Yuan Du’s complexion became as white as paper. Just as his figure was about to collapse, the altar suddenly trembled violently.

In the next moment, Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. That was because he sensed a mighty Will resembling the Heavens descending from the sky without any warning. Compared to that Will, all the living beings in the World seemed like nothing more than ants.

[Is the Black Ink Clansman really this powerful!?] His heart thumped wildly in his chest.

Following the advent of that Will, a look of excitement appeared on Yuan Du’s pale face. His voice also became louder at the same time.

Yang Kai could not understand what Yuan Du was saying at all, but he vaguely guessed that it was some kind of mantra to summon the advent of the Black Ink Clansman’s Will.

All of a sudden, pitch-black Black Ink Strength spread out from the pagoda-like altar and flowed outward in all directions like water. It was extremely pure Black Ink Strength.

Zong Yu Quan and the others immediately knelt on the ground with their hands stretched out in front of them and their bodies lowered to the ground. They constantly prayed in the direction of the altar.

Yang Kai was stuck in a daze when he felt Gu Ling’er tugging sharply on the corner of his clothes. Hesitating slightly for a moment, he imitated their actions and prostrated himself on the ground.

The Black Ink Strength that resembled real black ink flowed out of the altar and slowly came close. Zong Yu Quan and the others then absorbed and collected the Black Ink Strength into their Small Universes.

Upon receiving the nourishment of the Black Ink Strength, their expressions became even more enlivened. Even Yuan Du, who suffered from excessive blood loss, seemed to become as mighty as a dragon and fierce as a tiger at this moment.

Under these circumstances, Yang Kai did not dare to do anything suspicious. He simply allowed the Black Ink Strength to pour into his Small Universe, then activated his strength to suppress and seal it.

The Will that descended without warning earlier had left him feeling extremely on edge, for fear that his identity would be revealed; however, he soon discovered that the majestic Will was not paying any attention to him. In fact, the Will seemed a little strange. It was strong one moment and weak the next, erratically fluctuating in an endless cycle.

After boldly perceiving the energy for a moment, Yang Kai vaguely discovered that the Will was rather simple. There was not the slightest hint of subjectivity. In other words, the Will gave off the feeling of a person with a blank mind.

If there were no thoughts, then how could it communicate? How could it respond to Yuan Du’s summons and descend here? Everything was extremely odd!

The entire ritual did not last for long. From the beginning to the end, only an hour or so pass. Once the ritual ended, the Will that descended slowly vanished into nothingness. Only then did Yuan Du get to his feet and stand there with his brow wrinkled tightly.

Everybody else also followed suit and stood up. All of them were flushed and glowing as though they had just received great nourishment.

Yang Kai looked around. [Oh, no! I can’t be the exception!]

Thus, he secretly activated his strength and forced his complexion to become as red as fire, turning his skin a radiant shade!
