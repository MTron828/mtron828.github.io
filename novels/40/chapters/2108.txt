“I have never agreed to join hands with you, why are you calling me a traitor?” The Embodiment looked innocently at Hua Qing Si.

“I don’t care!” Hua Qing Si turned her head sideways and didn’t spare him a glance. She said disdainfully, “Traitor, traitor, traitor...”

“Don’t make a scene here!” Yang Kai snorted coldly and said, “Tell me, what’s Han Leng’s secret?”

“I don’t know,” Hua Qing Si replied bluntly.

“Hehe...” Yang Kai chuckled and said calmly, “It looks like you still don’t understand your current situation... I’ll have to postpone this discussion until you come back to your senses.”

Upon speaking, he waved his hand, and Hua Qing Si who had been stranded mid-air disappeared suddenly. It was unknown where in the Small Sealed World she had been thrown!

Soon after, Yang Kai started weaving hand seals with both hands and sent several seals into the air. It looked like he cast some Secret Technique against Hua Qing Si!

“Even though this woman is pretty dull-witted, she’s not a vile person,” the Embodiment said suddenly.

“I know,” Yang Kai nodded. “If she didn’t want to save me, I wouldn’t have brought her here, and I would have killed her long ago to silence her.”

“It’s fine as long as you don’t go overboard,” the Embodiment said and cast a glance at Yang Kai’s body, then spoke again, “You should quickly treat your injuries.”

Yang Kai nodded and sat down cross-legged next to the medicine garden.

In the previous battle, he had been possessed by the Demon Sense and he fought bravely with no fear of death against three Emperor Realm Masters, and he ended up sustaining a lot of injuries, injuries that contained those said Emperor Realm Masters’ Principle Power. It wasn’t easy to heal those injuries.

If an ordinary Dao Source Realm Master sustained similar injuries, then he could only consume elixirs to stop his injuries from worsening, and he wouldn’t have any means to treat them.

But Yang Kai was within the Small Sealed World, and he could draw help from this dimension’s World Principles to erase the remnant Principle Power in his injuries.

Three days quickly elapsed, and Yang Kai finished treating his injuries. He had drawn help from the Life Force emitted by the Immortal Tree in the medicine garden to speed up his body’s recovery power, and that’s why he completely recovered from his injuries in such a short time, there weren’t even any scars left.

However, he had just gone through a great battle and his body was still pretty feeble. He had to recuperate for several days to recover to his peak state.

Thereafter, he left the Small Sealed World and appeared within a guest room in the Zhang family’s manor.

Liu Yan had been keeping guard near the Sealed World Bead all along, and her pretty eyes immediately lit up upon seeing Yang Kai, and she said out of delight, “Master...”

As she spoke, she observed Yang Kai thoroughly, and she heaved a sigh of relief upon ascertaining his well-being

“You’ve gone through a lot.” Yang Kai nodded at her then collected the Sealed World Bead.

Liu Yan said, “That’s my duty.”

“Seems like you have advanced into the Dao Source Realm. Congratulations!”

Liu Yan had been sleeping all along within the magma beneath the Yuan Furnace Mountain and she absorbed the magma’s fire power. Yang Kai had detected that she would shortly make an advancement, yet she hadn’t achieved it even after a whole month, and that’s why he set off toward Maplewood City alone.

However, she had fortunately returned at the most crucial juncture and helped Yang Kai recover his sobriety by making use of the close mental bond between them. If she hadn’t shown up there, the consequences would have been too horrible to imagine.

“I’m already at the Dao Source Realm, but I’m still too lacking in comparison to you,” Liu Yan said with a faint smile.

“You don’t have to disparage yourself. You aren’t like ordinary beings and don’t have any outstanding advantage. But since Heaven has allowed you to reach your current realm, then it’ll surely allow you to walk further down your road.”

“I hope so...” Liu Yan revealed a longing look.

“By the way, have a look at this, is it useful to you?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled something and took it out of his Space Ring.

When this object appeared, the whole room’s temperature rose and a scorching aura pervaded it.

“This is...” Liu Yan’s pretty eyes contracted and she looked in shock at the object in Yang Kai’s hands.

It was a feather, a one-meter-long golden feather with a black and lively flame burning on it, a flame seemingly able to burn even souls.

“It’s a Luan Feng’s feather,” Yang Kai explained.

He had gotten the feather of Luan Feng in Clear Jade Mountain. It wasn’t a fallen feather of a young Luan Feng, but rather the Divine Feather of a fully grown Divine Spirit.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s statement, Liu Yan’s body shook as he expected and she stared in a daze at Luan Feng’s feather with her shivering pretty eyes. She said, “Can I refine it?”

“That’s what I hope,” Yang Kai handed over the feather to her with a smile.

Liu Yan took it and stroked it fondly.

Upon seeing this, Yang Kai sent her into the Sealed World Bead and left her there to refine it.

Soon after, he left the room and went to meet the Zhang family’s members.

When the Zhang family’s members saw Yang Kai, they all inquired about his well-being, and it was especially so for Zhang Ruo Xi. She was so bashful that she couldn’t utter a single word, but Yang Kai could feel her concern and relief through her frequent glances at him.

After Yang Kai had a chat with the Zhang family members, he went back to his room, then took out the Sound Bead and told Mo Xiao Qi that he was already out of harm’s way.

Mo Xiao Qi got pretty excited and promptly said that she was coming to see him, then hung up on him before he could stop her. He could only let out a bitter laugh in response!

After a short while, Yang Kai detected several powerful auras closing in from the distance and a person’s voice reached him before their arrival. “Hahaha, brother Yang, we’ve come to pay you a visit!”

A voice full of vigour reverberated!

Upon discerning who had just spoken, the Zhang family descended into chaos and they all lined up outside to welcome him under the lead of the Zhang family’s matriarch.

After a short while, there was a bright flash and several silhouettes appeared.

The Zhang family’s old madam bowed and shouted, “City Lord, you’ve honoured our humble abode with your presence, and we’re sorry for failing to welcome you properly.”

The other people had also greeted Duan Yuan Shan.

Duan Yuan Shan waved his hand and said with a smile, “Old Madam, you don’t have to be so polite, I’ve come uninvited and it’s me who should ask for your forgiveness. I’ve come here to see brother Yang and I wonder if he’s...”

“Senior Yang is resting in our guest room. Sirs, please come with me,” The old madam had been speaking calmly, yet anyone could discern her repressed excitement.

Usually, the little Zhang family wouldn’t get into the City Lord’s eyes, and it was even impossible for him to leave Maplewood City to visit them, yet at this moment, this impossible matter had occurred.

They knew well it was all because of Yang Kai, but this was still a great honour for the Zhang family.

Only a bunch of orphans and widows were left in the Zhang family and other families might set their eyes on them, but if what happened on this day spread out, then those families eyeing them wouldn’t dare to make a move against them, and their survival might even depend on the Zhang family’s attitude.

The old madam had finally seen hope for the Zhang family’s rise and she was quite grateful to Yang Kai.

“Sorry for bothering you,” Duan Yuan Shan said with a faint smile and was about to land with his companions, yet one of them couldn’t wait any longer and turned into a light beam that ventured into the Zhang family’s manor and disappeared in one of its rooms.

“Why is he so anxious and impatient?” Upon seeing this, Duan Yuan Shan could only laugh bitterly, and he didn’t reprimand him.

In the guest room, Kang Si Ran pushed open the door and entered, and he found Yang Kai gazing at him with a smile.

“Brother Yang, are you... alright?” Kang Si Ran observed Yang Kai’s state nervously, and he heaved a sigh of relief only after assessing his well-being. “I heard from the City Lord that you got corrupted by the Demon Qi outside the city and you had almost turned into a demon. It really gave me a scare!”

“Something like that happened, but fortunately, I have crossed that crisis without suffering a mishap,” Yang Kai nodded with a smile.

Kang Si Ran felt ashamed of himself and said, “At that time, I had been trying to break through my bottleneck in secluded cultivation and had no idea about what’s happening outside and didn’t get any information about it until I left seclusion two days ago. But, you had already disappeared then and I couldn’t find you despite searching for you with the City Lord. I really have no face to stand before you.”

Kang Si Ran’s expression was sincere and those were heartfelt words.

After all, he had become a Dao Source Realm Cultivator thanks to the Dao Source Pill given to him by Yang Kai.

Moreover, Kang Si Ran detected faintly that the Dao Source Pill with Pill Veins didn’t just help him advance into the next Great Realm and it had also altered something within him.

He couldn’t describe with words what it had altered, but he could still feel that the First-Order Dao Source Realm wasn’t the end of his Martial Path and he still had hope to advance further and peer into the Emperor Realm’s mysteries.

This wasn’t any different than giving him a new lease of life, and he felt like he would never be able to repay this great favour.

Yang Kai’s favour wasn’t any different than a mountain weighing on his shoulders, yet when Yang Kai was facing grave danger, he was in the dark, and he felt very ashamed of himself.

However, upon seeing that Yang Kai was safe and sound, he finally felt a lot better.

Yang Kai said earnestly, “Brother Kang, thanks for your concern!”

“Please don’t thank me...” Kang Si Ran scratched his face.

“Shopkeeper Kang, you’ve got a good relationship with Brother Yang,” Duan Yuan Shan’s voice reached them, as he entered the room, followed closely by Mo Xiao Qi.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Mo Xiao Qi’s eyes lit up and she stuck out her tongue sheepishly. She said, “I wanted to come alone, but when City Lord Duan and Shopkeeper Kang heard that you had come back, they insisted on following me here...”

“Miss Mo Xiao Qi, that isn’t your fault, I’m the one to blame for coming uninvited. Brother Yang, I hope that I didn’t disturb your rest.” Duan Yuan Shan chuckled and spoke.

“City Lord Duan, you don’t have to treat me as a stranger,” Yang Kai smiled and nodded at Mo Xiao Qi. “Our room is simple and crude, and you can sit wherever you see fit.”

Duan Yuan Shan didn’t act with reservation and he just picked a chair and sat down, while Mo Xiao Qi and Kang Si Ran had also done the same.

After they all took their seats, Duan Yuan Shan said with a solemn expression, “Brother Yang, I have to apologize to you.”

“City Lord, what do you mean?” Yang Kai acted dumb and asked in confusion.

Duan Yuan Shan said, “At that time, Zhuang Pan escaped and the Black Tortoise Seven Sections Array collapsed by itself, while you got corrupted by Demon Qi, and I couldn’t save you in time. I really couldn’t get over it and I feel ashamed of myself every time I recall it.”

Yang Kai shook his head and said, “City Lord Duan, it isn’t as grave as you said. I was well aware of the situation then, and it wasn’t your fault.”

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s statement, Duan Yuan Shan said with a smile, “Brother Yang, you’re a sensible and just man.”

“Humph, you’re only a spineless coward,” Kang Si Ran next to them spoke indignantly.
