On Pure Ice Island, countless disciples shivered as the sturdy barriers all around them had long been destroyed by the terrifying explosions.

The current Pure Ice Island was almost completely undefended.

Luo Li’s face darkened when she realized this and shouted in a low voice, “Quickly make all disciples enter the underground secret rooms for refuge!”

Bing Long was also in a daze, but quickly reacted to these words and took out a communication artifact she then poured her Divine Sense into.

In short order, all of Ice Heart Valley’s disciples received the order and fled to the Sect’s underground chambers.

Only Bing Long and the dozen or so Elders remained beside Luo Li as they shivered, watching the terrifying battle taking place in front of them.

Only with Luo Li protecting them did they have the courage to stand where they were.

Above the clouds, at a location beyond where their eyes could reach, two extraordinary auras were clashing, these belonged to Yang Kai, Su Yan, and Luo Hai!

(Leo: In case anyone was confused, Yang Kai and Su Yan’s auras converged into one previously)

Although the Elders were unable to see the situation from where they stood, from the pitiful cries Luo Hai let out from time to time, it was easy to infer he was at a complete disadvantage.

From the clouds above, drops of blood which contained immense energy rained down occasionally, each droplet like a round gem that smashed open large craters whenever they hit the ground.

This was the blood of an Origin King Realm master!

“Supreme Elder...” Bing Long trembled, “What is the situation now?”

Luo Li’s beautiful eyes flashed as she stared into the void and whispered, “Luo Hai’s fate looks grim.”

The crowd was terrified when they heard this and could barely believe their ears.

Luo Hai was a Second-Order Origin King, so even if his opponent was a Third-Order Origin King, he would likely not die. With Luo Hai’s strength, even if he could not defeat his opponent, he should be able to make an escape and stage a comeback.

However, Luo Li had evaluated Luo Hai’s fate as grim.

This was indirectly saying it was highly likely that Luo Hai would die here today!

Could it be that Yang Kai and Su Yan, who united in body and mind, now had combat power that exceeded a Third-Order Origin King? Was this the true might of a Star Emperor Token? For a moment, everyone was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s laughter echoed through the sky again, accompanied by a litany of Luo Hai’s angry curses.

The entire sky was in chaos, as waves of Space Force distorted the battlefield and massive Void Cracks shuttled back and forth, swallowing everything in their path.

Red blood constantly splashed and fell on the icy peaks of Pure Ice Island.

The devastating energy released from the clash caused many ice peaks to collapse and threw all of Pure Ice Island into chaos.

Bing Long and the others were deeply shocked as this kind of battle had rapidly moved into a realm they could no longer comprehend. Even if they wanted to watch, they could not see anything clearly or even feel anything aside from the fallout, making it impossible for them to gain any insight from it.

Only Luo Li could barely see something.

However, as time passed, the space and the flow of energy up in the sky grew more chaotic, to the point even she could not follow the situation.

Luo Hai’s curses had long ago ceased as he seemingly lacked the spare energy to even do that.

However, his aura was obviously weakening.

“Death!” Suddenly, Yang Kai’s shout rang out, together with Luo Hai’s panicked screams.

A shocking explosion occurred that sent out powerful shockwaves in the next moment.

Large amounts of blood fell from the sky like rain, together with some broken limbs and hashed meat.

The aura belonging to Luo Hai suddenly vanished.

Luo Li’s pupils shrank to the size of needle tips as her tender body could not help trembling.

She was well aware of what had just happened.

The earth-shaking battle subsided at that moment, but the Elders of Ice Heart Valley did not dare to even breath, all of them staring up into the sky in horror.

The chaotic battlefield began to clear as the massive Void Cracks slowly repaired themselves.

Gradually, a ball of light that was a blend of gold and white appeared before everyone’s vision, while there was no sign of Luo Hai anywhere to be seen.

There seemed to be a gaze projecting from the mass of light, overlooking everything below it.

This gaze was cold and merciless, with a hint of murderous intent mixed into it.

All those who fell under this gaze could not help shuddering.

Luo Li could not stop herself from inhaling sharply as she felt her heart leap up into her throat.

However, she soon felt relieved as this cold gaze quickly turned away and a shocking dragon roar and phoenix cry sounded before the mass of light flashed and suddenly disappeared.

No one knew where it had gone.

The Elders of Ice Heart Valley were unable to regain their composure for quite some time, and none of them dared to speak, all of them simply releasing their Divine Senses to carefully survey their surroundings.

It was not until half a day later, as the mass of light still did not appear, that they gradually relaxed.

Yang Kai apparently had no intentions of acting ruthlessly. Otherwise, Pure Ice Island would definitely have been filled with rivers of blood.

.....

Green Mountains Star, Star Master Shrine.

In the centre of the Star Master Shrine, there was a huge square, and at the centre of this square stood a statue about a hundred meters tall. This statue was carved extremely vividly and possessed an almost lifelike charm.

The statue was naturally of Luo Hai.

As a Star Master, Luo Hai had such a privilege. This statue was a symbol of his status as Green Mountains Star’s Star Master.

Below the statue, many cultivators sat cross-legged and seemed to be comprehending something from the statue.

Suddenly, there was a cracking sound. This cracking was immediately noticed, and the cultivators sitting in front of the statue frowned, opened their eyes, and looked around, wondering where this sound came from, but none of them were able to discover where it originated.

Just as they were about to close their eyes and continue their comprehension, however, another cracking sound occurred, this time clearer than before.

It was at this point that everyone finally turned their heads up towards the giant statue.

After a single glance, everyone was thoroughly stunned!

“Sir Luo Hai’s statue has cracked!”

“What? Impossible! How could there be cracks in Sir Luo Hai’s statue?”

“This statue is closely connected to the Star Source and Sir Luo Hai’s own aura! Since it’s cracked, could Sir Luo Hai be in some kind of danger?”

“Nonsense, Sir Luo Hai is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master and has profound cultivation, how could he have encountered any kind of danger... oh, there really is a crack.”

News spread like the wind and instantly forced all the cultivators who were present seeking enlightenment to awaken. These thousands of cultivators all looked up, and seeing the cracks gradually increase and widen, they could not help feeling stunned and panicked.

“Everyone, rest assured, Sir Luo Hai is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, even if he encounters danger, he will surely be able to overcome it and come back safely, there’s no need to panic.”

“Exactly! How could a master like Sir Luo Hai fall so easily? Don’t make a fuss.” Someone immediately agreed, obviously admiring Luo Hai extremely.

However, as soon as this person’s voice fell, the huge human-shaped statue suddenly released a loud noise and burst apart, with giant pieces of it falling to the ground.

The closer cultivators gawked in shock, but quickly their eyes shrank, and they used their Movement Skills to flee.

*Hong long long...*

When the statue collapsed, the entire square shook as a cloud of dust flew up into the air.

At the same time, all of Green Mountains Star seemed to tremble and all those who possessed slightly higher strength immediately noticed that the World Energy of Green Mountains Star seemed to be weaker than before.

“Sir Luo Hai... fell?” Atop the square, thousands of cultivators with different levels of cultivation realized what had happened after experiencing a brief period of silence and consternation.

With this statue being closely connected to Luo Hai and the Star Source of Green Mountains Star, if the statue was destroyed, there was only one plausible explanation.

Luo Hai died!

No one could believe it! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

How could such a powerful cultivator like Luo Hai die?

“Who did it? Which bastard did it? Someone tell me now so I can rip him into ten thousand pieces!” Someone shouted angrily as his face twisted in rage.

“Whoever killed Sir Luo Hai is the eternal enemy to all of Green Mountains Star!!”

“Everyone, we must punish the criminal!”

In the square, countless cultivators roared with indignation.

Luo Hai had nothing to do with most of them, and most had never even met him before, but he was still the Star Master of Green Mountains Star. With the Star Master falling, Green Mountains Star would also be affected. The drop in World Energy density on the star could not be recovered in short order, unless another Origin King came to Green Mountains Star and successfully refined its Star Source that is.

In other words, the fall of Luo Hai had caused a certain degree of loss to every cultivator on Green Mountains Star.

Whoever killed Luo Hai was naturally their enemy now.

As many cultivators shouted angrily, others wore solemn expressions as they took out their communication artifacts, poured their Divine Senses into them, and sent the shocking news to their relatives and friends.

One day later, everyone on Green Mountains Star knew that Star Master Luo Hai had fallen!

After one month, the news spread throughout the Star Field!

The entire Star Field shook!

There were many different opinions about Luo Hai’s death. Some people claimed that one of the Star Field’s old monsters who had not shown their face for thousands of years had killed Luo Hai. Others said that Luo Hai broke into some dangerous place and failed to escape. As for what the truth was, no one knew.

However, this was still explosive news. The number of Origin Kings in the Star Field was not very large, and the death of any of them was a sensational event.

What’s more, the Star Master of Green Mountains Star, Luo Hai, who died this time, was a Second-Order Origin King.

News soon reached Scarlet Wave Star, where Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder Luo Li had ordered all disciples of the Sect not to leak a word of what happened that day. Otherwise, she would personally take action to clean up the Sect. Naturally, none dared challenge her command.

In all honesty, only the top dozen or so Ice Heart Valley Elders actually knew what transpired that day, while the ordinary disciples knew nothing. They only knew that a terrifying battle had suddenly erupted over Pure Ice Island, but as for who was fighting, and what the outcome of the battle was, they were completely in the dark.
