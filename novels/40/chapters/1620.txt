“If it was just about rejecting those people’s offers, Sect Master wouldn’t be so anxious. This is a matter of personal choice, so even if they felt uncomfortable, they wouldn’t sully their own reputations by acting wickedly.”

“It’s not just about this,” Yang Kai shook his head, “The matter of them trying to win us over isn’t of concern, what I’m worried about is something else.”

“What?” Lin Yu Rao asked.

“I’m afraid someone has set their eyes on us,” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

There were various signs that Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, Luo Hai had some understanding of what transpired inside the Blood Prison. This was related to an Origin Essence Crystal, so Yang Kai didn’t dare act carelessly.

If the Origin Essence Crystal was still in his hands, everything would be fine. At worst, he could simply hand it over to Luo Hai to keep everyone safe, but now the Origin Essence Crystal was no longer in his possession, as he had already given it to Yu Xiong.

Having lost this bargaining chip, how could Yang Kai dare to remain here any longer?

If not for Qian Tong still needing some time to emerge from his current state, Yang Kai would have left immediately.

Yang Kai didn’t explain in detail, but from his tone and demeanour, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others could infer that the matter was serious, so they didn’t ask anymore and simply decided to follow Yang Kai.

Qian Tong was still standing in the distance, motionless, most likely immersed in some kind of comprehension.

With nothing else to do for now, Yang Xiu Zhu and the others sat down cross-legged to meditate and digest their harvests from the Blood Prison trip.

Although they did not obtain a chance to break through to the Origin King Realm like Qian Tong, it didn’t mean they gained nothing. On the contrary, everyone had obtained significant benefits, and as long as there were enough opportunities in the future, they still had a chance to be able to reach the Origin King Realm.

Yang Kai’s expression changed constantly as various thoughts flashed across his mind. He kept imagining different situations which might happen in the coming days and was planning out how to cope with them.

Time passed slowly, and three days later, Zhao Tian Ze returned with Qian Yue.

After seeing Yang Kai, Qian Yue was naturally extremely happy, but when she remembered that she had been searching for clues on Green Mountains Star for several years but found nothing related to Su Yan and the other’s whereabouts, Qian Yue couldn’t help feeling depressed.

Zhao Tian Ze did not stay long; after delivering Qian Yue here, he hurried back to Green Water City.

When the Blood Prison opened this time, he had entered together with the Vice City Lord of Green Water City. Unfortunately, the Vice City Lord, who was also a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, fell inside the Blood Prison.

This was a serious matter.

Zhao Tian Ze needed to return to Green Water City promptly to choose a new Vice City Lord.

Time flowed on, and another five days later, Qian Tong’s laughter rang out, prompting all the waiting people to look over in his direction.

In a flicker, Qian Tong appeared in front of everyone with a smile on his face.

“Congratulations Elder Qian,” Yang Xiu Zhu cupped his fists and congratulated.

“Elder Qian has successfully broken through to the Origin King Realm. This is a grand event my Shadowed Star has not witnessed in over ten thousand years! Shadow Moon Hall will definitely rejoice, as will all cultivators on Shadowed Star,” Mo Yu chuckled.

“All of you are too serious,” Qian Tong shook his head. “This time this Qian barely managed to escape death. If not for Yang Kai, I would have fallen long ago rather than broken through.”

Saying so, he turned to look straight at Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, this old master owes you another favour!”

At that time, if it wasn’t for the item inside the jade bottle Yang Kai gave him, which allowed him to rapidly strengthen his vitality and heal his wounds, how could Qian Tong have persisted until the end?

Qian Tong knew that what Yang Kai gave him was Life Revitalizing Jade Cream! He and Fei Zhi Tu had seen it once before after all.

Together with Soul Cleansing Divine Water and Immortal Source Liquid, these treasures were known as the Star Field’s Three Great Divine Waters, and every drop was incredibly precious.

The bottle Yang Kai gave him, however, had at least twenty drops inside of it.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that his breakthrough being successful was due in large part to Yang Kai’s assistance.

“Elder Qian is too polite,” Yang Kai chuckled, “Good, this isn’t a place to stay and talk, it’s important we leave quickly.”

“Leave now?” Qian Tong frowned.

“Now!”

“Okay!” Qian Tong didn’t raise any objections and simply followed Yang Kai’s lead.

“There are too many of us to move quickly, come in first!” Yang Kai said, summoning the Sealed World Bead.

Everyone knew what Yang Kai meant and they naturally cooperated, relaxing their guards and not resisting.

Yang Kai opened the Sealed World Bead and in a flash of light, almost everyone was pulled into it.

“You don’t need to bring this old master in,” Qian Tong smiled lightly, “I just made a breakthrough, so this old master would like to feel the surrounding World Principles for a while longer.”

Hearing what he said, Yang Kai didn’t want to force him, simply nodding and reminding, “Sure... But if there is any danger...”

“This old master is now an Origin King, what possible danger could there be?” Qian Tong laughed, not paying it much mind.

A trace of anxiety appeared between Yang Kai’s brow, but he didn’t try to explain, instead just signalling to Qian Tong, summoning his Star Shuttle, and setting out towards the Starry Sky.

While they were still on Green Mountains Star, Yang Kai didn’t dare to summon the Starship casually. Once an Origin King Grade Starship appeared, Luo Hai would immediately be alarmed.

The speed of the two was extremely fast, and while Yang Kai was filled with worries, Qian Tong was feeling quite spirited, feeling everything around him and even showing a thoughtful expression now and then.

The moment they set out, in a city thousands of kilometres away, inside the City Lord’s Mansion, Old Jiu and the other Origin Kings were chatting amongst themselves, exchanging their cultivation experiences while passing the time.

They had all remained here because they wanted to meet with Qian Tong!

Qian Tong was a newly promoted Origin King, and they all thought that the other party would come to find them; after all, each Origin King would have many things they did not understand after they broke through, and if someone was willing to answer their questions, they would naturally not want to miss the opportunity.

None of them had expected Yang Kai to act so decisively and immediately leave Green Mountains Star.

Luo Hai was sitting at the head of the room, occasionally speaking a few words which would garner him the admiration of Old Jiu and the others present.

Suddenly, Luo Hai frowned and revealed a look of surprise.

“Sir Luo Hai, what happened?” The old woman surnamed Lei looked at him and asked curiously.

“This King has something he must deal with, excuse me!” Luo Hai said before his figure flickered and disappeared without a trace.

“What matter would require Brother Luo Hai to suddenly just disappear?” Old Jiu and the others looked at each other at a loss.

“From the look on his face, it seems something major has happened. Could some kind of accident have occurred here?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It couldn’t be. Brother Luo Hai is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master, so who would dare act presumptuously here, on his home turf!?”

“That’s right, haha, it seems I am overthinking things. On the other hand, why hasn’t that newly promoted Origin King arrived yet? “We’ve been waiting here for several days now, he couldn’t have run away, right?”

“Why would he try to run? We have no malicious intent towards him and can even teach him some of our experiences for free. As long as he is not a fool, he would not reject such a good offer.”

“Then let’s continue waiting.”

.....

Above Green Mountains Star, Yang Kai and Qian Tong flew out as swift as the wind, trying to escape from the star’s radius.

Suddenly, however, Qian Tong frowned and shouted, “Yang Kai!”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

“I feel as if I‘m being watched!” Qian Tong frowned, expanding his Divine Sense like a tide but failing to notice anything, making him even more puzzled.

He had just made a breakthrough and was feeling quite proud of himself, so suddenly feeling like this was quite uncomfortable.

“Pretend like you haven’t noticed anything!” Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to silently tell him.

“Yang Kai, do you know something?” Qian Tong also replied with his Divine Sense.

“I have a fair idea!” Yang Kai’s face turned ugly, “If I’m not mistaken, it is Green Mountains Star’s Star Master Luo Hai who is staring at us!”

“Him!?” Qian Tong’s face changed drastically, “Why would he be looking for us?”

“Not us, me!” Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “He thinks I have something he needs.”

“What should we do then?” Qian Tong asked in surprise.

Being stared at by such a master caused even Qian Tong to start panicking. While he was now an Origin King, he had only broken through a few days ago. As for Luo Hai though, he was a master at the Second-Order Origin King Realm as well as the Star Master of Green Mountains Star.

Qian Tong had no doubt that on Green Mountains Star, if this opponent wanted to take his life, he could do so with a wave of his hand.

“We need to quickly leave this damned place. As long as we escape from the constraints of Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, Luo Hai will be nothing but an ordinary Second-Order Origin King! Only then will we have a chance to survive,” Yang Kai declared clearly.

Qian Tong heard this and nodded lightly.

As long as they were beyond the reach of Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, Luo Hai would not be so terrifying and they may be able to escape from him.

Thinking so, the pair increased their speed greatly.

“You want to leave Green Mountains Star?” In the distance, Luo Hai seemed to be aware of their intentions and grinned faintly, “A good idea, but you are far too naive.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and gently grabbed forward, causing a strange change in the atmosphere as he did.

Yang Kai and Qian Tong, who were tens of thousands of kilometres away, suddenly had their faces go pale and their bodies come to a halt, like they had been struck by lightning.

Looking out towards the endless Starry Sky, Yang Kai grit his teeth secretly and desperately pushed his Saint Qi and Shi, trying to get rid of the invisible shackles binding him, but to his shock, he was still completely incapable of moving.

It was as if the surrounding space had been frozen solid.

This was the power of a Star Master!

[Just a bit further!]

Yang Kai could feel that he and Qian Tong only needed to travel a bit further to escape Green Mountains Star’s World Principles, but at this last moment, they were actually blocked.

Qian Tong seemed to be in a better condition than Yang Kai, at least he could still circulate his Saint Qi properly and glance around while shouting, “Who’s there!”

A figure appeared silently not far in front of Yang Kai and Qian Tong, with a golden crown on his head and a golden robe covering his body. Naturally, it was Luo Hai.

Shooting a glance towards Qian Tong indifferently, a hint of approval flashed across his eyes.

As a freshly broken through Origin King, even though Qian Tong’s realm was not yet stabilized, being able to remain even somewhat mobile was quite a feat. If given enough time, Qian Tong would surely reach the Second-Order Origin King Realm.

However, he didn’t pay too much attention to Qian Tong and quickly turned his gaze back towards Yang Kai.

His main purpose for coming here was Yang Kai!

Above that patch of wilderness, there were too many people around and it would not have been appropriate for him to act against Yang Kai, but now that these two had left Green Mountains Star and come to the edge of the Starry Sky, Luo Hai could act without restraint.
