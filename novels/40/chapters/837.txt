– Chapter 838, Dragon Emperor’s Prestige

Sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, Chen Zhou didn’t find any other Saint Realm masters nearby and couldn’t help feeling confused. The Silver Leaf, which had wrapped up Yu Ting Yi and flown into the Dragon Phoenix Palace, quickly returned and once again transformed into a burst of light, revealing two figures, one old, one young.

This light halo was dazzling to behold and contained radiated strong energy fluctuations, seeming to contain enormous power.

Bai Jing Chu and Yan Zhi of Frozen Nether Cave Heaven both narrowed their eyes as they stared at this pair of newcomers suspiciously. They quickly discovered that these two people who had suddenly broke into the battlefield were not nearly as strong as they had anticipated.

The old man was only a First Order Transcendent and appeared to already have one foot in the grave, probably unable to put forward much battle strength.

The young one on the other hand was bursting with vitality, but was only an Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage kid, far weaker than even the dying old man.

Ordinarily, Bai Jing Chu and Yan Zhi wouldn’t even spare these two a second glance, but the intense light halo surrounding them was not something they could simply ignore.

After all, this halo was formed by an artifact that had just rescued Yu Ting Yi. Yan Zhi, who had made contact with this artifact, was well aware of its power.

At the very least, it was a Saint Grade Mid-Rank artifact!

This was a treasure even Yan Zhi would drool over. There were only two Saint Grade artifacts in Frozen Nether Cave Heaven and both of them were only Low-Rank. Yang Zhi and Bai Jing Chu had both paid an incredible price to have a Grandmaster refine them.

In order to refine these two artifacts, Bai Jing Chu and Yan Zhi had nearly emptied Frozen Nether Cave Heaven’s coffers and had only managing to restore the Sect’s finances recently after many years of saving.

What kind of background did this old and young pair have? With such poor cultivation levels they were actually using such tyrannical artifacts.

As Bai Jing Chu and Yan Zhi were both lost in thought, Chen Zhou’s eyes shrank as he unconsciously shouted, “Sun Yu?”

At a glance, he recognized the young boy as the disciple who had entered Dragon Valley two years ago, while the old man standing next to him was none other than Ling Jian who had been guarding the entrance to Dragon Valley.

But why had this Master and disciple pair come out from Dragon Valley and rush to this chaotic battlefield?

Chen Zhou was incredibly anxious, worried about the injury Yu Ting Yi had suffered and also about Sun Yu, who had suddenly appeared in front of a strong enemy. Because of these concerns, Chen Zhou’s movements became somewhat dull and suffered a hit from Bai Jing Chu whom he was engaged in battle with, in an instant finding himself somewhat suppressed.

“Sun Yu?” Yan Zhi beady eyes swept the boy in front of him and muttered, “I heard that the boy who entered Dragon Valley bore that name... Little brat, are you that person?”

“So what if I am, old dog?” Sun Yu replied unafraid, not only acknowledging his identity but also insulting Yan Zhi.

Yan Zhi wasn’t angered though and instead let out a burst of laughter, “Haha, you really wear out iron shoes while seeking one’s own feet. This old master was worried those people wouldn’t be able to find you, but unexpectedly you’ve come to deliver yourself to me, very good, very good.”

“You mean those five Transcendents you sent to Dragon Valley?” Sun Yu sneered.

“How do you know about them?” Yan Zhi’s eyes narrowed and suddenly felt that something about this situation was off. Facing a master like himself, this youngster was far too calm, rather it was the old First Order Transcendent beside him that couldn’t bear to look Yan Zhi in the eye, seemingly under great pressure.

“Of course I know about them,” Sun Yu grinned meaningfully, “Because they died... died at my hands!”

“Died at your hand?” Yan Zhi stared dumbfounded for a moment before smirking and slowly shaking his head, “Boy, do you think this old master will believe the nonsense you just spouted? Before trying to act tough you should first consider your own weight!”

Five Transcendents, each of them not weak, being killed by a mere Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh Stage brat? Although the artifact protecting him wasn’t ordinary, Yan Zhi didn’t believe Sun Yu had such great ability.

“Believe what you like, but the next to die will be you,” Sun Yu coldly snorted.

“Kid...” Yan Zhi laughed dumbly and said in a mocking tone, “You shouldn’t anger this old master, angering me won’t bring you any advantage. Although this old master won’t kill you, making you suffer a little bitterness isn’t an issue. Now, obediently surrender yourself so this old master doesn’t have to act impolite!”

Chen Zhou, who was still fighting Bai Jing Chu, obviously overheard this conversation and couldn’t help coughing up blood in anger as he shouted, “Ling Jian, you old coot! How could you allow Sun Yu to come here!?”

Even going all out now, Chen Zhou could barely tie down Bai Jing Chu while Yan Zhi could essentially move about unchecked; now that Sun Yu had appeared here, wasn’t the conclusion to this struggle already set?

Sun Yu was Dragon Phoenix Palace’s last hope; Ling Jian was really too ignorant.

“Palace Master, there is no need to worry!” Ling Jian was too timid to answer back but Sun Yu was not, clearly shouting, “Today, since disciple dares to come here, he has full confidence in his ability to resist! Since Frozen Nether Cave Heaven dares to invade my Dragon Phoenix Palace, they must pay the price in blood so they understand once and for all that we are not to be trifled with!” Saying so, he turned a fierce stare towards Yang Zhi and declared, “Old dog, you’re first!”

Sun Yu was young and impetuous, fully believing in Yang Kai’s words, so when he spoke just now he had done so loudly and without any hesitation. After the youth’s words passed out, all the cultivators who were fighting came to a halt and turned their attention towards him.

A moment later, the masters from Frozen Nether Cave Heaven burst into laughter as they began shouting words of mockery and ridicule while those from Dragon Phoenix Palace averted their eyes in shame.

To all of them, it seemed like this youth who had appeared out of nowhere was simply ignorant of the immensity of Heaven and Earth.

Yan Zhi was also greatly amused, crossing his arms before himself and wearing a look of self-aggrandization, “Boy, I’d like to see how you intend to make me pay. This old master will even stand here and not move so show me what you’ve got.”

“Heh heh, those five Transcendents also said something similar, that is... until they died...” Sun Yu laughed.

At that moment, a thunderous dragon roar rang out and an awe-inspiring burst of golden light shot into the sky.

Every cultivator below the Saint Realm was instantly blinded. Simultaneously, a pressure so overwhelming descended upon the crowd that many found themselves unable to breath for fear that if they made the slightest move they would be met with a swift and merciless death.

Even Yan Zhi, who had just been facing Sun Yu with a calm and relaxed look, immediately became alarmed.

From amidst the dazzling golden radiance, he sensed a massive object rush towards himself. Not daring to hesitate, Yan Zhi hurriedly gathered his strength to defend himself while at the same time summoning out a Spirit Grade Mid-Rank Grade defensive artifact.

If he didn’t go so far, he feared he would instantly be killed by whatever was approaching.

*Hong...*

Space itself seemed to collapse as a burst of violent energy erupted, sending out a powerful shockwave that blew away the surrounding clouds and toppled nearby trees.

Yan Zhi coughed out all the air in his lungs as he was sent flying like a paper kite. In that instant, he felt as if he had been struck by some giant irresistible force that crushed the meager strength he had managed to gather to protect himself. Recovering his balance, Yan Zhi heard a loud crack and glanced down only to see the Spirit Grade Mid-Rank artifact he had summoned nearly break in half while losing all function. It would need to undergo extensive repairs before it could be used again.

What was he hit with? Whatever it was, it had destroyed his Spirit Grade Mid-Rank defensive artifact with a single blow!

The golden radiance gradually began to subside and Yan Zhi finally saw what was attacking him.

His eyes shrank as he stared dumbfounded at the sight before him.

Hovering there midair was a hundred meter long Golden Dragon staring down at Yang Zhi. Its giant eyes were filled with contempt and disdain and under its gaze, Yang Zhi couldn’t help feeling a deep sense of humbleness and inferiority.

The Golden Dragon appeared sleek and agile and was covered in a layer of dazzling Golden Scales. These scales seemed impregnable, as if no attack could harm them. Its dragon claws also appeared extremely sharp and gave off a cold, murderous intent, making people not doubt that they weren’t inferior to even the highest-grade artifacts.

“An energy projection?” Yan Zhi frowned, but quickly denied his guess.

The Golden Dragon in front of him was too solid and too real, it was impossible for it to be a mere gathering of True Qi.

In other words, what stood before him, was a real dragon!

This was a king of the Monster Race, a legendary existence that could reach the Ninth-Order!

Yan Zhi had heard that the Monster Race had several Great Seniors, each of them Peak Eighth-Order Monster Beasts, and that one or two of them were distant descendants of True Dragons which was what had allowed them to reach such a height.

To the Monster Race, the True Dragon’s bloodline was the most noble of lineages.

Those Great Seniors were able to acquire strength equivalent to that of Peak Third Order Saints because of this pedigree, and now a real True Dragon was in front of Yan Zhi.

This was a legendary Ninth-Order Monster Emperor, an existence that far surpassed this world’s greatest experts.

Feeling the blazing energy pulsing from the Golden Dragon, Yan Zhi couldn’t stop himself from shivering.

Yan Zhi stood dumbly in place, Ling Jian who came with Sun Yu was also dumbstruck, his whole body trembling as he kept wiping his old dull eyes, seemingly trying to confirm if what he was seeing was some kind of hallucination.

Even Sun Yu wore a look of pure excitement, his eyes filled with worship as if he couldn’t wait to bow down and pay tribute to this majestic being.

“The power of the Dragon Emperor!” On the other hand, Chen Zhou couldn’t help shouting out as he stared absentmindedly towards the Golden Dragon. How couldn’t believe that a day had come where he could witness such a scene, nor could he believe that the young Sun Yu was actually capable of achieving this.

Two years ago, this common disciple was still unknown and only had a trivial True Element Boundary Seventh Stage cultivation. Although he had then managed to obtain the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance, Chen Zhou estimated that even if he was safe, Dragon Phoenix Palace would have to vigorously cultivate him for dozens of years before he really matured.

But unexpectedly, today, Sun Yu, who had just emerged from Dragon Valley, was capable of facing off against a genuine Saint Realm master and also summoning for the Dragon Emperor’s power.

Chen Zhou burst into a fit of joyous laughter, feeling like he wouldn’t mind even if he were to die right now because he had finally fulfilled his ancestors’ greatest wish.

Bai Jing Chu wasn’t in any mood to pester Chen Zhou, only capable of staring dumbly up towards the giant Golden Dragon, a sense of shock and awe filling his heart.

All the cultivators who had formerly been fighting with their lives on the line had completely stopped as they watched this sensational scene.

A huge panic and unease soon began to spread throughout the cultivator from Frozen Nether Cave Heaven, as if a great winter storm had suddenly descended upon them.
