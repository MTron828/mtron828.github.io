Nevertheless, He Yun Xiang didn’t understand why Yan Luo would want to follow Yang Kai to the Ancestral Domain. If he really wanted to play a trick on them, why would he want to tag along?

“We’ll see how things go.” Naturally, Yang Kai wouldn’t be afraid even if the Yan Family had come up with a plot against him.

However, he had unsealed some of his cultivation on this day, so he was a bit anxious to suppress it again, as he could already feel the hostility coming from the world around him.

Ten days passed just like that.

In the morning, countless people were standing at the base of the twin summit. Almost all of the Yan Family’s important people had gathered in this place. All of them were standing close to each other in the square in front of a black Starship.

Basically, everyone had found out that the Patriarch was heading to the Ancestral Domain. This was an important event for the Yan Family, as it had been 500 years since the last clansman left for Ancestral Domain. Moreover, no one knew if he had actually reached his destination. This time, the Patriarch suddenly announced that he would step down and follow his Old Ancestor’s footsteps to pursue a higher Martial Dao and explore a greater world. After the news spread, everyone from the Yan Family was shocked.

Thousands of people had gathered in this place to see the Patriarch off.

Only a small number of people in the Yan Family were aware of what happened ten days ago. They knew that on that day, the Patriarch and the Great Elder were humiliated, and the Second Elder was even killed. These people were all leaders among the Yan Family though, so they wouldn’t spread the news. That was why the Yan Family’s people who had come here on this day had no idea what happened ten days ago. When Yan Luo appeared, all of them looked at him in admiration.

If they found out that the Patriarch had begged for a young man’s mercy ten days ago, they would probably lose all respect for him.

At that moment, Yang Kai and He Yun Xiang were walking at the front. The Yan Family’s disciples had a doubt about it, as they had no idea who these two people were. They just felt that the attitude of the Patriarch and the Elders towards these two was quite odd.

A moment later, they all boarded the Starship. After a loud hum and a strong energy fluctuation, the Starship rose into the air and shot into the vast Starry Sky.

It wasn’t until the Starship disappeared from everyone’s sight that the other people reluctantly left the place.

The former Great Elder, who was now the Yan Family’s Patriarch, Yan An, gave some instructions to the others before he too went back.

Once inside a certain palace, Yan An stepped into a secret room where a conspicuous lantern was placed. The lantern was aged and worn, but although no one knew how long it had been sitting there, there was no dust on it at all.

There were no other things in this secret room besides the lantern, a table, and an incense burner.

Yan An’s solemn expression was that of a sincere pilgrim. Then, he took out an incense stick from his Space Ring. The incense stick seemed to be custom-made. It was as thick as a thumb, and it was about as long as a forearm. No one knew what it was made of, but it exuded a pleasant scent even though it hadn’t been burned yet.

With the incense stick in his hand, Yan An thought about what Yan Luo had told him a few days ago and a sense of determination flashed across his eyes, upon which he slashed at his own wrist with his fingers. A wound was immediately formed on the wrist as his blood streamed out of it.

Then, he placed the incense stick below his wrist and let it be soaked with his blood until it became scarlet.

One hour later, the incense stick’s colour had changed completely. It was like a leech that had sucked in enough blood. It was entirely scarlet now, and it looked quite malevolent.

Despite Yan An’s pale face, he was still very excited. He then performed a hand seal, pushed his Saint Qi, and gripped the incense stick tightly as he growled, “Ignite!”

A spark was lit up on the incense stick. It appeared to be burning, but the smoke wafting from it was red.

With the incense stick in his hands, Yan An wouldn’t dare to dawdle as he repeatedly bowed at the lantern and stuck the incense stick into the incense burner on the table.

At that instant, the place fell into silence, and Yan An’s breathing could hardly be heard. As the incense stick was burning, the red smoke wafting from it seemed to have been summoned as it flowed into the lantern. Moments later, the ancient-looking lantern seemed to be going through some changes as well.

When the incense stick was half-burned, a horrifying pressure descended from the sky all of a sudden. At the same time, two dots of light lit up in the lantern, resembling a pair of eyes.

Yan An was shaken to the core as he immediately fell on his knees respectfully, “Greetings, Old Ancestor.”

The dots of light in the lantern glinted repeatedly before they stabilized, upon which an old voice could be heard speaking from the lantern, “Yan An? We haven’t met for hundreds of years. Are you the Yan Family’s Patriarch now?”

Judging from his words, the person with the old voice apparently knew Yan An.

“Yes, Old Ancestor. I am the current Patriarch.”

“Where is Yan Luo? I remember that when I left home in the past, it was Yan Luo who was in charge of the family. It’s only been a few hundred years. Please don’t tell me that he’s dead.”

Yan An hurriedly replied, “He is not dead. It’s just that he has stepped down as the Patriarch and has headed for the Ancestral Domain.”

“He’s coming to Ancestral Domain? It’s unexpected of him to have taken this initiative. I have to congratulate him, then.” The old voice sounded joyful, but it soon turned grim, “Wait a moment. Did you summon me just to tell me about this?”

If that was the case, they were basically making a big fuss over a trivial matter. Before the Old Ancestor left Unending Star Field in the past, he told them not to bother him if it wasn’t a matter of utmost importance.

Yan An bowed to him again and sobbed, “Old Ancestor, our family has been humiliated, so we must ask you to obtain justice for us.”

The aura in the lantern turned murderous all of a sudden as the old voice was heard speaking in a stern voice, “Tell me about it in detail!”

…

One month had passed since they set off on their journey.

It had been smooth sailing as they navigated through the Starry Sky inside the Yan Family’s Starship. The huge ‘Yan’ on the Starship was the best travel pass in this world, as no one would dare to attack a Yan Family Starship. The Star Pirates would immediately run at the mere sight of such a ship.

In the past month, Yang Kai had been living a relaxed life. He had read many ancient books and gained a lot of new knowledge.

Yan Luo would visit Yang Kai every day with precious food and drinks. Yang Kai wouldn’t turn him down, but he had rejected some women who had been assigned to serve him.

On this day, He Yun Xiang knocked on the door and stepped into the room.

Seeing that her aura was stable, and her skin was radiant, Yang Kai knew that she had managed to consolidate her realm.

“Have we reached our destination?”

She replied, “Yan Luo said we’re about to reach there soon.”

“Good, let’s go take a look.” Yang Kai was curious about the method and route to enter the Ancestral Domain. Although it might not be the same for Heng Luo Star Field, he could still learn from this experience and it might turn out to be useful in the future.

They soon reached the control centre of the Starship. Many disciples of the Yan Family were guarding the active arrays and there was a tinge of excitement in their solemn expressions. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

All of them knew where they were heading to as they secretly thanked Yan Luo for choosing them to come along. This way, they could explore the beauty of the Ancestral Domain earlier than the others.

Seeing Yang Kai, all of them immediately bowed to him.

Yan Luo approached him and greeted, “Senior, the Star in front of us is where the entrance to the Ancestral Domain is located.”

Yang Kai looked in that direction and asked curiously, “A Dead Star?”

The Star was dim, and as they were looking at it from the Starry Sky, they could see that it appeared desolate. There was an innumerable number of such Dead Stars in each Star Field. No one could have expected that this Star was the key to entering the Ancestral Domain.

With a smile, Yan Luo replied, “This is why not many people are aware of the method to enter the Ancestral Domain.”

There was no World Energy on the Dead Star at all, so no one would attempt to investigate it. Even if they passed by, they would immediately leave this place. No one could have expected that the door to the Ancestral Domain was actually on this Dead Star.

“Your family is quite lucky to have discovered it.”

“Yes, we were indeed lucky,” Yan Luo grinned meaningfully without explaining anything. It was a coincidence that they had made such a discovery, and it traced back to many generations ago. Even he wasn’t sure how their ancestors had discovered and confirmed the gateway’s existence as a lot of information had been lost over the generations.

“Senior, please have a seat. If nothing goes wrong, we will soon reach the Ancestral Domain.” Yan Luo made a ‘please’ gesture.

Yang Kai nodded and took a seat on the side.

The Starship was slowly moving towards the Dead Star and descended in a particular direction before it entered a wide canyon. The canyon was so deep that it was as though it was a bottomless abyss. Some aboard were shocked to discover that they couldn’t sense the bottom with their Divine Sense.

Upon Yan Luo’s order, the Starship dove into the canyon, and soon, all they could see was endless darkness.

It was as though they were navigating through the gates of the Netherworld. The coldness seemed to have penetrated the Starship and made them shudder.

In such a hostile environment, even an Origin King Realm Master wouldn’t be able to survive for long. Only by relying on this Starship could they resist the depletion of their energy.

A long time later, Yang Kai’s expression changed suddenly as he hurriedly scanned the surroundings with his Divine Sense. He could feel a violent Space Principle fluctuation coming from the deepest part of the canyon.

Upon closer inspection, he knew that his speculation was right. There was a huge Void Crack at the bottom of the canyon. The crack was glowing dazzlingly, appearing very different from the other such phenomenon that he had come across before.

Yan Luo’s expression turned solemn in an instant as he personally controlled several arrays to activate the Starship’s defences.

Silently, the huge Starship flew into the Void Crack and disappeared, as though it had been gobbled up or had melted.

*Kacha…*

Just then, ominous noises could be heard from every direction and the expressions of everyone aboard the Starship changed instantly.

He Yun Xiang turned to look at Yan Luo in shock, but upon seeing that he remained unperturbed, she felt her heart freeze over.

It was said that a person shouldn’t bother about trifles if they wanted to achieve great things.

She wasn’t sure about the others in the Yan Family, but given her Third-Order Origin King Realm cultivation, she knew that this Starship wouldn’t last long. The Starship was now being squeezed by the horrible power surrounding them, and within an hour, it would certainly buckle and collapse.

By then, all of them in the Starship would be doomed except the Third-Order Origin Kings. Even He Yun Xiang wasn’t confident of escaping unscathed, so she could only place all her hope on Yang Kai.

Yan Luo must have known in advance that these other Yan Family members would die, but he still brought all 300 of them along to operate this Starship. The reason for it was that he wanted to take advantage of this Starship to exchange for an hour of safety in this passageway.

One month ago, these Yan Family members were still looking forward to the journey, which seemed laughable now. They wanted to explore the beauty of the Ancestral Domain, but they had never suspected that they were just tools to Yan An, ones he was well prepared to discard at any moment.
