Chapter 5977: The Right to Live

Once the darkness was unleashed, it was difficult to seal it up again.

While the 10 Martial Ancestors were fighting against the Early Ancient Era Great Monsters at the forefront of the battlefield, Mo subordinated batch after batch of helpers, leading the Human Race at the back and obtaining victory in every battle!

As time passed, it became stronger and stronger.

Mo had achieved what it vowed to do back then, to spread its name and make itself known to all of the Humans.

There was not much that it wanted from this, Mo just wished to end this war as soon as possible, then Mu would have more time to accompany it again

It was willing to use any means to achieve that goal, bestowing great power on the Humans who feared and avoided the war so that they could become fearless.

It even began to spread its power to the various Universe Worlds so that those people could become strong as quickly as possible.

All its hard work and dedication had been worthwhile.

Mu and the other 10 Martial Ancestors slayed many of the Early Ancient Era Great Monsters at the battlefront, achieving a full victory.

Meanwhile, the Human Race Army that Mo led was also very successful on each battlefield.

The living space for Monster Race was constantly being shrunk.

The Human Race was about to usher in their final victory.

Mo was overjoyed to see Mu again, whom it had not been able to see for many years. With great excitement, it told her about his efforts and achievements over the years, not noticing the troubled look in Mu’s eyes.

Mo made a wish in front of Mu, that they would never have to be separated again once the war was over.

Rubbing its head, Mu agreed. From then on, Mu would bring Mo along wherever she went.

Mo was no longer allowed to use the power it had used before, and it was no longer allowed to set foot on the battlefield, but it did not care.

Compared to being extolled by countless Humans and bending the disobedient ones to its will, Mo preferred simply staying quietly by Mu’s side.

The war finally came to an end and the Human Race emerged as the final victors, becoming the Masters of the Universe while the Early Ancient Era Great Monsters were almost slaughtered to extinction. Even though there were still Great Monsters left, it was no longer possible for them to stir up any waves.

Mu took Mo on a journey to witness the beauty and peace of the Universe, acting like true Brother and Sister. During that journey, Mu showered it with nothing but care.

Mo felt that even if it died at that time, it would have no regrets.

Many years later, Mo would ask itself many times why it really didn’t die in that beautiful memory, because its life would have been perfect if that was the case.

One day, Mu said she would bring it home, to visit the place where it was born.

Though it was reluctant to return to that place that had trapped it for so many years, Mo could not deny her since it was Mu who requested it.

The two of them travelled together, returning to that ancient land.

The other nine Big Brothers had already arrived and were waiting for them. After Mu led Mo there, it keenly sensed a massive Array being activated, sealing the void in all directions!

Mo did not understand what was going on.

Until Mu told him the truth.

Mo never would have thought that Mu would one day trick it like this!

Shock, anger, resentment… all sorts of complicated emotions overwhelmed it.

The reason Mu led it here was just so they could suppress and seal it here again, and that last journey would be its final fond experiences.

Mo’s heart felt as if it had been stabbed! The dependence and trust it once had turned into grief, causing Mo to lose its rationale for a moment.

The power that had been built up over the years was released, and Mo’s mind became completely twisted…

Under Mo’s influence, all the beings previously corrupted by his power were turned into slaves.

The Human Race, which had only been at peace for a few years, was once again thrust into an endless war…

…..

Inside the small house, Mo sighed faintly as its small figure grew rapidly, transforming into a handsome young man with delicate features in the blink of an eye.

He got up, walked out of the house, and looked up at the sky, his gaze absent as his mind drifted.

[Such an innocent memory from so long ago…]

Mu came out of the kitchen, wiped her hands on her apron, and looked at him with a faint smile, “Are you leaving?”

Mo turned his head and looked at Mu with a complicated gaze before nodding gently.

Mu said to him, “All these years, it was Sixth Sister who wronged you…”

Mo raised his hand to interrupt her, smiling back, “You did the right thing, Sixth Sister.”

“Huh?” Mu cocked her head at it in confusion.

Mo said, “I was too young then, mistakenly believing that I had full control of that power, but it proved to be too much for me to grasp. If you hadn’t suppressed and sealed me back then, I’m afraid the Human Race would be no more!”

Mu was stunned for a moment, then as if understanding something, her face paled slightly, “You mean…”

Mo sighed, “That power is the root, I am only its consciousness that has been born through many long years of accumulation. Even though you have taught me about all the wonderful things in the Universe, in the end, not everything is good in this world. No matter the kind of consciousness it birthed, its power will continue to grow, and one day even that consciousness will become its slave! When that happens, only one instinct will remain, to conquer and enslave everything! Just as the birth of the Black Ink Cult was inevitable in this world, so too was all this predestined.”

Hearing those words from it, Mu finally understood, “So, when the power was suppressed and sealed once more, it instead led you to rediscover yourself?”

“Exactly,” Mo grinned.

“Then now…”

Mo shook its head, “It will all return soon.”

“Sixth Sister, you have already fulfilled your promise. For that, I thank you!” Mo looked up at Mu, tears faintly welling in his eyes.

Mu promised back then that she would accompany him forever and keep him by her side wherever she went, and she had done exactly that and more. While she was alive, she was constantly watching over the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, and even in her death, the shadows she left behind continued to keep Mo company.

Mu tried to make one last effort, “If you like, we could go on like this.”

Mo shook his head sadly, “I can’t stop it, and besides, since I was born… I, too, should fight for my right to live!”

These words caused Mu’s heart to clench.

Every living being had the right to live since birth, to pursue the good things in life, but what if the existence of this being was in itself, a sin?

Mo looked at Mu with a deep gaze, as if he wanted to brand the figure before him into the deepest part of his mind, into his life, never to be forgotten. He then murmured softly, “Besides, a world without Sixth Sister… no longer needs to exist.”

Mo opened his arms as if to embrace the entire world.

Winds rose and clouds surged!

A black ray of light suddenly descended and entered Mo’s body, causing his aura to swell explosively.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This was followed by a second, then a third…

All the inhabitants of Dawn City looked up in shock, only to see an endless stream of black light coming from nowhere in the sky, falling incessantly towards a certain spot in the city where a terrifying aura was surging!

The inside of the Holy Temple of the Light Spirit Religion was a chaotic mess. The Order Lords wanted to go and find out what was going on, but they could barely even move their bodies when they felt that terrible power.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with horror.

The turbulent wind blew the small house down, but Mu stood still, completely untouched as Mo had enveloped her in a force that was protecting her.

…..

In the 2,639th World, Yang Kai managed to repel the attacking Black Ink Disciples together with Mu’s shadow, but not without difficulty. Just as he was about to use the Profound Source Gate to suppress and seal Mo’s Source piece, the seal opened by itself before he could even act and the piece inside turned into a black light that rushed into the sky, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

“This…” Yang Kai looked on in astonishment at what had just happened.

Mu’s shadow paled and she raised her hand, pressing her palm against Yang Kai’s chest before urging, “He has woken up. Quickly go to the Primordial World, that is the source of my power. Find the shadow I left there and she will tell you what to do.”

[Mo has awakened!]

Despite knowing that this would happen, Yang Kai could not help but feel his chest tightening when the time finally came.

Was it finally time to face the strongest existence in this Universe?

Yang Kai then silently comforted himself. Somewhere between 30% and 40% of Mo’s Source should be suppressed and sealed, so in other words, its Black Ink Strength had also been weakened by that much. Even so, was there anyone among them who could be a match for Mo?

If there was no way to defeat Mo, then all their previous efforts would be in vain.

It was too late to ask any more questions though, so under the pull of Mu’s power, he disappeared in a flash of light.

By this time, the battle outside the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction had subsided.

Zhang Ruo Xi had arrived, bringing with her not only the eight Ninth-Order Small Stone Race Personal Guard, but also a large army of hundreds of millions from the Small Stone Race Soldiers.

The Black Ink Clan at the opening of the Grand Restriction no longer dared to come out to fight, so how could the ones left outside be any match for the Humans?

The Small Stone Race regiments cut through the battlefield one by one, firstly dividing the Black Ink Clan Army before gradually pecking away at their forces. With the two Giant Spirit Gods rampaging through the battlefield, the Black Ink Clan Army was soon decimated.

If this were the past, then the Black Ink Clan Army might have fled if they were being so steeply suppressed.

But this place was the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, where the Source of the Black Ink Clan was, so where could they flee to? If they fought with their lives on the line, they could at least weaken the enemy and take some pressure off those still inside the Grand Restriction.

With this consideration in mind, the only end for those outside the Grand Restriction was death.

The Human Race soldiers who were still recuperating watched this scene from afar with mixed feelings.

What should have been a certain defeat had been turned around by the Small Stone Race Army, but this victory did not dictate the final outcome.

It may take an even more gruelling and brutal battle to actually win this war.

*Kacha…*

Suddenly, a strange sound came from the void. Before the Human Race Masters could figure out what was happening, they heard Wu Kuang’s grave voice call out, “Watch out! The Grand Restriction is about to break!”

*Kacha…*

The sound began to overlap more and more.

The Human Race Army stopped for a moment before immediately getting into formation.

As countless pairs of eyes watched on, cracks appeared in the endless darkness of the void, the lines becoming as dense as a spider web in the blink of an eye.

A figure had also emerged from somewhere in the Grand Restriction, hurriedly moving towards the Human Race Army.

It was Wu Kuang, who had been standing guard at the Grand Restriction for thousands of years.
