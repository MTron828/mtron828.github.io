“Huh?” Wu Chang frowned as he stared up blankly.

He couldn’t understand why this Pill Tribulation had been like a storm with loud thunder, but no rain. A moment ago, it was raging and the pressure was almost unbearable, but in the next instant the clouds parted and everything was calm.

No one was able to understand.

“Scram!”

At the moment when everyone had been lost in confusion, Yang Kai’s shout rang out and an astonishing surge of Source Qi flared up.

*Peng peng peng peng...*

It seemed he was fighting someone!

Hearing this movement, everyone’s expressions changed as they quickly turned their attention back to where Yang Kai was standing.

There, Yang Kai stood in place, one hand still on his Alchemy Furnace, the other palming in all directions, creating a flurry of afterimages.

Around him, a figure moved at high speed, trying to approach closer to where Yang Kai stood. It seemed this person wanted to break through Yang Kai’s blockage and snatch the Spirit Pills which had just been refined!

However, no matter how hard this person tried, he was unable to get within three metres of Yang Kai without being forced back.

“Luo Yuan!” Lan Xun’s brow furrowed as she whispered under her breath.

Naturally, she recognized the man who was fighting with Yang Kai was Luo Yuan of Eight Paths Sect!

She didn’t know where he had been hiding before, but clearly, when everyone’s attention had been attracted by the Pill Tribulation, he had stealthily dove in and tried to snatch all the Extraordinary Treasure Pills. Unfortunately, Yang Kai blocked him at the last moment, causing his plan to fall short.

It seemed he had underestimated Yang Kai’s strength, thinking that a mere First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator who had just finished a difficult refinement process wouldn’t be his opponent.

Luo Yuan quickly realized he was wrong after he acted though.

Standing in place, Yang Kai seemed to be stuck in an extremely passive situation, but upon closer inspection, it was clear he still had a lot of leeway to act. What’s more, his Source Qi was extremely dense and pure, making it impossible for Luo Yuan to break through his defence in short order.

[I miscalculated!]

Luo Yuan cursed to himself, knowing he had missed this opportunity.

He originally intended to grab the Extraordinary Treasure Pills and flee, but now he had been blocked by Yang Kai. Everyone else had recovered now, and if he did not retreat, Luo Yuan knew he would face everyone else’s besiegement.

Understanding this, Luo Yuan made a feint before lightly withdrawing a hundred metres, glaring at Yang Kai with a gloomy look, as if blaming him for ruining his good deed.

Although Yang Kai’s face was slightly pale, he still grinned and teased, “Brother Luo Yuan’s plans are quite deep. How long have you been waiting to make your move?”

“Hmph!” Luo Yuan snorted coldly and did not answer Yang Kai’s question directly, instead just saying, “You’re not ordinary yourself...”

What he meant was probably that Yang Kai’s true strength was completely inconsistent with his cultivation.

Yang Kai just smiled lightly as he swept his gaze around the crowd. Seeing everyone staring at his Black Jade Furnace fiercely, looking like they were about to attack, he even shouted loudly, “Everyone, wait a moment!”

As soon as this statement came out, everyone actually stood still and didn’t move. Even Wu Chang didn’t rush to take Yang Kai at this moment.

Previously, when Yang Kai and Luo Yuan fought against each other, although it was just a brief exchange, anyone with a bit of vision could see that Yang Kai was not someone easy to deal with. No one present was confident they could defeat him instantly.

Once they were unable to completely and immediately subdue him, others would pounce and the situation would quickly devolve into a chaotic melee.

Such a result was not one anyone wanted to see.

“As you can see, this Yang has not disappointed everyone’s trust, the Extraordinary Treasure Pills... have been refined successfully!” As Yang Kai spoke, he even took out a Spirit Pill from his Space Ring and stuffed it into his mouth. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone could clearly see that this Spirit Pill restored Source Qi.

“Now that you’ve finished it, your role here is over. Hand over the Spirit Pills!” Wu Chang said in a commanding tone.

“Heh... this Yang has thought about this matter quite a bit,” Yang Kai smiled, paused for a few breaths, then declared, “These Spirit Pills have indeed been refined, but... I won’t be handing any of them over!”

“What did you say?” Wu Chang’s face suddenly turned cold.

“Boy, you court death!”

“You want sole possession of such Heaven defying Spirit Pills Such arrogance!”

“Brat, I advise you to hand over those Spirit Pills obediently, otherwise we’ll all rip your corpse into ten thousand pieces. You’re all alone, there’s no way to resist the attack of so many people!”

As soon as Yang Kai spoke out, the crowd exploded into a flurry of curses, threats, and even enticements.

Yang Kai turned a deaf ear to all of this as his expression became cold. Glancing around, he snapped, “What kind of nonsense are you all spouting? This Extraordinary Treasure Lotus was first discovered by this Yang, and the Extraordinary Treasure Pills were also refined by this Yang alone! Even the vast majority of the adjuvant herbs for this Spirit Pill were provided by this Yang. All of you just stood there and watched the show, and now you want to obtain these Extraordinary Treasure Pills for nothing? All of you should stop dreaming and wake up!”

“Don’t get cocky, boy!”

“Heh heh, kid, it seems this kid is sleep-talking, daring to boast so shamelessly! I bet he won’t survive past today.”

“Why waste any time with him, let’s just kill him and snatch those Spirit Pills!”

Although Yang Kai had proved his strength just now, making many realize he was not an easy opponent to deal with, with so many of them against him alone, naturally they didn’t put Yang Kai in their eyes.

To everyone, Yang Kai’s current approach was nothing less than courting death! During the clamour, everyone’s eyes were still filled with greed and murderous intent as they stared at Yang Kai.

“It seems like... This was what you planned to do since the beginning, right?” Wu Chang looked at Yang Kai coldly and asked mockingly.

“Of course!” Yang Kai turned to look at him, “I didn’t plan to give these Extraordinary Treasure Pills to you people from the very beginning. Honestly... when I discovered the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus, I could have just swallowed it... Even if that would be a waste of the Heavens’ precious gifts, it would still have some effect and it would be better than handing the benefits over to all of you.”

“Bold!” Wu Chang roared furiously, a grin appearing on his face as his momentum suddenly rose and he stepped towards Yang Kai. Every time he took a step, his imposing manner would increase in intensity, like an ancient beast that caused all around him to shudder. “Although your plan wasn’t bad, you need the corresponding strength to implement it. Do you think... you have such ability?”

“If I didn’t...” Yang Kai grinned at him and said, “I wouldn’t have tried!”

If he didn’t have enough confidence, how could he have acted this way? Not only had he exposed himself as a Dao Source Grade Alchemist in front of everyone’s eyes, he even put in the work to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pills.

Of course, Yang Kai wouldn’t have done all this while only thinking he would lose the benefits to everyone else.

Everything he had done to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, Yang Kai had done for this moment.

As he spoke, he lifted his hand and shouted, “Break!”

Accompanied by this loud shout, a cracking sound suddenly rang out.

At the same time, with Yang Kai as the centre, the space within a radius of three hundred metres shattered like a mirror, with numerous black cracks appearing and swirling about, each one giving off a fatal aura.

A strange power that seemed to communicate with the Heavens and Earth filled the air!

Wu Chang stopped abruptly as he stared at the space in front of him, his expression fluctuating as he examined this new phenomenon.

“Void Cracks!”

“Space Principles!”

Cries rang out one after another as the faces of everyone present filled with shock and amazement!

Space Principles...

The strange scene before them was definitely the result of someone manipulating Space Principles, there was no other explanation for affecting space so dramatically.

Anyone who wanted to enter this three hundred metre radius region of shattered space, would have to be prepared to risk being sliced apart by these Void Cracks.

“You actually... comprehended this esoteric Dao?” Wu Chang ground his teeth and roared, his expression full of unwillingness and anger, as if Yang Kai had just brutally insulted him.

The Dao of Space was one of the rarest and most difficult Daos to comprehend. Yang Kai being proficient in this esoteric Dao naturally made Wu Chang feel unwilling to accept.

“In this world, there is actually someone who can manipulate Space Principles to such an extent with such a low cultivation?” Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes were filled with shock and admiration as he gazed towards Yang Kai’s direction.

Because of the fluctuating Space Principles, it was hard for her to even pinpoint Yang Kai’s position, as he seemed both near and far at the same time.

Under the interference of this kind of field, it would be impossible for others to attack him.

“Maybe he’s just using some kind of artifact!” Xiao Chen said with dissatisfaction, “Didn’t he have an Emperor Artifact? It seems this kid has an unusual background. He must be using some kind of Space-type artifact!”

Lan Xun frowned and didn’t bother paying any attention to him.

Although it was indeed possible to achieve this kind of effect with a powerful artifact, there were no signs Yang Kai had used anything of the sort just now. Lan Xun had clearly seen him raise his hand and release his aura before the surrounding Space Principles distorted.

This was definitely his own strength.

“This kid...” On the other side, Xia Sheng, who has been on the edge the entire time, wryly smiled.

After Yang Kai refined the Extraordinary Treasure Pills, Xia Sheng had begun sending him covert messages, asking him to cooperate with them.

However, Yang Kai had ignored him completely and instead pulled off this stunt...

“It seems like he doesn’t need any help!” Xiao Bai Yi said thoughtfully.

“En,” Xia Sheng narrowed his gaze. “If he’s proficient in the Dao of Space, he can definitely do ‘that’... If he has such skill, he really doesn’t need to fear anyone here, but...”

“But what?” Xiao Bai Yi looked at Xia Sheng curiously.

“Why doesn’t he then?” Xia Sheng looked at Yang Kai in confusion, “Wouldn’t it be best for him to just run away with the Extraordinary Treasure Pills? Him staying here and taunting everyone doesn’t make any sense, does it?”

Hearing what he said, Xiao Bai Yi was also at a loss, completely unable to figure out Yang Kai’s intentions.

On the other side, Wu Chang’s face went from black to blue as he stared at Yang Kai silently for a moment before muttering, “Do you think you’re safe hiding behind that screen?”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Does Brother Wu Chang want to try?”

“I was just about to!” Wu Chang exclaimed.
