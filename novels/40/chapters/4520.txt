Half a day later, Yang Kai returned to his cave mansion. In the end, he still did not learn anything about his white flame.

Sect Master Baili Yun Sang and the two Elders definitely knew something, but they were clearly hesitating to answer his questions. Perhaps they were worried that Yang Kai was too young and inexperienced to learn the truth.

In any case, they did not tell him much. They simply explained that the white flame was not an ordinary Alchemy Flame and could not be classified using the standard Mortal, Earth, Heaven, and Spirit Grades. Moreover, the white flame supposedly had a very long history.

They also warned him to use the Alchemy Flame with caution and pay attention to any changes in case anything went wrong.

Their attitude towards the white flame was very odd. It was a mixture of longing, wariness, and awe.

Since they refused to say anything, Yang Kai did not inquire any further. His questions would not be answered anyway. At the moment, he was more concerned about the voice that he randomly mentioned…

He initially wanted to push all the responsibility on his fake Master, but who could have known that the ‘voice’ would actually exist?

At this point, Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He could not shake the feeling that he shared an inexplicable fate with Profound Pill Sect.

Back then, he randomly came up with a fabricated Master only for Gao Xin Peng to misunderstand the situation and ultimately introduce him into Profound Pill Sect. And now, the random voice he created turned out to be connected to some sort of grand existence.

Judging by the attitudes of Baili Yun Sang and the two Elders, the true body that produced the voice was likely an extraordinary object indeed.

What’s more, at present, there was certainly something absolutely incredible in Profound Pill Sect! Yang Kai had a slight guess in his heart, so he couldn’t help looking forward to the experience.

The next day, the one-eyed old man in the Spirit Realm, who had come previously, arrived outside the Fixed Moon Peak cave mansion once more. As soon as he saw Yang Kai, he immediately pushed his Spirit Qi, wrapped Yang Kai in it, and took to the sky.

By the time they landed, they had arrived in a quiet valley where an old man stood in front of them. It was Profound Pill Sect’s Sect Master, Baili Yun Sang. However, he was alone this time. The two other Elders from yesterday were nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai stepped forward in greeting.

Baili Yun Sang nodded, “Come with me.”

After saying so, Baili Yun Sang took the lead and Yang Kai quickly followed closely behind. As they moved forward, they passed through multiple checkpoints and barriers.

Along the way, Yang Kai sensed countless Spirit Realm Masters hidden in the shadows all around them, all of them vigilantly scanning the surroundings. The perception of these Spirit Realm Masters locked firmly on his body when he walked past them with Baili Yun Sang, making Yang Kai feel as though he was being pricked by thorns.

“This is the Restricted Area of Profound Pill Sect. Only this Sect Master and a few other Elders are allowed to enter this place. Anybody else who wishes to enter this place will need to spend a large amount of contribution points to gain access. In addition, they will need to pass an inspection to ensure that they are absolutely loyal to Profound Pill Sect before they are allowed to enter.” Baili Yun Sang explained while moving forward, “Do you feel anything?”

Baili Yun Sang’s question came out of nowhere. Yang Kai shook his head in response, “Reporting to Sect Master, I don’t feel anything in particular.”

Baili Yun Sang was not bothered by the answer he received and simply continued moving forward.

A short while later, Yang Kai sensed that he had followed Baili Yun Sang into the belly of a mountain. His vision suddenly brightened when he reached this place. There was a large cavern in the heart of the mountain, and the cavern was filled with a gentle light that illuminated the whole place.

Yang Kai’s gaze was instantly drawn towards an object in front of him.

Not far away was a structure shaped like an altar, and an antique four-legged cauldron sat atop it. The cauldron was approximately half the height of a man and it could be seen at a glance that it was extremely old. There were clear traces caused by the passage of time covering the entire cauldron.

The cauldron was also filled with a dense white fog which flowed out gently, like a trickling stream of water, filling the entire space with a strange power. Under the effects of this strange power, Yang Kai felt his mind becoming calm and peaceful. Even his Soul reached an unprecedented point of clarity.

At this moment, Yang Kai felt a stroke of inspiration and suddenly straightened his finger like a sword and turned around to face the cave wall. Activating his Spirit Qi, he began scribbling something on the wall.

Baili Yun Sang was startled by Yang Kai’s abrupt actions. He did not know what kind of frenzy had come over this boy, but just as he was about to stop him, his expression changed slightly. He seemed to realise something and hurriedly fell silent while paying close attention to Yang Kai’s movements instead.

A rustling and scraping sound filled the air. This place might be a Restricted Area, but the large cauldron was the only item of value in this place. The other caverns and altars simply contained normal objects. Thanks to Yang Kai’s actions, row after row of densely-packed words appeared on the cave wall. In exchange, a thick layer of dust quickly settled around his feet.

The entire process continued for half an incense stick’s worth of time. Then, he suddenly groaned and clutched at his head. His strange movements from before stopped abruptly.

Baili Yun Sang walked over to Yang Kai’s side and stared at the words written on the cave wall with glowing eyes. His expression was filled with pure excitement, and he murmured under his breath, “Incredible! How incredible!”

“Sect Master…” Yang Kai shook his head slightly before he turned around and called out.

“Oh! Are you all right?” Only then did Baili Yun Sang remember to check on Yang Kai’s condition.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’m fine. Sect Master, what… What happened?”

Baili Yun Sang smiled at Yang Kai, “Don’t you remember what you did?”

Yang Kai stared at the words carved on the cave wall and dazedly said, “I’m not too sure myself. It was as if something suddenly exploded in my head and I received this knowledge for some reason. I was afraid I might forget, so I quickly wrote it down. If I made a mistake, please punish me, Sect Master!”

“You did well. You didn’t make any mistakes. You did extremely well!” Baili Yun Sang looked at Yang Kai emotionally before he turned back to look at the wall, “This is a pill recipe. Do you know what pill recipe this is for?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, “It should be the pill recipe for something called the Mortal Yuan Pill. This pill will be extremely beneficial towards those in the Mortal Realm once refined.” After saying that, he seemed shocked, “That’s strange. Why would I know this? I’ve never learned this pill recipe before…”

Baili Yun Sang patted Yang Kai on the shoulder, “Don’t panic. This is not a bad thing. On the contrary, it is a blessing! As for why you know this… Think carefully about what happened just now.”

Yang Kai put on a thoughtful expression. A moment later, he replied, “After following Sect Master here, I saw the large cauldron over there and subsequently heard a bang in my head. Then… Could it be that all of this is related to that explosion?”

Baili Yun Sang said, “This Old Master did not hear any explosions. I don’t know what it sounded like either. Think about it carefully; have you ever heard that sound anywhere else before?”

Yang Kai was pensive, “It’s similar to the voice I heard back at Fixed Moon Peak, but much louder and clearer!”

“En,” Baili Yun Sang nodded and pointed to the large cauldron, “That is the source of the voice you heard earlier!”

Yang Kai looked in that direction and asked puzzledly, “Sect Master, what is that cauldron?”

“That cauldron…” Baili Yun Sang’s expression turned solemn and he bowed deeply to the large cauldron quickly explaining, “That is one of the Ten Great Divine Armaments, the Medicine King Furnace!”

Yang Kai was shocked, “This is the Medicine King Furnace!?”

“Indeed!” Baili Yun Sang nodded.

“Unbelievable!” Yang Kai stared at the Medicine King Furnace blankly, “I thought…”

“Thought what? That the Divine Armaments should be sparkling and radiant?” Baili Yun Sang chuckled, “Each of the Ten Great Divine Armaments represents a Grand Dao of this World. They might not have a gorgeous appearance, but they are undoubtedly the most valuable objects in the Divine Armament World.”

“This Disciple has been enlightened!”

Looking at the Medicine King Furnace, Baili Yun Sang sighed slightly, “Do you know why this Old Master brought you here?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

“Logically speaking, a Heaven Grade Alchemist like you who recently joined the Sect would never obtain the qualifications to come into contact with the Medicine King Furnace. Just as this Old Master told you earlier, this place is Profound Pill Sect’s Restricted Area. Only this Old Master and several Elders are allowed to step into this place. Aside from that, other disciples not only have to spend a large amount of contribution points but also show absolute loyalty to the Sect in order to enter this place and explore its mysteries.”

“Mysteries?” Yang Kai keenly grasped onto the key point.

Baili Yun Sang nodded his head with a solemn expression, “Yes, mysteries. The mysteries of the Grand Alchemic Dao. Each of the Ten Great Divine Armaments represents a Grand Dao of this World, and the Medicine King Furnace represents the Alchemic Dao! There are countless Alchemic Dao Truths contained within the Medicine King Furnace. If you can glimpse just one of the mysteries within, you will benefit endlessly throughout your life.”

Pausing for a moment, he smiled at Yang Kai, “That faint voice you heard is the Medicine King Furnace’s Grand Dao Divine Tone! This Old Master will hear that voice occasionally, but it has always been vague and indistinct. I’ve never received as much benefit as you have.”

Yang Kai looked stunned, “So you’re saying that I managed to improve the pill recipe of the Ten Revolutions Clear Heart Pill thanks to the Medicine King Furnace, and not because my memories of being taught by Honoured Master had resurfaced… And, that pill recipe for the Mortal Yuan Pill…”

“Good!” Baili Yun Sang stroked his beard and looked at Yang Kai in delight, “Your residence on Fixed Moon Peak is quite far from here. Not to mention, there are various defenses in place to protect this area. Nevertheless, that did not stop you from hearing the Medicine King Furnace’s Grand Dao Divine Tone. That must mean that you have a connection with the Medicine King Furnace. For that reason, this Old Master made an exception to bring you here. Judging from the situation, it was a wise move. You immediately received the teachings of the Medicine King Furnace and obtained the pill recipe for the Mortal Yuan Pills as soon as you arrived. If you stay here for the long-term, your harvest will only be even greater!”

Yang Kai was taken aback by those words, but rather than happiness, he felt dread, [If I stay here for the long-term, then won’t I just be wasting my time here!?]

When he saw the Medicine King Furnace earlier, he confirmed his previous speculation. Baili Yun Sang and the others believed that the voice he randomly made up yesterday was related to the Medicine King Furnace. It was just that he never imagined things would coincidentally fall into place so perfectly.

Baili Yun Sang was apparently also capable of hearing the Medicine King Furnace’s Grand Dao Divine Tone. It was just that the voice he heard was rather ethereal, so he did not benefit much from it.

But, the mysterious voice really existed.

That was why Yang Kai immediately pretended to feel a headache and write down the pill recipe for the Mortal Yuan Pill when he caught sight of the Medicine King Furnace… Having mastered countless pill recipes, producing a pill recipe that did not exist in the Divine Armament World was very easy for him. The Mortal Yuan Pill was simply more nonsense that he created.

...

“Although I don’t know the reason why, this is the Heavens’ Will. I can only obey. From today onward, you will live here and comprehend the secrets of the Medicine King Furnace. Don’t worry about the affairs regarding the Seeking Pill Pavilion. This Old Master will help you make arrangements!”
