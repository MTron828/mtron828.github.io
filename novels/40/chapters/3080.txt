It wasn’t that Lu Huai Shuang had never seen a corpse before. On the contrary, she had personally killed many people throughout her life.

Not long after she took over the Lu Family, another prestigious family on Morning Sun Star, the He Family, launched an attack on them. In an instant, the two families went to war, and they lost many lives on both sides. It was thanks to Lu Huai Shuang’s outstanding leadership in the war that her position became firm.

Now, the entire Morning Sun Star was practically divided by the Lu Family and the He Family. Each of these two families had occupied half of the resources and territory on the Star.

However, the appearance of this young man made Lu Huai Shuang frown deeply. It wasn’t that she bore hatred towards him, but rather that this incident was too strange. After examining the young man’s face for a long time, she looked up at an old man and asked, “Third Uncle, is he from our side?”

There were a few hundred cultivators aboard the Starship and although she couldn’t remember all their names, Lu Huai Shuang could at least recognize all of them. However, this young man looked unfamiliar to her, so she was certain that she had never seen him before.

Lu Bing shook his head, “No.”

“He’s not?” Lu Huai Shuang narrowed her eyes.

[Since he isn’t from our side, why did he appear on my Starship?] In an instant, she could think of many possibilities, but the most reasonable explanation was that he must be a spy sent by the Lu Family’s enemies. If that was the case, there might still be other troubles lurking in the dark.

As though he had seen through her mind, Lu Bing uttered, “This man was found in the broken section of the Starship.”

“Third Uncle, you mean…” Lu Huai Shuang looked up at him. Although she was intelligent, she couldn’t grasp what he was talking about.

With a complicated expression, Lu Bing went on to say, “Based on my observations, our Starship was damaged because it was hit by this man.”

Upon hearing that, all fell silent as they were trying to understand what Lu Bing meant. Following that, a terrifying idea sprang into their minds as their gazes were transformed by disbelief.

Lu Huai Shuang came to her senses and stared at her Third Uncle in a bewildered manner. If she wasn’t very familiar with her Third Uncle’s personality and temperament, she would’ve thought that he was pulling her leg.

With a helpless smile, Lu Bing continued, “Initially, I thought that the Starship was hit by an asteroid, but after some investigation, I couldn’t find any traces left behind by an asteroid impact. Instead, I found this man at the centre of the damaged part of the Starship’s hull, right in the centre of the impact.”

All of them gasped and looked at Lu Bing with weird expressions, while Lu Huai Shuang remained silent and fell into her thoughts.

Lu Bing continued, “I know this sounds inconceivable, but I can’t find a better explanation.”

In fact, it wasn’t just inconceivable; it was just too shocking. How did a Human manage to crash into the Starship, which formed a hole on it that caused serious damage to its hull? They also had to look for a place to land to make repairs as a result. This was one of the two best Starships on Morning Sun Star, an Origin King Grade Starship! It could even endure the assault of a First-Order Origin King’s attacks for an extended period of time, so how could one man manage to damage it so seriously?

If such a Starship could be damaged so easily, it wouldn’t have been able to navigate through the Starry Sky, as any asteroid could destroy its hull with ease. Even if a person could cause damage to the hull by crashing into it, what about the Crystal Cannon volley they fired?

All ten Crystal Cannons were fired and hit the target accurately. Who could be strong enough to endure the collective power of ten Crystal Cannons? Judging from this young man’s appearance, it was apparent that while quite dishevelled, he was completely unhurt. Even if his skin was made of the hardest metal, he couldn’t withstand such an attack.

Everyone broke into a commotion. This young man, who was found in the broken part of the Starship, had all their minds messed up, as all their common sense and knowledge seemed to have been turned upside down.

“It’s no use speculating about all this now. Our priority is to repair the Starship,” Lu Huai Shuang ordered.

Lu Bing sighed secretly as he knew that she didn’t believe his speculation. Honestly speaking, he didn’t believe his own speculation either, feeling that he must have missed something and drawn the wrong conclusion, so he didn’t attempt to defend himself.

“As for this person, bury him somewhere.” Lu Huai Shuang looked down at the deceased young man. Regardless of his identity or the reason he appeared on her Starship, he at least deserved proper last rights.

Just then, beams of lights were seen coming at them from all directions as chaotic energy waves could be felt everywhere. The attacks already reached them before their opponents arrived.

*Chi, Chi, Chi…*

A series of sounds could be heard, and when a light flashed across their eyes, the place where these people from the Lu Family were standing had turned into a sea of energy waves.

“Enemy attack!” Someone shouted, but his voice stopped abruptly, as though someone was clenching on his neck. Following that, the person’s aura disappeared, so it was apparent that he had passed away. In an instant, numerous people started screaming.

Lu Huai Shuang’s expression changed drastically as she hadn’t expected that they would be assaulted in such a place. They were on a nameless Dead Star, and they had only decided to land here moments ago, so how did their enemies manage to ambush them here?

With no time to think about it though, she touched her earlobe and broke an earring, upon which a beam of white light transformed into a gigantic dome, protecting all the cultivators from the Lu Family from these attacks.

Explosions could be heard as all the attacks landed on the protective shield and formed a layer of ripples. The glow of the shield increasingly dimmed and only a few breaths later did it shatter with a loud crack.

However, with the buffer time they gained, all those from the Lu Family collected themselves and summoned their artifacts or used their Secret Techniques to counter the enemy assault.

The chaotic energy fluctuations caused the surroundings to shake violently as all of a sudden, a person fell from the sky with his arms crossed. At the same time, heavy pressure descended on Lu Huai Shuang.

Lu Huai Shuang narrowed her eyes as she unsheathed her azure longsword. In an instant, she seemed to have transformed into an entirely different person. She was an alluring lady with bountiful curves, but at the same time, she was an Origin King Realm Master.

Without considerable power, she wouldn’t have been able to command everyone in the Lu Family; moreover, she was a woman, so she needed even more power to earn everyone’s respect.

After she slashed across space with her azure longsword, a Sword Domain was formed instantly, and her Sword Intent caused her enemy to feel a sharp pain on their skin. The longsword in her hand then transformed into a phantom as it flourished above her head. At that instant, more than a hundred streams of Sword Qi shot out.

The horrifying pressure vanished in an instant as the enemy who was descending towards Lu Huai Shuang called out in shock and hurriedly dodged to avoid the Sword Qi blades.

After trading attacks, both Lu Huai Shuang and her opponent could feel each other’s immense power. Surprisingly, both sides were equally matched.

The clamorous battlefield fell silent in an eerie manner after the strongest Masters at the scene traded blows. The Lu Family cultivators felt like they had just returned from death’s door, and when they came to their senses, they realized that their backs were already drenched in a cold sweat.

Lu Huai Shuang took a closer look and realized that a fair-skinned chubby man was grinning at her with a playful expression. He was clad in a loose shirt that wasn’t buttoned up, so his big belly was exposed for all to see. He looked like a fat and slovenly man who had just finished a feast. Paired with his long, narrow eyes, he made for a funny picture.

However, no one dared to laugh at him. Instead, they were horrified.

With a dark expression, Lu Bing yelled, “Ma Chao Qun!”

A cold glint flashed across the fat man’s eyes as he replied with a smile, “Oh? You know me?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Lu Bing gulped. The person before his eyes had a distinctive body shape and facial features, so there was no way he couldn’t recognize him. He was Ma Chao Qun of the Fierce Gale Pirates!

Fierce Gale Pirates wasn’t Ma Chao Chun’s personal force, but rather the name of a great force that was basically a plague upon everyone in the Star Field. Robbers lived in the mountains while pirates lived on the seas. Then, there were Star Pirates who sailed the Starry Sky.

What they did wasn’t fundamentally different from those robbers and pirates, they robbed people of their wealth and committed all sorts of wicked deeds.

There were a large number of Star Pirates in the Star Field, but only a handful of them actually had widely recognized names. The Fierce Gale Pirates was one such group though because they had Origin Kings among their leaders.

The Origin King Realm was the peak of the Star Field, so the Masters in this realm were practically peerless in every Cultivation Star. If such a Master decided to become a pirate though, it would be disastrous for all.

Historically, many of the top forces in the Star Field had joined forces numerous times to stamp out all Star Pirates; however, like weeds, they could be cut down but eventually, they would spring up again. Even if one to two groups of Star Pirates were destroyed, more would emerge in the future to take their place soon enough.

The Fierce Gale Pirates were particularly sly and cunning as they would never provoke those they couldn’t afford to offend. Those targeted by them were forces that were rich but relatively powerless. Moreover, they had no morality at all as they would frequently kill all of their targets and rob all their belongings. It was said that wherever the Fierce Gale Pirates passed through, even grass wouldn’t be able to grow.

Therefore, the Fierce Gale Pirates could be said to be the most infamous Star Pirates in Unending Star Field.

The Star Pirates from the Fierce Gale Pirates had surrounded all those from the Lu Family at this moment and were sporting evil grins on their faces. Their gazes were especially lewd as they stared fixedly at Lu Huai Shuang’s luscious body, as though they were savouring a delicious dish.

The grin on Ma Chao Qun’s face widened as his belly shook and rippled.

“You must be Young Lady Lu. You’re indeed a beautiful lady with a powerful cultivation. You’re so much better than what the rumours mentioned. I’ve been longing to meet you.”

With a long face, Lu Huai Shuang swept a glance over all those from the Lu Family. What happened on this day was unexpected, but she could feel that something nefarious was going on.

Those from the Fierce Gale Pirates seemed to have figured out that they would come here, which was why these pirates had appeared at this moment to rob them. As the leader of the Lu Family, she had her own suspicions about how this was possible, and with her sharp vision as an Origin King Realm Master she soon found a clue.

One of the clansmen from the Lu Family, who she recalled belonged to her First Uncle’s family, didn’t dare to meet her eyes at this moment. In that instant, Lu Huai Shuang felt her heart aching as she became extremely disappointed. She didn’t understand why someone she considered to be family would betray her.
