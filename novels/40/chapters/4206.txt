No wonder Gu Zhi Xin, as well as the other Deacons and Hall Masters, were killed in an instant! It turned out that the other party was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm! How could any Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master fight back against such mighty strength?

Nevertheless, despite guessing that Gu Zhi Xin and the others had died at the hands of this beautiful woman, the many Open Heaven Realm Masters in Blood Swan Continent did not dare to hold the slightest resentment or vengeful feelings against her.

There was only one Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the entire Shocking Swan Territory, and that was the Old Pavilion Master of Shocking Swan Pavilion. He had oppressed Shocking Swan Territory for thousands of years and reigned supreme in this place, dominating Shocking Swan Territory under him. Nobody dared to disobey him. That showed just how tyrannical the strength of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was.

Even if Blood Swan Continent had asked Shocking Swan Pavilion for help, Shocking Swan Pavilion would probably refuse to interfere in this chaos. How could the Old Pavilion Master, who was approaching his predestined time of death, dare to offend another Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master for Blood Swan Continent?

Yun Xing Hua looked at the young man standing in front of the woman with a bitter expression. That young man’s aura was obscure, but it was obvious he was only in the Emperor Realm. Even so, Yun Xing Hua did not dare to underestimate the other party. Rather, his expression became even more solemn than before.

This couldn’t be helped. That was because the young man’s position was actually one step ahead of that woman in the Sixth-Order! What did that mean? That undoubtedly meant that the young man’s status was higher than hers. It could even be said that the woman in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm was nothing more than his subordinate!

Yun Xing Hua felt cold sweat oozing out of his forehead. He had the vague feeling that he had accidentally provoked an extraordinary existence. Suppressing the fear in his heart, he politely cupped his fists and quickly said, “Blood Swan Continent Yun Xing Hua greets two guests. May I know how I should address you?”

Yang Kai was expressionless and said nothing while on the other hand, Yue He smilingly replied, “The Young Master is the Master of Void Land, Void True Monarch.”

A trivial nobody in the Emperor Realm was clearly not qualified to call himself ‘True Monarch’, but nobody found those words strange given the circumstances.

Yun Xing Hua frowned slightly and his heart was filled with doubts. He could tell that Void Land was a Second-Class great force, but he had never heard of this name before. Still, he adjusted quickly, “So it is Sir True Monarch. I did not know that you were coming to visit Blood Swan Continent. Please forgive us for our lack of hospitality. It’s just… is there some kind of misunderstanding? Why did you attack Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array, True Monarch? Has Blood Swan Continent done something to offend you?”

There had never been a time when he had to speak so respectfully towards an Emperor Realm Junior, but there was no helping it; his strength could not compare to the other party, so he could only lower his head.

Yue He was still smiling, but her smile seemed extremely terrifying in the eyes of the many Open Heaven Realm Masters in Blood Swan Continent.

“Don’t you know what Blood Swan Continent has done? Why ask when you already know the answer?”

Yun Xing Hua’s expression became tortured but he forced a smile onto his face and said, “Madame, please enlighten me. This Yun has been in retreat and has only come out recently, so I am not too aware of the events in the outside world.”

“Are you sure?” Yue He looked at him meaningfully, but her tone was leisurely.

Under her gaze, Yun Xing Hua felt as though he was being watched by an ancient Ominous Beast and could die at any moment. Thus, the cold sweat on his forehead kept sliding down his cheeks. The pressure was as heavy as a mountain as the wheels in his head spun at a dizzying speed, trying to think of a way to resolve the current crisis.

At this moment, the weak-looking scholar stepped forward and spoke in a voice that was neither too loud nor too soft, “Sect Master, I’m afraid this incident might be related to Elder Gu.”

“What do you mean?” Yun Xing Hua pretended not to know anything, glancing at the scholar suspiciously.

The scholar replied, “I seem to have heard Guo Miao’s voice coming from inside the lotus just now. Guo Miao is one of the Disciples under Elder Gu and the daughter of one of Scarlet Star’s Great Commanders, Guo Zi Yan. In the past, Commander Guo sent Guo Miao to Blood Swan Continent to take Elder Gu as her Master and cultivate under him. The day before yesterday, Commander Guo came to Blood Swan Continent to take Guo Miao away. Naturally, Elder Gu had no objections. The two of them had a long conversation with each other over drinks, but I have no idea what happened after their talk. Since Guo Miao is here, then this incident must have something to do with that event.”

“Something like this happened?” Yun Xing Hua frowned and looked around. He shouted, “Where is Elder Gu? Come forward and explain this situation.”

The scholar replied, “Sect Master, Elder Gu is dead. His Soul Lamp went out all of a sudden. I was just about to report this matter to you, but I didn’t get the chance to do so.”

“What!?” Yun Xing Hua was shocked, “Elder Gu is dead!?”

“Elder Gu is not the only one. The Soul Lamps of several other Deacons and Hall Masters were also extinguished at the same time.”

Yun Xing Hua’s expression went pale all of a sudden as he spoke in a distressed voice, “How can this be?”

Seeming to mourn their deaths for a moment, he raised his head again to look at Yue He and Yang Kai, “May I know if Your Excellency’s arrival at Blood Swan Continent is related to Gu Zhi Xin? If that’s the case, I’m afraid you will be disappointed. Elder Gu was killed by an unknown party and even his Soul Lamp has been extinguished.”

“No need to wonder, I killed him!” Yue He said lightly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Yun Xing Hua widened his eyes and stared at her in disbelief, “Madame, why did you kill one of Blood Swan Continent’s Elders? What did Elder Gu do to offend you?”

Yue He just stared at him deeply and only after a long while passed did she slowly shake her head and look at Yang Kai, “Young Master.”

Yang Kai clapped his hands slowly, “I heard that the Sect Master of Blood Swan Continent was suppressed by Shocking Swan Pavilion in the past, but he endured the disgrace and the humiliation while working to build himself back up. Therefore, I originally thought that the Sect Master of Blood Swan Continent would be a resilient and flexible man who could achieve great things given time. But, it seems now that he is nothing more than a clown!”

Yun Xing Hua snapped angrily, “Why do you say that, True Monarch?”

Yang Kai looked at Yun Xing Hua indifferently, “Sect Master, don’t you think that your acting is too clumsy? Who could you deceive with such a shoddy performance? For your next act, do you expect me to tell you that Gu Zhi Xin not only stole the two Fourth-Order materials that Commander Guo gave to his daughter but also forced her to refine a Second-Order Element in order to cut off her future Martial Dao? Then, to prevent any future trouble, he teamed up with several other Open Heaven Realm Masters of Blood Swan Continent to hunt down Commander Guo and his daughter? Are you going to tell me that you were completely oblivious to everything that was going on? Was it all done by Gu Zhi Xin alone?”

“Two Fourth-Order materials?” Yun Xing Hua was stunned by what he heard, “Elder Gu did give me two Fourth-Order materials to help me in my cultivation while I was in retreat. Could it be that those two materials belonged to Guo Miao?”

After saying that, he seemed extremely annoyed, “Foolish! How foolish! As one of the Elders of Blood Swan Continent Elder, how could Elder Gu actually steal the resources of his Disciples!? Such practices are against the ethics a Master should abide by!”

Yang Kai nodded in praise, “Sect Master, your acting skills are superb indeed. This King is impressed!”

Yun Xing Hua spoke with a stern expression, “True Monarch, you are misunderstanding me. I really had no clue about this matter. If I had known earlier…”

Before Yun Xing Hua could finish speaking, Yang Kai raised a hand to interrupt the other party. He leaned forward slightly and looked down at Yun Xing Hua condescendingly, “Did you think this King came here to argue with you? Regardless of whether you knew anything about this matter or not, it doesn’t change the fact that somebody from Blood Swan Continent stole from one of my people then attempted to kill them to cover up the crime. Commander Guo was also injured by the people from Blood Swan Continent. If not for this King’s timely rescue, he and his daughter would not be alive today. Commander Guo is a member of Void Land. The people of Void Land are not people that mere bastards like you lot can bully.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Yue He let out a tender shout as she gave a flick of her wrist and summoned a long whip into her hand. The whip flew through the air and lashed against the light barrier of Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array. The light barrier caved inward deeply and successfully blocked this terrifying blow, but Yue He simply flicked her wrist again and lash her whip once more.

At the same time, the huge lotus suddenly split apart. The lotus flower petals flew out, slicing at the Grand Array from every direction like sharp blades. That was not all. Yang Kai also raised his hand and summoned the Yuan Magnetic Divine Bottle Gourd, opened its lid, and unleashed the Yuan Magnetic Divine Light towards the Defensive Grand Array.

The rumbling sounds were incessant and the entire Blood Swan Continent shook violently as its World Energy became chaotic. Many of the Open Heaven Realm Masters went pale at the sight and all of them turned to look at Yun Xing Hua.

Yun Xing Hua had re-summoned the Array Jade and focused the power of the Defensive Grand Array the moment Yang Kai and the others started attacking. Still, he perceived that the Grand Array was collapsing extremely quickly. His heart couldn’t help sinking to the bottom of the abyss.

Blood Swan Continent was only a Third-Class great force, so even though it had a Defensive Grand Array, its power was still relatively weak. They might have been able to resist if they had a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master on their side, but unfortunately, they did not.

Yue He was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so how could Blood Swan Continent’s Grand Array possibly stop her? Not to mention, Lang Qing Shan and the others were harnessing the power of the Falling Lotus while Yang Kai was controlling the Yuan Magnetic Divine Light to support from the sides!

With such a violent attack, it would take less than an hour before the Grand Array collapsed completely. When that happened, nobody in Blood Swan Continent would be able to stop the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from slaughtering them, regardless of their advantage in numbers.

“True Monarch, please stop! This really is a misunderstanding!” Yun Xing Hua shouted in a frenzy, his face dripping with cold sweat.

Yang Kai was unmoved by those words and on the contrary, his attacks became fiercer. He urged the Yuan Magnetic Divine Light more savagely than before. The Yuan Magnetic Divine Light could unleash a Sixth-Order Element Power, which was extremely powerful; however, it was still just one Element. Its destructive power was incomparable to that of a genuine Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Yue He. After all, what an Open Heaven Realm Master mobilised was World Force which blended Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements. Even so, the Yuan Magnetic Divine Light was much more powerful compared to his own strength as an Emperor Realm Cultivator.

When Yun Xing Hua saw Yang Kai ignoring him, he shouted again, “Blood Swan Continent is willing to compensate you for your losses, True Monarch! Please show mercy!”

Yang Kai sneered, “You want to bargain now? Too late!”

If Yun Xing Hua had dispelled the Defensive Grand Array at the start and apologised properly, Yang Kai might not have decided to be so cruel; after all, it was not right for him to continue attacking if the other party was not fighting back. Besides, the culprit, Gu Zhi Xin, was already dead. Even if Yun Xing Hua knew about the incident beforehand, he was not the mastermind. However, Yun Xing Hua mistakenly believed that he could worm his way out of any blame by feigning ignorance. How could Yang Kai tolerate his actions?

Seeing that Yang Kai was so determined, Yun Xing Hua despaired. He could only desperately mobilise the power of the Grand Array to resist, but he knew that he was simply drinking poison to quench his thirst. There was no way to stop the impending disaster in front of him just by relying on Blood Swan Continent’s Defensive Grand Array. But, what was he to do if he did not resist? Was he supposed to allow himself to be slaughtered?

Turning his head and looking around, he saw that the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters looked as sorrowful as grieving widows and their complexions were grey with fear. Many of the disciples were also shivering and panicking. Yun Xing Hua sighed in his heart, knowing that Blood Swan Continent was doomed. At that moment, he wished with all his heart that he could drag the dead Gu Zhi Xin back from the Yellow Springs and give Gu Zhi Xin a brutal whipping.
