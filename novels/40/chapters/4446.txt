Yin-Yang Combined Demons was one of the best Secret Techniques in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. It was a Secret Technique that only a man and a woman who were in love with one another could cultivate. The man would cultivate a Yang Demon while the woman would cultivate a Yin Demon. Harsh requirements had to be met before they could cultivate it, and even if they succeeded, the Secret Technique would become useless if one of them fell out of love.

This Secret Technique had many uses. Not only could it assist the couple when they dual cultivated, increasing the rate of their cultivation, it could also be used as a Combined Attack Technique that would significantly increase their powers when they were faced with an enemy.

There was also another auxiliary use of the Secret Technique, which was what Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue were doing.

Presently, they were using the Yin Demon and the Yang Demon that they had nurtured for years to stir up the deepest emotions and magnify the feelings in other people’s hearts. At the same time, they were transferring their feelings of attraction and love for one another to the people who were the targets of this Secret Technique.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue had been a couple for many years, and their love for each other was deep and resolute. At this moment, they were using their Yin-Yang Combined Demons together to stimulate Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang.

In other words, the feelings Yang Kai had for Qu Hua Shang were those of Qing Kui to Su Ying Xue, not his real sentiment. He was just influenced by the Secret Technique.

It was the same case for Qu Hua Shang.

However, there was a prerequisite for this Secret Technique to work. The people that the technique was used on had to be at least fond of each other; otherwise, the Secret Technique would not work.

If there was a blood feud between both parties and they were eager to hack each other to death, this Secret Technique would be completely useless as trying to amplify non-existent feelings would still result in non-existent feelings.

Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang had gone through many life-and-death moments together and supported one another in the Grand Ancient Ruins and Blood Monster Cave Heaven, so both of them treasured the relationship they had. They were Humans, so there was no way they felt nothing for one another.

Regardless of Qu Hua Shang’s feelings for him, Yang Kai’s fondness for her was infinitely magnified under the influence of the Yin-Yang Combined Demons Secret Technique, which was proof that it had worked.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue continuously used different hand seals to sustain the effects of the Yin-Yang Combined Demons. As time passed, the inside of Qu Hua Shang’s room became more and more heated, and things seemed to be getting out of hand.

There came a moment when Qing Kui suddenly opened his eyes and said, “We should stop now; otherwise, they’ll really cross the final line.”

They needed Yang Kai to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly to turn things around and save Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s face and protect Qu Hua Shang’s happiness; otherwise, they wouldn’t have done such a thing. Naturally, they wouldn’t sacrifice Qu Hua Shang’s innocence to achieve that.

According to Xu Ling Gong, Yang Kai would just be the shit-stirrer. He didn’t expect Yang Kai to come out the winner, but the latter had to take part in the event.

In fact, he had been waiting for this moment for quite some time. As he shuffled towards the valley, he sported a ferocious expression and murderous intent swirled around him, as though he was going to kill someone ruthlessly.

He was going to catch Yang Kai in the act and make sure that the bastard little boy wouldn’t be able to refuse his demand.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue exchanged glances and worried that something bad would happen, they hurriedly stopped using their Secret Technique and raced after their Honoured Master.

A moment later, following a loud bang, the door of Qu Hua Shang’s room was kicked open. Despite already expecting it, Xu Ling Gong was still incensed when he saw the sight in the room.

Clothes were scattered everywhere on the ground, and there was a sense of intimacy in the air. The curtains around the bed had been untied and presently, Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang were covered in a quilt as they hid in the corner and shuddered.

They gazed at Xu Ling Gong in horror as though they were two kids that had been caught making a big mistake.

[Not a moment too soon!] Xu Ling Gong took a glance around the room and knew that these two young people hadn’t managed to do anything, yet. They had only taken off their outer clothes.

Certainly, Qu Hua Shang had already been taken advantage of, but she hadn’t lost her purity; otherwise, it would be hard for her to explain herself to the winner of the Dao Theory Assembly.

The current situation was the best outcome.

“You dare?!” Xu Ling Gong bellowed as his fury seemed able to shake the sky, “Qu’er, I’ve been your teacher for many years, but I never expected that you’d do such a shameless thing! You disappoint me so!”

“H-Honoured Master!” Qu Hua Shang’s teeth chattered as she had never expected things to come to such a point. While she was getting intimate with Yang Kai, her Honoured Master suddenly barged into her room and scared her out of her wits. She instantly felt cold all over her body.

“Honoured Master?” The middle-aged man that had just barged into the room was clad in a robe embroidered with snake patterns, and there was a golden crown on his head. As Yang Kai gazed at the enraged man with surging murderous intent, he had the urge to dig a hole and stick his head into it.

It was truly embarrassing that he was caught in bed with Qu Hua Shang by her Honoured Master. He still hadn’t the foggiest idea why he was so impetuous this time. He only intended to have a talk with Qu Hua Shang, so how did the two of them end up in bed?

This wasn’t how he would usually act. Fortunately, nothing had happened yet, or else he wouldn’t be able to explain himself.

“Senior…” Yang Kai hurriedly called out.

“Enough nonsense! Today you must die!” Xu Ling Gong yelled as his murderous intent almost materialised. Following that, he charged towards Yang Kai.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue arrived just in time. The former quickly wrapped his arms around the older man’s waist and shouted, “Please calm down, Honoured Master! He’s the Lord of Void Land, Yang Kai. He saved Junior Sister Qu’s life before!”

Xu Ling Gong exerted more force with his hands in an attempt to push Qing Kui away, but the latter would never let him go, so he roared, “I don’t care who he is. Since he has the guts to take advantage of my Disciple, he must die!”

Qing Kui said anxiously, “If you kill him, Junior Sister Qu will be regarded as an unrighteous person forever! Please think twice!”

“What?” Xu Ling Gong paused for a moment, then bellowed, “Get lost! So what if she’ll be regarded as unrighteous!? I’ll hack him to death first!”

Qing Kui thought that this was different from what they had agreed upon. It seemed that his Honoured Master was truly incensed. In order to prevent things from getting out of control, he promptly sent a signal to Su Ying Xue.

The two of them immediately latched onto Xu Ling Gong and kept persuading him for a long time before the older man was finally appeased.

However, his eyes were still bloodshot, and he was panting as though he was a furious lion. The way he glared at Yang Kai was like he wanted to skin him, eat his flesh, and drink his blood.

Yang Kai cowered under the quilt, and even the warm body beside him was unable to melt the coldness he felt.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue breathed a sigh of relief. They felt exhausted from having to play along with their Honoured Master who seemed to have completely forgotten about their original plan.

It was inappropriate that Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang remained cuddled together with nothing but a quilt covering them, so Qing Kui sent Su Ying Xue a signal, who then leaped onto the bed and carried Qu Hua Shang away, quilt and all. Yang Kai was left on the bed in only his underwear as he looked embarrassed.

In an adjacent room, Su Ying Xue put down the quilt and asked worriedly, “Are you alright?”

Qu Hua Shang’s face was all red as she clenched the quilt and shook her head. She was still reeling from the shock of the fact that she was caught in the act.

“Let me have a look.” An anxious Su Ying Xue lifted the quilt a little and took a peek below before finally breathing a sigh of relief.

Qu Hua Shang still had her underwear on as she had only taken off her dress. It seemed that they hadn’t done anything.

“Senior Sister, Honoured Master…”

Su Ying Xue waved her hand, “Don’t worry. I’ll put in a good word for you. I’m sure he won’t blame you.”

A blushing Qu Hua Shang asked, “I’m worried that he’ll harm Junior Brother Yang. Can you check on them for me?”

Su Ying Xue shot her a glare, “How are you still in the mood to be concerned about that little bastard at this point? You should mind your own business first!”

Back in the bedroom, under Xu Ling Gong’s vicious stare, Yang Kai put on his clothes and adjusted his hair. Then, he walked up to the older man and forced a smile as he cupped his fist, “Greetings, Senior.”

...

Xu Ling Gong directly took a seat on the chair with a stern expression. He examined Yang Kai in a way as though he could peel off the latter’s skin with his eyes.

Qing Kui just stood behind Xu Ling Gong, but when he saw how embarrassed Yang Kai looked, he had to try his hardest to suppress his laughter. Seeing that his Honoured Master was not speaking though, he eventually took the initiative to explain, “This is our Honoured Master Xu Ling Gong, one of the Inner Elders of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

“So it is Senior Xu. I’ve heard so much about you,” Yang Kai said politely as he secretly scanned the surroundings. He decided that if Xu Ling Gong made a move, he would immediately flee.

There was no way he could explain what had happened, and it was expected that the other party was infuriated.

“You’ve heard a lot about me, have you?” Xu Ling Gong yelled and directly broke the table into pieces, “Brat, you’ve taken advantage of my Disciple and tarnished her reputation. How do you want to die? Tell me and I’ll see it done!”

Yang Kai’s forehead was covered in sweat as he said, “Please don’t get me wrong, Senior. It was just a misunderstanding.”

“A misunderstanding?” Xu Ling Gong’s fury surged, “You were in my Disciple’s bed, half-naked, and you have the gall to tell me it was a misunderstanding!?”

“Well…” Yang Kai glanced cautiously at the older man, “We didn’t manage to do it. Nothing had happened between us.”

Xu Ling Gong snapped, “You didn’t manage to do anything because this Monarch arrived in time! Had I been just a breath later, you would have succeeded!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“It’s all my fault. I have no idea what was going on, but I had indeed accidentally made a mistake. I’m willing to suffer the punishment for my acts.” Yang Kai directly offered an apology. Although they didn’t manage to do anything, Qu Hua Shang’s reputation would be affected if this incident was known to others.

After all, outsiders wouldn’t believe that nothing had happened under such circumstances.

...

“Hmph!” Xu Ling Gong sneered, “What’s the point of punishing you? You’ve already taken advantage of Qu’er. Can you undo it?”

Yang Kai hung his head low with a meek expression, “What do you want me to do, Senior? Please just tell me.”

Xu Ling Gong said coldly, “You know what you have to do now.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment, then let out a long sigh, “Don’t worry, Senior. When the Dao Theory Assembly takes place, I’ll take part in it and give you a satisfactory answer.”

It seemed that he had no choice but to participate in the Dao Theory Assembly now.
