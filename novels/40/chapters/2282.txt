After a short while, Yang Kai had finished putting his clothes on.

“How long do you plan to occupy my bed?” Gao Xue Ting looked at him coldly.

Yang Kai crawled out of the bed dejectedly and stood in front of Gao Xue Ting.

“Where did that Demonic Armament Artifact Spirit go?” Gao Xue Ting suddenly asked, “I heard that the Artifact Spirit was chasing after you, but I have already investigated its path along with Senior Xiao and the others today, yet its trail ends at Clear Jade Mountain, as if it had suddenly disappeared there. Even Senior Xiao couldn’t get any more clues about it. Where did it go?”

Yang Kai quickly shook his head in response, expressing that he had no idea about this.

“Then how did you escape from it safely?” Gao Xue Ting furrowed his brows.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Elder Gao, you also know that I have cultivated the Dao of Space, I’m an expert when it comes to escaping. At that time, I escaped to Clear Jade Mountain then used an aura concealing technique to hide in The Void. After the Artifact Spirit arrived and couldn’t find me, it left by itself. I also don’t know where it went.”

Gao Xue Ting observed him with her piercing eyes for a long while, as if she wanted to peer into his inner heart.

Yang Kai was quite diffident and he was afraid that she would notice any flaw.

After a long while, Gao Xue Ting nodded, “If I learn that you hid anything from me, then I won’t forgive you.”

Yang Kai wiped the sweat off his head then said aggrievedly, “I wouldn’t dare!”

“I also know that you don’t have such gall,” as Gao Xue Ting spoke, she sat down at the bedside and let out a sigh, “Honestly speaking, I have also been quite careless. If I had inspected this place carefully after the battle against that Demon, then we wouldn’t have to deal with so much trouble.”

Gao Xue Ting sighed with her remorse apparent on her face.

Upon hearing her, Yang Kai felt quite insecure. If Gao Xue Ting learned that the Demon who fought against her on that day was standing in front of her, then who knew what she would do?

Yang Kai quickly changed the subject, “That’s fate, you don’t have to rack your brain over this.”

Gao Xue Ting cast a glance at him then snorted and swung her hand, sending a ray of light out toward him.

Yang Kai was surprised, but he didn’t try to dodge it, as Gao Xue Ting wasn’t trying to attack him. He just stretched his hand and caught the light ray.

When he opened his palm and took a look, he saw a palm-sized token. This token was refined from unknown materials and the back of a cultivator was depicted on its back. It was a large and lofty back, seemingly able to overlook everything under the Heavens. This was just a design, yet Yang Kai could still clearly feel the imposing manner of the man.

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth suddenly twitched when he noticed that the back depicted in the design resembled Wen Zi Shan’s.

As for the front side of the token, only two large characters were carved there.

Azure Sun!

The whole token had a bright and dazzling golden hue.

“This is...” Yang Kai’s expression changed and he looked skeptically at Gao Xue Ting. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It’s an Identity Token of a disciple of the Temple,” Gao Xue Ting replied calmly.

“Huh...” Yang Kai was surprised and he could only chuckle bitterly and said, “But, Elder Gao, I’m not a disciple of the temple, and it isn’t appropriate for me to take this Identity Token.”

“From now on, you’re a disciple of the temple,” Gao Xue Ting replied.

Yang Kai was taken aback and he could only say, “Elder Gao, this is coercion... Why didn’t you solicit my opinion?”

Gao Xue Ting looked askance at him, “Didn’t I solicit your opinion last time? A long time has passed since then, haven’t you finished mulling it over yet?”

Yang Kai quickly explained, “I need more time to ponder over this. This matter is too complex and I haven’t had time to properly consider it. Elder Gao, please give me more time.”

“How long?”

“Thirty years... maybe fifty...” As Yang Kai said so, he noticed that Gao Xue Ting’s expression turned cold, and he could only say quickly, “However, ten or eight years is also fine...”

“Hehe...” Gao Xue Ting suddenly sneered.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but shiver. His whole body trembling as his feet cramped.

Gao Xue Ting said slowly, “It looks like you have misunderstood something due to my good temper. Do you think it’s so easy to deal with me and I have no prestige at all?”

“Surely not!”

“Then are you looking down on me, are you looking down on our temple?”

“Not at all!”

Gao Xue Ting coldly, snorted “Today, I told Senior Xiao and the others that you’re a disciple of our temple and I have obstructed Lou Chi from recruiting you. If you dare to refuse me again, then I’ll tell them tomorrow that you have been expelled from the temple. Are you aware of what you would face then?”

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat. He had no idea that Lou Chi planned to recruit him. It looked like his actions had been too eye-catching lately and he attracted the attention of many people. If he wasn’t protected by the halo of his fake status as a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, then the other Masters would quickly begin fighting over him.

Yang Kai suddenly understood why Gao Xue Ting had given him an Identity Token. She didn’t do so to force him to make a choice, but rather to protect him.

A while ago, she had inspected his body carefully, mainly because she was worried that something went wrong during his cultivation.

As he thought of this, a warm feeling welled up in his heart. He suddenly felt like it wouldn’t be a bad choice to join Azure Sun Temple, as long as he was in the care of such an Elder.

He let out a breath and cupped his fists with a relieved look plastered on his face, saying with a smile, “Then I’ll have to accept your invitation, many thanks for Elder Gao’s concern.”

Gao Xue Ting cast several glances at him then nodded, “You’re a sensible and promising young man!” She stopped for a moment then added, “But, your situation is quite special and you don’t have to follow the numerous rules of the temple. You can live as usual and the temple won’t interfere in your life too much. Understood?”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai rejoiced, “Understood!”

“However, whatever you do in the future, it’s only your business and you don’t represent our temple. If you dare to make any trouble for our temple, then... hmph, you know what will happen to you,” Gao Xue Ting looked at him with her dignified gaze then snorted coldly.

“I know, I know...” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, while his face broke into cold sweat again.

“I have nothing else to say, you have already taken the Identity Token and you’re now a disciple of the Temple. If you face any issues in your cultivation, then I can help you resolve them in my free time,” Gao Xue Ting said in an amicable manner.

Yang Kai was taken aback and he quickly began asking her about some questions he had regarding his recent cultivation.

Gao Xue Ting was quite conscientious and she replied carefully, not concealing anything about her own experiences and comprehensions of the Heaven Dao and Martial Dao.

Gao Xue Ting had assumed that it would be easy to guide a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Junior, but after she chatted with Yang Kai for a while, she became far more serious. All the questions raised by Yang Kai were related to some crucial and profound points that even she had yet to understand thoroughly. And so, the teaching session quickly turned into an equal discussion about their respective Martial Daos.

Yang Kai stayed in the City Lord’s Mansion until dawn before leaving and returning to his courtyard in the Qin Family Residence, seeking Qin Zhao Yang and asking for a private room he could use for secluded cultivation.

.....

Time quickly elapsed and a month or more passed in the blink of an eye.

On this day, Yang Kai finished his secluded cultivation, having already consolidated his cultivation that had just reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm not long ago.

In his secluded room, Yang Kai had just inspected his body and he was very satisfied with his progress. Yet all of a sudden, he detected something and his expression turned strange. He quickly took out the Insect Enslavement Bracelet then entered it with his Soul Avatar to check it.

When he had been in Azure Sun Temple, he had asked for a lot of Facetless Profound Grass from Gao Xue Ting and he had used them to nurture his Soul Devouring Insects. Over the last period, the Soul Devouring Insects had been devouring each other in the large jar and engaging a kind of evolution.

But, it was only on this day that they finally showed some substantial progress.

The Soul Devouring Insects were ranked eleventh in the Heaven List of the Exotic Insect List, a very high place, and they had been very useful to him in the Divine Ascension Mirror. It was due to this that Yang Kai now placed more hopes on them.

After he detected some disturbance, he quickly went to check on them.

The jar was as peaceful as ever, as if all Soul Devouring Insects were still asleep, but Yang Kai had refined the Insect Enslavement Bracelet and he had a thorough understanding of all insects in its sealed space. That’s why he knew clearly that the stillness was only a facade.

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn and he waited for a long time before he made up his mind. Weaving a seat of seals with his hands, he opened the jar.

When he peeked inside to take a look, he found out that it was filled completely with milky-white cocoons. There were cracks in many cocoons and evolved Soul Devouring Insects were crawling out of them, eating the remains.

As time elapsed, more Soul Devouring Insects emerged from their cocoons and a buzzing noise continued to echo inside the jar, as if a myriad of insects were gnawing on something.

“They’re so big!” Yang Kai was startled.

Originally, the Soul Devouring Insects were tiny organisms that couldn’t be seen with the naked eye and could only be discovered with Divine Sense. But, after they devoured each other and evolved this time, their size had increased greatly.

Each one was as big as a grain of rice and its body was covered by black patterns. These patterns had a demonic aura and it was obviously because they had once devoured an Ancient Demon’s Pure Demon Qi.

It wasn’t limited to just this, the Soul Devouring Insects looked more vicious than before and even Yang Kai was a little scared of them.

In less than a quarter of an hour, all of the Soul Devouring Insects broke free of their cocoons. Having gotten enough nutrition, those insects flapped their wings and flew out of the jar.

Yang Kai moved back warily and observed them from afar.

A cloud of insects quickly formed above the jar. The number of Soul Devouring Insects was obviously lower than before by a large margin, but their power and size were vastly improved.

Yang Kai was quite surprised. If he had travelled in the Divine Ascension Mirror with these insects, even if he ran into an Emperor Realm Master like Ban Qing, he wouldn’t have had to resort to cheap ruses and could have simply repelled him head-on.

After Yang Kai observed the Soul Devouring Insects for a long while, he suddenly issued them a command.
