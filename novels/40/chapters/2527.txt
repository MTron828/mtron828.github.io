Yang Kai’s face turned solemn, and condensing his Emperor Qi into both hands, he cautiously grasped at the Flesh Incarnation Fruit.

He plucked the fruit lightly, and the Flesh Incarnation Fruit plopped into his palm immediately. Yang Kai quickly placed it into the jade box he had prepared beforehand, and after placing several barriers around it, he put it into his Space Ring.

“Phew…” Yang Kai let out a sigh of relief. With this Flesh Incarnation Fruit, he would have a good chance to refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill, but he would need to improve his Alchemy skills first.

Although he was now an Emperor Grade Alchemist, he did not have much experience in refining Emperor Grade spirit medicines, so if he hastily tried to refine the Flesh Incarnation Fruit, his chances of success would be quite low. This might be the one and only Flesh Incarnation Fruit left in the world, so if the refinement failed and the raw materials were destroyed, Yang Kai’s would definitely develop a kind of heart demon, and it may even affect his Alchemy abilities in the future.

Fortunately, there were bounteous Emperor Grade herbs here, so he could use some of the relatively low-value spirit medicines for practice to improve his Alchemy skills before confidently refining the Flesh Incarnation Pill.

After a moment of inspection though, Yang Kai found that all the spirit medicines in this medicine garden were invaluable. Nevertheless, the Flesh Incarnation Fruit still stood out from the rest in terms of rarity and value.

He immediately started collecting the rest.

There were only two medicine gardens with a few hundred herbs planted in them, but it still took Yang Kai more than two hours to collect them all.

There were still about twenty trees left in place, including the Flesh Incarnation Fruit Tree.

There were numerous buds and flowers remaining on these fruit trees, so it was not impossible for them to bear new fruits after a few hundred, or thousand years, so Yang Kai did not dare to touch any of these trees.

After doing this, Yang Kai took a look at Gao Xue Ting and found that she was still focused on healing her injuries, and it seemed that she would take a long time to wake up.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry, so he simply sent his Divine Sense into the Sealed World Bead and retrieved Zu Hong’s and Ju Tian Qing’s Space Rings.

As expected, there was a large number of Emperor Grade spirit medicines inside their Space Rings, most likely collected from this ancient medicine garden.

In addition, there were many valuable treasures in these rings, enough for Yang Kai to make a fortune.

The Emperor Artifacts, the Burning Ocean of Stars Blade and the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal, that belonged to the two also fell into Yang Kai’s hands.

The Burning Ocean of Stars Blade did not interest Yang Kai much as, although it appeared to be very powerful, he did not primarily use such weapons and had no plans to refine it. Besides, refining an Emperor Artifact would not greatly improve his strength.

Likewise, the Burning Ocean of Stars Blade could not be considered a broadsword, so it was unsuitable for Zhang Ruo Xi.

On the contrary, Yang Kai was more interested in the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal. This Artifact was not an ordinary Emperor Artifact. It seemed to be able to seal the Souls of fallen Monster Beasts and then could release them during a battle to fight one’s enemies without great consumption of the owner’s strength.

This could be given to Zhang Ruo Xi.

Although Zhang Ruo Xi seemed to prefer swords, the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal was powerful, and it was definitely a good treasure for her. As long as Zhang Ruo Xi could refine it, her strength would definitely increase by leaps and bounds.

Considering all this, Yang Kai pushed his Spiritual Energy to erase Zu Hong’s Soul Imprint from the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal.

After a while, there was a flash of light, and the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal became grey and dull. Yang Kai then tossed it into his Space Ring, reminding himself to give it to Zhang Ruo Xi when he left the place.

After waiting for a while, Gao Xue Ting still showed no signs of waking up, so Yang Kai took out his Alchemy Furnace and some Emperor Grade herbs, and began refining on the spot.

A day later, Yang Kai, who was concentrating on Alchemy, suddenly noticed that someone was watching him. His expression became alert and glanced to his side without stopping his hands, only to meet with Gao Xue Ting’s elegant and delicate eyes.

Feeling guilty that she had interrupted Yang Kai’s Alchemy, Gao Xue Ting did not speak and simply motioned him to continue.

The worst thing that one could do to an Alchemist during Alchemy was to disturb them. Gao Xue Ting had known Yang Kai was an Alchemist for a long time, otherwise, it would be impossible for him to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill when he was in the Four Seasons Realm.

She felt a little uneasy knowing that her gaze interfered with Yang Kai’s focus when he stole a glance at her.

On the contrary, Yang Kai did not seem to be affected and just smiled broadly at her, “Elder Gao, wait a moment, this disciple will finish the Pill Condensing step soon and will be able to speak to you freely as soon as the pill is done.”

Having said so, Yang Kai immediately turned solemn and immersed his focus into Alchemy again. Gao Xue Ting continued watching in amazement.

A mysterious Pill Condensing Technique was performed by Yang Kai, one that had extremely perplexing hand seals and seemed to harmonize extremely well with the Heavenly Way.

Gao Xue Ting was astonished as her beautiful eyes suddenly glowed with a strange light, observing Yang Kai’s movements firmly, unwilling to let slip a single motion.

She discovered that Yang Kai’s Alchemy’s technique could actually stimulate deep thoughts on her Martial Dao and show her an unseen side of the Heavenly Way. It was as though all her understanding of Martial Dao was being consolidated as she watched, an unbelievable experience. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As one of the top Sects in the Southern Territory, Azure Sun Temple naturally had its own Emperor Grade Alchemist. Although there was only one, he was nonetheless still at Emperor Grade Alchemist.

Gao Xue Ting once had the honour of observing this Emperor Grade Alchemist perform Alchemy from a distance, but compared to Yang Kai’s Alchemy technique, the Temple’s Alchemist seemed rather unsightly and incomparably clumsy.

That Alchemist could be described as a child flailing a hoe wildly in the field, while Yang Kai’s Alchemy could be described as a warrior wielding a sword, dancing in the moonlight.

The two were not comparable at all.

[Who did he learn Alchemy from? How can he be this accomplished at such a young age? Not only that, but he has also entered the Emperor Realm.]

Gao Xue Ting was shaken as she suddenly realised that all those so-called genius disciples were completely eclipsed by Yang Kai’s current achievements. Even the children of the Great Emperors could not compare with him.

Time seemed to pass by quickly, but it also seemed to have slowed down. Just when Gao Xue Ting was immersed in a peculiar sentiment, her resonance with the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao suddenly disappeared.

She was slightly startled, and when she fixed her eyes on Yang Kai, he was already performing another technique, bellowing, “Condense!”

*Dinglingling… *

Suddenly, a clear and sweet sound emerged from within the dainty Alchemy Furnace. Yang Kai turned his head to listen to it and his brow furrowed slightly, as if he was a little dissatisfied with the results of his Alchemy.

Gao Xue Ting couldn’t hide her surprise seeing this.

Although she was not an Alchemist, she knew that this Spirit Pill should have been successfully refined. From the scent wafting out of the furnace, it was easy to infer that this Spirit Pill was Emperor Grade, and the quality should not be low.

[Is he still not satisfied? What extent does he need to reach to be satisfied?]

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and patted the Alchemy Furnace, causing the lid to fly off and three round and fragrant Spirit Pills to zoom out, where Yang Kai promptly caught them and sealed them into a jade bottle.

After taking a look, Yang Kai curled his lips and threw the bottle into the Space Ring. Turning his head, he looked at Gao Xue Ting with a smile and said, “Sorry for making Elder Gao wait for so long, how are you feeling?”

“I’ve almost completely recovered.” Gao Xue Ting replied, “It was not a fatal injury anyway.”

After a pause, she wondered, “How did you know that I was here? And you even came here directly.”

Yang Kai answered, “Junior Sister Lu Wen sent me a message…”

He briefly explained the entire journey from how he was passing by Earth City to receiving Lu Wen’s request for help.

After listening, Gao Xue Ting smiled, “It seems that I wasn’t meant to die here today. Who would have known that you would pass by Earth City at just the right time.”

Her smile seemed to cause thousands of flowers to suddenly bloom, and the whole world became a shade dimmer. She was a cold woman, and she rarely smiled, so this was Yang Kai’s first time seeing her smile since he had known her.

Yang Kai could not help but stare blankly.

Gao Xue Ting quickly retrieved her smile at his abnormal expression, looking a little uncomfortable.

Yang Kai urged her, “Elder Gao, you should smile more, it’s beautiful.”

“Have some respect, stop your flattery!” Gao Xue Ting snorted coldly.

Yang Kai grinned, “I can guarantee that if you smiled at Temple Master Wen that way, he would definitely be mesmerized by your beauty!”

Gao Xue Ting snorted, “Mesmerized? More like he would immediately ask me if I had fallen into cultivation dissonance and then force a purifying spirit pill into my mouth; then I would spit that Spirit Pill right back at his face!”

Yang Kai’s jaw dropped, “How could Temple Master Wen be so unchivalrous?”

He imagined the scene she just described and was speechless for a while; but from the tone of Gao Xue Ting’s words, it seemed that this had happened before.

Cold sweat beaded on his forehead and he wisely changed the subject, “By the way, Elder Gao, this disciple has prepared something for you.”

“Something for me?” Gao Xue Ting was surprised, and asked suspiciously, “What is it?”

Yang Kai took out a jade bottle and handed it over, “Here.”

Gao Xue Ting took it and opened the cap to look inside. It was a round and red Spirit Pill, exuding a rich blood aura.

“Mad Blood Pill!” Gao Xue Ting’s beautiful eyes lit up.

She already possessed a Mad Blood Pill and had wanted to take it to stimulate her potential to help Yang Kai who was under siege yesterday, but Yang Kai stopped her in time.

So, she recognized it at a glance.

“This is a High-Grade Mad Blood Pill. Its effects will be better than your original one by thirty percent, and after taking it, as long as you only exert your strength within a stick of incense, the backlash will not be too harsh. You would be able to fully restore after a long rest, and it will not damage your foundation. Disciple can only refine this level of Mad Blood Pill at the moment, so keep this one for now and only use it if absolutely necessary. I will refine a better one in the future to replace this one.”

“A better one…” Gao Xue Ting was speechless. This was already a High-Rank Mad Blood Pill, so what could be better? This was already the highest quality for normal Mad Blood Pills, any higher meant that it would either have to have formed Pill Veins or Pill Clouds, but that was not a feat one could easily achieve.

Yang Kai had mentioned that her Mad Blood Pill was of low quality, and made by a lousy Alchemist. He was obviously worried that Gao Xue Ting’s foundation might be damaged from taking that Mad Blood Pill, so he made another one for her.

Considering all these, a warm feeling filled her heart.
