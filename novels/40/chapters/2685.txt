Yang Kai stretched out his hand to grab the tray and lifted the red cloth covering the auction item, revealing a puppet in the shape of a wolf about a hand tall sitting quietly on the tray.

“Is it real?”

Yang Kai turned to ask Ye Hen.

Ye Hen confirmed excitedly, “That really is our Thousand Leaves Sect Heaven Grade Puppet, Howling Moon Heavenly Wolf!”

Ye Hen almost burst into tears at the recovery of the treasure he lost.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and tossed the Heaven Grade Puppet to Ye Hen casually, “Keep it.”

Yang Kai was a little surprised. As far as he could remember, these Heaven Grade Puppets were as large as mountains when he saw them guarding the strategic positions inside Thousand Leaves Sect, and did not expect that they could shrink to this extent.

The Puppet Dao from Thousand Leaves Sect was really extraordinary.

Ye Hen was dumbfounded, “But Young Master Yang bought this, this Ye… does not deserve it!”

This puppet was worth a great value of one million High-Rank Source Crystals, and Ye Hen was too embarrassed to take it for free.

“This thing can only display its full potential in your hands. Take it, there may be a fierce battle later,” Yang Kai smiled.

The puppets of the Thousand Leaves Sect were refined with specific Secret Techniques and were also driven by specific Secret Techniques. The two were closely connected, so even if others could utilize them, they would not be able to exert the puppet’s full power, which could only be unearthed by cultivating those corresponding arts.

A realization dawned on Ye Hen after listening to Yang Kai’s words and he stored the Heaven Grade Puppet silently.

The maidservant trembled, feeling uneasy for obvious reasons. She forced a smile out and spoke to Yang Kai, “Honoured Guest, the auction item has been delivered, please pay the Source Crystals!”

Yang Kai dismissed her offhandedly, “No hurry. I still have more to bid. I will settle my bill when the auction is over to avoid trouble.”

“Ah,” the maidservant frowned, and looked at Yang Kai pleadingly, “But… but we do not have such a custom, this servant cannot make such a decision on her own.”

Yang Kai glanced at her, “Since you don’t have the authority, go ask someone who does.”

The maidservant shivered violently when she received this glance and did not dare to talk anymore, leaving immediately to make her report.

In the meantime, another maidservant appeared on the stage up with a tray; after which Hua Qing Si announced dully, “The second auction item, a Thousand Leaves Sect Heaven Grade Puppet, the reserve price is one million High-Rank Source Crystals!”

She stood there quietly when she finished.

Yang Kai shouted immediately, “I want this for one million. I hope everyone will give me face.”

After saying this, the audience went into an uproar as the gathered Emperor Realm Masters ground their teeth with hatred.

When the first auction item, the Howling Moon Heavenly Wolf, came out, Yang Kai had said the exact same thing, and those Emperor Realm Masters really did give him face. No one competed with him, but it was simply insatiable of him to do the same thing for this second auction item. He really did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.

But when they thought of Yang Kai’s ruthlessness and the Monster King behind him, most of the Emperor Realm Masters still chose to remain silent, refusing to take the lead. Some other Emperor Realm Masters who did not know Yang Kai were quietly mocking him in their private rooms, but also did not continue bidding for the item.

Although their voices were small, it was still audible to the many clear-sighted and clear-hearing Emperor Realm Masters present.

They were a little worried that Yang Kai would start violently beating people, but unexpectedly, the room where Yang Kai was located remained silent.

At this time, the maidservant who sent the Howling Moon Heavenly Wolf to Yang Kai reported to Wu Ming carefully about what had happened earlier.

Wu Ming was furious as he cursed through gritted teeth, “That bastard, he’s trying to openly rob us!”

One million High-Rank Source Crystals was still a lot of wealth for him, and looking at Yang Kai’s actions, it was clear that he did not ever intend to pay and was simply brushing him off.

Wu Ming believed that even when the auction ended, Yang Kai would not pay a single Source Crystal.

Such a practice was far more than petty and shameless.

“Sir, what should we do now?” The maidservant was in a panic. She had sold something from her own auction floor for nothing, and any credibility Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce had before would be gone when the news spread out. However, she was just a simple maidservant and really had no right to make such important decisions. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Wu Ming’s eyes flickered for a while before he snorted coldly, “It’s fine, just ignore him.”

In any case, Yang Kai would die today, so no matter how many good things there were in his Space Ring, they would ultimately be theirs. [Go ahead, take these for free, we’ll see who has the last laugh when the dust settles.]

The maidservant was startled and pleaded, “But he has started bidding again. What should I do if he wins another auction?”

Wu Ming waved his hand, “Just deliver the items to him.”

“Ah!” The maidservant was appalled. She did not expect Wu Ming to give such an answer. However, before today’s auction started, the maidservants had been notified that they must follow Wu Ming’s orders, so she did not dare to refute. Still, she felt quite strange as she wondered what was going on today.

Wu Ming sneered slightly as he glanced at the private room where Yang Kai sat and thought, [You can have fun all you want now, but Honoured Master has planned for every possibility. Today you will die without a burial!]

The whole auction was not only a means to draw out Yang Kai, but also a strategy to stall for time. While the auction was being held, his Honoured Master was already secretly preparing to spring his trap. By then, no one would be able to escape from here.

As expected, no one competed in the bidding for the second auction item, and soon it was delivered to Yang Kai’s private room by a different maidservant.

As if she was under orders, the maidservant did not request Yang Kai for payment again. After delivering the item, she simply retired respectfully.

Yang Kai casually tossed it to Ye Hen again.

Ye Jing Han and Du Xian were secretly excited watching from the sidelines, thinking that all the Heaven Grade puppets of the Thousand Leaves Sect could be recovered from the auction. If this was the case, the Thousand Leaves Sect may be able to make a comeback. Many of the Sect’s ancient books and records were brought with them into Emperor Heaven Valley, so the Sect would surely regain its glory one day if they took back these Heaven Grade puppets and recruited more disciples.

“The third auction item…” On the stage, Hua Qing Si continued to host the auction with an indifferent expression.

But before she could finish her words, Yang Kai shouted again, “I want it for one million.”

It was no doubt another Heaven Grade Puppet.

The Thousand Leaves Sect originally had ten Heaven Grade Puppets, but after Liu Yan took away a White Tiger, only nine were left. It would take some time to buy all the items one by one.

An old voice in room seven asked in a voice mixed with deep dissatisfaction and indignation, “This friend, do you want us to give you face again?”

Yang Kai grinned, “It would be great if you could.”

The old man in room seven snorted coldly, “Face must be earned, not given by others.”

“Good, everything can be done once or twice, but not thrice.” Someone immediately agreed, the voice seemingly coming from room thirteen. “This is an auction, so naturally the one who bids the most will win. What you’re doing, my friend, is just too disrespectful.”

“Boy, you already have two Heaven Grade Puppets, you should be satisfied and not participate in the following auctions.”

“Yes, that’s right! We all travelled from far and wide to come here just for these Heaven Grade Puppets. Your appetite is far too big if you want to take them all for yourself.”

As soon as someone spoke out, others would definitely follow suit. They did not know anything about Yang Kai before, so they laid low and let Yang Kai pick up two big bargains for nothing; however, while everyone was discussing him in private, they realized that this little bastard was just putting up a front and not really taking action. This greatly boosted their boldness and they began openly criticizing him.

Who did not want good things? By the looks of Yang Kai’s attitude, if the others did not speak up again, he really would sweep up everything in this auction. How could anyone tolerate such an insult? It was already a great kindness that they let him take away two Heaven Grade Puppets at the reserve price. He needed to learn to be content.

Many people secretly regretted it. If they had known that this boy was just bluffing, they would have bid against him for the first two items. Generally speaking, the prices of the first few auction items were relatively low, and the prices would slowly increase as more items were auctioned.

Only those who knew that a Monster King was accompanying Yang Kai, and saw Yang Kai beat up Wu Ming earlier, kept silent, sneering in their hearts as they thought about the terrible fate awaiting these vocal Emperors would soon face.

Yang Kai’s boldness to beat Wu Ming into a pulp in front of the entrance of the auction house proved that he was reckless and dauntless. It would be courting death to look for trouble with such a madman, because none of the Emperors present was even as strong as Wu Ming.

Since this matter would not affect them though, they decided to sit back and watch the show.

But what surprised them was that Yang Kai did not react with violence to these people, simply remaining silent before drawling, “Since you don’t want to give me a face, then go ahead and start bidding. Why run your mouths so much?”

As soon as this remark came out, many people were shocked, thinking, [What happened? Does this boy have a split personality? That’s impossible! Could it be that he felt threatened by the number of people here?]

After all, it was never a good idea to provoke public anger. It did not matter if he beat Wu Ming, if he was stubborn and continued to ask others to give him a face, he would probably offend all the Emperor Realm Masters present.

Once that happened, he would be unable to handle so many enemies at once.

Considering all this, the Emperor Realm Masters who had been silent the whole time could not help becoming eager.

Without Yang Kai acting as an impassable obstacle, they did not need to be afraid of anyone, and whoever had the stronger financial resources would obtain the Heaven Grade Puppets.

As soon as they reached this conclusion, many Emperor Realm Masters straightened their backs and rolled up their sleeves, preparing themselves for the coming competition.

The old man in room seven smiled slightly and spoke in a manner of seniority, “Child, this is the atmosphere that an auction should have. In that case, this Old Master will start spicing things up. One million and one hundred thousand!”

“One million and two hundred thousand!”

“One million and five hundred thousand!”

“Two million!”

Shouts came in from all directions one after another as the Emperor Realm Masters in the big private rooms started to take action. In less than ten breaths of time, the value of the Heaven Grade Puppets with a reserve price of one million High-Rank Source Crystals rose rapidly to three million, and the bidding was far from over.
