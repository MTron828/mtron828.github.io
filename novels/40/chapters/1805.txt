Chapter 1805, Use A Different Body To Refine It

Refining the floating continent’s Source had been progressing quite smoothly, and as long as Yang Kai could absorb some of it into himself, he would be finished, but now he had actually fallen short at the last step.

Yang Kai calmed down, and recalling the scene he just witnessed, his brow furrowing as he muttered, “Could it be that the power from two Sources can’t coexist?”

At that moment, he clearly felt Shadowed Star’s Source Strength burst out from his body, like a bird guarding its nest, forcing the floating continent’s Source Strength back.

This caused Yang Kai to be injured by the backlash.

“Source Strength is like the physical manifestation of a Cultivation Star’s World Principles, and each Cultivation Star can only have one set of World Principles, so a person...”

“I’ve already refined Shadowed Star’s Source Strength, which means my body is now closely connected with Shadowed Star’s World Principals. It’s likely difficult, if not impossible to accommodate other World Principals now...”

“En, that must be it!”

As he thought about it for a while, Yang Kai came to his own conclusions about the situation. Although this was just his speculation, he believed that it was at least close to the truth.

It was precisely because he had already refined Shadowed Star’s Source that he could not refine the floating continent’s Source this time.

From this point of view, there never having been a cultivator who was Star Master of two Cultivation Stars in the history of the Star Field was not because these past Origin Kings were not strong enough, but rather because it was simply impossible.

After understanding this point, Yang Kai’s could not help feeling quite depressed.

This situation was akin to a starving man sitting before a feast but being unable to eat anything, a helpless and depressing prospect.

Did he have no choice but to abandon this Heaven-sent opportunity?

Without even mentioning that the floating continent’s Star Source had just been born and was far easier to refine than a developed Cultivation Star’s, this Star Source was already marked with his Soul aura, so it fully met the requirements for him to refine. This was a rare opportunity, one would not come across in ten thousand years. Yang Kai simply was not willing to give up on the Star Source in front of him.

However, his body could not accommodate another Star Source, which made him helpless.

Yang Kai sat on the spot and healed his wounds while racking his brain to think of a way around this problem.

Even after thinking about it for a long time though, he couldn’t think up a good solution, frustrating him deeply...

Suddenly, he seemed to think of something and the irritability in his eyes gradually cleared, giving way to a shining brightness. The more he thought about it, the bigger his smile became.

“I’m so stupid, how could I have not thought of this sooner,” Yang Kai smacked his head.

The next moment, he waved his hand and summoned his Stone Puppet and Firebird.

“What are Master’s orders?” Liu Yan appeared and asked in her usual cold tone.

“You two, see if either of you can swallow this thing. Whoever can swallow it can go ahead. If both of you can, split it in half!” Yang Kai pointed at the Star Source in front of him and said lightly.

Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan were his biggest helpers, and both had strength equivalent to an Origin King, so if they could swallow this Star Source, it would definitely be of great help to them.

Since he could not refine it, he would simply let his two helpers give it a try. If they could succeed, it would still be a big boost to him.

Liu Yan heard this, turned her head towards the Source, and a flash of fear appeared in the depths of her beautiful eyes the next instant as she shook her head in amazement, “Master, although I don’t know what this thing is, I’m afraid I cannot swallow it. It has a strange strength permeating it that is too profound, and if I swallow it rashly, I’ll certainly be destroyed by it.”

“En, it’s Principal Strength,” Yang Kai nodded and explained.

Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit, so she wasn’t very knowledgeable and naturally didn’t recognize the Star Source, but her instincts were incredibly sharp, so she knew at a glance what was dangerous for her.

The Star Source in front of her gave Liu Yan a distinct sense of danger.

Principal Strength was profound and mysterious, so how could Liu Yan dare to swallow it rashly?

Not only did Liu Yan react like this, even Xiao Xiao, who always acted a bit dull, just stared at the Star Source in front of him with his pair of small eyes but did not move.

In the past, when Yang Kai allowed him to swallow something, Xiao Xiao would charge forward and swallow it whole. In any case, this was part of his innate talents, a Divine Ability that allowed Xiao Xiao to swallow practically anything.

Now though, he was hesitating, undoubtedly because he felt threatened by this Star Source.

Xiao Xiao was able to swallow the Ore Star’s Source because the Ore Star had already died and its Source had been fragmented, leaving behind only some remnants which were not too powerful. But the floating continent’s Source was complete and although it was newly formed, Xiao Xiao was definitely not able to consume it.

Seeing their appearances, Yang Kai immediately knew that the two of them were powerless and lightly said, “If that’s the case, you can go back.”

With a wave of his hand, Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan were put away again.

Next, the Golden Stone Puppet appeared in front of Yang Kai.

Stone Puppet Embodiment!

Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan were not able to swallow this Star Source, but Yang Kai wasn’t too concerned because there was still his Embodiment. The reason why Xiao Xiao and Liu Yan were called out first was because Yang Kai wanted to give them an opportunity to enhance their strength.

Since they were powerless, Yang Kai could only bring out his Embodiment.

Even if his own body could not accommodate two sources, wouldn’t it be fine if he just used a different body to refine it?

Moreover, with his Soul Clone attached to his Embodiment, it was equivalent to his second self, so it would obviously fit perfectly with the Soul Brand which was already integrated into the Star Source.

After Yang Kai sent his Soul Clone into the Embodiment, the latter opened its eyes, which quickly went from dull to bright and active.

Yang Kai controlled the Embodiment, sat it down in front of the source, and repeated his actions from before to display the Star Refining Art.

Time passed as the expression on Yang Kai’s true body remained extremely solemn.

Although he felt that his idea was not wrong, he didn’t dare say so for certain until the results came out. If even the Embodiment could not refine this Star Source, he could only reluctantly give up.

His next recourse would be to allow his relatives and friends to try to refine it to see if they could grab hold of this opportunity; however, they would need to wait until they became strong enough, at least Origins Kinds, and only the Heavens knew how long that would take.

After a long silence, Yang Kai, who was paying close attention to the Embodiment and the movement of the Star Source, raised his eyes and his face showed a look of ecstasy as a burst of hearty laughter escaped from his lips.

At that moment, the Star Source’s strength was being drawn into the Embodiment at a slow and subtle speed, without any repulsion.

[It worked!]

Sure enough, his hypothesis had been correct, the reason why his true body was unable to refine it was because the two Source Strengths were unable to coexist in a single body, so all he needed to do to solve the problem was change bodies.

His Embodiment was equivalent to his other self, so if the Embodiment became Star Master of the floating continent, it was equivalent to him becoming Star Master of the floating continent.

Although it was not quite the same, this way, Yang Kai would still be the Star Master of two Stars.

Tsk tsk... If the truth was spread, it would likely cause a sensation across the entire Star Field.

Yang Kai was in a great mood but he quickly collected himself and didn’t dare act careless, paying even closer attention to the movement of his Embodiment.

Everything was proceeding in an orderly manner, and only after enough of the Source Strength poured into his Embodiment would the process be complete.

It is just... this process was a bit slow.

Yang Kai was somewhat dissatisfied observing this.

According to his estimations, it would take at least one or two months for the Embodiment to finish refining this Source while it had just been the blink of an eye for him to become Star Master of Shadowed Star back then.

However, this was because Yang Yan directly sent Shadowed Star’s Source into his body. The two processes could not be compared.

“Fine, I can spend the time on Alchemy instead!” There was no point in waiting here doing nothing, so Yang Kai stood up, pushed his Space Force, and disappeared.

There was no need to pay attention to his Embodiment as all that was left was to wait for the process to finish. Instead, Yang Kai figured he could take this opportunity to refine a few Spirit Pills.

His cultivation had reached the pinnacle of the Origin Returning Realm a while ago, so even back in the Severed World Yang Kai felt he had an opportunity to break through; however, at that time, the situation was quite dangerous, so he had to forcibly suppress this impulse.

The floating continent on the contrary was extremely safe and the World Principles were also complete. It was the perfect place to make a breakthrough and performing Alchemy could help trigger that breakthrough.

Yang Kai’s gains in the Severed World this time were not small.

After a while, Yang Kai arrived above the floating continent, spread out his Divine Sense, and after scanning around for a moment, he flew off.

Ten breaths later, Yang Kai appeared again.

Lu Gui Chen, who had been waiting in place, was shocked to see Yang Kai suddenly appear and he quickly ran over, holding the Space Ring in both hands with a flattering smile on his face and said, “Young Hero, everything is inside. Please take a look to make sure you are satisfied.”

After seeing Yang Kai’s methods, Lu Gui Chen had completely submitted, not daring to act disobediently.

“En,” Yang Kai faintly responded before taking the ring and sweeping it with his Divine Sense, raising his brow a moment later to look at Lu Gui Chen with a smile, “Your harvest these past few years has been quite good. “

“Haha...” Lu Gui Chen gave a dry smile, “I had nothing to do here except cultivate, so I wandered about often.”

“And you collected every precious herb you came across?”

“Young Hero is wise!”

“Idiot!” Yang Kai angrily cursed.

“Huh?” Lu Gui Chen looked up in amazement.

“You fool!” Yang Kai wore a sullen look, “You’re also an Origin Realm master, so how could you not know you can’t just collect herbs at will? Without being able to preserve these things properly, their medicinal efficacies will all pass quickly. Just look at these herbs, some of them are already half dead! How are you supposed to use them now? Seriously how stupid are you!”

Yang Kai was truly angered.

There were indeed a lot of herbs in the ring, and many of them were Origin King Grade, but because they were not preserved properly, all of them had a lot of their medicinal efficacies leak out, causing their value to shrink greatly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Any Alchemist who saw this scene would be furious.

Lu Gui Chen received this harsh scolding but did not dare to say anything, simply forcing himself to keep the stiff smile on his face.

Yang Kai eventually sighed, knowing that he could not blame Lu Gui Chen for everything. If he had at least a Space Ring, although a lot of medicinal efficacies would still have been wasted, the situation would not have been so bad. However, back then, everyone’s Space Ring had been taken away by Gui Zu.

As such, Gui Zu bore some responsibility for this matter.
