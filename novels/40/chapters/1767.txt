Chapter 1767, True Space Spirit Crystals

All around, there was nothing but chaos and emptiness, as if she had fallen into an endless abyss. Xue Yue was unable to help but squeeze Yang Kai’s hand tightly, her whole body clinging tightly to him, seeking a sense of security.

She had never had such a bizarre experience. Void Cracks were regarded by Origin Kings as terrifying existences, but this time, she had taken the initiative to rush into one.

She did not know what Yang Kai had to rely on, but under the circumstances, she could only take a leap of faith that this rude bastard who had assaulted her insensitively, would not put her in danger.

Yang Kai really did not let her down. Drifting through the endless darkness, Yang Kai showed no fear and instead just patted her hand.

Aware of Yang Kai’s comfort, Xue Yue’s mood immediately relaxed.

“What should we do now?” Xue Yue asked.

Turning around, she wanted to look for the entrance they had just stepped through, but she quickly discovered it was nowhere to be seen. Void Cracks were unpredictable, and the space here was not necessarily connected to the entrance they just went through. The entrance they just stepped through might be a few tens of thousands of kilometres away already, possibly even further, so naturally, it was impossible for them to simply go back the way they came.

“Don’t worry,” Yang Kai’s tone carried with it a rare gentleness as he spoke and laughed, “Just leave everything here to me.”

Xue Yue gently nodded. Yang Kai’s words seemed to be a reassuring magic, allowing her to relax in both body and mind.

“Such rich Space Force fluctuations... En... there should be something extraordinary here. It seems I should have entered a long time ago,” Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and checked his surroundings, seeming a little annoyed.

With a serious expression, he spread out his Space Force and felt the unique fluctuations in The Void around him, thoroughly enjoying the sensation.

This experience was of great benefit to his cultivation of the Dao of Space, and he certainly did not want to miss it.

After a while, he turned his gaze towards a certain spot and said, “Follow me.”

Saying so, he pulled Xue Yue along as he flew towards that direction.

Inside the Void, there was nothing but chaos, almost as if the world itself didn’t exist. There was not anything living here, nor any aura, nothing, a complete emptiness that far exceeded that of even a Dead Star.

Xue Yue could not feel anything at all except for the touch and temperature coming from Yang Kai’s hand, which she held onto tightly, afraid she would become separated from him.

In this damned place, even the passage of time seemed to have become extremely slow, but once Xue Yue stabilized her mind, she began to enjoy it.

Holding a man’s hand while crossing through a perilous journey. That man keeping away all dangers in front of her, allowing her to follow behind him with peace of mind, was a luxurious experience she had never had before.

As Third Young Master Xue Yue, the future successor of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, she would be the one to charge ahead and bear all obstacles under normal circumstances! She needed to establish prestige in front of her subordinates to firmly establish her position in Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce while hiding her gender, her voice, and even her mannerisms; an extremely exhausting way to live.

But here, she could put all of that aside and simply enjoy the feeling of being taken care of.

Yang Kai had said that it had not been easy for her, and perhaps he had simply said it casually, without thinking deeply, but these few words touched the softest part of Xue Yue’s heart, almost causing her to shed tears.

At this moment, her heart was warm, and she only hoped that this time would continue forever.

By now, if she still could not see that Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, she wouldn’t have been worthy of her status as the Young Master of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

However, she did not comment on it. A smart woman knew when to speak and when to remain silent.

She did not know how long it was, but while Xue Yue was still immersed in the atmosphere that warmed her heart, a few faint points of light suddenly appeared up ahead. These lights were quite dim, like distant stars.

“Haha!” Yang Kai laughed, feeling extremely happy, “As I thought, there are Space Spirit Crystals here! Luo Lan didn’t lie to me!”

Xue Yue was stunned for a moment before asking, “Those are Space Spirit Crystals? You entered this place because you wanted to find Space Spirit Crystals?”

“En!” Yang Kai nodded, speeding up.

The stars seemed to be quite dim and far away, but it only took Yang Kai half a stick of incense to reach them.

The light might have been faint, but in The Void, where there was nothing but emptiness, it was the only source of illumination.

Looking closer, each of these Space Spirit Crystals was about the size of a fist and had a hexagonal shape. They were crystal clear but seemed to have numerous streaks inside of them out of which obvious Space Force fluctuations flowed.

“They’re quite different from the ones I’ve seen before,” Yang Kai was quite surprised and did not rush to collect these few Space Spirit Crystals, but instead observed them with interest. These few Space Spirit Crystals in front of him were indeed vastly different from the ones he had seen before whether it was their form, or the energy fluctuations coming from inside them. The fine streaks, which almost looked like cracks, were of particular note as Yang Kai had never seen such a feature in other Space Spirit Crystals.

“Of course they’re different,” Xue Yue glanced at him as if she knew something.

“Why do you say so?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“These are true Space Spirit Crystals which have formed by pure Space Force, while the Space Spirit Crystals in the outside world are always found as auxiliary materials in different mineral lodes. Space Spirit Crystals mined in the outside world contain many impurities, and although they are still Space Spirit Crystals, they are incomparable to these in terms of quality and grade,” Xue Yue reached out and grabbed a piece of Space Spirit Crystal. The whole process was extremely easy, as if these Space Spirit Crystal were simply discarded here at will by someone. There was no difficulty in obtaining them. Pointing at the faint streaks inside the crystal, Xue Yue continued, “Look at this, the power contained inside of it is strong enough to affect its internal space. If one refines these using a special Secret Technique, once this Space Spirit Crystal is detonated, it would be powerful enough to cause space to collapse across a wide area. At that time, no matter who’s involved, I’m afraid they would suffer greatly.”

“Space Spirit Crystals can even be used like that?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested as he turned to look at Xue Yue thoughtfully, “Does your chamber of commerce have such a Secret Technique?”

“It should,” Xue Yue nodded, “I have heard of it before, but I have never actually seen such a Secret Technique.”

While she was talking, she handed the Space Spirit Crystal to Yang Kai and said, “Moreover, a Space Ring refined from this kind of Space Spirit Crystal will have a massive internal space, far superior to an ordinary Space Ring, but... I suspect no Artifact Refiner would dare refine such a Space Ring. No one would treat their life so lightly.”

While they spoke, the four Space Spirit Crystals in this place were collected by Yang Kai.

Probing one of them slightly, Yang Kai found that the Space Force contained in these Space Spirit Crystals was far beyond what he imagined. If he could collect just twenty of these crystals, it would be enough for him to arrange a Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array, and the distance that array could cover would definitely be farther than those he arranged before.

“This kind of Space Spirit Crystal can’t be stored inside a Space Ring, so how are you planning on storing them?” Xue Yue asked while looking at Yang Kai.

There was no need for her to remind him as Yang Kai had also discovered this problem.

He had just tried to put the Space Spirit Crystal into his Space Ring but found that it was impossible. The power contained in this Space Spirit Crystal seemed to interfere with his Space Ring.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai tried the Sealed World Bead.

The next moment, the Space Spirit Crystals were thrown into the Sealed World Bead!

Yang Kai could not help breathing a sigh of relief. The Sealed World Bead was an extremely high tier existence; after all, it was an Emperor Artifact and sealed an entire world with its own World Principles, so it had no difficulty accepting these Space Spirit Crystals.

Xue Yue was surprised for a moment before she laughed lightly, “It looks like you still have a lot of secrets on you.”

“Are you more interested in me now?” Yang Kai asked.

“Don’t flatter yourself!” Xue Yue snorted at him.

“I have many secrets, en... I’ll tell you what I can, when I can,” Yang Kai’s expression became serious and he said quickly.

Xue Yue slowly shook her head, “I don’t need to know this, I just want to have someone who can treat me as a real woman, that’s enough.”

Hearing her say this with complete sincerity, Yang Kai looked at her for a while before smiling slightly, taking her hand again, and flying forward.

After an hour, in The Void, a few more stars appeared up ahead...

Repeating this process, a few days later, the number of Space Spirit Crystals that had entered Yang Kai’s pocket had reached almost a hundred. This Void Crack seemed to be a breeding ground for Space Spirit Crystals with its extremely rich Space Force.

Xue Yue had been silently following Yang Kai, helping him to collect Space Spirit Crystals without any complaints.

The dangers of the outside Severed World seemed to have become extremely remote to the two of them, as if they had entered their own world that was separate from all others. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

On this day, Yang Kai was leading Xue Yue to continue searching for Space Spirit Crystal when Xue Yue suddenly called out, “Yang Kai, look over there!”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai stopped and turned his head in the direction Xue Yue indicated, but with just a single glance, his eyes bulged, and he called out in shock, “So many?”

In that direction, like there was a bright moon on a starless night, a dense collection of shimmering lights filled The Void, guiding them towards it.

After staying here for several days, Yang Kai naturally knew that each of these lights represented a Space Spirit Crystal bred from this place.

He had harvested about a hundred pieces up until now and was quite satisfied with that, but now, he realized that he had been far too conservative with his expectations.

This dense collection of lights numbered far more than a hundred.

A quick glance was enough to tell that there were hundreds, if not thousands!

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai could not help laughing as he dragged Xue Yue into his arms, hugged her, and planted a kiss on her face.

Being treated so roughly stunned Xue Yue for a moment before she bit her red lips and wiped her cheeks, angrily declaring, “You vulgar man!”

Yang Kai did not respond and simply dragged her over towards the cluster of lights as quick as lightning.
