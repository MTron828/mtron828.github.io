Fire Dragon Palace, the back of a certain mountain, the scenery was as beautiful and refreshing as a spring day.

Li Jiao was strolling leisurely in a flower garden, feeling at ease. Beside him, a young woman in a fine dress accompanied him on his stroll. Their fingers were tightly intertwined, and they looked very intimate. She gently snuggled against him with a contented smile on her face.

She was dressed in red; her face was like a peach blossom; her skin was fair, tender, and delicate. Her eyes had an unconcealable charm to them, and her gaze was so elegant that it was breathtaking.

The Dragonic Nature was a lustful one, and even though Li Jiao was not a Pureblood of the Dragon Clan, this trait was not absent in him. It gave him an extremely high libido as a result. As such, he had many wives and concubines in Fire Dragon Palace. Despite his numerous wives and concubines though, his favoured consort was undoubtedly Lady Hong, the woman currently standing next to him.

In the past, he would be intimate with Lady Hong whenever he had the free time, and as Lady Hong was well aware that her life’s happiness was tied to Li Jiao, she was dutiful and dedicated herself to pleasing him.

It could be said that none of the other wives and concubines he had could compete with her for his love. It used to be so, and it was even more so right now.

Lady Hong could tell that Li Jiao pampered her even more than before ever since he returned to Fire Dragon Palace two months ago. Even though he had always treated her very well, things had obviously changed a lot recently. He had not separated himself from her for two whole months, leisurely spending each day with her. It indicated just how important she was to him.

She could keenly feel the change in him, but she was wise and did not question him about it; instead, she took the opportunity to completely capture his body and his heart by showing him how gentle and loving she was.

“Palace Master, that flower is so beautiful,” she suddenly pointed to a big red blossom with a loving smile.

“Do you like it?” His tone was extremely gentle as he looked at her with a smile.

“Yes, I love it!” She nodded lightly, acting like a weak and obedient woman.

Smiling, Li Jiao stretched out his hand, plucked the flower, and turned to her.

She glanced at him with joy, lowering her head slightly as she allowed him to insert the flower into her hair. When she looked back up, she turned her head left and right, pursed her lips, and asked with a smile, “Is it pretty?”

Reaching out his hand to pinch her delicate face, Li Jiao couldn’t help but nod, “It looks beautiful, but you look even more beautiful.”

Upon hearing those words, she felt as if her heart was overflowing with sweetness. It made her entire body feel light and fluttery yet she still pretended to sulk and ask, “Palace Master, why do you only know how to tease me?”

[The Palace Master has really changed a lot recently! I wonder what he experienced outside. He treats me even better than before after his return and has become much gentler.] In the past, he would have gone into retreat to cultivate; however, he had not shown any interest in cultivating for the past two months and simply took her out on trips all day long, making the rest of his wives and concubines green with envy and jealousy. They claimed that she had snatched all his favour away.

“Hong’er, I will stay with you like this from now on, okay?” He asked softly, the reflection in his eyes as he looked at her was filled with nothing but her face.

Her tender body trembled, and when their eyes met, hers reddened slightly as she said emotionally, “I can’t keep you for that long, Palace Master. You still need to cultivate.”

“Cultivate? Why bother?” He sneered, “My cultivation journey has come to an end. I will never cultivate again in the future! I’ll spend all my time looking at flowers with you until we grow old together.”

Those words were like sharp swords piercing her heart. She was so moved by them that she couldn’t stop her tears from flowing out.

“Why are you crying?” Lifting his hand, Li Jiao wiped away the string of pearl-like tears on her face and chuckled, “It is said that women are made from water. It seems that saying is true.”

“Palace Master, you are so kind to me. Hong’er is happy,” she gently snuggled in his arms and soon a small patch of wetness appeared on his robes. Li Jiao had been very good to her in the past, but he had never been so sweet before. She immediately felt as though she had entrusted her life to the right person and no longer had any regrets left.

“What is this? We still have a long future ahead of us.” Li Jiao smiled, reaching out to pat her on the back with a gentle and rhythmic motion.

She squirmed in his arms and shyly whimpered, “Palace Master… I want…”

Li Jiao suddenly became energetic when he heard those words, raising his brow as he asked teasingly, “What do you want?”

Lady Hong pouted, hammered her tender fists against his chest, and coyly cried out, “Palace Master, you are so awful!”

Li Jiao roared with laughter, but all of a sudden, his voice caught in his throat and his expression darkened as he whipped his head and shouted, “Who goes there?!”

When he looked over, he saw that an extra person had appeared by the rockery at some point in time. That person crouched there quietly, watching the intimacy between him and Lady Hong with relish.

As soon as he saw that person’s face clearly, Li Jiao felt as if his soul escaped his body from fright and he cried out in a markedly higher pitched voice, “You…”

“Hello!” Yang Kai smiled and raised his hand in greeting, “I haven’t seen you in two months, but you are still the same, Brother Li!”

“Ah!” Lady Hong was startled and quickly jumped out of Li Jiao’s arms. Looking in the direction of the sound, her face turned bright red. [This person must have heard what I said just now!] Thinking back on how indecent she had been, she wished that the ground would open up for her to jump in. Her shame soon turned to anger as she stomped her feet and yelled, “Who are you?! How can you be so discourteous?!”

The words had just left her mouth when Li Jiao pulled her behind him. She had never met Yang Kai before, so she did not know him; however, Li Jiao knew Yang Kai very well.

“Palace Master Yang…” He sounded almost close to tears, “When did you come? You should have said something.”

[If I had to name one person who I never wanted to meet again for the rest of my life, it would definitely be this boy! Even the Dragon Clan cannot compare to this walking ill omen!] This person was practically Li Jiao’s nightmare, as well as his natural enemy!

Anytime he got involved with him, he would definitely suffer. The experience he went through recently was the best proof there was. It was simply an unbearable memory.

“I’ve been here for a while. I apologize for interrupting your fun. Please forgive me!” Yang Kai laughed.

[Apologize for interrupting my fun?! Don’t you feel embarrassed secretly spying on us?!] Li Jiao retorted in his heart. Even so, he did not dare to show anything in his expression and simply stared at Yang Kai cautiously, “Palace Master Yang… Why did you come here?”

“You can continue. I’m not in a hurry. We can talk when you’re done.”

Li Jiao’s expression turned frigid as he cursed to himself, [You completely ruined the atmosphere. What do you mean by continue?!] Then, he resentfully said, “Palace Master Yang, please get straight to the point. I’ll say this first, if you are here to collect your debt, then we have nothing to discuss.”

“I’m not here about the debt. Why do you always assume I’m here about that?” Yang Kai waved his hand dismissively before he stood up from the rockery with a serious expression and quickly said, “I just wanted to ask you for a favour, Brother Li!”

*Gudong….*

Li Jiao gulped hard. [Why do those words sound… so horrendously familiar!?]

The last time Yang Kai came to Fire Dragon Palace, he had said something similar. Because of that, Li Jiao was dragged to the Frozen Earth, entered the Revolving World, and wandered about the Western Territory. During that time, he faced countless life-and-death situations and nearly lost his life on multiple occasions. That experience was far too rich and colourful for his taste.

[I’ve lived for so many years and been through all sorts of hardships, but all the hardships I experienced have never been as crazy as one particular trip! And, you want me to do it again?! Are you insane?! All I owe you are some Source Crystals, so why do you have to bully me like this?!] He was tempted to simply fight it out with Yang Kai on the spot. Even if he died, it would still be better than being constantly tormented like this.

Still, those thoughts remained as mere fanciful thoughts as Li Jiao knew that he was definitely not Yang Kai’s match. The bloodline suppression could not be overcome with willpower alone.

“If I may humbly say, my strength is not high so I’m afraid I won’t be able to help you much, Palace Master Yang.” Li Jiao didn’t even have the intention to ask about the favour and simply refused it outright.

[I never want to get involved with you ever again! I want to live the rest of my days freely and peaceful, regardless of how much turmoil the world outside is in. I just want to live and grow old with my beloved!]

Yang Kai solemnly continued, “I want to go somewhere, and I need you to help me, Brother Li.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

[Damn it, are you ignoring me?! Didn’t you hear what I said?!] Feeling sad and angry at the same time, he muttered through gritted teeth, “Palace Master Yang, I’ve been very clear with you. I’m afraid I can’t help you with your favour, so please…”

“I want to go to Dragon Island!”

“Enough!” Li Jiao couldn’t suppress his rage anymore and roared. He glared at Yang Kai fiercely as if he was about to eat his flesh and drink his blood, but then he froze in shock before exclaiming, “Y-Y-Y-You… What did you say?! Where did you want to go?!”

“Dragon Island!”

“Aahh!” Li Jiao gasped as his complexion went as white as a sheet. He was silent for a long while before asking cautiously, “Palace Master Yang, are you insane?”

“Do you have a way?”

Li Jiao was rendered speechless. Taking a deep breath, he asked, “Palace Master Yang, don’t you know what kind of place Dragon Island is? Why would you want to go there?”

Yang Kai replied, “Zhu Qing hasn’t come back!”

Li Jiao immediately became happy when he heard those words and he blurted out, “Were you dumped?”

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai became angry out of shame, “She has her own considerations.”

Li Jiao obviously realized something and nodded, “Young Lady Qing is both strong and wise, if she chose to do this, it must have been for your own good. So, why are you asking for trouble by going to Dragon Island, Palace Master Yang?”

Yang Kai snorted, “It’s not certain who will be troubled.”

Li Jiao looked speechless, “If you want to go to Dragon Island, just go. Why did you come to me? What can I do to help you?”

Yang Kai explained, “You are Dragonborn; don’t you know the location of Dragon Island?”

Li Jiao blinked in response, “Why would I know where Dragon Island is? Palace Master Yang, what you say simply doesn’t make sense.”

“You really don’t know?” Yang Kai looked at Li Jiao.

Li Jiao shook his head, “I really don’t know.”

Yang Kai nodded gently, “If that’s the case, then I won’t disturb you any longer. This… uh, sister-in-law, please forgive me for disturbing your time together.” Saying so, he cupped his fists at Lady Hong, tapped his foot gently, and rushed straight into the sky.

[Is he gone? Did he leave just like that?] Li Jiao stared blankly at Yang Kai’s back. He could barely believe what he was seeing. He thought Yang Kai would be as forceful as he was the last time, but who knew he would be so reasonable this time around?

“Um… Was that the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace?” Lady Hong asked, looking in the direction Yang Kai was leaving, the blush on her face yet to fully recede. Having realized who Yang Kai was, she couldn’t help feeling scared. It was rumoured that the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace was the greatest devil who killed without batting an eye. Moreover, he was the one who annihilated Seeking Passion Sect.
