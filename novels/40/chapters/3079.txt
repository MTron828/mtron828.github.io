“Huh?” The cultivator, who had been keeping watch on the surroundings, suddenly grunted in a weird tone and looked dazedly at the Star Chart. Then, in a horrified voice, he uttered, “Young Lady, that asteroid… that asteroid…”

Lu Huai Shuang looked over and turned pale in an instant.

The light dot remained above the Star Chart, seemingly not having taken even the slightest damage after being hit by a barrage of ten Crystal Cannons.

“What is going on?” Disbelief was written all over Old Chen’s face. He had personally witnessed the collective power of those ten Crystal Cannons before. Even the strongest Masters in the Star Field wouldn’t dare to take such a blow head-on, so how was it possible that this asteroid remained undamaged?

What truly shocked him was that the Crystal Cannon barrage didn’t even manage to change the asteroid’s direction, as it was still heading towards the Starship even now.

“Evade it quickly!” Old Chen exclaimed.

With a helpless smile, Lu Huai Shuang replied, “It’s too late.”

If they were in empty space, they could possibly evade the asteroid and escape unscathed, given the Starship’s exceptional capabilities; however, they were now trapped inside an Asteroid Sea, where they were surrounded by asteroids of different sizes. There was no room to manoeuvre, so there was practically no way they could avoid the asteroid.

Indeed, it was too late. The light dot that represented the unwelcome guest on the Star Chart was about to collide with the Starship.

The only thing all of them could do was pray that this asteroid wouldn’t cause any serious damage, but this idea was undoubtedly unrealistic. Although the asteroid was small, the energy signature it gave off was astonishing. If they were hit by this asteroid, their Starship might not be able to bear the impact.

Through the crystal window, they could see a light dot flashing across their eyes like a falling star. Following that, a booming sound could be heard from somewhere on the Starship. The 300-metre-long Starship shook violently, and everyone inside it turned ashen in an instant. All of them thought to themselves in despair, [It’s over now. We’re all doomed!]

The rumbling sound gradually subsided though as the Starship slowly stabilized itself. Inside the cabin, everyone remained silent, and they only came to their senses a long time later.

[We’re alive! We’re still fine!]

After such a life-or-death moment, all of them still couldn’t believe what they had just gone through. The Starship wasn’t destroyed like they had imagined it would be. They seemed to have overestimated the destructive power of the asteroid. Nevertheless, the speed of the Starship was noticeably slower now, as it was apparent that there was damage that needed to be repaired immediately. Otherwise, they might fall into other dangers of the vast Starry Sky.

Lu Huai Shuang was the first to come to her senses as she ordered, “The ship has been damaged. Get some people to inspect the affected areas and begin repairs. We have to leave this Asteroid Sea as soon as possible to look for a place to anchor.”

It was then that all of them regained their senses and started taking action.

Lu Huai Shuang pressed her lips together and looked out at the Starry Sky through the crystal window. It was said that one was bound for good fortune after surviving a disaster. She hoped that would be the case here too.

The cultivators in the Starship then busied themselves with their own jobs. The Starship had slowed down due to the damage. Initially, they had estimated that they would need one hour to leave the Asteroid Sea, but it took them four hours to cross that gap. After leaving behind the asteroids in the borderless Starry Sky, they finally heaved a sigh of relief.

It wasn’t a great idea to allow a damaged Starship to navigate through the Asteroid Sea. Fortunately, all the cultivators in the Starship were well-trained, and they were excellent at controlling the ship, so they managed to stay safe till the end.

Now, they had to look for a stopover immediately and repair the Starship. After Old Chen pointed out a suitable location, Lu Huai Shuang ordered all of them to set sail in that direction.

Half a day later, above a desolate Star, the 300-metre Starship emerged from the clouds and landed on the ground slowly.

There were innumerable Stars like this one in the Star Field. Although there were countless Stars in the Starry Sky, only a small number of them were suitable for cultivators to reside and cultivate on. Only Stars with a complete Star Source that could nurture World Energy were qualified for cultivation. These kinds of lively Stars were called Cultivation Stars.

In contrast, there were Stars that were without any World Energy, and no one could possibly survive on them. These desolate Stars were called Dead Stars.

Some Dead Stars were originally Cultivation Stars. After the Star Source of a Cultivation Star slowly diminished and disappeared, such a Star would turn into a barren rock.

Meanwhile, some Dead Stars could be nurturing new life, and it could possess its own Star Source in the future. After a very long period of growth, such a Dead Star would become a new Cultivation Star. However, this kind of evolution took place over tens of thousands of years at least.

After the Starship landed somewhere on the Dead Star, the crews opened the hatches and streamed out of the ship to head to the damaged section. Although they had done some simple repairs earlier, they had to fully fix the damaged parts of the hull and Spirit Arrays before the Starship could navigate through the Starry Sky again at full power.

Lu Huai Shuang was now somewhat idle inside the Starship, so she decided to take a walk outside. Wherever she went, all the cultivators would salute her. There wasn’t any obscene light behind their gazes as they all truly respected her. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In Unending Star Field, everyone would praise the Eldest Young Lady from the Lu Family, who hailed from Morning Sun Star whenever she was mentioned. They all said that she was just as capable as men of the same calibre.

There were no male descendants in the Lu Family’s main line, and the Patriarch was old and frail. The entire Lu Family now depended on the Eldest Young Lady to manage and maintain it. When Lu Huai Shuang took over the Lu Family at that time, nobody thought she could succeed.

A woman was supposed to get married and nurture her children, so no one believed she could succeed as the leader of her family. However, all of them were proven wrong in the end.

Although she didn’t manage to bring the Lu Family to new heights, she didn’t allow it to decay or decline at least. The continued strength of the Lu Family was all thanks to Lu Huai Shuang’s efforts, and even their enemies had to acknowledge this fact.

Naturally, many people lusted after Lu Huai Shuang’s beauty and her family businesses. Beautiful women and wealth had always been attractive goals for men. The Lu Family was wealthy and had great potential for development, so it was expected that many men were drooling over it. If any man could gain Lu Huai Shuang’s favour, not only could he marry a beautiful woman, but he would also gain control over the Lu Family’s immense fortune, thereby reaching the heights in his life and shortening the years needed to achieve success. Countless men had proposed to her over the years, but none of them could win Lu Huai Shuang’s heart.

“My husband must be the most powerful man in the Star Field. His name must illuminate the Starry Sky just like the Sun. I’ll only marry the man who can achieve that.”

It was an outrageous demand as no man would admit that he wasn’t powerful. Upon self-examination, they would even think that they were the best, and no other men were comparable to them. However, nobody could brazenly say that their name could illuminate the Starry Sky just like the Sun.

Only a handful of Masters in the Star Field could be said to have achieved such status, but they were old men who were in the sunset stage of their lives.

[The Lu Family’s Eldest Young Lady is destined to spend the rest of her life alone. No man will love and treasure her. She will never experience how it feels to be loved by a man!] That was the bitter thought of those men who couldn’t obtain her. Since they couldn’t win her heart, they wanted her to live miserably for the rest of her life. Such men would never hope for her future to be bright, as they were already considered to be weak and unworthy by her.

As Lu Huai Shuang tread on the yellowish ground and smelled the humid air, she couldn’t help but knit her brows together. She was a woman, after all, so no matter how others regarded her or how capable she was, she still had her feminine qualities. The environment on a Dead Star was barren and bleak. On this Star, the yellowish sand was seemingly endless, and it was continuously carried up by the gusts of winds. The atmosphere was filled with fog, so she couldn’t see far into the distance, making for a gloomy and depressing atmosphere.

After walking for some time, she stopped in her tracks and wanted to stretch her back without caring about anyone’s opinions. However, she couldn’t even do such a simple thing because she had to uphold her mannerism and authority. She was exhausted, both physically and psychologically.

Standing there quietly, she tried to figure out this Dead Star’s history. Perhaps there had been a civilization on this Star a long time ago. Or maybe in the future, a bright civilization with interesting life would arise on this Star. Maybe somewhere on the sandy landscape before her, a cottage would appear, in which a man and a woman lived. The man would cultivate crops on the fields, while the woman would weave clothes in the house as they lived harmoniously together. Three to five years later, they would give birth to a son and a daughter, then they would take good care of their children. When they became old, they would travel the world together. After their death, they would be buried together in some unknown corner.

They wouldn’t need much money as long as they had enough. They also wouldn’t have to be powerful as long as they had each other. The more powerful a person became, the more difficult it would be to obtain the simple pleasures in life. Only those at the lowest level of the hierarchy would want to gain immense power and make a name for themselves, unaware of the sacrifices and difficulties such power would entail.

“Young Lady…” Someone suddenly called out to her.

Although Lu Huai Shuang’s imagination was disrupted, she wasn’t mad. Turning to look at the one who called her, she recognized him as one of the Lu Family’s guards. At that moment, he was looking dazedly at Lu Huai Shuang as shock and disbelief were written all over his face.

That was because he saw that Lu Huai Shuang was smiling. Although the smile wasn’t conspicuous, he could see that her lips had curved into a peaceful grin.

Lu Huai Shuang was a beautiful lady, and her smile made her look even more charming. He had joined the Lu Family a few decades ago, but since Lu Huai Shuang took over the family, he had never seen her smile like this.

Lu Huai Shuang pressed her lips into a line and asked impassively, “What’s the matter?”

The bodyguard hurriedly straightened his face and replied, “We’ve found something strange.”

Lu Huai Shuang frowned upon hearing that, “What is it?”

The bodyguard scratched his head as he didn’t know how to explain it. Their discovery earlier was so absurd that he couldn’t find the right words to describe it. Just then, a group of people walked out of the broken part of the Starship. They seemed to be carrying something as they rushed towards Lu Huai Shuang.

Everyone shifted their attention to them due to their strange behaviour. In just a short time, these people reached Lu Huai Shuang and dropped a person right in front of her. The person rolled on the ground for a bit before stopping.

With a frown, Lu Huai Shuang took a look and realized that the person was a young man. His clothes were torn apart, as though he had just gone through a great ordeal. His eyes were closed, and his face was pale. He remained unmoving on the ground after he was dropped.

Lu Huai Shuang couldn’t sense his aura, and he didn’t seem to be breathing, so she assumed he had passed away.
