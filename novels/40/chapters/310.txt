Bi Luo also had ideas towards Tranquil Phoenix Pavillion once and persistently begged Shan Qing Luo for several months to let her stay there, but ultimately did not receive approval.

Yet now, an unknown man was actually going to live in Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion, and Bi Luo couldn’t help but feel shocked.

[What’s the story behind this little brat? How can the Mistress value him so highly?!]

Surprised, she constantly glared towards Yang Kai, and a thick look of jealousy and reluctance filled her beautiful eyes.

“Running around all the way here, you must be tired. Have a good rest today and let me finish my work. Once I’m done, I’ll come talk with you.” Shan Qing Luo said sweetly.

Yang Kai’s face remained indifferent, and he blankly stared at her, not saying anything.

People under the eaves have to bow.

Just as Bi Luo was about to clap her hands again and summon a few maids to escort him, Shan Qing Luo said, “You take him to Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion personally.”

Bi Luo trembled, unable to hide her surprise, but still hurriedly nodded, “Yes!”

Shan Qing Luo leaned over and quietly whispered to Yang Kai, “Little bastard, don’t bully her too much, she and I grew up together, she is my precious little sister.”

“Got it,” Yang Kai laughed helplessly.

“Let’s go!”

Bi Luo then led Yang Kai off through the palace.

Following behind this enchanting girl, Yang Kai casually observed his surroundings and found that Shan Qing Luo’s palace was indeed very quiet. Although outside there was a prosperous boisterous city, within these walls there wasn’t the slightest noise, instead everywhere was filled with fragrant aromas. Every path and corridor was meticulously cleaned and was completely free of dust.

From time to time, they would pass by a few pretty maids, all of whom would respectfully greet Bi Luo before curiously glancing towards Yang Kai.

During this entire trip, he had not come across a single other male.

After a short while, the pair arrived at Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was an extremely elegant loft, a total of three stories high, neither big nor small. Overall it was quite tasteful with plenty of neatly arranged planters decorating it. Each of them was filled with blooming fragrant flowers.

“Hey...” Bi Luo shouted towards Yang Kai and quickly stepped towards him to block his path forward, “Careful where you step, don’t trample over these flowers, all of them were carefully grown by Mistress herself.”

“Ah...” Yang Kai nodded indifferently, not caring about the resentful tone in her voice, knowing that this little girl had already formed a very poor image of him in her heart.

[This damn bastard!] Bi Luo cursed in her heart. This little brat didn’t appear the least bit formidable, and neither his dress nor his temperament was in any way noble. Why did her mistress value him so highly?

On top of that, her mistress had specifically told him not to bully her!

[Was he somehow capable of beating me?] Bi Luo simply couldn’t understand.

If not for Shan Qing Luo specifically ordering her to treat Yang Kai with respect, Bi Luo would have already tried to teach him a harsh lesson.

Entering the building, the pair walked up to the second floor. When Bi Luo opened the door a sudden look of joy appeared on her face as she hurriedly rushed inside, completely ignoring Yang Kai. The first thing she did was head straight for the large soft bed in the middle of the room and quickly jumped onto it while wrapping her arms around a giant pillow nearly as tall as she was. Holding it close to her, she gently sniffed the lingering scent it was stained with.

As she inhaled this fragrance her entire face couldn’t help but fill with an extremely happy expression.

[This was Mistress’s pillow, the pillow Mistress once slept on, it still has Mistress’s scent on it...]

Bi Luo felt like her soul was fluttering, and her face gradually turned red.

Yang Kai on the other hand couldn’t help but frown towards her and secretly found all of this somewhat funny. It was obvious that that this little girl held Shan Qing Luo as an object of absolute worship in her heart, or else she wouldn’t be putting on such a vigorous performance.

However, while this little girl laid there, her prominent well rounded bottom was fully displayed.

Looking around carefully at this boudoir, Yang Kai eventually nodded, “Not bad!”

Bi Luo instantly woke up from her trance and quickly got up from the bed. Her large round eyes glared towards him, as she gritted her teeth, “Not bad you say?”

Yang Kai nodded succinctly. This was a bedroom designed specifically for a woman. It seemed a bit strange for him to live here, so giving it a satisfactory rating was the most he could do.

“Haha... good, good!” Bi Luo ground her teeth and angrily retorted, “This is the place where Mistress lived in while she was growing up. I spent so long begging her to allow me to live here, yet never receiving permission, but now some smelly little brat from who knows where not only doesn’t know how to show appreciation for it and actually dares denigrate it as just ‘not bad’?”

“Uh...” Yang Kai stared back at her slightly stunned, as he tried to figure out why she was so hostile to him.

Scratching his nose lightly, he embarrassedly replied, “Ms. Bi Luo, do you have some kind of misunderstanding about me?”

“Hmph, who do you think you are!?” Bi Luo stood up angrily, still holding the giant pillow in her arms as she angrily stomped towards the door.

“Do you plan to take that pillow away with you?” Yang Kai asked stiffly.

“This is something Mistress once used.” Bi Luo shot back sharply, before suddenly halting, turning back and walking over to the bed once more. She quickly picked up all of the remaining bedding as well, “These were also used by Mistress.”

Glaring sharply towards Yang Kai like a little tyrant, Bi Luo wrapped everything up in her arms before arrogantly storming out.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel surprised. He knew that this girl’s worship towards Shan Qing Luo could now only be described as obsession.

However, in the end this was irrelevant to him, so he set aside such thoughts and simply sat himself down cross-legged on the bed.

He certainly couldn’t stay in Fragrance City for very long. With Shan Qing Luo’s cultivation technique demanding his life as a sacrifice, if he remained sooner or later he would die at her hand.

But now that this seductress’s strength had been fully restored, even if Yang Kai wanted to run there was no way he could.

It really was a case of harming oneself. If he had known earlier things would end up like this, he wouldn’t have given her that Myriad Drug Cream! Even if it was true that he had no choice back then and had in fact successfully escaped from the tiger’s cave as a result, what was the point if he now found himself trapped in the wolf’s den instead?

To make matters worse, that devilish woman had left some kind of spiritual mark on his body.

If he wanted to leave, he first had to deal with this seal.

Closing his eyes, Yang Kai carefully investigated his body.

Although Divine Sense was not meant to investigate one’s inner body, investigating his physical condition wasn’t too difficult.

After a few breaths of time, Yang Kai felt a faint yet formidable wisp of energy embedded on one of his ribs between his chest and abdomen.

Immediately he tried to use his True Yang Yuan Qi to disperse, but doing so proved fruitless.

Next he attempted to remove it using his Unyielding Golden Skeleton’s evil energy but once again met with failure.

The mark was incredibly persistent. It did no harm to his body and did not interfere in the slightest with the circulation of his True Qi, but it instead acted like a lighthouse in the blackness of night. No matter where he went, Shan Qing Luo could easily feel its energy.

If Old Demon was here everything would be fine! He could see exactly what this energy was, but unfortunately, since the Devil Lord incident, Old Demon had been secluding himself in the Coiling Dragon Stream. Yang Kai wasn’t even aware of his current status.

As he was attempting to remove this mark, Yang Kai suddenly became aware of a ray of Divine Sense floating beside him.

“Little bastard, what are you doing?” Shan Qing Luo’s voice immediately reached his ear, a hint of annoyance apparent in her tone.

“Going to sleep!” Yang Kai rolled his eyes and silently cursed this woman’s vicious means. He knew this mark would allow her to track him, but he hadn’t expected that even tampering with it would draw her attention.

Shan Qing Luo Jiao simply snickered lightly, “Don’t waste your time; that mark is my Soul Seeking Seal, unless I personally want to remove it even a peak Immortal Ascension Boundary master can’t dispel it. As long as that seal is present, no matter how far you run, I can still find you!”

“There’s no need for this,” Yang Kai complained with a bitter look upon his face.

“Hehe...” Shan Qing Luo giggled happily, “Who told you to be so unfaithful; if you were a little more honest I wouldn’t have to take such measures. Just rest for tonight, tomorrow I’ll come look for you, I promise.”

“Do as you please.”

“Hmph, heartless bastard!” Shan Qing Luo cursed, quickly taking back her Divine Sense.

Helpless, Yang Kai could only give up his attempts to crush this Soul Seeking Seal and settled down for the night.

The next day.

While meditating, Yang Kai’s concentration was disturbed by the sound of footsteps coming downstairs.

A moment later, a knock came from his door.

“Come in!”

When the door opened, a mature elegant woman walked in. Her face was adorned with a warm friendly smile.

It was impossible to tell how old this beautiful woman was, but from her looks alone she seemed to be no more than twenty five. She had a wonderfully curved body, and her pair of peach blossom like eyes seemed shine with a captivating lustre. A light scent wafted from her body, which caused all of one’s sense to go dull. With delicate snow white skin and a potent naturally born charm, even if she wasn’t quite on the same level as Shan Qing Luo her allure was did not miss by much.

However, the spring-like appeal of this woman had a rich quality to it as opposed to Shan Qing Luo’s delicate intoxicating aura.

Smiling pleasantly towards Yang Kai, she softly spoke, “Did Young Lord sleep well last night?

“Yeah.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The mature beauty stepped forward lightly, walked up to the bedside and bowed elegantly as she let out a light breath, “That is good to hear, this servant has been sent by the mistress to attend to Young Lord’s needs, Young Lord may call me Yun Li.”

“These two have also been assigned to you.” While introducing herself, Yun Li quickly nodded once, immediately summoning two beautiful young girls dressed in maid outfits from the hall.

One of them appeared gentle and tranquil, while the other seemed dignified and elegant.

Whether it was the mature beauty or these two young girls, each of them had their own unique appeal and charm.

“This is a Ruo Yu.” The beautiful woman gestured towards the gentle and quiet young girl before turning to the dignified and elegant young girl, “And this is Ruo Qing!”

“Ruo Yu/Qing greets Young Lord!” The two quickly bowed elegantly. Whether it was their demeanor or their temperament, it was in no way inferior compared to those young ladies from great noble houses. Everything about them was impeccable.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but stare blankly for a moment, unable to figure out what that’s seductress Shan Qing Luo was thinking sending these three great beauties to serve him. No matter which one it was, they would definitely arouse the instincts of any man to conquer them.

Even without mentioning the fresh and vibrant appeal of these two young girls, the great beauty Yun Li’s temperament was only worse than Shan Qing Luo by a tiny margin, and on top of that she had a unique advantage over these young girls in the form of her extremely well developed body. Coupled with her pair of spring peach eyes, it was like she was constantly exuding an air of enchantment.

[Is this her idea of a soft appeal?] Yang Kai’s heartbeat quickened slightly.

The beautiful woman Yun Li simply continued smiling, “Mistress has said that while Young Lord is in Fragrance City, all of his daily needs will be attended to by we three.”

“I’ll be imposing upon you then!” Yang Kai replied in a lukewarm tone.

“Of course, Young Lord is an honored guest after all.” Yun Li smiled as she elegantly replied. However, a hint of flush suddenly crept into her expression as she whispered, “Mistress has also said that any request Young Lord has, this servant must satisfy!”

“Any request?” Yang Kai’s heart suddenly clenched as he immediately understood the subtle meaning in these words.

Seeing his reaction, this mature beauty gently nodded. Even though she was an impeccable servant with a finely refined temperament, Yun Li couldn’t help her gaze from becoming slightly erratic, and she became somewhat unnerved and was almost afraid to look at Yang Kai.
