In a head-on confrontation, the stronger won.

When Yang Kai’s violent Divine Sense surged forward, crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood along the way, pursuing his opponent’s Divine Sense back to his Knowledge Sea and tearing open his defences, the man couldn’t help stumbling backwards and crying out in pain.

No longer possessing the aloof demeanour of a Senior Brother anymore, he was reduced to a simple man suffering unbearable torment.

Yang Kai also trembled as his face turned pale.

However, he grit his teeth and charged towards his enemy at remarkable speed without saying a word.

“Senior Brother Zhou Yi!” Chu Fei exclaimed in shock.

From his point of view, this Senior Brother named Zhou Yi had only stared at Yang Kai for an instant before both of them shook violently and turned pale. Senior Brother Zhou Yi had been forced to retreat several steps while Yang Kai took this opportunity to approach, a cruel and merciless light filling his eyes.

Chu Fei was still a Third-Order Origin King, so he had detected the fluctuations of Divine Sense just now, but what he could not believe was that, it was Senior Brother Zhou Yi who had actually suffered the bigger loss in that brief confrontation.

Seeing Yang Kai not retreat but instead attack, Chu Fei hurriedly shouted to warn Zhou Yi.

But how could he act in time?

As soon as his voice fell, Yang Kai had already rushed up to the cultivator named Zhou Yi and a five coloured glow from his Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi covered his fists as he struck forward towards his enemy’s chest.

*Hong...*

The world vibrated fiercely as a violent force burst out and Zhou Yi was directly pounded into the ground, leaving behind a human-shaped pit as dust filled the air.

Seeing this scene, Chu Fei felt a sense of deja-vu as it was so similar to what had happened to him three months ago. Suddenly his face turned pale as he trembled in place, while his two Junior Brothers put on an even more embarrassing display as they called out in alarm and hurriedly retreated for fear of being implicated.

“How could this be?” Chu Fei was completely dumbfounded.

He thought that Yang Kai would definitely be taught a severe lesson if he invited Senior Brother Zhou Yi to avenge him, and now, with all the masters from Protector Bian’s faction out of the Sect, no one could stop him.

Today, he was going to get his revenge and humiliate Yang Kai, but how could he have anticipated that the Senior Brother he invited would be beaten to the ground by Yang Kai in a face-to-face encounter.

The bizarre scene before him caused Chu Fei to doubt his eyes.

It wasn’t until this time that Chu Fei noticed Yang Kai’s cultivation was no longer at the Second-Order Origin King Realm but had instead reached the Third-Order. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How could he have made a breakthrough in that damned Ice Cliff?” Chu Fei’s heart shook as he realized that he had made a mistake this time.

In Blue Feather Sect, there had always been a convention. Any disciple that was confined in the Ice Cliff and did not die would become highly valued, and if that disciple was able to gain some insight or even break through in the Ice Cliff, they would immediately become an elite disciple of Sect, causing their status to soar up to the sky.

Over the years, many Senior Brothers had risen to fame because of this.

After all, the Ice Cliff was formed by an Emperor Realm master’s single strike and was suffused with profound Emperor Pressure and Ice Principles. Being able to break through in that kind of environment showed just how talented a cultivator was.

And now, Yang Kai was undoubtedly such a disciple.

If this news spread, it would definitely attract the attention of the Sect, and this Junior Brother, whom Chu Fei hated deeply, would instantly come to possess much higher status and importance than him. At that time, he would only be able to look up to Yang Kai. As for revenge, there was no need to even dream of it anymore as Yang Kai not coming to find trouble with him would be a blessing.

Many distracting thoughts passed through Chu Fei’s mind as he quickly understood that if he could not solve this matter properly today, it would become a catastrophe for him, causing him to panic internally.

Just as Chu Fei was secretly scolding Zhou Yi for being useless, a low growl filled with rage suddenly rang out, “Boy, you court death!”

This voice was filled with unspeakable hatred, like a wounded beast’s roar tinged with cold murderous intent.

Chu Fei’s eyes lit up and he was called out with joy, “Senior Brother Zhou!”

The low roar was from Zhou Yi, who had been punched into the ground by Yang Kai.

Although Yang Kai had not held back, Zhou Yi was a First-Order Dao Source Realm master, so how could he possibly be killed so easily? After becoming disoriented after his loss during their Divine Sense confrontation just now, he had been unable to prevent Yang Kai’s follow up attack in time.

Now that he had come back to his senses, he was naturally enraged.

As he shouted, he leapt up and turned a vicious glare towards Yang Kai, his eyes bloodshot as killing intent radiated from his body.

If he had only accepted Chu Fei’s request to meddle in this matter reluctantly before, after being punched by Yang Kai, he now personally wanted to butcher him.

After being beaten to such an extent by a Junior Brother who was in a lower realm, how could Zhou Yi wash off this shame with anything other than blood?

The surrounding space began to stiffen as the anger of a Dao Source Realm master was even able to affect the ambient World Principles to a certain extent. Wind began to gather towards Zhou Yi, whipping his hair into a frenzied dance as his aura continued to sharply rise.

Yang Kai tensed up as he instinctively felt a sense of crisis surge up in his heart, so he directly used his Demon Eye of Annihilation without any hesitation.

His left eye suddenly turned golden as a narrow pupil containing a mysterious and majestic power that had an incredible suppressive effect on one’s Soul burst forth.

As their eyes met, Zhou Yi could not help feeling startled because he could feel the strange force coming from this golden eye affecting his thoughts and will.

In his Divine Sense exchange with Yang Kai, he had suffered a small injury, so now facing the Demon Eye of Annihilation, he was naturally at a disadvantage.

Yang Kai seized the opportunity to display his most powerful Soul Secret Technique, “Blossoming Lotus!”

A lotus bud suddenly appeared in his left eye and in a flicker shot into Zhou Yi’s eyes.

Everything in front of Zhou Yi suddenly disappeared and all that was left was this lotus bud. The bud madly began extracting his Spiritual energy and slowly blossomed, revealing a kind of strange, deadly beauty.

Yang Kai currently had an advantage over Zhou Yi in terms of Soul cultivation, so how could he not take advantage of it? As soon as the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique came out, Yang Kai took the initiative to attack again.

Before Zhou Yi could react, Yang Kai shot out dozens of Golden Blood Threads which, under his exquisite Divine Sense control, twisted and turned into a golden net that wrapped up Zhou Yi.

This was just one of the myriad transformations possible for Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Thread.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai did not hesitate to use another Secret Technique, morphing his right arm into a vicious dragon claw before he thrust it out towards Zhou Yi’s chest.

Now that things had developed to this point, it was either Yang Kai died or Zhou Yi died. The latter’s murderous intent was not just a deterrent, it represented a real desire to kill Yang Kai.

Against someone who wanted to seriously kill him, Yang Kai would not show mercy.

“Brother Yang, don’t!” Liu Xian Yun called out in alarm from behind.

If Yang Kai really killed Zhou Yi, it would no longer be possible to resolve this matter, but as she did not have a way to calm the situation in front of her either, she could only shout instinctively.

Yang Kai turned a deaf ear to her cries as his expression remained cold and indifferent as he made his resolve to quickly kill the enemy before him.

Seeing the dragon claw about to penetrate his chest, Zhou Yi managed to shake off the influence of the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique at the critical moment and roar, “Boy, you dare!”

With a clatter, the lotus image in Zhou Yi’s eyes shattered and his murderous intent, which had stagnated somewhat, soared upwards again. At the same time, his First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation exploded vigorously.

“Anguished Wind Palm!” Zhou Yi shouted as he stuck out a palm covered in rich Wind Attribute energy, creating a storm-like vortex that tried to chew through Yang Kai’s right arm.

*Kacha...*

A harsh grating sound echoed as the dragon scales on Yang Kai’s right arm broke apart. Even the dragon claw itself wasn’t able to maintain its shape properly.

Although the First-Order Dao Source Realm was only a single Minor Realm above Yang Kai’s current cultivation, because Zhou Yi’s Saint Qi had been completely transformed into Source Qi, his true combat power had far exceeded that of an ordinary Third-Order Origin King.

What’s more, First-Order Dao Source cultivators had touched upon the threshold Principles and could slightly mobilize them to enhance their techniques.

What Zhou Yi cultivated was undoubtedly the Wind Attribute, and his Anguished Wind Palm obviously contained all his perceptions and comprehensions of the Wind Principles.

Wind Principles were swift and flexible, so this Anguished Wind Palm was both terrifyingly fast and sharp.

Feeling the approaching murderous intent made Yang Kai’s complexion change drastically, but rather than retreating, he grit his teeth and pushed his dragon claw towards Zhou Yi’s chest with even more force.

“You...” Zhou Yi’s eyes bulged as he desperately pushed his Source Qi to protect his body, but even then, he was unable to stop Yang Kai’s sharp dragon claw.

Under the terrifying penetrating power of this dragon claw, Zhou Yi’s defences were akin to paper.

In an instant, Zhou Yi’s heart was grasped by Yang Kai!

The next moment, the Anguished Wind Palm’s attack struck Yang Kai.

However, the instant Zhou Yi’s palm was about to make contact, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly flickered and disappeared, causing the violent blast of wind to hit nothing but air.

When the lingering power of this palm dissipated, Yang Kai’s figure reappeared, as if he had never even moved.

Nihility!

By using his Nihility Secret Technique, Yang Kai had merged his body with the void temporarily, thus avoiding the majority of the Anguished Wind Palm’s power.

However, a part of the attack’s force still blasted into Yang Kai’s body, ripping into his physique and wantonly damaging his physical body.

Yang Kai’s vitality roiled in his chest and he could not stop himself from coughing up blood.

“You’re not dead?” Zhou Yi exclaimed in shock.

He was certain Yang Kai would die under his palm, after all, Yang Kai’s hand had grabbed hold of his heart, so there was no way he could dodge. Zhou Yi was sure that his Anguished Wind Palm was enough to rip apart any Third-Order Origin King in a frontal collision.

What Zhou Yi couldn’t figure out was how Yang Kai seemed to have only suffered some small injuries and not taken any major damage.

What kind of Secret Technique did he just use? This boy had somehow been able to avoid his attack without even moving, it was almost as if he didn’t exist at that moment.
