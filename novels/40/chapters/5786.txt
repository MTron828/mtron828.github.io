Yang Kai was certainly no match for three Pseudo-Royal Lords; in fact, given his condition, he couldn’t even deal with one Pseudo-Royal Lord. He had been contending with the Black Ink Clan for many years, and he frequently came across opponents he couldn’t defeat, but he managed to survive until now because he firmly believed that even if he couldn’t defeat the other party, he would be able to run away.

Given his mastery over the Dao of Space, he was unmatched when it came to escaping.

A temporary retreat wasn’t a sign of weakness; he just needed to wait for a chance to strike back.

Including Mo Yu, Yang Kai had been hunted down by three different Royal Lords before. One of them was killed by him even though he had no idea how, and the other was lured to the Chaotic Dead Territory and eliminated by Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan. Only Mo Yu was still alive and kicking.

Since Yang Kai could escape from true Royal Lords, he naturally wasn’t afraid of mere Pseudo-Royal Lords. More importantly, the Black Ink Clan didn’t have any Heaven Sealing and Earth Locking techniques. If he freely manipulated Space Principles, these Pseudo-Royal Lords wouldn’t even be able to touch him despite joining forces.

However, the situation was unusual at that moment.

With his Human Self and Monster Self inside his body, his Small Universe was in turmoil; as such, as Yang Kai manipulated Space Principles, he realised that he was unable to use his Space Secret Techniques smoothly.

The turmoil in his Small Universe caused everything to destabilise. Even the Space-Time River around Yang Kai could hardly be sustained. The moment he reappeared, the Space-Time River suddenly came apart and dispersed. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Kai turned pale as he sported a solemn expression.

He didn’t expect that such a thing would happen after he let his Human Self and Monster Self inside his Small Universe; now, it seemed that he was in a perilous situation.

No one had cultivated the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art before, so no one could teach him anything about it or warn him of any dangers of cultivating it. He had planned to choose a safe place and prepare thoroughly before using this Secret Art; however, the situation the Humans were facing didn’t allow him to make any preparations at all. As such, he could only take a risk.

The three Pseudo-Royal Lords hadn’t noticed this anomaly, but the instant they detected his aura, they still turned around and charged towards him.

Yang Kai certainly wouldn’t stand still and wait for death, so he promptly dashed off to widen the gap between him and his enemies. At the same time, he spent some energy circulating the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art.

Strictly speaking, the Secret Art devised by Shi was divided into two parts. The first part was about splitting one’s Soul to cultivate two Selves. That was the foundation as well as the preliminary preparation, the key to success so to speak.

Yang Kai had completed this part. Over the years, both his Human Self, Fang Tian Ci, and his Monster Self, Thunder Shadow, had grown to be independent beings. They had reached the limits of their respective Realms, so there wasn’t much room for improvement for them.

The second part was what Yang Kai was currently doing. By circulating the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art, he could unite his three Selves. After integrating the powers of the two other Souls, he would be able to massively expand his Small Universe and thereby shatter the Open Heaven Realm Method’s innate shackles.

When Fang Tian Ci and Thunder Shadow entered Yang Kai’s Small Universe, the powers of the two caused everything to descend into upheaval, especially Fang Tian Ci. He was also an Eighth-Order Master, so he too had a massive Small Universe in his body, which caused an enormous impact on Yang Kai’s own Small Universe.

That was the reason a person couldn’t accommodate another cultivator in the same Order into their Small Universe.

As Yang Kai’s Small Universe trembled, everyone in the Void World was apprehensive. The World Tree clone’s illusory phantom appeared, its gigantic tree crown like an umbrella that covered the entire sky.

Meanwhile, a battered Yang Kai was dashing forward to escape from the three Pseudo-Royal Lords while madly circulating the Three Selves Source Reconstitution Art at the same time.

Just then, a Dragon Roar was heard reverberating across the Small Universe. The next moment, a Golden Dragon phantom that was 99,999 metres long appeared. The Golden Dragon was the visual manifestation of Yang Kai’s Divine Spirit Source.

The Phantom Dragon covered a large part of the World, and when it appeared, all the living creatures were exposed to its Dragon Pressure and felt the urge to bow to it.

After his trip to the Dragon Pool back then, Yang Kai could be considered a pure-blooded Dragon Clan member. That was the reason the Ancient Dragon Elders from the No-Return Pass wanted him to record his name on the Dragon Tome and found the Yang Family lineage so that there would be more Dragon Clan descendants in the future.

However, Yang Kai had never considered himself a true member of the Dragon Clan. Turning into a Dragon was his way to deal with large swaths of weak opponents or singular powerful enemies. He would always regard himself as a Human.

All the same, his beliefs wouldn’t change the fact that he was a pure-blooded Dragon Clan member.

The appearance of the Golden Dragon showed that his Source had been fully stimulated at this moment.

If he wanted to integrate the powers of his other two Selves, he had to make use of his Source.

The instant the illusory phantom Golden Dragon appeared following the Dragon Roar, Fang Tian Ci and Thunder Shadow sported solemn expressions.

Thunder Shadow looked at the Golden Dragon while feeling his power stir in his body. Suddenly, he asked, “Second Brother, have you flirted with many women over the years?”

Fang Tian Ci broke into laughter, “Why are you asking this question at this point?”

Thunder Shadow smiled meaningfully, “Think about it. Since both of us are Big Brother’s Soul Clones, if you’ve been intimate with some woman, after Big Brother assimilates both of us, the women you’re in love with will probably go looking for him.”

Fang Tian Ci was stunned and wondered, “Is that so?”

Thunder Shadow replied matter-of-factly, “Of course. Both of us come from him, after all. Regardless of what we’ve done, he’ll have to take responsibility for everything.”

Fang Tian Ci couldn’t help teasing him, “It seems that Big Brother will be in big trouble, then. You must’ve been with many female Monsters in the Myriad Monsters World over the years.”

Thunder Shadow refuted seriously, “Nonsense. I focused on cultivating while in the Myriad Monsters World and have never done anything I would feel ashamed of.”

Then, he winked at the other man, “So, have you really flirted with some women?”

“No,” Fang Tian Ci shook his head, “I’ve always been honest and righteous, so why would I flirt with random women?” Then, he sighed, “However, when a man is brilliant, he’ll always attract many women’s attention. I’ve been feeling troubled because of that.”

Hearing that, Thunder Shadow pursed his lips and muttered, “It seems that Big Brother isn’t such a good thing compared to us.”

Both of them were Yang Kai’s Soul Clones, so strictly speaking, they had inherited Yang Kai’s temperament. As such, they were the reflection of Yang Kai’s disposition.

The two of them exchanged glances and guffawed.

“If you two are done chit-chatting, hurry up and help, otherwise, I’ll be killed soon!” Yang Kai shouted.

As even his use of Dao Strengths was in turmoil, Yang Kai found it hard to use his Space Secret Techniques. Since three Pseudo-Royal Lords were hunting him down, he was in a perilous situation. He could still run away for a while as he had put some distance between him and them, but as time passed, that distance would surely shrink.

Moreover, he could feel that Mo Na Ye had been paying attention to him and trying to shake off Yang Xue, but to no avail.

Faced with the Chaos Spirit King, Yang Xue wasn’t a match for it, but it wasn’t hard for her to keep Mo Na Ye pinned down; after all, Mo Na Ye was her equal in cultivation, and wasn’t in peak condition. He was injured even before the current battle broke out, and then he had spent some effort fighting the Eight Trigrams Formation, leaving him both wounded and weakened.

Since Yang Xue could tell that Mo Na Ye wanted to harm Yang Kai, she naturally wouldn’t let him go.

Inside Yang Kai’s Small Universe, Fang Tian Ci and Thunder Shadow sported serious expressions. Although they had no idea what was going to happen next, they were aware of their fates after the memories in their Souls were fully unsealed.

They had been cultivating for many years for this moment.

At the very least, they had lived their lives to the fullest, travelling around and experiencing many wonders of the Universe.

Without resistance, they emptied their minds and let their Soul turn into nothingness.

The Golden Dragon continued to roar, and as its Source Strength shook, Fang Tian Ci and Thunder Shadow resonated with it. Gradually, their figures became blurred and were engulfed in a layer of golden light.

A moment later, two gigantic golden figures shot into the sky.

Everyone in the Void World was paying respects to the Golden Dragon when they saw such a shocking sight. Presently, a gigantic golden leopard surrounded by lightning and an equally majestic Human figure were flying up towards the Golden Dragon.

No one had any idea what was going on; however, they had experienced several fantastical phenomena in the Void World over the years, and these incidents always subsided quickly; as such, they were already somewhat used to it.

Seven Stars Sect was the dominant Great Force in the Void World without any question. No one had yet managed to challenge their status over the past 100,000 years.

This couldn’t be helped though as the Dao Lord used to be a Supreme Elder in Seven Stars Sect. They still kept his position in the Sect and everyone from the lowest disciple to the Sect Master himself would frequently pay homage to his statue.

With such a natural advantage, it was only expected that they had an edge over other Sects.

As the most powerful Great Force on the continent, Seven Stars Sect had many satellite cities around it. The area could be considered the centre of the World.

About 20 kilometres away from one such city was the Fang Family Village. It used to be an ordinary village, but they had an Ancestor who grew to be a powerful cultivator and became part of the Void Dao Temple many millennia ago. The village had been thriving since then.

Presently, there were many descendants and cultivators in the Fang Family Village, including some Emperor Realm Masters. Their inheritance was just as great as some of the Sects with equally long histories.

When such an anomaly took place in the Void World, the Patriarch led the Fang Family members to salute the Golden Dragon and pray for their safety.

Nonetheless, when the Patriarch looked up and saw the face of the golden Human figure, he was thoroughly startled because he found the face familiar.

The commotion behind him made him realise that he wasn’t mistaken. The golden Human figure looked just like their famous Ancestor that used to live in their village over 10,000 years ago.

Fang Tian Ci was a legendary figure within the Fang Family, and it was because of his identity as a Void Dao Temple disciple that the Fang Family was able to thrive all these years.

It could be said that this Ancestor was the reason the Fang Family rose to power. Before him, the Fang Family was just one of many ordinary families in the Void World.

[Is that… Honoured Ancestor?]

The Patriarch could not be certain. After the Ancestor joined the Void Dao Temple, he gave the Fang Family some benefits before he left the Void World. There had never been any news about him since.
