Just then, Yang Kai thought of something. If the Second Elder of the Dragon Clan was as powerful as a Great Emperor, what about the Great Elder? The Great Elder was supposed to be stronger than the Second Elder.

In other words, there were two Masters who were supposedly as powerful as Great Emperors overseeing Dragon Island, which was a piece of shocking news.

In the past, when Yang Kai heard other people talk about how incredible Dragon Island was, he still couldn’t grasp the concept. Now, he had learned that there were two Great Emperor level existences living on this island. Taking other Dragon Clan members into consideration as well, nowhere else in this world was comparable to this kind of heritage.

“What is the Great Elder’s stance on this matter?” Yang Kai asked with a frown. Since the Second Elder had confined Zhu Qing to her personal island, there was no way she would let her go. If Yang Kai wanted to help Zhu Qing escape, he had to start with the Great Elder.

Zhu Lie replied, “The Great Elder’s name is Zhu Yan, and the Second Elder’s name is Fu Zhun. Do you get it now?”

Yang Kai arched his eyebrow, “The Second Elder is from the Fu Clan of the Dragon Clan.”

“Although the Zhu Clan and the Fu Clan are both from the Dragon Clan, we’re not exactly on good terms.”

Furious, Yang Kai yelled, “Since the Great Elder is from the Zhu Clan, why doesn’t he help Zhu Qing?”

Although he had never met Zhu Yan before, he started growing resentful of the old man now. [That old fart is so useless. If he can’t even protect his own people, what’s the point of him holding the position as the Great Elder? Why doesn’t he just resign and spend his retirement years somewhere else?]

Zhu Lie explained, “Zhu Qing has violated the rules and disgraced the Dragon Clan, so the Great Elder can’t help her even if he wants to.”

Thinking that it was all Yang Kai’s fault, Zhu Lie glowered at him. [If it weren’t for him, Zhu Qing wouldn’t have ended up being imprisoned.]

A similar case to this took place more than ten years ago; however, at that time, it was the Fu Clan that was the cause of the incident rather than the Zhu Clan.

That person also fell in love with a Human and even gave birth to a child. When Dragon Island got wind of the news, the Second Elder, Fu Zhun, was so enraged that she personally went to bring that Fu Clan member back to Dragon Island. Ignoring the other Dragon Clan members’ persuasion and pleas, she directly imprisoned that person in the Dragon Grave.

Only dying Dragon Clan members would enter the Dragon Grave, so it was basically the Dragon Clan’s Restricted Area. Entering that place was akin to getting a death sentence, so no one could ever hope to get out of it again.

That person, who had violated the Dragon Clan’s rules, was Fu Zhun’s favourite clan member at that time. She had personally raised her, and even regarded her as her daughter. However, Fu Zhun was impartial when the rules were concerned. She still stone-heartedly pushed that person into the Dragon Grave, leaving her to perish on her own.

Zhu Lie still remembered that, at that time, even the Great Elder had tried to persuade the Second Elder to give her a lighter punishment, but the Second Elder was unfazed and went on to punish her accordingly.

More than ten years had passed, but Zhu Lie still remembered the incident vividly.

Given this precedent, Zhu Qing was lucky enough to not have been thrown into the Dragon Grave directly, so there was nothing else she could ask for. It was exactly because of this incident more than ten years ago that the Great Elder decided not to make a plea for Zhu Qing.

The Second Elder was cold-blooded enough to push the one whom she regarded as her daughter into the Dragon Grave, so she wouldn’t have any mercy on a Zhu Clan member. If the Great Elder insisted on protecting Zhu Qing, the outcome would turn out to be the opposite of what was desired.

Now, it was thanks to the fact that Zhu Qing wasn’t pregnant that she didn’t get thrown into the Dragon Grave. Otherwise, she would have ended up in the same place as that Fu Clan member.

The Dragon Clan was a bunch of promiscuous people, and many male Dragons had bedded Humans and Monsters, bearing many children; however, it was a different case when the female clan members bore children from another race, which was a taboo within the Dragon Clan.

The main reason was that the ratio of men to women within the Dragon Clan was imbalanced. The female Dragons were much smaller in number, so every one of them was a treasure as well as the hope to sustain the Dragon Clan’s bloodline, which was why they were not allowed to get together with other races.

With a dark expression, Yang Kai gave it a thought and asked, “Do you think I can suppress the Second Elder’s bloodline?”

Zhu Lie pressed his lips together and replied, “Don’t even think about it.”

“I’m able to suppress an Eighth-Order bloodline, but I have never tried it on a Ninth-Order before. The Second Elder’s bloodline is in the Tenth-Order at most, so there’s not much of a difference.”

Zhu Lie shook his head and explained, “I know what’s on your mind, but I suggest you give up that idea now. The Second Elder’s cultivation is unbelievably powerful. Given your current strength, you can’t suppress her bloodline. In fact, on this island, if I’m well prepared, you won’t even be able to suppress my bloodline.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned.

Zhu Lie went on to say, “The Dragon Temple contains all our ancestors’ power, so if we’re able to obtain a Secret Technique from it, we’ll be able to considerably offset bloodline suppression. You’ve experienced it before.”

Yang Kai was startled for a moment before he recalled the first time he came across Zhu Lie. Back then, he wasn’t able to suppress Zhu Lie’s bloodline. It wasn’t until he achieved a breakthrough at the last moment, making an advancement in his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, that Yang Kai was able to peel off a special Dragon Scale from Zhu Lie and defeat him. There was a trace of the Secret Technique on that Dragon Scale.

It was then Yang Kai realized that it must be the blessing Zhu Lie obtained from the Dragon Temple. Now, he understood the reason why he couldn’t suppress Zhu Lie’s bloodline initially.

“If you want to suppress a Master like the Second Elder, you’ll have to integrate all the Dragon Source within your body first. Despite that, your chance will still be slim. Don’t forget that, other than being a Dragon, the Second Elder’s own strength is basically on par with that of a Great Emperor.”

“It’s impossible for me to fully integrate the Dragon Source!” Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly. It had been a long time since he started cultivating the Dragon Transformation Secret Art, and although he had made some progress with refining the Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength within his body, the amount was still insignificant. It would take him more than 100 years of cultivation to integrate all of it at best.

“Then, don’t even think about challenging the Second Elder.”

“Is the Great Elder really unable to help?” A glint flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes. The only person on Dragon Island who could challenge the Second Elder was the Great Elder. If he was willing to lend a hand, there was hope for them to save Zhu Qing.

“Don’t even think about it. The Great Elder is the leader of the Dragon Clan, so he won’t violate the rules.”

Yang Kai became incensed, “Are there really no solutions at all? Do we just watch Zhu Qing suffer and do nothing?”

As he spoke, he suddenly thought of something, so he uttered in an excited manner, “By the way, I have a Dragon Island Token. Why don’t I use it to get your Elder Sister freed?” Upon finishing his words, he fished out the Dragon Island Token.

Zhu Lie’s gaze lit up for a moment before it dimmed again. After a sigh, he replied, “The Elders will grant your wish if it’s a different matter, but they won’t agree to free Zhu Qing.”

Yang Kai snarled, “Won’t they keep their promise? It’s said that the Dragon Clan will grant the Dragon Island Token’s holder a wish. My wish is to leave with your Elder Sister.”

“That’s true, but the prerequisite is that you can’t violate the Dragon Clan’s rules and harm our interests. Rules will be broken if we allow you to leave with Zhu Qing.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before he cursed. He hadn’t felt so helpless for a long time. He felt displeased and frustrated, as though all the roads had been blocked, which caused him to be unable to show his true power.

In a hesitant manner, Zhu Lie said, “You might have a chance next month.”

With his gaze lighting up, Yang Kai looked at him.

Zhu Lie gazed at him as well and explained, “Zhu Qing will leave the Second Elder’s Spirit Island next month. That’ll be your only chance to save her.”

“How do you know what’s going to happen next month?” Yang Kai frowned and thought that there was a hidden message in Zhu Lie’s words.

With a conflicted gaze, Zhu Lie asked, “Do you know why the Dragon Clan suddenly wants to build a palace on Fu Chi’s Spirit Island?”

After pondering on it for a moment, Yang Kai replied, “Because of Fu Chi’s wedding?”

He had heard about it from Madam Hua in the morning, but Yang Kai didn’t really care about it. Although a Dragon Clan member’s wedding was an important event, it had nothing to do with him. Now, he just wanted to leave with Zhu Qing.

“To be precise, it’s Fu Chi and Zhu Qing’s wedding!”

In an instant, the air seemed to have frozen. The temperature around them dropped by a few degrees as the area was engulfed in coldness.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, and his Emperor Qi started surging beyond his control. In a slow manner, he uttered, “Say that again. I didn’t hear it clearly.”

After a sigh, Zhu Lie replied, “She was spared from being thrown in the Dragon Grave, but there was a catch; she has to get married to Fu Chi to sustain the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.”

*Hong…*

Instantly, a surge of fury came over Yang Kai. He clenched his fists as his bones started cracking. He hadn’t been so infuriated in a long time, as though he had been engulfed in the sea of rage, causing him to be extremely agitated.

At that instant, he wanted nothing more than to kill Fu Chi. He wanted to return to that Spirit Island and find him before tearing him apart. Otherwise, he would never be able to soothe the fury in his chest. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

[Bastard! How dare he snatch my woman from me!] Yang Kai had already disdained Fu Chi when he came across him in the morning, but now he was enraged and regarded him as his archnemesis.

He had never expected that Fu Chi, who had harmed Lu San Niang previously, dared to snatch his woman from him.

“Zhu Qing did try to resist, but it’s the Elders’ collective decision, so it’s useless for her to disagree with it. Otherwise, her Dragon Vein wouldn’t have been suppressed, and her cultivation wouldn’t have been sealed.”

Yang Kai’s mood turned worse when he heard that. Feeling sorry for Zhu Qing, he could picture how helpless she must have been at that time. With this thought in mind, he started blaming himself for failing to protect the woman he loved.

At the thought of Fu Chi, he became even more angered. [Who does he think he is? Even if I pissed on a picture of him, it would make it look better! Someone like that…]

With a ferocious expression, Yang Kai gnashed his teeth together, as though he was ready to kill.

Zhu Lie stared at him and uttered, “The wedding will be next month. At that time, she’ll go to Fu Chi’s island. That will be your only chance to save her. Other than that, you won’t have any chance to see her.”

Yang Kai said bitterly, “In other words, I have to stay here for one more month.”

“You can try breaking into the Second Elder’s residence now and depart for the afterlife immediately.”

Yang Kai glowered at him for a moment before taking a deep breath. The breath he puffed out from his nostrils was scorching hot, as though he was breathing fire. After he managed to compose himself, he nodded slightly, “Got it.”

“It’s not too late for you to leave now.” Zhu Lie gazed at him, “Since you were able to come in, I’m sure you’ll be able to leave as well. If you insist on staying, you’ll likely lose your life in a month’s time!”

Yang Kai was a hot-blooded man, but he could also calm himself down quickly, and his rational mind told him that Zhu Lie was right. Despite that, he still balled up his fists and said, “We’ll see who dies on that day.”

Silavin: Do note that the get-together part is kind of vague. It is more meant to be ‘get together exclusively’. The author didn’t really specify. So, in terms of context, the women might still fool around. But, they can only bear their own race’s children. Something like that.
