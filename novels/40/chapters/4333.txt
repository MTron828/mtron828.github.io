The rhythmic snores showed how sweetly the old man was sleeping.

[Just what is happening right now?] It was in the midst of the battle, and Void Land was in a total mess. Two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were still watching covetously from the side, but the old man with a turtle shell who appeared all of a sudden actually fell into a slumber in the middle of the fight…

Everyone’s face couldn’t help twitching.

The sword wielder snorted coldly, “This old man is truly impressive!” He was a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters after all, a prestigious figure in the 3,000 Worlds, but this turtle shelled old man actually disregarded him entirely and fell asleep right in front of him. Even if he was a Divine Spirit, he was way too scornful!

Followed by a shudder, the turtle shelled old man woke up again and sighed, “I’m too old, I can’t be as energetic as young people like you all, but you little ones are just too much. If you have any grudges, settle them by yourselves. Why do you have to jump around on my head and interfere with my sleep? How rude!”

As soon as he said this, the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters’ faces turned ugly, but Yang Kai was immediately relieved.

Before, he did not understand why Zhu Jiu Yin chose to fight in Void Land, which caused a huge mess and collapsed many Spirit Peaks. During her battle with the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, she even put some effort into shaking the ground. It turned out that Zhu Jiu Yin had already noticed the existence of the turtle-shelled old man a long time ago and was taking this opportunity to wake him, which was why she was determined to fight on Void Land!

The turtled shelled old man was a Divine Spirit, just like Zhu Jiu Yin. Although they were from different Clans, as a Divine Spirit herself, it was reasonable that Zhu Jiu Yin could detect his presence.

However, from Zhu Jiu Yin’s earlier actions, she did not seem to know where the turtle-shelled old man was hiding; therefore, she could only constantly shift the battlefield and disturb the entire Void Land.

‘If you have time to bother me, why don’t you use it to study your Void Land? This place is not simple!’ Yang Kai suddenly remembered what Zhu Jiu Yin had told him some time ago.

Yang Kai spent more than ten days examining both inside and outside of Void Land, but found nothing at that time. Now, it seemed that what Zhu Jiu Yin meant was that there was the Divine Spirit hidden in Void Land! Yang Kai had not figured it out because he was not strong enough. He could not even sense the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters lurking nearby, much less this Divine Spirit.

If Zhu Jiu Yin did not cause disturbances on purpose, the turtle-shelled old man would probably have continued to hide himself.

Yang Kai could not help feeling frightened. He was totally clueless about such a powerful existence hiding in Void Land. If the other party had ill intentions, Void Land would definitely have suffered heavy losses.

But judging from the turtle shelled old man’s attitude, he was neither vicious nor violent, even seeming to be quite easy to speak with.

It reminded Yang Kai of the Seven Wonders Land’s history…

The predecessor of Void Land was Seven Wonders Land. Seven Wonders Land certainly did not realize the existence of the turtled shelled old man either; otherwise, they would have asked him for help when they were being exterminated.

By the looks of it, the old man had been hiding here for many, many years. Given that he spoke like an old man and even addressed a Divine Spirit like Zhu Jiu Yin and the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters as ‘little ones’, Yang Kai really could not imagine how old he was.

“Old man, are you acting arrogant just because of your seniority? Do you really think this Monarch is afraid of you just because you’re a Divine Spirit?” The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master from Myriad Demons Heaven had a short temper and flared up. They were so close to their victory just now, but were blocked by the old man at the last moment. After enduring for a while, he could no longer hold it in. Leaping out, he stabbed at the old man with the long spear in his hand.

The move of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was indeed magnificent and powerful. Under the surging World Force, Yang Kai and the others felt the mountainlike pressure plummeting on them, causing the blood in their chests to constrict.

This was only the radiant effect, so one could imagine how much pressure the turtle-shelled old man, who was being targeted directly, was facing.

Although it was only a single attack, countless spear shadows seemed to cover the sky, each one containing the killing intent of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Appalled, the turtle-shelled old man yelped as he stepped back repeatedly, “Why can’t we just talk things out peacefully? Why do we have to fight? Young men should know how to respect the elderly!”

He stumbled, lost his balance and fell straight on his butt.

Following the momentum, the old man withdrew his arms and legs like a turtle, into his solid shell. His small figure easily retracted into the shell, completely concealing himself.

*Hong hong hong… *

One after another, spear shadows struck onto the turtle shell, causing the Earth to shake and even space itself to tremble.

When the spear shadows dispersed, everyone stared in amazement at the scene before them.

The turtle shell remained intact on the ground, with not even a mark left on it. However, who knew if the old man hiding in the turtle shell was shaken to death.

The Open Heaven Realm Master of Myriad Demons Heaven who landed the attack squinted. Although he launched the attack in a hurry and did not use his full strength, the might of a Seventh-Order Master was still no joke. Even another Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would not end well after receiving such a move, but it actually failed to even leave a scratch on this turtle shell.

[Just how tough is this turtle shell?]

He wanted to make another move again, but the sword wielder raised his hand and stopped him, glancing at Zhu Jiu Yin vigilantly at the same time. He did not expect such an outcome today. Not to mention the Hundred Sect Alliance led by Heavenly Sword Union being destroyed, they were being hindered even when he joined hands with the Myriad Demons Heaven Open Heaven Realm Master. Void Land was full of unpleasant surprises.

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider alone was already difficult to deal with, and now he had to face this turtle-shelled old man as well. He was quite hesitant. If they forced the old man to join hands with the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, they could only escape.

Thinking through numerous possibilities, the sword wielder proceeded, “Old Sir, please show yourself so we can talk.”

The turtle shell laid quietly on the ground, unresponsive. Just when the people wondered if the turtle-shelled old man was shaken to death, a head with a terrified, pale face suddenly peeped out, looking around sneakily, and asked nervously, “Are we not fighting anymore?”

This old fellow was so chicken-hearted that everyone was left speechless.

But the sword wielder did not dare to underestimate him and spoke politely, “Old Sir, please come out.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After observing the situation for a moment and making sure that no one would hit him again, the turtle-shelled old man stretched his arms and legs out of the turtle shell, and sighed as he wiped the dust off his body, “Alas, what an unlucky day. Sometimes unlucky things just happen even when you do nothing. Such misfortune.”

The sword wielder demanded again, “How should I address Old Sir?”

The turtle-shelled old man immediately shook his head like a pellet drum, “I can’t tell. I won’t tell. If you know my name, you will find trouble with me in the future. This Old Master won’t tell even if he dies.”

Yang Kai was speechless. Since this old man had already revealed himself today, could he run away from troubles if the others really wanted to cause any in the future?

The sword wielder did not intend to force him, so after a moment of silence, he continued, “We didn’t know that Old Sir resided here. If we offended Old Sir in any way, please forgive us.”

Hearing him, the turtle-shelled old man smiled, “It’s alright. One who makes mistakes unknowingly need not be held responsible. It’s fine as long as you don’t come around to disturb my sleep again.”

“We dare not!” The sword wielder nodded lightly, then he changed to the next topic abruptly, “But we still have a task to complete. Please stand aside, Old Sir.”

The turtle-shelled old man held his crutch and spoke, “As long as you stop fighting, everything can be negotiated.”

“Many thanks, Old Sir!” The sword wielder thanked politely, then he pointed at Yang Kai, “I want to take this boy with me!”

“In your dreams!” Yue He and the rest shouted angrily, immediately surrounding Yang Kai while circulating their strength to guard against unexpected events.

The sword wielder ignored them entirely and just stared at the turtle-shelled old man.

“Oh, hmm…” The old man hesitated for a while, then looked at Yang Kai again, and asked embarrassingly, “May this Old Master ask why you want to take him?”

The sword wielder did not answer him; instead, he asked, “Old Sir, are you protecting him? I wonder what kind of relationship Old Sir has with this boy?”

From the previous situation, the turtle-shelled old man did not seem to be related to Yang Kai in any way, but given that the old man was chicken-hearted even though he was clearly quite powerful, why did he have to stand up for Yang Kai?

The turtle-shelled old man coughed softly, “There’s actually no relationship between us…”

...

“Then…”

“But we share some heritage. It would be improper for this Old Master to just let him die.” The turtle-shelled old man was dying of embarrassment, his wrinkled face wrinkling even further.

“Share some heritage…” Even though the sword wielder’s face was shrouded in clouds and fog, and his expression could not be seen clearly, he was clearly puzzled by the old man’s words, for he had no idea what kind of connection this Divine Spirit who had been keeping a low profile had with Yang Kai.

However, taking away Yang Kai was not his real purpose. The reason why he requested this was just to cover his real intent. Therefore, he stopped pestering and continued, “Since Old Sir has declared so, we will respect your wishes.”

The turtle-shelled old man chuckled, “Many thanks.”

“Since I can’t take this boy with me, then I must take him away. As for this, I believe Old Master will not stop me, right?” The sword wielder pointed at Kong Feng, who was captured alive, as he spoke.

Kong Feng was extremely depressed. As a noble Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, it should have been impossible for him to be captured alive. Even a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master might not be able to do that. But still, he was seized, had his cultivation restrained, and suffered heavy injuries one after another. At this moment, he looked absolutely wasted, his spirit completely depleted.

Being a prisoner, if he wanted to live, he could only rely on the sword wielder and the Myriad Demons Heaven High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. As such, when he heard the request of the sword wielder, he immediately looked at him gratefully.

The turtle-shelled old man nodded his head like a chicken pecking rice, “No problem, no problem. Just take him.”

The sword wielder nodded lightly, then turned to look at Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, this matter ends here, let him go.”

Yang Kai looked at him with a defiant face, “Why should I have to listen to you? Who the Hell are you to tell me what to do?”

...

The sword wielder replied faintly, “Today, your Void Land has reaped all the rewards. It’s better for you to spare others where it is possible.”

The turtle-shelled old man advised wryly, “Little one, it’s better to avoid unnecessary trouble. These two are not to be trifled with, and the ones behind them are even scarier.”

Although he slept for many years, not caring about worldly affairs, this old man knew that only the Cave Heavens and Paradises could deploy High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters like this. He was timid to begin with, otherwise why would he hide in Void Land for so many years? How would he dare to challenge the Cave Heavens and Paradises?
