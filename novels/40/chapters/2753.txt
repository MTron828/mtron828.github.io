Qin Zhao Yang was staring blankly at the figure blocking the doorway. He didn’t think that Yang Kai would actually appear at this critical moment, and even managed to injure Luo Ping with a single finger! But then Qin Zhao Yang began to panic. Yang Kai may not know who Luo Ping was, but he did. He was simply not someone that they could afford to provoke. If that wasn’t the case, Luo Ping wouldn’t have been qualified to protect the Qin Family.

“Patriarch Qin, I trust you’ve been well since we last met!” Yang Kai smiled.

At this time, the young servant with the round cap appeared behind Yang Kai with a bitter look on his face as he said, “Patriarch, this man said he wanted to see you. This little one came to report, but didn’t dare to enter when he heard the commotion inside.”

Qin Zhao Yang waved his hand, “You may excuse yourself.”

The boy with the cap quickly ran off as if he’d been pardoned.

“Who is Your Excellency? And why have you acted so viciously towards this Young Lord!” Luo Ping gritted his teeth and shouted. Yang Kai’s finger had pierced through his palm just now, digging a bloody hole into it.

“You call this vicious?” Yang Kai grinned, “Compared to what you were about to do, this is nothing much.”

He then turned to Qin Zhao Yang and asked, “Who is this guy?”

After listening for so long, Yang Kai still hadn’t figured out who this young man was, but Qin Zhao Yang seemed quite afraid of him.

Qin Zhao Yang had a troubled look on his face, but before he could speak, Luo Ping shouted, “This Young Lord is a disciple of Star Soul Palace! You dare hurt me? You’re dead!”

“Star Soul Palace?” Yang Kai frowned.

Luo Ping sneered, “What’s wrong? Scared? If you’re scared then get down on your knees and kowtow to this Young Lord! Perhaps I could even spare your life!”

“Is he really a Star Soul Palace disciple?” Yang Kai looked solemnly at Qin Zhao Yang.

Qin Zhao Yang smiled bitterly, “It’s true.”

Yang Kai nodded. One could not impersonate a Star Soul Palace casually. One may not necessarily find themselves in any trouble if they impersonated the disciples of one of the three top Sects in the Southern Territory as long as they weren’t caught, but if anyone tried to impersonate a Star Soul Palace disciple, they would surely invite disaster upon themselves.

This young man in front of him had a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, which was not considered bad, and he also had a firm aura. He wasn’t too old, so he was probably from a big Sect, and since Qin Zhao Yang confirmed it, he must have verified his identity beforehand.

In other words, this Luo Ping really was a disciple of Star Soul Palace.

No wonder his tone of speech was so arrogant, not even showing any fear in front of an Emperor Realm Master like Yang Kai. It turned out it was because of his identity as a Star Soul Palace disciple.

“Kneel!” Holding his bleeding hand, Luo Ping shouted at Yang Kai once more through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai slowly raised his palm, Emperor Qi condensing on it as he said indifferently, “I’ll give you three breaths to scram from here. If you’re still here after three breaths, then I’ll help Star Soul Palace clean up its Sect by disposing of you!”

Luo Ping was stunned and he couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

He thought that this man would surely panic when he heard of his identity, but he didn’t expect to be completely disregarded and for the other party to even boast so shamelessly! Dispose of him on behalf of Star Soul Palace? Was there something wrong with this man’s head? He was a Star Soul Palace disciple!

“Don’t be rash, Yang Kai!” Qin Zhao Yang’s face went pale with shock. If Luo Ping really died here in their Qin Family, then the Qin Family would be done for.

“Yang Kai?” Upon hearing how Qin Zhao Yang called this man though, Luo Ping’s eyes bulged. Finally, he carefully observed Yang Kai before his face began to fill with terror.

He suddenly remembered the notice he had received from the Sect some time ago, and the name and description of a certain individual that matched greatly with this man in front of him.

[Is he the same Yang Kai?] If the one who stood before him really was Yang Kai, then his identity as a Star Soul Palace disciple naturally wouldn’t be able to deter him. When he saw the power condensing even more on Yang Kai’s palm, how could Luo Ping dare to remain any longer? In a flash, he scurried outside, fleeing the Qin Family as swift as the wind, without a single word of complaint.

Qin Zhao Yang was stunned and looked in the direction where Luo Ping disappeared, confused.

What was going on?

A Star Soul Palace disciple actually fled like a panicked stray dog! Was he seeing things? Even if Yang Kai revealed his Emperor Realm cultivation, it shouldn’t have scared him like this. Regardless of anything else, Luo Ping was still a Star Soul Palace disciple, right? Qin Zhao Yang was even beginning to doubt the authenticity of Luo Ping’s identity now.

In a small alley in Maplewood City, Luo Ping stopped with a pale face. Releasing his Divine Sense and not finding Yang Kai’s aura anywhere nearby, he finally let out a gasp of relief and collapsed to the ground without any care for his image, all his arrogance and pride thrown to the wayside.

He still felt palpitations and fear even now, and he couldn’t stop his hands from shaking.

His identity as a Star Soul Palace disciple was not false, and he was even an Inner Disciple who had some status in the Sect.

For a disciple like him, he could show no regard to most Emperor Realm cultivators he passed in the Southern Territory, but that man called Yang Kai was different. He was different from all the other Emperors out there.

Luo Ping received a notice from the Sect some time ago, informing all the disciples outside to keep an eye out for the whereabouts of a certain person, and that person was Yang Kai. Luo Ping previously had no idea why the Sect would need to keep track of this person, and it wasn’t until he bumped into a Senior Brother in Spirit Lake City and probed around a little that he discovered why.

This Yang Kai was actually related to the murder of Elder Tan Jun Hao and Deacon Wu Ming. What’s more, all signs indicated that the two of them were killed at Yang Kai’s hand.

This matter was confirmed by more than twenty Emperor Realm Masters from various Sects in the Southern Territory, so there was no doubt about its authenticity.

Elder Tan was one of the only four Third-Order Emperor Realm masters in Star Soul Palace. He had profound knowledge in cultivation and was a shrewd man, yet he was actually killed by Yang Kai. When he heard this news, Luo Ping couldn’t believe it at all.

Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master could be killed, so in comparison, Wu Ming’s death didn’t seem so shocking.

The deaths of an Elder and a Deacon of Star Soul Palace were a big deal, and the entire Sect took it very seriously. Countless people were searching for this man called Yang Kai.

“You dare hurt me? You’re dead! Dead!” Luo Ping gritted his teeth in anger and quickly took out a communication artifact before checking his surroundings sneakily. Only then did he send his Divine Sense into the artifact and send out a message.

After receiving a response, Luo Ping grinned sinisterly.

[Reinforcements will be arriving in Maplewood City in a few days. Let’s see how you die then!]

Back at the Qin Family, Yang Kai, who had learned the truth, was silent for a long time.

After hearing Qin Zhao Yang’s explanation that that Star Soul Palace disciple called Luo Ping was someone that the Qin Family had actively invited to protect them, and that Maplewood City had become somewhat turbulent recently. The rise of Maplewood City attracted many Masters, and the major families who had occupied favourable conditions and had an advantageous position in the past could now only eke out a living in the cracks due to their lack of strength. Two great families had already even been destroyed.

It was thanks to Luo Ping’s protection that the Qin Family survived. Though Luo Ping didn’t ask for cultivation resources, he had quite an interest in women, and he could even be described as insatiable. This made it impossible for Qin Zhao Yang to satisfy him, leading to today’s events.

“Yang Kai, you should hurry and leave. Luo Ping will surely contact Star Soul Palace, so it won’t be wise for you to remain here long,” Qin Zhao Yang warned him, worried.

Yang Kai simply waved his hand though and commented lightly, “No matter. Those people from Star Soul Palace may not even come, but if they do, it will allow me to settle a grudge I have with them.”

He had killed Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming, so Star Soul Palace definitely wouldn’t let the matter rest. No matter what, they would want an explanation from Yang Kai; otherwise, it would be a challenge to the status of Star Soul Palace.

Yang Kai never thought of hiding either. If it were in the past, then Yang Kai would only be able to look up to a Great Emperor Sect, but now, he had the capital to negotiate with Star Soul Palace.

And, since the Bright Moon Great Emperor had the ability to ascend to the peak of the Star Boundary, he was surely someone who could be reasoned with. The twenty or so pawns Yang Kai had set up in Flowing Shadow City would now also play their role.

“You…” Qin Zhao Yang was at a loss. The one Yang Kai provoked was a Star Soul Palace disciple, not some run-of-the-mill disciple from a somewhat important Sect, so how could Yang Kai still be so calm and relaxed?

Yang Kai smiled and swiftly changed the subject, “Forget about me, where will the Qin Family go now?”

As soon as these words came out, Qin Zhao Yang was stunned, unable to speak for a long time. Finally, he just heaved a long sigh. Not only did the Qin Family lose Luo Ping’s protection, they even offended him. Life was likely going to be difficult for them from now on, and Qin Zhao Yang feared there was no longer any place for them in Maplewood City.

“I don’t know, but we definitely have to leave Maplewood City,” Qin Zhao Yang seemed to have aged a lot in an instant.

“Where will you go if you leave Maplewood City? The entire Southern Territory is Star Soul Palace’s domain.”

Qin Zhao Yang could not answer. Indeed, even if they left Maplewood City, they would still have to face retaliation. That was unless they left the Southern Territory and escaped Star Soul Palace’s jurisdiction, but how could it be so easy to execute such a plan?

Yang Kai said, “Why don’t I arrange a place for you to stay?”

Qin Zhao Yang looked up, “Where?”

“The Northern Territory!” Yang Kai revealed.

Qin Zhao Yang’s mouth widened, but then he smiled bitterly, “The journey is too long, and the cultivations of my Qin Family’s disciples aren’t very high. We can’t travel that far.”

“It’s not as far as you think. As long as the Patriarch Qin agrees, I can send you to the Northern Territory within ten days!”

“Ten days!” Qin Zhao Yang was shocked. His first thought was that this was impossible, but after more consideration, there was still a hint of possibility. Of course, that would require the use of things available only in the legends.

“Can we really reach the Northern Territory in just ten days?” Qin Zhao Yang asked in a trembling voice. If that truly was possible, then the Qin Family could definitely escape this disaster. The Northern Territory and the Southern Territory were worlds apart, and Star Soul Palace’s reach didn’t extend that far.

“Absolutely!” Yang Kai nodded sincerely, “If Patriarch Qin trusts me, then I can arrange it immediately. We can set off in two days.”

There was a look of struggle in Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes for a moment. He would like to believe Yang Kai, but this matter was related to the future of his entire family, so he had to be cautious.

Yang Kai smiled, “I will definitely not disappoint Patriarch Qin.”

In fact, Yang Kai had not intended to bring the Qin Family to High Heaven Palace, he had just come over to take a look at how they were doing, but since the Qin Family was in a desperate situation now, it didn’t matter for him to bring them along as well.

Whether a shepherd had to herd one sheep or a flock of them, it was still herding in the end. It didn’t make much difference to Yang Kai.

And, in this way, he could also come out with a harvest of Qin Yu! With the cultivation aptitude that Qin Yu had now, it was very likely she would reach the Emperor Realm in the future, which would also be another source of power for High Heaven Palace. This could only bring good to a Sect and no harm.
