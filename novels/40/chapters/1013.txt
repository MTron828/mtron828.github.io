Chapter 1013, We’re Very Sorry

On the mountain top, the Purple Star and Sword Union cultivators all waited anxiously, none of them daring to speak, creating a silent yet tense atmosphere.

None of them knew how long it was, but all of a sudden they saw Yang Kai’s body tremble and his face turn white, as if he had just experienced something terrifying.

The Void Corridor which had been opened by the Space Array also began to ripple, flickering open and shut like the maw of a great beast. In the blink of an eye, the pitch-black Void Corridor collapsed and the distorted space around the mountain returned to normal.

The moment of Void Corridor collapsed, Yang Kai’s Soul Clone and Gui Zu’s Spiritual Energy wisp flew out.

Gui Zu took back this wisp into his body while Yang Kai also took back his Soul Clone, his expression sinking in the next breath, “Senior, my Soul Clone is on the verge of shattering, it can’t be used like this again.”

Gui Zu seemed to be going over the information his Spiritual Energy wisp had brought back and paid no attention to Yang Kai for a while, nodding sometime later, “Good, you did well. Go restore yourself.”

“Senior, if there is such an occasion again, will you first look for me?” Yang Kai asked coldly.

Gui Zu grinned, “Depends on my mood, and whether you behave yourself from now on.”

Yang Kai’s face turned black and flew off without saying a word, landing beside Shen Tu and sitting down cross-legged.

“Go make yourselves busy, but don’t leave too far. When I need your help again I expect you to arrive promptly!” Gui Zu said lightly.

Listen to him say this, everyone felt a temporary sense of relief and quickly dispersed, fleeing from the mountain top as quickly as they could.

Yang Kai and Shen Tu also rushed out, not wishing to remain in this damned place for a moment longer.

A moment later, only Gui Zu remained atop the mountain, staring at the Space Array he had spent so much effort to create, frowning deeply as he pondered how to alter it in order to make it work.

Although he had not succeeded this time, he had been psychologically prepared for such a result, so he did not show too much disappointment.

After all, when he came here, he had only just broken through to the Saint King Realm and had not been well versed in any particular discipline, much less the Space Principle. It had taken him a thousand years to develop this Space Array, and even that had much to do with luck.

It was a pity that the mysteries of the Space Principle were something he couldn’t accurately grasp. Even after reaching the Origin King Realm, the secrets of Space still eluded him.

Rather than raw effort, this kind of thing required both aptitude and opportunity!

After sitting in the middle of the giant Spirit Array for a while, he began rearranging the rows of Saint Crystals, altering it ever so slightly.

A dozen kilometres from the mountain peak, Yang Kai suddenly came to a halt.

“What’s wrong, we should keep running,” Shen Tu looked at him anxiously and urged.

“Where do you want to run to?” Yang Kai looked at him strangely.

“I don’t know, however far I can run, I intend to run!” Shen Tu shouted, “I don’t want to be eyed by him then tossed into that door, unable to even control my own life or death!”

Yang Kai shook his head, “He is the master here, no matter where you go, he can immediately find you!”

“True enough,” Shen Tu thought about it and nodded in agreement, “Brother, a moment ago, I didn’t act very upright, but there was really nothing I could do about it. There was no way I could help you.”

“It’s fine, it’s my own fault for doing something that drew his attention,” Yang Kai knew why Gui Zu had chosen him first, it was clearly because he had killed Wei Wu.

Gui Zu must have felt he had rebelled against his orders and determined Yang Kai wasn’t obedient enough.

This had nothing to do with Shen Tu, and even if Shen Tu had tried to help him, in the face of Gui Zu’s absolute strength, there was nothing he could have done.

“What happened to you inside that Void Corridor?” Shen Tu asked curiously.

“I don’t know, my Soul Clone doesn’t have its own consciousness; although I attached my own Divine Sense to it, I wasn’t able to observe much. I can only tell you this, with Gui Zu’s current understanding of the Space Principle... Whoever enters that door will die without a doubt! This time my Soul Clone was able to escape only because it did not have a physical form and was thus able to move essentially at the speed of thought.”

Shen Tu face went pale, “Why does he keep studying it then?”

“He has been trapped here for two thousand years, naturally he wants to leave, but for us, this place is nothing less than a cultivation holy land. Him being able to break through to the Origin King Realm is definitely related to this cultivation environment,” Yang Kai took a long breath and smiled bitterly, “You should instead be thankful he still intends to study that Space Array. If one day he determines it’s impossible to use it to escape from this place... that will be when the real disaster starts!”

“Brother, don’t scare me like that!” Shen Tu showed a genuinely frightened expression, just imagining such a scene in his mind caused him to shudder.

Once Gui Zu lost hope in that Space Array, and felt that there was no possible way to escape from here, with his temper and character, everyone here would definitely experience a fate worse than death!

“What do you intend to do now?” Yang Kai looked at him and asked.

“I don’t know, wait to die?” Shen Tu’s mouth twitched, “What about you?”

“Look for a place to enter secluded cultivation,” Yang Kai replied casually.

Shen Tu was stunned, somewhat unable to understand why Yang Kai still seemed so calm and relaxed, not worried at all.

Thinking about it for a moment, Shen Tu nodded, “Then I’ll find something to keep myself occupied. Better than just sitting around on edge all day!”

On this continent, he could only get along with Yang Kai, the people from Sword Union and Purple Star both wouldn’t pay any attention to them, so now that Yang Kai was going to enter secluded retreat, Shen Tu was about to lose the only person he could talk to, causing him to feel a bit distraught.

He didn’t know why, his strength was obviously much higher than Yang Kai’s, but he actually couldn’t help feeling like he was somehow inferior in all aspects to him.

Yang Kai seemed to be able to remain calm no matter what he encountered, silently observing any situation beyond his ability to handle until he found a way to break through and take control.

Shen Tu couldn’t help admiring this.

The two of them said a few more words before going their separate ways for a while.

What Shen Tu was going to do, Yang Kai didn’t know; as for him, he was going to head back to that cave he had been practising Alchemy in before.

No matter what situation it was, greater strength was the best guarantee of survival! Yang Kai understands this more clearly than anyone else.

Because of Lu Gui Chen’s seal, he hadn’t been able to improve his strength these past two months, so now that he had broken free from it, he didn’t want to waste this rare opportunity.

“Senior, I am going to the cave where you found me before to continue studying Alchemy, do you have any issue with that?” Just in case, Yang Kai sent a Divine Sense message to Gui Zu.

After a while, Gui Zu’s voice rang in his ear, “Go, I temporarily have no use for you!”

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai nodded before summoning his Star Shuttle and flying off.

He hadn’t flow far though before he heard a tender voice call out to him, “Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai came to a halt and looked towards the source of the sound, seeing He Zao and He Miao flying towards him from nearby.

After a moment, the two sisters arrived in front of him.

He Zao’s expression was a bit complicated as if she didn’t quite know what to say. He Miao on the other hand just bluntly asked, “Was Senior Brother Wei Wu really killed by you?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai didn’t answer directly.

“I don’t think it’s likely!” He Miao spat disdainfully, “Senior Brother Wei Wu had a Third Order Saint cultivation. The difference in strength is clear. You’re so weak, how could you have killed him?”

“I’m that weak?” Yang Kai asked stunned.

He Miao looked at him seriously, using her Divine Sense to sweep him before smirking, “You’re not strong in any case, I think I can easily beat you.”

“Yes...” Yang Kai gently nodded, not having any intention of arguing, asking after a short pause, “Did you have something you wanted to ask me?”

He Zao whispered softly, “Obviously we came here to say we’re sorry.”

She bit her red lips and apologized, “You helped us in the Chaotic Abyss, saving our lives, clearly we should be thanking you, but master said, she...”

“That has nothing to do with you,” Yang Kai smiled, not taking the matter to heart.

“In any case... we’re very sorry. Moreover, Master is very upset because of Senior Brother Wei Wu’s death, and she asked us to find an opportunity to kill you. Yang Kai, if we sisters end up fighting you future, please don’t blame us, this isn’t our intention.”

Yang Kai grinned, “I know, but if you really do that, you’d best be psychologically prepared to be killed by me, I won’t just stand there and not fight back.”

“Hmph, you’re really quite arrogant...” He Miao snorted, “If we sisters really try to kill you, could you put up any resistance?”

“Try it and find out!”

“He Miao, don’t be rude,” He Zao scolded gently.

“I know,” He Miao spat out her tongue. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Is there anything else?” Yang Kai tilted his head and asked.

“No, we just came to tell you this.”

“Then let us meet again later,” Yang Kai said and moved to mount his Star Shuttle when he suddenly came to halt and frowned, “Let me ask you something, if you two died in the Chaotic Abyss, what kind of advantage would that bring Wei Wu?”

“What do you mean?” He Zao stared at him suspiciously.

Yang Kai laughed, “Just asking.”

He Zao frowned and considered the matter seriously, “Master is a Sword Union cultivator, and she doesn’t have many disciples, only us sisters and Senior Brother Wei Wu show some promise. If we were to die, Master would definitely focus on cultivating him.”

“How did you get lost in the Chaotic Abyss?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Senior Brother Wei Wu sent us a message, telling us to wait outside the Chaotic Abyss. We never expected to run into that group from Purple Star there though. We sisters were outnumbered and were forced to... forced to...” He Zao spoke until here before pausing, her expression changing dramatically, seemingly unravelling something, her tender body shivering unconsciously as she turned a look of shock towards Yang Kai.

“May we meet again!” Yang Kai didn’t say anything more, his body quickly being wrapped in a blue light that shot off into the distance.

Leaving behind a pensive looking He Zao, her pretty face contorting into a frown while He Miao stared on blankly.

After a while, He Miao whispered softly, “He’s really a strange person, suddenly talking about such senseless things out of nowhere.”

“I think he’s actually more astute we think!” He Zao’s beautiful eyes flashed a brilliant light, “Moreover, you’re underestimating him too much. Him being able to kill Senior Brother Wei Wu means he’s definitely not as simple as he appeared! Perhaps... He doesn’t even place us in his eyes.”

“What? Isn’t Elder Sister just overestimating him?” He Miao exclaimed.

“Do you still remember, when we first met him in the Chaotic Abyss, he didn’t even try to evade or hide. He didn’t know who we were, or whether we had any malicious intentions towards him, yet he still waited in place to confront us. In other words, he felt that even if we bore him hostility, given our strength, we wouldn’t be able to harm him!” He Zao declared solemnly.
