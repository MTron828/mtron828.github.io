Chapter 1581, Head On

“Brother Xue Lian, be careful, he’s the human I mentioned to you before,” Mi Tian looked at Yang Kai coldly and muttered.

The Monster Race cultivator named Xue Lian frowned slightly as he took another look at Yang Kai for grinning widely, “So this is the Human that killed your two Thunder Flame Flying Lizards? He doesn’t look like much.”

From his contemptuous expression, it was clear he did not put Yang Kai in his eyes.

Mi Tian chuckled, “If Brother Xue Lian underestimates him simply because he is a human, that would be a big mistake, he’s... somewhat different from the other humans on Monster Emperor Star.”

“Hmph, I haven’t seen you in more than ten years, Mi Tian, but it seems you’ve lost all your spirit in that time, even cowering before a mere human now. If my carriage’s Monster Beasts were killed by this boy, he would have never lived to see the next sunrise! Mi Tian, it seems this is as far as you’ll rise, from now on, this Monster Emperor Star will be my, Xue Lian’s world!” Xue Lian did not seem to take Mi Tian seriously, even ridiculing him for his timidity.

Mi Tian did not get angry, however, and simply smiled, “I was only advising you, whether you listen or not... heh heh!”

These two Monster Race masters did not even try to lower their voices, so Yang Kai naturally heard every word they said.

Yang Kai could not help observing the cultivator called Xue Lian with some interest and curiosity.

This Xue Lian must really have a powerful background, otherwise, he would not dare speak to Mi Tian like this. Yang Kai knew Mi Tian was the Young Lord of Thousand Eyes Tribal Lord, a figure famous across all of Monster Emperor Star, but this Xue Lian actually stood on equal footing with him and even criticized and mocked him mercilessly, so what were Xue Lian’s origins?

Regardless, this Xue Lian’s cultivation was not weaker than Mi Tian’s, having also reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm!

“Do you two have business here?” Yang Kai’s face was full of smiles but the light in his eyes was slightly cold as he asked faintly.

“Of course we have business here,” Xue Lian grinned and stared at Yang Kai disdainfully, “But you’re not qualified to talk to this Young Lord. Get that human woman surnamed Xia to come out and see me.”

“You want to see Little Senior Sister?” Yang Kai chuckled and shook his head, “I’m afraid that won’t be possible, Little Senior Sister is currently in the middle of performing Alchemy and won’t see anyone.”

“She won’t?” Xue Lian said with a sharp expression before coldly snorting, “That’s not up to her to decide! Since this Young Lord is here, she must see me, she has no say in the matter.

Mi Tian, who was standing behind Xue Lian, smiled and added, “Brother Xue Lian came this time to find that young lady to help him with Alchemy. En, we’ve heard that her Alchemy skills are quite good. Brother Xue Lian has prepared the necessary herbs, as long as she agrees to refine them, this matter can be settled.”

“Help with Alchemy?” Yang Kai nodded, “Such a small matter isn’t worth disturbing Little Senior Sister over, I can agree on her behalf, just give the herbs to me then go back and wait.”

Mi Tian raised his brow while Xue Lian sneered, “Give you the herbs? What thing are you? This Young Lord heard that you’re just a boy toy that relies on women to survive. Go back and tell that woman to get out here and see me! Hmph, a trivial human slut dares put on airs in front of this Young Lord, she’d best be careful I don’t tear off her limbs as punishment!”

The smile on Yang Kai’s face receded immediately as his eyes narrowed, suddenly showing a cold and callous expression, “Did you just insult my Senior Sister?”

“Are you deaf? So what if I insulted her?”

“Then you’ll have to pay for it!”

Yang Kai declared coldly and then, before anyone even saw him move, his figure flickered and mysteriously appeared directly in front of Xue Lian, his arm already extending outwards as he sent a punch towards the latter’s face, his Saint Qi bursting out with incredible intensity.

The other party was obviously here to make trouble, so Yang Kai had no interest in continuing to talk with him.

Xue Lian was startled. He had not seen how Yang Kai moved just now, but feeling a sharp murderous intent approaching him, he roared and threw out a punch of his own.

His eyes were filled with anger, but also with disdain.

Yang Kai suddenly attacking him had truly been a surprise. No human had ever dared initiate an attack on him.

However, this human boy was clearly much too overconfident, actually trying to compete with him with pure physical strength! Even considering all of Monster Emperor Star, Xue Lian’s lineage was renowned for its physical strength with few Monster Race masters being his equal, much less a mere human.

Xue Lian responded with his full strength, thinking he would easily crush Yang Kai.

*Hong...*

The fists collided and space seemed to collapse as an invisible shockwave exploded outwards from the point of impact.

Yang Kai’s body shook slightly as he raised his brow in surprise. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xue Lian’s eyes bulged as a look of disbelief appeared on his face.

When their fists met, both were able to feel the full ferocity of the other’s blow and instantly realized their opponent was not one that could be casually dealt with.

The tremendous strength of the impact pushed both of them back a few steps before they could stabilize their stances.

“Fierce!” Mi Tian praised without hesitation. The moment Yang Kai made a move, he had lightly retreated, and after standing firm, he was able to see the exchange of blows between these two.

Mi Tian was quite surprised.

Although he had always felt that he was no worse than Xue Lian in terms of overall strength, if it was a contest of physical power, Mi Tian had no choice but to admit his inferiority; after all, Xue Lian’s bloodline was famous for its resilience and brute strength.

If he were to fight Xue Lian one on one, Mi Tian would do his best to avoid meeting him head on as much as possible and attack using his own strengths.

But this human named Yang Kai chose to clash directly with Xue Lian! On top of that, in their first exchange of blows, no one seemed to have a clear advantage...

Mi Tian’s expression became solemn as he immediately understood that Yang Kai being able to kill his two Thunder Flame Flying Lizards in Shimmering Moon City was not just a lucky eruption of strength but his real ability!

There was going to be a good show here! Mi Tian suddenly became excited, his eyes glancing over towards a certain position a few thousand metres away.

Over there, Yu Xiong was standing atop the palace’s roof with folded arms, looking down from on high with a triumphant expression. Noticing Mi Tian’s gaze, he raised his hand and waved, as if to say hello before turning back to continue watching the battle.

“Interesting, very interesting, human!” Xue Lian scanned Yang Kai up and down, re-examining him for a moment before shouting, “Again!”

As his words fell, a bloody glow suddenly appeared around his body, one that was filled with a malevolent and violent aura, causing Xue Lian’s aura to soar.

Stamping his foot, Xue Lian rushed out towards Yang Kai.

With every step he took, the ground shook and deep footprints were left behind. With these footprints as an origin, the ground split and cracked into a dense web-like pattern.

Yang Kai was instantly enveloped by a potent murderous intent.

This murderous intent was almost tangible and it felt like a cold blade was trying to slice into his skin. It was a disturbing feeling most would try to avoid.

But Yang Kai had no intention of backing down.

With a low, guttural roar, like that of a raging beast, Yang Kai’s muscles swelled up and his bones creaked as his aura also rapidly rose, shattering the murderous intent which was pressuring him.

Xue Lian rushed in front of Yang Kai and sent out a hail of fists, each one containing Heaven destroying and earth shattering power.

Yang Kai did not even try to dodge, allowing his opponent’s attack to land on him while he sent out his own iron fists towards Xue Lian’s vitals.

*Peng peng peng...*

Constant explosive impact sounds erupted together with loud shouts and roars, causing the skin of those who heard them to crawl.

Yang Kai showed no sign of being defeated and instead was meeting Xue Lian blow for blow.

Mi Tian was stunned while Yu Xiong’s jaw dropped. Even the green-clothed maid had lost the ability to think as her beautiful eyes shivered while watching this raw display.

She had always thought that Yang Kai was nothing more than a leech who clung to women for support, a shameless waste. She had secretly been pitying Xia Ning Chang, thinking this innocent Grandmaster must have problems with her vision. There were so many outstanding suitors in this world, but she had somehow chosen such a man.

But now, she finally understood that this man who she regarded as worthless had his own strong points.

For his woman, daring to fight head-on with Young Lord Xue Lian was already an astonishing feat...

At this moment, he seemed far more handsome than before!

The physical strength Xue Lian was so proud of failed to play any role in suppressing Yang Kai as it was clear the other party’s accomplishments in this field were comparable to his own.

With cold and ferocious glints in their eyes, like an enraged bloodthirsty Monster Beasts, Yang Kai and Xue Lian punched and kicked one another with reckless abandon, each blow delivering a shocking amount of power.

Between Yang Kai and Xue Lian, a wild strength surged about. This was a manifestation of the pure physical power these two were releasing.

Even masters like Mi Tian and Yu Xiong couldn’t tell the specific situation on the battlefield as they could only see the two figures flicker back and forth, hear the thunderous explosions, and feel the terrifying shockwaves coming from it.

A truly bloody battle!

Xue Lian roared, his voice filled with rage, while Yang Kai was in a similar state. Although it was the first time these two had met one another, they already seemed to see each other as life or death enemies, red light flashing from their eyes that was terrifying to behold.

The two figures were entangled together, bombarding each other violently. Just like reckless men who had never cultivated before, not using anything other than the raw power in their bodies, each trying to suppress the other.

Bursts of light constantly appeared, like meteors flying by, painting a gorgeous and intoxicating scene.

This kind of rough and simple fighting method was always looked down on by cultivators, but at this moment, this kind of brutal contest was mesmerizing to see.

Any kind of strength, when cultivated to the extreme, could not be despised.

Xue Lian became more and more startled as they fought.

He had never thought that a mere human could fight him head on with only physical power. Each time his fists landed on Yang Kai, it felt as if he was punching the hardest of rocks and the sound that rang out was like that of hammering metal.

The toughness of Yang Kai’s physical body made Xue Lian feel like it was forged from the strongest steel rather than flesh and blood.

But how was that possible? Even among the Monster Race, which was known for its physical strength, none could compare with his lineage in this domain, so how did this human accomplish this?

Was he really human?
