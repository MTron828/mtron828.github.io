In Ou Yang Lie’s opinion, this sudden unforeseen change on the auxiliary front was most likely related to Xiang Shan. It wasn’t as if this had never happened before. Xiang Shan had a few times snuck into a Great Territory Battlefield and then suddenly attacked, beheading a Territory Lord and turning the tide in the Human Race’s favour.

There were several peak Eighth-Order Masters like Xiang Shan attached to the Supreme Headquarters. They were not deployed to any particular Great Territory Battlefield, but they could suddenly appear anywhere, knocking the Black Ink Clan’s advances on their head.

It was partly thanks to these peak Eighth-Order Masters that the Humans had been able to maintain the frontlines in various Great Territories at critical moments over the years.

Without their assistance, the Humans would have at least lost two or three Great Territory Battlefields.

But soon, Ou Yang Lie shook his head, “That’s not right, even Big Head Xiang wouldn’t be able to do something like this.”

The deaths of four Territory Lords had not gone unnoticed by any of the Masters here. There were only a total of five Territory Lords on that auxiliary front, and by the looks of it, they were about to catch all of them in one net.

Ou Yang Lie had worked with Xiang Shan for many years and was well aware of what the latter was and wasn’t capable of. He didn’t believe that Xiang Shan had the strength to kill four Territory Lords in a row. Even if he was helped by other Eighth-Order Masters, that was simply an impossible feat.

As soon as he finished speaking, Ou Yang Lie sensed the death of the fifth Territory Lord.

Ou Yang Lie was stunned for a moment before grinning ear to ear, [Good, now that all the Territory Lord there have been wiped out, the Profound Nether Army detachment should be able to completely occupy that auxiliary front!]

“Has the Army Commander returned?” Fei Yong Ze suddenly glanced at Wei Jun Yang and asked.

Xiang Shan might not be able to accomplish this, but that didn’t mean that no one in this world could. In fact, among all the Eighth-Order Masters alive today, there was only one person who could make this impossible feat possible!

Profound Nether Army Commander, Yang Kai!

The last time he appeared in Profound Nether Territory, Yang Kai managed to kill three Territory Lords all by himself, so it would not be impossible for him to kill five with the help of four other Eighth-Order Masters.

The other Eighth-Order Masters were astounded after hearing this.

[The Army Commander is back? Wasn’t the Army Commander trapped in Acacia Territory? How did he return?]

The Territory Gates in Acacia Territory had been blockaded by millions of Black Ink Clan soldiers and at least a dozen Territory Lords had also been deployed there. No matter how strong Yang Kai was, he probably would not be able to break out of such an encirclement.

Immediately, someone anxiously asked, “Senior Brother Wei, has the Army Commander really returned?”

Wei Jun Yang slightly nodded in agreement, “Yes, the Army Commander is back. He also took charge of that auxiliary front.”

“No wonder!” Realization suddenly dawned on everyone. They had at first thought that it was Xiang Shan’s handiwork, but apparently, it was Yang Kai’s doing.

“How did he return? Did he kill his way out in Acacia Territory?” Ou Yang Lie looked confused. He had been quite worried when he heard that Yang Kai had been trapped in Acacia Territory; after all, the Black Ink Clan had deployed a massive force to keep him trapped. Yang Kai was responsible for rescuing the Human refugees trapped in Acacia Territory, so he was surely encumbered by a huge burden. Ou Yang Lie was afraid that Yang Kai wouldn’t be capable of taking the ruthless path and instead decided to live and die together with the trapped cultivators. That would be incredibly foolish. However, who would have thought that Yang Kai had already returned?

It was too strange.

Moreover, the war broke out in Profound Nether Territory because the news of Yang Kai being trapped in Acacia Territory had spread, allowing the Black Ink Clan to act fearlessly.

Did the Black Ink Clan not know that Yang Kai had escaped?

Ou Yang Lie was confused, and it wasn’t not just him; all the other Eighth-Order Masters had similar doubts.

Wei Jun Yang replied, shaking his head, “I don’t know how the Army Commander managed to escape, you can try asking him yourselves if you’re curious.”

Saying so, he stared into the depths of the void. The deadlock at the auxiliary front had been broken with the fall of the five Territory Lords stationed there. The Human Army should be able to eradicate the Black Ink Clan Army before long.

This was a huge win for Profound Nether Territory, enough to set everyone’s heart aflame.

The Human Race was currently lacking such victories. After continuously fighting for decades, everyone, from the higher-ups to the lowest-level soldiers, was mentally and physically exhausted, and with so little good news coming from the various battlefields, everyone had started to lose hope.

But now, perhaps there would be a new light!

At the same time, the Territory Lords were also looking in the direction of the auxiliary front. When they sensed the passing of the fifth Territory Lord, resentment took over the Territory Lords’ faces.

The Black Ink Clan had held the superior position on the Profound Nether Territory Battlefield for years and had not suffered any significant losses during that entire time, but ever since Yang Kai came, they had suffered two consecutive defeats.

The first time, he had killed three Territory Lords, and this time, five had perished. Furthermore, the Black Ink Clan still had no clear idea what happened at the auxiliary front.

“Sir Territory Lord!” A Feudal Lord hurriedly rushed over and saluted him, panic clearly visible on his face. It was the very same Feudal Lord who was sent by Six Arms to inquire about the auxiliary front’s situation. The Black Ink Clan could quickly gather information throughout the entire Profound Nether Territory with the help of their Black Ink Nest network.

The Feudal Lord hurried over to Six Arms, who asked him in a deep voice, “What happened at the auxiliary front? Is Xiang Shan here?”

A look of fear covered the Feudal Lord’s face as he shook his head and reported, “It’s not Xiang Shan, it’s that Human named Yang Kai! Some Feudal Lords witnessed him suddenly appear and kill the Territory Lords one by one!”

“What!?” The Territory Lords were greatly taken aback.

Six Arms also had a serious look on his face, “Yang Kai!? Are you certain?”

The Feudal Lord replied, “That is what the reports said.”

“Impossible!” One of the Territory Lords firmly shook his head, “Mo Na Ye in Acacia Territory sent word that Yang Kai was still trapped and there hasn’t been any movement on that side, so how could he appear here?”

The other Territory Lords also felt that it was impossible. Even if Yang Kai was somehow able to kill his way out of Acacia Territory, he would not have been able to return to Profound Nether Territory in such a short time. Everyone felt that the information from the auxiliary front was wrong.

“Check it again! Also, send a message to Mo Na Ye in Acacia Territory to ask about the situation over there,” even though Six Arms himself didn’t believe it, this was a critical matter, so he had no choice but to be prudent.

The Feudal Lord received the order and hurriedly flew towards the Black Ink Clan’s base camp. There was a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest at the camp that could communicate with all the other Black Ink Nests in Profound Nether Territory.

“Sir, how about I go take a look personally?” One of the Territory Lords asked.

Six Arms pondered for a moment before refusing, shaking his head, “There’s no need, that front… has already fallen into enemy hands. It’s pointless to go there now. On the contrary, you might fall victim to the Human Race’s ambush. Go back and rest.”

He looked around and noticed that two Territory Lords’ auras were in disorder. Obviously, they were seriously injured. He could not help but lightly sigh in his heart. These two probably wouldn’t be able to participate in the war for quite some time as they would need to return to the No-Return Pass to heal their wounds.

He didn’t know if the No-Return Pass would be able to transfer more Territory Lords here as recently, the Territory Lords in Profound Nether Territory had suffered quite a few casualties. If there were any more losses among the top ranks, the Black Ink Clan might not be able to maintain pressure on the Human Race.

At the same time, a sense of unease gripped Six Arm’s heart, [Has Yang Kai really returned and made an appearance at the auxiliary front? But that shouldn’t be possible…]

Meanwhile, Yang Kai, leading four Eighth-Order Masters and tens of thousands of soldiers, was chasing after the Black Ink Clan. Chen Yuan and the others were on a rampage.

It had been a few decades, no, several centuries since they had been able to kill Black Ink Clansmen so easily and freely after the great crusade.

For the past few hundred years, every time they fought, their opponents would be the powerful Innate Territory Lords.

But now, with all five Territory Lords in the vicinity dead, there were no more Black Ink Clansmen who could match them. Once they started the bloodbath, none among the Black Ink Clan here could stop them. Even the Feudal Lords were being taken down in one attack.

A million-strong Black Ink Clan Army lost countless soldiers under this pursuit and the Human Race Army soon killed their way to the enemy’s camp, a Universe World where dozens of Low-Rank Black Ink Nests had been planted.

In just the time it took to burn a stick of incense, these dozens of Black Ink Nests were completely destroyed and ransacked. Although the quality of resources looted from these Black Ink Nests was not that great, they won out in quantity.

Half a day later, the battle came to an end. The Black Ink Clan were wiped from this Universe World and the Human Race Army that had chased them all the way here let out a thunderous cheer.

After several decades, the Black Ink Clan at this auxiliary front had finally been purged. This also meant the Human Race would no longer need to deploy significant forces here in the future and could instead send more troops to the main battlefield.

Now that the battle was over, everyone started cleaning up the battlefield and collecting the corpses of the fallen soldiers. Everything proceeded in an orderly fashion.

Yang Kai did not immediately leave and instead lay in ambush on the Universe World with Chen Yuan and the other Eighth-Order Masters. He was not sure if the Black Ink Clan would send someone to check up on the situation here, so he was just taking a chance.

If a Territory Lord came to investigate this place, it would be an unexpected bonus.

Unfortunately, there was still no movement even after waiting for several days. Yang Kai did not want to waste his time waiting here any longer so he immediately ordered the troops to return to camp.

Leaving the aftermath to Chen Yuan and the others, Yang Kai flew alone to the frontline camp.

The Eighth-Order Masters were waiting for him, and when they saw him, they all cupped their fists in greeting. Yang Kai returned the gesture to everyone one by one. When he saw that most of them were injured, especially Ou Yang Lie and several other Eighth-Order Masters, who were seriously wounded, he couldn’t help but ask, “Why aren’t you all healing?”

Ou Yang Lie explained, grinning, “Old Wei said you’re back, but we could not believe him. We wanted to see it for ourselves.”

It wasn’t that they didn’t trust Wei Jun Yang, but this matter was simply too bizarre.

The Black Ink Clan started a war in Profound Nether Territory because they wanted to take advantage of Yang Kai being trapped in Acacia Territory and inflict heavy casualties on the Profound Nether Army. Unexpectedly, the information was wrong, and the Profound Nether Army took advantage of the situation to deal a heavy blow to the Black Ink Clan.

Yang Kai stated with a smile, “You’ve all fought hard, please go and heal your injuries.”

Everyone quickly dispersed.

Yang Kai also wanted to leave, but was stopped by Wei Jun Yang, “Sir, hold on a moment.”

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai curiously asked.

Wei Jun Yang stated, “Although we have won, our Profound Nether Army has also suffered some casualties. Sir, as the Commander of the Profound Nether Army, it is only right for you to coordinate the entire army and have a grasp of the Profound Nether Army’s information so that you can deal with the next battle.”

Yang Kai immediately felt a headache coming on, “There’s no need for that, you and Senior Brother Kong can take care of it.”

Wei Jun Yang shook his head in response, “Brother Kong and I are just assisting Sir; after all, the Profound Nether Army is still under Sir’s command.”

Yang Kai sincerely stated, “I trust my two Senior Brothers.”

“This isn’t about trust…”

Before Wei Jun Yang could say anything else, Yang Kai raised his hand and prevented him, “Senior Brother Wei, my injuries are serious and I urgently need to recuperate. I’ll have to trouble you and Senior Brother Kong to manage the Army.”

Wei Jun Yang sized up Yang Kai from head to toe as a look of ridicule appeared on his face.

Yang Kai earnestly added, “It’s an internal injury. My Soul is currently unstable, I feel like I’m about to pass out.”
