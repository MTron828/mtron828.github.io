No one had any idea what conflicts or grievances Long Tian Shang had with the sects he wiped out. The only thing that got around was that it was related to a woman.

Since then, Ling Tian Shang had gone into hiding and no one had seen him in the last thousand years, but everyone knew that he was guarding Water Moon Star and was in a retreat somewhere on it.

No one had ever thought that he would show up today.

No one dared to be inattentive to a Third-Order Origin King expert. Everyone cupped their fists and bowed to him. Even someone as arrogant as Zuo De was not exempted from the conventions.

Long Tian Shang chuckled and cupped his fists back to Zuo De before speaking in a calm manner, “Grandmaster still hasn’t changed even after all these years. This Tian Shang is very glad.”

“Elder Long is too kind.” Zuo De nodded.

“Martial Uncle Long, what made you come out today?” Ai Ou asked in surprise. Others might not have an idea about Long Tian Shang’s temper but he had a pretty good idea. In the entire Star Field, he was the only one who had the most contacts with Long Tian Shang.

Generally, even he would have a hard time meeting Long Tian Shang. More often than not he would have the door slammed on his face even when he went to greet him, leaving him no choice but to leave dejected. How could he have known that Long Tian Shang would show up today? Long Tian Shang’s appearance caught even him by surprise.

“I came to join in the fun.” Long Tian Shang chuckled. His temperament was quite extraordinary, giving everyone the feeling of showering in a spring breeze. Anyone who saw him would involuntarily develop a sense of intimacy. While speaking, he turned his head and looked at Yang Kai. “You must be Yang Kai. I can call you by your name, that’s not a problem, is it?”

“Not at all.” Yang Kai smiled and nodded his acknowledgement.

“Mhmm, you are very good. My Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce will be your ally from now on. You can come whenever you want, we are all family from now on,” Long Tian Shang said with a smile.

“Thank you very much, Senior. This junior will definitely treat this as half my home.” Yang Kai immediately made the most of it.

How could the nearby Xue Yue not know what Yang Kai meant? Her pretty eyes immediately flickered with shyness and happiness.

On the other hand, Zuo De’s face couldn’t help but turn ugly when he saw Long Tian Shan say so. Long Tian Shang might not have said much, but judging by these words alone, it was quite evident that he was pretty dissatisfied with Zuo De’s conduct. Otherwise, why would he be so close to Yang Kai?

[But... so what!? In theory, a Third-Order Origin King and I have the same status.] Thus, Zuo De didn’t care too much about it.

“That’s better.” Long Tian Shang nodded his acknowledgement. He seemed pretty satisfied with Yang Kai’s performance. He then chuckled and immediately switched the topic, “That being said, you have made a bet with Grandmaster Zuo De today. Since this King has come to join in the excitement, if you don’t admit it after you lose, this King won’t sit by. This King will truly kill you if you try to escape.”

He said it with a smile. There wasn’t the slightest bit of murderous intent in his tone, yet despite that, the listeners couldn’t help but break into a cold sweat.

With a Third-Order Origin King master presiding over this, who would dare to repudiate the bet? It was tantamount to courting death.

“Senior, don’t worry. This junior is an honest boy, I will never go back on my word.”

“I hope so,” Long Tian Shang then turned to Zuo De again. “Grandmaster, what about you? Do you still worry even after this Long is presiding over this?”

“It’s more than enough.” Zuo De nodded.

“Since that’s the case, you guys can start. It’s been a long time since I saw such an interesting thing. This Long also wants to watch a good show.” Long Tian Shang smiled before he vanished like a puff of smoke.

He disappeared just like that.

But everyone knew that he didn’t go far. Because his words had put too much pressure on others, he had taken the initiative to leave.

“Brother Yang, do you really want to do this?” Ai Ou gazed at Yang Kai with a serious look on his face. In his heart, he didn’t want Yang Kai to compete with Zuo De in Alchemy.

He was grateful for Yang Kai’s proposal but was also feeling helpless.

In his opinion, it was no different than a three-year-old child comparing strength against an adult, the former had no chance of winning.

On the other hand, Brother Yang sounded pretty jarring to Yang Kai.

But he couldn’t bluntly point it out, so he was left with no choice but to pretend to be indifferent. So he nodded and said, “Since Senior Long is already here, does this junior still have any chance to regret?”

“Hehe, no, you don’t.” Long Tiang Shang’s loud laughter immediately echoed from the void. His laughter seemed to be filled with schadenfreude, making Xue Yue grind her teeth in anger.

“Sigh!” Ai Ou heaved a heavy sigh. “Since that’s the case, you guys should begin. Ai Ou, Martial Uncle Long, and the Grandmasters, we all will be the witnesses!”

He knew that since things had reached this point, he was completely powerless to turn them back.

However, he also secretly made up his mind that if Yang Kai really lost, he would help Yang Kai escape even if it cost him his reputation.

In any case, Yang Kai had jumped into this muddy water because of Gu Bi Hu.

However, he still couldn’t figure out why Yang Kai did this.

“Haha, you are so dead now,” Zhan Yuan, who was standing by Zuo De’s side, started laughing like a villain. “Honored Teacher, you don’t need to hold back. You should let him know that you, Sir are the best Alchemist in the world.”

“Hmph, you didn’t have to say it.” Zuo De let out a cold snort. He squinted his eyes half and said, gazing at Yang Kai, “How do you want to compete with this old man? Don’t think that this old man is bullying you, the content of the competition will be up to you. No matter what kind of pill you decide, this old man will take it.”

He looked at Yang Kai in disdain, assuming the appearance that the victory was already within his grasp.

[How ridiculous! There is actually such an idiot who wants to compete with me in Alchemy!? I will let you know how to write the word ‘serve’ later.]

“This Yang had declared the content of the competition already, we will refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill!” Yang Kai smiled.

“Impossible!” Before Zuo De could speak anything, Ai Ou suddenly interrupted with a shout, looking at Yang Kai with a solemn look. “Brother Yang, choose another pill. Soul Source Restoration Pill is really...”

[It’s really a very high-level pill. It’s a Mid-Rank Origin King Grade Pill, and you need to be an Origin King Grade Alchemist to refine it. A High-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist is completely ill-equipped to refine it. He would only be wasting the herbs.]

[Yang Kai’s Martial Dao cultivation is very high despite his young age. He must have devoted all his time to the Martial Dao, so how could he have reached high-level in Alchemy? Even if he is an Alchemy prodigy, it’s still impossible to be an Origin King Grade Alchemist!]

[If he chose the Soul Source Restoration Pill for the competition, he has already lost before competing.]

Ai Ou was grateful to Yang Kai for considering Gu Bi Hu but he couldn’t let him jump into the fiery pit, no matter what. If he really let Yang Kai do so, then he would become someone else. Therefore, he rejected it and said, eagerly looking at Yang Kai, “How about you choose the Yuan Restoring Pill. Everyone has used this pill a lot and they can tell the difference between good and bad.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yuan Restoring Pill was a pill used by low-level cultivators to restore their Saint Qi. It was only a Low-Rank Saint Grade pill.

Ai Ou believed that Yang Kai should be able to refine it. And as long as he could refine it, he still had a chance. And if by some fluke of luck he refined it with Pill Veins, he just might win.

Zong Ao also nodded in agreement. He too felt that Yuan Restoring Pill was more appropriate. He knew that Yang Kai had some Alchemy skill and that Yang Kai had even refined a pill with Pill Clouds. It would certainly not be difficult for him to refine Yuan Restoring Pill with Pill Veins.

Since Zuo De let Yang Kai decide the content of the competition, then such an excellent chance could not be wasted in vain.

Zhan Yuan immediately stepped up and said, “Since someone wants to choose the Soul Source Restoration Pill, he must be pretty confident in refining it. This Zhan isn’t talented and hopes to have the chance to observe and emulate Your Excellency’s Alchemy Skill. Tch tch, it’s really rare to see someone refine an Origin King Grade pill. What does everyone think?”

Just as he said this, every Alchemist present here looked excited.

They too wanted to observe and emulate the refining of an Origin King Grade pill.

Between Yuan Restoring Pill and Soul Source Restoration Pill, they were more inclined toward the latter. So after hearing Zhan Yuan, they all agreed immediately.

Ai Ou flew into a rage. His majestic eyes focused on Zhan Yuan as the latter couldn’t help but shrink his neck. Perplexed, Zhan Yuan forced a smile and said, “I’m sorry, President Ai Ou but as an Alchemist, this Zhan only considered it as my own perspective. It was indeed my oversight. But most of us here want this. If Sir President likes, you can ask them.”

“No need, I choose the Soul Source Restoration Pill!” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Have you thought it through?” Zuo Do asked in a cold voice.

“Grandmaster doesn’t look confident?” Yang Kai smiled.

“This old man is afraid that you won’t be able to smile in the future!” Zuo De coldly snorted and said, “Don’t think for a moment that I don’t know what you are doing. Forget it, this old man will refine a Soul Source Restoration Pill as per your wish.”

Even to this point, he still believed that Yang Kai was using his freedom in exchange for the chance to cure Gu Bi Hu. He thought that everything Yang Kai did was only for the Soul Source Restoration Pill.

It never ever crossed his mind that Yang Kai could refine the Origin King Grade pills.

“President Ai Ou, please take out the materials,” Zuo De said to Ai Ou.

Ai Ou furrowed his brow and said, “I only have one set for materials! I can provide the other ingredients but I only have one Seven Colored Elk’s Monster Core. I’m afraid you two can’t compete to refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill.”

“This old man doesn’t care.” Zuo De shook his head. “From the start, these ingredients were prepared for this old man. As for where he will get his ingredients, that’s his business. If he can’t even gather the materials, then it will be considered as his defeat!”

“Grandmaster, if that’s the case, wouldn’t you be winning without competing?” Ai Ou looked extremely dissatisfied.

“He’s going to get his lesson!” Zuo De remained unmoved. He even sneered and added, “Youngsters are always arrogant. They don’t know how high the heavens are and how deep the earth goes. Only after the hammer of experience hammered this into them do they become mature and stable. Let it be a lesson for him. Elder Long, what do you think?”

Zuo De looked towards the void and asked.

After a long silence, Long Tiang’s nonchalant voice echoed from the void, “Grandmaster is right. Ai Ou, give the ingredients you have prepared to Grandmaster.”

“Martial Uncle!” Ai Ou was quite shocked when he heard this. If so, then Yang Kai would have no hope of winning at all. The ingredients for the Soul Source Restoration Pill were incomplete. How was he going to complete then? Ai Ou knew how difficult it was to find that Seven Colored Elk’s Monster Core. Even after mobilizing the entire Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, he could only find one with most of its energy depleted. There was absolutely no second one in the world.
