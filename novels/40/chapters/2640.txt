“Word of your ‘fierce’ fiancée has spread far and wide the past few days. Now, all of Ice Moon City knows about it, so it wasn’t hard for me to find out that you were using the fake name, Xiao Bai Yi. Don’t worry, I perfectly aligned my background to yours as well, and the Seeking Passion Sect is not suspicious in the slightest,” Ji Yao quickly replied through Divine Sense while yelling angrily out loud at the same time, “Xiao Bai Yi! Do you even have a heart!? If I hadn’t taken care of you all these years, you would have been fed to the wild animals in the wilderness! And now, you want to abandon me after taking advantage of me!?”

“Taking advantage!?” All of a sudden, the ears of the five hundred cultivators perked up in amazement.

They had no choice but to respect the courage of Yang Kai for being willing to ‘take advantage’ of such a hideous woman. None of them would dare to do so, as this ‘meal’… was too hard to be savoured.

Their quarrel did not just entertain the five hundred cultivators nearby, but also alarmed those cultivators who were guarding the other array flags in the vicinity. Soon, many had come over to watch the show.

After a little inquiry, all of them learned that Xiao Bai Yi’s wicked fiancée had come to find him.

Everyone had already heard of the news of Xiao Bai Yi’s shrewish wife the past few days, so they were enjoying the show in excitement, waiting to see how Yang Kai would handle his predicament.

“Take advantage…” Yang Kai’s cold sweat dripped even further, revealing a face full of guilt and uneasiness.

Everyone glanced at his expression, and they were even more impressed that such a thing truly happened.

“Do you think I don’t know why you came here to accept the Seeking Passion Sect’s Recruitment Order? Isn’t it all because you want to bring back some beautiful fair-skinned Ice Heart Valley disciples? I’ll tell you now, that will happen only in your dreams! If you bring one, I’ll kill one, if you bring two, I’ll kill two! Bring three, and I’ll cut off your third leg!”

The five hundred cultivators burst into laughter. Although Ji Yao’s appearance was disappointing, her words were brutal. Sure enough, she was really fearless, and no other normal woman would dare to speak like her.

Huo Han was especially happy as he doubled over in laughter at their conversation, wishing Yang Kai even more misfortunes as he did.

“Hey, you’re taking this act a bit too far…” Yang Kai hurriedly sent another Divine Sense message. He understood Ji Yao far better than anyone else present and knew that it was quite hard for a cold beauty like her to utter such words. With a sigh in his heart, he continued secretly communicating with her, “Fine. Since things have gotten to this point, cooperate with me. Find a chance to start a real fight!”

Ji Yao’s brow rose slightly as she silently replied, “Good!”

“Disgraceful!” Yang Kai cried out bitterly, pointing his finger at Ji Yao with a look of agony on his face as he declared, “I, Xiao Bai Yi, have always lived with dignity and nobility, so why do I have to fall into the hands of a disgusting woman like you!? The Heavens truly have no eyes!”

Ji Yao was infuriated, “How dare you despise this Young Lady!?”

While speaking, she rushed forward with a flicker, swinging her hands wildly as she looked like she was trying to claw out Yang Kai’s face, berating him at the same time without a break, causing everyone to stare in shock. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai blocked left and right, but it was not enough. Soon, his clothes were torn by Ji Yao, turning him into an utterly dishevelled mess.

“Sii… This woman is also an Emperor Realm Master?”

“Senior Xiao is an Emperor Realm Master, but he is no match to her at all! It’s obvious that this woman’s cultivation is higher than Senior Xiao’s.”

“I heard that Senior Xiao is from Azure Sun Temple, a top Sect in the Southern Territory, so where did this woman come from?”

Previously, everyone was just enjoying the show and did not pay much attention to Ji Yao until she made a move. The revelation of her Emperor Realm cultivation threw everyone into a panic.

A shrewish woman was not scary, but a powerful shrewish woman was utterly horrifying.

“Enough!” Yang Kai yelled angrily, shoving Ji Yao back with a surge of his Emperor Qi before he shot a ferocious glare at her, “Keep your hands off this Young Master or don’t blame me for being impolite!”

Ji Yao was dumbstruck, seemingly not having expected Yang Kai to dare to fight back, but soon, she roared hysterically, “Xiao Bai Yi! You dare to hit me? This Young Lady will beat you to death!”

Saying so, she flipped her hand and summoned a sword before swinging it towards Yang Kai.

It was too late for Yang Kai to dodge, so the sword cut a big hole in his robes, almost opening his stomach while it did so.

“Are you courting death!?” Yang Kai exploded as he pushed his Emperor Qi and sent a gigantic palm print towards Ji Yao.

*Hong hong hong… *

The faces of the audience changed drastically at the extraordinary combat moves of the two Emperor Realm Masters. However, with a light swish of her sword, Ji Yao easily repelled Yang Kai’s move. She pointed her sword up to the sky, and many flowers made of swords wrapped around Yang Kai in an instant.

“They really started fighting… “

“This will be the battle of life and death!”

“How can two people who are engaged to each other end up like this? Senior Xiao has a bad temper, but this woman is even more unreasonable!”

Previously, these five hundred cultivators were having fun watching the show, but they began to worry when they saw Yang Kai and Ji Yao start a fight, wondering if they would be caught up in the fallout.

Nevertheless, Huo Han was enraptured by the scene, secretly cheering for Ji Yao, wishing her to stab Yang Kai to death for good.

On the other side, Cao Xu was standing still with cold sweat beaded on his forehead. After a short hesitation, he hurriedly rushed towards where Feng Chi was stationed. The battle between two Emperor Realm Masters was out of his league. He could no longer interfere and could only report this matter to Feng Chi in hopes that the latter could find a way to deal with this.

The fight between Yang Kai and Ji Yao took to the sky as both of them appeared to be unleashing all their pent up hatred, yelling and cursing at each other without stopping as they exchanged attacks.

The sky was filled with the sounds of explosions as the two flew back and forth, engaging in an all-out battle.

There were many Emperor Realm Masters watching from below, but they did not meddle as they were not related to Yang Kai or Ji Yao in any way. All of them could not help laughing after learning what was going on.

After a short time, Yang Kai and Ji Yao had moved their fight far away from where it began. Soon, a voice came from below, “Young Master Xiao, what are you two doing!?”

Yang Kai quickly stole a glance while carrying on the fight, spotting Feng Chi arriving with a furious look on his face.

Yang Kai ignored him and continued to fight with Ji Yao, quickly moving them in a certain direction.

“Is Nanmen Da Jun on that side?” Ji Yao asked while realization dawned on her, still throwing moves that seemed like they would kill Yang Kai at any moment.

“En. I’ve been sneaking out secretly these past few days, and although I did not dare to investigate thoroughly, Nanmen Da Jun is definitely on that side. But, I still don’t know his exact location, so we’ll have to search for him!”

“What does he look like?” Ji Yao queried.

“I have never seen or met him before, so I can’t tell. But, since he is an Array Master who is responsible for breaking the Sect Defending Array, there will certainly be some Masters protecting him. We just need to look for the place where there are several Emperor Realm Masters together.”

“Good!” While replying, Ji Yao released her Divine Sense to look around.

Feng Chi’s face hardened in the absence of a response from Yang Kai, as if his face was covered by frost.

“Elder Feng, that’s where Grandmaster Nanmen is! We can’t let them get any closer to that side otherwise they will interrupt the Grandmaster!” Cao Xu reminded Feng Chi as soon as he saw the direction Yang Kai and Ji Yao were headed.

“I know. But these two are so heated right now I’m afraid they won’t stop unless someone falls,” Feng Chi muttered glumly, “If I knew this would happen, this King would never have allowed you to bring that woman over here.”

Cao Xu smiled wryly, “No one could have anticipated that woman to be this unreasonable.”

“This matter cannot be delayed, we must stop them now!” After his remark, Feng Chi immediately flew towards Yang Kai and Ji Yao.

“Over there!” Yang Kai’s face suddenly changed at that moment as he shot Ji Yao a meaningful look, “There is a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master and two First-Order Emperors over there. They should be the ones who are protecting Nanmen Da Jun!”

The two exchanged looks before coordinating to move closer to that side, still exchanging flashing attacks as they flew.

Not long after that, they were close to the location they had previously detected.

Yang Kai swiftly scanned the area and saw a middle-aged man with a burly figure setting up an array flag. There were three Emperor Realm Masters guarding beside him; one of them was a Second-Order, while the other two were just First-Order.

“Nanmen Da Jun!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he stared at the stocky man who was setting up the array flag.

“Who are you to be impudent here? Leave now!” Among the three Emperor Realm guards, the Second-Order Master shouted coldly as he looked up at them.

“Do it!” Yang Kai whispered to Ji Yao.

Ji Yao saw the opportunity and unreservedly performed a palm strike on Yang Kai. The power of this palm strike penetrated the clouds and wind, directly landing on Yang Kai’s chest.

With a miserable scream, Yang Kai spat a mouthful of blood and plummeted from the sky like a meteor.

Looking at the direction of his fall, he was heading directly towards the location of Nanmen Da Jun.

At the same time, Ji Yao’s eyes flashed furiously as she shouted, “Xiao Bai Yi, today is the day you die!”

While shouting, she flew downwards with a vicious look, as if she was leaving no chance for Yang Kai to live.

Ji Yao fell on the ground with Yang Kai, only a hair’s breadth distance from each other, but when they landed, they turned simultaneously and flew out together.

Ji Yao no longer restrained her strength as she swung her sword, causing the space around her to tremble.

“Second-Order Emperor Realm!” The faces of the three men who were guarding Nanmen Da Jun changed slightly. In that one shout, the Second-Order Emperor Realm Master had already made a move to intercept Ji Yao.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, went straight for Nanmen Da Jun, his eyes cold and vicious. At that moment, his vitality surged and he showed not the slightest sign of injury.

Although Nanmen Da Jun was an Array Master, his cultivation was not weak as he was also a First-Order Emperor Realm Master.

At the sight of Yang Kai’s aggressive pounce, Nanmen Da Jun was taken aback. However, he did not panic and instead took a few steps back while returning a cold gaze to Yang Kai.

“Who are you? How dare you try and harm Grandmaster Nanmen!?” One of the First-Order Emperor Realm Masters rebuked as he stood to block Yang Kai.

“Move!” Yang Kai roared and with a wave of his hand sent out a Moon Blade.

Seeing the incoming of the Moon Blade, the First-Order Emperor Realm Master snorted coldly and pushed his Emperor Qi to defend himself, but he had no clue about the lethality of Yang Kai’s Moon Blade. As his Emperor Qi touched the Moon Blade, it completely collapsed, scaring the life out of him as he hurriedly summoned his defensive artifact to protect himself.

However, he was too late, as Yang Kai had already arrived in front of him, and slammed a palm on his head.

With a thud, the First-Order Emperor Realm Master did not even have the time to react before his head was smashed and his brains splashed out.
