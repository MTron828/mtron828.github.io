The Grand Hall was filled with Open Heaven Realm Masters from all the Cave Heavens and Paradises to participate in the celebrations.

On hearing what Liu Mu said, they could not help but mutter in their hearts that the three bows ritual had really remained unchanged for ages.

As expected, Liu Mu looked at Yang Kai and said, “But, one of your Wives said that you have a few partners who could not be here due to some personal affairs. It would not be fair to them if you were to perform such rituals today.”

As soon as this was said, many people were startled and looked towards Yang Kai.

These Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises may not all be that familiar with Yang Kai, so they did not know how many partners he had in total. However, he already had six beautiful brides standing beside him, so how many more were there who could not make it over for the wedding!?

This brat was too much! It was rare for one to have so many partners and have all of them be so considerate to each other. How could this brat have such great charm?

“What’s more, your parents are not here either.” Liu Mu then continued, “So we will not be performing the three bows ritual today. Today is only a formality to gather your brides to you. You can do your own wedding properly later!”

[No wedding ceremony?] Yang Kai was taken aback by what was just said. He did not know what was in store for today’s events and up until now he just went along with it, but it was true his parents were not in the hall. Likewise, Su Yan and the others were also not present. It was indeed inappropriate if he were to make his marriage vows here today.

As for the Wife who Liu Mu mentioned, Yang Kai was sure that it was Yu Ru Meng who spoke up after reaching an agreement with the others.

“What do you think?” Liu Mu asked as he looked at Yang Kai.

“I will abide by this!” Yang Kai replied respectfully.

Liu Mu nodded, “Good! Deliver them to the bridal chambers!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was something unexpected for even the Open Heaven Realm Masters, who had lived for countless years.

After the six women left and were settled in one by one, Yang Kai, who was dressed in festive red, was dragged out to the hall again. A great banquet was set up here where all the people in Black Territory could participate regardless of their status or origin.

There were literally hundreds of banquet tables arranged with dishes and drinks!

As soon as Yang Kai showed up, he was led by Yang Xue to make a toast.

It could not be helped that there were a lot of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the various Cave Heavens and Paradises here. Most of them were Seniors, and now some were even his Elders from the Sects who took in Yu Ru Meng and the others as Disciples. Even the Divine Monarchs, their Honoured Masters, were personally present. Thus, Yang Kai, as a Junior, needed to personally toast these distinguished guests.

Yang Kai could not cheat when he was under the watchful eyes of so many Open Heaven Realm Masters, so each cup of the toasts had to be drunk to the last drop.

As a result, even Yang Kai, who had a high alcohol tolerance, started to become dizzy.

In the end, several Great Emperors had no choice but to help him with some of the drinks.

After a significant part of the evening had passed, Liu Mu walked over and patted Yang Kai’s shoulder as he said, “Good, you’re done here. You may retire to accompany your Wives. It’s your wedding night, so you should not be negligent. Still, you’re going to have a busy night,” he said cheekily as he grinned at Yang Kai. His innuendos were so obvious that even Yang Xue who was standing beside Yang Kai blushed intensely.

“Hic… en, Divine Monarch. Yes, yes!” Yang Kai responded drunkenly before waving his hands in all directions as he bellowed, “You people carry on with the celebrations. This Junior is going to subdue the Tigress with his Dragon!”

This led to laughter all around.

Yang Xue hastily grabbed Yang Kai’s arm and dragged him away. She could see that her Big Brother was really drunk. He must be very happy; otherwise, he would not have indulged himself like this. However, they really could not stay here any longer, as she did not know what inappropriate words her Big Brother would say if they remained here.

Yang Xue led Yang Kai into the inner sanctum of Void Land and High Heaven Palace’s temporary camp. Then, she paused and asked, “Big Brother, where to first?”

This was a question that Yang Kai had to decide since he took back six brides at once.

Yang Kai wiped his mouth and said with great pride, “To Ru Meng’s chamber!

[To think that this woman wanted to leave him and remarry! Today, I will show her how vigorous I am!]

“En!” Yang Xue responded and led Yang Kai towards Yu Ru Meng’s bridal chamber.

Yang Xue had been with the six women when they were taken to their respective bridal chambers; thus, she knew where Yu Ru Meng was. All of them were brought to six adjacent courtyards that were festively decorated.

The first courtyard was Yu Ru Meng’s, and as they walked inside, they saw someone outside the chamber. As a newlywed bride, there were many aspects that were inconvenient to handle personally; thus, someone was required to take care of and assist her.

The person standing outside Yu Ru Meng’s room was none other than Yue He.

Yang Kai hiccupped, stared, and asked, “Why are you here?”

Yue He elegantly bowed, smiled, and replied respectfully, “Young Master, today I am Madame Meng’s maid of honour.”

Yang Kai clicked his tongue, but he could understand such an arrangement considering that there were not enough people here from Void Land and High Heaven Palace.

“Thanks for your hard work!” Yang Kai said, and then directly stepped towards the entrance.

However, Yue He did not let him pass and instead stopped him at the door.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Yang Kai raised his eyes to look at her.

Yue He bowed again, as if she was really a maidservant. She then replied slowly and deliberately, “Young Master, Madame Meng said that she is not feeling well today. If Young Master was to come, she requested for Young Master to go somewhere else!”

Yang Kai could not help but glare at her and ask, “How could she not be feeling well on such a happy day? Is this some kind of joke?”

Yue He lowered her eyes and replied, “That is what Madame Meng said.”

Yang Kai looked around with his hands behind his back and saw that there was no one else but Yang Xue standing behind him and Yue He in front of him. He smiled and replied, “Oh? Want me to go somewhere else? Where to?”

Yue He pursed her lips and said, “As Madame Meng said, Young Master can go anywhere he wants as long as you don’t loiter here in front of her chambers. She said that any sight of you will anger her.”

“Ru Meng is usually such a sensible woman, how could she say such unreasonable things?” Yang Kai appeared as if he did not believe it and strode inside.

Yue He could not stop him, and he managed to push her aside.

A short while later, a loud bang was heard coming from the room, followed by a muffled grunt. It was impossible to tell what happened inside.

Yue He and Yang Xue, who were standing outside, looked at each other and then they craned their necks hoping to peek inside.

With a creak, the door opened and Yang Kai came out with his hands still behind his back. He then instructed Yue He, “Ru Meng is not feeling well, so you must take good care of her tonight.”

Yue He stared at the new black eye on Yang Kai’s face and struggled to maintain a straight expression, somehow managing to reply solemnly, “Rest assured, Young Master, I will take good care of Madame Meng.”

“Very good.” Yang Kai nodded and took a few steps forward before turning back and said sternly, “Don’t let anyone know what happened here.”

To think that he was barred from his own bride’s chamber on their wedding night, and then beaten by her after he tried to force his way inside. How could he face others if word of this travesty ever leaked out?

It looked like Yu Ru Meng was still upset with him!

“Yes!” Yue He answered dutifully.

After leaving this courtyard, Yang Kai turned right and went into the next courtyard.

This was the courtyard that Xia Ning Chang was in and the person guarding the door was Shu Mu Dan, Hua Yong’s wife.

“Sect Master,” Shu Mu Dan greeted respectfully with a bow as soon as she saw Yang Kai approach.

“Many thanks for your hard work!” Yang Kai nodded at her. These Sixth-Order Open Heaven Masters under his command were not raised by him, they all had joined him midway. Hua Yong and his wife Shu Mu Dan were the most loyal to Void Land though because their newly born child was raised in the Star Boundary and received a great deal of nourishment from the World Tree. As a result, their child’s aptitude was extraordinary and he could easily make an initial breakthrough to the Sixth-Order or maybe even the Seventh-Order in the future. As such, the pair were extremely grateful and devoted to Yang Kai.

They were thankful that they followed Yang Kai out of the Shadowless Cave Heaven back then; otherwise, their child would not have had such a great opportunity.

However, at this moment, Shu Mu Dan looked a bit uneasy as she stopped Yang Kai from entering the chamber and reported, “Sect Master, please kindly stay where you are. Madame is not feeling well today, so she probably can’t accompany you tonight. Madame said that you should go somewhere else first.”

[This excuse seems familiar…]

Yang Kai’s face twitched as he asked, “Not feeling well?”

It was understandable that Yu Ru Meng was upset and not in the mood for the night; after all, she had been angry enough to declare she would leave Yang Kai to find someone else to marry, but Xia Ning Chang was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who he had seen just a few hours ago. She was still fine at that point, so how could she not be feeling well all of a sudden?

[Little Senior Sister has always been the most obedient. In all these years, she always agreed to whatever I asked. So, how could it be that she refuses to see me tonight?]

Yang Kai felt really upset. [Was Little Senior Sister convinced by Yu Ru Meng to go against me? The nerve!]

Yang Kai thought of barging in directly, but then he decided against it. He did not want to make things difficult for Little Senior Sister.

“Sect Master, what happened to your eye?” Shu Mu Dan suddenly asked curiously.

[How could she even ask this question?] It was only when Yang Xue quickly shot a glance at Shu Mu Dan that the latter realized that she was out of line and quickly stuck out her tongue in embarrassment.

Yang Kai ignored her and called out, “Little Senior Sister, rest well, I will see you later.”

“…. en…” Xia Ning Chang’s voice sounded softly from inside.

Yang Kai looked at Shu Mu Dan again and instructed, “Take good care of her.”

“Yes!”

He turned around, left, and headed for the third courtyard.

The third courtyard was occupied by Ji Yao, and the lady outside the door was Zhou Ya.

When she saw Yang Kai arrive, Zhou Ya hastily greeted and then looked at him awkwardly.

Yang Kai chuckled flatly, clearly having anticipated the situation, and asked, “Is the Madame not feeling well?”

Zhou Ya froze for a moment and then nodded her head, “Sect Master’s insight is as masterful as ever, Madame is indeed not feeling well!”

“En…” Yang Kai remarked with a heavy heart. Without saying much more, he nodded and said, “In that case, make sure the Madame rests well. I will come back to see her later.”

“Sect Master, take care!” Zhou Ya said. She could not believe that he was already leaving. When she heard Ji Yao’s order earlier, she felt very worried. How could she drive away the groom on his wedding night?

Furthermore, Yang Kai was not just her Sect Master, but also her Master as Zhou Ya had left her name on the Loyalty List! As such, she did not dare to drive him away for Ji Yao.

Who would have thought that Yang Kai would leave on his own without her having to deny him entry to the chamber!

Zhou Ya heaved a sigh of relief.
