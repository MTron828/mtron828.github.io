Yu Feng laughed as he continued patting the blood-red crystal and boasting shamelessly.

Wu Yi nodded in agreement. Yu Feng was also a First Order Saint King, but he was much older than she was and had broken through much later in life. However, his strength was genuine, and since he couldn’t scratch this blood-red crystal, it was obvious how tough it was.

But only moments after those words left Yu Feng mouth, a cracking sound inexplicably rang out, and turning in the direction the sound was coming from, Yu Feng’s laughter caught in his throat, as if someone was choking him. His two eyes bulged as he stared at the scene in front of him, swiftly moving in front of Wu Yi to guard her as directed a vigilant gaze at the blood-red crystal.

The cultivators in the surrounding also raised their guard and no longer wore their sloppy, relaxed expression.

Wu Yi poked her head out from behind Yu Feng’s burly back and after seeing what was happening, she couldn’t help exclaiming, “Yu Feng, did you break it?”

At this moment, on the seemingly indestructible crystal, crisscrossing spider-web like patterns were rapidly spreading on its surface, and within a few breaths, the originally pristine crystal had become filled with cracks. It seemed as if it would break at any moment.

Yu Feng called out helplessly, “I didn’t use any strength just now, how could I have known it would suddenly start breaking apart? It wasn’t at all like this when I found it outside; no matter how many of us bombarded it, none of us could leave a mark on it. Young Lady, please step back, there’s something not right about this situation.”

Wu Yi nodded lightly and backed up a bit, but her eyes never left the blood-red crystal as she was quite eager to see what would happen next.

“Foreign Elder Chang is here,” Someone shouted excitedly.

Everyone looked back and saw Foreign Elder Chang Qi quickly walk in while stroking his neatly combed goatee. The group of cultivators in the ship’s hold all saluted. When Chang Qi arrived beside her, Wu Yi asked, “Foreign Elder Chang, do you know what this is? Why would someone be sealed inside such a crystal?”

Chang Qi frowned and released his Divine Sense to investigate but moments later shook his head, “Young Lady, this old master’s vision is limited. I cannot determine what kind of material this is, but perhaps it is something from beyond our Shadowed Star.”

“From the outside?” Wu Yi’s eyes brightened.

“It should be.”

*Kacha...*

A much louder cracking sound came from the blood-red crystal all of a sudden and in the front of everyone’s eyes, it shattered into a million pieces, scattering debris all over the hold, forcing the gathered cultivators hurriedly cover their faces.

In the next instant, the man inside the crystal fell to the ground and calmly opened his eyes. He seemed to want to stand up, but was too weak to do so, eventually settling for sitting on the floor.

“He’s really alive?” Many cultivators paled and even Wu Yi, who was extremely curious, wore a solemn look.

A man who should be long dead suddenly appearing alive and well was something beyond this group’s ability to understand.

Multiple Divine Senses burst out and swept this young man from all directions, but after realizing this person seemingly had no strength, everyone felt relieved.

Without any strength, he posed no danger, so naturally, there was no need for them to be vigilant.

“He’s no ordinary person,” Chang Qi slowly shook his head, “It’s impossible for an ordinary person to emerge safe and sound after being sealed in crystal. He’s most likely just temporarily weakened. His cultivation is unknown, so if we allow him to restore himself...”

Yu Feng’s face changed and he took a step forward, his Saint Qi bursting out as he yelled, “I’ll kill him!”

The realm of this person who emerged from the blood-red crystal was unknown, and his origins were also unknown, Yu Feng naturally dared not take him lightly.

“There’s no need to kill him, is there?” Wu Yi quickly interceded, “Just looking at him it’s obvious he’s still young, so even if his background is suspect, his cultivation shouldn’t be too high, restricting his movements should be enough.”

“Is Young Lady curious about him?” Chang Qi glanced over at Wu Yi thoughtfully.

“Isn’t Foreign Elder Chang curious as well?” Wu Yi smiled and stepped around Yu Feng, walked up the unknown young man, and squatted down to ask, “Can you understand what we’re saying?”

Seeing this young man nod, Wu Yi asked again, “What’s your name? Where do you come from?”

“Yang Kai, from Rainfall Star,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Rainfall Star?” Wu Yi raised her brow slightly, “It seems you really came from the outside. Rainfall Star is several years journey from here though, how did you manage to come here?”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “The last thing I remember was entering some strange place then coming across a blood-red pool. I accidentally activated some kind of Spirit Array and then fainted. When I woke up, I was here.”

Wu Yi knit her brow thoughtfully, “Then you’re saying you drifted all this way?”

“I think so. Where is this place?” Yang Kai frowned slightly, he wasn’t used to being questioned like this.

“Brat, just answer our questions honestly, don’t speak unless you’re spoken to!” Yu Feng yelled at Yang Kai, raising his huge fist as if to warn him what the consequences would be if he didn’t cooperate.

“You’re currently near Shadowed Star, heard of it?”

Yang Kai shook his head again, he really had never heard of Shadowed Star.

“It’s understandable that you haven’t heard of it. Shadowed Star is relatively remote, most people from the Star Field wouldn’t know about it. Hehe, your courage isn’t small, you don’t seem nervous at all.”

“What’s there to be afraid of? You don’t look like you have any malicious intent towards me,” Yang Kai grinned.

“Whether or not that’s true will depend on you. Haven’t you heard that a woman’s heart is impossible to know? Perhaps in the next instant, I’ll have you killed; after all, we know nothing about you, and keeping a stranger aboard our Starship is an unnecessary risk,” Wu Yi said lightly.

The smile on Yang Kai’s face immediately disappeared.

Wu Yi giggled, seemingly very satisfied, “That’s better. En, good, next question, what’s your cultivation?”

“Third Order Saint.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Upon hearing this, everyone couldn’t help breathing a sigh of relief, they didn’t need to worry themselves over a mere Third Order Saint. Although there was a possibility that Yang Kai was lying, considering his age, even if he wasn’t telling the truth, his strength shouldn’t be much higher.

“I still have a lot of questions to ask, but it looks like you’re quite exhausted so we’ll end things here for today. Yu Feng, take him to one of the rooms to rest and get him something to eat,” Wu Yi saw that Yang Kai’s complexion was pale and decided to restrain her curiosity for now.

Yu Feng nodded before shouldering Yang Kai and taking him out of the hold.

Not long after, when they came to an empty room, Yu Feng kicked open the door and tossed Yang Kai inside before shooting him a vicious look, “Brat, stay here quietly and don’t try anything funny, if I see you acting the slightest bit out a line, I’ll take your life immediately!”

“I know,” Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll behave.”

Yu Feng turned around and was about to leave when he suddenly turned back to Yang Kai and said, “What’s in your Space Ring?”

“Some Saint Crystals and pills,” Yang Kai replied.

Yu Feng glanced around, confirmed there was nobody nearby, and was just about to say something when Yang Kai took the initiative to throw his Space Ring over.

Yu Feng caught it and swept its content with his Divine Sense, immediately breaking out into a grin and nodding to Yang Kai, “Brat, seems you know what you should do. Good, wait here a bit, I’ll get you something delicious to eat.”

Saying so, Yu Feng ran out of the room.

Yu Feng grinned as he strode off. Although Wu Yi insisting that Yang Kai be spared had made him a bit uneasy, being able to easily obtain so many Saint Crystals made Yu Feng very happy.

After turning a corner though, Yu Feng saw Wu Yi standing there with a smile.

Quickly hiding the Space Ring behind himself, Yu Feng wore a big smile on his face.

“Hand it over!” Wu Yi stretched out her hand to him.

“What could Young Lady be talking about?” Yu Feng feigned ignorance.

“That person’s Space Ring is in your hands now, right?” Wu Yi smiled sweetly.

Yu Feng sighed while putting on a depressed look before slowing walking over to Wu Yi and placing Yang Kai’s Space Ring in her hand, saying in an exasperated tone, “Young Lady, can you not be so smart? Us men won’t be able to hold our heads up if you keep acting like this.”

“We’re not robbers, snatching someone else’s possessions will only create unnecessary grievances. If people like you were running the family, would it be able to survive?” Wu Yi rebuked him firmly.

When Yu Feng heard these words, he obediently lowered his head and sincerely apologized.

After Wu Yi reprimanded him fiercely, Yu Feng confessed to his crimes seriously and swore to not commit such offences again before walking off in a distressed manner. Only after he left did Wu Yi search the Space Ring with her Divine Sense, a wry smile appearing on her pretty face as she muttered to herself, “No wonder people say that there are so many Saint Crystals in the outside world that people never run out of them, a mere Third Order Saint actually carries so many High-Rank Saint Crystals on him, the Heavens are truly unfair. Although we can’t snatch this, it should be alright if he willingly gives it to me, in any case, I did save his life.”

A short time later, Wu Yi took back her Divine Sense from the Space Ring and decided to discuss it the next time she saw Yang Kai.

Inside the room, Yang Kai remained indifferent. The Space Ring he wore on his hand was just a guise; after all, in the Star Field, as long as one had a bit of strength, they would also have a Space Ring.

The one on Yang Kai’s hand only contained about five hundred High-Rank Saint Crystals as well as a few bottles of commonly used pills, nothing he would care about losing.

However, the approach of the man named Yu Feng made Yang Kai raise his vigilance, quickly searching his sleeve pocket and only breathing a sigh of relief after confirming the presence of three other Space Rings.

Although Yang Kai didn’t know how much time had passed, the three Space Rings belonging to Gui Che and his group had fortunately not been lost.

After confirming that no one was watching him, Yang Kai quickly transferred the contents of the three Space Rings to the Demon Mystic Tome.

If these three Space Rings were lost, Yang Kai would definitely be distressed.

Finishing doing all this, Yang Kai had time to investigate his situation.

After waking up, Yang Kai discovered that his body was devoid of all Saint Qi as if he no cultivation to speak of, worrying him greatly.

If a cultivator had no cultivation, they would just be an ordinary mortal.

After a careful inspection though, Yang Kai calmed down.
