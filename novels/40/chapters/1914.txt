“There is no need to say anything anymore! Just open the furnace!” Zuo De, ignoring everyone’s advice, stared straight at Yang Kai with determination.

Ai Ou opened his mouth. He looked like he had something to say but when he saw the look in Zuo De’s eyes, he could only sigh in resignation.

Yang Kai gently nodded and said indifferently, “As you wish then!”

While speaking, he reached out and smacked on the Purple Origin Furnace. In a flash, the furnace lid flew up as a streak of light shot out of the furnace. At the same time, a rich pill fragrance permeated into the surroundings.

“This...” Someone cried in surprise, eyes glued on the thing that flew out of the furnace. He had no inkling of an idea that Yang Kai had already finished refining.

And the reason why there was no pill fragrance from the start was entirely because the medicinal efficacy was concentrated beyond everyone’s imagination. Only when the furnace lid was opened that the pill fragrance spread out. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lost!

Zuo De lost!

Regardless of whether the grade of the Soul Source Restoration Pill refined by Yang Kai was good or bad, Zuo De had lost already. After all, he himself had said that as long as Yang Kai could refine it, he would have lost.

Just the fact that Yang Kai could refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill was evident that Yang Kai was really an Origin King Grade Alchemist!

Everyone’s breath couldn’t help but quicken. Their eyes were filled with enthusiasm and respect, looking at Yang Kai.

This kind of gaze should have only been enjoyed by Zuo De or any other Origin King Grade Alchemist.

The moment the pill flew out of the pill furnace, Zuo De couldn’t help but stagger, looking at the glowing thing that flew out in disbelief. He suddenly seemed to have grown a lot older.

But soon, he bit the bullet and shouted, “It’s not over yet. Whether it’s the Soul Source Restoration Pill or not has yet not been verified!”

“Yes, it’s not over yet!” Yang Kai burst into laughter as he flicked his finger at the Purple Origin Furnace for the second time.

Everyone was confused why he wanted to do this but the next moment, something unbelievable happened. Right after the first streak of light flew out of the furnace, another streak of light flew out of the Purple Origin Furnace. And the pill fragrance was even richer than before, filling everyone’s nose.

“Two...”

“How is this possible?”

“Can two Soul Source Restoration Pills be refined at once?”

“Am I dreaming?”

“Did President Ai Ou give him two sets of ingredients? No, that’s not right! Even if he had two sets of ingredients, it’s impossible to refine both sets at once. What’s going on!?”

All the Alchemists felt the common sense that had been etched in their minds for many years subverted. Every pair of eyes was staring at the two glowing pills that flew out of the furnace, dumbstruck.

Yang Kai took out the jade bottle that he had prepared long ago. Then he stretched his hand out before the two flying pills fell into the jade bottle as if they were bound by some power. Clear and crisp rings rang from the jade bottle as the two pills fell inside.

“Am I seeing this correctly? Did two pills just fly out of the furnace?”

“I also thought I was seeing things. What does this mean?”

For a long while, many Alchemists could be seen whispering to one another. But no one dared to step up and ask to check the pill for the fear that what they see next would subvert their own cognition.

“Grandmaster, do you want to check the pill?” Yang Kai asked Zuo De, holding the jade bottle.

Zuo De’s expression withered immediately. He didn’t say anything but looked at Yang Kai with a complicated look in his eyes.

The other Alchemists didn’t speak either.

“Let me,” Ai Ou said in a heavy voice as he stepped forward and took the jade bottle from Yang Kai’s hand.

“Then I shall trouble you, President Ai Ou.” Yang Kai smiled indifferently.

Ai Ou nodded and opened the jade bottle, taking a pill out in front of everyone’s eyes.

The pill was perfectly round and transparent. The fragrance wafting from the pill cleared everyone’s minds of all stray thoughts; they felt refreshed. If it wasn’t the Soul Source Restoration Pill, then what was it?

However, the Soul Source Restoration Pill refined by Yang Kai was slightly different from the one refined by Zuo De. It was even different from the one recorded in the pill recipe. The pill had a faint golden glow. The Soul Source Restoration Pill looked expensive and strong under this glow. Furthermore, everyone could feel the surging vitality from it.

Even someone who had no idea about Alchemic Dao could clearly tell that it definitely was a pill to save lives and heal wounds!

All the Alchemists were dumbfounded. They really couldn’t understand why the pill refined by Yang Kai using the same material was different from the one recorded in the pill recipe.

None of them had noticed that Yang Kai had dropped a drop of his pure Golden Blood into the pill furnace during the refining!

It was only when a pill had a spirit that it could be called a Spirit Pill. This was the last sentence recorded in the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture.

From it, Yang Kai came to realize that if he wanted to refine Spirit Pill, Pill Spirit was necessary!

Monster Beast’s Monster Core could be used as Pill Spirit. But his pure Golden Blood could also be used as Pill Spirit. And it was even better than Monster Beast’s Monster Core. After all, his pure Golden Blood contained unimaginable power and vitality.

Under normal circumstances, Yang Kai would not waste his own Golden Blood to refine a Spirit Pill. The Golden Blood was extremely precious. It was more valuable than a Spirit Pill.

But since he was treating Xue Yue’s mother this time, Yang Kai could not act stingy.

It was precisely because of the Golden Blood acting as the Pill Spirit that a faint golden glow had appeared on this Spirit Pill.

“Everyone can check if this is a Soul Source Restoration Pill or not!” Ai Ou passed the pill to the Alchemists as he spoke.

The Alchemists didn’t reject either. One of the Alchemists took it as the others gathered around to analyze it. Finally, they came to a unanimous conclusion that this was indeed the Soul Source Restoration Pill, and the medicinal efficacies seemed to be two parts stronger than recorded.

After this, everyone’s gaze towards Yang Kai became more solemn and respectful.

Subconsciously, they felt that Yang Kai had changed the Soul Source Restoration Pill’s recipe. In their opinion, that could be the only reason it could reach such a level!

One needed to be an Origin King Grade Alchemist to refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill, but if one wanted to modify the pill recipe of this level of pill, he or she needed to be a Mid-Rank or High-Rank Origin King Grade Alchemist!

Every pill recipe had been handed down through tens of thousands of years. It had been perfected by countless geniuses over countless epochs. Just by this fact, it could be reckoned how difficult it was to modify a pill recipe.

But today, they saw it.

They immediately understood that Yang Kai should be a Mid-Rank or a High-Rank Origin King Grade Alchemist!

All the Alchemists were shocked by this fact because they came to realize that not only he was a powerful Second-Order Origin King but also had unimaginable attainments in Alchemic Dao.

[Is he some old monster, who had been living for tens of thousands of years, in disguise? Otherwise, how could he do this at his young age?]

“Grandmaster, do you want to check it?” Ai Ou asked, looking at the pale and despondent Zuo De.

Zuo De’s previous approach and attitude had displeased Ai Ou very much, but seeing the Alchemy Grandmaster revered by the entire Star Field acting like this, Ai Ou couldn’t take it. After all, no matter what, Zuo De was still an Origin King Grade Alchemist. If he didn’t recover from this, it would be a loss to the entire Star Field.

Zuo De shook his head.

“Since that’s the case, then the winner of this competition...” Ai Ou was just about to announce the result of this competition, the Alchemists suddenly grew anxious.

Someone immediately shouted, “President, there is another pill. Can you take it out? Let’s have a look.”

“Yes! What about the second pill? Let’s take a look!”

Everyone had seen two pills fly out of the pill furnace and was confused by this. Alchemists had a strong thirst for knowledge, so how could they let Ai Ou ignore its existence?

Ai Ou couldn’t help but sigh. He glanced at Yang Kai with a complicated look in his eyes.

When he had opened the jade bottle, he had secretly taken a look at the second pill. When he saw it, he almost threw the jade bottle in fright. Thus, the requests of these many Alchemists had put him in a difficult position.

“Are you sure... you want to look?” Ai Ou asked after seeing Yang Kai show no objection.

“But of course. President, don’t hide it.”

“Sigh! Forget it, you can look at it yourself.” Ai Ou threw the jade bottle in his hand as he said this.

A middle-aged Alchemist in Alchemist’s robes with sharp eyes and quick hands immediately caught the jade bottle. As he focused his gaze inside, he stood stiff in his place as if he was struck by lightning. His eyes looked like they were ready to pop out, as if he had seen something incredible.

“Brother Zhao, Brother Zhao, what’s wrong? Say something quickly!” Seeing that he looked like he had seen a ghost, someone couldn’t help but urge the middle-aged man.

Nonetheless, the middle-aged man didn’t respond.

“Damn it, let me see!” A nearby Alchemist cursed out loud as he snatched the jade bottle from his hand. Then, his throat made some intangible noises. Just like the middle-aged man before, he stood in a daze with bulging eyes.

The jade bottle was snatched around by the Alchemists, one after another, but every Alchemist who saw the pill lying in the jade bottle was shocked.

If somebody who was not aware of the facts saw this, he might think that the jade bottle was filled with a poisonous pill, and a strong poison was leaking from the bottle, poisoning all these Alchemists.

Zuo De’s expression immediately changed. At the sight of this, he had guessed something. But when the thought crossed his mind, he found it unbelievable.

He staggeringly made his way without the slightest demeanour of a powerful master before snatching the jade bottle from a dazed Alchemist’s hands. Next, he poured out the pill straight on his palm.

The pill was surrounded by the very same pale golden glow and was still very round and transparent, but this pill had one big difference from the previous pill: Clear and distinct lines. They were distributed over the surface of the pill just like the meridians in a cultivator.

If these veins were spread on a sheet of paper, they would form a complex pattern that carried the truth of heaven and earth.

“Pill Veins!” Zuo De cried in shock. His old body started shaking like a willow swaying in the wind.

It wasn’t that he had not refined a pill with Pill Veins. Good or bad, he was still an Origin King Grade Alchemist and had been refining pills for a few thousand years. Countless pills had been refined in his hand, so he was lucky enough to refine pills with Pill Veins.

Some of the low-level pills even gave birth to Pill Clouds.

The pills with Pill Veins and Pill Clouds were the pride of Zuo De’s life, his honour as an Alchemist.

But it was his first time seeing an Origin King Grade pill with Pill Veins.
