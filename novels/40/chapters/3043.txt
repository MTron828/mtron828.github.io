Chapter 3043, A Secret Meeting With Zhu Lie

Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain & Dhael Ligerkeys

Yang Kai stood on the beach for a long time. The metallic tang that came with the breeze wasn’t so strong anymore.

Lu San Niang and her daughter dug out some holes and buried the four corpses so that they could rest in peace. She had always been a kind-hearted woman. Despite the fact that Madam Hua had humiliated and even tried to kill both her and her daughter, she was still willing to give them final rites.

After all, she couldn’t bring herself to leave their corpses lying out in the open. She had still lived with them for centuries and although they were not her friends, they could still be regarded as her acquaintances. Hence, she wouldn’t let their corpses decay on the beach. She also made sure to handle Yuan Wu properly, even though the corpse had been completely burnt black.

It wasn’t until the sun was sinking into the horizon that they were done with everything. Seeing that Lu Yu Qin was pale-faced, Lu San Niang draped her arm around hers as they walked towards Yang Kai. At that instant, Lu San Niang was at a loss, not knowing what she should do next.

Li Jiao had been taken away to nurture the Dragon Blood Flowers, so she could only rely on Yang Kai now; however, she wasn’t so familiar with him either, and after what had happened in the morning, she couldn’t see through the mystery surrounding this young man.

He remained arrogant when confronted by Madam Hua, and he could also talk back in front of a member of the Dragon Clan. All he had been doing seemed to be putting him in a dangerous situation, but he managed to escape unscathed in the end.

At that moment, she was three metres away from Yang Kai as she thought about what she should say to him. The incident in the morning made her realize that there was a huge difference between them, so she couldn’t treat him casually anymore.

Just then, a splashing sound could be heard. A water column shot out from the sea, as though a Sea Monster was taking a breath. There seemed to be a gargantuan figure hiding below the surface.

With his gaze fixed on that figure, Yang Kai said, “Elder Sister Lu, I have to go now, but I’ll be back soon. Please don’t go anywhere.”

“Oh, okay,” Lu San Niang subconsciously replied. Feeling warmth in her heart as she knew that Yang Kai had been taking care of her because of Li Jiao, so she was glad that Li Jiao had made such a good friend.

At the thought of Li Jiao, Lu San Niang became dejected, for she knew that she couldn’t get back together with him again. She didn’t treasure the man previously, and now, she could only reminisce about the past.

When she came to her senses, Yang Kai had leapt into the air and plunged into the sea. After a splash, the Sea Monster turned around and swam forward with an unwelcome guest on its back.

One hour later, a small Spirit Island came into sight. The Sea Monster stopped before reaching the island.

Understanding the Sea Monster’s intention, Yang Kai stomped his foot and landed on the island in the blink of an eye, upon which the Sea Monster turned around and disappeared into the sea.

After scanning the island with his Divine Sense, he ascertained his destination and activated his Space Divine Ability, after which he instantly appeared on the top of a hill.

Zhu Lie had been waiting for Yang Kai, so he wasn’t surprised at the latter’s arrival. Turning around, he asked with a frown, “Why are you on Dragon Island?”

Exasperated, Yang Kai charged forward and grabbed Zhu Lie’s collar as he glared at him, “What do you think, my little brother-in-law?”

“Let go!” Zhu Lie lowered his gaze and scowled. Given his identity, he couldn’t accept that someone was grabbing his collar, even though there were no outsiders around.

“I’ve been patient with you enough!” Yang Kai wouldn’t release him and continued to glower at him, “I’ve already figured out that Zhu Qing didn’t return to the Northern Territory because she followed you back to Dragon Island. It’s because of you, right? If you didn’t instigate Qing’er, she would have waited for me at High Heaven Palace.”

Zhu Lie replied coldly, “Dragon Island is where the members of the Dragon Clan have been living since forever. Where else could we go other than this place?”

“How dare you deny it! Do you think I don’t have the guts to lecture you?”

“Don’t you cross the line! This isn’t High Heaven Palace! We’re on Dragon Island!”

“What’s the point of you yelling about that? Since I’m here, of course I know I’m on Dragon Island! However, as your brother-in-law, I have the right to teach you a lesson, wherever we may be. Even if Zhu Qing is here, I’ll still lecture you whenever I want to. Let’s see who she’ll side with.”

Zhu Lie gnashed his teeth together, “You’re so unreasonable.”

Yang Kai sneered, “It’s better than how you played a dirty trick on me.”

Zhu Lie growled, “When did I play a dirty trick on you? Stop slandering me!”

Yang Kai uttered, “Why don’t we talk about why Qing’er secretly returned to Dragon Island, then? Why didn’t she even inform me about it? Do you dare to say it has nothing to do with you?”

“How would I know the reason behind it? Maybe she got sick of you. Stop thinking so highly of yourself. You’re just a Human, so you’re no different from an ant to the Dragon Clan.”

Yang Kai was so exasperated that he started laughing, “Good, let me teach you a lesson today! Let’s see if you’re really as noble and powerful as you think you are!”

“You’re so irrational!”

“You don’t respect your Seniors at all!”

After bickering for a bit, they shut their mouths suddenly and stared at each other. With no one willing to back down, the atmosphere was intense, but a moment later, Yang Kai released Zhu Lie’s collar and snorted.

Displeased, Zhu Lie adjusted his collar and patted his clothes with a disdainful expression.

With his gaze fixed on the sea, Yang Kai asked, “So, where’s Zhu Qing?”

Without answering his question, Zhu Lie questioned, “How did you get to this island?”

Pursing his lips, Yang Kai replied, “I’m a Master of the Dao of Space, how difficult could it be for me to enter this world?”

Zhu Lie shook his head, “It might have been possible in the past, but the Elders placed a seal at Dragon Island’s entrance. If a trespasser appears, that seal will automatically transform into a Void Labyrinth. It’s impossible for you to barge in.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Indeed, there was a Void Labyrinth, but it couldn’t stop me.”

He was eager to find out Zhu Qing’s whereabouts, so he decided not to tell Zhu Lie what he had gone through in the Void Labyrinth. Otherwise, he might invite unwanted trouble.

“You must have been lucky, then.” Zhu Lie sighed. He had heard from the Elders that the Void Labyrinth could even trap a Great Emperor for some time. If anyone tried to break free from it, the Elders would be alerted. The reason they had placed such a seal at the entrance was to prevent anyone from entering Dragon Island without them knowing. It didn’t necessarily have to trap the person inside it, but its purpose was to alert the Elders at a critical moment.

Hence, Zhu Lie didn’t expect that Yang Kai was lucky enough to have found a way out of the Void Labyrinth.

“Go back now,” Zhu Lie heaved a sigh. “You shouldn’t have come here.”

Yang Kai looked at him from the corner of his eye, “I won’t go back before achieving my goal. I want to see your Elder Sister.”

Zhu Lie shook his head, “You can’t see her.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold, “You won’t help me? Don’t forget it’s me who brought you out of the Revolving World. I don’t expect you to be grateful, but you should at least know how to return favours.”

Nevertheless, Zhu Lie shook his head again.

With his patience running out, Yang Kai threatened, “I really will beat you up.”

Zhu Lie explained, “It’s not that I’m not willing to help you… But it’ll be useless even if I lend you a hand.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned.

Zhu Lie fell silent, as though he was thinking how to tell Yang Kai about it. A moment later, he turned around and stared fixedly at him before uttering, “How far will you go for my Elder Sister?”

It was the first time Yang Kai heard him addressing Zhu Qing as ‘Elder Sister’. Although he didn’t call out to Zhu Qing directly, it showed his love for his sister.

Realizing something, Yang Kai questioned in a grim voice, “Has she fallen into danger?”

“Answer my question first.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I don’t have to tell you anything about your Elder Sister and me, and you have no right to butt in on our affairs; however, if anyone dares to stop me, they’ll be my enemy. The Dragon Clan is no exception.”

“What if it will cost your life?”

Yang Kai replied coldly, “No one can take away my life from me.”

Zhu Lie nodded as his cold gaze turned softer, “Perhaps Zhu Qing has found the right man. I hope you’ll always remember what you just said.”

In an impatient manner, Yang Kai asked, “So, has she gotten into any danger?”

Zhu Lie replied, “Not really, but… She has been confined.”

Yang Kai turned gloomy and spoke in a cold voice, “Is it because of me?”

Zhu Lie nodded, “That’s right. You said that I instigated Zhu Qing to return to Dragon Island directly without waiting for you in the Northern Territory. I admit that it was my intention, and I’d persuaded her to do so, but in the end, it was she who made the decision. However… I didn’t expect that the reason she wanted to return to Dragon Island was to inform the Elders about what happened between you two.”

He turned around and spoke in a slow manner, “She wanted to gain their approval to get married to you!”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, but he soon became enraged, “How could the Dragon Clan imprison her just because of that?”

Zhu Lie yelled, “It’s taboo for a Dragon to marry a Human!”

Yang Kai scoffed, “Rubbish! I know what your Dragons have been up to all this time. Over the years, both male and female Dragons have been keeping their own playthings on their own island. Why don’t your Elders imprison all of them?”

Zhu Lie refuted, “Just like what you’ve said, they’re playthings, which is a different case between you and Zhu Qing. If she gets married to you, she’ll have to break away from Dragon Island. The Elders will never allow that to happen!”

“She’ll have to break away from Dragon Island?” Yang Kai was stunned as he didn’t expect that Zhu Qing would make such a decision. Although he wasn’t familiar with the Dragon Clan’s rules, he could picture how infuriated the Elders were when they learned this news.

It wouldn’t have mattered if Zhu Qing was just an average Dragon Clan member; however, she was already a Ninth-Order Dragon, so the Elders wouldn’t allow her to set a precedent.

After a sigh, Zhu Lie said, “If I knew this would be the outcome, I wouldn’t have told her to come back. Now…” He sighed again.

With a frown, Yang Kai questioned, “Didn’t she attempt to flee?”

Zhu Lie stared at Yang Kai as though the latter was a fool, “Her Dragon Vein has been sealed, and her cultivation has been suppressed. Now, she can’t even circulate her strength, so how is she even going to flee?”

“Where is she now? Bring me to see her immediately.” Yang Kai was anxious.

“It’s pointless even if you go because you can’t break into the place where she’s been confined. Even if you manage to get in, you’d still be doomed.”

“How do you know when we haven’t tried?” Yang Kai snorted.

“I know you’re a master of the Dao of Space, but that’s useless. Second Elder has confined her to her own Spirit Island, so she can detect anyone who tries to enter.”

“Is the Second Elder very strong?”

“As strong as a Great Emperor!”

Yang Kai gasped upon hearing that. If that was true, he didn’t even need to attempt. Before he could even go near the island, he was certain he would be discovered.
