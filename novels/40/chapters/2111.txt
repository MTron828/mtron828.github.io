Hua Qing Si stared at Yang Kai with hatred and dread, thinking about what she had gone through. She couldn’t help but pout then sit down on the ground and make a scene, “Heartless bastard, you are worse than a dog. I curse you to suffer in hell for all eternity...”

Yang Kai’s face fell and he glared at her in silence, waiting for her to finish her tantrum, yet she didn’t stop grumbling even after a long while, and he could only yell at her, “Enough!”

Hua Qing Si suddenly quieted, choking with sobs, while her fragile shoulders shivered lightly...

“Just look at yourself, you are a great Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator, yet you’re spewing profanity like a street thug. What a disgrace!”

Hua Qing Si said aggrievedly, “What can I do... fight you? I can’t defeat you, and I don’t even have the right to curse you?”

“As long as you obey me, I won’t torment you,” Yang Kai snorted coldly and spoke.

Hua Qing Si nodded repeatedly, saying, “I’m obedient, very obedient.” Not forgetting to wipe her tears and show him an ugly smile.

“You should have done so long ago,” Yang Kai snorted and spoke.

Yang Kai mulled this over for a while, then walked toward Hua Qing Si and stretched his hand toward her.

Hua Qing Si moved back instinctively, seemingly out of fear, but upon noticing that he didn’t harbour any malice, she pursed her lips, summoned her courage, and stretched her hand toward him and let him pull her up.

“Come with me!” As he spoke, he used his power and teleported along with Hua Qing Si.

A flash of light streaked past her eyes for a short moment, and by the time she regained her sight, they had already arrived at a bamboo house, a simple yet graceful bamboo house.

“This place has buildings?” Hua Qing Si was bewildered. “Does someone live here?”

“Yeah, but that’s a matter of the past,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

Many years ago, he brought his friends and relatives from Tong Xuan Realm into the Shadowed Star. During his trip, more than ten thousand people resided in the Small Sealed World, and many houses were still left here.

“Sit down!” Yang Kai beckoned at her then sat down.

Hua Qing Si hesitated for a moment then sat down opposite Yang Kai.

“I’ll ask you several questions, and you have to answer me honestly,” Yang Kai spoke only after she sat down.

Hua Qing Si nodded in response.

“Did you travel to Maplewood City to investigate the cause of Han Leng’s death?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qing Si hesitated for a while, but she still nodded in the end. “That’s right!”

“Why?” Yang Kai stared at her.

Hua Qing Si organized her thoughts and words for a moment then said, “Junior Brother Han Leng is my master’s disciple, a banished disciple, and it looked like he had stolen one of my masters’ treasures before escaping from the Star Soul Palace. So, I hunted him down mainly to retrieve that treasure.”

“What is it?”

“I don’t have any idea, as my master didn’t tell me, but he told me that it’s a token.”

“A token?” Yang Kai raised his brows, but he quickly recalled something and took a strange token off his Space Ring. He showed it to Hua Qing Si and asked, “Is it this one?”

The token was pocket-sized with a very special texture, which was neither wooden nor metallic, and the word ‘Dragon’ was carved on its front side, while the design of a True Dragon soaring into the firmament was carved on its backside.

He had gotten this token from Han Leng’s Space Ring, but he couldn’t fathom its function at that time, and that was why he just placed it in his Space Ring and paid no more heed to it.

Now, Hua Qing Si had just told him that she came after this token under her master’s orders, and he immediately realized that the token was anything but simple.

Hua Qing Si was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator and her master should be at least a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, yet he was still preoccupied with the token, which clearly showed its worth.

“Did you find it in Junior Brother Han Leng’s Space Ring?” Hua Qing Si asked.

“That’s right.”

“If he didn’t have another token in his Space Ring, then this should be my mission’s objective,” Hua Qing Si cast a glance at the token with a weird look plastered on her face.

“Can you recognize what it is?” When Yang Kai raised this question, he paid close attention to her expression.

Hua Qing Si first shook her head, then stretched her hand and took the token. Upon examining it closely for a while, her expression changed and her body shook all over. She couldn’t help but cover her mouth and let out a surprised cry.

“Speak!” Yang Kai urged her impatiently.

“If I am not wrong, then it should be the famous Dragon Island Token,” Hua Qing Si said in alarm.

“Dragon Island Token?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows and said, “What’s that?”

“Have you never heard about it?” Hua Qing Si stared at him, seemingly surprised that he didn’t even know the Dragon Island Token. [He is really ignorant!]

But upon casting another glance at his face, she swallowed the mocking words that had just reached her tongue, and said carefully, “Sir, did you ever hear about the Dragon Island?”

“Dragon Island? Does a dragon live in it?” Yang Kai asked back, then chuckled, “I’m just cracking a joke.”

But, Hua Qing Si’s expression was still tense and solemn.

“Does a dragon really live on Dragon Island?” Yang Kai asked sceptically.

Hua Qing Si nodded in response.

“Are you serious?” Yang Kai rolled his eyes at her.

Dragons were one of the strongest Ancient Divine Spirits, and beings the likes of True Dragons and Heavenly Phoenixes were only the talks of legends and ancient records, and they didn’t exist in this world.

Hua Qing Si’s face got flushed and she rolled her eyes at Yang Kai. She said, “If the Dragon Island is real, then a dragon should be living in it, and it isn’t just one or two.”

The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He was left speechless!

Hua Qing Si said, “It’s said that the Dragon Island is the most mysterious force of the Star Boundary, and it’s also the strongest because a lot of True Dragons’ descendants reside there, and there are even Ancient and Primordial Dragons. Even the ten Great Emperors dread those ancient beings, but ordinary people such as us still aren’t sure whether it exists or not, and it’s only the strongest cultivators who have access to this secret and it’s also only them who can find the Dragon Island.”

“As for the Dragon Island Token, it’s a token from Dragon Island,” Hua Qing Si added, “Anyone who holds this token can go to Dragon Island and ask for a favour from the Dragon Clan, as long as it isn’t anything overboard which they can’t accept. For example, if I travel to Dragon Island with the token, then I can ask the Dragon Clan to use a True Dragon’s Power to raise my cultivation base into the Emperor Realm, and it won’t be limited to just the First-Order of the Emperor Realm...”

As she brought up this subject, a longing look appeared in her pretty eyes and she held the Dragon Island Token tightly, while her breathing turned rough.

Yang Kai stretched his hand and the Dragon Island Token flew back to his palm. He cast a glance at Hua Qing Si and said, “Go on!”

Hua Qing Si revealed a sheepish smile and hid the zealous look apparent on her face, then said, “Since primordial times, only five Dragon Island Tokens appeared, and it’s still only a talk of ancient legends. It’s said that three of them were used up, and every usage has shaken up the whole Star Boundary.”

As she spoke up to this point, she raised a finger and said, “One of them was eighty thousand years ago. The Northern Territory’s second greatest sect, the Profound Frost Sect was destroyed in one night. None of their tens of thousand disciples had survived and their Emperor Realm Masters also perished. It’s said that a Dragon Aura was left in its ruins and is present to this day. A lot of cultivators visit it to try their luck and seek a fortuitous encounter.”

“The second one was fifty thousand years ago. Some gutsy person provoked the Divine Spirit Shi Huo, and the whole Southern Territory was turned upside down by the infuriated Divine Spirit. Sects were destroyed, families exterminated and innumerable beings perished. Even the ten Great Emperors made a move, to no avail and none could stop the Divine Spirit’s killing spree. If Dragon Island didn’t step in to repel it, all of the Southern Territory’s people would have suffered the brunt of its rage.”

“As for the third time, it was thirty thousand years ago. The strongest master of the Human Clan, Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, died with signs pointing to the Dragon Clan’s involvement in this ordeal. That battle had been earth-shattering, many stars were shifted and World Principles were toppled...”

“The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was killed by the Dragon Clan?” Yang Kai suddenly interrupted Hua Qing Si and questioned her sceptically.

Hua Qing Si stuck out her tongue. “It’s only a legend and I’m not certain of it, but it’s quite likely. After all, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was the strongest master of the Human Clan, and his opponents wouldn’t have been able to slay him despite joining hands, and the Dragon Clan’s involvement is the sole logical explanation for this.”

As she spoke up to here, she looked in confusion at Yang Kai, “Have you heard of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor?”

“Are you taking me for a country bumpkin?” Yang Kai looked askance at her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Hua Qing Si laughed sheepishly and said, “In any case, it’s said that those three incidents are all related to the Dragon Island Token’s usage, and if this token is really the Dragon Island Token, then... You should properly consider how you will use it. After all, it’s a priceless treasure.”

“Since when are you so concerned about me?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Hua Qing Si mumbled out of displeasure, “Is it wrong to show any concern for you?”

“Are you sure it’s the Dragon Island Token?” Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qing Si shook her head. “I have never seen the real Dragon Island Token and don’t know what it looks like, but from its design and texture, it can be surmised that it’s this one. If you are still sceptical, then why don’t you ask some knowledgeable person. You may probably get more clues about it.”

“We aren’t even sure whether Dragon Island is real or where it is. It’s too early to give any thoughts into the Dragon Island Token’s matter,” Yang Kai said then put away the token.

He already had a person in mind, and he should question him, as he might have some accurate info about it.

“Sir...” Hua Qing Si said coyly, while twisting uneasily. She stared at Yang Kai and said stammeringly, “I have already told you everything you want to know... So, why don’t you...”

“Enough daydreaming!” Yang Kai rejected her bluntly.

“Do you really plan to imprison me here for life?” Hua Qing Si was quite frustrated. “I’m from the Star Soul Palace and I came here to investigate Junior Brother Hang Leng’s death under the order of my master. If I don’t go back to make a report, then my master will sooner or later come over and he may even trace this back to you.”

As she spoke up to here, she nodded repeatedly, saying affirmatively, “He’ll surely trace it back to you. You don’t want to be eyed by him, do you? He’s a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, so hurry up and let go of me. Let’s part on good terms.”
