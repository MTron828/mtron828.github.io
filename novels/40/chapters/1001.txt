Chapter 1001, Brother, It’s Good To See You

The strange Floating Continent was filled with beautiful scenery and extreme rich World Energy.

The entire continent was blanketed in a thin layer of mist that was actually condensed World Energy.

Clear springs flowed from all the mountain peaks, carrying with them a sweet and clear scent. The water in these springs had an incredible nourishing effect, as if it wasn’t ordinary water but instead a potent elixir.

The Purple Star and Sword Union forces had a total of more than a hundred cultivators between them, and now that their battle had been forcefully stopped, each side began searching for quiet places to meditate and recover.

Soon, they were surprised to find that on this Floating Continent, the speed at which they could restore themselves was several times faster than usual because the World Energy aura was incredibly rich. This discovery greatly lifted their spirits, coupled with the fact that they had just survived a number of life or death crises, they began to unconsciously relax and greedily absorb this dense World Energy.

Only the inexplicable seven coloured sky that surrounded the Floating Continent gave them an uneasy feeling.

All day long, all that was visible when they looked up was this seven coloured sky. There was no sun, moon, or stars in this place. It was completely different from where these cultivators used to live. This kind of unchanging scenery made them feel somewhat lost.

A day later, most of the cultivators had finished restoring themselves. They had carried a lot of healing pills on them before entering this place, and with the rich World Energy aura here, all minor injuries could be rapidly healed.

Lu Gui Chen of Purple Star suddenly flew over to Sword Union’s side, calmly walking over to Yue Xi under the hostile glares of the Sword Union cultivators.

When she noticed his footsteps, Yue Xi slowly opened her eyes, turned to him, and asked, “What is it?”

Lu Gui Chen gestured towards the tallest mountain in the distance and asked, “Aren’t you curious about the identity of that Senior?”

“So what if I’m curious?” Yue Xi replied indifferently, not showing much interest.

How could she not be curious? She had been thinking hard during this past day about the identity of this old man, but she was still no closer to figuring out who he was. She believed that Lu Gui Chen was also considering the same problem and him showing up now was proof of that.

“That dark flag used by that Senior shouldn’t be a nameless treasure, but no matter how I think about it, I can’t think of a single master in the past thousand years who used a similar artifact. What do you think?”

“I also don’t recognize what the big flag is,” Yue Xi shook her head.

“Sure enough... how about the two of us cooperate to inquire about the situation?”

“Collaborate with you?” Yue Xi disdainfully sneered, “Isn’t that like asking a tiger for his skin?”

“Don’t say that,” Lu Gui Chen didn’t mind her tone, “Now your Sword Union people and my Purple Star people are stranded here. With that extremely powerful Senior also here, according to custom, we should pay him our respects.”

“Do you think he will meet us?”

“I don’t know, but we have to start somewhere. At the very least, I need to inquire about his intentions. This shouldn’t have any downside to your Sword Union’s people,” Lu Gui Chen persuaded.

Yue Xi frowned and hesitated.

She knew that what Lu Gui Chen was saying was right, but she was subconsciously repulsed by the idea of allying together with this enemy of hers.

However, compelled by the current situation, she really couldn’t refuse Lu Gui Chen’s proposal, so after a moment of silence, she gently nodded, “Good, I’ll accompany you to visit that Senior.”

“Rest assured, this time I won’t try to act against you, we’ve both seen the strength of that Senior, there’s no way I’d act unreasonably here,” Lu Gui Chen smiled bitterly. This strange Senior was on the same level as a Star Master, even if there were ten of him, Lu Gui Chen was certain he wouldn’t be the other side’s match.

Yue Xi issued a few instructions to the Sword Union survivors before getting up and setting out together with Lu Gui Chen for the mountain where the old man lived.

After the two of them left, the He Zao He Miao sisters exchanged a glance and quickly got up before silently heading towards where Yang Kai was.

What happened yesterday had made them feel quite guilty so they wanted to apologize to Yang Kai while at the same time reassure him that if he just waited a few more days, Yue Xi would help lift the seal on his strength.

However, He Zao was keenly aware that her master didn’t trust Yang Kai, so she did not try to make contact with him while she was around, lest her Master’s impression of him worsen.

It was only now that she the right opportunity.

Just as they had started to leave though, the cultivator named Wei Wu suddenly appeared in front of them and asked with a smile, “Where are Junior Sisters going?”

He Zao frowned, “To take a walk.”

Wei Wu smiled and said, “Then Senior Brother will accompany you.”

“No need!” He Zao frowned unhappily and decisively refused.

Wei Wu however just shook his head, “Junior Sister, Master just said a moment ago for us not to act arbitrarily, because no one knows what kind of dangers are hidden here. Master sees the two of you as her own daughters. If anything were to happen to you, who will be able to take responsibility? Let Senior Brother accompany you, and if anything happens, Senior Brother can at the very least buy time for you to escape.”

As he said these words, Wei Wu held his head up high and stuck out his chest, trying to make himself look as heroic and reliable as possible in front of He Zao and He Miao.

“Didn’t that Senior yesterday say there wasn’t any danger here?” He Miao blinked innocently.

“Who knows whether that Senior was speaking the truth or not? His strength is incredible, so this place very well might not have anything that he considers dangerous, but we are different. It’s because we don’t understand the situation of this place that Master is going with Lu Gui Chen to inquire about it.”

“Senior Brother, tell me the truth, does Master have some kind of doubts about Yang Kai’s origins and identity?” He Zao narrowed her beautiful eyes and directly asked Wei Wu.

“Why would Junior Sister say that?” Wei Wu looked surprised.

“Because yesterday, Master gave me the feeling that she didn’t want us to have too much contact with Yang Kai, and when we brought him over yesterday... Master seems to have offended him somehow,” He Zao spoke without reservation as she recalled the frightened and angry appearance Yang Kai had at that time.

If their Master hadn’t secretly tried to do something to him, he would certainly not have been so angry.

Wei Wu chuckled, “Junior Sister is being too sensitive, how could Master care about such a small character? Besides, everything Master has done is to protect us disciples, but enough idle chatter, if two Junior Sister wish to go out for a walk, let Senior Brother accompany you, I’d also like to take a look at our surroundings.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“No need for that, we don’t want to anymore,” He Zao shook her head before bringing He Miao back to where they were originally sitting and sat back down.

Wei Wu scratched his nose but was helpless to do anything about this so he simply found a place nearby to sit down and meditate.

Yang Kai had not missed this little incident. Although he was safe for the time being, right now he was all along so he had to keep his guard up.

Especially against that slut Bi Ya from Purple Star as she had constantly been eyeing him. If not for the deterrence of the mysterious old man, it was likely she would already have attacked him.

So he had constantly been paying attention to the movements inside the two groups of cultivators. He had seen Lu Gui Chen and Yue Xi leave together. He had also seen He Zao and He Miao attempt to come see him but get stopped by that male cultivator.

Although he wasn’t completely clear about the details, he could vaguely guess what the situation was.

Suddenly, from nearby, a strange sound rang out, causing Yang Kai to turn towards its source, a strange expression appearing on his face as he slowly walked over to it.

A moment later, arriving near a bush, he called out, “Shen Tu?”

Shen Tu’s head popped out and glanced around before he beckoned to Yang Kai and hurriedly withdrew into the bush.

Yang Kai laughed helplessly before strolling forward, arriving in front of Shen Tu and asking, “What are you doing?”

“Hiding from those people,” Shen Tu replied in a low voice before grinning. “Brother, it’s good to see you. I really thought we were dead this time, but unexpectedly we both survived. It seems we haven’t used up all our luck yet.”

After saying so, he began gasping for breath as his face paled.

Yang Kai quickly noticed that this guy had suffered a lot more damage in the disaster yesterday compared to himself; his chest was dyed red with blood and his clothes were shredded. It was obvious something had impaled him and he had later pulled it out. His expression was quite gloomy as a deep frown appeared on his forehead, giving him a fierce look.

“Seems you’re quite miserable!” Yang Kai squatted down and said.

Shen Tu’s face turned bitter as he muttered, “Fuck, I didn’t think it was that bad, but hearing you say that really makes me feel a bit miserable, why are you completely unharmed?”

“My luck was good, how did you wind up like this?” Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders.

“How would I know? When the Starship was destroyed, I immediately passed out, and when I woke up, I found myself here. Fortunately, the Starship pieces didn’t pierce anything vital, otherwise, you’d be collecting my corpse for me right now,” Shen Tu groaned, grimacing in pain as some cold sweat leaked down his forehead.

“Haven’t you taken a healing pill yet?” Yang Kai asked as he stared dumbfounded towards Shen Tu, it was as if the latter hadn’t even attempted to restore himself yet.

“All my possessions were seized by those Purple Star dogs, what kind of pills would I possibly have? Even my artifacts were seized. If I had my artifacts, I wouldn’t have been reduced to this miserable state,” Shen Tu said indignantly, “Brother, do you have any spare healing pills?”

Yang Kai nodded and pretended to take something out from the Space Ring on his hand. In fact, he had actually taken out a Saint Grade healing pill from the Demon Mystic Tome.

“En, a Saint Pill with Pill Veins?” Shen Tu’s eyes lit up, quickly accepting the Saint Pill. It seems that such a pill was quite a treasure even for him, so without hesitation, he swallowed it and let out a sigh, “Give me some time, I should be able to restore myself.”

“You meditate, I’ll stand guard,” Yang Kai offered casually.

Right now, he and Shen Tu were allies, so there was no harm in helping him with such a small matter.

“Shouldn’t we move a little farther away?” Shen Tu looked worriedly towards the distance, “If we’re discovered by those Purple Star or Sword Union people...”

“Rest assured, they won’t dare find trouble with us right now.”

“What do you mean?” Shen Tu asked in confusion.

He seemed to know nothing about the old man who appeared yesterday. It was likely he was still unconscious when that incident took place.

Yang Kai explained briefly about the old man and as Shen Tu listened to his story, his expression changed greatly and he muttered, “Then, could that old guy be an Origin Returning Realm master? No, that’s wrong, perhaps he’s reached an even higher realm.”

As he muttered to himself, his expression became especially awkward.
