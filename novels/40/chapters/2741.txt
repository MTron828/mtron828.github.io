“You recognized me?” Yang Kai scratched his cheek, feeling a little frustrated that his prank failed.

Hua Qing Si rolled her eyes, “I didn’t think of it before because of how sudden it was, but looking closely at you now, I can still see some traces.”

And, when she heard Yang Kai’s voice just now, Hua Qing Si was able to recognize him in an instant.

After returning the Five-Coloured Spear to her, Yang Kai said proudly with his hands on his waist, “Don’t I look handsome?”

Hua Qing Si responded, “A little fiercer.”

“Fierce is good.” Yang Kai laughed.

“What Secret Technique is this? Why haven’t you used it before?” Hua Qing Si asked curiously.

“During my recent retreat, this was a gain I encountered by chance while immersing myself in my cultivation,” Yang Kai looked pleased with himself.

Hua Qing Si curled her lip, “It’s obvious that Zhu Qing was the one who taught you.”

“En, so what do you need from me?” Yang Kai dispersed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique and restored his original appearance, but the clothes on his body had become tattered. Since his body suddenly doubled in size, it was only natural that his clothes would be stretched and broken.

Hua Qing Si ignored this entirely and just handed over two Space Rings to him, “The Source Crystals from Fire Dragon Palace and Full Sky Sect have arrived.”

Yang Kai waved his hand casually, “Keep them. We can just get the funds from there when the Sect has any needs in the future.”

Hua Qing Si was now the Head Manager of High Heaven Palace. Even though Yang Kai had already given her quite a lot of Source Crystals last time, it wasn’t that much considering he had some two billion High-Rank Source Crystals in storage. With so much wealth stashed away, High Heaven Palace would not have to worry about cultivation resources for at least the next fifty years.

“Good,” Hua Qing Si nodded and put away the rings again. “Also, Grandmaster Ji is here and wants to see you.”

“Oh? Brother Ji is back so soon?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. After some thought, he said, “I’ll go and change. Tell him to wait a moment.”

“En,” Hua Qing Si left with her orders while Yang Kai went back to his room and changed into a new set of clothes, wondering whether he should buy an Artifact Armor or not. He did not need an extra defensive artifact, but if he was going to keep using the Dragon Transformation, having clothes that would adjust to his size when his body swelled would be useful.

Artifact Armor was generally incredibly sturdy and flexible, far more so than ordinary robes.

Inside High Heaven Palace’s main hall, Ji Ying sat while glancing out from time to time, looking anxious.

Hua Qing Si was accompanying him.

A short while later, a figure came in from outside. It was Yang Kai.

“Brother Yang!” Ji Ying quickly stood up.

Yang Kai greeted him with a big smile, “Brother Ji, you’ve arrived so quickly! Are you ready to stay in my High Heaven Palace and refine pills?”

Ji Ying smiled bitterly, “My apologies, but I may have to postpone this matter.”

Yang Kai’s heart sank, “Could it be, the Great Emperor…”

Ji Ying shook his head, “Honored Master did not comment much on this matter, but instead showed interest in you and asked me to tell you to visit Medicine Pill Valley when you are free.”

“The Great Emperor wants to see me?” Yang Kai turned serious.

Ji Ying smiled, “Please don’t worry, Honored Master is just interested in exchanging ideas about Alchemy with you since you were able to beat me in a match.”

This was just modesty, as the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor was an existence beyond mere Emperor Alchemists, so even if Yang Kai had excellent Alchemy skills, what sort of ideas could he exchange with him? The Wondrous Pill Great Emperor obviously just wanted to give Yang Kai a few pointers, and that was why he said things in such a roundabout way.

Yang Kai respected that. Even though he had never met the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor before, this invitation alone was enough for Yang Kai to feel that this Great Emperor was easily approachable.

But of course, the prerequisite was Yang Kai having enough ability. After all, a Great Emperor wasn’t a character that just anyone could meet.

“The Great Emperor is generous, this Yang is filled with gratitude!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

Ji Ying smiled, “Honored Master says that it was fate that you found Third Senior Brother’s legacy, so it is yours now.”

“Please help me give my thanks to the Great Emperor,” Yang Kai nodded. He had expected this result as it was naturally impossible for the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor to be petty enough to deny him this inheritance given his status and identity.

Ji Ying then turned solemn, “This Ji came bearing an order from my Honored Master and has a rather presumptuous request to make.”

Yang Kai said, “Since it is an order from the Great Emperor, please speak freely, Brother Ji.”

Ji Ying explained, “Could I trouble Brother Yang to accompany me to retrieve the bones of my Third Senior Brother so they may be buried in Medicine Pill Valley?”

Yang Kai raised his brows and nodded, “Naturally. Senior Gong Sun Mo’s last wish was to return to Medicine Pill Valley, so I’m sure he must be smiling now that it has been fulfilled.”

“Many thanks, Brother Yang. I remember hearing from Brother Yang previously that Third Senior Brother passed away in the Southern Territory, is that right?”

“That’s right. At the Southern Territory’s Yuan Furnace Mountain. I remember the place.”

“It’s a long journey to the Southern Territory, so we should not delay, shall we?” Ji Ying enquired, “Only, I’m wondering if Brother Yang has any other matters to take care of before we depart?”

Yang Kai smiled, “I barely have any disciples in my High Heaven Palace right now, so what matters would I need to take care of? Since Brother Ji is in a hurry, let us depart now.”

He was originally planning to return to the Southern Territory anyway, so this was quite convenient for Yang Kai. As for Zhu Qing’s request for him to remain here, he didn’t pay it any heed at all.

Yang Kai didn’t inform the three Monster Kings either as he could even kill a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master now, so there weren’t many people who could threaten his life in this world. There was naturally no need to have the three Monster Kings accompany him.

When Yang Kai brought Ji Ying to the Space Array, two Thousand Leaves Sect disciples guarding the place immediately greeted him with respect, “Greetings, Palace Master!”

“Did Manager Hua tell you to keep watch here?” Yang Kai looked at the two of them.

The slightly older Thousand Leaves Sect disciple responded respectfully, “Yes. Manager Hua has taken great care of us and also posted many tasks to us at Thousand Leaves Peak. Junior Brother and I were lucky enough to take on the task of guarding the Space Array in exchange for some contribution points.”

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded. “If anything happens, send a message to Manager Hua immediately.”

“Yes!”

Yang Kai was very satisfied with Hua Qing Si’s arrangements. No matter what, this was still an important place. There wasn’t a single person guarding the Space Array the last time Yang Kai came over, so he quickly reminded Hua Qing Si about it and sure enough, a ‘round the clock guard’ had been established.

The two Thousand Leaves Sect disciples didn’t recognize Ji Ying, but if they knew that he was a direct Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, their eyes would surely have popped out of their sockets.

“Brother Yang, where does this array lead to?” Ji Ying asked curiously as he stood on the array, watching Yang Kai set down Source Crystals on the grooves.

“Brother Ji will find out soon enough.” Yang Kai smiled, his vague answer making Ji Ying even more curious.

“Brace yourself now, Brother Ji!” Yang Kai suddenly cautioned Ji Ying.

Ji Ying failed to stifle his laughter. Even though he was an Alchemist, he was still a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, so what could a trivial Space Array do to him? Unless it was that kind of super long-distance Cross-Territory teleportation.

Thinking so, Ji Ying had a start.

Before he could recover from his surprise though, his vision was filled with white light, and a bout of dizziness washed over him…

By the time Ji Ying recovered, he found Yang Kai standing beside him, looking at him with an amused face.

Ji Ying shook his head, still feeling dizzy, but his face was filled with shock, “Cross-Territory Teleportation?”

Ordinary Space Arrays couldn’t affect him in such a way. He had also been on Space Arrays countless times, and he never felt anything no matter how far he travelled on them, but this time, he was left extremely dizzy, so it was easy to imagine just how far they had travelled.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Ji Ying was shocked, “How could there be a Cross-Territory Space Array in High Heaven Palace?”

High Heaven Palace was originally Seeking Passion Sect, and Ji Ying had visited there many times in the past. If Seeking Passion Sect had a Cross-Territory Space Array, it was impossible that Ji Ying would not know of it. It had to be known that Cross-Territory Space Arrays were extremely precious treasures, and only a few of them still existed in the entire Star Boundary. What’s more, they were all in the hands of the Sects of Great Emperors. These few Space Arrays were all relics from ancient times.

Right now, practically nobody could arrange a Cross-Territory Space Array in the Star Boundary.

Ji Ying was naturally shocked.

Yang Kai did not answer, only smiling as he motioned, “Let’s go.”

Ji Ying followed Yang Kai and flew alongside him. After looking around, he was shocked again, “A Small Sealed World?”

Yang Kai smiled, “Brother Ji has good eyes. Indeed, this is a Small World that was originally the foundation of Thousand Leaves Sect, but I have taken over it now.”

Ji Ying sighed, “Ah, what a pity.”

It wasn’t Yang Kai taking over the small world that was a pity, but rather that the grade of this small world was not high enough. Even though the World Energy here was serviceable, it wasn’t at the level of a true cultivation paradise yet.

If the World Energy here were just a little denser, then it would be possible to grow some rare spirit medicines here, developing it into a medicine garden.

Cultivating spirit medicines in small worlds like these was very safe, and as an Emperor Alchemist, Ji Ying would always consider things from the perspective of an Alchemist.

A short time later, the two of them arrived before another Space Array, the one that led out of this Small Sealed World.

After activating the Space Array, Yang Kai and Ji Ying immediately appeared inside Thousand Leaves Sect.

“This used to be Thousand Leaves Sect’s foundation, but unfortunately, the Sect was razed more than a year ago,” Yang Kai explained while looking at the dilapidated scenery.

Ji Ying nodded lightly and asked, “So, this is the Southern Territory, right?”

Since Yang Kai used the Cross-Territory Space Array, it naturally brought him directly to the Southern Territory.

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded and turned to him, “I hope Brother Ji can keep the matter of this Space Array a secret.”

Ji Ying was stunned for a moment, but he soon promised solemnly, “Rest assured, Brother Yang. This Ji isn’t the type to run his mouth to others.”

Yang Kai smiled, “It’s nothing that serious. If the Great Emperor asks, then Brother Ji can inform him.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ji Ying was grateful, “Many thanks, Brother Yang.”

After all, he originally estimated that a round trip from the Northern Territory to the Southern Territory would take at least a year, so if he suddenly returned in just a few days, then Ji Ying really wouldn’t know how to answer if his Honored Master were to ask how.

Yang Kai was clearly thinking for his sake.

“Let’s go, I’ll take you to Yuan Furnace Mountain.” Yang Kai flew out first.

Yuan Furnace Mountain was not close to Thousand Leaves Sect, so it would take at least three to five days for the pair to fly there. However, since both of them were Emperors with rich backgrounds, there was naturally no need for them to rest halfway there.

Yang Kai remembered that Yuan Furnace Mountain was located near Maplewood City, on the border of Raging Fire Temple.

Back in those days, Raging Fire Temple was an untouchable existence for Yang Kai because he was only in the Origin King Realm back then, while they had a Dao Source Realm Master assuming command.

But now, a trivial Raging Fire Temple could hardly even be compared to a hair on Yang Kai’s head. After a decade, most of the people whom he needed to look up to were now prostrated at his feet.
