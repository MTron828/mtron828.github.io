Out of fear of Grandmaster Zuo De, those Origin Grade Alchemists didn’t dare to talk to Yang Kai anymore. Zong Ao, on the other hand, didn’t care about it at all. He walked to Yang Kai and started chatting in a low voice.

Yang Kai, taking advantage of this, also inquired about Gu Bi Hu’s condition. Zong Ao had been staying in here all these days, paying complete attention to Gu Bi Hu’s injuries. So, he knew about her situation pretty well.

Yang Kai also got a lot of useful information.

“Who is that guy by the way? Why did he jump out first to accuse me before I said anything?” Yang Kai gestured at the hook-nosed man and asked.

Zong Ao answered in a low voice, “He is Zhan Yuan. He didn’t have an aptitude for Alchemy and also hadn’t received guidance from a good teacher. As such, he hadn’t achieved much in Alchemy. He was originally unknown, but later received Grandmaster Zuo De’s guidance by some chance and coincidence and was enlightened, becoming a Mid-Rank Origin Grade Alchemist at a very fast rate. For this reason, he had always regarded himself as a Grandmaster’s student. And due to this relationship, he naturally couldn’t stand your remark.”

“So that’s how it is.” Yang Kai understood everything immediately.

Apparently, Zhan Yuan not only respected Zuo Debut also regarded Zuo De as his Honored Teacher. Zuo De naturally held a very high position in his heart. Yang Kai might not have spoken ill of Zuo Debut when he said that Grandmaster was putting on airs, he could hardly take it.

“However, about Grandmaster Zuo De... well, it’s hard to say,” Zuo Do had something to say but he didn’t say everything.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, knew what he meant to say.

As Alchemists, Zuo De had walked farther in Alchemic Dao than Zong Ao. Zong Ao could not show any disrespect in any way. Disrespecting Zuo De was tantamount to disrespecting Alchemic Dao. Thus, there were some things Zong Ao couldn’t say.

“In any case, be careful! Kid, you might be a Second-Order Origin King Master now, you should never underestimate the power of an Origin King Grade Alchemist. Let’s say, if President Ai Ou had to choose between Grandmaster Zuo De and you, he would choose the former in eighty percent likelihood!”

“I understand!” Yang Kai smiled.

Just as the two were chatting in low voices, a cultivator donning a golden armor suddenly barged in and cupped his fists before reporting to Ai Ou with a serious look on his face, “President, Grandmaster Zuo De has arrived!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“He is here!?” Ai Ou’s eyes lit up immediately. He waved his hand and shouted, “Invite him quickly!”

But just as he said this, he hurriedly said again, “No, this King will go and personally welcome him!”

He had been on edge while waiting for half a year, for the fear that Gu Bi Hu would not be able to hold on before Grandmaster arrived. And now, Grandmaster has finally arrived in Water Sky City. A heavy weight had been lifted off Ai Ou’s heart.

All that was left was to wait for Grandmaster to refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill. Gu Bi Hu could be rescued from the coma by then.

While speaking, he tidied up his clothes before rushing to the outside.

Naturally, the others in the hall didn’t dare to be inattentive, almost everyone in the hall was an Alchemist. When they heard that Zuo De was already here, they couldn’t hold themselves. They rushed after Ai Ou, one after another, hoping to catch a glance of the revered Grandmaster.

The hook-nosed man named Zhan Yuan gave Yang Kai a vicious glare as he passed by Yang Kai. There was a sinister smile hanging on his lips as if he was saying that since Grandmaster is here, you are so dead.

Yang Kai curled his lips, ignoring him altogether.

“Let’s go welcome him. If Grandmaster saw us standing here still, I’m afraid it would upset him again. It will be very troublesome.” Zong Ao shook his head and smiled wryly before rushing outside in neither fast nor slow manner.

Yang Kai gave it a thought before following him out.

Outside the hall, a dozen or so Origin Grade Alchemists stood behind Ai Ou in a file, looking up at the sky.

Somewhere in the sky, a streaking rainbow was shooting straight over at an astonishing speed; obviously, it was some kind of flight type artifact.

Not many people dared to use flight type artifacts in places like Water Sky City. And very few dared to use it in such a high-profile manner. But clearly, Grandmaster Zuo De was qualified for this. Furthermore, no one dared to object to this.

At first, Yang Kai thought that the other party was riding a Star Shuttle.

But on a closer look, he noticed that it wasn’t the case.

The streaking rainbow might be far away from the hall, but Yang Kai could see it clearly, owing to his high cultivation. It was a peculiar sedan chair lifted by eight people, four in the front and four in the back. Wind was being continuously created under their feet, carrying the sedan chair swiftly and leaving a trail of rainbow behind.

All eight carrying the sedan chair were young and beautiful with great figures.

The sedan chair itself was very luxuriously decorated. The seats were spacious and two figures were sitting on it, one young and one old. The old man’s hair and beard were all white and had his eyes closed, he happened to be resting and relaxing. The young figure was a girl who happened to be standing on the sedan chair and looking about as if she was curious about everything.

“This Moon Chaser Sedan Chair was specially built by Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce for Grandmaster. It’s 10% faster than the best Star Shuttle. Those girls were gifted to the Grandmaster by the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. It has already become Grandmaster’s symbol.” Zong Ao explained to Yang Kai in a low voice.

Yang Kai immediately chuckled. “Grandmaster Zong Ao is just a step away from becoming an Origin King Grade Alchemist. You will definitely enjoy the same treatment in the future.”

Zong Ao shook his head in disdain. “This old man only wants to pursue the Alchemic Dao to the end. I don’t care about these material objects.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and no longer said anything.

After a short while, the Moon Chaser Sedan Chair arrived and landed steadily before the main hall. Ai Ou tidied up his clothes and just as he was about to speak, a figure shot out from the sedan chair.

That graceful and charming figure, accompanied by giggles that were as melodious as chimes of silver bells, rushed to Yang Kai’s side and hugged someone next to him, burying her head into that person’s arm before taking long and deep breaths greedily.

Everyone was shocked! They could not help but wonder who it was, so ignorant of etiquette and doing such a shameless thing in public. Everyone turned their gazes at that lithe and graceful figure.

After having taken a clear look at the scene before them, everyone showed a smile of understanding. Yang Kai, on the other hand, was dumbstruck.

Because he found that the graceful figure from the sedan chair was hugging none other than Xue Yue beside him!

Xue Yue looked extremely embarrassed at this moment. Obviously, she hadn’t expected such a thing to happen in public. She didn’t push, nor could she. For a moment, she was at a loss and froze in place.

Yang Kai, on the other hand, blew his top! Instinctively, he wanted to rush up and beat the other party to let her know that his woman could not be harassed.

But on second thought, he gave up this notion as the other party was a woman herself.

That figure rubbed her head on Xue Yue a few times like a cat before raising her head, revealing her face that was as beautiful that the moon would hide itself in the clouds and flowers would close in shame. She then greeted in a charming and melodious voice, “Brother Xue Yue, long time no see. Did you miss me?”

The corners of Xue Yue’s lips twitched a few times. She forced a smile and said, “So it’s Sister Zuo Ling. I was wondering who was being so bold. Well, Sister Zuo Ling, can you let me go first?”

“Hei hei!” The girl named Zuo Ling obediently let go of Xue Yue and backed away, standing before Xue Yue. She then narrowed her eyes and sized up Xue Yue from top to bottom before nodding and praising, “Brother Xue Yue, you have grown more handsome and manly from the last time we met. No wonder the girls in the Star Field are crazy about you.”

There was a hint of jealousy in her words, but she praised Xue Yue in an outspoken manner. Anyone with a bit of brains would understand what it was all about.

Presumably, the girl named Zuo Ling had been in love with Xue Yue for a long time.

It wasn’t that surprising. Xue Yue was the man of every girl’s dreams in the Star Field. She was a lady killer. Naturally, a little girl would fall in love with her.

And judging by Zuo Ling’s words, the two seemed to have known each other for a long time.

“Sister Zuo Ling is too polite!” Xue Yue forced a smile.

It would have been okay had Yang Kai was not here, but Yang Kai was standing by her side, watching the play. Feeling his gaze, Xue Yue felt jittery all over her body. She was extremely embarrassed.

“Ling’er, don’t be rude!” Right then, a majestic voice sounded from behind; Zuo De slowly got up from the sedan chair and shouted in a deep voice.

Zuo Ling stuck her tender tongue at Xue Yue before whispering, “I’ll come and find Brother Xue later. Grandpa is calling me.”

As she spoke, her lithe figure jumped to the sedan chair’s side in a flash like a nimble cat before she respectfully helped Zuo De get down.

Yang Kai looked at Xue Yue with a strange smile hanging on his lips.

Xue Yue became angry out of shame, shooting glares at Yang Kai.

“Welcome Grandmaster, thank you for taking the trouble of coming here!” Only now did President Ai Ou find the opportunity to speak. He cupped his fists and greeted him.

“Greetings, Grandmaster! Grandmaster must be tired from the long and tiresome journey!” All the Origin Grade Alchemist bowed and greeted respectfully.

“Haha, I’m too old for this. The road was indeed a little bumpy. Sorry for making you all wait!” Zuo Du cupped his fists perfunctorily in response.

Yang Kai sized up the nearby Grandmaster and found that he looked extremely ordinary, just like an ordinary old man. He was only in the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm, that’s all, but his every gesture carried a faint medicinal fragrance; obviously due to dealing with pills all year round.

Judging by his outer appearance, Grandmaster Zuo De looked rather approachable.

[Maybe something might have really happened to him for him to be delayed by half a year.] Yang Kai thought to himself. [Otherwise, he should not have dragged until now after having been invited by President Ai Ou.]

“Grandmaster must be tired from the journey. Do you want this King to arrange a place to take a break?” Ai Ou asked with concern.

“Mhmm, that sounds nice. This old man is indeed a little tired.” Zuo De nodded lightly. Much to Ai Ou’s surprise and dismay, he really agreed.

Ai Ou was stunned. He kept staring at Zuo De in a daze, thinking, [I was just being polite, why are you taking it seriously? Can’t you see the worry written on my face? Or have your eyes gone so old that you can’t notice?]

Other Origin Grade Alchemists also furrowed their brow slightly.

Everyone felt that Grandmaster Zuo De was wrong here.

[It’s okay to make us wait for half a year. You are an Origin King Grade Alchemist, you have all the right to put on airs like this. But now that you are already here, it’s right and proper to start refining and save the patient as soon as possible.]

[Moreover, a Starship was sent to pick you up. You even rode the Moon Chaser Sedan Chair. The journey might be long but you didn’t use a bit of your strength. How can you be tired?]

Ai Ou was starting to scowl.
