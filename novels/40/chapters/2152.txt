“There is such a mystical Secret Technique in this world?” Lan Xun asked after listening to Yang Kai’s explanation, which made her incredibly surprised.

She was deeply knowledgeable and well-read. After all, she was the daughter of the Bright Moon Great Emperor and knew various Secret Techniques of the Star Soul Palace. Naturally, she could pick up whatever she wanted, but she had never heard anything like ‘Universe Shifting Divine Art’ before.

However, the effectiveness of this Secret Technique was obvious to all. With the cultivation of First-Order Dao Source Realm, Yang Kai was unharmed under the attack of the two Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters. This was nothing short of extraordinary.

Naturally, she could not have known that there was no such thing called the ‘Universe Shifting Divine Art’ in this world, and Yang Kai had just used his Nihility Secret Technique at a critical moment to avoid being hit by hiding in the void. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Princess, this Secret Technique, I’ve shared with you because I am grateful for before. However, you must not spread news of it.” Yang Kai solemnly exhorted, as though asking Lan Xun to make an oath.

“En.” Lan Xun could not help nodding, and at the same time, wondering if she should get this Secret Technique from Yang Kai. Although the conditions to activate the Universe Shifting Divine Art were harsh, it was undeniably powerful. It could definitely save lives at critical moments.

Suddenly, Yang Kai rubbed his hands again with an apologetic face. “Princess, since I’ve answered one of your questions, can you answer one question for me?”

“What do you want to ask?” Before Lan Xun spoke, Xiao Chen immediately cut in with vigilance.

“I just want to ask about the Star Seal, what did you think I wanted to ask?” Yang Kai looked at Xiao Chen innocently, as if he was deterred by his aura.

Lan Xun pursed her lips and smiled. “Brother Xiao Chen, why must you be so aggressive against him?” Then, she turned to look at Yang Kai and asked, “You want to ask about the classifications and grades of Star Seals, right? “

Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. “The Princess is really beautiful and intelligent. It is as though you can see right through my heart.”

Lan Xun smiled. She did not hide anything and with a serious expression, explained. “The Star Seals’ grading, so to speak, is more related to the shape of the Star Seal... The more complex the Star Seal. The higher the grade. For example, the diamond-shaped Star Seal on your hand should be considered a relatively inferior one. Below it is the triangular Star Seal and on top of it is the pentagonal, five-pointed Star Seal. There is also a six-pointed, seven-pointed and even nine-pointed Star Seal!”

“Different Star Seals... other than the number of points they have, what are the differences?” Yang Kai asked sincerely.

The reason why he deliberately got close to Lan Xun was to inquire about the Star Seals. Even if he asked Hua Qing Si about this, he should receive the same answer, but Lan Xun was the daughter of the Great Emperor. She might have had information that others did not know about.

“I don’t know the specific difference.” Lan Xun slowly shook her head. “However, it is said that the higher the grade of the Star Seal, the more benefits one can get from Shattered Star Sea. We can only enter the Shattered Star Sea to find out.”

“I see...” Yang Kai muttered thoughtfully.

It could not be said for certain that Lan Xun had revealed all the information she knew. However, she had answered most of Yang Kai’s doubts, even if it was not a comprehensive explanation. Therefore, it was not good for Yang Kai to press for more answers.

As they were talking, they had already arrived at the location.

Around the area, cultivators were gathered in twos or threes, standing on the treetops of a forest, looking up at the sky, as if silently waiting for something.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately jumped to the top of a tree and turned his head to look around.

Wu Chang, Luo Yuan, Xiao Bai Yi, and Murong Xiao Xiao, who set off before him, had all arrived. In addition, there are some other cultivators, who were obviously attracted by the light show just now.

Yang Kai did a rough scan around and found that there were at least a dozen people here. What’s more, ‘swooshing’ sounds could be constantly heard within the depths of the forest. It was obvious that more were coming.

And in the sky, a huge cloud was slowly forming. It had a golden hue, as though the cloud was cast in gold. It was extremely dazzling and mysterious. Especially since Yang Kai could faintly feel strange energy fluctuations from this golden cloud.

“Huh...” As he was observing, he suddenly stopped his gaze and turned his attention to somewhere not too far away.

Over there, a man and a woman were looking at him with a smile on their faces. Once their eyes met, the woman beckoned to Yang Kai.

“How unlucky!” Yang Kai secretly cursed. Unfortunately, he could not pretend that he did not see them. After all, even if he did, they would come to him. In a flash, he jumped down from the treetop and went to where they were.

“Why are the two of you here?” Yang Kai asked the two.

These two were none other than Bian Yu Qing and Kou Wu from Blue Feather Sect.

Although Yang Kai had no grievances with them, their direct superior was none other than Wu Meng Chuan. If possible, Yang Kai wanted to avoid having any contact with them.

“We were here!” Bian Yu Qing replied with a smile, reading between the lines. She was indicating that they were transported to the Two Seasons Mountain Range.

“Oh?” Kou Wu’s eyes lit up, staring at the back of Yang Kai’s hand, “Junior Brother Yang actually managed to get a hold of a Star Seal? We should celebrate!”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he helplessly exclaimed. “If it is possible, I don’t want this thing!”

“Junior Brother Yang... what you are saying isn’t true, right?” Kou Wu teased.

Yang Kai snorted. “Look around and see how the others react after hearing what you’ve just said. You will know what I mean.”

Kou Wu looked around. His face suddenly sank.

Because he found that the cultivators gathered here, all cast their eyes on the back of Yang Kai’s hand, with several of them having greedy covetous eyes.

Although several dozen Star Seals had appeared in the sky just now, so far, none of the cultivators present has obtained a Star Seal. The Star Seal was related to the credentials to enter the Shattered Star Sea. It was their main goal when entering the Four Seasons Realm. Before they entered, every Sect Elder would have given at least a thousand sermons to their disciples: ‘to your best to compete for the Star Seals while ensuring your own safety.’

Kou Wu did not notice, so his voice was a little loud. This caused Yang Kai to become the focus of everyone’s attention, and he could not help feeling a little guilty and uneasy.

Bian Yu Qing giggled, her beautiful eyes scanned around for a second before staring at the man in front as she spoke in a soft tone. “If you don’t want it, how about leaving it with me?”

“What a beautiful way of thinking!” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

“How merciless...” Bian Yu Qing stared at Yang Kai, biting her red lips. “If I hadn’t taken care of you in the past, do you think you would still be standing here today?”

“Aren’t you embarrassed to talk about what happened during that time?” Yang Kai squinted at her, coldly snorting, “If you didn’t force me to stay in the Blue Feather Sect back then, I wouldn’t have....”

“Wouldn’t have what?” Bian Yu Qing asked.

“Nothing,” Yang Kai waved his hand. When he remembered that Wu Meng Chuan had taught him the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, he felt uneasy. Fortunately, he did not cultivate the Secret Art and instead gave it to the Embodiment. As such, even if Wu Meng Chuan had some kind of sinister plan, it would not harm him.

“Look at him. Just like I had expected, he has a human’s face but is still a beast at heart. He was acting so conscientious and innocent in front of the Princess, but now, this beast is messing with a seductress!” Not far away, Xiao Chen seized the opportunity and approached Lan Xun. He looked at Yang Kai contemptuously, while trying to discredit him.

“You just have to speak your mind. Why are you getting so close?” Lan Xun flashed further away with disgust.

“I was afraid you won’t be able to hear...” After being avoided like the plague, Xiao Chen had a sullen expression. Meanwhile, his hatred of Yang Kai grew even more. Just now, Yang Kai had also approached the Princess like this, but she did not react in such a manner. On the other hand, she quickly moved aside when it came to him.

Xiao Chen’s heart was filled with rage.

“I’m not deaf!” Lan Xun coldly snorted, her beautiful eyes looked forward as she spoke with suspicion. “Anyways, what I want to know now... is where all the Star Seals that have fallen have gone.”

Everyone here had been chasing the direction where the Star Seals fell. However, there were no traces of them here. Lan Xun couldn’t help but wonder what was going on.

“Let me ask around.” Xiao Chen immediately spoke up. After he said his piece, his eyes swept around, and finally was fixed on a short man. This man was with two more people. A man and a woman. The three of them dressed similarly. Obviously, they were from the same Sect.

Their cultivation was not low, the highest being the short man Xiao Chen set his eyes on. He was in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. Meanwhile, the other man and woman were both in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm.

“You! Come here!” Xiao Chen pointed at the short man and shouted.

The little man heard this, and looked around for a while, before pointing at himself suspiciously, “Me?”

“Yes, you!” Xiao Chen said impatiently.

After confirming that Xiao Chen was beckoning him, the short man could not help but have a change of expression. Meanwhile, the man and woman with him became nervous, wondering what Xiao Chen wanted to do with their Senior.

Before entering the Four Seasons Realm, smaller Sects and the Elders of the families had already done a comprehensive investigation. They had already passed the names and portraits of the elites of the major Sects to the hands of their disciples. This way, it was possible to avoid provoking such people.

Therefore, even if the three have never met Xiao Chen himself, they would still know who he was.

Seeing Xiao Chen beckoning him at this moment, the short man’s heartbeat was like a drum. Although he was also in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, the same as Xiao Chen, he knew that if they were to fight against each other, he would be beheaded by Xiao Chen in an instant.

This was the difference between their cultivation heritage and Secret Techniques.

Despite his extreme reluctance, the short man flew slowly to Xiao Chen and Lan Xun, with an ugly smile on his face, he cupped his fists. “Benevolent Martial Sect’s Jing Li greets Senior Xiao. May I ask what Senior Xiao requests of me? This One here will obey your orders!”

This short man named Jing Li gave a low bow. He was a lot older than Xiao Chen, and his cultivation was the same as Xiao Chen; however, it was more comfortable to address Xiao Chen as ‘Senior.’
