Chapter 1787, I’ll Accompany You

“That’s right boy, obediently take out all the things you’ve collected, throw them on the ground, kneel down and kowtow a few times to admit your mistakes and this old master swears that once this damned light dissipates, he will spare your life!” Xu Wei also yelled from the side.

The two Origin Kings had lost a great deal of face this time, so their hatred for Yang Kai ran very deep, but fortunately for the two of them, the Seven Coloured Radiant Light was about to withdraw. After enduring half an hour of taunting from Yang Kai, they would finally be able to make him pay the price, causing both to feel jovial.

Once the Seven Coloured Radiant Light retreated, what did it matter if Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space or not?

As soon they used their Domains to lock him down, he could not escape no matter what!

As long as they captured Yang Kai, not only could they solve the hatred in their hearts, they could also obtain the Enlightenment Flowers, Seeking Heart Lotus, and Heavenly Infant Grass that had been collected by Yang Kai.

They had both been secretly looking forward to this moment.

“You think you’ve won already?” Yang Kai looked at Zi Long and Xu Wei with disdain, not showing any signs of panic, shocking the two Origin Kings. On the contrary, his expression was one of gloating, as if victory was in his hand.

Zi Long frowned, wondering if Yang Kai was bluffing or he really had something to rely on still.

“Little brat, what are you up to now? This old master advises you to obediently cooperate while you still have a chance to survive.” Xu Wei shouted in a deep voice.

“Laughable, there’s actually such an ignorant fool like you in this world,” Yang Kai laughed before suddenly saying in a bored tone. “Forget it. I have no more time to play with you. This Seven Coloured Radiant Light should retreat soon so I’ll be going on ahead, enjoy waiting here!”

Saying so, Yang Kai waved his hand goodbye.

“Go on ahead?” Zi Long frowned deeply, but soon he thought up a frightening possibility. Could this boy actually...

Before he finished his thoughts, his eyes bulged as he watched Yang Kai’s movements in shock, an expression of complete disbelief covering his face.

Zi Long saw Yang Kai turn around and step into the Void Crack behind him, disappearing from sight.

This boy entered the Void Crack!

Zi Long could not help drawing a sharp breath!

On the other side, Xu Wei’s jaw dropped. He seemed to be trying to say something, but no matter what, the words would not form. The look of shock on his face was no better than the one on Zi Long’s.

“He, he, he...” Zi Dong also called out incoherently, pointing in the direction of where Yang Kai disappeared, unable to form a complete sentence for quite some time.

“Brother Xu!” After a long time, Zi Long took a deep breath and with a gloomy expression called out, “It seems we’ve all underestimated his accomplishments in the Dao of Space.”

Xu Wei nodded and said with a serious expression, “En, unscrupulously rushing into a Void Crack, this brat’s attainments in the Dao of Space are simply unprecedented.”

“Brother Xu, you don’t need me to remind you how terrifying a cultivator who has mastered Space Force is. Right now, he is just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm boy, but if he manages to break through to the Origin King Realm in the future...”

“He won’t have a future. This old master won’t let him leave this place alive!” Xu Wei’s face filled with a sullen expression.

Zi Long nodded with satisfaction, “In that case, we’ll put aside our grievances for now and cooperate. This King will also try his best to find him and eliminate him here in this Severed World.”

Both were aware of just how terrifying Yang Kai’s future potential was and were rightfully frightened by it. They did not dare allow Yang Kai to continue to grow and made up their minds to kill him here in the Severed World.

A few words were all they needed to negotiate a temporary alliance.

At that moment, Zi Dong, who had not been able to calm his mind, suddenly exclaimed as he pointed behind Xu Wei and shouted, “He, he...”

Zi Long was startled, turned his head, and looked towards Xu Wei. In the next moment, his eyes shrunk as he shouted, “Watch out!”

Hearing this shout, Xu Wei rapidly reacted, but before he could turn to look back, a familiar voice that filled his heart with disgust called out, “Hahahaha, little grandson, grandpa is here to teach you a lesson!”

It was Yang Kai!

Xu Wei’s expression changed drastically. He had never imagined Yang Kai would appear from the Void Crack behind him and launch a sneak attack.

A scorching force struck at him from behind, accompanied by a strong wind.

Xu Wei roared as he furiously condensed his Saint Qi on his back, forming a thick protective layer while at the same time he hurriedly tried to turn around and face.

His movements were quick, but Yang Kai was faster.

Just as his Saint Qi began to condense, Xu Wei felt a fist impact his back with such terrifying force it almost shredded his Saint Qi defences.

Fortunately, his cultivation was higher than Yang Kai’s, otherwise, this punch alone would have been enough to render him powerless.

Even so, this punch was not easy to withstand. Xu Wei felt his blood roil and his face could not help turning pale as his body staggered forward involuntarily.

What’s more, right in front of him was the Seven Coloured Radiant Light that everyone present dreaded!

“Not good!” Xu Wei exclaimed as cold sweat leaked from his forehead. Instinctively, Xu Wei released his Domain and bit his tongue before spitting out a mouthful of Blood Essence as he stamped his feet hard on the ground.

In an instant, his legs sank all the way to his knees into the ground and his body stopped lurching forward.

*Chi chi...*

A harsh cracking sound rang out as a look of desperation filled Xu Wei’s face.

Although his response was not slow, and his actions had been well executed, he still couldn’t completely stop his forward momentum, and one of his arms entered the Seven Coloured Radiant Light. In an instant, a stinging pain filled his arm and looking down, Xu Wei clearly saw his flesh being corroded at an extremely frightening speed, exposing his meridians and bones.

Things had not ended yet though as Yang Kai, who was standing behind him, was already preparing to launch a second blow.

Feeling Yang Kai’s thick murderous intent, Xu Wei was furious and grit his teeth while roaring, “Little Brat, don’t look down on this old master!”

Saying so, a dazzling light burst from his body and, together with a grating sound, terrifying waves of energy burst from his figure and spread out in all directions.

Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became dignified as he realized that Xu Wei had become desperate and was going all out. Quickly withdrawing his attack, Yang Kai rapidly retreated while at the same time summoning his Golden Blood Threads to condense a golden shield in front of himself.

*Dang dang dang dang...*

A series of metallic noises rang out as Yang Kai’s golden shield trembled.

Looking at Xu Wei, who was only a few steps in front of him, Yang Kai sneered slightly and did not continue his assault, instead choosing to jump back into the Void Crack.

The moment his figure was about to disappear, cold words entered the ears of Zi Long and Zi Dong, “I’ll be hiding in The Void and accompanying you from now on so you won’t be lonely.”

Hearing this, Zi Dong felt a chill fill him from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. In a flurry, he turned around and stared at the Void Crack behind him, his eyes wide.

He was terrified Yang Kai would appear suddenly and try to kill him.

Yang Kai’s existence had become a nightmare to him!

“Ahhh!” On the other side, Xu Wei’s screams rang out. At this moment, the terrifying Seven Coloured Radiant Light had eroded half of his arm and was rapidly spreading towards his shoulder.

Grinding his teeth, a savage look appeared on Xu Wei’s face as he desperately urged his Saint Qi to resist the damage caused by the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.

But no matter how he tried, everything was futile.

Seeing that the situation was getting worse and worse, Xu Wei mercilessly chopped at his shoulder.

What remained of his arm fell to the ground as blood splashed from the fresh wound.

As the pain hit, Xu Wei’s face went as pale as paper and his figure staggered slightly. Hurriedly using his Saint Qi to staunch the flow of blood, Xu Wei took out a few high-grade healing pills from his Space Ring and stuffed them into his mouth.

But he did not even dare to sit down cross-legged to refine these pills and immediately turned around and stared vigilantly at the Void Crack to guard against Yang Kai, just like Zi Dong.

Although Yang Kai’s sneak attack failed to kill him, it had cost Xu Wei an arm. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The atmosphere became extremely solemn, and whether it was Xu Wei or Zi Dong, none of them dared to even breathe heavily, their nerves as tight as could be.

Even Zi Long did not dare relax his guard, focusing his Divine Sense on the Void Crack behind him...

Time passed slowly.

When the sound of inhalation came from the depths of the medicine valley, and the Seven Coloured Radiant Light dissipated like a tide, Zi Dong gasped for breath, as if he had just been saved from death, and he immediately fled from the Void Crack to a relatively safe place.

The same was true for Xu Wei.

He had been bitten by a snake once and was now frightened of even ropes. Every time he glanced towards a Void Crack, it was as if he saw that bastard just waiting to leap out and attack him.

However, even if Seven Coloured Radiant Light had withdrawn, and there was now no need to worry about Yang Kai’s sneak attack, Xu Wei’s crisis had not ended.

With a pale face, he stood on the spot, watching Zi Long not far away vigilantly, his Saint Qi condensed as he stood ready to escape at any time.

Although he and Zi Long had reached a kind of agreement just now to deal with Yang Kai together, Xu Wei was well aware of the hatred between Abandoned Lair and Purple Star as well as the gap in status and strength between him and Zi Long.

If Zi Long acted against him now, Xu Wei was certain it would be disastrous for him.

At his peak, he might have been able to escape from Zi Long’s clutches, but in his current state... it would be nearly impossible!

“Brother Xu, this King advises you not to think about running away!” Zi Long looked at him faintly, “You should know something about this King’s Purple Qi Eternal River Secret Art. With this King’s means, you have no hope of escaping.”

Xu Wei smiled miserably while cursing in his heart how his worst fears had come true.

Zi Long obviously intended to add insult to injury here and had no intentions of letting him go. If he tried to escape now, Zi Long would attack.
