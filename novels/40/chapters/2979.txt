It took Yang Kai a full two hours to get rid of the Cold Qi that had invaded his meridians and body. When he finally opened his eyes, he saw Zhu Lie standing still to one side. Although Zhu Qing was safe and sound, she was helping the little black dog get rid of the cold, so who knows how long it would take.

Sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, Zhu Qing looked up and assured, “It’s alright, it just needs time.”

Yang Kai lightly nodded; he wasn’t surprised.

Since the little black dog had awoken its Abyssal Returner Bloodline, his vitality had become extremely tenacious. Earlier their team was able to climb so far up Yin Wind Mountain all thanks to it. At that altitude, even Yang Kai and Zhu Qing couldn’t do any better.

So, as soon as Yang Kai noticed that it couldn’t hold on, he immediately pulled back with Zhu Qing.

Strictly speaking, the little black dog was not very strong as it had been emanating the aura of a Fifth or Sixth-Order Monster Beast from beginning to end. Monster Beasts of this Order could be found just about everywhere in the Star Boundary.

But it wasn’t any ordinary Fifth or Sixth-Order Monster Beast that could deal with ten Emperors alone, swallow a Demon King alive, or swallow the Yin Wind that was even giving Yang Kai and Zhu Qing a hard time, taking Yang Kai and the others much farther up Yin Wind Mountain.

The distinction between Order and strength seemed completely meaningless to the little black dog. It could be strong or weak. When it was weak, it looked completely harmless and innocent, but when it was strong, it could make a thousand men flee from it.

If the Zhu Qing sister and brother duo couldn’t withstand the Yin Winds, Yang Kai likely couldn’t either.

Then again, if it was so easy to leave the Revolving World, some from Human Imperial City would have left long ago.

For the time being, they could only start with Ah Wang.

Yang Kai turned his head, glancing in the direction of Demon Fury City, frowning for a moment to ponder before speaking, “Qing’er, I’m heading back.”

Before Zhu Qing could say anything, his figure rose into the air before flying away.

After a short while, Yang Kai suddenly felt that someone was approaching him from behind. He looked back and saw Zhu Lie quickly chasing after him with a solemn look on his face.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes before slowing down, and when Zhu Lie finally caught up, he let out a snort and stated, “You actually want to kill me? You’ve got guts, I have to hand it to you.”

Of course, Yang Kai wasn’t just speaking randomly. Although Zhu Lie had a serious look on his face, devoid of any murderous intent whatsoever, when Yang Kai was meditating before, healing his wounds, he had noticed killing intent rising in Zhu Lie’s heart.

The killing intent was very well hidden, but there were only Zhu Qing and Li Jiao there besides Zhu Lie.

Zhu Qing was his Elder Sister, so it was naturally impossible for him to hold murderous intent toward her, and if it was towards Li Jiao, Zhu Lie would have already killed him. He had no qualms about it at all.

What did it matter if an honourable Dragon Clan member killed a human? If he wanted to kill, Zhu Lie would kill. Who could punish him anyway?

So, at that moment, there was only one person who could bring out the murderous intent in Zhu Lie’s heart but not have him act on it. Yang Kai knew it for sure. Before, Zhu Lie didn’t want to reveal it before Zhu Qing, but now, there was naturally no need to hide it.

An enemy hiding in the dark was the most difficult to deal with. When the tricks and conspiracies were out in the open, such enemies were far easier to handle.

“Since you know it, there is no point hiding it,” Zhu Lie frankly admitted. After all, when one’s cultivation had reached their realm, some things couldn’t remain hidden once they were revealed. He then continued, maintaining a stoic face, “Yes, I want to kill you. If possible, I would have already killed you.”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold, but he didn’t stop. He rather flew side by side with Zhu Lie, maintaining a delicate distance between the two, and demanded in a cold voice, “You better give me an explanation, otherwise even if you are Zhu Qing’s brother, I won’t forgive you.”

If it was before, he wouldn’t have cared about Zhu Lie’s murderous intentions toward him; after all, the two were total strangers before, but things were different now. With his relationship with Zhu Qing, the two had some connections no matter how much they vehemently denied it. If Zhu Lie was doing this for no reason, Yang Kai wouldn’t tolerate it.

A small fight with Zhu Lie was nothing, but if it was a true life and death battle, it would be devastating for Zhu Qing. Yang Kai didn’t want to see that kind of situation, so he needed to get to the bottom of this quickly.

Zhu Lie grit his teeth and replied, “I want to kill you because I am her brother.”

“What kind of dumb logic is that?” Yang Kai stared at him.

“You don’t understand. The reason I came here was just to tell you that if we can leave this world, it would be best for you to stay away from Zhu Qing and never reveal your relationship with her. Of course… if we can’t leave this palace, then treat it as if you didn’t hear anything.”

He had a completely serious look on his face, like if Yang Kai didn’t agree, he would fight it out with him.

Yang Kai was immediately angered and cursed, “Damned brat, it’s not your place to meddle in this. If Zhu Qing has anything to say, she will naturally tell me.”

Zhu Lie lashed out, “It’s because Zhu Qing can’t speak that I have to on her behalf!”

Yang Kai swept his eyes over him and asked, narrowing his eyes, “In what capacity are you speaking, are you speaking as a member of Dragon Island’s Dragon Clan, or as Zhu Qing’s brother?”

Zhu Lie quickly said, “Does it matter?”

“Yes, it does!” Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile as he replied, tightening his fists, “If it’s former, I’ll beat you up, and if it’s latter, I’ll still beat you up.”

Zhu Lie angrily shouted, “Are you messing with me?”

Yang Kai coldly looked at him, “There are differences in beatings. A light punishment and beating to death aren’t the same. Which one do you prefer?”

Zhu Lie earnestly shook his head, “I don’t want to argue with you. I only have one request, if and when we get out of this world, you should part ways with Zhu Qing. That would be best for you and for her.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

For a Dragon, speaking the word ‘request’ was already their limit. How could the arrogant Dragon Clan, who were famous for their pride, lower themselves to request anything of anyone? Had Zhu Lie not been Yang Kai’s opponent, Zhu Lie would have already ended all troubles by force, why bother speaking so much nonsense?

Yang Kai slowly heaved a sigh and continued, “I can tell that you are concerned about Zhu Qing, but your concerns are misplaced. I’m sorry, I can’t agree to your request, let alone consider it. Zhu Qing is my woman, she is mine today, will remain mine tomorrow, and will remain mine forever, unless I die someday. Understand?”

Zhu Lie stated with a stoic face, “If Zhu Qing came to hear your sweet words, she would definitely be very happy.”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, “I’m only speaking my mind.”

“Unfortunately, you will be the end of Zhu Qing, and yourself.”

Yang Kai, treading the thin air and riding the wind, spoke with a smile, “Do you want to tell me that I am a Human, and Zhu Qing is a member of Dragon Clan, so the Dragon Clan will never allow her to be with me? If word of our relationship got out, it would only cause great trouble, that’s what you want to say, right?”

“You do understand!” Zhu Lie slightly furrowed his brow.

“I have been calling you stupid, but you just don’t want to admit it,” Yang Kai sneered, “How backwards Dragon Island is, I can infer a little from your stupidity. It would be stranger if Dragon Island allowed Zhu Qing to be with me. If the news about Zhu Qing staying with me is really sent back to Dragon Island, I’m afraid Dragon Island will send many more of your Dragons to attack me. Perhaps Dragon Island would forcibly take Zhu Qing back to punish her, imprisoning her for the remainder of her life.”

“Zhu Qing told you?” Zhu Lie was completely dumbfounded because Yang Kai had said exactly what he was expecting.

A high and mighty Ninth-Order Red Dragon actually willingly gave herself to a lowly Human; once this news was sent back to Dragon Island, it would definitely cause an uproar. Dragon Island would definitely send Masters to deal with Yang Kai and forcefully take Zhu Qing back. As to whether she would be imprisoned for life, it would depend on Zhu Qing’s performance in the future.

Yang Kai grinned as he pointed to his head, “Anyone can guess such a simple thing after giving it a little bit of thought. Your Dragon Island has such a long heritage, and the older one’s heritage is, the more pedantic they are; with higher reputation comes higher self-esteem. So, how can you agree to your clansmen willingly giving herself to a Human? Isn’t that a disgrace to your Dragon Clan? It’s an even worse insult than shitting on your head.”

“It’s the truth,” Zhu Lie repeatedly nodded, “Since you know this, why are you still being stubborn?”

“You know that I can kill you at will, but do you know why you are still alive?” Yang Kai looked at him with naked contempt.

Zhu Lie was stunned, feeling that there was some truth to this, but there seemed to be something wrong about it too.

Yang Kai continued after a snort, “I don’t have many merits, but I do like to cover my friends’ and family’s shortcomings. Zhu Qing is already my woman, so if Dragon Island really tries to bully her, don’t blame me for not showing any affection to my in-laws. So, don’t do similar things in the future. Besides, you and I are both close to her, any conflict between us will be difficult for her. I don’t think you want to see that, alright?”

Zhu Lie frowned but nodded his agreement, only to then shake his head. He had no idea whether to agree or not.

Yang Kai added, “Then again, only Li Jiao and you are aware of the matter between Zhu Qing and me. If you don’t report it to Dragon Island, how will Dragon Island know about it?”

Zhu Lie solemnly stated, “How can I not report a matter of this much importance?”

“People who like to report everything are most annoying!” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

“You can say anything you want, but those are my principles. Zhu Qing and you have broken Dragon Island’s laws. If I know it and don’t report it, the matter will only get worse.”

“You really can’t hide it?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

Zhu Lie firmly shook his head in refusal.

“I will remember this,” Yang Kai coldly harrumphed.

“You don’t understand,” Zhu Lie sighed. “Although Dragon Island has a huge reputation and a long inheritance, the population of my Dragon Clan is very small in any era, and a Great Dragon with a pure bloodline is even more precious. In order to ensure the continuation of the Dragon Clan’s bloodline inheritance, Dragon Island has its own rules, and anyone who violates those rules must pay a heavy price.”

Yang Kai smiled lightly and leisurely replied, remaining noncommittal, “Although Dragon Island’s inheritance seems eternal, it will not last forever. As the waves of time crash upon the shore, all things are worn away, not even Dragon Island is an exception.”
