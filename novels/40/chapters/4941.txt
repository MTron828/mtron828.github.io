“Please come closer to me!” Yang Kai shouted.

Feng Ying and the others looked at each other, wondering what kind of bottle gourd medicine he was peddling, but they were influenced by his calm confidence and quickly gathered around him.

“No matter what happens, do not circulate your strength,” he added in warning.

They glanced at the Black Ink Territory Lord, who was fast approaching them and their faces twitched at the sight. The Territory Lord was almost upon them, so wouldn’t they be courting death if they didn’t even try to defend themselves?

“Little Brother, are you confident?” Ning Qi Zhi asked in a whisper, his fist clenched tightly, revealing the anxiety in his heart.

“Don’t worry, Senior. I will not joke around with my own life,” Yang Kai responded lightly while staring fixedly ahead. His statement was the truth as nobody would joke around with their life on the line. Even so, the fact that Yang Kai refused to tell them anything in advance made them very anxious.

Meanwhile, the Territory Lord approached relentlessly. It was obvious that he had noticed the abnormality up ahead. The Human cultivators who suddenly halted in their tracks made him suspicious and wary, and he couldn’t help wondering whether there was a trap waiting for him; however, his powerful perception did not detect any traces of a trap.

Annoyance flared in his heart, [How dare they make a fool of me when they are on the verge of death!?]

His hand reached out to grab at something in front of him. His Black Ink Strength surged violently and gathered into a cloud that took the shape of a gigantic palm. Following that, a majestic aura loomed over Feng Ying and the others in an oppressive manner.

Feng Ying and the others couldn’t help feeling nervous. Moreover, they nearly activated their powers on instinct to defend against the attack. At that very moment though, a strange and mysterious energy fluctuation poured out from Yang Kai’s body to wrap around the others in an instant. In the next moment, the world spun dizzyingly!

This was a feeling that was both familiar and unfamiliar to them. It felt familiar because they had experienced similar situations many times throughout their lives. On the other hand, it felt unfamiliar because they had not experienced this feeling since they arrived at the Black Ink Battlefield.

By the time they came back to their senses, they discovered that they were standing in a completely different part of the void. The Territory Lord, who was approaching them aggressively, was nowhere to be seen. Not to mention, they did not see a single Black Ink Clansman nearby when they turned to look around.

Feng Ying stared at Yang Kai in a mixture of amazement and doubt, “A Space Technique?”

The feeling just now was very similar to her experience when she activated the Universe Transference Law with the help of the Universe Temples in the 3,000 Worlds a long time ago. If not for that, she would not have made such a guess. What’s more, a strange energy fluctuation had come out of Yang Kai’s body right before that phenomenon. Looking back at it now, that was clearly the fluctuation of Space Principles.

On the other hand, Ning Qi Zhi hurriedly took out his Universe Chart and checked their current position. After he confirmed their location, he looked absolutely stunned.

In an instant, they had travelled several tens of millions of kilometres. Their current location was clearly somewhere they passed some time ago, the very spot where Yang Kai first suggested to Feng Ying that they flee to the rear in fact. In other words, they had travelled from deep within the Black Ink Clan hinterland to this spot in the blink of an eye. In addition, the Black Ink Clan chasing them relentlessly had been left far behind.

[How did he do it!?]

“This Junior is proficient in the Dao of Space.” Faced with the suspicious looks from the other four, Yang Kai was forced to provide a brief explanation.

Shen Ao could barely believe his ears, “I’ve heard of what Masters of the Dao of Space can do, but to travel over such a great distance in the blink of an eye… That’s difficult to believe.”

The corners of Qi Tai Chu’s brow twitched, “That’s right. If you had such means, then why were we fleeing all this time? You should have just brought us back directly!”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and elaborated, “That’s impossible. What I did just now required the help of an artifact. That is why I was able to bring you back here directly. I don’t have an artifact at the great pass to act as a beacon, so I am unable to return there directly.”

The others did not fully understand his explanation or what artifact he was referring to either, but they understood one thing. If he had the ability to bring them back directly, he would not have taken such risks in the first place.

At the same time, they also understood why he had warned them not to use their strength earlier. It was because he planned to cast the Space Technique and transport them across the Void. If an external power had interfered with his technique, then there was a high chance that it would have failed. It was fortunate that they had forcibly held back under the threat of the Black Ink Territory Lord; otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.

“Now that we have shaken the enemy off our tail, we should not be in danger for the time being. But, we should hurry up and leave as soon as possible,” Yang Kai said with a glance at Feng Ying.

Feng Ying suppressed the astonishment in her eyes and nodded, “You’re right.”

Without taking the time to recover their strength, they sped towards the front lines at a high speed.

Along the way, the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would turn to look at Yang Kai from time to time as though trying to spot something on his face. He had given them many unexpected surprises during this short period. They never imagined that he would pull out another surprise at that moment.

The Dao of Space was extremely profound. What’s more, it was very difficult for ordinary people to cultivate. Although they did not know how deep Yang Kai’s attainments were in the Dao of Space, judging from the phenomenon just now, they could ascertain that his accomplishments were not low. It would have been impossible for him to do such things otherwise.

Ning Qi Zhi leaned towards Yang Kai and whispered, “Little Brother, what other abilities are you hiding? Why don’t you tell us now so that we can mentally prepare ourselves and prevent your actions from catching us off guard again?”

Yang Kai burst into laughter, “That’s too much, Senior. This Junior is only in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. How can I have any hidden abilities?”

Ning Qi Zhi spat disdainfully, “Dishonest brat!”

There were many Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters on the Black Ink Battlefield, but they had never met such a unique Sixth-Order Master before. It was just as Feng Ying had wondered in the past. How did somebody like Yang Kai end up in the depths of the Black Ink Clan’s territory? Logically speaking, it was impossible for him to become corrupted by the Black Ink or be captured by them.

Whilst travelling, they quietly recovered their strength. Everybody knew that a deadly and desperate battle was waiting for them up ahead. At this time, the slightest extra bit of power could affect the entire battle situation. That was why they made haste to recuperate.

After repeating this cycle for more than ten days, a majestic structure entered Yang Kai’s field of vision. Even though he was only looking at the structure from a distance, he could clearly sense its enormity. Like a huge city that stood in the middle of the void, the structure was completely made of metal that gleamed with a cold light. At a rough estimate, it was at least 1,000 kilometres in length and breadth.

When he set eyes upon this majestic structure, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling a slight sense of awe. Although he had always known that the Cave Heavens and Paradises had been guarding these great passes for countless years, he never expected the great pass to be so enormous. Moreover, if his guess was correct, the great pass itself was an extremely extraordinary object.

Turning to look at Feng Ying, Yang Kai interrupted, “Senior, is the great pass a kind of Mobile Palace Artifact?”

Feng Ying glanced at him suspiciously. Her expression seemed confused, as though wondering why he only learned about this now. Nevertheless, she explained, “That’s right. Every single great pass protected by the Cave Heavens and Paradises on the Black Ink Battlefield is a Mobile Palace Artifact. They were refined through an extraordinary amount of time and resources. That is the only method to prevent the Black Ink Clan from invading the 3,000 Worlds.”

Although he had some guesses, Yang Kai couldn’t help gulping nervously when he heard her explanation.

Such an enormous Mobile Palace Artifact was simply beyond his imagination. How many resources had been required to build this Mobile Palace Artifact? It had to be said that the average great force in the 3,000 Worlds was not qualified to possess their own Mobile Palace Artifact because the cost was so high that they simply could not afford one. Only the top Second Class great forces, Cave Heavens, and Paradises could afford to refine their own Mobile Palace Artifacts.

Be that as it may, comparing those Mobile Palace Artifacts with the great pass in front of him was like comparing the light from a firefly with the bright full moon.

Judging by the scale of this great pass, it was not something that was constructed in a day, or a year, or even a millennium. The structure was probably built little by little over an immeasurable amount of time; otherwise, it was impossible to reach such an impressive scale.

Taking out his Universe Chart and checking his current position, Yang Kai discovered that the great pass in front of him was the Blue Sky Pass!

Feng Ying came from Blue Sky Paradise; in other words, Blue Sky Pass was the great pass guarded by Blue Sky Paradise.

After so many years, Shen Ao and the others couldn’t help feeling emotional at the sight of the great pass. They never imagined that they would one day come back to this place as part of the Human Race.

Although they followed the Black Ink Clan onto the battlefield several times in the past, they had been part of the Black Ink Clan’s army and the enemy of the Human Race at the time. They also slaughtered many of their clansmen with their own hands. Upon recalling those memories now, they were absolutely heartbroken.

“With such a magnificent weapon, what is there to fear about the Black Ink Clan?” Yang Kai took a deep breath and asked curiously, “Can anybody control this object?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Feng Ying shook her head in response, “It is far too large. Even the Old Ancestors are unable to control them freely. Be that as it may, we can operate most of its defensive and offensive abilities without any issue. The main problem is that we are unable to move the artifact; otherwise, the Old Ancestors would have mobilised these artifacts to invade the Black Ink Clan’s territory a long time ago.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Old Ancestors might be astoundingly powerful, but their strength was still not enough for them to mobilise such an enormous object on their own.

At this moment, Blue Sky Pass was enveloped in a tide-like pitch-black darkness. The Black Ink Clan was continuously attacking the great pass from all directions. Numerous dazzling beams of lights shot out from within the great pass, blasting directly into the middle of the Black Ink Clan army. Every attack was capable of turning the Black Ink Clan upside down.

There were also countless warships of different shapes and sizes shuttling across the battlefield, as well as innumerable figures fighting with the Black Ink Clan.

The battlefield was vast, and the situation varied from place to place. Some places had intense battles while others were relatively calm.

Yang Kai took in everything before him, feeling agitated by the sights. He was tempted to charge straight into the battlefield to support his allies. Be that as it may, he knew that his individual strength was insignificant in this environment. It was not realistic to break through the Black Ink Clan army’s blockade with his strength alone. At this moment, it remained necessary for him to work with Feng Ying and the others.

“Which way should we go?” Shen Ao asked.

“Let’s wait for now.” Feng Ying was closely monitoring the movement across the entire battlefront. There were approximately 300 people on their side, a force that was neither large nor small. They might not be able to change the situation across the entire battlefield, but they could influence the trend of the smaller battles. That was why they had to act cautiously.

Their wait lasted for two or three days. Fortunately, they were not a large target, so they did not attract the attention of the Black Ink Clan as they quietly hid in the distance.
