“Greetings, Grandma You!” Gao Xue Ting wore a serious expression as she cupped her fists towards the newly appeared figure.

Yang Kai and the others also hurriedly turned towards this newcomer and quickly discovered that Grandma You was surprisingly short, only reaching about the height of Yang Kai’s chest, and had a crooked back while she supported herself with a staff. She appeared to be really weak and doddering.

Meanwhile, the word ugly wouldn’t do Grandma You’s face any justice. Her entire face was filled with pits and blemishes. The invasion of time had left countless wrinkles upon her face, and there were even many age spots on her face, making it seem like she didn’t have long left to live.

Only her green eyes shone with energy. Everyone felt like their hair stood on end when they met her eyes.

The first word that everyone thought of was the word ‘vicious’ to describe such eyes and appearance...

Murong Xiao Xiao’s pretty face was already paling slightly as she didn’t have as much courage as the others, but even the men present wore expressions of discomfort.

However, none of them dared be impolite since Grandma You was right in front of them, all of them cupping their fists, “Greetings, Senior.”

Grandma You nodded lightly without indicating much else, simply glancing around while using an almost suffocating Divine Sense to scan their bodies.

Yang Kai was truly shocked as he stared at this old lady in front of him.

This was because he discovered that her Divine Sense was actually inconceivably strong. Even Aunt Feng, whom he met before, couldn’t compare to Grandma You.

Aunt Feng was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, someone on par with Wen Zi Shan.

However, this Grandma You’s aura was nowhere near the Third-Order Emperor Realm. According to Yang Kai’s experience, he estimated that she was just a First-Order Emperor!

In other words, even though this old lady was only at the First-Order Emperor Realm, her Divine Sense was as powerful as a Third-Order Emperor. It was unknown whether this was due to her own natural talent, or if it was related to how she constantly guarded the Divine Ascension Mirror.

Yang Kai secretly felt that the latter possibility was more likely, since according to Wen Zi Shan, the greatest use of the Divine Ascension Mirror was to strengthen a cultivator’s Soul.

Since Grandma You always stayed here in order to guard the Divine Ascension Mirror, she must have obtained tremendous benefits from this miraculous treasure as well.

“Oh,” Grandma You actually focused her gaze on Yang Kai after scanning everyone, as if she had noticed something, cackling strangely as she exclaimed, “An interesting little guy appeared...”

Gao Xue Ting glanced at Yang Kai and furrowed her brow slightly, but didn’t say anything in the end.

As for Grandma You, she didn’t say anything else about Yang Kai and instead just stated in her piercing voice, “The others are just passable!”

Gao Xue Ting cupped her fists and said, “I’ll be troubling Grandma to take them into the Divine Ascension Mirror.”

“Hmph, that little bastard Wen Zi Shan, he only knows how to order this old lady around!” Grandma You suddenly shouted angrily after hearing this.

Yang Kai and the others were truly stunned as they stared in disbelief at the old lady in front of them.

No matter what, Wen Zi Shan was still the Temple Master of Azure Sun Temple. Since this Grandma You had taken the job of guarding this Restricted Area, then she was obviously someone from the temple as well. A cultivator from the temple actually dared to be so rude and call the Temple Master a ‘little bastard’ right in front of so many people...

This seemed off no matter how everyone thought about it.

However, after Grandma You finished cursing Wen Zi Shan, she turned her head and used her sharp gaze to stare at everyone as she viciously exclaimed, “What’s wrong? That bastard trapped me here yet I’m not even allowed to curse at him? Do you have any objections?

Everyone hurriedly shook their heads in unison, feeling that this sentence contained a lot of information...

Meanwhile, Gao Xue Ting arched her brow and mentioned, “Grandma, you’re here simply because of a bet between you and the Temple Master, so why...”

“What do you know!?” Grandma You’s temper was as bad as Yang Kai had expected. After she finished cursing Wen Zi Shan, she got angry at Gao Xue Ting as her expression became warped, “Back then, you were nothing more than a little brat, so what would you know? That bastard Wen Zi Shan, if it wasn’t for me not being able to beat him, I long would have ripped his corpse into ten thousand pieces already...”

She seemed to recall a really unpleasant memory, causing her to constantly curse as she kept banging her staff on the ground, causing the entire stone cavern to echo loudly.

Yang Kai and the others stood where they were as their hearts trembled in fear, worried this old lady would go crazy and attack them.

With her powerful Divine Sense that was on par if not stronger than a Third-Order Emperor’s, if she did attack without warning, Gao Xue Ting might not be able to protect them.

Luckily, even though Grandma You was incredibly furious, she hadn’t reached the point of losing logic and reason, so she suddenly stopped speaking after she cursed for a while, stood in place, and panted loudly, as if she had become tired.

Gao Xue Ting also wore a difficult expression as she forced herself to be patient, not daring to interrupt Grandma You’s ranting. Only once the latter seemed to finish cursing did Gao Xue Ting speak again, “Grandma, we should first send them in.”

“I know!” Grandma You responded impatiently as she turned to look at Gao Xue Ting, “Are you also entering this time?”

Gao Xue Ting answered, “I am.”

“En, then each of you go find a stone room!” Grandma You then suddenly pointed to the front with her staff.

Yang Kai and the others looked where she was pointing and only then noticed that all around the mystical Divine Ascension Mirror were man-made stone rooms, each one with a door and a token hanging upon it.

At a rough count, there were approximately ten or so stone rooms that enveloped the Divine Ascension Mirror in a semicircular formation.

Gao Xue Ting spoke up to explain, “I think that you should all know how to enter the Divine Ascension Mirror already. It’s a place where only one’s Soul Avatar can enter, so our physical bodies will be unable to move later. Temple Master personally created these stone rooms, so while your Soul Avatars are exploring the Divine Ascension Mirror, your safety will be ensured as long as the barriers on these stone rooms are activated. Without the barrier token, or the Temple Master personally acting, no one can destroy those stone rooms or damage your physical bodies.”

Everyone nodded in understanding after hearing this.

“All this to guard against me!” Grandma You coldly snorted in dissatisfaction and chuckled wickedly, “Since he can’t relax with me here, why didn’t he just kill me back then? Why did he instead force me to guard this Restricted Area...”

She kept talking to herself, but everyone ignored her.

However, Yang Kai and the others knew that she was telling the truth.

Wen Zi Shan had specially created these stone rooms in order to protect the disciples whose Soul Avatars had entered the Divine Ascension Mirror against Grandma You.

Grandma You was someone who seemed very dangerous; after all, no one could tell just what she might do. What if she damaged their physical bodies while everyone was in the Divine Ascension Mirror? It was likely that everyone would then be stuck in the Divine Ascension Mirror for all eternity.

As Grandma You spoke, everyone found a stone room for themselves, took the token hanging on the door, and entered.

Gao Xue Ting didn’t rush to find a room for herself, however, and instead just stood where she was and explained to everyone about how to use the token.

Everyone soon learned the method to use their token and entered their own stone room, closing the door behind them and opening all the appropriate barriers.

After everyone finished, Gao Xue Ting finally chose an empty stone room and entered. Before she closed the door, she added, “We’ll be troubling you, Grandma!”

“No need for you to waste your breath!” was Grandma You’s response.

Gao Xue Ting didn’t say anything else as she also activated the barrier around her room and waited quietly.

A moment later, Grandma You supported herself on her staff as she went over to the Divine Ascension Mirror. Suddenly, she tossed her staff aside and opened up her arms. At the same time, a torrential amount of Spiritual Energy poured out of her forehead and was injected into the Divine Ascension Mirror.

She kept muttering something that sounded like an incantation, but upon listening more carefully, it didn’t sound like anything sensible at all.

As she made her movements, the Divine Ascension Mirror’s original faint flashes suddenly exploded with brilliant divine light.

Simultaneously, Yang Kai and the others who were sitting cross-legged in the stone rooms all became covered in the brilliant light. All of them felt something really discomforting in the light, as if their Souls were about to be sucked out of their bodies by it, a somewhat panic-inducing sensation.

However, none of them tried to resist, because this was an expected phenomenon. Every cultivator who entered the Divine Ascension Mirror would experience the same thing.

*Weng.....*

The Divine Ascension Mirror suddenly began flashing rapidly as a vortex appeared from it, covering everything in the surrounding cave. Sand and stones were kicked up and smashed into the stone rooms and cavern walls, causing many loud bangs. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

Six beams of light flew forth from six different stone rooms in the next instant and entered the Divine Ascension Mirror before vanishing.

At the same time, Yang Kai and the others’ figures flashed like lightning past the surface of the Divine Ascension Mirror.

“En?” Grandma You’s eyes suddenly lit up as she was channelling her Spiritual Energy. It seemed like she noticed something as she stared at the Divine Ascension Mirror and soon exclaimed, “Impossible! That’s impossible! One of those brats actually possesses such a precious treasure? Did I see incorrectly?”

She then clasped her hands and viciously slapped out.

The flashing Divine Ascension Mirror immediately stabilized itself and resumed its original appearance.

However, Grandma You’s face was quite pale and her forehead was dripping with sweat. Her originally short body seemed even shorter now, as if this activation had used up a tremendous amount of her energy.

“Damn it, damn it all! Wen Zi Shan, you left me alive only because activating the Divine Ascension Mirror requires the Divine Sense of a Third-Order Emperor! Don’t think that I don’t know about your evil intentions! This old lady will make you pay the price sooner or later!”

After saying this, she hurriedly sat down cross-legged and shakily took out some Spirit Pills from her Space Ring and popped them into her mouth as if they were candy.

“No matter if I saw wrongly or not, I must go in and check for myself! If that really is the item I saw, Wen Zi Shan, this is your end! Haha... hahahaha...” She began to laugh out loud in a crazed manner after speaking like a madman to herself.

At the same moment, Wen Zi Shan was looking into the distance from Myriad Saints Peak.

Chen Qian was by his side.

Once the Third-Order Emperor Realm Spiritual Energy fluctuations died down, Chen Qian muttered, “It seems that Sister Gao and the others have entered now.”

“En,” Wen Zi Shan nodded, “Everything was successful.”

“Temple Master!” Chen Qian suddenly turned to look at Wen Zi Shan, “This subordinate doesn’t understand something.”
