Above King City, the seventy-five Giant Eagles and the Eagle King were soaring high in the sky, their wings spread wide. On the back of each Giant Eagle sat an archer, who clung onto the feathers on the eagle’s back with a pale face. Some even vomited up in the air, but they held on and did not give up.

They were not Shamans, and they had never experienced the thrill of being up so high, so they were not used to riding Giant Eagles in the sky.

However, the Ancient Barbarian Race was tough and had strong adaptability, so as long as they were given a few more days, they should be able to get used to this.

This was Yang Kai’s Aerial Cavalry, while Ah Hua, who was born in Blue South Village, was the Aerial Cavalry Captain.

Yang Kai did not appoint Ah Hua as the Aerial Cavalry Captain out of bias. It was through the competition between the archers. All the archers of the Barbarian Race were Spirit Archers with excellent eyesight, able to hit a mosquito’s wing from a kilometre away. Naturally, no one with such good abilities would want to live under others.

When the Aerial Cavalry was established, every Archer coveted the position of Captain. Yang Kai did not say much and just let them compete in archery. Whoever was the best would be the Aerial Cavalry Captain.

The archers Yang Kai carefully selected went out for a competition, and when they returned, Ah Hua came back with a proud look on her face, while everyone else looked obedient.

But at this moment, even Ah Hua, who was the Aerial Cavalry Captain, also could not withstand such flight training. Every time she came down from the sky, she would be paralyzed on the ground for a long time before she regained her composure.

Inside Yang Kai’s camp was a newly built wooden house. It was exceptionally rudimentary but was still sufficient to shelter them from the wind and rain.

At this moment, Yang Kai and Tiea were cultivating inside.

After slowly withdrawing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai lifted his head and commented, “Ah Hua and the others are improving really fast. They should be able to fight in two days.”

Tiea opened her eyes and glanced at him, “I don’t know what the Demon Race are like, but although the Aerial Cavalry can move fast, they are easy to spot. If the Demon Race has any long-range forces, I’m afraid this Aerial Cavalry won’t be of any use.”

Yang Kai gave a small smile, “Being able to investigate the enemy is their best use!”

At this time, the old Shaman Apprentice’s voice suddenly came from outside the house, “Sir Shaman Niu…”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai shouted with his face darkened, “Ask them to go away. I won’t see any of them!”

Since Yang Kai brought back seventy-five Giant Eagles and his Eagle King two days ago, the other Shaman Grandmasters had come to visit him one after another with enthusiasm, as if they had been good friends with Yang Kai for many years. They even prepared some small gifts for Yang Kai as a courtesy when they came.

Under normal circumstances, the gifts from a Shaman Grandmaster would not be common things. Nevertheless, Yang Kai was already immensely wealthy, so he had no interest in the gifts from these bumpkins.

After all the fuss, these Shaman Grandmasters slowly revealed their purpose.

They hoped that Yang Kai could share some Giant Eagles with them.

Everyone could see that these Giant Eagles were useful in investigating the enemy, so everyone wished to obtain some from Yang Kai.

Yang Kai naturally refused without showing the slightest politeness to their rude, shameless, and unreasonable demands.

Yang Kai had subdued the seventy-five Giant Eagles one by one and formed a small-scale Aerial Cavalry, which was just sufficient for his own army. It was not like he had any extra to spare, so why should he share with them after working so hard to catch them?

Despite being rejected, those Shaman Grandmasters did not give up easily. Some tried to reason with him, some tried to move him with sentiment, and some even tried to threaten him with force…

Without exception, all of them were thrown out of the wooden house by Yang Kai while those Shaman Grandmasters who intended to fight him had their faces bashed in.

This resulted in Yang Kai’s reputation turning extremely bad in the entire South Barbarian Clan. All the Shaman Grandmasters knew that this guy was selfish, had a bad temper, and refused to listen to others.

Even so, there were still many Shaman Grandmasters who visited him brazenly, hoping that Yang Kai would miraculously change his mind.

So, as soon as he heard the call from the old Shaman Apprentice outside, Yang Kai thought that it was another fool who wanted him to give up a few Giant Eagles, and he was instantly annoyed.

Instead of chit-chatting with them, it was better to spend time cultivating.

Suddenly, another familiar voice came from outside the door, “Sir Shaman Niu, it is Sir Shaman King who summons you!”

“Hmm?” Yang Kai was surprised and immediately got up to open the door. After seeing a familiar face, he could not help grinning, “It’s you!”

This guy was the Shaman Master messenger he met in Blue South Village before. Yang Kai did not know his name, but he remembered his honest face.

The Shaman Master replied with a smile, “Yeah, it is this subordinate.”

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn, “Sir Shaman King summoned me?”

The messenger nodded, “Yes!”

Yang Kai answered, “Let’s go then.”

On the way, Yang Kai asked the Shaman King messenger for the reason for his summon, but the messenger did not give him a clear answer. It was unknown whether he was hiding information or he really did not know anything about it. However, Yang Kai did not want to embarrass him, so he just chatted with him all the way, which flattered the messenger.

In recent days, Shaman Niu’s name had spread all over King City and everyone knew that this thin and weak looking Shaman Grandmaster was not someone to be trifled with. Within just a few days of coming to King City, this Shaman Niu had beaten two Shaman Grandmasters who were two Minor Realms stronger than him and had formed an Aerial Cavalry with the Giant Eagles as mounts. The seventy-five Giant Eagles hovered over King City from time to time, and lumps of their droppings would occasionally drop on the top of the people’s heads, which attracted much hatred from the residents of King City towards Shaman Niu. They wished that they could just find him and punch him until not even his mother could recognize him anymore.

The messenger was also a little nervous when he came, but after he met Yang Kai, he found that this guy was not as malicious as the rumours claimed him to be. Instead, he was quite amiable, which made him feel that the rumours were all wrong.

They walked and talked all the way, and soon entered King City where they met with Sixth Shaman King Dang in the palace!

“Greetings, Sir!” Yang Kai saluted with his hand on his chest, “May I know why Sir summoned me? Is there anything urgent?”

The Guard Captain who was standing nearby Shaman Dang eyed Yang Kai with a sharp glare, making Yang Kai feel like two blades were going to pierce into his mind and spy on the secrets he hid there.

Yang Kai frowned and glanced back at him, thinking that this guy was a bit messed up in the head. This warrior would stare at him like this every time he came, as if Yang Kai would harm Shaman Dang at any time.

Shaman Dang turned around and grinned, “Sit down and talk!”

“Many thanks, Sir!” Yang Kai retracted his gaze and accepted the invitation.

After that, he took a seat.

Shaman Dang continued kindly, “Actually, there’s nothing urgent, but I’ve heard some interesting stories recently.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

Shaman Dang returned a smile. He thought that Yang Kai would have asked what interesting stories he had heard, but unexpectedly, he did not say much other than an ‘oh’. Shaman Dang was left hanging, slightly embarrassed, so he could only cough lightly and press on, “I heard that you spent a lot to buy many weapons from the city to equip your soldiers?”

Yang Kai immediately put on a painful expression, “Sir Shaman King, this subordinate has spent all his wealth selflessly for this war. The wealth that this subordinate has accumulated his whole life has been drained. This subordinate is loyal to our Barbarian Race, and the Sun and the Moon as well as Heaven and Earth can bear witness to my pure intentions. It’s really hateful that those unscrupulous merchants are still charging me such a high price at this time, even twenty to thirty percent higher than usual! They are really the cancer of our Barbarian Race. Shame on them!”

He was so agitated that he spat his saliva everywhere as he spoke, revealing a look of grievance as if those shop owners were his enemies.

The corner of Shaman Dang’s mouth twitched slightly and he could not help sweeping his eyes over Yang Kai for a while, not knowing how to carry on the conversation now.

As a Shaman King, he had seen a lot, but it was his first time seeing such a reaction.

He had only said a single sentence but the other party already responded with many complaints. It was new for him to see Yang Kai being so talkative, which was… interesting.

Yang Kai suddenly turned solemn and whispered, “Did Sir Shaman King summon me to come here to punish those unscrupulous merchants? The Barbarian Race is in great danger now, but these profiteers not only didn’t try to help, but instead raised their prices on us. They have to be punished severely. If Sir Shaman King gives the order, this subordinate is willing to testify against them and ensure that none of them can escape. We must punish all of them to put a stop to all the malpractices in the businesses of our South Barbarian Clan.”

At this point, even the Guard Captain who had been standing there quietly could not stop his face from twitching slightly.

The Shaman King Dang had no choice but to wave his hand, “This King does not intend to do that. A deal is a deal. Moreover, you could have just rejected any unreasonable offers, so there’s nothing wrong with those businessmen.”

“Oh…” Yang Kai showed his disappointment, but soon his eyes lit up and continued, “Is Sir going to reimburse this subordinate for his expenses?”

“What?” Shaman Dang was stunned.

“Reimbursement!” Yang Kai looked at him seriously, “This subordinate has spent all his wealth and is penniless now. This subordinate cannot buy anything anymore even if it is needed. King City is rich, so is it possible…” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Impudence!” The Guard Captain finally lost his temper and reprimanded angrily, “How dare you talk nonsense in front of a Shaman King!?”

Yang returned a glance at him, then rolled his eyes, which truly boiled the Guard Captain’s blood.

Shaman Dang smiled helplessly. He realized that it was unrealistic to have small talk with Shaman Niu to bring them closer. Therefore, he could only go straight to the point, “Shaman Niu, actually, I have something to tell you.”

Yang Kai sat up properly, “You can say anything as long as it’s not about things in the sky!”

Shaman Dang replied, “It’s exactly about things in the sky.”

Yang Kai immediately looked aggrieved, “What? Even King City is aiming for my Aerial Cavalry? Sir Shaman King, what’s wrong with all of you?”

He already felt suspicious before arriving here; after all, he just met Shaman Dang a few days ago. If there was going to be an immediate outbreak of war, he would not just summon Yang Kai alone. Therefore, the only thing that could attract a Shaman King’s attention would be those Giant Eagles.

Perhaps, this trip would be more of a disaster than a blessing.
