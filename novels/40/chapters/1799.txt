Yang Kai flew through the Star Field with all his strength.

Although the Divine Bird had been rejected by the Star Field’s Principles and been forced to retreat, Yang Kai knew that his crisis had not been resolved.

Because there was a dazzling purple light pursuing him now. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zi Long!

There was no need to think about who it was since Yang Kai was certain who this purple light belonged to. With such a conspicuous colour, who besides Zi Long, who cultivated the Purple Qi Eternal River Secret Art, could it be?

Since Zi Long was after him, Xu Wei was certainly with him.

With his current strength, if he was at his peak, Yang Kai might be able to put up a fight against a First-Order Origin King, but against a master like Zi Long, he was doubtful.

What’s more, while he was escaping from the Divine Bird before, Yang Kai had frequently used his Space Force, causing him a great deal of expenditure. The Divine Bird’s Feather had also pierced his body, and he now had severe wounds. At this moment, Yang Kai simply wanted to run as far away as he could.

However, even if he was skilled in Space Force, he was near exhaustion after fleeing desperately just now, so escaping was currently a great challenge.

Even using his Space Force, Yang Kai could only cross a dozen kilometres in a single leap. Such a distance was nothing to a Second-Order Origin King, and even if Zi Long was not proficient in the Dao of Space, he could cross such a distance in the blink of an eye with his great strength.

Out of desperation, Yang Kai could only summon his Star Shuttle, sit cross-legged on it, and use it to fly forward while also unfurling his Wind and Thunder Wings to boost his speed.

The sound of wind and thunder erupted from Yang Kai’s back as two semi-transparent wings appeared, the left one comprised of Wind Attribute Energy while the right half was filled with Thunder Attribute power. In the next instant, Yang Kai rapidly accelerated.

Looking back and observing silently for a moment, Yang Kai found that his current speed could almost match Zi Long’s pursuit speed, allowing him to relax slightly.

As long as he could gain enough time, he would be able to restore himself.

However, where to flee now was a difficult question.

The attraction of the Immortal Tree was too great, and Yang Kai was certain Zi Long would never give it up, so he had to find an absolutely safe place to flee to!

In the Star Field, the only Cultivation Stars Yang Kai was familiar with were Shadowed Star and Tong Xuan Realm; however, these two places were too far away from his current location. Even at his current speed, it would take a year or two to reach them. What’s more, neither of these places could be considered safe.

If Zi Long was brought to either of these places, it would only result in disaster. Neither Tong Xuan Realm nor Shadowed Star could resist a master on Zi Long’s level.

With Tong Xuan Realm and Shadowed Star not being options, where was he supposed to go?

Yang Kai suddenly found himself at a loss.

He had spent many years in the Star Field now, but the number of places he had been to was quite limited. Now that his life was in danger, he had no idea where to go.

Not giving up, Yang Kai sank his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea, condensed his Soul Avatar, and looked up for inspiration.

In the sky above his Knowledge Sea, a sea of stars flickered brightly.

It was the Star Chart which Yang Kai had refined dozens of years ago, a miniature model of the entire Star Field!

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense quickly wandered through the Star Chart, looking for a place to escape to.

Unfortunately, every time his eyes landed on a spot, he could only slowly shake his head in rejection...

For a time, he could not find any good options.

Suddenly though, he saw a certain place and his eyes lit up, muttering to himself, “That’s right, I can go there!”

Yang Kai silently scolded himself for getting too anxious and forgetting that place. If he could escape there, what would it matter if Zi Long was a Second-Order Origin King? Forget about Zi Long, even if those old monsters who had secluded themselves from the world came, they wouldn’t be able to catch him.

That place was an absolute safe-haven!

Moreover, he could take the opportunity to consolidate his gains in that place, and if the opportunity was right, he might even be able to break through to the Origin King Realm.

What held Yang Kai back from entering the Origin King Realm now was only his comprehension of his own realm, the Heavenly Way, and the Martial Dao. Both his physical body and his Soul already greatly exceeded those of an ordinary Origin King.

As long as he could break through to the Origin King Realm, Yang Kai wouldn’t need to fear Zi Long anymore.

“En, it’s decided: I’ll go there!” Yang Kai muttered to himself before sending his consciousness back to his body.

The next moment, he opened his eyes with a flicker, turned around to glance at Zi Long who was chasing behind him, and snickered, “Chase me, come and chase me! One day, you’ll regret it, haha!”

Pushing his Saint Qi, his Star Shuttle’s speed suddenly increased.

“That bastard!” A few thousand kilometres away, Zi Dong cursed, “What kind of Secret Technique did he use to achieve such speed?”

Zi Long also had a gloomy face and was in a bad mood.

Originally, he thought that it would be an easy task to capture Yang Kai without the Divine Bird’s interference, but he had not expected that, after chasing Yang Kai through the Star Field for quite some time, he was unable to even pull closer.

This little brat’s speed was on par with his own!

“Young Master is correct, that boy must have used some kind of powerful Secret Technique to achieve his current speed, but Young Master may rest assured. When he can no longer support that Secret Technique, his speed will definitely drop. At that point, the boy will easily be captured, considering Senior Zi Long’s ability,” Xu Wei saw Zi Dong losing his temper and immediately tried to placate him.

He did not care if Zi Dong was angry or frustrated, but in his current position, he had no choice but to try to calm him down. If Zi Dong became enraged and had no other place to vent his hatred, would Xu Wei have to suffer in Yang Kai’s place?

Xu Wei would not allow such a stupid scenario to play out.

He just wanted to remain safe, nothing more, nothing less.

Zi Dong gave a sidelong glance towards Xu Wei, causing the latter’s heart to clench. He didn’t know what his new Young Master was thinking, so he could only put on a flattering smile and laugh awkwardly.

“Are you sure he used some kind of forbidden Secret Technique? Are you sure his Secret Technique will soon fail?” Zi Dong asked.

“Uh, this...” Xu Wei was speechless.

[Damn it, how am I supposed to know? Wasn’t it you who suggested this in the first place? This old master was just following your words but now you’re trying to blame this old master? You stupid pig!]

Xu Wei slandered mercilessly in his heart as his anger raged, but he did not dare show any defiance on his face, making him extremely uncomfortable.

“Waste!” Zi Dong cursed, turning his head away from Xu Wei in disgust.

Xu Wei nodded with an ugly smile, “Yes, yes, Old Servant is useless!”

[This old master will make you pay for this one day...] Xu Wei ruthlessly swore to himself!

While the two were talking, Zi Long kept gazing towards the front.

His Divine Sense was much stronger than Zi Dong’s or Xu Wei’s, and his eyesight was also sharper, so even though they were separated by a few thousand kilometres, he could still see some of Yang Kai’s situation.

Yang Kai had indeed used some kind of Secret Technique, one that formed wings on his back.

Although Zi Long had never seen such a Secret Technique before, he could tell that it wasn’t one that greatly consumed a cultivator’s strength, so it was simply impossible for it to fail from overdraft.

Turning his gaze back, Zi Long’s brow furrowed even deeper.

Unsurprisingly, Ni Guang and that black ghastly fellow were chasing them, separated again by a few thousand kilometres.

The longer the delay, the more complications arise! If Yang Kai were to join up with the two masters behind him, even Zi Long would find the situation troublesome.

Realizing this, Zi Long made up his mind and quickly stretched out his hand.

In front of him, a tiny shuttle-like artifact appeared.

“This is...” Zi Dong seemed to recognize this artifact and his eyes quickly lit up.

Xu Wei, on the other hand, frowned. Even with his vast experiences, he could not identify what this artifact was.

If Yang Kai were here though, he would be surprised.

Because this shuttle artifact looked remarkably similar to High Heaven Sect’s Flying Shark Battle Shuttle.

In addition to refining an Origin King Grade Starship, Yang Yan also refined a much smaller Starship that had a shuttle shape.

“Shattering Void Shuttle!” Zi Long said flatly, “My Purple Star’s ancestors received the method to refine this ship from the Great Emperor himself over ten thousand years ago, but their abilities were limited so they could only refine one, and... there are still some flaws with it. Nevertheless, it should be more than enough to catch up with that brat. Quickly get on board!”

Saying so, Zi Long waved his hand and the Shattering Void Shuttle instantly grew to more than a dozen metres in length.

A hatch opened and the trio flew inside.

Upon entering, Xu Wei and Zi Dong both looked around in surprise, noticing the many complex and mysterious Spirit Arrays engraved inside the Shattering Void Shuttle. There were also many High-Rank Saint Crystals inlaid in these Spirit Arrays powering them.

“Xu Wei, take charge of this Spirit Array!” Zi Long pointed to a place and ordered Xu Wei.

“If I may be so bold as to ask... Senior Zi Long, what exactly should this Old Servant do...”

“Sit on the Spirit Array and pour your Saint Qi into it,” Zi Long explained.

“Old Servant understands,” Xu Wei quickly sat down cross-legged on the Spirit Array, but before he could even begin pouring his Saint Qi into it, he let out a stuffy snort.

Because at that moment, the Spirit Array was actively drawing out his Saint Qi, and the rate at which it was doing so was frightening.

This made his face change drastically.

He instinctively wanted to jump up, but when he saw Zi Long’s stern gaze, his head shrank, and he sat back down again.

A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a rat’s father will definitely be a rat...

This father and son were both bad news! Xu Wei’s heart was filled with indignation and grief...

No wonder Zi Long said that this Shattering Void Shuttle had some flaws, it turns out it needed to extract Saint Qi from a cultivator to operate, and judging from the draw rate of this Spirit Array, ordinary cultivators couldn’t bear such consumption. Even an Origin King like Xu Wei would not have enough Saint Qi to persist for long.

“Dong, you sit here,” Zi Long pointed to another Spirit Array and said to Zi Dong.

“Yes, father,” Zi Dong did not hesitate to sit on another Spirit Array.

Zi Long then sat on the third Spirit Array.

When the three finished sitting down, the Spirit Arrays inside the Shattering Void Shuttle fully activated and after a brief hum it shot off.

The shuttle’s speed was much faster than Zi Long’s own, almost appearing to break through the void, hence its name.

“Haha, let’s see you try to run now, Boy!” Zi Dong laughed wildly. After sitting on the Spirit Array and pouring his Saint Qi into it, he found that he became closely connected to the Shattering Void Shuttle. Through this connection, he could sense Yang Kai’s position and situation clearly and could not help rejoicing. This way, he would be able to spectate Yang Kai’s desperate but futile attempts to escape.
