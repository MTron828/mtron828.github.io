The World Spirit was already in her hands, but it had been snatched away by Yang Kai’s Ice Phoenix just like that. This was a serious loss, so it could easily be imagined what the Demon Blood Temple’s Temple Master’s mood was right now. Right now, all she wanted to do was skin Yang Kai then burn his corpse to ash to soothe the hatred in her heart.

However, after taking in the situation around her for a moment, the beautiful woman suddenly withdrew her dreadful anger and instead smiled enchantingly as she called out, “Little Brother, it seems we are fated to be together, meeting again so soon.”

As she spoke, she stared towards Yang Kai with excitement, her pink tongue licking her red lips as if she was staring at a rare delicacy, her appetite on full display.

“Fated indeed,” Yang Kai grinned and gently nodded.

Bi Luo raised her brow and shot a glare towards Yang Kai as she asked in a low tone, “You know this loose woman? Is she some loose debt you racked up outside?”

Bi Luo instantly found herself disliking this woman and thought Yang Kai had been seduced by the other party’s feminine wiles.

Hearing Bi Luo ask this, Yang Kai only spared her a light glance before ignoring her, too lazy to explain.

“Little Brother, we’re all cultivators from Shadowed Star so we should be cooperating with one another by all rights. Why did you find it necessary to spoil this Temple Master’s good deed?” The beautiful woman still flashed a seductive smile, exuding a kind of mysterious charm as she lithely stepped forward, her red lips parting slightly as she said, “If you obediently hand over that World Spirit, this Queen is willing to overlook this unfortunate incident, what do you say?”

“Sounds good, after returning to Shadowed Star, come to the Flowing Flame Sand Field to find me and I’ll happily return that World Spirit to you,” Yang Kai replied with a smile, as if he was having a friendly chat with this woman, not showing a trace of nervousness.

The beautiful woman’s pretty face instantly became cold as the perfunctory meaning in Yang Kai’s words could not be more obvious. If they returned to Shadowed Star like this, even if she possessed great strength and skill, it was impossible for her to enter the Flowing Flame Sand Field to find him, much less get him to return that World Spirit.

This brat was making it clear that he intended to snatch that World Spirit from her.

Letting out a sigh, a trace of forlorn sadness flashed across this woman’s eyes, as if she was a woman who had been used and then tossed away by Yang Kai, slowly pining, “Little Brother, this Queen has no intention of being enemies with you, but if you insist on acting so besotted, this Queen doesn’t mind teaching you a little lesson. You should think carefully now, if you force this Queen to act personally, you and that little girl may not be able to leave this place safely.”

“If you think you have the skill, you’re welcome to try!” Yang Kai sneered.

“Arrogant boy!” Jin Shi furiously shouted, “Temple Master, there’s no need for any nonsense with him, we should simply capture him and be done with it. A trivial First-Order Origin Returning Realm brat dares to act pretentious before us? He really doesn’t know how high the Heavens are!”

“En,” Demon Blood Temple’s beautiful Temple Lord nodded lightly, a predatory glint flashing across her eyes as she giggled with delight, “When we capture him, this boy will belong to me. This Queen has never encountered a man with such strong vitality, he will be able to provide me with a great deal of vital essence!”

When they entered the Emperor Garden that day, she and Jin Shi had passed by Yang Kai, who was condensing his Shi. At that time, this woman had witnessed Yang Kai resist the crushing Emperor Pressure with his flesh alone, shocking her greatly. Realizing how intrepid Yang Kai’s body was, she had naturally taken a strong interest in him.

The stronger the physique a man possessed, the greater use they were to her. Demon Blood Temple’s vicious Temple Lord had been ‘consuming’ many strong men over the years, but no male she had tasted had ever compared to Yang Kai.

Even if the incident with the World Spirit had not happened just now, having bumped into Yang Kai inside the Emperor Garden, this woman had no plans on letting him escape her grasp. Her pleasant speech just now had simply been a ploy to get Yang Kai to relax his vigilance.

But since they had now torn face, there was no need for any more words.

“This old master wants these three women then!” Jin Shi laughed, not only regarding Bi Luo as his prize but also including the two women from Ice Heart Valley who were seriously injured and unable to act here. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When these words reached their ears, the two women from Ice Heart Valley paled involuntarily as they silently cursed in their hearts. If they had been at their peak, they would not fear Jin Shi or Demon Blood Temple’s Temple Master, but now...

At this moment, the two of them could at best display twenty or thirty percent of their peak strength, so they had no choice but to pin their hopes on Yang Kai, but what chance did a trivial First-Order Origin Returning Realm boy who was dragging along a heavily wounded woman stand against these two Third-Order Origin Realm masters?

The two from Ice Heart Valley were extremely anxious as they stared fixedly towards the other side, worried Yang Kai would instantly be defeated.

If that were to happen, they too would not be able to escape. Although they did not want to admit it, they and Yang Kai were now grasshoppers on a rope, if one of them suffered, all of them suffered.

“Boy, this old master knows you possess a powerful Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit, but in this place, do you dare use it to fight?” Jin Shi sneered as he pointed out Yang Kai’s weakness.

The Artifact Spirit was currently protecting Yang Kai and Bi Luo from the frigid cold here. If he released it, Yang Kai could likely support himself for a short time, but Bi Luo would likely immediately fall.

Jin Shi instantly determined that the Firebird Artifact Spirit would be useless in the following battle and at most would be able to play some minor protective role.

“What about it?” Yang Kai stared back at him coldly, not seeming to care.

“Seems you won’t show regret unless you see your coffin!” Jin Shi coldly snorted before drawing in a deep breath and releasing a dazzling golden light in the next instant which covered his figure. Behind this dazzling golden light, a vague cicada shaped phantom image appeared. This giant cicada was also a brilliant golden colour and, in a flash, it dove into Jin Shi’s body. The instant the two merged, Jin Shi’s aura underwent a massive transformation and a feeling of uncomfortable hostility began leaking from his form, one that seemed to stimulate the violence and killing intent in everyone’s heart.

Golden Cicada Extreme Demon Art!

Jin Shi’s hatred for Yang Kai ran deep. Losing an arm to this boy’s machinations had caused Jin Shi many tortured, sleepless nights, so now that he had a chance to seek revenge, he did not hesitate to use this Secret Art he had grown famous for on Shadowed Star. Obviously, Jin Shi was planning to end this battle in one fell swoop.

When the golden light dissipated, scales seemed to have formed on Jin Shi’s bare skin and a pair of extremely thin cicada’s wings had sprouted from his back.

Jin Shi’s cheeks had also swollen up and when he breathed a cicada-like cry rang out, creating a sound wave that was visible to the naked eye which propagated towards Yang Kai.

The casual look on Yang Kai’s face quickly grew solemn. When Jin Shi used this trick to deal with the World Spirit just now, Yang Kai had seen its effects so he understood how strange and powerful this Secret Technique could be; naturally, Yang Kai couldn’t act carelessly.

Pushing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai released a tide of Spiritual Energy from his Knowledge Sea to surround and protect himself, creating a halo of fiery red energy which stung the eyes of anyone who saw it.

“Divine Sense Manifestation?” Jin Shi’s eyes bulged as he called out in shock, a look of utter disbelief filling his face.

Although Divine Sense was usually intangible, when it became powerful to a certain degree, it could also become visible to the eye. This phenomenon was known as Divine Sense Manifestation!

No one on Shadowed Star could accomplish this, or at least Jin Shi did not know of any master capable of displaying Divine Sense Manifestation. This ability was something which supposedly required at least an Origin King Realm cultivation.

This boy in front of him had just broken through to the First-Order Origin Returning Realm though, so how could he possibly have such a powerful Divine Sense?

On top of that, just from the colour of the barrier which Yang Kai condensed with his Spiritual Energy, it was obvious he did not possess an ordinary Divine Sense but rather a mutated Conflagrated Divine Sense!

[Damn!] Jin Shi’s thoughts flashed as he cursed to himself. Just now he had done his best to overestimate this boy’s strength, but now, it seemed he was still underestimating him.

The sonic attack launched by Jin Shi reached Yang Kai but it was completely blocked by the fiery red halo, having as much effect as a rock being tossed into the sea, creating essentially no disturbance at all.

Fortunately for Jin Shi, he was not fighting alone. At the same time he attacked, Demon Blood Temple’s beautiful Temple Master also took action, sending out her bracelet-like artifact again, having it multiply and crash towards Yang Kai, its momentum quite frightening.

Facing this situation, Yang Kai’s expression remained unsurprised, as if everything was proceeding as he had expected. Flicking his wrist, a dark green bladeless metre long sword-shaped artifact appeared in his hand.

Dragon Bone Sword, Verdant!

As Yang Kai madly poured his Saint Qi into it, the Verdant Bone Sword instantly released a dazzling green light halo and seemed to come alive, releasing a thunderous dragon roar as it transformed into a several-dozen-metre-long giant dark green dragon before striking out towards the Demon Blood Temple Master with its sharp teeth and claws.

Dragon Pressure filled the air, creating terrifying coercion even more intense than the one which accompanied the appearance of the Ice Phoenix just now.

Before the barrage of bracelets hit Yang Kai, it was swept away by the giant dark green dragon which proceeded to open its great maw and spray out a green jet of mist towards the beauty from Demon Blood Temple. This green mist carried with it a rancid and disgusting smell and was quite clearly extremely toxic. Demon Blood Temple’s Temple Master cried out in panic and hurriedly dodged this poison jet, her beautiful eyes flashing violently.

She had not participated in the Battle of Dragon Cave Mountain but she had received a detailed report from Jin Shi so she knew that Yang Kai possessed this strange dragon-like artifact.

When she heard Jin Shi’s report, she hadn’t paid it much attention though, thinking he was just exaggerating the facts to save face after being defeated; after all, artifacts were dead while people were alive, so even if an artifact’s grade was high, if the person using it wasn’t strong enough, it shouldn’t be able to display much power.

But after seeing this artifact with her own eyes, she no longer dared think this way.

The giant dark-green dragon transformed artifact looked almost as if it had a true flesh and blood body, as though a true Ancient Divine Spirit had suddenly appeared in this place, making her not dare to underestimate it.

This kind of result was surprising as, during the Battle of Dragon Cave Mountain, although Yang Kai had summoned his Dragon Bone Sword, it was extremely difficult for him to control it as the Dragon Soul did not cooperate with him and was even actively trying to resist Yang Kai’s commands.

Now, however, the Dragon Soul inhabiting the Dragon Bone Sword had completely surrendered to Yang Kai and established a connection to his soul, which meant it could display far more power than it had back on Dragon Cave Mountain. With her attack being easily broken, the beautiful Demon Blood Temple Master could only fall back to recover her stance, flying about the ice road at high speed while trying to fend off the giant dark green dragon.

Seeing this, Jin Shi was not at all distraught. Instead, he was overjoyed!

This was understandable. Yang Kai’s Artifact Spirit was currently busy blocking the frigid chill of the ice road and his Dragon Bone Sword was now being entangled by the beautiful Temple Master, which meant that this boy’s two trump cards had already been played, leaving him with nothing that Jin Shi needed to fear!
