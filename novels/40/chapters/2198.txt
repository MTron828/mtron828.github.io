Luo Yuan did not stop, however, and shouted once more, “Let’s end this nonsense now. This Spirit Pill... you eat it!”

As he spoke, his figure flickered and he moved right in front of the round-faced woman, stretched out his hand to pinch her cheeks, then snatched the Extraordinary Treasure Pill with his free hand and threw it into her mouth.

“Cough cough cough...”

The round-faced woman felt the Spirit Pill enter her belly and couldn’t help but back up a few steps. She coughed and beat her chest constantly, as if she wanted to vomit up the Spirit Pill. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But that was futile. After the Spirit Pill entered her stomach, it directly melted and began flowing into her abdomen.

She tried hard to stop all this for a while, but ultimately failed and raised her head in despair.

However, when she lifted her eyes, Luo Yuan was gone.

“He left,” Lan Xun looked at the round-faced woman and sighed slightly, “He is headed towards the exit.”

The round-faced woman heard this, turned her head, and saw a stream of light flying off towards the exit.

Luo Yuan actually didn’t even bother trying to trade with Yang Kai. It seemed that in order to prove his words about his aptitude, and that he could break through to the Emperor Realm on his own, he intended to give up this opportunity to obtain an Extraordinary Treasure Pill!

“Senior Brother Luo!” The round-faced woman called out, grit her teeth, stomped her foot, and chased after Luo Yuan.

Watching this, no one tried to embarrass her further. Firstly, she was a disciple of the Eight Paths Sect, and she had a Senior Brother Junior Sister relationship with Luo Yuan, who had already killed one man who had acted against her. Secondly... the Extraordinary Treasure Pill had already been taken by her, so what point was there to embarrass this woman? Would it be possible to force her to spit up that Spirit Pill?

And so, this brief episode came to an end.

“It’s like he said, not wanting to be bound by a favour from others... or snatching an opportunity that belongs to others...” Yang Kai sat in place, stroking his chin thoughtfully...

With so many people present, perhaps everyone only saw Luo Yuan’s ruthlessness and ferocity, but Yang Kai saw something else.

When he was dealing with the round-faced woman earlier, before the trade was even concluded, Luo Yuan had actually yelled at him from a distance, telling him to not go too far!

Yang Kai didn’t understand why Luo Yuan did that at the time, but now it was obvious he had been trying to help that round-faced woman.

If Luo Yuan really had no interest in her, then there would have been no need for him to say those words. While she was trying to strike a deal with Yang Kai, Luo Yuan only needed to sit on the sidelines...

What’s more, how could someone as proud and arrogant as Luo Yuan accept gifts from others? Especially when the gift was from his Junior Sister, one that clearly loves and admires him...

Yang Kai felt that if he was in Luo Yuan’s position, it would be impossible to accept that Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

A true man should hold such convictions.

Although he disapproved of Luo Yuan’s rotten method of handling his Junior Sister, Yang Kai actually appreciated his decisive approach.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai shook his head as a frown came to his brow and he secretly thought, [Why am I allowing someone else’s affairs to trouble me?]

Thinking so, he shouted, “Next!”

Maybe because the round-faced woman’s success made the remaining cultivators see hope, as soon as Yang Kai called out, cultivators swarmed towards him.

But under the influence of the twisted Space Principles, only one person was allowed to enter at a time.

Unfortunately for this man, the result was disappointing as Yang Kai swiftly checked what he took out before shooing him away.

The next dozen people had similar experiences!

When Yang Kai took a leisurely look around, he found that there were not many people left.

This secretly made him anxious, because the Tribulation Fruit he wanted hadn’t appeared so far. It wasn’t clear whether someone hadn’t taken it out to trade, or if the one who had the Tribulation Fruit hadn’t come to begin with.

If Yang Kai failed to obtain the Tribulation Fruit on this excursion to the Four Seasons Realm, he really didn’t know how he could explain it to Qin Zhao Yang. Qin Yu’s life depended on him acquiring the Tribulation Fruit, without it, that little girl would only have a few months left to live.

[Should I just directly request to exchange the Tribulation Fruit for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill?]

Yang Kai hesitated. If he really made such a request, and if the person who had the Tribulation Fruit was present, that person would definitely not refuse, but if that person wasn’t here and news spread out, it would definitely cause many troubles from him.

After thinking about it carefully, Yang Kai suppressed this idea and continued to trade with other people calmly.

After an hour, Yang Kai’s face became gloomy.

Because almost every cultivator present had come to trade with him, but he had yet to see a trace of the Tribulation Fruit...

His ill premonition had come true!

The only people that were left were the ones from Azure Sun Temple and the few famous Masters who had been waiting and watching up until now.

Having reached this point, Yang Kai didn’t want to delay any more and shouted, “Who will come first? I won’t conceal it from you, the total number of Extraordinary Treasure Pills that were refined was four. In other words... this Yang only has one left.”

One of them was taken by him, one was given to Lan Xun, and one was given to the round-faced woman, so with only four being refined, only one remained.

As he made this announcement, Yang Kai picked up his Black Jade Furnace and shook it slightly.

From the Black Jade Furnace, a rolling, clinking sound rang out.

Inferring from the sound, there was indeed only one pill inside!

After the refinement succeeded, all of Yang Kai’s actions had been witnessed by everyone’s eyes, so he had no opportunity or time to hide any of the Spirit Pills, leading everyone to trust this statement.

“Since there is only one pill left, then this Xiao will come,” Xiao Chen, who had held back for a long time, at this moment finally took his turn. Leaping out swiftly, he strode towards Yang Kai with a confident smile, seemingly confident he would obtain this last Spirit Pill.

Not long after, he arrived in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai looked at him with a smile and said, “Brother Xiao, please!”

Xiao Chen sneered and while taking out something from his Space Ring, he whispered in a low voice, “Little Brat, I advise you to accept this immediately and then hand over that Extraordinary Treasure Pill to this Xiao, that way everyone can remain friendly.”

Yang Kai heard this and looked up at him.

Xiao Chen continued with a smile on his face, “The things that this Xiao took out are not items just anyone can see, there should be something that satisfies you.”

Despite the insufferable arrogance with which he spoke, Xiao Chen had the capital to say such words things; after all, he not only came from the Southern Territory’s overlord, Star Soul Palace, he was an elite disciple of that Sect and also the son of Silver Star Envoy, Xiao Yu Yang.

The things he took out were indeed rare treasures! Whether they were artifacts or herbs, treasures, or even Secret Arts...

It was a dazzling and varied array.

Yang Kai, however, didn’t even glance at those things and simply asked, “Brother Xiao, did you enter the Realm of Winter during this opening of the Four Seasons Realm?”

Xiao Chen heard this and furrowed his brow, not knowing why Yang Kai had asked such a question. Replying impatiently, he spat, “No, this Xiao has always been accompanying her Highness. Princess said that the environment in the Realm of Winter was too barren...”

“If so, you can pack up your things and go!” Yang Kai waved his hand as he cut off Xiao Chen.

“What did you just say?” Xiao Chen’s face suddenly became gloomy as he glared at Yang Kai fiercely, the threatening tone in his voice more than evident.

“Did you not hear me clearly?” Yang Kai grinned, cracking his neck before leaning towards Xiao Chen and shouting, “Brother Xiao can go!”

After this shout, he leaned back and smiled slightly, “If you still couldn’t hear me, there’s nothing more I can do.”

Xiao Chen’s expression turned ugly as it went from red to white before he shouted in a low tone, “Boy, have you considered the consequences of your actions clearly?”

In front of everyone’s eyes, he was humiliated by Yang Kai like this. What was worse though was that everyone now knew he didn’t have what Yang Kai wanted, so continuing to entangle himself would only lead everyone to believe he was trying to bully Yang Kai...

However, Yang Kai wasn’t going to give him any face.

“Scram!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully, without a trace of politeness, and pushed the surrounding Space Principles towards Xiao Chen, wanting to throw him out of this shattered space forcefully.

Although Yang Kai had used this trick to directly send out a Dao Source Realm cultivator before, when it came to Xiao Chen, things did not go so smoothly. There was an inexplicable Principle Strength that lingered around Xiao Chen, clashing with the surrounding Space Principles, causing his figure to flicker slightly while remaining in place.

This situation lasted for ten breaths before Xiao Chen took the initiative to withdraw.

If he continued to linger, he would be forced to fight with Yang Kai, and in that strange shattered space, Xiao Chen also felt the threat of death, so he did not dare to remain.

After escaping three hundred meters, Xiao Chen glared at Yang Kai with a gloomy face, gnashing his teeth for a while.

“Haa...” Seeing this scene, Lan Xun only felt a headache coming on, and after sighing, she turned around and flew off towards the exit.

When Xiao Chen saw this, his face twitched before he turned and shouted at Yang Kai, “Boy, I’ll remember you. You’d best pray you don’t fall into my hands one day.”

Leaving this threat, he chased after Lan Xun.

Yang Kai turned a deaf ear to these words and turned to Xia Sheng and the others with a smile, “Brother Xia, there’s really just one Spirit Pill left, don’t you want to come and see it?”

If possible, he would like to trade with Xia Sheng for this Spirit Pill.

Yang Kai knew he couldn’t bring this Spirit Pill out of the Four Seasons Realm as the only result would be the Emperors outside snatching it from him while giving him some paltry compensation.

As for giving it away...

Yang Kai had never considered it. For one thing, he and Xia Sheng weren’t actually that close, and there was no friendship between them. What’s more, with the Extraordinary Treasure Pill being so precious, even if Yang Kai offered it to Xia Sheng for free, the latter would not be willing to accept it.

If Xia Sheng took this Extraordinary Treasure Pill without offering proper compensation, it would mean owing Yang Kai a huge favour.
