The two Great Emperors were in the heat of the battle, while Yang Kai was getting closer to a breakthrough to the side.

A trace of Emperor Intent seeped out of his body. The Emperor Intent was not obvious initially, but it became clearer and clearer as time passed.

Condensing one’s Emperor Intent was the most basic requirement to break through to the Emperor Realm. Only with one’s own Emperor Intent could one reach the threshold of the Emperor Realm and push through the door of the highest Martial Dao.

Rich and thick World Energy gathered above Yang Kai, forming an extremely terrifying Heavenly Manifestation. The dark World Energy condensed in a cluster, as if the sky was about to crack open and fall, and there were continuous lightning flashes from the clouds, creating a deafening thunder.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, unmoving, all his life experiences rapidly flashing through his mind.

He did not ask for this. The flashbacks of memory involuntarily appeared in his mind and he had no control over it.

He started off his journey as a Trial Disciple of High Heaven Pavilion, he cultivated hard, but still could not advance. Yet he did not give up his Martial Heart even though he was bullied by his fellow brothers.

He then obtained the Wordless Black Book, peeped into the inheritance of the Great Demon God, and had soared ever since.

The memory of him going through the war in the Central Capital, travelling Tong Xuan Realm, advancing into the Starry Sky, breaking into Heng Luo Star Field, entering the Star Boundary, everything flashed before his eyes…

Then, there was the passion of Su Yan; the gentleness of Xia Ning Chang; the emotional entanglements with Shan Qing Luo; the fight with Xue Yue that brought them closer…

Followed by the tireless pursuit of the peak of the Martial Dao; the search for his own Dao. Yang Kai always had beauties as his companions throughout his journey, so although he was occasionally lonely, he was never truly alone.

Regarding his life, he had no disappointment nor complaints!

In this path, no hatred nor regrets! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Without a demon in his heart, no external force could invade!

At a certain point, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, and there was a clarity to them that shined like the stars in the night sky. With a low crack, the trembling shackles in his body were instantly loosened.

*Kacha…*

His body emitted all sorts of noises as his bones, his meridians, and his physique all shook fiercely. His meridians abruptly expanded and became tougher, while his bones and physique became harder and firmer.

His Soul also became stronger, seemingly expanding greatly.

*Hong long long… *

A lightning bolt as thick as a man’s torso struck down from the sky and landed directly on top of Yang Kai. This bolt contained the majesty of the Heavenly Way in it and had the power able to destroy all things. There was also unparalleled World Energy following along the lightning bolt, as if it was intending to drown Yang Kai in it.

*Kacha… *

As Yang Kai’s body continued to shiver uncontrollably, he could not help letting out a grunt. His clothes were torn to pieces, exposing his strong and firm physique; his skin cracked and blood seeped out.

The Heavenly Way seemed to be forbidding him from advancing to the Emperor Realm.

In order to truly break through, he had to endure the condemnation of the Heavenly Way and withstand a fierce World Energy Baptism.

Throughout the ages, countless talented cultivators and elites had failed at this juncture. This was the reason why there were countless Dao Source Realm cultivators, but so few Emperors in the Star Boundary.

Only those who had strong determination in their Martial Dao could truly reach the Emperor Realm. External forces would not stop them from going against the current, and they would never be shaken as long as they held onto this belief.

The World Energy Baptism for an Emperor was scarier than anything that Yang Kai had ever experienced.

Yang Kai was already injured by just one lightning bolt strike!

Luckily, his physique was exceptionally intrepid and his Golden Blood possessed astonishing regenerative abilities. As such, his cracked skin was able to heal rapidly.

The World Energy that was pouring into him was completely devoured all at once, causing his aura to increase instead of decrease.

The second lightning bolt descended on him before he could fully recover.

And it was even more frightening than the first. A devastating aura permeated when the second lightning bolt struck down, and Yang Kai felt the aura of death contained within it. Without hesitation, he immediately focused his mind and pushed his strength to resist the incoming strike.

*Hong long long… *

Yang Kai’s injuries worsened immediately, and he now looked extremely terrifying with his body drenched in blood. The raging World Energy invaded his body, thrashing about wildly inside his physique and meridians.

He endured the suffering with his gritted teeth and continued to absorb the rampaging World Energy into his body while comprehending the Heavenly Way. He swept away the fog that blinded his eyes and searched for his true Martial Dao.

*Hong Hong Hong… *

The third bolt cascaded down without pause.

In the distance, the two Great Emperors, who were fighting intensely against each other, could not help but be attracted by the commotion caused by Yang Kai, and the both of them turned to look simultaneously.

After a glance, Wu Kuang muttered as his eyes flashed, “That little brat… is not simple.”

He was the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, the strongest Master in the Star Boundary’s history, and although he might be surpassed one day, he was absolutely unprecedented in the present. He did not even put other Great Emperors in his eyes.

Therefore, ‘not simple’ was exceptionally high praise coming from him.

“He is indeed a bit odd!” Duan Hong Chen slightly squinted his eyes and nodded in agreement.

If Yang Kai was simple, how could he suppress Emperor Realm Masters with only a Dao Source Realm cultivation? If he was simple, how could he improve his cultivation so quickly in these short few years? Duan Hong Chen had known Yang Kai for some time now, and even though he was not close with him, he had always been a good judge of character and already predicted that Yang Kai would achieve great success in the future when they first met in Maplewood City.

Although Duan Hong Chen had a high expectation of Yang Kai’s capabilities, at this moment he realized he still underestimated this little boy.

“Duan Hong Chen, did you experience such phenomena when you were breaking through to the Emperor Realm back then?” Wu Kuang questioned in a deep voice.

Duan Hong Chen grinned, “If I had to face such a terrifying World Baptism back then, there would be no Bustling World Great Emperor today.”

Wu Kuang nodded lightly, “This little brat has the makings of a Great Emperor!”

Duan Hong Chen laughed, “I think this little brat has more than just the makings of a Great Emperor. He will surpass you sooner or later!”

“Surpass this King?” Wu Kuang sneered, “Nonsense. No one can surpass the power of this King!”

Duan Hong Chen chuckled, “Say whatever you want, you won’t have a chance to see it anyway.”

Wu Kuang put up a cold face, “Do you have so much confidence in killing this King?”

Duan Hong Chen answered solemnly, “This Old Master already said earlier that he didn’t plan to leave here alive. Today, this Old Master will kill you and settle this matter once and for all, even if I must extinguish my Soul as the price!”

“Good, since you said so, this King won’t need to be polite with you anym… huh?” While speaking, Wu Kuang’s face abruptly changed and he turned his attention back to Yang Kai.

Duan Hong Chen also seemed to have noticed something amiss and turned to look. There, the Heavenly Manifestation above Yang Kai had changed once more. The World Energy clouds that gathered on top of his head had now turned into an inverted funnel, with its top connected to the Heavens, while its bottom connected to Earth. The terrifying World Energy contained in this vortex made the expressions of the two Great Emperors turn dignified.

As soon as the funnel appeared, it crashed downwards madly and directly connected to Yang Kai’s body.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s body seemed to have become a bottomless pit, swallowing the rich and surging power as Emperor Aura radiated from his body more and more intensely.

“What…” Duan Hong Chen’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets, “What is this situation? Is this little brat courting death?”

“Hahaha!” Wu Kuang laughed out loud, “He must be overconfident. To think he would try to contend with and devour the Power of Heaven and Earth. Duan Hong Chen, it looks like this little brat has no chance to surpass this King. There is no doubt that he will die today!”

Without denying his remark, Duan Hong Chen sighed, “What a waste, what a waste!”

If he witnessed this scene at a different time, perhaps he would help Yang Kai out of appreciation for his talent; however, he was in a heated battle with Wu Kuang right now and he could not spare his energy on Yang Kai.

How could Yang Kai survive under this torrent of World Energy?

The activity on Yang Kai’s side became more and more violent as the two Great Emperors spoke, and it was not long before the entire world began shaking. Bottomless ravines emerged as the ground around Yang Kai cracked in a spider-web pattern.

Suddenly, a noble roar sounded and at the same time, a golden dragon shadow emerged out of Yang Kai’s body, shaking its head and flicking its tail, rushing up towards the vortex of World Energy.

“A Golden Dragon Divine Source!” Wu Kuang exclaimed with genuine shock.

“Impossible!” Duan Hong Chen also looked like he had seen a ghost. The appearance of the Golden Dragon Phantom grabbed the two Great Emperors’ attention, and they instantly shifted their focus to Yang Kai, their expressions changing drastically.

“Who is this little brat? How did he obtain a Golden Divine Dragon Source!?” Wu Kuang yelled. For some unknown reason, he seemed quite excited.

After being stunned for quite a while, Duan Hong Chen responded, “How would this Old Master know about such a thing!? The Golden Divine Dragon is the ancestor of the Dragon Clan. It is rumoured that it is the progenitor of the entire Dragon Clan and turned countless aeons ago. How could there be a Golden Divine Dragon Source in this world!?”

“Tsk tsk…” The ghost fire was dancing rapidly in Wu Kuang’s hollow eye sockets, revealing a greedy look, “If those old dragons on Dragon Island knew about this, this King is certain they would go crazy!”

“What are you plotting?” Duan Hong Chen suddenly stared at Wu Kuang vigilantly.

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, “Even if this King has any plans, killing you is the first thing I must do!”

During their conversation, the Golden Divine Dragon turned towards the sky and roared. The dragon opened its mouth facing the terrifying World Energy funnel and sucked in a huge mouthful of that power, devouring and refining it before transferring it to Yang Kai.

In an instant, the pressure on Yang Kai was reduced significantly.

Previously, he also felt that he could not hold on any longer, so he had no choice but to release his Golden Divine Dragon Source. Fortunately, this move was effective.

The Golden Divine Dragon Source was truly magnificent, capable of contending with and swallowing this flood of World Energy.

As the dragon continued to devour, the aura in Yang Kai’s body became stronger and stronger, and his strength increased accordingly. He was completely renewed in spirit and feeling bolder by the moment.

Although he had no idea how it felt when the others were breaking through to the Emperor Realm, he believed that the Emperor Realm Masters whom he encountered before would all be dead if they experienced the same situation as he.

Maybe only he would have such a climactic scene while being promoted.
