Two days prior, this Young Lady had suddenly stumbled into the cave where the Netherworld Sect’s members were hiding and ordered Hua Fei Chen and others to teach someone a lesson for her.

She said that the man had brazenly bullied her.

Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng felt their heads hurt when they heard this demand; after all, they were here to ambush Yang Kai and had no time to waste on other people.

If it was someone else, Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng wouldn’t even need to pay attention to them; however, this Young Lady wasn’t just anybody. This woman’s background was so great that even the Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master would need to treat her politely, let alone Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng.

In their hearts, they were cursing the blind fool who offended this Young Lady. If it weren’t for him, they wouldn’t be caught in this mess. Lending a hand wasn’t an issue, but there was the chance their movements would alert Yang Kai.

However, no matter how reluctant they were, they couldn’t disobey this Young Lady’s orders.

Just as they decided to grit their teeth and bear with it, the wind began to howl. Their group was forced to stay inside a cave for two days and couldn’t go outside until now.

Now, however, Yin Le Sheng was quite happy, “Young Lady Lin’er, it seems… we are dealing with the same person,” he said with a smile.

“The same person?” A shocked expression appeared on the girl named Lin’er’s face, and even Old Fu’s eyes widened, “Such a coincidence?”

Yin Le Sheng slowly rose, “I will not hide anything from you, Young Lady. That man’s name is Yang Kai, and I have some grievances with him. The reason I came to the Ancient Lands is to deal with him!”

Upon hearing this, a strange expression appeared on Old Fu’s face, “It’s only one person, yet you’ve brought so many people and even prepared the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array. Don’t you think your Netherworld Sect is giving him too much face?”

“You mustn’t underestimate him, Old Fu,” Yin Le Sheng responded solemnly, “I’m not sure if you’ve confronted him before, but he’s not as simple as he seems.”

Old Fu’s face turned red, then he nodded, “Indeed.”

After thinking back to his confrontation with Yang Kai in the desolate city, Old Fu knew that Yin Le Sheng was right. This young man was clearly a First-Order Emperor Realm Master like him, yet when they fought, he was completely suppressed to the point of not being able to fight back at all.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have had to turn to the Netherworld Sect for assistance; after all, as an Emperor Realm Master himself, there were only a few things he couldn’t deal with personally.

“Sheer strength aside, that man is also skilled in a truly esoteric power. That’s what I’m worried about the most. If not for that, I wouldn’t have requested for the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array to be used,” Yin Le Sheng coldly snorted, with a little jealousy on his face.

“What power?” Old Fu asked.

“The Dao of Space!”

“Sii…” Old Fu drew in a sharp breath, his shock could not be concealed, “Did you say… The Dao of Space?” he asked.

“Indeed,” Yin Le Sheng’s expression was gloomy as he nodded, “Moreover, he is so skilled at using Space Force that he seems to be able to tear space at will.”

“For there to be such a thing…” Old Fu’s eyes flickered, then he asked, “Could it be… Is he the disciple of ‘that’ man from Spirit Beast Island?”

Although he didn’t name who he was referring to, both Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng knew who he was talking about.

If Yang Kai really was that person’s disciple, then things would become troublesome. That person was ranked first below the Ten Great Emperors and was known as the most powerful Emperor in the Star Boundary. Even without his title as strongest Emperor Realm Master though, that man still lived on Spirit Beast Island and was a highly valued direct subordinate of Martial Beast Great Emperor.

Who would dare to touch his disciple? Making an enemy of him meant making an enemy of Spirit Beast Island. Not even Old Fu and the girl named Lin’er could afford those consequences.

Therefore, Old Fu couldn’t help but feel worried. What if they had provoked someone they shouldn’t have?

However, to his relief, Yin Le Sheng shook his head, “As far as I know, there is no relationship between the little brat and that Sir, so you can rest assured.”

“How do you know?” Old Fu asked cautiously. As the Young Lady’s bodyguard, he needed to be a careful and thorough person.

Yin Le Sheng smiled and responded, “Because he is from the Southern Territory!”

“The Southern Territory…” Upon hearing this, Old Fu finally put down his worries, “In that case, he should have no ties with that person.” He paused and continued, “So, the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array is for sealing space!”

“Indeed,” Yin Le Sheng said with a hideous grin, “I’d like to see how he’ll be able to escape without his Space Abilities.”

Hua Fei Chen suddenly interjected, “Is that little brat already an Emperor Realm Master?”

The disciple surnamed Yao that Yang Kai killed was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, and Old Fu and the Young Lady had also suffered at his hand. This showed that Yang Kai was likely already an Emperor Realm Master.

“Yes, what did you think he was?” Old Fu looked at him strangely.

Hua Fei Chen frowned, “Martial Nephew Yin said that when they were in the Shattered Star Sea, the little brat was only a Dao Source Realm Master. To think…”

“His aptitude is also astonishing, and the opportunities that exist within the Shattered Star Sea are truly Heaven-defying; thus, it is not surprising that he was able to break through to the Emperor Realm there. Wasn’t I the same? If he wasn’t an Emperor Realm Master, I wouldn’t have asked Martial Uncle Hua and my fellow brothers to lend a hand,” Yin Le Sheng explained with a slight smile.

He looked as though he had expected it.

“The Shattered Star Sea… He was in the Shattered Star Sea?” Old Fu was surprised, “You mean he broke through to the Emperor Realm not long ago?”

A young man who had just broken through to the Emperor Realm, possibly without having stabilized his new cultivation and was still unfamiliar with Emperor Qi, was able to completely suppress him. Old Fu couldn’t believe it.

[Am I just too old?]

“Rest assured, Old Fu. No matter what kind of opportunities he had, he will surely die here today,” Yin Le Sheng said, his expression grim.

“What are you muttering about?” The Young Lady, Lin’er, was silently listening for a long time and finally grew impatient, “I’m telling you to catch that man and bring him to this Young Lady, so why are you all still standing here for?”

Yin Le Sheng turned his head and said with a smile, “We will need to use some means to deal with that man, but please rest assured, Young Lady Lin’er. Within five days, this Yin will surely deliver him to you. At that time, Young Lady Lin’er will be able to do whatever she wishes with him.”

The girl named Lin’er snorted, “It’d better be that way. When the time comes, this Young Lady will strip him of his clothes and throw him to a place filled with people so they can laugh at him!”

She looked so vicious and gleeful, as though this was the heaviest punishment she could think of for Yang Kai.

Previously, she had also threatened Zhang Ruo Xi with these same words.

Yin Le Sheng and others watched on awkwardly, then Hua Fei Chen spoke up.

“Since Martial Nephew Yao has died, we cannot stay here any longer. It is possible that brat surnamed Yang now knows about our trap and will try to escape it. We must change our plans.”

Yin Le Sheng nodded, “We will do as Martial Uncle suggests.”

As soon as they finished their discussion, the group moved out. Old Fu and the Young Lady named Lin’er naturally followed.

Deep in the strange fog, Old Ban was leading the way, with Zhang Ruo Xi behind him and Yang Kai at the rear. The few ignorant Yin Souls that appeared were easily and swiftly dealt with.

After they’d walked for a long time, Yang Kai suddenly asked, “How much further, Old Ban?”

Old Ban’s voice sounded from the front, “We are still barely halfway. It will take at least two more days for us to reach the exit of this passageway.”

“Two days…” Yang Kai pondered for a while and said, “You should have seen what happened before, Old Ban. Some of my enemies seem to be waiting for me ahead. They’re not easy to deal with, so you should head back now. We’ll go the rest of the way alone.”

However, Old Ban grinned meaningfully, “This old man has heard a few things about the Netherworld Sect, and indeed, I cannot afford to provoke them; however, in this Ancient Lands Passage, I am confident in my ability to come and go at will, so Little Brother doesn’t have to worry about me. Since I’ve promised to guide you out of the passageway safely, I will not leave halfway. This old man’s title may not be valuable, but it’s not to be underestimated either.”

Of course, he understood that Yang Kai didn’t want to implicate him, but inside this Ancient Lands Passageway, Old Ban was fearless. If he met an enemy, he could simply dart into the strange fog, then not even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would be able to find him.

His familiarity with this place is his greatest assurance.

After a pause, he continued, “You can also rest assured, Little Brother. Even if they wanted to ambush you, they wouldn’t choose to do it in this damned place. This old man reckons they’re waiting at the exit, so I will be fine as long as I leave before then.”

What he said was quite reasonable. Even if the Netherworld Sect was planning to ambush Yang Kai, they wouldn’t do it in the obscurity of this strange fog; therefore, the road ahead should be safe.

Thus, Yang Kai was no longer reluctant and nodded, “Many thanks then, Old Ban.”

There was nothing more to say along the way, and the three continued to move forward.

Since the most dangerous Falling Thunder and Astral Wind had passed, they no longer had to make any major detours. According to Old Ban, the Ancient Lands Passageway would be relatively safe for another month, and they would only need to pay attention to the occasional Yin Souls that attacked.

Yang Kai was worried that the Ghost King hadn’t given up; after all, he had killed so many Yin Souls when he was in the cave. However, after walking for half a day, Yang Kai realized that he was overthinking things.

Perhaps the Ghost King knew that there was nothing it could do to Yang Kai, even if it attacked personally. What the eyes do not see, the heart does not grieve, so it decided to ignore Yang Kai.

As for the hundreds of Yin Souls that were killed… there was no lack of them in the Ancient Lands Passageway. It didn’t matter how many were killed, since they could always be replaced.

The route Old Ban took was winding and irregular as usual, but with the guidance of the jade beads, the group of three stuck together and always kept a distance of three steps between them.
