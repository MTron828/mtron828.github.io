“Take me out first, we can settle everything else later.” Yang Kai looked at Yao Chang Jun with a smile, “Otherwise, you can also just tell me how to get out of here.”

“Little brat, you dare bargain with this Old Master?!” Yao Chang Jun fumed.

Yang Kai said, “The only thing I’m afraid of is Senior tricking me!”

“Who do you take this Old Master for? How could I do such a shameless thing?!” Yao Chang Jun coldly snorted.

Yang Kai shook his head, “That’s hard to say. What if Senior also doesn’t know the way out? Then wouldn’t I be a fool to just hand over this spirit flower for nothing?”

Pang Guang was enraged, “Little bastard! Senior Yao is giving you face by telling you to hand out the spirit flower, yet you dare not comply?! You’re courting death!”

Yang Kai and Yao Chang Jun turned their heads together and shouted, “None of your damn business!”

Pang Guang’s face was burning hot. Trying to slap a horse’s ass, but landing on its thigh instead, he felt extremely awkward.

Yang Kai observed Yao Chang Jun for a while and snickered, “It seems like Senior is also a clay Buddha fording the river. You can’t even save yourself, so what are you shamelessly boasting for! You say you can take me out? Ridiculous!”

As soon as he saw Yao Chang Jun’s attitude at the moment, it was clear to him that he didn’t know how to get out of this damned place either.

If Yao Chang Jun really did know the way out, it would not have been impossible to trade the Heavenly Restoration Twin Lotus to him, but the key point now was the fact that the old man himself couldn’t get out, so how could he bring him along?

Being exposed by Yang Kai, Yao Chang Jun wasn’t annoyed at all but said indifferently, “With this Old Master’s cultivation, how can a trivial Sealed World trap me? This Old Master will be able to find the way out eventually.”

“Then let’s just wait till you find the way out!”

“Are you handing it over or not?!” Yao Chang Jun had clearly lost his patience, and his face was completely dark when he said these words.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai was unconcerned.

“Good!” Yao Chang Jun drew in a deep breath and his murderous intent surged.

But he did not make a move against Yang Kai that instant, instead turning his gaze to Pang Guang.

Pang Guang who was watching the good show sensed Yao Chang Jun’s cold gaze at once and he couldn’t help but shudder, “Senior...”

“Scram!” Yao Chang Jun bellowed, “Otherwise, this Old Master will kill you as well!”

His voice converged into a wave that shot towards Pang Guang like a spear. Pang Guang was shaken and staggered back, face turning white.

“Senior, this Pang can help you catch that little brat!” Pang Guang quickly offered to show his sincerity. After suddenly landing in this Solitary Void Sealed World, he really couldn’t find any security with his First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation. He just wanted to hug Yao Chang Jun’s thigh, but the other party wouldn’t give him the face or opportunity, telling him to scram as soon as he opened his mouth.

Yao Chang Jun coldly snorted, “This Old Master doesn’t need your help. If you don’t go now... then you can stay here forever!”

Pang Guang was shocked. He looked at Yang Kai with gritted teeth, then back at Yao Chang Jun. With a kick of his feet, Pang Guang’s body rose up before he began flying out to sea.

Even though he had no idea why Yao Chang Jun was in such a hurry to drive him away, Pang Guang knew this old monster was truly at the end of his patience right now. If he continued pestering him, then he could only incur his murderous rage.

Pitting his cultivation against Yao Chang Jun, Pang Guang had no chance to win.

So, he could only run away for now.

Even though the sea did not look peaceful, it was a critical time and he didn’t even know which direction to run. It was better than staying here and waiting for death, right?

In just ten breaths, Pang Guang disappeared.

“Are you so eager to get rid of Pang Guang because you’re worried he’ll discover that your Soul is injured?” Yang Kai asked Yao Chang Jun with a smiling face.

Yao Chang Jun’s face changed and a dangerous glint flashed past his eyes, “As expected, it wasn’t out of luck that you tried that sneak attack on this Old Master!”

Yang Kai laughed, “The effects of the Twin Heavenly Restoration Lotus are only to repair broken meridians and the dantian, yet Senior looks full of energy. With how plentiful Senior’s Emperor Qi is, clearly your meridians and dantian are fine. But for you to be so enthusiastic about the Heavenly Restoration Lotus clearly means you wish to repair your Knowledge Sea.”

“So you actually know this much about herbs and medicines?” Yao Chang Jun was surprised that Yang Kai could deduce through that sliver of a hint that his Soul was damaged. This little brat in front of him clearly wasn’t so simple.

“This humble one is not that talented, I’m merely an Emperor Grade Alchemist!” Yang Kai smiled. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yao Chang Jun’s face changed, but then he quickly snorted, “Are you trying to insult this Old Master’s intelligence?”

He obviously thought that Yang Kai was talking nonsense.

Yang Kai was not that old, so it was astonishing enough for him to have Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, but in terms of him being an Emperor Grade Alchemist, Yao Chang Jun found it completely unbelievable.

Yang Kai was likely an Alchemist, otherwise, he would not know his herbs and medicines so well; however, there was no way he was an Emperor Grade Alchemist.

He thought that Yang Kai was merely telling him that so that he would let him live; after all, even if he got his hands on the Twin Heavenly Restoration Lotus, he still needed an Alchemist to refine the pill for him, and an Emperor Grade Alchemist would be the best choice to do that.

[This little brat’s got a bellyful of evil tricks up his sleeve!] Yao Chang Jun became wary.

Yang Kai was astounded and smiled bitterly as he shook his head, “Senior, with your Soul damaged, your intelligence really does have some problems. This is a disease, and a disease has to be cured.”

He was telling the truth but the other party wasn’t having it, making him not know whether he should laugh or cry.

“No matter what you say today, I’ll still have you hand over the Twin Heavenly Restoration Lotus!” Yao Chang Jun coldly snorted.

Yang Kai’s face went cold, “I told you that you have to tell me how to get out of here first. If you can’t even do that, then don’t even think about it. I’d rather feed it to a dog than give it to you.”

“Little brat, you court death! This Old Master’s patience is limited!” When Yao Chang Jun heard him comparing him to a dog, he was instantly furious.

Yang Kai answered back leisurely, “Even if you’re a Third-Order Emperor, I’m not afraid of you, so don’t compel me. If you force my hand, then you’ll have to suffer as well!”

Yao Chang Jun was stunned and a feeling of absurdity rose up inside of him. To think a mere Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator dared wag their tongue in front of him was unbelievable enough, yet this little brat was still shamelessly boasting! He made it sound as if he really did have the power to fight against him, but from his expression, he seemed completely serious.

[What’s going on? This little brat doesn’t really think he can fight me, right? On what account? With his Space Principles? If so, then he can only run. It’s simply nothing to be feared.]

Yao Chang Jun’s heart was filled with mixed thoughts. He couldn’t figure out why, but he felt a little angry out of shame, “Since you can’t appreciate this Old Master’s kindness, then this Old Master will grant you your wish!”

He stomped his foot on the ground and his entire person flashed before Yang Kai like a spirit, suddenly pointing a finger towards Yang Kai’s direction.

His finger contained the boundlessness of Heaven and Earth, and gave one the feeling that they were being weighed down by the world itself.

After all, Yao Chang Jun was still a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even though his Soul was damaged, his vigorous Martial Dao foundation was very solid. Even though this move was not a renowned Secret Technique, it was extremely ferocious and contained his insight into the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao.

Even before his finger had arrived, the momentum of the sky being broken could be felt. All the Principle Strength in the surrounding region was wrapped around that finger, as if Yao Chang Jun was the master of this stretch of the world.

Seeing that he actually made a move towards him, Yang Kai’s face changed. Tossing all else aside, his Source Qi blasted out, shoving the unconscious Liu Xian Yun straight into the Sealed World Bead while performing his Dragon Transformation and Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art at the same time. Space Principles surged up as Yang Kai was just about to escape from the spot.

*Chi...*

With that sound, Yang Kai was already several dozen kilometres away when he reappeared, but there was a bloody hole on his shoulder where golden blood was pouring out. Immense pain washed through him at the same time.

“Hm?”

Yao Chang Jun was stunned.

He was not only surprised that Yang Kai avoided receiving a fatal blow, but also at where Liu Xian Yun had gone.

He had been paying attention to Yang Kai’s movements this whole time and didn’t care too much about the unconscious girl he was holding. Only, he did not notice how that girl had suddenly disappeared.

This was truly strange. Even though his Soul was damaged and he didn’t dare to simply use his Divine Sense, his eyesight still can’t be so poor to the extent where he couldn’t even see how someone disappeared.

“You old dog, you really want to fight with this Young Master?” Yang Kai’s aura turned violent as half of his body was soon soaking wet from the golden blood. Rather than instilling fear, this wound only seemed to have inspired a ferocity in Yang Kai, causing his entire aura to fluctuate like a vicious trapped beast.

Yao Chang Jun’s heart jumped for some reason. He had the faint sense that something bad would happen if he were to force this boy into a corner. He couldn’t explain where this feeling was coming from, but it gave him the chills.

But there was no turning back. He had already wounded Yang Kai so nothing he said would help now. If he suddenly stopped, wouldn’t he be admitting that he was afraid of him?

“Not bad, you little brat. To be able to dodge a blow from this Old Master is already enough to make you a dragon amongst men! The Heavens have good virtue and this Old Master is also appreciative of a talented man, so I’ll give you one last chance. Hand over the Heavenly Restoration Lotus obediently and I shall spare you!”

“In your dreams!”

“Very well!” Yao Chang Jun fumed, “Since you are so stubborn, then this Old Master will teach you how to show proper respect!”

He changed his hand posture and his Emperor Qi surged. While suppressing Yang Kai’s movements, his palm surged with the power of the wind and clouds, fiercely thrusting towards Yang Kai.

Yao Chang Jun didn’t hold back with this blow, clearly intending to kill Yang Kai on the spot.

*Hong...*

An explosion rang out. No matter how Yang Kai resisted it, he was still sent flying by that palm. Countless bones in his body were broken and his face was pale. As soon as he opened his mouth, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Hahaha! Little brat, you talk big, but is this all you’ve got? You’ve really disappointed this Old Master!” Seeing Yang Kai’s miserable state, Yao Chang Jun figured that he must have been overthinking things just now. This little brat was merely at the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, so even if he had some special tricks up his sleeve, it was impossible for him to be his opponent. He also had no idea what he was hesitating for just now. If he had made a move earlier, then he could have killed this boy long ago.

[How shameful! To think I was disturbed by a few words from this little brat. Sure enough, these are the drawbacks left behind from the damage I sustained to my Soul], Yao Chang Jun silently thought to himself.

Fortunately, his opponent was only a Third-Order Dao Source realm boy. If Yang Kai was as strong as him, then he truly would have to suffer.
