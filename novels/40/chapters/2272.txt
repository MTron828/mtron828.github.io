“What? An Emperor Artifact Spirit in human form?”

Yang Kai’s words shocked everyone. All the cultivators stared at the Demonic Artifact Spirit in amazement as a covetous glow flickered in their eyes.

Honestly, just the two words of ‘Emperor Artifact’ were enough to make them drool, but an Emperor Artifact with an Artifact Spirit that could assume human form was something none of them had heard of, much less seen before. In other words, this treasure’s value was inestimable.

*Gudong... *

The sound of gulping filled the air as everyone stared at the Artifact Spirit in enthusiasm and greed, their Divine Senses scanning around, examining whether the condition of the Artifact Spirit was like what Yang Kai said.

After a short while, Qi Shi Hai bellowed, “It really is an Emperor Artifact!”

He could see the outline of the Demonic War Hammer inside the Artifact Spirit’s body, and could clearly feel something similar to Emperor Intent and Emperor Aura hidden within it, not something a Dao Source Realm cultivator could comprehend.

“It’s really an Emperor Artifact...” Although Zhou Wu Hu was still enthusiastic, there was fear and vigilance in his eyes too, “But since it has already assumed human form, I’m afraid that it will be difficult to deal with. Everyone, be careful not to act rashly lest you suffer unintended consequences.”

Hearing what he said, everyone seemed to be splashed with ice water and their excitement gradually cooled down.

Yang Kai glanced at him and laughed, “If you want to achieve great things, you naturally need to take the risks. Since this Sir is so cautious, why don’t you just leave? Why are you still staying here?”

Zhou Wu Hu gave two dry coughs, and replied in embarrassment, “I just want to have a look...”

Yang Kai continued, “Even though this Artifact Spirit has achieved human form, it has been suppressed for countless aeons below the Eighteen Stars Grand Array. It’s now far from its peak, so it’s impossible that it can display the full power of an Emperor Artifact. If anyone is interested in this treasure, follow this Yang in battle. As for whoever this treasure eventually belongs to... that is up to destiny!”

After his speech, he braced himself and swung his Myriads Sword, sending out a rain of Sword Qi blades towards the Artifact Spirit.

Seeing him taking the initiative, the rest of the gathered cultivators could not help joining in.

Everyone knew that there was a certain risk in dealing with an Emperor Artifact that had assumed human form, but not many people could remain unmoved before such a huge temptation.

On the spur of that moment, all the cultivators pushed their Source Qi and executed their Secret Techniques and Martial Skills one after another, flooding the underground cavern with colourful bursts of light.

The disciples from Eight Paths Sect were also eager to make a move, but when they saw Luo Yuan standing to the side, choosing not to intervene, they stayed their hands and remained anxious on the spot, observing the situation quietly.

*Hong Hong Hong... *

Brilliance flashed as several dozen Dao Source Realm cultivators bombarded the place where the Artifact Spirit stood, causing the internal situation to be unclear to them, even using their Divine Senses.

“Did it die?”

“There’s no movement at all, is it really dead?”

Everyone craned their necks and looked towards where the Artifact Spirit stood with expectation and excitement, waiting for the results.

The lights gradually dissipated and the turbulent flow of power slowly calmed down, but everyone’s heart sank when they saw the scene before them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Demonic Artifact Spirit was standing silently in the same place, its radiance slightly dimmer than before, but showing no signs of significant damage. Instead, being besieged by everyone seemed to arouse its anger and it began viciously sweeping its crimson eyes full of cruelty and ferocity over the surroundings, seemingly trying to remember all its enemies’ faces. When they were being glared at, everyone felt an inexplicably chill, as if they heard the call of death.

“After taking so many attacks, it’s unharmed? Is this Artifact Spirit indestructible?”

“How can we fight this?”

“Young Master Yang, the situation seems a little different from what you said... “

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “Did you guys use your full strength? The consciousness of this Artifact Spirit doesn’t seem high, what’s more, it has been suppressed for tens of thousands of years. It shouldn’t still be very powerful!”

“Ahem ahem...” Everyone showed an embarrassed look on their face after this comment.

No one had actually given it their all just now as everyone wanted to save some strength in order to snatch the Emperor Artifact when the Artifact Spirit was exterminated. However, none expected that all their blows would wind up in vain, leading to the current situation, one they felt a bit uncomfortable about after Yang Kai exposed them.

“Oh no... quickly act! It’s preparing to attack!” Yang Kai suddenly changed his expression and shouted.

The Demonic Artifact Spirit stretched out its hand and clenched the void, summoning a black War Hammer into its grip. This War Hammer looked exactly the same as the one that Yang Kai saw in its body previously and was obviously the Artifact Spirit’s original form. Various mysterious runes swam across its surface, emitting a profound and mysterious aura.

An extremely dangerous aura emerged from the War Hammer.

Inexplicably, everyone felt like they had been plunged into a blizzard at this moment, chills running up their spines.

From afar, Luo Yuan’s pupils contracted abruptly as he realized the situation was becoming dangerous, shouting out to his fellow Eight Paths Sect disciples, “Retreat! All of you!”

As soon as he finished, he instantly moved atop the Artifact Spirit’s head using a profound Movement Skill and performed a series of hand seals, pushing his Source Qi madly as he shouted, “Blazing Sun Golden Wheel!”

A small red flaming wheel abruptly formed between his hands, causing the temperature of the underground cavern to rise rapidly, sending a wave of hot air across everyone’s skin.

All present could sense a massive killing power contained in this Secret Technique and they couldn’t help gazing towards Luo Yuan with faintly pale faces.

The small sun in Luo Yuan’s hand immediately began to fall towards the Artifact Spirit, but before it could land, the Artifact Spirit roared, sensing danger as it pushed its black Qi vigorously.

“What the hell are you all doing?! Attack now!” Yang Kai bellowed as he rushed in front of the Artifact Spirit and swung his Myriads Sword at it directly.

Only then did the other cultivators regain their consciousness and once again execute their Secret Techniques and Martial Skills one after another, sending blow after blow towards the Artifact Spirit.

This time, they did not dare to hold back anymore and instead went all out, causing the scene to be several times brighter and grander than before.

Even if it was a true Emperor Realm Master here, it would still be impossible for them to take so many attacks head-on. They could only withdraw in the face of such an onslaught.

However, the Artifact Spirit remained unstirred. It was uncertain if its consciousness was too low or if it had extremely high confidence in itself, but as it was being bombarded, it simply raised its War Hammer high, causing the flowing runes on its surface to flash wildly.

Principle Strength burst forth, forming an invisible force that covered the entire underground cavern.

In the next instant, the Artifact Spirit fiercely smashed its hammer down.

The hammer impacted space itself, shattering it and creating a giant black hole.

The shocking force seemed to have crossed the barrier of space, striking the hearts of every attacking cultivator.

*Pu pu pu... *

With one blow, all the incoming attacks were annihilated and most of the cultivators present were made to cough up blood. Being knocked back and sent flying, everyone wore distressed looks as their vitality tumbled.

Luo Yuan also grunted as his Blazing Sun Golden Wheel collapsed by itself and failed to injure the Artifact Spirit.

It was the same for Yang Kai. An invisible barrier suddenly formed in front of the Myriads Sword, preventing him from delivering his blow to the Artifact Spirit. The next moment, a huge force from that barrier struck him.

*Pu... *

Yang Kai vomited Golden Blood and flew back like a rag sack, damaging his already weakened body.

*Hong Hong Hong... *

The sound of explosions rang out all around as the ground and cavern walls cracked. Gravel of all sizes fell from above and all eighteen Spirit Springs were affected by the aftershock, boiling and erupting all at once. The underground space became even more unstable due to the impact and there were now signs of it collapsing at any time.

“Oh no, this place is coming down.”

“Run!”

“Little brat surnamed Yang, this is all your fault! If I die, I will not let you off even as a ghost!” Someone yelled while escaping.

Yang Kai wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and shouted back, “Men die for wealth, birds die for food. You made your choice so you should bear the consequences yourself. I instigated you? If I asked you to eat shit, would you do it?”

“Bastard!” That person bellowed angrily but dared not to stay any longer, running away desperately.

At this point, the underground was bustling with everyone busy running for their lives.

Yang Kai intended to put Hua Qing Si and the others back into the Sealed World bead, but when he saw the Artifact Spirit glaring at him like prey, he could only order with his teeth gritted, “Leave by yourselves!”

As his words fell, Yang Kai immediately rushed in a certain direction.

The Artifact Spirit chased closely after him without hesitation.

A short while later, followed by a huge crumbling sound, the Earth caved in and a huge pit suddenly appeared in this wilderness two thousand kilometres away from Maplewood City. Liquid World Energy began to fill this pit, forming a kind of small Spirit Lake.

*Xiu xiu xiu... *

Rays of light burst out from the ground as cultivators who were down below fled out with lingering fears, their faces paled.

In a certain direction, the Artifact Spirit was chasing after Yang Kai, moving like lightning.

“Hahahaha! There was a path to Heaven but you refused it and chose Hell instead. Left and Right Protectors, listen to my orders, bring that brat to me! This Young Master is going to teach him some proper manners!” A burst of arrogant laughter came out from the front.

Yang Kai looked ahead and found that three figures were standing there, Ning Yuan Shu, Gao Shan, and Liu Shui, the trio from Flying Saint Palace.

Apparently, they did not leave but stayed here. Though, it was most likely that they were afraid of Luo Yuan, so they did not go deeper into the underground where the Spirit Springs were located, they continued to wander around outside.

Seeing the sight of Yang Kai at this time, Ning Yuan Shu was overjoyed. When he gave the order, he showed a ferocious grin on his face, his eyes filled with hatred and grudge.

Earlier, Yang Kai had slapped his face in front of everyone, giving him the greatest humiliation of his life, so he secretly swore vengeance on Yang Kai and just when he was worried about Yang Kai’s location, he appeared by himself.

Although the two Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, suffered a small loss at Luo Yuan’s hands, that did not mean that they could not take down Yang Kai.

Ning Yuan Shu was very confident in the strength of these two Protectors.

“Little brat, you heard what the Young Palace Master said! Crawl over here obediently if you are smart. This Old Master doesn’t want to lay his hand on you, lest he gets a bad name for bullying the weak!” Gao Shan stared coldly at Yang Kai.

Liu Shui continued, “It’s time you surrender yourself. The strength of these two Old Masters is beyond your capability to resist, do so and your efforts will only end in vain!”
