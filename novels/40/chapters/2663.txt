Ying Fei and Xi Lei’s jaws dropped, looking at Xie Wu Wei dumbfoundedly.

They knew what was going on.

Xie Wu Wei was indeed marked by a Soul Imprint, meaning he really was Yang Kai’s Soul Slave.

But… When did this happen? The three Monster Kings had been together all this time and they did not realize any unusual changes.

Xie Wu Wei retracted the golden light and smiled faintly, “This Xie had long surrendered to him since the last time Young Master Yang entered the Ancient Lands. He is in total control of this Xie’s life. If anything happened to Young Master Yang, this Xie would die as well, so this Xie’s loyalty and dedication to Young Master Yang is beyond question. How can the both of you compare with me?”

Xie Wu Wei, who was a Monster King, had actually become a Soul Slave; however, he was proud instead of ashamed of this fact! If an outsider who did not know the truth witnessed this, their eyes would definitely pop out from their sockets.

But being Yang Kai’s Soul Slave was a great deal in Ying Fei and Xi Lei’s eyes too, and they silently cursed Xie Wu Wei in their hearts.

If Xie Wu Wei had such a relationship with Yang Kai, there would be no doubt that Xie Wu Wei would be the one to stay back with Yang Kai.

For a moment, Xi Lei and Ying Fei looked at Yang Kai helplessly.

Yang Kai smiled bitterly. Back then in the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb of the Ancient Lands, he was forced to take Xie Wu Wei as his Soul Slave in order to protect himself, and Xie Wu Wei had also been very unwilling to accept such a fate at the time. After they came out of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, Xie Wu Wei was neither friendly nor aloof with Yang Kai, for he was afraid that others would look down on him because of this unusual relationship.

Now though, he actually took the initiative to disclose such information just to gain a slight upper hand in this argument.

It was worth mentioning that the change in his attitude was quite funny. Yang Kai did not think that he was a person who was eager for quick success and instant benefits, but after all, the cultivation of these Monster Kings had reached a plateau, and their only hope to progress was to rely on the secrets of the Blood Gate.

Who would not try hard to grab the only opportunity in front of them?

Just when Xie Wu Wei was being jaunty and triumphant in front of the other two Monster Kings, Yang Kai suddenly waved his hand and a wisp of golden light flew out directly from Xie Wu Wei’s forehead and returned to Yang Kai.

Xie Wu Wei’s smug face instantly went stiff. The shackles on him were lifted, but what followed was not joy. He put on a long face and cried, “Young Master Yang, you…”

The Soul Imprint was retrieved, which meant that the connection of his Soul to Yang Kai’s was cut off, and he was no longer Yang Kai’s Soul Slave. He had recovered his freedom.

Xie Wu Wei did not expect that Yang Kai would be so decisive in doing so.

If it was anyone else, they would not simply let go of such a powerful Soul Slave. They would certainly keep him to serve themselves, but Yang Kai just disposed of him like nothing. The generosity Yang Kai displayed was out of the ordinary.

“Hahahaha!” Both Ying Fei and Xi Lei burst into laughter, their eyes lighting up when they realized what had happened as they secretly cheered, [Who asked Xie Wu Wei to boast so shamelessly? This is your karma! You deserve it!]

“Young Master Yang, you can’t do this…” Xie Wu Wei looked at Yang Kai with grief, as if Yang Kai had thoughtlessly abandoned him after using him.

Yang Kai swung his hand impatiently, “Leave, leave. All of you leave.”

“Do we really have to leave?” Xi Lei looked sad and was quite reluctant to go.

Yang Kai explained, “Don’t accuse me of driving you all away after using you; after all, you three are Monster Kings of the Ancient Lands, and your superiors are the Divine Venerables. If I retained you all without informing them, it would really be hard for me to explain it to them. In any case, it’s now convenient for me to come and go from the Ancient Lands, so if I ever have need of help in the future, I’ll look for the three of you.”

The three Monster Kings’ moods were elevated at Yang Kai’s words and they nodded one after another, “Young Master Yang must keep his word. When the time comes, don’t call others, just us.”

There were thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings in the Ancient Lands, and all of them were first-class Masters. They did not want the other Monster Kings and Great Kings to build a good relationship with Yang Kai and tried to prevent that by hoping to stay by Yang Kai’s side.

“I know!” Yang Kai promised as he continued swinging his hand like he was chasing flies away.

Only then did the three Monster Kings slowly step onto the Space Array.

Yang Kai casually inserted Source Crystals into the array and a moment later, he glanced at the three and asked, “Are you ready?”

The three Monster Kings nodded and cupped their fists, “Take care, Young Master Yang.”

Their unwillingness to leave could be heard in their voices, as if they were parting forever with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grunted in response and bellowed, “Go!”

He poured his Emperor Qi into the Space Array as he spoke.

Strangely though, nothing happened. Yang Kai and the three Monster Kings stared at each other for a long time, exchanging bewildered looks.

“Huh?” Yang Kai was stunned, scratching his head as he tried the Space Array again and again, but to no avail.

The three Monster Kings exchanged looks, getting excited again. Ying Fei beamed, “It seems even the Heavens don’t want us to leave.”

Xie Wu Wei immediately echoed, “Yes, yes, Young Master Yang, since the Heavens have such intentions, you don’t have to insist anymore!”

“What happened?” Yang Kai was puzzled, checking the Space Array thoroughly. Even though he just set this up, there should be no errors in it.

After a thorough investigation, he confirmed that the Space Array was in perfect condition.

Xi Lei questioned, “Young Master Yang, is it because this Space Array cannot connect to the Ancient Lands? We were directly teleported from Ancient Lands to Ice Heart Valley the last time.”

“Impossible!” Yang Kai shook his head. The Space Arrays that he set were all connected to each other. In other words, the array in High Heaven Palace should be connected not only to Ice Heart Valley, but also to the Ancient Wild Lands.

While Yang Kai was still flabbergasted, a light suddenly burst out on the Space Array, followed by the emergence of two figures.

Everyone took a closer look, and realized that it was Ji Yao and Nanmen Da Jun.

After the teleportation, both of them seemed to have a brief vertigo, but soon, Ji Yao regained her senses while Nanmen Da Jun took a little more time to recover, since his cultivation was weaker than hers.

“Senior Brother Yang, I’ve brought him to you,” Ji Yao glanced at Yang Kai as she spoke softly.

Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgement before turning to look at Nanmen Da Jun. The latter met his eyes and immediately became excited, “Grandmaster Yang, I heard that you are looking for me.”

Ever since he saw the Space Array that was arranged by Yang Kai, the latter’s position in his heart has risen to the level of a pinnacle Array Grandmaster, and Nanmen Da Jun believed that he was even more learned in this Dao than himself.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, then he questioned, “But didn’t I say that you should repair Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array first before coming here? Why did you come so soon?”

Nanmen Da Jun replied, “I’ve finished the repairs on that side. I heard that Grandmaster Yang was calling for me, so this Nanmen worked day and night to accomplish his task and then immediately rushed here right after.”

While speaking, he showed an obsequious face.

“Don’t tell me you only did a patchwork job?” Yang Kai looked at him incredulously.

Repairing Ice Heart Valley Sect Defending Array was a massive project, so how could it be done completely in just a few days?

Nanmen Da Jun explained in fear, “This Nanmen dares not! Grandmaster Yang is also proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, so this Nanmen doesn’t have the guts to show off his meagre skills before an expert! The reason why it could be repaired so fast was because this Nanmen had studied Ice Heart Valley Sect Defending Array comprehensively for the past few months. Moreover, this Nanmen was also the one who suggested the array breaking method, so this Nanmen only had to reverse the damage done and was able to finish the repairs in just a short time.”

“I see,” Yang Kai did not doubt him, but replied solemnly, “I will go back to Ice Heart Valley to check later. If the Sect Defending Array’s repairs are shoddy in any way, you will have to watch out for your head!”

“Don’t worry, Grandmaster Yang,” Nanmen Da Jun assured him.

After a pause, he continued, “By the way, why did Grandmaster Yang summon this Nanmen here in such a rush? What can this Nanmen do for you?”

Yang Kai beckoned him, “Have a look at this place.”

Nanmen Da Jun turned around to have a look before he gasped softly and soared up into the air to get a clearer view. When he returned, he asked with surprise, “Isn’t this Seeking Passion Sect?”

He had been a guest of Seeking Passion Sect for some time recently, so he naturally recognized this land. However, when he was here last this place was crowded with outstanding people, but now, even though the scenery remained, the people were no longer here.

He could not help feeling sorry for the tens of thousands of years of heritage of the Seeking Passion Great Emperor that had been abandoned here.

“It used to be the Seeking Passion Sect, but now it is High Heaven Palace!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Ji Yao’s eyes flashed at Yang Kai’s words, revealing a thoughtful look on her face as though she seemed to have guessed something.

Yang Kai pressed on, “I want you to reopen the Sect Defending Array here, then repair and improve it. Display all of your abilities here to ensure that this Sect Defending Array is second to none in the Star Boundary.”

Nanmen Da Jun was hyped up listening to it, as if he had received an awakening challenge.

Yang Kai read his face and secretly nodded, extremely satisfied with his reaction.

“Grandmaster Yang is planning to occupy this land?” Nanmen Da Jun caught up very fast and guessed the intention of Yang Kai correctly.

“Good.” Yang Kai admitted with a nod, “How long will it take to complete such a project?”

Nanmen Da Jun did not reply immediately, but pondered seriously for a moment before he answered, “The Sect Defending Array of Seeking Passion Sect was not destroyed, just deactivated. This Nanmen needs to study the array charts and composition in detail, only then can I come up with a method of improvement. It could take as little as two months, or as long as three months, but this Nanmen will definitely give Grandmaster Yang a satisfactory result.”

“Good, I’ll give you three months then,” Yang Kai agreed without hesitation.

Nanmen Da Jun continued, “But in order to set up and improve such a huge array, some materials would be needed…” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You can make a list of any materials you require and I will provide them for you,” Yang Kai assured him.

Now that he had plundered so much wealth, and even emptied the Treasury of Seeking Passion Sect, he certainly had the materials to improve the Sect Defending Array here.

Nanmen Da Jun beamed from ear to ear, “It’s easy if I have the materials. Right, does Grandmaster Yang want to do this together with this Nanmen…”

Yang Kai interjected with a deep voice, “This Young Master is about to be very busy and cannot share the burden with you. You will have to deal with it alone. If you need any assistance…” He turned to look at Ji Yao.

Ji Yao immediately understood and answered, “Leave that to me. I’ll summon some sisters over from the Sect.”
