Chi Gui replied to the fat man, “It was because I noticed the abnormality that I came over to see the situation.”

The fat man revealed, “It’s the same for us!”

Chi Gui was stunned. He glanced at the Emperor’s Realm Master surrounded by Black Qi, asking, “Could it be you, Yao Si, who did this?”

This made Yao Si, the aforementioned Emperor Realm Master, snort coldly, “Why do you think it was me?”

“I just guessed…” Chi Gui sniffed.

The burly young man said in a deep voice, “It’s not Brother Yao Si’s problem. The Source Strength in the Source Sea flowed in this direction. This island seems to be the source of the problem.”

As soon as this statement came out, five pairs of eyes looked at Yang Kai together.

“Why are you looking at me? I don’t even know what you are talking about. What happened? Why are you not absorbing and refining the Source Strength at your own place, but came here to me?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

The brawny young man frowned, “The Source Strength in the Source Sea has been greatly reduced over the past half a month, and the flow of Source Strength pointed to this place. What do you think we are here for?”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened, revealing a harmless expression as he asked in shock, “Really? No way?!”

He sounded quite insincere. The reduction and flow of Source Strength was undeniable, and despite Yang Kai just being a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, even someone with lower cultivation should have been able to sense this. However, it was too obvious from his look of bewilderment that he was putting on an act. Though from his expression, he did not seem to be lying, especially the look in his eyes which was clear and bright, without a hint of deception. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The five people began to doubt themselves, wondering if they were wrong about Yang Kai.

Strangely, the flow and reduction of Source Qi did stop just now.

“Does this really have nothing to do with you?” Chi Gui frowned.

“I am just a Dao Source Realm, how could I have done such a thing right under all of your noses? If the Source Strength reduction here was caused by something, it has nothing to do with me, it’s definitely one of you. One of you did it and tried to blame it on me! You can’t be so mean! Whoever did this should reveal himself!” Yang Kai refuted.

The doubt in their hearts was strengthened by the justification and solemnity in his tone. It was agreed that the source of the problem was on this island, but Yang Kai was right. How could he, a Dao Source Realm cultivator, do such a thing?

The brawny young man said thoughtfully, “The abnormality of the Source Sea began half a month ago. It wasn’t very obvious at first, but it became more apparent after this boy arrived here.”

Hearing what he had said, the other four looked at Yang Kai with suspicious expressions again.

After all, the timing was too coincidental.

“You can eat anything you want, but you cannot say anything you please!” Yang Kai glared at him, “If this friend speaks nonsense again, I’ll not be polite to you.”

“You will not be polite to me?” The brawny young man’s eyes widened into circles, as if hearing the funniest joke in the world and grinned, “I am interested to see how you are going to be impolite to me.”

He was also an Emperor Realm Master. Although Yang Kai took his blow rather well earlier, he really did not think Yang Kai was a match for him.

If there was really a battle to the death here, he believed that he would be able to take Yang Kai down in three moves.

“That’s enough. Since the problem is not from here, there must be some unusual change in the Source Sea.” For some reason, Wu Chang stood up and put an end to the dispute, which was a relief for Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glanced at him with distrust, but Wu Chang ignored it and continued, “Instead of getting entangled here without any proof, it is better to go back and continue absorbing and refining. Although the Source Sea has been reduced a lot, it hasn’t completely disappeared yet, I believe it’s still enough to meet everyone’s needs.”

The fat man nodded, “En, that’s right.”

The brawny young man and Chi Gui could not think of a better idea, but Yao Si, the son of a Great Emperor, had other ideas, “Boy, whether or not the changes in the Source Sea were caused by you, you must leave this place now. This is the territory for Emperor Realm Masters. You are not qualified to set foot in this place with your current strength!”

Yang Kai turned to glance at him before sneering softly, “Who are you to say that I’m not qualified? Have you asked for my opinion?”

Yang Kai naturally would not leave cooperatively as Yao Si wanted. Although he had scraped a lot of Source Strength from the Source Sea already, there was still a lot left. The World Principles in his Sealed World Bead had not been perfect yet, the Embodiment showed no signs of breaking through to the Emperor Realm, and he did not even sense the opportunity of a breakthrough himself. Wouldn’t it be a failure to leave at this time?

Yao Si narrowed his eyes and glowered coldly, “Either leave or die! I’ll give you three breaths to pick!”

“You can try!” Yang Kai looked sideways at him.

Everyone was flabbergasted, looking at Yang Kai with amazement.

Such an attitude would still make sense if it were another newly-promoted Emperor Realm Master, but Yang Kai was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so while he seemed to have exceedingly high strength and amazing potential, who was Yao Si? He was the son of a Great Emperor!

The descendant of the Serene Soul Great Emperor from the Eastern Territory!

All the Emperor Realm Masters present were afraid of him and had to give him face. Although they would not be timid in front of him, no one dared to talk back to him like this.

But Yang Kai openly challenged him!

This boy had the confidence to talk back to the son of a Great Emperor in such a tone.

That brawny young man realised that this brat was an idiot and couldn’t help feeling baffled at how he himself wanted to engage in a fight with this fool just now. He shook his head slowly, thinking that Yang Kai was bound to die this time. If he was the one Yang Kai offended, Yang Kai would not end up dead. At best, he would just give Yang Kai a severe lesson, but if he offended Yao Si, he would definitely end up dead.

Wu Chang’s expression also changed slightly, but he didn’t say much. He had just spoken out to help Yang Kai get out of trouble, because they were both from the Southern Territory. He could compete with Yang Kai as much as he wanted in the Southern Territory, as that would be considered an internal struggle, and they could even fight to the death if they wished, but in front of the Masters of the other three territories in the Shattered Star Sea, he could not sit back and watch Yang Kai getting bullied.

But now he discovered that Yang Kai was simply unreasonable. What good could come out of it for provoking the son of a Great Emperor like this?

An unbending tree is easily broken; this little brat was simply too young and aggressive.

Suddenly, the air became stagnant and even the void began to fill with a frigid murderous intent.

Yao Si looked at Yang Kai faintly, his eyes cold, as if he was looking at a dead person, but to his surprise, Yang Kai showed no fear and met his gaze head-on.

Yao Si’s face darkened as he prepared to strike Yang Kai, but at the critical moment, a streak of light flew over from the distance and arrived above everyone’s head.

Everyone squinted up into the sky, wondering who this rude newcomer was.

The flash of light dissipated, revealing a burly middle-aged man.

He stared down with wide, glowing eyes, his expression extremely eager, as if he were a starving beast that had finally seen its prey after countless years.

But soon, he trembled, his face stiffened, and he gulped hard.

The six people below glared up at him, and five of them were Emperor Realm Masters!

He had rushed over here feeling extremely excited, but had never anticipated such a scene to be waiting for him; he almost turned around and escaped in fear at the mere sight.

Although he was not too concerned about an ordinary Emperor Realm cultivator, there were five of them here, so if they really fought, he would definitely not be their match.

“Hm?” Yang Kai muttered in surprise as he saw this newcomer, but soon a joyful look filled his face.

Shockingly, he knew the person who came. He had planned to look for this person after the Shattered Star Sea closed, but now he had actually shown up here.

It was Wu Meng Chuan!

The Sect Master of Blue Feather Sect, a descendant of Heaven Devouring Great Emperor!

Wu Meng Chuan was the one who passed the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to Yang Kai, but Yang Kai never dared to cultivate it and instead handed it over to the Embodiment, who accepted it delightedly, resulting in his rapidly improving cultivation.

However, the Embodiment had reached a bottleneck in his cultivation, probably due to some flaw in the Secret Art. Perhaps the Heaven Devouring Battle Law passed down to Yang Kai by Wu Meng Chuan back then was incomplete.

The reason Yang Kai planned to seek for Wu Meng Chuan was to inquire about the Heaven Devouring Battle Law and to get the complete Secret Art from him, otherwise, the cultivation of the Embodiment would most likely remain stagnant.

Back then, Yang Kai only had a Third-Order Origin King cultivation and was no match for Wu Meng Chuan, but now, he was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so there was no need to fear him anymore.

The two of them had different thoughts, but both were extremely surprised to encounter each other here.

“Well what do we have here,” the brawny young man spat disdainfully at the discovery that Wu Meng Chuan was also a Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

Previously, he only permitted Yang Kai to come in because he took his blow without suffering a loss. Now, he did not want to waste time and energy on Yang Kai as he was eager to absorb and refine the remaining Source Strength here; however, before he could do so, another Dao Source Realm cultivator had invaded the territory of the Emperor Realm Masters.

“Just kill him!” Chi Gui snorted coldly.

Wu Meng Chuan was appalled. Although he did not know what these six people were doing there, the extremely hostile look in the eyes of the five Emperors was evident. Quickly wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, Wu Meng Chuan apologized, “Sorry, sorry, this one has broken into the precious land by mistake. This one will retreat, please calm your anger.”

He glanced at Yang Kai involuntarily as he spoke before turning around and trying to leave with a strange expression on his face.

He recognized Yang Kai, and he still remembered teaching Yang Kai the Heaven Devouring Battle Law in the Bone Prison back then, but upon examining him up close, he could not detect any traces of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law from Yang Kai.

This greatly puzzled Wu Meng Chuan.

He sensed the wave of the matured seed emanating from here, but when he hurried to the place, the wave disappeared, and he encountered Yang Kai instead.

He was at a loss of what happened.
