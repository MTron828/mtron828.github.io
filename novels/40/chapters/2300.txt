Upon checking the young girl with their Divine Senses, the two men discovered that she was just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator. They then exchanged a glance and could clearly see the eagerness apparent in each other’s eyes.

One of the two men, a slightly fat cultivator, revealed a friendly-looking smile and asked in a soft voice, “Little girl, what’s wrong? Did you... Get lost? Hehehe...”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing’s pretty eyes lit up and she looked in surprise at the fat cultivator, then spoke, “How did you know? I have gotten lost and don’t know how to get back home.”

“Huh?” The fat cultivator was taken aback. He had just blurted out whatever came into his mind, yet it actually hit the nail on the head. Besides, the young girl looked so delighted and innocent that it was obvious she wasn’t putting on an act.

He quickly understood that the young girl in front of him was the kind of sheltered flower that rarely left her home and she didn’t know the ways of the world. He just let out a cough and put on a compassionate look, “Young Lady, don’t be afraid, no one will hurt you with us here.”

Luo Bing wiped her tears, then broke into a smile, as if she had just been relieved from a heavy burden, “That’s great, I knew there was still hope.”

As she smiled, she looked like a beautiful blossoming flower, and the two cultivators couldn’t avert their eyes from her, gulping as their bodies started heating up.

“You two, hurry up and send me home. Once I get back home, I’ll reward you generously,” Luo Bing quickly recovered her bossy attitude and she started yelling at the two cultivators.

The two men exchanged a glance, and the thinner one said with a smile, “Understood, we’ll send you back home. Young Lady, please follow us.”

Luo Bing nodded and waved her hand, “Lead the way!”

She didn’t even bother asking them whether they knew her or the location of her home and she just followed after them.

Those two men also didn’t plan to engage in any conversion with her, and they just walked forward in silence.

Luo Bing’s mood quickly turned for the better, and she forgot all the mishaps she had just suffered. She had even started humming a tune like a happy little bird.

After the time it would take to brew a cup of tea, Luo Bing suddenly realized that something was off and she stopped in her tracks. When she turned her head and looked around, she noticed that this area was even more deserted and she couldn’t see a single soul here. The houses here were all in ruins with many broken walls left behind, as if it was a ghost town. She was a little intimidated by this and she spoke in a shivering voice, “What... What is this place? Didn’t I ask you to bring me back home... Why did you bring me here?”

Upon hearing this, the two cultivators in front of her stopped and turned their heads around to gaze at her, letting out sinister laughter.

Even if Luo Bing wasn’t the brightest, she still realized by now that something was amiss. She quickly realized that these two men were anything but good-hearted and that they never planned to bring her home.

“You... What do you want to do?” Luo Bing’s face turned pale from fright and she started moving back, stumbling on something and losing her balance, falling on her butt.

Fright and pain overwhelmed her fragile heart and she started weeping on the spot.

“Heh heh heh...” The fat cultivator sneered and approached Luo Bing step by step, his looming figure putting a lot of pressure on Luo Bing’s fragile nerves, causing her heart to start beating loudly, like it was trying to leap out of her chest.

“I... I’m warning you... don’t... don’t you dare come closer, or else... or else, you’ll pay for it!” Luo Bing bit her rosy lips and assembled the best words she could to threaten them.

But, matters had already developed up to here, so how could those two people just give up?

The thin cultivator said with a smile, “Little girl, you’re pretty interesting, do your parents know how naive you are?”

The fat cultivator let out lecherous laughter, “Scream all you want, even if you shout yourself hoarse, no one will come for you.”

Saying so, the fat cultivator jumped at Luo Bing and stretched his hand toward her fair neck.

Luo Bing cried out in fright and pushed her palms forward, summoning up her Saint Qi. She had unexpectedly launched a strike with pretty considerable might.

But in the end, she was just a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator, and she had never been fond of cultivating. She had only gotten to her current realm thanks to a large supply of precious treasures, causing her Saint Qi to be impure and her techniques to be quite sloppy.

As for the fat and thin cultivators, they were both Origin Kings, so facing this messy strike, the fat cultivator simply waved his hand to casually disperse it before he swiftly slapped Luo Bing’s shoulder.

Luo Bing fell weakly to the ground and she couldn’t summon up even a little bit of strength. Her cultivation had been sealed and she could only look on helplessly as the fat cultivator pulled off her belt and started removing her clothes.

“Don’t... Please don’t...” Luo Bing started entreating him in sobs.

The fat cultivator’s most vile desires were only stimulated by Luo Bing’s cries though. He couldn’t help letting out a hot snort from his nose as he gulped hard, his eyes flashing as he muttered, “Her voice is so alluring! The Heavens have not forsaken us, sending us such a beauty!”

The body of the thin cultivator had also started heating up and he jumped toward Luo Bing then pinched her face repeatedly, saying, “Her skin is so soft, I wonder which family this little girl is from? Hehe, we struck it lucky this time!”

Upon hearing this, Luo Bing suddenly found newfound strength and shouted, “I’m the daughter of the City Lord! Hurry up and let go of me! If my father learns of this, you’ll both die miserably!”

After she said so, the body of the fat and thin cultivators stiffened and their faces turned deathly pale.

Cold sweat started dripping down the fat cultivator’s forehead and it wouldn’t stop no matter how much he wiped it off. He muttered in a bitter voice, “No... It can’t be... The City Lord’s daughter?”

Fright was also apparent on the thin cultivator’s face as he stared at Luo Bing and stuttered, “What... What’s your name?”

Luo Bing looked at them coldly and spoke through gnashed teeth, “Luo Bing!”

Upon hearing this, a chill ran down the two cultivators’ spines and they couldn’t help trembling. The fat cultivator started sizing up Luo Bing earnestly before he spoke haltingly, “She... She really does look like the Young Lady of the City Lord’s Mansion, I have seen her once from afar...”

“We’re done for... done for...” The thin cultivator couldn’t take this heavy blow and he started muttering to himself. He had even fallen on his butt with a dispirited look on his face.

The body of the fat cultivator shivered intensely and he quickly pulled back his hands, which were trying to take off Luo Bing’s clothes, then gazed at Luo Bing, and tried to squeeze out a fawning smile, yet couldn’t do so, his expression even more unsightly than a crying face.

After they learned that she was the daughter of the City Lord, they were both scared witless.

They assumed that Luo Bing was just an ordinary girl that got lost and never dreamed she had such a huge background. If they had known earlier, then they wouldn’t have dared to do this. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Upon seeing this, Luo Bing’s eyes lit up and she shouted, “You’re afraid now? If you don’t want to die, then send me back to the City Lord’s Mansion!”

The fat cultivator quickly crawled toward Luo Bing and kowtowed to her so heavily that his head quickly got drenched in blood. “Young Lady Luo, we must have been blind to affront you, please don’t take it to heart and forgive us!”

At this moment, the thin cultivator had also come back to his senses and he crawled in front of her and started kowtowing to her, without forgetting to beg for mercy.

Luo Bing looked in disgust at them then snorted coldly and said, “Send me back to the City Lord’s Mansion and I’ll spare your lives.”

“Are you serious?” Upon hearing this, the fat cultivator rejoiced and he raised his head to look at Luo Bing with relief and delight on his face.

Luo Bing nodded and declared, “I can spare your lives, but you must still be punished for your actions! I also want to punish you properly...” Saying so, she tilted her head sideways and mulled this over for a moment then said, “I’ll ask my father to lock you up for eight or nine years.”

The expression of the fat and thin cultivators turned spectacular and they looked at Luo Bing with odd expressions on their faces.

“What are you looking at? Keep your eyes to yourselves or I’ll gouge them out,” Luo Bing glared viciously at them, as if everything was under her control.

“Big Brother...” The thin cultivator turned to the fat cultivator and said in a low voice, “This girl... Is she messed up in the head?”

If she wasn’t crazy, she would have known not to start threatening them before she got away from them. Any person with a little bit of common sense wouldn’t do this.

The fat cultivator nodded earnestly, “I also think so... The City Lord is so pitiful... He is a great man with an illustrious name, yet he has such a daughter...”

“Then what should we do?”

A vicious glint flashed past the fat cultivator’s eyes and he said in a low voice, “What else can we do? We’ve already come this far, so we can only follow through to the end...” Saying so, a murderous look appeared on his face.

Upon hearing this, the fat cultivator gave it some thought then nodded, “Good... this is the only way...”

The two men’s voices were pretty low, but Luo Bing could still hear them clearly. She assumed that she would shortly get away from them, yet matters didn’t develop as she had expected. Besides, from what they said so far, they didn’t just plan to violate her anymore, they also planned to take her life. She got scared by this and her face turned deathly pale, calling out in a fluster, “What are you planning to do? Don’t do this. If you send me back to the City Lord’s Mansion, I won’t punish you, okay?”

“Too late!” The fat cultivator sneered coldly in response. He had already made up his mind and was no longer afraid. The City Lord was not a person to be trifled with, but they were now in a deserted region, so as long as they cleaned up the scene, any sins they committed could not be traced back to them.

He quickly crawled toward Luo Bing and knelt in front of her. He could clearly smell her sweet maiden fragrance and his body started heating up once more. He spoke in an indistinct voice and leaned closer to her, going after her lips with his large mouth, “She’s so beautiful, if I can have her even once, then I won’t regret dying right after it.”

“No... No!” Luo Bing shook her head repeatedly, as she wanted to avoid his sickening face, but with her cultivation having been sealed and her movements restricted, she could only look on helplessly as his large mouth approached hers.

She could already smell its nasty odour.

Luo Bing’s mind turned blank at that moment. At this precarious juncture, it wasn’t the image of her compassionate father that ran across her mind, nor Qiu Yu who obeyed her every whim, but rather the hateful silhouette of Yang Kai.

[If I wasn’t for him, if it wasn’t for him... Then I wouldn’t have suffered like this...]
