With their Head Manager’s input, Chen Tian Fei and the others quickly focused their eyes towards the sun, and as expected, there really was something inside.

A blurry figure was jumping about in the sun like a living creature. It would occasionally stop to adjust its wings and was exuding a faint ominous aura, giving off an indescribable sense of pressure.

“It looks like a bird of some sort…” Lady Qin furrowed her dark, curvy brows. The sun’s light was too dazzling, so even if she carefully observed it, she couldn’t see what it was.

“There’s something wrong with it though, why does it have three legs?” Chen Tian Fei also had a puzzled look on his face, but as soon as he spoke, his expression suddenly changed.

The Head Manager’s solemn voice rang out from the front, “A three-legged exotic bird, one that is related to the sun. Junior, you are really something, I’ve got to hand it to you. Indeed, each generation gives rise to greater geniuses, hahaha!”

Lady Qin covered her red lips with her hand, causing Bei Yu Shan to be dumbfounded. Even someone as stupid as him had realised what that exotic bird was, let alone the others.

“Three-Legged Golden Crow!” The Ou Yang Brothers shouted in unison.

The Fire Element Yang Kai had refined was not Sun’s True Gold or Sun’s True Fire, but a Golden Crow’s True Fire. When everyone recalled the pitch-black flames surrounding his body and the characteristics of his Manifestation, it undoubtedly proved their speculations.

[It’s the Golden Crow’s True Fire!] This thought caused everyone to jump in fright.

Chen Tian Fei’s body was covered in sweat as he asked in a trembling voice, “Head Manager, what Order is this Golden Crow’s True Fire?”

When they saw Yang Kai condense his Divine Manifestation, they all thought he possessed a Seventh-Order Fire Element Power, but now it seemed it wasn’t just Seventh-Order. The fact that he could refine the Golden Crow’s True Fire meant that Yang Kai had once encountered a Golden Crow, a terrifying existence on par with a True Dragon. Only a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master stood a chance to resist such a terrifying creature. Since this boy had encountered a Golden Crow, why was he not dead? What kind of Heaven-defying opportunity was this?

The Head Manager answered, “That depends on whether the Golden Crow carcass he encountered was a child or fully mature. If it’s the former, it should be a Seventh-Order Golden Crow, if it’s the latter… it should be an Eighth-Order!”

Chen Tian Fei’s body trembled, “I heard that when the Sun Star went out, there was an adult Golden Crow that was on the verge of death that was eventually obtained by First Inn’s Owner. Could it be that this brat refined that adult Golden Crow’s True Fire?”

“Is this news accurate?” The Head Manager turned his head and asked. In recent years, he had constantly been in retreat, cultivating, attempting to break through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so he didn’t know much about current events.

“The news is absolutely accurate,” Chen Tian Fei replied in a serious voice.

The Head Manager gently nodded, “The Golden Crow’s True Fire is hard to come by in ten thousand years. This boy only has an Emperor Realm cultivation, so it shouldn’t be long since he refined his Fire Element. If that’s the case, his Golden Crow’s True Fire might really have come from that Great Golden Crow.”

“Eighth-Order!” Chen Tian Fei’s face was pale as he asked, “Then what does he have to do with First Inn’s Owner?”

The news he received was that First Inn’s Owner had obtained the Golden Crow’s carcass. At that time, many people from the Cave Heavens and Paradises had come to compete for it, and more than one High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master had appeared. First Inn’s branch had been completely destroyed, and in the end, First Inn’s Owner came out on top and had been the one to take away the Golden Crow’s carcass safely.

If Yang Kai had nothing to do with that person, how could he have obtained this Golden Crow’s True Fire?

On this point, the Head Manager was also extremely puzzled. He had never heard of that person having any descendants.

“I don’t think so!” The Head Manager slowly shook his head, “The Eighth-Order Golden Crow’s True Fire is not something that an Emperor Realm Master can withstand. Even if that person obtained the Golden Crow’s carcass, if he were to give it to a junior disciple, the Order of the Golden Crow’s True Fire would definitely be lower, otherwise, it would cause more harm than good.”

“Head Manager is right!” Chen Tian Fei nodded repeatedly. Even so, it was still too frightening.

However, Lady Qin thought of another possibility and muttered, “Since he can refine a Fire Element material of at least Seventh-Order, doesn’t that mean he at least has a Wood Element of Sixth or Seventh-Order?”

If it were just an ordinary Fire Element, it would have been fine. For someone like Meng Hong, who had broken and reconstructed his foundation, he could directly refine a Fifth-Order Sun’s True Fire. There would be no problem as long as his aptitude was good enough and his Dao Seal was firm enough.

However, how terrifying was the Golden Crow’s True Fire? If one didn’t have a strong enough Dao Seal and Wood Element Power to suppress it, their Dao Seal would be instantly incinerated and destroyed. Such a Wood Element Power would have to at least be Sixth-Order, but it was far more likely it was Seventh-Order; otherwise, it would be impossible for Yang Kai to condense the True Fire successfully.

Seventh-Order Wood Element Power and Seventh-Order Fire Element Power, Yang Kai’s intentions were clear. He wanted to become a High-Rank Open Heaven Master in one fell swoop!

“His ambitions are too high, we are truly inferior!” The Head Manager slowly shook his head as his straight figure suddenly became a bit hunched, as if he become dispirited.

As they spoke, the newly formed sun behind Yang Kai completely stabilized, radiating a dazzling light. As the Great Sun Manifestation appeared, the figure that was being forced back by the Defying Heavens Star Net Formation also slowly came to a stop.

A hundred metres away, Luo Qing Yun stared at him in shock.

Yang Kai grinned at him and formed a hand seal, “On this day, the Golden Crow casts the sun. Below the Heavens, above the Earth, only I am supreme!”

The Golden Crow’s cry resounded through the sky, piercing through the world as it flapped its wings in the sun joyfully. Yang Kai’s figure next seemed to merge with the sun before smashing towards the huge sword beam oppressing him in the next moment.

With the might of his newly found Great Sun Manifestation, Yang Kai attacked the Defying Heavens Star Net Formation without fear!

Luo Qing Yun’s face twitched violently as he forcefully recovered from his shock and roared, “So what if you have a Manifestation? Even if the real Golden Crow was before me, I would still kill it for you to see, let alone a mere Manifestation!”

These words were undoubtedly merely meant to bolster his courage. The Defying Heavens Star Net Formation was formed by three hundred people, but even if it was three thousand or thirty thousand people, if they really encountered a Golden Crow, it wouldn’t be enough for them to resist a single breath.

However, when two powerful opponents clash, the braver one held the advantage. Now that things had reached this point, only by advancing courageously would they have a chance of survival.

Sword Qi surged, and the Grand Formation started running at full force as the auras of the three hundred disciples became closely linked. Their strength overlapped as their sword wave surged and collided with the Great Sun.

Two flashes of dazzling light tore through the world, shaking the world.

The strange thing was that when they clashed, it didn’t cause any sound, not even a single clang.

However, in the next moment, the clouds within a radius of ten thousand kilometres vanished and the world trembled violently as an unimaginable shockwave spread out from the point of impact.

The Thunder Light disciples were all sent tumbling while the weaker ones spat out mouthfuls of blood as they fell to the ground, instantly suffering heavy casualties. Zhu Li and Long Tai’s hearts bled as they watched this scene. This was truly a disaster. After this battle, Thunder Light’s foundation would be severely damaged, who knows how many years it would take for them to recover?

Outside the Star City, the defensive Grand Array suddenly flickered, undoubtedly a result of the fallout of Yang Kai and the Sword Pavilion’s battle.

“An Emperor Realm Junior forming a Manifestation!” The Head Manager’s eyes flickered with fear, and his tone carried a sense of disbelief, “With this Manifestation, this child can directly confront a First-Order or Second-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Even a Third-Order Open Realm Master won’t be able to kill him easily!”

No one had ever been able to form a Manifestation in the Emperor Realm before. Since ancient times, even the elite Core Disciples raised in the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to slowly explore and comprehend silently in retreat for years after reaching the Open Heaven Realm before they could produce a Manifestation.

If that weren’t the case, it wouldn’t have been so difficult to produce a Manifestation, but one’s strength would increase dramatically once it was formed. There was a huge difference between a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master with a Manifestation and one without one. It could be said that in a life-or-death battle, a Master with a Manifestation could easily crush one without.

Chen Tian Fei and the others all wore solemn expressions. The Head Manager had always been known for his sharp eye, so since he had said so, it couldn’t be wrong. In other words, the current Yang Kai was equivalent to a First or Second-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!

Such an existence could only be described as invincible in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

If Sword Pavilion didn’t have their Sword Formation, these three hundred people wouldn’t even be enough to fill the gaps between Yang Kai’s teeth.

Even so, the Sword Formation was still being pushed back by the sun’s pressure, and the huge sword beam was shrinking at a speed visible to the naked eye. Its light was gradually dimming.

The Star City was in an uproar.

Whenever Sword Pavilion’s Sword Formation appeared, it had always been invincible, but at this moment, it was not Yang Kai’s opponent!

A single person’s strength was actually this powerful?

“Impossible, how can you be this strong!?” Luo Qing Yun roared as his facial features distorted. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Inside the great sun, Yang Kai’s mocking voice rang out, “It’s just that you’re too weak!”

To be honest, Yang Kai didn’t expect to be able to achieve such a feat. He had been in retreat all the while, trying to comprehend at least one Divine Ability from his refined Elements. Although he had gained some insights, he had felt that he lacked something. Having encountered such a situation today, he had an idea. He wanted to use this life-and-death struggle to stimulate his potential and see if he could break through this shackle and comprehend a Divine Ability.

If that wasn’t the case, how could he be so foolish as to charge into the camp of thousands of people by himself? With Lu Xue in his hands, he could easily have chosen another method to resolve this crisis.

Who would have known that he would stumble upon such a fortune? Not only did Yang Kai comprehend a Divine Ability, but he had also created a Manifestation. Yang Kai still had no idea that he had formed a Manifestation of course, he only thought that this Golden Crow Casts the Sun was a pure Divine Ability.

After all, no one had told him about this before. He hadn’t been in the Outer Universe for long, and although the Proprietress had treated him well, she probably hadn’t expected him to grow so quickly.

At this moment, Yang Kai could clearly feel his strength rising sharply, carrying the power of a true Great Sun. Even if there was a Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master in front of him, Yang Kai could still dare to fight.

“I refuse to accept this!” Luo Qing Yun was enraged and a bloody mist burst out from his body as his aura once again surged. He was the core of the Sword Formation, so his increase in strength bolstered the entire Sword Formation.

Judging from his state, it was obvious that he had used some kind of powerful Secret Technique to temporarily stimulate his potential. Although this Secret Technique was extremely powerful, it was not something that should be casually used. Nonetheless, once it was used, it would bring about endless trouble to the caster.

However, in order to deal with Yang Kai and protect the face of Sword Pavilion, Luo Qing Yun could care less about what came after.

As he did so, the hundreds of disciples in the Sword Formation all let out a muffled groan and suddenly felt an immense pressure weighing down on them. However, the might of the Sword Formation increased dramatically, and in the blink of an eye, it rose to match the Great Sun’s momentum.
