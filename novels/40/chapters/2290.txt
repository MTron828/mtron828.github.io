“Wind Escape!”

At this critical juncture, the Wind-titled cultivator let out a shout and his body flickered, turning into a gust of wind that shortly disappeared and escaped somewhere else. This was a brilliant and profound Escape Technique.

Yang Kai sneered and stretched out his Dragon Claw to grasp the void. A formless power emanated off his claw and it sealed a region with the power of Space Principles.

The Wind-titled cultivator stumbled out, cutting a sorry figure. An astounded look was apparent on his face, as if he didn’t expect that Yang Kai could easily counter his best life-saving technique.

“Ah!” The Thunder-titled cultivator and the Fire-titled cultivator cried out in alarm.

“Die!” Yang Kai shouted and slashed his hand at the Wind-titled cultivator. A large Moon Blade suddenly appeared and shot towards the Wind-titled cultivator in an indomitable imposing manner.

The Wind-titled cultivator’s face suddenly turned pale and he gasped nervously. He had been locked in place by the surrounding Space Principles and couldn’t evade the strike. He could only look on helplessly as death rapidly closed in on him.

“A Mass of Soil Forms a Mountain!” The Mountain-titled cultivator several hundred metres away let out a shout and weaved a series of hand seals. Mt. Xumi appeared once again, precisely between the Moon Blade and the Wind-titled cultivator. A dense aura of the Earth Element emanated from the mountain and drew in rubble and soil towards it. In the blink of an eye, an indestructible barrier was formed in front of the Wind-titled cultivator.

*Hong...*

As the Moon Blade fell upon the earth barrier, it cut a path through it, but it lost most of its power in the process.

At this crucial moment, a crackling noise echoed out and the Thunder-titled cultivator turned into a bolt of lightning, quickly saving the Wind-titled cultivator and escaping away.

Yang Kai’s face fell and he could only look viciously at the Mountain-titled cultivator.

He had been fighting with the members of Blood Dagger for some time now, but each time he gained an advantage, the Mountain-titled cultivator thwarted his attacks. If they weren’t protected by the strong defensive methods of the Mountain-titled cultivator, then the three other members of Blood Dagger wouldn’t be a match for him and they wouldn’t have been able to persist for so long.

Yang Kai realized now that if he wanted to win this battle, he would have to kill the Mountain-titled cultivator first. As long as the latter was in charge of defence, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to kill any of the other three.

Moreover, the Mountain-titled cultivator was connected to the others and was overseeing this region, sealing it off completely, making it impossible for Yang Kai to teleport freely.

As this idea flashed, Yang Kai immediately made up his mind and revealed a profound grin, sneering as he said, “Friends, your means are truly outstanding and have widened my horizons today.”

“Brat, enough talk.” The Fire-titled cultivator had been stunned by Yang Kai’s great power; however, his side still had a numeral advantage so he wasn’t that afraid of him, “You still have a chance to surrender. We may not be able to guarantee your survival if this battle continues.”

The Thunder-titled cultivator gave a nod, “That’s right, if we go all out to kill you, then we won’t be able to complete our superiors’ orders, so just give up and surrender.”

The Wind-titled cultivator didn’t utter a single word as his face was still quite pale. He had just escaped death and was still somewhat unsettled.

“Haha...” Yang Kai sneered again.

The Fire-titled cultivator snorted coldly, “Bluffing again...”

Yang Kai’s smile disappeared and he glared at him coldly then snorted, “Open your eyes wide and see for yourself if I am just bluffing.”

Saying so, he pushed his Spiritual Energy madly and shouted, “Come out!”

As his voice reverberated, a small mountain suddenly appeared above the plain and fell to the ground, shaking it violently while kicking up a massive cloud of dust.

The four members of Blood Daggers were taken aback as they all looked up in confusion at the small mountain. They couldn’t understand what kind of Divine Ability Yang Kai had used and how he managed to summon this mountain.

“What the hell is that?” The Wind-titled cultivator gradually calmed down and he immediately waved his hand impatiently upon looking at the mountain. As a gust of wind blew over the mountain, the dust was cleared and they got a clear look at it.

In the next moment, the members of Blood Dagger stared wide-eyed at the small mountain with stunned looks plastered on their faces.

“Hey... I’m not seeing things, am I?” The Fire-titled cultivator couldn’t help but gulp, “Why does this small mountain look like... A human with four limbs.”

*Gudong!*

The other three people gulped as well as anxious looks filled their faces.

“What the hell is this?” The Wind-titled cultivator cried out in alarm.

“There’s also a woman up there!” The Thunder-titled cultivator’s pupils contracted as he spotted a beautiful figure sitting atop the shoulder of the small mountain.

“An illusion, it must be an illusion!” The Fire-titled cultivator was startled and his face had turned red as he shouted at his companions, “Did that mountain smile at me a moment ago? It must be a goddamn illusion.”

“En, that must be the case!” The Wind-titled cultivator frowned, “This boy must have used an Illusion Technique.”

Saying so, he turned his head to cast a glance at Yang Kai, only to see a meaningful grin appearing on the other side’s face. Upon seeing this look, the Wind-titled cultivator suddenly had a bad feeling fill his heart.

“You should have summoned us long ago,” Hua Qing Si sat atop the Embodiment’s shoulder and swung her legs lightly, curling her lips as she called out, “Why were you even fighting against them alone? You were just wasting time and energy.”

It looked like she had seen the whole fight from the Small Sealed World.

The Embodiment curled his mouth into a smile and spoke in a thunderous voice, “Didn’t we get out already?”

Upon hearing the woman and the mountain talking, the members of Blood Dagger were startled and their faces turned pale. They all felt like everything they could hear and see was real. It was as if the woman and mountain really existed, and they weren’t just some kind of illusion.

Yang Kai chuckled and replied, “I didn’t expect that these four would be this strong. I wanted to test my strength a bit by fighting against them alone.”

“And then you were almost beaten to a pulp,” Hua Qing Si snorted.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he muttered, “It wasn’t that bad... Just a few bruises here and there. Sister Hua, pick one of them.”

Hua Qing Si chuckled and checked the members of Blood Dagger with her pretty eyes before she settled on the Fire-titled cultivator and pointed at him.

“Seems everyone is fond of bullying the weakest one,” Yang Kai laughed involuntarily.

Upon hearing this, the Fire-titled cultivator flew into a rage, “Boy! I’m warning you, if you say I’m the weakest one more, I’ll kill you!”

The Mountain, Thunder, Fire and Wind-titled cultivators had equal power and equal status in Blood Dagger, yet the Fire-titled cultivator had been repeatedly called the weakest by Yang Kai. He had been infuriated by this and felt like Yang Kai looked down on him.

Hua Qing Si said with a smile, “Out of the other three people, one is focusing on defence, while the other two have incredible speed, I don’t want to deal with troublesome characters, so I choose him.”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded

“Then... You’ll be in charge of the Mountain-titled cultivator, alright?” Yang Kai looked at the Embodiment and spoke.

The Embodiment chuckled and replied, “That’s what I was hoping for!”

The Mountain-titled cultivator focused on defence, while the Embodiment was endowed with extraordinary strength but was lacking in speed, so the two were a good match.

“Make your move then!” Yang Kai spoke casually, as if he had just finished picking dishes and placing them on the table and was calling his friends over to ‘have a meal’.

Hua Qing Si chuckled and her body flashed, leaping off the shoulder of the Embodiment and flying towards the Fire-titled cultivator. A glowing Ribbon Artifact appeared in her hands and danced in her fingers.

“Little Brother, let’s play,” Hua Qing Si beckoned at the Fire-titled cultivator enthusiastically.

Upon hearing this, the Fire-titled cultivator’s expression turned solemn and he cast a glance at the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After the Wind-titled cultivator nodded at him, the Fire-titled cultivator pushed his Source Qi to engulf his whole body in flames, setting himself alight. He spoke sharply, “It doesn’t matter if you’re an illusion or not, since you dared to seek me, then prepare to meet your demise. I won’t show any mercy even if you are a woman!”

“Wu, so scary!” Hua Qing Si covered up her rosy lips with her hand and put on a frightened look, calling out sweetly, “Please don’t threaten me, I’m easily frightened...”

“Go to hell!” The Fire-titled cultivator was unmoved and he waved his dagger, sending a wave of flames out that condensed into a hideous fire dragon before pouncing towards Hua Qing Si.

Hua Qing Si’s face fell and she said through gnashed teeth, “Are you coming at me for real, even though I’m just a weak woman? Fine then!”

Saying so, she infused her Source Qi into the ribbon and it quickly began slashing it through the air, weaving a gorgeous dance that swiftly enveloped the Fire-titled cultivator.

In an instant, the two were locked in an intense battle and began exchanging vicious moves.

Meanwhile, the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators suddenly felt that their bodies had gotten heavier, as if a great mountain was weighing on them, while a buzzing sound emanated from the space around them and innumerable pitch-black Void Cracks flitted about like living creatures.

The two people both gazed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai only grinned in response, “The two of you better not make a move. After I send off your companion, I’ll come back to exchange some pointers with you.”

The face of the Wind-titled cultivator darkened and he said, “You want to take our life with just illusions? Don’t be ridiculous!”

“Illusions huh... hah,” Yang Kai chuckled in response.

Upon seeing this, the Wind and Thunder-titled cultivators were infuriated and they really wished to rush at him and viciously beat him up.

It wasn’t just the members of Blood Dagger who believed this was just a mere illusion, even Ye Jing Han thought so too. She had been observing the battle from afar and saw the moment the small mountain emerged along with a young woman. She had been taken aback and she stood there in a daze for a long while.

At this moment, she was rubbing her eyes and telling herself repeatedly that this was just an illusion.

But, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t find any flaw in this illusion. The small mountain and young woman simply looked too realistic.

*Dong dong dong...*

The Embodiment strode forward towards the Mountain-titled cultivator step by step.

The Mountain-titled cultivator had been telling himself repeatedly that this was just an illusion, but once the Embodiment started walking toward him, his face turned pale and he couldn’t help but gulp hard.

The colossal body of the Embodiment was too intimidating!

The Embodiment arrived in front of the Mountain-titled cultivator with only three steps.

If one looked at them from afar, it would seem that the Mountain-titled cultivator was sitting cross-legged in front of the Embodiment’s nose, and his little body formed a clear contrast with the colossus before him.
