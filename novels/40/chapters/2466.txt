After a short while, Yang Kai’s body phased back from the Void; however, his face was pale and he couldn’t help but cough up blood.

Although he had used Nihility to deal with Feng Xi’s attack, he was still hit by the shockwave.

Feng Xi, on the other hand, didn’t let up; taking advantage of Yang Kai’s momentary weakness, he flew up, Sword Qi surrounding his body as his figure shot straight towards Yang Kai with an unparalleled momentum, leaving a long luminous trail behind him.

Immediately, Emperor Pressure spread into the surrounding area, pressing down on Yang Kai, causing him to retreat again and again. A look of panic appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

“So boring! This Young Master hasn’t even warmed up yet, but you already can’t take it anymore! In the next life, remember to give this Young Master the respect he deserves!”

While speaking, the rainbow-like Sword Qi cut straight towards Yang Kai.

But right at that moment, an inexplicable foreboding feeling gripped his heart, making Feng Xi’s face, which had been filled with confidence, turn dark and uncertain.

When Yang Kai looked up again, there was no panic on his face, rather a smile of mockery had appeared.

[What happened!? This bastard is just a Dao Source Realm trash, so why is he showing such a strange smile when he is about to die? Could it be that he still has some ace up his sleeve?]

As such thoughts flashed across his mind, Feng Xi grit his teeth and followed his instincts, kicking the void as he retreated.

And as soon as he retreated, an enormous Moon Blade cut through the location where Feng Xi’s feet were last standing. More importantly, the resulting Void Crack was emitting an extremely dangerous aura.

“Si…” Feng Xi gasped as he stared at the Moon Blade with widened eyes; a look of disbelief covering his face.

This attack was well concealed and struck silently. More importantly, it was extremely lethal. Feng Xi believed that if he hadn’t dodged right then, this attack alone would have caused serious injuries.

[What kind of power is this?] Feng Xi’s face sank all of a sudden. He believed that while Yang Kai’s strength was outstanding for his realm, it was only that, but after this brief exchange, he realized that he hadn’t yet seen the depths of Yang Kai’s abilities.

“Oh? Young Sect Master reacted quite well,” Yang Kai also looked at Feng Xi with surprise.

Had it been two years ago, Feng Xi would have definitely fallen dead from an attack like this, but now that he was an Emperor, it seemed his senses were far sharper. Moreover, Yang Kai felt that Feng Xi’s Emperor Realm strength was a little stronger than Qiu Ze’s, who he had killed back in the past.

This was to be expected, though, from the disciple of a top Sect. Feng Xi’s foundation was far better than that of a mere Qiu Ze.

Although Qiu Ze was the Palace Master of Sky Illumination Palace, Sky Illumination Palace was just a second-class Sect in the Southern Territory. How could it be compared with a behemoth like the Seeking Passion Sect that had been founded long ago by the Seeking Passion Great Emperor?

“You hid your strength?” Feng Xi ground his teeth, staring at Yang Kai unhappily, writhing in humiliation.

Thinking that he was an Emperor already, Feng Xi believed that he could finish Yang Kai off with ease, but instead, he was almost successfully sneak attacked by Yang Kai. How could Feng Xi not be irritated? Especially when his two Junior Brothers were watching from the sidelines; leaving no way out of this embarrassing situation for him.

Yang Kai grinned and stated, “Young Sect Master’s words are really interesting. You have made progress in this Shattered Star Sea, so why would you believe others would remain the same?”

Feng Xi had broken through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, gaining a leap in strength, but Yang Kai hadn’t been idle either. His strength had also greatly improved over the past year and a half while he was subduing the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Both his Source Qi and Spiritual Energy were now far more refined.

“No wonder Lord Father said to never underestimate any opponent, regardless of their cultivation. Today, this Young Master has experienced this first hand. Yang Kai, you have taught this Young Master a valuable lesson,” Feng Xi coldly snorted. “I wanted to quickly take your life, but since you are stubbornly resisting, don’t blame this Young Master for torturing you to death instead.”

Yang Kai retorted with a snort, “Does Young Sect Master still think that he can defeat me?”

“Could it be that you think that I can’t kill you?” Feng Xi’s eyes widened as if he had heard a big joke.

“You can give it a try!” Yang Kai calmly looked at him.

“As you wish!” Feng Xi shouted. Next, he withdrew the long sword in his hand and took out a different one.

This sword was light blue and exuded an extremely cold aura. As soon as it appeared, the surrounding space seemed to have frozen as wisps of white mist rose from the sword.

“Emperor Artifact!” Yang Kai raised his brow as he gazed at the icy blue sword, pursing his lips as he stated, “I suppose this is to be expected! Young Sect Master’s identity is noble, so it makes sense for you to possess an Emperor Artifact!”

Yang Kai hadn’t seen Feng Xi use an Emperor Artifact before, a fact he found a little strange. Only now did he realize that Feng Xi did have an Emperor Artifact, he just hadn’t used it.

Now that he took out the Emperor Artifact, Feng Xi seemed to have resolved himself to go all out.

“Satisfied now? I will make you pay the price for this!” Feng Xi contemptuously glanced at Yang Kai and in the next moment, his long sword shook as a biting-cold wave spread outwards, “Heavenly Snow Seeking Passion Sword!”

Suddenly, dazzling sword flowers bloomed before turning into murderous intent visible to the naked eye and shooting towards Yang Kai in waves.

Yang Kai’s entire body turned cold as he couldn’t help but shudder. He promptly motivated the surrounding Space Principles as he stretched out his hand and clasped it hard, shouting, “Solidify!”

*Weng…*

A reverberating thrum suddenly rang out as the place where Feng Xi stood and the surrounding thousand-metre radius space suddenly solidified and became extremely viscous.

The supreme Sword Technique he had displayed was also frozen in place at this moment.

Feng Xi’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

“This, this, this…”

“What happened!?”

The yellow-faced youth and the scholarly man, who were watching nearby, were also taken aback. They couldn’t understand what was going on. All they saw was Yang Kai stretch his hand out, and their Young Sect Master’s Sword Wave was directly suppressed.

“Break!” Yang Kai shouted again.

*Hualala…*

With a crisp sound, those blossomed sword flowers that Feng Xi had congealed, exhausting himself, shattered like glass while the ice-cold aura surrounding them immediately disappeared.

Not only that, with Feng Xi as the centre, Void Cracks as tiny as an ox’s hairs opened and began densely swarming around him.

In an instant, the space became extremely unstable, as if it was on the verge of collapsing at any moment.

Yang Kai raised his hands and condensed two enormous Moon Blades, gripping them as if they were tangible objects. Then, with a smile, he turned to Feng Xi and said, “Young Sect Master, your cultivation is still lacking!”

“The Dao of Space!” Even if Feng Xi wasn’t the most learned individual, he could still tell what this ability of Yang Kai’s was, and that caused him to become flustered and blurt out in shock.

He looked at the countless Void Cracks around him, and then at the two giant Moon Blades in Yang Kai’s hands; his face turning pale.

Yang Kai’s face turned colder as he stated, “This Young Master has killed more than one Emperor Realm Master. If Young Sect Master believed that he could trample me just because he had advanced to the Emperor Realm, he made a grave miscalculation. Since you have made such a mistake, you need to be disciplined. Young Sect Master, this Young Master will discipline you on behalf of your father, do you have any problem with that?”

Feng Xi coughed up blood in anger as his face burned with fury. He wanted nothing more than to curse Yang Kai’s shamelessness, but he had no idea where to start.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had already swung his hands, sending out the two enormous Moon Blades.

Feng Xi was taken aback as he stared at the Moon Blades coming closer and closer. How was this ‘disciplining’? Yang Kai was clearly planning on reaping his life!

In horror, Feng Xi’s face suddenly became solemn and he lifted his Emperor Artifact sword up high as he released an intense Sword Intent.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up seeing this. He might not have any idea what Feng Xi was planning on doing, but it seemed that he wasn’t planning to sit idly by and wait for his death.

That wasn’t strange though. Feng Xi had finally broken through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, and the days ahead of him were bright, so how could he be willing to die here?

A solemn aura suddenly spread from Feng Xi as he slowly swung his sword down. His entire essence seemed to have undergone a great change at this moment, like he had turned into a different person, his eyes clear but also cold and emotionless.

“There is no love without hatred as there is no Dao without the Heavenly Way!” A reverberating shout resounded.

Suddenly, the sword dazzlingly gleamed as Sword Qi flew out from the sword, creating a marvellous aura.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes in shock as he hadn’t expected Feng Xi to unleash such an attack. This move was just like one only a true Master could display as it conformed to the movements of the Heavenly Way!

If Feng Xi lived past today, he would certainly make a name for himself.

Yang Kai’s face slightly darkened as he clenched his fists and fiercely punched out.

“Exile!”

Suddenly, a pitch-black hole formed before Feng Xi and an awe-inspiring chaotic vacuum radiated from it.

The Sword Technique Feng Xi had just used was disturbed as minute flaws appeared one after another.

Right then, the two Moon Blades arrived while at the same time, the tiny Void Cracks shot towards Feng Xi under Yang Kai’s control.

“Ahhh!” A miserable scream resounded as the aura that was as stable as a mountain became chaotic. All of a sudden, Feng Xi’s figure was surrounded by swirling Void Cracks and streaks of blood spurted out from his body, turning the entire scene into a horrifying sight.

“Young Sect Master!”

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar were panic-stricken and couldn’t help but shout.

They believed that Feng Xi could deal with Yang Kai as easily as snapping his figures, so they never expected that a mere Dao Source Realm cultivator could completely suppress their Young Sect Master. [How is this possible!? How could this happen?]

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they would have never believed it.

But they didn’t dare to rush to Feng Xi’s rescue. So, even though they shouted out loud, they just stood still, their eyes moving about erratically; seemingly preparing to escape at a moment’s notice.

If their Young Sect Master died here, they would certainly not be able to escape Yang Kai’s sinister hands.

Yang Kai didn’t stop after just this though. Rather, he swung the Myriads Sword and released a Sword Wave that could cover the Heavens and Earth towards Feng Xi.

*Chi Chi Chi…*

Slicing sounds rang out, and only after the Sword Wave had disappeared completely did the surrounding space finally regain its peace.

Yang Kai took a slight breath of relief while before him, a bloody and mutilated Feng Xi stood floating in the void, looking extremely miserable, his life or death uncertain.

*Gudong…*

The yellow-faced man and the scholar nervously gulped as their faces turned extremely pale, staring at the floating Feng Xi in a daze. They promptly scanned him with their Divine Senses and discovered that Feng Xi was actually gasping for breath. Obviously, he had suffered critical injuries.
