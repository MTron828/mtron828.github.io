“Junior Brother can move freely, Junior Sister Xue and I will take care of things here,” Ou Yang Lie stated. Many Human Race Masters happened to be recovering from their injuries and needed someone to look after them. Even so, not everyone had to remain. Since Yang Kai had some plans, it was naturally better for him to set off immediately.

If he could recover the pill taken away by the Chaos Spirit King, that would be a good thing.

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll be going then.”

Bidding goodbye, Yang Kai took a step forward and in the next moment, Space Principles undulated as his figure disappeared. As a matter of fact, he still had not recovered from his injuries, but as he didn’t have much time on his hands, Yang Kai didn’t want to waste any on healing. Not to mention, his injuries didn’t impede his movements. Furthermore, now that he was a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, even if he were to encounter a Chaos Spirit King, he could still put up a fight!

Just after he left, a figure suddenly appeared beside Yang Xue. Impressively, it was none other than Yang Xiao, who had been pretending to be healing.

Yang Xiao’s face was slightly pale. He had consumed a great deal of energy in the previous battle and had suffered some heavy injuries. Be that as it may, he was still a member of Dragon Clan. He had a powerful physique and possessed outstanding recovery abilities, so he could heal several times faster than an ordinary Eighth-Order Master.

Staring in the direction Yang Kai had left, Yang Xiao nervously asked, “Little Aunt, what did Adoptive Father say just now?”

Yang Xue slowly shook her head as she replied, “He did not say anything.”

“Nothing!?” Yang Xiao’s eyes widened in shock, “He didn’t ask anything about me?”

[How is that possible? Why did he not say anything?] This made Yang Xiao feel even more uneasy.

Yang Xue thought for a moment before replying, “Big Brother wants you to become a Divine Dragon as soon as possible.”

Yang Xiao paused for a moment, but when he saw that Yang Xue had nothing else to add, he asked in a huge surprise, “That’s it?”

Yang Xue couldn’t help but glare at him, “What else do you want to hear?”

“Well…” Yang Xiao couldn’t help but frown, [Could it be that he doesn’t know anything? Impossible, Old Fang was his Soul Clone, and now that his Selves have united, he should know everything by now… shouldn’t he!?]

Yang Xiao wore a distressed expression and thought for a moment before his eyes suddenly lit up and he broke into a loud laugh, “I understand!”

Yang Xue tilted her head and looked at him with a dumbfounded look.

[What do you understand?]

Yang Xiao then shouted towards the direction Yang Kai had left, “Don’t worry, Adoptive Father! The day I become the Divine Dragon will be the day I go to the Yang Family to ask for Yang Xue’s hand in marriage!”

Yang Xue’s face turned red as she stomped her foot, “What the Hell are you spouting!?”

Ou Yang Lie also couldn’t help but turn his head and look at Yang Xiao in surprise before looking at Yang Xue. Suddenly, he seemed to have realized something.

Yang Xue’s face became even redder as she shot an angry glare at Yang Xiao. Immediately after, she turned around and left.

Yang Xiao looked at Ou Yang Lie innocently, “Did I say something wrong? Did Adoptive Father not mean that?”

Ou Yang Lie heartily laughed, “No, you’re right, that’s what Yang Kai meant. You brat, you’re really astute! Women get easily embarrassed though, are you not going to chase after her!?”

“Oh, en!” Yang Xiao suddenly came to a realization. He bowed to Ou Yang Lie before chasing after Yang Xue.

Gazing over, Ou Yang Lie couldn’t help but nod his acknowledgement, “Young and vigorous, hot-blooded and unyielding. Good, very good!”

He couldn’t help but think back to when he was young. At that time, he too was bold and daring. He would do whatever he wanted and couldn’t care less what others thought about him! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Turning his head, Ou Yang Lie saw a figure slowly approaching from the distant void. When he got close, Ou Yang Lie sized him up before asking, “You just broke through, don’t you need to stabilize your foundation?”

Xiang Shan replied, shaking his head, “We don’t have that kind of time. The Universe Furnace will close before I can consolidate my realm.” He then turned his head to look in the direction Yang Xiao and Yang Xue had left, and asked, confused, “What happened?”

Ou Yang Lie immediately became spirited and explained what he had seen and heard.

Xiang Shan nodded in understanding, “Since they have feelings for each other, let them do whatever they want. It’s not like they’re related by blood, they are just related because of their relationship with Yang Kai. It doesn’t count. I’m sure Junior Brother Yang won’t mind.”

Ou Yang Lie nodded in agreement, “That’s right, we cultivators don’t have so many worldly customs, and that brat, Yang Kai, doesn’t seem to care about this matter either.” Sighing, he continued, “Moreover, if the Human Race doesn’t win this time, I’m afraid we won’t have a future at all. If we stop them now, they’ll only be left with regrets”

Xiang Shan nodded and dropped this matter before changing the subject, “I’m going to kill some enemies, I’ll have to trouble you to take care of things here.”

Saying so, he turned into a streak of light and left, not caring if Ou Yang Lie agreed or not.

Ou Yang Lie was mouth agape. He did not expect Xiang Shan to do something like this, and by the time he wanted to stop him, it was already too late. Nonetheless, he could not help but shout, “Big Head Xiang, get back here!”

But why would Xiang Shan return? The streak of light gradually disappeared into the distance, as if it hadn’t heard anything.

Ou Yang Lie was enraged, “This is too much!”

He also wanted to go kill some enemies. He thought that Xiang Shan would want to stabilize his new Ninth-Order cultivation, so he was planning on entrusting overseeing things here to him. After that, he would be free to do whatever he wanted, but he never expected Xiang Shan to beat him to it.

But after giving it another thought, he understood why Xiang Shan was in such a hurry.

When the Universe Furnace opened this time, Xiang Shan didn’t even have time to do anything before he was drawn into the great battle between the Human Race and Black Ink Clan. Now that he had just broken through to the Ninth Order, he couldn’t wait to test his newfound strength.

Xiang Shan had left, Yang Xue had also left…

Looking around, Ou Yang Lie found that only he among the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was left to guard this place. He could not leave. With so many Eighth-Order Masters recovering here, they would need someone to protect them.

[Miserable!] Ou Yang Lie cursed in his heart, [When the Universe Furnace closes, I will definitely make Big Head Xiang pay for this!]

Although the battle between the Human Race and the Black Ink Clan here ended with the Human Race’s victory this time, the war was far from over.

Not to mention that the number of Black Ink Clansmen who had entered the Universe Furnace was not limited to the ones who had appeared before, and many even managed to escape at the last moment.

With two Royal Lords, one dead and one seriously injured, and the Pseudo-Royal Lords who had managed to escape all wounded, the Black Ink Clan was at a significant disadvantage at the moment. As such, this was the perfect opportunity to slaughter them.

If they missed the current opportunity, the Human Race would have to wait for the Universe Furnace to close before they got another chance.

If they could eliminate some of the Black Ink Clan forces in advance, the pressure on the Human Race would decrease by some degree once the Universe Furnace closed.

Perhaps they could also kill some of the Black Ink Clansmen who had entered the Universe Furnace from the Black Ink Battlefield and the Barren Territory.

As time passed, the Human Masters began recovering one by one, but they didn’t remain in place for long. Ou Yang Lie ordered them to form Battle Formations and spread out to search for the Black Ink Clan survivors.

By the time the last batch of Human Race cultivators had recovered, a lot of time had already passed, but finally, Ou Yang Lie, who had been guarding this place, was able to move again.

Naturally, he showered Xiang Shan with curses in his heart.

.….

Somewhere in the void, a battle had just ended and Yang Kai happened to be standing there alone, surrounded by the corpses of several Black Ink Clansmen.

Calling it a battle could not be farther from the truth though, as it was really just a one-sided massacre.

Even if the Territory Lords assumed Battle Formations, they were unable to do anything in front of the current Yang Kai. He was a Ninth-Order Master with the body of a Divine Dragon. Even if he hadn’t fully recovered, killing a few Territory Lords was still as easy as chopping vegetables now.

The advancement of one Order had brought about an earth-shattering change in his strength. His Small Universe’s size had expanded by several times. Of course, it was partly due to the increase in his cultivation, but the integration of Fang Tian Ci’s Small Universe had played no small role in it; otherwise, how could Yang Kai, a newly advanced Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, have such a strong foundation?

Not only that, but his Small Universe also had another World Tree clone at the moment.

In the past, Yang Kai had handed his last World Tree clone to Fang Tian Ci to help him rapidly grow, but with the fusion of Fang Tian Ci’s Small Universe with his, that World Tree clone had also merged with it.

Yang Kai already had a World Tree clone to begin with, so there was not much point in having a second.

[After returning to 3,000 Worlds, I should find a suitable candidate and give it to them. It should help them save some time in cultivation and allow them to advance to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm earlier.]

After separating from Ou Yang Lie and the others, Yang Kai began searching the void, mainly because he wanted to find the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill he had thrown away.

One more Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill meant the birth of one more Ninth-Order Master, and currently, the Human Race did not have many Ninth-Order Masters.

Yang Kai especially wanted to bring a Supreme Grade pill back for Mi Jing Lun. The war would definitely become more intense and fierce in the future. Mi Jing Lun, who was the Supreme Commander of the Human Race Armies might not be able to control the overall situation if he remained in the rear, and his Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivation would make it risky for him to stand on the front lines. If he could break through to the Ninth Order however, it would be much better for the Human Race!

Unfortunately, Yang Kai failed to find anything even after searching for so long, but that did not mean that his search was without harvest. He ran into some Black Ink Clansmen along the way, so naturally he finished them all off.

Thunder Shadow’s voice rang out in his mind, “Big Brother, isn’t my Innate Divine Ability quite useful?”

Although Yang Kai’s strength was great and he had always been unrivalled among his peers, he was not proficient in stealth and assassination. Under normal circumstances, when he ran into enemies, he would usually just fight them head-on.

But after merging with his Monster Self, Thunder Shadow’s exceptional mastery over the Dao of Thunder and Dao of Concealment also became available to Yang Kai.

Just now, he had given Thunder Shadow’s Innate Divine Ability a try and hid himself. When he suddenly attacked the Territory Lords, they did not even have the chance to react. It could be said that they had no idea who had killed them.

Yang Kai lightly chuckled, “There is some truth as to why Great Monsters ran rampant in the Early Ancient Era.”

The different types of Monster Race had different Innate Divine Abilities. Thunder Shadow was a member of the Shadow Leopard Race and was innately proficient in the Dao of Concealment, which was one of the reasons Yang Kai chose him as his Monster Self.

At that time, Yang Kai had to go into a retreat to recuperate, so he didn’t have much time to take care of his Monster Self. Choosing Thunder Shadow would give the latter more opportunities to survive.

As for the Dao of Thunder, that was something that Thunder Shadow had cultivated on his own, so it was not an Innate Divine Ability.

As for the title Thunder Shadow, it was also the title he had obtained as a Great Emperor, not his race.

“In any case, I’m more useful than Second Brother!” Thunder Shadow proudly proclaimed.

Fang Tian Ci was the Human Self Yang Kai had cultivated in his Small Universe, and the Grand Daos he cultivated were basically inherited from Yang Kai. It could be said that everything he was proficient at was the same as Yang Kai, while the one he wasn’t proficient at, Yang Kai was proficient at. So, naturally, there was nothing Yang Kai could take advantage of…

Thus, from this fact alone, Thunder Shadow felt a sense of superiority.
