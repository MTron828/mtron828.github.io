Half a day later, a Space Array was formed.

Yang Kai instructed Ji Yao, “Junior Sister Yao, please go back to Ice Heart Valley and tell Nanmen Da Jun to come here after repairing Ice Heart Valley’s Sect Defending Array.”

He handed Ji Yao a peculiar token as he spoke.

Ji Yao took it in doubt, “What’s the use of this token?”

At a glance, she could see that it was a newly refined token made by Yang Kai himself, and she could still sense his residual aura in it.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Every Space Array that I arrange can only be activated by me or with this token, otherwise it will be useless.”

This was also why Luan Feng failed to activate the Space Array in Phoenix Nest Palace on that day, because she did not have Yang Kai’s Transmission Token. She mistakenly thought that the array was faulty and wanted to see Yang Kai make a fool of himself when he tried to use it, but the outcome disappointed her in the end.

After hearing this, Ji Yao’s eyes blinked a few times before she stepped up to the Space Array without saying anything.

Yang Kai continued while laying out the Source Crystals, “This matter is not urgent, and can be put on hold until he finishes his work in Ice Heart Valley first.”

“En!” Ji Yao nodded lightly. Then, her figure was wrapped with white light and disappeared.

After the departure of Ji Yao, Yang Kai took a look at his left and right, then vanished subsequently with a flicker.

Since he had the intention of settling down here, Yang Kai definitely needed to examine the Seeking Passion Sect’s headquarters thoroughly. Although he had checked almost every corner of this place, he did not really make a careful inspection as he was busy searching for the hidden Treasury.

Now that he was unoccupied, Yang Kai certainly wanted to examine this place as its new master.

Everything was notably different with the change of his mentality.

If he already thought that this base was good during the previous investigation, now there was only one word that could express his feeling, and that was ‘satisfaction’.

World Energy was rich in the Seeking Passion Sect, the scenery was beautiful, and there were many cultivation paradises on many pristine Spirit Peaks.

Such a vast base was enough to comfortably accommodate a hundred thousand disciples or more. Yang Kai did not even have that many friends and family back on Shadowed Star, so this place would certainly be enough to house them all.

After wandering around for several days, Yang Kai finally finished a thorough investigation of the whole land, without letting go of any corners, and had vaguely made some plans in his mind.

He then went back to the main gate of the Seeking Passion Sect.

Previously, there was a plaque engraved with the words ‘Seeking Passion Sect’ here, a signboard that had been handed down for tens of thousands of years, but it was smashed to pieces by Yang Kai days ago.

Yang Kai naturally had a plan for returning here; however, as he scanned the place with his Divine Sense, he found that many new auras were lingering about.

The strength of these people was uneven, some were hiding in the dark, while others were standing gloriously in the open. Everyone was staring at Seeking Passion Sect and whispering to each other from time to time. There were a lot of people, about a few thousand of them, and more were arriving all the time.

After the war between Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley, Seeking Passion Sect was completely annihilated, and those who had sided with them had also suffered a heavy toll. This news was earth-shaking and it did not take long for it to spread across the entire Northern Territory.

These people appeared outside of the gates of Seeking Passion Sect because they had heard the news and wanted to see if they could pick up a windfall from this place.

In the Seeking Passion Sect’s heyday, none of these people would dare come near this place and could only gaze at it from afar. However, times were different now. The Seeking Passion Sect was doomed to collapse, and the wealth accumulated by them over their tens of thousands of years of history was now just a big tempting feast.

Men die for wealth just as birds die for food, this was the truth since ancient times. Many could not just sit still when they thought of the massive treasure trove hidden in Seeking Passion Sect and had to come here to try their luck.

They could relish for a lifetime from just a small part of the fortunes of a giant like Seeking Passion Sect.

However, no one dared to go in or openly inspect the interior of the Seeking Passion Sect, so the situation inside remained unknown to all of them.

This group of people had gathered here one after another over the past few days from various Sects, families and other great forces.

After several days of hesitation, they finally elected a few leaders to plan the matter together, but before they could even hold discussions, they saw Yang Kai walk out of Seeking Passion Sect leisurely.

Everyone abruptly fell silent and stared at Yang Kai.

The next moment, the crowd went into an uproar.

“Someone came out from the inside, is he a Master from Seeking Passion Sect?”

Seeking Passion Sect’s name resounded like thunder in the Northern Territory, so now that someone suddenly came out from it, the crowd immediately assumed he belonged to the remnants of Seeking Passion Sect, so they could not help feeling scared, fearful they might anger him and lead to their destruction.

“Nonsense! All the top Elders, including the Sect Master of Seeking Passion Sect, died already! Even if someone escaped, why would he return to the Sect? How would that be different from courting death?”

“That’s right! Don’t you see that the ten thousand years old signboard of the Seeking Passion Sect has already been destroyed? No one in the Seeking Passion Sect would dare to remain here.”

“In my opinion, this man must have come here for their fortune, and he just got here one step ahead of us… he must have harvested something!”

“Damn it, who the hell is he? How dare he simply break into the base of Seeking Passion Sect? Damn him!”

With these remarks, many of them were provoked and began glaring at Yang Kai with envy and hatred, as if the Seeking Passion Sect was their own territory and Yang Kai disrespected them by breaking into it.

These people had been camping out here for several days, but they did not dare to enter. Nevertheless, it seemed that someone else had taken the initiative before their arrival. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In that case, what were they doing here?

At this moment, all the cultivators, whether they were in the light or hidden in the dark, showed up one after another. Some of them even showed off their strength by releasing their auras towards Yang Kai.

After all, Yang Kai was alone, and he looked young, which made people look down on him. There were so many of them united together, prepared to loot this place, so they naturally were not afraid of one lucky youth.

All of a sudden, more than a dozen people flew towards Yang Kai and stood three hundred meters in front of him. A middle-aged man who seemed to be their leader looked down at Yang Kai and asked, “Boy, did you just come out of Seeking Passion Sect?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and sneered because he knew what they were up to.

Previously, he was surprised to see so many people gathered outside, but after pondering for a bit, he quickly realized their intentions.

It was undeniable that they made the right choice to come here so quickly. Since Seeking Passion had been annihilated, there would undoubtedly be many good things left in their headquarters. Taking advantage of someone when they were down was almost second nature to people.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai was the one who took down the Seeking Passion Sect, and he definitely would not give away any profits that he earned to others.

Facing the middle-aged man’s interrogation, Yang Kai didn’t even feel like answering and instead began rummaging through his Space Ring.

The middle-aged man’s face darkened looking at this boy’s ignorant and arrogant face.

After all, he was a Sect Master himself, and although his Sect was incomparable to a giant like Seeking Passion Sect, it was still considered a great force in the Northern Territory. Therefore, it was humiliating when someone ignored his question in his face.

Aware of his Sect Master’s anger, a young man next to him immediately glared at Yang Kai and reprimanded, “Little brat, are you deaf? Our Sect Master is asking you a question!”

Yang Kai glanced at the young man, and replied unconcernedly, “This Young Master is not deaf. It’s just that this Young Master is too lazy to answer such stupid questions.”

It was obvious that he came out of the Seeking Passion Sect, so he really had no idea what the middle-aged man was thinking asking such a question.

The young man looked maddened and was about to launch a rebuke when the middle-aged man waved his hand to dismiss him. Sweeping his eyes over Yang Kai, the middle-aged man smiled lightly and said, “This King is the Pavilion Master of Soaring Yuan Pavilion, Li Qing Yuan. How should this King address this Little Brother?”

He suddenly took an opposite turn from his previous arrogant attitude, which made the young man beside him frown as he did not understand his Sect Master’s behaviour.

Yang Kai waved his hand, “We’re just two strangers who met by chance, there’s no need to learn each other’s names.”

Li Qing Yuan scowled, looking really upset. He was a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master and also the Soaring Yuan Pavilion’s Pavilion Master. He had already put down his status and taken the initiative to speak politely to a Junior, but all he received in return was a dismissive attitude, upsetting him greatly.

However, he still had some self-restraint. Although he was upset in his heart, Li Qing Yuan remained outwardly calm and continued, “Little Brother, it’s like this. This King and these assembled heroes of the Northern Territory came here and saw that the gates of Seeking Passion Sect had been broken. We all felt sad about this and wanted to go inside to inquire about what had happened, but we were afraid of acting rashly and causing misunderstandings. Now that Little Brother has come out from inside, he must know what the situation of the Seeking Passion Sect is. Could you please enlighten us in regards to this matter?”

Everyone’s eyes lit up as they all nodded in agreement, pressuring Yang Kai to explain clearly about the situation inside Seeking Passion Sect.

Yang Kai snickered, “How dare you group of people call yourselves heroes of the Northern Territory?”

He casually scanned the crowd at a glance before nodding lightly, “A dozen First and Second-Order Emperors, I guess they can reluctantly be considered Masters.”

His shameless boasting instantly triggered the Emperor Realm Masters around Li Qing Yuan. They were Emperors, not some stray cats and dogs. Each of them had a high reputation in the Northern Territory, but in Yang Kai’s eyes, they seemed to be nothing more than leftovers.

[This little brat is looking down on all of us!]

Yang Kai retracted his smile, and swept his eyes across the people in front of him, “Are you guys here looking to pick up a bargain? I bet you want to enter to plunder this place, but aren’t sure if there are any Masters from Seeking Passion Sect left, so you didn’t dare to step inside, right?”

Li Qing Yuan and the others could not help blushing.

Although this was the truth, it was still shameful to be exposed face to face.

Li Qing Yuan coughed and explained, “Little Brother, this is not true. We are all from Sects, families, and great forces that have some connections with the Seeking Passion Sect. We heard that the Seeking Passion Sect had suffered a great disaster, so we came here mainly to ask if they require our assistance in any way. Why would we be here trying to act like common bandits? Little Brother must not look down on us.”

“Yes, yes!”

“That’s right. We are all here to deliver charcoal in the snowy winter. Boy, you must not judge others as you would yourself, thinking everyone is so shameless and immoral!”
