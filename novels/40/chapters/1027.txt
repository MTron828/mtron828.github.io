Editor and Proofreader: Leo of Zion Mountain

On the plain beside the mountain, Yue Xi, He Zao, He Miao, and Shen Tu, who were already nervous because of Gui Zu’s crazy laughter, suddenly went stiff and pale.

This was because Gui Zu’s voice had just sounded in their ears.

“What happened?” Lu Gui Chen hurriedly asked.

“Gui Zu summoned us...” Yue Xi couldn’t help but swallow.

The look Lu Gui Chen shot Yue Xi immediately changed, a hint of taking pleasure in other’s misfortune present, along with some sorrow and relief, but he no longer said anything.

“I was also summoned!” Shen Tu’s face paled as a deep sense of powerlessness filled his heart.

“I... as well!” Bi Ya rubbed her hands together nervously, her tender body shivering.

“What should we do, Master?” He Zao looked at Yue Xi nervously.

Yue Xi’s heart was also in chaos, not sure what to say for a while. When they first arrived here, there were more than a hundred of them, yet almost all of them had died at Gui Zu’s hands. Today, Gui Zu had actually summoned so many people of them at once though, who knows what his intentions were?

“It’s a blessing, not a curse...” Yue Xi smiled and gave up any plans to escape because, in front of an Origin King Realm master, there was no way to escape. “Come with me. If today... if today is the day of our deaths, Master will at least be able to accompany you on the road.”

She looked at He Zao and He Miao with great affection, secretly deciding to do whatever she could to protect her two Disciples.

Even if this was no different from a mantis trying to stop a cart, she wouldn’t hesitate.

The three of them began walking up the mountain while Shen Tu and Bi Ya exchanged a glance before sighing and keeping up.

Looking at their departing backs, a cultivator from Purple Star came up to Lu Gui Chen and said, “Senior, they...”

“They probably won’t return...” Lu Gui Chen sighed softly and smiled bitterly, “I don’t know I should feel glad or sad for them, but for now we’ve managed to escape, as for what will happen next time, I’m afraid...”

Saying so, he showed a dispirited look to his three remaining subordinates.

All of them thought that those who had been summoned were going to die.

Yang Kai waited in the heart of the mountain and after a while saw Shen Tu and the others walk in, gently nodded and was about to say hello when he suddenly wore a confused expression, “What’s wrong with you all? Why do you all look so depressed?”

The corner of Shen Tu’s mouth twitched as he somewhat unwillingly replied, “We were summoned by Gui Zu.”

Letting out a sigh, he reached out and gently patted Yang Kai’s shoulder, whispering quietly, “Brother, I’m afraid that there’s no way we can flee from this disaster. If you have the chance to escape from this place, please deliver a message to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Tell my father I’m sorry for disappointing him, and that if I had only known this would happen, I wouldn’t have been so stubborn and disobedient.”

Appearing as if he was making his last confession, Shen Tu looked unusually solemn.

“Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce?” Yue Xi heard this and directed a thoughtful look towards Shen Tu, her eyes flashing a slight bit of doubt.

“Remember to deliver my last message; of course, if you can’t leave here that is,” Shen Tu patted Yang Kai’s shoulder, sighing heavily again.

Yang Kai’s expression became weird.

But after thinking about it, he suddenly understood why these people were so downcast, like they were marching to their own execution, causing him to smile with astonishment, “What do you think Senior Gui Zu Senior summoned you all for?”

“I don’t know, but it’s certainly not anything good,” Shen Tu replied before gawking towards Yang Kai, “Do you know what we’ve been summoned for? Can you tell us so we can prepare ourselves?”

Everyone cast their vision towards him.

“I asked Senior Gui Zu to call all of you over,” Yang Kai bluntly said.

Everyone expression became puzzled.

“I’m going to take you out of here,” Yang Kai continued.

Shen Tu shook visibly while Yue Xi, He Zao, He Miao, and Bi Ya’s beautiful eyes lit up as the stared towards Yang Kai incredulously.

“I found a way to leave this place, en, and when I told Senior Gui Zu about it, he agreed to let you come with us.”

“Wha... Did I hear you right? Can we really leave this place?” Shen Tu muttered absent-mindedly, his face filled with shock and disbelief.

He Zao and He Miao’s pretty faces both lifted, their eyes filling with a light of gratitude, He Miao eagerly asking, “Yang Kai, are you telling the truth? You’re not deceiving us right?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Hearing this, the little girl suddenly became filled with joy as she covered her small mouth and teared up, “Good, good...”

She was so excited that she couldn’t stop crying. Just now, she had thought being summoned by Gui Zu, she would have to die, but now those worries had disappeared and were replaced with the prospect of being able to escape from this prison, so her reaction was only natural.

He Zao gently held her shoulders, the two sisters exchanging a knowing glance and smiled.

Bi Ya seemed to have been shocked by this news, standing there stupidly for a time, unable to compose herself as she stared towards Yang Kai, unable to understand why he had suddenly changed his mind.

Not long ago, Bi Ya had looked for Yang Kai to discuss this very matter, but the perfunctory answer she had received at the time had been very discouraging, yet not he was actually telling her he would bring her out from this place. Bi Ya couldn’t help wondering if she was dreaming right now.

Amongst this group though, the most confused was undoubtedly was Yue Xi.

Staring at Yang Kai, her look was particularly complex, her expression fluctuating, no one able to determine what she was thinking.

She wanted to offer her thanks, but she couldn’t find the words to say, her heart was tangled up in knots.

“You all wait here for a moment. Bi Ya, come with me,” Yang Kai didn’t pay any attention to Yue Xi and instead beckoned to Bi Ya.

“Ah, en...” Bi Ya quickly responded and followed after Yang Kai.

Standing a short distance away, Yang Kai stared at this promiscuous woman, his brow slightly wrinkled, eventually letting out a long sigh, “To be honest, I don’t really want to take you out from this place. Whether you live or die means nothing to me!”

Bi Ya smiled bitterly, “I understand, after all, I did many terrible things to you before.”

“There is a saying that one’s behaviour is easy to change, but their nature is not. You are a woman who treats men as nothing but playthings, a resource to be consumed to increase your own strength. Right now you may be acting docile, but who knows what will happen once we leave this place, perhaps your original personality will re-assert itself and you will bear a deep grudge for what has transpired here then bide your time to seek vengeance.”

“No, I won’t do such a thing,” Bi Ya quickly waved.

“I don’t trust you!” Yang Kai shook his head.

Bi Ya’s face went white, as if she was seeing the hope of leaving here slipping away before her very eyes.

“However, during this time you did serve me well. En, whether it was out of necessity or sincerity, you took care of me very attentively, so if I was to simply discard you here, that would be too ungrateful.”

“What do I need to do to win your trust?” Bi Ya understood the meaning of his words and her eyes immediately lit up, quickly asking Yang Kai, “Just say the word and I will comply!”

Yang Kai gently nodded, “Let loose your Knowledge Sea’s defences. I must take your Soul Brand and control whether you live or die!”

Bi Ya was stunned, her face filling with a look of horror as she hesitated for a moment, but she quickly recovered and nodded, lowering her Knowledge Sea’s defences.

In the next moment, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense penetrated into Bi Ya’s Knowledge Sea and shuttled back and forth.

After a few breaths, Yang Kai took back his Divine Sense as well as Bi Ya’s Soul Brand.

Bi Ya’s face had turned slightly pale from this experience, her red lips muttering, “Is this enough?”

Yang Kai looked at her in a strange expression and nodded. “Yes.”

After a pause, he asked again, “Just how many men have you harmed so far?”

Bi Ya pursed her lips and giggled, “Did you peek at my memories?”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, “I didn’t intend to.”

Inside Bi Ya’s Knowledge Sea, so many of her memories were filled with obscene scenes, so much so that even an experienced man like Yang Kai felt frightened. This woman was nothing less than a walking disaster; any man she targeted would be unable to escape her poisonous hands, ultimately resulting in their vitality being sucked away.

But when each of these men died, their expressions were all filled with bliss, as if they remained ignorant of the terrible fate that had befallen them until the very end.

Yang Kai couldn’t help shivering slightly. If it weren’t for the many twists and turns back on the Purple Star Starship, his life may have ended like all those others, a dry husk beneath Bi Ya’s profane power.

“I am only yours now,” Bi Ya bit her thing thin red lip seductively, her tender body seemingly emitting a fragrant pheromone that assaulting Yang Kai’s mind, “I will serve you even more attentively from now on.”

“No need, I don’t want to have anything to do with you. After we leave here, you and I will part ways,” Yang Kai snorted.

“You shouldn’t really be...” Bi Ya covered her mouth and swept her eyes up and down, but mostly down Yang Kai.

“Shouldn’t really be what?”

“Do you... have problems down there?” Bi Ya asked the doubt she had held in her heart for so long, her eyes staring fixedly between Yang Kai’s legs, a tinge of sadness and pity appearing on her face.

Yang Kai’s face went black as he shouted, “If you dare talk any more nonsense I’ll leave you to rot here!”

Saying so, he no longer bothered with this crazy woman, turning around and leaving, Bi Ya’s delightful giggles resounding behind him; she seemingly didn’t care one bit about Yang Kai’s threat.

After Yang Kai arrived back at the place where everyone had gathered, Gui Zu appeared leisurely.

Everyone who had been whispering back and forth a month ago promptly shut up.

“Done?” Gui Zu looked at Yang Kai.

“En.”

“Then let’s go!” Gui Zu laughed.

“Wait a moment, I have some things to say first,” Yang Kai turned to face the crowd and put on a solemn expression, “All of you need to know that in order to take you out from this place, I will be using a method to tear space.”

“Tear space?” Yue Xi called out in shock as she stared Yang Kai, “Do you understand the Dao of Space?”

Nodding, Yang Kai admitted, “A little.”

Yue Xi’s beautiful eyes lit up, suddenly turning to look at Gui Zu, “No wonder, no wonder Senior Gui Zu made an agreement with you, it was like this.”

All of them had been speculating about just what would make Gui Zu take interest in Yang Kai, even going so far as to protect his safety and provide him with a the best cultivation environment, his attitude towards Yang Kai completely different from all the others. Now, they understood. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Being able to tear space meant Yang Kai had the ability to escape from this prison. This was similar to the approach Gui Zu had researched for a thousand years, his one hope to leave here, but also something he could not grasp clearly.
