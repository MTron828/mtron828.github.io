The sheep-headed Royal Lord could clearly see his own figure in the reflection of Yang Kai’s eye. At that instant, he was overwhelmed with a sense of discomfort. Astounded, he realised that this was no ordinary Eye Secret Technique. What he saw in Yang Kai’s eye was definitely more than just a reflection.

Just then, a glint flashed across Yang Kai’s pupil as he grinned, “It seems that you’re badly injured. It must have been difficult for you.”

The Royal Lord’s expression turned livid. When a glint flashed across Yang Kai’s eye earlier, he had a feeling that his secrets were being pried into. He secretly cursed at this Human while simultaneously thinking that this Eye Secret Technique was indeed extraordinary.

On the other hand, Yang Kai ignored the Royal Lord and scanned his surroundings. A moment later, he straightened up and flapped his arms before moving in a particular direction.

The Royal Lord hurriedly followed him.

He had agreed to Yang Kai’s request to allow him to cultivate his Eye Secret Technique in the hope that he could get out of this fog. As for whether Yang Kai would pull a trick during this period of time, that was all but certain.

Regardless, the Royal Lord was confident that he could follow Yang Kai and get out of this trap.

Therefore, he paid close attention to every move that Yang Kai made, and he followed him closely wherever the latter went. He practically imitated Yang Kai in every way, as though he was a delayed shadow.

As Yang Kai’s Demon Eye of Annihilation had improved, he was able to see through this strange fog more clearly now; however, he wasn’t confident that he would be able to get out just yet. No one in the world could truly comprehend all the secrets behind such a Celestial Phenomenon.

Another year passed as Yang Kai silently looked for a way out. The Royal Lord had been patient as he kept a fixed distance from him when, suddenly, Yang Kai’s figure disappeared from the Royal Lord’s sight, as though everything he had seen until now was nothing more than an illusion.

The Royal Lord was slightly shocked, but he soon pulled himself together and imitated Yang Kai’s movements while moving in the same direction.

In the meantime, Yang Kai felt relieved as the sense of danger that had surrounded him for over 10 years disappeared all of a sudden. There was no longer any fog in front of him.

[I’ve finally left!] Yang Kai was elated.

After hesitating between ambushing the Royal Lord and fleeing this place for a moment, he chose the latter. Even though he could certainly catch the Royal Lord off guard, given his strength, it was impossible for him to kill his foe with a single move.

If he couldn’t kill the Royal Lord in one move, he would be tangled up with him again. By then, he wouldn’t be able to get rid of him.

It would still take some time before the Royal Lord could get out of the fog, and while the average cultivator couldn’t move across a large distance in such a short time, as a master of the Dao of Space, Yang Kai stood a great chance to escape the other party’s detection range.

After making up his mind, he hesitated no more. As he manipulated Space Principles, Yang Kai disappeared from the spot.

Three breaths of time later, the Royal Lord also left the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon. As he looked around, he realised Yang Kai was nowhere to be found. Having witnessed Yang Kai’s methods, he knew that this Human must have activated his teleportation technique and left. At that instant, his expression darkened.

Now that Yang Kai had left using Instantaneous Movement, it would be hard for the Royal Lord to find him again. With that said, he wasn’t willing to just give up. After examining the traces of Space Principles, he looked in a particular direction and charged forward.

He initially thought that he had lost him, so he was surprised at the turn of events. Although he had no idea what happened to the Seventh-Order brat, he still had a chance as the other party wasn’t able to flee.

At this moment, Yang Kai was so vexed that he was about to spit blood. He felt that he had never been unluckier in his life. Not long after he escaped one trap, he fell into another.

Even though Instantaneous Movement was a Secret Technique that could help save his life, there was a certain degree of unpredictability with it. It would be fine if he was in a familiar environment as he could accurately arrive at a place of his choice; however, if he wasn’t familiar with the environment, he would have to rely on luck for where he would land as there could be danger waiting for him.

He had used Instantaneous Movement many times in the past, but he had never come across any serious threats while using it. Nevertheless, he suffered a setback this time.

After leaving the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon earlier, he activated Instantaneous Movement and fled, but it never crossed his mind that he would actually land inside a spider’s nest.

There were certain creatures that lived in the void, collectively known as Space Beasts. When Yang Kai left the Star Boundary back then, he ran into a Myriad Facets Insect. He and Zhang Ruo Xi were swallowed by that Space Beast and became separated. Yang Kai was then brought to Seven Wonders Land while it took Zhang Ruo Xi some effort to arrive at Exquisite Paradise.

There were always some Human Masters who guarded the Void Docks of Star Cities and Sects, first to inspect the people entering and leaving to ensure order was maintained, second to fend off the Space Beasts that loved harassing densely populated areas.

It took quite a number of Open Heaven Realm Masters to guard the Void Docks of every Star City to prevent accidents from happening.

Throughout his adventures around the 3,000 Worlds over the years, Yang Kai had come across many Space Beasts. When he was weak, he would stay as far away from Space Beasts as possible, and when he became strong enough, he just disregarded them.

Upon arriving at the Black Ink Battlefield, he never discovered any Space Beasts; after all, the war between the two Races had been ongoing for years, and the Space Beasts that were sensitive to danger usually stayed far away.

Yang Kai had not seen any Space Beasts during the crusade, so he thought that such creatures simply didn’t exist on the Black Ink Battlefield. Therefore, it surprised him when he came across them at this point.

This was the nest of a group of Void Ant Spiders which was located in a dead Universe World. The entire Universe World was covered in spider webs. They seemed to be a family with two adults and five children.

The adult spiders were just as large as Yang Kai’s 70,000 metres Ancient Dragon Form. On the other hand, the five smaller Void Ant Spiders were just 10,000 metres long. They looked like a cross between spiders and ants with hideous appearances and had probably been living here for eons.

Yang Kai felt that the auras exuding from the two adult Void Ant Spiders suggested that they were as formidable as the most powerful Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. It even seemed like they had traces of Divine Spirit bloodlines.

The five smaller spiders were equivalent to Seventh-Order Masters.

Usually, such levels of strength wouldn’t have bothered Yang Kai, the crux of the problem was that the void around the spiders’ nest was filled with webs of different sizes.

Right after he activated Instantaneous Movement from outside the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon, Yang Kai crashed into one of these spider webs. Worse, the webs had a Heaven Sealing Earth Locking property. As soon as he came into contact with the web, he became trapped and was unable to break free from it.

He couldn’t figure out how this family of Void Ant Spiders survived in such an environment. With that said, Space Beasts usually had some unusual powers; therefore, hostile environments wouldn’t bother them.

Thrilled to feel Yang Kai’s aura, the five smaller spiders, which had been hiding in the nest, came over and surrounded him. The two adult spiders never moved, but their eyes reflected Yang Kai’s figure.

Noticing the larger spiders’ stares, Yang Kai felt a crawling sensation on his scalp.

He had already summoned his Azure Dragon Spear and was now battling against the five smaller spiders. Despite the fact that they were only equivalent to Seventh-Order Masters, Yang Kai wouldn’t dare to kill them lest the two parents become enraged.

Furthermore, due to the spider web’s restriction, Yang Kai was in a perilous situation while he was besieged by the small ant spiders. Some spider silk coiled around his spear, making it hard for him to wield his weapon.

“Help!” Yang Kai exclaimed as though the other party was his saviour.

The Royal Lord snorted and ignored him. He had been hunting Yang Kai for over 10 years now. Even though it was a shame that he couldn’t personally kill him, he wouldn’t mind seeing him lose his life here. Having made up his mind, he stood outside the spider webs and waited for Yang Kai’s eventual death.

Seeing that, Yang Kai realised his intention and shouted, “Don’t you want to know what Cang gave me before his death?”

The Royal Lord replied impassively, “Regardless of what it is, it will be useless after you die.”

Yang Kai said through clenched teeth, “I don’t think so. I’ll definitely activate that thing before I die. It’s the last method that Cang left behind to deal with Mo!”

The Royal Lord squinted his eyes, “Tell me more about it.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I won’t tell you about it, and you won’t find out unless you save me from this place!”

“Then die.”

“You’re forcing me to do it!” Yang Kai roared as a golden light radiated from him.

The Royal Lord was instantly astounded, for the golden light indeed contained the aura that Cang had left behind.

“Even if I die, Mo will suffer as well! Mo is in a deep sleep now, so it is definitely unsuspecting of any danger. This thing might not kill Mo, but it’ll certainly injure it!” As Yang Kai spoke, the golden light shone more brightly. The golden light faintly engulfed Yang Kai as though it was ready to bring him out of this place.

The Royal Lord’s expression changed.

The reason he decided to watch on the sidelines and ignore Yang Kai’s plea was that he believed that regardless of what Cang’s trump card was, it would be rendered useless following Yang Kai’s death.

However, it now seemed that if Yang Kai was pushed over the edge, he would activate the trump card; as for what happened after that, the results were completely unpredictable.

The Royal Lord had no idea if Yang Kai was telling the truth, but Mo was the source of the Black Ink Clan. To the Black Ink Clan, it was their Supreme Being, their God, so there was no way the Royal Lord would allow anything to injure Mo.

If Mo was wounded because of him, he would never be able to make up for his mistake.

“Stop!” The Royal Lord roared.

“Cut the crap. If you don’t save me, I’ll make sure Mo suffers!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth and yelled.

The Royal Lord’s expression turned livid. He had never expected to be threatened by Yang Kai in such a situation. Suppressing his fury, he surged his Black Ink Strength, which turned into a dark tide that penetrated the spider webs.

He decided not to kill those Void Ant Spiders and instead tried to corrupt them with Black Ink Strength.

Given the fact that he was a Royal Lord, it should be easy for him to corrupt these Void Ant Spiders. As long as he succeeded, they would become loyal to him, and he would be able to easily capture Yang Kai. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Soon, the dark tide coursed through the void that was filled with spider webs before engulfing the five smaller spiders.

Seeing that, Yang Kai secretly cursed at the Royal Lord for being so cunning.
