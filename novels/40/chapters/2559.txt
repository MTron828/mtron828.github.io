[I don’t think I’ve something on me that someone like the Serene Soul Great Emperor would be interested in, do I?]

[The Myriads Sword? Impossible…]

[Although the Myriads Sword is good, it can’t possibly enter Serene Soul’s eyes. As a Great Emperor, he has all kinds of Emperor Artifacts. Why would he be interested in a mere Myriads Sword?]

[Then, what does he want me to use to exchange?] Yang Kai thought about it over and over again but he couldn’t understand what Serene Soul meant.

“Sir, you wouldn’t happen to be thinking of wanting… This Junior’s life, do you?” Yang Kai laughed awkwardly.

Old Fu sneered as he rebuked, “What use is your life to this King?”

Yang Kai’s face turned ashen. Although he didn’t think that his life was worth much, it was natural to be unhappy when someone said it right in his face that his life was worthless. Had he not cared about the identity of the other party, he would have attacked Serene Soul already.

“Just say whether you agree or not,” Old Fu gazed at Yang Kai in a calm and composed manner, a smile of mockery hanging on his lips.

[How can I agree when you aren’t even speaking clearly? Do you think that this Young Master’s intelligence is like your daughter’s?] After a cold snort, Yang Kai replied, “Sir, since you haven’t made things clear, forgive this Junior for being unable to accept.”

Yang Kai didn’t dare to agree to anything in front of an old monster like him who had lived for who knows how long, so as not to fall into his trap. By then, he would be at others’ mercy.

Old Fu calmly stated, “It’s nothing much, this King just wants to exchange it for your bell!”

As soon as he said this, Yang Kai was greatly shaken and immediately put up his guard.

Exchange it for his bell? Which bell? What other bell did he have apart from the Mountains and Rivers Bell?

[How does he know about it?] Yang Kai had never used the Mountains and Rivers Bell in today’s battle, and the enemies who had seen the Mountains and Rivers Bell were already dead. So, how did the Serene Soul Great Emperor know about it?

Could he sense it? That’s unlikely. The Mountains and Rivers Bell had already been refined by Yang Kai and no one would be able to sense it unless he took it out to deal with them.

But this old fogey spoke so confidently, as if he was certain that Yang Kai had that bell. It really made Yang Kai wonder whether Serene Soul was really bluffing him or was really truly confident.

[He isn’t thinking of killing me and snatching it, is he?] Yang Kai secretly gnashed his teeth. If the Serene Soul Great Emperor was planning this, maintaining his life would indeed become really difficult.

“What bell? What does Sir mean?” Many thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind but there was no change in his expression. Rather, he showed a puzzled look.

Old Fu mockingly looked at him before rebuking with a sneer, “Do you really not know, or are you pretending to not know about it?”

Yang Kai naturally didn’t dare to reveal any flaws, gritting his teeth as he replied, “I ask Sir to make himself clear. This Junior is confused and has no idea what you are talking about.”

Yang Kai had secretly come to a ruthless decision. If this old fogey mentioned the bell again, he would make him watch his daughter die first!

Old Fu, however, just stated, “If that’s the case, this King will not force you.”

Saying so, Emperor Qi wrapped Lin’er before the pair shot towards the outside. In the blink of an eye, they had disappeared into the Ancient Lands Passageway.

He said he was leaving and left. He did it in such a quick and straightforward manner that he didn’t leave Yang Kai any chance to react at all.

“Damn it! You didn’t need to give me the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, but you could have given me some Source Crystals at least! This Young Master was thrashed for no reason…” After a while, Yang Kai finally reacted, cursing loudly in anger.

He had suffered a great loss this time. Lin’er had made things difficult for him again and again, and even put his life in danger by teaming up with the Netherworld Sect. He was then forced to confront the Soul Descent of the Serene Soul Great Emperor… and when all was said and done, he didn’t reap a single benefit…

But soon, Yang Kai felt a cold and moist feeling on his back.

When Serene Soul mentioned the bell, it had really terrified him.

Yang Kai looked left and right warily, not daring to stay in this place anymore. He walked to the dead Netherworld Sect disciples and took away their Space Rings before hurriedly rushing deeper into the Ancient Lands.

After exiting the passage, he could be considered to have officially stepped into the Ancient Wild Lands.

This was a domain that had never been developed and was one of the most dangerous places in the entire Star Boundary. Even when an Emperor Realm Master entered it, he couldn’t guarantee his safety.

In the Ancient Lands, there were countless dangers that were difficult to resist. There were many natural restrictions and ancient relics here, all of them dangerous to anyone who triggered them.

There were even rumours that Divine Spirits were living inside the Ancient Lands, though no one knew whether it was true or false.

After venturing about a hundred kilometres deeper, Yang Kai finally noticed the strangeness of the Ancient Lands.

There was an unknown energy in the air, one that seemed to suppress the strength of cultivators. And the deeper one ventured in, the more obvious this effect was.

The towering old trees soared straight into the clouds, while on the ground, there were many strange flowers and plants that Yang Kai had never seen or heard of before. An ancient and desolate smell constantly blew in his face.

[Wild Force!]

The entire Ancient Wild Lands were filled with this peculiar Wild Force. Naturally, it was derived from primitive energy when the world was first created, and every living being would feel small and insignificant before it. Under the suppression of this energy, any cultivator who had ventured into this land would not be able to exert their full strength!

However, Yang Kai immersed himself in this place for a while and concluded that this Wild Force had no effect on him.

The corrosion spreading into his body was like a breeze blowing on his face; he could ignore it.

With an Ancient Exotic Artifact like the Mountains and Rivers Bell on him, all the Wild Force that invaded his body was actively resolved by it. Realizing this, Yang Kai’s confidence grew.

He had already noticed this somewhat when he drank the Wild Wine. Although he had made some conjectures back then, it wasn’t confirmed until now.

It seemed he occupied a huge advantage in the Ancient Wild Lands with the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Yang Kai was beaming with joy in his heart as he felt fortunate for that particular opportunity in the Shattered Star Sea. If not for him being able to collect the Mountains and Rivers Bell, things would not be so easy for him here.

While walking, he took out a jade slip and compared the surrounding terrain with the map inside. This was the jade slip given to him by Pi San, and it had all the known topography of the Ancient Wild Lands as well as the position of the more dangerous Monster Beasts. Only, the information in the jade slip was incomplete as no one knew how big the entire Ancient Lands was. So far, the cultivators figured they had explored less than a tenth of the Ancient Lands at the cost of countless lives.

But with this jade slip, Yang Kai was still spared from a lot of trouble.

After an hour, he had completely entered the Ancient Lands, where he found a cave and ventured inside.

Who knows which Monster Beast’s lair this was originally, but the cave was dry and spacious, with no owner to be seen. It was unclear whether it had gone out to hunt or was killed by someone or something.

Yang Kai estimated that the latter was far more likely as it was not far from the entrance. The cultivators coming in from the entrance could easily find this place, so generally, Monster Beasts would not be able to survive in places like this.

With a wave of his hand, Yang Kai let out Zhang Ruo Xi and ordered, “I want to heal, stand guard for me. Focus on resisting the Wild Force in the air and call me if there is any movement or if you can’t hold on.”

“Yes!” Zhang Ruo Xi obediently responded. Seeing the horrifying injury on Yang Kai’s chest, her heart inexplicably trembled.

Without any further question, she went and sat at the entrance of the cave, cross-legged. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Inside the cave, Yang Kai took out a bunch of healing pills and threw them into his mouth before he closed his eyes and started refining them.

In fact, his injury wasn’t that serious, and even if he didn’t actively deal with it, it would have only taken him a few days to recover; however, Yang Kai didn’t dare to be careless in this place as even the smell of blood might draw some unnecessary trouble. It really wasn’t worth the risk.

So, he thought about healing his wounds first before rushing to find Xiao Xiao.

Around the wound, his flesh and skin kept squirming, continuing to fill the gap, an eerie sight. Yang Kai’s recuperative ability was already pretty good, so with the assistance of good healing pills, it would only take him one or two days to fully recover.

Outside the cave, Zhang Ruo Xi, following Yang Kai’s instruction, prompted her Source Qi to defend herself.

In the beginning, she was a little worried about the so-called Wild Force; after all, Yang Kai had already mentioned its strange properties before. She knew that all the cultivators inside the Ancient Lands would be suppressed by the Wild Force, and the lower one’s cultivation was, the stronger the suppression was.

Although her cultivation was Third-Order Dao Source Realm, she couldn’t provide any help to Yang Kai on this journey at all. She was even sent inside the Sealed World Bead by Yang Kai during the last part of the Ancient Lands Passageway.

Zhang Ruo Xi hated her weakness, which made it impossible for her to share Yang Kai’s woes and foes, even making her a burden at times. [Sir had such a big wound on his chest. He must have bled a lot; he must be in a lot of pain; he must have been in a lot of danger at that time…]

[Everything I have today was given to me by Sir. Without Sir, I would have long been abducted and dirtied by those ungrateful wolves of the Lu Family. A small family like the Zhang Family would have not been able to gain a foothold in Maplewood City.]

[Not only has Sir saved me, but also the entire Zhang Family. Sir gave me countless cultivation resources, allowing me to have my current achievements.]

[I don’t know why Sir brought me out of the Zhang Family back then, but now I have been travelling with Sir here and there over many years.]

[When will I be able to ward off calamities and danger for Sir? I can’t always be protected by Sir like this, can I? Even if Sir had asked me to take care of his daily life, or tidy up his bed…]

[I haven’t done much of that either…]

Zhang Ruo Xi lightly nibbled her red lips. She felt her chest tighten and a desire to become stronger prompted her to circulate the Secret Arts to cultivate.

This was an unconscious action.

But soon, Zhang Ruo Xi was taken aback and quickly stopped.

She had no other choice as she suddenly remembered that she was in the Ancient Wild Lands and the World Energy here was filled with Wild Force. This place wasn’t suitable for cultivation, and if she absorbed too much Wild Force, not only would she be unable to assimilate it, it would also be detrimental to her cultivation.

Realizing this, Zhang Ruo Xi’s face immediately paled as she quickly checked on her condition.

But she found nothing serious, leaving Zhang Ruo Xi rather confused by her own situation.

Because she found that although she had inadvertently absorbed some Wild Force, it didn’t appear to be harmful to her. Rather, it spread around her body before it assimilated with her own strength.

And during this short round of cultivation, the efficiency of cultivation was almost twice that of before!

[What’s going on?]

Zhang Ruo Xi looked surprised and a little puzzled. She wanted to ask Yang Kai what was happening; after all, he knew many more things than her, but he was recuperating at the moment and she didn’t want to bother him.
