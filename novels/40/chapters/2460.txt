Yin Le Sheng replied with a smile, “There is nothing wrong with my head, rather I am thinking quite clearly right now, because I know that if I want to leave this place, Brother Yang’s help is indispensable.”

Yang Kai raised his brow and asked, laughing, “I understand what Brother Yin means, but… why do you think I will take you out?”

Yin Le Sheng quickly asked, “Didn’t you want to inquire about the puppet of yours? Isn’t that puppet very useful to you?”

Hearing him mention Xiao Xiao, Yang Kai’s face immediately sank as he shouted, “Where is he!?”

Yin Le Sheng smiled as he spoke in a calm and composed manner, “Brother Yang really values it very much. Since Brother Yang has something he wants, and I have something I want, why don’t we make a deal?”

Yang Kai ground his teeth. Although he couldn’t wait to beat the shit out of Yin Le Sheng and force him to give up the information on Xiao Xiao’s location, brute force couldn’t solve the problem at this moment. As long as Yin Le Sheng didn’t tell him about Xiao Xiao, Yang Kai would be at the end of his wits, and even if Yin Le Sheng did tell him something, Yang Kai couldn’t say for sure whether he was speaking the truth or lying.

Compared to killing Yin Le Sheng, Yang Kai would rather learn about Xiao Xiao’s situation. After pondering for a while, he agreed with a nod, “How should we trade? Let’s hear it.”

Yin Le Sheng replied, “You take me out of this damned place and I will truthfully tell you about the whereabouts of the puppet.”

Yang Kai sneered, “How do I know you’ll tell me the truth? Maybe you don’t even know where Xiao Xiao is.”

“I do know!” Yin Le Sheng’s face turned serious, “There is no harm in telling you a bit. Your puppet did fall into the Eastern Territory with me back then, but I couldn’t subdue it with my strength at that time, so I simply followed after it, looking for an opportunity, but unfortunately, I failed at the last moment. Now, as to where it went in the end, only I know. No one else in this world knows. Brother Yang, you’d best think this through. If we pulled out all our cards and fought here, we both would be defeated and wounded. On the other hand, the deal I’m proposing is very fair; we both get what we need.”

Yang Kai’s face turned colder as he stated, “Tell me first and I will immediately send you out. I promise that I will not do anything to you!”

Yin Le Sheng denied with a chuckle, “Do you think I’m a three-year-old child?”

“What do you think we should do then?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but glower.

The two of them endlessly quarrelled with each other while the others watched in surprise. They didn’t know what Yang Kai and Yin Le Sheng were arguing about, but they managed to glean some clues after listening for a while.

Zhang Hao suddenly asked, “Brother Yin, can he take us out of here?”

Yin Le Sheng replied, glancing at him, “If he can’t, then no one can.”

“Why?” Zhang Hao asked in surprise, “This is the Void, if we can’t break through the barriers of space, there’s no way to leave. So many of us tried breaking it together, but it didn’t work, so why can he do it alone?”

Yin Le Sheng furrowed his brow as he explained, “Because Brother Yang is proficient in the Dao of Space.”

“Proficient in the Dao of Space!?” Zhang Kai was shocked and delighted when he heard this, turning to stare at Yang Kai with a blazing gaze, as if he had found hope of survival.

The other two were also extremely excited and they secretly licked their lips,

“This Young Master is indeed proficient in the Dao of Space, but what does that have to do with you lot?” Yang Kai glared at the three, feeling disgruntled.

Zhang Hao said, wearing a smiling face, “Hehe, Brother Yang, we can be considered friends after a fight. Now only a few of us are alive, so if you can really leave this place, why not take us out with you? Rest assured, we will definitely repay you generously in the future for this favour.”

“Yes, yes, we will etch Brother Yang’s kindness into our hearts and will definitely return the gesture to you in the future!”

“Brother Yang, it’s always better to have many friends, if you come to my Western Territory, this Sun will definitely welcome you with open arms!”

The two started yelling along with Zhang Hao, pleadingly looking at Yang Kai.

“Fuck off!” Yang Kai impatiently lashed out.

Zhang Hao’s face turned colder after hearing this and he glared at Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, don’t be too stubborn. We might not be at our peaks right now, but if we team up, you won’t be able to defeat us. Don’t force us to take a hard stance against you.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “This Young Master wasn’t afraid when there were forty of you, so what can just the four of you do to me now? If you want to die, you are welcome to give it a try.”

Zhang Hao’s face turned stiff all of a sudden because he knew that Yang Kai was stating the truth. Before, forty of them were unable to do anything to Yang Kai, so now that there were just four of them, the chances of them being able to defeat him weren’t high. Not to mention, a cultivator proficient in the Dao of Space was harder to deal with than ordinary opponents. If Yang Kai ever found he was at a disadvantage in a frontal conflict, he could simply run away and no one would be able to stop him.

Yang Kai ignored Zhang Hao and the other two and turned to Yin Le Sheng and stated in a cold voice, “Since you want to make a deal with me, then come up with something that will convince us both, otherwise, you will die today. At worst, I will go to the Eastern Territory and slowly look for Xiao Xiao.”

Yin Le Sheng’s face sank as he asked, “Brother Yang, how can you be sure that you can kill me?”

Yang Kai pursed his lips and stated, “In this place, I can make you die without a burial with a wave of my hand. Tell me, do you still think I can’t kill you?”

Saying so, Yang Kai really just waved his hand and immediately, the surrounding Void Turbulence seemed to have received some kind of order and began sweeping towards Yin Le Sheng like a long river.

Yin Le Sheng jumped back in fright and quickly avoided it.

After regaining his footing, his face turned extremely pale.

He originally believed that, with his remaining trump cards, he didn’t need to be afraid of Yang Kai, but now it seemed that this special environment not only didn’t restrain Yang Kai, but it even invisibly increased his strength. If they really fought, Yin Le Sheng estimated he didn’t have even a twenty percent chance of winning!

[I must quickly leave here, lest some mishap occurs!]

Realizing this, Yin Le Sheng quickly said, “Brother Yang, look at this!”

Saying so, he casually tossed something to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai wasn’t afraid that he would play petty tricks at this moment, so he reached out and caught this object, scanning it with his Divine Sense before speaking in surprise, “Oh? A Soul Contract?”

Yin Le Sheng raised his brow, “Since Brother Yang recognizes it, nothing more need be said.”

A Soul Contract was a product made by the Palace Master of the Eastern Territory’s Serene Soul Palace, Serene Soul Great Emperor, when he was bored and had ample time on his hands. It was almost equivalent to a contract that mortals would use, but the ones who signed it, did so with their Souls. Because of a peculiar power that was used to refine Soul Contracts, neither of the parties that signed one could violate the content of the contract.

Soul Contracts were extremely rare, and Yang Kai had only seen one in the past, but that was enough to recognize this for what it was and what it meant. As long as the two parties signing the contract swore with their Souls, they could not lie or violate the terms unless they wanted to court death.

Because Soul Contracts were made by the Serene Soul Great Emperor, and the Serene Soul Great Emperor’s Serene Soul Palace was in the Eastern Territory, Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect’s disciples had greater access to Soul Contracts.

“Is this enough to show my sincerity?” Yin Le Sheng looked at Yang Kai with a grim look on his face.

Yang Kai agreed with a nod, “Of course, there is no problem with this Soul Contract here.”

Yin Le Sheng stated, “Good, then you will send me out of here, and I will tell you the location of that puppet.”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and agreed, nodding, “No problem.”

Zhang Hao anxiously cried, “Brother Yin, take me too, my Brahma Holy Land and your Netherworld Sect are allies. You can’t sit back and watch me die!”

Yin Le Sheng frowned before glancing at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stated with a snort, “Zhang Hao’s fate has already been decided by another. He must die here.”

Zhang Hao’s eyes bulged as he angrily asked, “Who? Who wants my life!?”

Yang Kai coldly looked at him and replied with a snort, “The one you abandoned and left behind naturally wants you dead!”

Zhang Hao was dumbfounded as he absentmindedly muttered, “Zhang Xian?”

He then angrily shouted, “Impudence! I am the Senior Brother, and he actually wants to kill me! That ingrate!”

Yang Kai shook his head and ignored him altogether, turning back to Yin Le Sheng and saying, “Brother Yin, swear!”

“Good!” Yin Le Sheng nodded and immediately swore with his Soul that if Yang Kai was willing to safely send him out, he would definitely inform Yang Kai of Xiao Xiao’s location.

Immediately afterwards, Yang Kai also swore on his Soul.

When they poured in their Spiritual Energy, the Soul Contract suddenly started glowing as it split into two, before it shot straight into Yang Kai and Yin Le Sheng’s bodies, making the two softly grunt. Mysteriously, they felt bound by an invisible shackle.

Both of them knew that this was the effect of the Soul Contract.

“Where is Xiao Xiao?” Yang Kai squinted his eyes at Yin Le Sheng.

Yin Le Sheng smiled before his lips moved, transmitting his voice directly to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s face changed as he confirmed in amazement, “There?”

Yin Le Sheng asked in surprise, “Oh? So Brother Yang actually knows that place?”

Yang Kai’s face turned ashen as he responded, “I heard someone mention it not long ago. Are you sure it went there?”

Yin Le Sheng replied, “I saw it with my own eyes, how can I not be certain? Naturally, at the beginning, I didn’t know what that was, but after having lived in the Eastern Territory for a while, I learned about the dangers of that place. Fortunately, I didn’t go in at that time, otherwise I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to meet Brother Yang today.”

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly. Now, he was even more worried about Xiao Xiao compared to when he knew nothing about his whereabouts.

Yin Le Sheng had already signed a Soul Contract with him, and was bound by its power, so he couldn’t have lied. But if Xiao Xiao was really in ‘that place’, then it might really be disastrous for him.

Yin Le Sheng, on the other hand, was all smiles as he spoke, “Okay then, this Yin has truthfully told Brother Yang everything he wanted to know, now it’s about time you fulfil your end of the agreement.”

Yang Kai angrily glanced at him before he stretched his hands out, inserting it into the Void.

Yin Le Sheng intently watched, and after seeing a Void Crack truly get torn open by Yang Kai, a look of surprise and happiness appeared on his face as he praised, “Brother Yang is really impressive. If you manage to break through to the Emperor Realm, your achievements will be second only to Senior Li Wu Yi.”

“Get out!” Yang Kai lashed out with a cold snort.

Yin Le Sheng burst into laughter, “Then this Yin will take his leave. Until we meet again!”

“The day we meet again will be the day you die!” Yang Kai stated, grinding his teeth angrily.

Yin Le Sheng didn’t care about this threat. His figure flickered as he rushed into the Void Crack, instantly appearing on the opposite side. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When Zhang Hao and the others saw this, they also eagerly followed, using all means at their disposal to reach the Void Crack and escape from this place.

Yang Kai just coldly looked at them, but didn’t bother to stop them.
