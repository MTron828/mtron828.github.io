Hearing this, Yang Kai frowned, “Since the Core is so important, the Black Ink Clan must have also realized it already, so why would they return it just like that?”

“En,” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao let out a long sigh. The Black Ink Clan definitely wouldn’t return something so important to the Human Race. If she was the Royal Lord, she would rather destroy the Core than let the Humans take it back.

This was also the reason why she had been attacking the Royal Lord so frequently as of late, only to return empty-handed.

“Can’t we refine another one?” Yang Kai asked.

Clearly, there was no hope of getting it back, and Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao must also know this, but she was just doing what she could while leaving the rest up to the Heavens.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao shook her head, “The Core is an ancient artifact and the method to refine it has long been lost in the annals of history. Although the Artifact Refining Great Grandmasters in the Pass have been researching the problem, they haven’t found any clues as of yet.”

The loss of Great Evolution’s Core was only discovered during the recent restoration so they were currently pressed for time. Even Grandmaster Ma Fan and the other Artifact Refining Great Grandmaster were at a loss.

Refining a new Core would not only be extremely difficult, it would also cost an astronomical amount of resources and take an absurd amount of time, probably 1,000 years at best.

1,000 years… a lot of things could happen over such a long period.

The Human Race currently had the advantage in various Theatres, especially in Great Evolution Theatre, so there would not be a better time to launch the crusade and eliminate all the Royal Cities in one fell swoop. If they delayed things for too long, the Black Ink Clan might be able to rise from the ashes once more.

If they couldn’t find the Core of Great Evolution Pass by the time the crusade began, the Great Evolution Army would no longer be able to borrow the power of the Great Pass and would have no choice but to fly over on their Warships to confront the enemy.

In that case, the Great Evolution Army’s casualties would definitely be higher than the other Human Race Armies.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai couldn’t help in this matter. The only thing he could do was heal Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s injuries, hoping that the Royal Lord wouldn’t be able to take her harassment eventually and return the Core.

Although the chances were slim.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai finally understood why the higher-ups had spent so much manpower and resources to rebuild Great Evolution Pass after retaking the Pass after listening to Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao.

He did question why they were so heavily fortifying Great Evolution Pass in the past. Though he did not put it in words and kept such thoughts to himself, he couldn’t help feeling that this was a wasteful endeavour as the Black Ink Clan in Great Evolution Theatre had already been routed and trapped in the Royal City. Thus, restoring the Pass without the Black Ink Clan being capable of attacking them seemed somewhat pointless.

Thus, he thought of it not as repelling assaults by the Black Ink Clan, but rather, for the sake of sentiment.

Now it was clear he had made too many incorrect assumptions.

The various repairs done to Great Evolution Pass were not just for the sake of sentiment or appearance, but rather in preparation for the crusade. As long as they could find the Core, the entire Pass would be their greatest reliance in the coming war.

…

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao continued going out once every two or three months, returning each time with varying injuries.

If she ended up in this state, the Royal Lord definitely wouldn’t have fared any better; after all, he had yet to recover from his past injuries. If it weren’t for the power of the Black Ink Nest in the Royal City, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao would have killed him already.

The current Royal Lord was simply struggling at death’s door.

Whether Great Evolution Pass could get its Core back, the Great Evolution Army would definitely defeat the Black Ink Clan Army when the crusade began. That would be the time for him to lose his head.

However, as time passed, Yang Kai could clearly feel that Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s temper was getting worse and worse. More often than not, she would start cursing the Royal Lord for being ignorant and calling him a stubborn oaf when she returned from the Royal City.

Every time this happened, Yang Kai would choose to remain silent.

Rather, it would be even stranger if the Royal Lord really gave her Great Evolution Pass’ Core just because she went to him and asked for it.

It was just a thought, one Yang Kai didn’t dare say out loud, afraid he would be cursed along with the Royal Lord.

Today, when Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao returned from her trip to the Royal City, she was so gloomy that it felt as if darkness was oozing from her. She landed in Yang Kai’s Small Universe, began healing from her injuries, and began her usual rant about the Royal Lord.

All this went in Yang Kai’s left ear and out through the right as he kept nodding in agreement like a chicken pecking rice.

This had already happened many times before, so Yang Kai had long since become accustomed to it. Now well prepared, he casually took out a stick of candied fruit and handed it to her. The Old Ancestor took a sidelong glance at him before accepting it, but she still did not forget to scold the Royal Lord while she aggressively crunched on the snack.

Yang Kai remained calm, quietly studying the Daos of Time and Space.

Suddenly, Yang Kai raised his head, looking at Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao.

The Old Ancestor was just about to unleash another barrage of curses, but when she noticed his unusual movement, she furrowed her brow and asked, “What is it?”

Yang Kai asked, “Old Ancestor, you said that the Royal Lord keeps denying that he took Great Evolution Pass’ Core, yes?”

This was not the first time the Old Ancestor had mentioned this, but Yang Kai had never taken it seriously; after all, there was nothing he could do to help in this situation except aid the Old Ancestor with her recovery.

While the Old Ancestor was recuperating, most of Yang Kai’s attention was focused on comprehending the Dao of Time and the Dao of Space to improve in the short peaceful time he had on hand. And he had indeed gained a lot over the past few months.

The advancement of his Dragon Bloodline had improved his mastery and understanding of the Dao of Time, and by refining and absorbing the abundance Space Dao Essence in Su Yan’s Phoenix Nest he had enhanced his comprehension of the Dao of Space.

When the Old Ancestor mentioned this matter again just now though, Yang Kai suddenly realised that he had overlooked something very important.

The Old Ancestor rebuked with a snort, “Would he dare to admit to such a thing if he did it?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before asking, “If Great Evolution’s Core was still there when the Black Ink Clan occupied Great Evolution Pass, would the Black Ink Clan be able to use it?”

The Old Ancestor explained, “Although Great Evolution Pass was created by Humans, in the end, it’s just a giant Mobile Palace Artifact, so with sufficient energy anyone can control it. The Royal Lord is comparable to a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so he wouldn’t be able to control Great Evolution Pass on his own; however, if with the help of the Territory Lords under him, controlling Great Evolution Pass wouldn’t be a problem. After all, the Black Ink Clan has many Territory Lords.”

“Then this situation is a bit strange,” Yang Kai looked at Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao, “If they were able to move Great Evolution Pass, why did the Black Ink Clan just leave it here? If I were the Royal Lord, I would have brought Great Evolution Pass back to the vicinity of the Royal City to act as another fortified base of operation. I might have even directly treated Great Evolution Pass as my own Royal City.”

The Black Ink Clan Royal Cities were nowhere near as sturdy as the Human Race’s Great Passes. By making such a Pass into his Royal City, the Royal Lord would never need to worry about the Human’s taking it back, which would give him a huge boost in security and face.

He believed that no Royal Lord could resist this temptation.

The Old Ancestor slightly frowned, “Actually, I’ve also been wondering about this issue as well…”

Yang Kai’s eyes slightly lit up, “Great Evolution Pass’ Core really may not be in the hands of the Black Ink Clan.”

The Old Ancestor shook her head, denying the possibility, “But if the Core is not in the hands of the Black Ink Clan, where could it be?”

“Could it have been destroyed?” Yang Kai asked, “Back then, the Old Ancestor of Great Evolution Pass died in battle. Perhaps someone felt that the situation was dire enough for the Humans that they decided to destroy the Core rather than let it fall into enemy hands.”

At a time of crisis, something as important as the Core would definitely be destroyed rather than left behind.

“While that’s possible, it’s not very likely. Every Great Pass’ Core is extremely sturdy, so only a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could destroy it. When Great Evolution Pass fell, there was only one Old Ancestor here, and at that time, he should have been fighting with the two Royal Lords, so how could he have had time to destroy the Core?”

“Then there’s only one possibility,” Yang Kai stated as he put away his Small Universe and beckoned her, “Old Ancestor, please follow me.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s face was filled with confusion, nonetheless, she quickly chased after him, asking, “What are you thinking?”

Yang Kai shook his head, stating, “I’m not certain, but we’ll know after giving it a try. Old Ancestor, please wait patiently.”

Xiao Xiao didn’t pursue the matter any further.

Soon, the two arrived at Great Evolution’s Space Array Hall.

When the soldiers on duty saw the Old Ancestor arrive, they quickly stepped forward and bowed.

One of the soldiers asked, “Does the Old Ancestor want to go to another Great Pass?”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao shook her head and pointed at Yang Kai, “It’s his business, you should ask him.”

The man nodded and turned to Yang Kai, “Where is Junior Brother Yang going?”

Yang Kai thought for a moment before stating, “I’ll have to trouble Senior Brothers to activate the Hyper Space Array.”

The guards immediately started getting everything set up.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked, furrowing her brow, “Do you suspect that when Great Evolution Pass was breached, someone sent the Core to another Great Pass using the Space Array?”

Yang Kai nodded, “If the Core is not in the hands of the Black Ink Clan, and it has not been destroyed, then that is the only possibility left. After all, they did not outright destroy the Space Array, believing that the Humans Race would come back one day to retake the Pass.”

No one knew what had happened 30,000 years ago; after all, on the day Great Evolution Pass fell, except for those who had been captured, almost everyone, from the Old Ancestors to the ordinary soldiers, was wiped out.

However, just as Yang Kai had said, if the Core was not in the hands of the Black Ink Clan and was not destroyed, the only way to send it away was through the Space Array!

Perhaps on that day, someone had stepped through this Space Array, shouldering the heavy responsibility of preserving Great Evolution Pass’ Core!

“If it really was sent to another Great Pass, why would that Great Pass not report it?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao shook her head in response.

Yang Kai answered with a smile, “If they don’t know, how can they report it?”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao was confused.

At this moment, the guard on duty stated, “Junior Brother Yang, everything is set. Where should we set the location?”

Yang Kai stated without hesitation, “Wind and Cloud Pass!”

Saying so, he stepped onto the Array. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The Space Array hummed and energy surged as the lines of the Array flashed, enveloping Yang Kai’s figure in a dazzling glow. By the time the light disappeared, Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen.

At the same time, inside Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array Hall lit up. The guards promptly reported the situation, while searching for the source of the disturbance.

Soon, they found out that it was someone arriving from Great Evolution Pass.

A moment later, Yang Kai’s figure appeared on the Space Array.

“Junior Brother Yang!” A Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master cupped his fist and greeted Yang Kai. The last time Yang Kai came here, he was also on duty, so he immediately recognized Yang Kai.

Yang Kai returned the greeting, “Greetings, Senior Brother.”

The Seventh-Order Master asked, “What business does Junior Brother Yang have here?”

Under normal circumstances, very few people would travel between the Great Passes, because each teleportation would consume a massive amount of resources. If it was just information that needed to be shared, then a jade slip would be sufficient.

The Evil Purging Divine Spears, Purifying Black Ink Pills, and even the refining method of the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors were all shared with other Great Passes by sending out jade slips.

It had to be something very important for Yang Kai to teleport here in person.

Yang Kai stated outright, “There are indeed some things I need to discuss, may I ask which Army Commander is free right now? I would like to ask them about something.”

The Seventh-Order guard agreed with a nod, “Junior Brother, please wait a moment, allow me…”

Before this person could finish, a voice came from outside, “What’s the matter?”

The moment the voice rang in everyone’s ear, a figure stepped into the hall.

Everyone quickly bowed.

Yang Kai looked over and saw an old acquaintance, Wind and Cloud Pass’ Eastern Army Commander, Yuan Xing Ge!
