But if all the Open Heaven Realm Masters in Void Land were dispatched at the same time, what would happen to the Headquarters? It took a huge amount of resources to construct the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array, so how could they just give it up? Not to mention the more than ten 600,000 disciples Yang Kai brought over from the Star Boundary to Void Land. It was impossible for him to abandon them.

In short, with Void Land‚Äôs current situation, they had to choose between the Headquarters or the Star City to care for. It was obvious to everyone, and worry filled their faces as soon as they heard Yang Kai‚Äôs words.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, ‚ÄúI have a plan, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

If it was before, Yang Kai may not have come up with this idea. Void Land was his roots, the foundation of his foothold in the 3,000 Worlds. Hundreds of thousands of disciples lived here, so he would be reluctant to give it up no matter what. He would rather allow the Star City to slowly deteriorate. Doing so would likely lead to Void Star City existing in name only within a few years.

But after learning about Bi Xi, a very bold idea crept into Yang Kai‚Äôs mind!

Of course, if this idea was to be realized, Old Man Bi Xi would need to cooperate with them. Yang Kai felt that this wouldn‚Äôt be much of an issue though.

Developing the Star City, expanding its scale, and re-establishing its popularity was a necessity to ensure Void Land‚Äôs continued growth.

For one, without the stable income provided by the Star City, the cultivation resources in Void Land would become a problem sooner rather than later. For another, the High-Rank Yin Element material that Yang Kai needed might be found in this Star City if it expanded enough.

The ambush by the Hundred Sect Alliance made Yang Kai realize that there were some Cave Heavens and Paradises that were already getting anxious to bring him down, and were prepared to suffocate him, a potential future threat, while he was still in the cradle.

In this case, it was impossible for him to search for the cultivation resources he needed outside; otherwise, he would be creating chances for others to kill him!

The Proprietress told him before that she would help him look for a High-Rank Yin Element treasure, but even as a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, the Proprietress would need to be extremely lucky to obtain such a rare and valuable resource.

It was not that Yang Kai did not trust the Proprietress, but the current situation gave him a new sense of urgency. He needed to improve his strength, and fast. If he could get what he needed himself, he would not need to trouble the Proprietress.

Yang Kai still did not know that the Proprietress had already stormed into a Forbidden Zone with the three shop-hands from First Inn, just to look for a High-Rank Yin Element material for him inside. With the presence of the Proprietress, there was a high chance of success.

It was precisely because of this news that Kong Feng had rushed the ambush with the Hundred Sect Alliance; otherwise, it would be too late once the Proprietress returned and Yang Kai managed to condense a High-Order Yin Element Power.

In the current situation, if Yang Kai could not search for resources outside, he could only wait for others to deliver what he needed to his door. But if he had nothing to offer them, how was he going to attract others to trade here?

Therefore, the reputation of Void Star City needed to be raised, and all he could use now was the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill.

Yang Kai was aware of the various risks that selling the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill could bring, but he had no choice. Compared to the risks involved, the possible gains were far greater.

High-Rank materials were hard to find, but Yang Kai was sure that the major Cave Heavens and Paradises would have some! So, to get his hands on a High-Rank Yin Element treasure, he would need to start with the Cave Heavens and Paradises!

There were 36 Cave Heavens and 72 Paradises. While he was an eyesore to some and they wanted to clip his wings before he could fly, some just stood by and watched idly, while a few even wanted to win him over. There were differing opinions about him; however, regardless of which Cave Heaven or Paradise it was, none of them would be willing to watch him achieve the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm directly. As proof, Qu Hua Shang from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven proposed he marry into their Sect, but even that came with the prerequisite that he only break through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

It could be said that Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had given him the warmest attitude, but could Yang Kai accept such a condition? His foundation was so solid that if he did not achieve the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm directly, he would regret it for the rest of his life. So, even though he had a close personal relationship with Qu Hua Shang, Yang Kai did not hesitate to reject Yin-Yang Cave Heaven‚Äôs proposal.

He was well aware that all troubles would be gone as long as he joined Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, but the stability that came at the cost of his own future might not last forever, for he feared that his regrets would overwhelm him in the future and hinder his Martial Dao.

No Cave Heaven or Paradise would allow him to break through to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, but that was only while Yang Kai was not qualified to speak and trade with them on even terms. However, with the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills in his possession, Yang Kai was sure they would be moved.

As long as they were tempted, there would be a possibility for an exchange!

Aside from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, there just might be a cultivator out in the vast 3,000 Worlds who possessed a High-Rank Yin Element material. However, due to its exceedingly high value, even if someone did obtain such a treasure, they may not have the courage to take it out. There would probably be some who possessed such treasures but kept them hidden. People like this probably would not be very strong, but they may have descendants or Disciples who could possibly advance to the Open Heaven Realm.

Regardless of the circumstances, the High-Rank Yin Element treasure that Yang Kai needed had to fall into the Star City, and using the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was the best bait!

With all these considerations, the expansion of the Star City became inevitable.

Regarding the matter of Void Land and Void Star City, Yang Kai had made a decision. Since he said that he would take care of everything, even if others were still feeling doubtful, they dared not say anything more.

Immediately afterwards, Yang Kai ordered a number of Open Heaven Realm cultivators to head to the subordinate Sects under Void Land in order to ask them to contribute some territory to expand the Star City!

Void Land was not the only great force in Void Territory; there were also 7 Third Class great forces such as Golden Light Dock and Soaring Crane Sect, but even the strongest among these Third Class great forces were still just Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. They used to serve Seven Wonders Land, so after Seven Wonders Land was replaced by Void Land, they naturally followed the lead of Void Land.

In the 3,000 Worlds, the structure of these great forces had always been a hierarchical one.

Each of these Third Class great forces watched over a few Universe Worlds. Now that Yang Kai had requested to expand the scale of the Star City, they agreed, as it was not a big deal, nor did they dare to refuse to contribute some Spirit Peaks from their Universe Worlds to the process.

After the discussion was over, the crowd dispersed, and Yang Kai made another trip to Dragon Sons‚Äô Peak.

Now that Bi Xi lived on that Spirit Peak, there had to be a name for it, and Yang Kai took it upon himself to name it ‚ÄòDragon Sons‚Äô Peak‚Äô.

They met and talked, and Yang Kai left after less than a stick of incense. Yang Kai came for a favour this time, and since it was just a small effort for Old Man Bi Xi, he did not refuse.

After a few days, everything was prepared.

Yang Kai stood in the air above Void Land, while a group of Open Heaven Realm Masters looked up from below. Waiting silently below were not just the many Open Heaven Realm Masters, but also many other cultivators who had received the news.

Everyone in Void Land, regardless of who, had received the same instructions, ‚ÄúDo not enter seclusion that cannot be interrupted, because there would be a lot of movement in Void Land today. If one was disturbed at a critical moment, they may be injured.‚Äù

Yang Kai personally sent someone to pass down this order, and everyone naturally attached great importance to it.

The several Great Emperors gathered together, and Zhan Wu Hen looked at the sky in confusion, muttering, ‚ÄúWhat is that brat doing?‚Äù

Mo Huang urged, ‚ÄúWhy not just go and ask if you want to know?‚Äù

Zhan Wu Hen turned to look at him, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you ask?‚Äù

Mo Huang shrugged, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll know in a moment anyway, why bother asking?‚Äù

After speaking, Mo Huang and Zhan Wu Hen looked at each other for a moment before they turned away from each other.

How noble were the two Great Emperors back in the Star Boundary? When faced with this situation, they would definitely rush forward without hesitation to demand ‚ÄòBrat, what are you doing?‚Äô And that brat would probably not dare to hide anything.

But now they did not think of asking at all. It was not that they had no courage, rather it was because Yang Kai was now dealing with all kinds of Open Heaven Realm Masters, and they were not capable enough to interfere.

They were not able to help in the battle against foreign enemies just recently, which really made them, the Great Emperors, very uneasy.

Mo Huang took a breath and declared, ‚ÄúWe have to advance to the Open Heaven Realm as soon as possible!‚Äù

All the Great Emperors nodded like chickens pecking rice.

Elsewhere, Yue He and Mo Mei came together, ‚ÄúBig Sister Yue He, what is Sect Master doing?‚Äù Mo Mei asked curiously.

Yue He shook her head slowly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Young Master just said that there may be a large movement today, but that everyone doesn‚Äôt need to panic.‚Äù

Mo Mei was surprised, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know either?‚Äù

...

In Void Land, the closest person to Yang Kai outside his wives was definitely Yue He, so Mo Mei naturally thought Yue He would know something about this, but even she had no clue.

Yue He smiled slightly, ‚ÄúSince Young Master has given such an order, he must have his own plans. We just need to wait and watch.‚Äù

Mo Mei nodded and agreed, still puzzled. The meeting before was regarding the Star City‚Äôs expansion and raising its popularity. In fact, Yang Kai had also immediately sent representatives to their subordinate forces to get them to contribute land to expand the size of the Star City.

The various signs showed that Yang Kai would be focusing on Void Star City, and manpower was needed to develop the Star City, so why were they all assembled here in the Headquarters, just waiting?

As they were all wondering, they heard Yang Kai‚Äôs booming voice from above, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time, Senior!‚Äù

From the depths of Void Land came the voice of the turtle-shelled old man from that day, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a minor matter, everyone stand firm!‚Äù

When the words fell, rumbling sounds suddenly came from all over Void Land, and the ground shook violently. Countless cultivators lost their balance and many almost fell to the ground, forcing them to fly up into the sky.

In an instant, the sky above Void Land was densely filled with human figures.

A terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Void Land, as if a sleeping Dragon was awakening. The aura was so powerful that it even terrified Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters like Yue He and Mo Mei.

Fortunately, the aura was retracted a moment later; otherwise, the hundreds of thousands of weak disciples in Void Land would not have been able to survive.

With such a big movement, Void Land seemed like it was about to collapse, and everyone was naturally terrified.

...

Mo Mei turned her head to look around, trying to figure out what was happening, but her eyes soon bulged as she pointed in a certain direction and exclaimed, ‚ÄúBig Sister Yue He, look over there!‚Äù
