Yang Kai’s gaze fell coldly upon the couple.

Bai Lu was sweating profusely, and his voice trembled as he said, “What do you want? I am the Young Master of Profound Thunder Pavilion! If something happens to me, you’ll be doomed!”

He was clearly aware that he was no match for Yang Kai, so all he could do was bring up his identity in the hopes that Yang Kai would take it into account before attacking him.

“Scram!” Was all Yang Kai said.

Bai Lu jolted and looked greatly relieved. He turned and ran, even forgetting Yan Xue Man as he fled, causing her to stomp her foot angrily before chasing after him.

A short distance away, the pale-faced Yan Qing pushed himself up from the ground. He cast a fearful gaze in Yang Kai’s direction, then with a leap, he hurriedly chased after Bai Lu as well. Though he had lost an arm, he still had his Emperor Realm cultivation and his life was not in danger. But now, he was disabled for life.

“Yao’er!” Yang Kai turned to her, calling her name softly.

The sound of her name was so simple, yet like a sharp blade it pierced through and dispelled the cloud of confusion in Ji Yao’s gaze.

Ji Yao’s delicate frame trembled, and she suddenly regained her senses, “Honoured Master?”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh in relief, and asked cautiously, “Just now… What happened to you?”

Ji Yao frowned a little, “Just now? What happened just now?”

She seemed to have no recollection of what had just happened and looked around, then exclaimed in surprise, “Where are those three annoying people?”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “I beat them and sent them running, they’re long gone!”

Ji Yao glanced at the fresh blood on the ground, and knew that Yang Kai had indeed done so, “You should’ve killed them. I already said I wasn’t selling the ship, yet they wouldn’t leave me alone. Who knows how many times they’ve coerced people to buy or sell things.”

“Yes, yes, I should have killed them,” Yang Kai didn’t dare say too much, so he just went along with her, then asked anxiously. “Yao’er, how are you feeling right now?”

Ji Yao looked at him curiously, “Why? I’m feeling fine. You should go inside and rest, Honoured Master, we’ll be able to return to the valley in just a few more days.”

“I think you should put away the ship for now,” said Yang Kai, “We’ll look for a place to rest first.”

Ji Yao just had a sudden relapse, and Yang Kai was unsure if this was because she had been using her power a lot recently. He didn’t dare to let her steer the ship again. If she fell into confusion again, then there would be trouble.

It would probably be good to let her rest.

Ji Yao naturally obeyed Yang Kai’s instructions and immediately retrieved the ship. She then flew forward alongside Yang Kai.

After half a day had passed, a city appeared before them. They landed, walked up to the city gates, and successfully entered the city after paying a small sum of Source Crystals.

It was a flourishing city, with streams of people busily coming and going. The street was extremely wide, with shops selling a vast array of exquisite products lining its sides.

The two found an inn and entered.

The innkeeper behind the counter looked at Yang Kai and Ji Yao, and asked with a smile, “Looking for accommodations?”

Yang Kai snorted, “Why else would we be here?”

The innkeeper’s smile became strained, “Then, would you like one room or two rooms?”

Yang Kai frowned and cast Ji Yao a glance, then said, “One premium room.”

He did not quite dare to let Ji Yao out of his sight right now, as it would also be easier to observe her if they stayed together. He did not have other intentions in mind.

Ji Yao naturally had no objections either. To her, it was only natural that she would stay in the same room as her Honoured Master.

The innkeeper, however, cast a meaningful look at Yang Kai and gave him a knowing smile. He took out a room tag and handed it over respectfully, saying, “Fifth floor, room A3. Please rest assured, dear guest, that this humble inn has had great Masters place Spirit Arrays in every room, to guarantee that your privacy would be protected. No matter what kind of noise is made, it cannot be heard from outside.”

As he said the last part, his eyebrows waggled, and he looked salacious!

“Haha…” Yang Kai gave him a fake smile as he took the room tag, “Price?”

“Ten thousand Low-Rank Source Crystals!” The innkeeper answered smilingly.

Yang Kai retrieved the sum with a wave of the hand and tossed them onto the counter, then led Ji Yao upstairs.

They reached the fifth floor and found room A3, opened the seal on the room with the room tag, then entered.

At a brief glance, though the room was not very spacious, it had all the necessary furnishings. The large red rug on the floor and the bedspread made from golden threads gave off a feeling of luxury.

For ten thousand Low-Rank Source Crystals, it was a good deal.

Yang Kai sat down after looking around a little, and Ji Yao retrieved a tea set from her Space Ring with the ease of long practice. She started brewing the tea, and in a short time the rich fragrance permeated the room.

After extinguishing the flame, adding in the hot water, and then pouring the tea, Ji Yao respectfully handed a cup to Yang Kai, “Honoured Master, please enjoy.”

“Mm,” Yang Kai casually took it, and sipped the tea slowly.

Only after a long pause did he suddenly realise what he was doing, and said, “You should sit too.”

“Disciple is fine standing,” Ji Yao’s gaze was fixed on Yang Kai. It was as though watching her Honoured Master drink the tea she had personally brewed was the most blissful thing ever, and her face was lit by a sweet smile.

“I’m asking you to sit, so sit.” Yang Kai’s attitude was firm.

“Yes!” Since Ji Yao could not change his mind, she obeyed and sat down.

Yang Kai was silent for a while, then suddenly spoke, “Yao’er.”

“I am here, Honoured Master,” Ji Yao quickly answered.

Yang Kai raised his hand to his mouth and cleared his throat, then said rather awkwardly, “If one day… You discover that I have concealed some things from you, or even deceived you, I hope you understand my intentions.”

“Conceal and deceive?” Ji Yao frowned, and she asked curiously, “What would Honoured Master have to conceal from me or deceive me about?”

Yang Kai forced a smile, “Well, I’m just saying. But if that day really comes, please don’t be upset about it. You may rest assured that I wouldn’t let you down on anything, nor would I hurt you.”

They were only a few days away from Ice Heart Valley, and Yang Kai did not know what kind of reaction Ji Yao would have when she arrived back there and saw Bing Yun. The best-case scenario was that she would suddenly come to her senses and realise that Yang Kai was just an imposter.

If that did happen, then Ji Yao would certainly recall that they had shared a room during this time.

This was not a big issue, as he had done so to help keep her stable, and he believed that she would understand. The problem was that in Luan Feng’s palace, he had caught a glimpse of her naked form.

Though it was just a glimpse, it was still a matter related to Ji Yao’s innocence and honour.

Yang Kai was not sure if she would try to kill him…

That said, even if Ji Yao could fully recover someday, he felt that she would forgive him.

“I trust you, Honoured Master,” Ji Yao said solemnly. “My Senior Sisters and I are all orphans, and you raised and educated us out of the kindness of your heart. It is all thanks to Honoured Master that I am who I am today. So, even if you wanted to kill me, that would be fine.”

Yang Kai sweated profusely, thinking of how relieved he would be if she didn’t try to kill him in the future.

Still, her little speech made him realise just how important Bing Yun was to her Disciples.

“Honoured Master…” Ji Yao called softly, “Honoured Master, is something troubling you? Do you need my help?”

“There’s nothing. No need for you to worry!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Ji Yao rose and walked slowly towards him, emanating a fragrant scent as she said, “Since I am unable to help, then please allow me to at least massage your shoulders, Honoured Master.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai was stunned, and before he could react, Ji Yao was already standing behind him and starting her light massage.

Yang Kai’s whole body froze, and he felt he was definitely in trouble.

Ever since he had arrived from the Star Field, he had kept his mind clear and without desire, entirely focusing on growing stronger, but he was still a man and naturally had desires.

Last time, he nearly had a nosebleed when he accidentally saw Ji Yao’s body. Now, they were alone together in one room, and Ji Yao was even voluntarily giving him a shoulder rub.

Not only that, but the warmth of her body leaning against his back and the light fragrance that wafted from her body were making Yang Kai extremely flustered and his throat dry.

Ji Yao laughed lightly behind him, “Honoured Master, your shoulders are so stiff. Have you been working too hard lately?”

[How can the body of a man like me compare to Bing Yun’s soft and delicate body? Of course they would feel different!] Thought Yang Kai. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Though he wanted to stop Ji Yao, he was worried that she would overthink things, which would also affect her current situation. In order to maintain the charade, he answered, “Yes, a little.”

Ji Yao laughed, “Just relax, Honoured Master. I have not served you for many years, I wonder if my skills have deteriorated.”

From those words, Yang Kai realised that Ji Yao used to do this often for Bing Yun when they were in Ice Heart Valley, which was why she was so skilled.

Since Yang Kai could not stop her nor turn her down, all he could do was to calm himself and enjoy the process, his body gradually relaxing. As Ji Yao’s jade-white hands applied varying amounts of force, it was such a heavenly comfort that he groaned.

Ji Yao blushed to her ears upon hearing that, wondering why her Honoured Master would make such strange noises, but feeling too embarrassed to ask.

After the shoulders were done, she moved on to the arms, then the head, and even the thighs.

After that service, Yang Kai was greatly relaxed. He had many words of praise for Ji Yao’s skills, which made her smile in delight.

The only problem was that the sight of Ji Yao kneeling before him, massaging his thighs, was too thrilling and alluring.

After the painful enjoyment was over, Yang Kai’s face fell again. He realised that when Ji Yao fully regained her senses, she would find yet another offence he had committed against her. The thought filled him with sadness and regret.

The night was tranquil as Yang Kai and Ji Yao meditated and slept separately, on the bed and the floor.

Ji Yao did not show any chaotic signs, which made Yang Kai feel much more at ease.

Only at noon the next day did they leave the room, and head down to the counter on the first floor to check out.

Seeing Yang Kai look fresh as a spring breeze, the innkeeper was incredibly envious. Still, he wore a knowing smile as he asked, “Dear guests, did you rest well last night?”

“Very well!” Yang Kai nodded. How could he not know what perverted thoughts were going through that fellow’s head? But he did not say any more, as he could not be bothered.

“Since you had such a good rest, do visit us again the next time you come to Serenity City,” the shopkeeper nodded and bowed to Yang Kai and Ji Yao as they left.
