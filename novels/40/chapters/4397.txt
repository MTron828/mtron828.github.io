“I can’t believe we’ll lose our lives here.” Chef and Accountant were facing away from one another. Their figures were soaked in blood as they glowered at the dozens of Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who had surrounded them.

There was a huge gap in the numbers of people between both sides, so there was no way those from First Inn had any hope of winning the battle. In fact, they were practically doomed as they were about to get killed.

If it weren’t for their near feral retaliation just now, these people would’ve pounced on them instead of appearing wary.

“Since we’re going to die anyway, we should probably just get it over with right away.” Accountant raised his abacus with one hand. His blood streamed down his arms and dropped on the lake before dying it red.

Upon hearing that, Chef turned to look in the Proprietress’ direction where he saw four figures flying around. Presently, the three Mountain Lords of Profound Yang Mountain were locked in a fierce battle with the Proprietress as they cast their Divine Abilities at her. After letting out a breath, Chef lifted his knife and said, “You’re right. The sooner we head for the Yellow Springs the better.”

The reason the Proprietress wasn’t willing to leave was that the two of them were still alive, so she didn’t have the heart to abandon them. If both of them lost their lives, perhaps the Proprietress would flee and be able to obtain revenge for them at a later time.

Given her strength, she would be able to flee even though she couldn’t defeat the three Mountain Lords.

They exchanged glances and laughed heartily. Since they could go to Hell together, they reckoned that they wouldn’t feel lonely at the very least.

As their gazes parted ways, they sported resolute expressions. They pushed their Small Universes madly as their World Forces surged and spread out. Even if they had to lose their lives in this battle, they would bring some enemies down with them.

Kill one to break even, kill two to profit.

Just when they were ready to make a move, a pair of hands were suddenly placed on Chef’s shoulders as a voice was heard saying, “Take it easy. I don’t want to die yet.”

A flabbergasted Chef turned his head and almost hacked the person with his knife. When he realised who spoke though he snapped bitterly, “Little bastard, you’re finally awake!”

The person who spoke just now was Yang Kai, who had been lying on Chef’s back this whole time.

Yang Kai patted his shoulders and leaped away from him before gently saying, “I’ve been awake the whole time.”

However, he was at the most critical moment of refining the World Fruit just now, so he couldn’t stop half-way, or else all his effort would be wasted. That was the reason he was unable to respond to them.

“Save the Proprietress right now!” Chef demanded anxiously, “She’s in danger. Bring her away. Accountant and I will hold up the enemy for you.”

“She’s in danger, but you two aren’t in a better state.” Yang Kai looked around as his gaze turned cold. Then, he stepped forward with a grim expression, “I’m in a terrible mood, so I don’t mind killing some people to vent out my anger. Scram if you don’t want to die!”

Chef and Accountant gazed at him in shock, thinking that he hadn’t fully come to his senses after a long stupor.

All the Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters around them sported strange expressions. Seeing Yang Kai stepping closer though, one of them pointed at him with his sword and yelled, “Kill!”

As soon as he spoke that word, he thrust out his sword towards Yang Kai.

His World Force surged as the sword shadows multiplied. However, when he realised that Yang Kai had disappeared from his line of sight, he felt his chest tightening as a sense of uneasiness rose within him.

Before he was able to react, he saw a point of a spear rapidly enlarging before his eyes. The spear seemed to have turned into a Great Dragon as it widened its maw and pounced on him. His vision was shrouded in darkness, leaving him flustered and horrified.

He hurriedly surged his World Force to parry the attack, but an even more violent force penetrated his defence like it was paper.

An explosive sound was heard as the spear penetrated the person’s head and exploded it. His blood and flesh scattered about as his headless corpse convulsed, even as he held out his sword in front of him.

Without stopping, Yang Kai disappeared from everyone’s sight again as a great Dragon Roar shook the world. The Azure Dragon Spear flashed in and out of everyone’s vision for a moment, and when Yang Kai reappeared, he had broken through the encirclement of these Open Heaven Realm Masters. Although he appeared slow, he was actually heading towards the battlefield of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters at incredible speed.

Even though he was gone, his voice still lingered in the air, “If the two of them lose even one more strand of hair, all of you will have to die!”

Chef and Accountant were dumbfounded as they couldn’t figure out how Yang Kai managed to break through the encirclement but soon just thought that Space Principles were indeed useful as no one was able to capture Yang Kai.

The next instant though, the two of them widened their eyes and stared at the enemies around them in disbelief.

A blood light expanded as a person exploded, then the same thing happened to another person.

*Hong hong hong…*

In less than a breath, eight Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters exploded into blood mist, leaving no trace behind.

While the two of them were flabbergasted, the enemies around them were horrified.

Just now, they could see that Yang Kai exploded one of their companion’s head with his spear; however, that person was only in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so it wasn’t surprising that he would lose his life due to his negligence in this life-and-death battle.

Nevertheless, most of the eight Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who had just died were in the Fifth-Order. Only Yang Kai had made a move, so it was apparent who the murderer was.

He had to possess a horrifying strength to be able to kill eight Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters with ease in just a flash.

Presently, no one dared to make a move on Chef and Accountant, who were still surrounded. Even though they could easily kill these two, they were wary of the threat Yang Kai had left behind.

Nine of their companions had lost their lives already, so it was obvious to them that only the four Mountain Lords were able to deal with him.

“What’s going on with that brat?” A dazed Chef watched as Yang Kai rapidly dashed away.

“Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm!” Accountant was dumbstruck. As Yang Kai charged forward, his aura exploded. It was apparent to them that his aura was that of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master as he didn’t even attempt to conceal it.

“When did that happen?” Chef fell into a dazed state.

If he wasn’t mistaken, Yang Kai was only in the Fifth-Order when he found them one month ago. It had only been one month since he started recuperating, so how did he manage to ascend to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm?

The speed at which he achieved this breakthrough was simply impossible.

Besides them, Hua Yong and Shu Mu Dan, who had been observing the battle from their garden on Twin Spirit Island, were terrified.

Hua Yong widened his eyes and asked, “Just who is he?”

When he saw Yang Kai lying unconscious on Chef’s back, he thought that the latter was severely wounded, so he didn’t mind him; however, the slaughter just now proved that Yang Kai was in peak condition rather than being injured.

Shu Mu Dan asked in a shaking voice, “Husband… could you do that in such a short period of time?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

She was talking about whether her Husband was able to kill eight Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in an instant.

After giving it a thought, Hua Yong shook his head, “Impossible. Even I wouldn’t be able to kill so many Fifth-Order cultivators in such a short moment.”

Shu Mu Dan let out a breath, “Now, it seems that he’s the strongest person on Lan You Ruo’s side. Perhaps he’s even stronger than her.”

A puzzled Hua Yong asked, “Since he had such power, why didn’t he participate in the battle earlier? It wasn’t until the most critical moment that he made a move.”

“He must have his own reasons.” Shu Mu Dan fell into her thoughts.

Hua Yong commented, “Profound Yang Mountain will have to retreat without achieving their goal. Lan You Ruo is very powerful to begin with, and now she has this person’s help, so the three Mountain Lords won’t be able to defeat them.”

Shu Mu Dan said, “If that person is really stronger than Lan You Ruo, we’ll need to come up with a plan, Husband.”

Hua Yong’s face twitched as he understood what she meant.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai reached the battlefield of the four Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters as he pushed out his spear towards Yun Fei Bai as he bellowed, “Old dog, die!”

Yun Fei Bai turned his head, and when he saw that it was Yang Kai, his eyes turned bloodshot, “Brat! It’s you!!”

The fact that Yang Kai had pierced his chest with a spear some time ago was a complete humiliation for him. It took Yun Fei Bai a whole month to recover from that wound. Now that he met his enemy again, it was expected that he was incensed. He immediately ignored Lan You Ruo and hacked his axe at Yang Kai.

The reason he was injured at that time was that he had underestimated his opponent, for he had never expected that someone would have the guts to harm him in Profound Yang Mountain. Otherwise, in his opinion, a newly promoted Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would never be able to hurt him.

Now, he finally had the chance to get his revenge.

As he brought down his axe though, his expression changed as he called out in shock, “You’re a Sixth-Order?”

Yang Kai’s aura was as conspicuous as ever, so anyone who wasn’t a fool would be able to detect it, and it was absolutely clear that he was in the Sixth-Order.

[No way! He was still a newly ascended Fifth-Order when I met him one month ago. Why is he a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now?]

Despite the doubt in his mind, Yun Fei Bai remained merciless with his actions as he madly infused his World Force into his axe.

As soon as Yang Kai’s spear came into contact with the axe, Yun Fei Bai’s expression changed drastically as he felt an immense force sweeping over him. The impact cracked his hands so badly that he almost lost grip of his axe. His expression turned horrified as he realized that Yang Kai was indeed a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, or else the latter couldn’t have showcased this kind of strength.

Looking down, he saw that his purlicue had ripped apart and blood was now streaming out of the wound. He was unable to stop his hand from trembling violently.

At that moment, he was dumbstruck. When he saw Yang Kai one month ago, the latter was just a new Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. However, when they met again this time, he realised that the latter also looked like a new Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Even though Yang Kai was really a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he should be weaker than Yun Fei Bai, who had millennia of accumulation in his current Order. It should be impossible that a newly promoted Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Yang Kai had a stronger heritage.

Nevertheless, the truth was that Yun Fei Bai had suffered a setback. Both Yang Kai’s strength and World Force were simply overwhelming.

While Yun Fei Bai was lost in a dazed state, Yang Kai came at him with his spear again and bellowed, “On this day, the Golden Crow Casts the Sun, below the Heavens, above the Earth, only I am supreme!”

A series of caws were heard as a Great Sun suddenly rose from Yang Kai’s back. Like a real Sun, it was scorching hot as it cast its glow on the world below. Furthermore, there seemed to be a three-legged exotic bird flying around this Great Sun.
