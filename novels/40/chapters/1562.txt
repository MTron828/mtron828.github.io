Chapter 1562, Arrangements

Although Little Senior Sister had reached the Origin Returning Realm, far higher than the Hu Sisters’ current cultivation, she had obtained the greatest of opportunities, refining a Star Source to do so.

The Hu Sisters certainly didn’t have such a Heaven defying opportunity, but in this barren land with thin World Energy aura, they had managed to reach their current level through their own efforts. This demonstrated that their aptitude was indeed extraordinary.

Seeing Yang Kai’s face full of confusion, the woman on the left smiled and said, “I’m Jiao’er!”

“I’m Mei’er!” The woman on the right added.

Their voices were soft and pleasant to the ear. Their two temperaments from before seemed to have completely changed, becoming a fusion of the elder sister’s boldness and the shyness of the younger sister, making them even more attractive.

“If you didn’t tell me, I really wouldn’t have been able to tell,” Yang Kai scratched his head.

This somewhat naive gesture made the two women laugh.

“Very few people can tell us apart,” Hu Jiao’er curled her lips into a smiling, “Even father often confuses us.”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded lightly. If even Hu Man couldn’t distinguish which of his two daughters was which, it wasn’t surprising for Yang Kai to be unable to tell them apart either. “By the way, you two heard about the discussion just now. Do you plan to stay, or...”

“We’re coming with you!” Before Yang Kai could finish speaking, the two women replied in unison, as if they shared the same heart and had no need to discuss anything beforehand.

“If that’s the case, then you should quickly prepare, I don’t plan to wait too long, I’ll be leaving in half a month.”

“Alright, we’ll meet with father first and then send a message to our two Masters,” Hu Jiao’er said without delay before immediately leaving with Hu Mei’er.

However, the two seemed a bit reluctant.

After not seeing him for so many years, they really wanted to talk to Yang Kai more, but when they thought about how they would be able to meet each other frequently in the future, they didn’t feel as rushed.

When passing by Xia Ning Chang, the two girls were gently nodded to her, their beautiful eyes flashing with envy.

Xia Ning Chang could accompany Yang Kai freely, but they couldn’t...

“Little Senior Sister, during this next half a month, I have something I need to teach you.” After all the people in the hall left, Yang Kai quickly walked towards Xia Ning Chang and dragged her towards her cultivation room.

What Yang Kai wanted to teach to Xia Ning Chang was naturally how to condense her Shi.

He had condensed his Shi with the help of the Emperor Pressure from the Emperor Garden, a rather unique method that, although it produced amazing effects, was clearly not suitable for Xia Ning Chang.

However, the basic insights and comprehensions about how to condense Shi were more or less universal. What’s more, he had learned many valuable experiences from Qian Tong and the other masters he was close with.

Now, he was going to teach everything to Xia Ning Chang.

Additionally, Yang Kai taught Little Senior Sister what he had learned from the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture.

Little Senior Sister had a Special Constitution, the Sacred Spirit Medicine Body, so she possessed innate ability and talent when it came to refining pills, not needing anyone to teach her in order for her to advance. However, the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture was filled with profound knowledge that would be of great help to Xia Ning Chang when it came to raising her Alchemy skills.

Half a month was neither long nor short.

Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang did not leave their cultivation room during that time.

Naturally, they took some time out to spend together. Yang Kai would enjoy the company of this gentle beauty and, on occasion, suddenly make love to her.

Since setting foot into the Star Field, Yang Kai had essentially had no intimate contact with any woman, so now that he had been reunited with Little Senior Sister, who he didn’t need to restrain himself around, he was like a freed beast that had just found its favourite prey and pounced without reserve.

Xia Ning Chang’s complexion also grew better and better, her already jade-like skin gaining a shimmering lustre to it.

She was like a beautiful flower that had just been moistened by the morning dew...

After half a month, Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang exited their retreat together.

Xia Ning Chang was naturally unable to condense her Shi after only half a month, but receiving Yang Kai’s dedicated teaching, she now at least understood what Shi was and had gained some slight experience with this magical power; now, all she needed was enough time to cultivate it properly.

The True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture was also effortlessly learned by her, the various techniques and Spirit Arrays recorded in it often causing her eyes to shimmer and glow.

Nine Heavens Holy Land was now completely crowded with about ten thousand members of the Human, Demon, and Monster Races now gathered here.

Among these ten thousand, about two thousand were from the Holy Land, four thousand were from the Great Han Dynasty, one thousand were from the Monster Race, and two thousand were from the Demon Race.

Even with so many gathered, however, the scene was extremely quiet, with no one even whispering. Everyone was simply waiting silently for Yang Kai’s arrival.

Everyone was eager to know what method Yang Kai would be using to bring so many people into the Star Field at once.

In a brilliant flash of light, Yang Kai appeared, and ten thousand pairs of eyes fixed on him.

Looking out across the crowd, Yang Kai gently nodded, “Now that everyone is here, let’s begin!”

“Yang Kai, what do we need to do? Just give the order!” Thunder Dragon called out.

“Exactly. We will cooperate fully,” Zhang Yuan nodded in agreement.

“You don’t need to do anything, just relax and don’t resist!” Yang Kai smiled slightly before taking out a seemingly inconspicuous bead and suspending it in front of him, attracting everyone’s attention. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They didn’t know what mysteries this bead held, or why Yang Kai had brought it out at this time.

The answer was quickly revealed, however. Yang Kai stretched out his hand and with a flick of his wrist, the bead flew out like an arrow from the string and arrived atop the place where the thousands of people were gathered.

With a soft pop, a magical power emerged from the bead and as it swept outwards, everyone felt as if they were being held by a strange force.

Out of trust in Yang Kai, no one circulated their strength or tried to resist this force.

A burst of light blinded them in the next moment, and after their sight was restored, everyone suddenly realized that they had come to a completely strange place.

This was not Nine Heavens Holy Land, but the scenery was still extremely beautiful.

Moreover, the World Energy here seemed to be extremely rich, more than a hundred times higher than the average on Tong Xuan Realm. This discovery shocked everyone greatly!

“Huh, what’s this?” A Demon Race man suddenly discovered something in this new world and shouted as he pointed towards a certain place.

Following his gaze, everyone immediately spotted a roughly one-hundred-metre long pitch-black ship quietly suspended in the air.

“A Starship!” Demon Commander Zhang Yuan called out in shock.

Although he had received a report from Demon General Meng Ge that Yang Kai had a powerful Starship in his possession, he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes yet, so he wasn’t sure whether this was true or false. Now that this Starship had appeared in front of him, he immediately understood that this news was real.

There was a Starship buried beneath the Demon Capital, but that Starship was in tatters... and, in terms of grade, it seemed like it wasn’t even worthy of carrying shoes for the ship in front of him.

Zhang Yuan had keen eyesight and could naturally see how extraordinary this Starship was at a glance.

What made him even more surprised, however, were the people standing around the Starship. When these people saw a massive crowd of people suddenly appear, they all directed curious looks towards them.

Out of habit, Zhang Yuan released his Divine Sense to sweep these unknown cultivators, but expression changed dramatically in the next instant!

He discovered that the cultivation of each of these people was much higher than his own, and although they didn’t give him the same feeling of oppression as Yang Kai, Zhang Yuan was certain each of these cultivators was a legendary Saint King!

Had they already entered the Star Field?

Were these people cultivators from the Star Field?

All sorts of suspicions flashed across Zhang Yuan’s mind, as well as many of the others gathered here.

“Don’t be nervous!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came from a certain place and his figure quickly appeared in front of the Saint King Realm cultivators as he explained, “These are disciples from my Sect.”

“Disciples greet Sect Master!” Immediately, this group of cultivators, who gave everyone from Tong Xuan Realm an unattainable feeling, saluted Yang Kai.

“En,” Yang Kai gently nodded before turning to the one who seemed to be in charge and saying, “Liu Ping, these are my relatives and friends from my homeland, I will be taking them back to Shadowed Star with us so they will need to remain here for the time being. Take good care of them. “

“Yes!” The disciple named Liu Ping quickly nodded.

Yang Kai next came over to Chu Ling Xiao and Ling Tai Xu and bowed, “Martial Ancestor, Grand Master, this is a Small Sealed World. Although it’s not very big, it is more than enough to accommodate a trivial ten thousand people. It is safe here, and I will let you out when we reach our destination. Disciple lacks talent but in a place called Shadowed Star, he has founded High Heaven Sect. Until we reach there, I will need the two of you to take charge here. En, the journey will probably take quite some time, at least several years. If you have any questions, you can ask these disciples of mine, they will give you their full cooperation.”

“Sure. Go on, you don’t need to worry about us here,” Chu Ling Xiao smiled kindly.

Chu Ling Xiao had no idea how precious and Heaven-defying the Sealed World Bead and Origin King Grade Starship were; if he did, he wouldn’t be acting so calmly.

“Disciple will head out first, when I am free, I will come to visit you,” Yang Kai said before leaving the Small Sealed World.

After Yang Kai left, the disciple named Liu Ping ran over immediately and greeted Ling Tai Xu and Chu Ling Xiao.

He had heard clearly just now how Yang Kai addressed these two old men as Martial Ancestor and Grand Master, so although his cultivation was much higher than these two, he didn’t dare show any negligence, bowing respectfully as any Junior would.

Seeing this boy behaving like this, Chu Ling Xiao and Ling Tai Xu did not have any scruples and immediately began inquiring about Shadowed Star and High Heaven Sect to Liu Ping. After learning that High Heaven Sect was now the greatest Sect on Shadowed Star, basically having dominated the entire star, the two of them couldn’t help feeling a sense of pride.

In just a trivial thirty years, Yang Kai had used his own power to subdue an entire Cultivation Star. This was not something an ordinary man could accomplish and they were left in awe of Yang Kai’s abilities.

Quickly, they began to ask more questions.

Having settled things in the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai put it away before sweeping his Divine Sense across the now empty Nine Heavens Holy Land. Putting away the slight nostalgia in his eyes, he turned to Xia Ning Chang, who was standing next to him patiently, he said, “Little Senior Sister, can you help me find someone?”
