“Oh no, I’m so scared!” Yang Kai made an extremely exaggerated expression as he put his hands on his chest, seemingly unable to calm his heart. The next moment, however, his face turned bitterly cold and he declared sharply, “But that has nothing to do with you. If one of your Purple Star people dares to come after me, I’ll kill one, if two come, I’ll kill both of them! I wonder just how many Origin Kings your Purple Star will let me kill.”

As he said, a cruel smile appeared on his lips.

Zi Dong could not help trembling all over as he felt Yang Kai’s cold glare. Seeing the other part not boasting idly or cracking a joke, Zi Dong immediately shouted eagerly, “Father! Save me!”

He did not have the guts to fight Yang Kai and directly asked Zi Long for rescue.

Yang Kai could not help thinking about Xue Yue, Gu Jian Xin, and the other young rising stars of the Star Field and felt that all of them were much more courageous, with firmer Martial Hearts that wouldn’t be intimidated so easily. For example, Yang Kai had watched Gu Jian Xin get ambushed by Li Ming Hai, yet still fight back valiantly with his life on the line.

He also believed that if Xue Yue encountered such a situation, she would not call for help but would instead focus all her attention on trying to fight the enemy.

So what if they were facing an Origin King? Which one of these geniuses did not have the power to fight opponents above their own realm? If they were targeted by an enemy just one Minor Realm above them yet did not have the courage to even resist, what point would there be in even continuing to cultivate in the future?

A cultivator who could only fight others who were weaker or in the same realm as themselves would never be able to reach the peak of the Martial Dao.

Zi Dong had completely lost his qualifications to become a future master of Star Field! After meeting Yang Kai, he had been humiliated and beaten down repeatedly, tarnishing his Martial Heart greatly.

As such, he did not dare to fight with Yang Kai. But even if he managed to survive this catastrophe, whether he could break through to the Origin King Realm in the future was questionable at best.

“Little Brat, if you dare to touch a hair on my son’s head, this old master will slaughter you and all nine generations of your ancestors!” Not far away, Zi Long shouted in anger, but his voice was soon drowned out by the sound of explosions.

It was not that he didn’t want to save his son, but he was currently enveloped by Gui Zu’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner, with Yin Souls constantly attacking him. He had no way to easily escape so even if he wanted to rescue Zi Dong, he was helpless to do so.

“Really?” Yang Kai tilted his head and glanced over towards the spot where the threat had come from before sneering slightly and with a wave of his hand sent out a burst of energy.

The next moment, Zi Dong felt a breeze blow past the top of his head, causing him to shudder in place.

[Had I just died? Am I dead now?] Zi Dong’s thoughts churned wildly but quickly, he found that he was unharmed and there was only a strange lightness coming from the top of his head.

Reaching his hands up and feeling around, Zi Dong shouted madly, “Ah, my hair!”

His long flowing hair had been cut directly by Yang Kai and the top of his head was now bald, making his appearance extremely funny.

Zi Dong had a self-proclaimed rugged and unrestrained style, and although his looks weren’t as extraordinary as Xue Yue’s, he was still a fairly handsome man. He was particularly proud of his long purple hair, which was inherited from his ancestors.

But now, his long flowing purple hair had been cut off!

While Zi Dong felt somewhat distressed, he was more terrified than anything.

Yang Kai’s casual hand wave had left him no time to react and chopped off his hair, which meant it would be just as easy for him to chop off his head! Considering all this, Zi Dong suddenly began sweating profusely as his face turned as pale as paper.

“I’ve cut some hair off his head, what are you going to do about it?” Yang Kai teased.

Inside the Ten Thousand Soul Banner’s barrier, Zi Long had gone silent, probably out of shame and anger, but Gui Zu laughed loudly, “This old master has always thought these two’s purple hair was quite ugly, it’s good that you cut it off!”

“Boy!” Zi Long’s voice sounded again, “If you let my son go, this old master will withdraw and swear to never trouble you again. As the saying goes, one does not truly know another until they have fought. Perhaps this is a chance to become friends; after all, the Star Field is vast and you may need my Purple Star’s assistance in the future. This old master, as the Sect Master of Purple Star, can agree to any condition that is not excessive. As long as my Purple Star can achieve it, this old master will definitely satisfy you.”

“En, your sentiments are quite reasonable,” Yang Kai chuckled, “It would be an honour to have Purple Star do something for me.”

“Yes, yes, exactly!” Zi Dong nodded repeatedly, “As long as you don’t kill me, everything can be discussed. When I become the Sect Master of Purple Star in the future, you and I can even become brothers.”

As he spoke, hatred flashed across his eyes, and although it was fleeting, how could it escape Yang Kai’s observation?

“So, do you agree?” Zi Long asked in a deep voice.

“Of course, why not? Senior Zi Long is a man who can cover the sky with one hand, and although my Sect’s Supreme Elder can compete with you, killing you is another matter altogether. Instead of everyone fighting and both sides suffering losses, it would be best to settle this peacefully.”

“Seems you’re not an unreasonable young man,” Zi Long nodded with satisfaction. In fact, it was indeed as Yang Kai said. Although Gui Zu could temporarily trap Zi Long in the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, it was unrealistic to expect him to kill Zi Long. Both of them were Second-Order Origin Kings and had nearly equal strength, so even if Gui Zu could kill Zi Long, he would probably wind up severely wounded or even lose his life in the attempt.

Gui Zu, however, frowned. Although he treated Yang Kai well, it did not mean that he was a kind individual. On the contrary, Gui Zu was a cruel man and knew that things had gone too far for there to ever be peace between Yang Kai and Zi Long. Even if the two of them reached some kind of verbal agreement, Yang Kai would certainly never be able to reap any benefits from Zi Long in the future.

Verbal agreements were no guarantee, and if Yang Kai were to really go to Purple Star to discuss something in the future, the most likely scenario would be him being encircled by all of Purple Star’s masters.

After all, this time, Zi Long and his son had lost a lot of face. On top of that, this matter concerned the Immortal Tree, a treasure Zi Long would never give up on.

However, in this situation, he did not have any good solutions either, so he could only trust Yang Kai to settle things.

“Of course, I’m very reasonable, haha...” Yang Kai said as he scratched his nose and wore an embarrassed look, “Good, speaking of which, I really do have something I need to ask Senior Zi Long for help with. I hope Senior won’t refuse.”

Zi Long’s face could not help but sink as he wondered if this little brat really understood that what he held was a chicken feather, not an arrow? The words that were spoken just now were clearly perfunctory, an effort to preserve face. Anyone with any brains would not take them seriously yet this boy was now so unscrupulous that he was actually trying to make a request right now.

Although he was disgruntled, Zi Long still patiently said, “Name it. As long as I, Zi Long, can do it, it will definitely be done.”

After he took his son away from here, he would immediately issue a kill order and let this boy understand what it meant for there to be no path to Heaven or road to Hell to traverse!

“It’s a very simple request that I’m certain Senior Zi Long can fulfil,” Yang Kai chuckled, wearing a smile as if he was harmless to humans and animals alike, “Junior boldly requests Senior... to die!”

“Si...” Inside the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, Gui Zu drew a cold breath as even the howls coming from the Yin Souls became stagnated for a moment, showing just how unstable his heart was.

Zi Long also fell silent immediately, but his anger was palpable and rising rapidly, as if it wanted to burn down the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

Zi Dong, who was not far away, had his jaw drop as he stared at Yang Kai dumbly, unable to imagine that Yang Kai would make such an audacious request.

Did this little brat even know what he was talking about? It could not be that his brain had been damaged, right?

Before he could finish his thoughts though, Zi Dong saw a flash of light as Yang Kai suddenly appeared in front of him and stretched out his hand to grab him.

Zi Dong screamed out in horror as he pushed his Purple Qi Eternal River Secret Art to its limits, trying to escape.

But his efforts were futile. Before he even realized what happened, he felt his strength being suppressed and was lifted by Yang Kai by the neck.

“Ha...” Yang Kai sighed, “It seems that Senior Zi Long is a man who doesn’t honour his words. Since that is the case, we’ll just have to follow through with the original plan.”

“Junior, if you dare to hurt my son, this old master will rip your corpse into ten thousand pieces!” Zi Long anxiously roared. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Yang Kai reached up his free hand and cleaned his ear indifferently, curling his lips as he said, “You seem to have said something similar earlier, but I’m still standing here aren’t I? Old Dog, do you only know how to bark loudly? Are you incapable of actually doing anything? En... now I’m quite curious, if I really kill him, what will you do...”

Zi Long did not dare to speak, for fear that he would aggravate Yang Kai and cause him to kill his son.

Zi Long understood that this boy was a total madman, and there was no reasoning with a madman.

*Kacha...*

The sound of bones breaking rang out from Zi Dong’s neck as he beat at Yang Kai’s arm vigorously, as if wanting to slap him away, but without his Saint Qi, his actions only appeared comical and powerless.

Yang Kai glanced at him faintly and declared coldly, “I had no grievances with you father and son, we could have just ignored and not interfered with one another, but you both insisted on trying to oppress me at every turn. Everything that has happened here is a result of your own actions. If you have a next life, learn not to have eyes atop your head, that way you won’t trip and fall so easily.”

As soon as these words fell, Yang Kai put more force into his grip.

Zi Dong’s head tilted to the side and his struggling instantly stopped, his vitality cut off.

Purple Star’s Young Master had died!

Perceiving the movement here, Gui Zu almost bit his tongue.

Even he did not think that Yang Kai would really kill Zi Dong. He had been thinking about whether Yang Kai would either use Zi Dong as a bargaining chip to escape or was going to extract some benefits from Zi Long first.

He never thought Yang Kai would decisively kill.

[This is bad!] Gui Zu heart clenched.

Seeing his son killed, Zi Long would likely completely lose control.

Before this thought was finished, Gui Zu’s eyes flashed a look of horror as his originally pitch black Ten Thousand Soul Banner was penetrated by thousands of rays of purple light. These rays of light contained extremely terrifying killing intent that caused his Ten Thousand Soul Banner to tremble and shake.

*Hong...*

A hole was blasted open in the Ten Thousand Soul Banner’s barrier from which Zi Long’s figure burst out and soared towards Yang Kai. His expression was hideous as he roared, “Boy, I’ll make you pay for that in blood!”
