The same was true for the other seven Great Kings. Realizing that there was no hope of breaking the Blood Gate seal and the Stone Spirit Clan was now planning on escaping, the Great Kings no longer held themselves back and instantly brought out their full power. The Stone Spirit Clan immediately fell into a disadvantage and suffered a huge loss, retreating again and again.

However, the Stone Spirit Clan was not only inherently powerful, but they also had extremely strong and sturdy physiques. Unless their bodies were crushed into pieces, not only would they not die, but they would not suffer any injuries either.

After the burly Monster King knocked his opponent back, he shouted, “All Monster Kings, hear my order, the Stone Spirit Clan has trespassed the Blood Gate Restricted Area with sinister intentions. Under the Divine Venerables’ authority, they must all be taken down!”

As he pointed at the Stone Spirit Clan, the thirty-one Monster Kings who were enjoying the show nearby immediately lunged over like a pack of wolves, surrounding the Stone Spirit Clan in an instant.

Yang Kai’s heart sank as he realized that they were in big trouble. Eight Great Kings and thirty-one Monster Kings, that was thirty-nine peak Twelfth-Order Masters surrounding them. Even a Great Emperor might surrender before this powerful lineup.

*Weng weng weng…*

One after another, the Monster Kings unleashed fearsome auras that made the entire world feel like it was shaking. Bits and pieces of rocks on the ground slowly floated up from the ground, as if an invisible force was lifting them up.

“Why play with fire if you don’t have any protection!” Hu Li heaved a sigh and shook his head, his gaze sweeping through the ten stone giants before finally resting on Yang Kai, “Leave the Human to this King, you deal with the others.”

He only had a Mid Twelfth-Order cultivation, so he had no confidence to face a Stone Spirit head-on. On the other hand, he felt no pressure facing a mere First-Order Emperor Realm Human.

The burly Great King obviously knew what Hu Li’s plan was and just gave Yang Kai a cold glance before warning Hu Li, “Hu Li, you have to be careful with this Human, he is proficient in the Dao of Space.”

Hu Li was surprised as he murmured, “Dao of Space? Interesting!”

That being said, he still didn’t attach any importance to Yang Kai; after all, the gap between their cultivations was pretty wide. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The burly Great King’s face turned sullen as he coldly glared at Elder and proposed, “Elder, this King isn’t shedding all pretences of cordiality because of the respect I have for your old age. As long as you are willing to surrender without a fight, the Divine Venerables might leave a way out for you when they return, but if you remain stubborn, then this King will have no choice but to offend you.”

The Elder sighed and stated, “This Elder has taken Great King’s kindness to his heart, but my Stone Spirit Clan… will surrender to no one!”

“Not even to the Divine Venerables?” The stalwart Great King’s gaze turned colder.

The Elder shook his head in refusal.

The stalwart Great King lightly nodded before indifferently adding, “Since that’s the case…” He raised his hand high and swung it down hard, shouting a single word, “Attack!”

*Shua shua shua…*

Over thirty Monster King figures flickered as they charged straight at the Stone Spirit Clan wrapped in copious Monster Qi. In an instant, with the Elder in the lead, the Stone Spirit Clan let out war cries as they swung their enormous fists wrapped in unimaginably violent energy, greeting the oncoming the Monster Kings. Their punches seemed as if they could shatter this world.

How could the Monster Kings dare to take this strike head-on? All of them promptly cast their own unique techniques one after another, their figures fluttering as they dealt with the Stone Spirits using their numbers advantage and flexible movement skills.

*Hong hong hong…*

Deafening crashes rang one after another, accompanied by dazzling flashes of colourful lights. A shocking battle kicked off in an instant.

“Take Shi Jiu away! Preserve my Stone Spirit Clan’s bloodline!” Elder suddenly shouted as he swung the cane in his hand in a circle before smacking it down hard on the oncoming Monster King. Unfortunately, his blow was swiftly avoided.

Yang Kai knew that Elder was talking to him, but at this moment, how could he have any room to leave even if that was what he most wanted to do? If he was alone, he could indeed come and go freely, but if he wanted to take Xiao Xiao away, he would first need to put him into the Sealed World Bead.

However, Xiao Xiao seemed to have become completely engrossed in the heat of battle as he fought shoulder to shoulder with the other Stone Spirits. If he didn’t cooperate, Yang Kai couldn’t force him into the Sealed World Bead.

“Human, this King will be your opponent!” Suddenly, a figure flashed before his eyes. Yang Kai found that the Monster King named Hu Li had appeared before him, lightly sending a palm at him with a smile hanging on his lips.

“Scram!” Yang Kai too raised his palm and greeted him head-on.

“You are quite courageous!” Hu Li chuckled, feeling that this Human was really interesting. Much to his surprise, the Human actually dared to meet force with force despite the gap in their cultivation. Did this human boy simply lack real combat experience?

But very soon, the smile on Hu Li’s face turned stiff, because the moment their palms came in contact, he felt that the strength of his opponent’s palm was no weaker than his own. In fact, the force he felt seemed like it could crush his strike like it was smashing rotting wood. Not only that, but there were also mysterious spatial fluctuations around Yang Kai’s attack, which appeared to be tearing apart his palm.

Hu Li was shocked and quickly pulled back his arm, looking at Yang Kai in amazement. The contempt and indifference in his eyes had disappeared right away and was replaced with an extremely solemn look.

“Solidify!” As Yang Kai shouted, causing the local Space Principles to surge. Immediately after, the space around Hu Li became thick and viscous, making Hu Li feel like he had fallen into a swamp. Not only did it become hard for him to move his body freely, even circulating his strength became difficult.

Yang Kai waved his hand in a slashing motion, sending out an enormous jet-black Moon Blade that flew straight at Hu Li.

Hu Li’s face drastically changed as beads of cold sweat could be seen emerging on his forehead. He felt his limbs go cold and numb as goosebumps appeared all over his body. He desperately urged his own energy to escape like his life depended on it, but in the end, he could not summon sufficient strength due to the odd pressure he was under. Under the invisible shackles of the local Space Principles, he couldn’t avoid this blow at all.

In a hurry and left with no choice, he opened his mouth wide and spat out a white ball about the size of a quail egg. An extremely strange fragrance was wafting from this white ball.

Monster Core!

At the critical moment of life and death, Hu Li acted in an extremely decisive manner, spitting out his Monster Core that should not be easily revealed.

Suddenly, a thick defensive shield manifested in front of the spinning Monster Core.

*Hong…*

The enormous Moon Blade struck straight on the defensive shield and slowly began cutting through it, like it was trying to slice up an extremely resilient cloth, barely fraying the outer layer of protection!

At the same time, the Space Principle shackles around Hu Li also disappeared, and without any hesitation, he quickly collected his Monster Core and withdrew several dozen metres, putting distance between them. Finally, he had a breath of respite, a look of fear still lingering on his face.

He almost parted with his life just now for underestimating this Human. Had he not promptly and decisively used his Monster Core, he might have been split in half.

[Where did this Human…come from?]

“Hmm!?” On the other side, one of the eight Great Kings, who wasn’t participating in the fight, had a look of surprise flash past his eyes upon seeing this, amazed by Yang Kai’s astonishing strength.

But he also knew that the Monster King Hu Li’s combat power wasn’t that great and he mainly relied on schemes and trickery to secure his position, so he wasn’t too surprised and simply let out a cold snort as he took a step forward.

An afterimage remained where he originally stood, and in the blink of an eye, he arrived before Yang Kai.

Condescendingly looking down at Yang Kai, the Great King grabbed towards him. By the looks of his stance, it seemed as if he was trying to catch a chicken by its neck; he had a relaxed and free look on his face, indifferently mocking, “A trivial First-Order Emperor Realm Master actually dares to be so presumptuous in the Ancient Lands? It seems that your Elders never told you about the dangers of the Ancient Lands. This is not a place where you Humans can move and do as you wish.”

A solemn look appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he rapidly formed hand seals, exuding a mysterious aura into the surroundings. Immediately, time itself seemed to have stopped passing.

The Great King felt that his own thoughts had suddenly stopped and a bright light flashed before his eyes before he saw Yang Kai’s palms being pressed towards him.

“Time Flows on Infinitely, Like a Mighty Stream, Like an Unending Dream!”

A murmur rang in the Great King’s ears. To everyone else, it looked like the Great King had been struck by a petrification technique and simply allowed a strange seal to hit him without defending himself.

Only once everything was over did the Great King snap back to his senses.

In a flash, his face drastically changed as he felt a terrifying energy creeping up his arm. He roared in shock and hurriedly retreated, promptly pushing all the Monster Qi in his body towards his arm to resist this terrifying encroachment.

When he looked down at his arm, the Great King’s eyes involuntarily bulged.

It looked as if his arm had aged by thousands of years and his vitality was rapidly being eaten away. His originally robust muscles had become weak and withered while even his bones felt creaky.

“What kind of energy is this!?” The Great King was shocked and confused, hurriedly pushing his Monster Qi to try to expel the foreign energy from his body.

But how could Yang Kai give him such a chance? Now that he had already dropped all pretences of cordiality with the Ancient Lands Monster Race, Yang Kai would fight to kill. In any case, anyone Monster Race Master he took down would relieve some pressure on the Stone Spirit Clan.

Yang Kai promptly summoned the Myriads Sword and flooded it with his Emperor Qi, condensing a hundred-metre-long dazzling sword light as he swung it down on the Great King.

If this blow found its mark, the Great King would be severely injured, if not dead. At least, he would temporarily lose his combat power.

In truth, the strength of this Great King had completely surpassed Yang Kai’s expectations. The Time Flies Seal had never once failed to defeat his enemies since Yang Kai began cultivating it, but to his surprise, this Great King actually freed himself from the Dao of Time’s interference at the most critical moment, rendering the Time Flies Seal ineffective; the most it did was injure his arm.

He proved his strength as a peak Twelfth-Order Masters in name and in fact. Yang Kai even suspected that if this Great King had been on guard beforehand, the Time Flies Seal would not even have landed.

A dazzling sword aura and a powerful Sword Intent was radiating from the Myriads Sword as a thick, nearly tangible Murderous Intent was emanating from Yang Kai.

“Human, you dare!” That burly Great King shouted. Yang Kai didn’t notice when this Master moved, but he had unexpectedly appeared between Yang Kai and the Great King who was struck by the Time Flies Seal. Without dodging or avoiding the oncoming attack, the burly Great King fiercely punched towards Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword.

First, the Monster King, Hu Li, was forced to retreat by Yang Kai, and now a Great King had been injured in a single move by him. If this Great King really lost his life under Yang Kai’s sword, a human’s sword, the Ancient Lands Monster Race would lose all face.

Even if they could kill Yang Kai later, they would inevitably be punished by the Divine Venerables.

How could the burly Great King watch Yang Kai continue showing off his strength unimpeded?
