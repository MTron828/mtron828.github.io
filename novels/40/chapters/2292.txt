“You’re... trying to save me?” The Fire-titled man’s eyes, which had already started losing their lustre, bulged and a dumbfounded look surfaced on his face.

Yang Kai grabbed the Fire man by his collar and his body disappeared along with him.

A reeking scent of blood pervaded the prairie, and the vestiges of this great battle were everywhere. It was a terrifying sight!

“Young Master Yang...” Ye Jing Han flew over with her face as pale as paper and surveyed the surroundings, but she was unable to spot Yang Kai anywhere. She could only question Hua Qing Si anxiously, “Sister, where did Young Master Yang go?”

Hua Qing Si exchanged a glance with the Embodiment then moved behind Ye Jing Han in a flash and struck the back of her neck with her palm.

Ye Jing Han would have never imagined that Hua Qing Si would suddenly attack her; after all, it was obvious that Hua Qing Si was one of Yang Kai’s companions and that was why she didn’t guard against her. Upon suffering this palm strike though, Ye Jing Han dropped down weakly on the ground.

“Did you kill her?” The Embodiment was startled by this sight.

“Like hell I did!” Hua Qing Si rolled her eyes at him then curled her lips, saying, “I just knocked her out.” She paused for a moment then looked suspiciously at the Embodiment and asked, “What are you doing?”

As she spoke, she suddenly noticed that the Embodiment moved next to the dead Wind titled man and picked his corpse up from the ground.

The Embodiment grinned and said, “What do you think? This is a pretty good tonic. Tsk, tsk, a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator!”

Upon hearing this, Hua Qing Si’s pretty face turned pale, as if she had just recalled some pretty bad memory and she couldn’t help but say in alarm, “You’re going to use that evil technique to devour his physical essence?”

The Embodiment nodded, “I can’t let good food go to waste!”

“It’s so sickening, don’t do it in front of me, or I’ll break off relations with you,” Hua Qing Si spoke with her disgust apparent on her face.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s body suddenly flickered and appeared again on the prairie before he beckoned to the Embodiment and Hua Qing Si, “Come back!”

After he said so, he looked at the unconscious Ye Jing Han on the ground and nodded in understanding, “Knocking her out is also a pretty good solution.”

He waved his hand and sent Ye Jing Han into the Sealed World Bead, then opened a Void Crack and had Hua Qing Si and the Embodiment also go back in.

.....

Inside the Sealed World Bead, Yang Kai and the Embodiment appeared next to the medicine garden.

The Fire-titled man’s aura was already pretty feeble, with next to no vitality left. The dagger which had been stabbed into his chest was still drawing out a constant stream of blood. This man was already in a sorry state and he obviously wouldn’t be able to survive, yet he still laughed in mockery, “I have sustained a mortal wound, nothing can save me other than some extraordinary healing pills that are essentially legends now. Don’t waste your time on this, cough, cough...”

Saying so, he coughed loudly with blood flowing out of his mouth and nostrils.

Yang Kai snorted and said, “I can’t help you make a full recovery, but I can still preserve your life.”

Saying so, he walked directly over to the Fire man and opened his mouth before tossing a large number of healing pills into it.

The Fire-titled man was still quite stubborn and didn’t plan to cooperate, constantly shaking his head to resist. However, with his cultivation already sealed, there was no way he could stop Yang Kai. After a short bout of futile struggle, he swallowed down the Spirit Pills.

The Fire-titled cultivator’s vicious gaze still remained full of mockery though, obviously not believing that Yang Kai could preserve his life. He could feel his vitality leaving his body quickly, which was also a pretty scary experience, but it was still better than the torment awaiting him if he fell in the enemy’s hand.

Yang Kai sat down cross-legged in front of the Fire-titled man and started weaving hand seals under his gaze before striking his chest with his palm. After this strike, the dagger in his chest flew out, together with a large spurt of blood. This violent act caused the Fire-titled man to groan in pain, while his body trembled, feeling like he would shortly die.

But in the next moment, the Fire-titled cultivator felt a clear stream of rich vitality flowing into his body and pulling him back from the gates of death.

A numb feeling started spreading from his chest and the bleeding instantly stopped, while his lost vitality had also been replenished greatly.

He opened his eyes widely to take a look around and his gaze soon landed on a small green tree that couldn’t have been taller than a little child. This tiny tree emitted a green aura that was visible to the naked eye, and Yang Kai was clearly using some kind of technique to draw this green aura into his body.

“What... What is this?” The Fire-titled man was aware that he would surely die, but he was still stunned by this sight and his body shivered involuntarily. He could feel an unimaginable amount of vitality coming from this little tree, and he knew he had avoided death only thanks to the green aura it was emitting.

He was dumbstruck and he quickly realized that there was much more to this little tree than meets the eye.

“The Immortal Tree, ever heard about it?” Yang Kai gave him a wicked grin.

“The Immortal Tree?” The Fire-titled man’s body shivered as he stared at Yang Kai in shock before vehemently denying, “Nonsense, it’s said that the Immortal Tree was formed at the birth of the Universe and is condensed from the purest vital energy between Heaven and Earth. It is said to be able to revive even the dead and if one is able to refine it, they will obtain an immortal and indestructible body. How could you possess such a divine treasure...”

“You’re pretty knowledgeable,” Yang Kai chuckled in response.

“The Immortal Tree? Hmph, who are you trying to fool?” The Fire-titled cultivator snorted disdainfully.

“It’s up to you whether you believe it or not,” Yang Kai cast a glance at him then revealed a nasty smile as he said, “You already have enough vigour to bicker with me. Not bad, not bad, it looks like you still have some life left to live.”

After Yang Kai said so, the Fire-titled man was dumbstruck and his face changed colours repeatedly. A spectacular look was plastered on his face!

He discovered in shock that just this tiny bit of green aura from the small tree had healed all of his wounds and brought him back from the brink of death. Didn’t that mean that if he were to refine this strange tree, he would be able to make a complete recovery?

Once this thought ran across his mind, the Fire-titled cultivator was stunned and beads of sweat started dripping off his forehead. He didn’t want to believe it, but he had already felt it himself. If everything he just experienced was real, then this little tree might really be the legendary Immortal Tree.

*Gudong...*

The Fire Ghost couldn’t help gulping hard while his gaze turned hot as he stared at the Immortal Tree.

Yang Kai didn’t bother with him and he just told the Embodiment, “I’ll hand him over to you, get something useful out of him.”

“Relax, I’ll make him talk,” the Embodiment let out a peal of sinister laughter.

When this laughter fell upon the ears of the Fire-titled man, he couldn’t help shivering as he turned his eyes back to Yang Kai, yet at this moment only the Giant Stone man remained, sitting down cross-legged on the ground with a corpse in his hand.

“Wind...” The Fire-titled man looked aggrievedly at his companion’s corpse and couldn’t help but sympathize with him. However, his gaze quickly turned cold as he shouted at the Embodiment, “I don’t care what the hell you are, but don’t dream of getting any information out of me.”

“You’ve got some spine!” The Embodiment praised him and said, “I like unyielding people. So, you can be at ease, I won’t embarrass you.”

The Fire-titled man only sneered coldly in response. He obviously didn’t believe a word of what the Embodiment had said.

But surprisingly enough, the Embodiment didn’t pay heed to him and he didn’t even bother with torturing and interrogating him. He just put down the Wind titled man’s corpse in front of him and covered it with his giant stone hand.

“What are you planning to do with the Wind’s corpse?” The Fire man’s expression changed as he questioned him sharply.

“What am I planning to do? Hehehe...” The Embodiment let out a burst of strange laughter.

Blue veins bulged out of the Fire-titled man’s forehead as he became somewhat anxious for some unknown reason. The Embodiment hadn’t given him a single decent answer to any question he asked, so he couldn’t help but get angry over this.

While the Fire man was still fretting over this, he witnessed the Embodiment’s expression turn solemn before it shouted, “Heaven Devouring Battle Law!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

In an instant, the Fire-titled cultivator’s eyes widened and he shouted in shock through clenched teeth, “Heaven... Heaven Devouring Battle Law!?”

.....

The Fire-titled man wasn’t as tough as he claimed, or rather, he had just witnessed a scene far more frightening than death. He could stab his heart with his own dagger without the least bit of hesitation and seek death on his own, but upon seeing the Embodiment using the Heaven Devouring Battle Law on the Wind titled cultivator’s corpse, he instantly broke down and gave in.

None wished for his flesh and essence to end up being devoured. This was far crueller than simply being killed, so the Fire-titled man quickly divulged everything he knew.

Those four people were really cultivators from Blood Dagger, and they had received orders from their superiors to bring back Yang Kai alive to their headquarters. As for the reason behind this, the Fire-titled man had no idea and was simply following orders. Blood Dagger had a strict hierarchy and people below a certain level weren’t privy to the organization’s core secrets.

The four of them didn’t even know who it was among their superiors that issued this order, they only received their mission at a certain time at a specific location.

After the interrogation, Yang Kai got a rough idea about the colossal size of Blood Dagger. Blood Dagger had many members and had branches established in every territory. They even had members who belonged to other great Sects who would seem perfectly ordinary until they received a mission, after which they would carry out their orders as members of Blood Dagger without question.

Once the mission ended, these members would go back into hiding and none would be the wiser.

Once the Embodiment questioned the Fire man about the location of the Blood Dagger’s headquarters in the Southern Territory though, the latter’s Knowledge Sea burst open and he died before he could give any reply. It looked like a powerful Master had placed a restriction on him to prevent him from divulging Blood Dagger’s more sensitive secrets.

Upon getting this intel from the Embodiment, Yang Kai’s face turned gloomy.

He had come in contact with Blood Dagger for the first time today, and from what he had seen so far from the powerful Four Ghosts, this wasn’t an organization to be trifled with. They had already set their eyes on him, yet he didn’t even know the reason behind this, let alone any useful information about his new enemy.

Yang Kai’s mood became pretty bad because of this and he felt like a bone was now stuck in his throat.

Once Blood Dagger made a move, they would keep fighting until their last breath. This mission was obviously a great failure and Blood Dagger wouldn’t take things lying down, they would surely send more powerful Masters after him next time. Yang Kai could deal with the Wind, Thunder, Fire, and Mountain Ghosts, but what about the next batch? If they sent Emperor Realm Masters after him, what could he do?

In a flash, Yang Kai’s mind became fraught with concerns.
