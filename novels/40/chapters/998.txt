After some investigation, Yang Kai was surprised to find that he had not received any serious injuries.

Because he had fused with the Unyielding Golden Skeleton of Great Demon God, his bones were abnormally sturdy. His skeleton hadn’t received any damage just now, but his five viscera and six organs had received some shocks and he had many bruises and scars from various impacts.

These were all minor injuries and with Yang Kai’s current regenerative and restorative abilities, even without taking any healing medicines, he would recover within half a day.

The real trouble was the seal Lu Gui Chen had placed on him. All the Saint Qi within his meridians had been locked in place and couldn’t be used. On the other hand, his Spiritual Energy had not been affected, probably because Lu Gui Chen had felt that Yang Kai’s strength was too low to warrant such serious treatment.

This gave Yang Kai a glimmer of hope.

With his Spiritual Energy accessible, he could still find a way out of this mess.

He wasn’t afraid of Bi Ya, it was only Saint King Realm masters like Lu Gui Chen he had to worry about.

When he had seen it from above, Yang Kai knew that the area of ​​this continent wasn’t too big, and if he wasn’t able to somehow disappear without a trace, it wouldn’t be long before he would be tracked down.

Yang Kai hesitated as he weighed his options.

For the time being, he immersed his consciousness into his Knowledge Sea.

As soon as he entered his Knowledge Sea though, Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar frowned.

Because he found that inside his Knowledge Sea there were around fifty new Spiritual Energy masses, each of which contained varying amounts of energy.

Yang Kai was startled.

But he soon realized that these Spiritual Energy masses were the remnant Souls from the cultivators who had died during the previous disaster.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation not only wipe out other people’s Souls, but could also draw in the remnant Souls left behind when others died nearby Yang Kai. These remnant Souls must have been pulled into his Knowledge Sea by Demon Eye of Annihilation while he was unconscious.

This was a truly unexpected harvest.

Lacking time right now, Yang Kai didn’t perform a thorough inspection of these remnant Souls suspended above his Knowledge Sea and only gave them a rough check.

Most of these Spiritual Energy masses belonged to Saint Realm cultivators, but among them, Yang Kai actually found one that had belonged to a Saint King.

Yang Kai paled slightly.

Even some masters in the Saint King Realm had failed to survive that disaster, fully illustrating how terrifying the collision between the two Starships was, as well as how deadly that black hole had been.

Everyone who was still alive now should rejoice that their luck was not as bad as this Saint King Realm master.

In order to avoid arousing Bi Ya’s suspicions, after performing a cursory examination, Yang Kai took back his consciousness from his Knowledge Sea. Those groups of Spiritual Energy could wait until later when he found a safe opportunity to absorb.

The insights into the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao of a Saint King Realm cultivator was something Yang Kai was looking forward to very much, wondering just what kind of improvements they would bring to him.

When he opened his eyes again, just as he had expected, Yang Kai found that battles had broken out all around him.

The Purple Star and Star Union cultivators fought one another in groups of three or four, the previous disaster not even giving them pause, instead only fueling the anger that pushed them to slaughter the enemy they saw as responsible for their ill fate!

Lu Gui Chen was locked in combat with a beautiful mature woman who possessed a noble and graceful aura; however, despite her temperate appearance, her strength was extraordinary, not inferior to Lu Gui Chen’s at all. The short sword in her hand gave off an incomparably sharp aura and every time she swung it, swift rays of light would rush towards Lu Gui Chen, flying in a myriad of formations and patterns. Clearly, her level of swordsmanship was not low.

Lu Gui Chen didn’t dare have the slightest negligence while fighting this beautiful woman, wearing golden armour of light on his body and grasping a short spear in his hands. The short spear exuded a potent energy fluctuation as it gave off golden rays, meeting the incoming sword waves blow for blow.

The two masters fought high up in the sky, the fallout from their battle covering a wide area that all the Purple Star and Sword Union cultivators stayed well clear of for fear of being affected.

Yang Kai’s eyes swept across the battlefield, trying to find some kind of opportunity, a moment later opening his mouth to say to Bi Ya, “The fight has already started, don’t you need to help?”

Bi Ya shot him a look over at him and giggled, “Do you want to find a chance to escape?”

“My cultivation has been sealed, how am I supposed to escape? You can rest assured, if you go out to fight, I’ll wait here patiently for you. I’m also quite interested in what a woman like you tastes like.”

“Is that so?” Bi Ya’s face suddenly glowed somewhat radiantly, becoming more beautiful as her red lips twittered and her twin peaks trembled lightly, putting on full display their amazing elasticity.

However, she put away her smiling face as quickly as she had worn it and glared at Yang Kai coldly, “Don’t even dream about it, I’ll never give you the slightest chance, I’d rather sit here watching than let you escape.”

“Why?” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, feeling frustrated. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Bi Ya had made up her mind to not relax her surveillance of him, leaving truly helpless.

Just then, two white streaks suddenly flew past, seemingly chasing a Purple Star cultivator together, but when they passed by Yang Kai and Bi Ya, they let out a startled cry.

Immediately, the two figures came to a halt and stared blankly at Yang Kai.

The older woman showed a surprised look, “How is it you?”

“It’s you two?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

These two women were the first people he had met after coming to the Star Field, He Zao and He Miao of Sword Union.

Seeing them, Yang Kai’s mouth curled up slightly, suddenly thinking that the situation wasn’t as bad as he had imagined.

“Since you’re here... that must mean that Sword Union’s forces found you, yes?” Yang Kai seemed to ask casually.

“En,” He Miao nodded heavily, smiling happily, “Soon after we separated from you, master arrived with the others and found us, but the Purple Star people were simply too hateful. They refused to give up and chased us all the way here, finally causing all of us to fall into misfortune, yet even now, they still want to keep fighting.”

“Why are you here?” He Zao was clearly much more mature and had quickly noticed that something was wrong.

Yang Kai was standing beside a Purple Star cultivator, and although he didn’t seem to have been exposed to any ill-treatment, his strength was clearly sealed.

He had obviously been captured by the other side.

On top of that, while they were speaking, this Purple Star woman was quietly circulating her strength, preparing herself to act at a moment’s notice.

“It’s a long story...” Yang Kai coughed awkwardly.

“You couldn’t be this loose woman’s... boy toy?” He Miao covered her small mouth as she showed a look of incredible shock on her cute face along with no small amount of disdain and loathing.

Yang Kai was stunned, not having expected even He Miao to recognize Bi Ya; it seems when Shen Tu had said that Bi Ya was a famous celebrity, he had not been exaggerating.

“Little girl, it seems you weren’t educated properly!” Bi Ya eyes flashed coldly, obviously angry that He Miao had called her a loose woman, “Didn’t your parents ever teach you to treat others with politeness and courtesy?”

“Hmph, who doesn’t know you in this Star Field? Aren’t you embarrassed to even speak about proper education? Do you have anything of that sort?” He Miao shot back, waving the glowing long sword in her hand as she shouted tenderly, “Elder Sister, there’s no need to speak any nonsense with her, let’s go!”

He Zao said nothing and simply gently nodded, sending Yang Kai a stealthy wink before she and her younger sister shot gathered their strength and rushed over.

Before the two sisters had even arrived, a bone-chilling Sword Qi like the frigid north wind descended upon the area, causing the surrounding earth to crack and sword marks to appear.

Bi Ya snorted, wielding her Dragon Bone Whip once more, causing the Azure Dragon phantom to reappear and soar towards the pair of sisters, blades of wind flying out from its body, seemingly trying to slice through He Zao and He Miao’s necks.

Instantly, the three figures became entangled.

Taking this opportunity, Yang Kai scurried away.

Bi Ya was only a Third-Order Saint, the same as He Zao, and although He Miao was slightly worse off, only a Second-Order Saint, with the two sisters working together, Bi Ya would obviously not be their opponent.

Therefore, Yang Kai wasn’t worried about He Zao and He Miao’s safety. Right now, the most important thing for Yang Kai to do was to withdraw.

His speed was extremely fast; although his Saint Qi was sealed, Yang Kai’s physique was incredibly strong, so it only took him a few short breaths to escape from the chaotic battlefield and find a well-hidden location. Once he was safe, he sat down cross-legged. While maintaining his vigilance of the surrounding, Yang Kai tried his best to circulate the Saint Qi in his body to break the seal Lu Gui Chen had planted on him.

The battle between Purple Star and Sword Union continued, both sides seemingly baring bitter hatred towards each other, neither of them willing to show weakness.

Cultivators from both sides continued to fall, littering the ground with fresh corpses.

Yang Kai sat and watched, and fortunately. During this time, no one came to find trouble with him.

Suddenly, when his gaze wandered over to a particular location, a strange look appeared on his face.

Over there was an old man in a blue robe with messy grey hair seemingly searching for something.

This old man was indifferent to everything around him, his complete attention focused on the various pieces of Starship debris around him. From time to time, he would pick up a piece of the broken Starship from the ground, knock it with his hand and nod lightly, his ring flashing in the next instant and the piece of debris disappearing inside.

A short time later, he had collected several dozen pieces of Starship; these fragments varied in size but were all manufactured from good quality materials.

What could be preserved in that disaster and at least the materials of the Saint King High-Rank are tempered.

While he was picking up the Starship pieces, he would sometimes mutter to himself and let out a laugh, seemingly very satisfied.

Such a strange person casually shuttling through the chaotic battlefield naturally drew many people’s attention.

But what surprised Yang Kai the most was that neither the Purple Star or Sword Union cultivators were able to approach this old man.

No matter who it was, before they could get close to him, they would be guided away by some kind of invisible force. Noticing this, the cultivators who went to find trouble with him quickly realized that this old man wasn’t someone they could easily provoke, causing them to hastily withdraw and not dare to approach him again.

And so, the old man was able to leisurely stroll about and collect the various Starship fragments.

Eventually, the strange old man finally caught the attention of the two forces’ real masters.

Lu Gui Chen and the mature beauty from Sword Union who were fighting high up in the sky simultaneously retreated, opening up some distance between them as they continued to stare at one another; however, they were also paying close attention to the old man down below.
