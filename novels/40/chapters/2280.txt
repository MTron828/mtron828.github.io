“What’s the matter? Come in and let’s have a chat,” Yang Kai gestured lightly with his head then pushed open the door and went into the room.

Upon hearing this, Ye Jing Han was taken aback and the distress apparent on her face quickly turned into delight as she said sweetly, “Many thanks, Young Master Yang!”

She quickly went inside, as if she was afraid Yang Kai would go back on his word.

Inside the room, Yang Kai had just started observing the room and he still didn’t have a clear look at the ornaments and furniture here. Yet, Ye Jing Han had already moved to quickly place a chair behind him, “Young Master Yang, please sit down.”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her then raised his robe and sat down.

At this moment, Ye Jing Han had already raised the teapot on the table and poured water for Yang Kai then placed the cup in front of him, “Young Master Yang, please have a drink.”

After her voice fell, she moved her hands again and a plate of fresh spirit fruits appeared on the table. She asked with a smile, “I have brought them with me from Thousand Leaves Sect. I wonder if they are to your liking? Please don’t refuse them.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange, as he had never been served so attentively before by anyone. If Ye Jing Han worked as a servant or maid, then she would be a very competent one.

“Why are you serving me?” Yang Kai looked at her warily, “Did you fall for me? I know that I’m so handsome and graceful and a lot of women are in love with me...” He flung his head back and said in a deep voice, “But I’m already taken. So, you have to refrain from having any presumptuous thoughts about me.”

Upon hearing this, Ye Jing Han’s face got flushed and she said indignantly, “Young Master Yang, what are you saying...”

She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She had never seen someone who could boast so shamelessly.

“Huh... Am I mistaken?” Embarrassment appeared on Yang Kai’s face and he let out a hollow laugh, “I’m just joking, don’t take it seriously.”

As he spoke, he took a spirit fruit on the table and started gnawing on it. It was pretty delicious and he couldn’t help but nod, “Speak, what kind of pill do you want?”

“What?” Ye Jing Han was bewildered by his question and a confused look appeared on her face.

Yang Kai sneered, “You have been following me since you recognized me, and you’re still serving me so meticulously. The only thing left is for you to serve me in bed. Aren’t you here to ask something from me?”

“You’re right...” Ye Jing Han nodded.

“Aren’t you here to ask me to refine a pill for you?”

Ye Jing Han revealed an enlightened look and said with a smile, “Young Master Yang, your attainments in the Alchemic Dao have already reached an unimaginable height, even allowing you to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill. Your talent and attainments in this craft are second to none in the world.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I know that you are flattering me, but it’s still pleasant to hear.” Yang Kai chuckled in response.

Ye Jing Han continued, “But I didn’t seek you to ask you to refine a pill for me.”

“Then what do you want?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows and got wary.

Ye Jing Han explained, “Our Thousand Leaves Sect isn’t a big Sect, but we still have a Dao Source Grade Alchemist under our employ, so we don’t have to trouble you to refine pills for us. I have sought you out to ask you to repair something for us.”

“Repair?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows, “What is it?”

Ye Jing Han pursed her rosy lips and surveyed the surroundings warily before saying in a low voice, “A Space Array.”

“A Space Array?” Yang Kai’s pupils contracted and he chuckled then said, “It looks like a lot of people know that I am well-versed in the Dao of Space.”

In the Four Seasons Realm, he had manipulated Space Principles in front of many people, so obviously he couldn’t keep this a secret any longer. He had already expected that this matter would be exposed, but he still didn’t expect that Ye Jing Han sought him out due to this. She obviously wanted to draw help from his comprehension of the Dao of Space to repair the Space Array.

“I indeed heard such news from a certain individual.”

“If it’s just for repairing a Space Array, then you don’t have to seek me out. Why not find an appropriate Array Master?”

Ye Jing Han smiled bitterly, “If it was an ordinary Space Array, then an Array Master would have been able to repair it, but my Thousand Leaves Sect’s Array is... We have already sought several Array Masters and have even invited members of the Gong Family, but none were able to repair it.”

“Even the members of the Gong Family couldn’t repair it?” Yang Kai was surprised to hear this before he suddenly realized something, asking in a solemn tone, “Is it a... World Crossing Space Array?”

Ye Jing Han’s pretty eyes lit up and she nodded, “Young Master Yang, you’re indeed as sharp as the rumours say! It is a World Crossing Space Array.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed as he stared at Ye Jing Han and asked, “Does your Thousand Leaves Sect control a Sealed World?”

Ye Jing Han let out a bitter laugh, “It looks like I can’t hide anything from Young Master Yang. En, you are correct, my Thousand Leaves Sect possesses a Sealed World, and it was once used as a cultivation paradise for our disciples. We don’t know how this Sealed World was formed, and we also don’t know where exactly it is located in The Void, so we have no other way to enter it except through the Space Array, but the array somehow stopped working nearly two thousand years ago, making it impossible for us to enter the Sealed World since then.”

“Is that Sealed World so important to your Thousand Leaves Sect?” Yang Kai asked.

Ye Jing Han nodded, “Two thousand years ago, while my Thousand Leaves Sect was not on par with the top sects like Azure Sun Temple and Heavenly Martial Holy Land, we were still considered a first-class force. However, after the entrance to the Sealed World was lost, the Sect entered a period of decline. Today, we are barely...”

Ye Jing Han stopped here, as if she didn’t want to talk about their current dire straits.

Yang Kai sneered, “The members of your Sect simply didn’t cultivate hard enough, this has nothing to do with losing your Sealed World. Not every Sect has its own Sealed World, but as long as one strives to make progress and advance further, such a Sealed World makes no difference.”

Ye Jing Han’s pretty face turned pale and she said bitterly, “Young Master Yang, you aren’t mistaken; however, two thousand years ago, the Sect Master at the time brought many of the Sect’s core inheritances as well as the supreme treasures of our Sect into that Sealed World, all of which became lost to us when the entrance disappeared. Many of our Thousand Leaves Sect’s Secret Arts and Techniques could no longer be cultivated after losing those inheritances, and the Aura Gathering Array of our Sect also used that Sealed World as its core. Once the entrance shut, the World Energy density of our Sect also began thinning...”

“I understand.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai had already understood Ye Jing Han’s implication. They had lost the inheritances connected to numerous Techniques and Divine Abilities, as well as their supreme treasures and their supply of World Energy. What cultivators needed most to cultivate was abundant World Energy, and if their supply became scarce, then it was normal for subsequent generations from Thousand Leaves Sect to become weaker.

Ye Jing Han bit her rosy lips and said in a deep voice, “I want to invite you to take a trip with me to Thousand Leaves Sect in order to repair our World Crossing Space Array. If you agree to do so, then all members of Thousand Leaves Sect will be very grateful to you and we will offer you a generous reward.”

“This...” Yang Kai rolled his eyes around and racked his brain for a long time, yet couldn’t come up with any excuses, so he could only say, “I got it, but I’m quite busy now. Why don’t you go back for now? Once I have some free time, I’ll take a trip to your Thousand Leaves Sect and I’ll be sure to live up to your expectations.”

Ye Jing Han could clearly discern that he was just being perfunctory in his response. If she really trusted him and left, then she probably wouldn’t ever see his shadow again. She could only entreat him anxiously, “Young Master Yang, it is only someone who is proficient in the Dao of Space who can repair our Sect’s Space Array. But the Dao of Space is so esoteric and mysterious that ordinary people cannot even begin to comprehend it. I have heard that a great Senior living in the Eastern Territory’s Spirit Beast Island is proficient in the Dao of Space, that Senior is a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, and our little Thousand Leaves Sect can’t invite him.”

“Are you implying that it’s easy for you to invite an insignificant Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator like me?” Yang Kai cast a glance at her.

Ye Jing Han quickly waved her hand and said, “That isn’t what I mean. Young Master Yang, please don’t take offence.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I have also heard about that Senior from Spirit Beast Island...”

It looked like Mo Xiao Qi was also from the Spirit Beast Island, but she had never admitted it; however, after Yang Kai gained some understanding of the Star Boundary, it wasn’t difficult for him to guess her origins after witnessing her Aunt Feng’s terrifying strength.

Only the members of the Spirit Beast Island could control so many Monster Beasts and have them fight for them.

As he thought about Mo Xiao Qi, he couldn’t help but wonder how she was faring.

He arrived at the Star Boundary not long ago and he knew only a few people. One of them was Kang Si Ran, but he had been transferred by the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce after he reached the Dao Source Realm. As for his second acquaintance, Mo Xiao Qi, she had been fetched by her Aunty Feng and taken back home.

Ye Jing Han suddenly noticed that Yang Kai had quieted and got lost in his thoughts for a long while. She could only say through gnashed teeth. “Actually, I have sought you on someone’s recommendation.”

“Which shameless bastard has done so? Tell me, just tell me, I promise I won’t kill him,” Yang Kai flew into a rage.

Ye Jing Han pursed her lips and said with a smile, “It was Gong Wen Shan, you know him, don’t you?”

“That bastard!” Yang Kai’s eyes bulged as he muttered, “Do you know him?”

Gong Wen Shan was the rising star of the Heavenly River Valley’s Gong Family. The Gong Family was famed for its Array Masters, and Gong Wen Shan was also an Array Master. In the Four Seasons Realm, he had drawn help from the barrier around the Flowing Time Temple to obstruct Heavenly Martial Holy Land’s Wu Chang, forcing the latter to miss a rare opportunity because of this.

That boy looked honest and simple-minded, but he was actually a sinister and scheming scourge.

Yang Kai would have never imagined that it was Gong Wen Shan who recommended him to Ye Jing Han.

Ye Jing Han replied, “Several years ago, we invited him to repair our Thousand Leaves Sect’s Space Array, but he didn’t succeed and he told us to seek a person proficient in the Dao of Space to repair it. Three months ago, I suddenly received a message from him suggesting I seek Young Master Yang out. I planned to deal with this place’s affairs first before making a trip to Azure Sun Temple to try my luck, but I didn’t expect to run into you here. Don’t you think we were brought together by fate?”

Ye Jing Han revealed an excited look, as if she was a young girl yearning for love.

Yang Kai snorted, “Only distressed men and lovestruck girls are brought together by fate, do you want to have such a fate with me?”

Ye Jing Han sweated profusely and said awkwardly, “Young Master Yang, you really know how to joke. I’m not so fortunate.”

“I have met that brat, Gong Wen Shan, only once and I’m not close to him. He has to take responsibility for his words. This has nothing to do with me.”

Ye Jing Han let out a long sigh, “Young Master Yang, you don’t want to help me, do you?”

She bit her thin lips, wearing an adorable and pitiful look.
