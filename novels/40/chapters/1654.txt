Chapter 1654, Unsealing

“Is this mine?” Su Yan looked up at the huge Ice Phoenix phantom, and as if sensing her gaze, the Ice Phoenix, which should be nothing more than a remnant image, lowered its head and staring at Su Yan with its noble eyes, a look of kindness and approval flashing across them in the next instant.

Everyone stared dumbfounded.

With the Ice Phoenix Source strength integrating into her body, Su Yan felt incredibly relaxed and the backlash she had been suffering from the Ice Jade Secret Art was instantly resolved.

The pure white phantom floating above her head felt like her own flesh and blood, merging perfectly with her form.

In an instant, her skin became like polished white jade and her slender neck gained a porcelain-like sheen. At this moment, Su Yan’s charm increased several levels, enough to entrance all living things.

Even masters like Chi Huo and Luo Hai could not help losing their focus temporarily as they stared at Su Yan’s dazzling radiance.

“En, I brought it with me from Tong Xuan Realm,” Yang Kai nodded.

The Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair talked with one another as if they were the only ones present, completely unphased by their current situation.

“Hmm... it feels so natural,” Su Yan took a breath and closed her beautiful eyes, her heart resonating at that moment with the Ice Phoenix phantom. The Ice Phoenix cried out happily, seemingly with infinite power, causing the icy air across all of Pure Ice Island to pulse in resonance. Soon, the ice-cold World Energy within thousands of kilometres began flooding towards Su Yan’s body, which absorbed it without any difficulty.

Su Yan’s own aura grew at a terrifying speed.

Originally, she was at the peak of the First-Order Origin Returning Realm and, if Yang Kai had not appeared, would have been in the final stages of preparing to break through to the Second-Order.

But because of the backlash of the Ice Jade Secret Art, her cultivation had instead regressed slightly.

Now, however, her cultivation began soaring upwards.

Peak First-Order, Second-Order, peak Second-Order...

Su Yan smashed through the barriers between these realms like they were made from rotting bamboo, only stopping at the peak Second-Order after some kind of external influence intervened.

This interference naturally came from Yang Kai!

At this moment, the two had formed a bizarre resonance, and with Yang Kai’s cultivation having only reached the peak Second-Order Origin Realm, Su Yan was also unable to continue improving, otherwise, the balance between their Saint Qis would definitely be broken.

However, everyone could tell that she still had plenty of energy to spare! She was more than capable of breaking through to the Third-Order at this instant!

Everyone was shocked as none of them had ever even heard of someone breaking through so quickly and without any hidden dangers. This could not be described as an opportunity anymore, only the word miracle was appropriate.

Yang Kai just smiled lightly, as if all of this was within his expectations.

A resonant dragon roar and phoenix cry sounded again, as the giant Golden Dragon and Ice Phoenix phantoms suddenly distorted, transformed into bright flashes of light, and poured into the bodies of Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Around the Senior Sister and Junior Brother pair, a strange aura continued to linger, however.

This aura was visible to the naked eye, with one half of it golden and the other white, the two halves pulsing with completely opposite attribute energies, but still merged together perfectly, giving off a momentum that far exceeded anything an Origin Returning Realm cultivator could achieve!

No Origin Returning Realm master could work up the will to resist when faced with such an overwhelming aura.

“This is your trump card?” Luo Hai’s eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at Yang Kai indifferently, stepping forward lightly from where he stood.

Every time he took a step, however, Pure Ice Island seemed to shake, along with the hearts of everyone else on the island.

With each step he took, his momentum also increased.

Yang Kai’s and Su Yan’s golden and white Yin-Yang field could not suppress Luo Hai.

Yang Kai still did not change his expression though, smiling as he watched his approaching enemy.

“If this is your last card, then this King advises you to give it up. Your strength is indeed amazing, enough to be invincible below the Origin King Realm, even giving you the capital to resist an ordinary First-Order Origin King.”

As soon as these words came out, both Chi Huo and Luo Li frowned.

Whether they wanted to admit it or not, Luo Hai was telling the truth. Both of them felt some slight pressure when facing the current Yang Kai and Su Yan pair, as if fighting with them would be tricky and even if they could ultimately win, they would have to pay a huge price to do so.

This was nothing short of astonishing.

Origin Kings were the peak of this world, and any Origin King could sweep away Origin Realm cultivators with ease, no matter how many of them they faced.

Yang Kai and Su Yan being capable of fighting an ordinary Origin King with only their own power went beyond the limits of conventional thinking.

Out of everyone present, only Luo Hai had the qualifications to disdain the current Yang Kai and Su Yan. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Boy, obediently follow this King and I promise not to kill you!” Luo Hai looked at Yang Kai sternly, no longer keeping up his previous act.

“You won’t regret it unless you see your coffin it seems. Luo Hai, I had no grievance or grudge with you, but you have continued to pursue me doggedly and forced my hand. Good, today, I’ll kill you, so I can avoid any trouble with you in the future,” Yang Kai shouted.

“Kill me?” Luo Hai seemed to have heard some funny joke and laughed loudly, “It seems that your self-confidence is overwhelming, but do you think you can kill me like this? This King will let you understand what it means to be a true Origin King!”

As soon as these words fell, a bizarre force suddenly spread out towards Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Domain!

A Star Master level Domain at that.

The earth suddenly creaked, and at the original location of the ice palace, fissures began opening, as if the world itself was about to collapse under the effects of Luo Hai’s Domain.

“Brother Luo Hai, this old master will assist you!” Chi Huo yelled and at the same time released his Domain, putting even more pressure on Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Luo Hai glanced at him but didn’t raise any objections.

He naturally knew what Chi Huo was thinking.

Chi Huo simply did not want him to monopolize all the benefits this brat had to offer for himself, so he decided to ‘help’ in an attempt to get a piece of the pie.

Luo Hai was not bothered by this though. All he wanted was Yang Kai’s secrets, as for the girl named Su Yan... Although her Ice Phoenix Source was an incredible treasure as well, it was incompatible with his cultivation method, so it was useless to him.

As soon as the Domains of two Origin King Realm masters came out, the faces of the Ice Heart Valley Elders changed dramatically.

Luo Li hurriedly released her own Domain to offset the pressure on them and at the same time shouted, “Withdraw!”

If they did not leave immediately, these Elders would be injured.

Bing Long, Ran Yun Ting, and all the others did not say a word as they quickly used their Movement Skills to leave this place, leaping back a thousand meters and flying up into the sky. From their position, they all looked down in shock, leaving only Luo Li standing close to the strange standoff with a complicated expression on her face. Luo Li had no intention to interfere, and could only let out a sigh as she stared at Yang Kai and Su Yan full of regret.

“Senior Sister, are you ready?” Even with two Origin King Realm masters suppressing them with their Domains, Yang Kai remained calm and relaxed.

After experiencing the Blood Prison Trial, he had become accustomed to the intensity and influence of Domain. Such a Domain alone could not crush him, and so long as he did not fall, neither would Su Yan.

“I am!” Su Yan nodded.

The two of them were one in body and mind, so there was no need for Yang Kai to explain anything more, with just a thought, Su Yan understood what he was going to do.

“Then our fight begins now!” Yang Kai grinned, turned his head, and stared at Luo Hai coldly, “Luo Hai, today, you die!”

As soon as these words fell, a strange token suddenly appeared in his hand.

This token was black, made from some unidentifiable material, and was somewhat unremarkable.

But as soon as this token appeared, Luo Hai brow jumped as a feeling of terror suddenly gripped his heart.

“This is...” Luo Hai stared at the token with uncertainty for a moment before finally shouting, “Emperor Pressure! A Star Emperor Token?”

There was a faint, almost imperceptible aura coming from this token, but it was enough to cause Luo Hai’s face to pale.

Also, the character for ‘Emperor’ was clearly emblazoned on this token, allowing Luo Hai to understand what Yang Kai’s final card was.

He possessed a Star Emperor Token! And it was a still intact Star Emperor Token!

Rumours had it that the Starry Sky Great Emperor lived thousands of years ago and reigned supreme over the Star Field, leaving behind many legendary tales before at some point simply vanishing without a trace.

However, during the Great Emperor’s time, he refined nine Star Emperor Tokens and sealed one of his Divine Abilities inside each one. This Divine Ability was enough to kill any Origin King in mere breaths, a level of power impossible for any master in the Star Field to achieve.

Star Emperor Tokens were just the stuff of legends for ordinary cultivators, most of whom had no idea whether they even really existed or not.

However, masters at Luo Hai’s level knew full well that the Star Emperor Tokens really did exist. It was an open secret amongst top-level powerhouses that Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce possessed a Star Emperor Token, but theirs had already been unsealed. Only retaining barely any Emperor Pressure.

If an Origin King wore a Star Emperor Token on their body and perceived the Emperor Pressure it gave off for many years, it increased their chances of comprehending a higher Heavenly Way and Martial Dao.

As such, Luo Hai recognized the token in Yang Kai’s hand immediately and became unnerved.

“Not good!” Luo Hai exclaimed, “Brother Chi Huo, kill them quickly, they must not be allowed to unseal that Star Emperor Token.”

Chi Huo shivered as a trace of determination and cruelty flashed across his eyes. Biting his tongue, Chi Huo spat out a mouthful of his Blood Essence which immediately transformed into a raging ball of flame that shot towards Yang Kai and Su Yan.

He was a decisive man and understood that if he hesitated for an instant here, he would suffer unbearable consequences, so he had not hesitated to use his Blood Essence to deliver an overwhelming attack. He only wanted to kill Yang Kai and Su Yan as quickly as possible; otherwise, once the Star Emperor Token was unsealed, he would be defeated in an instant.

The Great Emperor’s prestige was so great that none dared challenge his might.

While Chi Huo took action, Luo Hai also acted, summoning a long sword-like artifact. The surface of this sword shone brightly, like moonlight, and exuded an aura of an Origin King Grade artifact. Luo Hai poured his Saint Qi into this sword, causing it to tremble slightly before his figure flickered and he suddenly disappeared.

By the time he reappeared, he was already standing in front of Yang Kai, piercing his sword towards the latter’s heart.

Yang Kai just stood on the spot and sneered lightly, unafraid of the deadly threats approaching as he poured his Saint Qi madly into the Star Emperor Token in his hand.

The world suddenly shook, as if the end of all creation had arrived, and an ancient and terrifying aura filled the air.
