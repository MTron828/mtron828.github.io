“Observing the myriad forms of the Human world, seeing all the prosperity of the bustling world…” Yang Kai suddenly recalled the words etched at the entrance of Marketplace.

The Old Ancestor lightly nodded, “Living inside the bustling world can quickly heal my injuries, which is why there is a Marketplace in Yin-Yang Pass.”

Yang Kai suddenly came to a realization.

The Old Ancestor’s healing technique was somewhat similar to Duan Hong Chen’s Secret Art. Duan Hong Chen’s title was Bustling World, and his entire cultivation was based on experiencing the baptism of the Bustling World.

Yang Kai couldn’t comment on the profundities of this technique; after all, he had never cultivated such a technique before, but since the Old Ancestor had said as much, it must be so.

At this point, he suddenly understood why the Old Ancestor had summoned him.

“Does Old Ancestor want this Junior to help you heal your injuries?”

The Old Ancestor agreed, nodding, “I’ve heard that you have raised many living beings in your Small Universe and it can be considered a complete World. It would be a huge advantage if you could help me heal my injuries. I don’t need to heal completely, just enough to regain the strength to fight.”

At this time, Tang Qiu also interjected, “Although the Black Ink Clan army isn’t receiving many reinforcements, it will take at least three to five years to force them to withdraw.”

Compared to previous wars with the Black Ink Clan, which took more than a decade or even a century to end, three to five years was already an extremely short time, and all of this was thanks to Yang Kai. Had he not destroyed so many Black Ink Nest behind the enemy lines and occupied so many Black Ink Clansmen, the Black Ink Clan’s forces wouldn’t have been so strained.

“Although three to five years isn’t a long time, if the war continues, Yin-Yang Pass will definitely suffer some damage. But if the Old Ancestor can take action, she will definitely be able to end things in one fell swoop.”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, stating, “If Old Ancestor requires it, this Junior is duty-bound to comply.”

“Good, many thanks for your hard work in advance,” Tang Qiu patted Yang Kai’s shoulder in relief.

In order to allow the Old Ancestor to experience the hustle and bustle of the mundane world and heal her injuries, Yang Kai needed to spread out his Small Universe and let her wander about inside.

The Old Ancestor was a Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so Yang Kai naturally couldn’t take her into his Small Universe. He had no other choice but to do things this way.

Since that was the case, Yang Kai would be unable to participate in future battles as he would need to remain in one place. Yang Kai could not easily move before the Old Ancestor had regained her full strength.

Fortunately, Tang Qiu also said that since the Old Ancestor had decided to decimate the Black Ink Clan army personally, Yin-Yang Pass’ next strategy would be to harden its defences and wait. No matter how the Black Ink Clan provoked them, they would pretend they didn’t hear anything. The Humans would only rely on the Spirit Arrays and artifacts around Yin-Yang Pass to kill the Black Ink Clansmen who got too close. They would not be sending troops out onto the battlefield.

Soon, Yang Kai spread his Small Universe in the Marketplace and let the Old Ancestor enter. Not only that, but he also chose the most prosperous city for her to arrive at.

While the Old Ancestor was roaming around the mundane world in his Small Universe, Yang Kai did not remain idle. Although he could no longer freely move due to having spread his Small Universe, cultivating was not an issue for him. As such, he took out a set of Seventh-Order materials and quietly began refining them.

Inside Void World, Miao Fei Ping of Seven Stars Sect had long since matured from an innocent brat to an Emperor Realm Master and was now an Elder of Seven Stars Sect.

His aptitude was quite good, and not too long ago, he even helped the Ancestor kill a powerful enemy, earning him much praise.

After that incident, the Ancestor also bestowed the Seven Stars Sect with many resources and passed down the method to condense one’s Dao Seal. Many of Seven Stars Sect’s Emperor Realm Masters had already begun doing just that. Rumour had it that they would advance the Open Heaven Realm in the future as long as they worked hard.

Miao Fei Ping was naturally no exception. Which cultivator didn’t yearn for a higher Martial Dao? Among all the Emperor Realm Masters who had begun refining Powers into their Dao Seal, Miao Fei Ping’s progress was the fastest.

He originally thought that he would at most be able to condense Fifth-Order Powers with his aptitude. This was also the advice given by the Ancestor when he originally bestowed them with the necessary materials.

Of course, he wouldn’t dare disregard the Ancestor’s advice.

However, when he really began condensing Powers into his Dao Seal, he decided to be a little more courageous and try refining Sixth-Order materials.

Much to his surprise, he actually succeeded. He didn’t feel any discomfort or burden either. In other words, he could condense Sixth-Order Element Powers and attempt to break through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. He was extremely excited with this result, but at the same time, he couldn’t help but feel puzzled. It was because the Ancestor had said that although his aptitude was excellent, he would only be able to reach the Fifth Order in the future. [The Ancestor could not have made a mistake, so how could I successfully condense Sixth-Order Powers?]

He really wanted to consult with the Ancestor and ask for an explanation, but he was unable to contact him, so he had no choice but to give up. Miao Fei Ping was still in the process of condensing Powers, and he was refining a Sixth-Order material. He wanted to obtain higher achievements and a higher starting point.

Because he knew that his two companions who had entered the Sect with him had received personal guidance from the Ancestor himself, they would surely soar higher in the future. Miao Fei Ping didn’t want to be left far behind by these two, so he could only re-double his efforts.

Thinking back to when he first entered Seven Stars Sect, all the past events vividly flashed in his mind, [So many years have gone by in the blink of an eye. Where is that cold and aloof little girl with Heaven-defying aptitude and that young boy with such poor aptitude that he could barely cultivate? Even Xu Yi who had suddenly appeared in Seven Stars Sect just disappeared one day.]

Those three were the Ancestor’s Personal Disciples, so they might be cultivating with the Ancestor.

One day, while Miao Fei Ping was meditating, a voice suddenly spoke to him.

Miao Fei Ping was both surprised and delighted. He quickly opened his eyes and bowed respectfully, “Ancestor.”

He failed to spot the Ancestor’s figure, yet his voice sounded straight into his mind. It was not the first time he had seen the Ancestor’s divine might, so he did not find it strange.

The Ancestor’s message was actually a secret order, which Miao Fei Ping immediately accepted.

Having done so, Miao Fei Ping quickly requested, “Ancestor, this Junior has a question he would like to ask.”

“What is it?” The Ancestor’s voice sounded again.

Miao Fei Ping took a deep breath and mustered up his courage before explaining, “Ancestor, you gave me some pointers before and said that I should condense Fifth-Order Powers. However, this Junior got greedy and tried to refine a Sixth-Order material. Surprisingly, I didn’t encounter any problems. But this Disciple no longer dares to recklessly advance without understanding why I am alright. Ancestor, please grant me some guidance; should I continue refining Sixth-Order materials, or switch back to the Fifth-Order materials?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

As soon as he finished speaking, Miao Fei Ping immediately felt a majestic Will sweep over him. In the face of this Will, he couldn’t help but feel as insignificant as an ant.

[This is the Will of the Ancestor…]

Miao Fei Ping couldn’t help but slightly tremble.

[The Third-Order Emperor Realm is already the highest Realm in this World, but it is still nothing before the Ancestor. Just how high is the Ancestor’s cultivation?]

Soon after the Will swept over him, Miao Fei Ping heard the Ancestor’s voice in his mind, “Continue. Times are different now and you have a chance to advance to the Sixth Order.”

“Junior obeys!” Miao Fei Ping was overjoyed and gave his thanks. The unease that had been troubling him all the while finally disappeared after receiving his Ancestor’s guidance.

Be that as it may, he didn’t quite get why things were different now. [I haven’t done anything recently, but from what the Ancestor said, it seemed like something had changed, allowing me to advance to the Sixth Order despite only having the aptitude for Fifth Order in the past.]

What changed?

Thinking about it, Miao Fei Peng recalled that the newly recruited disciples of the Sect seemed to have much better aptitude than in the past. And it was not just true for Seven Stars Sect, but for all Sects across Void World. It’s as if the entire World had suddenly become more suitable for cultivation. More and more geniuses were appearing, causing the higher-ups of the various Sects to celebrate.

Thinking so, Miao Fei Ping immediately understood that what changed was not himself, but the World he lived in!

He didn’t continue mulling over the issue though. Rather, he quickly packed up his things and went to Seven Stars Sect’s Sect Master, Shang Guan Ji, requesting a leave to travel the world.

Shang Guan Ji had no reason to refuse and promptly agreed. And so, Miao Fei Ping, without wasting any time, quickly left the Sect.

Purple Phoenix City was among the most prosperous cities in Void World and was under Purple Phoenix Palace’s jurisdiction. Purple Phoenix Palace was also one of the strongest Sects in the entire Void World. More importantly, the disciples of this Sect had a gift for commerce. This commercial success allowed them to attract countless cultivators from all over the world to Purple Phoenix City, and it soon grew into a prosperous metropolis with over 10 million inhabitants.

With Miao Fei Ping’s Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, it had only taken him a few days to reach this city from Seven Stars Sect and following the Ancestor’s guidance, he quickly found his target.

A seven or eight-year-old girl!

Wandering alone in this massive Purple Phoenix City, Miao Fei Ping was certain that this little girl had never cultivated and was just a commoner who could be found anywhere.

The secret order Miao Fei Ping had received was to take good care of this little girl and not let her suffer any injustice, while not letting his whereabouts be exposed.

At first, he could not understand why someone like the Ancestor would care so much about a little mortal girl and even ask him to personally keep an eye on her, but when he saw the rattle drum in the little girl’s hand, Miao Fei Ping suddenly understood.

He recognized this rattle drum as it had been personally crafted by an Emperor Realm Elder of his Sect. He had been next to him when that Elder had made this rattle drum.

[This little girl… is the Ancestor’s descendant!]

The Ancestor had given a series of decrees back then, asking for steamed stuffed buns and candied fruits, all to coax this little girl.

Having understood this point, Miao Fei Ping immediately felt a heavy weight on his shoulders. He felt extremely honoured that the Ancestor gave him such an important task.

Because of this, Miao Fei Ping had been secretly following the little girl and protecting her at all times.

After observing her for a while, Miao Fei Ping discovered that she was particularly interested in snacks, but she did not seem to have any money on her. Every time she saw someone eat something, she would always start drooling, making her look extremely pitiful.

Several times, Miao Fei Ping couldn’t bear to watch and almost offered his assistance. At these times, he couldn’t help feeling a little puzzled. Since this little girl was the Ancestor’s descendant, why didn’t the Ancestor give her any money so she could buy the things she wanted? Obtaining mundane coins should be a breeze for the Ancestor.

But since the Ancestor had not done so, he must have had his reasons. So, Miao Fei Ping couldn’t rashly intervene either.
