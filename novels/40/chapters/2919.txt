Yang Kai and Yang Tai’s arguing sounded like two flies constantly buzzing in his ears, annoying Gong Yue to no end.

Raising his hand, he summoned several more Array Plates, laying down several layers of Spirit Arrays to protect himself so no matter where Yang Kai was attacking from, he was bound to get caught by one of them.

“Very good!” Yang Tai laughed, shouting tauntingly into the void, “This Old Master acknowledges that you have some skill, but that’s all! If you want to live, then it’s not too late for you to escape now. Otherwise, I’m afraid it’ll be too late.”

He was really afraid of all the strange Secret Techniques Yang Kai had as they felt as if they were created solely to restrain him. So, he could want nothing more than for Yang Kai to leave here as soon as possible. As for whether Yang Kai would expose the secret of this place or not after escaping, that wasn’t something he had to consider.

He just needed to get this door open.

There were five people left in here, including him, which was enough for the blood sacrifice. It just needed a little longer to break the array.

But Gong Yue’s face sank when he heard this. Even though he and Yang Tai worked together to set this trap, he had done it for the sake of the Gong Family. There was no intention for any survivors to be left. Yang Tai was also one of the targets he intended to kill, so how could he allow Yang Kai to escape alone?

As his thoughts turned, he asked, “Little brother, you say there are Demons sealed behind that door, but what proof do you have? Yang Tai told me that the ultimate secrets of the Martial Dao were inside there.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted as he spoke, “Do you really believe that? If you do, then you’re a fool.”

Gong Yue raised his voice, “I have peered into the mysteries of that word, and it tells me that Yang Tai isn’t lying!”

“What you saw was an Ancient Demon Race character! You’ve been deceived!”

“What?” Gong Yue’s face changed, “A Demon Race character?”

Under shock, a crack began to appear in his layers of Spirit Arrays.

It was at that moment that Yang Kai suddenly appeared. Nobody could see clearly how he re-emerged, but by the time they saw him, he was already standing a metre in front of Gong Yue.

The look of panic on Gong Yue’s face disappeared in an instant, and there was a shrewd glow in his eyes. Everything he said just now was obviously just an act to lure Yang Kai out.

And Yang Kai really showed up. Gong Yue smiled coldly as he instantly prepared to activate all the Array Plates by his side to their maximum to drag Yang Kai into one of them. He wouldn’t take it lightly again this time, and decided that even if he had to split his attention, he would actively deal with Yang Kai before handling other matters.

At that moment, a small, ancient-looking bell appeared in Yang Kai’s hand that began to spin and swell up into a massive object.

An ancient and desolate aura filled the air while Yang Kai shivered, seemingly on the verge of collapse; however, the hand that was holding onto the small bell was steady as a rock.

*Guang dang…*

When the bell tolled, everyone felt their eardrums shaking, dizzying them for a moment. The layers of Spirit Arrays that Gong Yue arranged around himself were all shattered by the ring of this bell before they could activate, collapsing all at once.

Not only that, but being struck by such a close impact from the Mountains and Rivers Bell, it was as if Gong Yue had been struck by lightning, his mind going blank for a moment before his chest caved in and a large bulge formed on his back. In the next instant, he flew out like a rag sack and smashed into a nearby wall before sliding down miserably.

He had a Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, so it was reasonable to say that he shouldn’t have suffered so badly from this strike, but thinking he had already won, Gong Yue had left himself completely defenceless, allowing this fierce blow from the Mountains and Rivers bell to hurt him severely.

The toll of the bell raged through Gong Yue’s body and his meridians, making it so he couldn’t even breathe.

The Six Points One Centre Array, having lost its host, collapsed, causing Hua Yu Lu and the others who were suspended mid-air to fall down like dumplings, all of them letting out cries of surprise.

They were all Emperor Realm Masters, but they were completely disoriented on the ground now, just like babies who had not yet learned to walk, they couldn’t get back up after falling down, and they all looked miserable.

Most of the power of the Mountains and Rivers Bell’s attack was borne by Gong Yue, but it still affected them a little. Plus, they were under Gong Yue’s control this whole time and lost too much blood, so they were extremely weak to begin with.

Right now, they probably wouldn’t be able to exert a tenth of their full strength.

The only one among them in a better state was Yang Tai. He entered the array later, and even though he lost a lot of blood, he was still far better off than the rest. He only staggered for a moment after landing on the ground before steadying himself.

But the sudden blow still made his mind buzz. Everything had been going well, so he didn’t expect the situation to take such a sharp turn in the blink of an eye. He was standing in place, stunned for a while, before he finally came back to his senses. Eyes filled with incomparable hatred, he turned towards Yang Kai, ground his teeth, and began incoherently muttering, “Why, why, why…”

Murderous thoughts towards Yang Kai filled his entire being before spilling over and enveloping their target.

Yang Kai also staggered. He used up all of his strength in that attack with the Mountains and Rivers Bell and was now just like a lamp running out of oil, even the Emperor Qi in his body was having difficulty circulating. When he saw Yang Tai’s Divine Sense locking onto him though, seemingly as if he was going to immediately lash out, Yang Kai quickly took a deep breath and squeezed out what little remaining power there was in his dantian and began to chant.

Yang Tai was startled and felt as if a bucket of cold water had doused all the anger in him, he even began to cower before Yang Kai, seemingly utterly terrified.

He had already eaten a loss from Yang Kai previously in the Illusion Array and knew the might of these strange Secret Techniques. They were just like his natural enemy, so he became instinctively afraid as soon as he heard the strange incantations again.

Only after falling back a few steps was Yang Tai able to find a sense of security.

Yang Kai also found the right moment to stop chanting. He was currently an arrow at the end of its flight and could no longer exert his power at will. If Yang Tai wasn’t going to move, then he couldn’t be bothered to strike first.

The current situation gave him a headache. There were seven Emperor Realm Masters here, and each one was weaker than the next. Yang Tai was currently in the best condition, so if he really steeled himself to kill, the only thing Yang Kai could do would be to hide in the Sealed World Bead with Hua Yu Lu. As for the others, whether they lived or died was no longer his business.

But Yang Tai was indeed extremely fearful of Yang Kai, and did not dare try anything with him again.

Suddenly, the crimson glow that once filled the cave began fading, catching Yang Tai’s attention. He turned towards the giant blood-coloured door and wailed, “No, this can’t be!”

Before, under the blood sacrifice that Gong Yue presided over, the glow surrounding the giant blood-coloured door was growing brighter and brighter. The ancient seal was even showing signs of opening; however, after the array was broken by Yang Kai, cutting off the blood sacrifice, the glow gradually turned dim, and the ancient barrier stabilized once more.

Yang Tai began to roar, and nobody knew what he thought of, but he suddenly turned around to glare viciously at one of the people in the room. Then, reaching out, he grabbed at him.

“Yang Tai, you dare?!” Wu Kuang Yi shouted angrily at him, but where would he still have the strength to resist? He was lifted up by Yang Tai as easily as lifting up a chicken.

In front of everyone’s eyes, Yang Tai struck Wu Kuang Yi’s body several times before throwing him towards the giant blood-coloured door.

Wu Kuang YI let out a pained scream, but that too came to a sudden halt.

When he hit the giant blood-coloured door, maybe due to the force of the impact, or maybe it was from the strikes Yang Tai delivered to his body, but Wu Kuang Yi suddenly burst into a mist of blood, leaving no bones behind, splashing a crimson mass onto the giant blood-coloured door.

Gradually, the dimming door regained a trace of light.

When they saw this, everyone was aghast. Wu Kuang Yi’s death caused their lips to go numb, and their teeth to go cold. None of them knew who Yang Tai was going to attack next.

“Not enough, not enough! This is far from enough!” But it was as if Yang Tai had gone insane. After killing Wu Kuang Yi with his own hands, there was only a vexed look on his face. He was constantly muttering under his breath as his eyes swept over the remaining people.

At the same time, a faint black Qi began appearing from his body. Naturally, it was the Demon Qi that Yang Kai was familiar with.

As the others instinctually averted their gazes at this sight, fearing that they would draw unwanted attention to themselves, Yang Kai stared at Yang Tai with cold eyes, sneering, “Give it up, Yang Tai. Your plan won’t work anymore. There’s no way you can break this seal now. You’re already completely transforming into a Demon, and your death isn’t even worth pitying!”

On the other side, Gong Yue, who had been wounded by Yang Kai, finally managed to gather himself and was staring dumbfounded at the Demon Qi surrounding Yang Tai. Lifting his finger, he pointed forward and haltingly stuttered with a trembling voice, “You, you…”

He finally saw the truth. With the trace of Demon Qi on Yang Tai’s body being so obvious, how could Gong Yue not understand now?

It was only at this point that he believed what Yang Kai said earlier.

Yang Tai had really been demonised, and if that was the case, then Yang Tai’s promise wasn’t worth a wooden coin anymore…

At that thought, Gong Yue’s heart felt ashen. He had risked everything in order to join Yang Tai in this villainous plot, but he never expected it to be a scam right from the beginning. He had no idea what Yang Tai’s aims were here, but he knew there were definitely no secrets to the Martial Dao that he was promised behind that door.

“Give up?” Yang Tai did not notice Gong Yue at all as he yelled hysterically, “My mission isn’t even complete yet, how could I possibly give up!?”

Yang Kai keenly grasped a clue and frowned, “Mission? Your mission is to break that seal? Is whatever behind that door giving you orders? Did it communicate with you?”

Yang Tai hurriedly shut his mouth, seemingly realizing that he had said too much. Sweeping his eyes across everyone present, he then sneered, “Wastes, nothing but wastes! Even if all your blood is sacrificed, it will still be far from enough!”

Truthfully, it would have been enough if Yang Kai had not interrupted the blood sacrifice; however, after it was interrupted, all progress was lost.

Yang Tai had gone completely crazy and he quickly spread his arms wide, as if to embrace the whole world, and for the first time, the Demon Qi around his body grew dense, dark, and turbulent. Just the sight alone was enough to send one trembling in fear. “Open your dog eyes wide and take a good look! The new era is coming! You are all ants before the coming tide!”

He shouted nonsensically before letting out a maniacal laugh and turning towards the giant blood-coloured door, running towards it.

Yang Kai’s eyes bulged as everyone else who was watching was dumbfounded by this scene. Nobody would have expected such a dramatic turn of events.

It seemed as if Yang Tai wanted to use his own body as a blood sacrifice to break the ancient seal.

Nobody tried to stop him. For one, it was Yang Tai’s malicious intentions that dragged everyone into this mess to begin with, so his death was indeed not worth pitying. Secondly, Wu Kuang Yi was just killed by Yang Tai and used as a blood sacrifice, however that wound up being mostly ineffective. Even if Yang Tai sacrificed himself now, it was likely no miracles would happen.

So, everyone just stood by and watched coldly.
