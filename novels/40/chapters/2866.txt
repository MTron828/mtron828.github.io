In the sky over the crude city of the Ancient Barbarian Race, a pure black Qi flashed like lightning, breaking through its many defences and rushing past the perimeter in the blink of an eye.

Alarmed, the Demons in the city gathered from all directions. They appeared nearby one after another, staring at the two figures shrouded in black Qi with vigilance and fear.

One of them had a graceful figure and vigorous aura. She was definitely a Demon King.

This caused the other Demons around to not dare to simply approach them.

Sha Ya looked around and let out a burst of silver bell-like laughter, mixed with an innate charm that nobody could guard against.

Many of the Demons present quickly retreated and kept a distance from her. They obviously knew of the horror of the Charm Demon Clan. Only those Demon Great Generals with high strength dared to remain in place, but all of them were exerting significant effort to maintain their sobriety.

Yang Kai kept silent behind Sha Ya, barely attracting anyone’s attention.

“Slut, how dare you invade this King’s territory!” A thunderous voice suddenly came from the palace in the centre of the city. At the same time, a blood-red light suddenly shot out from inside and arrived in front of Sha Ya soon after, dispersing to reveal a lofty figure like an iron tower.

Grasping Sha Ya’s neck, this newcomer lifted her up directly, a ferocious smile on his face and murderous intent filling the air.

Sha Ya did not struggle and instead just stared at him quietly without the slightest hint of panic, as if she had expected this.

“Do you want to die?” Bao Qi stared coldly at Sha Ya.

“Killing a Demon King… without authorization… the Demon Saints… will not forgive such an act.” Sha Ya’s face was slightly pale, and it took quite an effort for her to utter these words. They were both Demon Kings, but in front of Bao Qi, she could not put up any meaningful resistance at all. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Bao Qi snorted coldly, “Only my people are here, so who would know if I killed you? The Demon Saints are recuperating now, so they will not have time to care about you.”

Sha Ya snickered and spat, “Then kill me.”

Bao Qi’s eyes became menacing, but he still held back and tossed Sha Ya away.

Sha Ya coughed violently for a while when she landed on the ground before slowly recovering her breath and looking up as she declared, “Bao Qi, I’m not here to have a conflict with you, but rather to discuss something.”

“I have nothing to discuss with you. Scram quickly, otherwise don’t blame me for really killing you.” Bao Qi snorted coldly.

Sha Ya smiled, moving her red lips, as if she was saying something but having no sound leave her mouth.

Bao Qi was stunned and looked at Sha Ya in surprise, “You really are nothing but a bitch!” He despised her openly.

Sha Ya ignored the insult and continued softly, “I’m just a Charm Demon, and it’s not easy for me to deal with the foreign race. Only by working with you can I hope to survive. For this, I’m willing to pay any price.”

Bao Qi sneered, “And that’s why I despise you.”

Sha Ya pressed on, “You are not the only one who looks down on me, but I only care whether you agree to my proposal or not.”

Bao Qi pondered for a moment, then nodded, “Since you already understand this, what is there to be afraid of?” While musing he licked his lips, obscene light flashing across his eyes, “I haven’t played with a Demon King Realm Charm Demon before.”

Sha Ya giggled and walked forward with her hips swaying, “Then you’ll have a whole new experience tonight.”

Bao Qi laughed, reached out his hand to grab Sha Ya’s waist, and slapped her ample bottom.

Sha Ya blushed shyly and whispered sweetly, “Not now… There are so many people here.”

Bao Qi commented scornfully, “You’re afraid of an audience?”

Even so, he grabbed Sha Ya and flew towards the palace with her.

The two were as incompatible as water and fire earlier, but were now mutually attracted in just the blink of an eye, which seemed a little unreasonable.

Yang Kai followed them without saying a word.

In the palace, Bao Qi let go of Sha Ya, looked back at Yang Kai, and snorted coldly, “Where did you catch this slave?”

He could see that Yang Kai was not a true Demon, but rather a demonized foreign race. Although there was Demon Qi on his body’s surface, the foreign aura underneath could not be concealed.

Sha Ya smiled as she replied, “This little boy was too overconfident and led his people to attack me, so I taught him a lesson he’ll never forget. Don’t mind him.”

Bao Qi continued sarcastically, “Weren’t you worried about people watching earlier? Aren’t you concerned he will be watching now?”

“He’s not a person, he’s a slave.”

Bao Qi no longer objected and instead stretched out his hand to tear off Sha Ya’s clothes rudely and violently. In an instant, her snow-white and alluring figure was exposed, displaying all kinds of enchanting beauty.

Sha Ya moaned softly, as if blaming Bao Qi for his barbarism, but her beautiful eyes were full of seduction, completely drawing him into her allurement.

She wrapped herself around Bao Qi’s burly body like a spirit snake, pressing her full peaks against his chest.

Following a sneer, Bao Qi grabbed Sha Ya’s seemingly boneless body tightly with one hand as if trying to meld her into his chest, while his other hand began to roam around freely.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly took a step forward.

This unusual action alerted Bao Qi, and he looked up at Yang Kai.

The first thing he saw was a golden light in the foreigner’s left eye. This vertical pupil was filled with majesty, as if it had a Soul swallowing power, causing Bao Qi to fall into a daze for a moment.

“Bitch!” Bao Qi yelled.

He never really expected that Sha Ya would join hands with him, but given that his strength was superior to hers and this was his territory, he thought that he only stood to gain by accepting such a delicious beauty, so he decided to play along for now.

He also believed that Sha Ya was incapable of harming him. The Charm Technique of a Charm Demon was indeed difficult to guard against, but as a powerful Demon King, he definitely possessed enough resistance to such attacks.

The reason he grabbed Sha Ya by the neck in the first place was to deny her the chance to execute any kind of scheme. As long as Sha Ya dared to show any improper attempt, he could just snap her head off.

Nevertheless, he never thought that the one to sneak attack him would not be Sha Ya, but the slave she brought!

He somewhat could sense the strength of the slave and knew he was only as strong as a High-Rank Demon Great General, so Bao Qi had not paid any attention to him.

But at this moment, Bao Qi was actually caught off guard by this Demon Great General’s move. In his anger, he pushed his Demon Qi wildly and attempted to kill Sha Ya directly. He could not afford to worry about orders or possible punishment from the Demon Saints at such a dangerous moment.

Sha Ya was obviously terrified.

Yang Kai’s attack did not just catch Bao Qi off guard, Sha Ya was surprised by his timing too. According to her thoughts, the best opportunity to make a move would be during a climax when she made love with Bao Qi.

Men’s vigilance would be greatly reduced at such a moment.

Yang Kai’s sudden move was so unexpected that she had no time to prepare or even respond. She felt the rampaging Demon Qi in Bao Qi’s body and instinctually let out an ear-deafening screech, causing Bao Qi to fall into a daze again after taking her Soul attack.

The next moment, Bao Qi suddenly saw a lotus bud appear before his eyes, and as it began to blossom, a sharp pain filled his head.

The surging Demon Qi immediately dispersed, and before Bao Qi even had time to yell, he felt himself oddly floating. When he regained control of his body, he was no longer in the familiar palace, but found himself in some inexplicable place.

His arms were empty, with Sha Ya having re-appeared a short distance away. At this moment, her pale face was full of lingering fear.

Yang Kai stood nearby, holding his hands behind his back while observing Bao Qi quietly.

“Sir, why did you…” Sha Ya looked at Yang Kai with dissatisfaction, but soon she remembered her identity and continued politely, “If you wanted to act so, it would have been better to inform me in advance.”

“It’s just dealing with a trivial Mid-Rank Demon King, why would I need to tell you beforehand?” Yang Kai glanced faintly at her.

Sha Ya did not dare to say anything. She thought to herself that if she had not escaped in time, she would have been killed by Bao Qi.

But she was still shocked because back then, she was dragged into this strange world by Yang Kai only after he pierced her Demon Heart and badly wounded her, making her unable to defend herself.

Although this world was strange and unfathomable, she guessed that Yang Kai could not simply drag anybody into it at will. There must be some conditions or some price to pay to do so; otherwise, he would be invincible in this world. But if he was invincible, why would he still bother cultivating?

Bao Qi was much stronger than her, so Sha Ya did not understand how Yang Kai had managed to drag him into this world with seemingly less effort than it took for him to capture her.

However, Sha Ya was relieved by the current situation. Since Bao Qi entered this world, his life was no longer his to control anymore. Thinking so, Sha Ya revealed a smile that came from the bottom of her heart.

“Slut, how dare you plot against me!?” Bao Qi did not panic, but examined the world calmly while looking at Sha Ya coldly.

Sha Ya replied with a smile, “Who told you to act so carelessly?”

She then turned to look at Yang Kai and continued, “Sir, let me kill him.”

“Sir?” Bao Qi narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Sha Ya contemptuously, “You actually call a mere Demon Great General ranked trash ‘Sir’? What ability does he have to stand above us Demon Kings? Sha Ya, you really are a disgrace.”

Sha Ya smiled, “You can’t imagine the power of Sir.”

Bao Qi shook his head, “You don’t deserve the status of Demon King!”

Although his face was calm, Bao Qi was actually shocked in his heart. Previously, he thought that Sha Ya was the Master while this foreigner was the servant, but it now seemed things were opposite to his expectations. He wondered what kind of tricks this Demon Great General possessed that allowed him to subdue a Demon King.

But upon further thought, Bao Qi realized that this foreigner’s ability really was mysterious. He failed to guard himself against the two Soul Secret Techniques of this scrawny man and was then dragged into this damned place by him.

“Put on your clothes first,” Yang Kai glanced at Sha Ya.

“Yes!” Sha Ya obeyed his order and quickly took out a brand-new set of clothes. Although much of her skin was still showing even after getting dressed, it was much better than her being completely naked.

Yang Kai then turned to Bao Qi and continued, “You probably know what’s going on now, so I’ll make things simple. There are only two choices in front of you.”

Saying so, Yang Kai raised a finger and pointed at Sha Ya, “Submit to me like she did, or die.”
