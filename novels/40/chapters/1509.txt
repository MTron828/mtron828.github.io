Chapter 1509, Heaven Battling City

When he cultivated Soul Fission, Yang Kai understood that he would be able to create a physical, sentient clone of himself as long as he found a suitable host body for his Soul Clone, one he could send into places that were inconvenient for his true body to go, and do things that were inconvenient for his true body to do.

An example of this was Yang Yan; she was the Great Emperor’s Soul Clone.

Great Demon God was only a Saint King, but he was a true genius that managed to create the Soul Fission Secret Technique that was on par with the Starry Sky Great Emperor’s own Secret Technique. It wasn’t difficult to understand how Great Demon God became a legendary figure whose name lasted through the ages.

The golden Stone Puppet had no sentience, but it had an incredibly powerful physical body, so wasn’t it the most suitable carrier possible?

Yang Kai stroked his chin as he stared at the golden Stone Puppet, silently contemplating this issue.

After a long silence, Yang Kai decided to give it a try. He didn’t know if he could succeed, but it was better than simply leaving the golden Stone Puppet in a brain-dead state.

Ordering Xiao Xiao to stand guard nearby, Yang Kai sat down cross-legged in front of the golden Stone Puppet and released a tidal wave of Spiritual Energy, soon after which a fuzzy figure suddenly shot out of his forehead.

This figure was somewhat illusory and unstable, but if one looked closely, they would find that it was somewhat similar to Yang Kai in appearance.

Naturally, it was the Soul Clone Yang Kai had cultivated inside Knowledge Sea all these years.

The Soul Clone then rushed into the golden Stone Puppet’s forehead and disappeared.

.....

Inside High Heaven Sect’s grand discussion hall, all the Sect’s Origin Returning Realm masters had gathered, headed by Great Elder Ye Xi Yun. Wu Yi and Qian Yue were also present as they held important administrative positions.

Not only that, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu also sat here.

The hall was all but silent, with cups of tea placed in front of everyone that were frequently replaced by attending disciples when they became cold.

“Where did Sect Master go? Why haven’t we seen him for over a month? We sent some disciples to check up on him but he doesn’t seem to be in First Heavenly Palace either,” Chang Qi turned to Ye Xi Yun and asked with some worry, “Great Elder, do you know where Sect Master is now?”

“He’s still inside the Sect, but this Queen doesn’t know where exactly he’s gone. He seems to be cultivating some kind of Secret Technique, and a powerful one at that, so this Queen doesn’t dare to disturb him. We’ll just have to wait,” Ye Xi Yun replied lightly.

With her powerful cultivation, she had sensed the abnormal movements coming from one of the farther mountain peaks a few days ago, so she was able to determine Yang Kai’s location, but it was also true that he seemed to be immersed in cultivating some kind of Secret Technique, so she had no plans to spy on him.

“I’m certain Sect Master will return shortly. Before he left though, he already discussed the details of our upcoming action with this Queen and I feel there are no issues with the plan. En, all the Elders gathered here will be accompanying us while Deacons Wu Yi and Qian Yue will be left to take care of the Sect.”

“Yes,” Wu Yi and Qian Yue nodded.

“Elder Huang Juan is in the process of breaking through, so you must also look after her to make sure no one disturbs her retreat. Also, that little girl Yun’er has far too much energy, once this Queen leaves, she may not be willing to settle down. The two of you will have to make sure she cultivates properly.”

“Great Elder may rest assured, Elder Sister Qian Yue and I will take care of everything in the Sect, it is all of you who must promise to return safely,” Wu Yi said in a solemn tone.

“En, with the Starship Madam previously refined, I think there shouldn’t be any difficulty with this time’s action. Right, have all the necessary personnel and materials been loaded onto the Starship?”

“Everything is in order!”

“Very good,” Ye Xi Yun nodded lightly before turning to look at Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, “I’ll have to ask two Junior Brothers to contribute this time as well.”

“Senior Sister Ye is too polite,” Qian Tong chuckled, “Old Fei and I were caught after being sneak attacked last time. If not for Yang Kai turning the tables and rescuing us, we would both likely have been killed to silence any witnesses to that incident! This time, both of us are duty-bound to assist.”

Fei Zhi Tu also nodded in agreement. If Fang Peng and Qu Zheng hadn’t used such insidious means that day, how could he have fallen into his current pitiful state? Not only had his hair gone grey, but his cultivation had also fallen by a Minor realm. Whenever Fei Zhi Tu thought about this, his anger burned fiercely.

“Hm? Sect Master is back,” Ye Xi Yun’s expression suddenly changed as she glanced towards the entrance to the hall.

Hearing this, the others also turned around to look.

Sure enough, a moment later, a streak of light flew over from afar, and when it scattered, Yang Kai’s figure appeared. Although he seemed slightly tired, his eyes were bursting with radiant energy.

“Has Sect Master had some kind of opportunity?” Ye Xi Yun seemed to have noticed something.

“That’s right,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, not explaining anything, his eyes instead sweeping around the hall before he asked solemnly, “Has everything been prepared?”

“Yes!”

“Then let us depart!” Yang Kai smiled brilliantly.

With these words, everyone rose from their seats and walked out.

In the square outside, the Origin King Grade Starship had already docked and its hatch was wide open. A group of people filed inside and, a moment later, the Starship lifted off and then shot out like a bolt of lightning, accompanied by a low hum, disappearing from view in the blink of an eye.

.....

Heaven Battling City was enormous and covered a very wide area with tens of millions of cultivators living inside, tending to and frequenting a great number of shops and other establishments.

This was the headquarters of Heaven Battling Union. As one of the two giants of Shadowed Star, Heaven Battling Union’s illustrious name was enough to attract countless cultivators from far and wide.

Some of these cultivators hoped to join Heaven Battling Union while others were searching for opportunities. Still others came to set up shops in order to earn Saint Crystals.

Heaven Battling City was one of the largest cities on Shadowed Star and was divided into two regions, the Inner City and the Outer City.

The Outer City was where Heaven Battling Union interacted with foreign cultivators. Various shops were also scattered about here. As for the Inner City, only disciples of Heaven Battling Union could enter and exit. Intruders were killed without mercy.

Heaven Battling City had existed on Shadowed Star for thousands of years and had only grown more prosperous with time. This was inseparable from the rising strength of Heaven Battling Union. Every great force had its ebbs and flows, and Heaven Battling Union was no exception. Although its name resounded like thunder, it too had its enemies.

Over the past few thousand years, Heaven Battling City had suffered numerous attacks from powerful enemies, but every time, it had endured. Even when Heaven Battling Union was at its weakest, and the number of masters that it had at its command was at its lowest, it had still managed to survive.

The most dangerous of these events was when the Ancient Yang Sect launched a full-scale assault a few thousand years ago.

At that time, in addition to Heaven Battling Union and Thunder Typhoon Sect on Shadowed Star, the Ancient Yang Sect was also on the same level, even somewhat stronger than the other two. It had long been forgotten why, but at that time, the Ancient Yang Sect and Heaven Battling Union were locked in a feud which one day erupted into a full-scale conflict.

At that time, Heaven Battling Union was the weakest of the three great forces, and had the least number of masters, so it had no choice but to pull all its forces back and defend.

The Ancient Yang Sect deployed all of its elites, and when its grand army reached the gates of Heaven Battling City, Heaven Battling Union was at great risk of falling.

However, after a great battle, although Heaven Battling Union suffered heavy losses, it managed to repel the Ancient Yang Sect by employing a strategy of mutual annihilation. In desperation, the Ancient Yang Sect could only retreat.

At that time, Heaven Battling Union relied on its Myriad Ice Spirit Sealing Grand Array to stubbornly defend its Inner City.

Ordinarily, Sects did not set up their headquarters inside cities, most of them choosing to occupy vast mountain ranges instead; after all, with so many people living inside a city, there would be an excess demand on the ambient World Energy that was not conducive to the cultivation of the Sect’s disciples.

It was rumoured that the reason Heaven Battling Union chose to establish its headquarters in Heaven Battling City was because there was a Frozen Jade Ice Spring in the Inner City. The endless chill which radiated from this Frozen Jade Ice Spring was what allowed Heaven Battling Union to arrange the Myriad Ice Spirit Sealing Grand Array and it also served as its Array Core.

After that battle, the Myriad Ice Spirit Sealing Grand Array became famous, known to all across Shadowed Star.

Later, the Ancient Yang Sect offended Star Emperor Mountain and was wiped out; its original headquarters becoming the now famous Grand Burial Valley.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan had visited that place once and obtained the Sun’s True Essence and Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal, two supreme treasures. The Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art was also obtained from there.

Without the suppression of the Ancient Yang Sect, Heaven Battling Union flourished, otherwise, it was uncertain whether there would even be a Heaven Battling Union today. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Originally, as one of the two giants of Shadowed Star, Heaven Battling Union did not put anyone in its eyes and acted in a blatantly superciliously fashion.

But since two months ago, some rumours had begun spreading through the Outer City.

The rumours said that Heaven Battling Union had offended someone they couldn’t afford to and was now in a horrendous situation, akin to walking on thin ice.

When this news spread, nine out of ten people sneered.

Who could Heaven Battling Union offend that would warrant them worrying? It would be enough for others to not come looking for trouble with them instead, who would dare pluck this tiger’s beard? Besides Star Emperor Mountain, no other force could suppress Heaven Battling Union. Not even Thunder Typhoon Sect had such ability.

However, where there was smoke there was fire, and it wasn’t long before Heaven Battling Union began contracting its forces and limiting traffic in and out of Heaven Battling City, causing much speculation to arise among the common people.

Heaven Battling Union had been a dominant force for countless years and always acted arrogantly and domineeringly. Many Sect families that had been unwilling to submit to their authority had been destroyed in retaliation.

Many even began to wonder if Heaven Battling Union had actually offended Star Emperor Mountain and was going to follow in the footsteps of the Ancient Yang Sect.

If that was the case, it would be quite interesting at least.

In any case, the atmosphere in the city had become different from the past. Heaven Battling Union disciples were constantly rushing about, buying up materials in bulk, as if they were making war preparations.

At this moment, two First-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators were flying slowly over the city, both of them wearing Heaven Battling Union uniforms. However, unlike the ordinary disciples, these two had an additional overlapping sword crest on their uniforms and were radiating a potent murderous intent.

Law Enforcers!

Heaven Battling City was a massive city, so naturally, there was a need for some law enforcers to patrol and monitor people’s movements. If anyone was found to be violating the rules and making trouble, they would be punished by the Law Enforcers.

A minor offence would often result in a Saint Crystal fine while a serious offence could result in execution.

As a result, the cultivators in Heaven Battling City were always wary of cultivators wearing this particular uniform and were always cautious to not draw their attention.

At this moment, the two Law Enforcers both had concerned looks upon their faces.

“Brother Huang, do you know what happened? Since Union Master and Great Elder returned last time, they have been constantly issuing inexplicable instructions, and now they are even making the Sect’s disciples buy up supplies like crazy. Could it be that Heaven Battling Union is really going to war?” The short-haired man on the left asked suspiciously.
