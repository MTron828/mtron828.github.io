Chapter 1433, Divine Nullification Stone

It wasn’t surprising that Yang Kai couldn’t recognize this material though. Although Yang Kai had travelled widely over the years and could be considered well-informed, he still could not identify all of the strange materials in this world.

However, since Yang Yan had deemed to disturb him at such a critical time for this piece of ore, its value was certainly not trivial and was also very likely of great use to him somehow.

Otherwise, Yang Yan would not have acted so.

Sweeping this ore with his Divine Sense though, Yang Kai still couldn’t see anything extraordinary about it, as if it was nothing more than an ordinary stone.

“Try pouring your Saint Qi into it!” Yang Yan prompted.

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate, stretching out his hand to touch the ore and pouring out his Saint Qi, but in the next instant, his expression changed dramatically and he quickly withdrew his hand, calling out in alarm, “It absorbed my Saint Qi?”

This was not Yang Kai simply raising a fuss, this ore was simply that strange. When he poured his Saint Qi into it, it was as if he was pouring water into a bottomless sea, causing no reaction at all. It was like this ore could endlessly absorb his Saint Qi.

This kind of situation was one he had never encountered before.

This piece of ore was truly amazing!

“What is this?” Yang Kai suddenly became interested and raised his head to ask.

“Divine Nullification Stone!”

“Divine Nullification Stone?” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed. He had never heard of such a thing before. Even Ye Xi Yun, who was standing behind Yang Yan, frowned, obviously hearing about it for the first time as well.

“What use does it have?”

“Didn’t you see just now?” Yang Yan smiled softly, “Nullifying Saint Qi is the most important property of Divine Nullification Stone. It is a genuine Origin King Grade Artifact Refining material as well, so what do you think would happen if you were to fight an opponent using an artifact refined from this?”

Hearing her explanation, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. If this was the case, then an artifact refined from Divine Nullification Stone could instantly destroy any kind of Martial Skill, because Martial Skills were condensed from a cultivator’s Saint Qi, which this Divine Nullification Stone could essentially erase before it even had a chance to do any damage.

“Yup, this really is a treasure,” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, and since it was an Origin King Grade Artifact Refining material, any artifact refined from it would also be Origin King Grade. This grade of artifact on Shadowed Star was incredibly rare. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Bone Incinerating Flame Lamp in Ye Xi Yun’s hands was an Origin King Grade artifact that was famous across all of Shadowed Star for instance.

After offering his sincere evaluation, Yang Kai’s brow suddenly furrowed again as he asked, “But what does this have to do with me?”

He didn’t believe Yang Yan had called him out just to show off this piece of Origin King Grade Artifact Refining material! After all, Yang Yan wasn’t bored to such an extent. There had to be another purpose to all this.

“This Divine Nullification Stone really has nothing to do with you, but the things inside of it are very useful to you!” Yang Yan smiled meaningfully.

“There’s something inside of it?” Yang Kai looked surprised.

“En, Divine Nullification Stone is a very special ore that can absorb and nullify all forms of energy, even the ambient World Energy aura. This piece of Divine Nullification Stone was given to us by a mid-scale family. According to their Patriarch, it was obtained by one of their ancestors in an Ancient Ruin several thousand years ago, so from this, it can be deduced that this ore definitely has a very long history.”

“Why would a mid-sized family deliver us this kind of treasure?” Yang Kai was even more confused.

“Didn’t you say you wanted to sell a few entry spots to the Emperor Garden? Now, all the great forces outside are struggling to obtain as many quotas to enter the Emperor Garden as possible. The fighting has been intense; even we need another Emperor Jade. This Divine Nullification Stone was the bargaining chip that a family offered!”

“So that’s how it is, it seems the people from that family aren’t very knowledgeable,” Yang Kai grinned, taking pleasure in others’ misfortune. An Origin King Grade material was far too precious on the Shadowed Star, so Yang Kai believed the other party did not understand just how valuable this ore was otherwise they wouldn’t have offered it to them.

“You’re wrong,” Yang Yan, however, shook her head, “Although that Fang Family is now in decline and doesn’t possess any kind of great strength at the moment, it had a number of powerful masters a few thousand years ago, so although they might not have been able to positively identify this Divine Nullification Stone, they would at least understand that it is an Origin King Grade material.”

Yang Kai frowned and hesitantly asked, “Then why...”

“It’s precisely because they know that it is Origin King Grade material that they decided to take out this Divine Nullification Stone to impress us. Do you think something worthless can snatch one of my High Heaven Sect’s departure spots from Shadowed Star’s countless forces?” Yang Yan smiled, “That Fang Family’s luck was good as they managed to obtain a single Emperor Jade, but their strongest master has only reached the Second-Order Origin Realm. If they want to have any hope of obtaining something good in the Emperor Garden, they can only try to win one of the early departure spots from us wholeheartedly.”

Yang Kai gently nodded, revealing a look of understanding.

An Origin King Grade material was indeed worth a fortune, but even if it was incredibly precious, compared to the temptation of entering the Emperor Garden in advance, it was still inferior because on all of Shadowed Star, no one could refine Origin King Grade materials. In other words, this Divine Nullification Stone was a very expensive but useless treasure to that family.

Since they had no way to make use of it, using it as a bargaining chip to win one of the departure spots from High Heaven Sect was a better idea.

Their luck was indeed good, bumping into someone as knowledgeable as Yang Yan. If it was someone else, they wouldn’t have been able to realize the value of this Divine Nullification Stone instantly.

After obtaining a lot of Saint Crystals and this Divine Nullification Stone from that small family, High Heaven Sect agreed to sell them one of the departure spots. Now, all they needed to do was wait for the Emperor Garden to open and they could set out from High Heaven Sect’s territory.

“What did you mean when you said the things inside this are of great use to me?” Yang Kai asked.

“Even if you didn’t ask, I would tell you. Otherwise, why do you think I would call you out here? Weren’t you looking for a supreme Earth Attribute treasure?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, a look of joy appearing on his face in the next instant, calling out in surprise, “You’re saying...”

“Exactly!” Yang Yan smiled, “Although the Divine Nullification Stone itself is not of the Earth Attribute, the Divine Nullification Sand inside it undoubtedly is a supreme Earth Attribute treasure, one that can meet your requirements!”

“Divine Nullification Sand!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

“After the Divine Nullification Stone swallows World Energy for a very long time, it will begin generating Divine Nullification Sand particles inside it. As for the Divine Nullification Stone itself, it has no use to you, but I can use it to refine some good artifacts instead.”

“Amazing!” Yang Kai grinned and rejoiced.

He had been looking for a supreme Earth Attribute treasure in order to cultivate the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art. This Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art was a Body Tempering Secret Art he found in the Ancient Yang Sect’s ruins, and according to the descriptions recorded inside it, if one cultivated it to the extreme, they would obtain an immortal and indestructible physique.

Yang Kai had anxiously wanted to cultivate it for some time now.

Unfortunately, the requirements to begin cultivating this Body Tempering Art were extremely high. Not only did one need to already possess a much higher physical strength than average, but they also needed a powerful Soul and supreme treasures from each of the five elements.

Regarding these supreme treasures, Yang Kai already possessed a Thunder Wood, Sun’s True Essence, Profound Yin Sunflower Water, and Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade.

At the last auction of Treasure Trove Pavilion, he had obtained a Profound Gold, a Gold Attribute supreme treasure. It was also for this reason he had gotten into a dispute with Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng. From that point, Yang Kai only needed to find an Earth Attribute supreme treasure.

If this Divine Nullification Sand was as Yang Yan said it was, then Yang Kai would now have supreme treasures from all five elements and he could immediately begin to cultivate the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art!

The benefits of a strong physique were self-evident. Without even mentioning the advantage it brought when confronting enemies, if Yang Kai’s body wasn’t so powerful, every time he tore space and crossed thousands of kilometres in an instant, he would be shredded by the turbulence present in The Void.

As Yang Kai’s comprehension of the Dao of Space and his use of Space Force became more profound, the requirements of his physical body also became greater, so when he understood what the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art truly was, he was naturally ecstatic and immediately set about collecting the required materials.

In his excitement, Yang Kai hurriedly said, “What are you waiting for, hurry up and extract that Divine Nullification Sand!”

Yang Yan couldn’t help sneering at him when she heard this, “Do you think it’s so easy to take out? The Divine Nullification Stone can absorb and disperse all forms of energy, even I can’t refine it with my current abilities.”

“Uh...” Yang Kai’s expression stiffened for a moment, as if a pot of cold water had been dumped on his head, all his previous excitement and joy instantly vanishing.

Seeing this, Yang Yan giggled happily.

“You’re messing with me, aren’t you?” Yang Kai was furious. Seeing Yang Yan like this, how could he not know she had a solution to this problem? If she really couldn’t extract the Divine Nullification Sand, why would she have called him over?

“You didn’t let me finish speaking,” Yang Yan said smugly but no longer acted mysterious, her expression becoming serious as she explained, “While it’s true I don’t have the ability to refine this Divine Nullification Stone right now and extract the Divine Nullification Sand inside, he does!”

Saying so, Yang Yan pointed to the Stone Puppet sitting on the table.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up with understanding!

When one was too close to the solution, they often overlooked it. Yang Kai had forgotten about the Stone Puppet’s innate ability to devour the mineral essence of any kind of ore. While Divine Nullification Stone was indeed a very high grade of material, it certainly couldn’t resist the Stone Puppet.

After all, even the Thousand Illusion Coloured Glass Mountain was easily bitten into by the Stone Puppet, so how could this trivial Divine Nullification Stone be any different?

“However, I should warn you first, although Divine Nullification Sand will definitely form inside Divine Nullification Stone, the amount of Divine Nullification Sand will vary greatly depending on how old this Divine Nullification Stone is. Perhaps there will only be two or three grains inside that meet your requirements, or perhaps there will be dozens, it’ll be up to you to evaluate that, which is why I asked Qian Yue to call you out.”

Yang Kai frowned, what Yang Yan said just now he naturally understood. The longer they age, the more Divine Nullification Sand grains there would be, this was simply the way things were.

After hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “How long will it take for a grain of sand to form?”

“Hehe, the formation of this kind of thing is calculated in the thousands of years. If you’re thinking of waiting in order to increase your chances, I am afraid you’ll have to wait for a very long time!”

“Then I might as well extract them now!” Yang Kai’s look became firm as he turned to the Stone Puppet and gave it a command.
