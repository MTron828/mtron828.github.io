Chapter 5459: Earnest Persuasion

Yang Kai glanced at the third person, “What about you?”

That man raised his head and replied, “We have a similar experience with Golden Light Temple. After the Ancestor was taken away, Golden Antelope Paradise would deliver various cultivation resources to the Sect every year. Furthermore, Golden Antelope Paradise Masters would come to guide the Sect’s disciples in their cultivation at regular intervals over the years.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and continued questioning several others who were called out by Jiu Yan earlier.

The great forces that these people came from could generally be divided into two categories. One type did not experience any changes, while the other type received extra care from Golden Antelope Paradise. Not only were they bestowed with Secret Techniques and Secret Arts after their Ancestors, Elders, or Seniors were taken away, but they would also receive various cultivation resources every year. These cultivation resources made things much more convenient for the disciples of these great forces to cultivate.

The great forces that received extra care had always kept their special treatment a secret, lest they attract the jealousy and hatred of the other great forces, which was why nobody was aware that they were not the only great force to receive the favour of Golden Antelope Paradise.

Nevertheless, the fact that Yang Kai was questioning them regarding these matters at this time clearly indicated that there was a deeper meaning behind the situation.

“Do you know why Golden Antelope Paradise treats your great forces so differently?”

Everyone fell silent. Some seemed pensive, but they did not dare to voice their opinions arbitrarily; after all, there was a chance of saying the wrong thing. Who would dare to speak nonsense in the presence of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?

Regardless, Yang Kai had no intention of waiting for a response from them and promptly answered his own question, “Every one of you lives in the 3,000 Worlds. Although there are some disagreements and the occasional fight between the many great forces, these are nothing more than minor disputes, quarrels involving grievances and grudges over various issues. But there is a vast battlefield in a distant place that remains unknown to most of the world; moreover, that battlefield is the site of an ancient and ongoing war involving the very survival of the Human Race!”

Everyone aboard the ship couldn’t help feeling surprised.

Hearing the words ‘survival of the Human Race’ from the mouth of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, anybody would immediately realise the seriousness of the situation; however, just what kind of battlefield would involve such high stakes? Not to mention, he also used the word ‘war’… and not the word ‘battle’.

Fan Nan couldn’t help exclaiming in shock, “Ancestor Yang… this…”

Yang Kai raised a hand to interrupt Fan Nan, “You’re already planning to bring them there in the first place. Under the current circumstances, they will surely resist if we don’t explain the situation to them clearly. Besides, what’s the difference between learning the truth now and a few days from now?”

Fan Nan thought about it and realised that Yang Kai was right. The Cave Heavens and Paradises had restricted the information regarding Black Ink Strength in the past because they were afraid that some people would not be able to resist its temptation. However, the current situation in the Barren Territory was so dire that the Cave Heavens and Paradises were forced to recruit Fifth and Sixth-Order Masters from the Second Class great forces for support. If these people were sent to that battlefield, then the existence of the Black Ink Clan and all that entailed would soon be revealed anyway.

After this realization, he did not object again.

“You might think that I’m simply trying to frighten you, but this King would like to ask one question. Over the years, have you never wondered why the heritage of the Cave Heavens and Paradises is so feeble despite having an inheritance that spans hundreds of millennia? True, compared to the Second Class great forces, the Cave Heavens and Paradises are unshakeable behemoths; nevertheless, where are all the Sixth, Seventh, and even Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters that they nurtured over the aeons? It is impossible for all of them to just remain in secluded retreat inside their Sects.”

These doubts had plagued Yang Kai himself before, so he did not believe that these people had never wondered about it.

Compared to their long years of inheritance, the strength the Cave Heavens and Paradises showed to the 3,000 Worlds was far too weak.

“Open Heaven Realm Masters have incredibly long lives, and anyone who breaks through directly to the Fifth Order has hope to advance to the Seventh Order. Among the disciples of the Cave Heavens and Paradises, the number who advance directly to the Fifth Order can be counted in the hundreds per century. Over the years, they should have accumulated so many Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters that meeting one would be considered common. At the very least, there should be several tens of thousands of them per First Class great force, but have you ever seen so many Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in any of the Cave Heavens or Paradises?

“Simply put, those Seventh-Order Masters are not in the Cave Heavens or Paradises as most of them have been dispatched to that far-off battlefield! They have been fighting an enemy that you know nothing about for hundreds of thousands of years, and the vast majority of them have died in battle as a result.”

“There are also no Ninth-Order Masters in the 3,000 Worlds because any Eighth-Order Ancestor who has the qualifications to break through to the Ninth-Order is sent to that battlefield as well to fight our enemies!”

“The Cave Heavens and Paradises have played a pivotal role in maintaining the safety and tranquillity of the 3,000 Worlds. The peace you all enjoy is built upon countless generations of blood and sacrifice.”

“This… is the truth you have never been told.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yang Kai’s speech caused the expressions of Yan Yi and the others to change greatly. They seemed doubtful, but it was easy to understand their feelings. If Yang Kai himself had been in their position, he would also have had trouble believing something so shocking without witnessing the tragic situation on the Black Ink Battlefield with his own eyes.

The Cave Heavens and Paradises that they silently resent and hate turned out to be the guardians of the vast universe known as the 3,000 Worlds. Moreover, it was only thanks to the silent efforts of the Cave Heavens and Paradises behind the scenes that their Great Territories could remain so prosperous. That completely overturned their understanding of the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

Yan Yi of Golden Light Temple mustered his courage to ask a question, “Senior, who is the enemy that the Cave Heavens and Paradises are fighting?”

“The Black Ink Clan!”

They were of course confused by the answer.

Yang Kai explained, “For countless years, the Cave Heavens and Paradises have restricted information regarding the Black Ink Clan, so it is only natural that you have never heard of them. All you need to know is that they are an enemy who are bent on completely annihilating the Human Race! 200 years ago, they broke through the first line of defence that the Cave Heavens and Paradises were guarding and are currently ravaging the second line of defence located in a place known as the Barren Territory which lies just beyond the Shattered Heaven. That is also the final line of defence for the Human Race. The Black Ink Clan breaking through the Barren Territory means the Cave Heavens and Paradises have ceased to exist, and the 3,000 Worlds will be no more. Naturally, none of you will survive either.”

Jiu Yan, who was being restrained by Yang Kai, seemed rather unconvinced. It might be that he realised Yang Kai’s temperament was mild and not prone to violence; hence, he boldly protested, “That’s just empty words coming from you. How will we know the truth?”

Yang Kai turned to look at Jiu Yan.

Jiu Yan’s expression immediately changed drastically, and he hastily averted his gaze.

On the other hand, Yang Kai abruptly raised his hand and a stream of Black Ink Strength suddenly wrapped around Jiu Yan.

Jiu Yan nearly died of fright, thinking that Yang Kai was trying to kill him, but to his surprise, he did not show any signs of injury when the Black Ink Strength wrapped around him. Nevertheless, his expression soon changed.

“That is the power of the Black Ink Clan. Black Ink Strength is extremely invasive. Once contaminated by the Black Ink Strength, it will not take long for you to become completely corrupted by it. Then, you will be reduced to a Black Ink Disciple whose loyalty is sworn only to the Black Ink Clan!”

While Yang Kai was speaking, Jiu Yan had already noticed that something was wrong. The others might not understand the dangers he was facing, but how could he remain ignorant when he could personally feel the malevolence of Black Ink Strength? It was just as Yang Kai had said. Wrapped in that pitch-black energy, he could feel his entire body and mind being corrupted by it.

“Senior, mercy! I was wrong!” Jiu Yan panicked in fear.

Yang Kai ignored Jiu Yan outright and continued leisurely, “When one’s Small Universe is invaded by Black Ink Strength, a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master can protect themselves by sacrificing a part of their Small Universe. Unfortunately, those below the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm have no such option. Once a person is completely corrupted by Black Ink Strength, they will be transformed into a Black Ink Disciple. Although nothing about their outward appearance changes, their hearts are completely warped and they become slaves who worship the Black Ink Clan above all else!”

“S-Senior…” Jiu Yan cried in horror. It had not been long since he advanced to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm so his foundation was unstable and his Small Universe was still weak. How could he resist the invasion of Black Ink Strength? In the time it took for Yang Kai to speak a few sentences, he discovered that 10% of his Small Universe had already been corrupted.

Although Yang Kai had mentioned that he could sacrifice a part of his Small Universe to protect himself, how could he bring himself to do something so drastic? If he were to do that, then he would surely regress to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. More importantly, he would never be able to advance to the Seventh Order again.

“Countless Open Heaven Realm Masters have been corrupted by Black Ink Strength on that battlefield. Converted to serve the Black Ink Clan instead, they turned their blades upon their former comrades! Have you ever experienced the pain and helplessness of having to kill your loved ones on the battlefield?”

Witnessing Jiu Yan’s suffering and listening to Yang Kai’s explanation, the people on the ship felt their blood run cold in fear.

Even the two Sixth-Order Masters from Golden Antelope Paradise, Fan Nan and Xi Yuan, shuddered at those words. Although they knew about the Black Ink Clan to a certain extent, they had never stepped foot on the Black Ink Battlefield. It was only natural that they were ignorant about the cruelty of the situation there.

At the same time, Yan Yi and the others finally understood why Yang Kai had claimed that the Black Ink Clan was an enemy that could destroy the entire Human Race. This Black Ink Strength… was simply too evil!

Even a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was having such a difficult time trying to resist the Black Ink Strength, so what need be said about Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order cultivators like themselves? Wouldn’t they be doomed the moment they were contaminated by Black Ink Strength?

A low roar escaped from Jiu Yan’s throat, making him seem like an injured beast. Wisps of the Black Ink Strength slowly seeped out of his body, and darkness flickered in the depths of his eyes from time to time.

Yang Kai raised a hand and tapped Jiu Yan on the chest.

Jiu Yan involuntarily opened his mouth, and a Purifying Black Ink Pill was tossed into it.

“Carefully refine that pill,” Yang Kai commanded.

Jiu Yan seemed to wake up from his nightmare and hurriedly sat down cross-legged to refine the medicinal efficacies of the Purifying Black Ink Pill.

Yang Kai turned back to Yan Yi and the others, “The Cave Heavens and Paradises have protected the 3,000 Worlds for hundreds of thousands of years. They have been doing so since their Sects were first established. Over the years, innumerable outstanding disciples have lost their lives on that battlefield. Even the Ninth-Order Old Ancestors are no exception. Every one of them is a hero!”

“Restricting the information regarding Black Ink Strength is a necessity. Be that as it may, those from the Second Class great forces who advanced to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm must also bear some of the burden in this war. Among the people who were taken away, those who are willing to fight the Black Ink Clan and protect the Human Race will be sent to the battlefield. As for those who are unwilling to do so, they will simply remain in Golden Antelope Paradise for the rest of their lives!”

The realisation suddenly dawned upon Yan Yi and the others. They finally understood why the treatment from Golden Antelope Paradise was so different even though all of them had the same experience where their Ancestors and Seniors had been taken away.

Those who were willing to enter the Black Ink Battlefield and fight the Black Ink Clan to protect the futures of their descendants would naturally receive better treatment. How could those who were too cowardly to fight the enemy and simply chose to remain in Golden Antelope Paradise for the rest of their lives receive any kind of support? It was only natural that Golden Antelope Paradise would not give such people any special treatment.

Yan Yi suddenly recalled that Yang Kai had pointed at him and claimed that the special treatment Golden Light Temple received was obtained in exchange for the Former Temple Master’s life. He had misunderstood the meaning behind those words earlier, but he now understood clearly.

“Originally… these matters would not have fallen upon your shoulders. Unfortunately, the situation on the battlefield has changed greatly over the past few hundred years. We are in the middle of a war for the survival of the Human Race. That is why we need your support on the frontlines! The Human Race will be able to rest easy if we win this battle. But, if we lose…” Yang Kai sighed softly. If they lost the battle, then the 3,000 Worlds would be engulfed in the flames of war. At that point, how many people would be able to survive?

Yan Yi felt his blood boiling and immediately shouted, “Golden Light Temple is willing to fight to the death for the Human Race!”
