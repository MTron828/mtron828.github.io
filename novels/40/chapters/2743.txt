The changes in Spirit Lake Palace and Maplewood City were new and fresh to Yang Kai, who was curiously surveying the two mutually coordinating twin cities at the moment. There was a look of astonishment in his eyes, because no matter where he looked, there were tides of people walking shoulder to shoulder in either city.

Yang Kai could feel how prosperous the two cities were despite being more than a thousand kilometres away from them.

It seemed like Maplewood City really had changed, and it made him wonder how the Qin Family was doing right now. Back then, the Qin family was still considered a pretty large power in Maplewood City, even having a Dao Source Realm cultivator assuming command. But in the current situation, Dao Source Realm was clearly nothing to brag about.

Yang Kai’s Myriads Sword came from the Qin Family, and he had an agreement with Qin Zhao Yang that he would return it to Qin Yu whenever she ascended to the Emperor Realm.

The Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation that he imparted to the disciples of Ice Heart Valley was also one of the Qin Family’s secret inheritances.

It could be said that although Yang Kai did not receive much direct help from the Qin Family along his path, he owed them many favours. Naturally, he had to go and visit them on this trip back to Maplewood City.

There was also Ruo Xi’s family that he should visit, and since he was back in the Southern Territory, Yang Kai also had to pay a visit to the Azure Sun Temple. No matter what, he was an In-Name Disciple of Azure Sun Temple, and even had one of their Core Disciple tokens.

Yang Kai also remembered the request Senior Tian Yan had made to him, and now that he had found the Flesh Incarnation Fruit and several adjuvant herbs to go along with it, he could refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill. Then, Yang Kai would be able to get Tian Yan out of the Divine Ascension Mirror and help him mould a physical body.

Tian Yan was a Great Emperor-level existence, so once he possessed his own physical body and was able to walk around the Star Boundary, High Heaven Palace would gain a great patron in the future.

Just as Yang Kai was planning out his trip, a stream of light suddenly shot over from the front at great speed.

Immediately after that, another cluster of lights appeared. Several figures could faintly be seen inside those streams.

From the looks of it, this seems to be a chase; however, the stream at the front was only one person while there was a whole group behind him. All of these people were emitting Dao Source Realm auras, but Yang Kai didn’t concern himself with this incident.

This kind of thing could often be seen in the Star Boundary. Whether it be due to benefits or grudges, numerous people were killed each day. Even Yang Kai himself had been chased who knows how many times in the process of his growth, surviving each time to reach his current height.

The fleeing light seemed to be in a panic and was rushing straight over to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, not knowing whether the other party was trying to drag him into their misfortune, but he couldn’t be bothered to involve himself in something like this. Without even changing direction, he greeted the stream of light head-on.

Since all these people were merely Dao Source Realm cultivators, he had no need to give way.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai had arrived a thousand metres away from the lead stream of light.

After taking a closer look though, Yang Kai could faintly see some curves in the figure hidden inside the light, indicating it was a woman. When he saw her face though, he couldn’t help exclaiming in surprise and stopping.

The woman in front clearly noticed Yang Kai as well, and her beautiful eyes were stunned at first before changing to pleasant surprise immediately after, “Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai smiled, “Fate really does bring us together often, Protector Bian. I trust you’ve been well since we last met?”

This woman actually turned out to be a familiar face: Blue Feather Sect’s Protector, Bian Yu Qing.

When he and Liu Xian Yun first arrived in the Star Boundary, they were caught by Blue Feather Sect’s Kou Wu and later ended up taking refuge under Bian Yu Qing. They stayed in Blue Feather Sect for some time until the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s descendant, Wu Meng Chuan, escaped from prison and went on a killing spree, giving the pair a chance to escape.

Bian Yu Qing, on the other hand, happened to be out on business at the time, escaping Wu Meng Chuan’s ruthless hands. She later joined his ranks as his subordinate to do his bidding.

After that, the two of them bumped into each other again outside the Four Seasons Realm.

Thinking about it that way, the reason why Wu Meng Chuan was able to enter the Shattered Star Sea was that Bian Yu Qing obtained a Star Seal from the Four Seasons Realm. The reason she went to the Four Seasons Realm with Kou Wu last time was likely Wu Meng Chuan’s orders to find a Star Seal.

Unfortunately for Wu Meng Chuan, Yang Kai had turned the tables on him when he tried to act against him in the Shattered Star Sea, ultimately resulting in Wu Meng Chuan’s death while allowing the Heaven Devouring Battle Law that his Embodiment cultivated to be perfect.

It seemed that all these causes and consequences were predetermined from the very first day Yang Kai entered the Blue Feather Sect.

As all these thoughts flashed past Yang Kai’s mind, Bian Yu Qing had already arrived in front of Yang Kai and gritted her teeth, “How come it’s you?!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Kai grinned, “Protector Bian seems quite disappointed to see me.”

Bian Yu Qing responded, “I thought I could throw my troubles onto someone else, but since it’s you… This is not the place to speak, let’s escape first.”

She actually admitted her purpose of flying over quite readily, which took Yang Kai by surprise, and even as she spoke, she had already flown past Yang Kai.

When she flew out and did not see any movements from Yang Kai though, she quickly stopped again and urged him, “Quickly run! What are you waiting for?”

Yang Kai remained as still as a mountain though and stared at the sword wound on Bian Yu Qing’s abdomen, frowning, “What grievances do you have with those people? Why are they trying to kill you?”

“Has a donkey kicked you in the head? You still have the heart to ask me this?!” Bian Yu Qing was already feeling anxious, and now Yang Kai was just standing there without moving, which looked no different to her than courting death.

She knew that Yang Kai was a cultivator from the lower Star Fields and had outstanding cultivation that improved at a rapid rate, but how many years had it been since she last saw him? She did not think Yang Kai could grow even stronger than her in terms of cultivation already. She was no match for her pursuers, so how could Yang Kai best them?

While they were speaking, the clusters of lights had already closed to a distance of three kilometres and a stern voice shouted out to them, “Bitch, stop right there! Hand over the Entry Token and we’ll spare your life!”

“Entry Token? What Entry Token? Did you rob someone?” Yang Kai frowned. If that were true, then Bian Yu Qing was just asking for trouble.

“Who robbed them!? They’re the ones trying to rob me!” Bian Yu Qing quickly explained, “Are you coming or not? If not then you’re on your own! They’ll definitely kill you!”

Even though her tone was harsh, she was more or less thinking for Yang Kai’s sake, which changed Yang Kai’s impression of her a little.

Speaking of which, he and Bian Yu Qing did not have any real grudges with each other. He once caused trouble in the Blue Feather Sect, and it was Bian Yu Qing who helped speak for his sake. In the end, he was punished by being made to enter retreat at that Ice Cliff to repent, which turned out to be more of an opportunity than a punishment.

“If you want to go, then go,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Suit yourself!” Bian Yu Qing turned around and quickly flew off.

But after a short flight, she suddenly turned around and flew back, landing next to Yang Kai again.

“Not running anymore?” Yang Kai looked at her curiously.

Bian Yu Qing’s face was dark as she fumed, “You’re going to be the death of me! I really don’t know what’s going on in that head of yours!”

Yang Kai asked curiously, “Protector Bian, does this mean you’re planning to share life or death with me? Doesn’t sound too bad, we can be a pair of fated mandarin ducks under the yellow spring!”

“In your dreams!” Bian Yu Qing glared at him, her expression cold, “Hold down the others for a bit, I want to kill that man.”

“What grudge do you have with him?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“Kou Wu died at his hand!” Bian Yu Qing’s voice was cold to the bones and her fists were clenched tight.

“Kou Wu is dead?” Yang Kai was shocked, and his face quickly turned serious. Even though it was Kou Wu who captured Liu Xian Yun and him and brought them to the Blue Feather Sect, he still took care of them as their Senior Brother at the time.

Kou Wu was also with Bian Yu Qing when they happened to meet each other at the Four Seasons Realm, but now he actually died. Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a little sad. The slightest mistake on the path of the Martial Dao could very well lead to a torn body and crushed bones.

“He helped me delay them for a short while,” Bian Yu Qing took a deep breath and quickly said, “If you still feel any shred of brotherhood with me, then help me out this once.”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded.

Bian Yu Qing went on, “Those people are all Third-Order Dao Source Realms. You can’t best them, so if things go awry… Just run and leave me behind.”

Yang Kai looked at her as it felt like he was truly getting to know her for the first time.

Bian Yu Qing smiled, “Don’t look at me like that. The Blue Feather Sect is gone, so Kou Wu and I depended on each other for survival. Now that he’s dead, I should at least avenge him.”

“You’ll get your wish,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“I hope so,” Bian Yu Qing exhaled lightly, shutting her beautiful eyes for a moment before opening them in a flash of cold light. A bracelet-like artifact appeared in the palm of her hand at the same time.

While the two of them were speaking, the cluster of lights had already grown close, and when the light receded, it revealed the figures of three people.

All three of them had Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivations, and from the clothes they wore, they seemed to be from the same Sect, but Yang Kai was not able to recognize which Sect these cultivators came from.

The one at the front was a fair-faced and beardless man who looked to be about forty. He was holding a sharp sword in his hand which was still stained with blood.

As soon as Bian Yu Qing saw the blood, her eyes instantly turned red.

She knew that it was definitely Kou Wu’s blood.

“Slut, try and run again!” The middle-aged man pointed his sword at her and shouted with a fierce look in his eyes.

Bian Yu Qing gritted her teeth and said nothing.

The middle-aged man continued shouting, “Hand over the Entry Token and we’ll let you live!”

“Were you the one who killed my fellow disciple?” Bian Yu Qing didn’t respond but interrogated instead.

The middle-aged man admitted freely, “That’s right, I’m the one who killed him. My sword pierced straight through his heart and granted him a quick death! He was very loyal to you, sacrificing his own life just so you could escape.”

Bian Yu Qing’s face was ice-cold as she suppressed the anger in her heart, her teeth already drawing blood from her lips as her body trembled and she said, “I’ll make sure to give you a quick death after this as well!”

At these words, the three men threw their heads back in laughter.

The middle-aged man glanced at Yang Kai from the corner of his eye, saying disdainfully, “I don’t know where you found this little helper, but to think you still dared to boast so shamelessly! Hey brat, I’d run as far away as possible if I were you, a pretty woman may be tempting, but you’ll need your life to be able to enjoy her!”

He obviously thought that Yang Kai had become smitten with Bian Yu Qing’s beauty and was trying to play the part of a hero. That being said, Bian Yu Qing’s looks were indeed not bad, especially the mature charm she exuded. It was something that a young and fresh girl wouldn’t be able to compare to.

Many men at Yang Kai’s age had a taste for such delicacies.

“Sorry, but I can’t do that,” Yang Kai smiled.

The middle-aged man’s face darkened and he coldly snorted, “Since you’re courting death, then don’t blame my fellow brothers for being ruthless!”

They had long investigated Bian Yu Qing and found out everything about her origins and her identity. She was just a Sectless woman without any kind of backing. If that weren’t the case, they wouldn’t have dared to have any thoughts about Bian Yu Qing, much less try to snatch away her Entry Token.
