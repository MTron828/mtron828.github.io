If the Star City was a goose that laid golden eggs, the auction house and Asura Arena would be the biggest and heaviest eggs.

The auction house was independently operated by Void Land, and no one else could intervene at all. It was the one and only auction house in the entire Void Star City, and Void Land was still not satisfied and wanted to intervene in the Asura Arena too? This was an extraordinarily large appetite.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Is it that big? I don’t think so. Old Zhou is a sensible person. My Void Star City has only been established for a trivial few months, yet it has already become so popular and is far from reaching its peak. One can imagine what the future will be like. Millions of cultivators will flow through this city regularly, and Asura Cave Heaven building an Asura Arena in my Star City would be equivalent to planting a tree that grows leaves of money here. Void Land will provide you with the venue, free of rent, free of tax, for just a 30% share of the profits. This deal is more than fair!”

Manager Zhou frowned as he spoke, “Sect Master Yang, Asura Arena is one of the most important industries of my Asura Cave Heaven, and there is no room for any mistakes. Can you change the conditions?”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, “Old Zhou, don’t tell me that no other great force takes a share of the Asura Arena’s profits in other cities! As far as I know, Great Battle Heaven takes a significant share of the profits earned by the Asura Arena in Thousand Birds Star City, yes? Why is it that Great Battle Heaven is cut in but my Void Land isn’t? Is it because my Void Land is not good enough for Asura Cave Heaven?”

Old Zhou hurriedly answered, “Sect Master Yang is too serious. This Old Master never said as such!” Although he was a Manager from Asura Cave Heaven and also a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he did not dare to be offensive in the slightest inside Void Land. This was the place where hundreds of Open Heaven Realm Masters recently died, and with two mature Divine Spirits keeping watch, who dared to underestimate Void Land?

No other Second Class great force could make someone like Manager Zhou set his pride aside like this.

After pondering for a while, Old Zhou offered, “Sect Master Yang is right, many other great forces do share profits of the Asura Arenas, but no one has ever taken 30%. Even Great Battle Heaven only gets 20% of the profits from the Asura Arena in Thousand Birds Star City. How about this, this Old Master will offer Void Land 10%, does that sound good?”

“30%, nothing less!” Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

Old Zhou smiled bitterly, “Sect Master Yang, such a price is unreasonable. 30% is really non-negotiable.”

Yang Kai flicked off imaginary dust on his clothes and smiled, “I only intend to allow Asura Cave Heaven to establish an Asura Arena in this Star City because the name of Asura Arena is well known, making it convenient for advertisement. But even without the Asura Arena, I can well build a similar venue on my own in this Star City, with a similar name, like Blood Arena, what do you think?”

Old Zhou’s face twitched slightly, completely speechless.

Then again, if Yang Kai really planned to build a ‘Blood Arena’ and completely cut out Asura Cave Heaven, there was really nothing they could do.

Asura Cave Heaven was one of the 36 Cave Heavens, so the existence or loss of a single Asura Arena did not matter much to the Master Sect, but it meant a great deal to Manager Zhou, who was just a trivial Manager. The matter could bring him a lot of benefits, so it was not something he could just ignore.

After a while of careful consideration, Manager Zhou spoke, “30% is really too much. This Old Master can’t make such a decision on his own and will need to consult his superiors. But if Sect Master Yang can agree to another condition, this Old Master can guarantee that the Master Sect will agree to this proposal.”

“Another condition?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows slightly.

Manager Zhou smiled, “This is the second matter this Old Master is here to discuss with Sect Master Yang.”

Yang Kai gestured for him to continue.

Manager Zhou coughed lightly, “I heard that your noble Sect has auctioned two Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills in recent months. I was wondering if that was true or not?”

Yang Kai knew that this old guy was really here for the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, so his expression remained unchanged as he snickered silently to himself. After waiting for such a long time, it seemed things were finally getting started.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “Good, Void Land did auction two Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills!”

Manager Zhou’s expression brightened, “And, it was said that the Void Auction House will host an auction every three months from now on, where a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill will be auctioned.”

“Correct!”

Manager Zhou’s eyes sparkled a little as he asked, “So, does that mean that your noble Sect is capable of refining this lost ancient pill? Could it be that your noble Sect has found a source of World Source Liquid?”

When he asked the question, Qu Hua Shang, who had been silent all the time, also had her beautiful eyes flash as she stared eagerly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled without answering.

Manager Zhou continued, “Before the Blood Monster Cave Heaven opened, Red Clouds Auction House once auctioned a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill and the recipe for this pill. As far as I know, those items were won by Sect Master Yang, but the Spirit Pill was exchanged for a Seventh-Order Primordial Yang Profound Ginseng with an Elder from Sword Pavilion, while the pill recipe was left… But according to the recipe, World Source Liquid was required to refine this Spirit Pill, and World Source Liquid has long since disappeared from the 3,000 Worlds. Now that Void Land is able to take out a Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill every three months for auction, it could only mean that Void Land had found a way to obtain World Source Liquid. There is no other explanation for why so many rare Spirit Pills could be auctioned.”

The extinction of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill was because of the extinction of World Source Liquid. It was a treasure that was formed by chance when a new World was born. Where could it be found now?

This situation was inevitable, and Yang Kai had already expected this would happen when he decided to use the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill to help bolster the popularity of his Star City.

Taking a sip of his tea, Yang Kai smiled, “Blood Monster Divine Monarch left many good things behind inside the Blood Monster Divine Palace, including some World Source Liquid.”

Manager Zhou looked at him hesitantly, not sure if he should believe him. However, obviously, the timing fit. Yang Kai obtained the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill and its pill recipe before the Blood Monster Cave Heaven opened, and the Spirit Pill was only first auctioned in the Star City after the Blood Monster Cave Heaven collapsed. It was entirely possible that Yang Kai really got World Source Liquid from Blood Monster Cave Heaven.

Yang Kai moved the conversation forward with a smile, “Does Asura Cave Heaven also need this Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill?”

Manager Zhou replied, “Who wouldn’t want such a Spirit Pill? I’m afraid that many from the Cave Heavens and Paradises have quietly entered Void Star City, waiting for the next auction. Don’t tell me that you, Sect Master Yang, are unaware of this.”

It did not matter for the other Cave Heavens and Paradises whether they snuck in or announced their presence, but it was different for Asura Cave Heaven. If they really wanted to build an Asura Arena here, they would have to show up sooner or later. The Asura Arena was a symbol of Asura Cave Heaven, and that was the reason Manager Zhou visited Yang Kai.

However, he had no idea what Yang Kai’s impression towards the Cave Heavens and Paradises were after the previous battle, so he asked Qu Hua Shang to help bring him in.

Just in case that he got rejected by Yang Kai after notifying him of his visit. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Kai put down the tea cup and asked bluntly, “How many does Asura Cave Heaven need?”

Manager Zhou chuckled, “The more the better, of course.”

Yang Kai burst out laughing, “Does Old Zhou think that the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills are cabbages? If I hadn’t needed financial resources for Void Land and needed to build up my Star City, I would never have sold a single Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill to the public. These are very rare, and I don’t have much World Source Liquid on hand, so it will run out from refining some of these Spirit Pills.”

Manager Zhou nodded in reply, “This Old Master understands that. How about this? If Sect Master Yang sells 10 of these Spirit Pills to Asura Cave Heaven, this Old Master will guarantee Sect Master Yang’s request regarding the Asura Arena is granted!”

“10? Manager Zhou sure does know how to open his mouth wide!” Yang Kai’s face stiffened.

Manager Zhou chuckled heartily, “We will never take advantage of Void Land, we will offer 8 million for each Spirit Pill. What do you say?”

Yang Kai nodded, “The price is very fair, but 10 is really too many, Void Land doesn’t have such a quantity.”

The look on Yang Kai’s face showed Manager Zhou that he was probably pushing a little too hard; of course, if he knew that Yang Kai had given Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills to people trying to advance to the Second-Order Open Heaven Realm, he would have coughed up ten mouthfuls of blood and died on the spot. These extremely coveted Spirit Pills really weren’t treated much differently than cabbages in Void Land.

“If 10 is too many, 8 will do, no fewer.”

“3 pieces max!”

Manager Zhou was a little speechless, “3 is just too few, Sect Master Yang is too stingy!”

Yang Kai replied sternly, “I’m not stingy, I really can’t come up with more.”

Manager Zhou urged further, “… How about 5?”

Yang Kai tapped the armrest of the chair lightly and pondered for a long time before he spoke, “Since Manager Zhou has made a proposition, allow me to make a counter-offer. If Manager Zhou can agree to this condition, I don’t even want the 30% share from the Asura Arena. Not only that, I will also give you the 5 Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills free of charge!”

Manager Zhou’s face became excited at the words, “What is it that Sect Master Yang wants?”

...

Yang Kai raised a finger, “A High-Rank Yin Element treasure!”

The excitement on Manager Zhou’s face was immediately replaced by bitterness, as he muttered embarrassedly, “Sect Master Yang, aren’t you intentionally making things difficult?”

Yang Kai replied, “Asura Cave Heaven runs many industries and has existed for eons, a single High-Rank Yin Element treasure is surely just a drop in the bucket for you. How is asking for one making things difficult?”

“Sect Master Yang should know that what this Old Master referred to was not the value of this High-Rank material.” Manager Zhou replied exasperatedly. After a pause, he continued, “Since Ancient Times, despite the 36 Cave Heavens and 72 Paradises having occasional disputes, we have always been generally united, especially regarding certain sensitive issues. Now that Void Land is guarded by two Divine Spirits, I’m afraid no one would be interested in provoking it anymore, but that doesn’t mean that some people will condone Sect Master Yang’s direct advancement to the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm. If they really find out that we, Asura Cave Heaven, provided you with a High-Rank Yin Element treasure, how will Asura Cave Heaven keep its foothold in the 3,000 Worlds in the future?”

Having said this, he persuaded earnestly again, “Sect Master Yang is truly a dragon amongst men, but you should take a step back and endure for a while. Why bother taking the risk of challenging the Ancient order of the 3,000 Worlds? With Sect Master Yang’s aptitude, even if you achieve the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, you will still be able to soar. It’s better to follow the current than swim against the river.”

Yang Kai snorted at the words, “Whose order? What current? I, Yang Kai, entered this vast universe only concerned about my own cultivation. I have never sought trouble with or offended others intentionally, so I will not allow others to stand in the way of my Grand Dao!”
