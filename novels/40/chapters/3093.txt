It was said that money made the world go round. As the Head Manager of the Fierce Gale Pirates, He Yun Xiang had a lot of precious things with her.

After taking the Space Ring, the guard scanned it with his Divine Sense and arched his brow, “Madam, since you’re so insistent, I’ll inform the Patriarch about it. Whether or not he’ll meet you…”

He Yun Xiang replied with a smile, “That’s fine. Just help me inform him about my visit.” She didn’t want to make things difficult for a mere guard.

The person turned around and dashed up the mountain at full speed.

“Madam, please have a seat.” Perhaps the other guards knew that they were eligible to share the benefits in that Space Ring, so they treated He Yun Xiang politely. One of them even took out a chair and placed it in front of her.

He Yun Xiang thanked him, but she shook her head with a smile, because she wouldn’t dare to take a seat in front of Yang Kai.

A moment later, the guard, who had gone up the mountain earlier, came down hurriedly and stood before He Yun Xiang, “Madam, our Patriarch is currently cultivating in seclusion, so I’m sorry to disappoint you.” Then, he told her something else with a smile, “However, the Second Elder, who is on duty now, is willing to meet you.”

“The Second Elder? You mean Elder Yan Qing?” He Yun Xiang was apparently familiar with all the Elders of the Yan Family.

“That’s right.”

Although He Yun Xiang didn’t make an appointment before her visit, in the end, she was an Origin King; moreover, she was a Master in the Second-Order Origin King Realm at the very least, on top of being a beautiful lady. Upon learning about her visit, Yan Qing thought it was inappropriate to simply force her to leave, and he wanted to meet her out of curiosity.

The Yan Family controlled several Cultivation Stars not only by relying on the power of their own clansmen, but also the many Masters who worked for them from other clans. If they could recruit this beautiful woman, she would be a great help to the Yan Family.

“Please follow me.” The guard stepped aside and gestured politely.

He Yun Xiang nodded and thanked him. At this point, she couldn’t possibly insist on meeting the Patriarch, so she decided to meet Yan Qing first.

“This…” Seeing that Yang Kai wanted to tag along, the guard frowned. Not everyone had the right to ascend the Yan Family’s twin summits. Although the young man had followed the beautiful woman to this place, he was obviously an ordinary mortal who had never cultivated before, so obviously he lacked such qualifications.

“He’s with me. Please allow him to come along as well.” He Yun Xiang flashed a gentle smile at him.

The guard frowned but stopped making things difficult for them. After a nod, he led the way for them. It was said that rules were inflexible, but Humans were adaptable. Since he had benefited from her already, he didn’t want to harp on such a trivial issue.

Then, the three of them trekked up the mountain. They came across many cultivators with powerful cultivations along the way, but when the men saw He Yun Xiang, they couldn’t contain their urges as they brazenly sized her up.

He Yun Xiang wasn’t used to such stares so throughout the long walk, her brow remained knitted together as she was gripped by a sense of fury. When she pretended to be a man in the past, things were simpler as she could kill whoever she wanted, and she had never been stared at like this before.

Fortunately, the further up they went, the fewer people there were, and in just an incense stick worth of time, they reached a grand palace.

The guard uttered, “Madam, please go in. Second Elder is waiting for you inside.”

As he spoke, he took a look at Yang Kai in shock. He was in the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, while the Madam was an Origin King Realm Master, so the pace at which they walked was quite quick. However, he didn’t expect that this young man could follow them closely, but he couldn’t sense him using any Qi at all. [What is going on?]

He Yun Xiang thanked him again and stepped into the palace. The main hall was spacious with sculpted columns dotting around the place. An elderly man was sitting in the corner with a cup of aromatic tea in his hand. Seeing that two people were entering the place, he raised his head as his gaze brightened up. [What a charming lady!]

However, when he noticed He Yun Xiang’s aura, he was instantly shocked, [She’s a Third-Order Origin King!]

When the guard informed him of a woman’s visit, he just said that a beautiful woman wanted to see the Patriarch, and her cultivation was quite powerful. She was thought to be in the Second-Order Origin King Realm at the very least. Nevertheless, the guard’s vision wasn’t sharp enough to judge her accurately, so he failed to realize she was a genuine Third-Order Origin King.

Upon that realization, Yan Qing rose from his chair slowly and greeted her with a smile. He wouldn’t have done this if she was just a Second-Order Origin King, but she was a Third-Order Master, equal to him.

He Yun Xiang approached him and bowed elegantly, “Greetings, Elder Yan Qing.”

Yan Qing returned the courtesy as well and flashed a gentle smile at her, “A pleasure to make your acquaintance. May I have your honoured name, Madam?”

After He Yun Xiang introduced herself, Yan Qing’s expression remained calm, but a sense of doubtfulness flashed across his eyes. He didn’t remember any Master called He Yun Xiang in his mind. Moreover, she was a woman. There were hardly any women in the Third-Order Origin King Realm in this Star Field, so where did this woman come from?

Although he was puzzled, he still didn’t directly try to inquire about her background. Since she had personally come here, she must have a request to make. So, he wasn’t worried that he couldn’t find out more about her.

However, it seemed that this woman had just reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm, as she could barely conceal her own aura.

Yang Qing hospitably invited her to take a seat. When he saw Yang Kai sitting down as well, he couldn’t help but frown and think that this brat was mannerless. Nevertheless, before he found out about the relationship between the young man and He Yun Xiang, he wasn’t willing to cause a scene. So, he just ignored him for now.

After he clapped his hands, a maid came over and served tea to them.

During their following conversation, Yan Qing discreetly tried to inquire about He Yun Xiang’s background, but she always tactfully changed the topic, which made him feel displeased. Upon finishing their tea, he asked directly, “Lady He, may I ask what your purpose here is?”

He Yun Xiang stopped smiling and replied in a serious manner, “I’m sorry for coming without an invitation. There’s indeed something I need from the Yan Family. I hope you’ll forgive me.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yan Qing chuckled, “Lady He, please speak freely. My family does have some power in this Star Field, so if there is anything I can help you with, I won’t turn you down.” Certainly, he was just being polite. Nevertheless, if it was just a small favour, he would consider lending her a hand. It would be good to make this woman owe them a favour as that might help them recruit her in the future.

“Elder Yan Qing, you’re too humble. In the entire Star Field, only the Yan Family can help me with this.”

“Lady He, you think too highly of my family.” Yan Qing chuckled good spiritedly, but he had put his guard up at that moment. Judging from what she said, the favour she was here to ask wouldn’t be small. If that was the case, he had to be more careful.

“I want to enter the Ancestral Domain,” He Yun Xiang uttered.

Yan Qing’s laughter stopped abruptly, as though someone had reached out and clenched his neck, and the smile on his face slowly faded. Staring at her, he questioned, “Madam, do you understand what it is you are asking?”

He Yun Xiang forced a smile, “If it were an easy task, I wouldn’t have come here to ask for your help. I know that the Yan Family is probably the only force in this Star Field who knows how to enter the Ancestral Domain. Elder Yan Qing, please assist me.”

With a cold expression, Yan Qing refuted, “Madam, I don’t know where you’ve heard this rumour from, but no one from the Yan Family knows how to enter the Ancestral Domain.”

He was utterly exasperated as he thought that this woman had overestimated her own abilities. She wasn’t a close friend of the Yan Family, and it was the first time they met, so how could she ask for access to the Ancestral Domain? Was she out of her mind?

The way to enter the Ancestral Domain was also a top secret within the Yan Family and only a small number of the highest level members in the family knew a thing or two about it.

“500 years ago, an Old Ancestor from your family…”

Before she could finish her words, Yan Qing swung his long sleeve and rose from his chair, “Madam, you may leave now. I won’t see you off.”

He wasn’t willing to keep talking to her anymore. If her request was something else, he would still discuss it with her even if it was difficult to achieve; however, the method to enter the Ancestral Domain must never be leaked. If it weren’t because she was a Third-Order Origin King Realm, he would have directly taught her a lesson.

He Yun Xiang remained unfazed, however, as she had expected this outcome. After hesitating for only a moment, she continued, “Since there’s something I need from you, naturally I’ve prepared an appropriate compensation for you.”

Yan Qing laughed smugly, “There’s nothing the Yan Family does not possess in this world. What do you think you can… What is this?”

He widened his eyes and stared fixedly at the Spirit Pill in her hand.

The longan-sized Spirit Pill was white and translucent, like a perfect pearl. Nevertheless, the fragrance wafting from the pearl was unfamiliar to Yan Qing. After he took a whiff, he realized that the Saint Qi within his body was surging, which caused him to be astonished.

He was a Third-Order Origin King Realm Master, as well as the Yan Family’s Second Elder, so there was basically no Spirit Pill in this world that he had not seen or heard of before. Nevertheless, he had no idea what this Spirit Pill was.

At first glance, he could tell that this pill was of an unimaginably high quality and grade. As far as he was concerned, there was no Spirit Pill in this world that was comparable to it.

He Yun Xiang went on to say with a smile, “Elder Yan Qing, are you satisfied with this reward?”

Yan Qing’s expression changed as he instinctively felt that the pill in her hand would help him tremendously. Despite his calm temperament, he still couldn’t help but gulp as he stared fixedly at the pill. It was as though he was looking at a naked beauty who was inviting him, which aroused his greed greatly.

There was rarely anything in this world that he lusted after. If he needed anything, his family could get it for him. However, at this moment, he eagerly wanted to know what kind of transformation he would go through after he consumed the pill.

“What kind of Spirit Pill is this?” Yan Qing asked as he no longer appeared arrogant. They really didn’t have this pill in the Yan Family.

“This is a Source Condensing Pill.”

After giving it a thought, Yan Qing shook his head, “I have never heard of it before.”

He Yun Xiang smiled faintly, “There are countless amazing things in this boundless world. Elder Yan Qing, although you’re a worldly man, there are still things you haven’t seen before.”

The pill actually belonged to Yang Kai, so Yan Qing couldn’t possibly have seen it before.

He Yun Xiang was now a Third-Order Origin King, and the next step for her was to ascend to the Dao Source Realm. In that regard, Source Condensing Pills were indispensable as they would speed up the process of transforming her Saint Qi into Source Qi. Yang Kai had given her a few bottles of these pills to use whenever she needed them.

After she took out one of those pills at this moment, she managed to achieve the desired result.

“What are the benefits of this pill?” Yan Qing asked curiously.

He Yun Xiang appeared to be in a dilemma, as though she wasn’t sure if she should tell him about it.

Seeing that, Yan Qing was anxious as he said, “If you’re not willing to say anything, then go back now.”

He knew that she wouldn’t leave this place easily.

As expected, when He Yun Xiang heard what he said, the hesitation on her face disappeared, and she uttered, “It can help you reach a realm that is above the Origin King Realm!”

Yan Qing’s entire body shook as his eyes beamed with a glare.
