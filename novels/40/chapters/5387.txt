“But from the perspective of the later generations, that meant that the Ancients had failed as the Black Ink Clan managed to break out from the Mother Nest and built one Royal City after another, harvested the nearby resources, hatched their Black Ink Nests, bred more soldiers, and expanded the scale of the Black Ink Battlefield.”

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s eyes flashed as she speculated on the vital events of the ancient times.

“In order to fight against the Black Ink Clan, the Ancients must have built the Great Passes. These Passes were created to resist the invasion of the Black Ink Clan. Yes… the appearance of the Cave Heavens and Paradises must also be connected to them. They are likely the founders who created the Cave Heavens and Paradises in the 3,000 Worlds, cultivated various talents, selected the right people, and brought them to the Black Ink Battlefield, a cycle which has continued on till this day.”

While talking, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao vaguely recalled an ancient book she saw in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven once. It was very old, and unlike the other Secret Arts or Secret Books. It was more akin to a journal of sorts, which she came across by accident.

The ancient book mentioned a little bit about the founding of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, which was very consistent with their current speculations.

However, she was not very strong at that time, and there were many ancient characters in that journal that were extremely obscure and difficult to understand. She had no interest in such dusty history back then, so she casually browsed through before placing it back.

These were only her own speculations and no one knew how things turned out during the ancient times unless they could find someone who survived from that era.

However, that period was at least a million years ago, and none of the living Old Ancestors was nearly that old.

After gathering her thoughts, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao said, “We should only be at the outer edge of this Divine Ability Sea now. If even the outer edge is so dangerous, just imagine what it is like inside! Pass the order down, maintain the highest level of alertness as we progress. We cannot get bogged down here before we even locate the Mother Nest.”

“Yes!”

“What about the other Great Passes?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao asked next.

Xiang Shan replied, “Almost all the other Theatres are facing the same situation as ours.”

“It’s that big!?” Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s pupil constricted.

The Black Ink Battlefield was enormous, taking over 100 Great Passes to span it from one side to the other. Now, all the Great Passes were proceeding deeper into the void, searching for the Mother Nest, but the Divine Ability Sea was baring all of their path’s forward.

This meant that the Ancient Great Experts had filled this entire region of the Black Ink Battlefield with Divine Abilities and Spirit Arrays! Such a feat was truly astonishing!

With the heritages of the Cave Heavens and Paradises, they could surely accomplish something similar, but the expenditure of time and resources would surely be beyond astronomical.

“Proceed carefully and report immediately if there are any abnormalities!”

“Yes!” Xiang Shan received her orders and retired respectfully.

After he left, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao murmured, “The Ancients…”

Yang Kai frowned and pondered. He could not help but recall the scene he saw in the Dragon Clan Sacred Treasure. The Crystal Palace seemed to carry with it the memory of ancient times. At that time, he thought it was all quite strange, but now it seemed to be somehow related to the Dragon Clan’s Bloodline Talent.

After all, the Dao of Time was the Bloodline Talent of the Dragon Clan.

Back then, he saw the scene in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land, where two Supreme Masters, the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress of that age, fought against the Black Ink Giant Spirit God. They finally suppressed it and sealed it with the help of the Sacred Treasure of the different Divine Spirit Clans.

Yang Kai naturally did not know how many years ago that battle took place, but from the situation of that battle, the Ancient Great Experts might not have been able to hold back the invading enemy.

When Black Ink Strength invaded the 3,000 Worlds, even a Giant Spirit God had been corrupted by it.

[Right! Black Ink Strength must have invaded the 3,000 Worlds in the past!]

“Was that Royal Lord suppressed and sealed in the Black Prison back then as well?” He exclaimed.

Yang Kai had entered the Black Ink Battlefield through the Black Territory.

It now seemed that the Royal Lord who was suppressed and sealed in the Black Prison had been there much longer than anyone could have imagined.

Such ancient events were no longer traceable, so there was no way to really know what happened so many years ago.

The situation that the Human Race needed to face today was grim.

“But this is also an opportunity,” Yang Kai suddenly chuckled.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao looked at him and asked curiously, “An opportunity?”

Yang Kai said, “If the path ahead is really that hazardous, not many of the Black Ink Clan that escaped will be able to survive. Those that do will clear a path for us.”

During the war to take the Royal Cities, not all the Black Ink Clansmen were killed. In fact, many had escaped, and these Black Ink Clansmen had varying levels of strengths. In the Great Evolution Theatre alone, numerous Territory Lords, Feudal Lords, even weaker Black Ink Clansmen had managed to flee.

With those Black Ink Clansmen fleeing to the rear, it was as good as opening up a path for the Great Evolution Army. Thus, the Great Evolution Army could avoid many unknown dangers.

Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao thought about it and agreed that was indeed the case. She could not help but snicker slightly and suddenly regretted that she had hunted down too many Territory Lords.

If they had let a few more Territory Lords escape, perhaps the path ahead could be more thoroughly cleared for them.

However, under the circumstances, after the death of Mo Zhao and the Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple, as someone in the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, she was unchecked on the battlefield. Thus, naturally she wanted to kill ruthlessly.

As Xiang Shan said, some of the residual Divine Abilities were very obvious and could be seen at a glance, while others were hidden and would only flare up on contact.

The scout Squads experienced a lot of hardships because of this. Thankfully after so many years, the power of many of these residual Divine Ability restrictions had degraded. Under the protection of the Warships, there were no casualties.

Even inside Great Evolution Pass, Yang Kai could detect the occasional energy fluctuations outside. They were naturally the hidden Divine Abilities or restrictions that were triggered.

However, Great Evolution Pass was so large and had such strong barriers around it that these occasional bursts did not pose any threat to it.

Suddenly, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao, who was sitting on a wicker chair and resting peacefully, had her eyes shoot open as she looked up suspiciously towards the sky.

Yang Kai, who was cultivating nearby, noticed and also turned to where she was looking.

At first, he did not notice anything unusual, but soon, his face changed slightly and he retracted his Small Universe.

The barrier protecting the Great Pass had a crack in it, and looking beyond this opening, Yang Kai saw the scene outside.

Out in the void, a huge figure was charging forward, carrying a huge bone of unknown origins in his hand. He brandished it around as if there were endless enemies on all sides and he was smashing them apart.

Every time he swung the bone in his hand, the Void itself shuddered.

The huge figure shot past Great Evolution Pass, causing it to tremble noticeably. The mere passing of this enormous figure had caused the protective barriers around the Pass to quake. Even those Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, who were responsible for protecting the Pass, were affected.

Yang Kai had no doubt that if the bone in that figure’s hand had hit Great Evolution Pass, even if all the defensive arrays were fully operational at this moment, it might not have been able to withstand the impact!

“A Giant Spirit God!” Yang Kai shouted out loud.

In the deep depths of the Black Ink Battlefield, he had actually seen a Giant Spirit God. But, why would one be here?

Yang Kai was confused.

This was the third Giant Spirit God he had encountered in his life!

When the Star Boundary was dying, it attracted a Giant Spirit God called Ah Da, who fed on the dead Worlds. However, Ah Da had waited outside the Star Boundary for decades, just snoring loudly as he slumbered. In the end, Yang Kai brought back a World Tree clone which enabled the Star Boundary to recover.

Eventually, Ah Da left. The Giant Spirit God Clan was born with unmatched power, but they were childlike in their innocence and quite gentle, only feeding on completely dead worlds. When the Star Boundary recovered, Ah Da did not linger any longer.

Later, Yang Kai met a second Giant Spirit God, Ah Er, in the vast void. By catching a ride with Ah Er, Yang Kai entered the Chaotic Dead Territory, where he befriended Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan and gained a lot of benefits.

However, after they parted, Yang Kai heard no news of either Ah Da or Ah Er. Although they were huge and transversed the 3,000 Worlds freely, it was like they simply disappeared, never to be seen again. It was truly bizarre.

Yang Kai never expected that there would be a Giant Spirit God in the Black Ink Battlefield, and very much unlike Ah Da and Ah Er’s mildness, this Giant Spirit God radiated an intense fury, as if he was out to kill all living beings!

This was very strange.

Just like Yang Kai and Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao, the entire Great Evolution Army was dazzled by the sight of the Giant Spirit God dashing through the void.

The Giant Spirit God Clan were very few in number, so although all of them had heard of these strange beings before, almost none of them had ever seen one before.

Not to mention, this was the Black Ink Battlefield!

No one had ever heard of a Giant Spirit God living on the Black Ink Battlefield.

After a moment of silence, Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao suddenly shot up and chased after the Giant Spirit God.

Yang Kai hesitated for a moment before following suit. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had been in Great Evolution Pass this whole time and had not checked out the surrounding void. When he got out of Great Evolution Pass and looked around, Yang Kai was stunned.

The surrounding void was actually dotted with points of light, just like a sky that was full of stars, a beautiful sight to behold.

Even as Yang Kai marveled at this beauty, he could sense the dangers hidden within.

The dots of light were all Divine Abilities left over from the ancient times. The whole void was filled with chaotic and dense energies, and it was these energies that had been nourishing these Divine Abilities and Arrays for countless years, allowing them to persist to this day.

However, these Divine Abilities were extremely unstable and would explode at the slightest touch.

As Great Evolution Pass advanced, it inevitably touched a lot of these things. All the bursts of energy were blocked off by the shields of Great Evolution Pass, so the soldiers inside were not affected at all.

Without dallying any further, Yang Kai followed after the Old Ancestor.

Although he was proficient in the Dao of Space, he still could not keep up with Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao who was in the Ninth-Order; thus, was steadily falling behind her.

Soon though, he perceived the Old Ancestor’s aura rapidly coming towards him.

In the blink of an eye, the Old Ancestor appeared in front of him, looking somewhat frantic, as if there was some great danger behind her. Yang Kai still did not understand why the Old Ancestor came back all of a sudden but she did not give him time to ponder on it as she simply grabbed his hand and shouted, “Run!”

After she said that, she dragged Yang Kai away. In the blink of an eye, they were hundreds of thousands of kilometres away.

Along the way, they inadvertently touched a hidden restriction which was blown apart by her fist.

It was only when the Old Ancestor dealt with this restriction that Yang Kai came to his senses and turned around to look back!
