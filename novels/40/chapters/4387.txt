Yun Fei Bai flushed and said, “I was just careless!”

“He’s really something as he’s able to harm you when he’s just a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.” Mao Zhe nodded, “Where does he come from?”

Yun Fei Bai glared at the Wei Brothers, “They have some explaining to do!”

Mao Zhe turned to look at the Wei Brothers, who turned pale instantly as they were soaked in cold sweat. Not daring to hide anything, they hurriedly narrated their encounter with Yang Kai.

Upon hearing that, Mao Zhe fell into his thoughts for a moment before saying, “He came all the way here for Lan You Ruo.”

Yun Fei Bai was severely injured as his chest had been penetrated by the Azure Dragon Spear, and his clothes were covered in blood. Given the fact that he was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, it would take him one to two months before he could fully recover. However, he wasn’t at risk of losing his life at the very least. While Mao Zhe spoke to the Wei Brothers, he was already seated with his legs crossed and adjusting his breathing to prevent his injury from worsening.

The Wei Brothers darted their gazes between Yun Fei Bai and Mao Zhe as they were completely apprehensive. Even though they had no idea that Yang Kai was audacious enough to make a scene in Profound Yang Mountain, they were the ones who brought him to this place after all; hence, they could not stay clear of this matter. Now that Yun Fei Bai was severely injured, they would probably get some harsh punishments.

They couldn’t help but secretly curse at Yang Kai for dragging them into this. They felt that they had been unfairly victimised.

A while later, two figures descended from the sky.

They were the Third Mountain Lord and the Fourth Mountain Lord of Profound Yang Mountain.

Mao Zhe turned to look at them, whereupon the Third Mountain Lord Geng Qing shook his head, “He escaped.”

Mao Zhe arched his brow, “Oh? He managed to flee with you two personally chasing after him? Wasn’t that boy injured by Second Brother?”

The Fourth Mountain Lord was the only woman among the Four Great Mountain Lords of Profound Yang Mountain. Apart from her alluring face and curvy figure, her watery eyes seemed able to suck a man’s soul into them at any moment. Upon hearing Mao Zhe’s words, she replied, “That boy seems to be adept in the Dao of Space. He teleported away while Third Brother and I were chasing him, vanishing into thin air.”

Mao Zhe’s gaze brightened, “He’s adept in the Dao of Space?”

Geng Qing dipped his head, “I believe so.”

Mao Zhe immediately closed his eyes and scanned his surroundings. A moment later, he nodded, “It’s true. There are some residual fluctuations of Space Principles here. No wonder that he had the guts to make a scene in Profound Yang Mountain. I heard that Masters of the Dao of Space are unrivaled when it comes to chasing and escaping. Unless we’re able to seal the Heavens and lock the Earth, we won’t be able to restrict his freedom. It seems the rumours are true.”

After pondering on it for a moment, he went on to say, “Since that boy has come all the way here for Lan You Ruo, he’ll definitely look for her. Third Brother, Fourth Sister, please go over and capture that boy. I don’t care about the others, but that boy has to be brought back to me alive.”

Geng Qing and the Fourth Mountain Lord Zhou Ya exchanged glances, then the former asked doubtfully, “It seems that you have a high regard for that boy, Big Brother.”

Mao Zhe gently rubbed his fingers together and asked, “How many years have you been in the Shadowless Cave Heaven, Third Brother?”

After giving it a thought, Geng Qing replied, “I can’t remember the exact length of time, but I suppose it’s been 3,000 years.”

“What about you, Fourth Sister?”

Zhou Ya replied, “I’m sure it’s been more than 1,000 years.”

Then, Mao Zhe took a glance at Yun Fei Bai, who was trying to heal his wound, and said, “Second Brother came earlier than you two. He’s been around for 6,000 years while I’ve been stuck in this place for more than 10,000 years. The Shadowless Cave Heaven is neither big nor small. Over the years, we’ve searched all the places we could, but we’re still unable to find an exit.”

All of them appeared dejected at the mention of this. Besides Profound Yang Mountain, those from Unrivalled Guild, and Twin Spirit Island had constantly been looking for a way out as well; however, they were unable to find any clue regardless of how hard they tried.

“It’s been so many years. Don’t you want to go out and see the outside world again? Do you want to remain stuck in this damned place forever?”

Geng Qing replied, “Of course we want to leave.”

Zhou Ya appeared to be in her thoughts, “Big Brother, you mean…”

Mao Zhe nodded, “That boy is a Master of the Dao of Space, so he’s much more sensitive to Space Principle fluctuations than us. Perhaps… he’ll be able to find the way out.”

The gazes of Geng Qing and Zhou Ya brightened when they heard that. Although they were unable to find the exit after so many years, it didn’t mean that the Shadowless Cave Heaven had no exit. It was just that they hadn’t found it. If they could make use of this boy who was proficient in the Dao of Space, perhaps they would have a pleasant surprise.

An excited Geng Qing said, “En, don’t worry, Big Brother. Fourth Sister and I will call the roll and capture that boy immediately.”

Just when Mao Zhe was about to speak, Yun Fei Bai suddenly opened his eyes and shouted, “Wait a moment!”

Geng Qing gazed at him, “Is there anything you want to say, Second Brother?”

Yun Fei Bai said through gritted teeth, “Please leave this matter to me, Big Brother. It’s utterly humiliating that I was injured by that brat. If I don’t get my revenge, I’ll never have a good night’s rest again.”

Upon hearing that, Mao Zhe frowned.

Zhou Ya said, “Second Brother, your wound… How are you going to make a move? Don’t forget that Lan You Ruo is also a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Although her power might have weakened during this period of time, it’s still not easy to deal with her if she’s pushed into a corner.”

Yun Fei Bai replied, “This kind of injury will heal in two… No, it’ll heal in one month. We’ve been waiting for years, so why can’t we wait another month?” Then, he gazed at Mao Zhe and sported a solemn expression, “Please give me one month’s time, Big Brother.”

Mao Zhe closed his eyes and fell silent. A moment later, he nodded gently and said, “Since you’re so determined, we’ll wait for your recovery, then you’ll lead the operation.”

An ecstatic Yun Fei Bai replied, “Many thanks, Big Brother!”

Following that, Mao Zhe moved and abruptly disappeared.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya exchanged glances, then they told Yun Fei Bai to take a rest and dispersed.

After the other three Mountain Lords were gone, the women who were injured by Yang Kai earlier appeared and came over to help Yun Fei Bai up before they headed to another mountain.

The Wei Brothers traded glances and shuddered before fleeing from that place, feeling as though they had just escaped from death’s door.

Meanwhile, a battered figure landed on a barren mountain. He was none other than Yang Kai, who was running for his life just moments before.

Yun Fei Bai’s attack almost beheaded him. The long wound on his neck was hideous, and all his clothes were soaked in blood. However, he had a strong physique, so even as he ran for his life earlier, his wound was starting to heal. The flesh around his wound was seen squirming and re-connecting already.

Now, the most important thing for him was to get rid of Yun Fei Bai’s World Force; otherwise, his wound would never heal.

Upon making sure that no one was pursuing him, Yang Kai dug a hole in the mountain and snuck into it.

Then, he stuffed a handful of pills into his mouth and pushed his World Force to suppress and expel the power left behind by Yun Fei Bai in his neck wound.

Although Yun Fei Bai was one Order above him, his residual power wasn’t a living thing; therefore, it wasn’t difficult for Yang Kai to disperse it as he just needed some time.

Half a day later, Yang Kai’s expression changed as he opened his eyes and released his Divine Sense. Soon, he realised that there was a woman pacing around outside the barren mountain.

Yang Kai initially decided to ignore her; after all, he had to recuperate as soon as possible, but the woman kept pacing around for a long time as though she had discovered something.

His heart sank as he had no choice but to leave his hideout.

The woman was only in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so given Yang Kai’s current strength, he could kill her as he pleased. Therefore, even though he was wounded, he wasn’t afraid of her.

The woman was just looking around when she sensed something and looked up, only to see Yang Kai staring coldly at her.

She was shocked as she subconsciously took a few steps back. All of a sudden, something flashed through her eyes as Yang Kai abruptly appeared before her and clenched her neck with his iron-like hand. The force coming from his palm felt as lethal as a python’s bite.

At that instant, the woman was horrified as she coughed and pleaded with the man with her eyes.

Yang Kai stared dispassionately at her for a moment before frowning, “You’re one of Yun Fei Bai’s women?”

The woman looked familiar to Yang Kai. She was one of the women who surrounded Yun Fei Bai earlier. If he wasn’t mistaken, she was the one who massaged Yun Fei Bai’s calves. Presently, she was clad only in a thin layer of clothing, leaving her curvy figure faintly visible to the eyes.

Moments ago, Yang Kai fought with those women and sent them all flying away, this woman included.

The woman wanted to nod, but she was unable to move a muscle, so she could only bat her eyes.

“How did you find me?” Yang Kai asked coldly. He had even shaken off two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, so how did this weak woman find his whereabouts?

As he spoke, he slightly loosened his grip. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The woman hurriedly explained, “I’m sensitive to smells, and Sir’s blood is different from others.”

Yang Kai frowned, not knowing whether he should believe her. As he expanded his Divine Sense, he realised that there was no one else besides them in this place.

He had the intention of killing her, but faced with a much weaker woman who didn’t have a blood feud with him, Yang Kai didn’t have the heart to cross that line.

After glaring for a while, he snorted and released her, “Since you’re able to find me, why have you come to look for me on your own instead of telling the leaders of Profound Yang Mountain to come here? Aren’t you worried that I’ll kill you?”

The woman pressed her lips together. Without replying to him, she fished out a jade slip from her Space Ring and passed it to him.

“What is this?”

The woman didn’t explain anything, and upon seeing that Yang Kai wasn’t taking it, she gently put the jade slip down on the ground and stepped backwards as she said, “I’ll owe you a favour if you can kill Yun Fei Bai.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brows while the woman turned around and left, leaving behind a rather pleasant fragrance in the air.

After taking a look at the jade slip, Yang Kai balled up his fist and grasped it in his hand. Upon examining it, he arched his brow.

That was because the jade slip contained a detailed map of the Shadowless Cave Heaven and the Proprietress’ location.

As he recalled the woman’s words before she left, Yang Kai fell into contemplation.
