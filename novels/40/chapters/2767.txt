Wen Zi Shan quickly followed up, “Did those twenty-plus Emperors really bear witness to what happened? What did they say happened?”

A wrinkle appeared on Xiao Yu Yang’s forehead as he turned silent for a moment before muttering, “Tan Jun Hao used parasites to control them to fight against Yang Kai. Nevertheless, he underestimated his enemy and was killed by Yang Kai in the end. Wu Ming helped a tyrant to oppress the innocent, and was also killed at the scene.”

“Tan Jun Hao actually carried out such despicable actions and smeared the honour of Star Soul Palace! His death really isn’t worth pitying!” A solemn expression appeared on Wen Zi Shan’s face as he stared intently at Xiao Yu Yang and pressed, “From what you’ve said, Yang Kai can be considered to have helped your Star Soul Palace clean its house, so you should feel gratitude towards him, yes? Is Brother Xiao here to express Star Soul Palace’s thanks to Yang Kai? If that is the case, you really don’t need to, as Elder Yang’s heroic actions were to purge evil. Your Star Soul Palace is too polite.”

Xiao Yu Yang exhaled slightly, before quickly replying, “Temple Master Wen, Tan Jun Hao was a Soul Palace Elder. Furthermore, he was a Third-Order Emperor, so his death isn’t a small matter. This also concerns the face of my Star Soul Palace!”

Wen Zi Shan gave a faint smile in response, “It’s naturally a big matter. However, didn’t the statements given by those twenty or so Emperors already provide plenty of explanation?”

Xiao Yu Yang shook his head, “I’m afraid there’s no other choice but for Yang Kai to follow me back to Star Soul Palace.”

An awkward look surfaced on Wen Zi Shan’s face, “I’m afraid that that’s not possible. Currently, Yang Kai can be considered to be an Elder of our temple. In a few days, we will be holding our Grand Canonization Ceremony. If he goes with you, won’t our temple become the laughingstock in the Southern Territory? Although Star Soul Palace wants to keep their face, so does our temple.”

Xiao Yu Yang replied, “Just as Temple Master Wen had said, the Grand Canonization Ceremony will happen in a few days. At this moment, Yang Kai still isn’t considered an Elder of Azure Sun Temple.”

“Who said that?” Wen Zi Shan grinned, before turning his head around, “Little Qian Qian!”

Without any pause, Chen Qian raised her hand and hundreds of invitations in the form of streaking lights shot out in all directions, before disappearing in the blink of an eye. She then proceeded to cup her fists and reply, “Temple Master, this subordinate has just sent out the invitations for the Grand Canonization Ceremony to the various Sects and Families throughout the Southern Territory!”

“Good,” Wen Zi Shan nodded slightly.

By this time, Xiao Yu Yang’s expression had already turned gloomy, “Wen Zi Shan, do you know the repercussions of your actions?”

Wen Zi Shan’s face instantly turned solemn as he said in a calm voice, “Yang Kai is a member of my temple. Even if your Star Soul Palace wants to take him away, you have to obtain the agreement from our temple before doing so.”

Letting out a sigh, Xiao Yu Yang took out a communication artifact before speaking in an indifferent tone, “I’ve already reported this matter to the Great Emperor, so the Great Emperor will be the one to decide how to handle this affair.”

Wen Zi Shan had shown his hand, clearly wanting to use the weight of his Sect to protect Yang Kai. Therefore, even if he were to confront Wen Zi Shan for this matter, he might not be able to snatch Yang Kai away. This left Xiao Yu Yang no other choice but to report this matter and quietly wait for a reply.

Wen Zi Shan’s expression finally changed. Nevertheless, he still proceeded to give a faint smile, “With his wisdom, the Great Emperor will naturally make a fair and just decision. Since you’re a guest, why not stay in our temple for a few days, Brother Xiao?”

“Good. Pardon my intrusion.” Xiao Yu Yang nodded slightly.

“Please!”

…..

Within the guest residence on top of Purple Bamboo Peak, a series of clashing sounds rang out, before an additional layer of majesty radiated from Yang Kai as the black dragon armour covered his body.

After unleashing his Golden Divine Dragon Source in a show of might, Yang Kai discovered that it was extraordinarily easy to refine this Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor, so much so that it was in fact even easier than most Dao Source Grade Artifacts. Wearing the Artifact Armor, he found it fit him exceedingly well, and was also extremely flexible, to the point where he was not even afraid of damaging it when he used his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique.

The only small gripe he had was that there was substantial damage present on the abdomen section of this Artifact Armor, causing this Mid-Rank Emperor Grade Artifact to only be able to display the might of a Low-Rank Emperor Grade Artifact.

However, this was more than enough.

Yang Kai had not bought this armour for its defensive strength; he simply wanted something that was capable of covering his body up after he had displayed his Dragon Transformation. Regardless of whether it was now a Mid-Rank or a Low-Rank Emperor Grade Artifact, it wasn’t too much of a difference to him.

Nevertheless, what Yang Kai fancied most about this Artifact Armor was how light it felt, as though he wasn’t wearing it at all. After putting on some standard robes, it was basically impossible to even notice this armour beneath them.

After inspecting himself for a while, Yang Kai proceeded to sit down again and continued to refine the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armor.

Gao Xue Ting came back a few times, though she did not disturb Yang Kai after seeing that he had been in retreat ever since.

Five days went by in a flash.

As morning dawned, Gao Xue Ting pushed open the door, shocking Yang Kai awake.

Raising his head, he noticed five young women walking over per the instructions of Gao Xue Ting. Seeing the outfits they wore, he guessed that they were disciples of Azure Sun Temple. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Stand up.” Gao Xue Ting said to Yang Kai.

Standing up, Yang Kai asked suspiciously, “What is this about?”

Gao Xue Ting continued to signal to those few female disciples while giving Yang Kai an explanation, “They’re here to help you clean up. Today’s your big day.”

Yang Kai grinned, “You sound as if I’m about to get married.” However, seeing the icy expression on Gao Xue Ting’s face, Yang Kai withdrew his smile and obediently followed her arrangements.

He sat down on a chair to the side and immediately, one of the female disciples walked behind him and started to brush his hair, her movements soft and gentle. Another disciple proceeded to half kneel before him and started to clean his face.

Standing to the side, Gao Xue Ting started to brief Yang Kai about the flow of the Grand Canonization Ceremony, as well as the things he needed to take note of.

This left Yang Kai in surprise as he asked, “I’m just going to become a High-Rank Guest Elder. Is there really a need to make this event into such a large one?”

He had assumed that this was just a ceremony for formality; however, the proceedings don’t seem to fit with what he had envisioned.

“Don’t worry about that. You just need to follow along obediently,” Gao Xue Ting said in a commanding tone.

Yang Kai snorted back a reply before obediently remaining seated and not moving. He closed his eyes and rested, while etching Gao Xue Ting’s words into his heart.

The few female disciples surrounded Yang Kai as they groomed him, all while occasionally sneaking a few peeks to size him up before sighing in amazement. The sudden canonization of a new Elder had caught all of them in surprise. This was especially so after hearing that this new Elder was around the same age as their Eldest Senior Brother Xia Sheng, leaving them even more intrigued.

After all, Xia Sheng possessed extraordinary fame within the temple. Who knew how many female disciples had ideas about him? Now, having seen Yang Kai, they discovered that he appeared to be not inferior when compared to their Eldest Senior Brother. In fact, his heroic air trumped Xia Sheng’s. The close-distance service left the hearts of the few disciples beating somewhat rapidly as daydreams filled their heads.

After about an hour or so, Gao Xue Ting sent those female disciples back and proceeded to make Yang Kai stand and spin around a few times, sweeping her eyes over him for a while before nodding lightly.

Dressed in a set of long purple robes, Yang Kai had managed to get rid of a sliver of his youthful looks, replacing it with an air of stability that fit the appearance of an Elder.

“Let’s go.” Gao Xue Ting waved her hand and took the lead to fly off, with Yang Kai following close behind.

Originally, she wanted to remind Yang Kai to not be overly nervous; however, through the surveillance of her Divine Sense, she discovered the calm and relaxed look hanging on Yang Kai’s face, appearing as though he was utterly not worried at all. Seeing this, Gao Xue Ting was disinclined to remind him anymore.

She knew that Yang Kai had come face to face with quite a few great storms in his travels, so although this Grand Canonization Ceremony was a big event, it was not sufficient to shake his mind and spirit.

On top of Myriad Saints Peak, huge streams of people were present as guests hailing from various places were arranged on the sides of the plaza in accordance to their status and cultivation. There weren’t many people in the crowd, just over two hundred or so. Nevertheless, these people represented nearly all of the great Sects and powers in the Southern Territory.

Many disciples of Azure Sun Temple shuttled back and forth busily, continuing to walk up and down the various rows of seats. There was an incessant flow of fine wine and fragrant delicacies as the Emperor Realm Masters who were familiar with each other continued to toast, turning the environment exceedingly lively and bustling.

It was a rare sight to see so many Masters present in a single space. Even the Canonization Ceremony of Xia Sheng as an Elder was not of this magnitude. For the latter, the various great forces were informed after the matter had happened. However, for Yang Kai, the buzz he had created was known throughout the entire Southern Territory. If not for the tight time constraints, there might be even more guests arriving than those present.

Xiao Yu Yang and Xiao Chen shared a table. With their high statuses, the former being a Star Soul Palace Elder, and moreover a Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, there were naturally people coming forward to toast with them. However, after Xiao Yu Yang casually dealt with a few people, he proceeded to close his eyes, making the rest of the people not dare to head over to disturb him.

No one even dared to have any criticism of his actions.

All of a sudden, drums rang out before the entire plaza turned silent and the bustling guests hastily headed back to their seats.

All eyes then turned and looked over towards the same direction.

Over there, two groups of cultivators were flying over, one group of males, and one group of females. All of the males wore smart appearances, brimming with bravery and heroic spirit. On the other side, all of the females appeared as though they were beauties that had come out of paintings, brimming with an elegance that was paired with their pure white dresses. Every single one of them possessed a Dao Source Realm cultivation, with strong and vibrant auras radiating from them.

The group of males and females split apart to reveal an exquisite ship floating behind. Yang Kai stood at the bow, meeting the wind head-on. As his long hair blew along with the wind, he gave people a feeling as though he was flying leisurely through the air. Standing not far behind him was Gao Xue Ting, who wore a solemn and respectful expression on her face.

Landing on the top of Myriad Saints Peak, the two groups of males and females immediately moved to the sides. As the ship came to a halt, Yang Kai and Gao Xue Ting flew and descended from it.

In an instant, countless gazes turned towards Yang Kai as people started to size him up in curiosity.

This fellow by the name of Yang Kai had killed an Elder and Deacon of Star Soul Palace. News of this matter had sent the entire Southern Territory into a buzz as of late. At this moment, even people who didn’t know about this matter instantly knew that this person was the main focus of Azure Sun Temple’s Grand Canonization Ceremony.

Those who did not know Yang Kai were naturally curious about him, wondering exactly what kind of fearless fellow he was to dare to take action against an Elder of Star Soul Palace.

From their first look, they discovered that Yang Kai only possessed a First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, causing looks of disappointment to appear on their faces. All of them secretly felt that there might be some kind of problem with the information they received, as how would a youth like Yang Kai be capable of killing Tan Jun Hao with that level of cultivation?

He might not even be able to resist a single move from Tan Jun Hao.

There were even more people carefully looking over towards Xiao Yu Yang. At this moment, being an Elder of Star Soul Palace, everyone was naturally very curious as to how he would react after seeing Yang Kai. However, the result left people disappointed, as the former continued to keep his eyes closed and not say a single word.

What was Azure Sun Temple thinking? They were actually conferring the title of Elder to a fellow who killed a Star Soul Palace Elder! Were they looking for trouble? Many people were unable to understand the current situation.

The flow of events for this Grand Canonization Ceremony was truthfully not complicated; after all, with everyone being a cultivator, the process was straightforward and not overly convoluted. Under Gao Xue Ting’s guidance, Yang Kai walked forward, ignoring the curious and examining gazes coming from the sides, all the way to before Wen Zi Shan.

With a faint smile hanging on his face, Wen Zi Shan extended a finger out and tapped on Yang Kai’s head before proceeding to speak sentence after sentence, spelling out the benefits, as well as the duties, that Yang Kai would have after becoming an Elder of Azure Sun Temple.
