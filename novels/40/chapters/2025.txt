In the middle of the night, inside the Zhang Family Manor, inside an elegant hall.

The old matriarch of the Zhang Family hosted a dinner in Yang Kai’s honour to thank him. Only Yang Kai, the middle-aged beauty, and the old matriarch attended.

The young girl, Zhang Ruo Xi, stood to the side, waiting eagerly, pouring drinks for the three of them as she cast Yang Kai glances from time to time with her beautiful eyes, her gaze filled with gratitude and admiration.

This young girl was only sixteen or seventeen, an age where she was still enamoured with stories of heroes and legends. Today, Yang Kai had almost single-handedly destroyed the Lu Family and avenged the wrongs that had befallen her Zhang Family, so how could she not worship him?

Among the people she met in her life, Zhang Gao Xuan was probably the strongest, but unfortunately, her father had died inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

Now though, Yang Kai seemed quite young, but clearly possessed even greater strength than her father. It was only natural she stole a few glances at him. Perhaps it was also due to the aroma of the wine, but the little girl’s delicate face now had a healthy blush on it. However, she still maintained excellent decorum and would promptly perform her serving duties without a single mistake.

“My Zhang Family does not have much in the way of hospitality, but I do hope Sir Benefactor will enjoy what little we do have.” Although the old matriarch was still injured, she still had a ruddy look on her face and politely offered Yang Kai the best she could.

The middle-aged beauty also spoke to him warmly.

“Old madam is too polite, and there is no need to address me as Sir or Benefactor. If old madam does not mind, please just address Junior by name directly,” Yang Kai felt quite uncomfortable when the old woman addressed him so formally.

After the Zhang Family killed Lu Bai Chuan, Yang Kai wanted to leave. If it weren’t for Zhang Ruo Xi’s relationship with the Space Spirit Jade, he would never have agreed to remain.

However, he didn’t know how to bring up this subject. He instinctively felt that this Space Spirit Jade was hiding many secrets, ones likely related to the Zhang Family, so talking about it rashly would only be counterproductive. As such, he could only look for the right opportunity.

Considering all this, he couldn’t help glancing over at Zhang Ruo Xi, just to find that this little girl was also quietly looking at himself with a pair of bright eyes.

Seeing Yang Kai looking towards her, Zhang Ruo Xi was shocked and hastily lowered her head, her pretty face turning bright red as she stared at the floor.

Yang Kai chuckled and looked away casually.

The beautiful woman sitting on the left side of Yang Kai saw this scene and many thoughts flashed across her mind as a slight smile appeared on her lips.

“Old madam, the Lu Family matter has been settled, so according to our previous discussion, the agreement between myself and Brother Zhang has now been completed,” Yang Kai said with a solemn expression.

“Naturally,” The old woman nodded.

“As for the Dao Source Pill, after I find an Alchemist to refine it, old madam may rest assured that I will find a way to deliver one to the Zhang Family.”

The old woman chuckled, “This old woman believes in Sir Benefactor’s character, and my Zhang Family is in no hurry now. Currently, my Zhang Family has suffered severe damage, so even if we were to receive a Dao Source Pill, what could we do with it? So, Benefactor need not worry about this issue, we can discuss it after the pill has been refined.”

“That would be best,” Yang Kai nodded.

At that moment, the middle-aged beauty, who had not much that evening, suddenly spoke, “Brother Yang is so young but has such amazing cultivation, an extraordinary hero worthy of admiration. There must be many women who have shown you favour, yes?”

Yang Kai was startled when he heard these words, never having expected them to come up and from a woman no less.

The old woman also frowned, and although she felt that it was a bit inappropriate for a woman to talk about such a topic with Yang Kai, she knew her daughter-in-law was not one for casual gossip so she didn’t interrupt and instead just observed.

The middle-aged woman was also observing the situation carefully, and after seeing the shock fade from Yang Kai’s eyes and be replaced with a look of fond reminiscence, she immediately knew her speculations were not unfounded.

However, if one thought about it a bit, it wasn’t too surprising. Despite Yang Kai looking quite young, with a Third-Order Origin King cultivation, it was only natural he had plenty of life experience and would have met at least one or two unforgettable women on his journey through life.

It would be stranger if Yang Kai really was divorced from the matters of the heart.

The banquet seemed to fall into a strange silence as Yang Kai became lost in his memories.

After some time, Yang Kai sighed and stood up, “Old madam, the hour is late, so Junior would like to go back and rest first. Old madam was injured during the battle today so she should also go back and rest early, lest her wounds become worse.”

The old woman smiled and nodded, “Many thanks for Sir Benefactor’s care, I shall do so. Ruo Xi, take Benefactor to the guest room and serve him well.”

“Yes,” Zhang Ruo Xi heard this, put down the wine pitcher, and elegantly bowed to Yang Kai, “Sir, please come with me.”

Yang Kai complied and left with Zhang Ruo Xi.

After Yang Kai left, the old woman glared at the beautiful woman.

The beautiful woman looked embarrassed, “Mother, daughter-in-law knows she made an indiscreet remark.”

“Hmph! Fortunately, Benefactor seems to have a benevolent nature, otherwise, this old lady would not spare you,” The old woman coldly snorted.

The middle-aged beauty nodded repeatedly.

“But... why did you ask such a question just now?” The old woman frowned and inquired.

The beautiful woman smiled and said, “Mother, did you not notice? Benefactor glanced towards Ruo Xi several times during the night.”

“And so?” The old woman asked.

The beautiful woman smiled, “Even though Ruo Xi is not a great beauty, she still has her charms. It seems Benefactor is a bit interested in her.”

The old woman heard this and furrowed her brow, “That can’t be, no? Ruo Xi is just a First-Order Saint King, how could she enter Benefactor’s vision?”

The beautiful woman pursed her lips and smiled, “Mother, men do not only care about a woman’s cultivation, their feelings also matter as well. If there is an attraction, no matter how low a woman’s cultivation is, it will not matter, and if there are no such feelings, it will not matter how high a woman’s cultivation is.”

The old woman immediately became a bit disgruntled as she snapped, “Are you implying this old woman does not understand the ways of men and women?”

The beautiful woman spat out her tongue, “Daughter-in-law had no such intentions. However, right now, my Zhang Family is weak, Gao Xuan died inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, and although the Lu Family is now gone, meaning there is no need to worry about foreign enemies in the short term, Mother must not forget that in the surrounding region, it is not just the Lu Family that has an interest in us. If my Zhang Family does not have a master to protect it, what will we do if a strong enemy invades? The three favours Gao Xuan secured from Benefactor for us have also been used up, so it will be impossible to ask him to help in the future.”

“What you mean is...” The old woman asked thoughtfully.

“If my Zhang Family can form a relationship with Benefactor, if the Zhang Family encounters trouble in the future, will he just stand by and watch?” The beautiful woman smiled elegantly, “And Ruo Xi is the key to forming such a relationship.”

“I understand what you want to say,” The old woman nodded and said seriously, “If it is as you said, this is an excellent plan. Gao Xuan has died, and my Zhang Family really must begin considering its future. “

“En. He is so young yet has already reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm, and judging from his performance during the day, it seems that he is not an ordinary Third-Order Origin King. No ordinary Third-Order Origin King would be capable of plunging into the Lu Family and capturing Lu Bai Chuan alive! With his aptitude, breaking through to the Dao Source Realm in the future is not impossible. If my Zhang Family could be connected with him, it would be the same as enjoying cool shade under a big tree! Even if he did not remain here, who would dare to provoke us?”

Hearing this, the old woman’s eyes lit up and she also became excited. Around Maplewood City, there weren’t many families that had a Dao Source Realm master. If a Dao Source Realm master was sheltering them, that family could at least remain worry-free for a hundred years.

But she still hesitated, “It is as you say, but I’m afraid all this is still just our wishful thinking, and if we were to upset Benefactor in any way...”

The beautiful woman smiled, “Mother, we can do this...”

As she spoke, she leaned forward and whispered in the old woman’s ear.

The old woman listened and nodded repeatedly, and after a long time smiled and said, “Good, good, very good, we’ll follow your plan. But doing this will probably make Ruo Xi suffer.”

The beautiful woman smiled and shook her head, “Why would this make her suffer? I think Benefactor is by no means a villain, and if Ruo Xi can really follow him, she will likely be extremely happy. Mother, rest assured, I will go and explain everything to Ruo Xi tonight.”

“Good, but if Ruo Xi disagrees, don’t force her. I don’t want to exchange her happiness for the future of my Zhang Family,” The old woman nodded.

.....

Under the guidance of the young girl, Yang Kai walked through the manor until finally arriving at a certain room. The young girl opened the door and quickly prepared the beddings inside.

Yang Kai exchanged a few words with her on the way, but judging from the girl’s reaction, she was extremely shy. When answering Yang Kai’s question, her voice trembled and her face flushed while she constantly apologized to Yang Kai even if she had done nothing wrong.

After everything was prepared, the girl bowed and said, “Sir, please rest, Ruo Xi will take her leave.”

“En, good work,” Yang Kai nodded.

The girl hurriedly walked by him, and with the faint moonlight, Yang Kai was able to make out a hint of red colouring her cheeks all the way to her ears.

After the girl left, Yang Kai turned his head and looked around the room, finding that it was decorated quite luxuriously. With a wave of his hand, he used his Qi and Spiritual Energy to create a barrier around the room to isolate it from the outside.

With a flicker, he arrived atop the bed and sat down cross-legged to begin checking his harvest from the day.

Needless to say, the things he obtained from the Lu Family Vault were not plentiful nor poor. Just the Source Crystals along number more than 600,000.

With Yang Kai’s previous gains, he now had almost one million Low-Rank Source Crystals.

There were also some artifacts in the vault, all of them Origin King Grade. Yang Kai had only glanced at them before tossing them into his Space Ring. As for the rare ores, he had thrown them into his Sealed World Bead so his Embodiment could absorb them with the Heaven Devouring Battle Law.

There were also some pills which Yang Kai quickly sorted through and stored away in case of emergencies.

Next, Yang Kai checked Lu Bai Chuan’s Space Ring and found a similar assortment of items to the ones he found in the vault.

As for the Thunder Wind Hammer and Silver Moon Purple Frost Saber, Yang Kai appreciated them a bit more than the other treasures. Although the Thunder Wind Hammer was quite imposing, it was just an Origin King Grade artifact in the end, so it was only slightly more valuable.

The Silver Moon Purple Frost Saber, on the other hand, was able to display slight traces of Principle Strength.
