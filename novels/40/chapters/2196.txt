After snapping at Luo Yuan, Yang Kai turned back to the round-faced woman and asked seriously, “You know what the effects of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill are, right?”

The woman nodded, “I know.”

“Then how precious it is, you must also understand.”

The woman nodded again.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “Then do you think this trivial Fire Spirit Stone can be exchanged for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill?”

A trace of embarrassment appeared on the woman’s face as she pursed her red lips and replied quietly and honestly, “No...”

“That’s right. The value of these two treasures is nowhere near equivalent. Although I am interested in your Fire Spirit Stone, trading for it would obviously be a big loss for me...” Yang Kai chattered on before finally saying, “Only a fool would accept such a deal, right?”

“Then do you want something else? I can give you anything I have,” the round-faced woman said anxiously. She was no fool and could naturally understand what Yang Kai was implying. Yang Kai just said that this exchange would be a loss for him, not that he wouldn’t trade with her. Hearing this, she immediately knew that Yang Kai wanted something more from her, so she gritted her teeth and said, “I can give you all of these items!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brows, revealing a pensive expression, as if debating whether to accept.

In all fairness, the value of these things taken out by this round-faced woman wasn’t low, but it was still a bit lacking to exchange for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, but... if the thing that Yang Kai was eying now really had the effect he thought it did, that alone would be enough to exchange for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

“Is this still not enough?” The woman seemed very eager to obtain this Extraordinary Treasure Pill, so seeing Yang Kai’s hesitant expression, she couldn’t help feeling uneasy.

“If you can come up with some Source Crystals as well, then this deal can...”

Before Yang Kai finished speaking, the round-faced woman stretched out her hand and touched her Space Ring. The next moment, a large pile of Source Crystals appeared in front of Yang Kai. A rough count put the number at a hundred thousand.

“This is every last Source Crystal I have,” the woman said.

“Alright then!” Seeing this, Yang Kai smiled immediately and said, “Since Sister is so sincere, I will trade you an Extraordinary Treasure Pill for all of these!”

“Really?” The woman’s voice trembled as she almost cried out with joy, staring at Yang Kai with gratitude and pleasant surprise, as if she couldn’t believe she had actually succeeded.

After all, there were so many people who failed before her. She had not been expecting to successfully conclude a deal here and had previously come with a mentality of trying her luck. But now, it appeared she had stumbled upon great fortune so she was naturally quite joyful. Unable to control her emotions, she covered her mouth with her delicate hands as her eyes became somewhat wet.

Yang Kai reached into his Alchemy Furnace, took out an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, and handed it to the woman as he said, “Since I said I would exchange with you, I will certainly keep my word!”

The woman then stretched out a pair of small hands and tremblingly took the pure white Spirit Pill, holding it extremely delicately as if she was afraid it would break, carefully examining it with her eyes.

Yang Kai started to pack the various treasures and Source Crystals the young woman had taken out into his Space Ring, but when he picked up a certain unremarkable yellow bead, he quietly poured his Source Qi and Divine Sense into it and found it gave no response at all...

At that moment, Yang Kai felt ecstatic and hurriedly put the bead away.

At the same time, the cultivators outside were in an uproar.

Almost everyone’s eyes were now glaring hotly at the back of the round-faced woman.

Although they didn’t see exactly what the woman took out and reached a deal with Yang Kai, at this moment, they knew the woman had an Extraordinary Treasure Pill in her hands.

Extraordinary Treasure Pills in Yang Kai’s hands, they didn’t dare have any ideas about, but this young woman was nothing more than a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so she became the target of ulterior motives.

Soon, Yang Kai finished packing up.

He glanced at the cultivators outside before turning to the round-faced woman and sighing lightly, “Sister!”

“En, what else does this Elder Brother wish to discuss?” The round-faced woman seemed to have recovered from her initial joy and asked politely.

“I only want to tell you a simple truth!” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

“What?”

“An ordinary man is innocent, but treasures make one guilty!” Yang Kai said sternly.

The woman was taken aback for a moment, but she quickly understood and nodded gratefully towards Yang Kai, “Many thanks for reminding me.”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Since you understand, I advise you to take this Extraordinary Treasure Pill now. As I said earlier, this Extraordinary Treasure Pill does not need to be taken at the moment of breakthrough, but rather the sooner one takes it, the better its effects will be when the time comes. Right now, you are still just a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator so it is the perfect time to take this. If Sister is comfortable, this Yang can stand guard for you for a moment while you take it. In any case, it won’t cause much of a delay.”

“No no no!” The round-faced woman waved her hands quickly and whispered, “I have... another use for this Extraordinary Treasure Pill!”

A light flashed across Yang Kai’s eyes before he nodded lightly, “Then Sister should do as she pleases!”

“Many thanks for exchanging for this Spirit Pill with me. En, you’re a good person!” The round-faced woman smiled sweetly at Yang Kai before turning around and directly walking out.

Looking at her back, Yang Kai sighed helplessly.

He had said what should be said, but the other party refused to accept his advice and insisted on taking the Extraordinary Treasure Pill away. Obviously, this would cause some trouble. In fact... the best way to handle the Extraordinary Treasure Pill was to take it directly which would result in others losing interest in snatching it.

The only other viable option was to have strength on par with Wu Chang or Xiao Chen’s, enough to deter others from having unnecessary ideas.

Yang Kai could easily predict the trouble this round-faced woman would soon encounter...

Sure enough, things turned out just as he expected. Even before this young woman walked out of the shattered space, a number of people flew at her from all directions with unkind intentions.

Although in front of everyone’s eyes, acting so disgracefully was truly disgusting, since it was related to an Extraordinary Treasure Pill which represented the hope of reaching the Emperor Realm, these favoured Sons and Daughters of Heaven, from major Sects and families set aside their face in order to rob this round-faced woman.

The round-faced woman seemed to have also realized the predicament she was in and, smelling the scent of death approaching, she flicked her hand and summoned a ribbon-like artifact. Walking forward, she called out softly, “Fellow Brothers and Sister, Junior Sister does not wish to become enemies with any of you. If you can find it in your hearts, please do not create difficulties for me!”

She spoke sincerely and with great dignity.

There were indeed a few people who were affected by her speech and showed looks of reluctance, but most simply stared indifferently at her.

Within the few breaths, it took her to say these words, the young woman had already walked out of the area enveloped by Yang Kai’s Space Principles.

Suddenly, a burst of shouts rang out one after another.

“Hand over the Extraordinary Treasure Pill.”

“Hand over the Spirit Pill and we’ll spare your life!”

“Girl, cooperate with me obediently and you won’t have to suffer! Refuse and you cannot blame us for not showing mercy!”

With the sound of these voices, at least a dozen cultivators rushed towards her. The moment these people acted, they summoned their artifacts and used Secret Techniques in all different directions, intending to block their competitors while also closing in on the round-faced woman at an extremely fast speed.

A hint of panic flashed on the pretty face of this young woman, but at the critical moment, she managed to push her Source Qi violently and the ribbon in her hand flashed, creating a five-coloured barrier around her body after which she shot up into the sky and rushed outwards.

She obviously didn’t plan to fight with these people and just wanted to leave here as quickly as possible.

This was undoubtedly the correct approach.

But she was obviously too naïve. How could she alone resist the assault of so many people?

*Hong Hong Hong...*

After a muffled explosion, the figure of the round-faced woman was directly revealed and her petite body was sent falling to the ground like a meteorite.

Immediately afterwards, a dozen figures flew down after her, greed and excitement covering their faces.

The round-faced woman suddenly showed a look of despair.

Soon, she hit the ground, and although she was not severely injured, she was obviously not alright either. After struggling a few times, she finally managed to stand up, but it was too late...

Several of her faster pursuers had already approached her, the fastest of which held a sharp sword that he slashed fiercely at her right hand!

This man was ruthless and showed no pity, seemingly only wanting to quickly cut off the hand of the round-faced woman that was holding the Spirit Pill...

With no way out, the woman screamed, her face pale and bloodless.

With her Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, she couldn’t avoid this strike and it was inevitable she would lose her arm.

As for the man, he wore a victorious smirk on his face, as if the Extraordinary Treasure Pill was already in his hands!

As long as he could obtain the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, he would eat it immediately, eliminating the hope others had of snatching it.

Yang Kai’s complexion became gloomy as he secretly began pushing his Space Force, preparing to save the woman at the last moment! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But before Yang Kai could act, a figure mysteriously appeared in front of the round-faced woman. This figure was broad and heroic, like a tall mountain that could resist violent storms and rain, making the round-faced woman hiding behind it feel a sense of peace and comfort she had never felt before...

“Hm?” Yang Kai raised his brow as he observed this figure, a look of surprise filling his face.

He didn’t expect that at this critical moment, this person would actually make a move! [Could it be... he is also trying to snatch the Extraordinary Treasure Pill?]

Just as this thought flashed across Yang Kai’s mind, this newcomer suddenly pushed his hand out...

His movements weren’t fast, but they gave off a profound feeling, causing the sword-wielding man’s expression to change drastically, as if he was being enveloped by the grasp of death...

He wanted to avoid this palm, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t escape.

From an outside perspective, it was as if this man had slammed himself into his opponent’s attack.
