Although Yang Kai’s actions would obviously offend many people, he didn’t take any extreme measures like rashly killing and robbing, so his situation wasn’t too serious.

If he really snatched everything from everyone he met, his end would be unavoidable. Once he left the Four Seasons Realm, he would become the target of every major Sect...

At that time, unless he joined Azure Sun Temple or Gao Xue Ting was willing to protect him, he would inevitably be hunted down by the powerhouses of the Sects he had offended.

His current approach, however, guaranteed that people wouldn’t be too offended and also guaranteed him a good harvest.

Two days later, Yang Kai had already collected two of the three missing herbs, leaving just one left to find.

According to his observations though, the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus would fully mature within a day, so if the last auxiliary ingredient couldn’t be found by then, he could only swallow it.

Now, there were only two days before the exit to the Four Seasons Realm closed!

Yang Kai was growing anxious!

Because if he guessed right, the true Masters should soon be arriving.

As he was thinking so, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed as he turned to stare in a certain direction, a moment later a wry grin appeared on his lips as he muttered, “Seems they’ve come... a bit early!”

In the direction he was staring, dazzling light was rushing towards Yang Kai’s position. This light had several auras emanating from it, indicating that there was more than one individual approaching; however, one aura, in particular, gave Yang Kai an extraordinary feeling, as it was clearly far stronger than the others.

This aura obviously belonged to a Dao Source Master who was strong enough to give Yang Kai real trouble.

But since they were too far away still, Yang Kai didn’t know who it was.

The stream of light soon arrived at the top of the mountain and came to a stop some distance away from Yang Kai. When the glow faded, a number of figures appeared.

As soon as these people showed up, one of the men who looked roughly thirty years old pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “Senior Brother Zhuang, it was that bastard who robbed me and Junior Sister Xu of our Space Rings!”

As he spoke, a beautiful, fair-skinned woman in the group nodded her head as she glared at Yang Kai with a deep and bitter look, as if she had some unforgivable hatred towards him.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as he observed this man and woman, feeling they were a bit familiar and soon recognizing them as two of the ‘guests’ he had entertained yesterday...

However, the fate of these two people was the same as all the others who came here. They were both quickly subdued by Yang Kai before having their Space Rings snatched and inspected. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Oh? It turns out these two friends were from Orthodoxy Temple... It seems I’ve been disrespectful!” Yang Kai smiled as he looked at the talking man and cupped his fists.

He hadn’t inquired about the origins of these two people before, but seeing them with Zhuang Bu Fan, Yang Kai naturally understood their background.

Orthodoxy Temple was one of the top Sects in the Southern Territory, so as elite disciples, so this man and woman naturally had high pride; as such, how could they possibly stomach being suppressed and then robbed? Most likely, after they were victimized yesterday, they had used some means to contact Zhuang Bu Fan, their Eldest Senior Brother, hoping he would seek recompense for them.

Of course, the most important factor in all of this was the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus! By calling Zhuang Bu Fan over, not only was there a chance this man and woman could get their revenge on Yang Kai, but they may also be able to obtain this strange spirit flower.

“Bah!” The man who was speaking heard Yang Kai’s words and let out a cold snort, “Brat, don’t think you can talk your way out of this! Quickly admit your mistakes, kneel down, kowtow a few times, and slap your face, then maybe Senior Brother Zhuang will forgive you! Senior Brother has always been kind and righteous, never killing the innocent or oppressing the weak, but if you insist on being unreasonable... hmph!”

The meaning behind his words was self-evident, far different from the timid words he left after being deterred by Yang Kai yesterday. Now that he had someone to support him, this man made no attempt to hide his arrogance.

“What friend means... I don’t understand,” Yang Kai casually responded.

“Don’t play dumb!” The man shouted angrily, “You know exactly what you’ve done!”

“Hehe...” Yang Kai chuckled as he turned his eyes to Zhuang Bu Fan and asked, “Brother Zhuang, what do you say?”

Since coming here, Zhuang Bu Fan had yet to speak as his eyes drifted back and forth between the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus and Yang Kai, the look of doubt on his face getting thicker and thicker.

He had two doubts...

One was about what this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus was. He was the strongest Dao Source Realm disciple in Orthodoxy Temple and had extraordinary knowledge and experience, so he had a vague idea about what this Extraordinary Treasure Lotus was, but he couldn’t be certain, leaving him somewhat suspicious.

The second doubt he had was about Yang Kai, because no matter how he looked, the opposite party was nothing but a First-Order Dao Source cultivator, yet with just this kind of cultivation, Yang Kai had somehow easily subdued his Junior Brother and Junior Sister. If his Junior Brother and Junior Sister hadn’t come to him and explained this matter personally, Zhuang Bu Fan would not have believed it.

At this moment, upon hearing Yang Kai’s question, Zhuang Bu Fan frowned, cupped his fists and said, “Dare I ask how to address this friend?”

Although he came here to avenge his Junior Brother and Junior Sister, he still showed a polite appearance and did not immediately act against Yang Kai, showing a great breadth of character.

“Yang Kai!” Yang Kai cupped his fists and replied.

“This Zhuang will remember your name... Brother Yang came together with Azure Sun Temple, correct?” Zhuang Bu Fan’s face became more confused, “But... Why have I never heard of anyone like Brother Yang belonging to Azure Sun Temple?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai raised his brow and praised, “Brother Zhuang’s powers of observation and memory are outstanding! I did indeed arrive together with Azure Sun Temple’s group.”

Zhuang Bu Fan was the first person Yang Kai had encountered who actually recalled him coming together with Azure Sun Temple. At that time, hundreds of people had gathered in the unnamed mountain valley so remembering Yang Kai’s face from amongst the crowd with just a brief glance was truly an impressive feat.

“The reason why Brother Zhuang has never heard of me is that this Yang is not an Azure Sun Temple disciple. It is only for certain reasons that I was able to accompany Elder Gao here!”

“So, that’s how it is!” Zhuang Bu Fan nodded lightly, not asking anymore. In his opinion, Yang Kai probably had some kind of relationship with a high-level Azure Sun Temple Elder, which was why Gao Xue Ting would bring him to the unnamed mountain valley and why he could enter the Four Seasons Realm.

After pondering for a moment, Zhuang Bu Fan continued, “Originally... this Zhuang’s Junior Brother and Junior Sisters suffering a small loss at Brother Yang’s hand could only be blamed on their inadequate skill and they should not have any grounds to complain, nor should this Zhuang have come seeking redress for them. Regarding this, I hope Brother Yang will be understanding!”

He didn’t show any disdain or disrespect towards Yang Kai just because the latter had a lower cultivation. Instead, he deliberately explained his position and even expressed embarrassment at his current conduct and the conduct of his Juniors, causing the man and the woman Yang Kai had expelled yesterday to turn red with shame.

“I understand!” Yang Kai chuckled, feeling in his heart that this Zhuang Bu Fan was an honourable character...

“However, since I am their Senior Brother, I must act like one!” Zhuang Bu Fan declared as he calmly but solemnly spoke, “Since my Junior Brother and Junior Sister have requested my aid, this Zhuang cannot feign ignorance. It is, after all, a Senior Brother’s duty to shelter his Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters...”

As soon as he said this, the few people gathered around him showed a touch of emotion on their faces as they stared towards his back, like they were gazing up at a tall mountain that could withstand any violent storm, keeping them safe and secure.

“Brother Yang, how do you suggest we solve this matter?” Zhuang Bu Fan looked at Yang Kai faintly and asked.

He seemed unwilling to bully the weak, so he handed the initiative directly to Yang Kai, his words demonstrating both magnanimity and incomparable self-confidence, as if no matter what Yang Kai decided, he would be able to handle it perfectly.

Yang Kai grinned hearing this and said, “Has Brother Zhuang... heard the whole story of what happened?”

Zhuang Bu Fan nodded, “Yes! They said very clearly that Brother Yang attacked and subdued them before robbing them!”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow and said, “I don’t deny subduing them, but regarding this talk of robbery... hehe, I’m afraid I must disagree!”

“What’s wrong?” Zhuang Bu Fan frowned, seemingly a little displeased, “Is Brother Yang willing to act but unwilling to admit?”

“Nothing of the sort, it’s just that if I haven’t done something, how could I admit to it? Wouldn’t that just be disgracing myself?” Yang Kai looked at the man and woman with an innocent expression and asked, “You two say I robbed you, yes? Then tell me, what exactly did you lose?”

“Uh...” The man heard this and went speechless.

He really hadn’t lost anything. Yang Kai had snatched their Space Rings, but he had returned them after simply checking, a fact he did not clearly explain to Zhuang Bu Fan...

Seeing his expression, Yang Kai immediately understood and laughed, “Brother Zhuang, it seems you really haven’t heard the whole story.”

Zhuang Bu Fan’s face went dark as he turned around and asked the now blushing man, “What happened?”

The man was unable to respond as his eyes darted about, not certain how he should explain.

Zhuang Bu Fan turned to the young woman and asked again, “Junior Sister Xu, were you robbed of anything?”

The woman surnamed Xu bit her red lip and shook her head reluctantly, “No, I was not...”

“And that’s that!” Yang Kai cut in quickly as he turned to Zhuang Bu Fan and said, “They didn’t lose anything, so how could they say I robbed them? As for attacking them... En, how can a cultivator go through life without conflict? Could it be that just because these two are disciples of Orthodoxy Temple, I am unable to make a move against them?” At this point, Yang Kai’s voice sank as his expression became stern as he said, “Furthermore, there is a reason why I had to subdue them.”

“Because of the spirit flower behind you?” Zhuang Bu Fan was a sharp individual so he immediately understood the situation.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai said in a serious tone, “With Brother Zhuang’s eyesight, he can probably see that this spirit flower has yet to mature. Picking it prematurely will greatly damage its medicinal properties, so I have been guarding this place to avoid some people who are unable to judge its value properly destroying it. Over the last few days, I have expelled several such individuals, and when your Junior Brother and Junior Sister came here yesterday...”

“En, you don’t need to say anything more, I can surmise what happened next,” Zhuang Bu Fan nodded lightly.

His Junior Brother and Junior Sister, depending on their identity as Orthodoxy Temple disciples, probably arrived here, saw how precious this spirit flower was and how low Yang Kai’s cultivation was, then immediately tried to drive him away, but had the tables turned on them. After being embarrassed, they had become angry out of shame and contacted Zhuang Bu Fan to avenge their grievance.
