This matter had far-reaching implications. If the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer could live peacefully together, it would be good news for the entire universe. At the very least, the Cave Heavens and Paradises wouldn’t have to worry about their fight destroying more Great Territories.

Over the years, too many Great Territories had been destroyed because of their fight, which was a loss for the entire 3,000 Worlds.

Although the Eighth-Order Ancestor didn’t believe Yang Kai’s words, he still said, “You’ll stay here. I’ll go in and have a look.”

It wasn’t the first time he entered the Chaotic Dead Territory; after all, he was a powerful Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Although he couldn’t go deep into the Chaotic Dead Territory, it wasn’t hard for him to momentarily visit the periphery.

In fact, he had entered the Chaotic Dead Territory several times before to examine the situation inside, but he would always quickly withdraw. He wouldn’t be able to bear the repercussions if he stayed there for too long.

There was even once when he obtained a Seventh-Order Blue Crystal almost as big as a washbasin while he was there, which was a huge bonus.

“Be careful, Ancestor,” all of them said with concern.

The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Ancestor nodded gently and fully activated the power of his Small Universe. Then, he summoned a defensive artifact, which turned into a glowing aura that engulfed him, before he plunged into the Territory Gate.

However, barely a few breaths of time later, he dashed out of the Territory Gate.

What shocked them was that the Ancestor was all charred, and his clothes were tattered. Even his hair was in a mess as smoke could be seen billowing from his head. It was as though he had been struck by lightning.

The defensive artifact he had summoned earlier was nowhere to be seen, apparently destroyed in just those few breaths’ time.

A dumbfounded Yang Kai exclaimed, “No way!”

The Chaotic Dead Territory was clearly calm and tranquil when he left, so why did the Ancestor seemingly get struck by lightning after entering it?

While feeling doubtful, Yang Kai dashed into the Chaotic Dead Territory to find out what had happened. The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters couldn’t stop him in time.

In reality, the Chaotic Dead Territory was still calm and quiet. Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were just standing there and staring at the Territory Gate.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Big Sister Lan asked excitedly, “Are you done?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s not something that can be completed so quickly. I came back not long after I left, so I still need some time.”

Big Brother Huang frowned, “Why did you come back when you’re not done with your task?”

Yang Kai asked, “Did you two see anything just now?”

Big Sister Lan tilted her head, “Are you talking about that old man? I was shocked when he suddenly barged in, so I gave him a little smack. I didn’t do anything else.”

[Her little smack almost shocked the life out of that old man, literally…]

Yang Kai didn’t know what to say, so he could only try to persuade them, “Please don’t hit him so hard next time. He meant no harm; he just wanted to have a look inside.”

Big Brother Huang snorted, “He should consider himself lucky that he wasn’t killed. Tell him not to come in again. We didn’t settle accounts with him when he came in several times before.”

“Good good.” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. It seemed that Big Brother Huang didn’t welcome outsiders into the Chaotic Dead Territory.

He then turned around and bolted out.

Although the Ancestor’s head had been struck, he wasn’t at risk of losing his life. When he saw that Yang Kai come out all safe and sound while he was burnt and battered, he couldn’t help but feel indignant despite being an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai explained, “The thing is… the two of them don’t want to be bothered by anyone. They were displeased when you suddenly appeared, Ancestor.”

The Ancestor nodded gently, “They didn’t intend to kill me.”

If they wanted to kill him, he would be dead. Although he was injured, it was already the best outcome possible.

What was more shocking to him was that these supreme beings who had lived for countless eons were actually two young kids who looked like they were barely over ten years old.

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn’t have believed it.

Over the years, no one had ever seen the true bodies of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer. He wasn’t sure if what he had seen were their true bodies or just temporary forms they had manifested.

Although he was stunned, he could confirm that the Chaotic Dead Territory was indeed safe now as no horrifying shockwaves were rippling across it. The entire Chaotic Dead Territory was eerily calm.

It seemed that what the young man had said was true.

Suppressing his excitement, he asked, “You said you’ve found a new game for them. Is there anything we can do to help?”

It was wonderful news that the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer had stopped fighting. At the very least, they wouldn’t have to worry about more Great Territories getting destroyed.

Upon noticing the change in the Ancestor’s attitude, the other Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters gazed at Yang Kai with solemn expressions.

Yang Kai replied, “I could use your help actually.”

“Go ahead.”

“The thing is, the game requires a vast area for them to play freely. However, I’m sure you know that there’s nothing else but the endless void in the Chaotic Dead Territory. Hence, I’ve been tasked with looking for a new board for them to play on.”

The Ancestor pondered on it for a moment before nodding, “I understand. Come with me.”

Upon finishing his words, he led the way.

Yang Kai followed closely.

A few hours later, a gigantic Universe World came into their sight. The Ancestor pointed at the Universe World and asked, “How about this place?”

“It’s good enough. Are there no people living here?”

The Ancestor replied, “There were some residents in the past, but they moved out decades ago. There are no Humans living in this place now. Perhaps there are some low-level beasts.”

Yang Kai nodded, “In that case, please make a move to split up this Universe World so that it’s easier to send into the Chaotic Dead Territory.”

Upon realising Yang Kai’s intentions, the Ancestor raised his hand and pointed two fingers at the gigantic Universe World.

As the majestic World Force burst forth, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel all his pores tightening. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It wasn’t the first time he witnessed an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master making a move. When he was previously hunted down by Bright Sun Divine Monarch, Cheng Yang, the other party had repeatedly attempted to kill him.

Nevertheless, that was different from the current situation. It wasn’t until this moment that Yang Kai realised how formidable an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master truly was.

Following the Ancestor’s move, a light penetrated the void and caused the entire Universe World to shake. It then split into shattered Spirit Provinces of different sizes.

The emotions in Yang Kai’s heart undulated. As a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he could also destroy a Universe World, but he could not do it as accurately and effortlessly as the Ancestor beside him.

This was the difference between their Realms.

The force the Ancestor exerted was ingenious. Although the Universe World had turned into countless shattered Spirit Provinces, they were not a jumbled mess; instead, they seemed to have been neatly cut into pieces.

It went to show that this Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master had precise control over his power.

“I heard that your Small Universe has materialised,” the Ancestor suddenly commented.

Yang Kai didn’t know where the old man had heard it from, but his Small Universe had been probed by numerous High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, so it wasn’t really a secret now.

Therefore, he replied frankly, “Yes.”

The Ancestor went on to say, “In that case, we’ll store these shattered Spirit Provinces in our Small Universes and take them into the Chaotic Dead Territory; however, you must be careful. Use your own power to isolate these Universe World pieces; otherwise, your World Force will be contaminated. When that happens, you’ll have to spend quite some effort to get rid of it.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai replied respectfully.

The two of them made a move together and transferred these shattered Spirit Provinces into their Small Universes. Since Yang Kai was weaker, he couldn’t keep many of the pieces. In the end, he only kept 30% of them while the rest were taken by the Ancestor.

They then activated their own powers to suppress the World Force contained in those shattered Spirit Provinces so that they wouldn’t merge with their Small Universes.

Half a day had passed when they returned to the Territory Gate.

In front of the Territory Gate, the Ancestor was hesitant while looking at Yang Kai with a pair of hopeful eyes.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai said, “Please come with me, Ancestor. It’ll save us time by completing it all at once.”

The Ancestor asked nervously, “But the two of them inside…”

Yang Kai secretly sneered, thinking that the Ancestor was clearly eager to have a look inside the Chaotic Dead Territory; however, he was still reeling from the memory of what had just happened to him. Without Yang Kai’s assurance, he wouldn’t dare to go in again, lest he be killed on the spot.

Therefore, Yang Kai reassured him by saying, “Don’t worry, Ancestor. We’re going in to help. You just have to follow me closely, and they won’t make a move on you again.”

It was then that the Ancestor nodded, “Sorry for the trouble then, Martial Nephew.”

He couldn’t help but feel his emotions undulating. Since time immemorial, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had been trying to come into contact with the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, but no one had succeeded so far. The Chaotic Dead Territory was too dangerous, and no one was able to have a talk with these two powerful beings.

Would he be the one to make history on this day?

Certainly, he wasn’t the first person to do so, but Yang Kai wasn’t a part of the Cave Heavens and Paradises after all, nor could he represent the aforementioned great forces.

After telling the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters to keep guard in this place, the Ancestor followed Yang Kai closely and entered the Chaotic Dead Territory for the second time.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were still waiting in the same spot, but their eyes brightened when they saw Yang Kai return.

Their armies were ready for the next battle, so they desperately needed a large place where they could fight against one another freely.

However, when Big Brother Huang saw the Ancestor who was behind Yang Kai, he frowned with displeasure.

The nervous Ancestor quickly saluted them, “Greetings, Seniors.”

Although he was an old man who had lived for a long time, he wouldn’t dare to pull rank in front of these two. He hung his head low and stared at his own feet in a respectful manner while speaking to them.

Big Brother Huang directly ignored him while a displeased Big Sister Lan snorted, “Why did you call us Seniors? Call me Big Sister!”

The title ‘Big Sister’ seemed to be the sweetest music to her ears.

Upon hearing that, the Ancestor was dumbfounded.

[Why did she suddenly ask me to call her Big Sister?] He turned to look at Yang Kai in the hope that the other party could give him some clarity.

Yang Kai thus secretly spoke to him, “These two are a bit eccentric. Just do as they say.”

The Ancestor coughed and then said respectfully, “Greetings, Big Sister.”

“Good!” Big Sister Lan was elated.

Just then, Big Brother Huang snorted.

The Ancestor instantly got the hint and quickly followed up, “Greetings, Big Brother.”

It was only then that Big Brother Huang sported a milder expression.

On the other hand, the Ancestor was clearly embarrassed. He didn’t mind calling them Seniors as it was the most common form of address, but he was puzzled as to why he was asked to call them Big Brother and Big Sister. Although it seemed like he had taken advantage of them, the other old people of his rank would surely laugh at him if the news was spread.

At that moment, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling gleeful. It was just like how one would feel much better when he saw that he wasn’t the only one who was suffering from some indignity. At the very least, Yang Kai wasn’t the only one who felt ashamed now as someone else was also forced to call these two young children Big Brother and Big Sister.
