After a short while, the big hand directly pinched the neck of the sword-holding cultivator. Under the horrified gaze of this man, the owner of the hand holding his throat smiled grimly as he began condensing his Source Qi fiercely.

*Kacha...*

With a crisp sound, the neck of the sword-wielding cultivator was directly crushed and his head drooped softly.

*Si...*

Gasps sounded as all the cultivators rushing towards the round-faced woman stopped in amazement, staring at the Master of the big hand in horror, with shock on their faces.

They were all Dao Source Realm cultivators, but the owner of this large hand had just casually reached out and killed one of them. This brutal and violent way of killing, crushing another with overwhelming strength, was naturally shocking.

“Luo Yuan!” Someone shouted loudly.

It was none other than Luo Yuan of Eight Paths Sect, a previously unknown figure before the opening of the Four Seasons Realm. Over just a few dozen days though, this young man’s prestige and fame had risen enough for him to be ranked amongst the top rising stars of the Southern Territory.

And he had the strength and capital to warrant such a reputation!

To a certain extent, Luo Yuan and Wu Chang were similar, both of them ferocious and brutal, people no one wanted to provoke.

At this moment though, Luo Yuan was actually standing in front of the round-faced woman and had even killed a man. How could the remaining cultivators dare to move? The Extraordinary Treasure Pill was indeed precious, but one needed their life first to enjoy it.

“Luo Yuan, do you want to snatch this Extraordinary Treasure Pill too?”

This was the question on everyone’s mind. If it was true, Luo Yuan would become the greatest enemy of everyone here for if he was not dealt with, no one would be able to obtain the Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

This was also quite possible as a treasure as precious as the Extraordinary Treasure Pill would be coveted by anyone, so Luo Yuan coming to snatch it was understandable.

Xiao Chen, Wu Chang, Xia Sheng, and the other peak-level characters did not take action so far. On the one hand, they were concerned about their Sect’s and their own face, while on the other hand, they probably disdained to act this way, but Luo Yuan was different. His Eight Paths Sect was only a medium-sized Sect, so he had no such scruples. He was not well-known before now and could act however he pleased without worrying about his reputation.

For a time, everyone’s expressions turned gloomy as they secretly grumbled to themselves.

However...

What happened next surprised everyone.

“Luo... Senior Brother Luo...” A weak voice called out from behind Luo Yuan. Naturally, it was the round-faced woman.

“Senior Brother?”

“Could it be that...”

“No way!”

At that moment, all the cultivators who had previously attacked the round-faced woman began sweating and turning pale. A few of the more timid ones even began to shiver.

Judging by the way the round-faced woman addressed Luo Yuan, everyone vaguely realized that these two belonged to the same Sect. That is to say... This round-faced woman was also a disciple of Eight Paths Sect!

Bullying Luo Yuan’s Junior Sister right in front of his face... how could he just let such an offence go?

However, this way, everyone also understood why Luo Yuan had taken action just now, not only that, but why he had been ruthless enough to kill someone directly...

For a time, the dozen or so cultivators wore anxious looks as they glanced around at each other worriedly.

“Brother Luo, this one was unaware that this Sister was from your noble Sect and has accidentally offended her, please forgive me!” One person stepped forward with a forced smile on his face, cupped his fists, and spoke to Luo Yuan.

“Brother Luo. This is all just a misunderstanding, a big misunderstanding...”

“Yes yes, if I had known that this Sister was related to Brother Luo, I would not have dared to act so aggressively.”

The group of people all began apologizing profusely, lest Luo Yuan decide to settle accounts with them here and now.

Luo Yuan swept his eyes across the crowd coldly before he shouted, “A group of trash! Scram!”

Although these words weren’t pleasing to hear, everyone scurried away as if they had just been granted amnesty.

“Senior Brother Luo...” On the contrary, it was the round-faced woman who did not feel any joy after being rescued, instead just staring towards Luo Yuan’s back with anxiety as she called out softly.

“What did I tell you?” Luo Yuan turned around and glared at her coldly, “After entering the Four Seasons Realm, I am me, you are you, don’t make trouble for me. Have you forgotten?”

“No... no!” The round-faced woman waved her hands quickly, as if she wanted to explain something, but when she met Luo Yuan’s frigid eyes, she couldn’t help lowering her head and biting her lip, “I’m sorry!”

“Next time, you’re on your own!” Luo Yuan snorted coldly.

“I understand,” the round-faced woman kept her head down as she gripped her clothes tightly, like a child who had done something wrong.

“Hmph, put your best into it!” Luo Yuan snorted coldly and turned to leave.

“Wait!” The round-faced woman quickly reached out and grabbed Luo Yuan’s sleeve.

“What?” Luo Yuan frowned as he snapped impatiently.

“This... is for you!” The round-faced woman raised her head, squeezed out a smile, and held the Extraordinary Treasure Pill she had just obtained from Yang Kai out to Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan’s expression turned to one of shock as he stared at the round-faced woman in a daze.

A breeze blew past as the crowd atop the mountain fell completely silent.

“So, she planned to gift it...” Yang Kai looked at this scene and muttered to himself, “And to Luo Yuan at that...”

When the woman exchanged for the Extraordinary Treasure Pill with him earlier, she said that she had another use for this Spirit Pill. Yang Kai didn’t know what she was planning at the time, but now everything was clear.

She hadn’t tried to obtain the Extraordinary Treasure Pill for herself, but for Luo Yuan.

And from beginning to the end, she had not revealed her intentions, even when she was being besieged by many people, she did not ask Luo Yuan for help. Only after she was safe did she willingly try to offer up this Spirit Pill, which all Dao Source Realm cultivators coveted, to Luo Yuan.

Everyone could see that this young woman was looking at Luo Yuan with soft eyes filled with clear love and worship. Her expression and demeanour told everyone that she was willing to offer her everything for Luo Yuan, so what did a mere Extraordinary Treasure Pill count for?

At this moment, the round-faced woman seemed to shine dazzlingly, and Luo Yuan, who was pierced by this light, couldn’t help having his face twitch as he had difficulty looking straight ahead.

“Ah... Another woman who lost herself in love. No one can save her now...” Xia Sheng said with emotion.

Murong Xiao Xiao, who was standing next to him, was already greatly moved, tears crystallizing at the corners of her beautiful eyes, no one able to tell what she was thinking.

“Haa... what a terrible farce, and everyone else making so much fuss over it!” Xiao Bai Yi said coldly.

“Senior Brother!” Murong Xiao Xiao glared at him.

“Hehe...” On the other side, Lan Xun also seemed to have some feelings about this as she pursed her lips and smiled, “I really didn’t expect... someone would adore Luo Yuan like this.”

“Some cheap, disgraceful tricks!” Xiao Chen said sourly from the side, looking at the round-faced woman with a tinge of pity, “Unfortunately, she fell in love with someone like Luo Yuan, this woman must be blind.”

“What’s wrong?” Lan Xun turned his head and glanced at him, “You believe this kind of display is somehow disgraceful?”

“I didn’t mean that, please don’t misunderstand, Princess,” Xiao Chen quickly adjusted his expression, turning a tender look to Lan Xun as he declared solemnly, “If I had obtained an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, I would definitely...”

“I’ve already taken one,” Lan Xun interrupted him impatiently before he could finish his cheap words.

Xiao Chen murmured, “I just wanted to express that...”

“You... what are your intentions here?” In front of everyone’s eyes though, Luo Yuan, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly shouted.

“I... I don’t have any other meaning,” the round-faced woman didn’t know why Luo Yuan looked angry and she couldn’t help but panic as she tried to explain, “I just wanted to give Senior Brother this Extraordinary Treasure Pill...”

“To give it to me?” Luo Yuan sneered.

The round-faced woman nodded heavily.

“Nonsense!” Luo Yuan didn’t show the slightest appreciation and instead laughed, “What? You thought you could make me feel indebted to you by giving me this Extraordinary Treasure Pill?” At this point, his face turned harsh as he shouted, “Listen well! This Luo Yuan will not be bound by anything or anyone! Not by you, not by Eight Paths Sect, not by Heaven itself! I, Luo Yuan, will eventually stand at the pinnacle of this world, rule supreme, and look down upon all the world’s heroes!”

“I... I didn’t...” the round-faced woman turned anxious as tears began forming in her eyes. Anxiously, she tried to call out, “I just...”

“Save your breath! I have no interest in this Extraordinary Treasure Pill. Even without this Spirit Pill, I will still break through to the Emperor Realm!” Luo Yuan snorted coldly, “You’d best discard any wicked ideas you might have or don’t blame me for disregarding our status as fellow disciples!”

Hearing this, the round-faced woman finally burst into tears. Falling silent, two lines of tears fell down her cheeks, like broken pearls, her beautiful eyes filled with innocence and heartache.

“That bastard!” Xia Sheng looked at this scene and couldn’t help cursing.

The sacrifice this round-faced woman was making was simply amazing; after all, as a Dao Source Realm cultivator, the Extraordinary Treasure Pill was extremely useful to her and if she were to take it now, her hopes of breaking through to the Emperor Realm would definitely increase dramatically. This was a major event that was related to her very future.

But she disregarded all of that without hesitation and only thought about gifting this Extraordinary Treasure Pill to Luo Yuan! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Even just now, in order to not cause trouble for Luo Yuan, even though she was facing grave danger, she didn’t cry out for help...

Putting herself in such a position simply for the sake of another, this woman’s love for Luo Yuan could not be any more obvious.

Any normal man would have been greatly moved by this kind of devotion... even the most stoic and ignorant of men would have shown some tenderness.

However, Luo Yuan only reacted with fierce hostility, which naturally caused Xia Sheng to be extremely dissatisfied.

Even if Luo Yuan didn’t want to accept this Extraordinary Treasure Pill, he didn’t need to act so cruelly.

“Waste!” Murong Xiao Xiao cast a contemptuous look towards Luo Yuan without the slightest hesitation.

“A terrible farce indeed...” Xiao Chen smiled lightly, his true thoughts difficult to read.
