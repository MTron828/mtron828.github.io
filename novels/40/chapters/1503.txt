Chapter 1503, Emperor Artifact

Qian Tong was blaming himself for being careless and falling into his enemy’s hands, but most of all for dragging down Yang Kai in the process.

“Haha, Elder Qian is being too distant. Since this Junior came to Shadowed Star more than ten years ago, he has received much care from both of you. Now that the two Seniors are in trouble, this Junior will not stand idly by, let alone that this matter is mainly my fault. How could I just ignore your plight?” Yang Kai grinned brightly.

“Excellent! Excellent!” Fang Peng laughed while clapping, “Sect Master Yang is a man of deep sentiment, understanding how to show gratitude, this old master is ashamed of his inferiority!”

“Enough nonsense, you’ve obviously been planning this a long time and have even taken such extreme measures all to capture this Sect Master. Let those two go and this Sect Master will go with you!” Yang Kai turned a glare back towards Fang Peng.

“Haha, this old master is grateful for Sect Master Yang’s cooperation. Naturally, we will release these two, but before then, I must ask Sect Master Yang to allow this old master’s subordinates to place some seals to avoid any accidents. This is good for both you and us, what does Sect Master Yang think?” Fang Peng looked at Yang Kai with a smile, a trace of vigilance flashing across the depths of his eyes.

Yang Kai had given up far too easily.

This made Fang Peng suspect something was wrong.

He had ordered the capture of Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu to coerce Yang Kai into surrendering, but he hadn’t really expected this boy to just surrender without a fight. Was this boy so righteous and benevolent? Fang Peng was a little skeptical.

If it was him, he would never do this, his life was more important than anyone else’s, why would he give it up for others?

As long as Yang Kai’s strength wasn’t sealed, Fang Peng wouldn’t be able to relax.

“No problem!” Yang Kai still agreed easily though, “Sect Master Fang can act at will.”

Fang Peng’s brow furrowed before immediately giving a signal. Two Third-Order Origin Returning Realm masters then approached Yang Kai from left and right, both of them remaining highly vigilant of Yang Kai suddenly going back on his word, but even when they approached to within half a metre of him, Yang Kai still didn’t move, instead just sneering towards them.

This made the two of them blush from their overly cautious behaviour.

It was truly embarrassing for them to be so on edge when facing a mere Junior.

There was no need for Fang Peng to issue any orders; the two masters both formed a series of hand seals before placing their palms on Yang Kai one after another.

A seal instantly formed inside of Yang Kai’s body, causing his aura to rapidly deflate.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when they saw this. No matter how Heavenly defying Yang Kai’s methods were, he could not make any more waves without the ability to use his Saint Qi.

Fang Peng was overjoyed.

Although he had lost a lot of manpower during this operation, in the end, they had succeeded.

However, at that moment, a mutation suddenly occurred.

A scorching power suddenly rose from where Yang Kai stood, and in the next moment, dark Demonic Flame enveloped Yang Kai, making him look like a burning ball of black fire.

Yang Kai’s aura, which just disappeared, suddenly surged upwards again.

“Impossible!” The two masters who had placed the seals on Yang Kai just now exclaimed in shock, their eyes fully rounded.

When they had applied the seals, they had used their full strength, so even a cultivator in the same realm as them would not be able to break through them in short order, yet the Saint Qi in Yang Kai’s body was actually so pure and vigorous that he was instantly able to free himself.

With horrified gazes, the pair quickly tried to retreat, lest Yang Kai suddenly attack.

However, Yang Kai did not try to stop them at all. Instead, his body flickered, as if he were about to escape.

“You’re not the only one who is proficient in the Dao of Space here! This old master long expected you to try this, halt for this old master!” An angry shout came out and the figure of Heaven Battling Union’s Great Elder Mo Xiao Sheng appeared strangely beside Yang Kai. At the same time, a strange energy fluctuation spread from his body, covering Yang Kai.

Space Force!

While everyone else relaxed, Mo Xiao Sheng still paid close attention to Yang Kai’s movements so he could react to any move the boy made.

He had full confidence he could stop Yang Kai! Although he knew that Yang Kai also cultivated the Dao of Space, he had been immersed in this field for countless years and was certain he would not lose out to a mere brat. His pride could not be so easily trampled.

He wanted to prove to everyone who was superior here.

Space Force swirled around Yang Kai, disturbing The Void, and creating an invisible shackle that forced Yang Kai’s disappearing body to re-materialize.

Mo Xiao Sheng smiled proudly.

But in the next moment, his smile stiffened and was quickly replaced with a dumbfounded expression.

“Showing off meagre skills before an expert!” Yang Kai coldly snorted before his figure disappeared again.

“How?” Mo Xiao Sheng stood there dumbfounded, unable to even understand how Yang Kai had broken through his blockade or even when he had done so. At that moment, a terrifying thought suddenly flashed across his mind, causing him to lose his ability to think calmly.

[Can it be? This little brat’s comprehension of the Dao of Space is greater than my own?]

Frightening energy fluctuations suddenly surged as a short, pitch-black arrow suddenly appeared out of thin air and shot towards Qu Zheng like a bolt of lightning.

No one dared to underestimate the horrific killing power behind this small arrow.

The middle-aged Second-Order Origin Returning Realm woman from Heaven Battling Union had died tragically after being hit by this attack, unable to even put up any resistance, dying in an instant, so Qu Zheng was well aware of how powerful this short arrow was.

Flurried, he didn’t dare resist this arrowhead on and quickly used his movement skill to dodge.

*Xiu...*

The short, pitch-black arrow scratched Qu Zheng’s body as it flew past, but another Origin Returning Realm master not far away was not so lucky. In the next instant, the short arrow pierced his chest and he instantly died.

“Where is he?” Fang Peng yelled, releasing his Divine Sense without reservation. Soon, he found traces of Yang Kai. He did not know when, but Yang Kai had actually rushed over towards Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu and was rapidly approaching them now.

The short arrow just now was just a way to force Qu Zheng to withdraw while Yang Kai’s ultimate goal was clearly to rescue Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

“This is bad!” Fang Peng’s face darkened, and he shouted sharply, “Stop him!”

“Those who stand in my way will die!” Yang Kai roared, raising his hands, and releasing two pitch-blade blade-like attacks that instantly cut towards the heads of the two enemies escorting Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

These two saw Yang Kai as a tiger descending from the mountain and their hearts filled with panic. The two of them wanted to avoid these two bladelike attacks, but having received Fang Peng’s order, they had to grit their teeth and stand their ground while summoning their artifacts.

A golden light suddenly blossomed and before these two had time to move, they suddenly noticed that Yang Kai’s left eye was covered in a golden halo and was releasing an irresistible majesty.

Within this golden light, there was a faintly lingering multi-coloured glow.

The golden light and multi-coloured glow seemed to possess a magical power that made it seem like their Souls were being pulled into an endless abyss, causing them to freeze up, unable to move or even speak.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation was Great Demon God’s Divine Ability, which Yang Kai had inherited and combined with the Coloured Glass Bead that Dai Yuan had given him. The current Demon Eye of Annihilation combined with Coloured Glass Divine Light was even more powerful than before.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation was capable of suppressing Souls while the Coloured Glass Divine Light had the power to restrain one’s body and Soul, the two naturally complemented and enhanced one another.

Although these two people could quickly break through this kind of suppression and restraint, a short pause was all Yang Kai needed.

The pitch-black Space Blade accurately passed through the two of them and silently left crescent-like cuts on their bodies.

Their flesh, blood, bones, five viscera, and six organs which were touched were all banished to The Void!

Everything happened in a flash, from Yang Kai using his Feather Spirit Arrow to repel Qu Zheng to releasing his Space Blades to kill the two who were escorting Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu all occurring in the blink of an eye.

In the next moment, he was already in front of Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, grabbing each of them with one hand and pushing his Space Force again to leave this place.

But at that moment, an angry shout rang out.

“Wishful thinking!” From the crowd, an old man with grey hair wearing a brown robe stepped forward as Saint Qi surged from his body and a longan sized bead appeared in his hand.

As soon as this bead appeared, everyone paled.

Because the aura which was pulsing from this bead made everyone tremble with unease. Regardless of the strength of this aura, its feel was all too familiar.

“Emperor Pressure!” Fang Peng’s eyes narrowed as he called out in surprise.

It was indeed Emperor Pressure, the same power which was released by the Emperor Garden; however, this Emperor Pressure was nowhere nearly as strong. Still, this coercive force made any who felt it feel humble and small, as if by the pressure alone was able to grind them down into dust.

The grey-haired old man’s Saint Qi surged as it poured into the bead he was carrying and with a great roar, it transformed into a stream of light that shot towards Yang Kai at phenomenal speed.

Mid-air, this bead split into two, then into four, then into eight...

Soon, the sky was filled with identical beads that all but enveloped the space around Yang Kai. This was not the end though; each of these beads seemed to be real, nothing like an illusion, and each one was releasing terrifying arcs.

The sound of thunder was deafening as these arcs of lighting flew out like silk threads towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, his expression never looked more solemn.

He felt the touch of death coming from these lightning bolts and instantly understood that if he could not find a way to handle them, he would immediately die.

With his heart pounding violently, Yang Kai did not dare hold back, summoning his Purple Shield and activating its sandstorm ability before releasing his Firebird Artifact Spirit and transforming it into a fiery red light that wrapped around him, Qian Tong, and Fei Zhi Tu.

Next, Yang Kai released nearly a hundred Golden Blood Threads from his hands before weaving them together to form an airtight net around them.

Even after successively deploying three powerful layers of protection, Yang Kai still felt uneasy.

But there was no more time for him to react as the countless lightning arcs had already reached him.
