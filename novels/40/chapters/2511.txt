“Really? Junior likes to speak nonsense when he is unhappy, and might even compose a fantastical story about the events that happened today. I might pass on the story to the storytellers in major restaurants and tea shops in the Eastern Territory to let them publicize Senior Li’s majesty and prestige. I have even come up with a title. What does Senior Li think of ‘The Daily lives of Jiu Feng and her loyal servant on Spirit Beast Island’?”

Li Wu Yi was furious, “Didn’t you just say that you didn’t see anything? Junior, are you not a man of his word!”

“I suddenly remembered I saw something,” Yang Kai replied leisurely.

“Despicable!” Li Wu Yi was appalled.

“I was forced to be like this!” Yang Kai drawled lazily.

Jiu Feng was shaking with laughter, extremely entertained by them.

“Good, very good!” Li Wu Yi spoke madly and gritted his teeth at Yang Kai, “You leave this King no choice but to teach you a lesson. Little brat, take this!”

When the words fell, he raised his hand, and a stream of light shot towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his brows in alert, but he did not evade. Instead, he stretched out his hand to grab this stream of light. He jolted slightly as soon as the stream of light touched his hand, but his eyes narrowed swiftly as he quickly put away the item he had just caught.

“Now, you know how powerful this King is. Don’t you dare to speak nonsense and corrupt the reputation of this King,” Li Wu Yi snorted coldly.

Yang Kai cupped his fists with a grin, acknowledging him, “Junior’s cultivation is nowhere near to Senior Li’s. Please forgive me for all of the earlier offences, Senior Li.”

Li Wu Yi waved his hand widely, “This King is very generous, and will not bother to argue with the likes of you.”

Jiu Feng looked at the two scornfully, grimacing, “You two sure are having a good time.”

Li Wu Yi snorted, “I just taught a Junior, who has an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities, to be a little more humble. If Great Aunt has any opinion, this Li would be glad to hear it.”

Jiu Feng snorted coldly, her sharp dazzling eyes staring at Yang Kai for a long time before revealing a trace of admiration, “You were only in the First-Order Dao Source Realm the last time we met, I did not expect you would break through to the Emperor Realm in just a few years. This Queen underestimated you.”

Undoubtedly, only a genius would be able to be promoted from First-Order Dao Source Realm to the First-Order Emperor Realm in such a short time, and to have such a solid foundation, radiating a pure and strong aura without any sign of instability.

“Senior is flattering me, it was merely a series of opportunities and coincidences that allowed Junior to progress at this speed,” Yang Kai said modestly.

Jiu Feng cautioned him, “But the First-Order Emperor Realm is just the first step to the peak of the Martial Dao. You still have a long way to go. Stay humble and focused.”

Yang Kai looked at her with a solemn expression, and quickly responded, “I will keep Senior’s advice deep in my heart.”

Although it was just a small comment, with her level of strength, if Jiu Feng was not optimistic about Yang Kai’s future, she would not even bother to say anything. Any encouragement or warning from her was already a great honour.

Jiu Feng nodded gently, obviously satisfied with his attitude, she then narrowed her sharp eyes at Yang Kai with a dangerous aura, penetrating through his body right at Mo Xiao Qi, who was hiding behind him as she snarled coldly, “Come out from there!”

Mo Xiao Qi stepped out from behind Yang Kai unwillingly, pouting. Her eyes darted around erratically, as if looking for a way to escape.

Jiu Feng wanted to laugh but was angry at the same time, “Did you think that Uncle Li and Aunty Feng could not see you hiding behind him? Do you think we’re blind, or are you blind?”

Mo Xiao Qi retorted angrily, “Wouldn’t it be the same wherever I hide when you’re so strong?”

“You dare talk back?” Jiu Feng raised her brow and yelled, “You’re so wilful, I think you’re itching for good disciplining.”

Mo Xiao Qi pouted and looked at Li Wu Yi pitifully, whining, “Uncle Li, Aunty Feng wants to beat me, you have to help me.”

“She dares?” Li Wu Yi was enraged and his aura suddenly surged. His lickspittle attitude was swept away, replaced by a ferocious demeanour dazzling like the sun.

Yang Kai was secretly awe-inspired, slightly aware of the huge gap between him and these top veteran Emperor Realm Masters.

“Hm?” Jiu Feng let out a light tone from her lips as she glanced sideways at Li Wu Yi.

Li Wu Yi snorted, “Don’t be afraid Xiao Qi, if she really hits you, I will, I will…”

“You will?” Jiu Feng looked at him scornfully.

Li Wu Yi immediately broke into a smile, “I’ll help you to grab Xiao Qi and let you beat her as much as you like!”

*Gezhi gezhi…*

Mo Xiao Qi stood beside Yang Kai, her teeth grinding violently.

At this moment, Li Wu Yi suddenly shot a pensive look at Mo Xiao Qi before his face changed drastically and he asked, “Xiao Qi, did you release the seal?”

“What?” Jiu Feng jumped, and flickered to Mo Xiao Qi’s side in an instant, grabbing her and examining her carefully.

Soon, Jiu Feng realized that Mo Xiao Qi had indeed released the Divine Soul Seal and blood drained from her beautiful face as she reprimanded, “Why did you release the seal? Were you in any life-threatening danger? Which bastard dared to lay his hands on you!?”

A burst of overwhelming Emperor Pressure suddenly exploded from Jiu Feng, one laced with extreme hostility and murderous intent, as if she was preparing to slaughter a hated enemy.

Yang Kai retreated several tens of metres shakily, his heart pounding hard in his chest, almost unable to breathe.

Zhang Ruo Xi exclaimed loudly, retreating even farther away than Yang Kai did. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Who was it? Tell Aunty Feng! I will kill him and his entire family now!” The air burned around Jiu Feng as she released tangible murderous intent.

Li Wu Yi treaded down toward them from the air, his face so gloomy that one could shave a layer of frost off of it. Although he did not speak, his murderous intent was even thicker and more prominent than Jiu Feng’s.

Mo Xiao Qi’s Divine Soul Seal was her ultimate trump card, one that would be impossible to release if she did not face life-threatening danger. In other words, she must have been at risk of dying in the Shattered Star Sea at some point.

The two Masters had watched Mo Xiao Qi grow since she was born, so how could they tolerate someone bullying her? It was only natural for them to react so strongly when they noticed the Divine Soul Seal had been unlocked, releasing their murderous intent so violently as if no one else mattered.

Mo Xiao Qi did not dare to be up-front with them at the sight of their terrifying expressions, so she bit her lip and mumbled, “No one was trying to kill me, I just accidentally released it.”

“Impossible!” Jiu Feng snorted coldly, “Sir personally sealed the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly’s Soul with the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal. There is only one condition to release it, and that is if your life is threatened.”

Li Wu Yi coaxed her, “Be a good girl Xiao Qi and tell Uncle Li and Aunty Feng clearly what happened.”

“It’s really nothing, it really was just an accident,” Mo Xiao Qi flailed her arms about repeatedly as she tried to explain.

Jiu Feng snorted again, knowing that there must be a reason behind Mo Xiao Qi persisting with this ridiculous story. She thus turned away from Mo Xiao Qi to question Yang Kai, “Boy, since you are here with Xiao Qi, that means that you were travelling together in the Shattered Star Sea. Tell this Queen what happened!”

Yang Kai sighed as he began, “Two Seniors, please don’t misunderstand, I was the reason that Little Sister Xiao Qi released her seal.”

“Because of you?” Li Wu Yi frowned in suspicion, “Did you try to kill Xiao Qi?”

[That’s impossible. Although Xiao Qi is naive, she is not a fool. If this boy had really tried to assassinate her, how could she still be together with him? She would have run away as far as she could.]

Jiu Feng coldly demanded, “Be specific!”

Yang Kai nodded, sorted out his thoughts a little before reiterating the situation from when Mo Xiao Qi lost control of her emotions when she had mistakenly believed he had died, relaying every detail of how the Divine Soul Seal was released and what happened subsequently.

When he finished, Jiu Feng and Li Wu Yi could not help exchanging astonished looks with each other.

They never knew that Mo Xiao Qi could release the Divine Soul Seal because someone else was in danger. However, they recalled that their Sir had once explained to them that Xiao Qi could only unlock the seal upon perceiving life-threatening danger, but did not specifically say that it had to be Xiao Qi’s own life.

If that was the case, Xiao Qi seemed to value this boy very much, placing his safety in equal importance to her own, which led her to release her seal when he was in peril.

When their eyes met, the two felt a strange feeling fill their hearts as they comprehended each other’s thoughts.

They turned their heads to throw a vicious look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suppressed a shiver, not daring to say anything.

“How did the Divine Soul Seal get re-sealed? This sealing technique is not the same one as Sir’s, but it is an extremely profound technique. Was… it you?” Jiu Feng asked incredulously.

Yang Kai chuckled in reply, “Junior is not capable of doing something like that. It was someone else who re-did the seal.”

“Oh?” Li Wu Yi suddenly became interested, “Is there someone among the younger generation who could seal a Divine Spirit’s Soul? Let’s hear it, I would like to know who could be so capable.”

“That person was not a Junior, that person was…” Yang Kai twitched the corner of his mouth, hesitating. He then pursed his lips and mouthed the three words gently.

Li Wu Yi and Jiu Feng were flabbergasted, looking at Yang Kai blankly.

Yang Kai continued faintly, “There is no doubt, he is that Sir who you’re both thinking of.”

“Impossible!” Jiu Feng shouted, “Emperor Realm Masters cannot enter the Shattered Star Sea. Even if that Sir has profound strength, he can’t bypass that restriction.”

Li Wu Yi also looked pensive, “That’s correct, that Sir has always been secretive in his whereabouts. Why would he show up in a place like the Shattered Star Sea? The Source Strength there is indeed a good thing, but it should be nothing in that Sir’s eyes.”

Yang Kai contemplated for a moment before his expression turned serious and he continued, “If it was anyone else that asked, I would not go into any further detail; after all, this matter cannot be spoken of lightly, but since two Seniors are from Spirit Beast Island, then I will disclose all that I know. Hopefully, two Seniors will relay the information from the Shattered Star Sea to Sir Martial Beast once you return to Spirit Beast Island. Perhaps Sir Martial Beast can help find a solution.”

“Find a solution? A solution to what?” Jiu Feng stared at Yang Kai suspiciously, looking puzzled.

“Boy, just what are you trying to say?” Li Wu Yi also looked at him in bewilderment.
