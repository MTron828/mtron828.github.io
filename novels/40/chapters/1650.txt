Chapter 1650, Take Someone

Inside the white jade ice palace, Luo Hai sat upon a chair with his golden crown on his head, his breathing calm but with a flash of excitement in his eyes.

[Finally, I’ve found you!] Luo Hai exclaimed to himself without showing any outwards signs.

To think that he, a top master at the Second-Order Origin King Realm, one of the strongest in all the Star Field, had pursued a trivial Yang Kai for so long. Not only had this boy broken through his blockade on Green Mountains Star but even managed to escape his tracking after that.

If not for Luo Hai’s incredible patience, he would likely have really let this boy escape by now.

[Now, let’s see where you can run!] Luo Hai said with excitement.

With his strength, there were not many things that could excite him, but an Origin Essence Crystal left behind by the Monster King in the Blood Prison was something he deeply coveted. The Emperor Artifact on Yang Kai was also something Luo Hai desired.

The former could allow him to break through to the Third-Order Origin King Realm while the latter could directly increase his strength!

Once these two treasures landed in his hands, Luo Hai was confident he could become the strongest master in the entire Star Field. When the time came, no one in the Star Field would be able to compete with him!

Everything depended on taking Yang Kai here.

Although Luo Hai concealed his emotions very well, Chi Huo and Luo Li were also Origin Kings, so naturally, they could detect some subtle changes in his mood.

Chi Huo’s expression changed slightly as he wondered just what kind of secrets this little brat named Yang Kai had. If he did not possess something of extreme value, why would Luo Hai be so interested in him?

More than a year ago, Luo Hai suddenly visited Scarlet Wave Star, surprising Chi Huo. Then, Luo Hai had asked Brilliant Flame Sect to search for Yang Kai, further raising Chi Huo’s suspicions. Many times, he had tried to ask why Luo Hai was looking for Yang Kai, but Luo Hai had never given him a straight answer, leaving Chi Huo helpless.

Luo Li was also quite curious about this matter, but more than that, she felt sadness and helplessness.

She could do nothing about Luo Hai and Chi Huo in her current state!

Soon, Yang Kai stepped into the ice palace.

Inside the ice palace, in addition to the three Origin King Realm masters, a dozen or so Elders of Ice Heart Valley stood behind Luo Li.

Additionally, behind Luo Hai and Chi Huo, there was a young man with a sallow complexion and somewhat faint vitality.

The son of Brilliant Flame Sect’s Sect Master, Wei Feng!

At this moment, he was looking around excitedly, as if waiting for someone to arrive. After seeing Su Yan, his expression could not help brightening as an extremely excited look appeared on his face, like a wild dog that just spotted a delicacy, his saliva almost dripping from his mouth.

However, when he saw Su Yan holding hands with Yang Kai in such an intimate manner, his complexion could not help sinking as his gloomy eyes stared at Yang Kai, gleaming with hatred and anger.

[Where did this bastard pop out from!?] Wei Feng was furious seeing anyone dare hold hands with his woman.

In an instant, Wei Feng saw Yang Kai as a dead man and even began fantasizing about how he would torture Yang Kai to death, forcing him to beg for death, teaching him there were some women could not be touched.

“Junior Bing Long greets Sir Luo Hai, greets Senior Chi Huo,” Bing Long elegantly bowed before turning to Luo Li and reporting, “Supreme Elder, I’ve brought the requested person.”

Luo Li gently nodded but did not say anything, her pair of beautiful eyes fixing on Yang Kai as her brow wrinkled lightly.

Sensing her gaze, Yang Kai stared back.

This was the first time he saw the Supreme Elder of Ice Heart Valley, and from the aura she gave off, she was essentially on par with the red-haired old man sitting nearby. Both were First-Order Origin Kings, far weaker than Luo Hai.

However, an Origin King was still an Origin King, a powerhouse that had mastered Domain. No Origin King could be matched by an Origin Realm cultivator. At the very least, Yang Kai felt a great pressure from her!

“Brother Luo Hai, is this the little brat you’ve been looking for?” The old man Chi Huo looked up and down Yang Kai, chuckling lightly.

Luo Hai nodded, “Yes, it’s him!”

“Sure enough, a powerful and intelligent young man, Brother Luo Hai has a discerning eye. Since this boy has been found, what does Brother Luo Hai plan to do next?” Chi Huo seemed to ask casually.

“What do I plan to do? En, naturally I will bring him back to Green Mountains Star with me,” Luo Hai smiled as he directed a look of ridicule towards Yang Kai with a gentle smile, “Little bastard, this King won’t eat you, why do you insist on avoiding this King like some viper? This King just saw that your aptitude was exquisite and that we share some fate, so this King wished to pass on his mantle to you!”

He spoke with a casual attitude, as if he was feeling quite helpless and frustrated, making him come off as truthful and upright.

The complexions of the many Elders from Ice Heart Valley shook as they turned looks of envy towards Yang Kai.

To be appreciated by a master like Luo Hai was nothing less than a Heaven-sent opportunity for Yang Kai. From then on, he would become a famous character in the Star Field, soaring up into the sky.

Yang Kai just maintained a light smile.

Chi Huo’s seemingly cloudy old eyes slightly narrowed as a faint spark flashed across their depths.

Luo Li frowned slightly and said nothing.

Inside the Ice Palace, perhaps only Yang Kai himself and the other two Origin Kings did not believe Luo Hai’s words.

The ones in the know, understood that Luo Hai was just spouting nonsense because he wanted to take Yang Kai away! As for accepting him as a disciple and passing his mantle on to him, it was nothing but a lie!

What kind of character was Luo Hai? How could he go so far to recruit a mere disciple? If he wanted to accept disciples, he only needed to send out word and geniuses from all over the Star Field would flock to Green Mountains Star and line up to worship him.

Yang Kai didn’t try to reveal the truth, however, and simply said, “This Junior will have to politely decline Senior’s kindness. While this is indeed a Heaven-sent opportunity, Junior is afraid he is not fated to accept it. Senior should try looking for another person whose fortune is better.”

A hidden anger flashed across Luo Hai’s eyes as he secretly thought that this little brat really didn’t understand his limits, but he still maintained a light smile, “Don’t be too quick to refuse. Come with this King back to Green Mountains Star first. You can stay there for a few years and, if you still insist on declining at that time, this King will naturally not make things difficult for you.”

He spoke as if he was making great concessions.

Chi Huo also chimed in, “Boy, you’ve best consider this matter carefully, Brother Luo Hai wanting to accept you as a disciple is a blessing that cannot be asked for in several lifetimes, an opportunity ordinary people could never receive. Why refuse?”

“Does this Senior feel is it a great blessing? Good, since Senior feels so, he might as well worship Luo Hai as his Master,” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

The expressions of all the Ice Heart Valley Elders froze as they stared at Yang Kai like he was some kind of monster, all of their hearts clenching tightly.

This boy... truly did not know how to fear the Heavens! Daring to insult Chi Huo so blatantly, wasn’t he afraid of incurring unbearable consequences?

Chi Huo’s face became cold as he shouted angrily, “Bold!”

As he shouted, a ray of light flashed across his eyes and struck towards Yang Kai as if it had substance.

He intended to punish this little brat who did not know how to respect his elders.

Yang Kai’s complexion remained unchanged as he stood in place, while Su Yan also regarded this terrifying attack as nothing, her pair of beautiful eyes never once leaving Yang Kai’s face, glancing at him sideways with a face filled with happiness.

Luo Hai waved his hand casually.

Chi Huo’s attack was silently resolved.

Before getting what he wanted from Yang Kai, Luo Hai would not allow him to be injured by Chi Huo.

“Brother Chi Huo, calm yourself. Young people always like spouting nonsense, why lower yourself to their level. Brother Chi Huo is also an Origin King. So, even if I wanted to serve as his Master, I am afraid I am not capable enough.”

Chi Huo snorted as he stared at Yang Kai coldly, his sharp gaze seemingly cutting him a thousand times, but still remaining silent.

Luo Li, who had not made a sound yet and was simply sitting there quietly, suddenly chose to speak up, “Since this young man has already been brought here, if Sir Luo Hai wishes to take him away, please do so.”

As for what Luo Hai wanted to do after taking Yang Kai away, it was not something Luo Li needed to consider.

She had no friendship with Yang Kai, so she would not offend Luo Hai because of him. Right now, she just wanted to send Luo Hai and Chi Huo out of Pure Ice Island as soon as possible. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She did not even have the thought of punishing Yang Kai for hurting Ran Yun Ting and causing such a ruckus on Pure Ice Island.

She could not help feeling anxious right now as an inexplicable sense of crisis gripped her heart, as if something terrible was about to happen if Yang Kai was not quickly sent away.

Luo Hai nodded and smiled at Luo Li, “This King arrived here uninvited, so I hope Junior Sister Luo Li won’t take offence. If you have free time in the future, please visit my Green Mountains Star as a guest, this King will definitely provide a warm welcome.”

Luo Li replied indifferently, “There will come such a day. Sir Luo Hai has found such a good disciple, so he must be anxious to return to Green Mountains Star to begin cultivating him. This Luo Li will not delay you any further.”

She was bluntly trying to send them off.

However, Luo Hai just smiled lightly, not showing any intention to stand up and leave, instead glancing over at Yang Kai and waving his hand, “There’s no hurry, this King’s business is indeed done, but Brother Chi Huo has a certain matter he would also like to handle here today, which is why he came here together with this King.”

As soon as this statement came out, Luo Li’s face changed slightly.

Had her worries finally come to fruition?

Although Luo Hai had not spoken too clearly, just the phrase ‘Came together with this King’ was enough to cause Luo Li to worry.

This was equivalent to saying that Luo Hai was standing together with Chi Huo at this moment.

The faces of Bing Long and Ran Yun Ting were also ugly as they stared at Chi Huo warily.

The two great forces, Ice Heart Valley and Brilliant Flame Sect, had been competing with one another on Scarlet Wave Star for countless years, but even after all these millennia, neither had been able to gain a decisive edge over the other, but now with Luo Hai intervening, Ice Heart Valley was instantly put at a disadvantage.

And this disadvantage was quite immense at that. Even relying on Pure Ice Island’s Pure Ice Grand Array, they would likely not be able to reverse the situation.

For a moment, Bing Long and the many Elders wore angry looks, but none of them dared to speak.

Yang Kai just stood in place, watching the show with a smile, not showing any awareness of his current situation, which was akin to a prisoner.

“And what matter have you come to my Pure Ice Island for this time, Chi Huo?” Luo Li took a light breath, calmed her chaotic thoughts, and asked cautiously.

Chi Huo laughed loudly as his fiery red hair flew back and he released an imposing manner as he shook his head and said, “Just a minor matter, Luo Li. You don’t need to be so nervous.”

He was feeling incredibly good at this moment. He had fought with Luo Li for so many years, and even knew that she had recently suffered backlash from cultivation dissonance. Yet, he was unable to gain a true upper hand. Finally, he had experienced the pleasure of being in the absolute superior position. Although he was essentially borrowing another’s strength to achieve this victory, Chi Huo did not enjoy this feeling any less.

“Speak!” Luo Li looked at him indifferently.

Chi Huo chuckled lowly as he stated, “I’ve come to your Sect today to take someone.”
