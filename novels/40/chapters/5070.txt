Liu Zi An hadn’t expected Yang Kai to spout such nonsense, and his upright attitude made it look like it was really what had happened, so he quickly refuted, “That’s not true!”

A calm Yang Kai turned to look at him, “It’s not true? Why don’t you tell everyone why we fought then, Brother Liu? It’s not like a newcomer like me would ask for trouble by offending you for no reason.”

Liu Zi An snapped, “It’s because…”

Yang Kai stared fixedly at him, “Go on.”

Liu Zi An was rendered speechless. The demand he had mentioned to Yang Kai on this day couldn’t be exposed in public; after all, this was just his speculation of Gui Liao’s intention. If it was exposed, Gui Liao would be humiliated. As his Black Ink Disciple, Liu Zi An wouldn’t dare to bring trouble to his Master.

Yang Kai promptly said, “See? He can’t say anything! Sir Gui Liao, the truth is right before our eyes. It’s not that I wanted to get into a conflict with him; instead, he was the one who went too far. Please stand up for me, Sir!”

Gui Liao stared fixedly at him for a moment, then turned to glare at Liu Zi An, “Waste!”

Liu Zi An was unable to say anything despite feeling aggrieved. He felt apprehensive and terrified as Gui Liao reprimanded him. It all happened because of Yang Kai, but he could only keep the resentment in his heart for the time being and try to get his revenge in the future.

“Regardless of the cause of the conflict, you two, as Black Ink Disciples, shouldn’t have gotten into a fight in Sir Territory Lord’s castle and caused so much damage. Both of you have to be punished. Liu Zi An!”

Liu Zi An replied in a shaking voice, “Yes.”

“That will be 3 World Spheres from you.”

Liu Zi An’s face instantly turned pale as he pleaded with Gui Liao, “Sir…”

“If you dare to say anything more, it will be 5 World Spheres!” Gui Liao snorted.

Liu Zi An instantly kept his mouth shut, but his expression was evidently furious and aggrieved.

“As for you…” Gui Liao gave Yang Kai a dispassionate look, “It will be 1 World Sphere.”

Even though Yang Kai had no idea what the punishment was, he knew that it was definitely terrible. That was the reason Liu Zi An turned pale upon hearing it. Yang Kai then cupped his fist, “Sir Gui Liao, I’m the victim.”

“You’re the victim?” Gui Liao sneered, “There’s a saying you Humans like to use, it takes two hands to clap. Both of you are in the wrong for what has happened today. I’m sure Sir Territory Lord will be fine with how I handle this matter. What’s wrong? Are you unwilling?”

[Of course I’m unwilling!] Yang Kai gritted his teeth for a moment before saying, “I’ll accept this punishment, then.”

Gui Liao stared at him for a while before nodding, “You’re quite good.”

“Many thanks for the compliment, Sir,” Yang Kai replied unenthusiastically.

“Enough, enough, go back to your own places.” Gui Liao waved his hand and chastised the Feudal Lords around him. It was then that the Feudal Lords left.

Seeing that Gui Liao was about to leave, Yang Kai called out to him, “Sir, when will you give me the Profound Yin Spirit Fruit as promised by Sir Territory Lord?”

Without turning his head, Gui Liao replied, “Just wait. I’ll give it to you when I find one.”

He soon disappeared, but he never said when he would find the fruit. Yang Kai reckoned that after he kicked up a fuss this time, he wouldn’t be able to get a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit in short order. Nevertheless, he didn’t regret his decision. There was no way he would agree to opening up his Small Universe and letting Gui Liao feed on his World Force.

With that said, he had to get his hands on a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit quickly; otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to explain himself when his Small Universe was fully repaired by the World Tree clone.

When he felt a resentful glare on him, Yang Kai turned around and saw Liu Zi An glowering at him. He sneered before striding off. Liu Zi An was so enraged that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.

After the battle, not only was he defeated by his opponent, but he was also punished by Gui Liao. Besides that, his residence was also destroyed. It could be said that he had suffered immense losses.

On the other hand, Yang Kai had received a much lighter punishment. There was no way Liu Zi An could tolerate this.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai wasn’t interested in responding to him. This Black Ink Disciple could never be saved, but he didn’t feel like killing him either, so he could only let him perish on his own.

Not long after Yang Kai returned to his room, a High-Rank Black Ink Clansman came over and passed him a World Sphere. After saying that it was Gui Liao’s order, he left.

Certainly, Yang Kai had seen World Spheres before. When he was Nu Yan’s subordinate in the past, that guy would bring him to different territories to fight against other Black Ink Disciples. The Black Ink Coins he earned would be used to buy World Spheres so that he could cultivate.

Nu Yan had a dream, which was to earn enough Black Ink Coins and head to Black Ink Nest to ascend to become a Feudal Lord.

However, before he could realise his dream, he was killed by Feng Ying.

To Black Ink Clansmen, World Spheres were cultivation resources, and every piece was costly. The average clansman couldn’t afford one.

If not for the fact that Yang Kai was powerful enough to win every life-and-death gambling match he entered, Nu Yan wouldn’t have earned enough Black Ink Coins to keep buying World Spheres.

Another Black Ink Disciple of Nu Yan’s, D-4, once told Yang Kai that the World Force in the World Spheres was basically collected from the battlefield. After Open Heaven Realm Masters passed away, their Small Universes would collapse, and their World Force would dissipate. World Spheres could be used to capture that leaking World Force.

However, Yang Kai felt that the explanation was unreasonable. Even though a lot of Open Heaven Realm Masters were killed on the battlefield, there shouldn’t be enough World Force that could fill World Spheres to be sold to so many Black Ink Clansmen.

After asking about this, D-4 told him that Black Ink Disciples could also infuse their World Force into the World Spheres, which was actually the most common way for the Black Ink Clansmen to create World Spheres.

Therefore, every Black Ink Disciple was a valuable asset to their Master. Black Ink Disciples were loyal and would never betray their Master, and they could tag along when the Master went to war. During their free time, Black Ink Disciples could even make World Spheres for the Masters to cultivate with. As long as the Black Ink Disciples were not killed, the Masters would have an unlimited supply of World Spheres.

Back then, Nu Yan had bought several empty World Spheres and told D-4 and the others to infuse their World Force into them; however, Yang Kai was Nu Yan’s money tree, so he was spared from this task. He just had to continuously win battles in different arenas.

When Yang Kai heard the punishment announced by Gui Liao, he didn’t understand what that meant; however, when he saw this empty World Sphere, he finally comprehended Gui Liao’s intention.

It was apparent that he was required to fill this World Sphere with his World Force.

It took a long time to completely fill a World Sphere, at least a few months given Yang Kai’s Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm strength. Not only was this time-consuming, but it would also exhaust his heritage.

Certainly, Yang Kai wasn’t willing to do such a thing. Why would he make a World Sphere for Gui Liao when the latter wasn’t even willing to give him a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit?

Nevertheless, since he had offended Gui Liao, life would be hard for him in the future. At the very least, before Hei Yuan left the Black Ink Nest years later, he had to be cautious so that Gui Liao wouldn’t have a reason to punish him.

Moreover, he had to come up with a way to complete his true objective, which was to find out the Artifact Refining Grandmaster’s identity and whereabouts.

Having said that, the most pressing issue for him was to obtain a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. Since he couldn’t pin his hopes on Gui Liao, he had to look for a different way to achieve his goal.

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai rose from the chair and left his room.

It was business as usual inside the castle. The passing Black Ink Clansmen would look curiously at him; after all, they had never seen a new Black Ink Disciple who had the guts to get into a fight in the castle.

Yang Kai randomly caught a Black Ink Clansman and asked, “Do you know where Zha Gu lives?”

The Black Ink Clansman was puzzled, “Who is that?”

Even though Zha Gu was a Feudal Lord, there were many Feudal Lords in Hei Yuan’s territory. Naturally, the Black Ink Clansmen in the castle couldn’t possibly know all the Feudal Lords.

Yang Kai didn’t give up though and kept asking around. After asking more than a dozen Black Ink Clansmen the same question, he finally got some clues. He found a Black Ink Clansman who knew a little about Zha Gu, he had no idea where he lived exactly, but he told Yang Kai to look for him in a particular area in the territory. A Feudal Lord like Zha Gu would generally look for a place outside of the city to establish their own home.

This was permitted by Hei Yuan and the other Territory Lords.

However, if one was incapable of acquiring a Black Ink Nest, he wouldn’t really have a territory to his name.

After thanking him, Yang Kai shuffled in that direction. No one stopped him along the way. It seemed that after the incident earlier, Gui Liao wasn’t ready to complicate the matter.

The universe fragment that was as large as a Universe World was directly owned by Hei Yuan, and the surrounding region occupied by his subordinate Feudal Lords was also considered his territory.

The location of the Black Ink Nest and the castle were the centre of the universe fragment. It could be considered the most prosperous place in the universe fragment.

Flying was not prohibited in the city, so after leaving the castle, Yang Kai directly shot into the sky where he met a lot of passing Black Ink Clansmen.

When the Black Ink Clansmen detected his Human, they looked curiously at him; however, no one made things difficult for him or had their eyes on him.

After all, he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so not just any Black Ink Clansman could capture him.

Soon, Yang Kai left this big city.

After flying a few hundred kilometres, he saw a manor below him. He speculated that it was a Feudal Lord’s territory.

Without hesitation, he descended towards the manor, not hiding his aura.

Before he even landed, a burly figure shot out from somewhere of the manor and came to him.

He soon stopped in front of Yang Kai and examined him. With a surprised expression, he asked, “A Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciple?”

There were only a small number of Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciples on this universe fragment, and he had met most of them before, but he wasn’t aware of Yang Kai’s existence, which made him feel curious.

“I’m sorry for disturbing you,” Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Sir, do you know where Sir Zha Gu lives?”

Instead of answering his question, the Feudal Lord asked, “Whose Black Ink Disciple are you? Why are you here?”

Yang Kai replied politely, “I’m Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple. Sir Gui Liao told me to look for Zha Gu as there’s a matter he has to discuss with him.”

Upon learning about his identity, the Feudal Lord said, “So, you’re the new Black Ink Disciple that Sir Territory Lord has taken on. It’s no wonder I had never seen you before.”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
