Lei Ting snorted softly. Even so, he complied with that request and released his grip as he muttered, “I heard you exchanged blows with that guy before and failed to gain the upper hand.”

With a sullen expression, Xiao Chen countered, “You exchanged blows with him just now. Can’t you tell how strong he is?”

Lei Ting’s expression turned grim, considering it carefully for a moment before nodding, “That person is a strong enemy!”

Xiao Chen followed up, “What’s even more hateful is that Xun’er seems to look at this guy differently. That’s why you and I should put aside our differences for now and work together to chase that guy away from her side, Lei Ting!”

Lei Ting sneered, “Work together? Why should I work together with you? What a joke.”

Xiao Chen snapped, “Do you dare to speak to Xun’er? Do you dare to look into her eyes?”

The aura around Lei Ting vanished instantly as he stammered for a long time before muttering bitterly, “Who doesn’t have a weakness?”

Xiao Chen gave a mocking smile, “You don’t even have the courage to look at Xun’er or speak to her, so how are you going to deal with it if she gets together with that guy?!”

“Then what do you think we should do!?” Lei Ting roared furiously.

Xiao Chen grinned meaningfully as he explained, “The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda will be opened in a few days. You and I will surely be entering, and our time limit will be one month; we will definitely get a chance during that period. The moment we get the chance, we have to teach him an unforgettable lesson. When that time comes, he will be greatly humiliated.”

“Work together to defeat him?” Lei Ting hesitated a little, “No can do. It’s not my style to gang up against others.”

Xiao Chen said, “Or, you can fight him alone. I will be responsible for preventing Xun’er from interfering with your fight.”

Upon hearing those words, Lei Ting considered the idea seriously and nodded, “Good, that’s fine.” Then, he patted Xiao Chen on the shoulder heavily and added, “I will leave Little Sister Xun to you. Leave that guy to me!”

“So, does that mean you have agreed to cooperate with me?” Xiao Chen flashed a knowing smile.

“Sure, sure; I’ll cooperate with you. Since my Junior Brother has already said so much, as your Senior Brother, I should play along with your plans.” Lei Ting laughed, feeling extremely happy.

Xiao Chen’s expression became sullen, “I’m too lazy to argue with you about who is the Junior Brother or Senior Brother among us…” [It’s fine as long as I can always be with the Princess, why should I be worried about not being in an advantageous or favoured position? An idiot like you should just focus on getting rid of outside enemies, you don’t need to worry about the rest.]

After their discussion was completed, the two of them parted ways to adjust their conditions for the upcoming confrontation.

…..

Since that night when Lei Ting came looking for trouble, no one else came to Nan Dou Peak to pick a fight with Yang Kai again. The entire Star Soul Palace was busy preparing for the opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, so even Lan Xun did not visit Yang Kai.

It was rare for Yang Kai to have a few days of leisure to himself; thus, he spent his time cultivating behind closed doors on Nan Dou Peak. He used the chance to consume and refine the three Dragon Blood Pills refined by Ji Ying.

The Dragon Blood Pills were amazing. After Yang Kai finished refining the three Spirit Pills, he noticed that the toughness of his physique had improved somewhat. Even though it did not improve by much, any little improvement was precious at his current level of strength. If he consumed more Dragon Blood Pills, perhaps his body could be elevated to a whole new level. Unfortunately, he only had three pills.

On the contrary, Yang Kai did not notice the purifying effects of the Dragon Blood Pill that Ji Ying had talked about regarding his Dragon Clan bloodline. But if he thought about it, he wasn’t actually a part of the Dragon Clan, he only possessed the Golden Divine Dragon’s Source Strength, so the purifying effects of the Dragon Blood Pills probably had no meaningful effect on him.

Five days later, Yang Kai had finished refining the third Dragon Blood Pill and was now immersed in the ecstatic feeling of growing stronger when he noticed somebody flying in his direction.

A short while later, Lan Xun’s voice entered his ears, “Senior Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai got up and walked out of the hall.

Lan Xun greeted him and explained, “We are opening the Treasure Pagoda today. Are you prepared, Senior Brother Yang?

“There’s nothing I need to prepare!”

“Good, then follow me.” Lan Xun said, leading the way. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was one of the most important places for cultivating in Star Soul Palace and could be described as a very large Sealed World. Cultivators of all realms ranging from Origin Realm to Emperor could cultivate in it and obtain benefits beyond imagination. It was rumoured that the sealed spaces within the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda were actually broken shards of destroyed worlds. That was why cultivators could easily perceive World Principles inside. Although the World Principles were fragmented, they were much easier to understand and had a miraculous effect on the cultivation of cultivators.

The existence of the Divine Ascension Mirror made it easier for disciples of Azure Sun Temple to gain higher accomplishments in Soul cultivation compared to others in the same realm. Similarly, the existence of Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda allowed the cultivators of Star Soul Palace to get ahead of other cultivators in the perception of Principle Strength.

The deeper the understanding of Principle Strength, the more refined the cultivation of the cultivator, and the easier it became for them to progress in their cultivation. It could be said that the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was the foundation of Star Soul Palace.

However, even Star Soul Palace could not open the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda as it pleased as the process consumed a lot of manpower and material each time. Not only did it require several Elders to contribute their strength, it also consumed countless precious treasures belonging to Star Soul Palace each time.

Generally, Star Soul Palace only opened the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda once every three years, and only selected disciples were allowed to enter.

There were restrictions on the number of people that could enter; therefore, the disciples of Star Soul Palace, regardless of their ranks within the Sect, would often conduct a large-scale tournament half a year in advance just to get the opportunity to cultivate in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. They needed to obtain a certain ranking before they were eligible to enter the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda.

The opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda this time was originally scheduled for half a year later, but was brought forward because of Yang Kai. Needless to say, if Star Soul Palace had been adamant about opening it half a year later, Yang Kai would have had no choice but to slowly wait. It was just that Star Soul Palace, as the pillar of the Southern Territory, had always kept its word and would never do something that would stain its reputation. Be that as it may, the early opening this time around had increased Star Soul Palace’s consumption of manpower and material resources significantly.

Yang Kai had entered the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda once before. When he first arrived at Maplewood City, Xiao Yu Yang had opened the entrance to the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda remotely and allowed all cultivators in the Origin King Realm in Maplewood City to enter. Yang Kai gained many benefits from that experience, and the memories of that mystical and wondrous Sealed World were still fresh in his mind.

The Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was filled with large amounts of fragmented World Principles, which not only helped to increase his cultivation significantly but also functioned to perfect the Sealed World Bead. Although the Sealed World Bead was an independent Small World unto itself, the World Principles inside it were incomplete. Despite having it for so many years, Yang Kai had not had the opportunity to fix this issue. However, it had absorbed numerous World Principle fragments when Yang Kai was last inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, improving the Small World within significantly. Later, it absorbed even more Shattered Star Source’s from the Shattered Star Sea and became even closer to perfection.

If it could absorb enough of the fragmented World Principles, as well as the complete Principle Strength, inside the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, then it would most likely be completely perfected. A perfect Sealed World Bead was, essentially, a real world that was no different from a Large World like the Star Boundary. Perhaps, it could even bring about unexpected benefits!

Compared to asking the Bright Moon Great Emperor three questions, Yang Kai preferred improving his Sealed World Bead; after all, the Sealed World Bead held unimaginable significance to his ability to understand World Force and his aspirations to become a Great Emperor in the future.

Xiao Yu Yang had worked with several Emperor Realm Masters in Maplewood City previously to open an entrance to the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda; therefore, Yang Kai had never seen the actual Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda before. This time around, he was fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of it. It was an actual pagoda that soared high into the sky and sparkled with five colours. The whole building exuded a very mysterious aura.

When Lan Xun led Yang Kai to this place, he found that no less than a thousand people had gathered near the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. There were cultivators ranging from the Origin Returning Realm to the Emperor Realm among them. Moreover, each of their auras was stable regardless of their cultivation realm. It clearly showed that they were the future pillars of Star Soul Palace. These one thousand cultivators were the disciples who were entering the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda to train this time.

The moment the two of them arrived, a thousand pairs of eyes turned towards them. Every Star Soul Palace disciple looking at Lan Xun, be it man or woman, had infatuated expressions on their faces. However, their looks turned to jealousy and hatred when they looked at Yang Kai. The difference between those two looks was like night and day. Although Yang Kai was not bothered by the gazes from these people, several other sharp and piercing gazes forced him to take them seriously.

Four people stood side by side in front of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. Their auras were as deep as the seas and gave off the feeling as if four towering pillars were standing there. These four were the four Elders of Star Soul Palace.

Xiao Yu Yang and Xue Zheng Mao, whom Yang Kai was acquainted with, made up two out of the four. The other two were old men. One had a ruddy complexion and a stocky build while the other had grey hair and a sprightly figure.

Xiao Yu Yang nodded at Yang Kai. On the other hand, Xue Zheng Mao, who had suffered greatly in Yang Kai’s hands, snorted softly.

“Is that Yang Kai?” The ruddy-faced, stocky old man asked, staring at Yang Kai.

Xiao Yu Yang replied, “Yes, that’s Yang Kai!”

“He is certainly an exceptional and unmatched talent. Still, his cultivation is only at the First-Order Emperor Realm. How did he injure Junior Brother Xue?” The stocky old man frowned.

Xue Zheng Mao’s expression became unnatural as he explained, “That little brat is proficient in the Dao of Space. I failed to notice that and allowed him to succeed in ambushing me.”

As a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, his ego had been bruised after being injured by a Junior like Yang Kai.

“Even if it was a sneak attack, that’s extremely impressive.” The stocky old man nodded lightly.

“You are praising him too much,” Xue Zheng Mao looked upset, “If I get serious, I can kill him within three moves.”

The burly old man was none other than the Great Elder of Star Soul Palace, Lei Hong, who was known as the most powerful Emperor Realm Master in the Southern Territory. To this response, Lei Hong chuckled, “I am not overpraising him. But, did you forget how Tan Jun Hao died?”

Xue Zheng Mao snorted in response, “Didn’t they say there was a Monster King with this brat at the time? Tan Jun Hao must have died at the hands of that Monster King. It has nothing to do with him!”

Lei Hong shook his head and said nothing more. He knew that Xue Zheng Mao harboured a great dislike toward Yang Kai and might become angry if he continued this topic. Being Elders in the same Sect, there was no need for him to agitate Xue Zheng Mao any further. Still, it had been a long time since Lei Hong last met a young man that was capable of wounding a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master.

Xiao Yu Yang glanced at Yang Kai before glancing over at Xiao Chen. Then, he sighed to himself. Although he believed his son was quite outstanding, he still paled in comparison to Yang Kai.
