“Would you believe it if I were to say that I’m not from Thousand Leaves Sect?”

Pained looks appeared on the faces of Ye Jing Han and Du Xian as they wiped away the beads of cold sweat that appeared continuously on their foreheads, nervousness and unease radiating from their entire beings.

Taking this in, Luo Jin gave a slight frown before quickly saying, “So, how do I address Your Excellency?”

Although Yang Kai only had a Second-Order Dao Source cultivation, which was a Minor Realm lower than his, he could make out that Yang Kai’s was still quite young. Having such a cultivation while being at that age forced Luo Jin to have no choice but to not treat Yang Kai lightly. Therefore, just to be safe, Luo Jin felt that it was better for him to probe Yang Kai before taking any hasty action.

“Yang Kai!” When he gave his reply, Yang Kai did not look at Luo Jin. Instead, he continued to stare at the new bride, looking for her reaction, before speaking in a clear voice. “High Heaven Sect’s... Yang Kai!”

“High Heaven Sect? What Sect is that?”

“Is there such a Sect in our Southern Territory? How have I never heard of it before?”

“Perhaps it’s a Sect from some distant place. There are so many Sects under the Heavens, so it isn’t a mystery for us to have never heard of one before.”

Hushed whispers echoed from the surrounding guests, with even Ye Jing Han and the others wrinkling their foreheads in pensive thought. Not a single person here had heard of this High Heaven Sect before, so it was unavoidable for them to be filled with curiosity.

After hearing the way Yang Kai had introduced himself, a fierce tremor shook through the new bride’s body, appearing as though her state of mind had suffered some kind of shock.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, as he felt with increasing certainty that his guess was correct.

Earlier, at the instant when the new bride had taken action against Chai Hu, Yang Kai had felt that the energy fluctuations radiating from her seemed somewhat familiar, as though it came from someone that he knew. Now, her reaction had reinforced this feeling in his heart.

Obviously having never heard of a Sect like High Heaven Sect before, a frown appeared on Luo Jin’s face, “So, Little Brother Yang, what objection do you have against this King’s marriage ceremony? How about telling this King?”

With a grin, Yang Kai replied, “Truthfully speaking, it isn’t anything like an objection; rather, this one is just quite curious about this new bride’s appearance... Sir City Lord, would it be alright if you could let this new bride remove her veil so we can see her gorgeous countenance?”

Right as his words rang out, weird looks appeared on everyone’s face as they looked at Yang Kai, wondering in their hearts about which new bride would remove their veil before entering the bridal room. On their day of marriage, the veils worn by the girls would only be removed by the grooms after entering the bridal rooms. This had always been the tradition, and breaking this would bring misfortune to the couple.

If the new bride’s face was to be revealed to everyone on the day of marriage, what purpose would the red veil have any more?

Despite such thoughts present in everyone’s heart, in all honesty, all of them were definitely curious about the new bride’s appearance, and wanted to take a glimpse of her face. However, not a single one of them had the courage to actually ask for it. Therefore, Yang Kai’s words had caused silent anticipation to well up in everyone’s heart.

Luo Jin’s eyes were solemn as he continued to stare at Yang Kai, remaining silent for a long time before giving a laugh, “You really are humorous, Little Brother Yang. You definitely are trying to make a joke just now to defuse the overly nervous atmosphere, right? This Old Master appreciates Little Brother’s thoughts!”

After saying those words, he cupped his hands slightly to show his understanding, though his eyes were brimming with a threatening stance, probably indicating to Yang Kai that he would suffer if he didn’t stop obstructing the process of the marriage ceremony.

However, right as he ended his speech, Yang Kai smiled and replied, “You’re misunderstanding me, Sir City Lord. This one did not just make a joke, I truly wish to see how the new bride looks!”

The smile on Luo Jin’s face instantly disappeared, replaced by a look of deep profundity.

Appearing to not notice it, Yang Kai continued, “Everyone knows that the City Lord is blessed with good fortune, having fourteen beautiful concubines with different styles of beauty, being able to enjoy the blessed fortunes of having those beauties all around him. Yet, no one knows exactly how those City Lord Madams look, as all of them wear black veils whenever they head outside. Guards would be there to part the roads, leaving people with no way to see their true faces; however, I think that everyone here definitely thinks that these City Lord Madams are absolute beauties, as only then would be able to match up to Sir City Lord’s majestic and awe-inspiring prestige.”

Hearing his words, Luo Jin laughed. “You’re too polite, Little Brother!”

Inwardly, he thought that this little brat was not trying to find trouble, but had done so for the sake of flattery. If that was the case, there was no harm for him to cooperate a bit.

“Now, there’s already going to be another City Lord Madam, you can’t conceal her yet again and stir people’s appetite, right?” Yang Kai winked at Luo Jin, “There isn’t any harm in letting us get a feast for our eyes, when all of the guests from all directions have gathered today, right? It will also help accomplish this wish of mine. If that is possible, we would also be able to soak in the good fortune that surrounds Sir City Lord. Who knows if this might cause an endless stream of fortune, and bless us with a wonderful life. Isn’t that right, everyone?”

Although the guests quietly listened and didn’t participate in the conversation, looks of anticipation appeared on the faces of quite a few people, as though they really wished to see exactly how this new bride looked.

With a smile, Luo Jin replied, “Little Brother, this Luo and my Madams share the same heart, and are matches made in Heaven. If you really wish to get lucky with women, this King seriously recommends you to visit our city’s Thousand Revelries House! You will definitely be able to obtain whatever you wish for, as there are many beautiful and lovable ladies there!”

Right as his words rang out, hearty chuckles rang out from the surrounding guests, as they bowed over from the humour in what Luo Jin had just said.

Nevertheless, some people were able to catch the hidden meaning behind Luo Jin’s words. What he was trying to say was that his Madams were not ladies you could pay for services like in a brothel. If the guests really were too bored of life and dared to continue causing trouble, it would be equivalent to humiliating him. Therefore, don’t blame him for becoming angry as a result.

“Good! The auspicious hour is about to arrive! Let the ceremony continue!” With a wave, Luo Jin prepared to end this farce that had caused his impatience to bubble forth.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai took a step forward and quickly said, “What if I really want to take a look at the new bride?”

Turning his head around, Luo Jin shot a cold look at Yang Kai and said in an emotionless voice, “It’s best that you go back and take a seat, Little Brother!”

“Young Master Yang... what are you doing?” Ye Jing Han was on the brink of going mad as she was utterly clueless as to why Yang Kai would continue to provoke Luo Jin time and time again at such a critical juncture. She could clearly see Luo Jin’s impatience and anger, and was well aware that if this situation continued, there would be no way for them to pull back any more.

“Young Master Yang, please come back,” Du Xian urged.

Turning his head towards them, Yang Kai replied in an indifferent tone, “This is my personal affair. If you all are afraid of being implicated by me, leave right now; however, do not criticize or give orders to me.”

A frown appeared on Du Xian’s face, though he did not continue to urge the latter.

On the contrary, a flustered look appeared on Ye Jing Han’s face as she waved her hands, “That was not my intention, but...”

Before waiting for her to finish her sentence, Yang Kai had already left from his seat, taking step after step towards the new bride. Moving at an unhurried pace, with a carefree look on his face, he looked at Luo Jin and said, “Sir City Lord, if this one isn’t able to see the true face of your new bride, I might not be able to sleep well at night. Sir City Lord, please let me fulfil my wish.”

“Have you gone crazy, you brat?” Hugging on to Luo Bing, Qiu Yu stood dumbly at his original position, a burning look in his eyes. He was utterly incapable of understanding why Yang Kai would cause such a ruckus; after all, from their earlier meeting, he could tell that Yang Kai was not some brainless troublemaker.

At this moment, the eye of Chai Hu, who was originally filled with despair as he was being suppressed by the City Lord Mansion guards, suddenly lit up as he shot a burning gaze at Yang Kai, as though he had managed to grasp onto a life-saving stalk in his despair. Struggling about, he shouted, “Little Brother, help me take her away! She’s just having a momentary confusion! You have to take her away!”

“Impudence!” Luo Jin roared out as he sent a furious and imposing glare at Yang Kai, “Little brat, I see that you’re purposefully trying to start a fight, huh.”

Continuing to walk towards the new bride, Yang Kai shook his head and replied, “You misunderstand me. I just wish to take a look at the new bride, that’s all. If you don’t agree, I’ll just have to do it myself.”

Luo Jin shouted out angrily, “Capture him!”

As his command rang out, a dozen cultivators suddenly leapt out from all directions, lunging aggressively towards Yang Kai. There were two Second-Order Dao Source Realm Masters among their ranks, one on the left and one on the right, both of them entering an attacking stance.

Seeing a fight about to break out before their eyes, the faces of the surrounding guests changed as they proceeded to retreat in fear of getting involved. There were even more people that looked towards Yang Kai with pitying expressions appearing on their faces, as they silently felt that the latter had lost his mind to actually cause such disturbance during the City Lord’s marriage ceremony. Wasn’t this equivalent to courting death?

In the blink of an eye, the dozen cultivators appeared before Yang Kai. Taking the lead, the two Second-Order Dao Source Realm Masters unleashed their attacks in a ruthless fashion. In an instant, Source Qi burst forth within the inner hall as energy fluctuations surged out.

In the next moment, a flurry of bangs rang out, followed by successive miserable howls, as all of the City Lord Mansion’s guards that lunged at Yang Kai were sent flying backwards. Smashing heavily against the surrounding walls, causing the entire inner hall to be filled with holes.

“What?”

“What happened?”

“Am I seeing things? My eyes have no problems, right?”

Astonished shouts rang out as the surrounding guests were utterly incapable of believing what they had just witnessed. There were even people who started to rub their eyes in an attempt to clear their vision, but were nevertheless unable to change the result that had appeared before their eyes.

The dozen cultivators, including the two Second-Order Dao Source Realm Masters, had all been sent flying in a single instant.

It was impossible for something like that to have happened for no reason. Therefore, the only explanation was that they had all been sent flying by Yang Kai.

However, no one had seen exactly how Yang Kai had taken action; the only thing they caught was a faint glimpse of Yang Kai’s figure turning blurry.

Only the exceedingly small handful of Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters present narrowed their eyes and revealed solemn expressions on their faces as they realised how extraordinary Yang Kai was.

This was the same for Luo Jin. Originally, he had assumed that Yang Kai was just a little brat that had yet to grasp the immensity of the Heavens and Earth. However, he never expected that Yang Kai would have concealed his strength like this. In an instant, Luo Jin realised that he was facing serious trouble.

After knocking those dozen City Lord Mansion guards back, Yang Kai continued to wear a calm and relaxed expression on his face, as though nothing had happened as he continued to walk towards the new bride.

“What are you all staring at?!” Realising that the situation was worsening, Luo Jin roared out a command.

In the next instant, even more masters from the City Lord’s Mansion flew out and hurtled towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai made an abrupt stop, turned his head towards his surroundings, a cold gaze gleaming within his eyes before he spoke in a grim tone, “If anyone dares to come over again, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

As his words rang out, looks of hesitation appeared on the faces of many of the cultivators lunging towards him, in fear of losing their lives here; however, with Luo Jin glaring at them, they had no choice but to clench their teeth and summon their artifacts and use their Secret Techniques to attack Yang Kai.

In an instant, multi-coloured lights enveloped the place where Yang Kai stood, as surging energies intersected and collided together. Intense explosions rang out, shaking the entire inner hall to the point where it appeared to teeter on the brink of collapse.
