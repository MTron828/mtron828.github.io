Earlier, when he was defending against the invasion of demonic creatures alongside Yang Kai at the city walls, Qin Zhao Yang had personally seen Yang Kai display his Spatial Secret Technique, creating a black hole that devoured countless demonic creatures.

Therefore, he had come to the conclusion that Yang Kai was a master in Space Force. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qin Zhao Yang wasn’t exactly sure how powerful cultivators that were proficient in Space Force were. The only thing he was sure about was that such cultivators had a natural superiority in escape and pursuit situations that were hard to rival.

He felt that with Yang Kai’s accomplishment in Space Force, it should not be difficult for Yang Kai to leave Maplewood City if he really wanted to.

Therefore, the exchange of the complete Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array for the promise of protecting Qin Yu wasn’t disadvantageous for him.

“Okay!”

Yang Kai nodded his head in agreement, before turning to shoot a look at Qin Yu standing by the side. “If I’m not dead, Qin Yu will definitely be safe!”

He had the confidence to make this declaration; after all, he had the trump card in the form of his Sealed World Bead.

Qin Zhao Yang gave a hearty laugh. “With your words, Old Brother, this Qin can rest assured. Just stay here and focus on comprehending the formation method. Leave the defence of the city walls to this old master.”

Yang Kai nodded, before finding a slightly quieter place to sit down. Sending his consciousness into the jade slip, he started to comprehend the information in detail.

Time continued to tick by.

Yang Kai had immersed himself completely in the mysteries of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array.

He discovered that what Qin Yu had said was right. This Spirit Array was patched up by her Qin Family’s old ancestor with his own comprehensions and was inferior to the original version. However, it was far easier to master, so it didn’t take long for him to attain some comprehension of his own.

Yang Kai only had cursory achievements in the Dao of Spirit Arrays. However, the Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array was unlike those that were usually used for defence or offence. This Spirit Array’s basis was focused on the cultivators. When they worked together to execute it, the completed Seven Points Black Tortoise Spirit Array could even rival a portion of the might that the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise’s Divine Ability could unleash.

On the other side, there were Dao Source Realm masters constantly flying over, receiving jade slips from Qin Yu before heading off to find their own corners to comprehend the information given to them.

Qin Yu obviously did not give these people the complete version of the Spirit Array formation method. Instead, they received one of the seven portions.

After a day, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed. Retrieving his communication artifact, he sent his Divine Sense in and immediately read the message that he had received.

It was a message from City Lord Duan Yuan Shan for everyone to gather.

Raising his head, Yang Kai shot a look at Qin Zhao Yang, who nodded back lightly at him.

Right at the same time, a rotund figure descended from the sky. With a large green bottle gourd hanging at his waist, who would it be other than Drunkard?

Standing on the city walls, Drunkard waved his hands at Qin Zhao Yang. “Go.”

Qin Zhao Yang smiled and replied: “I’ll have to trouble Vice City Lord City Sir to take care of this section’s defences then.”

Raising his eye towards Qin Zhao Yang, the Drunkard said, “Old fellow, you better be careful when you head outside. Make sure to not perish out there.”

Qin Zhao Yang’s mouth twitched in response, though he did not do anything in response other than to shoot a look at Yang Kai, before bringing Qin Yu as they flew to the gathering point.

After a short moment, they landed in another part of the city.

There were already four others gathered at this place, and all of them were Dao Source Realm masters.

Of the four, two of them were Maplewood City’s City Lord Duan Yuan Shan and Vice City Lord Zhuang Pan respectively, but Yang Kai didn’t recognise the other two people.

One of them was a pale-faced old man, while the other was a beautiful woman with an alluring figure.

Yang Kai made a sweeping glance, though shock surfaced within him as his eyes gaze landed on the beautiful woman, as he discovered that she was actually a Third-Order Dao Source Realm master! She was even stronger than Duan Yuan Shan! Furthermore, the aura radiating from her body was restrained, resulting in the energies in her body being only faintly discernible, which made it hard for people to judge her strength.

[When were there so many Third-Order Dao Source Realms in Maplewood City?]

Yang Kai’s heart was filled with suspicion. Just a few days ago, he had run into a master, a man he had met at the entrance of the Spirit Pill Plaza; he never expected to meet another master so soon after.

Although he did not know exactly where these two hailed from, they were definitely not local cultivators from Maplewood City.

Seeing Yang Kai looking over, the beautiful woman gave a sweet smile, causing her to radiate an air of seduction. Her moist, elegant peach-like eyes seemed to tell a story, containing a soul-stirringly fascinating glint.

A surge of vigilance rose in Yang Kai’s heart as he quietly turned his gaze away.

“Brother Yang, Brother Qin, you’ve arrived.” Seeing the two arrive, Duan Yuan Shan cupped his fists to greet them.

On the contrary, Vice City Lord Zhuang Pan gave a cold snort, appearing to have a big problem with Yang Kai and disliked the latter.

Yang Kai was not concerned with his reaction, as he had quarrelled with Zhuang Pan the last time he had visited the City Lord’s Mansion. In fact, they even started a fight where Yang Kai destroyed the spirituality of his artifact, so it was natural that he would not express pleasure at Yang Kai’s arrival.

“City Lord Duan, this madame is ...” Landing, Qin Zhao Yang looked doubtfully at the beautiful woman.

Qin Yu was in charge of handing over the Seven Points Black Tortoise Array to the Dao Source Realm Masters, and Qin Zhao Yang did not get involved in that matter. Therefore, he had not met this beautiful woman, and furthermore, knew that it was impossible for Maplewood City to have any Third-Order Dao Source Realm masters, prompting him to voice his query.

“This Mistress, Hua Qing Si, greets the two of you.” Not waiting for Duan Yuan Shan, the beautiful woman took the initiative to reply.

“So it is Lady Hua.” Qin Zhao Yang frowned in response, while a hint of a weird feeling flashed across his face. The woman had only introduced herself with her name, and no one knew if it was her real name or just an alias, thus he had no way of speculating about her origins.

Duan Yuan Shan smiled. “Lady Hua’s not a cultivator for our Maplewood City. She had just so happened to be doing some business here when the Demon Qi invasion began. After hearing that we’re heading outside to repair the seal, she volunteered to provide assistance. This Duan can’t thank Lady Hua enough for her righteous act.”

Hua Qin Si covered her mouth to give a lovable giggle. “You’re too modest, City Lord Duan. As of now, if anyone in Maplewood City suffers, everyone will suffer. This mistress is just doing it for my own survival. There’s no need to talk about righteousness at all.”

“This person should be Brother Yang, right? Old Master Du Li Shen, we’ve interacted briefly before.” Seemingly noticing Yang Kai’s pensive look, the pale-faced old man stood up and gave a self-introduction.

“So, it is old Sir Du, nice to meet you!” Yang Kai returned the greeting in a neutral tone.

He recognized this Du Li Shen, as he was the old ancestor of the Maplewood City’s Du Family and possessed the same First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation as Qin Zhao Yang. Although the two of them had not exchanged greetings before, they had engaged in simple conversations through their communication artifacts during the defence of Maplewood City, so Yang Kai was not unfamiliar with him.

On the hand, after seeing that Du Li Shen was attempting to form a connection with Yang Kai, Qin Zhao Yang hastily changed the subject and asked, “City Lord Duan, we’re still one person short. Don’t tell me that you’re planning to let Yu’er be one of the seven we need? Yu’er’s role in this is only to repair the seal.”

There were only four Dao Source Realm masters gathered here. After including himself and Yang Kai, they only had six here.

Duan Yuan Shan smiled in response. “Just wait a while longer, that person should be arriving quite soon.”

Just as his words rang out, a streak of light came shooting rapidly towards their direction. From the looks of it, that person seemed to be coming over from the City Lord’s Mansion.

After a short while, a flash appeared above the group, before a figure appeared.

Raising his head, Yang Kai could not help but frown in response.

That was because he discovered that the last person was actually the Third-Order Dao Source Realm middle-aged male that he had bumped into a few days ago at the entrance of the Spirit Pill Plaza!

Arriving at the gathering place, the middle-aged man swept his gaze below, before coming to a slight rest on Yang Kai before saying in an indifferent tone. “This King is late.”

His haughty stance incited displeasure in the crowd. Nevertheless, due to his astonishing cultivation realm, no one dared to outwardly reveal any of their displeasure.

The only exception was Hua Qing Si, who pursed her lips and let out a giggle, causing what seemed to be a lovely scene of flowers blossoming to appear.

Noticing her actions, the middle-aged male’s gaze turned chilly as he focused his eyes onto Hua Qing Si. However, upon noticing that her cultivation realm was not inferior to his own, he could not help but reveal a strange look on his face, as though he didn’t expect there to actually be a Third-Order Master other than himself present in this small Maplewood City.

Being unable to see through Hua Qing Si’s origins despite looking at her for a moment, the middle-aged man could only give a cold snort in response.

“You’ve arrived right on time, Brother Fu.” Duan Yuan Shan greeted the middle-aged male. From the looks of it, the appearance of two people stronger than him had caused him to feel somewhat uncomfortable.

The critical point was that these two had spontaneously come forward in the name of wanting to assist in the repairing of the seal. Therefore, he wasn’t able to reject them without good reason.

“City Lord Sir, when we leave, the defensive strength of Maplewood City would decline substantially. Would that be a problem for the people remaining here?” Qin Zhao Yang asked in concern. In any case, the core of his Qin Family’s businesses was in Maplewood City, therefore their losses would be great if the city was destroyed.

“With Drunkard and the old ancestors of the other families present, there shouldn’t be a problem for a short while. However, we still need to get this done as quickly as we can.” Duan Yuan Shan quickly replied. “Since everyone’s arrived, we should get going.”

After saying those words, Duan Yuan Shan waved his hand and took the lead to fly off.

The other people quickly followed behind.

As they arrived at the city walls, there were people already waiting for them.

“Open the array!” Looking deeply at the surging Demon Qi and an endless number of demonic creatures scuttling about, Duan Yuan Shan gave a loud roar.

Hearing his words, the nearby Array Masters quickly controlled the Array Plate in their hands.

Under their control, an opening slowly formed on the golden liquid-like Spirit Array.

When the opening grew large enough for a person to pass through, Duan Yuan Shan took the lead and rushed through, shouting out as he did so. “Let’s go!”

Xiu Xiu Xiu...

With everyone being at the Dao Source Realm, they would naturally not be lacking in their sense of timing. Streaks of light flashed about, and all seven of them were outside of the city.

Qin Yu followed closely behind Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang, not daring to be apart from them by more than half a step.

After the eight people had left, the Array Masters on the city walls quickly closed up the Spirit Array.

Outside of the city, Demon Qi surged about, creating berserk winds that howled about. One could even hear faint cries and howls ringing about, causing people’s hairs to stand on their ends and rocking the core of their life force.

Qin Yu’s face turned slightly pale, while tremors shook through her tender body.

Despite Yang Kai and Qin Zhao Yang joining hands to protect her, with her Second-Order Origin Returning cultivation realm, she was still somewhat unable to endure being in such a place.

“Form up!” At the front, Duan Yuan Shan shouted out.

In the next instant, everyone started to move, shifting themselves to various positions, all while forming seals with their hands.

With the change of their hand seals, a mysterious and invisible connection gradually formed between the seven Dao Source Realm cultivators, linking them together.

The Source Qi radiating from everyone started to surge and expand, before fusing with others’ Source Qi. When that happened, an extraordinary aura suddenly came into existence, before expanding out furiously, driving all of the Demon Qi away from their vicinity, creating an empty void around where they were standing.
