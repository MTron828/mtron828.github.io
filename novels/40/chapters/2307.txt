Hearing what Yang Kai had said, the members of the Thousand Leaves Sect looked at him in doubt, blank looks on their faces.

With a grin, Yang Kai whispered, “From the confident attitude the City Lord is giving off, how would he not have made any preparations?”

Du Xian’s face changed slightly, as though he had thought about something, before whispering, “What Young Master Yang means is that he is prepared to...”

Yang Kai shook his head, before indicating they should quietly watch the spectacle.

Over there, the phoenix coronet shook slightly as the red-veiled bride walked towards Chai Hu. Looking at her, a shade of happiness appeared in his sole eye as he opened his mouth to say, “Come and stand here to help me hold the fort, and force that old dog to let Big Brother and the others go. After that, we can escape from here and never return to this damned Sky Crane City.”

The new bride didn’t say a single word back as she obediently walked and stood by Chai Hu’s side.

“After creating such a huge disturbance today in my City Lord’s Mansion, and damaging this King’s face, do you think... you can escape, Your Excellency?” A ridiculing expression appeared on Luo Jin’s face as he snorted coldly in response.

“Everything can be achieved with effort!” Chai Hu sneered in reply.

Luo Jin gave an ambiguous laugh and said, “This King feels... that it’s best that you remain here!”

Chai Hu’s expression instantly changed. Just as he was able to say something, he suddenly felt a chilling intent hurtling towards his back. In the next instant, a palm was pressed against his back and a burst of power surged into his body, sending him flying with a jolt.

Flying through the air, his eye snapped wide open in absolute shock as he turned his head around. Upon looking at the owner of the palm, misery and despair flooded his lone eye.

*Peng...*

Landing on the ground, Chai Hu smashed into tables and chairs, yet he quickly climbed back up. However, it seemed as though he had suffered quite a serious blow from that attack, causing him to immediately spurt out a mouthful of blood upon standing up.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

The Masters from the City Lord’s Mansion lunged over at the same time, with a few palms pressing simultaneously on Chai Hu’s body. Power surged out of their palms, though nothing exploded forth from them.

After all, this was the City Lord’s great wedding ceremony, so it was truly inappropriate to let blood be spilt here. If not, Chai Hu would have died on the spot.

After being suppressed, Chai Hu staggered backwards, seemingly about to lose his balance. With a face filled with pain and sorrow, he looked towards the new bride, blood flowing out of his mouth as he said in grief, “Fifth Sister... why...”

Shockingly, it was the new bride, whom he wanted to save, that had unleashed a sneak attack and landed a serious blow on him. Even now, he couldn’t believe that what had happened was real.

Everything had happened in a split second. Not only did it shock Chai Hu, but it had also left all of the surrounding guests with their mouths agape, dumbfounded looks appearing on their faces. The only exception was Luo Jin, who seemed to have anticipated it, a faint smile hanging on his face.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai stood up and shot a burning gaze at the new bride, while a myriad of emotions flashed across his eyes.

“Monster Qi?” A frown appeared on Ye Jing Han’s face, as she covered her mouth and whispered, “This new bride’s actually a person of the Monster Race?”

Just now, despite it being incomparably short, the instant the new bride took action, the strength she displayed was completely different from a human’s Source Qi, as there was a pure Monster Yuan Qi aura present within.

Although cultivators of the human race could cultivate Secret Arts or Secret Techniques from the Monster Race, and allow the energies of their bodies to grow similar to that of Monster Qi, it would absolutely not be as pure as what the new bride had unleashed. From the looks of it, this new bride was unexpectedly not a human, but a member of the Monster Race.

Although there were Monster Races present within the Star Boundary, it was extremely rare for them to move about within human-populated cities. Furthermore, other than the extremely small percentage that would do so, they would also do their utmost to conceal their movements; after all, due to the difference in race, it was unavoidable for humans to have negative feelings towards those of the Monster Race.

There were quite a few people other than Ye Jing Han who had discovered this, causing them to shoot curious looks towards the new bride.

Furthermore, from the energy fluctuations radiating from the new bride when she had taken action, she was impressively a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator.

“What’s the matter, Young Master Yang?” Noticing that something was amiss with Yang Kai, Du Xian hastily asked out of concern.

However, Yang Kai paid no attention to him, continuing to lock his eyes right at the new bride, his body trembling slightly, as though he had discovered something incredible.

“Take him away and make sure to look after him properly! After the ceremony, this King will have a good talk with him!” Luo Jin waved his hand and gave his orders.

Nodding their heads, the few City Lord Mansion guards proceeded to take action and seal Chai Hu’s cultivation, before detaining him.

“No!” No one expected for a high pitched shout to ring out at that moment before everyone saw Luo Bing, who had just escaped from the deadly grasp of Chai Hu, rush straight towards him. Unleashing a flurry of punches and kicks at the few guards, she exerted all her might to push them away, proceeding to spread her arms and stand before Chai Hu, before shaking her head continuously, “Don’t come over!”

Her stance of wanting to protect Chai Hu left all of the guests in shock once again, as they were utterly incapable of understanding exactly what she was thinking. After all, Chai Hu had just used her life to threaten everyone, so shouldn’t she be fleeing as far away from Chai Hu as possible after extricating herself? Why did she jump right back into the net?

“What are you doing, Bing’er!” Luo Jin roared with great fury. He had grown quite angry with his daughter today, as she had already gone against him multiple times. Furthermore, she was now trying to protect the person that had caused a disturbance at his marriage ceremony! How could he not be angry?

“Father, Big Brother Chai saved me yesterday, so he’s my saviour! Please don’t make things difficult for him.” Luo Bing sobbed and pleaded.

Luo Jin’s eyes narrowed, “Saviour?”

Luo Bing replied, “That’s right. Yesterday, I was facing a life and death situation, and it was Big Brother Chai who saved me...”

“Yesterday?” A frown appeared on Luo Jin’s face as he said in a cold voice, “Didn’t you go out with Young Master Qiu yesterday? How did this person end up saving you?”

Luo Bing shook her head and answered, “I’ll tell you about the whole matter in detail later, so can you not make things difficult for him, and let him go, alright?”

The face of Qiu Yu, who had been listening on the side, instantly turned pale, and with a flash, appeared right before Luo Bing. Extending his hand, he grabbed hold of her arm, “Don’t cause a fuss anymore, Little Sister Bing. Didn’t Sir City Lord say that he would not hurt him? Just be a darling and be obedient, alright?”

However, Luo Bing shook her head, “Then you should let him go right now!”

A flash of impatience flickered across Luo Jin’s eyes as he spoke towards Qiu Yu, “Young Master Qiu, my little girl is being immature. Please take her away to rest.”

Qiu Yu nodded, “Yes sir!”

After saying that, he extended his hand out to give Luo Bing a pat on her body, causing her to immediately collapse limply. Although she was still conscious, she was incapable of moving. Carrying her by her waist, Qiu Yu proceeded to head towards the back of the inner hall.

After being struck by the new bride, Chai Hu seemed to have lost his soul, as he did not respond to the series of events that had just happened before him. At this moment, his sole eye turned red as he growled, “Fifth Sister, tell me, exactly why are you doing this! Could it be that you really are willingly getting married to this old dog?”

Luo Jin sneered, “This King has already given you enough face. If you can’t appreciate this King’s kindness, don’t blame this King for being discourteous towards you.”

A guest by the side shouted out, “City Lord, there’s no need for you to be overly kind to him! This person is guilty without a doubt!”

“That’s right! The City Lord and the new bride are bound by love, and will be blessed for hundreds of years. They are a Heaven-blessed pair, created by the earth, and not something that can be destroyed easily by a despicable, vile person like you.”

“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it!” Chai Hu roared with all his might.

“Stubborn-headed fool!” Luo Jin snorted coldly before speaking in a deep voice. “Then go and stand by the side and observe in detail whether my humble wife is willing to marry this King or not!”

After saying those words, Luo Jin turned his head and scanned his surroundings, before speaking out with a gloomy look on his face, “Any friend who does not accept this union, please step forward, and this King will give you a satisfactory answer.”

Having his marriage ceremony disrupted by people had caused damage to his face. Therefore, for the sake of regaining it, he had said those words with a face brimming with murderous intent.

Who dared to step up and go against him yet again? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“You must be joking, right, City Lord? There are bound to be a few people in this world that can’t appreciate other people’s kindness. Don’t take offence to that, sir.”

“That’s right, it’s not worth it to spoil one’s mood over people like this. Let’s continue, let’s continue!”

Only after hearing these responses did Luo Jin’s complexion turn slightly for the better as he snorted coldly, “Today is a day of celebrations, so this King isn’t willing to make a big fuss about it. If there’s anyone that still objects, you can just speak forthrightly.”

He surveyed his surroundings, with everyone around putting up apologetic smiles in response.

“I...” A person’s voice suddenly rang out, causing the nervous atmosphere, which was gradually easing away, to reappear once again. There were even quite a few people that sucked in a breath of cold air, as they looked towards the direction where the voice came from, quietly thinking that there really were people who were not afraid to die in this world, to actually dare to object at such a moment.

Luo Jin’s expression also turned fierce, anger gushing forth as he turned a gaze filled to the brim with murderous intent towards the direction of the voice.

He looked over, only to see a youth standing at the table nearest to the front, grinning. Raising his hand, the youth said, “I... have just a very small request, and I hope City Lord Sir won’t get angry over it.”

“It’s a member of Thousand Leaves Sect!”

“It’s actually a disciple of Thousand Leaves Sect! He isn’t choosing to do so now just to add insult to injury, right?”

“That’s a very unfamiliar face. Is he really a member of Thousand Leaves Sect?”

“How could he not be? Don’t you see him sitting together with Ye Jing Han and Du Xian?”

“This will be interesting.”

Hushed whispers proceeded to ring out. When the guests noticed that the person who had just spoken out was seated together with the disciples of Thousand Leaves Sects, they immediately knew that today’s matter would get even more complicated than before. After all, Chai Hu had only represented himself, had failed in snatching the bride away, and had even gotten injured while making a fool of himself. However, if Thousand Leaves Sect was to get involved, the whole issue might end up with a confrontation between the two great forces if it was not settled properly. If that were to happen, it would become a major issue that would affect everyone who lived within ten thousand kilometres of this place.

Upon hearing that voice, Qin Yu, who had carried the immobilised Luo Bing to the entrance of the inner hall, instantly came to a halt and turned around. Right as he saw who had just spoken out, his expression immediately changed, “How can it be that little bastard! He’s really too audacious!”

“Young Master... Young Master Yang...” Ye Jing Han was caught off guard as she stared blankly at Yang Kai, who had stood up, covering her mouth as she blurted out in shock, utterly confused as to why Yang Kai had the nerve to speak out after that shocking series of events.

“What are you doing, Young Master Yang?” Du Xian’s expression had also changed, as he immediately realized the severity of the current situation. Although they knew that Young Master Yang was not a disciple of their Thousand Leaves Sect, others did not know about this. Since they were all sitting at the same table, other people would definitely assume that they were together. Yang Kai standing up at this moment to object to the marriage would definitely cause others to assume that this was the stance that Thousand Leaves Sect was taking.

Once this misunderstanding developed, they might not be able to leave Sky Crane City anymore.

In an instant, beads of cold sweat surfaced on Du Xian’s forehead.

“It’s just a personal matter! It’s purely a private affair!” Sending a faint smile towards the two, Yang Kai proceeded to raise his head to look towards Luo Jin.

Clearly, Luo Jin was also utterly confused by Yang Kai’s words. After staring at the latter for a while, he asked, “Is Your Excellency also from Thousand Leaves Sect? How come this King has never greeted you before?”

What made Luo Jin even more confused was that the group of people from Thousand Leaves Sect were actually seated at the frontmost table. What exactly was happening here?
