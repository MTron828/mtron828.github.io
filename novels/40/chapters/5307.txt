Though there was no one to guide Yang Kai as he cultivated in the Phoenix Nest, the primordial Dao Essence was the best teacher. By consuming and refining these Dao Essences, he was able to reflect, identify his weaknesses, and eliminate the bad while retaining the good.

His mastery of Dao of Space increased rapidly.

A few months flew by quickly.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and reviewed his gains.

He didn’t achieve a breakthrough, but his mastery of the Dao of Space had evidently been enhanced, and this enhancement of his Grand Dao improved his strength too.

By just lifting his hand, Yang Kai could feel the quivering motion of the Void around him.

Yang Kai remained as tranquil as an ancient well, though such a result was certainly pleasing to him. Cultivating in this Phoenix Nest for a few months was far more beneficial to him than cultivating outside for many years.

The only thing that saddened him was that despite greatly enhancing his comprehension of the Dao of Space, he didn’t seem to have any signs of breaking through to the next level of mastery.

According to his own division of a Grand Dao, the last stage was Shocking History and Dazzling the Present, a stage that few had ever attained throughout history.

Though he did not break through this level, he had gained a lot, so he had no regrets. He believed that he would eventually reach such mastery one day in the future.

Deciding it was time, he stopped cultivating. The initially dense Space Dao Essence in this Phoenix Nest had noticeably diminished after his months of intensive refining, precisely like those in Huang Si Niang’s Phoenix Nest had. He couldn’t just keep cultivating though because Su Yan would eventually return here to cultivate in the future; the more Space Dao Essence he absorbed, the less would be left for Su Yan.

The situation right now was just right. He had absorbed a sufficient amount of Dao Essence which would be replenished by the Immortal Parasol Tree over the coming years. That way, it would not cause any hindrance to Su Yan when she arrived here to cultivate.

Moreover, Yang Kai also believed that it was pointless for him to keep cultivating as he couldn’t break through to the final level of mastery simply by absorbing the Phoenix Nest’s Space Dao Essence. In order to reach the highest stage, he had to fully understand the Dao of Space by himself.

Besides, he didn’t know when the Dragon Pool would be opened. If he accidentally missed it while he was cultivating here, the Dragon Clan would definitely not wait for him.

It was thus time for him to leave.

After feeling the familiar aura of this place one last time, Yang Kai shifted his thoughts and pressed on something in the Void.

The Phoenix Nest portal opened, and he exited.

Yang Kai was startled by the scene in front of him. Many sets of eyes that were dispersed across the Parasol Tree glared at Yang Kai with all sorts of emotions including scrutiny, confusion and even hatred.

Under the envelopment of so many Divine Sense, Yang Kai’s body froze up.

[What’s happening?]

Yang Kai was confused. Without having the need to count, he could judge that at least 30 pairs of eyes were focused on him. Furthermore, based on the Divine Sense intensity, several Phoenix Clan members who were equivalent to Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were present.

He knew that the whole Phoenix Clan had gathered in this place.

No ordinary person could have the opportunity to witness a single pure-blooded Phoenix throughout their entire life, yet Yang Kai was not delighted even if there were several dozens of them in front of him now. This was all due to their unfriendly expressions which looked as though they wanted to tear him apart.

[I’m being blocked by the Phoenix Clan now? Why? There’s no need for this. All I did was make use of Su Yan’s Phoenix Nest. The Phoenix Clan members won’t be that petty, right?]

“Why are you all here?” Yang Kai stated dryly while squeezing forth a smile.

There was no response.

Yang Kai secretly began condensing his Space Principles, preparing to flee at any moment. Although the Phoenix Clan members were also experts in the Dao of Space, and he might not be as fast as them if he tried to flee, it was his only hope.

That was his last resort since he didn’t want to cause too much trouble.

As he locked eyes with Huang Si Niang, intending to ask about the situation by glances, she openly pretended not to notice.

It made Yang Kai curse in his heart, [This woman is too wicked! If it weren’t for her invitation, how could I have come to the Immortal Parasol Tree? But, when things turn out like this, she pretends not to know me!]

Yang Kai made several assumptions about the existing circumstances. It was undoubtedly due to his entrance to the Phoenix Nest despite the fact that he was a Human, but wasn’t this just too much?

He couldn’t help but get a headache. Since ancient times, the Dragon and Phoenix Clans had guarded the No-Return Pass. Though there were other Divine Spirits, these two Clans were still the most crucial among them.

The Dragon Clan wasn’t very pleased with him already, so if he offended the Phoenix Clan as well, he might have no way out.

[What now?]

While he was pondering, a noble looking woman suddenly asked, “Do you possess a Phoenix Clan Source?”

Although he did not feel any kind of pressure or intimidation from this woman as he turned to face her, Yang Kai felt a kind of pull from her deep stare, as though his very soul was about to be pulled from his body.

Under such a gaze, any lies or deceptions would be seen through and extremely disrespectful.

Yang Kai’s heart trembled a little, knowing that this woman was not someone he should provoke. She had no intention to coerce him, but her strength was so great that even a simple gaze and question was enough to feel stifling.

He had experienced a similar feeling from a few other individuals before, and all of which were Old Ancestors.

“Senior, you are…” he asked, though he already had guessed it in his heart.

Following that, Huang Si Niang, who finally showed some righteousness, explained, because she was aware that Yang Kai was not well versed with the Phoenix Clan, “This is the current Clan Head of my Phoenix Clan.”

The Phoenix Clan Head was naturally just a title, similar to the Clan Head of the Dragon Clan.

Yang Kai quickly bowed to salute, “So it is Madam Clan Head. I apologise for my rudeness.”

The Phoenix Clan Head nodded lightly and frowned as she said, “Though you have the aura of our Clan, you don’t seem to carry a Phoenix Clan Source.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yang Kai replied honestly, “Madam, this Junior does not have a Phoenix Clan Source.”

“Then, have you come in contact with a Phoenix Clan member before this?” She asked again.

“Yes,” Yang Kai was secretly at a loss for words. It had been hundreds of years since he was in contact with a Phoenix Clan member, so how were these Phoenixes even able to sense that? Were the Phoenix Clan members’ noses that sensitive, or did they have any other methods to tell?

Yang Kai was unaware that Huang Si Niang had invited him for a conversation at the Phoenix Nest only because she could feel a Phoenix’s aura in him. Otherwise, how would any Phoenix Clan member allow a random stranger to enter their Phoenix Nest, given their haughty character?

Even the Dragon Clan members that were living in the No-Return Pass with them wouldn’t get such treatments.

“How is the individual you came in contact with doing right now?” The Phoenix Clan Head asked once again.

Yang Kai thought for a while before replying, “She is doing well and should currently be cultivating in the Divine Spirit Ancestral Land.”

“The Ancestral Land…” She muttered softly, with a hint of nostalgia on her face. The Ancestral Land was something long not mentioned by both the Dragon Clan or the Phoenix Clan. Ever since they took charge of the No-Return Pass, they had never visited the Ancestral Land.

It appeared to be some sort of fate that a Phoenix Clan member entered the Ancestral Land to cultivate.

In the No-Return Pass, the Dragon and Phoenix Clans were somewhat aware of some of the secrets of the Ancestral Land.

“Is she a Human?” The Phoenix Clan Head continued to question. Most of the Phoenix Clan Sources left outside were found and refined by Humans. If the Source could be integrated, then their Bloodline would slowly be altered. In addition to that, if they were strong enough and had enough opportunities, they would be able to arrive at the No-Return Pass and cultivate in a Phoenix Nest on the Immortal Parasol Tree, allowing them to shed their former body and be reborn as a pure-blooded Phoenix.

Of course, this did not solely apply to the Human Race. Any other being with a pure enough Phoenix Clan Bloodline could easily refine and fuse with a Phoenix Clan Source.

“Indeed.”

“Are you close with her?” If it wasn’t for this reason, that person’s aura wouldn’t linger on him.

“Uh… she is my Wife,” Yang Kai scratched his cheeks shyly.

“Wife…” The Phoenix Clan Head was startled for a moment. Though the Phoenix Clan’s structure was different from the Human Race’s, she could somehow understand the meaning of the term “Wife”.

A woman with a Phoenix Source became the Wife of a man with a Dragon Source.

This type of occurrence had hardly happened throughout history. Both the Phoenix Clan and the Dragon Clan were equally arrogant. What was more was that there were not many Sources of these two Clans left outside.

“Have you both… bonded?” The Phoenix Clan Head asked again.

Yang Kai’s face blushed, [This woman… how could words like that leave her mouth? How am I supposed to answer that? Furthermore, wasn’t it normal to perform such acts as partners? Why does she have to ask about everything?]

“… Yes,” he murmured in response.

This time, many members of the Phoenix Clan were unable to control their anger, especially those who had previously been glaring at Yang Kai, were now much more furious with murderous intent blazing in their eyes. If it wasn’t for the Clan Head being there, they might have already jumped out to murder this brat who sullied the purity of the Phoenix Clan.

With an expression that indicated she had now fully understood the situation, the Phoenix Clan Head said, “No wonder you can open her Phoenix Nest.”

As they had bonded with each other, their auras naturally mixed. As a result, the aura of the woman’s Phoenix Source lingered on Yang Kai’s body, which was enough to gain the approval of the Phoenix Nest, allowing him to enter.

Of course, if enough time passed and the aura faded or dissipated, the Phoenix Nest would not be accessed so easily. It could only be said that the Phoenix Clan member aura that lingered on Yang Kai was just enough to get the approval of the Phoenix Nest.

After listening to the Phoenix Clan Head’s words, Yang Kai suddenly understood too, “Senior, you mean that the reason why I could enter the Phoenix Nest is due to the remnants of my Wife’s aura?”

She nodded lightly, “There is no other explanation than this.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

In fact, he had made a guess when he entered the Phoenix Nest, but he wasn’t that concerned about it because he was just too happy at that moment. This woman’s words had just helped to confirm his initial suspicions.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t make sense for him to be able to enter Su Yan’s Phoenix Nest but not Liu Yan’s or Jiu Feng’s. Putting Jiu Feng’s aside as Yang Kai rarely interacted with her, he had actually quite often been together with Liu Yan. The only thing he lacked with her was the interchanging of auras.

In that case, it was all thanks to Su Yan that he managed to enter the Phoenix Nest.

“The Ancestral Land…” The Phoenix Clan Head murmured softly again, she would not have paid it any mind it if she didn’t know the whereabouts of other Phoenix Clan members, but now that she knew there was one cultivating in the Ancestral Land, she felt it was time to find a way to bring her home.
