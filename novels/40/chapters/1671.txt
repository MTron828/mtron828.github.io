Chapter 1671, You’re An Origin King?

Seeing Qian Tong’s silence, Xie Chen thought he had been intimidated, so he became even more arrogant and savagely spat, “Qian Tong, a wise man will submit to the circumstances. Corpse Spirit Religion has four Origin Kings, and domination of Shadowed Star is just around the corner. Do not be stubborn, as long as you are willing to submit, this Hall Master can put in a few good words to you. With your cultivation, the treatment you’ll receive won’t be any worse than this Hall Master.”

Qian Tong suddenly sighed, and in a sullen tone steeped with coldness, he stared at Xie Chen and faintly said, “You said that there are four Origin Kings in this Corpse Spirit Religion?”

“Indeed!” Xie Chen grinned meaningfully and nodded.

“Do you even know what an Origin King is?”

“The Origin King Realm is...” Xie Chen froze for a moment, a trace of confusion flashing across his face. No Origin King had been seen on Shadowed Star for over ten thousand years, so the world only knew it was a realm higher than the Origin Returning Realm. Xie Chen wanted to speak, but he truly couldn’t say anything.

After all, he had never seen it either.

Becoming somewhat angry out of shame, he snapped back, “Do you know?”

Qian Tong stared at him indifferently, and without saying a word, he stretched out his hand towards Xie Chen and clenched his fist.

Xie Chen instinctively stepped back and pushed his Saint Qi to protect himself, thinking that some kind of attack was about to hit him, but even after waiting for a moment, nothing happened; in fact, he was unable to even notice any Saint Qi movement from Qian Tong.

“Qian Tong, you dare play tricks with this Hall Master?” Xie Chen was furious, his face going from blue to red, “I will have you dead! Since you and I both came from Shadow Moon Hall, I wanted to give you a chance, but since you don’t put this Hall Master in your eyes, no one can save you now! Kill him!”

As he barked this last sentence, he turned to his subordinates.

When Yang Kai rescued Wei Gu Chang just now, he immediately discovered that these people belonged to Shadow Moon Hall, so he had not immediately killed them as he was unaware of the current situation and simply forced them back from Wei Gu Chang.

These people did not have any serious injuries and had managed to stabilize themselves by now.

Hearing Xie Chen’s orders, however, the group of five Origin Realm cultivators all showed hesitation on their faces.

Even if Xie Chen did not fear Qian Tong, did they not? Although their strength had grown noticeably since joining the Corpse Spirit Religion, Qian Tong’s past majesty was still deeply rooted in their psyche, so they were undoubtedly quite reluctant to seek trouble with him now.

“Hm? Hall Master! You... you...” Suddenly, a middle-aged man seemed to have discovered something shocking and pointed at Xie Chen in horror while screaming.

The others all looked in the direction he was pointing then and could not help exclaiming. As horror filled their faces, all of them involuntarily retreated from Xie Chen, like they were avoiding a plague.

“What’s wrong?” Xie Chen was not a fool and realized something was wrong, quickly glancing down, only to have his complexion change drastically as he called out in shock, “What’s happening!?”

He suddenly noticed that the ends of his arms and legs were being slowly dissolved by some kind of energy which, while invisible to the naked eye, gave off now discernable fluctuations.

This silent energy was like a million tiny locusts, slowly eating away at Xie Chen’s limbs, inching its way towards his torso.

Even as he experienced this process, Xie Chen felt nothing, not even pain.

A sense of horror quickly overwhelmed Xie Chen as he felt a chill run up his spine, causing him to shiver uncontrollably.

*Peng peng peng...*

Four explosions suddenly sounded, and with great slashes of blood, Xie Chen’s arms and legs all exploded, leaving only his upper body which promptly fell to the ground, kicking up a big wave of dust.

Blood flowed out and stained the ground as Xie Chen’s expression fluctuated between shock disbelief.

The Shadow Moon Hall traitors also felt like they had been struck by lightning, their complexions going completely white, as if they had been suddenly thrown into a frigid blizzard.

“No! Impossible! This is absolutely impossible! This cannot be real!” Xie Chen roared like a wounded beast. Without his limbs, he appeared quite miserable, as if he had suffered some kind of vicious torture.

“This Hall Master is a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master! No one can do this to me except an Origin King! This Hall Master does not believe it!” Xie Chen had obviously taken a massive blow both physically and mentally and raved like a madman, but as soon as he spoke these words, he froze up in abject terror as he stared at Qian Tong blankly, fear covering his eyes as he stutteringly asked, “Origin King... you’re already an Origin King?”

If Qian Tong was not an Origin King, it would be absolutely impossible for him to do this to him with only a simple wave of his hand. If Qian Tong was not an Origin King, Xie Chen would definitely have the power to fight back.

“Seems you’ve not lost all of your intelligence!” Qian Tong said coldly.

“What? Great Elder is already an Origin King?” Wei Gu Chang was stunned.

Dong Xuan’er covered her mouth with her small hands and her beautiful eyes flashed with amazing brilliance, like a drowning woman who had managed to grab hold of a life-saving straw, her originally dim expression instantly brightening.

Origin King Realm!

The legendary realm that no one on Shadowed Star had managed to reach in ten thousand years?

If this was true, then Shadow Moon Hall could truly be saved! Dong Xuan’er’s tender body trembled lightly as tears overflowed from her eyes. At this moment, she could not help thinking of all the Junior Brothers and Sisters who had died in front of her.

Finally, their spirits in Heaven could rest in peace. Her Honoured Master had returned and was now an Origin King! [In just a few days, he would be able to avenge all of you and bring justice to all the murderers who betrayed you!]

*Putong...*

The traitorous Origin Realm masters from Shadow Moon Hall immediately knelt as they stared towards Qian Tong in panic while begging for mercy.

“Great Elder, Subordinate knows his wrongs. Please spare me, Great Elder!”

“Great Elder, Subordinate was forced to comply! Those evildoers took my wives and daughters hostage, and I had no choice but to obey them! Please understand, Great Elder!”

“Great Elder, please spare our lives! Give us a chance to repent!”

“Great Elder, mercy please!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Qian Tong looked at them with disgust and hatred, took a light breath, and asked coldly, “Chang’er, Xuan’er, have they killed anyone from my Shadow Moon Hall?”

“Yes!” Wei Gu Chang replied with anger in his eyes.

The enemy using malicious methods was not worth hating, what was truly hateful were traitors who helped tyrants commit evil and oppress the innocent! Wei Gu Chang had seen more than once how these traitors had slaughtered their former compatriots.

“Good!” Qian Tong’s face remained calm in contrast to the dreadful anger which pulsed from his body, overwhelming the traitors before him as he delivered his judgement, “Since they’ve killed our brethren, nothing more needs to be said!”

As soon as he spoke these words, Qian Tong reached out his hand and pointed to the kneeling traitors.

Silently, all these kneeling traitors went stiff, as if they had been struck by lightning.

Everyone’s faces filled with pain, as if they were suffering some unbearable torture.

Then, a moment later, *Hong Hong Hong...*

With a series of loud bangs, all the traitors exploded and died, their Souls completely extinguished.

Only Xie Chen, who had lost all his limbs and whose meridians were completely shattered, crippling his cultivation permanently, remained.

“Kill me! Kill me!” Xie Chen shrieked.

As he was now, it would be far better to simply die. The cultivation he worked hundreds of years to obtain was wiped away by a single wrong decision as retribution for his misdeeds. Xie Chen now had nothing but regrets.

“A quick death is too good for you,” Qian Tong remained indifferent as he waved his hand and staunched the blood flowing from Xie Chen’s wound, reached out, and lifted him up before striding towards Heavenly Fate City.

“Chang’er, Xuan’er, come with this old master. We’re going to save your Martial Uncle Fei!”

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er exchanged a glance before excitedly following.

They knew that Qian Tong had truly been enraged this time, otherwise, with his temperament, it would have been impossible for him to launch such a vicious attack. Brutally killing those traitors was not unexpected, but Qian Tong preserving Xie Chen’s life, prolonging his suffering and fear, torturing him in body and mind, proved Qian Tong was going to make a grand statement this time.

“We’ll also follow,” Yang Kai motioned to Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang, “City Lord Fei assisted me in the past as well.”

“Since he is Junior Brother’s benefactor, we must definitely save him,” The two women replied in unison.

.....

Defences were tight in Heavenly Fate City. Every three steps, there was a guard, every five, a watch. It was as if the entire city was on high alert.

At the central square, a dishevelled Fei Zhi Tu was chained and shackled atop a tall stage.

His appearance was terrible and no energy fluctuations were coming from his body. It was unclear whether his cultivation was sealed or crippled.

However, despite his downtrodden appearance, he still stood straight.

Around the square, countless residents of Heavenly Fate City had gathered.

All the people in the crowd looked up at Fei Zhi Tu with expressions of extreme sadness and anger.

Fei Zhi Tu had served as the City Lord of Heavenly Fate City for many years, and although he had not done a perfect job, many from the city appreciated him for protecting their peace and prosperity.

However, since Corpse Spirit Religion had taken over, Heavenly Fate City had been thrown into complete anarchy.

Countless young children had inexplicably disappeared while countless beautiful girls had also been taken. On top of that, any time anyone from Heavenly Fate City showed the slightest bit of resistance, they would be brutally punished.

Compared to when Fei Zhi Tu was City Lord, life was a living hell.

Everyone deeply missed those days!

Today, however, was the date scheduled for Fei Zhi Tu’s execution. Corpse Spirit Religion wanted to use this display as a warning to all of Shadowed Star, about what miserable fate awaited those who dared oppose them.

Not far from Fei Zhi Tu’s high platform, a few high-level leaders from Shadow Moon Hall were seated. In the past, these people all had some connection with Fei Zhi Tu, many of them even calling him brother, but now they had all gathered around a luxuriously dressed young man with clear looks of flattery on their faces.

This boy truly looked quite young, no older than seventeen or eighteen, but his face was abnormally pale and there was an unusually cold aura around him which made everyone quite uncomfortable.

If one got close to this young man, they would be able to smell a faint rancid scent coming from his body.

At this moment, he was sitting under the scorching sun, seemingly a bit irritated. From time to time, he would even look up at the sun in the sky and mutter curses under his breath.

One of the high-ranking traitors from Shadow Moon Hall who noticed this behaviour immediately waved his hand and shouted, “Bring the blood sacrifice!”

With these words, a Saint King Realm cultivator rushed from nearby with a child in his arms.
