Fortunately, it seemed that Wu Ming’s Honoured Master was still busy with something. Yang Kai did not notice any movement after he brought Patriarch Gong back with him.

A quarter of an hour later, Hua Qing Si stepped onto the stage again.

Everyone looked up at the stage simultaneously, knowing that the second half of the auction was about to begin.

On the stage, Hua Qing Si announced in a sweet, feminine voice, “Thank you for waiting. The next item to be auctioned… is a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator!”

As soon as the announcement was made, everyone went into an uproar as each of them stared intently at the stage.

It had long been publicized that a Star Master from the Lower Star Fields would appear in this auction. At this moment, they undoubtedly assumed that the Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator Hua Qing Si mentioned was that Star Master.

Everyone was curious about the Star Master because they were a rarity even taking the entire Star Boundary into account.

Once there were many Star Masters, but some twenty thousand years ago, after Heaven Devouring Great Emperor destroyed many Star Fields, the channels connecting the Star Boundary and the various Star Fields were sealed, and the Masters from the Star Boundary could no longer easily travel to the Lower Star Fields to refine Star Sources.

Therefore, Star Masters were truly a rare existence in the Star Boundary nowadays.

Every Star Master possessed the essence of a complete Star Source in their body. If this Star Source could be extracted, one could inherit the position of Star Master for themselves, and their journey on the Martial Dao would become much smoother.

A skinny old man with a gloomy aura walked out from backstage like a ghost. The old man seemed to be affected by some kind of seal that caused his aura to be suppressed. Even so, he still gave out a ghastly feeling, especially the two clusters of ghost flames quivering in his pair of dreadfully horrifying sunken eyes

“Is this the Star Master?”

“Doesn’t look like anything special.”

“Having a complete Star Source but only reaching the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, it seems that his aptitude is not that good.”

“What do you know? It’s rumoured that all cultivators from the Lower Star Fields have top-notched aptitude as well as firm Martial Hearts, allowing them to dominate their respective Star Fields. If not, how could they make the arduous journey to the Star Boundary? Every cultivator who comes from the Lower Star Fields is comparable to a Core Disciple from a top Sect in terms of aptitude.”

There was a lot of discussion in the hall, with everyone whispering to each other, debating about the skinny old man on the stage.

They may not have seen a Star Master before, but they had at least heard some rumours about them.

Although it was rare for cultivators from the Lower Star Fields to reach the Star Boundary, many people knew that these cultivators were extremely rare talents, for they could still cultivate to the peak of the Martial Dao in their respective Star Fields despite the lack of good cultivation environments that exited everywhere in the Star Boundary.

It was precisely because of this that Liu Xian Yun told him that cultivators like them were very welcomed by many great forces back then when Yang Kai just arrived in the Star Boundary. They just needed to reveal that they were cultivators from a Lower Star Field, and they would definitely be accepted and trained vigorously by those big Sects.

Because cultivators like them had more hope to be promoted to the Emperor Realm than most cultivators from the Star Boundary.

“Gui Zu…” Inside room one, Yang Kai looked at the skinny old man on the stage with an unreadable expression, immediately recognizing him.

Gui Zu used to always be surrounded by Yin Qi, and ordinary people could not even see his true face. However, with his cultivation sealed, he could not release his usual aura.

His skinny and bony appearance was not because he was tortured, but rather his true form. Due to cultivating a Ghost Dao, his physique had already dried up and assumed its current form.

On the stage, Hua Qing Si continued, “He is not a Star Master, but he is a friend of that Star Master, and also a cultivator who came from the Lower Star Fields, so there is no need to worry about his aptitude.”

“Not the Star Master…”

“What the hell?”

“Why are they putting him up for auction if he’s not a Star Master? Is this a joke?”

Everyone below the stage started to yell unpleasantly, none seemingly willing to buy this old man.

“Jie jie jie jie…” Gui Zu cackled in a way that sounded like a vengeful ghost, causing chills for the cultivators in the hall.

“Sister Hua, enough games already,” Yang Kai suddenly shouted, “Your Honoured Master should be almost ready, just send him to me.”

Gui Zu stopped laughing, and turned to room one. Flabbergasted, the two wisps of ghost fire in his eyes immediately shone with a quaint beam.

Hua Qing Si smiled wryly, “Alright.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She didn’t want to continue this charade any longer either; however, she had no choice but to obey the orders given by her Honoured Master. However, since Yang Kai had spoken so, she was happy to cooperate. The most important thing was that her Honoured Master did not make any objections, so it could be seen that Yang Kai was right about him having almost finished his preparations, not needing to delay for any more time.

Saying so, Hua Qing Si gestured with her hand, and a maidservant led Gui Zu to room one.

The door opened, and Gui Zu entered the room. When he saw Yang Kai, he got excited and cupped his fists, “Sect Master!”

“Supreme Elder has suffered,” Yang Kai lifted him up.

“It was all this Old Master’s incompetence,” Gui Zu looked ashamed.

Back then, when he roamed Heng Luo Star Field, even though he was not invincible, he was a peak level existence. There was hardly anyone in the entire Star Field who could suppress a powerful Third-Order Origin King cultivator like him; however, when he reached Star Boundary, he was being restrained everywhere and even ended up being captured as a prisoner and taken out as an auction item for public display.

It was a huge disgrace.

Gui Zu also knew that the enemy was strong, not someone that he could provoke with his current strength. If Yang Kai had not appeared, he would have been sold to someone else and worked as a slave for the rest of his life.

Gui Zu could not help shuddering just thinking about it.

Ye Hen, Ye Jing Han, and the others hurriedly went forward to meet him.

Gui Zu and the others had spent a lot of time in Thousand Leaves Sect, so all of them were quite familiar with each other. At this moment, they were naturally happy he was able to get out of trouble.

“Let me help you to remove the restriction.” Yang Kai put his hand on Gui Zu’s shoulder and started to examine him with his Divine Sense. In the meantime, he asked, “How are Chi Yue and the rest now?”

Gui Zu replied, “Their lives are not in danger, but their cultivations were all sealed. It seems that they will be brought out for auction later too.”

Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgement, “That’s good.”

After saying that, the Emperor Qi in his body surged into Gui Zu at once.

A trace of redness unnaturally flashed across Gui Zu’s pale face, and he spat out a mouthful of black blood. In the next moment, he felt that his body was relieved, and the sealed Source Qi in his meridians began circulating again.

The ghastly Ghost Qi gushed out and surrounded him at once. “Sect Master, your cultivation…” Gui Zu was dumbfounded.

Although he did not fully understand how powerful the person who sealed his strength was, he still had some guesses.

That man should have been a legendary Third-Order Emperor Realm Master!

He could not believe that his Sect Master could remove the seal on him after just a few breaths of time. Did this mean that Yang Kai’s cultivation was on par with that old man? It was natural that Gui Zu was so shocked because this was simply too unbelievable.

After all, they all came to Star Boundary together, but now he and his fellow Brothers and Sister were just Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, while Yang Kai had walked far ahead of them. Gui Zu had no idea how Yang Kai progressed so rapidly during these few years.

“I just broke through to the Emperor Realm,” Yang Kai patted Gui Zu’s shoulder, “I’ll catch up with you later.”

Gui Zu nodded, but he was still amazed. Although Yang Kai’s cultivation was much weaker than he had imagined, it was astonishing that one could reach the Emperor Realm in such a short time.

It was especially amazing when he could easily remove the seal of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master with just his First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation

Yang Kai had often created miracles and defeated opponents stronger than himself back in Heng Luo Star Field, and it seemed that he had not changed since he came to Star Boundary.

Realizing this, Gui Zu was secretly excited.

The few of them hardly had anyone to rely on in the Star Boundary, and even the Thousand Leaves Sect that they stayed at had been exterminated. But after witnessing the power Yang Kai possessed, Gui Zu knew that he had a strong backer to depend on now.

A man walked out of backstage at that moment. Yang Kai looked up and saw that it was the previous Union Master of Sword Union, Gu Cang Yun.

Hua Qing Si did not even try to introduce Gu Cang Yun and just signalled the maidservant to bring him to room one.

Soon, he was delivered to the room.

Gu Cang Yun was both surprised and delighted to see Yang Kai. It was Yang Kai who saved them the last time when they were in trouble in Sky Crane City, and now, a few years later, he came to the rescue again.

This made Gu Cang Yun lament in his heart that he still had to rely on others just to preserve his life.

The next who was brought out was Ai Ou.

The auction hall went horribly silent. The people there thought that the first half of the auction was strange enough, with the entire process being just an interaction between Yang Kai and Hua Qing Si, not leaving room for others to interrupt at all.

But they did not expect that the second half of the auction would be worse than the first.

The auctioneer did not even try to auction the ‘items’, nor did room one bother to bid. The whole process was just the ‘items’ being brought out and then delivered to room one.

What made them feel even more bewildered was that the Emperor Realm Masters in the private rooms were being quiet too, none of them questioning or complaining about anything.

No one had ever participated in such an auction. The whole auction looked just like a farce, which annoyed many people.

“Almost there!” Yang Kai stated with his eyes narrowed after settling Ai Ou down.

“What’s almost there?” Ai Ou looked at him with confusion, the shock on his face not having disappeared yet.

Just now when he learnt that Yang Kai had broken through to the Emperor Realm, he could not believe it until Yang Kai removed the seal on his cultivation.

As Yang Kai’s prospective father-in-law, Ai Ou was not sure whether he should be happy for him or feel frustrated. He was glad that his little girl, Xue Yue, had found a good man, but he did not know how many young women this prodigal son had flirted with in the Star Boundary over the years.

There were many good women in the Star Boundary, and given Yang Kai’s capabilities, it would only be normal for him to have a few women by his side.

If Xue Yue could come to the Star Boundary from their native Star Field one day, Ai Ou was afraid that she would not be able to compete with these Star Boundary women. As a father, Ai Ou could not help worrying. Sometimes it was not a good thing for a man to be too outstanding, especially a son-in-law.
