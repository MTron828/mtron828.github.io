The Black Ink Clan speculated that Yang Kai was probably hiding somewhere to recuperate; after all, every time he appeared, he would be wounded. However, it wouldn’t take him a long time to recover. The Human named Yang Kai seemed to have an incredible restorative ability. Regardless of how badly injured he was, he could always recover in ten days to half a month.

Based on the information they had gathered from the Black Ink Disciples, this kind of restorative power must have something to do with his Dragon Clan bloodline. Dragon Clan members were known to be able to heal their wounds quickly.

As expected, Yang Kai reappeared half a month later. Just like the Black Ink Clan had speculated, he appeared in a neighbouring Territory Lord’s territory of the Black Ink Nest that he previously destroyed.

Although over 100 Feudal Lords were already waiting there, and they had set up a restrictive Spirit Array with the help of the Black Ink Disciples, they still couldn’t ward off the 30,000-metre-long Grand Dragon.

Just like what happened previously, the Grand Dragon destroyed the Black Ink Nest and shattered the Universe World it sat on. Although he was badly injured, he still managed to break through the siege and escape.

Another Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest was gone for good.

This caused the Black Ink Clansmen to be furious. The destruction of the Black Ink Nests united all these Black Ink Clansmen as the Feudal Lords swore that they would kill Yang Kai for the humiliation he had inflicted upon them.

The Black Ink Clan intensified their search for Yang Kai, which made it hard for him to recuperate in peace.

Despite their best efforts though, a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest would be destroyed by Yang Kai every half a month. Faced with the ferocious Grand Dragon, these Black Ink Clansmen didn’t have a solution as there were no powerful Masters among them who could confront the enemy head-on.

One day, when Yang Kai transformed into a Grand Dragon and arrived at a Territory Lord’s direct territory, he saw nearly 200 Feudal Lords charging towards him.

After an intense battle, he managed to kill quite a number of them, but their defence line held, so he was unable to get close to the Black Ink Nest. Faced with so many Feudal Lords, he wouldn’t dare to be reckless; otherwise, he would most likely be killed.

Left with no choice, he fled for now.

It had been about half a year since Yang Kai destroyed the first Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. During this period of time, he had destroyed 10 Territory Lords’ Black Ink Nests.

In the past, the Feudal Lords were unable to stave him off regardless of how hard they tried, but this time, they managed to force him to withdraw without achieving his goal.

Seeing that the Grand Dragon turned around to flee, the Feudal Lords became high-spirited and cheered in ecstasy. Some of the bold Feudal Lords even chased after Yang Kai, but they eventually lost track of him.

Although the Feudal Lords were unable to make Yang Kai stay, it was the first time they gained a victory against this opponent. With their hard work and perseverance, they saved a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest that Yang Kai had targeted. This was a meaningful victory for all the Black Ink Clansmen that was worth celebrating.

Unlike how joyful the Black Ink Clansmen were, Yang Kai was extremely vexed.

He had repeatedly made a move recently, and even though he had made a huge contribution by destroying quite a number of Territory Lord Black Ink Nests and killing a lot of Feudal Lords, he came to the realisation that, as time passed, he faced increasingly strong resistance.

Furthermore, he found many of the Feudal Lords familiar. In other words, he had seen them before.

His target was clear, which was to destroy Territory Lord Black Ink Nests.

Usually, a territory where a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest was located would have 100 or so Feudal Lords inhabiting it. Once he managed to destroy the nest though, these Feudal Lords would head to the neighbouring Black Ink Nests to provide reinforcements. That was the reason he came across so many Feudal Lords on this day, and many of them looked familiar to him. It was apparent that he faced them before.

In that case, as he destroyed more Black Ink Nests, he would face stiffer resistance.

Yang Kai was unable to achieve his goal on this day as nearly 200 Feudal Lords went all out to protect the Black Ink Nest. Although he had turned into a Grand Dragon, he was still unable to break through their defences and instead, he was terribly injured.

It seemed that he had to stop this game at this point. If he still recklessly continued, an accident was likely to happen.

Fortunately, he had already destroyed a lot of Territory Lord Black Ink Nests, thus dealing a heavy blow to the Black Ink Clan. He had also snatched vast amounts of resources from several Territory Lords’ territories and killed countless Black Ink Clansmen. It could be said that he had made a huge contribution.

Despite his reluctance, Yang Kai still decided to end his actions here.

He believed that after the chaos he raised this time, the foundation of the Black Ink Clan in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain had been severely damaged. It would take them several hundred to 1,000 years to fully recover. The Black Ink Clan must be extremely vexed that 10 Territory Lord Black Ink Nests had been destroyed, which resulted in several dozen more Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests withering as well.

Since he had made up his mind, Yang Kai found a remote place to recuperate in peace.

It was destined that his journey back home wouldn’t be smooth sailing though. Other than the fact that he would run into a lot of Black Ink Clansmen along the way, he would also have to deal with the Black Ink Clan Army besieging Yin-Yang Pass.

Several days later, Yang Kai, who was recuperating, suddenly thought of something. He turned into a Soul Avatar and appeared in his Small Universe.

This was a place with lush mountains and clear rivers. The 300 Artifact Refiners that Yang Kai had kept inside his Small Universe were settled down here. In any case, other than recuperating in such a serene place, there was nothing else they could do.

This was Yang Kai’s Small Universe, after all. If they activated their World Forces as they pleased, it would cause a burden on Yang Kai. They might even damage or contaminate Yang Kai’s Small Universe.

With that in mind, they had been doing nothing recently, which was why they were quite bored.

However, after such a long time, they still had no idea what was going on in the outside world, and Yang Kai didn’t seem to have the intention of releasing them. It was expected that Wu Xing He and the others were worried about Yang Kai, and they wanted to ask him what was going on.

Therefore, the moment Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar appeared, they promptly surrounded him.

“What’s wrong, Senior Brothers?” Yang Kai asked.

Wu Xing He said, “Junior Brother Yang, haven’t we returned to the Inner Sanctum?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Not yet. There’s been an accident. We’re still inside the Black Ink Clan’s territory.”

“We’re still in enemy territory?” Guan Ning was astounded.

Wang Si Bo asked with concern, “What kind of accident? Is there anything we can help you with?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “The Black Ink Clan’s territory is filled with Black Ink Clouds and Black Ink Strength, so it’s best you stay here lest you become corrupted again.”

“As for what accident occurred… It’s no big deal. Recently, I’ve been destroying some Black Ink Nests.” Yang Kai briefly told them what he had been up to. It wasn’t that he wanted to brag, but he understood that these Artifact Refiners were apprehensive as they had been staying in his Small Universe and unable to find out what was going on in the outside world. Therefore, he decided to tell them what he had done to let them know that it wasn’t that he was unable to return to the Inner Sanctum. He just didn’t want to go back without dealing a heavy blow to the Black Ink Clan first.

Upon hearing that Yang Kai had single-handedly destroyed so many Territory Lord Black Ink Nests and killed countless Black Ink Clansmen, these Artifact Refiners were dumbfounded.

They couldn’t really believe what they had just heard.

After all, Yang Kai was just a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Although most of the strongest Black Ink Clansmen had left the Royal Domain, even an Eighth-Order Division Commander would be unable to pull off such a feat.

However, they knew that it wasn’t necessary for Yang Kai to lie to them. In other words, such things had really happened.

Wu Xing He and the others were astonished as admiration was written all over their faces.

A moment later, Wu Xing He came to his senses and asked, “Junior Brother, you mean, after a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest is destroyed, all of the sub-nests that originated from that Black Ink Nest will wither as well?”

Yang Kai nodded, “That’s right.”

Wu Xing He quickly ran the numbers in his mind, “A Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest is connected to several dozen Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests. In other words, hundreds of Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests have been destroyed as a result.”

“I think so.”

All of them gasped.

Wang Si Bo said in a shaking voice, “You’ve also injured Hei Yuan?”

Yang Kai nodded, “He wanted to fight me using only our Souls, but he had no idea that I possess the Soul Warming Lotus. He basically found the wrong opponent. Unfortunately, even though I’ve managed to wound his Soul, I have no idea where he is now. I’ve failed in my attempts to find him; otherwise, I could seize this chance and end his life.”

“The Soul Warming Lotus…” Wu Xing He muttered under his breath. He had certainly heard of this Supreme Treasure before, but it never crossed his mind that such a valuable item was in Yang Kai’s possession.

With the Soul Warming Lotus protecting Yang Kai’s Soul, it was expected that Hei Yuan would lose in such a contest.

“Anyway, the Black Ink Clan have suffered immense losses recently; however, the Feudal Lords who are still around have gathered together around the surviving Territory Lord Black Ink Nests, so I’m no longer able to keep attacking. It’s time we went home.”

Upon hearing that, Wu Xing He nodded, “You’d better keep yourself safe, Junior Brother. You’re just a Seventh-Order Master now, but you’ve managed to make such a huge contribution. When you ascend to the Eighth Order in the future, you’ll be a pillar of strength for the Human Race. You must prioritise your safety at all times.”

Yang Kai replied humbly, “Many thanks for your compliment, Senior Brother.”

“How confident are you that you can kill Hei Yuan if you find him?” Wang Si Bo suddenly asked.

After pondering on it for a moment, Yang Kai shook his head, “I have no idea; however, since Hei Yuan’s Soul is damaged, he must be significantly weakened now. If I run into him, I’ll stand a chance to end his life. Why do you ask, Senior Brother Wang?”

A hint of hesitation flashed through Wang Si Bo’s face.

Realising something, Yang Kai asked, “Do you have a way to locate Hei Yuan?”

Wang Si Bo remained silent. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nevertheless, his silence meant that he definitely had a way to find Hei Yuan. Yang Kai promptly said, “Senior Brother Wang, if you have a solution, why don’t you tell me about it? Although I’ve destroyed a lot of Mid-Rank Black Ink Nests and severely damaged their foundation, Black Ink Nests can still be hatched again. It will just take them some time and energy to nurture these Black Ink Nests. However, it will be different if we have a chance to kill Hei Yuan, who is one of the top five Territory Lords serving Mu Guang. Killing Hei Yuan will deal much longer-lasting damage than destroying 10 Territory Lord Black Ink Nests. His death will be a severe blow to the Black Ink Clan.”

After a sigh, Wang Si Bo said, “I wouldn’t dare to say that I can definitely find him, but I can give it a try.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened, “I’m all ears.”

Wang Si Bo went on to say, “Hei Yuan has a defensive artifact that was made by me.”
