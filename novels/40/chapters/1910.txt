On the ninth level of the Alchemist Pavilion, with the purple mist circling around the Purple Origin Furnace and its lid shut tight, no one could see the changes happening inside, nor could they hear a single sound.

As such, the five hundred or so Alchemists withdrew their gazes.

Since they couldn’t see anything on Yang Kai’s side, all they could do was turn their attention back to Zuo De.

There weren’t that many chances to observe and emulate an Origin King Grade Alchemy Grandmaster refine pills so closely. If they didn’t cherish this opportunity, they would regret it for life.

Furthermore, rumour had that Grandmaster Zuo De was quite a pretentious man. Usually, even if these Alchemists visited him in person, they might not even see a glance of Zuo De, but thanks to Yang Kai, they had the chance to observe and emulate his Alchemy skills.

As this thought crossed everyone’s mind, many people actually thanked Yang Kai in their hearts, though only slightly. At the same time, they sympathized with him as well.

Even if he had the Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, he couldn’t win against a veteran Origin King Grade Alchemist.

Time slowly went by as the entire ninth floor of the Alchemist Pavilion became shrouded in a heavy atmosphere.

At first, the Alchemists were often exclaiming and discussing a lot, admiring Zuo De’s amazing skills. But as time passed, everyone stopped talking. Everyone’s attention was completely focused on the Zuo De and the pill furnace before him.

Many Alchemists were absorbed in their enlightenment. Obviously, they had quite a bit of harvest but they didn’t have the time to understand it in depth. All they could do was suppress all of their ideas and thoughts for now and recall them later slowly.

Gradually, medicinal fragrance started to permeate into the surroundings, rising from Zuo De’s pill furnace.

The fragrance was light and refreshing. It seemed as if an invisible hand was caressing every Alchemist; they appeared to be enjoying it.

Zhan Yuan, watching the movements in Zuo De’s pill furnace, looked most excited. From time to time, he would glance at Yang Kai with a mocking smile on his lips, like the victory was already in their grasp.

He found that ever since Yang Kai brought out the Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, there was no other unusual movement thereafter, as if no pill was being refined on that side.

This made him even more proud.

He could not help but think how Yang Kai would become Zuo De’s servant once he lost. And as Zuo De’s disciple, his status would be naturally higher than a servant. If Yang Kai lived with them together, he could order Yang Kai to do things as he liked!

[Hmm, well, he is still a Second-Order Origin King. I still have to give him a little face otherwise he might become angry out of shame. I guess I can’t really beat him.]

[I guess I can only ask him to clean my room every day. Also, he seems to know the basics of Alchemy. I can also ask him to be my assistant.]

[It’s decided then!] Thinking of better days ahead, Zhan Yuan felt even happier than marrying a bewitching beauty. He couldn’t wait to dance around to show his excitement.

Just like that, two days had gone by in a flash.

At present, Zuo De cut an extremely sorry figure; his entire body was sweating buckets, which was then evaporated by the high temperature around him, making him look extremely dishevelled.

But no one scorned him.

Because Zuo De was an Origin Returning Realm cultivator. And he was getting older to boot. He had been refining the pill for two days straight; no one could bear this.

Zuo De might not be looking good but he was filled with excitement. His eyes were glowing.

Whereas on Yang Kai’s side, it had been calm and uneventful all the while. Nothing noticeable happened over these two days. Only the purple mist kept dancing around the Purple Origin Furnace.

At some point, Zuo De’s figure jolted as his hands suddenly formed some mysterious seals.

Everyone immediately cried in excitement.

“Grandmaster’s very own Pill Condensing Technique!”

“Is this the rumoured Red Lotus Divine Hands Method? It’s indeed true to its reputation! It isn’t worse than any ancient Pill Condensing Techniques. It might even be better.”

“I have devised this type of technique once, but compared to Grandmaster’s, it’s nothing!”

“This Pill Condensing Technique was created by Grandmaster himself. How can you compare yourself with Grandmaster?”

The crowd of Alchemists immediately became spirited. Everyone’s eyes were glued on Zuo De’s movements; they weren’t willing to miss any details. They would have hit it big if they could see through the mysteries of this set of Pill Condensing Technique.

Zuo De’s hands danced in the air like butterflies, slapping the pill furnace before him, again and again. Every time he smacked the pill furnace, a red lotus would appear, which would then crumble into pieces before flying into the pill furnace, creating a magic effect on the pill that was about to be formed in the pill furnace.

This was the very Red Lotus Divine Hands Method created by Zuo De!

Zuo De smacked eighty-one palms on the pill furnace, one after another, as eighty-one lotus seals made their way into the pill furnace.

After he hit the pill furnace for the last time, a reverberating crisp sound suddenly rang from the pill furnace. At the same time, the medicinal fragrance wafting out of the furnace suddenly grew richer.

“He has finished refining!” Someone exclaimed in surprise as a frantic look appeared in his eyes.

All the Alchemists present here were very familiar with this scene. Obviously, it was the sign of successful refinement of the pill. Furthermore, judging by the sound from the pill furnace and the medicinal fragrance lingering in the air, Grandmaster Zuo De’s Alchemy this time ended in absolute perfection!

[Grandmaster’s reputation is indeed well-deserved. He only took two days to refine a Mid-Rank Origin King Grade pill. Grandmaster Zuo De is second to none among all the Origin King Grade Alchemists in the entire Star Field!]

Suddenly, Zuo De turned serious and slapped the pill furnace hard before its lid flew up. At the same time, a light blue thing shot out of the pill furnace at an extremely fast speed.

But Zuo De was already prepared. He reached out and immediately froze that light blue mass in its place. Taking and throwing it into the already prepared jade bottle in his other hand with a flick of his hand.

CLANG...

The crisp sound from the bottle made everyone focus their straight at the source.

Zuo De stood and broke into laughter. Although he appeared to be in a mess, his face was extremely ruddy.

“Congratulations, Grandmaster! After refining such a perfect pill today, Grandmaster is just a step away from advancing to the Mid-Rank Origin King Grade.”

“That’s right! The Soul Source Restoration pill is a Mid-Rank Origin King Grade pill. I’m afraid even another Alchemist of the same level would not find it as easy to refine as Grandmaster. Grandmaster seems to have already reached the Mid-Rank Origin King Grade.”

“Grandmaster is indeed a role model for our generations. My skills are nothing before you!”

The crowd of Alchemists broke into a lively discussion. Some took the opportunity to flatter, some congratulated Zuo De sincerely, one after another. All kinds of comments could be heard coming from the crowd.

A smile appeared on Zuo De’s face as he cupped his fists and said, holding the jade bottle in his hand, “Thank you, everyone. This old man is just a step ahead in exploring the Alchemic Way, that’s all. Everyone here is an elite Alchemist. Your future achievements may not be worse than this old man’s.”

Apparently, Zuo De seemed to be in a good mood because everything went so smoothly. He was extremely friendly to everyone.

“Honoured Teacher, may this disciple have the honour to take a look at this pill?” Zhan Yuan, who was well versed in the ways of ass-kissing, naturally knew what to say at this moment.

“Take it!” Zuo De carelessly threw the jade bottle in his hand to Zhan Yuan. Zhan Yuan, pretending to be horrified, carefully took it and studied the Soul Source Restoration Pill through the bottle. He suddenly exclaimed in the next moment, “Honoured Teacher is indeed awesome. This pill is round and transparent, and its medicinal properties are quite concentrated to boot. I’m afraid it has reached High-Rank in quality alone. If it could go one step further, I’m afraid it would have given birth to Pill Veins.”

The expression on some of the Alchemists’ faces grew a bit unnatural, thinking that Zhan Yuan had gone a bit over with his ass-kissing.

[It’s already impressive that he was able to refine an Origin King Grade Pill. And now, you are even craving for Pill Veins.]

[In the entire Star Field, no one in tens of thousands of years seemed to have refined an Origin King Grade pill with Pill Veins.

Although such thoughts were circling in everyone’s mind, no one pointed it out.

One by one, everyone turned their gazes at the jade bottle in Zhan Yuan’s hand. How could Zhan Yuan not know what was going in everyone’s mind? After confirming with Zuo De, he passed the jade bottle to another Alchemist to study.

As the jade bottle went around the Alchemists’ hands, every Alchemist poured out their praises and marvels.

Zuo De felt extremely proud of his success. He seemed to have become a few hundred years younger.

“Grandpa, you are done but what about that guy?” Zuo Ling suddenly asked.

“Let’s just go and see.” Zuo De smiled.

Zhan Yuan smiled and said, rubbing his palms, “Teacher, you don’t understand, this disciple has kept an eye on that guy for the past two days. At first, your disciple thought that with his Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, his Alchemy skills must be superb. But unfortunately...”

“Unfortunately what!?”

“Unfortunately, he only has Conflagrated Knowledge Sea, and nothing else!” Zhan Yuan broke into laughter.

Zuo De reprimanded but a slight smile could be seen hanging on his lips, “You should not underestimate anyone. The Conflagrated Knowledge Sea provides an unimaginable edge to us Alchemists. He doesn’t seem to absolutely ignorant of this, perhaps he really is an Alchemist.”

“Teacher, you are right. However, even if he is an Alchemist, he is far behind you, Teacher,” said Zhan Yuan.

Zuo De proudly smiled and waved his hand, “As you can see, the youngsters these days...”

At this point, the crowd led by Zuo De arrived before Yang Kai.

“Congratulations, Grandmaster.” As the host, President Ai Ou might be standing on Yang Kai’s side but he couldn’t help but bow and congratulate Zuo De since Zuo De was here. And judging by everyone’s discussion, he knew that Zuo De had already finished refining the Soul Source Restoration pill. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

His feelings were complicated.

On one hand, the successful refinement of the Soul Source Restoration pill made him very happy as Gu Bi Hu could be saved now.

But on the other hand, Yang Kai’s freedom for two thousand years was put at stake for this pill. If Yang Kai lost, he would no longer be able to rest easy.

So, Ai Ou didn’t know whether he should be happy or worried. Deep down, all he could do was pray for a miracle that Yang Kai could successfully refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill.

“I should be the one congratulating President Ai Ou.” Zuo De smiled as he stretched his hand out. Zhan Yuan hurriedly offered the jade bottle with both hands before Zuo De took it and gifted it to Ai Ou. “Since the Soul Source Restoration Pill is refined, Mrs. Gu will be all right now!”

Ai Ou forced a smile. “Thank you very much for your help, Grandmaster!”

“It’s my duty! After all, this old man is the Foreign Elder of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, and Mrs. Gu is President Ai Ou’s wife. Since Mrs. Gu is in trouble, this old man can’t sit idly!” Zuo De replied, earnestly.

Ai Ou almost couldn’t help but curse his mother.

[This old bastard is saying this now! Where did your conscience go before? Weren’t you forcing this King to agree to Xue Yue’s marriage?]

[You are really shameless!]
