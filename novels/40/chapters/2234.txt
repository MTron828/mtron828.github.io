“Masked man, huh...”

While Yang Kai was still shocked, a soft and pleasant voice came from behind the pink drapery which seemed to be able to penetrate his mind and soul, setting off invisible ripples that made Yang Kai’s head feel jittery for a long time.

He took several deep breaths and concentrated to calm himself down once more.

“For you to call this Queen in such a way... is not unacceptable,” the woman behind the curtain continued in an unhurried tone.

“Could Senior be the Lord... Queen of this Divine Ascension Country?” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed.

“Indeed!” The other party admitted frankly, “But no one knows the true face of this Queen. Even Zhou Dian has never seen it.”

Yang Kai was stunned at this, but very soon, he felt a bad feeling inside of him.

Even though her words did not reveal any important information, it gave Yang Kai an ominous premonition, as if she had just revealed a big secret in front of him, one he would need to pay a heavy price for.

Yang Kai could not help but laugh awkwardly, “Junior is honoured, but Junior wonders, why is Senior treating me so well?”

As he spoke, his mind raced, but he couldn’t understand any of the critical points here.

“Because... this Queen must,” The lazy figure lounging on the bed slowly sat up straight and beckoned to Yang Kai through the curtain, “Come closer!”

Yang Kai frowned, his eyes filled with iciness as he said dully, “Junior has no right to refuse, right?”

“You can try!”

Yang Kai sighed and could only approach her slowly.

And, as he walked forwards, he could clearly perceive a momentary unstable fluctuation in the woman’s Soul, as if she was expecting, even longing for something.

The anticipation and longing were palpable enough to even destabilize the Soul of a Master of her level.

But Yang Kai was not naive enough to think that the other party had taken a fancy to him. If that was really the case, then she did not have to go to such lengths. With the strength she showed before, she could easily make him behave however she wanted.

If her eyes weren’t on him, then it had to be something he possessed.

When he thought of this, Yang Kai’s heart clenched.

When he reached the curtain, Yang Kai took a deep breath and lifted it up, looking inside.

There, a short distance away, the image of the woman’s face was instantly imprinted into his eyes.

Yang Kai could not help but feel a little dizzy as the other party was indeed a country destroying beauty. It was a flawless face that seemed so perfect it should not exit beneath the Heavens.

But... the moment Yang Kai saw this face, he had a strange feeling that he had seen it somewhere before.

He carefully recalled the faces of all the Emperor Realm Masters he encountered, but Yang Kai found none that matched, making him feel quite puzzled.

When their eyes met, the woman’s beautiful eyes burst with oppressive light that seemed to envelop Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s body froze in place and he felt as if he was about to fall into an abyss that would never end.

Horrified, he quickly exclaimed, “Senior...”

But the woman did not pay him any heed to his protest and muttered excitedly, “You are the last one, so that thing must be inside your body. If I can obtain that treasure, then this Queen will be able to refine this world and truly become its Master! Be obedient and cooperate, and this Queen may spare your life, even ensure you a lifetime of glory and wealth, but if you dare resist, then this Queen will make you beg for death!”

At the last sentence, the woman’s originally beautiful face became extremely hideous and her tone became ghastly, as if she was on the verge of going mad.

On the other hand, Yang Kai listened to her with a bewildered feeling.

[The last person, a treasure to refine this world...] He had no idea what she was talking about at all.

He had the intention to resist, but under the influence of the other party’s Soul pressure, even thinking was starting to become difficult, much less moving his body.

The woman rose up, her tender body swaying as she moved in front of Yang Kai. Raising a jade finger, she pressed it directly onto Yang Kai’s forehead.

In the next instant, pure Spiritual Energy flowed into Yang Kai’s body through that finger.

Yang Kai’s body trembled and his eyes became dull. It felt as if his entire body had just been subjected to unbearable torture, endlessly shaking and spasming.

A heavy consciousness and confused thoughts were all normal reactions when one’s Soul was disturbed.

Yang Kai finally understood why Xia Sheng and the others would end up as they did.

They clearly went through the same thing. How could a Dao Source Realm cultivator be able to withstand the assault of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master’s Soul? The fact that their Souls had not been completely extinguished was already a testament to their strength.

The woman went on, seemingly searching for something inside of Yang Kai, her expression ever-changing whilst Yang Kai’s mind was hazy, seemingly only half awake.

While in a trance, he heard the woman praise, “What pure Spiritual Energy. You really are special, boy. Even with just a First-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivation, you possess such immense Spiritual Energy. In time, you will become a great weapon!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A short while later, the woman suddenly burst into a mad bout of laughter, “I found it! Hahahahaha, sure enough, it is the Soul Warming Lotus! The Soul Warming Lotus! This Queen did not see wrongly! And it has already reached the seven-coloured grade, fully capable of bearing the weight of the Mirror Soul... Wen Zi Shan, once this Queen has finished refining this world, this Queen will not let you off easy!”

As her words fell, a look of extreme ruthlessness blossomed in her beautiful eyes, her tender body transforming into a stream of light that shot straight into Yang Kai’s brows, entering his Soul Avatar as if she had turned immaterial.

If anyone saw this scene, they would definitely be shocked, because such a practice was filled with dangers. Two different Souls could not be fused easily and the slightest mistake when attempting to do so could lead to the destruction of both Souls. Unless one had incredible control, even if they succeeded, they may still be contaminated by the other’s mind and lose their sense of self.

But this woman obviously has extremely strong control and was not worried about Yang Kai’s mind contaminating her Soul.

Shooting into Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar, she headed straight for the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, landing at the centre of it in just an instant.

The pure energy enveloped her, and the gentle feeling of it could not help but make her moan.

The Soul Warming Lotus was a precious treasure that nourished the Soul, a unique existence in the entire Star Boundary.

The Soul Warming Lotus had been recorded in ancient texts, but it had only really appeared two or three times throughout all of recorded history.

If not for this coincidental opportunity, then it was simply impossible for the woman to know that Yang Kai had a Soul Warming Lotus inside his body.

Laughing with great pleasure, it seemed as if she was able to see a prosperous path ahead already stretched out in front of her.

However...

Just as she was about to refine the Soul Warming Lotus, a seven-coloured glow suddenly blossomed from the precious treasure, which turned into a seven coloured halo.

The halo seemed to have unstoppable force, and the impact on the woman’s Soul Avatar caused her face to pale.

Her face changed and she cried out, resisting the rejection of the Soul Warming Lotus.

But before she could do anything, a loud buzzing noise suddenly reached her ears.

Stunned, the woman looked up, only to see a dense cloud of tiny insects in front of her, converging on her like locusts onto a field.

“Soul Devouring Insects!” The woman’s face turned ashen as she shrieked, “How can there be Soul Devouring Insects here?”

In the next instant, she suddenly understood and hissed in disbelief, “That little brat was raising these Soul Devouring Insects in the Soul Warming Lotus? He must be insane! Insane!”

*Hong hong...*

As she finished speaking, the seven-coloured halo of the Soul Warming Lotus gushed at her again, and even with her strength, she was forced to retreat. She could not fight it at all, because this was the rejection of the precious treasure itself, an aura of rejection towards anyone but its Master.

The light on the woman’s body dimmed a little. Seeing that the light was only growing more intense and the cloud of Soul Devouring Insects were becoming wilder by the moment, she shouted furiously and had no choice but to retreat.

A light flashed in the room and the woman’s body reappeared; however, compared to her earlier calm, she now looked a little dishevelled.

Before she could regain her footing though, a sharp chill descended from the sky and struck her head-on.

This chill was so strong that it actually made her feel threatened.

Under the woman’s shock, her tender body was shaken by an invisible force that struck her head-on.

With a muffled grunt, Yang Kai’s body flew backwards.

*Weng weng weng...*

The cloud of Soul Devouring Insects flew out from Yang Kai’s body and flew straight at the woman, enveloping her instantly.

To these Soul Devouring Insects, a Soul as powerful as this woman’s was the most delicious meal in this world.

So, even without Yang Kai’s intention, the Soul Devouring Insects began swarming the woman like crazy, wrapping her up in layers without any leaks in no time.

The woman did not dare to dally in this situation either. With a shake of her body, a barrier formed around her and stopped the Soul Devouring Insects from injuring her Soul.

Soul Devouring Insects were the bane of all Souls, so even with her powerful cultivation, this woman was unable to kill them. At most, she could suppress and prevent these Soul Devouring Insects from attacking her.

But this was not a long-term solution as even the barrier she formed to protect herself was made of Spiritual Energy. As the Soul Devouring Insects gnawed on it, its protection would grow weaker and weaker.

The woman had to constantly release her energy to maintain the barrier.

She turned her head again and looked gloomily at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes fixing on the long blade in his hand. Suddenly, she shouted with horror, “Emperor Artifact! A Soul-type Emperor Artifact!”

The sharp, cold threat she felt just now had clearly come from this Emperor Artifact. It was only an artifact of this calibre that could cause such a reaction.

She could not help but sneer as she looked at Yang Kai, “You have some skills, brat, and plenty of strange treasures to help as well. You actually unlocked the seal right under this Queen’s nose! That is enough to impress this Queen!”
