The smile on Zi Dong’s face instantly stiffened and his brow twitched vigorously.

Even Zi Long suddenly opened his eyes and stared deeply at Yang Kai.

Even though his mental discipline was strong, he could not help becoming irritated by Yang Kai. If it were not for the Seven Coloured Radiant Light that could even corrode Spiritual Energy, Zi Long would definitely have used a Soul Skill to turn Yang Kai into a true idiot in order to shut his mouth permanently.

But now, even if he couldn’t wait to strangle Yang Kai, he could only endure his anger.

He believed that Yang Kai had seen this too, which was why he was acting so unscrupulous.

“I, Zi Dong, swear here: I will make you taste the most brutal torture in the whole world!” Zi Dong ground his teeth as he shouted with extreme hatred.

He was completely enraged now. He had been humiliated by Yang Kai three times in front of his father and even implicated his father in that abuse. How could he bear such a thing? Yang Kai had to suffer immensely to soothe the hatred in Zi Dong’s heart.

“I’m so scared!” Yang Kai looked at Zi Dong coldly, “But little doggy, swearing a vow isn’t something you should just do at random. If you fail to follow through, you will be condemned by the Heavens!”

Zi Dong glared bitterly at Yang Kai without saying a word.

He could see that he was not Yang Kai’s opponent when it came to trading insults; after all, he had almost no experience in this field before. After being provoked by Yang Kai several times, he was completely unable to stabilize his mood and his face twisted in a mixture of hatred and gloominess.

To the side, however, Zi Long frowned.

Zi Dong was blinded by his anger at the moment and might not be aware of the insidiousness of Yang Kai’s words just now, but as an established Origin King with immense life experience, how could Zi Long not understand the hidden implications of what had just transpired?

Yang Kai’s words sounded plain on the surface, as if he was just having a meaningless argument with Zi Dong.

But if one thought about it carefully, they were extremely vicious.

Because once Zi Dong failed to uphold his oath, Yang Kai’s existence would definitely become a heart demon to him!

Zi Dong was now a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and his next breakthrough would be to the next Great Realm, the Origin King Realm. This was an extremely critical and dangerous juncture, and if a heart demon were to disturb Zi Dong during his breakthrough, it would cause his breakthrough to fail at best, and his Soul being extinguished at worst.

So, when Zi Long heard Yang Kai say this, he realized just how shrewd and vindictive the latter was.

This boy was clearly not a fool; but if that was the case, why had he intentionally angered him and Xu Wei over and over again? What exactly was this young man trying to do?

Did he have complete confidence that he could escape from under the nose of himself and Xu Wei?

Despite his immense cultivation and wealth of knowledge, Zi Long really could not understand what Yang Kai was thinking.

However, judging from the current situation, it was absolutely impossible to simply let this boy off. As long as he was alive, he would become a heart demon that interfered with Zi Dong’s rise. As such... he had to die!

Zi Long secretly made up his mind that, he would do his utmost to suppress Yang Kai once the Seven Coloured Radiant Light retreated and allow Zi Dong to complete his vow. After suppressing Yang Kai, he would snatch the Enlightenment Flowers from Xu Wei.

Zi Long was confident that with his great strength, he would not have any difficulty accomplishing these tasks.

“Boy!” Xu Wei called out again, his tone impatient, “This old master will ask you one last time, will you cooperate with this old master or not?”

“Scram!” Yang Kai turned his head towards Xu Wei’s direction and spat with a disdainful expression, “What the hell do you count for? Do I need to cooperate with you?”

“Good, good, good!” Xu Wei was also livid at Yang Kai and coldly declared, “Then, this old master will watch to see how you die!”

There was no doubt that Yang Kai would die here. Xu Wei was confident that even if he didn’t take action, Zi Long would not let Yang Kai go, so he didn’t bother trying to win over Yang Kai anymore and was simply preparing to sit atop the mountain and watch the tigers fight.

“You don’t need to worry about that!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly as he began to stretch, cracking his neck and rotating his shoulders, seemingly loosening himself up. Speaking to himself, while at the same time jabbing at Zi Long and Xu Wei, “It’s almost time, this Young Master won’t waste any more words on you.”

He put up the appearance of a man about to do something special.

The other three watched fixedly, not knowing what Yang Kai was up to.

But in the next instant, three pairs of eyes bulged as they observed Yang Kai’s movements in a daze, looks of shock covering their faces.

On the other side, Yang Kai took a step forward with an indifferent expression, then another, then another, and another...

After only a few steps, he arrived at the edge of the safe zone the Void Crack provided for him and as long as he proceeded another step, he would enter the glowing Seven Coloured Radiant Light, putting himself in an extremely precarious position.

“What’s wrong? Are you so certain you’ll die you want to commit suicide now?” Zi Dong sneered.

He could not think of any other possibilities, even though he felt it was highly unlikely.

Yang Kai glanced over at him faintly before ignoring him altogether and simply lifting his foot once more to take another step forward!

“Haha!” Zi Dong’s laughter rang out as he felt there was no need for him to even take action to vent the anger in his heart.

But his laughter stopped just as abruptly as it began.

Right before his eyes, Yang Kai suddenly disappeared, as if he had never been there in the first place!

At that exact same moment, a strange and mysterious force seemed to emanate from Yang Kai and shroud his body in obscurity.

“Where did he go?” Zi Dong was stunned, but in the next moment, he caught sight of a figure abruptly appearing nearby out of the corner of his eye.

Zi Dong could not help exclaiming in surprise.

The figure that appeared suddenly was none other than Yang Kai who had just disappeared a moment ago, but now, he had actually arrived at another safe zone, and this safe zone happened to be the one where the five Enlightenment Flowers were growing!

At the base of the small hill, where the five Enlightenment Flowers grew, there was a large Void Crack that prevented the Seven Coloured Radiant Light from washing away.

When Yang Kai reappeared, he was standing beside the Enlightenment Flowers.

Zi Dong stared at him in a daze before glancing back to the spot where Yang Kai had once stood, unable to figure out what kind of shocking Secret Technique he had used to leap over space and instantly appear a thousand metres away.

Beside him, Zi Long’s eyes shrank as a profound light flashed across their depths, as if he had just witnessed something terrifying.

“Space Force!” Xu Wei exclaimed as he pointed at Yang Kai, calling out in alarm, “Kid, you’re proficient in Space Force? How is that possible?!”

Xu Wei looked like he had just seen a ghost. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Space Force?” Zi Dong was taken aback for a moment but soon realized what Xu Wei was talking about.

In that instant, his eyes filled with incredible envy as he stared at Yang Kai.

The Dao of Space was extremely esoteric, difficult to comprehend and even harder to master. In the entire Star Field, there were trillions upon trillions of cultivators, but how many of them could use Space Force? The number was certainly less than a thousand.

And among these thousand people, how many could use Space Force proficiently?

Zi Dong did not know, but he was certain there were fewer such people than there were Origin King Grade Alchemists.

Purple Star also had few masters who cultivated the Dao of Space, but none of them could achieve what Yang Kai had just displayed, crossing a thousand metres instantaneously. This was a true instant movement, not an illusion created by incredible speed.

The few cultivators in Purple Star who comprehended the Dao of Space only knew how to patch Space Arrays and could not use their Space Force to do anything else.

Even so, their status in Purple Star was extremely high, each of them receiving treatment better than the average Foreign Elder.

Those few people were regarded as treasures by Purple Star!

But compared to this unknown young man, those people were nothing but trash!

If Yang Kai’s accomplishments in Space Force were at a level of a master, then those people who belonged to Purple Star were just apprentices who had barely entered the Martial Dao. Even with Zi Dong’s inexperienced eyes, he could see that the two were completely incomparable.

What kind of opportunity did this little brat have that allowed him to cultivate the Dao of Space and reach such astonishing achievements in it? Zi Dong’s eyes nearly burned with jealousy as he glared towards Yang Kai, his heart extremely disturbed.

He was the Young Master of Purple Star, an honoured and lofty position, so why was he unable to comprehend the Dao of Space?

If he could master this power, it would absolutely make him stronger than he was now!

Zi Dong clenched his fists, his eyes filled with unwillingness.

“So, that’s how it is!” Zi Long took a deep breath and spoke, the confident expression on his face being replaced with an extremely solemn one, “It turns out that this is what you were relying on. No wonder you dared to speak so wildly before.”

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and did not deny the charge.

Him being proficient in the Dao of Space was not known to many people, and he had taken great pains to hide this fact, but Yang Kai had no choice but to expose his cards when facing the attraction of these five Enlightenment Flowers.

Enlightenment Flowers were extremely rare, especially ones that were lavender like the ones in front of him. The medicinal ages of these five flowers were extremely high, and if Yang Kai missed them this time, he would find it difficult to ever find similar ones in the future.

As such, Yang Kai made his choice.

“Young man, your name is Yang Kai, right?” Zi Long’s temperament was undoubtedly better than his sons, and after learning that Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he quickly composed himself despite his shock and asked.

Although he had not paid much attention to Yang Kai before, he has vaguely recalled hearing Xue Yue call Yang Kai’s name before, so he had taken note of it at the time.

“What about it?” Yang Kai looked at Zi Long flatly.

Zi Long chuckled, not angered by Yang Kai’s attitude and instead saying in a pleasant tone, “This King attacking you before, was this King’s mistake!”

He wore a sincere look when he spoke.

“Father...” Zi Dong gawked at Zi Long in astonishment, his face filled with shock.
