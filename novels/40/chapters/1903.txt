A hundred Origin King Grade pills a year left everyone in a complete shock.

No one could reject such a generous condition. Many Alchemists belonging to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce furtively winked at Ai Ou, signalling him to agree quickly without hesitation.

They urged Ai Ou like this because of two reasons: On the one hand, they were considering the Chamber of Commerce, on the other hand, they were urging Ai Ou for their own sake.

As long as this marriage went through, Grandmaster Zuo De would definitely remain in Water Sky City. They would then have the chance to communicate with Grandmaster Zuo De and ask for advice.

But Ai Ou didn’t go along with their wishes.

“Does President Ai Ou think that this old man’s sincerity is lacking?” Zuo De immediately looked sullen. He had already given such generous conditions but he still didn’t get a positive response from Ai Ou. He was surprised by this but even more so he was angered. “Or does President Ai Ou feel like that this old man’s granddaughter isn’t worthy of Third Young Master?”

Ai Ou’s forehead couldn’t help but be drenched in a cold sweat. He hurriedly waved his hands and justified himself, “It’s not like that. Xue Yue would really be blessed to have someone like Ling’er as his wife. How could she not be worthy?”

“If that’s the case, then why is Sir President hesitating?” Zhang Yuan asked, gazing straight at Ai Ou. “Third Young Master is talented and Miss Ling’er is drop-dead gorgeous. The two are a perfect match. They are a match made in heaven!”

Ai Ou glanced calmly at Zhan Yuan. He could not wait to slap him to death.

[Why didn’t I find this guy so annoying before? Why is he looking so displeasing today?]

“Grandmaster Zhan is right...” Ai Ou might find Zhan Yuan repulsive but for the fear of offending Zuo De, he had no choice but to address Zhan Yuan as Grandmaster unlike before when he used to call him by his name directly. “But...”

“But what?” Zuo De’s voice turned extremely cold. There was a sense of aggression in his voice. Obviously, he was in a very bad mood.

“But...”

“Grandmaster, please forgive me! Actually, the problem lies in with Xue Yue.” Xue Yue, seeing his father in a predicament, took the initiative and stepped up, cupped her fists, and explained, “Xue Yue’s heart already belongs to someone. I have long agreed to stay with the other party together forever, never to part with each other. Please forgive me, Grandmaster!”

Zuo Ling shook, as if she was about to fall upon hearing this. Looking at Xue Yue, her pretty face turned pale and her eyes turned red; she was about to break into tears.

Xue Yue turned and looked straight at Zuo Ling before trying to explain herself, “Sister Ling’er, we have known each other since we were young. We might not have spent a lot of time with each other but I have always regarded you as my younger sister. I never had any other thoughts about you. I only liked you as a sister... please forgive Xue Yue, I can’t accept your feelings!”

Zuo Ling was already feeling extremely aggrieved. And now, she immediately broke into tears. The sight of her crying was like a pear flower in a storm. Everyone’s heart cried out for her!

Many people couldn’t beat the sight of her crying.

Zuo De’s face had turned so cold that one could shave off a layer of frost off from his face.

“I don’t care, I don’t care!” Zuo Ling suddenly grabbed Zuo De’s arm and started shaking and shouting, “I just want to be with Brother Xue Yue. Grandpa, you have to think of something. Grandpa, aren’t you omnipotent, quickly think of some way. If I can’t marry Brother Xue Yue, Ling’er... Ling’er will die!”

Everyone’s face immediately turned black.

Having seen Zuo Ling raising such a fuss, everyone immediately understood that it was because she was totally spoiled by Zuo De. Otherwise, how could a girl act so wildly in public?

Zuo De appeared distressed and helpless. He patted the back of Zuo Ling’s hand and consoled her, “Stop crying first. Isn’t Grandpa still discussing with President Ai Ou? If you cry again, Grandpa will leave immediately. I will never come to Water Sky City in the future, and you can forget meeting the Third Young Master for your entire life!”

This trick worked immediately; Zuo Ling immediately stopped crying, but this couldn’t stop her from sobbing and choking. Her delicate shoulders kept trembling. She looked at Xue Yue with a grieving look on her face.

Xue Yue was feeling completely helpless. She put Zuo Ling’s glance aside. She knew that her hesitation and indecision would invariably lead to trouble. It wasn’t the time to act soft!

Meanwhile, Ai Ou was also disheartened. With his shrewdness, how could he not notice what Zuo De meant to say? It might look like Zue De was comforting Zuo Lin, but he was actually threatening Ai Ou.

His intent was very obvious. If Ai Ou couldn’t satisfy his granddaughter, he will immediately leave Water Sky City and will never set foot here in his life! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In other words, the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce would lose their only Origin king Grade Alchemist! Not only would it be a big blow to the actual interest of the entire Chamber of Commerce but also a big blow to their reputation.

If it really happened, would their Chamber of Commerce still be able to hire another Origin King Grade Alchemist or an Artifact Refiner in the future?

The answer was obviously no, unless they could train their very own Origin King Grade Alchemist and Artifact Refiner. But how could it be that easy? The birth of Origin King Grade Alchemist and Artifact Refiner was even harder than raising a cultivator to the Third-Order Origin King Realm.

Otherwise, peak-level Alchemists and Artifact Refiners would not be so rare in this world. And Ai Ou would not have to swallow all the insult and still accompany Zuo De with a smile even after having been embarrassed by Zuo De to this extent.

Suddenly, Ai Ou felt that this day was the most vexing day of his life.

“President Ai Ou.” Zuo De calmed his tone and said, “As you can see, this girl is hell-bent on having her own way, this old man really has no choice. And since the Third Young Master’s heart already belongs to someone, this old man cannot force him against his will and separate the lovers. Otherwise, if the word got out, everyone would point their fingers at this old man. How about this old man give the Third Young Master and you a few days to think about it and give this old man a reply? This old man will be staying in Water Sky City for a few days. When you have thought it over, you can come and find this old man.”

He was sure that Ai Ou was desperate to have him refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill. That’s why he said this.

Sure enough, Ai Ou appeared to be in a big predicament. He wanted to ask Zuo De to refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill first, but he couldn’t open his mouth to ask. Because he knew that even if he brazenly asked Zuo De, Zuo De would surely come up with an excuse to decline.

Like he was in a bad mood or Zuo Ling would interfere...

He felt that it was better to keep quiet than to ask for nothing.

His gaze fell on Xue Yue. He could not help but consider whether to agree to Zuo De’s request first and deal with the aftermath once Gu Bi Hu is cured.

But when all was said and done, Xue Yue was a girl. If he really agreed, he would end up offending Zue De completely.

Ai Ou was having a huge headache. Nothing had put him in such a difficult position. He was in charge of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce and had been leading it vigorously and effectively. The entire Chamber of Commerce had been growing steadily under his command, but up against Zuo De’s proposal, he was at a loss.

“I have long heard of Grandmaster Zuo De’s reputation and come to admire you. But after seeing what transpired today, tch tch...”

Just when Ai Ou was cursing in his heart, a voice suddenly echoed in the hall.

Ai Ou couldn’t help but be shocked. He immediately turned and looked for the source of the voice. And after he saw who just spoke, he stood in a daze, dumbstruck and frowning.

Because he discovered that the speaker was none other than Yang Kai!

[Yang Kai and Xue Yue have a good relationship. Obviously, he spoke up just now because Xue Yue had stepped forward. But he had gone a bit overboard. This would definitely offend Zuo De.]

[However, he’s not a member of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. He doesn’t represent the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, so no matter how he offended Zuo De, it had nothing to do with the Chamber of Commerce.]

Having thought about it this way, Ai Ou suddenly realized that Yang Kai was the most appropriate person to talk about these things now. His eyes involuntarily lit up as he cast an emotional glance at Yang Kai.

Other people’s expressions immediately changed after hearing this. Yang Kai might not have finished his sentence, but the disdain in his words was pretty obvious to everyone.

[Isn’t he simply giving a tight slap right on his face by saying this in the face of an Origin King Grade Alchemist?] The expression in many Origin Grade Alchemist’s eyes changed when they looked at Yang Kai.

Zuo De still maintained some subtlety. He didn’t get angry immediately. Rather he narrowed his eyes when he looked at Yang Kai before asking calmly, “President Ai Ou, he is...”

“Reporting to Grandmaster, Yang Kai is my friend.” Before Ai Ou could reply, Xue Yue seized the initiative to answer.

“Is he a member of your Chamber of Commerce?” Zuo De started to furrow his brow.

“No! He happened to be passing by and came to visit me, that’s all,” Xue Yue explained.

Zuo De nodded his understanding and said with a smile hanging on his lips, “Your Excellency, this old man simply can’t ignore what you just said. Your Excellency seemed to be dissatisfied with this old man? Has this old man offended you before?”

From Zhan Yuan, Zuo De knew that Yang Kai had spoken ill of him behind his back. Actually, Yang Kai hadn’t badmouthed him but just had said that he was putting on airs a little. Zuo De had secretly put down Yang Kai’s name in his heart. He had secretly decided that he would not refine any Origin King Grade pill for Yang Kai in the future. But he couldn’t make trouble for Yang Kai just because of this. He could only give it up on that matter. But Yang Kai stood up and badmouthed him again. And naturally, he couldn’t laugh it off now.

[So what if you are a Second-Order Origin King cultivator? You will have no choice but to beg this old man when you are in a need!] Zuo De felt proud when he thought of this.

“Grandmaster must be joking, this is the first time this Yang has met Grandmaster, so how could you have offended me?” Yang Kai calmly said.

“In that case, why are you...”

“To be honest, what’s the problem?” Yang Kai smiled comfortably.

Zuo De’s face immediately sank. Just as he was about to say something, Yang Kai continued, “Alchemists are like doctors and healers. It’s a noble profession that attaches equal attention to both skill and humanity, both of which are indispensable. Mrs. Gu’s soul has been injured for a year already, her life has been hanging by a thread. But Grandmaster didn’t even immediately refine the Soul Source Restoration Pill to save the patient as soon as possible after arriving here! Instead, you are using her condition to force President Ai Ou and Third Young Master to marry your granddaughter. It’s rather apparent that Grandmaster is skilled but you are lacking humanity... is Grandmaster really worthy of the word ‘Grandmaster’? Don’t you find this word a little heavy to bear? Grandmaster is old, I hope you don’t get crushed by its weight.”

As soon as Yang Kai said this, not only did the expressions of many Origin grade Alchemists worsen but even the expression on President Ai Ou’s face grew even more complicated.

He had never even expected Yang Kai’s words to be so sharp and direct, they almost tore the skin off Zuo De’s face.

Yang Kai might have spoken what was going in Ai Ou’s mind but speaking so directly in front of Zuo De was equal to completely offending him. Even though it was the truth and everyone knew it, he should not have said it so directly.

There were some things that everyone could only keep in their hearts.

“You...” Zuo De’s face turned blue and red. He was unable to find a way to get out of this embarrassing situation. No one had dared to say this in front of him. Even an Origin King Realm cultivator would act respectfully in front of him. When had anyone made such sharp accusations?

When Yang Kai said so, he indeed felt something weighing down on his shoulders.
