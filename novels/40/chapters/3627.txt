Chapter 3626: Several Blossomed Flowers

Ten breaths later, Hua Qing Si and Bian Yu Qing were still waiting patiently.

Half a cup of tea’s time later, the ladies were still waiting at the same spot.

One hour later, just when Bian Yu Qing’s patience was running out, a person was seen coming over rapidly. When the person came near and revealed his face, the ladies realised that he was none other than Yao Si.

Seeing that he really returned, Bian Yu Qing was finally able to set her mind at ease. At the same time, she shot an admiring look at Hua Qing Si.

With his hands behind his back, Yao Si let his clothes sway with the wind. Suppressing his fury and frustration, he tried his hardest to say in a calm voice, “I’ll take on the position as Adjutant. Tell him that I’ll come to High Heaven Palace and assume my post in three days!”

“Adjutant Yao, with you in charge, I’m sure the Sixty-First Army will grow to be a formidable force that the Demons will tremble in fear of,” Hua Qing Si put on a smile and saluted him in an elegant manner. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph!” With his fury burning him from the inside out, Yao Si turned around and flew away. This time, he really left.

After he was out of sight, Hua Qing Si patted her own plump bosom and let out a long breath. Over the past hour, she had more than once thought that she had misjudged the situation. Fortunately, Yao Si didn’t go back on his word.

“Sister Hua, were you sure he would come back?” Bian Yu Qing asked.

Hua Qing Si forced a smile, “I wasn’t. However, I think that even if he doesn’t care about his own reputation, he can’t possibly embarrass the Serene Soul Palace and Serene Soul Great Emperor. He has to take his Sect and the Great Emperor into consideration.”

She hadn’t come into contact with Yao Si much, but judging from what she had seen of his behaviour today, it was apparent that he wasn’t a pedantic person who stuck strictly to the rules. He was probably someone who would do anything to obtain victory as long as his tactics were not immoral. It wouldn’t be surprising if someone like him would go back on his word; however, just like what Hua Qing Si had said, even if Yao Si didn’t care about his own reputation, he had to protect the reputation of the Great Emperor and Serene Soul Palace, which was why he had to come back.

Before the Sixty-First Army was even built, they had recruited a powerful Adjutant who came from a noble background. Even if Yao Si wasn’t capable of management, he would still be able to increase the overall power of the army, which was a good thing.

“Three days…” Hua Qing Si turned to look at High Heaven Palace as though she was able to see through the seal of the array and glimpse what was going on in the palace. With her face reddening, she said hesitantly, “I’m not even sure if that will be enough time…”

“What do you mean there isn’t enough time?” Bian Yu Qing was puzzled.

Hua Qing Si’s face turned scarlet as she replied in a small voice, “Second Manager, haven’t you heard of the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder? Palace Master left for several years, and just now, he…”

Bian Yu Qing finally understood what Hua Qing Si was talking about as she turned to look at High Heaven Palace and giggled with her mouth covered.

With a solemn expression, Hua Qing Si decided to stop talking about this topic, and then she said, “Whatever the case, we have to get started quickly. The Sixty-First Army has just been founded, and Palace Master has become the Army Commander. All of us from High Heaven Palace must give him our utmost support. We’ll start with organizing the twenty thousand disciples from the Sect. As for recruiting others outside the Sect, there’s no rush. Second Manager, will you please go over to the Branch in the Southern Territory and enlist those who are in the Origin King Realm and above? I’ll handle those in the main Sect. We have to get everything ready in three days.”

“Good,” Bian Yu Qing replied in agreement. Both of them had worked together for many years, so they could tacitly understand one another. After they divided up the work, they parted ways to carry out their own tasks.

In the past, the Great Emperors had ordered them to seal off High Heaven Palace. Besides the main Sect in the Northern Territory, their Branch in the Southern Territory had also been sealed off. At this moment, those in the Southern Territory were still not aware that the Great Emperors had lifted the sanctions against Yang Kai and the Sect. When Bian Yu Qing went over and told them about it, everyone in the Southern Territory Branch was over the moon.

Upon hearing that the Sixty-First Army had been established, and Yang Kai would be the Army Commander, all the disciples who were in the Origin King Realm and above applied to join the army.

Ninety-nine percent of the disciples of High Heaven Palace were brought over by Yang Kai from Heng Luo Star Field, with the largest number being from High Heaven Sect on Shadowed Star. There were also those who had been selected from different Cultivation Stars in Heng Luo Star Field. Regardless, all of them were cultivators with excellent aptitudes.

It had been quite some time since these people arrived at the Star Boundary, so all of them saw significant increases in their cultivations. Presently, there were thirty thousand to forty thousand Origin Kings. Many Dao Source Realm Masters had recently emerged as well. There were only a small number of Emperor Realm Masters, but it was enough to build the frame of the army. As long as the frame was prepared, they would have an easy time recruiting more people.

While those from both the main and Branch Sect were swamped with work, the atmosphere on High Heaven Peak was amorous, to say the least.

The room was filled with a sense of decadence as clothes had been scattered everywhere on the floor. On a giant bed, a few naked figures were entangled with one another as the sound of slapping flesh and sultry moans could continuously be heard.

Xia Ning Chang’s veil had long ago been tossed aside, revealing her breathtakingly beautiful face. While Su Yan’s hair flapped in the air, Shan Qing Luo lay nearby drenched in sweat. Xue Yue had already fallen apart as she leaned against the bed and panted heavily, her body was twitching uncontrollably.

On the bed, only Zhu Qing was still trying her hardest to persevere. As two people became one, she could be heard moaning incessantly.

Unlike the other ladies, it was the first time Zhu Qing had shared her Husband with so many women around. Initially, she wasn’t willing to join them as it was too embarrassing for her, but after she dawdled for some time, Shan Qing Luo directly tore her clothes apart as Yang Kai caught her with his evil claws. In an instant, her determination not to join disintegrated.

The first time she encountered Yang Kai, Zhu Qing had fallen prey to his draconic nature. While she was in a dazed state, Yang Kai took advantage of her wantonly. After so many years, and growing so much closer, now that she was in this kind of situation, there was no way she could resist the temptation.

In the end, she could only give in to Yang Kai. She and her Sisters had all entered the battle together, but Zhu Qing was the only one who had persevered until now; after all, she was a member of the Dragon Clan, so Su Yan and the others were not comparable to her in terms of physical strength.

Most of them had already collapsed from exhaustion on the bed, while a charming Shan Qing Luo gently clenched her teeth and muttered to Su Yan in a small voice, “Damn it. Why is this woman still so energetic?”

Su Yan didn’t even have the strength to move a finger, so she was unable to reply to her. Nevertheless, she still made the effort to shake her head slowly.

Shan Qing Luo hoisted herself and knelt on the bed before crawling toward those two who were deeply immersed in the moment. Her hair hung loose on her waist and backside, and the arch of her back as she crawled forward was the epitome of seduction.

While engaging in an intense congress, Yang Kai noticed the approaching panther and stared at Shan Qing Luo with widened eyes. Noticing his stare, Shan Qing Luo lifted her head and flashed an alluring smile at him. Then, she slid up behind Zhu Qing and wrapped her arms around the latter’s body. Following that, her slender and jade-like fingers began wandering across Zhu Qing’s bountiful figure.

Zhu Qing shuddered as though she had been terrified. She turned around with difficulty, only to see Shan Qing Luo flashing a wicked smile at her. Upon licking her red lips, Shan Qing Luo lowered herself and began kissing Zhu Qing’s chest and stomach.

Seeing that, Zhu Qing was horrified. Usually, she was overbearing in front of Shan Qing Luo, but at this moment, she seemed to be pleading with the latter.

Certainly, Shan Qing Luo wouldn’t let her off. She had always been displeased with this female Dragon and had suffered several setbacks when dealing with her in the past. Unfortunately, she wasn’t as powerful as Zhu Qing, so she was unable to fight back. Hence, this was the perfect opportunity for her to get her revenge.

All of a sudden, the pitch of Zhu Qing’s moans increased noticeably. She might have been mistaken as wailing, but that wasn’t the case.

At that instant, the aura of decadence in the room thickened.

To the side, Xia Ning Chang, who was about to nod off, widened her eyes suddenly, dumbfounded by what she was witnessing. Su Yan quickly covered her eyes with one hand.

The group of six carried out their conjugal rituals several times more, completely losing track of the time, as if this room had become a separate, sealed world.

A long time later, Yang Kai awakened from his dream. Given his cultivation, he didn’t need to sleep at all unless he was severely injured; however, after he came home, being surrounded by all his Wives, he couldn’t help pouring every last bit of his love and energy into them. With his mind at ease, he unknowingly fell asleep.

At this moment, Xia Ning Chang was napping in his left arm while Su Yan occupied his right. Shan Qing Luo directly rested on his body as he caught a whiff of the fragrance wafting from her hair. He could feel two heads resting on his thighs as well, and without the need to take a look, he knew that they were Xue Yue and Zhu Qing. However, he wasn’t sure who was on his left and who was on his right.

Shan Qing Luo’s eyelashes fluttered as she slowly opened her eyes, only to meet Yang Kai’s bright gaze. With a faint smile, the Beguiling Demon Queen asked, “You’re awake?”

Yang Kai nodded.

“Are you satisfied?”

He shook his head. He could never get enough when it came to such activities. For all his life, he would never get sick of seeing their beautiful faces and bodies.

Shan Qing Luo burst into laughter, “All of us can’t take anymore.”

Upon finishing her words, she lowered herself and landed a peck on his lips. With her hands pressing against the man’s chest, she supported herself up. For some reason, she could be seen scowling, as though she was in pain.

Seeing that, Yang Kai grinned and laughed in silence while Shan Qing Luo shot him a glare.

After she sat up with difficulty, she knelt on the bed and took a look at the other ladies as she sighed, “Stop pretending. It isn’t the first time we’ve all done this together. Wake up.”

None of them was an ordinary woman, so although Shan Qing Luo’s movements and voice were light just now, it wasn’t possible that the others weren’t alerted. However, at this moment, they all kept ‘sleeping’ soundly, none of them opening their eyes.

Unlike the others, Shan Qing Luo didn’t find what they just did embarrassing in the slightest, but the rest couldn’t help feeling awkward after they regained their senses. This was not the first time this happened, so she was already used to it. In fact, things were getting better as all of the Sisters became familiar with each other, so she stopped minding it at all. The crux of the problem was that Zhu Qing was around this time.

Seeing as the other ladies did not respond to her, Shan Qing Luo sneered and lifted her hand before spanking Xia Ning Chang’s firm backside, causing a wave of ripples on her flesh, “Ning Chang, if you don’t get up, our Husband won’t be able to hold it in anymore. Will you be able to take responsibility?”

Xia Ning Chang immediately opened her eyes, not because she was shocked by what Shan Qing Luo had said, but because Yang Kai’s hands had indeed started wandering around her body.

When their eyes met, she flashed an apologetic smile at Yang Kai and landed a kiss on his cheek. Then, she struggled out of his embrace and crawled towards the edge of the bed.

“Big Sister, Xue Yue, and you too…” Shan Qing Luo called out to them one by one.

After all of them heard their names, they got up with reddened faces. A moment later, the sounds of putting on clothes were heard in the room.

The sight before Yang Kai’s was pleasing to the eyes. Lying on the bed, he looked smilingly at every one of them as he felt extremely happy in his heart.

After putting on their clothes, the ladies helped each other comb their hair and tidy their appearances. When they were finally presentable again, they turned around, only to see Yang Kai still nonchalantly lying on the bed.

Su Yan sighed helplessly, “Help him up.”

The ladies separated into two rows and served Yang Kai by cleaning and dressing him.
