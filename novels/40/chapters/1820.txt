But no matter how remorseful they were feeling, it was of no help. Many loyal disciples of Shrouded Heaven Mansion, who were maintaining the Array, immediately stood up, glaring at the young man’s direction in anger.

“Who allowed you to stand up? Sit down and do what you were ordered!” The young man let out a cold snort as an overwhelming pressure emerged from him, bearing down on the cultivators who stood up. In the next moment, all the standing cultivators groaned in pain and fell on their asses.

None of these cultivators had reached the Saint Realm. How could they bear the pressure from the Saint King!?

The young man, making another cold snort, refocused his attention on the girl before him and started speaking, “It’s your honour that this Young Master has come to like you. It’s your honour to serve this Young Master tonight! If you don’t show me your face, believe it or not, I will tear your clothes right here and now!”

The girl immediately shuddered. Her eyes were filled with horror.

[If I’m really insulted by this bastard before all these members of my sect, is there a point in living after that?]

The girl felt extremely sad and indignant just as this thought crossed her mind. She couldn’t help but immediately think of committing suicide immediately.

She would rather die in glory than live in dishonour...

“If you dare to commit suicide, I will kill all thousand members of Shrouded Heaven Mansion one by one! This damned world might have meagre World Energy but there are untold cultivators. You think that this Young Master would not be able to maintain this Spirit Array without your Shrouded Heaven Mansion?” The young man gazed coldly at the girl.

“Asshole!” The girl nibbled her lips and cursed. She didn’t dare to act rashly when the other party had threatened her like this.

“Haha!” The young man started laughing frantically. “Continue, continue, this Young Master likes watching the angry look on girls like you. The angrier you react, the happier this Young Master is!”

“You perverted bastard, someone will deal with you someday.”

“Hmph! I’m afraid the likes of you will never be able to do that.”

The girl coldly harrumphed and said, “We indeed could never do it but there is someone.”

Judging by the current look on her face, it seemed as if she recalled someone, a sliver of pride appeared on her timid and angry face.

“Is that so!?” The young man looked at the girl with interest. “Tell me, who in this damned place could clean up this Young Master? This Young Master is really looking forward to it.”

He had already explored the entire Tong Xuan Realm. This world had very thin World Energy. The level of cultivators here was generally low. Or else, it would have been impossible for them to act so wantonly in this world. It should be brought to notice that what they were doing was a perverse act; they were extracting the World Energy of an entire Cultivation Star.

If they were found, the entire Star Field might pursue them.

“The Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land!” The girl replied, gritting her teeth. Her eyes immediately grew brighter. “Someday, he will come back and make you pay for everything!”

“Nine Heavens Holy Land!?” The young man furrowed his brow before asking a man in black standing next to him, “Is there such a sect here?”

The man in black pondered for a moment and answered, “There seems to be a sect of this name but the entire has gone somewhere. According to the people here, they have gone to the Star Field.”

The young man slightly nodded his acknowledgement. “It’s just going to the Star Field. I have to give it to this Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land, he actually left this place. But... so what!? Does he think that the Star Field is that easy!? They might have already been annihilated in some unknown place in the Star Field!?”

“The Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land is very amazing. Back then, he had unified all three clans, Human, Monsters, and Demons. How can someone like you guesstimate him?” The girl looked at the young man contemptuously.

“You seem to admire this Lord of Nine Heavens Land!?” The young man, tilting his head and looking at the girl, smiled and continued, “Now, I really want to see whether this Lord of Nine Heavens Hold Land will come to your rescue when I insult you or not...”

Just as he finished speaking, the young man suddenly stretched his hand out.

Immediately, a burst of energy struck the girl, tearing the outer baggy clothes hiding her figure.

The girl let out a shriek and backed away, again and again.

A perverted gleam appeared in the young man’s eyes as he stared straight at the girl. Although there were still some clothes remaining underneath her baggy clothes, they were unable to hide the shapely figure of the girl. Her voluptuous twin peaks were like a pair of towering mountains, almost trying to rip out of her clothes. The young man immediately grew lusty at the sight of this. He licked his lips and said, “Just like I thought, your figure is top grade. It seems this Young Master’s vision wasn’t wrong.”

“What do you want to do?” The girl was immediately struck with panic. She stared at the young man in vigilance.

The young man sneered in response. “Since you admire this Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land so much, this Young Master would like to give both of you a chance, for the knight in shining armour to arrive and rescue the damsel in distress!”

One of the men in black robes standing nearby broke into laughter and started mocking, “A frog in the well knows nothing of the ocean. I’m afraid this little girl doesn’t know how great Young Master is. She thinks that the Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land is first under heaven. She just doesn’t know that someone like him isn’t even qualified to lift Young Master’s shoes!”

“That’s right!” Someone immediately agreed.

The young man immediately smiled with a very happy look on his face.

But right then, the young man furrowed his brow and looked up at the sky. In the next moment, he immediately stood up, staring towards the sky.

In the sky, a meteor-like streak of light was coming down as quickly as an arrow fired from a bow and immediately crashed on the Hexagonal Array.

BOOM... The ground quaked violently while the Hexagonal Array was instantly destroyed. All the cultivators maintaining the Array were pushed back by a powerful force, sending them flying.

In a flash, everyone was thrown off their feet; everything was in chaos.

“Young Master, be careful!” The expression of the two Origin Returning Realm masters’ among the men in black robes immediately changed. They promptly gathered before the young man, staring forward warily. They immediately probed with their Divine Sense, trying to find out the strength of the attacker.

But much to their horror and dismay, their Divine Sense didn’t sense anything as if no one was there.

The faces of the two Origin Returning Realm masters feel upon this discovery. They were hit with a bad feeling.

“Who is it?” The young man shouted in anger.

It had taken a lot of effort to set up the Hexagonal Array. It had never occurred to him that the Array would be destroyed by someone just as he was about to refine it successfully. The young man immediately blew his top.

“Heh heh...” Weird laughter rang from the centre of the Array, giving the young man the chills. He asked with a scowl, “Sneaky thief, since you are already here, why don’t you give me your name!?”

“Don’t you already know!? Why are you still asking!?”

“What do I know?” The young man furrowed his brow.

“Didn’t you just say that you will allow me to be the knight in shining armour and rescue the damsel in distress? I’ve just taken that chance...”

“Knight in shining armour to rescue the damsel in distress!?” The young man was startled and mouth agape. He clarified with a weird look on his face, “Are you trying to say that you are that Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land!?”

“Ah!?” Even the captured girl was dumbstruck. Her eyes widened as she turned her gaze towards the centre of the Array.

As the dust slowly settled, a figure standing there calmly entered everyone’s vision. It was looking around with a mocking smile hanging on his lips. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The girl’s heart pounded hard as a look of ecstasy suddenly appeared on her face.

“It’s...really him!”

The young girl hadn’t seen Yang Kai, but after the masters of three races, Humans, Monsters, and Demons joined hands to resist the revived Bone Race, the much renowned Nine Heavens Holy Land rose to fame. And as the Lord of Nine Heavens Holy Land, Yang Kai also became famous.

Yang Kai was young and promising. He was even rumoured to be hot and handsome. Many unmarried girls considered Yang Kai as the man of their dreams. They would have Yang Kai’s portrait hanging in their boudoir; not a night went by that they hadn’t dreamed of him.

It could be said that Yang Kai’s portrait was everywhere in Tong Xuan Realm.

She was the daughter of Shrouded Heaven Mansion Palace Master. Many female disciples of the Shrouded Heaven Mansion idolized Yang Kai. So naturally, she had also seen Yang Kai’s portrait.

Now, the real one had appeared before her, bearing striking resemblance with the portrait. She recognized him immediately. A strange gleam immediately flickered in her beautiful eyes.

“This Spirit Array is... a little overbearing.” As Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept through the Hexagonal Array, he furrowed his brow as a cold look took over his face. “Elder, what do you think?”

He seemed to be talking to the air but the next moment, a figure shrouded in black Qi emerged by his side.

This figure appeared out of nowhere, startling the young man. He immediately sized up Gui Zu, somewhat perplexed. The two Origin Returning Realm masters guarding the young man shivered even more so. Their faces immediately turned pale.

“It’s not just overbearing, it’s even more sinister than this Old Man’s Cultivation Art! Hmph, these people are trying to extract your home’s World Energy and refine it here.” Gui Zu reached out and took the hexagonal crystal from the centre of the Array.

“The World Energy in it is very abundant. If it’s used to cultivate, it will definitely be beneficial. Tsk tsk, it can be absorbed directly, so there is no need to refine and convert it. What a treasure!” Gui Zui said as he threw the hexagonal crystal to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned as he grabbed the crystal and felt it a bit. He then nodded and agreed, “Indeed, it can be absorbed directly.”

He silently felt the energy stored in the crystal. He felt that ten of these crystals would be enough to allow a Saint King Realm cultivator to advance by a Minor Realm.

Yang Kai found this discovery a bit inconceivable.

Every cultivator had to go through thistles and thorns just to cultivate. Every step was difficult. But this hexagonal crystal pointed to a sure-fire shortcut to the cultivator.

As long as there were enough crystals, a cultivator could advance at an astonishing speed. Of course, the premise was that his understanding of the Martial Dao could keep up with it.

“How dare you destroy my Spirit Devouring Array and take my Spirit Devouring Crystal!?” The distant young man flew into a rage and immediately shouted.

But just as he spoke this, an Origin Returning Realm master quickly and deftly covered his mouth.

The young man grew even more furious. But just as he was about to scold, that Origin Returning Realm master whispered in a cold sweat, “Young Master, these two are unfathomable. Please, don’t offend them!”

“Unfathomable!?” The young man was startled. He immediately realized the seriousness of this situation. He hadn’t been able to see through Yang Kai and Gui Zu but he didn’t give them too much attention. After all, he had two Origin Returning Realm masters beside him.

But now, when he took a look again, he noticed that the two Origin Returning Realm masters beside him had actually gone pale. He couldn’t help but wonder why Yang and Gui Zu couldn’t be messed with!?

And immediately, he broke into a cold sweat in shock.
