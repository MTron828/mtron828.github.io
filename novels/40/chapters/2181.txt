At this point, Pang Hai would never admit what Yang Kai said was true, otherwise, it would be equivalent to slapping his own face. In front of so many people, how could he just back down, so he instead doubled down and viciously shouted, “Boy, there should be a limit to how much nonsense you spew! This Pang is an Origin King Grade Alchemist, so if I say it is the Profound Frost Sacred Lotus, it is the Profound Frost Sacred Lotus!”

As soon as this statement came out, everyone else regained some confidence in Pang Hai; after all, they didn’t know Yang Kai so how could they judge whether his words were trustworthy or not.

Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, “I’m a Dao Source Grade Alchemist...”

He was telling the truth, but obviously, no one believed it.

“You see, this boy is just making up stories, you can’t believe him!” Pang Hai added insult to injury promptly.

Everyone nodded lightly.

“It’s fine!” Yang Kai suddenly stood up and patted his butt off, cracking his neck as he stretched his arms...

Everyone stared at him dumbfoundedly, wondering why it looked like he was suddenly preparing to fight.

“Enough idle chatter!” Yang Kai said while sweeping his eyes across the crowd, causing everyone he stared at to involuntarily shiver, as if they were being stared at by some terrifying beast. “Since you’re all here, do me a favour...” He grinned and quickly said, “Hand over your Space Rings!”

“What?”

Everyone was startled, as if they couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

But soon, a few people became furious.

“Bastard, what did you just say!?”

“You think you are above the Heavens? A trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm trash dares try to rob us? Haha, too laughable...”

“This kid is definitely crazy!”

“Since you’ve made such a good joke, you hand over your Space Ring and we’ll spare your life!”

Everyone in the group was angered and hurled ridicule or threats... In any case, none of them cared about Yang Kai’s words as none of them believed he had the ability to back them up. All of them felt this boy had simply lost his mind and was acting far beyond his station.

Yang Kai smiled and turned to Zhou Huai indifferently before saying, “Just now, this friend was wondering why after so long no one else came to investigate this Heavenly Manifestation, right? I’ll answer your question now... it’s not that no one came here to investigate, but that I drove all of them off!”

“You?” Zhou Huai couldn’t help but sneer, “Isn’t that too much even for a joke?”

Yang Kai shook his head and replied, “There were a few people who were overconfident in their abilities and tried to expel me, but they all ended up like that...”

Saying so, he lightly pointed towards a certain nearby spot. When Jing Li’s group turned their eyes in the direction Yang Kai pointed, they saw a headless corpse lying amidst the mountain rocks, fresh blood still wetting the group. Nearby, there was also a corpse of a woman that seemed to have fallen from a high altitude and broken to pieces.

“Those two... they’re from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect!” Jing Li observed for a moment before exclaiming suddenly.

“Yeah, they said they belonged to the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect,” Yang Kai nodded.

“You actually killed them?” Jing Li looked at Yang Kai in shock, “You were able to kill them?”

“No wonder there was a faint smell of blood in the air...” Zhou Huai frowned, “The smell was simply covered by this strange fragrance. Damn it, I almost didn’t notice!”

“Even if you killed these two people, so what?” Pang Hai suddenly pointed at Yang Kai coldly and declared solemnly, “Those two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect weren’t very strong, and there were only two of them. Do you think you can do to us five what you did to them?”

When this statement came out, everyone came back to their senses and nodded, thinking that their opponent was a lone First-Order Dao Source Realm boy. Even if he had some strange methods, in the end, two fists could not block four palms.

“Haa...” Yang Kai sighed, “If possible, I didn’t want to get rough, I just wanted to find a few herbs! But if you don’t want to cooperate, then...”

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly flickered and he vanished from where he stood.

In that instant, the expressions of the five people changed drastically as they hurriedly released their Divine Senses trying to locate Yang Kai.

But despite spreading out their Divine Senses, none of them were able to discover any trace of Yang Kai, as if he had simply disappeared from existence.

This strange situation made all five of them pale as anxiety surged up deep in their hearts.

Suddenly, a hand lightly landed on Jing Li’s shoulder while at the same time, Yang Kai’s figure appeared strangely behind him and spoke calmly, “I should warn you now, don’t try to resist, otherwise I may accidentally kill you...”

Jing Li felt like he was struck by lightning and cold sweat instantly began to drip down his back as he stood stiffly on the spot, not daring to move.

He could feel that the hand resting on his shoulders contained an imposing and overbearing power that was constantly threatening to swallow him whole like a vast, raging ocean. It was a force he felt utterly powerless to resist.

*Xiu xiu xiu...*

The other four people instantly scattered as they took distance from Jing Li, pushing their Source Qi madly as they stared at Yang Kai vigilantly and solemnly.

Before Yang Kai spoke, none of them even realized he had arrived behind Jing Li, so they couldn’t help asking themselves if it had been them in Jing Li’s place, could they have avoided being caught? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The answer was obviously no!

Thinking so, everyone broke out into a cold sweat...

“This friend...” Jing Li gulped as big drops of sweat slipped from his forehead and he spoke with difficulty, “There is no grievance or enmity between you and I, and this Jing has not treated you...”

“Relax,” Yang Kai interrupted him before he was finished and said, “I’m not going to take your life. Although it would be easy for me to do so, since there are no grievances between us as you say, I have no reason to kill!”

“Yes, yes!” Jing Li nodded repeatedly, squeezing out an ugly smile as he said, “What friend says is absolutely right.”

“En, like I said a moment ago, I’m simply searching for a few herbs!” Yang Kai reached out to grab Jing Li’s Space Ring as he spoke.

Effortlessly taking down his frozen opponent’s Space Ring, Yang Kai swept it with his Divine Sense quickly before frowning and handing it back to Jing Li.

“You can go now!” Yang Kai patted Jing Li’s shoulder with a smile and said.

Jing Li almost collapsed when he felt the hand leave his shoulder, but somehow, he managed to maintain his composure and stay on his feet. Holding down his fear, he swept his Space Ring with his Divine Sense and in the next moment let out a slight cry of surprise as he turned a strange look towards Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned and said, “You don’t have what I want in your ring...”

“So that’s how it is!” Jing Li suddenly realized, cupped his fists ecstatically, and shouted, “Many thanks!”

Saying so, he hurriedly used his Movement Skill to escape into the distance.

Although he had received a fright, he was unharmed and had not lost anything, which was a result he could only have dreamed of a moment ago, so how could Jing Li dare be dissatisfied? Naturally, it was better to let bygones be bygones than try to seek revenge.

“Next!” Yang Kai looked at the remaining four people and grinned, “Don’t force me to act myself! You can all rest assured that if you don’t have what I need, I won’t take anything from you. If you do... well, you can only blame your bad luck.”

The other four looked at each other, their faces turning different shades of blue and red, but they didn’t dare to leave without permission.

Judging from the strange Movement Skill that Yang Kai just displayed, none of them had confidence they could escape. Likely, they would instantly be caught and subdued if they tried to run.

“This friend, what are you looking for? Please just speak and if this Zhou has it, he will certainly offer it to you!” Zhou Huai thought for a while before speaking.

The others also nodded fiercely and said, “Yes, if we have what this friend wants, we will hand it over willingly!”

Although from Jing Li’s reaction just now, Yang Kai really didn’t seem to have taken anything from his Space Ring, everyone had their own secrets which they kept in their Space Rings...

No one wanted to hang over their Space Ring for others to inspect!

“Don’t trouble yourselves, I’ll check for myself!” Yang Kai coldly snorted, “I’ll count to three. Those who don’t hand over their Space Ring will face the consequences!”

With clear murderous intent appearing on his face, Yang Kai really didn’t seem to be joking as he began counting.

“Haa...” Seeing this, Zhou Huai could only sigh as he gave up trying to avoid the inevitable. Reluctantly taking down his Space Ring from his hand, he tossed it over to Yang Kai with a wry smile and said, “I hope you keep your word!”

Yang Kai didn’t say a word, caught the Space Ring and checked it, a moment later tossing it back without taking anything.

Zhou Huai happily caught it and didn’t even bother to say anything before flying off.

Among the five people, the two strongest had already given in, so how could the remaining three have the courage to resist? After exchanging a few glances, they took down their Space Rings and handed them over to Yang Kai.

After some inspection, Yang Kai frowned.

Because he didn’t see anything he needed.

Whether it was the three remaining herbs he needed to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, or the Tribulation Fruit...

If he couldn’t obtain the necessary ingredients, he wouldn’t even be able to attempt to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill! If that was the case, he could only swallow the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus when it matured.

Doing this would greatly waste its medicinal efficacies, so Yang Kai was naturally unwilling and only thought of doing so as a last resort.

After expelling the remaining three people, Yang Kai continued to sit cross-legged and wait for his next victim.

He had secretly decided that before any real Masters arrived he would collect as much as possible. Otherwise, once those Masters arrived, a fierce battle would be inevitable!

For the next two days, Yang Kai guarded the Extraordinary Treasure Lotus.

Many cultivators were attracted by the Heavenly Manifestation, but through some stroke of luck, no one Yang Kai needed to fear had appeared.

The fate of those who did appear was naturally the same as that of Jing Li and his group. All of them came in high spirits and were expelled with great embarrassment!

Those who knew their limits handed over their Space Rings obediently and Yang Kai let them leave safely after a quick inspection. As for those who refused to be persuaded peacefully, Yang Kai naturally suppressed them before snatching their Space Rings and inspecting them himself.
