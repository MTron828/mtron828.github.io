Chapter 1637, Heart Resonance

As long as Yang Kai didn’t involve himself, Yu Xue Qing wouldn’t have enough ability to stop him and he could still escape calmly.

As such, whether he lived or died was in Yang Kai’s hands.

Yu Xue Qing frowned and hurriedly shouted, “Little brother, there’s no need to fear him, his Brilliant Flame Sect is indeed strong but my Ice Heart Valley is not weak. Naturally, we will protect you if you help me kill this villain.”

She was worried that Yang Kai would give in to Yan Chi Lei’s threats.

After all, Yan Chi Lei was different from Jiang Xi. Although Jiang Xi’s strength was high, he was just a lone cultivator, if he was killed, no one would seek revenge for him, but Yan Chi Lei was an Elder of Brilliant Flame Sect, so there was a huge backer behind him.

“Naturally, I’ll help you kill him!” Yang Kai grinned towards Yan Chi Lei sarcastically. “Trying to threaten and intimidate me after things have gotten to this point, are all your Brilliant Flame Sect people so stupid?”

Yan Chi Lei’s face turned pale.

“By the way, I forgot to tell you, this isn’t the first time I killed someone from your Brilliant Flame Sect. I killed a guy named Kong Wen Dong in the Emperor Garden, and I also killed a guy named Zhang Qing in the Blood Prison some time ago. Weren’t they all from your Brilliant Flame Sect as well?”

Yan Chi Lei really panicked this time.

He had not expected that Yang Kai would have such a deep grudge with Brilliant Flame Sect. Whether it was Kong Wen Dong or Zhang Qing, both were famous figures in Brilliant Flame Sect, Elder-level figures who even ranked above him.

However, Kong Wen Dong had simply failed to return from the Emperor Garden while Zhang Qing had gone to the Blood Prison and had not been heard from yet.

If what Yang Kai said was true, though, didn’t that mean that they and everyone who accompanied them had died at his hands?

“I don’t have any kind of favourable impression of your Brilliant Flame Sect, so... die!” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became cold as a stream of extremely powerful Spiritual Energy shot out from his forehead and crashed towards Yan Chi Lei.

This attack was silent but extremely powerful. Like a sharp sword, it easily pierced through Yan Chi Lei’s defences and invaded his Knowledge Sea.

Yan Chi Lei cried out pitifully as his face went white, his Soul suffering severe damage.

Yu Xue Qing’s beautiful eyes lit up and she took this opportunity to push her Shi to its maximum extent. With her body as the centre, the area within a three hundred metre radius immediately became extremely cold, as if even the air was frozen.

A thin layer of frost appeared on Yan Chi Lei’s body and the frigid energy began seeping into his body, affecting his Saint Qi circulation and physical strength.

The Firebird used this opening to pounce, opening its giant maw and swallowing Yan Chi Lei into its abdomen.

The Firebird Artifact Spirit’s stomach bulged visibly as something inside of it seemed to be struggling, but it was quickly suppressed by the Firebird’s intense flames.

As time passed, this struggle became smaller and smaller until it eventually disappeared.

A flash of lightning suddenly appeared in the Firebird’s body before it turned into a stream of light and returned to Yang Kai’s body.

Yan Chi Lei obviously also cultivated the Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire Secret Technique, just like Zhang Qing and Kong Wen Dong, so after his death, his Heaven Scorching Thunder Fire was swallowed by the Firebird to strengthen itself.

And so, the crisis had been rapidly resolved with a completely unexpected ending.

Yu Xue Qing stood in place, looking at Yang Kai with complicated eyes while breathing heavily.

The other women from Ice Heart Valley also wore shocked expressions.

Only Qing Ya was showing a happy smile.

After a long silence, Yu Xue Qing was barely able to accept the reality in front of her and nodded to Yang Kai, “Many thanks.”

This time, if it weren’t for Yang Kai suddenly taking action, it would have been a miracle for even two or three of Ice Heart Valley’s team to escape, but now, not only were most of them essentially unharmed, they had even managed to kill several of Brilliant Flame Sect’s people.

Yu Xue Qing was naturally incredibly grateful to Yang Kai.

“No need for thanks, I was just protecting myself. Can we set off now?” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Yu Xue Qing nodded before getting one of her subordinates to clean up the battlefield then leading the group towards Pure Ice Island again.

This time no one showed any ill will towards Yang Kai.

They all dismissed their original hostility and no longer surrounded Yang Kai to protect him as before. The battle against Brilliant Flame Sect’s people had made all of them realize that Yang Kai was the strongest in this group.

He did not need their protection at all!

Along the way, many of these women would shoot Yang Kai curious looks from time to time. They could not understand how this young man cultivated. Obviously, he was only at the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm but his combat power was absurdly high.

“Thirteenth Elder, why have we been looking for him all this time?” Qing Ya took this chance to ask as she knew it was the best time to inquire about such matters.

The other disciples of Ice Heart Valley also wore curious expressions as they turned expected looks towards Yu Xue Qing.

They, along with thousands of their fellow Sect Sisters, had been running around and fighting for nearly a year all to find Yang Kai. Many of their Senior and Junior Sisters had died as a result, so it was only natural that they wanted to know why.

Yu Xue Qing frowned and with a slight look of embarrassment replied, “I don’t know the specific reason, but since Brilliant Flame Sect was looking for him, our Ice Heart Valley didn’t want them to succeed. Perhaps... perhaps he knows the real reason.”

While saying this, Yu Xue Qing turned to look at Yang Kai thoughtfully.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, seemingly unaware of his surroundings, showing no intention to answer.

“You don’t need to worry about this though. Since Sect Master and the Elder Council have decided this, they must have a good reason.”

“Yes!” The women nodded.

Nothing more happened along the way as the team lead by Yu Xue Qing travelled for another half a month.

Only after half a month did this group arrive at a seaside city.

This was obviously a city under the jurisdiction of Ice Heart Valley, and once they arrived, Yu Xue Qing brought Yang Kai straight to the Space Array and used it to teleport to Pure Ice Island.

Once he arrived at Pure Ice Island’s Outer Island, Yang Kai noticed a certain change and a trace of excitement appeared on his face. Turning his eyes to stare in a certain direction, he seemed to be peering across space towards a distant location.

At the same time, in a certain ice room on the Inner Island, Su Yan, who was in meditation, opened her beautiful eyes as her tender body shivered.

At this moment, she too sensed something.

She felt Yang Kai’s aura!

Since the two of them cultivated the Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art, as long as they weren’t too far apart, they could sense each other’s existence.

Although the Outer Island and the Inner Island were a few hundred kilometres apart, that could not impede the connection between Yang Kai and Su Yan!

[She’s here!]

[He came!]

At the exact same moment, the two noticed each other’s existence.

Yang Kai stood in place, his expression softening greatly.

Su Yan also hurriedly got up and went towards the entrance!

But as soon as she walked out of her ice room, she was stopped by two women.

“Junior Sister Su, where are you going?” The woman surnamed Zhou quickly stood in front of Su Yan and questioned coldly.

“Senior Sister Zhou, I want to go out!” Su Yan looked at her pleadingly.

“No!” The woman surnamed Zhou shook her head decisively, “Great Elder ordered that you are not to take a single step outside this room. Don’t make things difficult for your Senior Sisters.”

“Yes, Junior Sister Su, the two of us are responsible for monitoring you and also cannot move from this place. Just because you are Great Elder’s disciple, do you think you can not put us Senior Sisters in your eyes? Please go back inside,” The other woman also looked at Su Yan coldly.

Being forced to monitor Su Yan was an incredibly dull task, one where they could not leave or focus on their cultivation, causing them no small amount of grief.

This task had caused both women to complain deeply about Su Yan in their hearts. Also, they did not like how Su Yan was so heavily favoured, so they did not even try to speak politely.

“Two Senior Sisters, Junior Sister doesn’t want to make things difficult for you, but I must go out. I promise I will be back in half a day!” Su Yan bit her red lips and looked at them helplessly.

“Junior Sister really doesn’t put us Senior Sisters in her eyes!” The woman surnamed Zhou sneered, “Have you ever thought about the consequences? What will happen if you go out and Great Elder finds out? What kind of punishment will we receive? I don’t know what you want to go out for, but I’m not going to take responsibility for your truant behaviour.”

“Junior Sister is Great Elder’s favourite disciple, so Great Elder may not punish you too harshly, but what about us? You do not know how severe Great Elder is. Could it be that Junior Sister wants to push us to the brink of death? Junior Sister may look like a beautiful flower but apparently, she’s nothing but a vicious snake.”

Su Yan opened her mouth, but no words came out.

Although these two were clearly exaggerating things, it was also undeniable that if she went out, the two of them would be implicated.

Su Yan’s expression turned sad for a moment before she said softly, “Junior Sister has been inconsiderate.”

Her man had arrived on Pure Ice Island and was so close to her, but she could not go out to meet him, making Su Yan feel like a knife was being driven into her heart.

“Since you understand, hurry back inside!” The woman surnamed Zhou coldly snorted.

Su Yan nodded helplessly and turned back.

Seeing the door to the ice room close shut, the two women standing guard outside sneered.

The woman surnamed Zhou even snickered, “Finally, we’ve gotten some revenge. Did she think she could do whatever she wished after becoming Great Elder’s disciple?”

The other chuckled and said cheerfully, “Who told her to have eyes higher than the top of her head? If she had a good relationship with us before, we wouldn’t have embarrassed her here.”

“We are her Senior Sisters; it is our responsibility to teach her how to behave appropriately.”

“Then, should we inform Great Elder about this matter?”

The woman surnamed Zhou contemplated for a moment before shaking her head, “There’s no need. Since she was not able to go out, she won’t be punished even if we make a report. It will not be too late to inform Great Elder once she really makes some kind of mistake. At that time, Great Elder will definitely not spare her.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Senior Sister is wise,” The other woman’s eyes lit up.

...

“Little brother!” Yu Xue Qing’s call awakened Yang Kai and he finally retracted his gaze.

Ice Heart Valley’s Thirteenth Elder had a strange expression on her face as she lightly coughed and said, “The Inner Island of Pure Ice Island is in that direction. As a man, you can’t step foot into it. We are now on the outer island, but if it weren’t for the special situation this time, you wouldn’t have been allowed to enter this place either.”

“It is already Junior’s honour to be able to enter Pure Ice Island, this Junior offers his sincere thanks to Senior!” Yang Kai declared.

Because he could sense Su Yan nearby, Yang Kai was in a good mood and suddenly felt that these women from Ice Heart Valley were more radiant and genial.

Although she did not know why Yang Kai suddenly underwent some subtle changes, Yu Xue Qing didn’t probe any deeper, instead just nodding and saying, “You will have to remain here for the time being. As for what happens next... I will inform you after I report to Valley Master and the other Elders.”
