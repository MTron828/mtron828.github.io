Chapter 1723, Arranging an Array

Somewhere on Black Reef Island.

Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged, his eyes closed, maintaining a state of mental tranquillity.

The light sound of footsteps rang out nearby, causing Yang Kai to open his eyes and see Sea Temple’s Third Temple Master Qi Yun Hai along with a small group of others.

Facing Yang Kai’s gaze, Qi Yun Hai quickly lowered his head, putting on a respectful look.

After learning that Yang Kai was the Star Master of Shadowed Star, Qi Yun Hai had not dared act presumptuous anymore. Although his cultivation was the same as Yang Kai’s, the latter was a genuine Star Master. Even if there were a thousand Qi Yun Hai’s, they would not be Yang Kai’s opponent.

Immediately, Qi Yun Hai professed wrongs and swore he had been enlightened, apologizing profusely for his mistakes.

Jiang Huai An had been crippled by Yang Kai, and the position of First Temple Master was vacant, so although Sha Hu was dissatisfied with Qi Yun Hai coveting life while fearing death, he had to compromise for Sea Temple’s sake and did not try to embarrass him further, even going so far as to ask Yang Kai to spare Qi Yun Hai’s life.

“Sect Master Yang, I’ve brought the people and materials you requested,” Qi Yun Hai stopped five metres away from Yang Kai and stood still while reporting respectfully.

Yang Kai raised his eyes and looked at the six people behind Qi Yun Hai, nodding lightly before stretching out his hand and saying, “Give them to me.”

“Yes!” Qi Yun Hai stepped forward and handed a Space Ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai swept the contents of this ring with his Divine Sense and upon confirming that everything he had requested was inside, he nodded, “Good, you may leave. Tell Old Sha that the Space Array here will take about seven or eight days to complete and that he need not worry about it. He can focus on settling the internal affairs of Sea Temple first.”

With Jiang Huai An being crippled, there were inevitably some turbulences in Sea Temple, so although Sha Hu had no intention of getting involved with such mundane matters, only he could assume command at this moment and was therefore quite busy.

“Many thanks for your consideration, Sect Master Yang, I will definitely bring Martial Uncle Sha your message.”

“En.”

Qi Yun Hai quickly left, seemingly not daring to remain near Yang Kai for a long time.

After he left though, Yang Kai looked at the remaining six cultivators. Among these six, there were males and females, old and young. What was unusual was that those who were old seemed to be very old, while those who were young were very young, possibly below twenty years old. These six also weren’t strong, the fiercest among them only a First-Order Origin Realm cultivator while the weakest was only a Third-Order Saint.

While Yang Kai observed these six, these six were also observing Yang Kai, their eyes filled with curiosity.

After all, this young man in front of them rumoured to be the Star Master of Shadowed Star! In other words, he was the lord of the Cultivation Star they lived on.

Before bringing them here, Qi Yun Hai had also specifically warned them to absolutely obey Yang Kai and to follow any instructions he gave them. If they were to offend Yang Kai in any way, they would suffer severe punishment under the Sect’s Laws.

“You are the best Array Masters in Sea Temple?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Among the six, an old man stepped forward, cupped his fists, and replied, “Reporting to Sect Master Yang, we six are indeed the most talented Array Masters in Sea Temple.”

“Good,” Yang Kai gently nodded, “Before Qi Yun Hai brought you here, he should have told you the reason, yes?”

“Third Temple Master said that we would be assisting Sect Master Yang in refining a Space Array to connect my Sea Temple and High Heaven Sect in order to facilitate an exchange of cultivation materials between our two forces,” The old man replied again.

“En. Since you understand, I won’t bother with any nonsense. In terms of materials, your Sea Temple has provided everything necessary and all that’s left is to refine them into an Array Base and then engrave the appropriate Spirit Array. I believe this shouldn’t be a difficult task for you.”

The old man seemed to realize that Yang Kai was not the domineering and wicked person he had imagined, and instead actually possessed a friendly attitude, allowing him to relax significantly. Proudly nodding his head, the old man replied, “As long as we are provided with the appropriate refining method, we six will definitely not disappoint Sect Master Yang. “

“Great!” Yang Kai smiled lightly as he beckoned the six people over and began explaining to them what kind of materials should be smelted together as well as the general shape the finished products needed to be refined into.

These six people had extremely high accomplishments in arranging Spirit Arrays, far better than Yang Kai’s at least, so after only a brief explanation, they had comprehended what they needed to do.

Next, Yang Kai took out the materials prepared by Sea Temple one by one, divided them into categories, and gave them to his six assistants to begin the refinement process.

The layout of a Space Array was extremely complicated, but before coming here, Yang Kai had already arranged one outside High Heaven Sect, so he had some familiarity with the process now.

Yang Kai did most of the primary work himself and had only asked Qi Yun Hai to bring these six people over in order to save him some time on the more menial tasks.

Yang Kai was not worried about what these six learned during this period, as the most fundamental Spirit Array of this Space Array was still exclusively held onto by him. As long as this array wasn’t leaked out, even if these six tried to arrange a Space Array of their own, it wouldn’t work.

In this remote clearing on Black Reef Island, seven people worked quietly.

Five days later, a Space Array with a ten-metre radius had been fully arranged.

Just looking at it, one could tell that this Space Array was not the same as the ones which were seen in major cities. It appeared much plainer and was essentially just a large circular platform.

The biggest difference, appearance-wise, was its significantly larger size.

This Space Array was designed to span a distance of several million kilometres and could accommodate up to fifty people at once.

This was incomparable to the Space Arrays currently on Shadowed Star.

With the basic structure now set up, Yang Kai now needed to engrave the actual Spirit Array himself. The six Array Masters of Sea Temple did not leave, however, and instead stood quietly to the side, paying close attention to Yang Kai’s movements.

Unfortunately, no matter how they looked, they were unable to glean any useful information.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense shuttled back and forth inside the array base, rapidly portraying a series of mysterious and complicated patterns and runes which gradually formed the Space Array’s Spirit Array.

With his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy, it was easy for Yang Kai to leave precise markings on the already refined materials.

The entire process went incredibly smoothly, and Yang Kai was finished after only half an hour.

After checking it carefully, Yang Kai smiled upon confirming that there were no errors in the Spirit Array. Pouring his Space Force into the Space Array, Yang Kai activated it and established a connection with the Space Array he had arranged outside High Heaven Sect.

“Is it completed?” The old man asked hesitantly.

“Basically, as long as you insert enough Saint Crystals to power it, it should function properly,” Yang Kai nodded and replied.

The six people all gasped as they stared at Yang Kai in admiration.

A new Space Array! It had only taken five days to arrange such a massive Space Array! If they were to tell their peers about this matter, none would believe them.

On Shadowed Star, the method to arrange Space Arrays had long been lost while all the existing Space Arrays were relics from ancient times. The most the current cultivators could do was make some simple repairs, but they couldn’t arrange a new one.

Moreover, even in ancient times, when that layout method was still known, spending such a short time to arrange such a Space Array was certainly unheard of.

The ancient records of great Sects said that the arrangement of a Space Array was a laborious task that cost a massive amount of time and resources to complete.

It would already be a great accomplishment to complete a functional Space Array within a few years.

But now, they had arranged one in just five days! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The six Array Masters exchanged looks of disbelief amongst themselves as each of them felt a sense of excitement and glory in their hearts; after all, they had contributed to the arrangement of this Space Array.

“Sect Master Yang, is it possible for this old master to try it?” The old man rubbed his hands excitedly and asked.

Although being the first person to use this new Space Array did not have any substantial benefits to it, to him, it was a matter of honour.

“Wait a moment,” Yang Kai chuckled before taking out some strange materials from his Space Ring and quickly smelting them together.

Under his intense Saint Qi, the impurities in these materials were rapidly removed and the useful metals were gradually amalgamated and shaped.

The six people did not know what Yang Kai was doing but they all waited patiently in anticipation.

Soon, a small token appeared in Yang Kai’s hand. This token was unremarkable and dull in colour, not even giving off any energy fluctuations. The only distinctive feature was the ‘High’ character engraved on it.

This character had a certain charm to it, that evoked images of soaring dragons and phoenixes.

Yang Kai refined six such tokens in total and tossed one to each of the six waiting Array Masters.

Each of the six people caught their respective token and examined it carefully.

The old man seemed to think of something and wore a look of excitement on his face as he hastily asked, “Sect Master Yang, dare I ask, is this...”

He was misunderstanding something, however, thinking that Yang Kai had given them something precious.

“These are Transmission Tokens. Without a Transmission Token, the only result of activating this Space Array will be exile to The Void, never to return!” Yang Kai explained lightly.

The expressions of the six people changed greatly, only now understanding the purpose of these six tokens especially refined by Yang Kai.

The old man quickly composed himself as he realized the importance of these tokens and cupped his fists, “Sect Master Yang is quite meticulous, this old master is impressed. With these tokens, the risk of a large number of cultivators suddenly being able to invade either of our two forces using this Space Array can be mostly eliminated.”

When the other five people heard him say this, they finally understood the reason Yang Kai had refined these tokens.

Although Space Arrays were convenient in that they connected two distant places, if an enemy ever managed to take control of it, it would then become a risk as it would offer a means to invade directly into the heart of one’s force. However, with the Transmission Token refined by Yang Kai, this risk was mitigated.

Without a Transmission Token, it was impossible to use this Space Array.

Yang Kai just smiled and did not say anything. With a wave of his hand, he used his Saint Qi to envelope the six people and stood atop the Space Array, “Let’s test whether this array can be used then.”
