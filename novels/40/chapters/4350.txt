“Thanks to Junior Brother, this Senior Sister was fortunate enough to break through after leaving the Blood Monster Cave Heaven.” Qu Hua Shang covered her lips and giggled.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled something. This seductress told him before that she was cultivating the Heartless Dao. If she wanted to advance to the Open Heaven Realm, she had to fall in love with someone, and then cut ties with that love.

At that time, she had told him frankly that he was the one who she chose to fall in love with and give up the love she had for him.

They went through dire situations together and supported each other throughout the Blood Monster Cave Heaven. Being alone together, even a man like Yang Kai who had seen plenty of beauties could not help feeling some fondness for Qu Hua Shang. However, due to various reasons, he did not want to overstep his boundaries. However, Qu Hua Shan had apparently already fallen in love along the way.

It was easy to fall in love, but not so much to cut ties.

Now that Qu Hua Shang has advanced to Open Heaven Realm, it meant that she has successfully given up her love, but Yang Kai had no idea how she had done it and was still standing here in front of him, flirting so casually.

Obviously, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven should have some special methods. Whatever the case was, Yang Kai was truly happy that she had advanced to the Open Heaven Realm, and he immediately cupped his fist with a smile, “Congratulations, Senior Sister. Having the Sixth-Order Open Heaven as your starting point, Senior Sister’s name will surely resound throughout the 3,000 Worlds in the future.”

Qu Hua Shang pouted, “What’s there to congratulate? This Senior Sister’s heart is hurting so bad. If you don’t believe me, you can feel it yourself!” After saying so, she puffed her chest out and leaned towards Yang Kai.

Bian Yu Qing’s head was lowered so far by now that it was like she wanted to bury her head in the ground.

Yang Kai could not stand it any longer and hastily took two steps back.

“Ahem, ahem…” A soft cough suddenly came from beside him, and a somewhat familiar voice followed after, “This Old Master is not dead yet. If the two of you are going to flirt, can you please not do it in front of this old man? This old man is getting old and his Blood Qi is not so strong anymore, the stimulation isn’t good for me.”

Yang Kai turned to look at him, “You are…”

Qu Hua Shang did not come alone. She was accompanied by another person covered in black clothes, making it difficult to make out the body, appearance, or even gender of this individual.

But as soon as Yang Kai heard the voice, he could tell that the person was a man, and he should be quite elderly.

Moreover, Yang Kai felt that he should have met this person before; otherwise, the voice would not have sounded familiar.

The man lifted his hood, revealing an old face with a slight smile. He cupped his fist, “Sect Master Yang, we meet again.”

Yang Kai pondered for a while, then suddenly asked, “Old Zhou?”

This elderly man was obviously the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Asura Cave Heaven. His surname was Zhou, and that was all Yang Kai knew about his name. He only knew Old Zhou because he was the person in charge of the Asura Arena in Thousand Birds Star City.

The last time Yang Kai went to Thousand Birds Star City in search of the Proprietress, he was forced by Yu Luo Sha, a Core Disciple of Asura Cave Heaven, to participate in a bout in the Asura Arena against her. In that battle, Yang Kai bet 100 million Open Heaven Pills on himself, and won a fortune with the 10:1 odds against him. In the end, it was Old Zhou who came forward and handed over his prize. At that time, Old Zhou also compensated Yang Kai an extra 150 million with an agreement that he would never set foot in any Asura Arena again in the future.

Yang Kai could truly be called invincible below the Open Heaven Realm. Even Yu Luo Sha was beaten by him in a single move. With such a display, Old Zhou really had no choice but to make such a proposal.

There was no way Yang Kai would not want to gain benefits without any cost. In addition to that, Old Zhou also revealed that some Cave Heavens and Paradises were targeting him, so it was a good trade.

Facts had proven that what Old Zhou said was right, the tree that rises above the forest would be the first one toppled by the wind. In the Blood Monster Cave Heaven, Yang Kai was targeted by many disciples from various Cave Heavens and Paradises, especially Pei Wen Xuan from Myriad Demon Heaven and Yin Xin Zhao from Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven, both of whom repeatedly tried to kill him.

Yang Kai did not expect that the person who came to Void Land with Qu Hua Shang was actually Old Zhou. He had always thought it was some Master from Yin Yang Heaven who was sent to protect Qu Hua Shang.

Now that he thought about it though, this situation made more sense. Now that Qu Hua Shang was a Sixth-Order Master, despite not having full control of her strength, there were not many left in this world who could threaten her. All the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were old monsters, so who would embarrass a Junior for nothing?

Yang Kai was of course an exception. He stood out too much and represented a future threat that forced two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to secretly establish the Hundred Sect Alliance. In the end, these two Masters were forced to act personally, but were ultimately deterred by two Divine Spirits.

“Why is Old Zhou here instead of tending to Thousand Birds Star City’s Asura Arena? And with Senior Sister Qu too, for what reason have you come today?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Qu Hua Shang replied, “This Senior Sister met Manager Zhou right outside Void Land. We didn’t make any arrangements in advance. Manager Zhou asked me to help bring him in, probably because he had something to discuss with Junior Brother Yang.”

The people of the Cave Heavens and Paradises were more or less allies. Qu Hua Shang had also been to Thousand Birds Star City, so she naturally recognized Manager Zhou. Qu Hua Shang could not refuse if Manager Zhou made such a request, and it wasn’t a big deal anyway. Yang Kai would not blame her for this, so she made the decision on her own.

Manager Zhou smiled slightly, “This Old Master is here to discuss something with Sect Master Yang.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed before replying with a smile, “Please come in and talk.”

They were guests after all, so Yang Kai could not let them stand outside forever, that would be quite rude.

The two of them entered while Bian Yu Qing made arrangements for the maidservants to serve fruit and tea before leaving.

After taking a few sips of tea and saying a few pleasantries, Manager Zhou got down to business, “This Old Master is here on the orders from the Master Sect. There are two things for which we would like to partner with Void Land.”

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “Partner?”

“Indeed!” Manager Zhou nodded.

Yang Kai played with the teacup in his hand and asked, “Didn’t Old Zhou hear about the battle that happened in Void Land recently? The Hundred Sect Alliance suddenly ambushed us, and Void Land was forced to fight back. The battle resulted in over 10,000 casualties, including countless Open Heaven Realm Masters. Various Cave Heavens and Paradises are already openly targeting me. Are you not afraid that you might upset others if Asura Cave Heaven does business with me?”

Manager Zhou chuckled, “Even Sect Master Yang said that it was the Hundred Sect Alliance that invaded your Void Land. It has nothing to do with the Cave Heavens and Paradises.”

Yang Kai looked at him with a half-smile.

Manager Zhou shifted his gaze uncomfortably before lightly clearing his throat, “Sect Master Yang is a worldly man, there’s no need to state things so bluntly. The Hundred Sect Alliance seemingly had the upper hand, and they knew well about your Void Land, but still ended up in a disastrous defeat. Even Kong Feng was captured in the end; otherwise, those two would not have shown up rashly.”

Yang Kai replied lightly, “Does Manager Zhou mean that my Void Land should have been breached and all of our 600,000 disciples living here should have been ruthlessly exterminated?”

Manager Zhou noticed his displeased expression then quickly added, “Sect Master Yang is too serious, this Old Master did not mean to imply that.”

Yang Kai softly snorted.

Manager Zhou continued solemnly, “What this Old Master meant to say was that even the Hundred Sect Alliance couldn’t defeat Void Land, and unless the Cave Heavens and Paradises take action themselves, no one can do anything to Void Land in the 3,000 Worlds. Now Void Land even has two Divine Spirits protecting it, with one of them being Bi Xi, who has lived for countless millennia. One would have to gather at least five Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters if they wanted to take down Void Land without suffering disastrous losses.”

[Has Bi Xi’s identity been exposed?] Yang Kai’s heart clenched; however, it was not surprising when he thought about it. It was not something that could be hidden any longer after so many people witnessed Void Land’s blatant migration.

“It doesn’t mean that the Cave Heavens and Paradises are not capable of dispatching such a lineup. Every Cave Heaven and Paradise has extraordinary heritage, so which one of them does not have at least a few Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters? It’s just that those Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters have long since stopped caring about worldly affairs, and are always cultivating in retreat. They will not show up unless a true disaster appears. So it’s essentially impossible to gather five Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.” Manager Zhou explained eloquently, “So Sect Master Yang, as long as Void Land does not threaten the existence of any Cave Heaven or Paradise, there will be no more worries. No one would dare to attack Void Land again.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “So is that why Asura Cave Heaven wants to partner with me?”

Manager Zhou replied sternly, “Void Land is also qualified to partner with my Asura Cave Heaven.”

Yang Kai pondered for a while before nodding, “In regards to what, does Asura Cave Heaven want to partner with me?”

Manager Zhou answered, “Sect Master Yang has been to the Asura Arena, so you should know that it is my Asura Cave Heaven’s biggest source of income and one of its most important training facilities. All other First Class Star Cities have their own Asura Arenas, even some Second Class Star Cities have Asura Arenas. Now that Void Star City is so popular and it is still continuing to rise, Asura Cave Heaven naturally doesn’t want to miss out on such an opportunity, so the Master Sect has sent this Old Master here to build an Asura Arena!”

“I see. So that’s the proposal!” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Yang Kai has experienced the popularity of the Asura Arena. As a place that used violence to solve all matters, the Asura Arena was a good place for hot-tempered cultivators with grievances that could not be resolved with words, or for blood-thirsty cultivators who were hindered by various rules to vent out their frustrations.

...

That was the reason why the Asura Arena was so well liked.

When Void Star City was rebuilt and the new Governor’s Mansion established, the law enforcement team were deployed and anyone who dared to start a quarrel or stir up trouble would all be quickly suppressed and captured.

In this way, although the order of the Star City could be maintained, grudges and grievances would inevitably rise up in the long run.

Some things were better to be allowed to happen than to be prevented. If an Asura Arena was built in the Star City, it would be a good place to settle such issues and for those who liked to cause trouble to vent.

Furthermore, the existence of the Asura Arena could definitely enhance the popularity of the Star City and drive its development even further.

This was a win-win situation for Void Land and Asura Heaven.

Yang Kai had no reason to disagree.

So after just a moment of contemplation, Yang Kai nodded and agreed, “This Yang is glad that Asura Cave Heaven is willing to build an Asura Arena in my Void Star City, but Void Land will need to participate in this venture.”

Manager Zhou frowned, “What does Sect Master Yang mean?”

Yang Kai replied, “The land required for the Asura Arena will be provided by Void Land free of rent or taxes, but Void Land will require 30% of the profits made!”

Manager Zhou gaped at him but quickly smiled, “Sect Master Yang, isn’t your appetite a little too big?”
