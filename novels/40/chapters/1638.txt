Inside a small guest house on the Outer Island, adjacent to the sea, the sound of waves gently crashing echoed lightly.

After Yu Xue Qing arranged for Yang Kai to live here, she took her subordinates and left, leaving only a lower rank disciple to attend to Yang Kai’s daily life.

Before leaving, Qing Ya cast Yang Kai a glance, silently telling him to remain calm.

Yang Kai understood her meaning clearly.

Now that he had arrived on Pure Ice Island, and learned that Su Yan was only a few hundred kilometres away, his yearning to see her had grown far stronger. However, he also knew that Pure Ice Island was no ordinary place, so he wasn’t about to charge in recklessly.

Sitting down cross-legged in the small house, Yang Kai held Su Yan’s Ice Soul Bead in his hand motionlessly.

Yang Kai did not release his Divine Sense, but he could clearly feel that hundred of kilometres away, there was an aura closely tied to his own, sharing a deep and profound connection.

Of course, this was Su Yan’s aura. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At the same time, Su Yan was also sitting in her ice room, her beautiful eyes closed tightly and her long eyelashes trembling slightly.

The two of them were immersed in feeling each other’s existence, feeling each beat of the other’s heart.

This kind of silent, invisible connection was deeper than any kind of verbal communication could be and allowed both to feel warm in body and spirit.

At a certain moment, the two smiled at exactly the same time and a wondrous energy burst from their bodies, crossing the barrier of space to meet at the centre of Pure Ice Island.

Yang Kai felt as if he was able to see Su Yan standing in front of him happily. Her figure remained the same as it had thirty years ago.

He could even feel that Su Yan was reaching out to touch him.

He responded in kind.

This spiritual resonance between the two of them grew more intense as their auras gradually began merging.

There was no need for words as the two of them were clearly able to sense everything about the other and know what they had experienced over these years, as if they had lived them, themselves.

At a certain spot on the Inner Island, in Ran Yun Ting’s ice room, Ran Yun Ting was meditating when she suddenly frowned, seemingly noticing something as she turned to look up into the sky doubtfully.

In the next instant, the communication artifact beside her suddenly received a Divine Sense Message. Picking up the communication artifact and pouring her Divine Sense into it, Ran Yun Ting learnt of a certain piece of information and her face couldn’t help but sink, “Junior Sister Yu found that little brat and even brought him to Pure Ice Island? So that is how it is, it’s that little beast who is disturbing Su Yan’s mind!”

“Little bastard, you court death!”

Ran Yun Ting’s eyes flared with hostility and an extremely tyrannical Spiritual Energy burst from her forehead and smashed towards the sky, bombarding a certain spot above Pure Ice Island.

Yang Kai, who was silently meeting with Su Yan, did not expect anyone to attack him at that moment.

The resonance of their minds was different from interacting with one another via Divine Sense. The former had no killing and defensive power at all while the latter was capable of attacking and defending.

As soon as Ran Yun Ting used her Divine Sense, Yang Kai felt that his connection with Su Yan was cut off arbitrarily. Not only that, but the shock on his mind made his face pale and he nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood.

“Who dares!” Yang Kai opened his eyes suddenly, his face extremely ugly.

He could naturally feel that there was some murderous intent behind the attack which cut off his connection with Su Yan, as if his assailant did not care whether he lived or died. If Yang Kai’s Soul had not been far stronger than ordinary, he would have suffered heavy losses.

This kind of injury to one’s Soul could not be healed by ordinary means.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed coldly, but soon he shook his head helplessly.

He was the one mostly at fault just now; after all, this was Pure Ice Island, the headquarters of Ice Heart Valley. In thousands of years, he was the first man to set foot onto its Outer Island, so him taking such rash action just now was truly somewhat improper.

After thinking about it, Yang Kai calmed down and no longer concerned himself about it.

But judging from the power of that Spiritual Energy burst, it had most likely come from one of the top five Elders in Ice Heart Valley.

After suffering such a loss, Yang Kai no longer dared to act rashly. In any case, there would always be a chance for him to meet Su Yan again. As for Su Yan’s safety, Yang Kai was not worried as she was the Disciple of Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder. No matter which Elder interfered with them, they would naturally not have targeted Su Yan as well.

Inside Su Yan’s ice room, she suddenly opened her eyes and her face paled as she called out loudly, “Honoured Master!”

“Reflect on your mistake behind closed doors, if you try to do the same thing again, this Elder will personally take the head of that little bastard!” Ran Yun Ting’s ice-cold voice sounded in Su Yan’s ears.

Su Yan’s face went even paler as she opened her mouth, as if she wanted to say something, but no words came out in the end.

“You need to take care of yourself!” Ran Yun Ting seemed to be quite disappointed with Su Yan now and after leaving these cold words, she no longer spoke.

In Ice Heart Valley’s Elder Hall, the Sect’s leadership had all gathered again after their last meeting nearly a year ago.

“Valley Master, what is so important that you had to call all of us here at this time?” One Elder asked.

Bing Long smiled gently and replied, “There is indeed something important, but it is a happy event.”

“Oh? What happy event?” Everyone became curious.

“Elder Yu has found the young man we’ve been searching for and brought him back to Pure Ice Island,” Bing Long did not keep them in suspense and said with a smile.

“He’s been found?”

“Junior Sister Yu’s methods are impressive, finding that boy is a great merit!”

“Very good, very good! It has been more than a year since we began searching and the Sect has suffered many casualties as a result, now we can finally have the disciples fall back and rest.”

“But Valley Master, did we ever discover why Brilliant Flame Sect was searching for him? What secrets or value does he possess that would cause Brilliant Flame Sect to seek him so doggedly?”

“This... this Queen doesn’t know. Elder Yu, you brought him back, were you able to learn anything regarding this?” Bing Long cast her gaze to Yu Xue Qing.

The latter, however, just shook her head slowly, “On the way back, I asked him, but he refused to answer. However, from my observations, he is definitely no ordinary person.”

“Why do you say that?”

“He... he should be a genius among geniuses. Yan Chi Lei of Brilliant Flame Sect died at his hands.”

“What? He killed Yan Chi Lei?” Bing Long’s brow furrowed, “Didn’t you report that this boy was only a Second-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator?”

“En, he is truly only a Second-Order Origin Realm cultivator, but he is capable of fighting above his realm, which is why I called him a genius among geniuses.”

“Impressive!” Bing Long nodded.

“Jiang Xi was also killed by him,” Yu Xue Qing expression turned solemn, “In single combat and in less than twenty breaths at that!”

“Jiang Xi? That Jiang Xi?” The Fifth Elder of Ice Heart Valley narrowed her eyes as a look of shock appeared on her face.

“That Jiang Xi.”

“How is that possible?”

“Although Jiang Xi is not from a prominent Sect and has always been a lone wanderer, he had many fortuitous encounters in his early years and his strength is extraordinary. Not only is he a peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, his Shi was also close to reaching the grand accomplishment stage.”

“He is one of the most likely candidates on Scarlet Wave Star to break through to the Origin King Realm. How could he have been killed by that young man? Junior Sister Yu, are you making a joke?”

“How could I be joking about this kind of matter? Junior Sister witnessed the entire fight with her own eyes, and there are a dozen disciples who can testify to the veracity of my words,” Yu Xue Qing said seriously.

The Elders of Ice Heart Valley all wore looks of amazement, several of them soon turning to their Fifth Elder, wanting to hear her opinion.

Among everyone present, she was the only one who had personally fought Jiang Xi, so her thoughts on this matter were critical.

Fifth Elder didn’t refuse and after pondering for a moment said, “The last time I fought Jiang Xi was twenty years ago, and it took me a whole day to severely wound him, but I still failed to kill him. Today, I would not necessarily be his opponent. In Ice Heart Valley, the Elders who could stand alone against Jiang Xi should number no more than three!”

*Si...*

Gasps resounded throughout the hall as the expressions of all the Elders present turned solemn.

Fifth Elder was not making any exaggerations and was simply stating the facts, but because of this, it had all the more impact.

“Does this mean that young man’s strength can rank amongst the top three of us Elders?”

“He is only a Second Order, if he breaks through to the Third-Order...”

“It’s more than that! Fighting and killing are two entirely different concepts. Him being able to kill Jiang Xi in less than twenty breaths means that only Great Elder is on par with him!”

The expressions of this group of Elders suddenly dimmed as none of them had confidence in what they were saying, because they knew that even if Great Elder took action personally, she may not be able to kill Jiang Xi in just twenty breaths.

After all of them realized this, their expressions only contained shock.

“It’s a pity he is not a woman,” Bing Long rubbed her brow lightly and smiled bitterly.

If Yang Kai was a woman, Bing Long would have done whatever it took to recruit him into Ice Heart Valley. Such talent had a much higher chance of breaking through to the Origin King Realm in the future, much more than the ordinary Origin Realm Cultivators.

The reason why Ice Heart Valley was one of the two great forces on Scarlet Wave Star was that it had an Origin King Realm assuming command of the Sect. But, if there was an additional Origin King among their ranks they could completely suppress Brilliant Flame Sect and possibly even destroy it, allowing them to become the sole ruler of Scarlet Wave Star.

“It doesn’t matter if he’s not a woman, he just has to marry one of our Ice Heart Valley’s disciples.” An Elder suggested with a smile.

“Not a bad idea, but he may not agree,” Another Elder sitting next to her shook his head slowly, “His strength and aptitude are incredible, and he doesn’t seem to be very old, so how could he have any lack of women? There are likely many women who would willingly follow him.”

“How could those cheap women compare to the elite disciples of my Ice Heart Valley? It would be his blessing to marry into Ice Heart Valley.”

“Fair enough.”

The Elders began chattering and expressing their opinions, seemingly quite eager to find a suitable candidate to marry Yang Kai right now so they could tie him to Ice Heart Valley.

Bing Long lightly coughed and interrupted with an awkward expression, “Have you all forgotten that Brilliant Flame Sect has been searching for him? Although Brilliant Flame Sect is not enough on its own for our Ice Heart Valley to dread, this matter likely involves Sir Luo Hai of Green Mountains Star... if we were to upset Sir Luo Hai, our Ice Heart Valley may not be able to bear his anger.”

All the Elder’s expressions darkened hearing this and they all fell silent.
