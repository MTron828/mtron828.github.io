It was a shiny golden token, one that anyone could notice had extraordinary origins at a glance.

Sun Ping caught the token and rubbed it for a while, then smiled, “I heard that your noble Temple divides its disciple tokens into four grades, Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold. Only Core Disciples would obtain a Golden Token. By the look of this, this should be the Azure Sun Golden Token.”

The quality of the token was sensational, so even Sun Ping could tell that it was authentic.

Of course, Yang Kai’s Golden Token was not a fake as it really was something given to him by Gao Xue Ting herself back then. Even though she did not forcefully demand him to join Azure Sun Temple, he was still regarded as an in-name disciple of the temple, and was given an Azure Sun Golden Token.

The Azure Sun Golden Token he possessed was the reason Yang Kai chose to impersonate Xiao Bai Yi for this trip.

“Wrong,” Yang Kai chortled, “My Temple’s tokens are divided into five grades, not four.”

“Five grades?” Sun Ping raised his eyebrows.

Yang Kai continued, “Elders hold the Jade Tokens!”

“I see,” Sun Ping nodded lightly. He did not know whether he should believe him or not; after all, he did not know much about Azure Sun Temple. However, it did not seem like Yang Kai was lying.

For a moment, he could not help hesitating.

It was a big boon for an Emperor Realm Master to join Seeking Passion Sect’s forces, as he would undoubtedly provide great assistance during the war. The only issue was, Sun Ping was still uncertain about Yang Kai’s background.

However, Sun Ping was a bit reluctant to let go of such a Master, and moreover, if he rejected Yang Kai, the world might mock the Seeking Passion Sect for being cowardly.

After a moment’s debate, Sun Ping turned to a young disciple and sent him a Divine Sense Message.

After hearing it, the young disciple stood up and cupped his fists towards Yang Kai, “Greetings from Cao Xu to Senior Brother.”

Yang Kai leered at him for a while, then paid no attention to him anymore. He had no idea what Sun Ping had ordered him to do.

Cao Xu pressed on, “A few years ago, when the Shattered Star Sea was opened, this Cao had the honour to meet a few young talents from the Southern Territory there!”

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat as he secretly cursed.

He pretended to be Xiao Bai Yi because he thought that no one could recognize him. Furthermore, he had the Azure Sun Golden Token with him, so his plan should have been perfect as it was a mix of both truth and lie.

But now, this guy named Cao Xu just declared that he went to the Shattered Star Sea before, and what was more, he actually met some cultivators from the Southern Territory.

If he recognized Xiao Bai Yi, his lies would be exposed.

“Oh?” Despite the uneasiness in his heart, Yang Kai looked at him steadily without the slightest change of expression, “This Xiao also went to Shattered Star Sea, but I have never seen Junior Brother.”

Cao Xu smiled wryly, “This Cao’s cultivation is weak, so the places I had visited were probably not somewhere that Senior Brother Xiao would put it in his eyes. It is only natural that you have never seen me.”

[He has never seen Xiao Bai Yi before!] Yang Kai’s courage was instantly buoyed by his statement and he replied, “Is that so? Then why is Junior Brother here? Do you have any advice for me?”

Cao Xu hurriedly explained, “This Cao doesn’t dare to. Although I did not meet any friends from Azure Sun Temple, I had met a few others from the Southern Territory. The one that I had the deepest impression of was Wu Chang. Since Senior Brother Xiao came from the Southern Territory, you must have known him as well.”

“Wu Chang…” Yang Kai nodded lightly. Wu Chang of Heavenly Martial Holy Land was born with the Yin-Yang Dual Body and was quite a ferocious character, so it was natural that he had a deep impression of him.

Yang Kai ignored Cao Xu and turned to Sun Ping who was observing him, waving his hand in front of him to compose the image of a certain character on his palm.

Yang Kai carried on, “Elder Sun, your intention of allowing Cao Xu to question me is to verify my identity. Now you may ask him whether this image is Wu Chang or not.”

Sun Ping turned to Cao Xu, and Cao Xu nodded gently, indicating that there was no mistake.

Sun Ping burst into laughter, “It seems that Young Master Xiao is indeed an elite disciple of Azure Sun Temple.”

There was nothing to be doubtful given that Yang Kai could condense the image of a Southern Territory genius and also possessed a Golden Token from Azure Sun Temple.

Yang Kai beamed, “Can I stay now?”

Sun Ping retracted his smile, and remarked pensively, “One final question.”

Yang Kai immediately became incensed and snapped, “Why are you all so annoying? This Young Master came to help your Seeking Passion Sect, not to accept your interrogation. What is Elder Sun’s motive for questioning this Young Master over and over again? Although the Seeking Passion Sect is not weak, that doesn’t mean my Azure Sun Temple is afraid of you!”

He used the prestige of Azure Sun Temple to unleash his anger on them on the spot, causing the surrounding cultivators to gape at him with their jaws dropped, secretly thinking that he was not afraid even if he was far away in the territory of others because he was truly a disciple from a top Sect. If it were for them, they would not have the courage to do the same.

Sun Ping responded with a smile, “Young Master Xiao, please calm yourself. If you have anything to say, please speak properly.”

“Old man, make sure this is the final question! If you continue to annoy this Young Master after this, I will just leave.” Yang Kai gritted his teeth.

“I guarantee you this is the last one.” Sun Ping assured with a solemn look.

Yang Kai replied with an upset face, “Go ahead.”

Sun Ping proceeded, “Since Young Master Xiao came from Azure Sun Temple, you should have no shortage in cultivation materials. Then, why are you here to receive our Seeking Passion Sect Recruitment Order?”

Yang Kai gawked for a moment before he laughed proudly, waving his fan as he clarified slowly, “Of course this Young Master is not short of cultivation resources. Honestly, all the benefits that your noble Sect had promised are nothing in this Young Master’s eyes, however…” Speaking until here, Yang Kai suddenly grinned, his smile looking extremely obscene, like a fox that had stolen a chicken.

“However?” Sun Ping further asked.

Yang Kai looked around, and whispered to Sun Ping, “Elder Sun, this Young Master is very interested in the beautiful women of Ice Heart Valley. I wonder if your noble Sect could pick a few Ice Heart Valley disciples for me to bring back to be my maids after the war?”

Sun Ping smiled and nodded in acknowledgement, “So, that is the plan of Young Master Xiao.”

He was quite relieved hearing that Yang Kai’s motive was out of desire for Ice Heart Valley’s disciples; after all, it would be strange if an Emperor Realm Master came to receive a Recruitment Order without any demands. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He was now aware that this Young Master Xiao in front of him was fond of beauties.

“Everyone loves beauty.” Yang Kai chuckled.

Sun Ping touched his beard and nodded, “En, not a problem. If we break Ice Heart Valley, based on the cultivation strength of Young Master Xiao, you definitely could share some Ice Heart Valley disciples. This Old Master believes that Sir Sect Master would not refuse, so this Old Master will approve your request on behalf of him.”

“Can I have ten of them?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Sun Ping could not help cackling, “Isn’t Young Master Xiao a little too greedy? There are only seven thousand disciples in Ice Heart Valley now, while our Seeking Passion Sect has a hundred thousand soldiers. Even if we distributed them only to the strongest among us, it would be impossible for Young Master Xiao to receive ten.”

“Eight then.” Yang Kai tried to bargain.

“Two, at most.” Sun Ping bluntly refused.

Yang Kai jumped, “Your Sect is too stingy.”

Sun Ping shook his head, “It’s not that our Sect is stingy, but we have too little meat for so many wolves.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Elder Sun, this Young Master will be honest with you. This Young Master is having a hard time in life. In fact, this Young Master has an arranged marriage from the Temple, but my fiancée is domineering, arrogant, and extremely ugly. That is why I fled out of the Southern Territory and came to the Northern Territory for training. It will be hard to get along with a shrewish wife at home, so I came in hopes of finding some attractive maids, okay? Elder Sun, for the sake of my pitiful life, allow me to have more please.”

Snickers resounded inside the hall as everyone was taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s misfortune, while even Sun Ping could not hold his laughter.

Nevertheless, he was not interested in Yang Kai’s troubles so he simply ignored the request, “Cao Xu, take Young Master Xiao to Elder Feng Chi, and let him assign some tasks to Young Master Xiao!” He gave an order to Cao Xue.

“Yes!” After receiving his order, Cao Xu gestured to ‘Young Master Xiao’ to leave, “This way please!”

Yang Kai stood still, whining, “Elder Sun, can we discuss this further?”

Needless to say, Sun Ping ignored him and disappeared with a flicker.

Yang Kai sighed and walked out with an unpleasant face. Wherever he went, everyone would avoid him.

After leaving the Recruitment Hall, Yang Kai still looked glum.

As such, Cao Xu just kept quiet and led the way in front of Yang Kai, trying to avoid touching a nerve. Soon, they left the city.

“Where are we going?” After a while, Yang Kai broke the silence.

Cao Xu replied, “To find Elder Feng Chi. He will assign some tasks to you.”

“Elder Feng Chi…” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “I heard that your noble Sect Master has the same surname too. Is this Elder Feng Chi… “

Cao Xu beamed, “Elder Feng Chi is the cousin of the Sect Master. Therefore, although he has only a First-Order Emperor, his status is only under the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master. He is responsible for the siege of Ice Heart Valley. At least for now.”

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded his head, “Then where are your Sect Master and Vice Sect Master? This is my first time here, perhaps it would be rude if this Young Master didn’t visit and greet them?”

A trace of disdain vaguely flashed across Cao Xu’s eyes as he thought to himself, [How could someone just meet the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master as they wish?] However, he quickly retracted his gaze and answered, “Sect Master is guarding Ice Moon City, and Vice Sect Master is accompanying him.”

“Good, next time then. There will always be a chance to meet,” Yang Kai chuckled and did not insist.

Soon, the two of them reached a mountain valley about three hundred kilometres away from Ice Heart Valley. Many cabins were built in the mountain valley with numerous cultivators zipping in and out of the houses while others soared through the sky, making the place seem quite lively.

Yang Kai swept his eyes across the place and his heart sank.

Given the number of cultivators gathered in this place, once the Sect Defending Array was breached, the seven thousand disciples of Ice Heart Valley would definitely stand no chance in resisting.

Cao Xu brought Yang Kai to a tall cabin, and informed respectfully, “Elder Feng, disciple Cao Xu asks to see you.”

“Come in!” A voice came out from the inside.

Cao Xu nodded lightly at Yang Kai, then guided him to enter the house.

Inside the house, Yang Kai saw a huge Spirit Array board lying in the centre of the room. The array board seemed to be a projection, which was glittering slightly, displaying the outline of some kind of terrain.

Yang Kai glanced at it and was soon flabbergasted as he recognized that the terrain outline was actually of Ice Heart Valley. He was surprised that this unknown array board could have such an effect.

At this moment, an elderly man was whispering to another man, who then quickly turned around and left after receiving the order. The man looked like he was in a hurry.

After the departure of the man, the elderly man looked intently at the array board and sneered.
