The Eighteen Stars Grand Array reappeared in the world today so this place was destined to be visited and explored by countless Masters. Even if Yang Kai had not collected the Source Crystal lode, it would have eventually been taken away by someone else.

In other words, it was only a matter of time before the Demonic War Hammer was released.

However, Yang Kai had not expected the Demonic War Hammer to be able to retain its sentience during the countless years it had been sealed, much less assume a human form.

With a quick thought, Yang Kai changed his defensive stance to an offensive one.

“Myriad Sword Arts, Radiant Moon Swallows the Wolf!”

*Chi chi chi... *

Countless sword lights bombarded the human form Artifact Spirit like a drenching rain, beating it back and forth continuously. The Demon Qi on its surface flickered unstably, but it did not receive the slightest injury.

It was an Ancient Demonic War Hammer in human form, at least equivalent to a peak-level Emperor Artifact in terms of resilience. Yang Kai had no means to damage this opponent unless he used his Spiritual Energy to attack its consciousness.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai had just overused his Soul in collecting the Source Crystal lode, so it was difficult to utilize his Divine Sense at the moment to execute a Soul Secret Technique.

For now, he could only defend. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

As soon as the sword lights came out, Yang Kai immediately retreated in a flash to Ye Jing Han’s side, grabbing her hand and shouting, “Run!”

Just as he shouted, the two flew upwards rapidly, following the direction of the surging World Energy.

Above the eighteen Spirit Spring Eyes, the cultivators looked at each other donning ugly expressions.

“Where did the Source Crystals go? Why aren’t they coming anymore?”

“Damn it, why did the eruption of Source Crystals have to cease? What happened?”

“I don’t know what happened, the Spirit Spring Eyes just seemed to stop erupting Source Crystals.”

Many cultivators were looking around and yelling, unable to fully express their feelings with their words.

After all, this was a one in a million chance to receive free Source Crystals, not to mention they were High-Rank and Mid-Rank Source Crystals. Everyone present was experiencing a joyful harvest, but the Source Crystals giveaway just ended like this.

From the Spirit Springs now, there was nothing else but pure World Energy.

How could this not sadden everyone?

“Did something happen below?” Someone guessed.

“Should we check it out? Maybe there is some Heaven-defying opportunity waiting down there for us,” another person suggested.

There was a change in everyone’s expressions with his words.

Previously, everyone had been busy collecting Source Crystals and did not pay attention to other matters. Now that there were no more Source Crystals, they naturally wanted to go down and examine the situation. Eighteen Spirit Springs and numerous Source Crystals had suddenly appeared, so even a fool would not believe that there would be nothing good down below.

Therefore, their hearts were moved.

However, they knew that the one who took the lead usually bore the brunt of the danger, so everyone was glancing around at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move.

“Ahem... Brother Si Hai, your cultivation is worthy of respect. Why don’t you lead us down there?” An elderly man suddenly turned to another old man and asked.

The old man named Qi Shi Hai snorted coldly, “Brother Wu Hu must be joking. Why didn’t you ask this Old Master to take the lead while collecting Source Crystals just now and only thought of him when this dangerous matter came up? Are you insulting this Old Master’s intelligence or your own?”

Zhou Wu Hu gave a dry cough, “Just forget it, if Brother Si Hai is unhappy about it, you don’t have to bad-mouth me like this. Do you not rinse your mouth after eating?”

Qi Shi Hai replied coldly, “This Old Master is not stupid enough to be manipulated by others!”

Zhou Wu Hu spat disdainfully, cupped his fist and turned to the Eight Paths Sect disciples, “Little Brother Luo, this Old Master has seen your excellency’s amazing cultivation and your astonishing strength. You must be a man who is showered with great opportunities and luck. Does Little Brother Luo want to lead the exploration?”

No one had a clue of when Luo Yuan came back. Although his whole body was messy after battling with the two old men, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, he still looked energetic, as if the battle had yielded him plenty of benefits.

The few people from Flying Saint Palace had also completely disappeared at some point, perhaps scared off or forced out by Luo Yuan.

“Old man, you’re really insidious. Go down by yourself if you want, don’t instigate my Senior Brother Luo!” The round-faced woman from the Eight Paths Sect glared at Zhou Wu Hu.

Zhou Wu Hu’s face was darkened and he snorted, “Haven’t you learnt how to respect the Elders, little girl? Can’t you see this Old Master is already so old? Look at my beard and hair, they’re all white.”

The round-faced woman snorted too, “Since you’re already so old, why not just lie down somewhere and wait till your time’s up? If you keep running here and there, won’t you just die faster?”

“Little girl... you really infuriate this Old Master!” Zhou Wu Hu trembled in anger.

Qi Shi Hai was taking pleasure in his misfortune to the side, smiling happily.

“Something’s wrong!” Luo Yuan broke his silence with a single sentence, looking downwards intently into one of the High-Rank Spirit Spring Eyes, frowning, as if an enemy was approaching.

“What?” The round-faced woman turned to him after hearing him.

Luo Yuan’s face only became more solemn as time passed though, suddenly shouting, “Retreat!”

Pushing his Source Qi madly, he enveloped several disciples of Eight Paths Sect and shot backwards a thousand meters in a flash.

*Gu lu lu...*

Bubbles appeared at the centre of the High-Rank Spirit Spring, like it was boiling over.

“What happened?” Everyone looked at the Spirit Spring with a blank face.

Soon after though, a figure suddenly broke out of it, sending up a giant splash of Liquid World Energy.

“Someone already went down there?”

“When did he go down?”

“It... It’s him, that monster!”

Everyone exclaimed one after another as their faces turned ugly after seeing Yang Kai clearly. They had no idea if the sudden stop of the eruption of Source Crystals had something to do with him, and none dared to ask.

“Why did he come out from our Spirit Spring?” The round-faced woman looked at Yang Kai in confusion and frowned.

“So, that’s how it is!” Luo Yuan seemed to figure something and said, “Looks like these eighteen Spirit Springs are actually connected to each other.”

“Is that so? Senior Brother Luo is so brilliant,” the round-faced woman responded with a smile, gazing at Luo Yuan with her beautiful eyes with no intention of hiding her admiration.

The rest of the Eight Paths Sect disciples’ faces blushed with shame, knowing that their Sect’s Young Lady was completely blinded by love.

Yang Kai looked left and right as soon as he emerged, then swiftly dashed over to where Hua Qing Si and the others were.

“Master...” Liu Yan observed the bottom of the Spirit Spring Eye intently, and whispered, “I don’t know why, I suddenly have a strange feeling, that underneath, there’s...”

“En, there’s an existence similar to you,” Yang Kai quickly replied.

“It can assume human form?” Liu Yan’s tender body trembled, looking a little excited.

There were not many Artifact Spirits that could assume human form and possessed sentience. All these existences were of a similar kind, so when Liu Yan heard that there was another like herself, she naturally became enthusiastic, wondering how it assumed human form and how much sentience it had.

“It’s dangerous, don’t provoke it!” Yang Kai put Ye Jing Han down while warning, taking out a bunch of Spirit Pills from his Space Ring and stuffing them into his mouth.

*Wa la...*

Another sound was heard as the Demonic Artifact Spirit followed Yang Kai out of the Spirit Spring, a violent and gloomy aura pulsing from its erratic dark figure. Only a pair of blood-red eyes remained constant.

“Haa... Who is it this time?”

“He looks quite vicious.”

“Hahaha, looking at that monster running away, this guy seems to be quite powerful. It would be good if he could quickly finish that guy off!”

“En en, hopefully, this would involve that Eight Paths Sect brat surnamed Luo as well, then we can just sit on the mountain top and watch the tigers fight, heh heh heh...”

After the appearance of the Demonic Artifact Spirit, it still focused its attention on Yang Kai, as if he was the only one in this world it was interested in, and the others were unimportant.

It raised its hand and hastily punched towards Yang Kai.

*Chi... *

A wave of darkness that seemingly devoured all light shot forward towards Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and slightly raised his hand, summoning all the Golden Blood Thread he had been using to cover the Spirit Spring before.

*Hong... *

The dark wave hit on the golden net, causing the surrounding World Energy to tremble. The Golden Blood Threads failed to stop this attack though and collapsed in an instant.

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly as he retrieved his Golden Blood Threads and swept out with his Myriads Sword towards the remainder of the dark wave.

*Hong Hong Hong... *

The two energies collided and exploded, kicking up a gust of wind that forced everyone present back a few steps.

“He’s amazing!”

Everyone paled after seeing the skill of this Demonic Artifact Spirit. Even Luo Yuan, who was far away, narrowed his eyes slightly.

Yang Kai took out another bunch of Spirit Pills and threw them into his mouth like jelly beans. While chewing and swallowing, he called out lightly, “Brother Luo, I found you a decent opponent, do you want to give it a try?”

Luo Yuan snorted coldly, “Not interested. I successfully cultivated my Secret Technique.”

“Really!?” Yang Kai exclaimed happily, “Then you should try out your Secret Technique’s might against a strong opponent.”

“You shameless man!” The round-faced woman waved her small fist at Yang Kai from far away with gritted teeth, “Don’t try to drag Senior Brother Luo into your mess, shame on you!”

“Little girl, it’s fine to be humiliated, life is more important!” Yang Kai put on a shameless face, looking proud of himself, frustrating everyone around him.

“Never mind, never mind!” Yang Kai spat disdainfully, and continued, “Since you guys don’t want an Emperor Artifact, I’ll just subdue it myself!”

“What?”

“An Emperor Artifact?”

“Where is the Emperor Artifact?”

“Quickly give it to me, I want it! Big Brother Yang! Master Yang...”

Yang Kai grinned and pointed at the Demonic Artifact Spirit, “All of you are experienced cultivators, can’t you tell this guy isn’t a living creature?”

“What does Little Brother Yang mean?” Qi Shi Hai immediately narrowed his eyes and asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai smiled, “That’s not a human, it’s an Emperor Artifact Spirit assuming human form!”
