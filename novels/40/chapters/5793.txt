Meng Que was on the verge of death, his entire body was covered in wounds and his vitality was fading. Even if no one did anything to him, he would not last more than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. And naturally, Mo Na Ye could also see this.

Perhaps it was because he was about to die that he was making such a surprising move. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

On the other hand, although Tian Xiu Zhu and the others did not know what Meng Que was planning to do, his actions were definitely far from normal. While Tian Xiu Zhu and the others may have been oblivious, they still wanted to stop Meng Que, but how could they do anything about it when they could not even gather their strength? Three of their members had perished in the last exchange, and the three who were still alive were hanging by a breath. They had no choice but to helplessly watch Meng Que approach Mo Na Ye, shining brilliantly like the last radiance of a setting sun. He looked like he wanted to kill Mo Na Ye immediately.

And coupled with Meng Que’s furious roars, they all thought that there was some kind of irreconcilable grudge between these two; otherwise, why would Meng Que still be so indignant even on the verge of death?

In a flash, Meng Que arrived before Mo Na Ye and their eyes met. Mo Na Ye’s eyes happened to be filled with bitterness, while Meng Que’s eyes were shining brilliantly like raging fire, fueled by his last remaining life force.

The next moment, Meng Que’s body quivered as he gathered all his strength and his Black Ink Strength madly surged out. The richness and purity of that Black Ink Strength had far exceeded the norm.

In the blink of an eye, an enormous Black Ink Cloud appeared in the place where Meng Que once was and wrapped itself around Mo Na Ye before pouring into his body through his nose, mouth, and wounds like a living creature.

Subsequently, Mo Nay Ye’s fading aura began to recover at a rate visible to the naked eye. Even the hole in his chest began to slowly close up. Correspondingly, Meng Que’s aura and vitality rapidly dwindled.

“Damn it!” Tian Xiu Zhu cursed through his teeth. After seeing this, how could he not tell that Meng Que was not trying to harm Mo Na Ye, but was instead trying to heal him?

Although he had no idea what kind of profound Secret Technique Meng Que had used, it was an undeniable fact that Mo Na Ye was recovering.

Never had this Secret Technique appeared before, nor had the Humans ever seen it, so no one had been on guard against Meng Que’s actions before his death. Furthermore, no one had any strength to stop him either.

After sparing no effort, Yang Kai finally critically wounded Mo Na Ye, but if the latter were to recover, all previous efforts would go down the drain.

Tian Xiu Zhu grit his teeth and gathered his strength, wanting to stop Meng Que; however, as soon as he circulated his strength, his face turned pale and his mind went blank.

The previous battle had exhausted all his Small Universe’s strength, so now when he forcefully tried mustering it, his Small Universe immediately became unstable.

At this moment, Tian Xiu Zhu no longer had any strength left to fight, and the other two Eighth-Order Masters were in even more precarious states; after all, the foundation of a veteran Eighth-Order Master like Tian Xiu Zhu was still sturdier than that of the new generation Eighth-Order Masters.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai too wanted to stop it after seeing this, but he too was powerless to do anything. His Dao Strengths was left in extreme disarray after his Dragon Bead attack had blown open a hole in the Space-Time River. As such, he needed to quickly stabilize it.

A short while later, the Black Ink Cloud around Mo Na Ye finally disappeared, but Meng Que’s figure was nowhere to be seen. It was as if this Pseudo-Royal Lord had poured all of his energy into Mo Na Ye’s body before his death, helping him heal and recover.

Mo Na Ye had indeed recovered a little and many of his wounds had healed, but it was far from enough. Mo Na Ye was a Royal Lord now, so the more serious his injuries were, the harder it was for him to recover. The infusion of a dying Pseudo-Royal Lord’s essence could do nothing about it.

If he wanted to recover completely, he would need the infusion of the Source of all the Pseudo-Royal Lords present here. But this type of infusion could only be used voluntarily, and why would these Pseudo-Royal Lords voluntarily kill themselves?

Meng Que’s act of coming to his aid at the last moment already came as a surprise to Mo Na Ye; after all, they had never been on good terms.

For that reason, Meng Que’s last words seemed to echo so loudly in his ears.

[Live, you must live on! The Black Ink Clan is too stupid and ignorant, only by living can you finally help the Supreme One complete its grand plan!]

Mo Na Ye suddenly realized that he had been underestimating Meng Que all along. The reckless arrogance Meng Que had displayed before him might have just been a front.

[I misjudged him!]

Mo Na Ye silently mocked himself.

Suddenly, ripples appeared in the Void as Yang Kai furiously shouted, “Mo Na Ye, today you die!”

Mo Na Ye, who had just recovered a little, immediately looked up, only to see Yang Kai hastily stabilizing his mind and his Dao Strengths before charging straight at him with his spear.

Mo Na Ye’s heart was filled with bitterness, knowing that he had failed to live up to Meng Que’s expectations.

Against someone like Yang Kai, if he couldn’t defeat him, the only thing that awaited him next was death! As for escaping, it was naturally impossible to do so against a Master of the Dao of Space.

Yang Kai escaped from the pursuit of the Black Ink Clan many times, the reverse had never happened.

Since there was no way out, Mo Na Ye had no choice but to fight!

If Meng Que was willing to sacrifice himself, so why could he not?

“Yang Kai!” Mo Na Ye furiously roared, grinding his teeth. He did not retreat this time, but rather took the initiative to charge Yang Kai.

The two clashed again.

In the last confrontation, Yang Kai had the absolute upper hand. He even managed to fatally injure Mo Na Ye using his Dragon Bead. Although Meng Que had used a Secret Technique to help Mo Na Ye steady himself, this kind of injury could not be so easily healed.

So, when they were locked in another round of confrontation, Mo Na Ye was still no match for Yang Kai. Had he not recovered a little thanks to Meng Que’s help, he would have died within five moves.

It was only because of Meng Que’s sacrifice that Mo Na Ye was able to even fight back against Yang Kai.

Various Daos Strengths converged and merged, while Black Ink Strength fiercely surged as the two figures clashed with each other. They flew around the void, attacking each other with deadly intent.

Every clash would leave them injured, splashing their Golden and Black blood everywhere!

After an extremely fierce collision, the two figures respectively flew backward.

Yang Kai quickly came to a stop and stood completely still. His face kept distorting with various expressions as if something was terribly wrong.

Mo Na Ye, on the other hand, flew far away, tumbling many times through the void. After he somehow stabilized himself, he spurted a mouthful of black blood. Immediately afterwards, he looked in Yang Kai’s direction, seemingly sensing something.

He did not know whether it was all an illusion, but he felt that Yang Kai’s strength was unstable at the moment!

Regardless of whether it was an illusion or not, the fact was that Mo Na Ye was on the verge of dying again. Regardless of what happened to Yang Kai, he would definitely end up dead if the fight continued.

Meng Que’s last words once again echoed in his ears.

[Live, you must live on!]

It was indeed difficult to escape before someone proficient in the Dao of Space, but how would he know if he didn’t even try? He wasn’t someone who was afraid of death, but how could he be willing to die when the Black Ink Clan’s great task of unifying the 3,000 Worlds was still not complete?

He wanted to live not for himself, but for the Black Ink Clan’s grand ambition!

Having made his mind, Mo Na Ye instantly turned around and fled.

“You want to run!? In your dreams!” Yang Kai grit his teeth and shouted when he saw Mo Na Ye flee. He promptly activated his Space Secret Technique to chase after him.

But right then, the entire Universe Furnace World suddenly started quaking as another Grand Dao evolution took place.

The Grand Dao of the Universe Furnace had evolved many times already, and with each evolution, the chaotic Shattered Dao Essence that filled the Universe Furnace World disappeared, replaced by order and stability.

At the same time the Grand Dao started evolving, everything suddenly went blurry before Yang Kai, making it impossible for him to pursue Mo Na Ye. It was only after a short while that he could finally see clearly again.

The Grand Dao evolution had also come to an end by then.

However, Yang Kai still appeared to be in a daze. He stood in his place, looking around, exclaiming, “What’s going on?”

This question left members of both the Human Race and the Black Ink Clan confused.

Ou Yang Lie even more anxiously shouted, “Quickly kill Mo Na Ye!”

This was a rare opportunity. If they let Mo Na Ye escape this time, it would be difficult to find him again. Right now, Mo Na Ye was not just an intelligent commander of the Black Ink Clan, but also a true Royal Lord. He was a massive threat to the Human Race!

What was Yang Kai hesitating about? This was a good opportunity to cut weeds and pull out roots!

Yang Kai remained dazed for a moment before immediately releasing his Divine Sense. After sensing the direction of Mo Na Ye’s escape, he promptly gave chase.

Ou Yang Lie finally breathed a sigh of relief.

However, Yang Kai soon returned with the Azure Dragon Spear in hand, and a helpless look on his face. He kept moving his joints from time to time, raising his arms and legs as if he were very uncomfortable.

“Is he dead?” Ou Yang Lie hurriedly asked, finding it very strange that he had not sensed Mo Na Ye’s fall. Even if he had escaped far away, it was still impossible for a Royal Lord to die without any sound or disturbance.

“I couldn’t catch up!” Yang Kai angrily lashed out.

[Couldn’t catch up!?]

Ou Yang Lie simply thought that he heard it wrong, [How could you not catch up? How could anyone escape from you? What the Hell is wrong?]

Ou Yang Lie tightly furrowed his brow. He instinctively felt that something was off. If he was not so familiar with Yang Kai, he would have thought someone was pretending to be him.

But after carefully observing him, he felt that the current Yang Kai was indeed a little different from the one he was familiar with…

As for what was different about him, he could not put his finger on it.

In any case, he did not have much time to think about it now, so Ou Yang Lie just shouted, “Then let’s kill this one!”

It was a pity Mo Na Ye had escaped, but another Royal Lord was still present; killing him would also be a big haul. Thanks to the appearance of the Universe Furnace, the Black Ink Clan had managed to gain two Royal Lords. One of them might have escaped with serious injuries, but they could not let the other one run away as well.

“Fine, fine!” Yang Kai lifted his Azure Dragon Spear and waddled towards the battlefield like a penguin.

“Something’s wrong!” Elsewhere, Yang Xiao, who was leading a Six Paths Formation to fight a Pseudo-Royal Lord, had also noticed this. Although he had not spent much time with Yang Kai, the latter was still his Adoptive Father. As such, Yang Xiao was quite familiar with him.

At this moment, his Adoptive Father gave him a very strange feeling, as if he was a completely different person…

“What’s wrong?” Blood Crow asked casually.

“I think that’s not my Adoptive Father!” Yang Xiao frowned.

Blood Crow sneered, “If that’s not your Adoptive Father, who else could it be?” His Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm aura was unmistakable. How could anyone pretend to be Yang Kai down to the most minute details and even carry the Azure Dragon Spear?

If someone could imitate another to the point that he was absolutely indistinguishable from the original, it would be truly shocking.
