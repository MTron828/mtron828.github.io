The woman was simple-minded and guileless, but she was obstinate.

The last wish of the child’s Father was of utmost importance to her in her heart, so she would never dare to disobey him; therefore, despite knowing that the old man was right, and that Senior Void sincerely wanted the child to have a bright future, the Liu Cai Xia still wouldn’t change her mind.

If the child’s Father was still alive, they could’ve reasoned with him; however, he was now dead, so it wasn’t like they could dig up his grave and ask him. Furthermore, the corpse wouldn’t respond to them even if they did.

There was a helpless smile on Yang Kai’s face as he gazed at Yu Chang Dao, “Martial Uncle, I don’t think it’s appropriate to force her to do something against her will. Why don’t you look for a different Disciple? Even though there are not a lot of people in the Star Boundary, there are definitely many talented youths. Perhaps you’ll find a more suitable candidate.”

Yu Chang Dao shook his head, “It’s extremely difficult to find anyone with the Innate Dao Body. This Old Master has travelled to countless Universe Worlds before, but never met another child like him. I don’t think I can find another in this lifetime.”

“What should we do, then?” Yang Kai appeared to be having a headache as he patted the child in his arms, “I can’t go against the will of the child’s Father. It’s his last wish after all.”

Yu Chang Dao pressed his lips together, then let out a long sigh. If he knew this would be the outcome, he would’ve directly brought the child back to Free and Unfettered Paradise, skipping over all this nonsense. He initially thought that by bringing them here and making Yang Kai negotiate, he could easily take on the child as a Disciple. It never crossed his mind that things would come to such a point. The impasse made him vexed.

Yang Kai suggested by saying, “Martial Uncle, why don’t you stay in the Star Boundary for a while longer and spend more time with the child? When the child grows up, you can ask him whether he’ll be interested in becoming your disciple.”

Yu Chang Dao’s eyes brightened.

Liu Cai Xia immediately objected in her small voice though, “When the child grows up, he’ll still have to join High Heaven Palace.”

“You!” Yu Chang Dao was so exasperated that he almost spat blood.

Liu Cai Xia hung her head low and clenched the hem of her shirt, “If he can’t join High Heaven Palace, he’ll not cultivate.” Then, she stood up and was clearly ready to take the child back from Yang Kai. It seemed that she was determined to return home.

Yang Kai hurriedly stopped her by saying, “Good, I’ll let him join High Heaven Palace right now. From now on, he’s a Disciple of High Heaven Palace.”

Liu Cai Xia’s hands froze in mid-air, then her eyes widened as she was in a dazed state before she became ecstatic. With her eyes reddening, she replied gratefully, “Many thanks, Senior Void. This child’s Father can finally rest in peace now.”

“Martial Nephew!” Yu Chang Dao stared angrily at Yang Kai, “H-How can you do such a thing?”

Yang Kai was basically stealing his Disciple from him, right in front of his face no less. He initially had a good impression of Yang Kai because of Xu Ling Gong, but he no longer felt that way. By snatching his Disciple from him, Yang Kai was practically breaking off his legacy. This was a feud that was second only to if someone killed his Father or snatched his Wife.

Yang Kai pretended to not hear him though as he said to Hua Qing Si, “Look for a quiet place in the palace and help them settle down.”

He then turned to look at Liu Cai Xia, “The child is still young, so you’ll still have to take care of him. You can stay here with peace of mind. Your child will start cultivating when he’s a little older.”

Liu Cai Xia was naturally grateful. She knew that she no longer had to live a life of poverty thanks to her child.

Yang Kai then asked her if there was anyone else in her family that had to be informed about this matter. Upon learning that her child was her only remaining family, he was relieved that there would be no further trouble.

After Hua Qing Si left the hall alongside Liu Cai Xia and her child, Yang Kai turned to look at Yu Chang Dao and bowed, “Martial Uncle Yu!”

Yu Chang Dao sported a long face as he rose from the chair and swung his sleeve, “Old friend Xu, this Old Master still has other matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave now.”

He then prepared to depart. It took him a painfully long time before he found a suitable Disciple, only to have him snatched away by Yang Kai. That was why he was vexed. He decided that when Yang Kai wasn’t paying attention, he would abduct the woman and the child back to Free and Unfettered Paradise. He reckoned that Yang Kai wouldn’t dare to barge into his Sect and get them back.

He would never let go of this Disciple.

While Xu Ling Gong remained silent, Yang Kai stood in Yu Chang Dao path and put on a fawning smile, “Please forgive me, Martial Uncle. I had no choice but to do things this way.”

Yu Chang Dao glowered at him, “Just because you didn’t have a choice, it didn’t mean you could snatch my Disciple. Stand aside, or else don’t blame this Old Master for being impolite!”

A nonchalant Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Doesn’t Martial Uncle Yu understand that I was simply retreating in order to advance?”

Yu Chang Dao frowned and looked at him doubtfully.

Xu Ling Gong gently comforted from the side, “Although this brat acts recklessly sometimes, he isn’t a mannerless brute. He must have his own reason for doing what he did. Why don’t you have a seat and listen to his explanation? It’d be best if he could explain himself. If he can’t, you can beat him up to vent out your anger. He won’t dare to resist.”

Yu Chang Dao snorted, “He’s a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, so I wouldn’t dare to teach him a lesson without your permission!” If he really made a move, Xu Ling Gong would certainly interfere.

Xu Ling Gong chuckled, “Then I’ll beat him up on your behalf. I’ve never been fond of him anyway.”

There was a bitter expression on Yang Kai’s face, “You wound me deeply, Martial Uncle Xu.”

In response, Xu Ling Gong just chuckled.

It was only after some more placating that Yu Chang Dao took a seat and examined Yang Kai.

After measuring his words, Yang Kai said, “As you are well aware, Martial Uncle, the child’s Mother is incredibly obstinate. The child’s Father left behind only one final wish before he passed away, so as long as she lives, she will not disregard it. Regardless of how great the outside world is, the child has to enter High Heaven Palace, unless you have a way to retrieve the soul of the child’s Father back from the Yellow Springs and get him to change his mind.”

With a dark expression, Yu Chang Dao fell silent.

Yang Kai chuckled, “En, even though the child has joined High Heaven Palace though, it doesn’t mean you can’t be his Master.”

Yu Chang Dao arched his brow, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai deliberately swung his sleeves as though he had come up with a perfect solution, “I have a suggestion. If Martial Uncle Yu agrees to it, you can take the child on as a Disciple immediately. This way, the last wish of the child’s Father will be fulfilled, and Martial Uncle Yu will be able to accept your favoured Disciple. It’s the best of both worlds.”

“Oh?” Yu Chang Dao’s interest had been piqued as his expression turned milder, “And how would you suggest we go about implementing this best of both worlds solution?”

Yang Kai swung his sleeves again and bent his back, “As Palace Master of High Heaven Palace, I would like to formally invite Martial Uncle Yu to serve as a Supreme High-Rank Guest Elder.”

Xu Ling Gong, who was fiddling with his tea cup, immediately froze in place. He looked up at Yang Kai with an expression which suggested he already knew that the latter was up to no good.

Behind him, Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue widened their mouths and stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

[H-How did he have the nerve to come up with such a suggestion?] A Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was extremely powerful, so how did a Sect of a Universe World have the right to invite him to be a Supreme High-Rank Guest Elder, which was just a useless title?

It had to be noted that people like Yu Chang Dao were mostly Inner Elders of the Cave Heavens and Paradises. They usually wouldn’t be interested in becoming the Supreme High-Rank Guest Elders of great forces like Void Land, much less a mere High Heaven Palace.

Yu Chang Dao was startled for a moment before he broke into laughter, as though he had just heard the funniest joke. Soon after though, he fell silent with a solemn expression. Then, he knocked on the table and nodded, “En, it’s actually a feasible solution.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue turned to look at him in disbelief.

An elated Yang Kai asked, “So you agree to it, Martial Uncle?”

Yu Chang Dao didn’t immediately respond to him, and after a moment of silence, he replied, “I’ll have to think about it.”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “There’s no rush. You’ll have plenty of time to ponder on it. Why don’t you stay in High Heaven Palace for a while to think about it?”

Yu Chang Dao nodded, “Good, I’ll take a look at the child now.”

“I’ll lead the way for you,” Yang Kai offered.

However, Yu Chang Dao waved his hand and said, “There’s no need. I can find my own way.”

The next moment, he disappeared from the spot. His anxiety showed that he truly cared about the child.

Yang Kai let out a breath of relief, but when he turned his head, he saw Xu Ling Gong smiling faintly at him.

“Please have some tea, Martial Uncle Xu,” Yang Kai said.

Xu Ling Gong chuckled, “You’ve dug a nice pit there, kid. Old Yu will be willing to jump right into it.”

An aggrieved Yang Kai said, “You’ve got me all wrong, Martial Uncle Xu. I just want to fulfill the last wish of the child’s Father.”

“Stop spouting nonsense!” Xu Ling Gong snorted, “Maybe you initially didn’t have such intentions, but would you dare to say you didn’t have an ulterior motive after seeing the attitudes of that woman and Old Yu?”

Yang Kai directly sat down on a chair beside him and tilted his figure before saying in a hushed voice, “Even though you’ve seen through me, it’d be terrible if you point it out. Don’t you agree, Martial Uncle Xu?”

Xu Ling Gong grinned in a devious manner.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue looked at them in a way as though they were two foxes, grinning slyly.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai appeared worried, “Do you think it will work?”

Xu Ling Gong stroked his chin and said, “You’ll most likely succeed. Old Yu has been looking for a suitable Legacy Disciple for many years, but to no avail. However, he’s found one here, so there’s no way he’ll let the child go. If he wants to take the child on as a Disciple, he’ll have to become a Supreme High-Rank Guest Elder of High Heaven Palace; otherwise, he won’t have the right to accept the child as his Disciple. You’re such a cunning brat. By using that baby, you’ve managed to bind a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to your Sect. It’s such a steal. Moreover, when the child grows up, he’ll still be a Disciple of High Heaven Palace. Old Yu is practically going to train a disciple for you for free. It’s no wonder that even though it’s been a short time since you started cultivating, you’ve managed to build such an influential Sect. I suppose you’ve managed to deceive many people over the years.”

There was a solemn expression on Yang Kai’s face, “You’ve got me wrong, Martial Uncle Xu. I’ve managed to build such a Sect because of my natural charm and charisma, not because of anything else.”

Xu Ling Gong didn’t play along as he snorted, “However, Old Yu has lived for a long time, he may be temporarily fooled by you, but it doesn’t mean he will be blind to it forever. In fact, it’s quite likely he’s already seen through you, but he just didn’t bother to expose it.”

Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, “Senior experts like you two are undoubtedly insightful and intelligent; Juniors like me are no match for you. I’ve taken some slight advantage because I’m young and weak.”

“Stop your useless flattery!” Xu Ling Gong landed a slap on Yang Kai’s shoulder, which forced the latter to lower his figure slightly, “Old Yu has gotten some benefits, but what about me, boy? You’re a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, so you can’t just give all the benefits to the outsiders. You have to be fair to us.”

Yang Kai hurriedly replied, “Of course. That’s the reason I asked Senior Brother Qing to invite you over.”

Xu Ling Gong put on a faint smile, “You’re indeed a promising young man.”
