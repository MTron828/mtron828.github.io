The World Principles of the Revolving World cycled back and forth between being biased towards the Star Boundary and the Demon Realm. There was no pattern to it at all and the reason was that the Revolving World sat in the Void Crack between these two Great Worlds, wandering randomly. It would constantly move between the spheres of influence of these two Great Worlds, and depending on which Great World it was overlapping with, the World Principles would be thus affected.

However, there would be some very obvious natural signs when the World Principles were about to shift. The Human Race of Human Imperial City relied on this to avoid danger.

With the pills distributed by Yang Kai, the speed of recovery of the Demon Kings was indeed a lot faster, but it still couldn’t satisfy the black puppy’s appetite.

Now, Yang Kai could only pin his hopes on the Revolving World’s shifting World Principles.

The wait lasted for half a month.

In this half month, every Demon King and Demon Great General of Demon Fury City had basically undergone ten rounds being drained by the black puppy, only to recover then push their Demon Qi again to let the black puppy feed once more.

No Master could withstand this kind of suffering, not even Yang Kai, so after half a month, all the Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals’ faces had turned grey and were filled with Death Qi, as if their end was nigh and they could die at any moment. Some of the Demon Kings and Demon Great Generals’ cultivations had even regressed and it was unknown if they could ever recover their original strength.

They simply couldn’t carry on, but if they could have escaped, they would have done so long ago. There was an Exotic Monster like the Abyssal Returner, two Dragon Clan members guarding the surroundings, and Yang Kai, who was keeping a close watch on them. How could they escape?

They too were looking forward to World Principles changing.

After half a day, the World Principles began to shift. A reverberating thunderclap-like sound rang out, making the Demon Race members, who had been suffering these days, tear up and cheer in excitement.

After a tremble, the ambient World Energy started to undergo some subtle changes.

Li Jiao came up to Yang Kai’s side and begged, wearing a sad face, “Palace Master Yang, help me.”

“What’s wrong?”

Li Jiao replied, “This Li was corroded by Demon Qi, and these days, the Demon Essence has been steadily growing. It has been very hard to hold on to my sanity. The World Principles are about to change, and if I don’t find a place to hide, I’m afraid I would really undergo demonification.”

Last time, when he wandered with Zhu Lie outside, the World Principles had shifted in favour of the Demon Realm, and without a place to take shelter, he had been invaded by Demon Qi. Li Jiao had been relying on his powerful cultivation to suppress the Demon Essence which had taken root in his body so far, but now, the World Principles were about to change again and flood the air with Demon Qi.

In his current state, it was simply impossible for him to survive. He would definitely be completely overwhelmed by the Demon Essence and become a Demon.

“Then find a place to hide, why are you asking me to save you?” Yang Kai asked with a grin.

Li Jiao replied, wearing a sad look, “But I don’t know where to go. I heard Palace Master Yang mention that there is a place called Human Imperial City. I wonder…”

“Don’t even think about going to Human Imperial City. Although it’s not far from here, you won’t get there in time.”

Li Jiao was struck with panic immediately after hearing this, “Then what do you suggest?”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and spread his hands as he replied, “If you want to save yourself, you have to rely on your own ability.”

Li Jiao’s face turned black and was on the verge of crying as he protested, “Palace Master Yang, you can’t just sit back and watch me die! This Li only came here because of you.”

Yang Kai simply replied, “If I could save you, I would have, but now, I too can’t do anything.”

Li Jiao’s expression involuntarily turned unsightly. Out of everyone present here, the two Dragon Clan members shouldn’t have to be worried about being invaded by the Demon Qi; after all, their Divine Spirit physique and Dragon Blood possessed strong resistance towards Demon Qi. Not to mention the change in World Principles, even if they were thrown into the Demon Realm itself, they were unlikely to be concerned.

Yang Kai couldn’t be regarded as ordinary either. Although Li Jiao had no idea why Yang Kai was confident that he would remain safe and sound, judging by his current lax attitude, Li Jiao knew that he must have a way.

Li Jiao was a little angry, thinking that Yang Kai was treasuring his own skin, but was unwilling to help him.

“Didn’t I show you the way before? What can I do when you don’t cherish it?”

Li Jiao quickly rebuffed, “Palace Master Yang, don’t be ridiculous. While getting blood from the Dragon Clan was something you suggested, if this Li brought it up, his fate would be even more miserable.”

“You’re about to be demonified, so what could be worse?”

“Palace Master Yang, are you really going to sit back and watch me die?” A malevolent aura slowly crept up on Li Jiao’s face as swirling black Qi surrounded his body; anger and wicked thoughts were growing in his heart, strengthening his Demon Essence a lot, especially at this moment when the World Energy had begun to infuse with Demon Qi, which was now even affecting his mind.

Yang Kia looked at him with a sneer, “Now you’re trying to blame me?”

“Damn you!” Li Jian couldn’t stand it and a hideous look appeared on his face as he shouted, grinding his teeth in rage, “If it weren’t for you, how would this Li be trapped here? Since you are so cold-hearted, then don’t blame this Li for not giving you face!”

Just as he said this, the black Qi around him swirled as his eyes turned red. His head moved left and right before it suddenly transformed into the enormous head of a flood dragon, fiercely biting at Yang Kai.

Having been invaded by Demon Qi, Li Jiao had been incomparably vexed these past few days, and now, after having been antagonized by Yang Kai so much, he finally couldn’t maintain a hold on his sanity. The repressed Demon Essence suddenly erupted, instantly demonising him.

“You dare to act presumptuously in front of me? Li Jiao, your courage isn’t small.”

Facing Li Jiao’s anger-filled attack, Yang Kai only chuckled and pushed his Golden Divine Dragon Source Strength before raising his hand and pointing at Li Jiao’s forehead.

A wisp of golden glow emerged from his fingertip. The golden glow wasn’t that bright, but Li Jiao acted as if it was his ultimate nemesis. He screamed in horror as the enormous flood dragon head shrank back to its original size. The Emperor Qi instantly stopped circulating and he felt as if he was on the brink of suffocating.

The fingertip pointed on his forehead shocked Li Jiao as a sliver of clarity returned to his eyes.

He was horrified after regaining his senses. He had never thought he would actually attack Yang Kai and realized his actions were a result of the Demon Essence erupting, not his own intention, but who knew whether Yang Kai would spare him or not.

His cultivation was indeed two Minor Realms higher than Yang Kai’s, but under the effects of bloodline suppression, this gap provided him with no advantage at all. If Yang Kai wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as crushing an ant underfoot; Li Jiao didn’t have the slightest chance to resist.

This was the sorrow of Dragon Clan descendants. The bloodline of the Dragon Clan descendants indeed allowed him to walk farther and stand higher than almost all others, with his current Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation as the proof itself. Without his Dragon Clan bloodline, Li Jiao would never have reached such high cultivation.

But before an opponent with a purer Dragon Clan bloodline, more often than not, one’s cultivation was secondary, the power of one’s bloodline was the most important factor.

His back was immediately drenched in a cold sweat as he hurriedly begged, “Palace Master Yang, I was wrong, please show mercy!”

Yang Kai just chuckled and completely ignored him, as if he really wanted to finish him off.

Li Jiao’s face turned ashen as he secretly thought that his end had come.

[My Fire Dragon Palace, my beautiful wives and concubines, what will happen to them? Who will enjoy them when I am gone?]

All kinds of random thoughts flashed in his mind, but even after some time, he didn’t see the gates of Hell. Yang Kai’s finger was still pointed at his forehead, but it was devoid of any murderous intent; instead, a joking look filled his face.

Suddenly, Li Jiao felt the aura around Yang Kai’s body undergo a tremendous change, one that had an ancient and desolate feel to it.

A reverberating and solemn chant sounded as a brilliance bloomed from Yang Kai’s fingertip, enveloping Li Jiao.

The next moment, Li Jiao’s figure jolted as if all the joints in his body cracked. His already tall figure doubled in size as fierce and surging Blood Qi broke out from his body, attacking the Demon Qi inside and outside his form.

Li Jiao was stunned on the spot. He might not know what Yang Kai had done to him, but he could clearly tell that his strength had improved greatly. Furthermore, extremely belligerent and blood-thirsty thoughts were mysteriously rising in his heart. Although these thoughts were giving him discomfort, they were also weakening the effect of Demon Essence on him, allowing him to maintain a strange lucid state.

Li Jiao now looked like he was filled with two coloured lights, one was black Demon Qi and the other was a crimson Blood Qi. The red and black colours were tumbling against each other, giving an extremely strange appearance.

“This…” Li Jiao couldn’t help but begin to ask. At this moment, he knew that Yang Kai had no intention of killing him. The reason for doing this might be to help him, it was just that he hadn’t figured this out, but since Yang Kai could do this, why didn’t he do it earlier? Why toy with and aggravate his condition?

“Ancient Bloodlust Spell!” Yang Kai slightly smiled, “It has a strong effect on the Demon Qi that has invaded Humans. The Shamans of ancient times used this method to save their clansmen, but today’s World Principles are somewhat different from that time. It’s not difficult to get rid of Demon Qi in your body, but it’s troublesome to root out the Demon Essence completely. The best method would be to allow that Demon Essence to completely erupt, only then could it be eliminated once and for all. Otherwise, some hidden dangers might be left behind. You don’t wish to experience cultivation dissonance while in seclusion in the future, do you?”

Li Jiao looked at Yang Kai and asked with an impressed look on his face, “So that’s why Palace Master Yang has been ignoring me these days, deliberately leaving me hanging, even trying to aggravate my condition?”

If not for this, the Demon Essence in his body would not have erupted so quickly.

Yang Kai nodded, “Since we came in together, we must leave together. Not to mention, your Fire Dragon Palace still owes me a lot of Source Crystals, so I can’t have you dying here.”

“Palace Master Yang Kai, this Li has firmly engraved your grace in his heart!” Li Jiao was completely excited. Originally, he thought that he would die today, but things had suddenly turned around. Not only did he have the hope of surviving, but he wouldn’t have to worry about possible sequela.

“Don’t get too excited yet. As I said, the current World Principles are different from the ancient times, and so are the people living under those World Principles. This method was useful for the ancient Humans, but I don’t know how effective it will be for you. Be extremely careful when cultivating in the future.

“Yes, yes, yes, this Li will certainly be careful!” Li Jiao nodded without hesitation.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression changed as he changed the incantation before raising his hand and patting Li Jiao, “Demon Suppression!”

Under his pat, the Demon Qi surging around Li Jiao seemed to have been suppressed by something and stagnated.
