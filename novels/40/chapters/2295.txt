“Young Lady Ye, please don’t embarrass me. I’m just following orders,” Si Ming said solemnly with a smile plastered on his face, “If you enter the city without registering then the City Lord will condemn me upon getting wind of this, and I won’t be able to take responsibility for this.”

“Fine, fine,” Ye Jing Han couldn’t bear this any longer and she was so infuriated that she broke into laughter, “Sky Crane City, I’ll bear this in mind. We aren’t so adamant about entering the city. Senior Brother, let’s leave.”

Upon hearing her, Si Ming didn’t get flustered, but rather, his smile turned wider.

Ye Jing Han had already turned around, as if she would really leave, but Du Xian suddenly held her arm and shook his head at her, asking her to calm down.

Luo Jin’s wedding was just a normal celebration, but it had great significance as all factions within a hundred thousand kilometres would attend it, and if the members of Thousand Leaves Sect left, it would be an open insult to Sky Crane City, giving them the perfect excuse to have a fallout with Thousand Leaves Sect.

This was the reason why Ye Hen had admonished and urged Du Xian and his companions before they left to bear any hardships and insults they might face during their trip.

Du Xian was a mature and worldly individual, so upon seeing Si Ming’s delighted smile, he realized right away that all of this was a trap set out for them. Si Ming probably wanted to send back the members of Thousand Leaves Sect to fan the flames of conflict between Sky Crane City and their Sect.

Upon realizing this, Du Xian resolved himself to thwart his plans. He just pulled Ye Jing Han and moved his lips, sending a message directly to her ear.

Ye Jing Han had been gnashing her teeth out of fury, while her chest heaved up and down, but upon hearing Du Xian’s words, she quieted for a moment then nodded.

Du Xian revealed a smile and cupped his fists then said, “Elder Si Ming, we just have to register, don’t we?”

Si Ming furrowed his brows and replied, “That’s right!”

“Then isn’t it quite simple?” Du Xian nodded and walked toward the scarlet registration paper next to him and wrote his name, as well as his Sect’s name.

Under his lead, the other disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect followed suit, even though they were all irritated and angry.

The disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect quickly discovered an infuriating matter. Only the members of some weak families and third-class Sects had written their names on this registrar. Any faction with a little bit of influence didn’t have to do so, with their Thousand Leaves Sect as the sole exception to this rule.

In other words, they were placing the Thousand Leaves Sect at the same level as those weak families and Sects.

The members of Thousand Leaves Sect were all infuriated, but they could only bear this in silence.

Soon the registration process was finished.

When it was Yang Kai’s turn, Ye Jing Han’s pretty eyes flickered and she looked at him in worry, yet she quickly noticed that he just went to the table obediently and wrote his name with the brush.

Upon seeing this, she let out a sigh of relief. She was afraid that Yang Kai wouldn’t cooperate and would just leave in a huff.

“Wait!” Si Ming shouted and looked at Yang Kai with his ardent gaze, sizing him up before asking, “Friend, you have an unfamiliar face. Are you also a disciple of Thousand Leaves Sect?”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “That’s right!”

Si Ming snorted coldly, “Friend, you should give this more thought before replying. Our Sky Crane City is now heavily guarded, so if you want to use the Thousand Leaves Sect’s name to sneak into the city, then we must have a little chat.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and spoke with a smile, “Elder Si Ming, why are you so sure that I’m not a member of Thousand Leaves Sect? Can you recognize all members of the Thousand Leaves Sect?”

Si Ming replied, “I don’t dare to claim that I know all of them, but I have still seen most of them, especially those with a cultivation such as yours.”

Yang Kai said curiously, “Is that so? Since you recognize most people with my level of cultivation, then how did you fail to recognize Senior Brother Du Xian? Brother Du is our Sect’s Eldest Senior Brother, so how could you not recognize him?”

Du Xian next to them sneered, “I’m also curious about this as well. I may not have been friends with Elder Si Ming in the past, but I have still chatted with you once or twice, so how could you act like you didn’t recognize me just now?”

Si Ming let out a light cough and wiped off the sweat on his forehead before explaining, “I simply didn’t get a clear look of you a while ago.”

“Elder Si Ming, it looks like you have gotten a serious eye ailment. You must treat quickly, or you won’t be in this world for long,” Du Xian spoke mockingly.

Si Ming’s expression changed, “But your clothes don’t have the Thousand Leaves Sect’s symbol. How can you explain this?”

“I changed into a new set of clothes for the City Lord’s wedding and have yet to embroider the Sect’s symbol on it,” Yang Kai grinned and lied without a single pause.

“I’m afraid this explanation is... Far from satisfactory!” Si Ming sneered coldly in response.

“Si Ming, what are you implying?” Ye Jing Han had discerned that Si Ming didn’t plan to let go of Yang Kai and she couldn’t help becoming anxious. She had invited Yang Kai to repair the World Crossing Space Array, which was a critical matter that might even help Thousand Leaves Sect rise up once again, so she attached the utmost importance to Yang Kai.

Moreover, Yang Kai, just as an individual, was extremely strong so if he flew into a rage, then the city gates would be dyed in blood. That was why Ye Jing Han quickly stood up for him and glared at Si Ming aggressively, “Since we arrived, you have targeted us repeatedly, do you think it’s so easy to bully our Thousand Leaves Sect? We have come to congratulate Luo Jin, yet you obstructed our way here and intentionally embarrassed us. If we leave right now, then none will be able to blame our Thousand Leaves Sect as it is clearly your Sky Crane City that has slighted its guests.”

Si Ming furrowed his brows and wondered why Ye Jing Han got so angry. Even when he tried to embarrass Du Xian and the others, she didn’t get so irritated, yet she had now directly called the City Lord’s great name without an ounce of respect. She had obviously lost all patience.

As this thought ran across his mind, Si Ming smiled sheepishly, “Young Miss Ye, please calm down, I was just upholding my duty with caution and I just wanted to have a little chat with this little friend.”

“If you don’t allow us to pass, then we’ll immediately leave. I’ll give you three breaths, the decision is yours!” Ye Jing Han glared at Si Ming coldly with a stern look.

Si Ming’s expression changed. He really hoped for the members of the Thousand Leaves Sect to just leave, as he could use it as an excuse to break off all relations between Sky Crane City and the Thousand Leaves Sect and annex its numerous industries in the city, but he suddenly felt that something was amiss and his instincts were telling him that having a falling-out with them right now would result in something terrible befalling him.

This stranger sent a shiver up his back!

“I was just wondering who is so arrogant and aggressive, it turns out it was Ye’er.”

At this moment, a voice drifted over from afar as a streak of light flew over and landed nearby, revealing two old and one young man.

The two old men were both Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters and they wore composed and restrained expressions on their faces. As for the youth, he looked like he was in his thirties and was a First-Order of the Dao Source Realm. He was a handsome young man with rosy lips, pearly white teeth, and a folding fan in his hand. As he stood there fanning himself, he looked quite graceful and elegant.

“Qiu Yu!” Upon seeing this person, Du Xian’s expression turned grave, as if this young man had some exceptional background. On top of that, it also looked like Du Xian was pretty displeased by the way Qiu Yu addressed Ye Jing Han.

Qiu Yu’s expression turned cold as he gazed at Du Xian and said, “My noble name is not something the likes of you can utter, slap him!”

After he said so, all cultivators outside the city widened their mouths with a shocked look on their faces.

After all, Du Xian was a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, yet Qiu Yu planned to slap him just for uttering his name. If Du Xian really suffered such an insult here, his Martial Heart might crumble and he wouldn’t have the face to see people in the future.

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the disciples of Thousand Leaves Sect changed and they all openly began pushing their Source Qi, preparing to fight.

But, before the crowd could get over their shock, Qiu Yu laughed loudly and said, “I’m just joking. Brother Du, don’t be so nervous!”

Du Xian’s expression fluctuated rapidly, a pretty spectacular sight to see. Flames of anger raged in his heart, but he couldn’t do anything other than endure; after all, his opponent had two Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters protecting him, so if he rushed out to fight against them, then the losing side would definitely be Thousand Leaves Sect.

Qiu Yu didn’t bother with Du Xian anymore and turned his ardent gaze back to Ye Jing Han, speaking intimately, “Ye’er, it has been a long time since I last saw you but you are more graceful than ever.”

He had been so bossy a moment ago, yet his bearing changed so drastically that it shocked the crowd, making them wonder if he was still the same person.

“You’re still as repulsive as before.” Ye Jing Han sneered in response.

After she said so, the eyes of the two old men next to Qiu Yu shone brightly and two powerful waves of pressure engulfed Ye Jing Han. She couldn’t help but groan softly, while her face turned a little pale.

“Stop!” Qiu Yu’s face fell and he shouted sharply.

Thereupon, the two old men next to him restrained their pressure.

“How dare you act without my permission?” Qiu Yu turned around and rebuked the two old men. “What if you hurt Ye’er? Without my permission, you are not to act, or don’t bother following me from now on.”

“Young Master, please forgive us!” The two old men that had just gotten rebuked didn’t get angry; instead, they lowered their heads and admitted their mistakes. It was a pretty shocking sight!

“Ye’er, are you all right?” Qiu Yu gazed at Ye Jing Han with concern. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Jing Han took a deep breath and said through gnashed teeth, “You should put a tight leash on your family’s dogs so they don’t run around and bite others randomly.”

Qiu Yu revealed a smile and folded his fan before nodding to Ye Jing Han and saying, “I have always loved your straightforward and outspoken nature.”

“And I’ve always despised you.”

“It isn’t a problem, it isn’t a problem,” Qiu Yu said with a smile, “I believe that as long as there is a will, there’s a way.”

“Come back to reality, even if you’re the only man left in this world, I still wouldn’t spare you a glance!” Ye Jing Han sneered coldly in response.

Qiu Yu’s face fell, but he still just smiled gracefully and didn’t bicker with her. He looked at Si Ming and asked, “What have you done to incur Ye’er’s wrath?”

Upon hearing this, Si Ming wiped off his cold sweat, clearly afraid of Qiu Yu, then said, “Nothing, it’s nothing. It’s just a routine procedure.”

“Hmph, then hurry up and apologize to Ye’er.” Qiu Yu snorted coldly.

Upon hearing this, Si Ming ran toward Ye Jing Han and spoke servilely, “Young Lady Ye, if I have offended you a moment ago, then please don’t take it to heart and forgive me.”

Ye Jing Han cast a glance at him then gestured at him indifferently, “Elder Si Ming, you were just upholding your duty. So, let’s just forget this.”
