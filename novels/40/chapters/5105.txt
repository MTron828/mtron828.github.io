Following the faint traces, Yang Kai’s consciousness tracked the signs back to the source and soon found what he was looking for.

Although he wasn’t certain about the exact location of the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest, he was confident that he got the direction right. As long as he moved in that direction, he would find the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

Since he had achieved his goal, he retracted his Divine Sense and left the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nest before shooting into the sky.

He didn’t waste any of his energy to destroy this Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest since all the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests were linked to the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. As long as he destroyed the source, all the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests would wither as well.

The moment Yang Kai’s consciousness left this special space, a certain consciousness temporarily fell into a dazed state in another similar but even more magnificent space.

The consciousnesses of the Feudal Lords’ Black Ink Nests would gather together in the special space transformed from the consciousness of the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. Similarly, the consciousnesses of the Territory Lords’ Black Ink Nests would assemble in the special space transformed from the consciousness of the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest.

This even bigger space was where the consciousness of the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest was located. The consciousnesses that had gathered together in this place came from the Territory Lords’ Black Ink Nests. Hence, the consciousnesses in this place represented the Territory Lords.

Upon detecting the anomaly, the other consciousnesses quickly inquired about it.

The consciousness from earlier fell silent for a moment and said hesitantly, “Just now, someone seemed to be searching for my location.”

“Someone was searching for your location?” Another consciousness asked curiously.

The third consciousness was equally inquisitive, “What’s the point of ascertaining your location? Are you mistaken?”

The first consciousness replied, “Maybe. I’m not sure about it.”

Since he had said so, the other consciousnesses stopped asking about it. This matter ended here, and they went on to talk about another topic.

“What’s going on with that Human named Yang Kai? Has Sir Hei Yuan captured him?”

“There’s no news about him yet, but it seems that Human has destroyed Sir Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest.”

“What? Sir Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest was destroyed? When did that happen?” Another consciousness exclaimed. It was apparent that he had not heard about this news yet.

“It happened not long ago. The person guarding the Black Ink Nest sent me a message at the last moment. Apparently, the Human named Yang Kai directly invaded Sir Hei Yuan’s home territory. Now, we can’t contact anyone from Sir Hei Yuan’s side. Our connection with them has been cut off.”

The other consciousnesses fell into silence.

All of these consciousnesses felt their hearts sinking at the revelation that a Human had destroyed a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. At the same time, they felt furious and humiliated.

The consciousnesses felt that the topic was too depressing, so they quickly moved on to another. They started discussing the war between the two Races and tried to speculate on the outcome.

While they were engrossed in the discussion, a certain consciousness suddenly exclaimed.

As the conversation was cut off, the other consciousnesses looked at him in puzzlement. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The consciousness explained, “Some Feudal Lords reported to me that the Human named Yang Kai came to our territory.”

“He’s in your territory? What is he doing there?”

“Regardless of what he is up to, quickly inform Sir Hei Yuan about it so that he can come over to help. Also, mobilise the Black Ink Clansmen in your territory and restrain the Human until Sir Hei Yuan arrives. We must not let him flee!”

“Got it.” The moment the consciousness finished speaking, he passed on an order through the Black Ink Nest network and the Black Ink Clansmen in his territory started taking action.

The other consciousnesses waited with concern as they asked about what was going on from time to time. Certainly, the consciousness wouldn’t hide anything from them.

Half a day later, a consciousness suddenly said in a puzzled manner, “The Human doesn’t seem to be running away from Sir Hei Yuan. Instead…”

“Go on.”

“It seems that he has targeted my Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest.”

Upon hearing that, the other consciousnesses paled, especially the one who represented the area of the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest where Yang Kai was located.

Just then, another consciousness said, “Earlier, you said that someone was trying to figure out your location, right?”

The consciousness that represented the area of the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest where Yang Kai was located replied, “Yes, that’s what I felt. Wait, you mean…”

“That’s right. The Human named Yang Kai didn’t know the exact location of your Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest, so he made use of a Feudal Lord’s Black Ink Nest to find it. He then headed straight to your place after that. His target is the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest!”

“What?” the consciousness exclaimed, “What should I do?”

“What about Sir Hei Yuan? Have you reached him?”

“Sir Hei Yuan is on his way, but he’s still far away from the Human. It seems that he can’t arrive in time to stop him.”

“Assemble the Feudal Lords to stall him! We must not let that Human destroy another Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest. Otherwise, it will be a humiliation we can never wipe away! When Sir Hei Yuan reaches there, he’ll easily capture that Human!”

“It’s too late…” The consciousness sounded despondent.

“Why?”

“It seems that Yang Kai has arrived. I can feel the fluctuations of battle outside.”

“It’s not a Human. It’s…”

“What are you talking about? What do you see?”

“It’s a monster that’s several tens of thousands of metres long with a humongous spear in its claws. The Feudal Lords can’t block him… it’s heading straight for the Black Ink… Argh!”

The shriek sent a shockwave across the other consciousnesses. Although they were not the ones experiencing the disaster, they could feel how heart-wrenching it must have been for their companion the moment they heard the shriek. Feelings of panic and fear overwhelmed these consciousnesses, causing them to tremble.

The Black Ink Nest’s consciousness was a medium through which one could connect with the other consciousnesses via Divine Sense. Although one could communicate with others swiftly and easily, he had to promptly cut off the connection when he fell into danger; otherwise, his Soul would die following the destruction of the Black Ink Nest. This was an unbearable pain for any living creature.

“This won’t end here!” The consciousness wailed. The message made the entire space descend into despair. The next moment, the consciousness vanished into thin air, as though he had never existed before.

The other consciousness fell into silence in this special space.

Another consciousness tried to contact him, but regardless of how hard he tried, he couldn’t reach the other side.

In the meantime, in a particular Territory Lord’s home territory, a colossal Black Ink Nest was cut down by the Azure Dragon Spear. A violent force caused the entire Black Ink Nest to collapse and countless Black Ink Clansmen lost their lives while the expansive territory shattered.

Those Black Ink Clansmen tried their hardest to repel the enemy, and many attacks of varying power were sent out at the 30,000-metre-long Dragon. Although most of the attacks were weak, they came in massive numbers.

The Golden Dragon Scales on the Dragon trembled upon impact and as its gigantic figure flew across the void, Dragon Blood fell to the ground.

Yang Kai didn’t intend to keep fighting with them. After destroying the Black Ink Nest and killing those who got in his way, he went on to snatch up as many resources as he could before turning around and escaping. A while later, he withdrew his Dragon Form and returned to his Human Form. Following that, he manipulated Space Principles and disappeared from the place with a flicker.

The Black Ink Clansmen dashed out of the broken territory and fearlessly pursued their hated enemy; however, they soon lost track of Yang Kai and could only aimlessly search for him. The Territory Lord’s territory behind them was now in a giant mess.

After a long time of silence, the consciousnesses that had gathered together in the grand space formed from the consciousness of the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest finally started reacting.

One of the consciousnesses said, “Another Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest has been destroyed.”

“We haven’t received any definitive news yet, so it’s too early to say that.”

“The truth is right before our eyes, why else wouldn’t we be able to contact them? You might want to deny it, but you can’t change the fact that a calamity has happened.”

“It was a several tens of thousands of metres long monster with a huge spear in its claws that destroyed the Black Ink Nest? What was it?”

“It’s a Grand Dragon! According to the Black Ink Disciples, a Grand Dragon is a powerful being. Sir Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest was destroyed by that same Grand Dragon. Furthermore, from what I’ve gathered, Yang Kai is not a Human. The Grand Dragon is his true form.”

“I don’t care whether he’s a Human or Grand Dragon, he’s destroyed two Territory Lord Black Ink Nests so far, and I don’t have to remind all of you that before our comrade passed away earlier, he said that ‘it won’t end here’. I’m sure you all know what that means.”

A consciousness asked in horror, “Does that mean that Yang Kai is going to destroy even more Territory Lord Black Ink Nests?”

“In order to repel the Human Army, the Territory Lords have left for the battlefield with their respective Armies. Apart from a few Territory Lords who have remained in the Royal Lord’s territory to guard the Royal City and coordinate other matters, there are no powerful Masters left. Moreover, some of those Territory Lords had to join up with the Royal Lord to fight against the Human Old Ancestor. It’s not surprising that Yang Kai would seize this chance to raise chaos. Although Sir Hei Yuan has been hunting him down, he hasn’t managed to achieve his goal so far. The Human’s next target could be me, or any one of you.”

Upon hearing that, those consciousnesses became apprehensive.

“We can’t pin all our hopes on Sir Hei Yuan. To put it bluntly, if he was able to capture the Human, the second Black Ink Nest wouldn’t have been destroyed. We have to save ourselves.”

“How are you going to do that? That Human is too powerful. We can’t fend him off even if we have a lot of subordinates with us.”

“Regardless of how powerful he is, he is on his own; moreover, he must be injured after destroying two Territory Lord Black Ink Nest. I believe he’ll have to recuperate for some time before acting again, so all of you don’t have to worry. However, once he recovers, he’ll probably make a move again.”

“Do you have a suggestion? Tell us about it.”

The consciousness then told everyone about his plan, and the rest of them nodded in agreement.
