Day after day, a large number of cultivators poured into the Star City, and in less than a month after the end of the second auction, the number of cultivators residing in the Star City had reached 200,000 according to the statistics of the Governor’s Mansion.

Such a number had far exceeded the limit of the previous Void Star City. If Yang Kai had not expanded the scale of the Star City in advance, it would have been extremely cramped.

The more people there were, the more problems would happen; there were people picking fights and provoking trouble every single day. The Star City law enforcement team had also arrested many people, which brought the Star City back to stability again.

The shopkeepers who had fled before also rushed back and gathered before the Governor’s Mansion to protest to get their shop back. Void Land ignored them, but later on had no choice but to send them to the dungeon after they ignored warnings to not cause a public disturbance.

About one-third of all the stores in the Star City had been leased out, and the profit from rent alone was a huge number.

Merchants from near and far had come to rent shops. This further drove the popularity of the Star City. Void Star City was no longer a desolate backwater, and one could buy any goods they looked for and could sell anything they wanted to sell.

Everything was on track.

As long as they could sustain this pace for a year and a half, the Star City could be completely stabilized and form a healthy circulation. By then, there would be no need to worry anymore.

Everyone was waiting for the start of the third auction.

Bian Yu Qing would come every half month to report on the situation of the Star City to Yang Kai at his residing palace, and today was no exception.

“Sect Master, according to the observation of this subordinate, people from the Cave Heavens and Paradises have arrived in the Star City, but have hidden their identities. It’s impossible to identify which Cave Heaven or Paradise they’re from.”

Yang Kai gave a small nod, “The matter regarding the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill is very important, it’s only natural for them to send people to investigate.”

“Then Sect Master… Should we make contact with them?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Just ignore them. Since they have hidden their identities, they obviously don’t want to reveal themselves. If they really want something, they will naturally come to us… En, was it a pair of Star City shopkeepers who bought the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill in the first auction for 140,000 Open Heaven Pills?”

Bian Yu Qing replied with a smile, “Sect Master is correct. Shopkeeper Jin and Shopkeeper Tong both originally ran small shops, but had no choice but to stay back because they were reluctant to abandon their property, allowing them to pick up a great bargain instead.”

“Send someone to protect them. Be cautious if someone comes in contact with them and wants to buy the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill.”

Bian Yu Qing’s expression changed slightly, “Does Sect Master mean…”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “No harm being prepared.”

Bian Yu Qing understood and bowed, “Rest assured, Sect Master. Elder Lu promised them before that if they needed help in the sale of Spirit Pill, they could inform Void Land, and we would act as an intermediary. They have no background or backing, so if they really want to sell off the Spirit Pill, they would definitely seek help from Void Land.”

“That’s good. In addition, quietly spread the news that I need a High-Rank Yin Element treasure.”

“Yes!” Bian Yu Qing bowed, “If Sect Master has no other orders, this subordinate will retreat now.”

“Go.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Bian Yu Qing stepped back respectfully, but turned back as soon as she left.

Yang Kai looked at her, “Is there anything else?”

Bian Yu Qing reported, “Sect Master, I just received news that some of your friends have come to Void Land and want to visit with you.”

“Friends?” Yang Kai raised his brows, “Who?”

“I was told that they’re from Great Moon Province, but I don’t know who they are.”

“Great Moon Province!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, suddenly having an idea of who they were, so he immediately called out, “Bring them in!”

“Yes!”

After a while, Yang Kai stood outside his palace with a smile on his face, watching a group of people speeding towards him. When they approached, he took a few steps forward to greet them.

Led by Bian Yu Qing personally, the group landed not far in front of Yang Kai. The leader of the group was a burly man, accompanied by a pretty woman. Both of them were Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. They were Wei Que and Tao Rong Fang from Great Moon Province, whom Yang Kai had met years ago. Behind them stood two men and two women.

All six of them were familiar faces, and many memories flitted through Yang Kai’s mind as his eyes swept across them.

However, they all seemed very reserved. Great Moon Province was only a Third-Class great force, and its leader was only a Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Void Land now possessed the atmosphere of a top-tier Second Class great force, with numerous Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. It was inevitable for them to feel stressed to be here.

The guests saw Yang Kai, who had come out to greet them, and the older looking man and one of the women were delighted, speeding up their pace a little, but they seemed to remember something a moment later and slowed down slightly.

“Great Moon Province’s Wei Que greets Sect Master Yang!” Wei Que took a step forward, cupped his fist and shouted.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand to hold him up and said with a smile, “Senior Wei, it’s good to see you again.”

Wei Que broke into a grin at the word ‘Senior’, and his stiffened body relaxed a lot.

Yang Kai turned to Tao Rong Fang again, nodding gently, “Senior Tao.”

Tao Rong Fang bowed elegantly, “Sect Master Yang!”

Yang Kai then looked at the two men and two women behind them with a happy smile on his face.

Old Fang too, was smiling, but his smile was a little stiff. Meng Hong on the other hand, who was standing beside him, looked perfectly calm. Meng Hong had been with Yang Kai for over ten years in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, and formed a close friendship with him; therefore, even though Yang Kai was now the owner of a prosperous great force, with powerful subordinates, Meng Hong did not feel too much pressure.

Behind the two were Dié You and Ah Sun. At this moment, Dié You was looking at Yang Kai with a complicated expression. She could not help but recall the days when they all lived together in Seven Wonders Land.

Back then, when the very ground under their feet was still Seven Wonders Land, they lived a life without hope for the future, wasting away their time and resources for trivial Third-Order materials.

Even as a mere Worker, however, Yang Kai was able to find a way to thrive, and now, after years of separation, he was the owner of this land. It was indeed true that capable people were able to achieve more than what ordinary people could.

Old Fang was grinning, he did not know what to say. Before coming here, he thought about what to say to Yang Kai when they met, but was really intimidated by the prosperity of the Star City and the strength of Void Land when he arrived.

Yang Kai took two steps forward, and gave Old Fang a hearty bear hug while Old Fang continued to gaze at him dumbfounded, giving him a huge pat on the back, “I haven’t seen you for many years, Old Fang, you’re looking older than ever!”

Old Fang’s initially stiff body immediately twitched and he shouted angrily, “Nonsense, despite this Old Master’s age, he is still as mighty as a Dragon and fierce as a Tiger, how am I getting old!?”

Yang Kai’s warm welcome had made him forgo his embarrassment and anxiety. He chuckled and shook his head, “You brat…”

Yang Kai let go of him, turned to Dié You and Ah Sun with open arms, “You two on the other hand have grown even more beautiful!”

Dié You blushed and swerved away, glaring at Yang Kai. Ah Sun foolishly wanted to lean forward and accept the embrace, but Dié You hurriedly grabbed her and snapped, “He’s trying to take advantage of you, you silly girl.”

Ah Sun suddenly realized, then made a face at Yang Kai as she shouted, “My Master is here, be careful or she’ll beat you up!”

...

To the side, Tao Rong Fang laughed dryly. Given that Yang Kai’s identity was different now and she was just a Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, how would she dare to make a move against him in Void Land? If her Disciple was really taken advantage of, all she could do was to pretend not to see it.

“It’s just a hug, you won’t lose anything!” Yang Kai complained, “Look how generous Old Fang was.”

“Bah!” Dié You spat, “He’s an old man, how can he be the same as us?”

Old Fang was suddenly upset, “Who’s an old man!?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The group quarreled noisily, and the atmosphere suddenly became harmonious. The previous respect and caution was longer present. Wei Que and Tao Rong Fang exchanged glances, grateful that Yang Kai had deliberately broken the ice between them.

It seemed that their trip here was not a mistake. Even though Yang Kai now held a lofty position, he never despised them for their weakness, and all the previous worries had vanished.

“Brother Meng!” Yang Kai saluted to Meng Hong again.

Meng Hong saluted back, “Brother Yang!”

Meng Hong was quite likeable, and one of the three Mid-Rank World Fruits Yang Kai had was given to him by Meng Hong. In the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, Meng Hong received much help and protection from Yang Kai, allowing him and the other Great Moon Province disciples to remain unscathed. The Mid-Rank World Fruit was Meng Hong’s way of thanking Yang Kai.

However, only one out of the three Mid-Rank World Fruits were left. One of them was given to Yue He to help her advance to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, and another was given to Lu Xue for her advancement to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

“You have travelled far. Let’s talk inside.” Yang Kai ushered them in warmly, and turned to instructed Bian Yu Qing, “Prepare a banquet. Today, I won’t go home unless I’m drunk with these old friends!”

...

“Yes!” Bian Yu Qing saluted elegantly and left immediately.

After a while, in the Main Hall, wine flowed freely and cups went gaily round, making for a lively atmosphere. Yang Kai, Old Fang, Ah Sun, and Die You were all Workers in Seven Wonders Land previously. Everyone reminisced sadly as they looked back on the days when it seemed that they would never see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Who would have thought they could ever escape Seven Wonders Land? Perhaps only Yang Kai, who had been planning his escape since the first day he entered Seven Wonders Land.

Old Fang and Dié You had been enslaved by Seven Wonders Land for hundreds of years, and if it was not for Yang Kai, who threw everything into chaos and finally led them to escape, they would not have been able to ever have a new life.

But now, the once Worker of the land was the overlord of Void Land, leader of over 300 Open Heaven Realm Masters, and even the owner of a thriving Star City that was renowned throughout the 3,000 Worlds.

Although Old Fang and the others did not have grand accomplishments like Yang Kai did, they were still doing pretty well in Great Moon Province. At the very least, there was hope for the future, and the days were no longer as dark as they used to be.
