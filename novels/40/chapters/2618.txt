As they spoke, Sha Yong and Gu Peng had both dashed in front of Ji Yao, each of them reaching out a hand to grab her.

Ji Yao’s expression abruptly turned ice-cold. There was a loud clang, a flash of the blade, and then blood sprayed.

Two horrible yells rang out as the two who had dashed at her jumped back, their faces terribly pale.

*Pa pa…*

Two severed arms fell to the ground.

“My arm!” Sha Yong screamed in shock, staring at the severed limb on the ground as though he had only just realised what had happened to him. Meanwhile, Gu Peng’s expression was not much better, either.

“Bold! With such low cultivation, you still dare to come and court death?” Yang Kai looked at the two men with great astonishment, unable to comprehend their actions.

When those two fellows had come charging forth so aggressively, one for the man and the other for the woman, Yang Kai had thought that they would be quite powerful, but now, upon checking them with his Divine Sense, he realised that they were merely Third-Order Dao Source Realms.

“You…” Gu Peng stared at Yang Kai and Ji Yao, appalled, “How could you have recovered so quickly?”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed, as he didn’t quite understand what Gu Peng meant. He thought about it for a moment, then it all became clear as he smiled, “You thought that we would suffer side-effects from teleporting here?

Teleporting via a Space Array was always accompanied by a bout of dizziness, regardless of distance travelled, leaving all cultivators somewhat disoriented upon their arrival. Under such circumstances, the cultivator’s senses and reflexes would both be heavily dulled, making this the likeliest time for sneak attacks to succeed.

Thus, under normal circumstances, Space Arrays of large cities would be guarded by cultivators from the City Lord’s Mansion. They were not only responsible for protecting the Space Array from being damaged, but also for protecting the incoming cultivators from being ambushed.

But the Space Array in this Black Armour City seemed to be different. It sat right in the centre of the city, and did not have anyone nearby to guard it. Instead, there were a few people nearby looking to commit theft and make a quick profit.

Sha Yong and Gu Peng were two such opportunists, and they had intended to ambush Yang Kai and Ji Yao while they were disoriented, but instead, they had the tables turned on them.

Yang Kai, having cultivated the Dao of Space, had manipulated the Space Principles to protect Ji Yao and himself back when he was starting the teleportation from the Netherworld Sect. A mere short distance teleportation like this could not possibly affect him.

“How can this be?” Sha Yong was completely befuddled, his face aghast.

“Because this Young Master is strong!” Yang Kai grinned, but his expression struck terror and anxiety into Sha Yong and Gu Peng’s hearts.

“Sir, please spare us!” The bearded man Sha Yong immediately started begging for mercy.

A look flashed across Gu Peng’s face and he turned to flee.

“Hmph!” Ji Yao coldly snorted, turning the sword in her hand. She thrust it forward as she dashed towards Gu Peng, catching up to him in an instant and piercing him straight through the heart. He fell to the ground and was dead instantly.

As a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master against a Third-Order Dao Source Ream cultivator, Ji Yao didn’t need to use any of her true power at all.

As Sha Yong saw this, his face grew paler and his legs trembled. With a look of misery he pleaded, “I beg you, please spare my wretched life.”

Yang Kai looked at him impassively, and coldly said, “You two seem to have done quite a lot of these thefts and robberies.”

“No, no, this is my first time, it really is!” Sha Yong said piteously, looking up at him.

“One that walks frequently by the river cannot keep his shoes dry,” Yang Kai explained, “Since you’ve entered this profession, then you should have the corresponding awareness. You’re too young, don’t do such acts again in your next life.”

“Next life…” Sha Yong jolted, his eyes full of terror, but before he could do anything else, Ji Yao had already struck out with her palm, turning him into meat paste.

The cultivators nearby all shuddered. They stared at the icy woman, who possessed peerless beauty but killed humans like they were nothing but flies. Every one of them was terrified, fearing that she was in the mood for murder and would wreak havoc upon the place.

Yang Kai reached out and took the two Space Rings, without looking to see what was within. The Space Rings of two Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators were nothing to him; after all, he was quite wealthy now. He then turned to Ji Yao and said impassively, “Let’s go.”

Ji Yao nodded, and the two of them flew away.

As they left Black Armour City, Yang Kai pointed in a direction and said, “Yao’er, the Northern Territory should be that way. Do you know the way back to Ice Heart Valley?

Ji Yao nodded her head, “I do.”

“Then you lead the way, I need to cultivate for a while,” Yang Kai instructed. He tossed out his ship artifact and landed upon it, calling Ji Yao to join him.

However, Ji Yao eyed the ship and said rather apologetically, “Honoured Master, let’s use my flight type artifact instead. Yours is… not suitable.”

Yang Kai grimaced.

This ship was a casual gift from Jiu Feng years ago, and it was a Dao Source Grade High-Rank artifact. Yang Kai used to think it was pretty good to use, but now that his cultivation had reached the Emperor Realm, it was rather unfitting of his status.

Ji Yao had clearly noticed the quality of the ship, which was why she had said those words.

Since she had a better one, Yang Kai didn’t object and put away his ship with a nod, not wanting to be embarrassed.

Ji Yao smiled, as though she had perceived Yang Kai’s thoughts. She waved her hand, and a small, elegant ship appeared before Yang Kai.

This ship was not large, only about ten metres in length, but it was exquisitely built. One could tell with one glance that it was made by a Master, and the ship emanated dense waves of Spirit Qi. It was undoubtedly an impressive Emperor Artifact!

Yang Kai had not expected that, with Ji Yao being so unhinged with her wealth all these years, she could still possess such a treasure.

“Please go ahead, Honoured Master!” Ji Yao gestured towards it.

Yang Kai cleared his throat solemnly, then stepped upon the ship.

“Honoured Master, please find a room to rest, and leave the rest of the journey to Yao’er”, Ji Yao offered.

“Very well,” Yang Kai nodded, striding into the cabin with his hands behind his back. He found a room and entered, and before he could even sit down, he felt the ship shake slightly and start flying off as swift as the wind.

The speed far outclassed that of his wooden boat.

Speed was one thing, but more importantly, this ship was very comfortable inside, nothing like his own flight type artifact. When Yang Kai sat on his ship, if he didn’t activate the protective barrier, then the force of the wind in his face would practically blow it out of shape.

It seemed like he really did need to find a better flight type artifact, or he wouldn’t even have anything to travel with in the future.

Yang Kai gathered his thoughts and entered the Sealed World Bead to look around.

His Embodiment had been in a deep sleep ever since he was forcibly stuffed with Shi Huo’s Source by Ruo Xi. It sat there, cross-legged and unmoving. Who knew how long it would be before he could truly assimilate Shi Huo’s Source.

Yang Kai went over to look at the medicine garden next and found that the spirit medicines in the garden were all growing well and the medicinal efficacy of the thousands of Emperor Grade spirit medicines was no longer being lost.

The entire Small Sealed World was so quiet that it made Yang Kai rather despondent.

When he came here in the past, he would find Ruo Xi, Liu Yan, Sister Hua…

But now there was only the Embodiment, all alone and in a deep slumber, with no one to even welcome his arrival.

Yang Kai shook his head with a sigh, then exited the Sealed World Bead.

Sitting upright in the cabin, Yang Kai took out a large amount of High-Rank Source Crystals, then he took out and consumed some of the Emperor Grade Spirit Pills he had refined last time to supplement his cultivation. He silently channelled his Secret Art and began cultivating.

The experiences he had in the Ancient Land, especially the powerlessness he had felt against Divine Spirit Shi Huo, made Yang Kai’s desire for power grow far stronger. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Now that he finally had a bit of spare time, he was naturally eager to go into retreat and cultivate.

In just a moment, Spirit Qi so dense that it was almost tangible filled up the whole cabin room, and it could even be seen with the naked eye that Yang Kai was absorbing it into his body.

Even though the Spirit Qi stored within High-Rank Source Crystals was tremendous, the amount which Yang Kai used up was terrifyingly huge.

Piles and piles of Source Crystals were reduced to dust, and numerous Emperor Grade Spirit Pills were consumed as the power within Yang Kai’s body kept increasing.

Sometime later, the ship suddenly shuddered, and even came to a stop.

Yang Kai was jolted out of his cultivation by the disturbance and frowned, not knowing what was going on.

Before he could extend his Divine Sense to investigate, he heard Ji Yao’s icy voice coming from outside, “Make way!”

Just as she spoke those words, the voice of an old man sounded, “Young Lady, we’d like to ask a favour. Young Lady Xue Man seems to really like your ship, can I persuade you to part with it? Of course, the price we offer will not disappoint you.”

“Move!” Ji Yao replied coldly, ignoring the request.

The old man’s tone became a little angry, “Young lady, is there a need to be so standoffish? Young Lady Xue Man wanting your boat is also for your own good. The Northern Territory has not been peaceful these past few years, and if you ostentatiously steer such a beautiful ship through the city, I’m afraid you will easily attract unwanted attention. If you were to encounter any evildoers, your fate would be most worrying indeed.”

“That’s right, young lady. You’d be doing us a favour as well as yourself. We’ll definitely offer a price that won’t disappoint you.” A younger voice spoke this time.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai asked as he stepped out of the cabin and onto the deck, standing by Ji Yao’s side.

Looking up, he saw their path blocked by a group of three.

A man, a woman, and an old man.

The man and woman appeared to be a couple, as they seemed quite close. The man was handsome and the woman was pretty, making them quite an attractive pair. It was only the expressions in their eyes that ruined the impression they gave off.

The man was looking at Ji Yao as though he thought he’d laid eyes upon a goddess, and his gaze was absolutely glued to her as he spoke. It was clear that he was struck by her beauty.

The woman’s gaze, on the other hand, bore a trace of jealousy as her wide eyes looked Ji Yao up and down. She found that no matter how she tried to compare them, her looks were vastly inferior to the other’s, turning her mood even sourer.

Noticing the smitten expression on her partner’s face, the woman gave him a hard pinch and a twist, drawing a yelp of pain from his lips.
