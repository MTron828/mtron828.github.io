The masters of the Sea Clan had already learned from Qian Mo and Shang Ao what Shadowed Heaven Pills were. Although they understood that Shadowed Heaven Pills were Heaven-defying treasures, the primary ingredient required to refine them only existed on Shadowed Soul Island, so even if they wanted them, they could not obtain them.

The little dolphin had some, but not many, all of which were given to her by Yang Kai before and were considered her personal items.

Who would feel right taking the Sea Clan Princess’ pills? Even Lie Kong only took a Shadowed Heaven Pill from her to study for a while before giving it back to his daughter.

Yet now, Yang Kai had offered them five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills just like that. For the Sea Clan, this was a massive windfall. With these five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills, several of Sea God Palace’s peak level masters could substantially increase their physical strength.

When he heard Yang Kai was willing to give Sea God Palace five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills in exchange for this Sea God Bead, Lie Kong was momentarily unable to restrain his joy.

“Yup!” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills, although a huge fortune, was nothing to the current High Heaven Sect. The Shadowed Heaven Lotus Yang Kai brought back last time had all been given to Xia Ning Chang, and she should have refined a massive amount of pills after so many days.

Lie Kong coughed as he wet his dry lips, “How could we accept such generosity....”

“If Palace Master Lie Kong disagrees, then this Yang won’t feel comfortable accepting this Sea God Bead.”

Lie Kong paused for a moment before nodding, “Since Sect Master Yang is willing to go so far, this Lie Kong won’t be polite. This King agrees! May friendship between Sea God Palace and High Heaven Sect last forever!”

“Great, I will have someone send the five hundred Shadowed Heaven Pills to Sea God Palace within a few days,” Yang Kai cupped his fists to the Sea Clan masters, “This Yang will take his leave!”

Saying so, Yang Kai stepped directly into the Space Array and teleported to the outskirts of High Heaven Sect.

The Sea God Bead he obtained by accident this time was incredibly useful to Yang Kai. Although he did not cultivate any Water Attribute Secret Arts or Secret Techniques, the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art required supreme treasures of each of the five elements.

Among the five elements, Yang Kai did not need to worry about the Fire Attribute supreme treasure. The energy contained within the Sun’s True Essence was so immense that it had barely even diminished even after he had cultivated with it for so long.

However, the supreme treasures Yang Kai used for the other four elements had more or less been used up.

Whether it was the Thunder Wood, Profound Yin Sunflower Water, Profound Gold, or Divine Nullification Sand, none of them would last much longer.

The Sea God Bead Yang Kai obtained this time could be used to replace the Profound Yin Sunflower Water when he cultivated the Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art in the future.

The Sea God Bead was formed from the source of the sea and had rich, pure Water Attribute energy. Compared with the Profound Yin Sunflower Water, the Sea God Bead was no doubt higher in both grade and quality, so there was no issue with it meeting Yang Kai’s requirements. Additionally, the energy stored within it was much greater than what was contained in the Profound Yin Sunflower Water.

It seemed Yang Kai would not need to worry about finding a new Water Attribute supreme treasure for a long time.

However, as it was right now, Yang Kai really did not have any difficulties finding supreme treasures of the other three elements either. All he needed to do was issue a command and supreme treasures would be delivered to him. Whether he could find a treasure comparable to the Sea God Bead was questionable, though.

After returning to High Heaven Sect, Yang Kai went straight to Ye Xi Yun and told her about the deal between him and Sea God Palace and asked her to send someone to collect five hundred Origin Grade Shadowed Heaven Pills from Xia Ning Chang.

Ye Xi Yun naturally did not refuse.

Over the next two months, Yang Kai travelled to various famous cities and Sects on Shadowed Star, constantly arranging Space Arrays.

Two months later, the Space Array outside of High Heaven Sect had been connected to almost all corners of Shadowed Star. Now, if a disciple needed to, they could rush to any major city they wanted to in an instant.

Such a massive project was something which had never appeared on Shadowed Star before. This way, High Heaven Sect could not only grasp and manage the situation across all of Shadowed Star at all times, but it could also purchase any kind of materials or products it wanted from anywhere it wanted.

Yang Kai’s final stop was Heavenly Fate City.

He needed to meet with Qian Tong as well, so Yang Kai figured he could finish up arranging a Space Array then have enough free time to handle whatever matter Qian Tong needed to consult him about.

On this day, Yang Kai arrived above Heavenly Fate City, and looking down at the post-war scene from the sky, Yang Kai could not help feeling a little nostalgic.

When he first came to Shadowed Star, he was nothing more than a Second-Order Saint, but after all these years he had managed to cultivate to the peak of Shadowed Star’s Martial Dao. In retrospect, it was here, on Dragon Cave Mountain outside Heavenly Fate City, that he started his rise, ultimately leading to today’s High Heaven Sect.

Bit by bit, Yang Kai recalled these past events as if they had only happened yesterday.

Yang Kai smiled slightly before flying straight towards the City Lord’s Mansion.

After being looted by Corpse Spirit Religion, Heavenly Fate City suffered heavy devastation, but after such a long period of rebuilding, today’s Heavenly Fate City was booming again.

Fei Zhi Tu was still Heavenly Fate City’s City Lord!

When Yang Kai met with him today, Fei Zhi Tu had already restored his cultivation to the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm.

It seemed that this was partly thanks to him enduring the torture of the Fang Feng Qi from Corpse Spirit Religion last time.

Yang Kai naturally felt happy for him, and Fei Zhi Tu was even more excited after seeing Yang Kai. Learning what Yang Kai came for, he immediately permitted him to do as he pleased.

Yang Kai did not stand on ceremony and immediately got to work arranging the new Space Array in Heavenly Fate City, connecting it to High Heaven Sect.

Just two days later, the Space Array had been completed.

As he arranged more and more Space Arrays, Yang Kai had become familiar with the process and was now much faster at it than when he started.

With a flash of white light, Fei Zhi Tu disappeared from atop the Space Array, and soon after, reappeared. Laughing heartily, he said, “Sure enough, I was teleported straight to High Heaven Sect. Our two Sects can now communicate at any time without delay.”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded before suddenly asking, “By the way, Senior, is Old Qian coming?”

When Yang Kai asked about Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu’s expression immediately became serious as he nodded, “He’s already here, but when he saw you busy setting up this Space Array, he decided not to bother you. You should go and meet him quickly; Old Ghost Qian seems to be having some kind of problem he cannot resolve.”

“A problem even Old Qian can’t resolve?” Yang Kai was stunned, not understanding what the matter was that rendered even a master like Qian Tong helpless.

While he was arranging the Space Array here, Yang Kai already had Fei Zhi Tu send a message to Shadow Moon Hall. Two days was more than enough time for Qian Tong to arrive.

Not delaying any further, Yang Kai quickly went to meet Qian Tong together with Fei Zhi Tu.

Inside a large hall in the City Lord’s Mansion, Yang Kai found three people waiting for him.

All three of these people were Yang Kai’s old acquaintances. Other than Qian Tong, Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er were also present.

Seeing Yang Kai, Qian Tong’s eyes lit up and he smiled bitterly, “Little brat, seems like you haven’t forgotten about me after all.”

“Sorry Old Qian, I thought whatever it was wasn’t a big deal, so I didn’t rush over. I’ve been running around Shadowed Star for the past few months,” Yang Kai smiled awkwardly. If he knew that Qian Tong was so anxious, he would have come to Heavenly Fate City first. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Qian Tong grinned wryly, “It’s nothing so urgent, otherwise, this old master would have gone to High Heaven Sect personally to find you.”

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er both got up quickly to greet Yang Kai.

Yang Kai replied in kind, and after scanning them with his Divine Sense, he noticed both of Saint Qis were flowing quite vigorously while their auras pulsed slightly, an obvious sign that they were on the verge of a breakthrough.

The two were worthy of the most elite disciples of Shadow Moon Hall! Less than ten years after breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, these two were about to make a breakthrough again. Logically speaking, even with the aptitude of Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er, their cultivation should not have progressed so rapidly, but Yang Kai figured their astonishing growth had something to do with the recent Corpse Spirit Religion upheaval.

Cultivators could often force out all their potential when facing desperate situations.

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er had experienced numerous life or death battles during the war, which was of great benefit to their future cultivation.

When young people met, the scene inevitably became lively.

While Yang Kai talked with Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu did not interrupt, just sitting to the side and watching with smiles.

Only after a good long chat did Yang Kai turn to Qian Tong and ask, “By the way, what is this matter you wanted to consult with me about, Old Qian? I heard Senior Fei mention that even you were unable to resolve it.”

Qian Tong’s expression gradually became serious and he nodded, “Yeah, this old master really is helpless in this situation, which is why I came to you for help.”

“What’s the matter?”

“You should be able to tell if you take a closer look,” Qian Tong didn’t answer directly and instead began releasing a powerful and mysterious force from his figure.

Domain!

Domain was a power exclusive to Origin Kings and was the ultimate evolution of Shi.

Qian Tong had broken through to the Origin King Realm only a few years ago, so his Domain was not too powerful, but even so, when he released it, the entire world seemed to tremble.

Fortunately, he did not aim his Domain at anyone present, instead restraining it so that even if Wei Gu Chang and the others felt slugging and their Saint Qi circulation became slow, they did not suffer any harm.

Yang Kai paid close attention to Qian Tong as requested and soon frowned deeply, releasing his Divine Sense to probe the latter.

Seeing the look on Yang Kai’s face, Qian Tong immediately knew that he had already noticed something and continued to maintain his Domain, allowing Yang Kai to examine the situation more clearly.

After a brief silence, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense, but his frown remained.

“Since you are the Lord of Shadowed Star, you should be able to tell, yes?” Qian Tong asked after withdrawing his Domain.

Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Gu Chang, and Dong Xuan’er were all confused as none of them noticed anything wrong with Qian Tong. From their perspective, Qian Tong seemed perfectly fine and his Domain, once released, was as powerful as ever.

“The World Principles here... are rejecting you?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously with a look of shock in his eyes.

“You really can tell,” Qian Tong sighed.

“What?” Fei Zhi Tu was shocked, “Old Ghost Qian is being rejected by Shadowed Star’s World Principles? How is that even possible?”

“Nothing is impossible,” Qian Tong smiled bitterly and shook his head, “If it weren’t for my being rejected by the World Principles here, do you think this old master would be struck by lightning for no apparent reason?”
