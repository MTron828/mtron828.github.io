There was a table at the bottom of the World Tree. Yang Kai and Xu Ling Gong were seated across from each other as they chatted over wine and waited patiently.

Regardless of who the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master was, he or she would immediately see the gigantic tree that was almost 300 kilometres in height now when they arrived at the Star Boundary. When they landed on the ground, they would then easily spot Yang Kai and Xu Ling Gong.

The visitors were all Xu Ling Gong’s close friends that had been informed of what was going on. Xu Ling Gong introduced Yang Kai to these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the various Cave Heavens and Paradises in order to familiarise the young man with them.

Whoever the visitor was, they wouldn’t hesitate to leave upon inquiring Xu Ling Gong about the situation in this place. They were eager to look into what was going on in the Star Boundary. During this recent period of time, there were many High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters in the Star Boundary, which was quite unprecedented.

In just one month, Yang Kai got to know 30 such people.

At the same time, there was an extensive public campaign going on in the Star Boundary. With High Heaven Palace taking the lead, assisted by the other major Sects, all the information about the Outer Universe, the 3,000 Worlds, and the 108 top great forces was written into booklets and engraved into jades that were distributed to the general populace. Wherever there were people who gathered together, such information would be given to them.

The Star Boundary was bound to become the Open Heaven Realm Cradle of the 3,000 Worlds, and the Cave Heavens and Paradises would start accepting disciples from this place in the near future. Since they had to move with the times, they had to let everyone in the Star Boundary become familiar with the information about the outside world. Only by doing so would they be able to make informed choices.

It was imaginable that the hundreds of billions of lives in the Star Boundary would be shocked by the extensive campaign that was no different from a windstorm to them.

After all, prior to this, they were like the frogs in the well. But now, there was a chance for them to leap out of the well and have a peek at the wider sky.

In just one month, everyone in the Star Boundary knew that the top 108 great forces from the Outer Universe would come over to take on disciples. If they were lucky enough, their lives would drastically change.

Countless rogue cultivators became eager as they hoped that those powerful cultivators from the Outer Universe would have their eyes on them. However, it was destined to be a pipe dream for these people. Although the current generation in the Star Boundary had undergone some transformation following the growth of the World Tree, the people who would experience the greatest change were the newborns and those who were still unborn.

One month later, the last batch of people arrived, so Xu Ling Gong finished his tea and rose from the chair before speaking, “Since everyone’s here, it’s time to discuss the rules.”

Yang Kai hurriedly sent a message to Hua Qing Si and told her to get prepared.

Xu Ling Gong faced north as his lips squirmed, but he was not heard speaking. A moment later, he said to Yang Kai, “Let’s go.”

As a thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, the two of them appeared outside of High Heaven Palace in the next moment.

After they waited for a bit, they saw many rays of lights approaching from all directions and landing in front of them.

Xu Ling Gong stood beside Yang Kai with his hands behind his back. He would either tease the visitors or nod gently. On the other hand, Yang Kai was busy greeting them.

This couldn’t be helped, as these Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were all his Seniors, and they were also Xu Ling Gong’s friends. As a son-in-law of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven as well as a Great Emperor of the Star Boundary, he had to show proper hospitality.

The female disciples of High Heaven Palace were already there to lead the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters into the palace.

All of them were efficient, and barely an hour after Xu Ling Gong sent the messages, everyone had returned to this place from different parts of the Star Boundary. By the time Yang Kai and Xu Ling Gong entered the Grand Hall, they saw a huge round table in the centre filled with people.

The over 30 High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were seated around the table in silence as they secretly communicated with one another using their Divine Senses. The female disciples behind them, who were ready to serve them at any moment, were anxious and dripping in sweat.

The round table was custom-made. After seeking some advice from Xu Ling Gong, Yang Kai quickly told some Artifact Refiners in High Heaven Palace to make it. This couldn’t be helped, as the visitors were all powerful High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters. Yang Kai wasn’t in any place to determine whether one was more noble than the other, so the usual arrangement of seats might give off a feeling that some people were less important. A round table solved that problem as all of them were equal.

As soon as Xu Ling Gong stepped into the hall, the Divine Senses abruptly stopped. Most of them turned their heads to examine Yang Kai, who was behind Xu Ling Gong.

At that moment, Yang Kai felt immensely pressured. Although these High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters hadn’t tried to oppress him, he still became sluggish for a moment. But soon, he managed to pull himself together. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Some of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters arched their brows with surprise when they saw this.

The round table was quite big as there were still vacant seats, even though there were already more than 30 people sitting around it. Xu Ling Gong found a slightly more spacious place and took a seat alongside Yang Kai.

No one found it off that Yang Kai, a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, was seated at the table; after all, they were in the Star Boundary, and he was a Great Emperor of this place. Furthermore, these people were Xu Ling Gong’s close friends who rushed over to this place upon receiving his messages, so no one would look down on Yang Kai.

“Many thanks for coming, my friends. It’s hard for so many of us to come together usually, so we should appreciate this rare chance. I’m sure all of you have surveyed this place and realised what is going on. This Xu has asked all of you to come over because we need to have a discussion and set some rules about what will take place now so that everyone can be satisfied,” Xu Ling Gong gently said.

An old man, who had lost one arm, waited for him to finish his words before he said, “Old friend Xu, there’s no rush to have a discussion. This Old Master has a question for the young man beside you first.”

Yang Kai looked at the person and instantly recognised him. The man was an Inner Elder of Purple Jade Cave Heaven, Xun Ping. There was rarely anyone who was a match for a powerful High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, so it wasn’t certain why he had lost an arm. Despite that, he was still a formidable cultivator with an ample heritage.

Yang Kai cupped his fist with a smile, “Please ask, Senior Xun.”

The person beside Xun Ping seemed to know what the latter was going to ask, so he put on a gleeful expression as he was ready to watch a good show.

Just then, Xun Ping’s clear voice reverberated around the Grand Hall, “Is Zuo Quan Hui dead?”

Yang Kai frowned as he had no idea why this person suddenly mentioned such an issue. He turned to look at Xu Ling Gong, who nodded while still staring at the front.

It was then Yang Kai nodded, “He’s dead.”

“Who killed him? How did he die?” Xun Ping asked.

Yang Kai replied, “He manifested his Small Universe, then he was killed by me and some of my companions from Void Land.”

Xun Peng narrowed his eyes.

Other than Xu Ling Gong, who was already aware of the truth, the other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters at the table were stunned.

Manifesting one’s Small Universe was the last resort for a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master to defeat their enemies. The people at the scene couldn’t figure out what kind of danger Zuo Quan Hui was in that forced him to make such a decision.

Despite that, he was still killed in the end.

All of them were Inner Elders of their respective Cave Heavens and Paradises, so even though they were not on close terms with Zuo Quan Hui, they did come into contact with him before. Now that Zuo Quan Hui was dead, they felt somewhat awkward.

“Zuo Quan Hui is dead, but what about Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan?” An elegant-looking woman asked. She was an Inner Elder of Luo Sheng Cave Heaven, Luo Xiu.

Yang Kai replied impassively, “They’re also dead.”

Most of them seemed to have expected it, so their expressions didn’t change; after all, it wasn’t a secret that Zuo Quan Hui previously led Heavenly Sword Union to attack Void Land, and he was assisted by Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao. Since Zuo Quan Hui was dead, there was no way Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao could have survived. However, they were still astounded by Yang Kai’s audacity while some of them fell into their thoughts.

Luo Xiu shot Yang Kai a glare, “You’re just as cunning as that Old Xu.”

While Yang Kai didn’t understand her, Xu Ling Gong started guffawing, “He’s the son-in-law of my Sect, so it’s expected that he resembles me. What’s wrong with that?”

Luo Xiu snorted, “It doesn’t matter that a traitor is dead. Those from Thousand Cranes Paradise wouldn’t make a fuss over it. The problem now is that Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao were killed. This Queen already knows what you two are up to.”

A curious Xu Ling Gong asked, “What could we be up to? I don’t get you, Junior Sister Luo. Why don’t we delve into this topic in my room tonight?”

“Sure.” A charming Luo Xiu kept a faint smile on her face, “We should do that sooner rather than later. I’ll look for you tonight.”

Xu Ling Gong nodded repeatedly, “Sure thing.”

A dumbfounded Yang Kai stared at him.

On the other hand, Xun Ping let out a sigh as he appeared dejected, “I can’t believe Zuo Quan Hui was killed just like that. His reputation was already destroyed; nevertheless, he still owed me something.”

Yang Kai had no idea what this person’s relationship with Zuo Quan Hui was; however, since Xu Ling Gong had invited him over, there shouldn’t be a problem.

“Let’s stop the small talk.” Xu Ling Gong knocked on the table, “There’s an important issue to discuss here.”

As expected, all of them fell silent and gazed at Xu Ling Gong.

Yang Kai had previously asked Xu Ling Gong to head this discussion since more than 30 people, who represented different Cave Heavens and Paradises, had been invited; they were supposed to be able to come up with an arrangement that everyone would be pleased with. However, would the other great forces who were not present acknowledge it? After all, they didn’t take part in it.

Xu Ling Gong replied with a smile that the Cave Heavens and Paradises had always been united since time immemorial; therefore, 30 or so was enough to represent everyone. None of them was a fool. These people not only represented their own great forces, but also all the Cave Heavens and Paradises. When discussing the matter, they would be taking all the Cave Heavens and Paradises into consideration instead of speaking up only for their own great force.

Those who didn’t join the discussion would acknowledge the result of the discussion. That was because if they wanted to be part of it, they had to first acknowledge the rules that had been set; otherwise, they wouldn’t have the right.

Yang Kai was initially doubtful, but when he saw that none of them objected to it, as though they would be able to come to a conclusion on this day, he set his mind at ease.

This was destined to be a discussion that would change the entire 3,000 Worlds, an event that would be greatly discussed in the history books.

However, such a discussion took place in an unknown Small Universe that was located at the edge of the 3,000 Worlds. Before Xu Ling Gong informed them about it, the people at the scene probably hadn’t even heard of the Star Boundary before.
