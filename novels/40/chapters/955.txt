Chapter 956, Su Yan’s Whereabouts

Yang Kai’s heart clenched. If this Bone Race master was telling the truth, it meant they were visitors from a different world across the Starry Sky.

How was this not shocking?

Many had suspected that there might be other intelligent creatures in the vast Starry Sky.

But because no one could cross the Starry Sky, no one could confirm this theory.

It wasn’t until this moment that Yang Kai was able to determine that the suspicions of these great predecessors were true.

The Bone Race had come from the Starry Sky, they weren’t natives of Tong Xuan Realm!

“Boy, how much did you see just now?” Ke Luo’s pair of sinister green eyes stared coldly at Yang Kai as he asked.

“Basically everything.”

Yang Kai had witnessed the strangeness of the blood pool, the Spirit Array arranged at its bottom, how the various bones had combined into living skeletons with the help of the herbs and vital essence supplied by the already living Bone Race masters, giving rise to new Bone Race clansmen.

These newly born Bone Race clansmen were extremely fragile and had been easily destroyed by his attack just now, but each of them, without doubt, had the aura of a Transcendent Realm cultivator. It could be said that as long as they were given enough time, these fresh Bone Race clansmen would all become true Transcendents, moreover incredibly difficult to kill Transcendents.

“Hmph!” Ke Luo coldly snorted, “Whether you saw it or not isn’t important, you’re going to die today anyway!”

Yang Kai grinned, “When I came a moment ago, I heard you shouting something about dominating this world. Do you think that with a few extra Transcendents you’d be able to achieve such a lofty goal?”

Ke Luo shot Yang Kai a mocking look, not showing the slightest signs of nervousness, not taking any kind of offensive action, simply using his Divine Sense to block the space around Yang Kai to prevent him from using his Star Shuttle to escape as he lightly said, “A few extra Transcendents? The only reason for that is because this place is too barren so the newly born members of my clan can only reach the Transcendent Realm.”

“You mean you can directly create Saint Realm masters?” Yang Kai’s face sank.

Ke Luo laughed and replied, “As long as we kill enough experts and obtain enough high-grade flesh and blood as well as the matching high-grade herbs, what’s so difficult about creating Saints?”

Yang Kai’s face paled involuntarily.

He had far underestimated the strangeness of this race, never having expected such unfathomable creatures to exist.

However, one thing that gave Yang Kai some solace was that the price to perform this ritual was not small.

From what he had seen, the blood pool just how had an incredible amount of herbs, bones, flesh, and blood in it. It was likely it had contained the remains of most of Water Spirit Temple’s two thousand cultivators, but that had only been enough to give birth to about a hundred Bone Race clansmen.

“Enough nonsense, hand over that Star Shuttle and as a reward, I’ll let you choose a comfortable way to die,” Ke Luo remarked with impatience.

“Let me ask you one last question, if you can answer it, I’ll give this Star Shuttle to you!” Yang Kai said flatly.

“You’re not qualified to talk to me about conditions!” Ke Luo said disdainfully, “With your pitiful strength, I can take your life before you even blink!”

“Go ahead and try, see if I can’t destroy this Star Shuttle before I die!” Yang Kai replied boldly, gripping the Star Shuttle in his hand tighter as he pushed his True Qi, putting on a posture of perishing together.

Ke Luo’s expression finally changed, a hint of anxiety appearing on his face. Yang Kai’s words managed to strike at a sore point.

Star Shuttles were indeed extremely common in the vast Star Field; in fact, when they first came to Tong Xuan Realm, his clan had a lot of Star Shuttles with them, but after thousands of years without physiques, unable to nourish these artifacts, all their Star Shuttles had already become irrevocably damaged and unusable.

The Star Shuttle in Yang Kai’s hand was probably the only one left in all of Tong Xuan Realm.

If they wanted to leave Tong Xuan Realm and return to their Star Field in the future, they absolutely needed a Star Shuttle.

That was why Ke Luo was so interested in Yang Kai’s Flying Heavens Shuttle, without it, they would forever be stranded here.

“Young man, there’s no need to be impulsive, everything is open to discussion!” Ke Luo’s complexion became bad as his green eyes flashed a hint of coldness, swearing to himself that as soon as he got his hands on this Star Shuttle, he would make Yang Kai taste the world’s most brutal torture!

“Are you willing to talk now?”

“Ask your question!”

“That glacier-covered region with a gateway leading to the Starry Sky, where did the people who lived there go?”

“You mean those people who all cultivated Ice Attribute Arts?” Ke Luo’s green eyes flickered.

“Yes, tell me where they went!”

“What kind of relationship do you have with them?” Ke Luo didn’t answer immediately and asked a question of his own instead.

“Don’t spout any nonsense with me otherwise I’ll crush this Star Shuttle right here and now, making you forever unable to obtain it!” Yang Kai shouted.

Anger flashed across Ke Luo’s face and he was on the verge of erupting but somehow he managed to hold himself back and coldly state, “Most of them died, the rest fled!”

“Fled where?”

“The Starry Sky!”

“Bullshit!” Yang Kai’s expression became fierce as he shouted, “You think I know nothing of the Starry Sky’s mysteries? With the pressure there, besides experts on your level, none can survive travelling through the Starry Sky! Don’t think you can lie to me, I’ve been to the Starry Sky more than twice!”

Ke Luo couldn’t help showing a look of surprise at Yang Kai’s words, apparently not having expected this weak youth to possess such experience or boldness.

The Starry Sky was not a place an ordinary person dared to explore.

Shrugging his shoulders, Ke Luo grinned, “If you don’t believe me there’s nothing I can do about it. They really fled to the Starry Sky because... they also had a Star Shuttle in their hands!”

“They also had one?” Yang Kai was startled, but soon understood. Ice Sect had fought many battles with the Bone Race before, so it wouldn’t be impossible for them to have obtained a Star Shuttle.

If they used a Star Shuttle, they really could flee to the Starry Sky without worrying about the danger.

Ke Luo’s words were possible!

“How many of them escaped?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

“You said you’d only ask one question,” Ke Luo coldly snorted.

“I changed my mind!”

Ke Luo grit his teeth as sent of hate-filled stare towards Yang Kai and shouted, “Six! Five Saints and a Third Order Transcendent!”

“Six...” Yang Kai whispered, silently calculating before asking, “How many women were there?”

“Three, that Third Order Transcendent included.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai chuckled, his voice initially quite quiet but soon growing louder and louder until finally it boomed like rolling thunder, as if he had just heard the world’s funniest joke, his originally nervous look suddenly relaxing as a healthy glow appeared on his face.

He was certain the Transcendent Realm cultivator was Su Yan! Her cultivation had really not fallen behind his own.

Finally, Yang Kai’s tight heartstring finally unwound and he let out a long sigh of relief.

“If you’re satisfied, give me that Star Shuttle!” Ke Luo reached out again and said to Yang Kai in a gloomy manner. Obviously, he had decided that if Yang Kai tried to pull any tricks here he would immediately take action.

“If I refuse, what are you going to do?” Yang Kai snickered as he directed a contemptuous look towards him.

“Then you’ll die! Miserably at that!” Ke Luo warned coldly, “Don’t think you can use that Star Shuttle to escape, that’s pointless. Star Field cultivators have many ways to restrain the speed of Star Shuttles. In the end, it’s just a simple artifact used for fast travel!”

“I don’t need to use this Star Shuttle!” Yang Kai shook his head before waving his hand through the air.

As he did so, it was as if something had split open.

A jet black tear suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai waved goodbye to Ke Luo lightly before stepping through this crack and disappearing.

“Tearing space!” Ke Luo’s face changed dramatically, a tidal wave like Spiritual Energy rushing out from his towards the crack in an attempt to stop Yang Kai from escaping.

However, the entrance to The Void closed in an instant, causing Ke Lou’s Divine Sense attack to hit nothing but air.

Staring at the spot where Yang Kai disappeared, Ke Luo’s expression fluctuated as a bitter taste filled his mouth.

Never had he anticipated that this weak looking youth would actually know how to tear space like this. Such an ability was not something an ordinary expert could master.

The Void was even more dangerous than the vast Starry Sky. The slightest carelessness would leave a cultivator forever stranded inside, unable to find their way out!

“Sir, should we pursue him?” One of the nearby Bone Race masters turned and asked Ke Luo. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“With no clue where he went, how do you intend to chase him?!” Ke Luo angrily roared, “Collect a new batch of materials! Word of my clan’s return will soon spread, we must prepare!”

“Yes!” The numerous Bone Race masters simultaneously flew off in all directions.

A thousand kilometres away, Yang Kai reappeared, a heavy look upon his face.

Although he had not confirmed that Su Yan was safe, this bit of good news was enough to lift his spirits. However, the Bone Race suddenly recovering brought Yang Kai great pressure, especially after he witnessed all the peculiarities of this race, each one of which made them seem more and more difficult to handle.

With them possessing a few dozen Saints and over a hundred Transcendents, no single force in this world could contend with them.

The worst part though was that by collecting raw flesh and blood, and mixing them with a variety of herbs, they could create more of their own race!

As long as they were given enough time to amass their strength, they really would be able to dominate the world.

This was a fatal infection that had to be purged as soon as possible, otherwise, Nine Heavens Holy Land and his friends and relatives from the Great Han Dynasty would be implicated sooner or later.

Yang Kai faintly felt that the appearance of the Bone Race was even related to the final words left behind by Great Demon God’s Soul Clone and the secrets that were hidden in the Demon Capital!

Summoning the Flying Heavens Shuttle, Yang Kai flew forward while deep in thought.

Arriving at the mountain valley where he had left Shui Yun and Shui Ling, Yang Kai went down to investigate and found that they were still waiting here.

When she saw Yang Kai return, Shui Ling rushed over, a thick look of concern on her face, “You really came back safely, it’s been almost half a month already.”

Clear admiration appeared on Shui Yun’s expression, “Holy Master Yang’s boldness appears to have been well-founded. Did you manage to obtain some gains?”

“En, a few,” Yang Kai nodded, “Why are you still here?”

“We were waiting for you!” Shui Ling replied.

“Then do you plan to depart now? Where do you want to go, I can send you anywhere,” Yang Kai said as to the father and daughter pair.

Shui Yun’s expression immediately became bitter and helpless, “Water Spirit Temple has been destroyed, so we currently don’t have any place to go.”

Shui Ling also wore a miserable expression and was clearly quite depressed. Water Spirit Temple was their home, but now it was completely occupied by the Bone Race; moreover, her fellow two thousand disciples had all been slaughtered, even Blue Water City had not escaped this calamity.

It could be said that in this big world, there was no place where they had a home to go to.
