“Someone, please find this guest a seat!” Wen Zi Shan waved his hand as he took a breath of relief in his heart and mind. Regardless of the situation, it was enough as long as Xue Zheng Mao didn’t cause more trouble.

“There’s no rush!” Yang Kai, who had remained silent throughout the whole intrusion, suddenly spoke out.

Wen Zi Shan shot a stunned look at him.

Wiping the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, Yang Kai continued, “May I ask Temple Master, is there a backup for the Sacrificial Beast?”

Wen Zi Shan laughed bitterly as he shook his head.

That Twelfth-Order Monster Beast was not easy to find and capture. If not, it wouldn’t be valuable at all. That was especially so with such tight time constraints. Where would they go to find another one? The Golden-Backed Heavenly Ape that was just killed had been personally caught by Wen Zi Shan in a desolate mountain range tens of thousands of kilometres away.

It was a pity that it was killed by Xue Zheng Mao before Yang Kai could take action. This had caused this Grand Canonization Ceremony to turn into an exceedingly awkward situation.

Yang Kai lowered his head, “Since there’s no backup, I have no choice but to commit this offense.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wen Zi Shan’s heart jumped as he subconsciously blurted out a question, “What are you thinking?”

Before he could finish saying those words, he suddenly saw Yang Kai’s body flicker, before disappearing from its original position. Wen Zi Shan’s expression changed greatly as he could faintly guess Yang Kai’s intentions. Turning his head, he looked towards Xue Zheng Mao and indeed saw Yang Kai’s silhouette suddenly appear before him, sweeping his sword down towards the latter. A terrifying hundred-metre long sword wave coated the edge of the sword, appearing as though it wanted to tear the world apart.

Xue Zheng Mao was also shocked by Yang Kai’s actions. Raising his hand, he sent out a palm. Vigorous Emperor Qi gushed forth, whipping up howling winds, shattering the sword wave while Xue Zheng Mao’s figure shook slightly.

“Boy, you dare ambush this Old Master!” Xue Zheng Mao roared out, his nose askew in fury. He was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, and furthermore, an Elder of Star Soul Palace! Yet, this youth dared to ambush him without saying even a single word?

Fortunately, he was able to react quickly enough to block the attack. If not, he might have really suffered from it. Regardless, he had been ambushed in full view of this vast audience, which was a huge blow to Xue Zheng Mao’s dignity, resulting in his anger bursting through the roof.

“Pay a man back with his own coin!” Yang Kai grinned, allowing the sword to leave his grip from the recoil of Xue Zheng Mao’s palm while he rapidly formed a set of profound hand seals. Time Principles surged around Yang Kai and as that happened, everyone present instantly felt as though time had stopped flowing, to the point where their thoughts froze for a moment.

While unleashing the Time Flies Seal, golden light blossomed from Yang Kai’s right eye as a lotus bud flashed within.

The enraged Xue Zheng Mao’s body turned rigid while a sharp pain surfaced in his head. Right before his eyes, a gigantic lotus flower started to bloom, causing waves of shock to surge in his heart. How could he have known that he would be struck by Yang Kai’s move the instant he relaxed his guard?

What’s more, this Soul Secret Technique seemed to be exceptionally powerful, not something a mere First-Order Emperor Realm should be able to unleash.

Biting the tip of his tongue, Xue Zheng Mao used the spike in pain to snap awake. Unleashing the full might of his Spiritual Energy, he resisted against the influence of the Blossoming Lotus Secret Technique. As he regained his clarity, the gigantic blossoming lotus had disappeared from his sight.

As he raised his head, cold sweat erupted throughout his body; in that instant that he was hampered, Yang Kai’s seal was on the brink of smashing against his chest.

Although he did not know how powerful this technique was, it gave him an exceedingly strong feeling of unease. He attempted to muster up his defence, only to discover that his thoughts had slowed immensely, to the point that his actions turned sluggish and uncoordinated.

With an explosive roar, the might of his Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation erupted in full force as he threw out his palm. Nevertheless, before he could make any move, that seal had already pressed onto his chest.

He, who had just regained control over his body and mind, was frozen once more…

At the same time, Xue Zheng Mao’s retaliatory strike also smashed against Yang Kai. Everyone present could see a visible depression appearing in Yang Kai’s chest as clear sounds of bones cracking rang out, followed by Yang Kai’s face losing all colour.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai forcefully kept his silence while grabbing his Myriads Sword again and slashing towards Xue Zheng Mao’s chest.

Chi…

With a flash of his sword, Yang Kai’s body flickered before he reappeared at his earlier position. His body trembled slightly as his face turned into a pale shade of white.

With a grunt, Yang Kai’s face flushed red as he forcefully swallowed the blood that had surged up from within his chest.

This series of actions was simply too shocking for the crowd to keep up with. Furthermore, due to the interference as a result of Yang Kai’s Time Flies Seal, the audience only managed to come back to their senses after Yang Kai had retreated. Looks of shock and doubt covered their faces as they stared at this youth as if they had just seen a ghost.

Even Wen Zi Shan had a look of shock on his face, while Xiao Yu Yang had stood up abruptly, a light of disbelief filling his eyes.

“I sacrifice the blood of my enemy to the Heavens!” As Yang Kai roared, he waved his Myriads Sword, causing a streak of blood mist to erupt from the sword, filling a large stretch of the surroundings. “The ceremony is complete!”

Chii…

At this same time, blood abruptly spurted out from Xue Zheng Mao’s chest. As that audience raised their heads to look over, all of them sucked in a mouthful of cold air as they noticed the existence of a half metre long bloody wound on Xue Zheng Mao’s chest….

Xue Zheng Mao also appeared to be unable to believe what had happened, that he had actually been injured by a First-Order Emperor! His entire being seemed to freeze at that point in space and time as he stared blankly at the wound in his chest, where blood continued to spew out from.

An instant later, his entire body trembled as he extended his hand towards his chest. Suppressing the flow of blood from his wound, Xu Zheng Mao’s eyes turned scarlet with fury as he glared towards Yang Kai and roared, “Boy, you court death!”

He had suffered unfathomable humiliation by actually being injured by a series of moves from a First-Order Emperor Realm Junior! This was an utter embarrassment! Admittedly, he had underestimated his opponent; however, that did nothing to diminish the fact that this boy surnamed Kai was extraordinary. If it was any other First-Order Emperor, it would have been impossible for Xue Zheng Mao to suffer any injury at all, no matter how much he underestimated his foe.

Nevertheless, how could Xue Zheng Mao endure losing so much face before so many of the Southern Territory’s Emperors?

Murderous intent surged up and exploded forth as Xue Zheng Mao was truly engulfed with rage.

Right at this moment, Wen Zi Shan had appeared right before Xue Zheng Mao.

Although he was also shocked to see that Yang Kai was actually able to injure Xue Zheng Mao in that instant, he knew that Yang Kai had paid quite a high price to do so. Xue Zheng Mao’s retaliatory strike had definitely caused damage to Yang Kai’s organs. Furthermore, Yang Kai seemed to have used a few extraordinarily powerful Secret Techniques in succession just to injure Xue Zheng Mao. If Yang Kai were to engage in a head-on fight against Xue Zheng Mao, Wen Zi Shan did not favour Yang Kai’s chance of victory.

“Move!” Xue Zheng Mao roared out as he descended completely into madness.

Wen Zi Shan replied, “Elder Xue, you were the one who ambushed first. This forced Elder Yang into such circumstances. Being the Senior, you aren’t that small-minded and petty, are you?”

Xue Zheng Mao’s face turned black as he immediately thought back about the words ‘pay a man back with his own coin’ that Yang Kai had said earlier. That was indeed the case. When he had arrived, he had ambushed Yang Kai without any warning at all. Therefore, he was in no position to stop people from ambushing him back, right?

Nevertheless, he would absolutely not let this matter end here. Otherwise, he would not be able to soothe the anger that was erupting in his chest.

Turning his head around, he looked to his side and shouted, “Elder Xiao!”

Xiao Yu Yang let off a sigh before taking a few steps forward and appearing by Xue Zheng Mao’s side.

The situation had reached the point where Xiao Yu Yang was no longer able to watch from the sidelines. This was no longer just about Xue Zheng Mao’s face; it was now a matter of Star Soul Palace’s face. Therefore, he needed to stand by Xue Zheng Mao’s side.

“Hold Wen Zi Shan back. This Old Master will end that little brat’s life!” Xue Zheng Mao transmitted.

Xiao Yu Yang replied, “It won’t be a problem to hold Wen Zi Shan back. However… you won’t be able to kill that boy.”

“Are you looking down on this Old Master?” Anger flared once again within Xue Zheng Mao’s chest, akin to a boiling volcano that could erupt at any moment, “The earlier matter only occurred due to this Old Master’s carelessness.”

“I’m not looking down on you, but that boy is proficient in the Dao of Space. Without a way to seal the surrounding space, no one can capture him!”

“The Dao of Space!” Xue Zheng Mao’s pupils contracted as a feeling of helplessness gushed out uncontrollably from the depths of his heart.

Being an Elder of Star Soul Palace, he was abundantly clear what kind of abilities a cultivator proficient in the Dao of Space possessed. In the past, that fellow Li Wu Yi had offended the Flower Shadow Great Emperor, resulting in him being chased down by the Great Emperor personally. In the end, he still managed to escape, all due to his mastery of the Dao of Space!

Later, due to the intervention of the Martial Beast Great Emperor, Flower Shadow Great Emperor eventually pardoned him. To this day, Li Wu Yi was still living a good life, moving around without fetters on Spirit Beast Island.

If Yang Kai was truly proficient in the Dao of Space, Xue Zheng Mao would really be unable to capture the former.

The frown on Xue Zheng Mao’s face grew deeper, as he felt stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Two Star Soul Palace Elders stood side by side, causing the audience’s expression to change. Wen Zi Shan’s expression regained its earlier solemn look, while the many Emperors from Azure Sun Temple came up to surround Yang Kai, vigilant looks present on their faces.

No one had expected the Grand Canonization Ceremony to devolve into such a mess.

“Elder Xue, Elder Xiao, what are you two planning on doing?” Wen Zi Shan said in a deep voice, “Although our Azure Sun Temple cannot rival your Star Soul Palace, we will not be casually bullied.”

Xiao Yu Yang did not reply and neither did Xue Zheng Mao, who continued to glare angrily at Yang Kai.

The guests present for the ceremony were feeling extremely nervous, afraid that both parties would really start a grand battle. Once a conflict arose between Star Soul Palace and Azure Sun Temple, it would shake the entire Southern Territory, with no advantage for any party present.

A suffocating atmosphere engulfed the entire scene, with sweat drenching the backs of all of present, from Juniors to Elders.

“Stop!”

At that moment, a gentle voice suddenly rang out from the horizon, bringing along with it a mysterious power that immediately caused everyone’s tense nerves to relax.

Right at the instant when the voice rang out, Xiao Chen snapped out of the complicated gaze he was using to look at Yang Kai as he looked over with gleaming eyes.

A streak of pure light came shooting over before a young woman so beautiful that she seemed as though she did not belong to the mundane world appeared. With her long black hair tied up in a neat bun, leaving a few strands that draped down before her chest and a yellow dress that accentuated her exquisite appearance, this young beauty slowly floated down towards Myriad Saints Peak.

“Princess!” Xiao Chen shouted out in pleasant surprise.

Who would be unsure of her identity after hearing Xiao Chen’s words? Shock filled the hearts of the guests as they all stood up in succession, cupping their fists respectfully, “Greetings, Princess Lan Xun!”

The older Emperors were still able to remain calm due to the long years they spent tempering their wills, toning down their reactions to a shocked gasp upon spotting Lan Xun’s exquisite beauty. On the contrary, the youths that had followed their Elder here, be it male or female, proceeded to gawk at Lan Xun in a daze. This was especially obvious among the males, as obvious looks of infatuation covered their faces. This was not something they could prevent, as Lan Xun’s dazzling brilliance had enraptured their souls.
