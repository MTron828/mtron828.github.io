Feeling the unique sensation of Principle Strength, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed and his expression became more solemn.

The old woman saying that this Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre was a failed Dao Source Grade artifact was definitely correct, as an ordinary Origin King Grade artifact couldn’t have such an effect.

Of course, this was also only possible because Lu Bai Chuan’s own cultivation had reached a certain height, his Saint Qi being fully transformed into Source Qi while he had likely touched upon the mysteries of the Dao Source Realm and Principle Strength.

All of this was essential as an average Third-Order Origin King would not be able to produce such a result even if they had the Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre.

The Principles inspired by the sabre were naturally Ice Principles, and although the effect was quite subtle, even somewhat faint, it was still the domain of Dao Source Realm masters. With this artifact in hand, Lu Bai Chuan’s combat power had risen to a new level!

*Kacha...*

There were now faint signs of the surrounding space being frozen, and with Lu Bai Chuan at the centre, layers of frost began to spread outwards.

The Patriarch of the Lu Family suddenly let out a great roar and with a single step, disappeared from where he stood and then re-appeared in front of Yang Kai, slashing out with the sabre in his hands.

The blade flashed as it released an extremely powerful aura, one that seemed completely overwhelming and unavoidable. Moreover, with the Ice Principles emanating from the blade sealing the surrounding space, there was no way Yang Kai should have been able to avoid this blow.

“Hahahaha!” Lu Bai Chuan laughed madly as a happy expression filled his face, “Like an ant trying to stop a cart, such overconfidence!”

He was completely certain that his attack had succeeded in dispatching Yang Kai, because he had already killed several Third-Order Origin Kings with the very same move in the past.

However, in the next instant, his eyes suddenly shrank as he stared forward in amazement.

Standing before him, Yang Kai, who should have been split in half without being able to resist, actually remained completely unscathed, with no trace of any kind of wounds on his body. In his hands at this moment was a verdant coloured long sword that had no edge. From this sword, a sort of snake had emerged and was even now blocking the terrifying slash the Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre had released.

The Ice Principles which should have rendered any Origin King powerless didn’t seem to affect Yang Kai at all. In fact, with just a flick of his wrist, the verdant long sword released a strange power that instantly disintegrated the Ice Principles and scattered them to the wind.

“You...” Lu Bai Chuan’s face changed wildly as he called out sharply, “You can also utilize Principle Strength?”

Principle Strength was the ultimate power that governed the world itself. In this world, only those who had reached the Dao Source Realm could touch upon this strength while Origin Kings could not use it at all. Lu Bai Chuan had only managed to inspire traces of Principle Strength thanks to his special Silver Moon Purple Frost Sabre, but now it seemed Yang Kai could do the same, or possibly even better.

Seeing Yang Kai easily disperse his killing blow, Lu Bai Chuan realized that his opponent had surpassed ninety-nine percent of all peak-level Origin Kings and was likely on the verge of breaking through to the Dao Source Realm.

Without the support of Principle Strength, Yang Kai could easily handle an attack from an Origin King Grade High-Rank artifact.

“Boy, you’ve been playing the pig to eat a tiger, curse you!” Lu Bai Chuan roared indignantly.

Yang Kai laughed, “Blame your dog eyes for looking down on people too much.”

As he spoke, he pushed the Dragon Bone Sword in his hand forward with force and sent Lu Bai Chuan crashing to the ground like a meteorite.

Upon landing though, Lu Bai Chuan immediately steadied himself and formed a seal with his hands. The earth began to rumble and in a series of bangs, three earth dragons shot up from the ground, roaring as they rose up to attack Yang Kai.

“Earth Dragon Dance!”

Lu Bai Chuan shouted sharply before he swiftly turned around, ignoring the life or death of the other Lu Family members, and fled.

“Sir Yang, he’s going to run!” Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly shouted softly.

This little girl, who was just a First-Order Saint King, could not contribute anything to the battle between the Lu and Zhang Families and could only hide in the back and observe from a distance. When she saw Lu Bai Chuan flee though, she could not help calling out.

“He won’t get away!” Yang Kai snorted coldly before he slashed forward with his Dragon Bone Sword, chopping the three earth dragons into dust before his body flickered and disappeared.

Although he did not have any grudge with the Lu Family, he had an agreement with Zhang Gao Xuan and against such a shameless man like Lu Bai Chuan, Yang Kai had no qualms about acting ruthlessly.

Lu Bai Chuan using these three earth dragons seemed to only be an act to buy time, but it did not play any role.

By the time Yang Kai appeared again, he had already caught up and swung out his Dragon Bone Sword. Yang Kai was about to deliver a fatal blow to Lu Bai Chuan, but suddenly, the Lu Family Patriarch, who seemed to be fleeing with all his might, turned around and flashed a vicious, victorious grin.

In the next instant, he flicked his wrist towards Yang Kai.

A strange, subtle power fluctuation propagated.

Yang Kai’s brow rose sharply as his expression suddenly became weird.

Instantly, he reached forward with his hand and grabbed the air.

“Hahahaha...” Lu Bai Chuan stopped, as if he was watching a joke and smiled at Yang Kai mockingly, “Seems you can’t wait to court death!”

“Really?” Yang Kai glanced at him in a sidelong manner as he twirled something in his fingers lightly.

Lu Bai Chuan’s smile suddenly stiffened as his face began to twitch and a voice filled with shock called out, “Impossible, that is impossible! There’s no way you could break the Secret Technique this old master spent half his life studying!”

“So this is what you were relying on and running away was just an act to get me to lower my guard?” As Yang Kai spoke, he clenched his fist and the subtle energy fluctuation lingering around it flickered and disappeared.

Seeing this, Lu Bai Chuan’s face really paled this time as he realized he was completely not Yang Kai’s opponent. If he continued the fight, he would definitely die, so without hesitation, he immediately fled without another word.

“Interesting, it turned out to be Space Force,” Yang Kai did not chase immediately this time and instead just observed Lu Bai Chuan’s disappearing figure.

Just now, Lu Bai Chuan had lured him close by pretending to escape and then launched a sneak attack, one that was actually comprised of Space Force! Although this attack was nowhere near as powerful as Yang Kai’s Moon Blade, it could at least be considered a condensed Space Needle.

Space Force was incredibly difficult to guard against, and if one was caught off guard, Lu Bai Chuan’s technique might really have been able to hit its mark.

Once that happened, a tiny Space Needle could really kill.

Unfortunately for Lu Bai Chuan, he had actually tried to use Space Force against Yang Kai. How was that any different from using a blunt kitchen knife to attack a man holding a peerless sword?

Glancing back, the battle between the Lu and Zhang Families was in a state of chaos. Although the Zhang Family was composed entirely of orphans and widows now, and the number of masters on their side was lower, each of them fought without fear of death, each of their moves fierce and resolute. This was especially true of the old woman and middle-aged beauty who were First-Order Origin Kings. Their reckless assault, which completely ignored their own safety, caused great hardship to the Lu Family masters.

However, in the end, the difference in strength was obvious and if things continued as they were, it would only be a matter of time before the Lu Family won.

But now that Lu Bai Chuan was unable to compete with Yang Kai for even half a cup of tea’s time and was forced to escape, everything was different.

This shocked the rest of the Lu Family members and they lost all will to fight, only wanting to flee from this place as soon as possible.

Yang Kai saw this, flicked his wrist, and sent out a dozen Golden Blood Threads which swiftly transformed into three golden spears that flew out and pierced through the three Lu Family Origin King Realm cultivators, causing them severe injuries.

“The rest of the mixed fish are yours to deal with, I’m going to pursue Lu Bai Chuan,” Yang Kai did not finish all of the enemies off and instead just took out the three First-Order Origin Kings before turning and chasing after Lu Bai Chuan.

“Many thanks, Little Brother!” The old woman was overjoyed and quickly rallied the rest of the Zhang Family to battle.

With the three First-Order Origin Kings already having lost the ability to fight, now was the perfect time to take revenge with their own hands, so how could the old woman hesitate? While directing her anger and hatred at the enemy, she was also immensely grateful to Yang Kai.

...

To the northwest of Maplewood City, a thousand kilometres away from the Zhang Family Manor, another large complex stood. Above the gates, the words ‘Lu Mansion’ were written boldly. Obviously, this was the residence of the Lu Family.

Inside the Lu Mansion, lavish decorations had been put up while everyone was continuing with preparations for the marriage ceremony, all of them completely unaware that catastrophe was approaching.

It was not until Lu Bai Chuan suddenly appeared in the main hall of the mansion that a few of the Lu Family cultivators realized something was wrong.

“Patriarch, didn’t you go to the Zhang Family to welcome the new bride? Why have you suddenly returned alone? The auspicious hour has not yet arrived,” A Lu Family Origin Returning Realm cultivator asked curiously.

“Pass the order, make everyone pack up everything of value with all haste, we must leave here as soon as possible!” After Lu Bai Chuan gave these words, he did not explain any more and immediately rushed deeper into the mansion.

“What?” A few of the Lu Family leaders looked at each other in confusion.

However, although Lu Bai Chuan did not leave much information, all of them were able to infer from his expression that something bad would soon happen; what’s more, they did not dare disobey the Patriarch’s order so after a quick discussion they immediately began carrying out his command.

In the backyard of the Lu Family, in front of a secret room, Lu Bai Chuan hurriedly took out a token and opened a few dozen barriers before diving inside.

This secret room was not very big, but it was where the Lu Family had stored its accumulated treasures over the years. Almost all of the Lu Family’s Source Crystals were also stored.

At the centre of this secret room, there was a pitch-black round jade suspended in the air, slowly rotating, and from time to time giving off a profound but indescribable light. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as Lu Bai Chuan rushed into the secret room, he hurriedly moved to this round jade. It seemed that in this secret room, only this round jade was of any worth to him.

Just as he was reaching out to retrieve this black jade though, he suddenly turned around and shouted, “Who!”

Because at that moment, he noticed another living being behind him.

“Huh...”

At the same time, a mutter of surprise left Yang Kai’s lips as his figure appeared behind Lu Bai Chuan, a look of astonishment on his face.
