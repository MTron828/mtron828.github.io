“Proprietress!” Yang Kai walked over and saluted her, “Are you all ready to relocate to Void Star City?”

The Proprietress asked with a smile, “What do you mean, relocate?”

“Then…” Yang Kai was puzzled.

Bai Qi said with a smile, “Proprietress has left First Inn, so she’s a free person now.”

Yang Kai became startled upon hearing that. Initially, when he saw that the Proprietress had brought all her usual shop-hands with her, he thought that she was going to open a First Inn branch in Void Star City, so it came as a great surprise to hear she had actually left First Inn.

“We’d like to join Void Land. Will you welcome us?” The Proprietress looked smilingly at Yang Kai.

Of course, Yang Kai hurriedly nodded, “Of course I welcome you all. Why wouldn’t I? You can even be the Lord of Void Land if you want, Proprietress.”

“No thanks.” The Proprietress rolled her eyes, “I’ve finally relieved myself of old burdens, so why would I take on even heavier responsibilities. Don’t even think about it.”

Yang Kai grinned, “What kind of position do you want, then? Just name it.”

The Proprietress shook her head, “I’m not going to take up any official position right now. Just prepare a serene place for me as I’m going to enter seclusion soon.”

Yang Kai turned solemn, “Are you going to attempt to break through to the Seventh-Order?”

Since Golden Rainbow Province and Boundless Altar were destroyed, her heart demon oath had been resolved as well; hence, there were no more obstacles in her way to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. However, she had lost some of her heritage in the Shadowless Cave Heaven, so if she wanted to make it to the Seventh-Order, she would have to spend some time recovering from those losses.

The Proprietress nodded with a serious expression, “I’ve been stuck in the Sixth-Order for a long time now. It’s about time to ascend to the Seventh-Order.”

A worried Yang Kai asked, “Do you have the confidence to achieve it?”

Ascending to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm was no laughing matter. Although there was only a difference of one Order between the Sixth-Order and the Seventh-Order, she was trying to cross the gulf between the Mid-Rank to the High-Rank. This was a process of sublimation in the Open Heaven Realm and the risk an Open Heaven Realm Master had to bear when attempting this was as great as when he or she was first attempting to reach the Open Heaven Realm from the Emperor Realm.

The consequences were deadly if they failed.

Many Open Heaven Realm Masters had lost their lives during this ascension over the years. For cultivators in this realm, every ascension was a perilous trial. Once they succeeded, they would transform into even more powerful beings; however, once they failed, death was all but certain.

“I do have some confidence, but when it comes to a matter like this… It is ultimately up to the Heavens to decide my fate.” The Proprietress replied calmly.

Yang Kai nodded, “Since you’ve made a decision, I’ll say no more. If you need any resources, just tell us right away. Yue He will prepare everything for you.”

The Proprietress replied with a smile, “I have all the resources I require prepared already. I’ve been a shopkeeper of First Inn for centuries, so I’ve collected some good stuff along the way.”

“That’s great.” After giving it a thought, Yang Kai fished out a jade bottle and passed it to her, “Take this as it might be useful in case of an emergency.”

The Proprietress took a glance at it and realised that the jade bottle looked familiar. Soon, she recalled what it was.

After Yang Kai left the Blood Monster Cave Heaven back then, he passed her this jade bottle, which contained an Innate Open Heaven Pill born in the Universe Furnace. Blood Monster Divine Monarch should have obtained this pill at some point far in the past.

This Open Heaven Pill was totally different from the ones refined by Alchemists and was innumerable times more valuable. Although one Open Heaven Pill seemed like nothing compared to the millions that flowed through Void Star City each day, many people would start wars just to try to snatch this single pill if word of its existence got out.

At that time, Yang Kai thought that this pill could help the Proprietress break through to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, but she turned him down. As long as her heart demon oath wasn’t resolved, even an Innate Open Heaven Pill would be useless to her.

Now that she was ready to ascend to the Seventh-Order, however, this pill was the only thing Yang Kai could offer that could be of some possible help.

After giving it a thought, the Proprietress took the jade bottle and said with a smile, “I’ll give it back to you if I don’t need it.”

Yang Kai replied with a straight face, “I’ll await your good news.”

Back then, the Proprietress directly ascended to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so her aptitude was truly exceptional. Supposedly, given her aptitude, there shouldn’t be a problem when she attempted to rise to the Seventh-Order. However, she reckoned that she’d better be careful.

The Proprietress then suddenly asked, “Have you heard that there’ll be a Dao Theory Assembly in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven in a few months?”

“You’re aware of it?” Upon finishing his words, Yang Kai smiled helplessly. First Inn was in the business of gathering information. Basically, everyone was aware of it now, so why would the Proprietress not know it?

“I’m not deaf, so why would I not be aware of such a major event?” The Proprietress shot him a glare, “Qu Hua Shang is one of the Core Disciples of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and she has the right to succeed the Sect Master in the future. However, since she has made a mistake, she has to make it up to the other Cave Heavens and Paradises. The Dao Theory Assembly is the punishment for her.”

Yang Kai sighed, “It’s all because of me that Senior Sister Qu is being punished.”

On the side, Yue He asked, “Young Master, was it because…”

Yang Kai nodded solemnly, “All 36 Cave Heavens and 72 Paradises have always been united, so internal divisions are not permitted. Senior Sister Qu broke that taboo.”

Yue He exclaimed, “What should we do then?”

Yang Kai said, “I’m going to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven soon.” Then, he gazed at the Proprietress in puzzlement, “Are there really no grudges between the 36 Cave Heavens and 72 Paradises. Why is there even such a taboo?”

The Proprietress explained, “There are definitely grudges between them, but they have their own ways of settling such problems. If some of them are killed without anyone knowing about it, no one can say anything; however, since the other Cave Heavens and Paradises know the details of this incident, those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven have to make it up to them. That is the rule.”

“What rubbish rule is that?” Yang Kai was incensed.

“Since you’re the cause of it, I suppose you should head to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Given your current strength, there shouldn’t be anyone below the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm who is your opponent. However, you’d still better be careful. Although the disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would frequently look for suitable partners, a disciple like Qu Hua Shang is very rare. Many talented people will gather together in this Dao Theory Assembly, so the people from the Cave Heavens and Paradises would naturally take part as well.”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was startled for a moment, “Those from the Cave Heavens and Paradises would join as well? I heard that the partners of the Core Disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would have to marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Are those Cave Heavens and Paradises willing to let their disciples join another Sect?”

The Proprietress replied with a smile, “The Core Disciples are definitely not going to join this Dao Theory Assembly; however, the heritages of the Cave Heavens and Paradises are ample. Besides the Core Disciples, they still have other disciples that could join another Sect. The effort will be worthwhile if they can become closer allies with Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

Yang Kai nodded. Although a disciple would have to get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, he would not sever ties with his Master Sect entirely. If his Master Sect fell into trouble in the future, that disciple, and the connection he made, would be of some help.

“There’s one thing I’m worried about, Proprietress.” Yang Kai appeared anxious.

“What is it?” she asked.

Yang Kai replied, “The Cave Heavens and Paradises were already trying to suppress me before I even ascended to the Open Heaven Realm. Now that I’m an Open Heaven Realm Master, would some of them try to kill me if I show up in the outside world?”

He was already targeted by four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters outside the Shadowless Cave Heaven, and he was just an Emperor Realm cultivator at that time. Now that he was an Open Heaven Realm Master, it was probable that some of them would still want to kill him ruthlessly. Given the heritages of those Cave Heavens and Paradises, it would be easy for them to kill him unless he stayed in Void Land forever.

With two Divine Spirits residing in Void Land, the effort to kill him would simply be too great for the reward.

To his concerns, the Proprietress just said with a smile, “The reason they targeted you before your ascension was that they were worried you’d directly make it to the Seventh-Order, and their suppression has yielded some results. In their eyes, you’re just a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so you’re no longer a threat to them. They have already nipped a potential threat in the bud, and a Fifth-Order Master is nothing to them.”

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened, “In that case, I’m now safer since I’ve ascended to the Open Heaven Realm.”

...

“That’s right.”

“There won’t be any problems then.” Yang Kai nodded.

After he chatted with the Proprietress for a while longer, he bid her farewell.

She was going to attempt to break through to the Seventh-Order soon, and no one else could help her with that. The only thing Yang Kai could give her was that Innate Open Heaven Pill.

This breakthrough would probably take her a long time; after all, she had to make up for the losses she had suffered in the Shadowless Cave Heaven first before she could attempt to reach the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

The Dao Theory Assembly was just two months away now, so Yang Kai had to set off immediately.

A few days later, he shot into the sky, and as a crack appeared in the Grand Array, he moved past it and dashed into the void.

He was on his own this time. Yue He initially wanted to tag along, but he had turned her down.

After all, he was now a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master that was significantly stronger than others in the same Order. In the entire 3,000 Worlds, only High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would be a threat to him now.

Even if he really came across any danger, he could easily flee since he was on his own.

Furthermore, the Dao Theory Assembly was an event to help get Qu Hua Shang a Husband. Yang Kai wasn’t even sure how he would handle the issue, so it would be inappropriate if he brought Yue He with him.

...

The journey was long and the void was dead silent, so Yang Kai just moved forward at lightning speed.

On a shattered Spirit Province just outside the Territory Gate of Void Territory stood an alluring lady. It seemed that she had been waiting there for a long time. When she finally saw Yang Kai moving past the Territory Gate, she snorted, “I suppose he can still be considered a responsible man.”

The person was Su Ying Xue, who had previously met up with Yang Kai.

Since Yang Kai had left Void Territory at this point, he should be heading to join the Dao Theory Assembly. That was the reason she sported a milder expression now. Then, she dashed towards the Territory Gate and tailed Yang Kai. After leaving the Territory Gate, she immediately sent a message to someone.

Looking up, she could only see a small dot in the distance as Yang Kai was already far away from her. She curved her lips into a smile and muttered, “I’ll give you one last test; after all, you have no right to marry Qu’er if you’re too weak.”

Meanwhile, Yang Kai was looking at the route in his Universe Chart and heading to the next Territory Gate.

Half a day later, he suddenly lifted his head as he could see a ray of light charging towards him rapidly.
