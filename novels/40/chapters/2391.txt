Man Kuai’s screams caused Yang Kai others to pale and they all released their Divine Sense to check the situation behind them.

When they saw what the situation was like, all of them could not help but gasp.

For some reason, Man Kuai’s hands were stuck to the Exotic Heavenly Gold stone slab, as if he was sucked onto it and couldn’t free himself no matter how hard he struggled. It was bad enough as it was, but the slab was swallowing his vitality at an incredible speed as well. This draining was at a rate that was visible to the naked eye, and soon, the originally inconspicuous-looking slab became blood red, emitting a sickening aura.

“Grandmaster, save me!” Man Kuai yelled as hard as he could, panicking. If he had known this stone slab was so strange, he would never have touched it, but it was too late to say anything now.

In just a few breaths, he could already feel his power weakening by half. If they waited a little longer, wouldn’t he be sucked dry?

Yang Kai and the others all turned to look at Sang De, wanting to know what he was going to do.

Sang De hurriedly said, “Hold on! This Old Master is on his way!”

As he said that, he rushed over to Man Kuai’s side. A short while later, a violent power fluctuation could be felt as if Sang De tried to rescue Man Kuai, but they couldn’t see the details of what was happening, the reason being that the onset of power introduced by Sang De disturbed the Divine Sense released by Yang Kai and the others to a great extent.

Not long after, Man Kuai’s voice faded away.

Sang De returned with a gloomy look on his face. When he reached them, he said with a sorrowful face, “Brother Man has... met with misfortune.”

The faces of both She Lan and Chen Fei changed, and they were all looking at Sang De with sombre looks in their eyes, but Yang Kai’s face was calm as water.

They knew how strong Man Kuai was, but to think a guy like that could die in just such a short period of time. He was definitely caught in some powerful seal or trap. If it were She Lan or Chen Fei, then they likely wouldn’t have fared any better.

“Damn it, there was a Spirit Devouring Grand Array hidden within that stone slab. This Old Master failed to detect it and caused Brother Man to suffer this unwarranted disaster. Truly a tragedy! How despicable!” Sang De lamented for a while, voice low as if he was in pain because of what happened to Man Kuai.

After a while, he looked up, “I hope what happened to Brother Man has not left any trauma on any of you!”

None of them spoke.

Nobody knew whether what happened to Man Kuai happened because Sang De truly failed to discover the Spirit Devouring Grand Array, or if he did discover it and kept it to himself on purpose so that Man Kuai would send himself off to his own death. No matter what, they had already come this far, and the one who died was just an outsider, so it was naturally impossible for them to back out here.

But after this incident, no matter who it was, none of them dared to take things lightly. This was the den of an Emperor Grade Array Master, so any corner they walked into may be deadly.

“If you are all fine, then continue on with this Old Master,” Sang De swept a glance at the group.

Yang Kai asked, “Grandmaster, you made preparations for five of us, will there be no issues after this with one less?”

Sang De responded, “There won’t be any issues. The main reason this Old Master sought out Man Kuai was to push away that stone slab. He has already completed the task, so his assistance will not be required from now on.”

“So, that’s how it is!” Yang Kai grinned, “All right then. Continue leading the way, Grandmaster.”

Sang De nodded and led the way forward. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The remaining three exchanged glances with each other, but they all followed along. Through what Yang Kai just asked though, the three of them could almost be sure that Sang De definitely knew about the Spirit Devouring Grand Array hidden within the stone entrance, and also knew what would happen if Man Kuai were to push it open, he just kept quiet on purpose. In other words, after he pushed the Dragon Suppressing Stone, Man Kuai’s utility was gone, so it didn’t matter whether he lived or died.

This old man usually looked harmless, but he was in fact a sinister man. Both She Lan and Chen Fei knew they had to be on their guard.

Along the way though, they did not encounter any obstacles.

This was in fact a secluded home left behind by a Master. The interior was spacious and the cave walls were lined with luminous stones that emitted a faint glow, making it appear a little less dim.

An hour later, the crowd walked about a thousand meters underground and finally arrived before a huge stone cave.

Stalactites were hanging from the cave roof and the water drops dripping down off them made a crisp splash as they hit the ground.

After arriving here, everyone’s eyes were immediately attracted to an object placed at the centre of the cave.

There was an artifact measuring twenty to thirty meters long with smooth curves forming a shuttle shape. The aura coming off this shuttle proved this was an extraordinary artifact.

After arriving here, Sang De’s eyes suddenly brightened up and he stood in place, staring at the shuttle-shaped artifact, eyes not turning away for even a moment.

Yang Kai and the others were also looking at it with amazement. They all knew that Sang De had brought them here to pick up a tool that would allow them to leave the Solitary Void Sealed world, so when they saw this thing, they naturally associated that with it.

“Grandmaster, could this be...” She Lan was the first who couldn’t resist asking.

Even though Chen Fei did not speak, his eager eyes have deeply betrayed what he was feeling.

“Indeed!” Sang De nodded heavily, “This is the Sea King Shuttle refined by that Old Ghost! Even though it is not an Emperor Artifact, the only thing it lacks is Emperor Aura. With this, this Old Master will be able to get out of this Solitary Void Sealed World!”

He looked completely excited.

Chen Fei and She Lan were also ecstatic. They did not expect this trip to be so easy.

After all, when they followed Sang De here, other than the Ten Shades Reflecting Water Grand Array that needed the five of them to break before they could enter the island, they didn’t seem to encounter any difficulties. Man Kuai was the only one to have met with misfortune, and they had only followed Sang De here to see this special tool that was just within their reach.

“Grandmaster, I hope you don’t forget our merits when we leave here!” Chen Fei gave him a hasty reminder.

Sang De grinned meaningfully, “Naturally, I will not forget.” He paused for a moment before continuing, “Do you all still have the array flags this Old Master handed to you previously?”

Even though they had no idea why he was asking this, they all took out the array flags from before. These array flags were the ones used to break the Ten Shades Reflecting Water Grand Array. After it was broken, Sang De did not ask for them back, so they kept them for themselves.

“Very good.” Sang De smiled, “There is still a Spirit Array surrounding the Spirit King Shuttle that requires breaking. This Old Master will have to borrow your strength!”

She Lan quickly said, “Just tell us what we need to do, Grandmaster!”

Since things had already come to this, she was naturally very cooperative and had long forgotten about Man Kuai’s tragic death.

“Come with me!” Sang De waved his hand and flew towards the Sea King Shuttle. The rest of them hurriedly followed, each feeling eager and ecstatic within themselves.

But before getting close to the Sea King Shuttle, Sang De suddenly formed a hand seal in mid-air and lightly spat out one word. Following that, he scurried forward at a great speed.

The moment they heard this, the faces of Yang Kai and the others changed. They all felt that something was wrong, and when they saw Sang De flying away quickly, how could they not know that this old thing was pulling another trick?

Shocked, the three of them were about to give chase when a blast suddenly emerged from Chen Fei’s hand.

The array flag that he was holding suddenly exploded, and the violent power fluctuations set off from it splashed in all directions. Chen Fei was thrown into disarray by the explosion and the Source Qi protecting his body instantly collapsed.

Before he could regain his senses, another explosion sounded out. This time, it was the array flag in She Lan’s hand that exploded.

Next, it was Yang Kai’s. Three array flags exploded in a row with terrifying force.

But Chen Fei and the others weren’t weak, so even though they were taken by surprise, they all summoned their defensive artifacts and pushed their Source Qi to protect themselves, narrowly avoiding a tragic death right then and there.

Suddenly encountering a sneak attack, and at Sang De’s hands no less, Chen Fei and She Lan were naturally enraged. As soon as they were able to stabilize themselves from the impact of the explosion, they wanted to settle the accounts with Sang De.

But what caused their faces to change greatly was the fact that their bodies had actually turned weak and sore all of a sudden. They couldn’t muster any strength at all and fell straight to the ground, heads spinning.

Yang Kai did not appear to be faring much better either and fell down beside the two, not moving in the slightest.

“Poison!” Chen Fei’s face twisted into an ugly expression. How could they still not know that Sang De had added an exploding seal on the array flag? There were also some problems with the materials he used. He may have planned all of this when he gave them the array flags at the start to break the Ten Shades Reflecting Water Grand Array.

Sang De’s figure slowly emerged from a corner. He did not walk at too fast a pace and his expression seemed calm as he gazed coldly at the three of them lying on the ground without the slightest pity.

“Grandmaster, why would you do this?” She Lan just could not understand it. She hadn’t even expressed any intentions of betrayal the whole time, what’s more, from appearance alone she could tell that the Sea King Shuttle had a huge internal space that could fit at least a dozen or two dozen people. Sang De hadn’t even gotten his hands on it yet, so why did he suddenly turn against them?

There was no conflict of interest, so what was Sang De doing this for?

Chen Fei also looked at Sang De with bitter hatred. He had long known that Sang De was not a trustworthy man, but he didn’t expect this old man to turn on them so quickly. He originally thought that if he was going to turn on them, then it would be after he got his hands on the Sea King Shuttle.

“Please don’t blame this Old Master, this Old Master had no choice but to do this!” Sang De said indifferently. He did not attempt to explain further and simply began forming a series of hand seals.

Along with the changes of the seals, a strange sound emerged. When the three of them turned their heads around, they instantly felt their scalps tingling.

There, they saw holes open in the ground out of nowhere that crimson blood flowed out from. This blood flowed along the ground and spread apart in the pattern of a Spirit Array, gradually forming an abstruse image.

The blood smelled fresh, and the aura contained within it felt familiar.

“Man Kuai’s blood!” Chen Fei seemed to think of something and his face went pale.
