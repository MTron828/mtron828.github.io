What Mo Na Ye couldn’t figure out was why Yang Kai didn’t use this method in the battle two years ago and instead chose to use it today. It was simply unreasonable. It would be even more unreasonable to say that Yang Kai had used some kind of method unknown to the Black Ink Clan in the past two years to produce so many Small Stone Race members.

Although he really wanted to find out the reason, Mo Na Ye didn’t have the time to do so.

As over 100 million Small Stone Race Soldiers joined the battlefield, the Black Ink Clan’s originally stable line of defence began to collapse. A large number of the Black Ink Clan Soldiers fighting at the forefront fell, affecting the lives of even the Masters behind them.

Mo Na Ye could only focus on the battle in front of him, issuing a stream of orders one after another, trying to kill as many enemies as possible while resisting the attacks of the Human Race and Small Stone Race.

At the same time, he also didn’t forget to pay attention to Yang Kai’s movements. After Yang Kai had made his way to the battlefield, his presence had restrained all the Pseudo-Royal Lords who had been fighting outside.

The Human Race’s tactic to deal with these Pseudo-Royal Lords was basically to confront them using Battle Formations formed by Eighth-Order Masters. Although the Human Race had many Eighth-Order Masters, the Black Ink Clan had many Pseudo-Royal Lords. Moreover, when three Pseudo-Royal Lords assumed a simple Three Fortunes Formation, they were easily able to restrain the several Battle Formations formed by five Eighth-Order Masters.

Although the Human Race could still use more Eighth-Order Masters, using any more of them would just make it even harder for them to effectively coordinate with each other. It would defeat the purpose and put them in jeopardy.

As such, most of the battles between the top combatants of the two Races were evenly matched. Only a small number of Pseudo-Royal Lords could disrupt the balance, while it took far more Eighth-Order Masters to compensate.

However, when Yang Kai disappeared after rushing out of the No-Return Pass and releasing a massive number of Small Stone Race Soldiers, the situation abruptly changed.

All the Pseudo-Royal Lords who had stepped on the battlefield immediately fell into a disadvantageous position as they were now highly distracted, stretching their Divine Senses to the limit to monitor their surroundings, guarding against any sneak attacks.

It wasn’t until a Pseudo-Royal Lord saw Yang Kai’s figure appear at Pure Yang Pass that they all collectively breathed a sigh of relief. Yang Kai hadn’t launched a sneak attack and had instead gone to Pure Yang Pass, which was undoubtedly good news for the Black Ink Clan on the battlefield.

Be that as it may, they couldn’t figure out why Yang Kai had gone to Pure Yang Pass at this time.

Just like the last battle, Pure Yang Pass, the only Great Pass occupied by the Human Race, was located away from the battlefield, acting as a coordination centre to control the overall situation.

Mi Jing Lun was standing on the city wall with a feather fan in his hand, like a weak scholar, quietly observing the battlefield and issuing precise orders.

In a flash, Yang Kai appeared beside him.

Mi Jing Lun shot a glance at him and asked, “Did you go to the Chaotic Dead Territory?”

The Small Stone Race in the hands of the Humans had almost been completely exhausted after all these years of war. Since Yang Kai could suddenly summon an army of 100 million Small Stone Race Soldiers to participate in the siege of the No-Return Pass, it was obvious that he had been to Chaotic Dead Territory.

“En,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Isn’t this too wasteful?” Mi Jing Lun asked, feeling a bit distressed.

Since Yang Kai bestowed a large number of Small Stone Race members to the various Armies of the Human Race, these strange creatures had made great contributions in many battles. In many small-scale battles, the Human Race had been able to win with their smaller numbers because of the Small Stone Race’s fearlessness.

Years of war had depleted the Small Stone Race, and deprived the Human Race of this huge support. Mi Jing Lun’s heart ached when he witnessed Yang Kai throw so many of the Small Stone Race members into the battlefield in one go.

It had to be known that all these Small Stone Race Soldiers that were deployed on the battlefield could never be recovered, because they would fight until their bodies were crushed to pieces.

Only when a Humans used a beast-taming technique or an artifact refining technique to refine them would they be able to command these creatures with low intelligence.

If the Human Race was like a huge family, then Yang Kai would definitely be the prodigal black sheep. His extravagance made Mi Jing Lun, who was in charge of the daily budget, feel a great deal of pain.

Yang Kai grinned at him, “Don’t worry, I’ve collected a lot this time.”

“A lot?” Mi Jing Lun raised his brow.

“A lot!” Yang Kai repeatedly nodded. Even if he had released 100 million Small Stone Race Soldiers, he still had about three times as many left in his Small Universe.

Mi Jing Lun was relieved after hearing this.

“Senior Brother, please open a portal to your Small Universe,” Yang Kai requested.

Mi Jing Lun naturally knew what he wanted to do and immediately opened the portal. The next moment, Yang Kai also opened a portal to his Small Universe. The two portals quickly overlapped, as if they were about to merge into one.

Soon after, an enormous number of Small Stone Race Soldiers were transferred into Mi Jing Lun’s Small Universe.

Slowly, Mi Jing Lun’s expression changed.

Although he had some inkling from Yang Kai’s answer that he had indeed brought back a lot of Small Stone Race members, he had never expected this number to be so exaggerated.

A moment later, Mi Jing Lun raised his hand and stated, “Enough. I can’t take it anymore.”

After all, his Small Universe’s foundation was not as strong as Yang Kai’s. He had almost reached its limit after accepting 100 million or so Small Stone Race Soldiers. At this moment, the circulation of his World Force was strained so much that if he were to fight the Black Ink Clan in this state, even a Territory Lord could take his life.

“How many more?” Mi Jing Lun asked.

“About twice as many as I gave you.”

Mi Jing Lun was rendered speechless, wondering if Yang Kai had completely raided the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer’s treasury this time. Otherwise, how could he have obtained so many Small Stone Race members?

Helpless, he could only send out a command, “Call Ou Yang Lie and Wei Jun Yang back.”

A messenger immediately sent out the message.

Somewhere on the battlefield, Ou Yang Lie happened to be facing three Pseudo-Royal Lords in a Three Fortunes Formation. He was fighting to his heart’s content, but after receiving the message, he was shocked and quickly withdrew from the battle, rushing towards Pure Yang Pass. Although the Pseudo-Royal Lords wanted to stop him, how could they? They might gain an upper hand while fighting Ou Yang Lie together, but if the latter wanted to escape, they were completely powerless to stop him.

Somewhere else on the battlefield, Wei Jun Yang did the same.

The two had no idea what had happened, but since Mi Jing Lun had called them back during such a battle, it was obviously no small matter.

The two arrived at Pure Yang Pass one after the other. When Mi Jing Lun briefly explained everything, they finally understood why they were recalled.

The Small Stone Race Soldiers couldn’t just be let out in the open. The only option they had was to temporarily suppress them inside a Ninth-Order Master’s Small Universe. After this battle was over, they would then be refined and used by the Human Race’s soldiers.

Ou Yang Lie and Wei Jun Yang didn’t delay things any further. Just like Mi Jing Lun, each opened a portal to their Small Universes before Yang Kai transferred the Small Stone Race to them.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai finally breathed a sigh of relief, looking refreshed. His Small Universe had been under pressure ever since he left the Chaotic Dead Territory, which finally disappeared until now.

Of course, he had also kept a few Small Stone Race Masters for his own use, but he could easily afford to keep them without affecting himself.

On the other hand, Mi Jing Lun and the other two looked strained, as if they had eaten too much. Even their auras were unstably fluctuating.

Ou Yang Lie couldn’t help but complain, “Please inform me in advance next time something like this happens.”

He was halfway through his fight with the Pseudo-Royal Lords and was unhappy to be recalled just for something like this. Worse, after this, he could not participate in the following battle.

Yang Kai grinned, “Just bear with it.”

While they were speaking, a figure flew out from the depths of Pure Yang Pass and landed in front of everyone, handing a large number of Space Rings to Mi Jing Lun, “Supreme Commander Mi, all the supplies are in here.”

Mi Jing Lun gestured casually to Yang Kai, “Give them to him.”

The man then handed the Space Rings to Yang Kai, who took them and swept them with his Divine Sense before nodding his acknowledgement, “Quite efficient.”

The Human Race’s supplies had almost been depleted after the last battle, so obviously, these resources had been mined over the past two years.

The Humans had scattered nearly 3 million soldiers throughout the Black Ink Battlefield to mine resources, and with the Universe Temples as transfer points, their efficiency was naturally quite high.

Of course, using the Universe World assault tactic in this battle had also consumed a lot of resources; otherwise, there would have been more.

There were two reasons Yang Kai came to Mi Jing Lun from the No-Return Pass. Firstly, he wanted to hand over the Small Stone Race Army, and secondly, he wanted to ask Mi Jing Lun for some supplies, as well as hand over the Yellow and Blue Crystals he had looted from the Chaotic Dead Territory.

After silently calculating for a moment, Yang Kai stated, “The next battle should still be fought after two years, yes?”

The supplies in his hands were enough for him to last two years. If the Human Race launched a war after his supplies had depleted, he would be able to ask for them once again. This way, his cultivation would not be delayed and he could quickly reach the peak of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

In the next war, the Human Race would have the assistance of a large number of Small Stone Race Soldiers, so the situation would definitely be different.

“Indeed!” Mi Jing Lun nodded his agreement. The Human Race would also need some time to recuperate after such a large battle. On top of that, mining supplies would also require time. An interval of two years was the absolute minimum.

“How are the Void Guard doing?” Yang Kai asked again.

According to the previous arrangements, the Void Guard led by Li Wu Yi would be setting up Space Arrays leading to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction in advance in preparation for the future crusade. They were ordered to send a report every time they set up a new Space Array, so that the Supreme Headquarters had a good grasp of their situation.

The void was a dangerous place, especially the vast Late Ancient Era Battlefield, which was fraught with many unknown dangers. So, it was necessary to send reports back in a timely manner.

“Everything is going smoothly,” Mi Jing Lun replied, “They have already laid out eight Space Arrays.”

Yang Kai nodded his acknowledgement. It had only been two years since Li Wu Yi and the others had set out while the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was extremely far from here. Even if they went all out, it would take Li Wu Yi and the others several years to reach the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. On top of that, they also had to stop and arrange Space Arrays while circumventing unknown dangers along the way. It would take them a while to complete this task.

Yang Kai reckoned that they had only covered about 30% of the total distance at most. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’ll go and fight, everyone take care!” Yang Kai didn’t say anything else. He simply cupped his fists towards Mi Jing Lun and the others before taking a step forward and disappearing from their sight.
