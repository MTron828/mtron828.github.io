With the strength of all the other Monster Kings, they would absolutely not be able to stand out in the end.

For a while, both Xie Wu Wei and Ying Fei could not help feeling relieved. Especially Ying Fei, he started to believe that he had made the right choice in escorting Yang Kai on his trip a few days ago.

At this moment, Xi Lei suddenly sensed the abnormality too, and gaped at Ying Fei and Xie Wu Wei, “Why aren’t you two injured?”

Ying Fei snickered, “Why should we be injured?”

Xi Lei shook his head, “Don’t tell me those guys just gave you this good job for no reason. It took a lot of effort for this Old Rhino to get this opportunity!”

Ying Fei proudly responded, “Who dares to refuse Sir Cang Gou’s order? As for Brother Xie… I have no idea.”

Xie Wu Wei snorted with an enigmatic look, not bothering to explain himself.

Xi Lei fumed, “This is not fair! Completely and utterly not fair!”

Ever since the news came out a few days ago, the thirty-two Monster Kings and eight Great Kings of the Ancient Lands were all heated up. Everyone rolled up their sleeves and there was not a single one who did not covet this job. Xi Lei put up a great fight and only won this position because of his outstanding strength in the end. However, Ying Fei had simply been assigned the position by Sir Cang Gou and did not need to go through any tribulations like he did.

It was totally reasonable for Xi Lei to feel unfair at this comparison.

But he soon calmed down as, no matter the process, he still ended up winning the prize.

While the three were talking, the palace gate opened, and a woman dressed in a long gown walked out.

The three Monster Kings cupped their fists as they saw her and greeted, “Sister Tian Long!”

Although Tian Long’s cultivation was not as good as theirs, she was Luan Feng’s confidant, so they dared not to be impolite to her, lest Tian Long complain about them to Luan Feng, which would make their lives quite difficult.

“Mistress asks you all to come inside,” Tian Long called and led the way.

The three hurriedly followed.

Inside the hall, they saw Luan Feng sitting on her throne, while Yang Kai was sitting on a seat below her with an unknown old man and a little girl standing behind him.

The three Monster Kings stared steadily forward and cupped their fists together, “Subordinate greets Lady Luan Feng!”

“En,” Luan Feng nodded gently with a dignified bearing, “This Queen believes that all of you know why you’re here. You are summoned here this time to follow Young Master Yang to the Northern Territory to resolve a crisis for Ice Heart Valley. While you are out, you will follow the orders of Young Master Yang. Whoever dares to disobey will be punished severely without any mercy.”

“Subordinate will not disappoint Lady Luan Feng!” The three replied in unison.

It was a stroke of luck for them to be able to receive this job and no one would dare to disobey Yang Kai’s order. Even if Luan Feng did not warn them, they would still put all their hearts into serving Yang Kai; after all, this was an opportunity for them to build a good relationship with him.

Luan Feng nodded in satisfaction, “Young Master Yang is not an outsider anyway. You may greet him.”

Only then did they turn to Yang Kai, and cupped their fists, “Greetings, Young Master Yang.”

Yang Kai put on a smile, as he glanced at the three Monster Kings.

Among the three Monster Kings, he only knew the background of two. Xie Wu Wei was Fan Wu’s subordinate, while Ying Fei was Cang Gou’s subordinate. As for the last one, he should be Luan Feng’s subordinate. He came here to ask Luan Feng for help, but he did not expect that Luan Feng would ask each of the other two Divine Venerables to send out a Monster King as well. Luan Feng obviously did not want to bear all the risk herself.

However, Yang Kai did not have any comments on this matter and simply said, “Three Monster Kings don’t need to be so polite. I will be relying on you three in the future.”

Yang Kai was not disappointed at having just three Monster Kings as this was within his expectations. Only a fool would dream of Luan Feng assigning seven to eight Monster Kings together with him.

Of course, Xie Wu Wei and the others dared not to be at ease and continued to act respectfully.

Yang Kai stood up, “Lady Feng, since they are all here, this Yang shall take his leave.”

Luan Feng could not wait for him to leave, so she did not have the intention to stop him, “This Queen will send you off.”

She did not really intend to send him off, but mainly wanted to witness Yang Kai making a fool out of himself.

This little brat extorted a large amount of wealth from the Ancient Lands and dragged her into a pit in the Netherworld Sect. Now, he was even thick-skinned enough to request help from her again. She could not reject him, but it was still possible to watch him make a fool out of himself to relieve her resentment.

She had tried the so-called Cross-Territory Space Array a few times now and concluded it was just a useless piece of garbage.

However, she was looking forward to what expression Yang Kai would show after discovering this.

The group went straight to the place where the Space Array was located. When they arrived, Yang Kai instructed them to stand on the array and only then did he take out a number of High-Rank Source Crystals and insert them into the array base’s grooves.

“Farewell, Lady Feng. If there is time, this Junior will visit again in the future.”

“Go, go, don’t waste your time,” Luan Feng suppressed a laugh as she waved her hand.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, feeling that Luan Feng’s expression was strange, but he did not know why. He then glanced over at Tian Long beside her, who was also trying to hold back her laughter.

[What are they thinking now?]

Yang Kai was confused, but it was inconvenient for him to ask, so he simply pushed his Space Principles as he stood on the array. A light flashed in the next moment, enveloping everyone who stood atop it.

When the light was dissipated, they were all gone.

Flabbergasted, Luan Feng stared at the empty Space Array. However, she was no fool so after recovering from her initial shock, she ground her teeth angrily, “That tricky little brat!”

The reason why she could not activate the Space Array while Yang Kai could easily operate it was clearly that he had set up some kind of restriction on it. In other words, the Space Array was completely functional, but no one could operate it other than Yang Kai.

Luan Feng ground her teeth madly as she suspected that Yang Kai had anticipated her trying to go to Ice Heart Valley to verify the information about Zhang Ruo Xi, prompting him to play this trick.

“It really works!” Tian Long was simply startled as her jaw hung loosely.

It was truly a miracle that a Space Array that was arranged in less than one day could be activated. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“So what if it works!?” Luan Feng snorted coldly, “Smash it.”

“Smash… it?” Tian Long was taken aback.

“Smash it!” Luan Feng nodded affirmatively, “With this thing here, wouldn’t it be all too convenient for that little brat to come and go as he wanted? How could this Queen allow him to behave so rampantly!”

It seemed like she had developed a phobia of Yang Kai. In order to avoid any more harassment from him in the future, it was better to smash the Space Array. Otherwise, Yang Kai might just suddenly appear here again one day.

Tian Long received the order, and no longer hesitated. She immediately waved her hand and smashed the Space Array that Yang Kai arranged to pieces.

……

Ice Heart Valley buzzed incessantly as the world seemed to shake around it from time to time. World Energy swirled chaotically, as if it was a sign of the end times.

The entire Ice Heart Valley was now in danger and all the disciples were gripped with fear. However, there was still a determined look in their eyes, one which showed their will to sacrifice themselves together with Ice Heart Valley.

The light curtain of the array that shrouded Ice Heart Valley had become very dim and was now visibly shaking. Obviously it would not last much longer.

“Quickly think! If you can’t think of a way to stabilize the array, you will die the moment it collapses!” Somewhere in Ice Heart Valley, Ji Yao pointed her sword at a man’s neck. This sharp sword had even pierced through the man’s skin, drawing a small trickle of blood.

The man was not flustered even when his life was threatened by a sword pointed at his neck though and just sighed, “With things having progressed to this stage, this King cannot help you anymore. Although this King was captured by your side, the foundation of the array-breaker was almost complete at that time. Even without this King taking charge, the Seeking Passion Sect can still utilize at least half of its power. If this King did not assist you in stabilizing the Spirit Array all this time, do you think it could have lasted until now? This King is afraid it would have broken half a month ago.”

This man was Nanmen Da Jun, who was captured by Yang Kai back then.

After being captured by Yang Kai, Bing Yun did not embarrass him, only saying she would let him go after the war.

Nanmen Da Jun was naturally quite grateful, and to repay their mercy, he had spent these days living in Ice Heart Valley stabilizing their Sect Defending Array.

What he said was the plain truth. Although he was captured by Yang Kai more than a month ago, many of the array flags he set up had already begun to resonate with one another and the foundation of the array-breaker was almost complete.

Even without him, the Seeking Passion Sect could still operate it to a certain degree.

If Nanmen Da Jun did not take the initiative to help Ice Heart Valley in stabilizing the Sect Defending Array since then, how could it have lasted to this day?

He was the one who was in charge of breaking the Sect Defending Array in the first place, but now he was also the one who was stabilizing it. It was not that he was capricious, but rather that Nanmen Da Jun had a principle of equivalent exchange. Since his life and safety were assured, he was now repaying Ice Heart Valley as compensation.

However, this was his limit. Nanmen Da Jun had deep attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, and at a glance, he could see that the Sect Defending Array of Ice Heart Valley would be broken in less than two hours.

“Enough nonsense. If you dare to say you can’t do it again, I’ll kill you now!” Ji Yao yelled angrily.

Nanmen Da Jun glanced at her emotionlessly, “If I were you, I would send my disciples away hurriedly before the array is breached, otherwise it will be too late.”

“You court death!” Ji Yao was infuriated and was about to stab him with the sword in her hand.

“Yao’er, don’t be rude!” Suddenly, Bing Yun appeared from nowhere and shouted at her.

In recent days, Bing Yun had left Ice Heart Valley repeatedly to harass the enemy. She did not expect to kill anyone, but simply wanted to cause some chaos to delay their progress in breaking the array. But unfortunately, she was met by Feng Xuan every time she went out.

There were even several times she nearly didn’t manage to retreat safely. It would be an equal match if she really fought Feng Xuan one on one, possibly even an advantage for her as she was slightly stronger than him, but Bing Yun was no match against the combined forces of the Seeking Passion Sect.

“Valley Master Bing Yun!” Nanmen Da Jun still had deep respect for Bing Yun, so seeing her arrive, he greeted her with cupped fists.

“Grandmaster Nanmen doesn’t have to be so polite.” Bing Yun said before a worried look appeared on her face and she asked, “Grandmaster, is there really no other way?”

Nanmen Da Jun shook his head, “It is now inevitable for the Spirit Array to be broken. It could take as short as one hour, or as long as two hours. Valley Master Bing Yun, you’d best make plans now.”

Bing Yun’s expression turned solemn as she knew that since Nanmen Da Jun had said so, there was no hope to defend Ice Heart Valley. Unfortunately, Yang Kai was not back yet. If he were, perhaps he could bring some hope to Ice Heart Valley.

However, it seemed like Yang Kai could not come back in time because, when he left, he stated that it would take a month or two for him to return.
