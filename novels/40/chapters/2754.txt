Maplewood City, Violet Source Chamber of Commerce Branch.

Maplewood City was not like the past. It had risen quickly in recent years and as one of the two major chambers of commerce in the Southern Territory, Violet Source Chamber of Commerce naturally set up a large branch here, one that had an Emperor Realm Master managing it. The constant flow of cultivators coming and going from Maplewood City and Spirit Lake City nearby brought a lot of commerce to the region, which was naturally a matter of great importance to Violet Source Chamber of Commerce.

With fifty stores of all sorts under the name of this branch, as well as a sizable auction house, Violet Source Chamber of Commerce had been making a lot of money in Maplewood City during these years.

When he walked into Violet Source Chamber of Commerce, Yang Kai looked around and found many cultivators inside, most of them discussing quietly with each other while some browsed through the goods on display here.

The hall was very big, and the construction was also impressive. The financial strength of the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce was quite clear to see from this.

At the corner, several pretty young girls who were whispering to each other immediately sent one of them over when Yang Kai walked in. This young girl stood in front of Yang Kai and bowed elegantly, “Greetings, Sir. May I know if there’s anything Sir needs?”

Yang Kai could tell at a glance that this was one of the attendants specially trained to receive customers. This was a common sight in many chambers of commerce. The young girl was not very old, only about thirty or so. She was good-looking and had a sweet smile while her voice was gentle and soothing, enough so to give any customers a pleasant impression.

Yang Kai smiled, “I have some business that I wish to discuss with your chamber of commerce.”

The pretty young girl’s eyes lit up. Attendants like her loved hearing words like these the most because every successful deal would grant them a commission. Even though the commission wasn’t great, if they managed to pull in a big deal, they wouldn’t have to worry about cultivation resources for the next few years.

She could see that Yang Kai had an extraordinary bearing, so she was even more excited. In an instant, the young girl became very enthusiastic and spoke with a charming smile, “May I know what sort of business Sir is interested in discussing? This maidservant can settle anything under ten million Source Crystals directly.”

“Low-Rank Source Crystals?” Yang Kai asked.

“Yes!” The girl nodded.

Yang Kai smiled, “Then please ask your manager to come out.”

The girl was stunned, but she quickly realized that the business this man was interested in was beyond her ability to handle. Ten million Low-Rank Source Crystals was a huge number for her, but it may not be much for some people, especially those in the Emperor Realm.

It seemed like that was the kind of business this Sir was interested in.

The girl responded seriously, “Sir, please accompany me to a private room while I facilitate your request.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and followed the girl.

Soon, they arrived at a private room where the young girl settled Yang Kai down and served tea, “Sir, please wait for a moment. This maidservant will go ask Sir Manager to come over.”

Yang Kai remained as still as a mountain, but just as the girl was about to leave, he suddenly asked, “By the way, have you heard of a man called Kang Si Ran?”

Shopkeeper Kang was the first friend he made in Maplewood City, and it was all thanks to his lead that Yang Kai was able to obtain Gong Sun Mu’s inheritance. Only, Maplewood City was too small back then and Kang Si Ran had been transferred away by Violet Source Chamber of Commerce after he broke through to the Dao Source Realm, and Yang Kai had no idea where he had been transferred to.

It had been more than a decade since they last saw each other.

Now that Yang Kai was back here, he naturally thought about Kang Si Ran again. He had only asked this question casually, but he didn’t expect to receive a surprising response from the girl, “Sir knows Manager Kang?”

“Ah?” Yang Kai was stunned.

The girl smiled, “If Sir knows Manager Kang, then should this maidservant invite him over to discuss with you?”

Yang Kai raised a brow, “Kang Si Ran is here?”

“That’s right, Manager Kang is also in this branch.”

This was an unexpected surprise for Yang Kai. He didn’t think that he would get this answer from just a casual question and nodded, “Good, ask him to come.”

“Yes!” The girl answered, bowed, and withdrew, closing the door behind her.

Inside the private room, Yang Kai sipped on his tea and waited quietly.

A short while later, a knock came from the door, to which Yang Kai smiled and called out, “Please come in!”

The door was pushed open, and Kang Si Ran’s figure came into Yang Kai’s view. Four eyes meeting, Kang Si Ran was amazed and exclaimed, “Brother… Brother Yang!”

“We meet again, Brother Kang!” Yang Kai cupped his fists with a smile.

Kang Si Ran was both surprised and delighted, shutting the door behind him before saying, “I was wondering which old acquaintance had come to see me, but it turns out to be Brother Yang! It must have been more than ten years since we last met, hasn’t it?”

“Indeed. Brother Kang, come sit down so we can talk.”

Kang Si Ran was quite excited to see Yang Kai again after so long; after all, it was all thanks to the Dao Source Pill Yang Kai gave him that he was able to reach the Dao Source Realm. If not for that favour, Kang Si Ran would still be stuck at the peak of the Origin King Realm, unable to advance, missing out on all the strength and status he held today.

Over the past ten years or so, Kang Si Ran’s cultivation had reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm, so it seemed like he had been working hard this past decade and had been properly cultivating.

After sitting down, Kang Si Ran couldn’t help but sigh. Thinking that back in the day, he and Yang Kai were both mere Origin Kings, and they had also gone through fire and water together. It almost felt like a lifetime ago when he last saw him.

“Brother Kang, weren’t you transferred away? How did you end up back in Maplewood City?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Kang Si Ran laughed, “Maplewood City is different now, and the headquarters naturally pays more attention to this place as well. Though this Kang’s cultivation is not considered high, I had still lived here for half my life and am quite familiar with the situation here in Maplewood City, so I was sent back here.”

Maplewood City was a good place now, and there were many people from the headquarters hoping to come to this place. If it weren’t for Kang Si Ran’s natural advantages, he wouldn’t have even been considered for his current position with his low cultivation.

But even so, Kang Si Ran was likely going to be transferred again soon, because the branch had already established a firm foothold here, and they were gradually growing familiar with Maplewood City. They didn’t need his guidance that much anymore, so when the time came, someone with higher cultivation and stronger connections would come to take his place.

“So, that’s how it is… This is good news.” Yang Kai nodded, unaware of the intricacies inside the chamber of commerce.

Kang Si Ran just smiled and did not try to explain; after all, the goings-on inside the chamber of commerce were a ‘family matter’. Even though he and Yang Kai had a good relationship, there was no need to mention such things.

*Du du du…*

There was a sudden knock at the door.

As soon as the knocking stopped, the door was opened before Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran could even respond. Following that, a well-dressed young man walked in with a smile.

Upon seeing this man, Kang Si Ran’s face sank instantly and he frowned, “Gu Hong, what are you doing? Can’t you see that I’m talking business with a customer?”

This Gu Hong was too impudent, entering the private room without even receiving permission. It was fortunate that Yang Kai was the one sitting here and not anyone else, otherwise, Kang Si Ran wouldn’t know how to explain the situation to them. In the worst-case scenario, this may even make customers think that Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s commitment to confidentiality wasn’t sincere, resulting in a failed business deal.

Faced with Kang Si Ran’s questioning, Gu Hong completely ignored him and instead smiled at Yang Kai, “Welcome, this one is Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s Branch Manager Gu Hong. May I know what to call you, friend?”

Yang Kai glanced at Kang Si Ran, then at Gu Hong, a light flickering in his eyes as he smirked, but did not speak.

Not receiving a response, Gu Hong’s expression turned a little awkward, but he still persisted, “Please forgive this humble one for interrupting, but Manager Kang’s abilities are somewhat… lacking, so this Gu was worried that business would have been lost if entrusted to his hands. That is why this Gu came uninvited. Please forgive my forwardness.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Manager Kang isn’t competent? Why do you say that?”

Gu Hong smiled, “He has managed to settle only three deals in the last year, what would this be if not incompetence?”

Kang Si Ran’s face turned dark as he said coldly, “If no one tried to interfere, then this Kang would have accomplished more deals.”

Gu Hong responded, “Manager Kang need not be angry. This Gu interfered in your business for your own good. You are going to be transferred in a few days, so settling business will be troublesome when the time comes. As such, why not hand things over for this Gu to manage now?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Kang Si Ran grunted, “Is this Kang supposed to thank you?”

Gu Hong smiled, “We are all members from the same chamber of commerce, there’s no need for thanks.” Then, he turned back to Yang Kai, “This friend, if you truly wish to do business, this Gu is willing to be of assistance. I will be open and tell you now that Manager Kang will indeed be transferred from here soon, so if you have any business, why not discuss it with this Gu instead? This Gu guarantees your satisfaction.”

Yang Kai turned to look at Kang Si Ran, “You’re being transferred again?”

Kang Si Ran let out a sigh.

It was by his own will to be transferred out of Maplewood City back then because the city was too small and poor. There was no future for him staying here at the time, but things were different now. Maplewood City was just like a fragrant meat bun that everyone wanted a bite of, so how could he be willing to transfer? But he was powerless in this matter.

Yang Kai nodded in understanding before saying, “This Yang appreciates Manager Gu’s kindness, but I am old acquaintances with Manager Kang, and we share a life-and-death friendship. That is why I wish to discuss this deal with Manager Kang.”

“Is that so…” Gu Hong was stunned before quickly smiling, “In that case, this Gu will not stay and be a pest. Please excuse me!”

Yang Kai’s words told him that he most likely wouldn’t be able to snatch this deal, so he did not waste any more time and quickly withdrew.

Soon, the only ones left in the room were Yang Kai and Kang Si Ran.

Yang Kai asked, “Brother Kang, do you not wish to leave Maplewood City?”

Kang Si Ran nodded, “The Southern Territory may have a few branches comparable to the one in Maplewood City, but I won’t be able to enter them. If I get transferred away this time, then coming back will be difficult.”

“I understand,” Yang Kai nodded.

Kang Si Ran smiled, “If it’s fate, let it be. Let’s not talk about me anymore. What sort of deal are you here to make this time around, Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai looked serious, “I want to purchase Space Spirit Crystals and Space Spirit Jade.”

Kang Si Ran stroked the beard on his chin as he mused, “These two are the main materials used to produce Space Rings. They aren’t hard to find, and we have some in stock here in the branch. How much does Brother Yang need?”

“How much does your branch have?” Yang Kai asked.

Kang Si Ran answered, “Let me see.”

While saying that, he took out a jade slip to check. After a while, he looked up and told him, “Around thirty million Mid-Rank Source Crystals worth, but since it is Brother Yang, I can offer you a ten percent discount on however much you wish to purchase. Unfortunately, that is my limit.”

“Good, I’ll want it all.”
