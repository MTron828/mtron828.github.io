Fang Tian Ci’s indifferent voice rang out, “If one day Big Brother’s consciousness falls asleep once again, who do you think should take control of Big Brother’s body, you or I?”

Thunder Shadow immediately fell silent…

Inheriting Yang Kai’s mastery of Grand Daos was also beneficial. If one day Yang Kai’s consciousness was disturbed once again, it would naturally be better for Fang Tian Ci to take over his physical body, because he would be able to bring out more of Yang Kai’s strength.

Back then, Thunder Shadow took over Yang Kai’s body first only because of an accident. At that time, Yang Kai had suddenly fallen into a coma and Thunder Shadow was the first to awaken, so taking over Yang Kai’s body was only natural.

Fang Tian Ci’s consciousness only woke up after Thunder Shadow had lost Mo Na Ye. If Fang Tian Ci had woken up first, Mo Na Ye might not have had a chance to escape.

That was why Yang Kai felt that Mo Na Ye was a scourge who could last for thousands of years and was not fated to die at that time.

“Second Brother, don’t jinx it!” After remaining silent for a moment, Thunder Shadow finally squeezed out a sentence, “Be careful in the future, it may not happen again.”

“There is always a chance for anything to happen. This has already happened before, we have to be on guard against it!”

“How could there be so many chances…”

As the two kept quibbling in his mind, Yang Kai couldn’t help but burst into laughter as he listened. He didn’t feel frustrated or anything, rather, he had a sense of novelty.

Over these years, whether he was facing powerful enemies or exploring foreign lands, Yang Kai had often been alone, without anyone to rely on. Now that he had a Human Self and a Monster Self by his side, he would not feel too lonely.

Leaving them to their own devices, Yang Kai calmly observed his surroundings.

When he first stepped into the Universe Furnace World, he found that this place was extremely rich in Shattered Dao Essence. The amalgamation of Shattered Dao Essence gave birth to all kinds of terrains and even condensed into the Infinite River. It also gave birth to extremely unique native creatures like the Chaos Spirit Clan.

However, after the Grand Dao had undergone several evolutions, the omnipresent Shattered Dao Essence had become extremely thin, and was replaced by order and stability. At this moment, the environment of the Universe Furnace World was only slightly different from the 3,000 Worlds.

[Why does the Grand Dao evolve inside the Universe Furnace? What does the evolution of the Grand Dao mean?]

When he first received information from the Human Race cultivators about this phenomenon, Yang Kai began to ponder the issue. Every time the Grand Dao evolved, he would carefully perceive the changes in his surroundings, hoping to find some kind of rule behind it; but unfortunately, he had not been able to gain anything.

It wasn’t until he went deep into the Infinite River and comprehended the mysteries of the evolution from Chaos to the 10,000 Grand Daos that he finally had some guesses, but it was extremely hard to verify them.

The Universe Furnace lived up to its name as the most Supreme Treasure. Just the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pills it produced were a fantastic opportunity. The Universe Furnace World was a World of its own, and the Chaos Spirit Clan bred inside it was an extremely large and diverse group while the Chaos Spirit Kings strengths were not inferior to that of a Ninth-Order Master or Royal Lord.

However, Yang Kai had a faint feeling that the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill was not the greatest opportunity inside the Universe Furnace. The Universe Furnace itself was the real opportunity, and if he could find its true location, that would really be the biggest harvest.

But since ancient times, no one had ever seen the true body of the Universe Furnace, let alone reached it.

Yang Kai wanted to find the true body of the Universe Furnace. If he could accomplish this feat, it would definitely be of great help to the Human Race. At the very least, there would be no need for them to compete for Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pills in the future.

Of course, he knew that this was a daunting task and he too might not be able to accomplish what many Great Experts had failed to do throughout the ages.

Regardless, he could only do his best and leave the rest to the Heavens!

According to the information Yang Kai had gathered so far, the Infinite River was the biggest hint. The Infinite River stretched across the entire Universe Furnace World, so it must have some kind of connection to the Universe Furnace itself.

As for the evolution of the Universe Furnace’s Grand Dao, it was nothing more than the process of the Chaos evolving into the 10,000 Grand Daos. It was just that the profound process was divided into nine steps by the Universe Furnace, allowing one to feel it more clearly and intuitively!

Yang Kai had a vague feeling that the intrinsic quality of the Universe Furnace was perhaps the profound mystery of Chaos evolving into 10,000 Grand Daos. As for the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill and the Chaos Spirit Clan it gave birth to, they were just side-effects of the process. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Big Brother, Second Brother has ulterior motives, he wants to take over your body!” Thunder Shadow didn’t bother to haggle with Fang Tian Ci and simply pleaded his case to the higher-ups.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh, but just as he was about to speak, a look of surprise appeared on his face as he looked in a certain direction, “Found it!”

Saying so, he activated Thunder Shadow’s Innate Divine Ability and flew in that direction.

In his mind, the two were still engaged in a verbal spat, but after a moment, Fang Tian Ci, who had noticed the strangeness, shouted, “Shut up and focus.”

“Ah,” Thunder Shadow suddenly became silent, but after a moment, he indignantly stated, “Look, it’s my Innate Divine Ability!”

Fang Tian Ci couldn’t bother to argue with him any further.

A moment later, Thunder Shadow’s voice rang out again, “This Chaos Spirit King really isn’t very smart. Why did it suddenly come back here? It’s as if it’s afraid that others won’t be able to find it.”

Thunder Shadow had a sense of familiarity when it laid eyes on the scenery before him. It was the exact same location where the Black Ink Clan had fought with the Chaos Spirit King over the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill previously, where the colony of the Chaos Spirit Clan was.

At that time, Xiao You had pinned down the Chaos Spirit King while he tasked a Pseudo-Royal Lord to snatch the pill, but Yang Kai and Thunder Shadow beat them to it, leading to a chase. As Yang Kai was seriously injured after, he had no choice but to escape into the Infinite River with Thunder Shadow.

When Yang Kai re-emerged, he used the Open Heaven Pill to lure away the Chaos Spirit King in order to alleviate the Human Race’s crisis. Afterwards, the Human Race and Black Ink Clan engaged in a horrific battle and no one paid any attention to the whereabouts of the Chaos Spirit King. In the end, Yang Kai found the Chaos Spirit King back here.

“Big Brother, did you know this guy would return here?” Thunder Shadow asked.

As Yang Kai quietly approached like a shadow, he casually replied, “As you said, it’s not very smart, so it was worth a shot.”

As they were communicating inside Yang Kai’s head, leaving no traces, no one outside could hear and detect them.

Although he had said so, Yang Kai was actually quite confident in his hypothesis; otherwise, he wouldn’t have come straight here.

The intelligence of the Chaos Spirit Clan was truly dismaying, even the strongest Chaos Spirit Kings were no exception.

At this moment, a large number of Chaos Entities were gathered as the colony of the Chaos Spirit Clan spread as far as the eye could see. There was also a smaller number of Chaos Spirit Clan members who had already taken on physical forms.

These Chaos Spirit Clan members happened to be gathered around in a large sphere with a certain Chaos Entity at their center. Furthermore, one could vaguely make out the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill within that flowing mass of Chaotic Force.

In addition, the Chaos Spirit King happened to be standing nearby.

Apparently, the Chaos Spirit King was extremely vigilant as it had suffered a loss once already. Its powerful Divine Sense was constantly sweeping through the void, and even the slightest oddity or movement would draw its attention.

To be honest, if it weren’t for Thunder Shadow’s Innate Divine Ability, Yang Kai could forget about sneaking into this place, and even with the help of Thunder Shadow’s mastery of the Dao of Concealment, Yang Kai was still being extremely cautious.

Bit by bit, Yang Kai slowly approached, trying his best not to leak even a hint of his aura.

Having reached the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai naturally didn’t fear this Chaos Spirit King, but he also had no intention of fighting it. The opposite party wasn’t a part of the Black Ink Clan and he would not gain anything by defeating it. It would be even worse if he lost, which was entirely possible. It could even be said that Yang Kai would be on the losing end if they fought, no matter the outcome.

Therefore, Yang Kai had already made up his mind to simply snatch the pill and flee!

The Chaos Spirit King’s thoughts were simple, [If you eat my pill, you must spit it out. I found it first, so it’s mine!]

Stealthily approaching, Yang Kai pushed Thunder Shadow’s Innate Divine Ability to its utmost limit.

At some point, the Chaos Spirit King who was observing the surroundings suddenly turned its head, looking in the direction Yang Kai was hiding.

In front of someone as strong as this Chaos Spirit King, and a vigilant one at that, there was no such thing as a perfect concealment technique. When the distance between them reached a certain limit, Yang Kai’s existence was ultimately discovered.

Yang Kai was already prepared for this though. The moment the Chaos Spirit King noticed that something was wrong, Yang Kai surged his Space Principles and stepped forward, instantly arriving at the place where the Chaos Spirit Clan members were gathered. The next moment, loud splashing sounds rang out as he summoned the Space-Time River.

Just like last time, the enormous river carried away everything, engulfing the Chaos Entity refining the pill and the several nearby Chaos Spirit Clan members into it.

Immediately after, a violent roar mixed with a fearsome chaotic blast rushed into Yang Kai’s mind.

The Soul Warming Lotus promptly responded, radiating colourful light and blocking the Soul attack.

“Damn it…” Thunder Shadow cried out in alarm, but he didn’t make another move. Obviously, he had been dazed by this roar.

Fang Tian Ci also found it extremely unbearable. The Chaos Spirit King hadn’t even made a move yet, but his voice was already so powerful. It just showed how strong it was.

Suppressing his discomfort, Fang Tian Ci grabbed Thunder Shadow’s Soul and rushed into the Soul Warming Lotus.

While the two were protecting themselves, the Chaos Spirit King’s attack was already upon Yang Kai while Yang Kai had just finished sweeping the Chaos Spirit Clan members into the Space-Time River and was about to escape.

An earth-shattering Chaotic Force suddenly blasted Yang Kai, shattering the Void around him. A muffled grunt escaped Yang Kai’s lips before he promptly summoned his Azure Dragon Spear and thrust it towards the Chaos Spirit King.

In this brief confrontation, Yang Kai’s figure was sent flying while the Chaos Spirit King had to take a few steps back.

The next moment, Yang Kai grabbed the Space-Time River and instantly surged his Space Principle again. As he took a step forward, he disappeared and reappeared in the distance.

An enraged roar came from behind him as a powerful aura rushed over at extreme speed. Obviously, the Chaos Spirit King was already chasing after him.

Yang Kai finally experienced how helpless Xiao You felt. Being chased by such a strong existence was not a good experience, but what made him feel even more helpless was that he couldn’t really fight back against the Chaos Spirit King.

While he was fleeing, he shook the Space-Time River, and under the impact of the various Dao Strengths, the Chaos Entity and Chaos Spirit Clan members that were caught up in the river quickly dissolved.

After a short while, Yang Kai plucked out a pill, stored it away, and fled.

Inside the Soul Warming Lotus, the two passengers felt sluggish. A look of lingering fear could be found on Thunder Shadow’s face as he muttered, “That Chaos Spirit King is strong! But, it is quite unlucky to have encountered you, Big Brother.”

Twice, the Supreme Grade Open Heaven Pill had been snatched away by Yang Kai. The Universe Furnace had appeared so many times, but it was unlikely that such a thing had ever happened before. From this point alone, this Chaos Spirit King was truly unlucky.
