Upon hearing this, Ou Yang Lie was silent for a moment, “It’s like a woman who gave birth to a bunch of Sons, and one of them brought home some unwelcome guests to cause trouble, which angered the woman, so she expelled him from the household and cut off their relationship.”

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “That sounds about right.”

Ou Yang Lie laughed, “I think I understand now. Just like Big Head Mi, if you speak in a roundabout way, it’s easy to get someone confused.”

Yang Kai answered readily, “It was this Junior who was not considerate enough.”

Ou Yang Lie waved his hand, “So that means that the Black Ink Clan have completely given up on this Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest in our hands?”

Yang Kai nodded, “That should be the case!”

Ou Yang Lie guffawed, “Truly, we were wearing out iron shoes while seeking our feet, but now we ended up getting it without any effort instead.”

As early as when Mi Jing Lun requested the Black Ink Clan to leave this Black Ink Nest behind, he had intentions of building an intelligence network for the Human Race through it. Only, even if it was him, he would never have expected that the Black Ink Clan would put up such a fierce struggle with them over the Black Ink Nest, unwilling to back down in the slightest.

As a result, there was nothing they could do about it.

After 10 years, Yang Kai’s efforts have caused the Black Ink Clan to give up on the Black Ink Nest on their own initiative, which means that Mi Jing Lun has now more or less achieved what he initially intended to do.

Yang Kai was also surprised since he had only acted to deal with those Territory Lords. He never thought that they would end up taking over this Black Ink Nest completely as well.

The Royal Lord Black Ink Nest may have completely severed its connection with this Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest, which was in the hands of the Humans; however, the Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest did not wither away as a result of it. The crux of the matter was that this connection could be severed. Though the space created by the Royal Lord Black Ink Nest could deny access to this Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest, the hierarchical relationship between superior and subordinate could never be broken.

In other words, as long as the Black Ink Nest in the Royal City was not destroyed, then nothing would happen to this Black Ink Nest in their hands.

“Big Head Mi will be ecstatic once he hears the news. I’ll go and tell him now,” Ou Yang Lie left after saying so.

After he left, Yang Kai immersed his consciousness again, opening up his Small Universe and connecting it to the Black Ink Nest’s consciousness.

Even though he could no longer enter the space created by the Royal Lord Black Ink Nest’s consciousness, there were no problems when it came to connecting to the consciousness of the Black Ink Nest he was inside. Moreover, he no longer had to put his guard up in preparation for any possible attacks.

Without any disturbance, Yang Kai easily brought the entire Black Ink Nest under his control. As his thoughts shifted, it was as if the Black Ink Nest had become his arms and legs, with all of its functions and abilities within his grasp.

Yang Kai had, after all, many experiences before. Not to mention the Black Ink Nest before him now, even back in the Black Ink Clan’s territory, he had connected to the consciousness of countless Black Ink Nests, so he was no stranger to it.

Only, he was in no mood to mess with anything else back then, so he did not probe too deeply into the Black Ink Nest’s capabilities. But now, things were different. The Humans were trying to make use of this Black Ink Nest to create their own information network. So, naturally, the more he could find out about it, the better.

A short while later, Yang Kai had more or less figured out all the Black Ink Nest’s functions. Though, unlike the last time, preparations to create a sub-nest was not as readily set up.

In a flash, he arrived at the Black Ink Pool and poured a large amount of resources into it as he controlled the Black Ink Nest inwardly to absorb and refine the power within the resources. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Black Ink Pool was a very important place for every Black Ink Nest. It was also the source of its power, so no matter what resources were put into it, they could quickly be turned into nutrients for the Black Ink Nest.

With these nutrients, the Black Ink Nest could spawn new Black Ink Clansmen or sub-nests. Even when it came to the strange mental Soul Space, energy was required to maintain it.

Of course, Yang Kai would not spawn Black Ink Clansmen using the Black Ink Nest, he only wanted to obtain a sub-nest.

He needed a sub-nest for his Small Universe so that he could familiarize the disciples of the Void Dao Temple with the Black Ink Clan’s special characteristics early on.

The Human Race also required a large number of sub-nests to create its intelligence network. At the same time, he also wanted to confirm his and Ou Yang Lie’s guess from earlier.

He wanted to see whether a higher-class Black Ink Nest was truly able to sever its connection with one of its sub-nests and whether that connection could be restored afterwards.

If the connection couldn’t be restored, then that would naturally be a good thing for the Humans. It would mean that they could rest assured and use the Black Ink Nest in the future.

If the connection could be restored, then they would have to tread carefully; after all, nobody could tell when the Black Ink Clan would suddenly restore the connection and try to spy on the Human Race’s communications. It would also be no small matter if they were to suddenly attack the Humans standing by inside of the Black Ink Nest.

Under Yang Kai’s control, the mass of resources in the Black Ink Pool was quickly refined, and all of its energy was directed towards the surrounding flesh walls.

Soon, a tumour bulged out from one part of the flesh wall.

With only a glance at the tumour, Yang Kai could not bear to look at it any longer. This couldn’t be helped as he could already feel very clearly that what was coming out of the tumour was not the sub-nest that he wanted, but a Black Ink Clansman!

The first attempt was a failure.

Yang Kai was not discouraged. He killed the Black Ink Clansman before it was even fully birthed and tried again.

After several failed attempts, a new aura appeared inside the Black Ink Nest. It was Mi Jing Lun who had rushed over after receiving the news.

He was not alone, however. Xiang Shan and Li Zhi Ping, the two Army Commanders, came with him. Including Ou Yang Lie, all four Army Commanders of the Great Evolution Army were now gathered in this place.

It could be seen how much importance the higher-ups placed on the Black Ink Nest from this alone.

Yang Kai had no choice but to put his attempts on hold and went forward to greet them.

They had already heard the gist of the situation from Ou Yang Lie, so when they saw the situation here, they knew that Yang Kai must be trying to create a sub-nest. Xiang Shan asked at once, “How is it progressing?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have tried a few times, but have not succeeded so far.”

Xiang Shan nodded, “If the Black Ink Clan can produce a sub-nest, then there’s no reason why we can’t. If a few tries aren’t enough, then just keep at it. One matter should not bother two men. I will leave you to deal with the Black Ink Nest and wait for you to create a sub-nest.”

“Understood!” Yang Kai responded.

Liu Zhi Ping was encouraging, “Do a good job, and if you succeed, I will personally ask the Old Ancestor to grant you more merits.”

Yang Kai answered humbly, “This Junior is merely attending to his responsibilities and dares not take credit for the work done.”

Mi Jing Lun laughed, “You’ve basically injured or killed 11 Territory Lord level figures in 10 years. If such an outstanding feat is not rewarded, then it would seem as if our Great Evolution Army has no order. Think about it and see if there’s anything that you want. Once matters here are settled, you may come forward with your request, and as long as it’s not excessive, we will satisfy it.”

There wasn’t anything that Yang Kai wanted, other than the sub-nest. All his previous actions were aimed at that goal to begin with.

However, since Mi Jing Lun had already spoken, Yang Kai did not drag things out any further and just thanked him.

Xiang Shan also asked about Yang Kai’s struggle with the Territory Lords inside of the Black Ink Nest Space over the past few years. Naturally, Yang Kai explained everything to them without concealing any details.

The Army Commanders listened with raised brows, even Ou Yang Lie.

Even though he knew the outcome, he had never asked Yang Kai the details of the fight. It was only now that he realized just how devious Yang Kai’s method of attack was. Even they would not have been able to resist it if they were the Territory Lords. Unless they gave up on the Black Ink Nest, there was simply no solution for them in this matter.

One does not play the same trick thrice was true for Yang Kai, but also for the Black Ink Clan. After Yang Kai entered and left the Black Ink Nest Space thrice in a row, they made a firm decision to give up.

They did not have too many Territory Lords and Eighth-Order Black Ink Disciples left to lose after all.

Repairs were still going on in Great Evolution Pass, and the Army Commanders were also busy. After leaving matters here in Ou Yang Lie and Yang Kai’s hands, Xiang Shan and the others soon left.

Ou Yang Lie was a hands-off type of person, so the task of breeding a Black Ink Nest sub-nest was left to Yang Kai, and he did not refuse that responsibility either.

However, the Inner Sanctum was quick to move over a large amount of resources for this matter. After all, Yang Kai was already putting in the work, so it would be unreasonable to have him contribute the materials as well.

With the support of these resources, Yang Kai could rest assured and continue his attempts with increased boldness.

After failing again and again, Yang Kai finally got a hang of the process.

When his consciousness was connected to the Black Ink Nest’s consciousness, he could control the entire Black Ink Nest and use it to move the energy output of the Black Ink Pool.

The countless pits on the Black Ink Nest’s flesh wall were where the Black Ink Clansmen were born. If the Black Ink Nest’s energy was directed to these pits, then naturally, new Black Ink Clansmen would be born.

However, if all the energy was concentrated in the Black Ink Pool and not allowed to flow out, then once the energy reserves reached a certain level, a sub-nest would be created.

Yang Kai had to fail many times before finding this technique. Previously, he had been trying to find where the sub-nests were created, and since the pits were the breeding grounds for the Black Ink Clan, he assumed that the sub-nest would also be born from one of them.

In the end, he realized that something was not right about that speculation, and it turned out that the sub-nests were actually spawned from the Black Ink Pool itself.

After having found the solution, things were simple from there.

With a lot of resources invested, Yang Kai constantly gathered the Black Ink Nest’s energy inside of the Black Ink Pool, and at a certain point, the liquid in the Pool began to form waves as if something was about to rise out of it.

Under Yang Kai’s perception, he could clearly feel that it was a new sub-nest.

The black water parted, and a black growth resembling a flower bud emerged, just like the sub-nest that he saw back then at Zha Gu Feudal Lord’s place.

Yang Kai carefully picked it up and breathed a sigh of relief for a job well done.

However, when he considered how many resources it took to create this sub-nest, he could not help but feel speechless inside. It was no wonder why the Feudal Lords who had their own Black Ink Nests would treat them with such importance, and why most of the Feudal Lords had no Black Ink Nest of their own.

The cost to create a sub-nest was not small, so only a few Feudal Lords had the capital to afford one.

Moreover, this was only a Low-Rank sub-nest. It was not hard to imagine just how much it would cost to create a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest. It would probably cost several dozen to 100 times the amount of resources.

Ou Yang Lie rushed over after receiving the news, and as he looked at the sub-nest in Yang Kai’s hand, not even as large as one’s palm, he clicked his tongue in wonder, “Is this what a Black Ink Nest looks like when it’s just been spawned?”

“Indeed. I’ve seen one before in the hands of a Feudal Lord, and it is no different.”

“What is the next step?” Ou Yang Lie asked.

Yang Kai answered, “Even though the Black Ink Nest has been created, it still requires a significant amount of resources to nurture it. I intend to place this one inside my Small Universe to observe. If all goes well, then more sub-nests can be bred for the creation of our intelligence network.”

“Good!” Ou Yang Lie nodded. Yang Kai was not afraid of being corrupted by Black Ink Strength, so it did not matter if the Black Ink Nest was placed inside of his Small Universe. No one else would not have the guts to do such a thing.
