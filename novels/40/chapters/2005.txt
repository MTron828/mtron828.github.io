When Yang Kai turned his head and looked, he confirmed that six Origin Kings were approaching.

The leader of this group had a haughty air about him and a jade carved face, clearly indicating he came from a powerful background.

Also... it turned out to be someone Yang Kai knew.

The Young Palace Master of Flying Saint Palace, Ning Yuan Cheng!

In the black market that day, Ning Yuan Cheng and Mo Xiao Qi had gotten into a small conflict because of a Monster Beast Egg. At the time, Yang Kai had concealed his appearance and used some clever deception to frighten off Saint Palace’s group.

Now, he had unexpectedly run into these Flying Saint Palace cultivators again in the first layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, at this moment, the Second-Order Dao Source Realm master Liu Yi Zhi was nowhere to be seen. This was not a surprise though as the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was only open to those below the Dao Source Realm this time, so Ning Yuan Cheng could only bring along some Origin Kings with him.

It was unknown how he had managed to gather together his guards or why he was now trying to confront Yang Kai.

Although he knew who this person was, Yang Kai did not show any signs on his face at all.

He had hidden his appearance that day, so he believed that Ning Yuan Cheng would not recognize him at this moment.

“Do you need something?” Yang Kai turned his head and asked Ning Yuan Cheng faintly.

“Are you daft, boy? How could we have called for you to stop if we didn’t need something?” One of the Origin Kings behind Ning Yuan Cheng snapped in a cold tone.

Yang Kai sneered as he cast a cold glint towards the speaker.

“Don’t be rude,” Ning Yuan Cheng snapped, seemingly reprimanding his guard, immediately turning his eyes back to Yang Kai and cupping his fists while saying with a proud smile. “This friend, this one is Flying Saint Palace’s Young Palace Master, Ning Yuan Cheng. How many I address this friend?”

“If you have something to say, just say it, I have no interest in wasting time,” Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent.

He had understood the personality of this Ning Yuan Cheng and knew that he was only showing politeness now because he had yet to confirm what Yang Kai’s background was.

Perhaps... it had something to do with what happened in the black market that day; after all, once bitten by a snake, one would fear ropes for ten years.

Yang Kai’s reaction and demeanour caused Ning Yuan Cheng’s brows to furrow and he was clearly quite unhappy, but pressing that rage down, he continued, “In that case, this one will speak frankly. Just now, this little beast seems to have delivered something to Your Excellency, yes?”

“What of it?” Yang Kai immediately understood. Clearly this Ning Yuan Cheng regarded that jade slip as some kind of treasure and had come here in hopes of snatching it.

“What was it?” Ning Yuan Cheng’s eyes lit up as he continued to probe.

“What does it have to do with you?”

“Wild boy!” The guard who had spoken before suddenly became furious and exploded in anger, “Young Palace Master asked you a question, all you need to do is answer obediently! What thing are you to dare ask questions?

Ning Yuan Cheng waved his hand to stop the guard’s next action, but his expression gradually turned cold as his patience was also wearing thin, “This one is very interested in your little beast, I don’t know whether Your Excellency is willing to part with it? This one can offer...”

“Not interested,” Yang Kai refused without waiting for him to finish.

Without even mentioning that this little bat was a Tenth-Order’s Monster Beast, not a creature which could be casually cultivated or something Yang Kai would sell casually, it was not even his in the first place as it belonged to Mo Xiao Qi.

After speaking, he turned to leave.

“Friend seems to want to refuse a toast! Good, then you must drink a loss! Capture him for me!” Ning Yuan Cheng saw Yang Kai being so disrespectful and no longer bothered keeping up appearances, ordering his guards to act.

The five Origin Kings heard this order and immediately took action.

However, at that moment, the Heaven Escaping Bat which had been lightly hovering nearby suddenly opened its mouth and let out a series of sharp cries.

Sound waves visible to the naked eye spread out like ripples, covering the Flying Saint Palace cultivators in an instant.

All of a sudden, the five Origin Kings and Ning Yuan Cheng couldn’t help going pale as they felt their eardrum ring and their vitality tumble. Even their Source Qi began to riot inside their meridians.

Each of them wore a look of horror as they quickly roared and pushed their strength to resist their discomfort.

By the time they had recovered, Yang Kai and the little bat had already flown far away, becoming just a dot in the distance.

“Damn it! Follow him! No matter what, I must have that little beast. It seems able to find precious treasures and will play a big role in this place!” Ning Yuan Cheng angrily shouted.

The five guards did not dare to doddle and quickly used their Movement Skills to pursue.

But soon after, they completely lost sight of Yang Kai and the little bat.

“Where did they go?” Ning Yuan Cheng looked around but was unable to see any clues.

“Reporting to Young Palace Master, somehow, in the blink of an eye, that man and his beast just vanished,” One of the guards said with some uncertainty.

“They must be nearby, quickly search for them! How can this Young Master just watch his treasures fly away?” Ning Yuan Cheng said with a cruel expression.

The five guards immediately dispersed and began to search.

Not long after, a guard called out in pleasant surprise, “Young Palace Master, come quickly, it’s the entrance to the second layer!”

“What?” Ning Yuan Cheng was overjoyed when he heard these words but quickly snapped back, “Nonsense! The entrance to the second layer is a giant Five Coloured Light Pillar, an extremely obvious sight, you think this Young Master is so blind he cannot see... see... huh?”

As Ning Yuan Cheng was angrily shouting, he moved forward and suddenly raised his head to look up at the sky. Sure enough, the Five Coloured Light Pillar was standing right in front of him.

Frowning, he took a few steps and the Five Coloured Light Pillar in front of him disappeared just like that. Stepping forward again, the pillar of light reappeared.

“So strange?” Ning Yuan Cheng was shocked.

“En, Young Palace Master, this entrance seems to only be visible if one stands within a certain distance of it, otherwise it is impossible to detect even if one passes right by,” The guard who discovered the entrance said with enthusiasm.

“Those bastards from Star Soul Palace are really treacherous. Fortunately, this Young Master is one of Heaven’s favoured, otherwise, how could he have found this entrance? Hahahaha, what are we hesitating for? Let’s head to the second layer! That bastard from before must have also travelled to the second layer. Hmph, he won’t escape from this Young Master’s grasp!”

“Young Palace Master, that little beast may not only be able to find precious treasure, it most likely also discovered this entrance. It’s truly a strange beast.”

“Then this Young Master wants to possess it even more! Perhaps we can use it to find the entrance to the third layer, allowing us to go up and have a look,” Ning Yuan Cheng’s face was filled with fiery desire as he led his group of six into the Five Coloured Light Pillar, the next moment all of them disappearing.

However, after they reached the second layer, there was no sign of Yang Kai.

At the same time, somewhere in the second layer, Yang Kai was flying forward with the little bat leading the way.

Yang Kai knew that it was looking for Mo Xiao Qi, so he just leisurely followed after it while taking in the sights and scenes of the second layer.

It seemed to be no different from the first layer. The World Energy was still extremely thin, not suitable for cultivation. Moreover, the World Principles were still shattered and fragmented.

However, the second layer seemed to be much more dangerous than the first layer.

Yang Kai had explored the first layer for quite some time but did not encounter too many powerful traps and barriers.

But after arriving on the second layer, he could feel many hidden power fluctuations under the surveillance of his Divine Sense.

It was difficult to tell if these Spirit Arrays were man-made or naturally formed, but it was obvious that they would be triggered if he approached too close.

However, with the Heaven Escaping Bat leading the way, Yang Kai was not worried about whether he would encounter danger as this little beast seemed to have an innate ability to sense danger and was thus able to lead him along a safe path.

Half a day later, one beast and one person arrived at a windy gorge approximately a thousand metres across.

Yang Kai checked left and right to confirm that there was no danger before proceeding.

However, the moment the little bat flew over the canyon, it suddenly began squeaking in panic.

Yang Kai was shocked by this but before he could figure out what was wrong, he suddenly began to sink.

At that moment, there seemed to be a terrifying suction force coming from below, causing him to plummet uncontrollably.

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically.

Quickly pushing his strength, he tried to resist this downward suction.

But soon, Yang Kai discovered that his efforts were in vain. Even with his Third-Order Origin King cultivation, he was unable to slow his descent. As for the little bat, despite it being extremely agile in the air, it too failed to escape this force and spiralled down into the canyon below.

The wind whistled as the speed at which Yang Kai fell got faster and faster, the pressure even starting to sting his face.

Yang Kai finally began to panic.

He immediately understood that he had encountered some kind of extremely powerful trap, one that not only he couldn’t find, but even the Heaven Escaping Bat was unaware of.

Such a powerful restriction was unlikely to be man-made and instead had a high chance of being naturally formed.

Such Natural Spirit Arrays were generally incredibly difficult to detect until it was too late.

If his speed of descent continued to increase, even with Yang Kai’s powerful physique, Five Elements Indestructible Sword Tempering Art, and Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, he would definitely die on impact.

This would be an incredibly miserable death.

The sharp squeaking sound of the Heaven Escaping Bat continued to sound in Yang Kai’s ear, but the tone was quite distorted thanks to the incredible speed they were falling at.

Yang Kai struggled to sweep his eyes around but was unable to see anything. As a last resort, he released his Divine Sense widely and after some probing, finally gained some awareness of his surroundings.

Locking onto the little bat with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai flicked his wrist and sent out a Golden Blood Thread towards it; however, his accuracy was affected greatly by his current situation and failed to catch his target.

With no other choice, Yang Kai sent out a couple dozen Golden Blood Threads, forming a big net that finally managed to catch the little bat and bring it back to him.

The next moment, he hugged the little bat and escaped into the Sealed World Bead without hesitation.

A short time later, at the bottom of the canyon, a soft thud occurred as the Sealed World Bead bounced just once before coming to a stop.

It was not until a while later that Yang Kai dared to release his Divine Sense outside to check his surroundings.

However, the attractive force here was simply too terrifying, causing even his Divine Sense to warp the moment it left the Sealed World Bead.

Pondering for a moment, Yang Kai comforted the Heaven Escaping Bat for a bit before leaving it in the Sealed World Bead and moving outside.

The next moment, Yang Kai shrunk as he was sucked down towards the ground, finding it difficult to even lift a finger.

“A natural gravity field?” Yang Kai’s expression contorted.
