Yang Kai said in amazement, “Aren’t you afraid that Ice Heart Valley might not be happy that you’re sending charcoal to Seeking Passion Sect in such an imposing manner?”

The news of the feud between Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley had spread throughout the Northern Territory as well, so now that they came here under the guise of ‘assisting’, if Ice Heart Valley heard about this, they would definitely not forgive them.

Li Qing Yuan smiled, “Ice Heart Valley won’t be so petty. Senior Bing Yun is a wise and generous leader. Since we didn’t directly oppose Ice Heart Valley, she naturally doesn’t have any reason to be angry with us.”

“Exactly, although the women of Ice Heart Valley are cold, they are all reasonable people. They wouldn’t mind something small like this.”

“I see!” Yang Kai’s face expressed comprehension and nodded lightly.

As the saying goes, ‘a gentleman can be bullied’. Although this saying was a bit inappropriate to apply to the women of Ice Heart Valley, it was apt enough.

From another point of view, if Ice Heart Valley was the one in catastrophe, and they had gone to their aid, the Seeking Passion Sect would definitely not let these people off.

It was precisely because they understood how Ice Heart Valley would have handled the situation that they felt confident being here.

“Little Brother, you haven’t told us about the situation inside the Seeking Passion Sect yet.” Li Qing Yuan noticed that the topic was heading tangent, and quickly brought it back.

Yang Kai replied lightly, “Seeking Passion Sect’s top Masters were all wiped out, and countless disciples either died or were critically wounded. What else could happen? The tree has fallen and the monkeys have scattered.”

Li Qing Yuan’s eyes lit up as he listened, asking in pleasant surprise, “If that’s the case, Seeking Passion Sect should be empty right now, yes?”

Yang Kai looked at him in ridicule, “Friend looks very happy to hear this. Didn’t you come to show concern and provide assistance?”

Li Qing Yuan’s face immediately scrunched up in sadness, “There’s nothing to be happy about. This King is very heartbroken now. Seeking Passion Sect is… I mean, was a dignified top Sect, and has now been tragically exterminated, together with its tens of thousands of years worth of inherited foundation. It is a big loss for us in the Northern Territory.”

“What a pity, what a pity. A true pity.”

“Such a great force. How could it suddenly be destroyed?”

The rest of the people sighed so sorrowfully that anyone not aware of the truth would think that they really had a close relationship with the Seeking Passion Sect.

Li Qing Yuan quickly changed the focus of the conversation, his eyes scorching as he asked, “Little Brother just came out of Seeking Passion Sect, didn’t you? Did you perhaps… find anything inside?”

At this point, there was no need to hurry to gain a windfall since Yang Kai was a step ahead of them in getting into Seeking Passion Sect, and would have looted everything if there was anything.

It was safest to keep his eyes on Yang Kai.

“I found their Treasury actually!” Yang Kai just had to say things that would trigger everyone.

Countless pairs of greedy and covetous eyes turned to Yang Kai like sharp swords.

“And what was inside the Treasury?” Li Qing Yuan’s voice trembled involuntarily.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Source Crystals, hundreds of millions of Source Crystals, Low-Rank, Mid-Rank, High-Rank, everything, all kinds of rare herbs, Emperor Artifacts, ancient records, Secret Arts. Basically, what you can and cannot imagine.”

*Ssii…*

Everyone took in a breath of cold air, excitement stirred up in them as a gleam of greed flourished in their eyes.

Yang Kai looked at everyone with a smile, and commented, “You all seem to be very interested in these treasures.”

Li Qing Yuan resisted the urge to gulp as he plotted how to take down this little brat who did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth, then swallow all the loot on his own. If he could attain the complete heritage of the Seeking Passion Sect, his Soaring Yuan Pavilion’s strength would definitely be improved immensely, and it might even be possible to become the second Seeking Passion Sect.

Many people had similar thoughts here, so for a while, everyone began seeing enemies everywhere, causing their vigilance to spike.

“Little brat, you are full of nonsense!” A voice suddenly spoke up, “It’s true that the Seeking Passion Sect has a Treasury, but how could you open it with just your strength? You are full of schemes, harbouring evil intentions at such a young age. Everyone, don’t be fooled by him!”

Slightly startled by this statement, the audience suddenly felt that what this person said made sense.

Seeking Passion Sect was such a big Sect, and it was obvious that it would have its own Treasury, but could this kind of place be opened casually? Only people like Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo would know how to open the Treasury.

Li Qing Yuan came back to his senses and suddenly grumbled with dissatisfaction, “Little Brother is being a bit unkind.”

Yang Kai smiled disdainfully, “It’s up to you to believe me or not!”

Saying so, he suddenly summoned a strange stone from his Space Ring. It was about ten metres in height and as soon as it was taken out, the surrounding temperature dropped as it exuded an extremely cold aura.

The dozen Emperor Realm Masters who were enveloped by this aura instantly felt rigid as their Qi began to stagnate slightly.

“This is…”

“Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron!”

“What? That’s Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron? How could there be such a big piece of such a treasure in this world?”

“Heavens, where did this thing come from? I heard that just a fist-sized piece of Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron could refine an Emperor Artifact! How many Emperor Artifacts could be refined from a ten-metre tall slab of it?”

“If it was sold, this piece alone would cost at least a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals!”

“This little brat didn’t lie! He definitely opened the Treasury in the Seeking Passion Sect. This must have belonged to the Seeking Passion Sect!”

…..

The air was filled with murmurs as all eyes were glued to the ten metre tall Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron. The shock of the crowd was palpable. This thing alone was priceless, and if Yang Kai really opened the Treasury of Seeking Passion Sect, how many more treasures had he plundered?

The previous suspicions disappeared all at once as everyone felt that Yang Kai had picked up a massive bargain in Seeking Passion Sect, and many Emperor Realm Masters were eager to take action. They looked at the Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron with avarice, prepared to rush over to snatch it in the next moment.

However, due to them having too many opponents, no one dared to act at will, and the situation suddenly became deadlocked.

More people, however, were curious as to why Yang Kai had taken out such a rare treasure so suddenly? Was it to show off his wealth? That couldn’t be the case unless he wanted to cause trouble for himself.

While everyone was suspicious, Yang Kai waved his hand and summoned the Myriads Sword. Emperor Qi poured into the sword, and Space Principles began winding around it as he swung the Myriads Sword, carving something into the Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron.

“What is this kid doing?”

“It looks like he’s writing something.”

“What a reckless waste! How could he use such a treasure like an ordinary slate? How outrageous!”

*Chi chi chi… *

No matter how angry and spurned they were though, Yang Kai continued to etch the strokes one by one with a focused and meticulous face. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After a full stick of incense, Yang Kai suddenly took a deep breath and put the Myriads Sword away, his face slightly pale. It seemed that this action had consumed quite a bit of his strength.

After all, this was a high-grade Artifact Refining material, not something easy to even carve a single stroke into.

Yang Kai took a closer look at his work and was quite satisfied with his masterpiece.

At this moment, a strong wind suddenly blew, and the dust and debris from the engraving on the Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron was blown away, revealing three large lively and vigorous calligraphies. The font was not stunning, but it gave off a strange sensation like it was drawing in one’s vision and swallowing their mind, making it impossible to extricate oneself from its sight.

“High Heaven Palace?”

Someone read the three big characters that were engraved on Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron, which immediately bewildered the rest of them.

“What thing is High Heaven Palace?”

“It sounds like the name of a Sect, but does the Northern Territory have such a Sect?”

“Never heard of it.”

Li Qing Yuan thought for a moment and asked Yang Kai, “Little Brother, what do you mean by this?”

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and patted the Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron beside him with a laugh, “Nothing much, I just want to tell everyone that from now on, this land is the base of my Sect, High Heaven Palace. It’s good that we have many guests today, that will save the effort of notifying everyone one by one. I hope these friends will help this Young Master publicize this matter after you go back today. En, don’t blame this Young Master for being ruthless to anyone who tries to invade the territory of my High Heaven Palace casually.”

“What!? What does this little brat mean?”

“Does he want to found a Sect?”

“What a joke. What gave a trivial brat the confidence to establish a Sect here?”

“Exactly! This is the legacy of the Seeking Passion Sect! He is far from qualified to occupy it!”

“This boy is quite ambitious, but I’m afraid that his fate is thinner than paper!”

…..

Yang Kai’s ears were filled with their murmurs, but still, he remained as steady as a mountain. He waited for them to finish before sneering, “Does everyone have an opinion? You should all hold that back if you do, don’t make everyone else unhappy!”

“Boy, you’re far too rampant! Do you really think the Northern Territory is yours to do with as you please?”

Li Qing Yuan was also sullen-faced, “Little brat, don’t go too far! Since we are here today, you cannot make such decisions alone. The Seeking Passion Sect is part of our region, the Northern Territory, so ownership of its base and Treasury should be decided by the heroes of the Northern Territory, and definitely not by you!”

This sentence changed the issue regarding the legacy of the Seeking Passion Sect into a matter of the Northern Territory. Li Qing Yuan was indeed an old fox, and everyone applauded in agreement.

Yang Kai jeered, “This place is now this Young Master’s territory, so naturally everything about it is for me to decide. Those who refuse to accept can stand forward now.”

“Sect Master Li, this little brat is too disrespectful, we must teach him a lesson today!”

“Yes, we have given him enough face, but he’s just too insatiable. There’s no need to negotiate with him.”

“Let’s do it. Now that the Seeking Passion Sect is no more, there is nothing to worry about.”

They did not dare to break in before because they were afraid of any Masters who might have stayed back in Seeking Passion Sect. Now that it was confirmed that there was no one left in the Seeking Passion Sect, it was intolerable that Yang Kai had acquired the treasures and still wanted to occupy this large piece of land all to himself.

A trace of determination flashed in Li Qing Yuan’s eyes, and he nodded, “Good, since he wants to persist in his delusions, we shall break them for him.”

As his words fell, he had already charged out.

The rest were naturally unwilling to lag behind and followed behind to rush towards Yang Kai, all aiming to grab hold of Yang Kai’s Space Ring.

Given that Yang Kai could casually take out a ten-metre tall piece of Ten Thousand Year Frozen Heart Iron, they believed that there must be countless treasures still in his Space Ring.

In an instant, the scene had become increasingly animated as the dozen Emperor Realm Masters became overbearing and aggressive, rushing towards Yang Kai.
