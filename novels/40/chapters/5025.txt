Feng Ying soon understood what was going on, “You just sent the Universe World back to Blue Sky Pass. In that case, the soldiers from the Inner Sanctum only have to extract resources at our doorstep instead of travelling to faraway places. We also no longer have to worry about the Black Ink Clan launching sneak attacks on us.”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded.

“Did you achieve it by using those eight artifacts?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, “The Army Commanders from the Inner Sanctum have become aware of it as well. Senior Shen Tu will come over and give it a try soon, so I have to get prepared. Please stand guard for me, Senior Sister.”

Feng Ying nodded, “I’ll go with you.”

Soon, they targeted another Universe World. It took Yang Kai some time to place the eight Void Yang Mirrors in eight spots around the Universe World.

Shen Tu Mo, despite being an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, still hadn’t arrived yet. Certainly, he could make use of the Universe Array to instantly move from Blue Sky Pass to the Purifying Black Ink Battleship in the fourth forward base; however, it would take him some time to come to this location. He should be on his way now.

Meanwhile, Feng Ying was extremely curious about the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors. Faced with her questions, Yang Kai replied to her.

One day later, Yang Kai, who was taking a rest, suddenly opened his eyes. He could see a ray of light rapidly approaching from the direction of the forward base. Upon its arrival, Shen Tu Mo’s burly figure was revealed.

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Senior Shen Tu.”

After a nod, Shen Tu Mo glanced at the Universe World beside them and asked, “Have you gotten everything ready?”

“Yes.”

“What do you need this Old Master to do?”

Yang Kai replied, “Senior Shen Tu, I need you to memorise the exact distribution of the Void Yang Mirrors and the distances between them. When you return to Blue Sky Pass, you have to accurately set up the Void Yin Mirrors in the same way. Only then would the preparations be considered complete. When you activate them, the Yin Mirrors and Yang Mirrors will resonate with each other and exchange places, transferring the Universe World back to Blue Sky Pass.”

Shen Tu Mo nodded, “Good.”

Harsh conditions had to be met as the distribution of all eight artifacts and the distances between them had to be perfectly accurate. Nevertheless, this wasn’t difficult for an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Shen Tu Mo. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It only took him an hour to take a stroll around the eight artifacts and memorise everything perfectly.

When he returned to Yang Kai’s side, he nodded at him to show that he was ready.

Yang Kai gazed at Feng Ying, “You can head back first, Senior Sister. I’ll be returning to the Inner Sanctum again with Senior Shen Tu. If everything goes well, I probably won’t be back anytime soon. You’ll have to take charge of affairs here.”

Feng Ying replied, “Don’t worry about it, Junior Brother. I’ll take care of Dawn.”

It was then Yang Kai turned to Shen Tu Mo, “Senior Shen Tu, whenever you’re ready.”

Without saying anything, Shen Tu Mo directly activated the Universe Transference Law. Soon, a Grand Array lit up beneath his feet and engulfed him.

When his figure vanished, Yang Kai also activated the Universe Transference Law and returned to Blue Sky Pass.

Zhong Liang and the others were still waiting outside the Inner Sanctum. Even though it had taken Shen Tu Mo more than a day to go back and forth between the places, they wouldn’t have minded waiting for an entire month as this matter was that important.

If this worked, it would be extremely beneficial to all the Humans on the Black Ink Battlefield. The waiting time was inconsequential.

“They’re back,” Ding Yao suddenly turned to look in Blue Sky Pass’s direction. Everyone turned their heads and indeed saw two figures flying out of the Inner Sanctum. They were none other than Shen Tu Mo and Yang Kai.

As the Eighth-Order Masters watched the two of them rapidly approaching, they couldn’t help but still be awestruck by the convenience of the Universe Arrays.

It only took them slightly more than a day to go back and forth between Blue Sky Pass and the fourth forward base. Such a feat was inconceivable in the past; however, with the help of Universe Arrays now, they could move between distant places quickly. Such convenience was extremely useful when dealing with the enemies.

The moment Shen Tu Mo stood by their side, Ding Yao hurriedly asked, “How is it?”

Shen Tu Mo replied, “I still have to set things up. We’ll soon find out whether it’s usable or not.”

Yang Kai was just standing behind Shen Tu Mo as he took a glance at the Universe World he had moved to this place. At this moment, it was bustling with noise over there as many figures were flying around the Universe World. It was obvious that they were extracting resources. After barely one day, the Universe World seemed to have shrunk significantly. At this rate, it would only take two or three months before the Universe World was completely mined out. This was the result despite the fact that not a lot of people had been told to come over and extract resources. If Blue Sky Pass had sent more people over, the time needed would have been shortened further.

A shocked Yang Kai asked, “They’ve already started?”

Zhong Liang grinned, “On the Black Ink Battlefield, the resources will only be ours after they’re extracted. Alright, enough nonsense, bring Shen Tu Mo to make the arrangement. We’re still waiting for the result.”

“Yes,” Yang Kai promptly replied.

They then moved to another place and found an open space. Following Yang Kai’s instructions, Shen Tu Mo soon set up all eight Void Yin Mirrors.

It was time to verify the feasibility of their plan. Yang Kai told Shen Tu Mo the method to activate the mirrors and then stepped back.

Before everyone’s eyes, Shen Tu Mo rapidly performed different hand seals and then infused his own power into the eight artifacts.

A faint light was seen flickering on these artifacts, and a buzzing sound rang out. The Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters didn’t even blink.

As time passed, the light around the artifacts became brighter and the humming became louder. The Void around these eight artifacts started contorting and a gigantic figure was faintly seen appearing where originally there was nothing.

Zhong Liang arched his brow and nodded, “It’s working.”

He had seen the same sight when Yang Kai activated the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors some time ago. Whatever Shen Tu Mo was doing seemed to be working.

If nothing unexpected happened, the Universe World near the fourth forward base would be moved to this place soon.

However, things didn’t go so smoothly.

The gigantic figure remained faintly discernible but couldn’t seem to materialise. It wasn’t until an entire hour later that the process was completed.

Shen Tu Mo stopped performing hand seals and the light around the eight mirrors faded. At the same time, the resonance with the distant horizon was cut off.

The Eighth-Order Masters appeared elated. What they had witnessed suggested that anyone could use the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors. In that case, they could easily move the Universe Worlds back from the resource-harvesting areas without any restrictions.

On the other hand, Zhong Liang furrowed his brow. That was because he realised that even though Shen Tu Mo was much stronger than Yang Kai, it was far more difficult for him to use this treasure. He wasn’t comparable to Yang Kai at all when it came to the time it took. If everything was properly set up, it would only take Yang Kai a few dozen breaths to move a Universe World back. Nevertheless, it took Shen Tu Mo a whole hour to do so. Moreover, it seemed that he had consumed a lot of energy in the process, much unlike how easy it felt for Yang Kai to achieve.

Upon noticing his doubt, Yang Kai explained, “This treasure was specifically refined for my use, so mastery over the Dao of Space was taken as a given. Therefore, it’s easier for me to use. Although Senior Shen Tu is stronger than me, he has never cultivated the Dao of Space before, so it’s only natural that he has to consume more energy to forcefully activate it.”

Zhong Liang nodded gently, “I see.”

With that said, the outcome was more than satisfactory. They were most worried that only Yang Kai would be able to use the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.

Upon Shen Tu Mo’s return, they all looked inquisitively at him.

After giving it a thought, he spoke, “An average Seventh-Order Master wouldn’t be able to activate this thing. Only the most powerful Seventh Orders would be barely capable of doing it. Moreover, the consumption of energy when activating this treasure is related to the size of the target and the distance. The larger the size and the longer the distance, the more energy will be consumed. Still, it’s usable.”

“Good!” Ding Yao breathed a sigh of relief.

Liang Yu Long nodded, “Since it’s usable, this matter cannot be delayed. We need to have the Inner Sanctum refine more of them. However, there are sixteen artifacts in total, and each one of them is quite large. A lot of resources will be needed.”

It certainly required a lot of resources to refine a set of Void Yin-Yang Mirrors. Back then, it cost Yang Kai an arm and a leg to make just one set, but the price was worth it considering the rewards he got out of them.

Zhong Liang grinned, “No pain, no gain. It might be a big investment up front, but the payout we’ll get later more than makes up for it. I’d like to see the looks on those Black Ink bastards’ faces when they reoccupy the resource harvesting areas a few dozen years from now and see that there’s nothing left.”

All of them couldn’t help but let their thoughts run wild as they put on wicked grins.

Ding Yao suggested by saying, “I don’t think there’s a need to create a lot of them. Ten sets should do; otherwise, it’ll be a waste of resources.”

The other Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters nodded, “You have a point.”

“Also, the refinement method has to be passed on to other Great Passes. We can’t keep such a good thing all to ourselves.”

“Of course.”

As soon as Purifying Black Ink Battleship and Purifying Light became widely usable, those from Blue Sky Pass immediately informed the other Great Passes about it. The other Great Passes then refined their own Purifying Black Ink Battleships before sending powerful Masters to bring them to Blue Sky Pass as Yang Kai was the only one who could equip them with Universe Arrays and Purifying Light.

Otherwise, the Humans from these Great Passes wouldn’t be willing to use the Hyper Space Arrays to move people around on the Black Ink Battlefield where every resource was incredibly valuable.

Certainly, they had to share the method of making the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors with the others. Since the transfer of cultivators was not involved, only a small amount of resources would be needed.

“Yang Kai, you’ve made a big contribution again. You put Old Masters like us to shame.” Zhong Liang turned to look at Yang Kai with a satisfied and joyful expression. Since Yang Kai’s arrival at Blue Sky Pass, he had brought a lot of pleasant surprises to them. If not for the fact that Zhong Liang didn’t have a daughter, he would have asked Yang Kai to be his Son-in-Law.

Yang Kai replied humbly, “It was just something I created accidentally many years ago. It’s fortunate enough that this treasure is useful here. I don’t deserve your compliment, Army Commander.”

With a serious expression, Zhong Liang said, “The Void Yin-Yang Mirrors is of great help to us. All Humans from the Great Passes, including Blue Sky Pass, have to take the risk to mine resources. In the past, the Black Ink Clan would always come to harass us and some of our members would inevitably die. With the Void Yin-Yang Mirrors, we no longer have to worry about this.”

All of them nodded in agreement; after all, the Black Ink Battlefield was the home turf of the Black Ink Clan. The living conditions here were too harsh for Humans. In the past, they could only rely on the incredible might of the Great Passes to fend off the attacks from the Black Ink Clan. Even so, every generation, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had to send many people over to help hold the line.
