Even Emperor Realm Masters had to pay respects to the daughter of the Martial Beast Great Emperor, but Yang Kai actually dared to reach out and hug her. If this matter reached the ears of the Martial Beast Great Emperor, Yang Kai would be chopped into pieces even if he escaped to the ends of the world.

Not to mention the Martial Beast Great Emperor, if any daughter of an Emperor Realm Master was to be molested by a man, how could it be easily let go?

To his surprise though, Xiao Chen soon discovered that the little Princess did not have the slightest intention of resisting Yang Kai’s embrace. Instead, she wrapped her arms around Yang Kai’s neck, her tender body clinging close to him.

Xiao Chen’s eyes were burning from envy and jealousy.

Was there really such a good thing in this world?

Strangely, Xiao Chen grinned gently and quickly approached Lan Xun, stretching out his broad arms to embrace her too.

However, before he could do anything, Lan Xun suddenly turned around and a pink fist punched directly at him.

Xiao Chen, despite already being an Emperor Realm Master, did not dare to use any strength to avoid this punch, so it directly landed on his nose with a clean thud. He instantly saw stars in front of his eyes as his head spun.

“What are you doing?” Lan Xun asked coldly, looking extremely displeased.

“It’s nothing, nothing…” Xiao Chen stood in awkwardness, blood dripping from his nose comically.

On the other side, after Yang Kai separated Mo Xiao Qi a good distance away from Lan Xun, only then did he finally notice the amazingly soft and elastic sensation on his chest.

He could not help blushing as he patted Mo Xiao Qi who was still clinging on to him and said, “Alright, alright, get down first to avoid others gossiping, then we’ll talk.”

At his words, Mo Xiao Qi quickly jumped off Yang Kai. In realization of the inappropriateness of her actions, her face flushed, “Big Brother Yang, it’s really you!”

Yang Kai chuckled and examined her up and down, “I haven’t seen you for just a few years, but you’ve grown up a lot.”

Mo Xiao Qi’s nostrils flared and grumbled, “Rascal!”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, “I only said you’ve grown up, what were you thinking?”

Mo Xiao Qi then examined Yang Kai seriously and nodded, “Big Brother Yang has also become much stronger.”

Yang Kai was only a First-Order Dao Source Realm when she left Maplewood City, but now he was already in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm. For a cultivator who had no Sect or family behind him, this kind of growth was amazing.

Mo Xiao Qi could only make such big progress because her identity was different from others.

The Martial Beast Great Emperor had personally guided her, and under her Aunty Feng’s supervision and with the inexhaustible cultivation resources of Spirit Beast Island, it would be strange if she had not grown rapidly.

While the two were talking, Liu Yan and Zhang Ruo Xi had flown over to join them.

Mo Xiao Qi smiled as she explained, “When I entered the Shattered Star Sea, I expected that I would be able to meet Big Brother Yang, but still hadn’t seen you for more than two years. I only had confirmation that you were really here after I met up with Big Sister Liu Yan.”

Liu Yan knew Mo Xiao Qi as the two girls had met in Maplewood City when Liu Yan was still just an Artifact Spirit. Although there was a huge difference in her compared to the last time they met, Liu Yan’s aura had not changed much, so Mo Xiao Qi recognised her easily when they bumped into each other.

Together, they went to the Source Sea, and Yang Kai knew what happened after that.

Yang Kai stole a glance at Lan Xun and asked, “Xiao Qi, why did you fight with Princess Lan Xun?”

Mo Xiao Qi glared over at her resentfully and snorted, “Just some old grievances.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened, “How old are you two? What old grievances could you have?”

Although both Mo Xiao Qi and Lan Xun had powerful Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivations, they were still very young, only in their early twenties. Only descendants of Great Emperors could achieve this kind of cultivation at their age.

“Why not? When she was a little kid, she robbed me of a beautiful dress when she visited Spirit Beast Island with Sir Bright Moon.”

“That’s it?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened.

“That was my favourite dress. Aunty Feng made it for me by hand. I cried for many days,” Mo Xiao Qi sobbed aggrievedly.

[It’s impossible to understand women.] Yang Kai thought helplessly.

While they were talking, Lan Xun and Xiao Chen approached them slowly. Keeping a short distance away from Mo Xiao Qi, Lan Xun asked, “Little Sister Xiao Qi, do you still want to fight?”

Mo Xiao Qi glared at her, “If you want to, I’m more than willing. Who’s afraid of you?”

Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes flashed as she smiled politely, “It looks like Little Sister is still up for a fight!”

Mo Xiao Qi snorted, “You’re talking as if you have won, how thick-skinned.”

Lan Xun responded, “Didn’t I? Elder Sister did have the upper hand in that battle…”

Mo Xiao Qi flushed red and gritted her teeth as she snarled, “That’s because you’re older. I will definitely not lose to you when I am your age!”

The smile on Lan Xun’s face faded suddenly and the surrounding temperature seemed to drop sharply, causing a chill to creep into everyone’s bones.

Yang Kai and Xiao Chen shuddered, both of them aware that something bad was about to happen.

Mo Xiao Qi and Lan Xun were basically the same age, with Lan Xun maybe being two or three years older. Two or three years was essentially no difference at all, but the word ‘older’ from Mo Xiao Qi undoubtedly touched a nerve.

The two girls who had just stopped fighting were at odds with each other once more, their enchanting eyes glaring at one another as sparks seemed to be flying between them, a new battle threatening to break out at any moment.

Yang Kai made eye contact with Xiao Chen hurriedly, signalling him for assistance.

But Xiao Chen just snorted and wiped the blood from his nose, turning his gaze away.

[Waste!] Yang Kai cursed inside. He could only brace himself and intervene with a smile, “Alright now, you already duelled, so stop acting so hostile. You two are childhood playmates, you have to appreciate this precious friendship. Come, shake hands and be good friends again.”

“Who would be good friends with her?!” The two young women ground their teeth and pointed bitterly.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and continued his persuasion, “Even if you are not good friends, it’s not good to always settle matters with violence. A lady should be reserved and measured, it is highly improper to always be using force!”

Mo Xiao Qi pouted, looking extremely indignant.

Lan Xun’s eyes flashed as she turned her gaze to Yang Kai, smiling lightly in acknowledgement, “What Senior Brother Yang said is right, Lan Xun was wrong to be so petty with Little Sister. Little Sister Xiao Qi, don’t be angry, Elder Sister will apologize to you.”

“Hmph!” Mo Xiao Qi twisted her head aside, ignoring Lan Xun.

Lan Xun did not seem to be bothered, instead turning her attention to Yang Kai, “It’s surprising that Senior Brother Yang knows Little Sister Xiao Qi. Little Sister Xiao Qi lives in the Eastern Territory and I have only met her once when I was young. How did Senior Brother Yang get to know her?”

Unsure of the intention behind her queries, Yang Kai sensed a hint of malice so he laughed awkwardly and casually explained, “It was a coincidence, nothing special.”

Mo Xiao Qi glared at Lan Xun warily, “You old woman, is it possible that you are interested in my Big Brother Yang? Why do you want to know so much?”

As soon as this statement came out, Zhang Ruo Xi could not help but gasp, her little hands covering her own red lips. On the other side, Lan Xun also blushed slightly, her brow furrowing. Liu Yan, on the contrary, looked on with interest.

Lan Xun snapped, “This little girl doesn’t know how to think before she speaks.”

Mo Xiao Qi grimaced and retorted, “If you have a clean conscience, why are you so nervous?”

Lan Xun was furious. She was just curious about how Yang Kai could meet someone like Mo Xiao Qi and have such a close relationship, she did not expect to be teased by Mo Xiao Qi, incensing her.

Annoyed, she gritted her pristine teeth and shot back, “It’s true, Elder Sister is very interested in your Big Brother Yang and plans to bring him back and introduce him to Lord Father as a potential son-in-law. What do you think about that, Little Sister?”

It was Mo Xiao Qi’s turn to gasp dumbfounded this time. She looked at Lan Xun in amazement, and then at Yang Kai before she stomped her foot angrily, “You evil woman! Why do you have to snatch everything from me?” She fumed, “You snatched my clothes when we were children, and now you want to take away my Big Brother Yang!”

As she screamed, she hugged Yang Kai’s arm tightly, ignoring how her plump peaks deformed greatly from the force of her grip. She ground her teeth and declared resolutely, “I’ll fight you to the death if you dare to come for him!”

Lan Xun burst into laughter and rose to the challenge, “That will depend on which one of us your Big Brother Yang favours. Do you think he would prefer a little girl who’s so unreasonable like you, or a woman who’s knowledgeable and understanding like Elder Sister?”

While she was speaking, she exuded an extremely appealing elegance and grace using some unknown Secret Technique;

Xiao Chen gulped as he watched from the sidelines, his eyes peeled and glued on Lan Xun.

Mo Xiao Qi flushed anxiously, still clinging onto Yang Kai’s arm tightly, unwilling to let go, she glowered, “What’s so great about you? Aunty Feng is a million times more beautiful than you!”

“Senior Jiu Feng?” Lan Xun suddenly looked serious.

Mo Xiao Qi raised her head proudly, “Yes, can you compare to Aunty Feng?”

She snorted, then spoke to Yang Kai again, “Big Brother Yang, ignore this old woman. If you like to see beautiful women, come to Spirit Beast Island, and I will introduce Aunty Feng to you!”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, not sure of how to respond.

Lan Xun looked at Mo Xiao Qi in astonishment. She did not know whether to laugh or cry at what Mo Xiao Qi said. She knew that this girl must have lived on the Spirit Beast Island all year round and was extremely sheltered by her Seniors. As such, it was natural for her to not be well versed in the topics of men and women. The reason she cared so much about Yang Kai might just be an instinctive reaction to oppose Lan Xun.

Lan Xun suddenly felt dull and ridiculous for fighting with her and nodded, “Compared to Senior Jiu Feng, I am obviously inferior. Okay, Little Sister Xiao Qi, you win this time.”

When Mo Xiao Qi heard this, her face instantly lifted with joy, replying merrily, “You are also good, just a little bit inferior to me!”

Lan Xun shook her head and smiled wryly.
