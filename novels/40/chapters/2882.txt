Facing Yang Kai’s question, Fei Li answered bitterly, “None of us had thought that Mo Duo would come so suddenly. He began this deployment after his arrival, and I always had to follow him, so I did not have the opportunity to deliver any messages.”

Yang Kai was silent, which made Fei Li a little nervous. He wondered if Yang Kai would be mad with him because of the demise of his Clan. Fortunately, after a while, Yang Kai asked another question, “How much strength can Mo Duo use now?”

Fei Li let out a sigh of relief as he replied, “He was wounded when passing through the passage of the World Barrier. Right now, he should only be able to use sixty to seventy percent of his true strength, but if he is given enough time to heal, he will become stronger and stronger and eventually recover to his peak.”

“Sixty to seventy percent…” Yang Kai mumbled. It seemed that his guess was right. Although Mo Duo was comparable to a Great Emperor, he could not exert his full strength at the moment. However, even a Great Emperor with sixty to seventy percent of their strength was by no means someone he could compete with.

“Sir, I’ve been exposed. I’m afraid I can’t go back now.” Fei Li remarked.

He left with four Demon Kings on this mission, and now he was the only one alive. If there was no Demon Saint, many of the Demon Kings would not have much of a say for his strength was superior to theirs, but if he had to face Mo Duo when he went back, he would definitely be suspected.

“En.” Yang nodded, obviously anticipating this, “I want you to take me to Fort Torrent.”

“Fort Torrent!” Fei Li was surprised, and immediately understood Yang Kai’s plan, “Sir, do you really want to kill three hundred thousand Demons?”

“Did you think I was joking?” Yang Kai glanced at him faintly.

Fei Li shivered, and replied anxiously, “But there are more than a hundred thousand Demons at Fort Torrent!”

Over the past month, close to two hundred thousand Demons had died at Yang Kai’s hands, and adding those Demons in Fort Torrent, it would be almost three hundred thousand.

However, the largest base that was recently destroyed by Yang Kai was only garrisoned by ten thousand Demons. Moreover, because of his hunting everywhere, the defensive line of the Demons shrank more and more, and the scattered Demons were all summoned to one place, which turned Fort Torrent into one of the biggest strongholds. As far as Fei Li knew, there were as many as eight Demon Kings there, along with more than a hundred thousand clansmen. Why was Sir Shaman Niu so daring to target such a place?

Yang Kai glanced at him, “I’m not alone!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Fei Li was stunned but soon realized what Yang Kai meant.

It seemed that it was time for the chess pieces placed by Sir Shaman Niu in the Demon Clan to shine.

Fort Torrent was originally the capital of a huge Barbarian Clan, but it was destroyed by the invasion of the Demon Race, so the territory was occupied.

Hundreds of thousands of Demons gathered here, and their Demon Qi almost turned the entire place black. Eight Demon Kings were in charge here, with countless Demon Great Generals and Demon Generals under their command, securing this place.

Because they were still in the rear, the Demons here had not fought with the foreign race for the time being; however, these bloodthirsty and aggressive Demons yearned for a fight every day. They could not wait to slaughter those weak foreign races and capture this vast land.

Fei Li’s uninvited arrival surprised the eight Demon Kings who were guarding here. However, with Fei Li’s strength and reputation, even if everyone was surprised, they did not show much vigilance. Instead, they warmly welcomed him while subtly probing his purpose for coming here.

Fei Li kept silent and maintained a mysterious look, which made everyone not dare ask more, wondering whether he was here on some mission for Senior Mo Duo.

Strength Demon You La was among the Demon Kings in Fort Torrent and was able to learn a lot of information through Fei Li’s eye signal, which made him nervous.

Soon, more Demon Kings arrived at Fort Torrent.

Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo, Flame Demon Lai Wen, Snow Demon Ah Shi Na…

In just three days, including Fei Li, a total of seven additional Demon Kings gathered here from all directions, which suddenly increased the number of Demon Kings in Fort Torrent to fifteen.

This situation was extremely rare.

After Mo Duo arrived, each Demon King had been given his or her own responsibilities and territory to protect, and they would not leave their duties easily. Nevertheless, the arrival of Fei Li and the others had broken this norm.

Even the most foolish Demon King would know that something was up.

Everyone continued to probe the newly arrived Demon Kings before finally coming to a conclusion, they were indeed sent here by Senior Mo Duo. However, no one knew the purpose of their coming here. Only Fei Li knew everything.

Unfortunately, Fei Li had secluded himself in his room all this time, which made it impossible for them to approach him.

This suspicion ended five days after Fei Li’s arrival. In the largest building of Fort Torrent, a total of fifteen Demon Kings assembled together. Fei Li sat at the head of the hall, despite being a guest, and the ghost fire in his eyes was as calm as a spring lake.

The other fourteen Demon Kings were sitting on either side of the table, and no one was making any noise, every pair of eyes locked on Fei Li.

Fei Li looked up suddenly, and announced, “There are traitors among us!”

The hall suddenly fell silent, and only after a long time did one Demon King mutter, “Fei Li, are you kidding?”

“Yes, how can there be traitors among us? What can the inferior foreign race use to bribe us Demon Kings?”

“Fei Li, if this is a joke, it’s not funny.”

Several Demon Kings could not help clamouring.

Fei Li remarked, “This is Senior Mo Duo’s judgment!”

The clamorous crowd instantly shut up and became serious, all of them starting to look around and examine their companions carefully.

They could laugh it off and choose not to believe it if it was Fei Li who suspected there were traitors among them, but if it was Senior Mo Duo’s judgment, it must be serious.

Senior Mo Duo must have had enough evidence or even found out who the traitor was before he sent Fei Li here. In other words, there were indeed traitors among them.

“Who?” Mo Ke Tuo, who was sitting on Fei Li’s left, questioned with a neutral voice. She had wrapped herself in a black aura, and no one could see her true face.

She asked the question in everyone’s heart, and all of them turned to Fei Li together. As long as Fei Li spat out the name, that Demon King would be immediately lynched by the others.

“He knows himself very well.” Fei Li put on a mysterious look.

“Didn’t Senior Mo Duo give clear instructions?” One of the Demon Kings frowned and asked.

Fei Li got up and continued, “Senior Mo Duo naturally has a solution.”

While speaking, he stretched out his hand, and a visible vortex formed in front of him. The vortex looked deep and dark, and even the Demon Kings could not pry any information about what was inside of it.

“What is this?” Another Demon King questioned curiously, for it was his first time seeing such a strange sight.

Fei Li answered, “This is something Senior Mo Duo gave me. There is a Saint Artifact inside that can illuminate one’s true thoughts. Everyone will just need to stand in front of the Saint Artifact, and the traitors will be revealed.”

Everyone turned solemn and were awed by Senior Mo Duo’s means.

“Please enter!” Fei Li invited faintly.

The remaining fourteen Demon Kings hesitated, exchanging looks with each other, none of them willing to take the lead.

At this critical moment, Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tu snorted coldly and stepped into the vortex with her body wrapped in Demon Qi, vanishing from sight.

Fei Li pressed on, “Only those who are guilty would hesitate!”

The remaining Demon Kings immediately turned solemn at the impact of that remark. Furthermore, Mo Ke Tuo had taken the lead, so no one dared to hesitate anymore, all of them walking into the vortex one after another.

The Demon Kings disappeared one by one, and soon, all had entered the strange portal.

Fei Li followed behind them and stepped into the vortex too.

It was the same world as before, with no Sun, Moon, or Stars, but with a picturesque environment.

When they saw Fei Li enter, one of the Demon Kings immediately shouted, “Fei Li, where is the Saint Artifact that can reflect our hearts? Why don’t I see it?”

He desperately wanted to prove that he was not a traitor, so he got a little impatient and had absolutely no idea this was all a trap, a trap that was set up by their fellow Demon Kings.

Fei Li did not answer him and instead turned to Mo Ke Tuo and the other Demon Kings, “Sir instructed each of you to take one and prove yourselves.”

The Demon Kings who garrisoned in Fort Torrent were confused, but the rest of the Demon Kings like Mo Ke Tuo, Lai Wen, and the others turned solemn. They clearly understood the meaning behind Fei Li’s words.

The next moment, Mo Ke Tuo let out a peal of sinister laughter, turned into a black fog, and wrapped up a Demon King nearest to her. A shrill scream rang out immediately, and everyone’s face changed drastically.

Before they could react, Flame Demon Lai Wen, Strength Demon You La, Snow Demon Ah Shi Na, and the others made their move, each looking for a Demon King with a look of absolute hatred as they unleashed their lethal skills.

Except for Fei Li, the fourteen Demon Kings were divided into seven groups, with two people fighting each other in each group. Demon Qi permeated the battlefield, and various Innate Divine Abilities shone one after another.

The Demon Kings of Fort Torrent could not react to such an unexpected incident, but they still fought hard when facing this crisis.

However, none of them understood why it seemed like there was a power that suppressed and hindered them from unleashing their full potential.

Under such circumstances, how could they match Mo Ke Tuo and the rest who were as fierce as tigers?

The Demon Kings collapsed one by one, their Demon Hearts crushed, all of them dying tragic deaths.

Before the last Demon King was about to die, a sudden realization dawned on him and he gasped in shock, “Are you all the traitors?”

Lai Wen’s whole body was scorching in flame, as if he could burn all things in existence. He surrounded the Demon King with a raging fire and stated coldly, “It’s too late to know now.”

Under the burning flames, the Demon King only lasted for three breaths before he was burned to ashes, even his Demon Hearts melting under the intense heat.

After each of them killed a Demon King with their own hands, Mo Ke Tuo and the rest knew that they had reached the point of no return. Previously, although they were branded by Yang Kai’s Soul Imprint and were enslaved to him, they could still claim that their actions were all made under duress. Even if they were caught by Senior Mo Duo, they still had an excuse to explain themselves. If Senior Mo Duo was in a good mood, perhaps they could still be pardoned from punishment.

But now that they had killed their own companions, they could no longer return to the Demon Race. From now on, they could only move forward in this path until they met their end.
