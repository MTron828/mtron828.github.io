Xie Wu Wei wasn’t just saying this, as the Stone Spirit Clan was born innately understanding how to control Earth Principles. It was quite normal that they would be able to instantly move or level a mountain.

Yang Kai turned to look at the stone giant, “If he releases you, let bygones be bygones, how about it?”

The stone giant coldly snorted, “Anyone who dares to have designs on our Stone Spirit Clan is an enemy!” Yang Kai was rendered somewhat speechless at how unwilling to compromise the stone giant was.

“Young Master Yang, just look!” Xie Wu Wei pointed at the stone giant, meaning that it wasn’t him who was unwilling to let the stone giant go, but rather, that he couldn’t do anything because the stone giant wasn’t willing to compromise.

Yang Kai rubbed his head and looked at the stone giant rather helplessly as he said, “The Monster King is quite strong, so if you two really start fighting here, both sides will end up losing in the end. As the saying goes, grievances should be resolved rather than settled. Could you simply let this incident go? It’s not like you’ve lost anything. When it is possible to forgive others, one should be forgiving, you know?”

The stone giant snorted, seemingly quite unwilling to reconcile.

Xie Wu Wei also swung his sleeve in evident displeasure.

Yang Kai glanced at the stone giant and sincerely implored, “Didn’t you say that I’m your clan’s honoured guest? Would you please give me some face?”

The stone giant snorted for a bit before saying with an unhappy expression, “Forget it, let’s just leave things at this.”

This meant it was willing to make big things small and make small things nothing.

Yang Kai immediately gestured at Xie Wu Wei, “Okay then, release him!”

Although Xie Wu Wei was still rather unwilling, he couldn’t go against Yang Kai’s orders so he could only circulate his Monster Qi. The Monster Qi instantly filled the air and rumbled as it poured towards the pitch-black chain binding the stone giant, causing it to suddenly fall to the ground with a clatter.

Upon seeing the stone giant be freed from its restraints, Xie Wu Wei instantly flashed behind Yang Kai with a vigilant expression.

It wasn’t that he was afraid of the stone giant, but rather that it really was quite difficult to deal with. Even he was made to cough up blood when he took a blow from it, so Xie Wu Wei really didn’t want to have to fight against it unless he had to.

The stone giant simply gave Xie Wu Wei a sidelong glance with a vicious look in its eyes, but he did keep his word and didn’t do anything right after he was freed.

Yang Kai asked from the side, “Can you take me to see Xiao Xiao now?”

The stone giant nodded gently, making loud popping noises as it instantly shrunk from its fifteen-metre height to a size comparable to a Human’s, making it suddenly look rather flexible. The stone giant waved at Yang Kai and started walking outside with large steps, completely ignoring Xie Wu Wei, as if the latter didn’t even exist. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai hurriedly followed after the stone giant.

Xie Wu Wei had a displeased expression, hesitated for a moment, but eventually followed after them as well. The Monsters all came over with confused expressions, as they didn’t understand why their great Monster King was listening to a Human’s commands to release the stone giant that they had all worked so hard on capturing.

Of course, Xie Wu Wei couldn’t be bothered to explain anything to them, so he simply followed Yang Kai and the stone giant with a dark expression.

A stick of incense’s worth of time later, everyone had left the palace and returned to the surface.

The stone giant turned his head and looked around to determine his location before silently stomping the ground and leaping several thousand metres away, rushing into the dense primordial forest in the blink of an eye.

When Yang Kai saw this, he could only hurriedly say to Xie Wu Wei, “Monster King, please pay extra attention to the matter I previously requested of you. After you find that woman, it would be best if you could capture her safely, but if you can’t, have someone monitor her from afar instead until I return. You absolutely cannot harm her.”

Xie Wu Wei had a bitter expression, but he could only cup his fists and answer, “Young Master Yang, rest assured, this King shall definitely live up to your expectations; however, you must be careful on your trip.”

Although he really wanted Yang Kai to never return, if anything happened to Yang Kai right now, it would be difficult for him as well since he was Yang Kai’s Soul Slave, so he naturally didn’t want Yang Kai to meet with any danger.

Yang Kai didn’t have the time to say anything else to Xie Wu Wei, simply nodding and wrapping Zhang Ruo Xi in his Emperor Qi before moving the local Space Principles. Immediately after, the pair vanished from where they stood and chased after the stone giant.

The Monsters only walked over in unison after they watched Yang Kai leave, staring at Xie Wu Wei with confusion as they didn’t know what their great Monster King was doing.

Xie Wu Wei had a grim expression as he announced, “What happened today must not be exposed; otherwise, you will all be executed without mercy!”

The Monsters all felt afraid as they cupped their fists and answered that they understood.

It seemed that the stone giant was incapable of flight; however, its jumping ability was beyond imagination since every one of its jumps would cover several thousand metres, making it not slow at all.

The stone giant waited ahead for Yang Kai for a little while, and when he saw that Yang Kai was following quickly, he continued jumping forward without even looking back.

It was obvious that the stone giant was incredibly familiar with the Ancient Wild Lands as it kept making many turns that avoided the territories of powerful existences, so as not to cause trouble along the way.

However, it seemed that the stone giant was rather displeased with how Yang Kai had previously told it to not make any trouble for Xie Wu Wei, so the stone giant didn’t even try to talk with Yang Kai during the whole trip. This meant that Yang Kai didn’t even have a chance to ask about the Stone Spirit Clan or Xiao Xiao, only able to follow along in silence.

Ruo Xi could tell that Yang Kai had a lot on his mind, so she too remained silent and didn’t dare to disturb him.

This made the trip seem rather grim and silent.

The stone giant kept jumping through the Ancient Lands for an entire day and night before it suddenly stopped and its Human-sized stone body stepped on the top of a gigantic tree as it gazed into the distance and greeted the dawn.

*Shua…*

Yang Kai landed by the stone giant’s side and followed its gaze. He saw that deep within the forest was a dense patch of primaeval land where ancient trees reached up to the sky with many layers that were covered in mist. It all seemed like something out of an ancient story.

The stone giant made a fist and slammed it upon its own chest with a loud series of thumps. Zhang Ruo Xi felt afraid as she watched, fearing it would use too much strength and smash itself to death.

“Hou!” The stone giant roared to the sky, its voice containing a great deal of emotion that only rose in intensity with time. It seemed the stone giant was using a mysterious technique to send a message.

*Hualala…*

All the birds in the area were frightened and scattered.

Right after, another rhythmic roar sounded deep within the forest in response to the stone giant’s call.

Yang Kai felt his emotions rising because he suddenly sensed a mysterious Soul connection somewhere within the forest when he arrived here, one that was established via bloodlines. Even if tens of thousands of years passed, it would be impossible to eradicate this connection.

[Xiao Xiao!]

Yang Kai had used his own Blood Essence as a catalyst for Xiao Xiao’s birth. In other words, Xiao Xiao’s body contained Yang Kai’s blood. This was a connection that reached all the way down to the bones, and not a single person would possibly be able to break this connection.

“Elder has agreed to allow you entry into the clan’s territory. Come with me,” The nearby stone giant suddenly turned to speak before he jumped off the tree and sped through the forest with the agility of a monkey.

Yang Kai suppressed the excitement in his heart as he followed after the stone giant.

A grey figure half the height of a Human flew through the forest and rapidly approached Yang Kai.

The distance between the grey figure and Yang Kai shortened rapidly. Even though tens of thousands of trees were between them, both were able to clearly sense each other’s existence.

*Xiu…*

Yang Kai paused in his movements as he instantly stopped where he was.

Right after that, a grey bolt of light came pouncing with the speed of lightning towards him from the front. Ruo Xi was astonished as she thought Yang Kai had met with an ambush, so she instantly summoned the Ten Thousand Beasts Seal; however, she soon found out that she had misunderstood.

That was because Yang Kai was actually smiling while reaching out towards the grey light with his hands.

The beam of light didn’t decrease in speed at all as it crashed right onto Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai’s eyes bulged as he was hit by an enormous force that caused him to uncontrollably fly backwards. Many trees in his way were crushed like dry weeds and rotten wood before he finally came to a halt.

“Cough cough…” Yang Kai almost received internal injuries as he couldn’t catch his breath.

Xiao Xiao’s tackle embrace had been rather violent.

Yang Kai reached out with his hand as he leaned his back against a tree that had been half knocked over, patting Xiao Xiao who was on top of his body while constantly rubbing his head against Yang Kai.

“Wuwu…” Xiao Xiao made some mysterious cries, and although Yang Kai couldn’t understand literally, he could still clearly sense the latter’s happiness and excitement.

Xiao Xiao couldn’t control himself because of the excitement from their reunion after such a long parting. That was why Xiao Xiao had charged so wildly at Yang Kai right when he sensed him.

Xiao Xiao soon seemed to realize that he had done something wrong as he hurriedly got up and half kneeled in front of Yang Kai, his eyes sweeping up and down as he nervously looked Yang Kai over, fearing that Yang Kai had been hurt, he even reached out to pat away the dust on Yang Kai’s clothes.

However, Xiao Xiao’s strength was still rather strong.

“I’m fine, I’m fine!” Yang Kai was all smiles as he patted Xiao Xiao’s head and seriously looked him over. It didn’t seem like Xiao Xiao had changed very much after parting for many years, but Yang Kai could clearly sense his aura had become much stronger.

Meanwhile, the stone giant who led Yang Kai here was rather stunned at the sight. Xiao Xiao’s tackle from earlier was just a light hug to the Stone Spirit Clan, but such a hug wasn’t something that most Humans, who naturally had much weaker and smaller bodies, could handle.

Yet, this Human was completely unharmed and was even smiling happily. This Human’s body… was rather sturdy…

“Wuwu…” Xiao Xiao kept whimpering. If the Stone Spirit was capable of crying, its face would likely be covered in tears already. Xiao Xiao was unable to vent all the excitement in his chest, so he could only jump up and down and scratch at his head, as if he was a comical and naughty monkey.

Suddenly, Xiao Xiao darted to the side, opened his arms, and hugged a large tree. That tree had been alive for an unknown number of years, but it would require at least three people to encircle it. The tree’s crown reached high up into the clouds, so Xiao Xiao, who was only half a Human’s height, seemed to be as insignificant as an ant in comparison to it.

Yet, Xiao Xiao’s embrace caused the entire tree to suddenly begin shaking violently.

“Hou!” Xiao Xiao roared furiously, causing the land to vibrate as spiderweb-like cracks appeared on the ground as the tree roots became exposed.

*Hong hong hong…*

Xiao Xiao kept raising and lowering his arms, and every time that he moved, the tree kept shaking, after a few times actually being uprooted, causing dust and dirt to fly everywhere.

Ruo Xi was stunned at the sight.

She now finally witnessed what it truly meant to have unlimited strength.

Xiao Xiao pulled up the large tree by the roots. The tree seemed like it was as light as air as he tossed it into the sky. The tree instantly became a small black dot in the distance and it was unknown where it eventually landed.

“Hou…” Xiao Xiao kept roaring endlessly at the sky while pounding his chest with his fists, making a sound like a war drum.
