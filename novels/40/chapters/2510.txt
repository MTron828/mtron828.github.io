Mo Xiao Qi shrugged in shyness and embarrassment, “Big Brother Yang, Xiao Qi didn’t intend to hide it from you on purpose. It’s just that my Father…”

Yang Kai held up his hand to stop her, “You don’t need to explain, I understand.”

Mo Xiao Qi was obviously afraid that her Father’s name would scare off people, so she had never mentioned her identity to Yang Kai; however, she felt a little uneasy now that her identity was exposed.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, “Despite the reputation of Sir Martial Beast, you are still the playful Mo Xiao Qi I know, not the daughter of the Martial Beast Great Emperor.”

Mo Xiao Qi thought about his words for a while, then her eyes curved into a beautiful crescent shape as she smiled in relief.

Suddenly, Yang Kai turned solemn and looked up into the air.

“Sir!” Zhang Ruo Xi whispered at the same time.

While speaking, she pushed her Source Qi anxiously, looking at the sky warily.

[Ruo Xi could sense it too?] Yang Kai glanced at her in surprise and found that her enchanting eyes revealed a dreadfully cold aura, which was completely different from her usual gentleness.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked and felt increasingly dubious about Zhang Ruo Xi’s bloodline.

A layer of ripples disrupted the peaceful sky, like a stone dropping into the surface of a tranquil lake. The ripple spread out rapidly and became more and more evident.

Soon, the space of a certain part of the sky became distorted, and a clear and mysterious wave of power was transmitted from there.

“Space Principles!” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, feeling amazed in his heart.

He did not expect to encounter such a powerful Space Principle fluctuation in such a place. It was obvious that someone was tearing space to appear here from a very remote place. Judging from the Space Principle fluctuations, whoever was coming likely had even higher attainments in the Dao of Space than he did.

Yang Kai’s expression was extremely solemn. Although he did not know who this visitor was, he believed that the strength of a person who could travel by tearing the space like this was absolutely not normal.

Who was it? What was their purpose in appearing here?

Yang Kai did not dare to take this lightly and quickly put his Embodiment away while silently circulating his Emperor Qi to be on guard.

If he was alone, he could immediately hide and observe from the dark; however, he could not do that because Zhang Ruo Xi and Mo Xiao Qi were beside him, as well as Liu Yan who was still in her Phoenix Egg form.

“Ah!” Mo Xiao Qi suddenly screamed and her face turned pale at the peculiarity in the sky, quickly hiding behind Yang Kai as her tender body trembled like a mouse at the sight of a cat. “Big Brother Yang, let’s run now. It will be too late if we don’t.” She whispered.

“It’s already too late to run,” Yang Kai replied with a helpless face.

*Hua…*

The sky was torn apart, as if a formless beast opened its mouth preparing to swallow its prey.

Yang Kai paid close attention to this disturbance and saw a foot suddenly stepping out of the dark crack. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

*Dong… *

Yang Kai’s face paled. Although that foot was stepping on the void, he felt like it was stepping on his own heart, extinguishing his aura and presence.

[So strong!] Yang Kai’s eyes were overflowing with terror. He already knew that this visitor was not weak, but at this moment, Yang Kai realized that he had still underestimated the strength of the one who appeared.

Whoever it was, they were definitely a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, and certainly not an ordinary one at that!

Following the foot, a figure emerged from the crack leisurely with a calm and relaxed face, as if he was simply going for a stroll outside his house.

Then, Yang Kai saw the face of the newcomer.

It was a middle-aged man who dressed like a scholar. He had an extraordinary bearing with a completely harmless smile on his face.

His eyes slightly swept across them and landed on Yang Kai before he gave a strange smile.

*Gudong… *

Yang Kai could not help gulping, even though he knew that he should not show any signs of fear. Nevertheless, he felt like a lamb being targeted by a hungry wolf, and his whole body shivered involuntarily.

After the emergence of the middle-aged scholar, another figure stepped out of the Void.

Unlike the leisurely movements of the scholar, the second person appeared in an aggressive manner like a burning flame, raising the surrounding temperature in an instant.

The second visitor was a stunning woman with a graceful body; she had voluptuous peaks, a slender waist, red lips as bright as jewels with a strange brilliance, delicate skin as white as porcelain, and glistening beautiful eyes… Men would not be able to resist fantasizing while looking at her, especially with her long flaming-red hair which flew out behind her, giving a strong visual impact that was impossible to peel one’s eyes away from.

“Damn it! How could it be her!?” Yang Kai almost bit his own tongue, secretly cursing in his heart.

Because he actually knew this beautiful woman.

She was the Aunty Feng Mo Xiao Qi often mentioned!

Spirit Beast Island’s Jiu Feng! Even though she was not one of the Ten Great Emperors, the name of Jiu Feng still resounded loudly throughout the entire Star Boundary, and no cultivator who had even the slightest bit of strength did not know of her.

If this beautiful woman was Jiu Feng, the identity of the middle-aged scholar was just as clear as day.

Li Wu Yi!

Yang Kai’s eyes immediately flashed as he stared straight back into Li Wu Yi’s eyes without avoidance. Although this was the first time he met Li Wu Yi, Yang Kai had heard his name many times, because Li Wu Yi was the Master with the highest proficiency in the Dao of Space in the entire Star Boundary, a peak Third-Order Emperor Realm powerhouse.

Mo Xiao Qi mentioned before that she would introduce Yang Kai to Li Wu Yi, so he could become his Disciple and learn the mysteries of the Dao of Space.

After realizing that these two people were Masters from Spirit Beast Island, Yang Kai instantly understood why they were here.

They had obviously come for Mo Xiao Qi.

[But how did the two of them know that Mo Xiao Qi was here? What’s more, they just directly tore space and came here.]

Yang Kai pondered for a while, but soon figured that they must have done something to Mo Xiao Qi, so they could always track her location. This also explained how Jiu Feng and Li Wu Yi could appear shortly after they left the Shattered Star Sea.

No wonder Mo Xiao Qi hid behind him and urged him to escape when she saw the vision in the sky. She already knew that someone was coming for her.

“Li Wu Yi, you bastard! How dare you leave me behind in the Void! Do you know I was almost devoured by the Void Turbulence?” Jiu Feng grabbed Li Wu Yi’s collar as soon as she showed up, lifting him and shaking him violently as she reprimanded.

Li Wu Yi, the strongest Master below the Great Emperors, was lifted by Jiu Feng like a weak chicken and dared not resist.

He broke out in cold sweat with an embarrassed look, “What are you doing? Juniors are watching down there. What about my face!”

“Face?” Jiu Feng glared at him with her upturned eyes, screeching, “Face should be earned, not given by others. If you want face, be good to me then, understand?”

“Understood, understood, understood!” Li Wu Yi nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice, pleading, “Can you be gentle and put me down now?”

“Gentle?” Jiu Feng sneered and shouted angrily, “What is that? Can you eat it?”

Li Wu Yi put on a long face and looked in Yang Kai’s direction pitifully, “Xiao Qi, save me!”

“You can’t see me, you can’t see me, you can’t see me…” Mo Xiao Qi hid closely behind Yang Kai, mumbling constantly to herself.

“If you dare to leave me in the Void again, you better watch out! I’ll make sure your ‘third leg’ is broken beyond repair!” Jiu Feng gritted her teeth, looking vicious.

Li Wu Yi could not help tightening up his thighs together and begged hurriedly, “I won’t, I won’t! Please forgive me, Great-Aunt!”

“Hmph!” Jiu Feng hurled Li Wu Yi aside like a sack of garbage. After that, her face and tone of voice changed drastically, twisting her body in shyness, she said, “Seriously. Don’t you know that others are afraid when surrounded by pure darkness?”

After speaking, she swept her eyes across the place below elegantly and stopped at the sight of Yang Kai, greeting with bright enthusiasm, “Hey, Little Brother, we meet again. It must be fate.”

Yang Kai gulped in difficulty, his expression stiff. Ever since he first heard of them, Yang Kai had always had a high opinion and good impression of the two peak Emperor Realm Masters, Aunt Feng and Li Wu Yi, but now that lofty ideal was crumbling quickly before his eyes.

Pushing down his discomfort, Yang Kai cupped his fists solemnly, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior Li and Senior Jiu Feng!”

Li Wu Wi smiled faintly, a subtle cold light flashing across his eyes, “What did you see just now?”

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “The surge of Space Principles just now distorted the sky. Junior tried his best to see through the chaos, but unfortunately, my strength was insufficient and I could not see anything. What a shame!”

After hearing this, Li Wu Yi raised his brows and the cold light in his eyes dissipated. He nodded, “A young man worthy of praise! This King often hears about you from Xiao Qi on the island. I heard that you are also proficient in the Dao of Space?”

Yang Kai responded immediately, “Senior is flattering me. This Junior only knows a bit about the Dao of Space and definitely doesn’t dare to show off meagre skills before an expert like Senior Li. If there is any opportunity, this Junior would like to ask Senior for his guidance.”

Li Wu Yi beamed delightfully, “Good, very good. If you ever come to Spirit Beast Island in the future, this King will teach you a unique Divine Ability.”

Yang Kai was overjoyed, he immediately pressed on, “There is no need to choose another day, why not today?”

The smile was still hanging on Li Wu Yi’s face as he answered lightly, “Boy, aren’t you being too shameless? Do you think you can just simply learn the secrets of this King so easily?”

Yang Kai was exasperated, “Senior is so stingy, you don’t have the intention of teaching this Junior at all. Are you here to just make me unhappy?”

“Whether you are happy or not is none of my business,” Li Wu Yi burst into laughter, “As long as this King is happy, that’s all that matters.”
