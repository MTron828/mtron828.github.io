Liu Xian Yun arrived a few moments later.

She and Yang Kai arrived at the Star Boundary together. Although they were from different Star Fields, the Senior Brother and Junior Sister had supported each other in the Blue Feather Sect for a brief period of time. They also went through difficult times together in the Solitary Void Sealed World, forming a firm relationship.

After leaving the Solitary Void Sealed World, Liu Xian Yun stayed in Ice Heart Valley, which was excellent for her.

She did not come to see Yang Kai for any specific matter, it was just that she did not see him for a few years and missed him.

After a long chat, Yang Kai learned that life was great for her and that she had officially become Bing Yun’s Disciple.

She was absolutely qualified for such an honour; after all, she was like Yang Kai, a cultivator who ascended from a lower Star Field. Back then, in the Grand Desolation Star Field, her aptitude was no worse than Yin Le Sheng’s; however, due to her inferior background and heritage, she was forced into a subordinate position.

If Yin Le Sheng could join the Netherworld Sect and become a Legacy Disciple of its Sect Master, Liu Xian Yun could naturally achieve a similar height.

Over all these years, her impeded progress in cultivation was due to her tough life and insufficiency of resources.

Now that she had become a disciple of Bing Yun, with abundant cultivation resources and excellent teachers, her potential had begun to blossom. In just a few years, she had broken through to the Second-Order Dao Source Realm and was well on her way to becoming a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master. Although her cultivation as a Martial Aunt was inferior to many of her Martial Nephews and Nieces, her future was bright.

She got along well with her Martial Sisters in Ice Heart Valley, and she made this place her home.

Knowing this, Yang Kai was relieved.

Later on, Liu Xian Yun asked about Yang Kai’s life over the past few years.

There was nothing much for him to say. He spent most of the past few years in the Shattered Star Sea, and after leaving it, he rushed to the Eastern Territory’s Ancient Wild Lands without stopping to find Xiao Xiao, meeting the Four Great Divine Venerables in the process.

Yang Kai picked a few of the tamer stories to tell, hiding the dangerous points, but Liu Xian Yun still listened with great enthusiasm as he described his amazing adventures. She felt that Yang Kai’s life was always so wonderful and thrilling.

“Right, Junior Sister, I have a gift for you,” Yang Kai abruptly seemed to remember something. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“What is it?” Liu Xian Yun asked curiously.

Yang Kai grinned, “Just relax and don’t resist.”

After hearing this, Liu Xian Yun gently nodded and took a deep breath, lowering her guard completely as she even closed her eyes.

She was completely defenceless against Yang Kai at this moment. In other words, if Yang Kai intended to harm her, she could be instantly killed.

If she did not have absolute trust in Yang Kai, she would not act like this.

After searching in the Small Sealed World for a while, Yang Kai flipped his hand and a cluster of dim light appeared on his palm. The light actually released a familiar Source aura with its emergence. Looking closely, the cluster of light seemed to be filled with stars in it, like a starry night shrunk down countless times.

In a moment of suspicion, Liu Xian Yun quickly opened her eyes.

She was stunned at the object on Yang Kai’s hand, and questioned curiously, “Senior Brother Yang, what is that?”

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “A Star Source!”

“Star Source?” Liu Xian Yun’s tender body trembled in astonishment.

She naturally knew what a Star Source was since she was from the Grand Desolation Star Field. A Star Source was the core, foundation, and life of a Cultivation Star. Such a vibrant Star Source could only be born by a Cultivation Star after millions of years, and without one, a Star would degrade into a Dead Star.

One could only become a Star Master by refining the Star Source of a Cultivation Star in a Star Field.

But it was not easy to become a Star Master. Even a Third-Order Origin King could not guarantee their safety when attempting the refinement process. Among the countless Star Fields, there was an enormous number of Origin Kings who had died trying to refine a Star Source.

Back then, there were only a few Star Masters in the entire Grand Desolation Star Field, with Yin Le Sheng being one of them.

Liu Xian Yun had thought of becoming a Star Master by refining the Source Strength of a Star in the Grand Desolation Star Field before, but unfortunately, the Netherworld Sect was in control of everything in the Grand Desolation Star Field, so she did not have a chance to refine one.

Only after reaching the Star Boundary did she realize how rare and important Star Sources were, and that it was almost impossible for ordinary people to catch a glimpse of one.

She thought that it would be impossible for her to come across a Star Source in her lifetime; but contrary to her expectations, there was one in front of her now.

“Is… Is this from the Shattered Star Sea?” Liu Xian Yun asked in a trembling voice.

“En!” Yang Kai nodded.

He had gained a lot of benefits from the Shattered Star Sea, including comprehending the Time Flies Seal, obtaining the Phoenix True Fire and the Mountains and Rivers Bell, and witnessing the battle between the two Great Emperors, Bustling World and Heaven Devouring… A number of Star Sources were also among his gains.

“No, no, no, this is far too precious, I cannot accept it!” Liu Xian Yun rapidly rejected with her head shaking and her hands waving.

Yang Kai beamed, “Why not? It’s just a Star Source. You and I have known each other for so many years already, and now that your Senior Brother is quite successful in cultivation, he can afford to give you some small gifts. Why reject me?”

Although her desire was piqued, Liu Xian Yun still firmly shook her head, “Senior Brother Yang, if you give me other gifts, Junior Sister wouldn’t reject you, but a Star Source… Is something I cannot accept. You should refine it yourself. Once you successfully refine it, your efficiency in cultivation would definitely increase tremendously. It’s said that those cultivators who have refined Star Sources have a great affinity with World Principles!”

“Of course I know about that, but I am already a Star Master, remember?” Yang Kai chuckled softly.

His identity as a Star Master was revealed to Liu Xian Yun during their first encounter in the Starlight Corridor. He had a complete Star Source in his body since long ago and that was one of the reasons his cultivation speed had been so fast through these years.

“I know Senior Brother has one, but you can refine a second one still. Although the effect would not be as good as the first, it would still certainly help you,” Liu Xian Yun insisted.

Yang Kai shook his head, “Since I already planned to give it to you, I won’t take it back. Moreover, I have plenty of Star Sources!”

“Plenty…” Liu Xian Yun was dumbstruck, barely believing her ears.

She knew that Yang Kai had gone to the Shattered Star Sea and had even heard Zi Yu mention that at the Source Sea in the Shattered Star Sea, many Masters obtained complete Star Sources. At most though, one could obtain three or four complete Star Sources. Therefore, she thought Yang Kai was trying to comfort her by telling her that he had plenty of Star Sources.

Little did she know that in fact, Yang Kai did not just have three to four Star Source, but as many as thirty or forty.

The other complete Star Sources were all stored in the Sealed World Bead. Yang Kai had his own plans in using these complete Star Sources, but it did not hurt him to give one to Liu Xian Yun.

“Here!” While speaking, Yang Kai directly pushed the Star Source in his hand towards Liu Xian Yun, using his Star Refining Art to begin fusing it with her before she could react.

Liu Xian Yun moaned as she felt a little uncomfortable.

It was not easy to refine a Star Source. For those cultivators who snatched the Star Sources in the Shattered Star Sea, they temporarily sealed them in their own bodies and suppressed them with their cultivation, planning to slowly refine them once they returned to their Sects. As for whether they could succeed, that was up to chance.

During the process, they might suffer backlash from the rich Source Strength, possibly resulting in their death. It was not uncommon for their bodies to explode from the immense Source Strength they were trying to refine or from the swirling World Principles it would attract.

“I’m going to teach you a Secret Technique now, so listen carefully. With the aid of this Secret Technique, you can refine this Source easily and will not experience any danger,” Yang Kai remarked seriously.

Liu Xian Yun knew that at this point, she could not reject it anymore, so she immediately sat down and listened to him intently.

Yang Kai passed the Star Refining Art to Liu Xian Yun next while also instructing her to keep its existence a secret. Naturally, Liu Xian Yun complied.

It took more than half a day for Liu Xian Yun to memorize the Star Refining Art before she got up and declared, “Senior Brother Yang, I’ll go back to refine this Star Source now. If you need anything, just ask the disciples standing by outside.”

“I know, good luck,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

After sending Liu Xian Yun off, Yang Kai went back to his room and sat down cross-legged while taking out some Source Crystals to cultivate.

On the third day, he suddenly opened his eyes and called out, “Enter.”

Soon, the sound of light footsteps was heard, and the door was pushed open. A beautiful looking female disciple greeted, “Martial Uncle Yang, what can I do for you?”

Yang Kai answered, “I want to see Senior Bing Yun.”

“Please follow me, Martial Uncle Yang.” The disciple immediately led the way.

Yang Kai was not just a guest in Ice Heart Valley, but rather their closest friend. A general order had been given that no matter what Yang Kai required, the disciples had to fulfil his needs.

He did not even need to formally request an audience in order to see Bing Yun.

Soon, under the guidance of the female disciple, Yang Kai came to the front of a grand palace.

Just as he arrived, Bing Yun’s voice echoed from the inner hall, “Is it Yang Kai? Come in.”

Obviously, she had sensed his presence.

The female disciple gestured to Yang Kai to enter. After nodding, Yang Kai stepped inside.

This palace should be the place where Bing Yun cultivated in seclusion. The decorations inside were not luxurious, but they were clean and pure.

As Yang Kai walked in, Bing Yun also entered from her inner room, followed closely by Ji Yao.

When he met eyes with Ji Yao, Yang Kai could not help feeling guilty, forcing himself to smile but only receiving an emotionless stare from her, one that hid all her thoughts and feelings.

“Greetings, Senior,” Yang Kai cupped his fist as he saluted Bing Yun.

Bing Yun smiled lightly, “Have a seat.” She then turned to Ji Yao, “Yao’er, tea.”

“Yes!” Ji Yao swiftly prepared the tea.

Yang Kai sat down with an uncomfortable expression.

He did not expect Ji Yao to be here, but on second thought, both Master and Disciple had finally reunited after not seeing each other for thousands of years, so it was natural that Ji Yao would stay close to Bing Yun and fulfil her filial duties.

With a quick effort, two steaming cups of tea were ready. Ji Yao served Bing Yun the first cup of tea, then put down another cup beside Yang Kai, “Senior Brother Yang, have some tea.”

“Many thanks!” Yang Kai nodded in appreciation.

He really did not understand what was going on in Ji Yao’s mind and wondered if she would retaliate against him in the future. However, he could not sense anything from her expressionless face while her treatment towards him was akin to how one would treat a total stranger, with no enthusiasm, quite unlike in the past.
