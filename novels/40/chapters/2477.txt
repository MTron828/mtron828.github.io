“Big Cousin, don’t leave. Since you’re already here, why do you have to leave in such a hurry?” Yang Kai suddenly shouted at Wu Meng Chuan enthusiastically.

Wu Meng Chuan staggered at his words and almost fell from the air.

He hurriedly wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and reprimanded, “Who is your Big Cousin!?”

Yang Kai responded solemnly, “Big Cousin, you’re so bad. You pretended to not recognize your Little Cousin here. I’ll tell your mother, be careful when she beats you.”

Wu Meng Chuan was annoyed, “Little brat, stop all your gibberish!”

“He is your Big Cousin?” The brawny young man looked at Yang Kai with a weird look, and continued, “But he doesn’t look like it.”

Yang Kai responded, “He is like this!” While speaking, he looked up to Wu Meng Chuan, “Big Cousin, there are people here who are going to bully your Little Cousin, shouldn’t you stand up for me?”

Wu Meng Chuan’s face darkened, “Little brat, if you dare to speak nonsense again, don’t blame me for treating you impolitely!”

Yang Kai was immediately infuriated, “Everyone wants to treat me poorly, is this Young Master so much fun to bully? Do you believe that I will come up and beat you up until your mother doesn’t recognize you!?”

Wu Meng Chuan was steaming with anger at Yang Kai’s incessant mention of his mother. However, there were five Emperor Realm Masters here, so he dared not to act recklessly, only sneering, “If you have guts, come over here. Let’s see who will be the one getting beaten!”

“Just you wait!” Yang Kai immediately flew up after he spoke, throwing a series of punches towards Wu Meng Chuan air.

“Little brat, how dare you!” Wu Meng Chuan was maddened. Even though he feared the five Emperor Realm Masters here, it did not mean that he was afraid of Yang Kai. Seeing Yang Kai come up with his unceremonious punches, Wu Meng Chuan did not hesitate to fight back.

He was not sure about the relationship between Yang Kai and the other five, so he dared not to land a fatal blow, only using half of his strength in attacking.

In an instant, the sky was full of rumbling sounds as the pair exchanged punches and kicks furiously. Although the scene looked extraordinarily boisterous, in fact, no one was using any real strength.

In the meantime, Yang Kai gave Wu Meng Chuan a secret signal with a wink.

Although Wu Meng Chuan did not fully understand what Yang Kai meant, for a person who had lived for so long, he was smart enough to understand the meaning. At this point, he seemed to be fighting fiercely with Yang Kai, but actually, he was cooperating with Yang Kai, quickly shifting their battlefield out of this dangerous place.

In no time, the two of them were out of the five Emperor Realm Masters’ sight, and after a while, even their Divine Senses could not find them anymore.

“Hmph!” Yao Si snorted coldly, turned around, and flew back to his original location with an indifferent look.

Although Yang Kai irritated him earlier, the situation was inconvenient for him to intervene, so Yao Si just ignored him.

Chi Gui looked at the direction in which Yang Kai disappeared, and faintly smiled, “That little brat found himself a good excuse.”

The brawny young man nodded, “I’m afraid that person is his helper and they put on this play together in order to get him out of this place.”

Wu Chang remained silent, but he felt the same way too. Regardless of Yang Kai’s unyielding attitude just now, as if he did not put anyone in his eyes, he was still a Dao Source Realm cultivator. There was definitely no way for him to stay alive if Yao Si targeted him.

The situation now favoured Yang Kai, fleeing while fighting with his so-called ‘Big Cousin’, even Yao Si with an extraordinary identity could do nothing about him.

Yang Kai was just… so scheming, the others could not help but look down on him.

Soon, the five Emperor Realm Masters dispersed back to their places and they felt strange that they did not experience a drastic reduction in Source Strength anymore in the next few days.

This convinced them even more that Yang Kai was the culprit behind the previous anomaly.

……

Two people stood on a shattered Star in the sky a few tens of thousands of kilometres away from the Source Sea, staring at one another.

One of them had a burly and sturdy figure, eyes scorching like a hungry wolf that had found its prey.

The other stood stoically, his clothes flapping in the wind, eyes shining bright like stars.

They were Wu Meng Chuan and Yang Kai. They retreated all the way from the Source Sea without having to exchange a word of explanation and arrived together on this uninhabited Star.

“I did not expect you to cultivate until the Third-Order Dao Source Realm in such a short time!” Wu Meng Chuan looked at Yang Kai in surprise, with a little excitement, “The Secret Art that this King passed on to you is not bad right?”

He thought that the reason Yang Kai was able to possess this kind of cultivation in such a short time was due to the contribution of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, as it was a Heaven-defying Secret Art. As long as he could withstand the backlash of this Secret Art, strengthening his cultivation would be an extremely easy task. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“It’s all because this Young Master is talented and intelligent. It has nothing to do with your half-assed Secret Art,” Yang Kai curled his lip.

Wu Meng Chuan chuckled, “Is this how you talk to this King who was your Sect Master and saved your life before?

Yang Kai replied with a darkened face, “If I’m not mistaken, it was this Young Master who saved you first.”

Wu Meng Chuan questioned again, “Even if it was, this King still passed on a Secret Art to you, do you want to deny it?”

Yang Kai rebuked after hearing it, “You want to bring that up? I do have a few questions about your damned Secret Art.”

“What?” Wu Meng Chuan raised his brows.

“The Secret Art that you passed on to me, is it incomplete?”

Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes lit up instantly, and he bellowed with a shortness of breath, “You really cultivated the Secret Art!?”

He looked like a pervert who saw a naked woman, his eyes gleaming, causing Yang Kai to get goosebumps all over his body.

Yang Kai reprimanded impatiently, “It’s none of your business whether or not I cultivated it.”

Wu Meng Chuan faintly smiled, “If you didn’t cultivate it, how could you find out this problem?”

Yang Kai was exasperated, “So, that Secret Art is indeed incomplete. You are so wicked. This Young Master risked grave danger to release you from the Bone Prison and return your freedom. It’s fine that you don’t feel grateful about it, but how can you teach me this incomplete Secret Art? Where is your conscience? Where is the justice? Damn it, this Young Master could only blame himself for believing a scoundrel like you!”

He cursed bitterly, beating his own chest and stomping his feet, showing a remorseful face.

Wu Meng Chuan’s face was filled with a cheerful smile, however, as he waited for Yang Kai to finish throwing his fit before saying, “The Secret Art this King passed on to you is actually a complete Secret Art!”

“Bullshit!” Yang Kai spat at Wu Meng Chuan when he continued to deny.

Wu Meng Chuan dodged this easily and advised him calmly, “Little brat, don’t be so rude. Didn’t your father teach you to respect the old and love the young?”

“Sorry, I was born like this!” Yang Kai revealed a stubborn look on his face.

Wu Meng Chuan snorted, “This King doesn’t want to argue with you. About the Secret Art, do you want this King to explain it to you?”

“Speak!” Yang Kai looked at him coldly.

Wu Meng Chuan did not mind his bad attitude and explained indifferently, “Back then, Ancestor created an extraordinary Secret Art, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, and used it to reach the Great Emperor Realm. He alone dominated the world, and no one was his equal! Unfortunately, destruction pursues the great. The other Great Emperors feared and envied him, and joined forces to kill him. The Heavens must have been jealous of such a talented person and turned a blind eye to his plight!”

Yang Kai sneered, “How come the version I heard was different from what you said.”

Wu Meng Chuan glared at him, “Do you still want to listen or not? If not, this King won’t talk about it.”

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders and made a gesture of zipping his mouth, motioning him to keep going.

Wu Meng Chuan snorted in annoyance and continued, “When Ancestor created the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, he already noticed a huge flaw in it. Can you guess what it is?”

Yang Kai pointed to his mouth and only made a few muffled sounds but didn’t speak.

Wu Meng Chuan felt helpless and answered himself, “Although this Secret Art is Heaven-defying, it slowly corrupts one’s mind, body, and Soul, resulting in an extremely strong backlash. Only a person with great perseverance can cultivate this Secret Art and withstand the backlash, otherwise, it would not take long for there to be dissonance in his cultivation and for death to find them.”

Yang Kai had a sudden realization when he heard it and understood that Wu Meng Chuan’s words were true.

Because the Embodiment once mentioned this, but also due to the Embodiment’s Stone Puppet body, he was born able to refine and expel various impurities, so the downsides of the Heaven Devouring Battle Law did not have any impact on him.

“Besides, when the Secret Art is cultivated to a certain limit, there will be a bottleneck. Without breaking through this bottleneck, you will never be able to advance further!” Wu Meng Chuan’s face turned solemn at this point, looking at Yang Kai intently, “And this bottleneck is the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, which is why you and I cannot break through to the Emperor Realm!”

Yang Kai knew that it was not the Heaven Devouring Battle Law that hindered his breakthrough, but he was still interested in listening because he felt that Wu Meng Chuan was going to tell him the solution to this problem next.

This guy seemed to feel that he had gotten Yang Kai in his hand, so now he was a little chatty and revealed everything to him.

Indeed, Wu Meng Chuan carried on, “In order to solve this problem, Ancestor came up with an ingenious solution involving another person cultivating the Heaven Devouring Battle Law. When this person cultivated to the bottleneck of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, one just needed to devour him and use the combined essence to break through the bottleneck in one swoop, arriving at the Emperor Realm!” His tone gradually became excited, his face turning ruddy as he exclaimed, “Ancestor is truly an unparalleled genius, I could never be as good as him!”

Yang Kai responded with a shocked look, “So… the ultimate goal of you passing on the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to me was to devour me?”

Wu Meng Chuan grinned and snarled with his white fangs, “Of course, why else do you think this King, as the descendant of the strongest Great Emperor, would easily give out his Secret Art?”

“Despicable! Shameless!” Yang Kai rebuked.

Wu Meng Chuan snorted coldly, “You are not the only person who has obtained this Secret Art from this King. Over the past few hundred years, this King discovered over a hundred gifted cultivators and passed them the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, but the only one who cultivated until the Third-Order Dao Source Realm is you! As for the others… they all died.”

He paused for a while, then continued, “The Secret Art that this King passed on to you is not incomplete, but it is a copy.”

“A copy?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Yes, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law that was created by Ancestor is divided into two types, original and copy. This King cultivated the original Secret Art, while the one that passed on to you is just a copy!”
