Chapter 5104, Implicated

Yang Kai’s trip of turning into a Grand Dragon and making a fuss in Hei Yuan’s territory was rewarding. Not only had he killed a lot of Black Ink Clansmen, but he had also destroyed Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest and snatched a massive amount of cultivation resources. The price he paid was worth it.

When Yang Kai pretended to be a Black Ink Disciple back then, he already realised that the city where Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest was located was flourishing. There were ample supplies, which included all sorts of materials of different Orders. The Black Ink Clan couldn’t directly use these resources, so they were basically thrown into the Black Ink Nests to help produce Black Ink Strength. Nevertheless, these were precious cultivation resources for the Humans.

Since Yang Kai decided to make a move, he certainly had to take those resources away.

Furthermore, there was one discovery that surprised him.

He realised that his Grand Dragon form had lengthened.

When he was in the Divine Spirits’ Ancestral Land in the Shattered Heaven back then, he made use of the Dragon Palace and Ancestral Strength to become a Grand Dragon. At that time, his Grand Dragon Form was 10,000 metres long.

Then, with the help of Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan in the Chaotic Dead Territory, his Dragon Vein was significantly enhanced, which allowed him to turn into a 20,000-metre Grand Dragon.

At that time, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan respectively left a mysterious power in his body that could stimulate the power of his Dragon Vein. Even after Yang Kai reached 20,000 metres in his Grand Dragon Form, he had a feeling that the mysterious power hadn’t been used up and most of it still remained hidden in his Dragon Bead.

Then, he got into a fight with Zhu Feng. At the critical moment, he spat out his Dragon Bead and dealt a lethal blow to Zhu Feng, which caused his Dragon Bead to be damaged.

Over the years, the damaged Dragon Bead had slowly healed with the nourishing of his Dragon Vein. Now, it seemed his Dragon Vein had also been strengthened. When he transformed into a Grand Dragon in Hei Yuan’s territory, he was nearly 30,000 metres long.

Apparently, the damage to his Dragon Bead had stimulated the mysterious power left behind in his body by Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan. During this period of time, not only had his Dragon Bead gradually healed, but his Dragon Vein had also been strengthened.

This came as a pleasant surprise.

The strength of a Grand Dragon was manifested in their length.

Usually, only a 10,000 metre Dragon could be regarded as a Grand Dragon, which was equivalent to a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Now that Yang Kai’s Dragon Form was 30,000 metres long, his power was equivalent to that of a peak Seventh-Order Master.

However, there were pros and cons to fighting as a Grand Dragon. Since his Grand Dragon form was so massive, he could cause serious damage over a wide area, especially when doing things like destroying Hei Yuan’s territory and the Black Ink Nest some time ago. There was no doubt that it was easier for him to achieve his goal by turning into a Grand Dragon. Nevertheless, his large size also meant that he wasn’t as agile or manoeuvrable. He might suffer a setback if he faced certain opponents in such a state.

Fortunately, there were no powerful beings in Hei Yuan’s territory at that time. Although the Feudal Lords had gone all out, they couldn’t really kill him, only inflict some injuries on him at most.

Presently, Yang Kai was recuperating in a Black Ink Cloud with peace of mind; however, he knew that he couldn’t stay here for long. According to past experiences, these omnipresent Black Ink Clansmen would soon find him, and more Black Ink Clansmen would quickly arrive to hunt him down.

As expected, barely one hour later, some Black Ink Clansmen barged into the Black Ink Cloud and found his whereabouts. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai charged forward and easily killed these Black Ink Clansmen, and soon, he arrived at a different place and snuck into a new Black Ink Cloud.

When the nearby Black Ink Clansmen rushed over upon receiving the news, Yang Kai was already nowhere in sight.

Over the following days, Yang Kai kept changing his locations as he seized every chance to recuperate.

Soon though, he realised something was off.

The Black Ink Clansmen were reacting much slower than before.

Previously, regardless of where he went, as long as his whereabouts were exposed, a large number of Black Ink Clansmen would promptly swarm in from all directions and besiege him. Now, it seemed that they couldn’t mobilize as quickly.

This was a situation he had already expected though.

Yang Kai had learned some secrets behind the Black Ink Nests. With Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest as the centre, all the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests formed a huge information network, which was used to spread information quickly.

Now that he had destroyed Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest though, the central node was gone for good, disabling the information network between the Black Ink Clansmen.

That was the reason he decided to head straight to Hei Yuan’s direct territory. Only by disabling their information network would he be able to move around easily. Now, it seemed that he had made a wise decision.

Although he was still on his own, Yang Kai had already greatly improved his situation.

Nevertheless, destroying Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest was just the first step of his plan. Since the Black Ink Nests were the foundation of the Black Ink Clan, he naturally wouldn’t want to leave so soon as this chance was rare. Even though the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest was gone, there were still a lot of Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests remaining. For every Black Ink Nest that was destroyed, it would cause a huge loss to the Black Ink Clan.

It only took Yang Kai a few days to fully recover, and after fishing out a Universe Chart to ascertain his own location, he looked for the nearest Feudal Lord’s Fief.

Soon, he found a target.

However, the situation he came upon surprised him a bit.

After killing some Black Ink Clansmen who were searching for him along the way, he soon reached his destination, but the huge Black Ink Nest was already withered and collapsed on the ground, as though it was dying. Countless Black Ink Clansmen knelt around the Black Ink Nest with solemn expressions. It seemed that they were holding a kind of sacred ceremony.

The Feudal Lord at the front crossed his arms and chanted something.

However, regardless of how hard they tried, they couldn’t save the Black Ink Nest from dying. Its Black Ink Strength was leaking out like fresh blood, and for every bit of Black Ink Strength that was lost, the aura of the Black Ink Nest would weaken a little. It seemed that this Black Ink Nest would wither and die within half a day.

Yang Kai flew forward as though no one else was around while the Black Ink Clansmen, who were completely focused on the ceremony, didn’t detect his presence.

Standing in front of the Black Ink Nest, Yang Kai swept his gaze around and frowned, a perplexed expression on his face.

The Feudal Lord at the front finally detected Yang Kai’s aura and turned his head. When he made out Yang Kai’s face, he snapped, “It’s you!”

It wasn’t until this moment that these Black Ink Clansmen came to their senses and stood up. In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai was surrounded by all these Black Ink Clansmen.

Yang Kai turned to look at the Feudal Lord and nodded gently, “Brother Zha Gu.”

The Feudal Lord was none other than Zha Gu, who was the owner of this Fief. Yang Kai had been here once and witnessed everything when Zha Gu planted the Black Ink Nest and hatched it. It was also through Zha Gu that he learned a lot of the secrets about Black Ink Nests that the Humans were previously unaware of.

The way Yang Kai addressed Zha Gu startled him. With a doubtful look, he glanced at Yang Kai and asked, “You… Is the rumour about you real? Have you betrayed Sir Territory Lord?”

Yang Kai replied impassively, “I’m a Human, and I’ve never pledged to be loyal to him. How could you say that I’ve betrayed him? As for the rumour… I have no idea what you’ve heard, but it’s most likely to be true.”

Zha Gu snapped, “Did you destroy Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest?”

Yang Kai nodded, “En.” Then, he pointed to the front with a perplexed expression, “What happened to your Black Ink Nest?”

The reason he came all the way here was to destroy this Black Ink Nest. Besides the one here, he had decided to destroy all of the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests under Hei Yuan.

Only by doing so could he deal the heaviest blow to Hei Yuan. After all the Black Ink Nests were shattered, Hei Yuan and his subordinates would lose all of their foundation. This was a bigger contribution than killing several tens of thousands of Black Ink Clansmen on the battlefield.

“My Black Ink Nest…” Zha Gu appeared furious, “My Black Ink Nest is a sub-nest of Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest! Since you’ve destroyed the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest, do you think the sub-nest wouldn’t be affected!?”

In fact, Yang Kai already had a speculation the moment he saw this Black Ink Nest; however, when his speculation was verified by Zha Gu, he was still surprised.

Prior to this, he wasn’t aware that the death of a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest would affect the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests it spawned as well.

After giving it a thought though, he realised that it wasn’t so surprising. Zha Gu’s Black Ink Nest was a sub-nest of Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest, so there was a close connection between them. Since Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Nest was destroyed, it was expected that Zha Gu’s Black Ink Nest would be implicated.

Following a moment of deliberation, Yang Kai asked, “Is your Black Ink Nest the only one that’s been affected? Or have all the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests been implicated as well?”

Zha Gu said through gritted teeth, “Do you think I’ll tell you?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Don’t bother, I think I’ve figured it out.”

Judging from the situation Zha Gu was in, it wasn’t hard to speculate that the other Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests had been affected as well. They were probably all withering at this very moment.

Initially, Yang Kai planned on destroying all the Black Ink Nests in Hei Yuan’s territory one by one. Now, it seemed that it wasn’t necessary for him to do so.

As a thought flashed through his mind, Yang Kai asked, “Brother Zha Gu, what if the Royal Lord’s Black Ink Nest is destroyed?”

“Don’t even dream about destroying any Black Ink Nest ever again!” Zha Gu roared. Apparently, he no longer wanted to listen to any of Yang Kai’s nonsense. He extended his hand and summoned a giant halberd. At the same time, a dark fog swirled around his figure and soon, he was clad in an Artifact Armour that covered the upper half of his body.

The giant halberd and Artifact Armour were the artifacts that Yang Kai previously refined for him.

With the giant halberd in hand and the Artifact Armour on his body, Zha Gu appeared quite imposing. He directly thrust out his halberd at Yang Kai.

Presently, Yang Kai was holding his Azure Dragon Spear, and faced with the attack, he didn’t intend to dodge. His spear thrust forward like a Dragon and skirted past the giant halberd before jabbing towards Zha Gu’s chest.

A hint of ferocity flashed through Zha Gu’s eyes as he also didn’t intend to dodge the attack. He exerted even more force with the giant halberd as he was determined to wound the other party despite knowing that he would be injured as well.

He was aware that Yang Kai was extraordinarily powerful; after all, he had witnessed Yang Kai going on a killing spree back then. Those Feudal Lords were as frail as paper tigers when they were dealing with Yang Kai and Zha Gu didn’t think he was more powerful than them. Even though he had two artifacts in his possession now, he didn’t think he could defeat Yang Kai in a one-on-one fight.

In order to survive, he had to take risks despite knowing he would get hurt as well.

In fact, it was a good idea, but when the Azure Dragon Spear easily stabbed into his chest and its explosive force shattered all the organs in his body, he still appeared bewildered.

With a dispassionate expression, Yang Kai looked at him and said, “I’m the one who made that Artifact Armour. It’s ridiculous that you think you can use it to defend against me!”

Zha Gu came to his senses and asked, “Are there weaknesses in all the things you’ve made?”

Yang Kai roared, “The things I’ve made will not be used to go against my people. None of them will shed a drop of blood because of those artifacts!”
