Almost as if he knew Yang Kai’s doubts, the Old Demon said slowly, “Young Master does not need to be extremely worried about it. If you are destined to claim the inheritance, your strength will matter very little, but if the method to acquire it is otherworldly difficult, strength would contribute nothing. Young Master, did you forget the chance that the two little girls stumbled upon?”

A happy feeling emerged in Yang Kai’s heart.

He saw with his own eyes the chance the Hu sisters received. He had discovered that cave first and had even been inside it for several days, but they were the ones that were able to obtain the inheritance because they were destined for it.

“Yes, that seems to be the case.” Yang Kai let go of his worries. He glanced back at the sky another time, then turned around. Since he knew that it would take some time for the stairs to completely descend, he simply looked for a secluded corner, and then sat cross-legged in that spot.

Since he needed to snatch this inheritance, he decided that the first step was to restore his strength.

According to Yang Kai’s estimate, the process of the stairs setting up would take at least two to three days, so he would have that much time to recuperate.

Su Yan looked at him in slight surprise, thought about it, then she also left the crowd and found herself a place to sit down not too far away from Yang Kai.

The younger generation looked at the calm disposition of Yang Kai and Su Yan helplessly. Since they were nowhere close to being experts, they were unable to detach themselves from their worldly desires and display the kind of composure Yang Kai and Su Yan showed. Therefore, they looked quite immature compared to the two.

When someone coughed lightly, they began to gather their thoughts with a tinge of embarrassment, then scattered to find a place to meditate. Some ordinary disciples also formed a group, and started to talk and made noise. Amidst the noise, there was still a lingering overtone of shock and awe.

The two Hu sisters ran to and sat on either side of Yang Kai. No one knew what they were thinking.

Yang Kai opened his eyes slightly to peek at their faces. The sisters were both smiling at him sweetly, making him unable to distinguish who was who.

Yang Kai’s eyes turned a little hesitant to open any further.

“What?” looking at Yang Kai’s disposition, Hu Jiao Er asked immediately. “Us sitting beside you is your good luck. Why are you giving us such a dirty look?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, so he smiled and commented, “It’s an honour to have such beautiful flowers by my side. How could I give you two a dirty look?”

After all, they had cooperated several times and had come to know each other quite well. They were no longer strangers like before. With their bond, jokes accompanied their regular conversations.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, Hu Jiao Er replied with a sweet anger, “You have quite a sweet mouth on you!”

Hu Mei Er also added, “I thought you were a simple person, I hadn’t thought that you could also say such cheesy lines.”

Yang Kai says with a serious face, “Those words came from my heart. It was not simple flattery.”

The two sisters smiled pleasantly. It was like the blooming of two very beautiful flowers bringing colour and joy to the world.

After thinking a little, Yang Kai pointed out, “It looks like the people on your side don’t like me very much.”

Both of the sisters looked at each other and then said in one voice, “Do you fear them?”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “I am actually quite fearful of them, but they don’t have the qualifications to become my enemy, so you don’t need to be bothered about it.”

Hu Jiao Er then replied, “You have already offended the male disciples of High Heaven Pavilion, so what can the disciples of my Bloody Battle Gang count for?”

She was talking about the incident where he saved Su Yan and was able to occupy some advantage.

Immediately, Yang Kai grimaced as if in great pain.

Hu Jiao Er laughed in a playful manner then gave him a coquettish look, “Do you want me to give you a kiss so that others can envy you?”

Yang Kai peeked at her again, leant then extended his face near her, “I wish for it with all my heart.”

Hu Jiao Er blushed immediately then exclaims angrily, “You want a beauty like me to kiss you?”

“Elder sister, you need to stop your teasing! Let him rest first. He has quite a few heavy wounds.” Hu Mei Er shook her elder sister’s arm. She was having a hard time enduring the flirting.

Hu Jiao Er then adjusted her position beside Yang Kai and closed her eyes obediently.

Yang Kai and Hu Mei Er looked at each other and smiled. Then they also adjusted their position and started meditating one after the other.

Along with the passage of time, the disciples of the three sects also lost their initial curiosity, and begin to restore their Yuan Qi, occasionally opening their eyes to check for changes in the sky above.

Two days of meditation, silence, the occasional noise and complaints passed.

Yang Kai felt someone stand in front of him. He opened his eyes, only to meet Storm House’s Du Yishuang and another handsome man.

This man was Fang Ziji who had proposed to give Yang Kai the Core of Tortoise Monster Beast.

“Yang Kai, how are your wounds?” Younger Sister Du asked with serious concern.

“Well, it doesn’t look that bad.” Yang Kai’s lips beamed, then he looked at Fang Ziji who cupped his fists and asked, “Who might this brother be?”

Yang Kai didn’t recognise Fang Ziji, but during the negotiations two days before he had shown goodwill toward Yang Kai, therefore, he didn’t have too large a sense of revulsion towards him.

“I am Fang Ziji.” He said returning the courtesy, then he gives a light laugh then continued, “Brother Yang’s punch from two days ago was forceful, and made me feel heartfelt admiration towards you. I’m also jealous of the public attention you’ve been getting.”

“Brother Fang is overpraising.” Yang Kai chuckled.

Fang Ziji continued, “Brother Yang has an indomitable spirit and I, Fang Ziji, have always admired that kind of people. If we weren’t from different sects, I would want to become actual brothers with you, sharing hardship as well as weal and woe together.”

Hu Jiao Er twisted her face and mumbled just loud enough for him to hear, “Disgusting.”

Fang Ziji looked at her in contempt.

Du Yishuang pulled the arm of Fang Ziji, then said with a forced smile, “Sister, you are not helping.”

Then she looked at Yang Kai and said, “Please don’t mind him, my fellow brother has issues.”

“What... Sister, what did you just say?” Fang Ziji immediately turned to stare at Du Yishuang.

“Let it be, Brother Fang, you have a big heart, so why bother with such small matters?” Yang Kai’s lips curled upwards. He did not imagine the the number one from Storm House to have such an interesting personality.

“Brother Yang, only you understand me.” Fang Ziji said emotionally.

Hu Jiao Er interrupted with a casual sentence, “Yang Kai, you should be careful. This person doesn’t like females and thinks of them as akin to mud, and they are never able to get his approval. If you become too friendly with him, perhaps he will develop a special fondness for you.”

She covered her mouth and giggled wryly. Her words could very easily be misunderstood.

Yang Kai’s complexion immediately turned blue and he tried to edge away.

Fang Ziji said in a panic, “Hey, don’t slander me as you like. Brother Yang, don’t listen to her nonsense. I am not that kind of person.”

Yang Kai gave a slight cough and gave a complicated look.

Fang Ziji became anxious, then, with a spark of inspiration, he pulled the hand of Du Yishuang close to his chest, gave her a hug, and then kissed her on the lips.

Yang Kai looked thunderstruck.

Hu Jiao Er and Hu Mei Er looked at this scene with their mouths wide open.

Struggling, Du Yishuang gave a light moan; both sisters’ faces became crimson.

After an awkward amount of time in silence, Fang Ziji let go of Du Yishuang, wiped the corner of his mouth and then grinned, “So, Brother Yang, you should believe me now.”

Yang Kai looked at him full of surprise, then gave him a thumbs up saying, “Brother Fang showed the boldness of a real man. Really admirable.”

Hearing this praise, Fang Ziji gave an exaggerated laugh. While he was laughing, junior sister Du was blushing, then she suddenly slapped Fang Ziji in the face.

“You bastard!” Du Yishuang stomped her feet, then covered her face with both hands and ran away.

“Run slowly or you might slip!” Fang Ziji shouted while rubbing his burning cheek.

“Brother Fang, will... will you not pursue her?” Yang Kai said while staring at Du Yishuang’s back.

“You don’t need to worry, she is just throwing a noisy tantrum. She will come back when she has settled down.” Fang Ziji said without care.

And accurately, after only a few moments, Du Yishuang walked back, her face still blushing. Her head was lowered and her hands kept twisting the hem of her clothes. She had a delicate, embarrassed look.

“Hey.” Fang Ziji gives Yang Kai a wink with a self-satisfied look.

“Fellow Brother...” Du Yishuang pulled Fang Ziji’s arm without shame.

“What are you doing?” Fang Ziji raised his eyebrows and gave a smug look, still looking satisfied.

Du Yishuang lifted her hand and with an incomparable speed, flung her palm against his other cheek, then clenched her teeth and lashed out, “You are a very big bastard.”

Firing her second palm, junior sister Du looked like she had removed a foul taste from her mouth. She then turned around and stomped away arrogantly.

Fang Ziji rubbed his cheeks and looked at her with eyes wide open.

*giggles*... Hu Jiao Er and Hu Mei Er giggled uncontrollably. They didn’t expect circumstance to develop in that direction. They were now filled with admiration for Du Yishuang.

“Fellow sister, this... this...” Fang Ziji was stuttering. No one could tell how he felt, then he turned to look at Yang Kai and clumsily smiled and said, “When I meet her again I will straighten her out. She has acted against the heavens.”

Hu Jiao Er clapped her hands and said, “That was a really good play. Very comfortable to watch. Ohhhh Fang Ziji you, are now heaven..”

Fang Ziji twitched, then heaved a great sigh and recited, “A rose is not without its thorns.”

Yang Kai coughed lightly interrupting Hu Jiao Er’s retort, then asked Fang Ziji, “Brother Fang, did you come to me for something?”

Fang Ziji turned stern and turned to look at the spot ten li away from them, then asked earnestly, “I came here only to ask brother Yang if he knows something about what is happening.”

His question also piqued the interest of Hu Jiao Er and Hu Mei Er. The both of them looked at Yang Kai with full attention

Yang Kai’s vision glittered, he didn’t reply immediately. Fang Ziji then continued, “Brother Yang doesn’t need to hide, everyone can see you know something. But if Brother Yang is not comfortable with publicising his knowledge, I can understand.”

Yang Kai considered as he looked at him. He understood where this was coming from. Before when he had notified everyone about being ten li away from that place, he made everyone aware of the potential disaster. If he didn’t know, how was he able to notify everyone?

However, it didn’t matter if he told them what he knew. Either way, they would discover what it is when the cloud layers have finally descended. Someone would nose around it and eventually understand.

He looked at Hu Jiao Er and Hu Mei Er, who still looked at him attentively.

A few seconds passed and Yang Kai lets loose his thoughts, “I don’t know too much about it. After the steps in the sky come down, I will inspect it.”

Fang Ziji continued to ask, “Will it be dangerous?”

Yang Kai smiled yet again. “Brother Fang, even I am not too clear about it.”

Fang Ziji nodded obediently, cupping his fists as he soberly replied, “Many thanks, brother Yang. If someday when you have the time, I invite you to visit Storm House as a guest. Us brothers will have a good chat over a cup of wine.”

“Thank you!”

After Fang Ziji left, Yang Kai looked at the Hu sisters then said with a smile, “I know that you also want to know about it, otherwise you wouldn’t be sitting beside me just to make the disciples of the Bloody Battle Gang jealous.”

“Do you think we are here to gather information?” Hu Jiao Er disputed.

Hu Mei Er said hurriedly, “We are not here because of that! we were just...”
