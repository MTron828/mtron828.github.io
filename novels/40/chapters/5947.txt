Chapter 5946: Lady Sixth

“There’s another thing that’s worth our attention,” Li Fei Yu said.

“What is it?”

“Several days ago, Zuo Wu You sent a message back to the Spirit Religion to ask for some Masters to assist him, but someone managed to intercept it. As such, we were not aware of the incident until recently. When they reached a town where it would take a person one day to reach the Holy City, they were besieged by Chu An He and some others.”

“Chu An He?” The Saintess squinted her eyes, “If my memory serves me right, he’s under the Earth Order.”

“Yes.”

“No ordinary person could intercept Zuo Wu You’s message that was meant to ask for emergency assistance.”

“I can do that, as can the other Order Lords.”

“Has ‘that’ person finally revealed their true colours?” The Saintess snorted, “That would explain why Yang Kai and Zuo Wu You were forced to announce that the Holy Son would be entering the city the next day. They wanted to protect themselves by making everything public.”

“Indeed.”

“If we look at the outcome, they succeeded. Zuo Wu You isn’t that clever, so it must be Yang Kai’s idea,” the Saintess speculated.

“I heard that he acquired the people’s support and the blessing of the World’s Will while heading to the Holy Temple,” said Li Fei Yu suddenly. As the Fire Order Lord, she had a natural advantage when it came to gathering information. Although she wasn’t there to witness Yang Kai entering the city, her subordinates constantly updated her about what was going on.

“En,” the Saintess nodded, “That’s what I find most inconceivable.”

“Holy Saintess, is he…”

Without answering her question, the Saintess rose from her chair and said, “Big Sister Li, I have to leave the temple.”

Hearing that, Li Fei Yu put on a helpless expression.

The Saintess took her hands, “I’m not going out to have fun. There’s a serious matter I have to attend to.”

“That’s the excuse you use every time,” Li Fei Yu shot her a glare, but she still agreed to it, “You have to come back before the break of dawn.”

“Don’t worry,” the Saintess nodded. Saying so, she fished out something from her Space Ring. It was a mask that was as thin as a cicada’s wings.

Li Fei Yu took the mask and carefully placed it over the Saintess’ face. Her movements were skilful, so it was obviously not her first time doing this.

A moment later, two identical faces exchanged glances. Even the moles on the corners of their mouths were in the exact same spot. It was as though one of them was the other’s reflection in the mirror.

Following that, they traded their clothes.

Li Fei Yu took the Saintess’ white jade sceptre and let out a sigh before having a seat.

Across from her, the Saintess sported the same face as hers and smiled cheekily.

Li Fei Yu then activated the sceptre and dispelled the Grand Array.

After that, the Saintess said, “Holy Saintess, I’ll take my leave.” Her voice sounded just like Li Fei Yu’s too.

Then, she went on to say in her own voice, “Good work, Order Lord Li. Since it’s late now, you’d best get some rest.”

Following that, she turned around and stepped out of the Grand Hall before leaving the Holy Temple.

…..

Dawn City was even lovelier tonight than it was during the daytime. All the people in the restaurants were talking about the Holy Son entering the city that day and the prophecy that the first Saintess had left behind. They all looked joyful, as though they were in the midst of a huge festival.

Yang Kai moved around the city following Wu Kuang’s directions.

As he walked along the crowded streets, he soon arrived somewhere quieter.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even in a Holy City like Dawn City, there was inequality. The rich lived in luxurious houses in the city centre with servants at their beck-and-call and bottles of wine to drink all day while the poor were forced to live in the periphery of the city.

With that said, it was still the Spirit Religion’s Holy City. Even though there was inequality, the poor wouldn’t be starving or have no clothes to wear. With the Spirit Religion’s help, they were able to put food on the table despite their hardship.

Presently, Yang Kai sported a different face.

He had many artifacts in his Space Ring that he could use to disguise himself. He had collected such items when he was weak in the past. Many people had seen his face in the morning, so if he showed up with his real face, everyone in the city would be aware of his presence.

At that moment, he looked like an innocent young man. It was the kind of face commonly seen in the city.

As he looked around, he realised many low-rise houses were neatly built in the Holy City’s periphery where many people lived.

Some kids were seen having fun.

Someone was praying to a statue in front of his house. The statue was made from wood, and it was roughly 25 centimetres tall; however, the face wasn’t carved.

Yang Kai listened to the person and heard him praying for the Holy Son to save them.

The Holy Son’s statues were in front of many houses, with incense sticks’ traces showing that they were frequently prayed to.

“Are you sure it’s here?” Yang Kai frowned as he whispered to Wu Kuang.

“I think so,” Wu Kuang replied.

“You think so?” Yang Kai arched his brow.

Wu Kuang explained, “My connection with my main body is fuzzy thanks to the Space-Time River, so the guidance I’m feeling isn’t clear. Let’s look around.”

A helpless Yang Kai could only walk around the place.

He had no idea what Wu Kuang had detected, but since it was from his main body, it must be very important.

However, his actions soon alerted others.

This wasn’t a prosperous place, so there were rarely new faces. The neighbours were familiar with each other, so a stranger’s arrival would naturally catch many people’s attention, especially when this person kept looking around.

As such, Yang Kai had to stay away from the crowd.

Under a banyan tree in a certain corner, many people gathered together to unwind.

When Yang Kai walked past them, he suddenly detected something and looked at them. A figure emerged from the crowd and beckoned to him, “You’re finally here.”

When Yang Kai made out the person’s face, he was rooted to the spot.

Wu Kuang also called out in surprise as he said, “I didn’t expect to see her here!”

“Do you know this guy, Lady Sixth?” Asked an old man curiously.

The woman called Lady Sixth nodded with a smile, “He’s an old acquaintance.”

Saying so, she moved away from the crowd and walked up to Yang Kai before dipping her head, “Please come with me. It must’ve been tiring for you.”

Although she looked like an ordinary person, her clear gaze seemed able to see through all illusions and make out Yang Kai’s real face.

Yang Kai bowed his head, “Good.”

Lady Sixth then led him to head in a particular direction.

After they were gone, the people under the banyan tree started talking among themselves.

A person sighed, “It must’ve been difficult for Lady Sixth. Although she’s pretty mature, she still isn’t married.”

Another person said, “It can’t be helped. There’s someone she has to take care of, so it’s hard for her to get married.”

“She just can’t leave Little Eleventh behind,” said someone who knew a thing or two, “Two years ago, a matchmaker introduced her to a man. That guy was rich and handsome; moreover, he was from the Spirit Religion. He said that as long as she was willing to give Little Eleventh to another family, he would marry her. However, Lady Sixth refused.”

“Little Eleventh is truly pitiful. His parents perished after he was born. After Lady Sixth discovered him, she brought him back and raised him. Although they call each other Sister and Brother, they’re more like Mother and Son. No Mother in the world would have the heart to dump her child.”

They sighed at the same time, feeling sorry for what Lady Sixth had gone through.

“It’s all the Black Ink Cult’s fault. They’re the reason that many families are destroyed. If not for them, Little Eleventh wouldn’t have been an orphan, and Lady Sixth would’ve gotten married.”

“Since we’ve found the Holy Son, he’ll bring an end to our suffering sooner or later!”

All of them then started praying with sincere expressions.

Yang Kai followed ‘Lady Sixth’ to somewhere remote while feeling astonished deep within.

He didn’t expect that the guidance Wu Kuang felt from his body would lead to this.

“Lady Sixth…” Wu Kuang’s voice sounded in Yang Kai’s mind, “Oh, she’s the sixth oldest among the 10. No wonder she calls herself Lady Sixth.”

“What about you?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Wu Kuang explained, “Shi and I are different. In Shi’s case, he’s ranked eighth.”

“Then, what’s going on with this ‘Little Eleventh’?”

“I have no idea,” Wu Kuang replied, “The Soul Shi left behind wasn’t complete when it reached the 3,000 Worlds, so I didn’t inherit everything.”

Yang Kai nodded and fell silent.

Soon, they arrived at a simple-looking house. Despite that, there was still a yard surrounded by fences. In the yard, clothes that belonged to a woman and a child were hung there to dry.

Lady Sixth pushed the door open and entered the house, followed by Yang Kai as he looked around.

The decorations inside the house were simple. The place looked just like any house that a poor family would live in.

Lady Sixth lit up the oil lamp and told Yang Kai to have a seat. As the lamplight swayed, she poured a cup of tea for him, “I only have some tea in the house. Please don’t mind it.”

Yang Kai rose from the chair and took the cup before saluting the woman, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior Mu!”

The Lady Sixth before his eyes was none other than Mu.

Yang Kai had seen Mu before. It was when the Human Army first crusaded to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. They were in a perilous situation, and Mo was about to break free, but at the last moment, the hidden hand that Mu had left behind was activated. At that time, a burst of energy was released and transformed into a sacred figure that embraced the Black Ink Ocean and eventually made Mo fall asleep.

At that time, all the Humans on the battlefield bore witness to the legendary woman.

She was so stunning that no one would forget about her after setting their eyes on her once; therefore, when the woman called out to Yang Kai after he arrived at this place, he instantly recognised her.

She was Mu, one of the 10 Martial Ancestors, the strongest among them.

It was thanks to her that the Humans were still safe for now.

The hidden hand she had activated back then hadn’t been used up yet. It was a gargantuan Space-Time River hovering in the void that was hidden in the deepest part of the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Anyone would be awestruck when they saw that Space-Time River.

The guidance that Wu Kuang’s body was indicating must’ve come from Mu. Due to the Space-Time River, the message wasn’t clear; therefore, the thread of consciousness by Yang Kai’s side had no idea what was going on as well. Wu Kuang could only lead Yang Kai to this place, and he finally realised everything upon seeing Mu.

Silavin: Just so that you guys aren’t confused, Mu is using her ranking in terms of seniority. So, she is the Sixth Ancestor. In other contexts, she would be Old Sixth or Little Sixth. Here, they just use Sixth Woman, which I think Lady Sixth is better.
