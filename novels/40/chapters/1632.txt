“Woman, this Liu advises you to surrender without a fight, do so and you’ll suffer less! This Liu is a man of culture and does not want to embarrass a woman.” On the battlefield down below, the older looking man called out while attacking, as if he was trying to persuade the woman to give up resisting. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The other man, who looked a little younger, coldly snorted in response, “Why bother speaking any nonsense with her, Senior Brother Liu? This woman’s looks are pleasing. So, once we capture her alive, we’ll be able to thoroughly enjoy her while she begs for death!”

Although the cultivators from Brilliant Flame Sect all cultivated Fire Attribute Secret Arts, they possessed a Secret Technique that could allow them to harvest the Ice Attribute Saint Qi of Ice Heart Valley disciple to achieve a rapid rise in their cultivations.

The two Sects had been enemies for countless years, and many female disciples from Ice Heart Valley had disappeared over those millennia, almost all of whom were captured and taken away by Brilliant Flame Sect.

The fate of those female disciples was easy to imagine.

Although this kind of Secret Technique was also quite dangerous to Brilliant Flame Sect’s cultivators, many of their disciples were hot-headed and took pride in tormenting Ice Heart Valley disciples to harvest their cultivations.

Brilliant Flame Sect’s leaders ignored such behaviour and even condoned it in secret.

The two Brilliant Flame Sect men engaging in such banter greatly disturbed the woman’s focus.

“Despicable! Shameless!” The woman grit her teeth and pushed her Saint Qi even harder, sending out a wave of Ice Attribute energy which condensed into the shape of a flock of birds which weaved through the air as they honed in on the two vile men, trying to blind their vision.

“She’s trying to run away!” The younger Brilliant Flame Sect disciple reacted quickly and pushed his Fire Attribute Saint Qi, turning him into a burning ball of flame as he dove straight into the flock of ice birds.

The ice vaporized on contact as the flames were far too intense.

Liu Xiang took advantage of the momentary opening his partner had created and punched towards the gap in the ice bird screen.

A huge flame tiger suddenly appeared and sent out a shocking roar as it charged towards the fleeing woman.

Being attacked from both left and right, the woman was immediately suppressed, and although she used all the means she had at her disposal to resolve this crisis, she was still hit by the flame tiger on her shoulder, creating a long gash, out of which her blood poured.

As she staggered from the blow, the two Brilliant Flame Sect disciples rushed towards her with grim expressions.

The woman’s face became desperate as she felt her life flash before her eyes, a trace of regret and nostalgia overwhelming her for a moment before she quickly steeled her will and made her resolve.

She knew that if she really fell into the hands of this pair from Brilliant Flame Sect, her fate would be worse than death.

In fact, whenever the disciples of Ice Heart Valley went out, the Elders would warn them that if they had a choice, it was better for them to die than to be captured!

Every disciple of Ice Heart Valley remembered these words.

“Damn, this cheap slut wants to commit suicide!” The younger Brilliant Flame Sect disciple shouted. He had fought with many disciples of Ice Heart Valley and had seen this scene numerous times before, so he understood this woman’s intentions.

“She won’t get to die so easily!” Liu Xiang smiled wickedly as he stretched out his hand flung out a rope-like artifact covered in flaming light that swiftly wound around the woman.

Immediately yanking on the rope, it tightened up greatly.

The woman’s rapidly surging Saint Qi’s fluctuations suddenly subsided and she stood in place, a look of horror filling her face.

“Haha, this Liu’s Yuan Sealing Rope was specially created by an Artifact Refining Grandmaster to suppress you Ice Heart Valley women. As long as you’re bound by this rope, no matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to detonate your Saint Qi,” Liu Xiang saw he had succeeded and didn’t bother keeping up his previous ‘moral’ image, instead lewdly gazing at his capture prey with a wicked grin on his face.

“Kill me!” The woman struggled, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not circulate her Saint Qi. This rope artifact seemed to not only bind her body, but her cultivation as well.

Liu Xiang was not joking, this artifact had indeed been created specifically to deal with disciples of Ice Heart Valley, and now that she was tied up by it, she couldn’t circulate her Saint Qi at all.

“How could I be willing to kill you!” Liu Xiang grinned evilly, “It’s not easy to catch a woman from Ice Heart Valley alive, and you’re such a beauty. This Liu cannot wait to savour your taste.”

The woman’s face was pale as she could almost foresee how miserable her fate would be in the future.

“You still want to bite your tongue and commit suicide? In your dreams!” The younger man snorted coldly, reached out his hand, and sent a wave of his Saint Qi into the woman’s body, causing her to stiffen in place, unable to even speak.

“Let’s leave here first,” Liu Xiang glanced over at the main battlefield several dozen kilometres away but did not show any intention to go help. For him, catching one enemy alive was enough.

“Junior Brother will accompany you,” The other man grinned meaningfully.

“Naturally, don’t worry, Junior Brother will have his share as well!” Liu Xiang understood his meaning, stepped forward, and grabbed towards the captured woman.

However, after taking only three steps, in a flash, a strange figure appeared in front of him and stood between him and the woman.

Liu Xiang was taken aback and instinctively jumped back several dozen meters. Staring at this newcomer vigilantly, he questioned in a low voice, “Friend, who are you?”

The other party’s only response was an icy cold glare, one that made Liu Xiang, who cultivated a Fire Attribute Secret Art and should be immune to most cold, shiver uncontrollably.

“Senior Brother...” The younger cultivator also found that something was wrong. The young man who appeared suddenly looked at them with an unkind look and there was a rich murderous intent pulsing from his body. Obviously, this stranger didn’t have good intentions here.

Liu Xiang frowned as he stared for a moment before his eyes suddenly bulged and he exclaimed, “It’s you!”

He clearly recognized the identity of this person!

As soon as these words fell, Liu Xiang didn’t hesitate to use his Movement Skill to flee!

Liu Xiang’s partner was stunned for a moment but did not dare to remain either, quickly turning into a flaming beam of light as he tried to escape.

This stranger who had suddenly appeared was an Origin Returning Realm master, not someone they could compete with at all. Although the two of them did not want to give up the woman they had worked so hard to capture, preserving their lives was far more important compared to her.

Moreover, both of them recognized that this newcomer was none other than the person they had been looking for this past year. Right now, their most important duty was to report discovering him here as soon as possible.

The speed of these two was quite good, and in the blink of an eye, they had already run a few thousand meters.

The young man didn’t seem to care, however, and only when their figures were about to disappear from sight did he stretch out his hand unhurriedly and snapped his fingers twice.

The sound of something shattering rang out next.

Suddenly, in the distance, two screams rang out and the two Brilliant Flame Sect disciples stopped in place, as if struck by lightning, then fell to the ground.

The captured woman was completely startled as her beautiful eyes stared at the back of the man in front of her. For a moment, she felt that this broad figure, that stood before her like a mountain, was quite a pleasant sight and her heart filled with gratitude.

She had not expected that at this critical time, a master would suddenly appear to help her.

There were no male disciples in Ice Heart Valley, but perhaps this person was someone from a Sect attached to Ice Heart Valley.

She wanted to open her mouth to offer her thanks, but the seal which was placed on her by the Brilliant Flame Sect disciple before was still preventing her from speaking.

However... why did this person’s back seem somewhat familiar? The longer she stared, the more she felt she had seen it somewhere before.

The puzzled the woman greatly.

After killing the two Brilliant Flame Sect disciples, the murderous intent radiating from the man in front of him quickly dissipated and he turned around to direct a complicated look towards her.

Looking at each other, it was as if she had been struck by a petrification technique as she stared at the face of the man who had saved her.

She could hardly believe her eyes!

Yang Kai let out a sigh and spoke first, “Senior Qing Ya, it’s been many years since we last met.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and with a wave, cut off the rope-like artifact that was binging her. Without the shackles of this artifact, Qing Ya was able to break the seal which was placed on her by circulating her Saint Qi slightly; however, instead of doing so, she simply remained frozen in place, staring at Yang Kai in shock.

She never expected that it would be Yang Kai who came to her rescue!

One had to know that Yang Kai, the one responsible for stirring up all the chaos on Scarlet Wave Star this past year, had never once shown his face!

On top of that, his current strength was impossible for Qing Ya to see through, which meant his cultivation was at least a full Great Realm higher than her own! Only such a massive gap would prevent her from being able to properly gauge his level.

How did he manage to grow so quickly?

Qing Ya had thought that Su Yan’s growth was scary enough; after all, they had all left Tong Xuan Realm together and at the time, Su Yan’s cultivation was lower than hers, but after entering the Star Field, Su Yan seemed to fully blossom and her cultivation soared upwards, reaching the First-Order Origin Returning Realm not long ago.

Yet, Yang Kai seemed to have reached an even higher cultivation than Su Yan.

[Where had he been all these years? How did he cultivate?]

Qing Ya’s thoughts were a mess

Only after a long time did Qing Ya gradually calm down and ask hesitantly, “Yang Kai? Is it really you?”

“It’s me,” Yang Kai nodded gently.

He too had not expected to meet the former Sect Master of Ice Sect, Qing Ya, here on Scarlet Wave Star.

The moment he saw her, Yang Kai had doubted whether he was imagining things.

Qing Ya and Su Yan were supposed to be together though, so if Qing Ya was here, what about Su Yan? Was she here too? Yang Kai’s thoughts became turbulent and he was barely able to suppress the expectations deep in his heart.

“Senior Qing Ya, Su Yan...” Yang Kai took a deep breath and asked, his voice nearly cracking, afraid he would not hear the answer he was looking for.

“Su Yan is fine, you don’t have to worry,” Qing Ya’s answer lifted a great weight from Yang Kai’s heart.

It had been more than thirty years, thirty years since they last met! This kind of parting was different from the one he had with Xia Ning Chang as although Yang Kai had not seen Little Senior Sister for many years, he at least knew she was safe on Tong Xuan Realm, waiting for him to return.

Su Yan’s situation was entirely different. For so many years, Yang Kai did not know where she was, how she was living, or whether she was safe.

This worry tormented him far more than them simply being separated.

Qing Ya’s few words brought a broad smile to Yang Kai’s face, one filled with relief.

“Did you arrive here together?” Yang Kai asked again, “Where is she now?”

“She’s not here right now, she’s currently back in Ice Heart Valley.”

“Ice Heart Valley? You joined Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Silavin: I was thinking about the title. If I should even bother to hide it.

I mean, it is obvious right?

I probably won’t do so the next time if it is this obvious but do share your thoughts.

Title – Qing Ya
