The various arrays laid out on Dawning Light were the most advanced that Blue Sky Pass could produce.

Usually, if the defensive arrays could bring out 70% of their power under the combined efforts of several Squad members, then with Yang Kai personally powering the array, 100% of its effect burst out all at once.

In terms of its protective power, it was naturally different from before. The difference of 30% almost doubled the shield’s strength.

Feng Ying had originally been worried that Dawning Light would not be able to hold on for long, but when she saw the attacks causing only a ripple as they hit the light barrier before becoming completely useless, she swiftly shouted, “Charge through!”

Hearing this, the Squad member in charge of steering the ship manoeuvred Dawning Light so that it could crash straight through the Black Ink Clan Army, moving in whichever direction had the most enemies.

In an instant, Dawning Light cut a swath of destruction wherever it passed. The Black Ink Clansmen who were unable to dodge in time had all their bones shattered when they were hit by the large Warship, while those who reacted quickly enough to dodge were still annihilated by the glowing lights coming from the offensive arrays.

The other dozen or so Warships were following closely behind Dawning Light, and a barrage of powerful attacks was fired from them in all directions.

A deep gash soon appeared in the Black Ink Clan’s line of defence.

Once Dawning Light reached the other end of the enemy army, it quickly turned around and crashed back into it again. With Dawn taking point, the dozen other Squad-level Warships spread out like wings that proceeded into another deadly charge.

After three or four such sweeps, the Black Ink Clan’s troops on the defence line were all either killed or injured, completely collapsing, no longer able to maintain an effective formation. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

On the Warship where the bearded man was, the beautiful Vice Squad Leader muttered in awe, “Dawning Light is so powerful!”

The bearded man licked his lips and chuckled, “You have no idea, the arrays on the Dawning Light are all top of the line. The Array Cores are also the top of the top, whether it be the offensive or the defensive artifacts; otherwise, how could they be this powerful? Heh, there even seems to be a Universe Array aboard Dawning Light as well as a stock of Purifying Light.”

The beautiful woman knitted her brow and grumbled, “Aren’t the Army Commanders a bit too biased? What, was Dawn born from the real mother and we were raised by the stepmother?”

The bearded man raised his hand and smacked her on the head, “Don’t talk nonsense!”

The beautiful woman covered her head, aggrieved.

The bearded man told her, “The Army Commanders are in charge of the four Army regiments, and all the soldiers under their command are their lifeblood. They won’t do something like play favourites. All the modifications on Dawning Light were commissioned for Military Merits.”

The beautiful woman was astonished, “How many Military Merits would that cost?”

The bearded man was a little deflated, “I quietly asked the Junior Brother at the Merit Hall last time, and he told me that the Military Merits that Dawn Squad’s Leader obtained on the last battle was…” He casually named a figure before continuing, “After commissioning Dawning Light’s construction, all those Military Merits were spent, and that was just his own. Senior Sister Feng Ying’s Military Merits were also basically exhausted as well.”

The beautiful woman looked even more shocked, “They really are generous, spending so many of their Military Merits on Dawning Light.”

The bearded man grinned, “You have to admire their boldness, but Dawning Light has now become an extraordinary weapon. After this battle, they may not be able to earn back all the Military Merits that they spent, but 30 or 40% shouldn’t be a problem. If they just fight a few more battles like this, then they would definitely be able to earn everything back and more.”

The beautiful woman pouted, “If we had as many Military Merits, then we could do the same.”

“But we don’t!” The bearded man guffawed, “So, we should follow Dawning Light. They eat the meat, but for us to have a share of some of the soup is still very good!”

Then, the bearded man’s face suddenly turned solemn, “The Black Ink Clan’s line of defence has been broken, so we’ll soon be facing their main force head-on. Remember, if you get corrupted by Black Ink Strength, head for Dawning Light, they have Purifying Light!”

The beautiful woman nodded heavily, “I understand!”

“Open the array!” The bearded man shouted. Then, he raised his hand, summoning his large wolf fang mace, a horrible-looking club that was covered in spikes.

A gap was opened in the ship’s shield and both the bearded man and his beautiful subordinate rushed out at once, charging straight for the Black Ink Clan. The wolf fang mace swung down hard and the few Black Ink Clansmen who were unable to dodge it were smashed into a mist of blood at once.

The bearded man laughed heartily, “Hahaha! Black Ink Clan brats, come and have a taste of your Grandfather’s big rod!”

The beautiful woman glared at him in disgust. One after another black flowers bloomed from the tip of her sword as she stabbed towards the Black Ink Clansmen who were fleeing in front of her. As the sword flowers faded, the Black Ink Clansman fell to pieces.

The ship they were from followed closely behind them while the offensive arrays continued unleashing their power. Clearly, this Squad had been together for a long time, allowing the two Seventh-Order Masters and the ship to work in perfect harmony.

This was not the only ship that was doing so; the rest of the dozen ships were also the same. Each one of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters aboard them had personally come out to join the battle, fighting around their Warships. This way of fighting was undoubtedly safer. Even if they were to encounter a strong enemy, they would still have the chance to return to their Warships so that they could recover; however, the number of Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in each of these Squads was not high. There were basically only two on each ship.

On the other hand, Dawning Light, which was leading the pack, had five Seventh-Order Masters rush out at once. Whether it was Yang Kai or Feng Ying, once they attacked, even Feudal Lords would find it hard to defend themselves.

On the deck of Dawning Light, there was even a small figure standing at the bow while a small gap had been opened up in the barrier in front of her. The figure was holding a powerful bow with its string pulled taut, a golden light at her fingertips.

With a whizz, a bolt of golden light flashed, and every time it did, a Feudal Lord would either be severely injured or would be felled directly.

Bai Yi, who came from Divine Feather Paradise and cultivated the Sun Chaser Arrow Heart, had achieved the eighth level of Mastery in the Archery Dao, so every arrow released from her fingertips was all but unstoppable.

With Dawning Light at the centre, any Feudal Lord who caught her eye within a 100-kilometre radius would either take a severe hit from her or be taken out entirely. There was no third possibility.

The power of such an archer on such a battlefield was simply too great.

Moreover, she never focused on any Black Ink Clansmen below the Feudal Lords, only those above them.

Originally, the Black Ink Clan had a huge advantage in this particular line of defence, pinning down a dozen Human Squads and forcing them back slowly. However, after Dawn’s arrival, the tide was instantly turned. Not only did the Humans gain the ability to fight back, they had successfully thrown the Black Ink Clan’s soldiers into chaos.

In the midst of the intense battle, a bloodied Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master suddenly rushed towards Dawning Light, a flash of unnatural Black Qi lingering about his pale face.

This Seventh-Order Human had obviously been invaded by Black Ink Strength.

Bai Yi immediately pointed her arrow at him and the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was instantly frozen in place, not daring to move.

Fortunately, Bai Yi quickly realized the situation and stepped aside, shouting, “Get in, quickly!”

The Seventh-Order Master cupped his fist, “Thanks are not enough for this kindness.”

In a flash, he dashed through the gap in the protective barrier and entered Dawning Light. At once, a member of Dawn came to lead him to a Space Array on the deck.

As a light flashed, the Seventh-Order Master’s figure disappeared.

A few moments later, the light reappeared, and the man reemerged on the Space Array. Even though he was still looking a little tired, the Black Ink Strength covering his face had disappeared.

The bearded man was not the only one who knew that there was Purifying Light sealed aboard Dawning Light. Previously, while Dawning Light was undergoing repairs at the forward base, the Seventh-Order Squad Leaders had basically all come over to see it, and all of them were in great admiration of its capabilities.

However, this was a Warship that Yang Kai and Feng Ying spent an enormous amount of Military Merits to modify so no one else could emulate it no matter how much they envied it.

It was not that Inner Sanctum was unwilling to do this for others, only that the cost of such a customization was so high that Blue Sky Pass was unable to bear it for every Squad, so they could only use Military Merits as a stopgap measure. What was more, the average Squad’s makeup was also lacking quite a bit when compared to Dawn, so they did not require this level of modification. To put it mildly, even if Dawning Light were given to another Squad, it would be difficult for them to even operate it properly.

Anyone who had visited Dawning Light naturally knew that there was Purifying Light sealed on it.

Now, if anyone were to be corrupted by Black Ink Strength on this battlefield, their best choice was to seek help from Dawning Light; otherwise, they would have to head back to the forward base using the Universe Transference Law.

The Seventh-Order Master cupped his fist again in thanks before rushing out of Dawning Light, going back to slaughtering more enemies.

On the battlefield, even the slightest mishap could trigger a chain reaction of changes.

Here, Black Ink Clan’s defensive line had collapsed with Dawn’s entrance, and this collapse was now rapidly spreading throughout the battlefield.

It had been less than an hour since Dawn entered the fray, but almost all of the Black Ink Clansmen on this defensive line had been annihilated. Those who were still alive were either fleeing or had fled long ago.

Yang Kai did not stop there though, leading the Seventh-Order Masters and Dawning Light under him towards the nearest Black Ink Clan Army.

A dozen Warships followed in their wake.

With Dawning Light at the front, the dozen Warships quickly plunged into the Black Ink Clan’s Army like a sharp blade.

Immediately, another commotion broke out.

In the void above the battlefield, powerful Divine Senses were confronting each other from a distance.

The defeat of the Black Ink Clan Army had angered several Territory Lords. Even though they were in confrontation with the Eighth-Order Humans, they were still paying attention to the battle below.

Undoubtedly, they were disappointed by the performance of their subordinates.

One of the Territory Lords had his gaze fixed on Dawning Light. Murderous intent was surging and he had a mind to completely ignore everything else, enter the battle, and blast that Warship to pieces.

He saw everything clearly. The Black Ink Clan had a slight advantage over the Humans before, but after this Warship appeared on the battlefield, the situation began to spiral out of control.

This Warship was definitely the Humans’ sharpest weapon. If he could slaughter its members, it would be a huge loss for the enemy.

However, as soon as this thought surfaced in his mind, he was caught by the Eighth-Order Masters hiding in the void, and a warning rang out in his ears, “Why don’t you try and see what happens?”

At the sound of the voice, the Territory Lord could finally be sure which Eighth-Order Master it was that had his eyes on him and coldly snorted, “Cha Hu!”
