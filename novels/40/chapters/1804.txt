Lu Gui Chen, who had just escaped death, only felt his entire body go limp as sweat soaked his clothes and the light wind in the air chilled him to the bone.

“If you dare lie to me, I’ll make you wish I had just killed you,” Yang Kai glared at Lu Gui Chen coldly. “Now speak, what is this amazing secret you speak of?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lu Gui Chen’s face was pale as he gulped anxiously, turning to Yang Kai and asking imploringly, “Can you withdraw these two Monster Beasts first...”

With two pairs of blood-coloured eyes staring at him, Lu Gui Chen could not calm his heart as he felt his life constantly hanging by a thread.

Yang Kai coldly snorted and silently issued an order, having the Tail Crown Snake and Star King Turtle immediately return to their Golden Blood Thread form and fly back to him.

Lu Gui Chen nervously wiped the cold sweat from his brow before glancing at Yang Kai. Seeing the impatient look on his face, Lu Gui Chen quickly said, “If I tell you this secret, can you promise not to kill me?”

“Your life is not as valuable as you think, killing you or letting you go is of no consequence to me, but it depends on the value of this so-called secret of yours!”

“Okay!” Lu Gui Chen’s body shook, “This King... cough cough, I can guarantee with my life that you will definitely be interested in this secret.”

“Enough nonsense, waste any more time and you’ll die.”

“Yes, yes, yes...” Lu Gui Chen shivered as he nodded repeatedly before saying, “If I told you that this continent had formed a Source, would you believe it?”

“A Source?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with brilliant light as he quickly asked, “How do you know?”

“I’ve been trapped here for several dozen years now,” Lu Gui Chen smiled wryly, “One day, a few years ago, when I was in retreat, I suddenly felt the aura of this continent become disturbed and a kind of subtle call reached out from deep below ground. At first, I thought that some kind of incredible treasure had been born and released my Divine Sense to investigate, but as soon as I did so, my Divine Sense was actually drawn in by that very force. I saw a dazzling light at that moment, one that gave off a feeling like a newborn baby, filled with curiosity. I tried to make contact with it and wanted to get closer to have a better look at it, but was quickly repelled. I didn’t know what that thing was at the time, but after thinking about it carefully, I concluded it should be this continent’s Source. As for how certain I am of my conclusion though... I cannot say for sure.”

As he finished speaking, he looked towards Yang Kai anxiously.

“A Source! Haha, it seems that thing really was a Star Source!” Yang Kai laughed happily.

When he was first trapped on the floating continent and was using his Divine Sense to shuttled through The Void, Yang Kai had inadvertently sent a thread of his Spiritual Energy deep underground where he discovered a massive luminous ball of energy that contained extremely terrifying power. Yang Kai did not know what it was at the time though.

Back then, his strength wasn’t high, so he couldn’t identify what that mass of energy was, but he knew it wasn’t something ordinary, so he left his thread of Divine Sense with it.

It was precisely by relying on this thread of Divine Sense that Yang Kai was able to accurately locate the floating continent and return to this place.

Hearing what Lu Gui Chen said at this moment, Yang Kai immediately confirmed that the object he found back then was indeed this place’s Source!

If the floating continent was a small star, what Lu Gui Chen and he saw back then was no doubt its Star Source.

It was just that the Star Source Yang Kai saw back then was still maturing and had yet to fully form. As for Lu Gui Chen’s experience, it was the actual birth of a new Star Source.

If this floating continent was left alone, it would truly have an opportunity to become a real Cultivation Star in the future.

“Young Hero, I...” Lu Gui Chen carefully chose his words, not knowing what Yang Kai planned to do with him now.

“Stay there and don’t move, if you dare to act without my permission, you’ll die,” After Yang Kai finished speaking, he pinpointed the location of the Divine Sense thread he left here all those years ago and prepared to set out. Just before he departed though, he threw a ring to Lu Gui Chen and said, “Pack everything you’ve collected over the years into that.”

Finished here, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and disappeared.

Lu Gui Chen took the Space Ring and stood in place, staring at the place where Yang Kai had disappeared. After a long time, he came back to his senses, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and tried to swallow down his fears.

He couldn’t tell how Yang Kai left just now, all he knew was that the gap between them was far, far larger than he first imagined. It was now obvious how ridiculous his idea of fighting Yang Kai was.

If he had really tried to resist, he would have died long ago.

After a long silence, Lu Gui Chen flew off in a certain direction with his head down, preparing to put all the good things he collected over the years into this ring.

Although these rare herbs were all precious, they were not as precious as his life. Currently, Yang Kai’s fist was bigger than his, so how could he dare put up a fight?

Deep underground, Yang Kai exerted quite some effort before arriving at his destination.

This place was about ten thousand kilometres below the surface and was actually a large, hollow space.

At the centre of this space though, there was a mass of luminous energy, exuding a soft light.

It was the ball of energy that Yang Kai had seen several dozen years ago.

But at this moment, it seemed a bit smaller than it was before, more refined as well. When Yang Kai arrived here, a strong repulsive force came from this mass of energy, seemingly wanting to push him out of this space.

But Yang Kai stood in place calmly, unaffected by the repulsive force.

Staring closely at the luminous energy, Yang Kai was overjoyed, “It really is a Star Source.”

As the Star Master of Shadowed Star, he had already refined Shadowed Star’s Star Source, so he was able to judge what lay before him accurately.

Although there was a big difference between the Source of this floating continent and Shadowed Star’s Source, they definitely had their similarities as well. The sheer power contained inside this Source was terrifying to the extent it could not be resisted by mere humans.

“Haha, even the thread of Divine Sense I left behind had fully integrated into it! Doesn’t that mean this thing is mine already?” Yang Kai observed for a while and could not help getting excited.

He did not know how it happened, but apparently, the thread of Divine Sense he had left behind here all those years ago had merged together with this Star Source and grown along with it.

In other words, this Source had already been branded with his mark!

No wonder this Star Source was unable to repel him despite releasing more than enough force to do so.

Yang Kai could not help trembling slightly in excitement.

This Source was already marked with his brand, so it would certainly be easy to refine. If he refined it, didn’t that mean he would become the Star Master of this floating continent?

He was already the Lord of Shadowed Star, so if he was to become the master of this continent, he would be the Star Master of two Stars!

Such an achievement had never been seen in the history of the Star Field.

Even for those Third-Order Origin Kings, it would be impossible to refine two Star Sources.

As such thoughts swirled around Yang Kai’s head, he became extremely excited, especially when he thought about the benefits one received after becoming a Star Master. Star Master and Cultivation Star were closely related and would share honour and disgrace. When a Cultivation Star prospered, its Star Master would benefit, while if a Cultivation Star was weak, the Star Master would suffer, and vice versa.

The floating continent could be regarded as an extremely small Cultivation Star that had just been born and still had infinite possibilities for growth. As long as Yang Kai refined its Source, as the floating continent grew in the future, he would also benefit greatly!

Considering all this, Yang Kai could no longer contain himself.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai tried to communicate with the Star Source in front of him, but he quickly found that the other party did not respond at all.

After thinking about it though, Yang Kai relaxed.

This Star Source was born not long ago and was just like a newborn baby, so how could it react intelligently?

“I should refine it first then try communicating with it,” Yang Kai muttered to himself, sat down cross-legged directly, formed a seal with his hands, and closed his eyes tightly, the next moment allowing a pure Spiritual Energy flow from his body.

A mass of Spiritual Energy visible to the naked eye appeared and transformed into Yang Kai’s appearance.

It was Yang Kai’s Soul Avatar.

If he wanted to refine the Star Source, he had to first have his Soul leave his body and merge with the source itself. This was one of the reasons why refining a Star Source was so dangerous; if one weren’t careful, their Soul would be completely extinguished.

Even those Third-Order Origin King masters would not dare to attempt this unless they were absolutely confident of their success. This was also why Star Masters were so rare in the Star Field.

Throughout history, many peerless Third-Order Origin Kings had died while attempting to refine Star Sources.

If it were not for the Star Source on the floating continent being newly born and not yet very powerful, as well as the fact that his thread of Divine Sense had already merged together with it, Yang Kai wouldn’t have dared to attempt this.

This was different from when he refined Shadowed Star’s Source. Yang Yan had helped him at the time so there was not any danger, but this time, he could only rely on himself.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had a lot of confidence because he possessed the Star Refining Art.

The Star Refining Art was something he brought out of the Emperor Garden and was a Secret Technique specifically designed to refine Star Sources. It was with the help of this Secret Technique that Little Senior Sister had been able to become the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm.

With a sway of his Soul Avatar, Yang Kai rushed into the Star Source in front of him, not facing any obstacles or resistance along the way. Instead, Yang Kai felt that his Soul was being wrapped in a mass of warm water, making him feel extremely comfortable.

Yang Kai rejoiced when feeling this as it meant that the mark he left on this Star Source was not rejecting his Soul.

It seemed that everything would go well.

Silently, he began to execute the Star Refining Art to refine the Source around him.

Time passed little by little, and the light from the Star Source underwent a mysterious and profound change.

The process itself was quite simple. When his Soul Avatar reached a certain degree of agreement with the Star Source, all Yang Kai had to do was change his hand seal and begin to draw some of the Star Source’s strength into his body.

As long as this Star Source’s strength was incorporated into his body, the refinement would be complete and he would become the Star Master of this continent!

But the moment he began to draw in the Star Source’s power, a different force suddenly erupted from within Yang Kai’s body. This force was many times stronger and more terrifying than the Source strength of the floating continent.

Under the interference of this force, the docile Source strength from the floating continent became disordered and thrashed about, completely escaping Yang Kai’s control.

“Not good!” Yang Kai cried out as his eyes shot open and he hurriedly retrieved his Soul Avatar.

*Wa...*

With a loud cough, Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of blood as his breathing became turbulent and his face went as pale as paper.

Only after taking a few breaths was he able to suppress his rioting Saint Qi and vitality.

Looking at the source in front of him, Yang Kai frowned, “How could this be?”
