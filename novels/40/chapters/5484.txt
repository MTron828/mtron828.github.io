Chapter 5485: Exploded!?

Big Brother Huang started speaking but hesitated to continue. As such, Big Sister Lan took over, “Long ago, our consciousnesses were muddled, which resulted in the destruction of many Great Territories, and that’s how the current size of the Chaotic Dead Territory came to be. After we gained sentience, we no longer dared to freely wander about, so we stayed here to avoid harming other places.”

[This sounds a little familiar…]

Suddenly, Yang Kai recalled that the formation of the Black Ink Battlefield was quite similar to the Chaotic Dead Territory, both were the fusion of many Great Territories. However, the Black Ink Battlefield was the result of the wanton release of Mo’s Black Ink Strength, whereas when the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer came to realize the dangers of their power, they chose to remain isolated in the Chaotic Dead Territory.

“I see… Is there really nothing we can do about it?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan looked at each other before answering in unison, ““It’s because we can’t control our own strength.””

Yang Kai was dumbstruck by this revelation for a moment, but then, he recalled the scene when he first came to the Chaotic Dead Territory and realization instantly dawned upon him, “That makes sense; after all, there were so many Yellow and Blue Crystals here!”

The first time he came to the Chaotic Dead Territory, things were not as peaceful as they were now.

At that time, the Chaotic Dead Territory was filled with the energy leaking out of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer. The Yin and Yang Element energies manifested into a myriad of strange avatars that kept clashing with each other everywhere in the Chaotic Dead Territory, literally shaking the void.

Had Giant Spirit God Ah Er not accompanied him at that time, how would Yang Kai, who was just in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, have survived unscathed? He would have died the moment he entered, leaving not even a trace of his existence behind. This was a place where even the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master could not survive for more than a few breaths.

The entrance to the Chaotic Dead Territory was always guarded by the Cave Heavens and Paradises, with an Eighth-Order Ancestor and several Seventh-Order Masters stationed all year around. It was a mission assigned to Eighth-Order Masters in turn. Normally a dozen Masters would be present at the entrance, tasked with monitoring the Chaotic Dead Territory and the movements of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer.

This mission was both wonderful and terrible. It was terrible because it was very dangerous. Even though the Chaotic Dead Territory did not expand often, sometimes remaining unchanged for thousands of years, and the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer never came out, if someday these two Supreme Beings got bored and decided to take a walk, the Masters monitoring the entrance would be the first to suffer.

On the other hand, the reason why it was wonderful was that the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters stationed here would have the opportunity to collect some Yin and Yang Element materials at the outskirts of the Chaotic Dead Territory. If they were in luck, they could easily harvest some Seventh-Order or even Eighth-Order materials.

Yang Kai had visited the Chaotic Dead Territory twice and had met the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master guarding the entrance both times, but he had not seen anyone this time. Similarly, there was no trace of the cultivators he left behind last time to help serve as Generals for these two’s war games. Most probably, they had already left to fight against the Black Ink Clan.

It was precisely because of the dangers of the Chaotic Dead Territory that there was such a shortage of Yin and Yang Element materials, despite the entire Chaotic Dead Territory being absolutely filled with Yellow and Blue Crystals.

If the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer could perfectly control their own strength, there would be no Yin and Yang avatars to confront each other, and neither would there be any Yellow and Blue Crystals.

It was precisely because they couldn’t control their own strength that their energies would leak from their bodies, which would cause all other things.

Later on, when Yang Kai left the Small Stone Race in the Chaotic Dead Territory, the two had tried to directly channel their energies into the Small Stone Race, which ultimately caused the Small Stone Race to mutate.

It didn’t make sense that Yang Kai’s Small Stone Race still remained the same after tens of thousands of years in his Small Universe, while the Chaotic Dead Territory’s Small Stone Race had undergone an astonishing transformation. Surprisingly, even members comparable to Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had been born here, but when the pure energy of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer were taken into account, it was only natural for evolution to occur.

The continuous fights between the Small Stone Race were mainly driven by the characteristics of their race, as well as by the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer’s energies.

It could be said that the confrontation between the Yin and Yang in the Chaotic Dead Territory had never stopped. Only the way they were clashing had changed, and the reason for this change was because it was deliberately directed by Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan.

Naturally, Yang Kai already knew of this.

It was just that he couldn’t understand how beings as powerful as Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan couldn’t control their own strength. Logically speaking, the stronger one was, the greater the control they had of their own strength, but when it came to Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, it was the exact opposite.

Nonetheless, if what they said was true, the destruction they would cause might be even worse than the Black Ink Clan.

Yang Kai really wanted these two to leave the Chaotic Dead Territory to deal with the Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods, but by the looks of it, this was just wishful thinking on his part.

Unwilling to give up though, Yang Kai asked, “Are you two completely unable to restrain your strength?”

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan both vigorously shook their heads like rattle drums.

Yang Kai rubbed his aching brow and asked, “Have the two of you ever tried to fuse together?”

“Like this?” Big Brother Huang sent a wisp of his Great Sun Force.

Big Sister Lan didn’t say a word as she also sent a wisp of her Great Moon Force.

The two wisps of energies of two different colours slowly converged together and quickly fused into a flash of white light…

Yang Kai stated, “I don’t mean merging your energies, but you two merging together?”

The Burning Light and Serene Glimmer both stared at him in a perplexed manner, “How do we merge?”

For a moment, Yang Kai didn’t know how to explain. All he could do was elaborate, “There is a Black Ink Battlefield just outside of the 3,000 Worlds, which is the front line where various Cave Heavens and Paradises resisted the Black Ink Clan. The Humans and Black Ink Clan have been fighting on that battlefield for countless years. Little Brother went to the Black Ink Battlefield more than 1,000 years ago, and about 500 years ago, the Human Race Army embarked on a grand crusade to the source of the Black Ink Clan, where I met an ancient Supreme Master and came to learn of some ancient secrets.”

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan didn’t interrupt him, rather both of them summoned a ball of energy that transformed into a mat. They sat down on their respective mats and stared at Yang Kai with great interest; their eyes were filled with anticipation as if they were waiting for him to continue.

It had always been just the two of them in the vast Chaotic Dead Territory, so it was quite boring for them. They rarely got to hear something interesting about the outside world, so naturally, the two were quite happy and excited.

Yang Kai shot a profound stare at them, “Some of these things may have something to do with you two.”

“En en,” Big Sister Lan repeatedly nodded while Big Brother Huang listened attentively.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel as if he was storytelling, with two loyal listeners sitting in front of him…

“Rumor has it that, when the Chaos separated into Heaven and Earth, the first Primordial Light appeared in the World, along with its counterpart, the Primordial Darkness …”

When he reiterated everything he had heard from Cang about the first ray of light and darkness, nothing was exciting about it, it was just going back in time.

Big Brother Huang clucked his tongue and rebuked, furrowing his brow, “Not interesting!”

Big Sister Lan also nodded in agreement.

Both of them felt that if they kept listening to Yang Kai’s nonsense anymore, they would be bored to death.

Yang Kai helplessly stated, “You two, it’s not a question of whether it is exciting or not, don’t you have any ideas?”

Big Brother Huang voiced his thoughts, “According to that old man named Cang, Mo is the manifestation of Primordial Darkness. If we want to eliminate him, do we need to find the world’s first light, the Primordial Light?”

“Yes!”

Big Sister Lan asked, “Do you suspect we are born from the Primordial Light?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Purifying Light is the nemesis of Black Ink Strength, and Purifying Light is the result of the fusion of your energies. I can’t help but think they are related.”

Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan glanced at each other before the former sighed, “I didn’t expect that after hiding for so many years, it would still be discovered.”

Big Sister Lan also sighed and added, “There’s nothing we can do if we’re discovered.”

“You two really are born from the Primordial Light?” Yang Kai was overjoyed.

Yang Kai’s eyes were filled with anticipation. If Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan were really born from the Primordial Light, then he had found a way to deal with Mo, the source of the Black Ink Clan. As long as he could solve the problem of the source of the Black Ink Clan, sooner or later, the entire Black Ink Clan would be wiped out. At that time, peace would return to the 3,000 Worlds.

“What should we do?” Brother Huang looked at Big Sister Lan.

“We can only do that,” Big Sister Lan replied solemnly.

Yang Kai watched as these two spoke in riddles. He was afraid that they would try to silence him; fortunately, the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer didn’t have such intentions. After exchanging a few words, the two of them stood up and, just like when they had killed the Royal Lord, their figures intertwined with each other, swirling in the void.

Yang Kai clenched his fists, his face filled with excitement and anticipation.

As expected, these two were born manifestations of the Universe’s Primordial Light, but somehow separated into two entities. However, the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer were seemingly able to fuse into one body at critical moments!

The Black Ink Clan crisis could be resolved with the Primordial Light! Even Mo, the source, could be eliminated!

The two small figures intertwined faster, the yellow and blue colours quickly fused together and transformed into a dazzling white light. Soon, Yang Kai saw the light cocoon again.

Earlier, the Royal Lord had been wrapped in this white cocoon of light, and when it shattered, the Royal Lord had simply vanished into nothingness.

Now that this light cocoon had reappeared, Yang Kai’s heart was rapidly pounding in excitement.

After a while, the light cocoon completely stabilized and floated in front of Yang Kai like a real cocoon.

Yang Kai called out a few times, but there was no response from Big Brother Huang or Big Sister Lan, so he gently stretched out his hand and touched the cocoon.

It was like a solid object, soft and supple, as if he was touching the skin of the most tender baby in the world.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but reach out and gently pinch it…

With a bang, the cocoon of light blew up into countless wisps of light. There was no aura. Nothing. As though it had never existed.

Yang Kai’s entire body went completely cold as if he had fallen into a frozen river before he panicked.

[Exploded!?]

[I pinched it casually, but it blew up!?]

[The cocoon of light exploded… did I just destroy the Primordial Light? Impossible…]

[Am I going to become the eternal sinner of the Human Race…?]

In the future, whenever someone mentioned Yang Kai’s name, they would say that it was he who had destroyed the light cocoon and destroyed the world’s Primordial Light, causing the Human Race to lose the means to deal with the Black Ink Clan.

In an instant, all kinds of thoughts flashed across Yang Kai’s mind like lightning, filling his chest with regret and indescribable pain, but the next moment, he was completely dumbstruck.

Two small figures appeared from behind these glowing specks of light. Big Brother Huang asked with a huge smile, “Are you surprised?”

Big Sister Lan excitedly asked, “Are you surprised?”

The two of them had a look of joy on their faces, like their prank had succeeded.

In that moment, filled with both relief and rage, the veins on Yang Kai’s forehead bulged and he unconsciously raised his fist and socked two naughty children over the head.
