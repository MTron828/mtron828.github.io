Yang Kai wanted to give the prey in front of him the illusion that he could still survive and escape.

Yang Kai’s cultivation may not be as high as Hei Yuan’s, but in terms of restorative abilities, Hei Yuan was far inferior to him. Trading injuries put Yang Kai at an advantage. Hei Yuan was destined to grow weaker over the course of this chase, and at the right time, perhaps Hei Yuan would die from exhaustion even without his intervention!

Nonetheless, Hei Yuan was not an idiot. He might not know what Yang Kai was planning, but he was still trying his very best to escape from his pursuit.

He repeatedly fled to the Fiefs of a few Feudal Lords, hoping to use the Black Ink Clansmen in those territories to stop Yang Kai.

However, the remaining Black Ink Clansmen in those Feudal Lord Fiefs were basically just the Low and High-Rank Clansmen with no Feudal Lords at all. How could they possibly stop Yang Kai?

They might delay him for a few breaths, but it was impossible for Hei Yuan to completely escape.

The chase continued across billions of kilometres and Hei Yuan’s injuries became more and more severe. He was riddled with wounds now, and not a single part of his body was left unbloodied. The fury and grievance boiling in his heart could not be expressed in words.

He was far stronger than Yang Kai in terms of raw power, but Yang Kai kept deliberately targeting his heavily injured Soul, rendering him unable to display the strength of a Territory Lord. Otherwise, why would he be in such a miserable condition? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Several times, Hei Yuan had an urge to turn around and fight to the death with Yang Kai, but in the end, he didn’t have the courage to do so. In his current state, he would not survive if he truly tried to fight to the death with Yang Kai. He wasn’t even sure that he could take Yang Kai down with him at this point.

His desire to survive pushed him to constantly flee, hoping for some miracle to happen which would help him overcome his current crisis.

Suddenly, a variable indeed appeared.

At some point, Hei Yuan suddenly felt a few familiar and powerful auras rapidly approaching him; obviously, they were other Territory Lords, existences like him! He could even ascertain the identities of these people from the auras.

Hei Yuan was overjoyed!

Currently, most of the Territory Lords in Mu Guang’s Royal Domain had basically led their respective armies to fight against the Humans from Yin-Yang Pass. Only a few Territory Lords remained to guard critical areas like the Royal City.

However, Hei Yuan also knew that the Territory Lords in the Royal City had been assisting the Royal Lord in besieging the Human Old Ancestor. Hei Yuan had been recuperating recently, so he had no idea about the current situation of the battlefield.

Since he could sense the auras of these Territory Lords appearing in the distance though, it meant that the battle between the Old Ancestor and the Royal Lord had come to an end. Regardless of what the final outcome of the battle was, these Territory Lords could provide some assistance at the front lines. And judging by the direction they were heading, it seemed that they were heading in that direction.

Running into them here was truly a stroke of luck.

Hei Yuan immediately flew in the direction of the Territory Lords without a moment of hesitation. So long as he met up with them, Yang Kai, who was chasing after him, would definitely have to act cautiously. He could even team up with the other Territory Lords and find a way to capture Yang Kai. With their help, even if Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he might not be able to escape.

But right then, a petite figure appeared in his sight all of a sudden. Hei Yuan suddenly felt so cold, it was like he had been frozen solid.

Yang Kai immediately became anxious.

He had originally planned to slowly exhaust Hei Yuan to death as, no matter how weakened, the latter was still a Territory Lord. If he was forced into a corner, Yang Kai had no idea what kind of methods Hei Yuan could pull out in desperation. However, the sudden appearances of other Territory Lords had thrown his plans off entirely. He could sense Mie Qiong and Qing Lei among these auras, and apart from those two, he also sensed the aura of another unfamiliar Territory Lord.

In other words, there were three Territory Lords up ahead!

[What are they doing here?] According to the information Yang Kai had received, a few Territory Lords were assisting Mu Guang in besieging the Old Ancestor. That was why, when he had severely wounded Hei Yuan’s Soul, Yang Kai had been able to continue acting freely within the Black Ink Clan’s territory. After all, there was no other Territory Lord present to stop him.

But now, three of them had appeared all of a sudden, [Has the battle between the Old Ancestor and the Royal Lord ended? Who won?]

Yang Kai had no time to give it another thought though as he only hesitated for a moment before immediately activating his Space Principles and disappearing like a ghost.

The next moment he appeared, he was not too far behind Hei Yuan. He promptly manipulated the local Space Principles to seal the surrounding space and thrust out his Azure Dragon Spear. At the same time, he fired a blast of his Spiritual Energy straight at Hei Yuan’s head while shouting, “Hei Yuan, suffer death!”

The three Territory Lords were still some distance away, so Yang Kai figured he still had enough time to escape after killing Hei Yuan.

Yang Kai was already prepared to defend against Hei Yuan’s final counterattack, but Hei Yuan appeared as if he was completely oblivious to the danger even when this fearsome spear thrust was upon him. Rather, all his attention was focused on something in front of him.

Suddenly, a glimmer of cold light flashed by as a petite figure, holding a longsword, flew past Hei Yuan. The longsword was devoid of even a stain of black blood and just so happened to collide with Yang Kai’s spear.

Yang Kai’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets at the sight of this figure and he frantically retracted his spear, but the powerful impact still caused his vitality to tumble in his chest.

The petite figure rushed to Yang Kai and asked in surprise, “Why are you here?”

Yang Kai was also stunned as he asked in a dumbfounded voice, “Old Ancestor?”

He had not expected to run into the Yin-Yang Pass Old Ancestor here. Yang Kai had been wondering about the battle between the Old Ancestor and the Royal Lord when he felt the auras of Mie Qiong and the other Territory Lords up ahead. Nonetheless, it never crossed his mind that the Old Ancestor would suddenly appear before him the next moment.

[Does this mean that the Old Ancestor was fighting Mu Guang for an entire half a year? Astonishing!]

However, now was obviously not the time to reminisce about such things. The three Territory Lords behind the Old Ancestor were relentlessly chasing after her and would be here soon. So, after the Old Ancestor finished asking, she mustered her World Force, wrapped Yang Kai in it, and shouted, “Let’s get out of here first!”

Yang Kai could only allow himself to be dragged along by the Old Ancestor, flying forward as fast as lightning.

While escaping, he took a quick look back and saw Hei Yuan’s huge body collapse into countless pieces all of a sudden.

Apparently, in the brief moment the Old Ancestor passed him by, she had ruthlessly attacked him.

Hei Yuan was already on his last legs and had no strength to take on an attack from an Old Ancestor. A load had been taken off Yang Kai’s mind when he saw this.

Hei Yuan might not have died at his hands, but in the end he didn’t escape.

“Didn’t I tell you to meet up with the Army? Why are you still here?” The Old Ancestor curiously asked as she led Yang Kai away.

“You might be young, but your courage isn’t small,” the Old Ancestor indifferently stated. Who knows whether she was mocking him or praising him. She then suddenly asked, “Were you the one who injured that guy?”

“Hei Yuan?” Yang Kai nodded, “Yes, it was me.”

“No wonder he didn’t have any strength to resist my attack,” the Old Ancestor instantly understood, “If he was at his peak, I might not have been able to kill him in my current state.”

Yang Kai was taken aback after hearing this and immediately took a closer look at the Old Ancestor’s face, “Are you injured?”

The Old Ancestor gloomily nodded, “My injuries aren’t light.” But the next moment, she suddenly sneered, “Don’t worry, that old hag’s injuries are even worse, she’s currently unconscious inside her Black Ink Nest.”

Yang Kai’s heart was shaken. He knew that the ‘old hag’ she was referring to should be Mu Guang.

Both of them had fought countless times since they had taken command of this war zone, so a deep blood feud had already been forged between the two. Both were Supreme Masters of their respective Race and they had always been on par with each other. Since the Old Ancestor had suffered heavy injuries, Mu Guang would not have fared any better either.

Otherwise, not just these Territory Lords would be chasing after the Old Ancestor.

Just now, Yang Kai had been wondering why someone like the Old Ancestor was even being chased by a few Territory Lords, but now he knew the answer. Apparently, her injuries were quite serious.

However, there was one thing that piqued Yang Kai’s curiosity, “Old Ancestor, those Territory Lords don’t seem to be injured at all.”

The Old Ancestor pursed her lips in disdain, “These cowards were just hovering around in the background while I was fighting with that old hag. They didn’t dare to interfere, so why would they be injured? However, when I broke through the encirclement, I killed one of them; otherwise, the ones chasing after me would have been four Territory Lords. Heh heh, I’m pretty awesome, aren’t I?”

Saying so, she even winked at Yang Kai.

At that moment, Yang Kai couldn’t remain calm and the corners of his mouth twitched as he praised, “Old Ancestor is truly too amazing and awesome, your might is simply boundless!”

The Old Ancestor seemed to be quite happy to hear the praise, no matter how obviously forced it was. Quickly composing herself though, she asked, “I’m quite curious, how did you injure a Territory Lord to the point you could chase him down? You’re only in the Seventh Order, right?”

If all the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were so powerful, the Black Ink Clan would have long been wiped out.

Yang Kai explained, “Hei Yuan dug his own grave.”

Afterwards, he briefly explained what he had done so far and how Hei Yuan had worked together with many others to set up a trap, waiting for Yang Kai to fall into it. In the end, Hei Yuan only lifted a rock just to drop it on his own foot. He failed to do anything to Yang Kai’s consciousness in that strange space and instead was badly wounded. With the help of the compass refined by Wang Si Bo, Yang Kai coincidentally found Hei Yuan’s location and engaged in a fierce battle with him before pursuing him.

The Old Ancestor’s eyes lit up as she listened, “Their Black Ink Nests actually have such a connection?”

“Did Old Ancestor really not know?”

The Old Ancestor explained, shaking her head, “The Human Race actually knows very little about the Black Ink Clan. Because of the Black Ink Strength, we are unable to explore the depths of the Black Ink Clan’s territory, let alone their Black Ink Nests. What’s more, Black Ink Nests are the foundation of the Black Ink Clan, so they naturally do not reveal secrets about them. If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t have been able to obtain this intel at all.”

Having said so, a solemn look appeared on her face before she continued, “According to what you said, each Black Ink Nest can be counted as a sub-nest of a higher-grade Black Ink Nest. If a Territory Lord’s Black Ink Nest is destroyed, all of its sub-nest will wither as well. If that old hag’s Black Ink Nest were destroyed, wouldn’t all of the Territory Lord Black Ink Nests also wither, thereby affecting all the Feudal Lord Black Ink Nests as well?”

Yang Kai agreed with a nod, “That should be the case.”
