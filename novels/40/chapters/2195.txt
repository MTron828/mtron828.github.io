A man surnamed Chang nodded, “Yes, this is everything!”

“Okay, then you can pack your things and get out!” Yang Kai waved at him.

“Ah...” The man surnamed Chang’s face changed as he cried out, “Brother Yang, please take another...”

“Out, out!” Yang Kai waved his hand again, stirring the Space Principles to directly teleport this person outside before he shouted, “Next!”

After the man came back to his senses, he found that he was already standing far away from Yang Kai and couldn’t help feeling annoyed. Stomping his foot, he cursed himself for failing to grasp this great opportunity, and also Yang Kai for being so ruthless...

On the contrary, the others around him were clearly taking pleasure in his misfortune...

However, Wu Chang, Xiao Chen, and the other Masters wore solemn expressions at this moment.

Because they saw what Yang Kai had just done and could tell that his proficiency in the Dao of Space was at an astonishing level!

Not only could he teleport himself, but he could even teleport others away!

Of course, the premise was surely that the other person was inside the special shattered space Yang Kai had created, but even so, it was still a shocking display of skill.

How could a trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator possibly comprehend the esoteric Dao of Space to such an extent?

With such ability, who in the Dao Source Realm could kill him?

Just as everyone’s expressions fluctuated, another person passed through the gap and walked up to Yang Kai.

It was a woman this time and she wore no markings to identify which force she belonged to, but that did nothing to hide her enchanting looks and glamorous dress. A deep cut on her robes exposed a large amount of snow-white skin and each step she took caused her great peaks to ripple intoxicatingly, dizzying and dazzling those who saw...

She walked up to Yang Kai and smiled charmingly, not hurrying to bring out her treasures to exchange with Yang Kai and instead softly whispering, “Little Brother, Big Sister didn’t have many gains in this place, what should she do to move you?”

Yang Kai looked up at her, his eyes fixing on her chest as he grinned meaningfully, “What do you want to do?”

“I don’t know, so I asked you...” She whispered in response, slowly squatting down while ‘accidentally’ exposing more of her spring scenery.

“Girl, are you trying to seduce me...” Yang Kai took a deep breath and reached out to hold the woman’s delicate, silky hand. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Nonsense!” The woman glared at Yang Kai angrily, but she didn’t rush to take her hand back. Instead, she showed a shy expression that could tickle the hearts of any man.

At the same time, a faint scent wafted from this woman’s tender body, one that was quite weak but seemed to have some kind of magical effect, causing the blood of men around her to boil and their minds to numb.

“Shameless!” Lan Xun spurned from a long distance away.

“Utterly shameless!” Murong Xiao Xiao nodded in agreement.

“How improper!” Xia Sheng gritted his teeth, his eyes glowing with red light as he stared at Yang Kai and spat indignantly, “It’s... too enviable!”

“Little Brother...” The woman seemed to want to use her unique charms to gain some advantage, but as soon as these words were spoken, her face changed drastically and she jumped back from Yang Kai, a vigilant and angry look on her face.

Yang Kai on the other hand was now holding a Space Ring in his hand, releasing his Divine Sense to check its content.

As soon as the woman lowered her head, her pretty face became even uglier as she found that the Space Ring she had been wearing had disappeared at some point. Obviously, she hadn’t even noticed when Yang Kai had snatched it from her.

“As I thought, there’s nothing good!” After Yang Kai muttered, he threw the Space Ring back to the woman.

The woman caught it as her chest heaved up and down, gritting her teeth as she snapped, “You...”

“Hmm, you have quite some unique undergarments inside though. They’re quite fascinating all on their own, but... perhaps we should find some time to sit down together and study them...” Yang Kai looked at the woman and said with a smile.

“Who would want to study anything with you, you bastard! Bastard, bastard, bastard!” The woman blushed, stomped her foot, turned around, and rushed out. Feeling the ridiculing eyes of everyone fixed on her, she didn’t want to remain even a moment longer and hurriedly flew towards the exit.

Yang Kai scratched his nose and muttered lightly, “It’s fine if you don’t want to discuss things, but there’s no need to curse me like that.”

He had an innocent expression on his face, but soon he cracked his neck and shouted, “Next!”

Immediately another person rushed in.

Time flew by, and half an hour soon passed...

The number of people who had already tried to exchange with Yang Kai for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill had surpassed thirty, but even until this moment, no one had succeeded.

At first, everyone was worried about being too late to obtain any benefits, but now it seemed those worries were superfluous because whatever Yang Kai wanted was surely extremely rare. Otherwise, there would have been at least someone by now who had won him over.

After realizing this, the rest of the cultivators weren’t so hurried.

Everyone was now just secretly calculating what they should take out to satisfy Yang Kai’s appetite in exchange for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

Although Yang Kai had said before that he wanted something they had harvested from the Four Seasons Realm, everyone present was a Dao Source Realm Master, so how could their Space Rings be lacking good things? Yang Kai shouldn’t be able to tell where those things came from.

As such, the later cultivators not only took out all their gains from the Four Seasons Realm but also selectively took out precious items from their Space Rings, hoping to catch Yang Kai’s eye.

The value of these items was not low, and some of them even made Yang Kai’s eyes shine, but he still resisted the urge to trade for them.

Because the number of Extraordinary Treasure Pills he possessed was truly small, and he needed them to exchange for what he needed most!

The Tribulation Fruit!

Since deciding to keep all the Extraordinary Treasure Pills for himself, Yang Kai was prepared to exchange them first and foremost for the Tribulation Fruit, otherwise, he would not have made such a strange request to have everyone bring out their harvests from the Four Seasons Realm!

Earlier, although he found the Tribulation Fruit’s tree in the Realm of Winter, the spirit fruit itself had already been picked.

The cultivators that had entered the Four Seasons Realm were all basically gathered here now, so if nothing unexpected happened, the Tribulation Fruit would be in the hands of someone here!

In order to obtain an Extraordinary Treasure Pill from Yang Kai, no one would conceal the treasures they had acquired...

In other words, the Tribulation Fruit would appear in front of Yang Kai sooner or later, he just needed to wait patiently!

“Brother Yang, please look at these things and see if there is anything you want.”

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, a woman walked up to him and brought out a number of items from her Space Ring for him to see.

Yang Kai collected himself and scanned the items.

He had done this many times, and always ended up disappointed, but this time...

“Hm?” Yang Kai raised his brow as he stared straight at a certain item.

It was not the Tribulation Fruit, but rather something else he was quite concerned about.

After seeing this thing, one of his previous guesses had partially been confirmed.

Yang Kai was deeply surprised inside, but he maintained an indifferent expression on his face and quickly turned his gaze away to examine the other objects the woman had taken out.

There were a dozen spirit medicines that although rare, weren’t too precious. There were also eight Monster Beast Cores of good quality, but their grade wasn’t very high. Lastly, there was a bright red stone with strange patterns on its surface that if one used their Divine Sense to investigate, they would feel a strong heat hidden inside of.

Yang Kai immediately had an idea and as he looked at the red stone, exclaimed, “A Fire Spirit Stone!”

The woman was taken aback as she involuntarily stepped back several steps before stabilizing her figure and looking at Yang Kai with joy, “Do you need this?”

She didn’t have much hope when she came here to trade with Yang Kai; after all, before her, more than thirty people had come and gone without succeeding.

Without knowing what Yang Kai was looking for, the initiative for this kind of transaction lay completely in his hands. Whether other people could exchange for an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, they could only count on their luck.

But what she didn’t expect was that Yang Kai showed great interest in the strange stone she had picked up by chance, giving her a glimmering of hope!

If things went well, she would have a chance to obtain an Extraordinary Treasure Pill!

Outside, the onlookers couldn’t help looking shocked.

This wasn’t a surprise though as this was the first time Yang Kai had shown any interest. The people who had gone in to exchange with him before only evoked looks of disappointment and impatience.

For a moment, everyone was curious and wanted to see what the woman had taken out which could arouse Yang Kai’s interest.

But no one was able to see anything...

Under the influence of the swirling Space Principles, the region around Yang Kai was filled with innumerable Void Cracks, making it impossible for anyone to send their Divine Sense in to probe what was happening...

Yang Kai looked up at the woman and found that she was quite sweet and lovely, with a round flushed face and a petite, exquisite figure. Her cultivation wasn’t too high, only Second-Order Dao Source Realm, and it was unclear which Sect she belonged to.

Perhaps because of Yang Kai’s shameless interaction with the other woman before, this round-faced woman couldn’t help feeling a little nervous and wary when she saw him staring at her.

She hurriedly explained, “This is something I found accidentally in the Realm of Summer...”

“This is a good thing!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, “I do have some interest.”

“Really?” The round-faced woman showed a look of pleasant surprise, “Then can we...”

“No!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Ah...” The round-faced woman immediately showed a disappointed expression.

“Yang Kai, know your limits!” For some reason, Luo Yuan suddenly shouted from outside, seemingly very dissatisfied with Yang Kai’s attitude.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai gave him a blank look, “don’t call out for no reason, just mind your own damn business!”
