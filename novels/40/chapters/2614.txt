“Lady Feng, didn’t you say that you can’t act freely in a Human Sect? Then, is it okay to kill the grandson of a Great Elder?” Yang Kai glanced at Luan Feng, whose face was completely cold at the moment.

Luan Feng grit her teeth and justified herself, “He was trying to profane this Queen! Should this Queen have just let him touch me?”

After a pause, she angrily stated, “Sir Yang, you aren’t a good person either!”

“Why…” Yang Kai was speechless, “How is this related to me? He was the one being rude to you, not me.”

Luan Feng glared at him and asked, “Why did you dodge just now?”

Yang Kai could have stopped everything from happening, but he had actually stepped aside, making Luan Feng pretty angry. Had Yang Kai not stepped aside, she would not have killed the opposite party in anger.

“Ah… ahaha…” Yang Kai forced a laugh before hurriedly justifying, “It was an instinctive reaction, an instinctive reaction. He was just a piece of trash, Lady Feng doesn’t need to pay his death any mind.”

Luan Feng maintained the cold look on her face; apparently, she cared about it a little, even suspecting that Yang Kai had acted deliberately just now to drag her into this mess. But what could she do now? She had already killed the Great Elder’s grandson in anger, forming an enmity with the Netherworld Sect.

“Do… do you know who he is?” On the other side, the woman, who had been vomiting all the while, had finally regained her calm and accepted the fact that the Great Elder’s grandson had tragically died before her. Nonetheless, she couldn’t help but stare at the trio in shock.

[These three are too bold! They killed the Great Elder’s grandson as if it was nothing, and not only are they not escaping now, but are instead standing around chatting.]

“I heard him loud and clear when he introduced himself, your Great Elder’s grandson, right?” Yang Kai smilingly looked at the woman.

“You…” The woman was completely stunned. Her sweet and sexy eyes that were filled with spring a moment ago were now filled with shock at this moment. She didn’t know what to say, but one thing she knew for certain was that the Great Elder would not let them go. The Great Elder had few family members and only one grandson in his third generation. Unfortunately, this young man was ignorant and incompetent while his aptitude was trash, resulting in him becoming a wastrel that spent all his time on women and wine.

Many Senior and Junior Sisters in the Sect had fallen prey to his wicked hands. Some had sent themselves into his arms willingly while others had been forced to obey him.

Because he was the Great Elder’s grandson, he had abundant cultivation resources in his hands though, so many Senior and Junior Sisters were interested in him and proactively undressed just to get useful benefits from him. She belonged to this category. As for those who were forced, they couldn’t get their revenge as he was under the Great Elder’s asylum.

However, this grandson was not a complete fool and only targeted girls without strong backgrounds in the Sect, those who have no way to seek justice for themselves. As for those with higher status, he never used force but instead lured them in with benefits.

That was also how she was coaxed into the act.

But how could she have ever thought that after sacrificing her innocence, not only would she not get the slightest benefit, but she would have to watch him die as well?

[Even though his end was guaranteed to be bad eventually, now I have to worry about being implicated…]

Thinking of the Great Elder’s coming anger, the woman couldn’t help but shudder as her face instantly went pale.

“Don’t worry,” Yang Kai gently comforted the girl, “We won’t do anything to you.”

“What do you want then?” The woman asked in a tearful voice.

“Where is your Sect Master, Fu Bo?” Yang Kai asked with a smile, but to that woman, that amiable and harmless smile seemed more terrifying than the devil’s malicious grin itself.

She subconsciously pointed in a direction, blurting, “Sect Master cultivates on that peak.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai looked in the direction she pointed before thanking her with a light nod, “Many thanks!”

Having offered proper respect, he flew towards the peak along with Ji Yao and Luan Feng, leaving the Netherworld Sect woman hopelessly standing there. Only after a long time did this woman come to her senses before heading towards another peak in a hurry.

She had to immediately report what just happened to the Great Elder, otherwise, she would definitely die if he were to investigate things himself.

The peak of the mountain was rich in Yin Qi. Also, there appeared to be an enormous Spirit Array surrounding the peak, preventing the near-tangible Yin Qi from leaking out.

More importantly, faint ghastly cries and wails could be heard coming from inside the dense Yin Qi field, giving the listeners a jittery feeling.

The moment Yang Kai’s trio arrived here, a sudden furious shout came from inside, “Who dares intrude here!?”

“Fu Bo?” Yang Kai asked back, raising his brow.

“Bold Junior! You dare call this King by name!? You court death!” The voice called out again.

“It looks like you are indeed Fu Bo,” Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile before taking a step forward, directly disappearing into the Yin Qi. Ji Yao and Luan Feng hurriedly followed after him.

The Yin Qi covering the top of the mountain seemed to be only used for cultivation and didn’t have any defensive or offensive properties. Yang Kai thus came all the way in with Ji Yao and Luan Feng before everything cleared up before their eyes.

A palace appeared before the trio.

Yang Kai promptly spread out his Divine Sense and immediately found a fearsome presence inside the palace.

Stepping inside the palace, he saw a stalwart man standing there, his eyes gazing towards them, his expression gloomy and filled with anger.

In any case, his Netherworld Sect was a top Sect in the Eastern Territory. Even considering the entire Star Boundary, it was still among the very strongest, yet today, someone actually intruded into his private cultivation sanctuary. Fu Bo was naturally quite angered.

Scanning Yang Kai with his Divine Sense and discovering that he was just a First-Order Emperor, Fu Bo grew angrier.

But regardless of his personal feelings, he was still a Sect Master and his experience and insight were far better than an ordinary person’s. Seeing Yang Kai remain so calm and composed, without a hint of nervousness, Fu Bo subconsciously felt that Yang Kai wasn’t some insignificant character. Otherwise, how would he dare to call him by his name and even break into this place?

“Who are you? Why did you intrude into my Netherworld Sect?” Fu Bo asked with a cold snort.

Yang Kai glanced around before replying with a slight smile, “This Young Master’s name is Yang Kai, I wonder if Sect Master Fu had ever heard of it?”

“Yang Kai?” Fu Bo furrowed his brow, “It seems familiar…”

After giving it some quick thought, his face changed as he shouted, “Are you that enemy of Le Sheng’s?”

Yin Le Sheng was his Legacy Disciple, one that Fu Bo had very high hopes for. Yin Le Sheng hadn’t hidden anything that had happened in the Shattered Star Sea from him after returning to the Sect, so naturally he had mentioned Yang Kai more than once.

In his opinion, this was just a grudge between two Juniors, so Fu Bo didn’t attach that much importance to it. He only asked Yin Le Sheng to focus on cultivation and avenge himself in the future.

However, Yin Le Sheng was eager to have his revenge as quickly as possible, so after spending some time in the Netherworld Sect to stabilize his new Emperor Realm cultivation, he encouraged Hua Fei Chen to travel to the Ancient Wild Lands with him to deal with Yang Kai. After he learned of this, Fu Bo immediately sent Vice Sect Master, Wu Yuan Zheng, to lead some disciples to pick up Yin Le Sheng and prevent any mishap from befalling him in the dangerous Ancient Lands.

But he didn’t expect the little brat named Yang Kai would actually run over here before his disciple and Vice Sect Master even returned.

“It seems Sect Master Fu does know about this Young Master,” Yang Kai meaningfully grinned before nodding, “That will make things much easier.”

Fu Bu turned a deaf ear to Yang Kai’s mutterings and slowly asked with a dissatisfied look on his face, “As far as this King knows, Le Sheng has gone looking for you. As you travelled here, did you see this King’s good-for-nothing disciple?”

“I indeed met him,” Yang Kai replied with a smile, “There was also a guy named Hua Fei Chen with him. He seemed to be the Elder of your noble Sect!”

Fu Bo’s heart immediately hit rock bottom after hearing this and he immediately asked sharply, “Where are they?”

Yang Kai replied, pursing his lips into a smile, “Sect Master Fu is an intelligent man. Since they went looking to trouble this Young Master, and this Young Master has now appeared here unscathed, what do you think their ends would be? Sect Master Fu also said that your disciple is a ‘good-for-nothing’. This Young Master showed great compassion and helped clean your house of such trash. No need to thank me!”

Immediately, Fu Bo’s vitality rolled as he shouted in anger, “That’s impossible!”

Yang Kai coldly stated, “Wu Yuan Zheng said the same thing before his death too!”

“What!?” Fu Bo was truly shaken this time, “Vice Sect Master Wu is dead too?”

After a while, Fu Bo calmed down and rebuffed with a light snort, “Brat, you sure know how to spout nonsense; this King was almost fooled by you. With your pitiful cultivation, even Elder Hua could easily finish you off, so how could you have killed Vice Sect Master Wu? Laughable!”

Yang Kai indifferently replied, “Indeed, this Young Master cannot kill Wu Yuan Zheng, but I never said I killed him. The one who killed him was… someone else!”

Fu Bo furrowed his brow, feeling that Yang Kai wasn’t lying. His heart skipped a beat at that moment as he promptly spread his Divine Sense again, scanning the two women by Yang Kai’s side.

[The cultivation of the girl with the cold aura isn’t bad, actually Second-Order Emperor Realm!] Fu Bo was shocked by this revelation.

Just when he wanted to use his Divine Sense to scan Luan Feng though, he suddenly felt a fearsome pressure emanate from her, frightening him so greatly that he actually retreated a few steps before asking in shock, “Who is Your Excellency?”

Only now did he suddenly discover the unfathomable nature of this beautiful woman.

The woman standing there gave him the feeling of facing a Great Emperor! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As the Netherworld Sect’s Sect Master, it wasn’t like Fu Bo had never met a Great Emperor before. The Serene Soul Great Emperor made his base in the Eastern Territory, so Fu Bo had the good fortune to meet him more than once.

Every time Fu Bo had gone to Serene Soul Palace to meet the Great Emperor though, he would feel a similar pressure to the one he was feeling right now. This was a deeply unsettling sensation, like the other party could take his life just by raising his hand.

[This young man is actually accompanied by a Great Emperor!? What is his identity?]

Fu Bo was now even more curious about the identity of the beautiful woman.

Luan Feng just let out a light snort, having no intention of introducing herself.

After all, as a Divine Spirit, she shouldn’t have come to the Human Sect and didn’t want to reveal her identity unless it was absolutely necessary.

“Sect Master Fu believes me now?” Yang Kai looked at Fu Bo, maintaining a calm and composed look.

Fu Bo nervously gulped, staring at Luan Feng in fear. He then looked at Yang Kai and realized that this boy was the one doing all the talking and replied with a nod, “If this Madam took action, Wu Yuan Zheng would not have any chance to survive.”

Wu Yuan Zheng was dead, so Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen couldn’t be alive either.

He was totally unaware that Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen were killed by Yang Kai and it had nothing to do with Luan Feng.

Sighing, Fu Bo dejectedly asked, “Since my good-for-nothing disciple had eyes but failed to see, provoking Your Excellency, then he is guilty of death! It’s just that… it was a personal feud between Your Excellency and my disciple, and he has already been punished. I wonder why Your Excellency has come to my Netherworld Sect now?”
