Jiao Yi tried his best to sell the idea, “We found a place with a large amount of Grey Feather Corals by chance five years ago, but it was protected by a Sea Beast back then, so we weren’t able to get it in the end. But based on Big Sister’s observations at the time, the Sea Beast was close to the end of its lifespan and it would definitely be dead within five years. In other words, we’ll be able to mine the Grey Feather Coral there to our heart’s content now, and once we do, we won’t have to go out to sea for at least a year with the harvest.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “My Junior Sister and I won’t be participating.”

He wasn’t short of Source Crystals in the slightest, so naturally, he had no wish to mine this Great Feather Coral. No matter what extravagant and colourful words Jiao Yi could bring up, Yang Kai still wouldn’t be moved.

Seeing this, Jiao Yi could not force him either and just felt that Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun would learn just how precious Grey Feather Coral was once they’ve lived here for a year or two. When that time came, he might not even need to try and persuade them and the two would join themselves.

“By the way, how long will it take before you return from this trip?” Yang Kai asked.

Jiao Yi said, “We are about three days away from our destination, then it’ll take another two or three days to mine the coral. As for our return trip... It’ll take at least a month before we can reach Clear Sky Island.”

“That long?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

Jiao Yi smiled bitterly, “Most of the materials around Clear Sky Island have already been dug up and harvested. If we want the good stuff, we can only go further away. The risks are proportional to the gains.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Then I wish you all success.”

When he heard him say that, Jiao Yi also stood up tactfully, “Then, I won’t disturb your cultivation any longer. If there’s anything you need, just come and look for Old Jiao.”

“Alright.”

When Jiao Yi reached the door, he suddenly turned back, “By the way, once the two of you arrive at Clear Sky City, you must find a way to apply for an Identity Token, otherwise you won’t be able to enter the city. However, if you apply for an Identity Token, you’ll be exposed as newcomers. Why don’t I go and tell Big Sister and she’ll find a way to cover for you two? Even though we aren’t attached to any of the big forces, Big Sister is well-connected and has a wide range of contacts. She may be able to get it done.”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and nodded, “Then I’ll offer my thanks in advance, Brother Jiao.”

Jiao Yi smiled, “I’ll let you know if there’s any news.”

After Jiao Yi left, Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun looked at each other, both of them able to see the worry in each other’s eyes. This damned place was able to trap even Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, so it was clear how little chance there was for them to get out. Moreover, Jiao Yi and his group clearly had no idea how to leave either, so they weren’t able to get any information from them.

The only thing they could do now was to head to Clear Sky Island first before making any plans.

The ship sailed for four days before suddenly coming to a stop.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and could feel that the cultivators on the ship had all come up to the deck, sleeves rolled up and filled with energy. It seemed like they had arrived at their destination and everyone was getting ready to go down into the sea to mine the Grey Feather Coral.

Yang Kai didn’t go and bother them, but on the contrary, Jiao Yi came to bother him. He came over again to ask if Yang Kai wanted to join them and head down to the sea or not.

After Yang Kai refused him politely, Jiao Yi didn’t press him anymore.

A short while later, most of the people on board jumped off the deck and disappeared into the sea.

Just as Jiao Yi said before, the powerful Sea Beast protecting the Grey Feather Coral had died, so Ling Yin Qin and her crew were very successful in their mission.

Cultivators were constantly coming in and out of the water, all of them looking ecstatic. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Four days later, all the cultivators returned from the sea and nobody went down anymore.

Yang Kai did not observe their movements too carefully, but when he probed the deck occasionally, he was able to hear some of their conversations. From the bits and pieces of chatter he overheard, Yang Kai learned that they were in fact able to score a huge harvest, even more than Ling Yin Qin had expected.

The crew suffered no casualties and gained so much without any effort just by going to sea, so the faces of the crew members were filled with smiles. Even the usually icy Ling Yin Qin had exposed a rare smile.

About half a day later, the ship turned in a different direction and set sail. It seemed they were on their way back.

Yang Kai also put down the last of his worries. He was really afraid that Ling Yin Qin and her ship would encounter difficulties at sea. If that happened, then there would be no one to bring them to Clear Sky Island.

Everything was going well at the moment, and naturally, this was what Yang Kai hoped to see.

There were peaceful days ahead. Yang Kai and Liu Xian Yun were both holed up in their room and did not come out. Ling Yin Qin seemed satisfied with their cooperation and low-key behaviour, so she did not bother them either. On the other hand, Jiao Yi would bring them food and drinks occasionally.

Seven days later, the expression on Yang Kai’s face, who was meditating, suddenly changed and he opened his eyes.

Then, he released his Divine Sense and poured it into the Sealed World Bead to communicate with his Embodiment.

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked. He had no idea why, but the Embodiment suddenly messaged him and he appeared to be in a fluster.

“Ruo Xi, that girl... she’s breaking through,” the Embodiment responded immediately.

“Ruo Xi is breaking through?” Yang Kai raised a brow, “Isn’t that a good thing?”

“How is it good!?” The Embodiment shouted.

Yang Kai also suddenly realized something and his face changed, “Dao Source Realm?”

He remembered that Zhang Ruo Xi had already reached the Third-Order Origin King Realm, which meant if she needed to break through, it would be to the Dao Source Realm!

“That’s right. I don’t know what happened with that girl, but the speed that she’s advancing is too frightening! How long has it been and she’s already breaking through to the Dao Source Realm.”

Yang Kai instantly understood the severity of the problem and immediately teleported into the Small Sealed World.

Somewhere in the Small Sealed World, Zhang Ruo Xi was sitting down cross-legged as World Energy circulated around her body, Saint Qi flowing like a river, so much so that one could actually hear it.

She clearly appeared on the verge of a breakthrough.

If this was the outside world, then there would be no problem for her to make a breakthrough like this.

However, she was currently inside the Sealed World Bead where the World Principles were not perfect. It was not an issue for Zhang Ruo Xi to cultivate here normally, but breaking through to the next Great Realm involved a World Energy Baptism. Comprehending Principle Strength while breaking through was not possible in this Small Sealed World.

In other words, it was impossible for Zhang Ruo Xi to break through to the Dao Source Realm in the Sealed World Bead. If she was left alone, she would only fail.

Once she failed, Zhang Ruo Xi’s path on the Martial Dao would come to an end, and she may even be hit by backlash and perish.

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly.

It was a vast sea outside, and the environment of this Solitary Void Sealed World was so bizarre that he had no idea if Zhang Ruo Xi would be able to break through if she were brought out.

Even if he took her outside, where would they go for her to break through?

Next to Zhang Ruo Si, Hua Qing Si and Liu Yan were both standing there with grave expressions. When they noticed Yang Kai’s arrival, both of them hurried over.

“How long has this been going on?” Yang Kai asked.

“It just began,” Hua Qing Si responded, “But looking at her, I don’t think she can suppress it any longer. If she forcefully restrains herself any more, it will damage her foundation.”

“Master, what should we do now?” Liu Yan had no idea what to do at all. She knew what kind of situation Yang Kai was in currently and really couldn’t think of how they were going to help Zhang Ruo Xi with her current predicament.

“Watch over her for a while, I’ll think of a plan.” After he said that, Yang Kai left the Sealed World Bead.

Zhang Ruo Xi had just perceived the opportunity to break through, so she could probably hold on for a while longer, but it will be impossible to do so for too long. A solution had to be found before then.

Inside the compartment, Yang Kai’s figure reappeared and then flew straight out.

Liu Xian Yun was befuddled, having no idea what Yang Kai was in such a hurry to do, so she quickly followed after him.

Ling Yin Qin was currently cultivating inside her private cabin. It was really unexpected for them to have gained such a large harvest during this trip, so they would be able to stay home for at least two or three years before they had to come out to sea again, which put her in a rather good mood.

While she was thinking about which great force she should sell the Grey Feather Coral to when they returned, her door was suddenly opened with a bang.

Ling Yin Qin was shocked and stood up immediately, shouting, “Who’s there!”

She was the captain of this ship, so there wasn’t anyone on board who dared to rush in without even greeting her, so Ling Yin Qin’s first reaction was that it must be an enemy.

But when she got a good look at who it was that entered, Ling Yin Qin gritted her teeth and snapped, “What are you doing?!”

She was naturally angered. She was only glad that she wasn’t comprehending some Secret Art or Secret Technique, otherwise, this disturbance by Yang Kai would have rendered her efforts meaningless.

This person had been quiet since he came aboard her ship, and Ling Yin Qin had a good impression of him, but now, the sight of him disgusted her.

Yang Kai also knew that he had been too abrupt, but this matter concerned Zhang Ruo Xi’s life and future, so he could only cup his fists and say, “Big Sister Ling, is it? I have an urgent matter so I hope you can forgive me.”

Ling Yin Qin’s name was something he learned from hearing the conversations of the other crew members on the ship.

“What happened?”

There was a cry of alarm from outside. Apparently, the crew had been attracted by the noise of Yang Kai hurling the door open.

They all saw Yang Kai standing outside with Ling Yin Qin’s face covered in fury. All of them were shocked. Jiao Yi, who was standing among them, blinked his eyes and said, “Brother Yang, why did you barge into our Big Sister’s room?”

“You little brat, you’re not coveting the beauty of our Big Sister and deciding to take her by force, are you?”

“What? Seriously? You bastard, how dare you!”

“You’re courting death, you little brat! You have a Junior Sister and you’re still not satisfied? You even dared to eye our Big Sister!? See if I don’t cripple you today!”

The group of people outside became all stirred up and shouted madly, making the scene quite lively.

Yang Kai was speechless at their reaction, but still quickly cupped his fists to Ling Yin Qin, “This one really does have an urgent matter to deal with, so please forgive me, Big Sister Ling!”

Ling Yin Qin glared at Yang Kai with gritted teeth. Even though it was hard to dispel her anger, his expression did not seem fake, so she coldly snorted and asked, “What matter is so urgent that you can’t even knock? Didn’t your mother teach you anything about manners?”

Yang Kai did not dare to talk back after being reprimanded like this either and could only say, “I wish to ask Big Sister Ling’s advice. If one needs to make a breakthrough here, how should they go about it?”

“A breakthrough?” Upon hearing this, Ling Yin Qin’s face changed, “Breaking through to a new Great Realm?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded.

When she heard this, Ling Yin Qin’s mind buzzed for a moment and her face filled with shock.

She naturally thought that Yang Kai needed to break through.

Yang Kai was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, so if he broke through, wouldn’t that mean advancing to the Emperor Realm?
