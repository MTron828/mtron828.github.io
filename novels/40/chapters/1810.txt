More than a month later, Yang Kai looked at a big plot of land in front of him with a smile on his face. At the centre of this plot was the Immortal Tree, and, he had planted many types of spirit grass and spirit medicines around it.

Regardless of the previous state of these herbs, all of them were now thriving under the nourishment of the Immortal Tree’s overflowing vitality.

Within a radius of a hundred kilometres, an expansive Medicine Garden had been formed.

“It seems that if I collect anything in the future, I can transplant it here and simply pick it when I want to use it. En, this way, the medicinal efficacies of all those herbs can be preserved to the greatest extent,” Yang Kai muttered happily.

Next, he sprinkled countless Saint Crystals around before crushing them to fill the surrounding space with rich World Energy.

Although the vitality of the Immortal Tree was enough to fill the Small Sealed World, the spirit grasses he had just planted required more World Energy to grow.

Saint Crystals consumed here in the future would probably become a big expense.

After completing all this, Yang Kai took the time to investigate the situation of the floating continent.

During this period, he had inspected the floating continent multiple times and found that his Embodiment’s refining was progressing extremely smoothly. Now the entire floating continent had shrunk to half its original size and looked like a massive stone giant lying down in the void, its figure giving off a very strong sense of oppression.

However, the refinement seemed to be becoming more difficult as time went on, so Yang Kai could not tell how long it would take his Embodiment to complete this task.

Yang Kai wasn’t worried and simply sat down in his new Medicine Garden, lightly inhaling the medicinal fragrances coming from all directions as he took out a round bead from his Space Ring.

Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core!

He agreed to Luo Lan’s proposal to visit the Severed World because he wanted to obtain the Monster Core of a Shocking Void Beast.

Shocking Void Beasts were ancient Monster Beasts that were born proficient in the Dao of Space, so its Monster Core was a treasure that would be of unimaginable help to Yang Kai who also cultivated the Dao of Space.

In the Severed World, Yang Kai had refined the spatial helix made from pure Space Spirit Crystals, allowing his comprehension of the Dao of Space and his Space Force to soar. If he could now absorb the mysteries contained in this Shocking Void Beast Monster Core, his accomplishments would certainly go another step further.

Taking out his Purple Origin Furnace, Yang Kai pushed his Conflagrated Spiritual Energy.

He wanted to refine the Shocking Void Beast’s Monster Core into a Spirit Pill in order to maximize his ability to absorb its essence and energy.

Fortunately, the True Alchemy Enlightenment Scripture had an ancient pill recipe that used a Shocking Void Beast Monster Core as its primary ingredient, and Yang Kai was not short on auxiliary materials now.

Time flew by, and soon two months had passed.

Outside the floating continent, Gui Zu frowned as his complexion became somewhat gloomy and his mood became anxious.

Since that day he felt the movements of Yang Kai’s breakthrough, more than three months had passed yet Yang Kai had yet to appear.

Could his breakthrough have failed, and he died under the World Energy baptism? If that was the case, it would really be caused by the Heavens being jealous.

At this moment, Gui Zu stood alone in the void, feeling a deep sense of unease in his heart; after all, he had just agreed to join Yang Kai’s High Heaven Sect in order to request Alchemy from High Heaven Sect’s Origin King Grade Alchemy Grandmasters to improve his strength. If Yang Kai suddenly died here though, how was he supposed to go find High Heaven Sect? He did not even know what Cultivation Star High Heaven Sect was on.

Ni Guang and Xue Yue had already left two months ago.

Ni Guang had many responsibilities, so it was impossible for him to simply wait here without purpose. As such, he had to return to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

Xue Yue wanted to stay, but how could Ni Guang allow that? Even with Gui Zu agreeing to look after her, it was not enough to put Ni Guang’s worries at ease, so despite her objections, he eventually dragged her away with him.

“If you’re still alive, come out and tell me at least,” Gui Zu muttered under his breath as he wished he could rush into the floating continent again to take a closer look.

On the other side, Zi Long and the others were patiently waiting.

But at this moment, their faces were also quite ugly.

They thought that Yang Kai must have fallen, otherwise, why hadn’t he come out? They did not care if Yang Kai lived or died, but the Immortal Tree was still on him...

“That bastard!” Zi Dong cursed bitterly.

“Brother Zi, Brother Xu, this Kong will leave first,” Kong Fa thought for a while before calling out to Xu Wei and Zi Long.

He really did not have the patience to continue waiting here.

Xu Wei glanced at Kong Fa with a bleak look, opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but held his tongue and simply sighed in the end.

After being drained by the Shattering Void Shuttle, Xu Wei had almost lost all his energy and died; even after a few months, he had not been able to restore himself and was still like a dry oil lamp.

With Xu Wei not saying anything, how could Zi Long bother about him? He simply snorted and turned away.

Kong Fa did not mind, smiled, and summoned his Star Shuttle to leave.

But at that moment, something finally changed.

In the originally extremely quiet Starry Sky, there was suddenly an unusual power fluctuation.

Kong Fa suddenly froze in place as he stared towards the source of the fluctuations in astonishment.

In the next moment, the energy fluctuations became stronger and continued to do so until less than three breaths later, a vortex had appeared.

“Si... A Chaotic Vortex?” Kong Fa was shocked while the others gathered around also wore solemn expressions. Even the strongest, Gui Zu and Zi Long, had pushed their Saint Qi as they prepared to escape.

Soon though, a figure emerged from the vortex.

“Ah!” Zi Dong yelled as he stared at the figure carefully, immediately exclaiming excitedly, “He came out! That bastard finally came out!”

The figure that appeared from the vortex was none other than Yang Kai.

In an instant, everyone’s eyes became fiery, enough so to penetrate the void.

“Kid, you’re really not dead!” Gui Zu laughed, his black Qi surging as excitement filled his heart.

“Since you’ve come out, surrender to this old master!” Zi Long shot towards Yang Kai as soon as he saw his face, a purple brilliance bursting from his body as he grabbed towards him, shouting loudly, “The Immortal Tree isn’t a treasure someone like you can touch!”

“You want to attack my Sect Master? You’ll have to ask this old master’s permission first!” Gui Zu coldly snorted, his body transforming into a black streak that instantly stood in front of Yang Kai, the Ten Thousand Soul Banner screaming as a pure and wicked force surged towards Zi Long’s mind.

“Hmph, paltry tricks!” Zi Long remained undaunted as his purple radiance became even brighter.

Gui Zu’s black Qi was forced back repeatedly in this confrontation.

“Jie Jie... are you looking down on this old master? You think too highly of yourself!” Gui Zu cackled as he transformed his Ten Thousand Soul Banner into a black curtain that wrapped around Zi Long.

“What?” Zi Long was surprised this time. He had never fought Gui Zu, so although he knew the other party was a Second-Order Origin King like himself, he had figured that Gui Zu was far weaker. It was not until they actually exchanged blows that Zi Long realized Gui Zu might be even more difficult to deal with than Ni Guang.

“Yang Boy, run quickly!” Gui Zu’s voice came out from the black fog, “This old master will stall them, run as far as you can in that time!”

“Haha... we’ll just wait,” After Yang Kai walked out of the vortex, he looked around and soon understood the situation, but he remained still, looking completely confident.

“You want to run?” Zi Dong snapped as he waved his hand, “Xu Wei, kill him for me.”

Xu Wei barely retained the form of a living person, but despite his terrible condition, he was still an Origin King. A skinny camel was bigger than a horse, so Zi Dong did not hesitate to order Xu Wei to attack.

Xu Wei also didn’t dare to defy this command and rushed towards Yang Kai with a cold face, roaring grimly, “It’s all your fault you little bastard! If it wasn’t for you, how could this old master have fallen so low?”

Him being subdued by Zi Dong was mostly because Yang Kai had attacked him back in the Severed World, causing him to suffer a serious injury. If that weren’t the case, how could he have surrendered to Zi Long after just a few threats?

Which Origin King wasn’t extremely proud and arrogant? How could he be willing to serve as a slave to another?

Especially a little brat who was nothing more than an Origin Realm cultivator!

Things did not end there though. During the process of chasing down Yang Kai, Xu Wei’s vitality had been greatly overdrawn by the Shattering Void Shuttle’s, causing him to wither and age markedly.

All of this was because of Yang Kai, and with Xu Wei not daring to get angry with Zi Long and Zi Dong, he could only transfer all his resentment to Yang Kai.

As such, after receiving the order from Zi Dong, Xu Wei immediately rushed forward and did not hesitate to use all the strength he could in his current state to attack.

The surrounding space trembled under the full might of an Origin King’s blow.

Xu Wei was determined to take Yang Kai’s life with this one attack.

In any case, Zi Long and Zi Dong only cared about the Immortal Tree, not whether Yang Kai lived or died. After killing this boy, they just needed to take the Immortal Tree from his Space Ring!

Xu Wei’s whole body seemed to turn into a small sun as it crashed down on Yang Kai’s head.

Zi Dong’s eyes could not help shrinking as a hint of fear flashed across his face. During this time, his attitude towards Xu Wei had been extremely harsh. However, Xu Wei did not dare to complain at all because his Soul Brand was in Zi Dong’s possession. This led Zi Dong to believe that the Origin King Realm was not all it was made out to be.

But after seeing Xu Wei’s full-powered blow, Zi Dong realized that he was mistaken.

Such a blow would be able to kill him a dozen times over.

“This bastard is dead!” Zi Dong secretly celebrated.

After getting rid of Yang Kai, only Xue Yue and Gu Jian Xin would be able to compare with him. If he could then suppress Xue Yue and Gu Jian Xin, he would become the true leader of the Star Field’s younger generation!

As such wild thoughts crossed his mind, a cold grin appeared on Zi Dong’s face.

“Secret Technique, Exile!” A shout suddenly rang out from Yang Kai’s mouth and facing Xu Wei’s earth-shattering blow, his expression remained calm and confident. He did not even show any intention to evade, instead just raising his palm towards Xu Wei.

This palm exuded a mysterious energy fluctuation which grew more and more intense by the moment. From Xu Wei’s perspective, it was like everything before his eyes, even light, was being swallowed up by an empty chaotic nothingness.

“What?” Xu Wei exclaimed in shock.

The dazzling light from his attack was instantly annihilated as Xu Wei stood not far in front of Yang Kai in a daze, staring at the scene before him incredulously, his eyes threatening to pop out of their sockets.

He did not know what happened just now. He had made a full-powered attack, but Yang Kai remained unharmed after taking it head-on, with not even his hair being disturbed.

It was as if his attack had been banished to some other foreign space.
