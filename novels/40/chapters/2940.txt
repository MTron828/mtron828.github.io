There was an incessant sound of banging as Zhu Lie was punched around like a sack by Yang Kai. Dragon Blood splattered everywhere, and he was in a terrible state.

But no matter how hard he was beaten, Zhu Lie never thought of backing down or begging for mercy. Instead, the harder Yang Kai beat him, the colder his eyes would become, as if he was vowing to pay him back for the pain a hundred times over if Yang Kai didn’t beat him to death here.

The Dragon Clan’s arrogance was evident. Even if Yang Kai had already transformed into his forty-metre-tall Half-Dragon Form, he was still no different from an ant in Zhu Lie’s eyes.

There was another loud bang and Zhu Lie was beaten down from the sky, crashing heavily to the ground. Before he could get up, Yang Kai had already stomped on his face.

“Do you submit?” Yang Kai looked down at him, “If you tell me you submit, then I’ll let you go right now!”

“Never!” Zhu Lie ground his teeth, “You think yourself skilled when you have to rely on bloodline suppression? If you have the guts, then fight me in human form!”

Yang Kai laughed, “What sort of dog fart reasoning is that? Don’t you Dragons always judge each other with your bloodlines?”

“You’re no member of the Dragon Clan!” Zhu Lie scoffed.

“That’s not true either. In human form, you’re as strong as a Third-Order Emperor, whereas I’m only a First-Order Emperor. If we fight in human form, then wouldn’t I be suffering a big loss?” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Faced with trash like you, would a Third-Order Emperor cultivation even be needed? This Dragon can suppress his cultivation to the First-Order to fight you!” Zhu Lie shot him a disdainful expression.

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, “Seems like you’re quite confident. You say that now, but what happens if you can’t beat me?”

“Can’t beat you? Impossible!” Zhu Lie tried to shake his head, but he was firmly suppressed by Yang Kai’s large foot. He couldn’t even do something as simple as shaking his head and could only sneer contemptuously, “Under the premise that both parties are at the same level, no one can be a match for a member of a Dragon Clan.”

“You’ll never know.” Yang Kai sneered, “What about this? We can fight in human form, just like you say. There will be no bloodline suppression. However, you must suppress your cultivation to the First-Order. If you lose, then we will write off everything that happened previously.”

“And if you lose?”

“You can do with me whatever you wish.”

“Truly?” Zhu Lie’s eyes brightened.

“Truly!”

“Good. If you lose, then you have to come back to Dragon Island with me. And, I want you to kowtow to me three times, loudly. This is considered a great humiliation to you humans, isn’t it?”

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Don’t even mention three, you can even order me to do thirty or three hundred if it so pleases you.” While speaking, Yang Kai took a few steps back and freed Zhu Lie.

Zhu Lie jumped up, face filled with anger, as if he could pounce over and exact his revenge at any moment, but he held back his impulse desperately and said with a cold expression, “If you’re a man, then don’t let others despise you. I hope you’ll keep your word.”

Yang Kai hummed a soft response, “That will have to wait until you beat me.”

At the end of his sentence, he took the initiative to release his Dragon Transformation Secret Art. His forty-metre-tall body quickly shrank in size, returning to its original state.

At that instant, Zhu Lie rushed over, starting with a breath of dragon flames. Even though he was not in his Great Dragon form and was unable to use most of the Dragon Clan’s Secret Techniques, there would be no problem for him to spit out a few mouthfuls of dragon flames.

He also kept the promise he made with Yang Kai and suppressed his cultivation to the First-Order Emperor Realm, so the power of his dragon flame was much lower compared to when he was in his true form.

Even so, this dragon flame wasn’t something that just anyone could resist as it still contained a very strong burning power.

After the dragon flame, he threw a fist towards Yang Kai with an exhilarated look on his face, as if he could already see himself trampling over the latter’s battered body. He had no regard for a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm human. The reason why he was trampled by Yang Kai until every part of his skin was brutalized was because of the bloodline suppression.

Once Yang Kai used his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, Zhu Lie wouldn’t be able to bring out even a tenth of his power, so how could he be his opponent?

But now, the situation was different. Both of them were in human form, so there was no bloodline suppression. He decided to beat Yang Kai up first to vent his anger before dragging him back to Dragon Island and handing him to the Great Elder.

The fist that followed punched through the dragon flames, producing some amazing and unexpected changes.

Zhu Lie’s fist seemed to be burning, but it didn’t detract the power of the dragon flames in the slightest. Instead, the two complimented each other, increasing the might of the attack dramatically.

*Ci la…*

A sword light flashed over, and a broadsword cut right down onto Zhu Lie’s fist, emitting an ear-piercing noise like the sound of clashing metal. The dragon flame that was wrapped around his fist was actually cut apart and became so weak that it seemed like it might go out at any moment. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What?” Zhu Lie was shocked, and his face changed slightly.

He had been suffering the ravages of Yang Kai these past few days, so he had some understanding of this Human’s strength and knew that he was much stronger than the average First-Order Emperor Realm cultivator.

Zhu Lie did not expect to be able to do much to his opponent with this opening blow and was just trying to test his depths. However, he didn’t expect his opponent to be able to counter him so easily.

When he looked up, Zhu Lie’s face changed again.

That was because he discovered that Yang Kai didn’t show the slightest hint of strain at all. On the other hand, there was a faint smile at his lips, as if he were mocking him.

Zhu Lie was furious and shouted, “Putting on airs, are you?!”

Another fist blasted forward like lightning. From the momentum, it seemed like it was going to smash Yang Kai’s face to pieces.

Yang Kai turned his Myriads Sword lightly, slamming it forward, striking Zhu Lie’s second punch accurately.

Zhu Lie actually felt pain as the powerful force suddenly hit him, and this sudden change was actually a little hard for him to believe.

He was a member of the Dragon Clan and his body was incredibly sturdy. Every single part of his body was comparable to an Emperor Artifact, and yet the blow casually thrown out by this Human actually hurt him. How strong did he need to be in order to achieve that?

Was he the Dragon here or not?

In that moment of hesitation, Yang Kai had already slashed his Myriads Sword down with a cold expression.

A cold aura emerged atop his head, causing Zhu Li’s face to change drastically as he hurriedly retreated.

With a large crackle, the Myriads Sword sliced down on Zhu Lie’s body with sparks flying everywhere. By the time Zhu Lie moved a thousand metres back and looked down, he discovered that there was a long, eye-catching white mark from his belly down between his legs.

“You should be glad that you’re a Dragon, otherwise you’d have been dead already!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly appeared in front of him like a phantom. Zhu Lie looked up only to see that his enemy had appeared just fifty metres away from him at some point, the broadsword gone from his hand, a dark, ten-metre-long attack in the shape of a crescent shooting out towards him.

Zhu Lie wanted to move, but he discovered that the space around him had suddenly become viscous. It actually gave him the illusion that he had fallen into a mire, and no matter how he tried, he was unable to dodge.

Letting out a roar, his aura soared and Dragon Scales appeared on his skin. He was going to take the blow directly with his body.

The pitch-black Moon Blade soared across the sky, causing Zhu Lie’s heart to palpitate.

He had no idea whether he could resist such an attack with just his physical body. That attack contained clear fluctuations of Space Principles, which were completely condensed from the Void. Anywhere it passed, even space itself was devoured.

If an attack like that were to cut through his body, then it may even be able to devour a part of him. For the first time in his life, Zhu Lie felt overwhelmed. He did not feel this way even when he was suppressed by Yang Kai’s Dragon Transformation Secret Art.

Just as Zhu Lie’s eyes were about to bulge from fear, the Moon Blade suddenly shattered a few centimetres from him.

His heart was palpitating as if he had just escaped from death and cold sweat dripped down his forehead. Zhu Lie raised his head to look at Yang Kai with a ghastly complexion, only to see that annoying man smiling at him and snickering, “You lost!”

Zhu Lie’s face was as black as the bottom of a pot, but he did not say a word.

Indeed, he lost, and not from that Moon Blade-like attack, but at his own hands.

During the critical moment, he raised his strength to the Third-Order Emperor Realm and even unleashed some of his Dragon Clan characteristics, which went against the previous agreement he had with Yang Kai.

Without even coming close to figuring out the true extent of Yang Kai’s power, without the latter unleashing his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, he ended up losing in such a muddled manner.

An unspeakable feeling of shame and frustration overcame Zhu Lie, causing his entire person to look incomparably down. His lips opened a few times, but he couldn’t make a single sound.

It had always been the Dragon Clan who looked down on others, but it was at this moment that Zhu Lie realized that other figures had already appeared above the Dragon Clan while they weren’t noticing.

“You’re not going to go back on your word, are you?” Yang Kai peered at Zhu Lie, “We agreed before this that our grudge will be settled if you lost. Unless the Dragon Clan can’t afford to lose?”

These words stimulated Zhu Lie greatly, and his arrogance forced him to snap back, “Who can’t afford to lose! If I lose, then I lose! Just as you said, our grudges are now settled!”

Yang Kai beamed, “Very good, very good! En, in that case, you can go back where you came from. By the way, please pass Dragon Island a message from me. Tell them I’ll visit them when I have the time, so no need to send someone over to me every now and again.”

Zhu Lie said with a grim expression, “I’ll pass on your word to Dragon Island, but I don’t know what decision they will make.”

Yang Kai nodded, “No matter. You should tell Zhu Qing too. You should be able to contact each other, right? Tell her not to look for me again. It’s… dangerous.”

Every time he was around Zhu Qing, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to control the stirring in his bloodline. The impulses hiding deep inside his heart felt like they could burst out at any moment, which gave him a bad and dangerous feeling. Yang Kai knew that this was draconic nature, and the deeper he cultivated his Dragon Transformation Secret Art, the stronger his draconic nature would become. One day, he would not be able to suppress those impulses.

So, it would be better for Zhu Qing to stay as far away from him as possible, if possible for the rest of their lives.

“Zhu Qing is probably already dead, so I won’t be able to convey your words.” Zhu Lie shook his head slowly.

The smile on Yang Kai’s face slowly disappeared, “What do you mean by probably dead?”
