A red light suddenly emerged that suddenly shot out from High Heaven Palace, flying out of the Sect Defending Array.

When it arrived in front of the ship, the red light paused for a moment, revealing a small and delicate figure. It was Zhu Qing, who had just left in anger.

In actual fact, she was actually feeling extremely regretful that she had fallen out with Yang Kai earlier and left in a moment of rage, completely forgetting the task given to her by her Elders. She was cursing Yang Kai in her heart for putting her in this awkward situation with his lack of propriety and for not even trying to stop her or persuade her to stay.

When she suddenly saw the ship stopped outside the Sect Defending Array, she naturally looked over in curiosity.

Her eyes swept past Mi Qi and Ji Ying without pause, only pausing on Li Jiao for a moment as the corners of her mouth twitched, seemingly out of disdain.

Inexplicably, Li Jiao felt his heart clench, like he was being stared at by a vicious predator. He suddenly had the impression that this petite woman in front of him could kill him at will.

He was flabbergasted at how he could suddenly feel such a thing. He was already a Third-Order Emperor, so the only ones who could kill him at will would be Great Emperors.

Could this woman in front of him be a Great Emperor?

But that was impossible. He had never heard of a Great Emperor who looked like this before. Flower Shadow Great Emperor may be a woman, but she definitely did not look like this.

[What’s going on?] Li Jiao was confused for a moment, wondering whether he was too on edge and imagining things.

“It’s you!” Li Xuan called out as he pointed at Zhu Qing, eyes bloodshot as if he were looking at his most hated enemy.

“Who is she?” Ji Ying asked with a frown.

This woman had flown out from High Heaven Palace, so she should be one of their people. Could she be High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master? But that didn’t make sense as High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master was supposed to be a man named Yang Kai?

“Honoured Master, it’s her! She also hit this disciple along with High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master. This disciple suffered a lot because of her…” Li Xuan began to cry.

“She laid hands on you?” Ji Ying’s face turned dark.

“That’s right, she was the one who hit this disciple first! She is an Emperor Realm Master while this disciple is only in First-Order Dao Source Realm. There was no way this disciple could have fought back…” Li Xuan cried out with snot and tears flowing, appearing extremely hurt.

“Shameless!” Ji Ying cursed angrily. Originally, he had a good impression of this woman when he saw how beautiful she was and how nobly she carried herself, but after hearing what Li Xuan said, that good impression crashed. In an instant, he felt that this woman was abominable no matter her outward appearance.

“To actually bully the weak even though you’re an Emperor Realm Master. It is simply a disgrace to all Emperors!” Mi Qi shouted angrily and pushed his Emperor Qi, “Let this King teach you a lesson and exact justice for Martial Nephew Li!”

As he said that, he shot towards Zhu Qing like a great Peng spreading its wings.

Ji Ying’s expression changed, seemingly wanting to stop Mi Qi’s reckless move, but on second thought, he gave up and just stood there with a grim expression.

It would be good to teach this High Heaven Palace a lesson, so it thought twice about being so arrogant. He wasn’t worried that Mi Qi wouldn’t be this woman’s opponent since he was, after all, a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. Even if this woman was strong, she should pose no threat to Mi Qi.

Zhu Qing furrowed deeply as her anger erupted.

She was already enraged from the grievances Yang Kai inflicted upon her, so now that Mi Qi was taking the initiative to rush at her, it gave her a chance to vent. Raising her arm, she swung her fist out, punching straight towards Mi Qi’s chest.

Mi Qi’s hands moved quickly to form a large seal and he sneered, “A measly thing like you dares to contend with this King?!”

Pushing forward both hands, Emperor Pressure spread out. Mi Qi’s move was extremely fierce, as if he wanted to suppress Zhu Qing in one hit.

The dainty fist flew forward without pause though, a vortex of power forming around it as it shredded everything in his path, smashing apart Mi Qi’s seal as easily as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood.

“What!?” Mi Qi’s expression drastically as fear surged up from deep within himself. Only now did he realize that he had greatly underestimated his opponent. Even though this woman did not use her Emperor Qi, her raw strength was beyond extraordinary. By the time he realized what was happening and tried to execute another move to defend himself, it was too late. He could only gather up his Emperor Qi hastily in order to guard himself.

*Hong long long…*

As Zhu Qing’s delicate-looking fist made contact with Mi Qi’s chest, a large depression instantly formed. Ji Ying and the others standing behind Mi Qi could clearly see the bulge appearing on Mi Qi’s back, making it look like he was an old hunched man, while at the same time, a wave of pressure burst out behind him, exploding a big hole in the robes Mi Qi wore.

The Sect Master of one of the top Sects in the Northern Territory, Full Sky Sect, the Third-Order Emperor Realm Master Mi Qi, was sent flying and crashed heavily into the protective barrier of the ship, planting him spread-eagled mid-air.

*Ssii…*

The sound of someone gasping was heard. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Everyone’s eyes were filled with astonishment.

Even though they suspected Mi Qi had underestimated his opponent, being able to devastate him in one hit proved beyond any doubt the strength of this woman.

Li Xuan, who was originally excited to watch how Mi Qi was going to get justice for him, suddenly felt as if an invisible hand was gripping his neck, almost causing his eyes to pop out of their sockets. His whole body began trembling as his heart was filled with fear.

He was slapped by Zhu Qing the other day, but he didn’t suffer anything more than a sore cheek.

But if she had hit him with this much power that day, would there even be ashes left?

Cold sweat poured down his whole body.

Only after being stunned for quite a while did Ji Ying remember to lower the protective barrier and bring Mi Qi inside.

“This King underestimated yo… wa…” Landing on the deck, Mi Qi was just about to say something to save some face when he coughed out a mouthful of blood mid-sentence, his face was as pale as paper.

Ji Ying was shocked and quickly fed him a Spirit Pill.

“Who are you people?!” After punching Mi Qi, Zhu Qing felt much better and asked while looking coldly ahead at them.

Ji Ying was furious. He thought that this person had come with the sole intention to humiliate him; after all, he had already informed the so-called Head Manager of his status while this petite woman had just come out from High Heaven Palace. How could she possibly now know who he was?

She was clearly asking despite knowing the answer.

Had High Heaven Palace already grown this conceited?

“Qing’er, don’t be rude!” A bellow came from afar, and by the time it was heard, Yang Kai and Hua Qing Si had already arrived together.

Zhu Qing glared at him, but then she turned her eyes away.

[Don’t think I’ll forgive you just because you called me Qing’er!]

“Grandmaster Ji has come from afar. This Palace Master apologizes for not welcoming you sooner and hopes Grandmaster Ji can be magnanimous!” Yang Kai cupped his fists with a smile, appearing neither overbearing nor servile, instead putting himself on equal footing with Ji Ying.

On the way here, he also learned of this man’s identity from Hua Qing Si.

The Fifth Disciple of Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, Emperor Alchemist Ji Ying.

Ji Ying responded indifferently, “Palace Master Yang is polite. It was this Ji who came uninvited and disturbed your noble Palace.”

Even though he felt annoyed that this man made him wait so long before appearing, one does not greet a smile with a raised hand. He couldn’t fall out with him as soon as he came out, could he?

Yang Kai smiled broadly, “I have long heard of Grandmaster Ji’s esteemed name. It is a great honour to have you here at my High Heaven Palace so please, do tell me what brings you here.”

Li Jiao confronted him coldly, “Palace Master Yang, Grandmaster Ji made the trip here personally and you are still keeping him out with this Sect Defending Array? Is this how your High Heaven Palace treats its guests?”

“Your Excellency is…” Yang Kai glanced at Li Jiao.

Ji Ying introduced, “This is Fire Dragon Palace’s Palace Master, Li Jiao!”

“So, it is Palace Master Li… And who is that man spitting blood over there?” Yang Kai turned his attention to Mi Qi.

Mi Qi had already taken a Spirit Pill to suppress the tumbling blood inside of him, but hearing these words almost made him spit out another mouthful of blood.

Ji Ying answered, “This is Full Sky Sect’s Sect Master, Mi Qi.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. “So, Sect Master Mi has come as well.”

Li Jiao coldly snorted, “En. Palace Master Yang doesn’t seem to welcome Brother Mi and me very much.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin and thought seriously for a moment, “Indeed, you are not very welcome!”

[Simply ridiculous. These two guys have banded together, obviously to pick a fight, and they’re asking me whether I welcome them or not! They must be sick in the head.]

Li Jiao’s breath almost got stuck in his throat as his face turned ugly. Even those with power and status like him and Mi Qi had to display some decorum despite how much they disliked a person. If Yang Kai had gone to his Fire Dragon Palace, he would still treat him with courtesy despite wanting to kick him out on sight. That was simple manners, but who could have anticipated that this Yang Kai would be so blunt and disrespectful?

Yang Kai chuckled seeing this reaction and continued, “But since you’re already here, please do come in.”

As he said that, he opened the Sect Defending Array.

It made him seem extremely reluctant.

Ji Ying collected the ship and flew into High Heaven Palace with the others.

“Please, follow me.” After saying that, Yang Kai turned around and led the way. After flying out some distance, he turned back and shouted, “Qing’er, why are you still out there?”

Zhu Qing was originally waiting there bitterly for Yang Kai to come and apologize, and she decided she would forgive him for his impertinence as long as he could say a few coaxing words to her. However, after waiting for so long, he never even spared her a glance in the end.

She couldn’t help but feel a little hurt.

[Am I really going to leave just like this? What about the mission Elder entrusted to me? What about the Ancestral Dragon Source?]

The moment she heard Yang Kai’s shout, she turned around and scurried back into High Heaven Palace, following right behind Yang Kai with a pout on her lips. Watching Yang Kai’s back, her lips opened and closed, but none of them could hear what she was muttering about.

From the shape of her lips though, she seemed to be cursing him.

“Palace Master Yang, this woman is…” Li Jiao asked quietly.

He had no idea why, but having Zhu Qing follow along at the back made him feel prickly all over. He felt extremely uncomfortable, as if the one following behind them was not a marvellous beauty, but rather an ancient beast that was going to devour him. It sent chills running up his spine.

“Haha, just a little servant girl. Please don’t mind her, Palace Master Li,” Yang Kai casually blabbed.

“Servant girl…” Li Jiao looked speechless.

“Is that not an insult to me, Palace Master Yang?!” Mi Qi almost choked himself to death, feeling extremely irritated. Her strength was unfathomable, so how could she possibly be a servant girl? In the outside world, this woman was more than strong enough to found a top Sect of her own.

If she was truly just a servant girl, then wouldn’t he be less than a mere servant girl?!

“Why would I humiliate you? I don’t hold a grudge against you!” Yang Kai grinned, “If I really did have a grudge, I still would not have humiliated you either. It would be much faster to just kill you!”

Mi Qi had no idea what Yang Kai was trying to insinuate, but he quickly shut his mouth. He could tell at a glance that this Yang Kai wasn’t someone to be messed with. He instinctively felt that his decision to accompany Ji Ying on this trip was a bad one. If things went poorly, then his lifetime of fame and fortune would end here.

“Qing’er, go and prepare up some tea for our guests,” Yang Kai turned around to order Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing’s face turned dark and she eyed Yang Kai angrily.

Yang Kai, however, just glared at her.

“Good!” Zhu Qing submitted helplessly and turned around, flying off in another direction.

“I’ll help you!” Hua Qing Si quickly followed her.
