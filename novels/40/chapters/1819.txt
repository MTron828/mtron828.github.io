“Originally, the World Energy in this place was even thinner.” Yang Kai smiled slightly. But just as he started meticulously checking the surroundings, he furrowed his brow slightly.

“What’s wrong!?” Gui Zu asked immediately after noticing the strange look on his face.

“It should not be like this.” A suspicious look took over Yang Kai’s face. “The World Energy of this continent should not be this thin. So much time has already passed, so it should have been much denser.”

The reason for Tong Xuan Realm’s thin World Energy was the Great Demon God Seal isolating this Cultivation Star from the Star Field, preventing the supplement of World Energy from outside. The other reason was that the Star Source of this Cultivation Star was nearing its end.

[But after Little Senior Sister refined the power of the Star Source and became the Star Master of Tong Xuan Realm, it should have brought changes.]

[The World Energy of Tong Xuan Realm should have grown denser with the increase in Little Senior Sister’s strength.]

[Tong Xuan Realm should not have just this little bit of World Energy after such a long time.]

“If there were no mountains and rivers here, this place would have no World Energy,” Gui Zu immediately concluded after just taking a glance at the surrounding terrain.

Yang Kai nodded gently, agreeing with this.

“Come on, let’s return to my previous sect,” proposed Yang Kai. Then, he assessed the directions and shot towards the Nine Heavens Holy Land with Gui Zu.

He had decided to lay the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array in Nine Heavens Holy Land, where a natural Spirit Array had formed by the nine peaks. It was a rare cultivation paradise in Tong Xuan Realm.

It was now quite easy for him to lay a barrier to hide the existence of the Space Array. And presumably, the cultivators of Tong Xuan Realm could not break it even if they were given ten thousand years.

Three to five days went by in a flash.

While flying, both Yang Kai and Gui Zu frowned as they looked down from time to time.

“Elder, did you notice something?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

“The World Energy of your homeland is declining very quickly, like the air leaking through a punctured balloon.”

“You felt it too.” Yang Kai’s face turned ashen.

Previously, Yang Kai felt that something wasn’t right when he noticed the thin World Energy of Tong Xuan Realm. However, the place where he landed wasn’t the World-Energy-rich place he used to live. Therefore, Yang Kai hadn’t paid great attention to it.

But after having been flying for three to five days, he hadn’t found any place rich in World Energy; whether it was towering mountains or the gushing rivers, they all seemed to be filled with Death Qi. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This discovery had bogged him down with some worries.

There were only two possibilities for this kind of situation to arise. Either Tong Xuan Realm was in some kind of trouble, or Star Master Xia Ning Chang had met with an accident.

[Either way, it’s extremely detrimental to Little Senior Sister.]

Yang Kai suddenly regretted coming here. He couldn’t wait to return to Shadowed Star to check if there was anything wrong with Little Senior Sister.

[On second thought, Little Senior Sister should be perfectly safe in the High Heaven Sect. She should not have encountered any problem. So what is happening to this world?]

[What’s making the world have such a dense Death Qi while the World Energy is growing thinner and thinner.]

“Huh!? What the hell are these guys doing?” Gui Zu pointed in a direction and exclaimed after noticing something.

Yang Kai’s flying figure immediately came to a halt as he looked down from the sky.

Below him was a huge valley with a resplendent Array in the shape of a hexagram rotating. What’s more, a dense crowd of cultivators were standing around it. Every cultivator had formed hand seals; they were trying to maintain the operation of the Array with great difficulty. From time to time, a cultivator would be unable to hold on and fall down but another cultivator beside him would immediately take his place.

There were some cultivators in black around it as well, looking at this with a cold look in their eyes. Occasionally, they would even lash out and beat the people.

Each of these men in black had a surging aura, but they didn’t participate in maintaining the Array. They seemed to be monitoring it.

“Origin Returning Realm Master!?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow as he exclaimed, “How is this possible? How can Origin Returning Realm masters appear here!?”

Since ancient times, the strongest cultivator born in Tong Xuan Realm was the Great Demon God. But even the Great Demon God had only touched the mystery of the Saint King Realm. Since then, the strongest cultivators in Tong Xuan Realm could only reach the Saint Realm!

[Maybe Little Senior Sister’s act of refining the Star Source has given them a chance to become Origin Returning Realm masters.]

But right then, Yang Kai sensed the aura of two Origin Returning Realm cultivators passing by in the mountain valley.

Although they were only in the First-Order, they were indeed Origin Returning Realm masters nonetheless.

“Your homeland didn’t have an Origin Returning Realm master before?” asked Gui Zu.

“In the past, the strongest level anyone has reached was the Third-Order Saint Realm!”

“If that’s the case, they are all outsiders!” Gui Zu pointed below and said, “And judging by the Spirit Array below, it seems to be swallowing the surrounding world energy. They seem to be using this Spirit Array to refine something!”

“Outsiders...” Yang Kai’s eyes flickered with an ominous gleam. “Courting death!?”

Only now was he struck with a realization.

Tong Xuan Realm was safe and sound until now and was not disturbed by Star Field master because of the barrier arranged by Great Demon God. The Great Demon God was really amazing. He had laid a barrier using Tong Xuan Realm as the base, shielding the entire Cultivation Star from the Star Field.

But in the end, his barrier had been broken by Yang Kai, allowing Tong Xuan Realm to reintegrate with the Star Field.

And finally, Tong Xuan Realm was discovered by the Star Field masters after a few decades. And thus, the Tong Xuan Realm was invaded.

Back then, when Yang Kai left Tong Xuan Realm, he did so first to find Su Yan, and second to pursue higher Martial Dao, lest his homeland encounter some stronger enemy that they couldn’t resist. The Skeleton Race invasion back then was the best example. Had it not been for the Great Demon God’s amazing insight and means, this continent would have been enslaved a long time ago.

But today, the very same thing he feared was happening again!

The Spirit Array laid by those people below was extracting the World Energy of Tong Xuan Realm which was tantamount to destroying Xia Ning Chang’s path of cultivation.

Yang Kai immediately blew his top. His figure went crashing down like a meteor, surrounded by an endless chill.

At least a thousand people were gathered in the valley below.

Ninety-nine percent of the cultivators were furious and reluctant. But they had no choice but to participate in maintaining the Array under the threat of life. They were suffering but dared not resist, as all of the rebels had been killed by those men in black.

They had no idea who these people were, but each of them was amazingly strong and none of the Tong Xuan Realm cultivators could resist them.

There were fewer than ten men in black, that’s all. All of them stood with their arms crossed behind their backs on one side. Only a young man was sitting on a chair, served by two stunning young girls on either side. God knows where they caught these two from but when serving him, they looked quite sincere and afraid as if they feared punishments for making a mistake.

The young man had a rustic teapot in his hand and happened to have his eyes half shut; he appeared as if he was living a life of ease and leisure. But from time to time, his eyes would flash with a radiant gleam as he swept a gaze over the thousand enslaved people.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he pointed in a direction. “Bring that girl here.”

The two girls by his side suddenly shuddered upon hearing this. Panic was clearly written on their faces. They glanced at each with worry overflowing from their pretty little eyes.

The young man immediately noticed their strange behaviour. He glanced sideways at the two girls and let out a cold snort, “It seems you two know something.”

The two girls panicked immediately. They knelt down hard on the ground, shuddering. But they dare not utter a single word.

“Hmph, that girl is intentionally wearing baggy clothes and had smeared her face to hide her figure and appearance. She thinks that she can fool this Young Master’s eyes!? This Young Master has seen countless women, I can see through this at first glance... Judging by your reaction, that girl should have an extraordinary status in your Shrouded Heaven Mansion, otherwise, you wouldn’t be this worried!”

The young man talked with confidence and composure, making trickles of cold sweat trickled down the two girls’ foreheads. One of the courageous girls immediately said, “Young Master, that woman is really ugly. She is not fit for Young Master. Young Master, how about you leave her alone and let your servant take care of you?”

She forced a charming smile as she spoke, but it was rather stiff because of fear and looked even more pitiful.

A lewd smile immediately emerged on the young man’s lips as he reached out and he hooked the beautiful girl’s chin with his finger.

The beautiful girl didn’t dare to move.

But the next moment, the young man slapped the young girl, causing that girl to cry in pain as she was sent flying.

“What this Young Master does is none of your business!” The young man snorted coldly, looking displeased.

Next, he smiled and looked at the other girl who was kneeling on the ground, and stated indifferently, “You would be dead before you can make a move!”

The second girl’s tender body trembled as she dispersed the strength she had secretly gathered. She didn’t dare to make a move again.

She understood that there was a deep chasm between this young man and her people. Otherwise, the entire Shrouded Heaven Mansion would not have been enslaved by these people without offering any resistance.

Her eyes immediately flickered with despair.

At this moment, the girl operating the Array was brought before the young man by a man in black.

This girl was wearing extremely loose clothes. Her face was in a mess. It was extremely difficult to tell whether she was beautiful or ugly, had a shapely figure or was fat. But her eyes were extremely bright and there was an intelligent gleam to them as if they could speak. They were quite eye-catching.

“Let me go, you bastards!” The woman struggled endlessly, but how could she break free from Saint King’s hold with just the cultivation of Transcendent Realm.

The young man looked at the girl with a smile as he meticulously checked out her appearance and looked over her body. The girl felt humiliated and uncomfortable under the young man’s aggressive gaze. She nibbled her lips as she glared at him angrily.

“Beautiful, absolutely beautiful!” The young man broke into laughter. “I finally found someone pleasing to this Young Master’s eyes. Do you want to know how you caught this Young Master’s attention?”

The girl didn’t say a word but her eyes burned with fury.

The young man didn’t care about it and spoke indifferently, “Because your companions’ stupidity betrayed you. Their cultivation was obviously higher than yours but they were extremely respectful to you. If my guess is right, you shouldn’t have a low position in the Shrouded Heaven Mansion, am I right? Or perhaps, you are Palace Master’s daughter!?”

His voice wasn’t loud but it travelled to everyone’s ears, making the Shrouded Heaven Mansion experts’ ashamed and angry. They had never even imagined that their lady would be targeted by this bastard due to their attitude towards her.

Had they known this, they would not have been this careless.
