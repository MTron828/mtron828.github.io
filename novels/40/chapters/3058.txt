A battle to the death!

The atmosphere in that place changed drastically when everyone heard what the Second Elder had said.

If someone else had said these words, it could be taken as just a threat; however, since the Second Elder was the one who had spoken, it really meant that they would fight with Yang Kai until either party lost their lives. She had been completely enraged, so she was determined to kill Yang Kai in order to wipe clean the humiliation that had been inflicted upon the Dragon Clan today.

Zhu Qing’s face turned totally pale.

She thought that by just capturing Fu Chi, they would have a bargaining chip to negotiate with the Elders, but she didn’t expect that the Second Elder would be furious enough to say such a thing. Zhu Qing was utterly flustered and didn’t know what to do, so she could only shift her attention to Yang Kai’s towering figure.

“How dare you threaten me!” Yang Kai’s expression turned even more ruthless as he directly grabbed one of Fu Chi’s arms, the difference between their sizes making it look like he was grasping a toothpick.

“What are you trying to do?” Fu Chi was stunned.

Right after Fu Chi finished speaking, Yang Kai exerted more force with his hand.

*Chi…*

In an instant, blood spurted out. Fu Chi was startled for a moment before he shouted in pain as his arm had been torn off by Yang Kai. The wound appeared uneven as his pure Dragon Blood kept squirting out like a fountain. Every drop of his blood appeared translucent as it dropped on the ground and dyed the place crimson.

Dragon Blood was precious, so every drop was extremely valuable. It could be used to make pills or just be consumed directly. For a Dragonborn like Li Jiao, Dragon Blood was even more useful than Dragon Blood Flowers.

However, at this moment, priceless Dragon Blood was actually being splashed out as though it was worth nothing. The blood’s vivid red colour sent a shock wave across everyone, making them completely terrified.

*Ssii…*

As all of them gasped as they looked dazedly at Fu Chi, their eyes brimming with fright.

With their expressions turning solemn, Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong stepped forward and tried to submerge Yang Kai with their peerless Dragon Pressure. They hadn’t made a move just now because Yang Kai hadn’t really done anything that had harmed the Dragon Clan’s interests, and for Zhu Qing’s sake, they weren’t willing to bully a Junior like Yang Kai.

However, things were different now because an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon’s arm had been torn off by Yang Kai. As the Great Elder and Fourth Elder of Dragon Island, they couldn’t stay put and do nothing.

“Don’t you dare!” Yang Kai turned his head as he glared at Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong and pinched Fu Chi’s other arm. With a ferocious expression, he looked like a beast that would bite anyone that tried to approach, his eyes flashing with a horrifying glare.

Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong stopped in their tracks, but after a short pause, Zhu Yan spoke, “You’ve gone overboard.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s the Dragon Clan who has gone overboard.”

“It’s not up to you to determine who is right or wrong. Release Fu Chi now. We can talk it out.”

Yang Kai replied without any hesitation, “There’s nothing to discuss. Let Qing’er and I leave now, and I’ll let him live. Otherwise, all of us will die together!”

Earlier, if he said such a thing, it would just be regarded as a threat that was not to be feared. However, everyone took his threat seriously now because he had just torn off Fu Chi’s arm. Apparently, he was really prepared to die today.

Both the Great Elder and the Second Elder had the power to kill Yang Kai, but before they could, Fu Chi would undoubtedly lose his life. There were only a small number of Dragon Clan members, so they couldn’t afford to lose anyone.

“Release him!” The Second Elder said through clenched teeth.

Without uttering a word, Yang Kai sneered and exerted more force with his hand.

*Chi…*

Fu Chi’s other arm was swiftly pulled off; after which Yang Kai nonchalantly threw the torn arm away and stared fixedly at Fu Zhun, apparently daring her to continue speaking.

[You threatened me, and I tore Fu Chi’s arm out; you growled at me, and I pulled his other arm out! Although he has no more arms left, he still has two legs! All Dragon Clan members are tough anyway, so these injuries wouldn’t kill him. Aren’t you trying to get Zhu Qing to marry Fu Chi? Once I kill him, let’s see how you’re going to do that!]

Yang Kai knew that he mustn’t show any signs of weaknesses in front of the Dragon Clan, he needed to appear even more ruthless than they were.

Fu Zhun was so enraged that her face turned livid. Even the incident more than ten years ago didn’t anger her so. However, Yang Kai’s actions had made her rage rise to an unprecedented level.

Fu Chi’s face had turned completely ashen after his arms were torn off as he trembled fiercely. He was a member of the Dragon Clan whose physical body was incredibly tough, so in most circumstances, it was impossible for anyone to tear off his limbs.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai had transformed into an 80-metre-long Half-Dragon, so his physical strength was equally incredible. If somehow the Great Elder or the Second Elder fell into the current Yang Kai’s hands, he would be able to separate the limbs from their bodies as well, so it was no wonder he could do that to Fu Chi with ease.

Fu Chi hung his head low as his gaze was filled with hatred.

“I’ll count down from ten, you have until then to make your decision!” Yang Kai swept a glance across all the Elders and upon finishing his words, he really started counting down.

Although he was the weaker party, he still displayed unfettered arrogance, as though he was above all of them and was the one who had the final say, making everyone feel awkward at the sight.

“Ten… Nine… Eight…” His voice was calm, which suggested that he wasn’t nervous, and his expression was filled with resolve.

Zhu Qing stepped sideward and stood beside Yang Kai. After taking a deep breath, she too put on a steadfast expression.

They were husband and wife, so they should enjoy happiness or endure hardship together. Even if they had to die, they would do so together. Although Zhu Qing never uttered a word, her actions had revealed her stance.

“One!” After Yang Kai finished counting down, all three Elders still never replied to him.

It wasn’t that they didn’t care about Fu Chi’s life or death; it was just that they could never make a concession on this day. If this news was spread, the Dragon Clan’s majesty would be destroyed. Faced with Yang Kai’s domineering attitude, they had no choice but to consider giving up on Fu Chi.

Zhu Yan sighed secretly, as he had never expected that things would come to such a point. From an outside perspective, this was mainly because Yang Kai had been too aggressive in his approach; however, no one could achieve a perfect outcome when faced with such a problem. This would be an unfortunate incident in the Dragon Clan’s history, and it also meant the end of Yang Kai’s life.

Yang Kai lowered his head and smiled at Zhu Qing. However, given his Half-Dragon face, his smile appeared rather terrifying, “Qing’er, it seems that we might die together on this day.”

With her silky hair flapping in the air, Zhu Qing replied with a smile, “I’m glad that we can keep each other company on the way to the afterlife.”

“Good!” Yang Kai growled as his expression turned solemn. Suddenly, he started uttering complicated and abstruse syllables. The syllables were so strange that the hundreds of Humans there couldn’t understand anything from them. Nevertheless, all the Dragon Clan members could feel their hearts pounding against their chests when they heard his voice as their Dragon Blood began boiling.

“A Dragon Clan Secret Technique!” Fu Zhun’s expression changed drastically as she clenched her teeth, “How did you even learn of our Secret Techniques?”

Yang Kai stared at her without responding to her as his voice turned increasingly aggressive, just like a real Dragon Roar, resounding towards the far distance.

“It’s the Ancestral Dragon Source’s inheritance!” Finally understanding what was going on, Zhu Yan said with astonishment.

The complete inheritance of an Ancient Divine Spirit could not be passed down solely through oral or written records. In fact, almost all core parts of such an inheritance were hidden within their bloodline and Source. When the awakening of their bloodline reached a certain level, that inheritance would naturally reveal itself.

The Dragon Clan was the leader of all Divine Spirits, so they were not exempted from this rule.

As Pure Blood Dragon Clan members’ bloodline improved, they would also grasp some Secret Techniques that only True Dragons could use.

Now, Yang Kai was using a High-Rank Dragon Clan Secret Technique. Apparently, he had obtained the inheritance that was supposed to belong to the Dragon Clan, and that inheritance came from the Ancestral Dragon Source within him.

That was the reason Zhu Yan was astonished. Since Yang Kai had obtained the Dragon Clan’s inheritance, it also meant that he had been acknowledged by the Ancestral Dragon Source. It was no wonder that he was able to lift Zhu Qing’s seal without anyone noticing.

Zhu Qing’s seal was planted by the Second Elder using a Dragon Clan Secret Technique, but given the strength Yang Kai had displayed, he indeed had the power to remove the seal.

Since that was the case, he could no longer be considered a pure Human. He could now be considered an esteemed member of the Dragon Clan.

Since Zhu Yan had figured it out, there was no way that revelation hadn’t dawned on Fu Zhun, but at that moment, she still couldn’t believe that fact.

She had intended to detain Yang Kai and extract the Ancestral Dragon Source from him, but now it seemed her idea couldn’t be realized.

If she wanted to remove the Dragon Source from him, the first prerequisite was that it was in a complete state.

However, since the Ancestral Dragon Source had acknowledged this Human and even integrated a significant portion of itself into his being, there was no way to separate it from him without causing severe damage. Even if they managed to forcefully separate it from him, it would only result in an unbearable loss to the Dragon Clan.

Only members of the Dragon Clan could employ the Dragon Clan’s Secret Techniques, which was an unbreakable rule.

The syllables wafting from Yang Kai’s mouth were an ancient Dragon Language, and although the others couldn’t understand it, there was no way the Dragon Clan members didn’t.

At that instant, all the Dragon Clan members were dumbstruck with even the Elders falling into a dazed state.

Before they could come to their senses though, Fu Chi, who had been held hostage by Yang Kai, screamed suddenly as his body trembled violently. His red clothes were drenched in sweat and his hate-filled gaze suddenly became completely blank, as though he had been controlled by a form of spell.

Following that, a bolt of lightning wandered around Fu Chi as crackling sounds could be heard. Suddenly, an illusionary Thunder Dragon appeared above his head. The Thunder Dragon roared, as though it wasn’t willing to leave Fu Chi’s body; however, under the urging of Yang Kai’s Dragon Language, it was forced to slowly separate itself from Fu Chi as its eyes were filled with a sense of pain and fear. In just a short moment, its head had completely manifested.

Apparently, this was Fu Chi’s Dragon Source. Once his Source left his body, he would lose his identity as a Dragon Clan member, which was something more unbearable than death.

“Dragon Punishment!” The expressions of all Dragon Clan members changed drastically as their bodies turned cold, as though their Dragon Blood had been frozen over.

Even after a Dragon Clan member passed away, their Source wouldn’t disappear. It would return to the Dragon Grave and become a kind of formless Source Strength. When a female Dragon became pregnant with a child, the Dragon Clan members would hold a ceremony and communicate with the Dragon Grave so that this Source Strength could be transferred to the fetus.

In other words, although losses would be incurred when a Dragon Clan member passed away, it wasn’t the end for that Dragon Source. However, if the Source was destroyed, it would be gone forever.

That was why even though there were only a small number of Dragon Clan members, they were never truly at risk of going extinct. That was because every deceased Dragon Clan member would leave behind their Source to make their last contribution to sustain the Dragon Clan’s bloodline.

However, with one Source being destroyed, it would mean there would be one fewer Dragon Clan member forever.
