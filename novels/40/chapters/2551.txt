Proud, Yin Le Sheng arrogantly laughed, “Yang Kai, do you think you will live after today?”

A Master proficient in the Dao of Space could tear space at will, but now, he was trapped here. Yin Le Sheng was so filled with joy that it couldn’t be described with mere words.

So, even though he knew that he shouldn’t talk to Yang Kai at this moment, Yin Le Sheng couldn’t help but arrogantly taunt.

Hua Fei Chen, on the other hand, didn’t speak a word as he was constantly looking for a chance to attack.

Yang Kai, blocking the next attack, drew back. He put the Myriads Sword horizontally before his chest, taking a defensive stance, before rebuking with a snort, “The frog at the bottom of the well knows nothing of how vast the sky is. Today, this Young Master will open your useless eyes. Just watch how I break this useless Array of yours!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Saying so, he flipped his hand as a bracelet suddenly appeared. Although bracelets were usually artifacts worn by women, this bracelet didn’t appear to be suitable for women to wear because it was filled with mysterious runes and was surging with Spiritual Energy. One could tell that it was a powerful Emperor Artifact at a glance.

“You still dare to be so arrogant?” Yin Le Sheng was enraged. With the cover of Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array, Yin Le Sheng sneaked close to Yang Kai, but just as he raised his hand, preparing to launch a sneak attack, he suddenly heard a buzzing noise ringing next to his ear.

That buzzing sound was extremely strange, as if countless tiny insects were flying over.

“What is this?” Yin Le Sheng raised his brow, and lest he found himself in another troublesome situation, he didn’t dare to make a move and rather pulled back.

“Something that will take your dog life!” Yang Kai sneered, standing on the spot, waving his hands to release countless black insects from the bracelet.

The bracelet was naturally the Insect Enslavement Bracelet, and the black insects were naturally the evolved Soul Devouring Demon Insects.

When he was besieged by the countless Yin Souls in the cave before, Yang Kai suddenly wondered whether his Soul Devouring Insects would have a restraining effect against them.

Soul Devouring Insects fed on Spiritual Energy, and could even swallow Demon Qi.

As for Yin Souls, to a certain extent, they were just a mass of Spiritual Energy.

However, earlier, there were too many eyes on him. If the Soul Devouring Insects did not take a fancy to the Yin Souls, his secret would be exposed with him not being able to kill all the onlookers.

But now, there were only two that were watching, so Yang Kai secretly released a few Soul Devouring Insects earlier while dealing with Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen, waiting for the results.

After giving it a try, it went as he had expected. The Yin Souls were simply delicious dishes laid out for the Soul Devouring Insects. Not only did the Soul Devouring Insects devour the Yin Souls gleefully, they also seemed able to devour the black Qi as well.

They loved this type of energy too.

Now that the result of his experiment was already out, naturally, Yang Kai would no longer be polite to the Netherworld Sect. The next moment, countless Soul Devouring Demon Insects flew out, swarming in every direction. The insects rushed forward like a pack of hungry wolves charging into the flock of sheep, catching each and every Yin Soul wandering around.

In a flash, miserable wails sounded everywhere. Although these Yin Souls were devoid of the sentience they had when they were still alive, they still screamed when they were being eaten, giving jitters to the listeners.

Both Yin Le Sheng and Hua Fei Chen were shocked. They had no idea what was going on. All they understood was that their side was taking heavy losses.

With having no idea of what was happening, they didn’t dare to rashly attack anymore, lest what Yang Kai said came true.

“What’s going on?” Helpless, Hua Fei Chen could only ask the twenty or so disciples managing the Array.

Only they knew about the situation inside the Array, because they were the ones who had arranged it. More importantly, the foundation of the Array was made up of their artifacts, so it could even be said that their lives were related to the array, their life and death tied to it.

“It’s very bad, Elder Hua!” A disciple cried in horror, “That guy has suddenly released a swarm of insects.”

“A swarm of insects?” Hua Fei Chen’s eyes widened in shock before he furiously shouted, “Why are you making a fuss about a few insects? Just kill them!”

[What a bunch of wastes! Even an Emperor Realm Master can be killed inside the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array, and you are afraid of a bunch of insects? The disciples taken into the Sect over these past few years have really dropped in standard.]

That disciple added with trepidation, “Elder, these insects can’t be killed. Rather they are devouring the banner’s Yin Souls.”

“What!?”

Hua Fei Chen was taken aback this time. The Yin Souls inside the black ball were the ones from each Netherworld Purgatory Banner and were completely intangible. They were identical to the Yin Souls found in the Ancient Lands Passageway, an accumulation of grievances after a person’s death. They were sinister and treacherous, not good to provoke.

Yet there were actually insects in this world that could swallow Yin Souls stored within the banners?

What kind of insects were they?

Before Hua Fei Chen could ask any further questions, he suddenly felt a chill coming over from the front, rushing straight at him.

Hua Fei Chen was greatly shocked and immediately shouted, “Junior! You dare to sneak attack me!?”

Evidently, this chill was the result of Yang Kai’s sneak attack, and while shouting, Hua Fei Chen hurriedly blocked the oncoming strike. A deafening clap of thunder immediately followed and his eyes bulged in shock so wide that the corners of them almost cracked. Much to Hua Fei Chen’s shock and dismay, he was actually pushed back.

This was the first head-on confrontation between Yang Kai and him as all the previous clashes were just him sneak-attacking, taking advantage of the concealment of the Array. Therefore, he hadn’t expected Yang Kai to be this powerful.

[Is he even human?] Hua Fei Chen couldn’t help but find it surreal, as if he was dreaming.

Yang Kai broke into laughter as he taunted, “If you can do it, why can’t I? What’s so strange about me sneak attacking you? Does Elder Hua think that this Young Master should just stick his neck out and let you cut it off?”

The corners of Hua Fei Chen’s lips twitched, but he couldn’t help but agree with a snort, “That would be best.”

Yang Kai meaningfully grinned and said, “Then it would depend on whether you even have the strength to make me!”

As he spoke, his figure flickered as he attacked him with an earth-shattering momentum. Somehow or the other, he had accurately grasped Hua Fei Chen’s location.

Hua Fei Chen was greatly shocked and hurriedly shouted, “Martial Nephew Yin, help me!”

A Second-Order Emperor Realm Master was attacked by an enemy, who was one Minor Realm below him, inside a Spirit Array his allies controlled, yet he was still calling for his Martial Nephew’s help. Hua Fei Chen felt like he lost all face at this moment.

But compared to his life, his face was simply nothing.

Naturally, Yin Le Sheng wouldn’t let Hua Fei Chen take risks alone and promptly rushed over after hearing this cry for help while fiercely shouted, “Yang Kai! Don’t go too far!”

Martial Nephew and Uncle instantly teamed up, their Emperor Qi surging as they launched one Netherworld Sect Secret Technique after another against Yang Kai, locking him in a fierce struggle.

Deafening claps of thunder rang out one after another as violent energy fluctuations spread outward.

Strange looks appeared on the faces of Old Fu and the girl named Lin’er, who were hovering in the air.

Old Fu furrowed his brow, criticizing, “What the Hell are those from the Netherworld Sect doing?”

“A bunch of wastes!” The girl named Lin’er ground her teeth and cursed.

She had even taken out an Emperor Artifact, the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, to help, but she hadn’t expected for the Netherworld Sect to be unable to take down Yang Kai even after this. This really caused her to look down on them.

“Young Lady, do you want this Old Master to help them out?” Old Fu inquiringly asked.

Judging by the shockwaves and rumblings, the chances of Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng being able to defeat Yang Kai anytime soon appeared bleak. At any rate, Old Fu was a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, and if he helped them now, they would definitely be able to suppress Yang Kai.

“No need,” the girl named Lin’er refused, “This Young Lady has already personally given them a hand, which is already giving them a lot of face. Why should you intervene too? If they still can’t win, these guys from the Netherworld Sect are truly useless.”

Old Fu didn’t dare to violate her order, so all he could do was bow his head and agree.

Right then, a cry of shock sounded.

Old Fu’s pupils shrank as he looked toward the source of the cry. The next moment, he saw the twenty or so Netherworld Sect disciples, who were presiding over the Array, stumble as if they were struck by lightning. Their faces were pale as paper and large beads of sweat were rolling down their foreheads while blood could also be seen coming out of the corners of their lips.

They seemed to have suffered serious injuries.

“What happened?” Old Fu stared with widened eyes, unable to understand what was going on.

One of the Netherworld Sect disciples cried for help, “Elder! Please… Save us! The Yin Souls within our banners are about to be completely devoured! Ple-”

The Netherworld Sect disciples’ lives and cultivation were tied to their Netherworld Purgatory Banners, so while their strength might be greatly enhanced with them, if their Netherworld Purgatory Banner was damaged, they would have to bear an extremely serious backlash.

They were just presiding over the array and weren’t directly clashing with Yang Kai.

But the Soul Devouring Insects released by Yang Kai were constantly devouring their banners’ Yin Souls, and at an extremely fast pace at that.

This disciple was rather unlucky, as all the Yin Souls released by him were devoured clean by the Soul Devouring Insects, resulting in serious damage to his Netherworld Purgatory Banner. He even had to bear a tremendous backlash.

Before he could finish talking, a streak of black light suddenly shot over from that enormous black ball.

It was the very same Netherworld Purgatory Banner that was tied to his life and cultivation.

But when this disciple saw his artifact, not only did he not feel the slightest joy, but he appeared as if he had seen something extremely horrifying, hurriedly got up, turned around, and fled.

The approaching Netherworld Purgatory Banner seemed to be sentient as it chased right after him.

In the blink of an eye, the Netherworld Purgatory Banner had already caught up with the Netherworld Sect disciple.

*Hong…*

The Netherworld Purgatory Banner blew up into a cloud of pitch black energy, enveloping the Netherworld Sect disciple.

“Ahhh!!!!…” A heart-rending scream immediately resounded. It sounded extremely miserable, as if the one caught in it was subjected to the most terrifying torture in the world.

The pitch-black energy was like black flames that were attached to this disciple, they couldn’t be put out and were like poisonous vipers that were invading his body through every pore and orifice.

Miserably screaming, the Netherworld Sect disciple kept rolling on the ground, scratching his cheeks with his hands.

He was scratching very hard, clawing his flesh and skin, and in the blink of an eye, his entire face was mangled; even his bones could be seen.

“What… what’s happening to him?” On the other side, the red-robed girl, who was controlling the Taiyi Cinnamon Bowl, turned pale and couldn’t help but ask in a trembling voice.

She had never seen such a horrible sight.

If a person wasn’t in such excruciating pain that his mind couldn’t process it, how could he do such a horrible thing to himself?

“Ten Thousand Ghosts Biting Backlash!” Old Fu too nervously gulped as he added in shock, “He is finished.”

The Netherworld Purgatory Banner was greatly damaged, so much so that even its owner had received a horrible backlash. This backlash was even more unbearable than falling into a hot wok filled with oil.

While he was speaking, the black energy on that disciple converged, completely seeping into his body all of a sudden. Right after, he screamed even more miserably, tossing and turning on the ground, clawing off pieces of his own flesh. Very soon, the ground was dyed red.
