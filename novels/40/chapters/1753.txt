“Deal?” Yang Kai frowned, “What deal?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You really forgot?” Xue Yue looked at him and sneered dismissively, “So that’s how it is, it looks like you were too busy flirting with that enchantress from Monster Emperor Star and completely forgot about what I said.”

Yang Kai grinned as he said, “Is that jealousy I hear...”

“Don’t flatter yourself!” Xue Yue yelled angrily.

“However, how did you know that she came from Monster Emperor Star? Did you investigate her later?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her.

“Did I even need to?” Xue Yue raised her chin slightly and coldly snorted, “Where else but Monster Emperor Star could you find that kind of shameless enchantress?”

“Seems you did inquire about her...” Yang Kai muttered to himself. “Forget it, enough about that. I remember the deal you mentioned.”

“Took you long enough, where is it now then?”

“You mean the Stone Tablet which came out of the Stone Monument?”

“Yes!”

Yang Kai frowned slightly. Naturally, he remembered the scene from that time and about the transaction between himself and Xue Yue. Xue Yue had said at the time that as long as he handed over the stone tablet, the grievances between her and Yang Kai would be wiped clean and she would never trouble him again.

At that time, Yang Kai had also agreed, but before he could hand the stone tablet over to Xue Yue, the Emperor Garden closed without warning, resulting in them being unable to complete the exchange.

Later, Yang Kai learned that what was hidden in the stone tablet was the shocking Star Refining Art Secret Technique!

This was a supreme Secret Technique which allowed one to refine a Star Source, thus becoming a Star Master. Little Senior Sister Xia Ning Chang had been able to refine Tong Xuan Realm’s Star Source at the Saint King Realm for two reasons, one was because Tong Xuan Realm had grown incredibly weak and second because of the Star Refining Art.

If either of these two factors had been missing, with Xia Ning Chang’s cultivation at the time, she would not have been able to successfully refine Tong Xuan Realm’s Star Source and become its Star Master.

This was undoubtedly a Secret Technique that could shake the very foundation of the Star Field and set off a massive, bloody war. Its value was simply immeasurable.

Knowing nothing about the Star Refining Art, Yang Kai had not had any qualms about exchanging it for his peace of mind, but now that he did, it was, of course, impossible for him to hand it over easily, even if the other party was Xue Yue.

The relationship between the two of them was still somewhat unclear, so how could Yang Kai just give her such an incredible Secret Technique casually?

“Do you know what is recorded on that stone tablet?” Yang Kai asked seriously.

“I don’t know!” Xue Yue shook her head.

“You don’t know but you still want it?”

“Although I do not know what is recorded on it, I know it is the key to allowing my father to break through to the Third-Order Origin King! So, I have to obtain it!”

“President Ai Ou?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Xue Yue’s father was naturally President Ai Ou of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. Yang Kai had heard about this famous character before but had never met him. Currently, what Yang Kai knew was that Ai Ou was a Second-Order Origin King that had been unable to break through to the Third-Order for many years. Even so, with the backing of Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, Ai Ou was not an existence that could be underestimated.

“Yes, so I hope you can give me that stone tablet so I can give it to my father!” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai sincerely.

“How can you be so certain of what is recorded on it? Why are you confident that your father can break through to the Third-Order after obtaining it? You don’t even know what it is.”

Xue Yue smiled and said, “My Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce has a glorious inheritance stretching back over ten thousand years, so we possess some information that is not known to the public. This is something you should understand.”

Yang Kai nodded as he pondered to himself.

In a sense, Xue Yue was right. The Star Refining Art may really be the key to Ai Ou’s breakthrough to the Third Order; after all, with the identity and heritage of Ai Ou, a veteran Origin King, and the Star Refining Art, it would not be impossible for him to refine a Star Source, and once he succeeded, he would surely be able to successfully break through after receiving the blessings from that Star Source.

Of course, there would be some unavoidable risks involved in this process, risks that could result in his very Soul being extinguished.

After understanding this though, Yang Kai was also secretly surprised by the information held by Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce. The Star Refining Art was sealed in a Stone Monument deep inside the Emperor Garden, and before the Stone Monument was smashed, Yang Kai had not noticed anything out of the ordinary about it, but it seemed Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce knew about it in advance.

“I hope you can give me that thing!” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai sincerely, “Even if it’s just a copy, it doesn’t matter. That stone tablet recorded some kind of Secret Technique or Secret Art, right? If that is the case, I don’t need the original stone tablet ontology, a copy will be enough.”

“I need to think about this,” Yang Kai thought for a while before saying.

“No problem,” Xue Yue readily agreed. “But before you make a decision, you’ll have to act together with me.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “With Ni Guang watching, I think it’s impossible for me to get away from you.”

“Who knows, your strongest talent is definitely escaping from trouble, so if I’m not careful, you’ll certainly try to flee,” Xue Yue snorted softly, “That’s why I let Uncle Ni invite you.”

This was Xue Yue’s main purpose in having Ni Guang invite Yang Kai to travel with them! When she saw Yang Kai arrive, Xue Yue knew that it was the perfect opportunity for her to finish the business between them.

“Since we have reached an agreement, let’s go back. The entrance to that place will open soon. Once we enter, do not run around aimlessly,” Yue Xue warned sternly.

“Understood.”

Soon after, the pair returned to the vicinity of the entrance again. Ni Guang still had his eyes closed while Luo Lan also stood aside and waited quietly. Seeing the two reappear, Luo Lan just gently nodded and did not ask anything.

“Xue Yue,” Yang Kai suddenly approached Xue Yue and called out softly.

“What do you want?” Xue Yue asked slightly nervously, frowning as she asked, “Can you not get so close?”

Yang Kai glanced at her strangely before asking, “Who are the people here. Do you know?”

Xue Yue said, “Some I know, some I don’t.”

“Then that person... do you know who he is?” Yang Kai said while glancing towards a certain direction.

Xue Yue quietly glanced over in the direction Yang Kai had looked and found an Origin King Realm master covered in thick black Qi with his face completely concealed. The black Qi around this man was like a living creature, twisting and churning in indistinct patterns, giving off an uncomfortable aura that made those nearby shudder.

“I’ve never seen or heard of him,” Xue Yue shivered involuntarily, and whispered back, “Why? Is there something wrong with him?”

“I don’t know if I’m thinking too much, but I’ve felt like he was paying attention to me for a while now,” Yang Kai frowned.

Xue Yue was stunned. Naturally, she didn’t think Yang Kai was imagining things. Yang Kai’s strength was not weak, and if someone was spying on him, he would definitely sense something, so since he had said so, it was very likely the master wrapped in black Qi was paying attention to him.

As if to confirm Yang Kai’s statement, when Xue Yue secretly stole a glance towards the other party, from the thick black Qi a strange, grating cackle rang out.

Xue Yue’s face turned pale.

“This person... is very dangerous. Don’t provoke him,” Ni Guang suddenly opened his eyes and whispered in a serious tone.

“Uncle Ni, what is his background?” Xue Yue asked.

“I don’t know,” Ni Guang shook his head, “Of all the Origin Kings I know and know of, none of them are similar to this person, but... this old master can tell he is very strong, possibly not weaker than me.”

“So, he’s also a Second-Order Origin King?”

“I can’t say for certain if he is a Second-Order, only if I fought with him would I be able to confirm it,” Ni Guang said slowly, “Regardless, don’t provoke him. This person’s aura is filled with cold, evil energy, so he must have cultivated some kind of demonic Secret Art.”

“I understand,” Xue Yue nodded obediently.

Next, in order to prevent Yang Kai from provoking someone who he shouldn’t, Xue Yue carefully introduced him to the origins and identities of the Origin Kings present. There were more than ten people present and Xue Yue knew eight of them. The rest she was not certain about but was able to make some guesses.

Yang Kai made sure to remember the appearances and identities of these masters in mind, in case of emergencies.

Outside the entrance, everyone continued to wait quietly.

From time to time, a new Origin King would rush over, find an open spot, and close their eyes to rest.

About three days later, a bright stream of purple light, which was particularly eye-catching, suddenly appeared from the distant Starry Sky.

When this purple light appeared, Ni Guang suddenly opened his eyes and stared deeply towards it, a slight frown appearing on his face as he coldly muttered, “That old dog also came...”

He seemed to know the identity of this person at a glance.

“Oh well, since he’s come, we can get started,” Ni Guang muttered again.

The aura which radiated from this purple stream of light was extremely powerful, not at all under Ni Guang’s, so it was apparent that whoever had arrived was a master at the Second-Order Origin King Realm. Aware of this, the faces of the First-Order Origin Kings who had already arrived changed slightly. Only the figure wrapped in black Qi let out a strange laugh, not caring at all about this new arrival.

Soon, the purple light arrived nearby and came to a stop before rapidly dissipating, revealing two figures.

Both of these two had a similar body shape, strong and burly, as if they had been carved from the same mould. On top of that, they both shared the same long purple hair which draped down over their shoulders, giving them a free and unrestrained appearance.

The two looked like brothers.

However, if one looked closely, they would realize this was not the case, because the cultivation gap between the two was quite large. One of them was a Second-Order Origin King while the other was just a Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator, the same as Xue Yue and Yang Kai.

After these two appeared, their eyes swept around the crowd and soon fixed on the pair from Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce.

Ni Guang and the Second-Order Origin King master exchanged looks...

Xue Yue’s gaze collided with the Third-Order Origin Realm cultivator...

Neither side showed weakness, not even flinching, their expressions remaining calm.

“Hahaha!” A loud burst of laughter sounded soon after as the purple-haired Second-Order Origin King boldly called out, “It seems this old master has come a little late and made everyone wait.”

“No one was waiting for you, Zi Long. Stop flattering yourself!” Ni Guang sneered.

“Oh, I thought Brother Ni would have wished I had come here sooner,” Zi Long grinned meaningfully.
