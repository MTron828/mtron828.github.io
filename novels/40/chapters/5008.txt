With such thoughts in mind, rather than feel grateful to Bai Yi, the three Feudal Lords became even more resentful towards her.

Because this would only make their Territory Lord think that Bai Yi was being considerate and that they were being petty.

Naturally, Bai Yi would not be so kind. She would happily do anything to borrow Zhu Feng’s hand to make these Feudal Lords suffer, but her plan with Yang Kai was far more important right now. Adding on the fact that Black Ink Strength was constantly encroaching on her Small Universe inside of the Sealed World, she simply could not hold on for long, so she could not be bothered to stir up any trouble.

Now, all that was left was for them to put their plan into action. If they were too slow, then they would never get this chance again.

When Zhu Feng, who was hiding in the Black Ink Nest, heard this, he was silent for a moment before speaking, “In that case, all of you withdraw. Guard this place carefully and do not let anyone else disturb my healing.”

The three Feudal Lords hastily abided by his orders.

Bai Yi, however, spoke up, “Master, I would like to offer you this Human that I have captured.”

Zhu Feng answered flatly, “That is very thoughtful of you. Keep him in captivity for now, we shall wait until I have recovered from my injuries.”

“Master!” Bai Yi cut in again, “This Human is strong and has a high position on the enemy side. He should know what means the Humans have been using in recent years to resist the corruption of Black Ink Strength. If it is convenient for Master, please convert him first and ask him for the answer. In this way, the other Territory Lords will also not be able to take advantage of this opportunity to snatch away your rightful merits.”

Zhu Feng was badly injured and in a hurry to recover, so he was a little annoyed at having Bai Yi object to his orders; however, after hearing her words, he began to ponder.

Bai Yi was right. It was true that the Black Ink Clan had been extremely curious about what mysterious means the Humans had been using to resist the corruption of Black Ink Strength during these recent years. Men Xie himself had personally ordered the Territory Lords under him to figure out the truth of the matter; however, the Black Ink Clan had been unable to capture a single Human recently, thus they were never able to figure anything out.

Since the last war, the Human that Bai Yi captured could be said to be the very first, and he was even in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Indeed, Humans in the Seventh Order held high positions in their race. It was enough for one to become a Squad Leader or even a Battalion Commander. There was a good chance that a Human like this would know something.

If he could squeeze the answer to that mystery out of this Human, then it would be a great merit indeed. Zhu Feng’s injuries were severe, and even with the Black Ink Nest’s help, it would still take him a year and a half just to stabilize himself. By that time, another Territory Lord might have already discovered the answer.

To lay aside merits that were in front of his eyes without taking them and let another Territory Lord profit, Zhu Feng would naturally be unwilling.

There was merely a short pause before Zhu Feng made up his mind, “Bring him inside.”

“Yes!” Bai Yi answered reverently. Then, under the envious and resentful eyes of the three Feudal Lords, she flew straight towards the Black Ink Nest.

The closer she got to the Black Ink Nest, the denser the Black Ink Strength became. Yang Kai, who was dragged along, could faintly sense her situation and felt concerned for her.

He had no idea how much longer Bai Yi could hold out, but it was obviously not much longer. So, this battle had to be a quick one. Only then would they be able to resolve the situation before Bai Yi turned into a Black Ink Disciple again.

Fortunately, though there were changes in their plan, the general progression of it was going smoothly.

Below the huge flower bud-like Black Ink Nest was a rootstalk-like tunnel that was connected to the ground. The root looked like flesh, yet not, and it was exuding an extremely sinister aura.

Bai Yi entered the opening below the Black Ink Nest with Yang Kai in tow and walked up through the rootstalk-like passage.

A short while later, they arrived in a large and spacious area.

Even though Yang Kai had seen Black Ink Nests many times before from a distance, this was the first time he had ever been inside of one, so he observed his surroundings carefully.

The space inside was filled with such rich Black Ink Strength that it was practically liquid. It was tumbling and surging in the space, and seemed to be flowing towards a certain point under an invisible force that was fervently devouring it.

At the source of the pull was a huge figure who was sitting down cross-legged.

The man had a majestic and imposing figure, but there was a weakness enveloping him that could not be concealed. Who else could this figure be if not Zhu Feng, who had escaped with dire injuries?

When the two of them entered, the Black Ink Strength permeating the hall was pouring into Zhu Feng’s large body.

“Master,” Bai Yi walked up to Zhu Feng and knelt down on one knee, bowing her head.

Yang Kai was set down in front of her, lying quietly. As their eyes met, Yang Kai’s chest tightened because he could see a darkness looming in Bai Yi’s pupils.

In less than half a cup of tea’s time since they entered the Sealed World, Bai Yi was nearing her limit. Once the Black Ink Strength fully seized her Small Universe, she would surely transform into a Black Ink Disciple once again.

“So this is the Human that you captured?” Zhu Feng lowered his head and looked down on them, his huge figure exerting intense pressure.

“Yes!” Bai Yi trembled, seemingly intimidated by Zhu Feng’s might; however, Yang Kai knew that it was just her struggling to maintain the clarity of her mind.

“This Human is in the Seventh-Order?” Zhu Feng asked another question.

Yang Kai was about to curse this guy’s mother for blabbering non-stop instead of converting him directly. Hateful!

“There is no doubt about it,” Bai Yi answered.

Zhu Feng naturally did not doubt her. As his Black Ink Disciple, Bai Yi could not hide anything from him, so he was willing to trust what Bai Yi said to be true. Even if he were suspicious of the Feudal Lords under him, he would definitely not doubt his own Black Ink Disciple.

Even though Black Ink Disciples had low status within the Black Ink Clan, they at least had no need to worry about their loyalty.

“You did well,” Zhu Feng praised Bai Yi with a tender look on his face. Previously, it was Bai Yi’s arrow that came out at the key moment that hurt Xu Bo Liang which allowed him to escape from the Division Commander by creating an opening.

“It was merely my duty,” Bai Yi’s head hung low, and the hair in front of her forehead cast a shadow over her face that blocked the light in her eyes. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhu Feng nodded lightly. Without further ado, he spat out a mouthful of dense Black Ink Strength in Yang Kai’s direction, which flowed incessantly like a living creature, burrowing into Yang Kai’s seven orifices and pores.

Yang Kai struggled but to no avail. Soon, he became still.

A short while later, Zhu Feng stopped; however, after spitting out that mouthful of Black Ink Strength, his aura had clearly weakened a little. Converting a Seventh-Order Human seemed to have been burdensome on his current state.

Zhu Feng raised his hand slightly and ordered, “Untie him.”

Since he had been converted into a Black Ink Disciple, Yang Kai was on his side now.

Obeying his order, Bai Yi released the sealing Secret Technique around Yang Kai’s body. In fact, she was going to do so even without Zhu Feng’s order.

“Master!” Yang Kai was well versed in disguising himself as a Black Ink Disciple, and he naturally knew how he should present himself at this moment.

“Now tell me, what means are the Humans using in order to resist the corruption of Black Ink Strength? Why is it that our Black Ink Clan has been unable to gain a single Black Ink Disciple after such a long time?” Zhu Feng looked apathetically at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai answered respectfully, “That is the latest Secret Technique researched by the Human Race. This subordinate has also cultivated it. If it is convenient, then this subordinate is willing to demonstrate it for Master to see!”

Zhu Feng was surprised, “Oh? You have cultivated it too?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai responded.

Zhu Feng nodded, “Then demonstrate it for me.”

“As Master wishes!” Yang Kai cupped his fist and spread his hands out. Two seals floated up from the back of his hands, and in the next instant, a dazzling yellow light lit up on his left hand, while his right hand shone a vibrant blue.

When both hands came together, the two lights fused, transforming into a pure white light. All of a sudden, it felt as if a small sun had appeared inside of the Black Ink Nest.

Zhu Feng’s heart clenched tight.

In fact, when Yang Kai activated the seals on both his left and right hands, he instinctively felt a sense of unease; however, it was only when the white light appeared that his unease grew palpable.

Under the envelopment of the white light, Black Ink Strength turned into nothingness. The flesh walls around the Black Ink Nest contracted violently as if they were being eroded by a terrifying heat, emitting a chatter as the entire Black Ink Nest began to shake.

“This is…” Zhu Feng was shocked. That white light was a great threat to him. When his body was exposed to the white light, he was overtaken by a violent pain. The Black Ink Strength in his body melted just like snowflakes under a bright sun.

Before he could work out what was going on, the sun-like white light rapidly grew before his eyes.

“Please observe as closely as you wish, Master!” Following Yang Kai’s shout, the Purifying Light exploded out.

In an instant, Zhu Feng’s roar resounded throughout the Sealed World.

At the same time, Bai Yi, who had been kneeling on the ground, jumped to her feet and pulled the bow in her hands. A golden glow turned into a pillar of light that was blasted straight in Zhu Feng’s direction.

After Yang Kai had finished performing Purifying Light, he summoned his Azure Dragon Spear while using his Golden Crow Casts the Sun Divine Manifestation at the same time. Guiding the great sun with his spear, Yang Kai stabbed it towards Zhu Feng mercilessly.

The combination of both his and Bai Yi’s strength burst out in an instant and contained terrifying killing power.

With an aura of death looming over his head, there was no way that Zhu Feng did not know that he had been tricked. He did not understand how a Human could withstand the corruption of his Black Ink Strength, much less how Bai Yi, who had been following him for so many years, would suddenly betray him; however, at the critical moment between life or death, he still unleashed the terrifying might of a Territory Lord.

His large body moved forcibly while he threw out a fist, and a terrifying power burst forth, causing space to tremble and rupture.

Outside of the Black Ink Nest, the three Feudal Lords stood together with bitter looks on their faces. They were unable to gain any benefits from Bai Yi this time and instead owed her a favour, which was exceptionally displeasing for them.

However, now that Bai Yi had been called into the Black Ink Nest by Zhu Feng, there was nothing the Feudal Lords could do despite their displeasure. Bai Yi was highly valued by the Territory Lord to begin with, and now that she was able to capture a Seventh-Order Human, her status was likely to rise even higher in the coming days. She might even be able to sit on top of their heads from now on.

How could the three Feudal Lords bear to endure having a lowly Human lord over them?

However, they did not know what they could do at this moment. While they were feeling at a loss, a loud bang suddenly came from the Black Ink Nest.

The three Feudal Lords were startled by the commotion and quickly turned their heads over; then, what they saw instantly sent chills down their spines as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.
