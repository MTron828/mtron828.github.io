Chapter 1648, Acting Contrary To One’s Principles

Ran Yun Ting’s expression remained unchanged as she stared at Yang Kai coldly and snorted, “Is that all?”

The arrival of her fellow Elder’s had let her see hope of killing Yang Kai again.

“Die!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted.

The other four coloured auras circulating around his body shot forth and poured into the golden sword light, merging together with it.

A five coloured sword light took shape immediately!

This sword of light now contained the power of all five elements, each mutually reinforcing one another in an endless cycle, causing the power of the sword light to rapidly increase.

*Kacha...*

The ice wall protecting Ran Yun Ting immediately began to crack.

Ran Yun Ting paled in horror as Bing Long and the other Elders stared dumbfounded.

With a bang, the ice wall was completely shattered and the five coloured light pierced towards Ran Yun Ting’s brow again with unparalleled sharpness.

Just as Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder’s life was about to end, however, an ethereal jade white hand suddenly appeared.

This jade hand was completely flawless and seemed to only reach out lightly, as if it was trying to pick up a trivial object.

An extremely mysterious and indescribable power pulsed from the jade hand.

The five coloured sword light, which had easily shattered the ice wall, was grasped by this jade hand, and no matter how it struggled, it was unable to advance any further.

“Young man, when possible one should let others off, why must you insist on killing ruthlessly?” A chilly female voice sounded.

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed deeply.

Having tread upon the gates of death, Ran Yun Ting was sweating profusely, but after seeing this jade hand and hearing this cold female voice, she was suddenly overjoyed and shouted, “Disciple thanks Supreme Elder for her assistance and humbly requests Supreme Elder kill this evil creature who dared violate our Ice Heart Valley!”

[Supreme Elder?]

Yang Kai’s expression became serious as he turned to look in a certain direction but was unable to see any kind of figure there.

He knew that there was a Supreme Elder in Ice Heart Valley, one that was an Origin King; however, she was still just a First-Order.

Yang Kai had even offended a character like Luo Hai and escaped from his pursuit across the vast Star Field, so no matter how powerful Ice Heart Valley’s Origin King was, she was not enough to frighten him.

This was also why he dared to come to Ice Heart Valley!

Still, he had to raise his guard and began condensing his Saint Qi quietly!

On the other hand, Bing Long was experiencing a great shock, and fearing that Supreme Elder would really kill Yang Kai in a rage, she quickly called out, “Supreme Elder please wait, there may be some misunderstanding here. This Bing Long requests she be able to handle this matter!”

The existence of Yang Kai was too important and Bing Long did not dare let him die casually.

The cold female voice sounded again, but this time she did not speak and instead just sighed. The jade white hand which was gripping the five coloured sword light also faded away.

With a thought, Yang Kai took back the five-coloured light into his body while glaring at Ran Yun Ting coldly.

The other party stared back at him with gritted teeth, looking extremely unwilling.

It seemed she was quite upset that Supreme Elder had not directly killed Yang Kai; after all, Yang Kai was truly acting rampantly just now. In front of everyone’s eyes, he tried to kill her, the Sect’s Great Elder.

Ran Yun Ting absolutely could not tolerate such provocations and insults.

However, facing the decision of the Supreme Elder, she did not dare to have any objections and could only choke down her annoyance.

A beautiful figure suddenly flew over from the distance, and as if he could sense her approach, Yang Kai turned to look at her and the shocking murderous intent which was leaking from his body instantly disappeared, as if it was never there in the first place, and he flashed a gentle smile.

As he gazed upon this figure, his eyes turned as soft as water.

Unable to adapt to this sudden transformation, Bing Long and the others could not help frowning, wondering what was happening.

Following his gaze, Bing Long showed a thoughtful expression after seeing the situation there clearly.

Ran Yun Ting also saw the face of the incoming person and her expression became sullen. Just as she was about to shout something, she suddenly felt a sharp gaze land on her.

Turning her head, she saw Yang Kai staring at her, giving off an aura that seemed to scream, “If you dare open your mouth, I’ll kill you.” Ran Yun Ting choked on her words and swallowed them back down as she quietly gulped.

She couldn’t be certain whether she was just imagining it or not, but at that moment, she felt as if she was being stared at by an ominous beast, and that if she provoked Yang Kai again, even Supreme Elder wouldn’t be able to save her life.

This thought was quite disturbing to her...

The beautiful figure coming from the distance only took a moment before she arrived and stood in front of Yang Kai, staring at him with wet eyes as she bit her lip lightly. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Looking at him, her always ice cold, indifferent face showed a rare smile.

The beautiful scenery of Pure Ice Island was instantly overshadowed when this smile appeared.

Countless Pure Ice Island Outer Island disciples fell into a daze upon seeing this sight.

“Heavens, Su Yan smiled? She can actually smile? And at a man!”

“I thought she would never smile; does she know this man?”

“What’s their relationship, and why do they look so close?”

“Su Yan has a man outside? Unimaginable.”

“No wonder she was punished by Great Elder, all Inner Island disciples are forbidden from having close contact with men without permission.”

“Who the hell is this guy, actually able to touch Su Yan’s heart...”

...

Whispers spread from all directions, turning Ran Yun Ting’s face green while Bing Long simply shook her head and sighed.

The remaining Elders all exchanged looks amongst themselves as well. None of them were aware that Su Yan and Yang Kai knew each other before their reunion. The sudden appearance of such a scene really shocked them.

In the sky, under the gaze of countless eyes, Yang Kai stretched out a hand towards Su Yan.

A faint blush appeared on Su Yan’s snow-white cheeks, but the indescribably yearning she felt overcame her natural shyness and she flew forward and fell into Yang Kai’s embrace.

The two held each other tightly!

After more than thirty years, the two from High Heaven Pavilion once again reunited.

As if embracing their entire world, they tightly held one another!

A cold wind swept through, whipping up the freshly fallen snow as all of Pure Ice Island fell silent, everyone’s eyes fixed on the sight of the young man and woman floating up above.

The picture was mesmerizing, and the atmosphere was warm enough to even dispel the chill in the air, filling everyone’s heart with warmth.

Ran Yun Ting’s expression darkened, and she turned towards Bing Long as if she wanted to say something, but seeing Bing Long’s helpless appearance, she eventually held her tongue.

“Su Yan, you cheap slut, come back here!”

“You’ll be punished if you dare act like this!”

Two abrupt voices sounded, shattering the serene scene.

Many disciples of Ice Heart Valley glared towards the source of this sound, secretly blaming these two for recklessly destroying the atmosphere here.

In two flashes of light, the two women who just called out raced over.

After seeing the situation here, however, both Zhou Yun Xuan and the other woman who were charged with guarding Su Yan stared blankly, obviously never having expected so many of the Sect’s leaders to already be present.

It was not an exaggeration to say that all of the Sect’s Elders were here.

The two of them looked at each other, then towards Ran Yun Ting timidly.

Regardless of anything else, it was a fact that Ran Yun Ting highly valued Su Yan, so them insulting Su Yan in front of Ran Yun Ting would likely lead them to being punished.

However, at a glance, the two women were overjoyed.

Ran Yun Ting did not seem to hear what they said just now or care about their presence at all. On the contrary, she was staring in a certain direction with eyes that were almost spitting flames, clearly completely enraged.

Following her line of sight, Zhou Yun Xuan gave an exclamation and covered her mouth.

There, she shockingly saw Su Yan hugging a strange man.

This... this was nothing short of rebellion!

Even ordinary Inner Island disciples were not allowed to have close contact with outside men without the permission of their Honoured Masters, and Su Yan was Great Elder’s favourite personal disciple. Her being so intimate with a man with such an identity in public was akin to slapping Great Elder’s face.

Did she still put her Honoured Master in her eyes?

No wonder Great Elder’s face was so ugly.

Considering all this, Zhou Yun Xuan hurriedly said, “Great Elder, Su Yan ignored Junior Sister’s and my dissuasion and insisted on rushing out. We thought she had some urgent matter to attend to, but never did we anticipate that it would turn out to be this. Acting like this in full view of the public, simply shameless! Please punish her, Great Elder!”

Ran Yun Ting’s body trembled as her face grew even angrier.

Why did Zhou Yun Xuan bother to make such pointless comments? If Ran Yun Ting could, she would have already ripped this bastard boy’s corpse into ten thousand pieces!

However, she had no choice now but to accept that she could not kill Yang Kai, only if the Supreme Elder personally took action would that be possible.

Therefore, she remained silent and did not respond to Zhou Yun Xuan.

Zhou Yun Xuan was taken aback, and a trace of suspicion flashed across her face.

Just as she was lost in confusion, a cold voice suddenly reached her ear, “Were you the one who just insulted Su Yan?”

Looking up, Zhou Yun Xuan suddenly noticed that the man with his arms around Su Yan was staring towards her indifferent eyes.

Su Yan seemed to have blocked out everything from the surrounding world and was like a little bird snuggled up beside her man, a contented expression filling her pretty face, as if even if she died immediately, she wouldn’t care.

Being stared at by such eyes, Zhou Yun Xuan couldn’t help feeling an inexplicable chill, and quietly glancing around and discovering that none of the Elders present seemed to have any intention of speaking up, she could only grit her teeth and replied, “I made a careless remark a moment ago.”

Regardless of whether Su Yan was wrong or not, it was indeed a mistake for her to insult her fellow disciple. In front of so many Elders and even the Valley Masters, she did not dare to act presumptuous and immediately admitted her mistake.

“Apologize!” Yang Kai said concisely.

A hint of anger flashed across Zhou Yun Xuan’s face as she snapped back, “What thing are you, how dare you order me around!”

Admitting a mistake and apologizing were two completely different concepts. Zhou Yun Xuan was not willing to apologize to Su Yan in front of so many eyes as that would simply be too embarrassing.

The moment she spoke, though, a resounding bang echoed as Zhou Yun Xuan felt her cheek become numb and her body flew out, tumbling several times through the air before heavily impacting the snow-covered ground.

All of Ice Heart Valley’s Elders paled.

None of them had seen how Yang Kai moved just now, only that this disciple named Zhou Yun Xuan had been sent flying by him.
