These invisible shackles were the World Principles of Shadowed Star, an ethereal and unpredictable force that even an Origin King could not grasp or comprehend fully. Although Yang Kai had now become a Star Master, he still had no way to affect these World Principles.

Yang Kai attempted to break these shackles or disperse them, but ultimately failed.

With a long sigh, Yang Kai took back his Divine Sense, no longer wasting his time. Although this barrier prevented anyone from reaching the Origin King Realm, it was not actually harmful, so he did not need to pay too much attention to it.

Another day passed yet there was still no news from Sea Temple!

Yang Kai finally began to feel a little impatient, but just as he was considering whether he should go to the Sea Temple’s headquarters himself, his brow suddenly furrowed, and he expanded his Divine Sense.

A few thousand kilometres away from Sunrise Island, there was a huge wave almost a thousand metres high, which was quickly closing in. This wave gave off a terrible roar and was being ridden by a large number of figures, at least a hundred in total.

Among these hundred or so people, there were both males and females. The men were quite burly and had clearly non-human features. Each one was several metres tall and had terrifying forms that could cause anyone who saw them to shudder. On the other hand, the women were all great beauties with flawless skin and features. Some appeared pure, others charming, still other seductive, arousing endless reverie.

What concerned Yang Kai though was that this group of individuals were all Origin Realm masters!

Yang Kai initially thought these people were masters from Sea Temple, but after taking a closer look, he found that this was not the case.

These people were not human!

Thinking carefully, Yang Kai suddenly recalled some information.

In the Limitless Ocean of Shadowed Star, not only did the Human Race thrive, but there was also a race called the Sea Clan!

‘Sea Clan’ was a general term that encompassed many different oceanic races. They were born with great affinity to Water Attribute Secret Arts and Martial Skill and lived below the seas, many of them not even having human-like forms.

However, the Sea Clan seldomly interacted with the Human Race, so cultivators from the inland of Shadowed Star would not necessarily see someone from the Sea Clan even once throughout their lifetime. Even human cultivators living on the Limitless Ocean would rarely interact with these people.

Yang Kai observed for a while and found that this Sea Clan group was comprised of about four or five different races. Some were covered with scales while others had long barb-like tails behind them. Still others had pincer-like hands and crab-like legs, making them appear quite strange.

This was also Yang Kai’s first time seeing members of the Sea Clan, so he couldn’t help feeling somewhat interested. He also did not know why they were so aggressively rushing towards Sunrise Island. After observing them for so long though, a burly Sea Clan male who was riding the very front of the giant wave noticed something and turned his eyes towards the sky, sweeping his gaze around as if trying to find whoever was hiding nearby spying on them.

Yang Kai smiled slightly when he saw this and withdrew his gaze.

 For him, no one on Shadowed Star was worthy of his concern. These hundred Sea Clan Origin Returning Realm masters may be an extremely powerful combat force for Sea Temple, but they were nothing to the current Yang Kai.

Above the huge wave, the burly Sea Clan leader frowned as he continued to scan the skies with suspicion on his face.

“Shang Ao, did you discover something?” A woman with an astounding figure and very revealing clothes also glanced upwards and frowned.

Shang Ao shook his head slowly, “It felt like someone was watching us, but I can’t sense any nearby presences. Maybe it was just my imagination.”

The woman was stunned. She understood how strong Shang Ao was. As one of the leaders of the Sea Clan’s Sea God Palace, Shang Ao was one of the strongest masters on all of Shadowed Star, so it was quite odd for his senses to be wrong.

However, since Shang Ao had said so himself, the woman did not bother digging into it, simply frowning slightly as she quietly spoke, “This matter will likely be quite difficult to handle. The princess disappeared near Sunrise Island, and although it is highly likely that she was abducted by those humans. If they refuse to admit to it, what are we to do?”

Shang Ao coldly snorted, “If they dare not admit it, this General will raze Sunshine Island to the ground! Those damn humans should have been chased out of the Limitless Ocean long ago. This is my Sea Clan’s territory!”

“Ha…” The woman sighed deeply, her face full of worries as she stared in the direction of Sunrise Island, secretly praying that her princess had really been abducted by these humans. If she wasn’t, they wouldn’t even have any clues as to where to look next. This time, they had brought a great army to Sunrise Island with the mentality that giving a dead horse medicine can’t harm it, but this was really nothing but a desperation move. If the humans hadn’t, with the great power Sea Temple commanded, Sea God Palace would not dare to start the war lightly with them.

Nevertheless, Shang Ao seemed to have already determined that the princess was taken away by these humans, so it was likely going to be difficult for her to settle this situation peacefully. If the princess could be found, everything would be fine, but if she could not be found, the two titans of the Limitless Ocean may really be set on the path to war.

That massive wave travelled extremely quickly.

When the wave approached to within a thousand kilometres of Sunrise Island, Pang Zhen and the other Elders noticed an abnormality in the surrounding World Energy and quickly rushed out of their respective residences to look into the distance.

A moment later, Pang Zhen’s face changed drastically, “These arrogant Sea Clan bastards dare to attack my Sunrise Island? Quickly activate all the defensive Spirit Arrays!”

As soon as the order was given, a ringing sound spread across Sunrise Island and soon, the entire island was enveloped in a transparent energy barrier. All of the cultivators on the island also deployed around Pang Zhen, each of them wearing solemn expressions as they waited for the Sea Clan’s arrival.

Yang Kai did not know what was happening, so being curious, he also came over to Pang Zhen.

“Sect Master Yang, the Sea Clan seems to have come to stir up trouble. I hope Sect Master Yang can stand back,” Pang Zhen gently persuaded. Yang Kai’s previous proposal was of great interest to him and depending on whether he could push it forward or not, his position in Sea Temple might very well change. However, the key to this proposal was Yang Kai himself, so it was only natural for Pang Zhen to worry about his safety.

“Don’t worry, Island Master Pang can just handle things as he sees fit. I’m only here to observe,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Seeing him like this, Pang Zhen thought for a moment but did not try to persuade him further. After all, Yang Kai had already proved his great strength before.

“Why is the Sea Clan so angry? Did Sunrise Island or Sea Temple provoke them in some way?” Yang Kai asked casually.

Pang Zhen shook his head, “I don’t know, but there has never been a harmonious relationship between Sea Temple and the Sea Clan; after all, we are two different races who both inhabit the Limitless Ocean, so friction is inevitable. However, today’s situation is one this Pang has never seen before. My Sea Temple and the Sea Clan’s Sea God Palace even have some agreements between us, so neither side ever sends out so many masters to deal with the other party.”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered a few times before he seemingly casually remarked, “The Sea Clan’s Sea God Palace should also be able to collect a lot of ocean cultivation resources.”

Pang Zhen’s focus was on why the Sea Clan had dispatched so many masters to Sunrise Island, so he did not think too much about Yang Kai’s comment and nodded, “They have an innate advantage in this regard actually and are able to collect resources from the deepest parts of the sea with ease, something our Sea Temple is incapable of.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Pang Zhen came to his senses and quickly glanced over at Yang Kai only to find him smiling happily. Realizing his gaff, Pang Zhen quickly said, “Sect Master Yang, they are of a different race. Also, the Sea Clan is not easy to deal with. If you want to trade cultivation resources with them, I am afraid it will be quite difficult. The Sea Clan always have eyes atop their heads and look down greatly on our Human Race. You have lived your life inland so you perhaps don’t understand just how far apart our two races are.”

“Many thanks for your reminder, Island Master Pang,” Yang Kai responded thoughtlessly.

Pang Zhen naturally understood what Yang Kai was thinking and why he thought so.

Yang Kai had been waiting here for several days already, yet no one from Sea Temple’s headquarters had come to discuss the exchange of resources he had proposed. Anyone who was ignored like this would feel displeased. Sea Temple was the undisputed leader of the Human forces on the Limitless Ocean though, so regardless of how they acted, Yang Kai had no other option but to deal with them, but with masters from Sea God Palace suddenly appearing, Pang Zhen knew that Yang Kai was now having ideas about trying to forge a cooperative relationship with them instead.

If he could negotiate a deal with Sea God Palace, Yang Kai would need to bother with Sea Temple anymore.

Without this kind of merit to his name, Pang Zhen would likely never be promoted again and could only remain as the Island Master of Sunrise Island for the rest of his life. Although this was not an unpleasant position, it was still a fair distance from Sea Temple’s truly powerful centre.

Seeing Yang Kai not take his words to heart, Pang Zhen also became a bit angered. He was not angry with Yang Kai, of course, but rather with his own Sea Temple’s leadership.

But right now, he did not have time to deal with this matter, as the huge wave had already arrived just a few kilometres outside Sunrise Island in the short time he had been talking with Yang Kai, and it showed no signs of slowing down.

*Hong long long…*

The Island Defending Array around Sunrise Island shook as it was impacted by the wave but it remained unbroken.

It took quite some time for the massive wave to dissipate as it spread out around Sunrise Island and disappeared.

Pang Zhen looked up into the sky with an ugly expression and shouted, “Shang Ao, what is the meaning of this? Could it be that Sea God Palace wants to make war with my Sea Temple?”

“Pang Zhen, hand over my clansman you abducted. Otherwise, I will raze your Sunrise Island today and kill off every last chicken and dog on it!” Shang Ao roared, his voice booming like thunder, causing many people’s ears to ring.

Pang Zhen was stunned and immediately asked, “Hand over who?”

He did not know what Shang Ao was talking about and couldn’t help feeling a bit confused.

“Don’t play dumb with me! This General will give you a cup of tea’s time. If you can’t bring out the one this General wants to see by then, you can suffer death instead!” Although Shang Ao was strong, he was obviously bullheaded and did not even try to negotiate or explain, instead opting for directly issuing ultimatums.

He was certain that the one he was looking for was here on Sunrise Island.

Seeing Shang Ao act so arrogant and unreasonable, Pang Zhen became angered and smiled coldly, “This Island Master doesn’t know who you are talking about, but even if he did, this Island Master would not give whoever it is you want to you.”

Pang Zhen was a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master and the Island Master of Sunrise Island, so with Shang Ao coming here to cause trouble for no apparent reason, even daring to threaten him, he naturally could not show any weakness.

“Okay, since you admit your crimes, don’t blame this General for being ruthless,” Shang Ao’s face became stern and was just about to order his forces to attack when the woman next to him suddenly grabbed him and shouted. “Wait!”

Although Shang Ao looked very unhappy, he did not refuse, simply crossing his arms and standing tall while sweeping his gaze across the humans down below with clear contempt in his eyes.

He seemed to be looking down on everyone, not even putting Pang Zhen in his eyes, but when his gaze landed on Yang Kai, his eyes shrank slightly as a trace of doubt flashed across his face.

With a big smile on his face, Yang Kai looked harmless to humans and animals alike, but he still gave off an incredibly dangerous aura.

This made Shang Ao involuntarily focus on Yang Kai.
