Many well-informed people had some complaints about Yang Kai at this moment. If it was not for his sudden participation, the Dao Theory Assembly would not have had any Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in attendance. In the current situation, they no longer expected to obtain any of the top positions, they simply hoped that they would not be ranked so lowly that they besmirched the names of their Sects.

After a while, nobody else was guided to this place. It would seem that all of the participants had gathered here.

Qing Kui leaned over and muttered something in Xu Ling Gong’s ear, after which he nodded lightly and said, “Since everybody is gathered here, let us begin.”

Behind him, Su Ying Xue immediately took one step forward and raised an arm upon hearing those words. Hundreds of streams of light burst out all of a sudden and swept across the huge square.

A short while later, all the participating cultivators were surprised to find a pale gold wristband floating in front of each of them. The wristbands were made from some kind of unknown material that exuded a faint pulsing aura.

Su Ying Xue’s expression was cold and indifferent as she explained, “All participants, please wear these wristbands. These wristbands are very important. They are the key items that will determine your ranking in the Dao Theory Assembly, so do not lose them or destroy them. Do not remove them without authorisation either or you will be disqualified.”

Everybody curiously looked at the pale gold wristbands after hearing those words. Despite studying the wristbands from all angles, they could not figure out anything about them. Nevertheless, they could only obey since these arrangements were something Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had prepared for them.

It didn’t take long before everybody was wearing the wristbands. What was surprising was that the wristbands transformed into a circular brand that imprinted itself on their wrists when worn.

Yang Kai quietly scanned the wristband for a moment but did not detect anything unusual. He could not even sense the slightest hint of something wrong. As for what these wristbands were meant for, he remained clueless and turned to look at Lu Jing curiously.

Unfortunately, Lu Jing shook his head to indicate that he did not know anything either.

Yang Kai could only give up. In any case, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would eventually give an appropriate explanation for the situation.

Once everybody was wearing the wristbands, Xu Ling Gong slowly got to his feet. The majestic aura of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master unfolded and with a dignified expression, he spoke, “Yin-Yang Cave Heaven has been established in the 3,000 Worlds for countless years. Our inheritance is steeped with history. Today, I will be choosing a Husband for my youngest Disciple. It is comforting for this Monarch to see so many handsome young men standing here. I hope you will perform well and achieve satisfactory results.”

His voice was not loud, but everybody could hear him clearly with the help of his Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm aura. It sounded almost as though he was standing next to each person while speaking.

“The location of the Dao Theory Assembly this time lies within the Universe World behind you.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The expressions of many people changed to reveal knowing looks. The truth was that many of the cultivators had already made some guesses when they saw this Universe World. If that was not the location where the Dao Theory Assembly was going to be held, then why guide people to this place?

Yang Kai noticed that Lu Jing, who was standing next to him, had turned slightly pale. Lu Jing seemed apprehensive about something, almost as though this particular Universe World contained some kind of deadly threat.

“The Universe World before you is known as Prison Star. It is the place where Yin-Yang Cave Heaven exiles certain dangerous criminals. The people in that Universe World consist of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven disciples who committed grave crimes, as well as vicious and atrocious villains who were captured and brought back from the outside world. It can be said that every single existence within that place is a criminal. You can kill them at your discretion!”

“I knew it! It really is the Prison Star!” Lu Jing murmured softly.

Yang Kai turned to look at Lu Jing. [He knows something about this Prison Star. Unfortunately, it’s not convenient for me to ask him about this matter under the current circumstances. I can only figure things out once Xu Ling Gong finishes his speech.]

“This Prison Star is a training ground for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven disciples. What you need to do now is enter the Prison Star and slaughter those who can be killed. The wristband will record your achievements. In the end, the person with the highest score recorded in their wristbands will be the winner!”

As soon as those words left Xu Ling Gong’s mouth, a commotion broke out among the cultivators in the silent square and many of the cultivators couldn’t help revealing joyous looks.

That was particularly true for many Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. They originally thought that they would only be accompanying their charges on a study trip to the Dao Theory Assembly; after all, they did not have the slightest chance of winning against the ten or so Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in a straight up fight.

On the other hand, if the Dao Theory Assembly was carried out in this manner, then they could avoid fighting with the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters entirely There was even a chance of winning first place if they could obtain a good enough result on the Prison Star.

Xu Ling Gong coldly observed the commotion below only to break into a grin after a long while, “You will know how the wristband records your achievements later, but there is something else this Monarch needs to inform you about first. All the criminals on Prison Star have been notified of this event, and have been told that if they kill enough participants, they will be able to obtain their freedom. That’s why... it’s not just you hunting them, they will also spare no effort to hunt you down; after all, it has been many years since they last tasted freedom.”

The commotion throughout the square died down abruptly.

One of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters frowned at those words, “Brother Xu, why was I not informed about this?”

If that was the case, then every single person who participated in the Dao Theory Assembly would be in mortal danger. There were many Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters on Prison Star, and if anybody were to encounter those people, even a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from the Cave-Heavens and Paradises might not escape alive.

Similarly, the other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters turned to look at Xu Ling Gong in unison. It was clear that it was also the first time they had heard about this.

Xu Ling Gong slapped his head lightly, “Oh? Did I not tell you? No worries! It’s not too late for you to find out now!”

“Brother Xu, is this your own idea? Or, is this Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s idea?” A High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master questioned.

Xu Ling Gong glanced sideways at that person and simply stated, “I am in charge of the Dao Theory Assembly. Whatever I say goes. If you are worried about your Disciples, you can withdraw right now. This Xu will not stop anybody.”

[Withdraw!? We’re already here! Who would have the nerve to quit now!? If we did that, won’t other people look down on our Sects!?] They originally assumed that the Dao Theory Assembly was an explanation given by Yin-Yang Cave Heaven as a result of the joint pressure exerted by the various Cave-Heavens and Paradises for Qu Hua Shang’s actions. It would now seem though that everybody had been fooled by Xu Ling Gong.

If they had known that the Dao Theory Assembly would be so dangerous, they wouldn’t have allowed their most treasured Disciples to participate. Those whom they brought here were newly-promoted Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. How could they compare with the old ghosts on Prison Star?

“Martial Uncle Xu, how will the achievements be calculated if two people worked together to kill a criminal?” Yin Xin Zhao of Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven suddenly cupped his fist and asked.

Xu Ling Gong grinned, “Rest assured, as long as you are nearby when the criminal dies, you will share a certain amount of the achievements. You can figure out the secrets behind this mechanism yourselves.”

Yin Xin Zhao nodded lightly and asked again, “What if we were to… accidentally kill another participant?”

Xu Ling Gong said, “Of course, there will also be achievements for that. Moreover, all the results previously obtained by that person will be passed on to you.”

Yin Xin Zhao licked his lips and smiled, “I see. This Disciple understands now.”

The expressions of many participating cultivators were rather ugly. Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s Dao Theory Assembly was now a chaotic free-for-all. There was no doubt that Xu Ling Gong set this up to promote killings. It didn’t matter whether it was the criminals on Prison Star or the participating cultivators, as long as they killed another, they would receive achievements for their deeds!

Lu Jing turned deathly pale as he gulped nervously and looked at Yang Kai pitifully, “Senior Brother Yang…”

The rules of the Dao Theory Assembly had suddenly become so brutal that he was not sure if Yang Kai was still willing to fulfil their previous agreement.

Yang Kai, however, just said, “Rest assured. Just follow me later.”

Lu Jing was overjoyed, “Many thanks for your care, Brother Yang.”

He was incredibly grateful that he made such a timely move back on Intertwining Fate Peak. How else could he have had the chance to follow a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now? He was just a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. If he had entered Prison Star with his current strength alone, it would not be long before he ended up as somebody else’s meal.

“Are there any other questions?” Xu Ling Gong scanned the audience.

Nobody answered.

Thus, he nodded in satisfaction, “In that case… Let the Dao Theory Assembly begin!”

After saying that, he sat back down again.

Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue stepped forward at the same time and walked out from behind Xu Ling Gong. They each used a set of hand seals before pushing their palms out towards Prison Star. In the next moment, a wide, multi-coloured road appeared out of nowhere, connecting Prison Star and the palace square like a rainbow.

Su Ying Xue shouted, “All participants, please enter. The event will last for one year, during which Prison Star’s Grand Array will remain closed. Nobody will be allowed to enter or leave without authorization. Once the one-year period is up, we will guide you back here!”

...

Everybody glanced at the rainbow bridge for a moment and not long after that, somebody moved and landed atop it. A distorted light flashed by and that person vanished out of sight in an instant, probably transferred somewhere on Prison Star.

The rest of the cultivators quickly stepped onto the rainbow bridge, either alone or in small groups of three to five.

Yang Kai was in no hurry to move and simply stood there waiting.

“Junior Brother Yang!” A coquettish voice suddenly rang out. Yang Kai turned to look in that direction and saw a figure flying out from the depths of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. It was Qu Hua Shang.

On the stage, Xu Ling Gong was taken aback by the sight and asked Su Ying Xue, “What is that girl doing here?”

Su Ying Xue slowly shook her head.

His facial muscles twitched slightly in annoyance. Regardless of the circumstances, the purpose of the Dao Theory Assembly was to choose a Husband for Qu Hua Shang; hence, it was truly inappropriate for her to make a public appearance at a time like this. Be that as it may, she was already here so it was already too late to stop her.

The cultivators who had yet to enter Prison Star looked up upon hearing her voice and many people recognised her identity and looked enamoured at the mere sight of her.

Leaving aside the fact that she was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Qu Hua Shang’s figure and looks alone were first-class throughout the 3,000 Worlds. If they could take the winning spot in the Dao Theory Assembly, they would be able to win the hand of such a gorgeous beauty. If that had happened, then their lives would not have been in vain.

In front of everybody’s eyes though, Qu Hua Shang landed lightly in front of Yang Kai.

“Senior Sister Qu, what are you doing here?” Yang Kai asked.

...

He had not seen her since the last time the two of them had been caught in bed by Xu Ling Gong; therefore, he never expected for her to come here at this time.

“I came to see you.” She looked at him with a smile. All of a sudden, she took two steps forward and threw her soft body into his arms, “Come back soon, Junior Brother. I will be waiting for you!”

Yang Kai immediately froze in place. The two of them had been in the throes of passion and nearly sealed the deal in her bedroom last time, but that incident had simply been a trap devised by Xu Ling Gong so it could not be counted. But now, she was the one who took the initiative to hug him. Furthermore, she did it in front of so many people that he was completely caught off guard. When Yang Kai looked around, he saw that the expressions of many participating cultivators were as black as the bottom of a pot!
