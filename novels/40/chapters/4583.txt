Pei Wen Xuan replied with a smile, “It’s just a mere Void Land, why bother the Sect? Does Martial Uncle Zuo still remember Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven’s Yin Xin Zhao?”

Zuo Quan Hui pondered for a moment as a young man’s appearance flashed in his mind before he nodded and agreed, “Of course I remember.” Every youth who was able to directly advance to the Sixth-Order became famous overnight, so Zuo Quan Hui was naturally not unfamiliar with them. Moreover, Yin Xin Zhao had also been to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven last time, so he had indeed seen him.

“Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven’s Brother Yin has a close relationship with me, and has some grievances with Yang Kai. If you send a message to him, I’m sure Brother Yin will be happy to join in the fun.”

Zuo Quan Hui’s eyes lit up, “Is that true?”

Pei Wen Xuan didn’t comment on it, “I’ll have someone send a message over to try. Whether Brother Yin comes or not will be up to him.”

“Good!” Zuo Quan Hui slapped the armrest of his chair, “Then I’ll leave this matter to you, Martial Nephew Pei. If Martial Nephew Yin can really come, he will be of great help to me.”

A strange sense of bitterness rose in Zuo Quan Hui’s heart once he said this; after all, he had to place all his hopes on a newly promoted Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but now that the situation was in a deadlock, the help of any Sixth-Order Master was extremely difficult to obtain.

“Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven isn’t too far from here, just a three to six months long journey. Brother Yin will have replied by then,” Pei Wen Xuan added before getting up to send a message to Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven.

Zuo Quan Hui reprimanded the crowd a few more times before finally dispersing everyone.

In Void Territory, although there were no big battles, there was no shortage of small skirmishes. Almost every three or five days, the Heavenly Sword Palace would launch an attack and Void Land would have no choice but to respond in kind.

In the entire 3,000 Worlds, a battle of this scale was quite rare. Both sides had over a thousand Open Heaven Realm Masters involved, including twenty Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters and even a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master. This was enough to attract a lot of attention.

Time passed quickly, and soon several months had gone by…

In White Light Territory’s Universe Temple, a group of people walked out of the hall in a file, looking a bit tired and travel-worn.

The Universe Temples were jointly operated by the various Cave Heavens and Paradises. Basically, every Great Territory had one. Many cultivators used the Universe Temples as mediums to travel, saving them a lot of time.

At this moment, several people walked out from White Light Territory’s Universe Temple wearing the same blue and white robes. Their leader was a handsome young man. His aura was not obvious, but his clothes were slightly different from those of his peers, having a few conspicuous golden lines on the sleeves.

After walking out of the Universe Temple, the young man looked around before walking straight ahead as the others followed behind him.

When the surrounding crowd saw this, looks of awe and respect showed on their faces as they quickly gave way, some even started whispering amongst themselves.

“They are Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven disciples.”

“How do you know?”

“They’re wearing Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven’s robes, I’ve seen them before.”

“What are Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven’s people doing here, in this poor and backwater place?”

“The actions of the Cave Heaven’s people are not something you or I can fathom. Shh, don’t speak anymore, the one leading them is Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven’s Outer Sect Elder.”

“Outer Sect Elder!? Doesn’t that mean he’s a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?”

“Naturally, in all the Cave Heavens and Paradises only the Sixth-Order Masters are qualified to be Outer Sect Elders. If one is a Seventh-Order, then he or she would be an Inner Sect Elder. Look at the golden thread on his sleeve, that is the symbol of an Outer Sect Elder.”

“I see.”

The surrounding discussions made the young man in the lead look extremely pleased, and as he walked, his eyes became more focused. The few of them simply traversed through the Universe Temple without any intention of stopping. After walking a few streets, they headed straight for the exit.

Suddenly, the young leader’s eyes shone brightly as he turned his head towards a side of the street.

Inside a teahouse, a man and a woman were sitting facing each other. The man was small and thin, and had a cold expression on his face, making him appear taciturn. On the other hand, the woman seemed to be quite curious about everything, constantly glancing around.

When their eyes met, the woman was stunned for a moment before quickly looking away.

“Interesting!” The corner of the young man’s lips leading the group rose and withdrew his gaze before continuing forward. A moment later, he left the Universe Temple and disappeared into the void with his followers.

Half an hour later, in the teahouse, the thin man stated, “It’s time to set out.”

“En,” The woman quickly got up and followed behind the thin man.

A moment later, the two of them left the Universe Temple. The thin man took out a small boat and the two of them entered it. Next, the thin man injected his World Force as the boat transformed into a streak of light and sped off.

Inside the ship, the woman asked, “Senior, you haven’t told me how far we are from Void Land.”

The thin man indifferently replied, “There are still a few Great Territories between us. It’s about a month away.”

“Is Void Land very powerful now?” The woman asked again.

The thin man shook his head, “I don’t know either, you’ll naturally know when we get there…” Before he could finish speaking, the man’s expression suddenly changed as he formed a set of hand seals and the flying ship rapidly moved to the side.

The woman was caught off guard and almost fell to the ground, quickly prompting her to circulate her strength to stabilize herself.

“What happened?” The woman asked in surprise.

However, the man’s expression was cold as he stared at a certain spot in the sky and asked in a grim voice, “Which friend is pulling such a foul prank on me? Please show yourself!”

The woman looked in the direction he was looking, but she didn’t see anything. However, she also had a faint feeling that something wasn’t right; someone had clearly attacked their ship just now.

In the next moment, a few figures suddenly appeared in front of the flying ship, all wearing the same blue and white robes. The leader was a young man with a shadow of a smile on his face.

The man on the ship stared fixedly at their clothes, as if trying to determine something. After a long time, his face sank, “People from Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven?”

The woman beside him immediately revealed a look of shock as she covered her mouth and whispered, “Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven? One of the 36 Cave Heavens?”

Although she had just broken free of her Universe World’s shackles and entered the 3,000 Worlds, she was no stranger to the information about the Outer Universe. It was not surprising either as she had often sought out this Senior beside her to ask him about things over the years, so she had some basic knowledge.

However, she couldn’t understand why Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven, one of the 36 Cave Heavens, would attack them.

“You don’t need to say anything, I’ll handle this!” The man hurriedly sent a voice transmission, instinctively feeling that something wasn’t right. The 36 Cave Heaven were such huge forces that there was no reason for them to target them. Furthermore, from the looks of it, these people were clearly waiting here to ambush them.

The woman nodded heavily.

The man then appeared on the deck and cupped his fist, greeting, “Hei He greets Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Senior Brothers, may I ask what advice you have?”

The leading man smiled at him and asked, “You’re called Hei He!?”

Hei He responded with a nod, “Yes!”

“You’re a Void Land disciple?”

Hei He shook his head. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The man who asked and furrowed his brow, “If you’re not a Void Land disciple, why are you going to Void Land?”

Hearing this, Hei He’s heart trembled. Just as he was wondering why this man knew he was going to Void Land, he suddenly remembered a question his companion had asked him in the tea house at the Universe Temple.

[They must have overheard it at that time.]

“Senior Brother misunderstands, we are not going to Void Land,” Hei He replied calmly; after all, he had not reached the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm for nothing. His many years of experience told him that these Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven disciples in front of him probably had some kind of grudge with Void Land, otherwise they would not have acted like this.

The leading Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder slightly smiled, “You’re not going to Void Land? Do you know Yang Kai then?”

When the young man spoke this name, Hei He was able to remain calm, but the heartbeat of the woman skipped slightly. Although her reaction was very weak, how could she hide it from a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?

The Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder immediately looked towards the direction of the cabin, smiling, “It seems you know each other.”

While the young man was still speaking, Hei He quickly stamped his foot as his World Force erupted, causing the flying ship to turn into a streak of light that flew towards the Universe Temple.

His reaction couldn’t be said to be slow. He had already been vigilant to begin with, so now that he noticed something was wrong, he immediately wanted to flee back to the Universe Temple. As long as he returned to the Universe Temple, no matter what these people wanted to do, they would be safe.

Fighting was absolutely prohibited in the Universe Temple, even for the disciples of the various Cave Heavens and Paradises.

His movements were fast, but the Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder’s movements were even faster as he stretched out his hand and grabbed towards the ship. Under the World Force of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, the ship suddenly froze in place.

He then let out a cold snort and clenched his fist as the ship’s defensive Array began to glow.

“Capture them!” The Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder shouted as his subordinates immediately rushed out, each of them using their own Secret Techniques and artifacts to attack the ship.

Hei He turned pale at the sight of the might of these people’s attacks. He was just an ordinary Fifth-Order Master, but these people who had jumped out were all Fifth-Order Masters, and there was even a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master leading them, so how could he resist?

He used all his strength to activate the Spirit Arrays on his ship, but they were destroyed in less than a dozen breaths of time. The next moment, a few Divine Abilities shot towards him. Hei He struggled to resist them before flying backward, coughing up blood.

Only then did the Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven Elder stretch out his hand and grab the woman who had been hiding in the ship. The woman’s face was pale from the series of events that had transpired, but she was still someone who had weathered all kinds of great storms, so she didn’t show too much fear. She grit her teeth, staring at the young man in front of her angrily.

“You really know Yang Kai, right?” The young man asked coldly.

The woman refused to answer.

The young man scanned her from head to toe and clearly saw her cultivation. A frown appeared on his face as he muttered, “Strange, you just formed your Dao Seal, yet you have a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to escort you. It seems your identity is extraordinary. Tell me, what is your relationship with Yang Kai?”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm pressure was extremely powerful, and the woman had just formed her Dao Seal, so she was unable to resist at all. She could feel that her Dao Seal was showing signs of collapsing under this terrifying pressure. Her blood and energy kept surging but it was still impossible to suppress.

“Pui!” She spat out a mouthful of blood towards the young man.

The young man didn’t move at all, but the arrow of blood disappeared under the pressure emanating from him. He immediately slapped the woman with the back of his hand, instantly knocking her unconscious.
