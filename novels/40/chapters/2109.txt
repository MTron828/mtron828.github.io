“Shopkeeper Kang, when did I ever offend you?” Duan Yuan Shan looked in confusion at Kang Si Ran.

Honestly speaking, he wasn’t on friendly terms with Kang Si Ran, but he had known him for a long time. After all, Kang Si Ran was from the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce and had an outstanding background. He didn’t dare to belittle him despite his low power.

But, after Kang Si Ran advanced into the Dao Source Realm, he discovered that the former’s attitude toward him turned quite impertinent, and it had even turned for the worse upon learning of Yang Kai’s incident.

Duan Yuan Shan had been both confused and irritated by this, and he felt like Kang Si Ran got conceited after gaining great power.

At this moment, he got mocked in front of Yang Kai and he couldn’t stand this any longer. His anger was apparent through his words.

“City Lord Duan, you really know how to joke, how can a great City Lord offend an insignificant person like me?” Kang Si Ran said in a strange tone.

“You...” Duan Yuan Shan’s fury was apparent on his face.

After all, he was still a City Lord, and Kang Si Ran didn’t just treat me disrespectfully, he still mocked him brazenly, and anyone would be displeased by this.

“Sirs, please let me say a few words,” Yang Kai mulled this over. He was aware of why Kang Si Ran couldn’t stand Duan Yuan Shan, and he looked at him and said with a smile, “At that time, City Lord Duan wasn’t able to provide any help and didn’t have any other alternative. He could only protect himself and retreat, and he can’t be blamed for his actions.”

“Brother Yang, you’re the sensible one here,” Duan Yuan Shan snorted coldly and his expression turned for the better.

“Is that true?” Kang Si Ran furrowed his brows and cast a glance at Yang Kai, then cupped his fist at Duan Yuan Shan and apologized, “Brother Yang has already explained what happened and I have to apologize to you. I was too impulsive, and I hope that you won’t take offence.”

Duan Yuan Shan’s expression changed and he said, “Brother Kang, never mind!”

Even though he said so calmly, he was quite shocked inwardly. Kang Si Ran’s attitude had changed so drastically due to a mere word from Yang Kai, and it looked like Kang Si Ran obeyed every word of Yang Kai.

If this wasn’t the case, a Dao Source Realm Master from the Violet Source Chamber of Commerce wouldn’t have given in to him and apologized.

[These two’s relationship isn’t as simple as it looks!] Duan Yuan Shan started making guesses inwardly. He really couldn’t understand how Yang Kai could make a cultivator of the same realm obey and serve him.

“City Lord Duan, what about Zhuang Pan?” Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned gloomy and he raised a question.

Zhuang Pan might not be the main cause of all the issues, but he still played a part in making the whole situation worse. If this cowardly rat hadn’t escaped ahead of others, then the Black Tortoise Seven Sections Array wouldn’t collapse in a short while, and they would have been able to keep going for a while.

Moreover, Qin Zhao Yang wouldn’t have sustained injuries and Du Li Shen wouldn’t die on the spot... As for Yang Kai, he wasn’t really sure whether this would have been enough to save him from the Demon Sense and Demon Qi.

Yang Kai already had some issues with Zhuang Pan and he abhorred his cowardly actions.

“He has gone missing,” Duan Yuan Shan said with a composed look. “I wasn’t able to pick good people, and it’s my fault. If I had known earlier that Zhuang Pan was so cowardly, I wouldn’t have allowed him to take part in setting up the array and almost harm everyone.”

Duan Yuan Shan stopped for a moment then said, “After Zhuang Pan escaped, he didn’t go back to Maplewood City. A person with his cultivation base would likely end up corrupted by Demon Qi. However, from how things played out, I doubt he’s dead. It’s just that we don’t know where he is currently hiding.”

“Don’t let me run into him, or else I’ll make him regret being born into this world,” Kang Si Ran snorted coldly and murderously.

Duan Yuan Shan cast a glance at him then said to Yang Kai, “By the way, Brother Yang... What happened later on that day?”

Upon hearing his question, Mo Xiao Qi and Kang Si Ran also looked at Yang Kai curiously.

Yang Kai said with a bitter smile, “I’m not sure, I had been corrupted by Demon Qi and my Knowledge Sea was a mess. I could only feel that I was engulfed by darkness, and by the time I woke up, everything had already come to an end.”

He had already expected that they would inquire about this affair’s ins and outs, and he prepared an appropriate excuse ahead of time.

After he spoke, he then said in confusion, “But I detected several astonishing energy ripples and I wonder whether this really occurred.”

Duan Yuan Shan replied, “Brother Yang, your senses aren’t deceiving you, the Heavenly Martial Holy Land’s Senior Chen and two other masters of great sects arrived and it looked like they carried out a great battle against someone outside the city.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai revealed a surprised look, “Where are they now and did they tell you anything?”

An embarrassed look appeared on Duan Yuan Shan’s face and he said, “They didn’t drop by Maplewood City and I don’t know where they went after the battle.”

He was Maplewood City’s Lord and it was quite embarrassing for him to admit this. After all, those people dropped into his territory, yet they didn’t bother to greet him, and they didn’t even notify him. They obviously didn’t take him seriously!

He was only a Second-Order Dao Source Realm Cultivator and he didn’t dare to denounce those Emperor Realm Masters.

“Then, does this mean it’s those seniors that have extinguished the Demon Qi?” Yang Kai said solemnly, “As expected. Those seniors’ means are impressive and their power is astounding. They made a great contribution then retreated and left right away. Admirable!”

Duan Yuan Shan’s expression turned stern and he said, “Our Maplewood City’s crisis has already come to an end and we must express our thanks to those seniors.”

Even Kang Si Ran and Mo Xiao Qi approved of his opinion and they obviously assumed that the Demon Qi disappeared suddenly thanks to the Emperor Realm Masters.

Yang Kai was glad to see this and he wouldn’t need to divulge the truth.

“Huh, Brother Yang, I have come here to visit you and... Ask something of you: Are you willing to reside in Maplewood City?”

“Long-term residence?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“That’s right.” Duan Yuan Shan nodded. “According to the intel in our hands, you aren’t from any sect and faction and you also don’t belong to any family. If you stay in Maplewood City, then I’m willing to give you the Vice City Lord’s position. You also know that Zhuang Pan was the Vice City Lord, but he has already escaped and his position is vacant, while you are also endowed with enough power to take over this position.”

After he spoke, he looked expectantly at Yang Kai, as if he really wished for him to agree.

“Well...”An embarrassed look appeared on Yang Kai’s face. When they had been defending Maplewood City together, he had already heard similar news from Qin Zhao Yang and knew that Duan Yuan Shan wanted him to take over Maplewood City’s third Vice City Lord’s position.

At that time, Yang Kai’s reply had been vague and ambiguous, and he didn’t expect that Duan Yuan Shan would drop in personally to question him.

“Brother Yang is a man with outstanding talent and will sooner or later soar into the sky. How can the little Maplewood City keep him?” Kang Si Ran next to them spoke.

Duan Yuan Shan cast a glance at him then looked at Yang Kai. He said, “I understand!”

Yang Kai said with a bitter smile, “City Lord Duan, I’m really sorry, but I’m used to travelling alone and I don’t stay in the same place for long, but I still appreciate your kindness.”

“It’s no bother, you have already given me an answer and that’s enough for me.”

Mo Xiao Qi next to them giggled and said, “Brother Yang, whenever you are about to leave Maplewood City, don’t forget to notify me. I want to accompany you and travel the world with you.”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her and teased her, “I won’t refuse a beauty’s company.”

“Pah!” Mo Xiao Qi’s face got flushed and she said coyly, “Brother Yang, you’re so wicked!”

Duan Yuan Shan and Kang Si Ran burst into laughter, but when they sighted upon the large birthmark on Mo Xiao Qi’s face, they couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. If she didn’t have this birthmark, she would have been a great beauty, even though this birthmark still couldn’t cover up her beauty, it had already ruined her overall look.

Soon after, the three people chatted for a while before Duan Yuan Shan and his companions stood up and bid farewell to Yang Kai.

“By the way, Brother Yang,” When he was about to leave, Duan Yuan Shan suddenly turned around and said. “I have something to tell you.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked in confusion at him.

“It’s about the guy which you asked our men to imprison, I don’t know what means he used, but he has already disappeared from the city jail.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and said, “Do you mean the old swindler?”

“That’s right!” Duan Yuan Shan revealed a strange look. “At that time, all of the city’s cultivators had been defending the city and none looked after him, but his power had already been restricted by your seal and someone with his cultivation base shouldn’t have been able to escape, yet, the jailer came to report that he had disappeared and didn’t leave any trails behind him. It’s just too strange!”

“Hehe...” Yang Kai let out a laugh and said, “I know.”

Duan Yuan Shan was taken aback and he said in surprise, “You have already expected this outcome?”

Yang Kai didn’t seem surprised at all, and Duan Yuan Shan could easily discern the reason behind this.

“It was merely a guess, but it looks like that old man is anything but simple,” The corners of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

The old swindler travelled alone from the Forest City to ask for reinforcement from Maplewood City and he depended upon his Third-Order Origin King’s power to venture among the Demon Qi without suffering any harm. He had obviously resorted to some unknown means to achieve this feat!

Later on, Yang Kai put a seal on him, yet, he suddenly disappeared from the jail cell.

Ordinary Origin Kings couldn’t achieve those feats, and it was a wonder what secrets he harboured and how came to possess such mysterious skills.

“Should we hunt him down?” Duan Yuan Shan asked. “If you want, I don’t mind providing help.”

“No need!” Yang Kai shook his head. “I imprisoned him only out of curiosity to see whether I could get my hands on the secret skill that helped him venture into areas with Demon Qi freely and see whether our city’s cultivators could make use of it. But, the crisis has already come to an end and we don’t need to carry out this plan any longer. It isn’t like he has done anything outrageous, he’s only fond of swindling people off their wealth.”

“Since you have given a word, then I’ll let him off the hook,” Duan Yuan Shan laughed and cupped his fists at him. He said, “Brother Yang, you should rest and recuperate in the next few days, we’ll now take our leave.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai nodded and saw them off with his gaze then went back to a side room and sat down.

After an hour, his eyes snapped open and he said calmly, “Since you have already arrived, then come in, what are you doing so stealthily outside?”
