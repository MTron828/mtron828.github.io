By the time Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord reached this place, the Sealed World’s portal was slowly opening.

The two figures on the deck noticed them and turned their heads.

One of them was a Territory Lord while the other was the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master that Yang Kai had detected. Upon closer look, he realised that the Eighth-Order Master had a bloated figure, which made him look like a ball. His head was right above his figure, as though his neck didn’t exist.

Sarcomas could be seen all over his skin, looking like horrible abscesses.

Just by standing there, this bloated person exuded a violent and dangerous aura. Even the Territory Lord beside him wasn’t willing to stand close to him.

The moment Yang Kai saw this person’s appearance, he realised his identity.

This person was none other than the Nie An that Wu Xing He had mentioned.

Although Yang Kai had never seen him before, this person’s appearance suggested that he had broken through his limit with the help of Black Ink Strength and achieved something that couldn’t be achieved through ordinary means; however, his life was also at risk now due to the hidden dangers in his Small Universe.

Nie An only made it to the Fourth Order when he ascended to the Open Heaven Realm, so the Sixth Order was his natural limit. He was already lucky enough to have ascended to the Seventh Order with the help of the Black Ink Strength. Now, he even managed to make it to the Eighth Order, which was simply inconceivable. The Royal Lord must have taken action personally; otherwise, Nie An couldn’t have achieved this.

It could be said that Nie An was in a perilous situation, for he gave off a feeling that he might explode at any moment. However, he was still safe and sound. Perhaps Mu Guang had used an incredible technique to ensure his safety when he ascended to the Eighth Order.

In that case, he would most likely become a Great Grandmaster.

A Great Grandmaster would definitely be able to refine a Warship. Perhaps the Black Ink Clan would have their own Warships in no time and sail them across the battlefield. It wouldn’t be like in the past when their Warships were practically useless.

At that instant, Yang Kai felt a sense of urgency.

Back then, when he heard about the existence of Nie An from Wu Xing He, he had no choice but to change his plans; still, it never crossed his mind that Nie An could break through his limit and ascend to the Eighth Order so soon.

Fortunately, he was certain that Nie An was alive at the very least, and he could act accordingly.

While Yang Kai was in his thoughts, Nie An suddenly asked, “Are you a newcomer?”

Yang Kai promptly cupped his fist, “Greetings, Sir. I’ve been here for three years.”

Upon hearing that, Nie An asked, “Are you the one who was sent here by Hei Yuan?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai had no idea how the other man found out he was Hei Yuan’s Black Ink Disciple. Nevertheless, it went to show that Nie An was able to get his hands on the sensitive information that only the most important Black Ink Clansmen knew. In other words, the Royal Lord truly treasured him.

“Where were you?” Nie An asked.

Yang Kai honestly reported to him. Fortunately, the materials that Wu Xing He asked him to buy were indeed precious. Qing Lei could be easily fooled because he knew nothing about Artifact Refining, but the same trick couldn’t be used on Nie An.

Luckily, Nie An didn’t intend to probe him further and just nodded gently before he stopped talking.

As the portal was opened, the Territory Lord and Nie An dashed inside while the ship remained anchored outside. After they entered, Yang Kai and the Feudal Lord also flew into the Sealed World.

Presently, Mei Qiong was busy handling the Territory Lord and Nie An, so he couldn’t pay a lot of attention to Yang Kai. After asking some questions, he simply let Yang Kai pass.

After leading Yang Kai to the mountain valley, the Feudal Lord left, for he had to report to Qing Lei on the completion of this mission.

Yang Kai sauntered towards Wu Xing He’s residence and gently triggered the restriction. A moment later, a gap appeared in the middle of the restriction, then Yang Kai walked inside.

On the second floor, Wu Xing He was seated with his legs crossed. There was some faint Black Ink Strength lingering around his figure. Presently, he was continuously circulating the power of his Small Universe to resist the Black Ink Strength.

Yang Kai wasn’t surprised at the sight. He walked up to Wu Xing He and clapped his hands. The next instant, a pure and dazzling light engulfed Wu Xing He.

A sizzling noise was heard as the Black Ink Strength inside Wu Xing He’s body soon disintegrated.

Wu Xing He’s clothes were already soaked in sweat as he let out a breath, “You came back pretty quick, Junior Brother.”

Yang Kai replied, “I wouldn’t let you be at risk.”

Before he left the place some time ago, he already realised that Wu Xing He had been invaded by Black Ink Strength. That was the reason he had to come back in a hurry. If he returned any later, Wu Xing He would have been corrupted and become a Black Ink Disciple. When that happened, Yang Kai’s identity would have been exposed.

Of course, Yang Kai reckoned that Wu Xing He would kill himself at the most critical moment to ensure that the secret remained safe.

On the Black Ink Battlefield, Human soldiers had always been willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of the greater good.

Wu Xing He was corrupted by Black Ink Strength when he came into contact with Qing Lei. This Sealed World was not filled with Black Ink Strength, so he didn’t have to worry about anything as long as he was cautious enough; however, Wu Xing He was standing too close to Qing Lei at that time. As a Territory Lord, Qing Lei naturally released Black Ink Strength around him. On the other hand, Wu Xing He wouldn’t dare to resist lest his secret was exposed. That was how he was corrupted.

Fortunately, he was only stained with a small amount of Black Ink Strength; otherwise, he would’ve become a Black Ink Disciple again before Yang Kai returned.

“Is everything prepared?” Wu Xing He asked with concern.

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes.”

Wu Xing He had no idea what move Yang Kai had used to fool the Feudal Lord that had tagged along with him; however, since he had said as much, it meant that the matter was indeed settled.

“Nie An has returned, Senior Brother Wu,” Yang Kai said.

“He’s back?” Wu Xing He was startled.

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai nodded, “I came across him on my way back. He’s now an Eighth-Order Master!”

Upon hearing that, Wu Xing He sported an anxious expression, “That’s terrible news for us.”

What he and Yang Kai hoped was for Nie An to explode and pass away when trying to achieve an ascension so that no one would be able to help the Black Ink Clan finish their Warship. Now that Nie An had returned safely though, it was bad news for them.

After giving it a thought, Wu Xing He asked, “Can Nie An be saved?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “No. His limit is the Sixth-Order, so his Small Universe can only bear the power of the Sixth-Order. The reason he’s alive right now is because of the Black Ink Strength. The moment I dispel the Black Ink Strength in his body, his Small Universe will explode.”

The light in Wu Xing He’s eyes went out, “What a shame.”

If Nie An could be saved, it would be good news for the Humans. After all, Artifact Refining Great Grandmasters were rare. However, Yang Kai made it clear that Nie An could not be saved, which was why Wu Xing He found it to be a shame.

“Yes, it is indeed a shame, but Nie An has to die!” Yang Kai said grimly.

As long as Nie An was killed, the Black Ink Clan’s plan to build a Warship would come to a halt.

Perhaps they would still be able to nurture some Artifact Refiners in the distant future, but those Black Ink Disciples would never grow to be Great Grandmasters.

Now, Humans from different Great Passes had Purifying Light, and Purifying Black Ink Pills had been successfully developed. In other words, no Human soldiers would be corrupted by Black Ink Strength again. How was the Black Ink Clan supposed to nurture Artifact Refiners without any new Black Ink Disciples?

The moment they broke through their limits with Black Ink Strength, people like Nie An and Liu Zi An lost all hope to be saved.

“It’s not easy to kill an Eighth-Order Master. Moreover, there are two Territory Lords in this Sealed World. What’s your plan?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’m certainly no match for a normal Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; however, Nie An is different. He won’t be able to fully utilise his Eighth-Order might. Furthermore, I don’t have to fight with him directly. I just have to get a chance to dispel the Black Ink Strength in his body. By then, his Small Universe will come apart, and he’ll detonate. As for the two Territory Lords… Mei Qiong has never left the portal over the years, so I don’t have a good solution for him. Nevertheless, Qing Lei will leave this Sealed World every six months. We can make use of that.”

Upon hearing that, Wu Xing He nodded, “Qing Lei only left this Sealed World some time ago, so it will be another six months before he leaves again.”

“We’ll make a move in six months, then.” Yang Kai was determined, “I hope that everything will go well by then; however, before that, I will need you to deal with Senior Brother Wang and Senior Brother Guan.”

Wu Xing He nodded, “I’ll inform you at an opportune time.”

As they spoke, the restriction around the building was triggered. A thought flashed through Wu Xing He’s mind as the restriction was deactivated. A moment later, a Black Ink Disciple walked up the stairs and cupped his fist at them, “Senior Brother Nie wants to see you, Senior Brothers.”

A puzzled Wu Xing He asked, “What happened?”

The Black Ink Disciple shook his head, “I have no idea, but Senior Brother Nie wants everybody to gather together.”

Upon finishing his words, he turned around and left.

After exchanging glances, Yang Kai and Wu Xing He frowned. They had no idea why Nie An wanted them to come together not long after he returned.

“Let’s see what he’s up to,” Wu Xing He said, then left the place with the other man.

A moment later, several hundred Artifact Refiners gathered together in front of the Warship in the mountain valley. Standing in front of them was the bloated Nie An.

Many people were whispering among themselves as they had no idea why Nie An gathered everyone.

When all of the Artifact Refiners were present, Nie An gazed at the huge Warship with narrowed eyes and waved his hand, “Dismantle it.”

Upon hearing that, all of them were astounded.

Guan Ning, who was at the front, stepped forward and said, “Senior Brother Nie, this Warship is about to be completed. Why do you want to dismantle it?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Nie An replied dispassionately, “What’s the point of keeping this rubbish? Dismantle it.”

“But…”

Just when Guan Ning wanted to continue speaking, Nie An suddenly turned his head and glared at him, “What else do you want to say?”

As he spoke, his Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm pressure swept across the place.

Guan Ning gulped and spoke no further.

Wu Xing He, who was standing beside Yang Kai, frowned. Although Nie An was haughty back then, he had never been so overbearing. It seemed that his temperament had changed after he forcefully ascended to the Eighth Order.
