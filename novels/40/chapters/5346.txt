After entering the Black Ink Nest Space, Yang Kai didn’t immediately take any action. He just quietly waited in a corner, observing the situation

As if everyone sensed that someone new had appeared, the surrounding Divine Senses swept over, but they soon ignored him.

Although most of the Soul Avatars entering this space were acquainted with each other, some unfamiliar faces would come in from time to time, so there was nothing strange about this.

Yang Kai secretly let out a sigh of relief. By the looks of it, he had successfully snuck in.

Inside the Black Ink Nest Space, Divine Senses kept surging again and again as naturally, the various Soul Avatars were communicating with each other. Some Soul Avatars did not conceal their thoughts from outsiders, allowing anyone to read their transmissions, but there were also a few who were secretly sending messages between acquaintances. As for what they were discussing, only they knew.

There were also many people like Yang Kai who just idled by the side, not participating in any chat. As such, Yang Kai did not particularly stand out.

After waiting for a while longer, Yang Kai finally began to wander around, reading the messages in the surroundings.

He did not manage to obtain any useful information after wandering about for half a day. The conversation between these Black Ink Clansmen was quite a mix. Some of them were thinking about how they would invade the 3,000 Worlds of the Human Race in the future and gather a large number of Black Ink Disciples to lord over, while others were worried about the situation of the Royal City; after all, the Royal Lord was seriously injured and the Black Ink Clan in Great Evolution Theatre was trapped. So, the Black Ink Clan’s situation was quite a mess.

There were also a few Black Ink Clansmen who seemed to be diligently cultivating.

After another half a day, Yang Kai had successfully infiltrated a few Black Ink Clan groups and chatted with them.

At the end of the day, Yang Kai had lived in the Black Ink Clan for many years, so he was quite familiar with their habits and lifestyle. As such, he did not reveal any flaws.

Had it been anyone else, they definitely wouldn’t have been able to participate in these conversations, thereby failing to obtain any information on the Black Ink Clan once they exposed flaws.

The conversation between the several Black Ink Clansmen shifted again and Yang Kai was finally able to lead them to a comparison of strength.

Yang Kai added, “The Seventh-Order Humans are equivalent to the Feudal Lords on our side, while the Eighth-Order Humans are on par with the Territory Lords, but if we really fought against a Human of equivalent realm, we rarely win.”

Sighing deeply, he wore a look of worry for the future of the Black Ink Clan.

One of the Feudal Lords disagreed, “There’s nothing we can do about that. Human cultivation mainly depends on a lot of accumulation over time, so their foundation is firmer. We, on the other hand, can use the Black Ink Nests to quickly increase our strength, so we’re naturally lacking a bit in comparison. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have any advantages. Human growth is slow, and it’s not easy for Masters to appear. Although it’s not easy for us either, we’re much better than Humans in this regard.”

Another Feudal Lord agreed, “That’s right, our Feudal Lords might not be the match of their Seventh-Order Masters in a one-on-one fight, and even our Territory Lord might not be their Eighth-Order Masters opponent, but we still have the advantage in numbers.”

Yang Kai poured a bucket of cold water on them, “It is said that many Territory Lords at Great Evolution Pass died in battle, and the Royal City similarly suffered massive casualties. Although many Eighth-Order Masters from the Human Race have also died, generally speaking, it is still the Territory Lords who suffered more casualties. Many familiar faces have long since disappeared, and even the Territory Lords have fallen, let alone the Feudal Lords.”

Yang Kai thought that the mental fortitude of these people was too poor, how could they just give up after a few words? Seeing this, he decisively continued to rub salt into their wounds, “Sir Royal Lord also… in this situation, what should we do in the future?”

A Feudal Lord who had been silent all this while coldly snorted, “So what if the Humans are strong now? Sooner or later, they will be our slaves.”

Yang Kai shook his head, refuting, “We can’t be so blind and arrogant. Before the Human Race Army attacked us, we all used to think that the Humans were nothing, but now we’re trapped in the Royal City, and we are doing everything to form a defence line to prevent the Humans from attacking.”

The nearby Feudal Lords all nodded.

Before the arrival of the Great Evolution Army, the Black Ink Clan of Great Evolution Theatre were extremely proud of themselves, because they were the only Theatre that had managed to capture a Human Great Pass. In the entire history of Humans and Black Ink Clan, the Humans had only lost Great Evolution Pass. The Black Ink Clan had never managed to repeat this feat in any other Theatre.

But the Black Ink Clan here was completely routed when the Great Evolution Army arrived. In the end, the Black Ink Clan was forced to leave behind a Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest and all their Seventh-Order Black Ink Disciples in order to escape from Great Evolution Pass. In addition, the Royal City suffered massive damage and casualties.

If they could turn back time, they would never underestimate the Humans again.

The Feudal Lord who was opposing Yang Kai let out a cold snort before rebuking, “The defence line is necessary. It’s fine if the Humans don’t attack, but if they dare do, they’ll definitely suffer.”

Yang Kai curiously asked, “Why is this Sir so confident? Have the higher-ups made some special arrangements that we don’t know of?”

Yang Kai assumed a humble look on his face as he asked while the others in the conversation also became curious.

The Feudal Lord hesitated for a moment, but ultimately, he answered in a low voice, “I don’t know whether higher-ups have made any arrangements or not, but the Royal Lord… seems to have recovered.”

Yang Kai’s heart clenched tight, [The Royal Lord has recovered?]

[How did he recover?]

[That’s impossible! The Royal Lord hadn’t been able to enter his Black Ink Nest to heal all these years as Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao hadn’t given him the opportunity to do so. It’s impossible for the Royal Lord to recover without entering his Black Ink Nest.]

Not only did Yang Kai think so, but the other Feudal Lords also thought the same. One of them quickly asked, “Has the Royal Lord really recovered? Is this news accurate? Where did you learn about this?”

The Feudal Lord stuttered, unable to explain.

Yang Kai’s voice turned heavy as he stated, “Sir, this concerns the Royal Lord, you can’t speak irresponsibly. It’s fine as it was just in between us, but if word of this got out, I’m afraid the Territory Lords will condemn you for speaking nonsense!”

Yang Kai didn’t know if the Territory Lords would really do such a thing, but in any case, making a big deal of things was currently to his advantage.

The Feudal Lord hurriedly defended himself, “I’m not speaking nonsense, it’s just…”

“What?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s just that… a few days ago, we faintly felt the aura of the Royal Lord’s attack. Although it was only for a fraction of a breath, it was definitely the Royal Lord’s attack.”

When the Feudal Lords heard this, all of them became extremely excited and quickly asked whether it was true or not. The Feudal Lord naturally insisted that he was not the only one who had sensed it as the other Feudal Lord in his Black Ink Nest had also sensed it.

Yang Kai’s heart sank as he asked, “How many days ago?”

[Three days ago…]

[It was right when Yao Kang Chen sent me that message.]

[Did Yao Kang Cheng really encounter the Royal Lord?]

The Feudal Lords all became excited while Yang Kai too pretended to be overjoyed, but he was in no mood to ask any more questions.

The Snow Wolves Squad had encountered the Royal Lord. By the looks of it, their fate had been sealed; after all, they were only a Special Operations Squad; they might have a chance to escape if they encountered a Territory Lord, but if they encountered the Royal Lord… death was the only possible outcome.

[Yao Kang Cheng must have sent me a message at the last moment to inform me of this, but unfortunately, he simply had no time; so, the jade slip only contained the words ‘Royal Lord’!]

[The Snow Wolves Squad… perished!]

[Most likely, they all died together.]

Yang Kai’s heart ached even more.

The reason for this conjecture was that the remaining three Squads had yet not been found out. If the Snow Wolves Squad still had survivors, they would definitely be turned into Black Ink Disciples. Once they became Black Ink Disciples, not only would Dawn and the others be unable to hide themselves, even Great Evolution Pass’ surprise attack would be exposed.

If they weren’t all instantly killed, suicide was the only option to prevent themselves from being turned into Black Ink Disciples!

Since Dawn and the others were still safe and sound, and there were no unusual movements in the Black Ink Clan’s defence line, it meant that no one from the Snow Wolves Squad had fallen into the hands of the Black Ink Clan.

Murderous intent surged in Yang Kai’s heart as he couldn’t wait to exterminate all the Black Ink Clan Soul Avatars in this Black Ink Nest Space.

Nevertheless, he also knew that if he followed this impulse, the losses would far outweigh the gains.

The reason why the Feudal Lord had only suspected that the Royal Lord had recovered was mainly because of the distance.

All the Low-Rank Black Ink Nests were about a month’s journey from the Royal City. If the Royal Lord was at the Royal City, then even if he attacked, they would not have been able to sense it unless he really went all out.

But why would the Royal Lord go all out against the Snow Wolves Squad?

The Royal Lord would have to be much closer to their Black Ink Nest for them to be able to sense his casual attack. At most, the conflict would be a 10-day journey away from their position.

The Royal Lord would not have left the Royal City if he had not recovered; after all, he would be too afraid of running into the Old Ancestor otherwise.

After staying in the Black Ink Nest Space for another hour, Yang Kai finally found an opportunity to leave.

The moment his Soul returned to his body, he made a quick scan with his Divine Sense and noticed that Ren Bing Bai was the one overseeing the Black Ink Nest currently. Shen Ao should not have been able to hold on and left, asking Ren Bing Bai to take over.

Yang Kai walked to the centre and chatted with Ren Bing Bai a little before asking him to return to Dawning Light.

Ren Bing Bai noticed that something was not right and asked, “Squad Leader, is something wrong?”

Yang Kai nodded, “The Snow Wolves Squad… might be no more.”

Ren Bing Bai was beside himself in shock, “What happened?”

Yang Kai replied, “They might have run into the Royal Lord!”

“The Royal Lord!” Ren Bing Bai involuntarily exclaimed in shock, “They went to the Royal City?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Yao Kang Cheng would not have taken such a risk. He must have run into the Royal Lord outside. When you return, tell everyone to be extra careful.”

“Understood,” Ren Bing Bai solemnly agreed.

After he left, Yang Kai thought about it for a moment before messaging Chai Fang and Ma Gao about the Snow Wolves Squad, telling them to raise their guard to the highest limit.

Nonetheless, if they did encounter the Royal Lord, they would simply be unable to do anything no matter how careful they were. The gap in their strength was too wide. Right now, all Yang Kai could do was pray that they could hold on a few more days until Great Evolution Pass arrived.

Immediately after, Yang Kai also sent a message to Great Evolution Pass to inform them about the Royal Lord’s suspected recovery.

Yang Kai received a reply from Great Evolution Pass soon after.

The Old Ancestor had personally sent him a reply which read, “I’ve got a pretty good idea of the Royal Lord’s injuries. It’s impossible for him to recover in such a short time. Is there a mistake in the information?”

Yang Kai quickly messaged back, informing her of everything he had learned in the Black Ink Nest Space.

This time, it was not the Old Ancestor who messaged but Xiang Shan instead. He asked him to be careful and immediately flee if it came to that, meaning he should escape all alone.

Yang Kai’s Small Universe had a World Tree clone; so, he didn’t need to worry about being turned into a Black Ink Disciple. He was also proficient in the Dao of Space. As such, his chances of escaping with his life were still decent.

But if he tried to escape with the others, that would be really unrealistic and everyone would definitely be wiped out.
