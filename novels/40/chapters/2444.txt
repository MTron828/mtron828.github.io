[With such strength, even Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian aren’t worthy to carry his shoes!]

[Can a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator really be this strong!?] Before the man pretending to be Feng De, Yu Ying was hit with a sense of panic and powerlessness, as if she was in front of an Emperor Realm Master. She couldn’t even lift a finger, much less summon the courage to escape. She just stupidly stood on the spot, her tender body shivering like a sparrow in the winter without a nest.

After killing Zhong Zhen Yong, Yang Kai reached out and took his Space Ring and the Netherworld Purgatory Banner. At the same time, a beam of starlight shot straight into the sky from the back of Zhong Zhen Yong’s hand before flying towards Yang Kai, straight into the seal on the back of his hand.

Yang Kai had already noticed that Zhong Zhen Yong’s Star Seal was the same as his, six-pointed. After the two merged, it would surely provide a lot of nourishment to his Star Seal, helping it go a step further.

Finally, he focused his gaze on Yu Ying, coldly staring at her.

“Senior… Senior Brother Feng, I…I…” Yu Ying, meeting his gaze, turned pale all of a sudden, stammering incoherently as she was unable to even finish a complete sentence.

“Along the way here, I have troubled you,” Yang Kai indifferently said.

Yu Ying forced a smile as she tremblingly stated, “It is this Little Sister’s honour to be of service to Senior Brother Feng.”

“En!” Yang Kai gently nodded before suddenly waving his hand, and along with fluctuations of Space Principles, a pitch-black Moon Blade flew out.

“Nooooooo!” Seeing this, Yu Ying turned pale as she screamed loudly.

Although she had no idea what this Secret Technique was, she had seen Zhong Zhen Yong die under the exact same attack. Now, Yang Kai was using the same move to deal with her… Obviously, he wasn’t planning to let her leave with her life.

As she screamed, she hurriedly summoned her defensive artifact and pushed all her Source Qi to defend herself, hoping to avoid this catastrophe, but what horrified her was that this pitch-black blade was far more horrifying than she had imagined. It cut through all her defences like crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, rending her figure in two. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yu Ying only felt a slight pain before her consciousness faded away.

Yang Kai reached out and took away her Space Ring. After waiting for a while, Yu Ying’s Star Seal flew out and was received by him.

He raised his hand again, firing a few bursts of energy that crushed Zhong Zhen Yong’s and Yu Ying’s corpses into dust.

He didn’t hesitate to kill Yu Ying. Regardless of whether he was Feng De or not, it was still a fact that he had saved her, but instead of doing her best to repay that life-saving grace, she had instantly turned hostile after coming to know of his origins. The death of such a person wasn’t worth pitying.

Not to mention, Yang Kai didn’t have a good impression of her.

After finishing all this, Yang Kai suddenly frowned as he glanced behind him.

He noticed that the Brahma Holy Land disciples from before had re-appeared. It was unknown whether they were here because they received word of this Fire Attribute Star Source, or because they were pursuing him.

However, Yang Kai had no intention of meeting the Brahma Holy Land disciples. These people’s grudge was with Yu Ying, and now that she was dead, Yang Kai didn’t want to unnecessarily become entangled with Zhang Hao and Zhang Xian.

His figure flickered as he shot toward the dark red star at an astonishing speed.

The closer he got, the more Yang Kai could feel the terrifying heat radiating from the Star. The Fire Attribute Star Source there seemed even more incredible than he imagined, exciting him greatly.

Half an hour later, he landed somewhere on the Star. Everywhere in sight was nothing but a desolate piece of land. Apparently, everything had been burned to the ground by intense flames, leaving not a single blade of grass behind.

Who knows how this Star remained intact in the battlefield where numerous Great Emperors fought to the death.

“Oh? A Flaming Cloud Mushroom!” Yang Kai’s gaze was suddenly attracted by something like a cloud of fire. With his knowledge, he could naturally recognize that it was an Emperor Grade spirit medicine, Flaming Cloud Mushroom. What took him aback was the fact that it could still grow in a place like this and even reach the Emperor Grade.

However, after giving it a second, it wasn’t that surprising to find Fire Attribute spirit medicines growing here. The Fire Attribute energy here was extremely rich. Not to mention, there was a Fire Attribute Star Source here as well.

In that momentary hesitation though, Yang Kai caught sight of a figure rushing toward the Flaming Cloud Mushroom. Apparently, the oncoming figure had also discovered the spirit medicine and wanted to pick it.

The Flaming Cloud Mushroom was an Emperor Grade spirit medicine, which was extremely valuable in itself. The conditions it required to grow were also extremely harsh, so it was much more expensive than an ordinary Emperor Grade herb.

As an Emperor Grade Alchemist, how could Yang Kai let someone else snatch such a rare spirit medicine from right under his nose?

As such, his figure flickered as he arrived before the Flaming Cloud Mushroom in one step.

He reached out and dug out a large part of the area where the Flaming Cloud Mushroom grew then threw it into his Sealed World Bead.

When Yang Kai was finished with everything, that figure came leaping toward the area before him.

But obviously, this person was a step late. So, the figure immediately stood ten metres away from Yang Kai, glaring at him with an unhappy look on its face.

Yang Kai indifferently looked back at the figure, but upon seeing this person’s appearance, he couldn’t help but frown.

Because just judging by appearance, Yang Kai couldn’t tell whether the opposite party was male or female.

If this person was a man, he was a bit too handsome. His skin was white as snow and looked soft and delicate, but if she was a woman, Yang Kai couldn’t find any characteristic features an ordinary woman should have. Her chest was completely flat, and her bottom wasn’t the slightest bit shapely. Even though her figure was slender, she was lacking all the curves a girl should have.

Even the clothing this person wore was gender-neutral.

[Is this guy a man or woman?] A confused look immediately appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

While Yang Kai was carefully sizing up the opposite party, the opposite party suddenly rebuked, “Friend, isn’t what you did a bit unbecoming? I spotted that spirit medicine first.”

As soon as he heard the opposite party’s voice, Yang Kai was gobsmacked.

At first, he believed that even if he couldn’t tell the other person’s gender by their appearance or figure, he could at least infer something from their voice, but after hearing them speak, Yang Kai realized that he had been too naive.

The opposite party’s voice was a little magnetic, and very pleasant to the ears, but also unspecific and mild-pitched, making it hard to tell whether it belonged to a man or woman. The other party was also in the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, just like Yang Kai, but the Star Seal on the back of their hand was only five-pointed.

Yang Kai didn’t bother about the other party’s gender anymore and simply replied with a smile, “Fellow Brother, you can eat whatever you like but you can’t just say anything you want. This herb was without an owner, so it belongs to whoever picks it first.”

Just as Yang Kai said this, the opposite party’s face contorted into an angry scowl before cursing angrily, “You are a Brother! Your entire family are Brothers! Can’t you see that I’m a woman!?”

Yang Kai was flabbergasted and seriously sized up this person who claimed himself to be a woman. But even after a good long while, Yang Kai just earnestly shook his head and stated, “I can’t tell!”

The woman immediately grew furious, her face filling with rage as she lifted her head and pointed to her neck and stated, “Are you blind!? Can’t you see that I don’t have an Adam’s apple?”

Black lines immediately appeared on Yang Kai’s face as he stated, “I can see that… but I don’t see… many other things…”

While speaking, Yang Kai gazed at her chest.

The woman’s face now turned extremely gloomy and she couldn’t help but puff up her chest, finally causing some slight bulge to appear.

Yang Kai clapped his hands and stated, “Now, I see some clues.”

“You are really as blind as a dog!” The woman seemed to have a bad temper and ground her teeth as she cursed.

Yang Kai wiped the sweat off his forehead and said, “Little… Sister, how old are you this year? Children should speak in a civilized manner. You shouldn’t swear.”

“You’re the child! You’ll be a child your whole life!” The young woman was so incensed that she directly palmed towards Yang Kai.

This move of hers wasn’t powerful and carried no murderous intention. Obviously, she was just angry and lashing out because of Yang Kai’s teasing.

After she finished, she turned around left without even looking back or checking Yang Kai’s response.

Yang Kai happily raised his arm and dispersed her attack. He then looked up and saw that she was already thousands of metres away from him. Finally, she looked back and angrily glared at him before she disappeared.

“Sister, don’t go, I still didn’t get your name!” Yang Kai shouted with a grin.

But he didn’t get any response. He had no idea where she had gone. Perhaps she was so angry at Yang Kai that she didn’t even bother to respond to him, and didn’t bother to pester Yang Kai to return the Flaming Cloud Mushroom.

After having been prodded by that so-called girl, Yang Kai’s mood was suddenly lifted.

He spread his Divine Sense and scanned the surroundings to make sure that there weren’t any other spirit medicines around. After he was done, he finally summoned his ship and flew toward the direction where the Fire Attribute Source Strength was the richest.

What he could say for sure was that Yin Le Sheng was on this Star. Only, he couldn’t discern his exact location.

However, it was absolutely the right choice to move closer to where the Source Strength was rich, because Yin Le Sheng would definitely go there, and as long as he could find Yin Le Shen, Yang Kai could inquire about Xiao Xiao’s whereabouts.

Yang Kai had been separated from Xiao Xiao ever since he entered the Star Boundary and had never stopped worrying about him. Xiao Xiao’s specialty and naivety would make him an easy target for any powerful Master.

This Star was very peculiar, however. Yang Kai had been in the Shattered Star Sea for so long but he had never encountered a star with spirit medicines. However, there were many of them here.

All the spirit medicines here were, of course, Fire Attribute. They should have been born because of the Fire Attribute Source Strength. Every spirit medicine’s medicinal age was also quite good, making them all very valuable. However, Yang Kai didn’t pick every spirit medicine along the way; he didn’t waste his time picking useless things.

Apparently, quite a few cultivators had come to this Cultivation Star as Yang Kai occasionally met some. These people rarely acted alone like him, basically moving in pairs, or groups of three to five. Obviously these people were disciples of the same Sect, or were good acquaintances.

Some of these people had fierce and wicked auras, and from just one glance, it was quite evident that they weren’t to be provoked easily.

After a day, Yang Kai suddenly felt bursts of powerful energy fluctuations coming from a very far distance.

He immediately stopped and looked towards that direction with a stern gaze, feeling Emperor Pressure emanating from there. He was surprised by this and wondered who was breaking through to the Emperor Realm.
