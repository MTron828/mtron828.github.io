Even though a group of more than 100 Black Ink Clansmen had been destroyed, the battle still hadn’t ended.

More and more groups of Black Ink Clansmen of different numbers were fleeing from the resource harvesting area. These Black Ink Clansmen, who were basically half-dead from taking part in the great battle, could no longer form an effective formation. Not only were they apprehensive while running away, but they were scattered and in disarray. They just wanted to flee from this area and return to a safe place as soon as possible.

Although Yang Kai was the only one who had left the Warship to directly deal with the enemy, the Warship led by Xu Ling Gong would assist him. These dispirited Black Ink Clansmen no longer had the courage to keep fighting, so they were easily killed the moment they clashed with Yang Kai. Coupled with the Arrays on the Warship, they could effortlessly wipe out most of the enemies.

Of course, a small number of the Black Ink Clansmen were lucky enough to successfully flee.

It was a good start for the Humans. The Black Ink Clansmen were easily killed regardless of their numbers. First of all, these Black Ink Clansmen were scattered around. Secondly, there weren’t any truly powerful Masters, so they were unable to resist Yang Kai’s spear. The few Feudal Lords who appeared were all executed as soon as they arrived.

However, as time passed, it became increasingly difficult to deal with the enemies.

An increasing number of Black Ink Clansmen arrived at this place and were astonished upon seeing the intense battle taking place, thinking that the Humans had arranged an ambush here.

Nevertheless, when they had a clearer picture of the battle, they set their minds at ease.

There was indeed an ambush, but it was just a Squad-level Warship. In other words, only one Squad of Human soldiers was trying to ambush them here.

They had no idea why there was a Human Squad in this place, but they reckoned that these Squad members wanted to earn merits by trying to take advantage of them as they were injured, which was why the other party had left the main force of the Humans.

There was nothing to be afraid of since there was only a Squad. Following the Feudal Lords’ orders, countless High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen charged towards the Warship.

Instantly, Yang Kai felt immensely pressured.

Given his current strength, he wasn’t afraid of these High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen. Even if he was unable to kill them all, his only option was to flee. However, his purpose was not to flee, and he couldn’t showcase any of his Space Secret Techniques; therefore, when faced with the tide of Black Ink Clansmen, he could only grit his teeth and fight on.

Right then, two figures shot out of the Warship. They were none other than Xu Ling Gong and the other Seventh-Order Vice Squad Leader, who decided to help.

At that instant, 3 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, who were assisted by a Warship, began a massacre.

There were Black Ink Clansmen who were killed with every breath. Minced meat, dark blood, and Black Ink Strength soon covered the void.

Some of the Feudal Lords would hide among the cannon fodder and secretly approach the 3 of them, waiting for a chance to launch sneak attacks. In such a chaotic battle, even a veteran Seventh-Order Master like Xu Ling Gong was unable to detect such hidden danger.

Fortunately, Yang Kai still had some energy to spare as he continuously monitored their surroundings. Every time a Feudal Lord approached, he could instantly identify them.

After some of these reckless Feudal Lords were killed, the remaining Feudal Lords didn’t dare to move forward. They watched the battle from a distance as they wanted to deplete the energy of these Seventh-Order Humans using the cannon fodder before capturing them.

On the battlefield, Yang Kai sported a calm expression. His hands were steady as he wielded his spear, and every attack could deal critical damage to his enemies. He had rarely experienced a battle with such intensity, but everything was still within his control.

However, Xu Ling Gong and the Vice Squad Leader grew increasingly apprehensive. As they were surrounded by more and more Black Ink Clansmen, they couldn’t help but think that they might not survive this day.

A Squad of a dozen members in theory shouldn’t be able to resist such a large group of Black Ink Clansmen, so both of them were surprised that they had persevered for such a long time. However, they knew that the reason behind it was that Yang Kai had fended off most of the enemies. If not for him, their Squad would have been destroyed.

Rays of light were shot from the Arrays on the Warship into the Black Ink Clansmen, with each strike dealing a heavy blow to the enemies.

Nonetheless, even a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like Qing Kui was unable to sustain activating the arrays for such a long time. The defensive light around the Warship was also on the brink of collapsing following the relentless attacks from the Black Ink Clansmen.

Once the Warship’s shields failed, the Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters of the Squad would lose the Warship’s protection. When that happened, they would be unable to ward off the Black Ink Strength, thus falling into a perilous situation.

Even though they had been taking turns to operate the Arrays, they couldn’t get enough time to really rest given the battle’s intensity. It was simply impossible for them to persevere for long.

All the Squad members were exhausted after half a day of battle. Even Xu Ling Gong and his Seventh-Order Vice Squad Leader were no longer as ferocious as when they started. Only Yang Kai remained as ruthless and energetic as always.

The strength of an Open Heaven Realm Master’s heritage was manifested in such a battle.

In fact, Xu Ling Gong was supposedly more powerful than Yang Kai when it came to his heritage; after all, he was a veteran Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master while Yang Kai was a newly promoted one. Simply put, his cultivation was ahead of Yang Kai’s by thousands of years.

However, Yang Kai had the World Tree clone in his Small Universe, so he wasn’t afraid of Black Ink Strength at all; hence, there wasn’t a need for him to divert any of his power to resist Black Ink Strength in this battle.

On the other hand, Xu Ling Gong had to continuously spend a part of his World Force to fend off the Black Ink Strength, thus exhausting himself more quickly.

Moreover, the living beings inside Yang Kai’s Small Universe would constantly replenish and increase his heritage and World Force; therefore, his stamina was much greater than that of the average Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Additionally, every time the World Tree clone breathed, his World Force would be purified. That was the reason he could deal a heavier blow to the enemies than most Seventh-Order Humans.

Countless Black Ink Clansmen had lost their lives, including a number of Feudal Lords. As time passed, an increasing number of Black Ink Clansmen were killed, but this epic battle didn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon.

1,000 kilometres away from the battlefield, there was a large ship that was navigating through the void. On the large ship were defeated Black Ink Clansmen. Many of these injured people were lying on the deck and groaning in pain.

It could be said that they had suffered immense losses in the battle that had just ended. For some reason, the Humans had gone mad and mobilised a lot more soldiers than expected, which caught the Black Ink Clan off guard. Even the Territory Lords in charge of the battlefield were all badly wounded. One of the Territory Lords was even killed by two Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who had joined forces.

It wasn’t easy fleeing from the battlefield as the Humans were still relentlessly pursuing them, seizing every chance they could to kill even more.

It wasn’t until an hour ago that the Humans finally stopped chasing after them, which allowed these Black Ink Clansmen to take a breather. The pursuit also exacerbated the injuries of these Territory Lords. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Other than Hei Yuan, the other Territory Lords had fallen into a state of deep sleep. They had to be immediately sent to Black Ink Nests; otherwise, their rank might drop from their injuries.

They had already lost the battle, so if several Territory Lords saw their rank regress at the same time, Hei Yuan wouldn’t be able to explain himself to Mu Guang; after all, the number of Territory Lords that a Royal Lord commanded was a direct measure of their strength.

Therefore, Hei Yuan had to get back to his territory as soon as possible in order to send these unconscious Territory Lords into Black Ink Nests.

As for Hei Yuan himself, he was worn out as well. He yearned to get some rest inside his Black Ink Nest, but he was the only Territory Lord who was still conscious at this point. As such, he had to persevere to prevent any accidents from happening.

Unfortunately, what he dreaded most still happened. While he was lost in his thoughts, a Feudal Lord came to him quickly and reported, “Sir, there’s a battle going on 1,000 kilometres up ahead. There seems to be an ambush by the Humans!”

A shocked Hei Yuan rose from the large chair and shouted, “An ambush? Where did those Humans come from?”

The Feudal Lord was horrified, and faced with the pressure from his superior, he replied in a trembling voice, “I have no idea.”

“Go find out then!” Hei Yuan snapped.

“Yes!” The Feudal Lord left the place upon receiving the order.

An absent-minded Hei Yuan started pacing back and forth. He wasn’t even sure if he could survive since there was an ambush ahead of them.

Presently, he was in a terrible state. Even though there were other Territory Lords on the ship, they were injured and had all basically fallen into comas. Their foundations would be damaged if they were forcefully awakened, and it was questionable how much help they would be even if they were.

However, he couldn’t figure out why there was an ambush ahead of him.

It had to be noted that even though the Black Ink Clan had suffered tremendous losses in the previous battle, the Humans did not fare much better. Some of the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were horribly wounded, and if not for the Human deploying more reinforcements to join the battle, the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t have been humiliated so badly.

Nevertheless, the place in front of him was very close to the Black Ink Clan’s base, but the Humans had arranged an ambush there. Weren’t they worried that the Royal Lord would notice and decide to kill them?

When that happened, it would mean massive losses for the Humans, who were known for their cunning. It was inconceivable that they would do such a reckless thing.

In fact, if there was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the battle ahead of him, Hei Yuan would have no choice but to make a detour. Given the state he was in, he wouldn’t dare to directly deal with an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. He certainly had to flee.

Soon, the Feudal Lord returned and reported, “Sir, I’ve gathered some useful information. There’s only one Human Squad ahead of us.”

Upon hearing that, Hei Yuan sported a dumbfounded expression, “One Squad? Are you sure?”

The Feudal Lord nodded, “Yes, there’s only a Squad. I saw it with my eyes. There are only 3 Seventh-Order Humans while the rest aren’t worth our attention.”

“So there’s only one Squad…” Hei Yuan was startled for a moment before moving to the deck to intently observe the battlefield.

As a Territory Lord, he was able to see what was happening 1,000 kilometres away with ease, so soon he took in what was happening on the battlefield.

Just like his subordinate had reported, there was only a standard Human Squad with a Squad-level Warship in front of them. There were 3 Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, while the rest were in the Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order.

Hei Yuan’s expression still darkened though as he asked, “How did one Human Squad kill so many of our clansmen?”

He could see that a lot of minced meat and dark blood were scattered around the battlefield, which suggested that they had suffered immense losses.
