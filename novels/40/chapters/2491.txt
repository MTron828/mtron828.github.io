Yang Kai answered in a deep voice, “I have seen him a few times when he was active in Maplewood City before. Last time, during the opening of your Star Soul Palace’s Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, he was peddling a so-called Nine Revolutions Life Restoring Pill, a kind of ancient pill that can bring someone back to life from the brink of death! He even scammed Xiao Qi for a few Source Crystals!”

“Such a thing happened?” Everyone was shocked.

Lan Xun’s face turned ugly, “Isn’t he a swindler then?”

Lan Xun had never heard of the Nine Revolutions Life Restoring Pill before, not to mention the effects of bringing someone back to life from the dead. Spirit Pills with such an effect usually would be precious treasures to everyone and would definitely be kept for themselves, who would be willing to sell them?

Initially, when the old man stood up confidently, Lan Xun thought that he might be some hidden Master, and got her hopes up a little, but after hearing from Yang Kai, her expectations rapidly sank to the bottom.

If he was the same person Yang Kai was describing, he obviously was incompetent and wagging his tongue irresponsibly. What if the situation turned worse if he got near Mo Xiao Qi?

Liang Qiu condemned, “Old thing, quickly roll away from this Young Master’s sight!”

Although it was not entirely his fault, he was still a little responsible for Mo Xiao Qi’s condition, and if something happened to her, the Martial Beast Great Emperor may not necessarily listen to his explanation, so when he saw this old swindler approaching Mo Xiao Qi, Liang Qiu hurriedly thrust his spear to force him back, lest he acted recklessly and worsen the situation.

Mo Xiao Qi was only releasing her seal now, which was not harmful to herself yet, but Liang Qiu dared not to take the risk of allowing someone to set her off and end up causing her to die.

An astonishing power exploded as the spear thrust out, as if it could penetrate the void, ignoring the barrier of space, reaching in front of the old swindler in an instant.

Although Liang Qiu’s spear attack was fierce, there was no murderous intent behind it as he only meant to force the old swindler to withdraw.

However, the old swindler actually remained calm and dauntless in the face of a strike from an Emperor Realm Master, as if he did not sense the incoming danger. Instead, his focus remained unblinkingly on Mo Xiao Qi as a bright light flashed across the depths of his eyes.

The old swindler merely swung his hand lightly when the spear was about to crash into him.

His hand moved casually with a relaxed expression, just like shooing a fly away.

But the following scene could not have been more shocking. With just a casual wave of his hand, the old swindler completely dispersed the power of Liang Qiu’s spear thrust, nullifying it without even a bit of fallout.

It seemed like Liang Qiu was not attacking an old man with only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, but a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master. The gesture of the old swindler actually showed the demeanour of a senior expert, giving off an unfathomable feeling.

The sharp visual conflict flabbergasted everyone, and all gasped in shock.

Liang Qiu could not believe his eyes and after being stunned for a while had to rub them hard to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.

But over there, the old man clearly stood unscathed, not even a wrinkle on his clothes.

“What the hell!?” Liang Qiu exclaimed, taking a heavy beating to his pride and feeling quite depressed.

Previously, he wanted to rely on his Emperor Realm cultivation to teach Yang Kai a lesson, but Yang Kai repelled him with his bare fists; and now, his spear attack was easily dispelled by this old man.

Liang Qiu couldn’t believe such a scene was possible if it had not happened to him directly.

Were all Dao Source Realm cultivators so powerful nowadays that they can easily counter the strikes of an Emperor Realm Master? If so, why is everyone still trying so hard to reach the Emperor Realm? Why not just stay in the Dao Source Realm forever?

Or… was it just Liang Qiu himself? Had he not truly reached the Emperor Realm and everything was all in his head?

A look of defeat crept onto his face as countless thoughts flashed across Liang Qiu’s mind, causing him to lose spirit.

Yang Kai was bewildered too.

Although he managed to resist a blow from Liang Qiu before, he still could not deny that Liang Qiu was strong. If they really fought to the death, Yang Kai would not have an easy time defeating him; after all, Liang Qiu also had an extraordinary aptitude and was the top disciple of Hundred Barbarian Mountain, a peak Sect in the Western Territory. He was a one in a million kind of genius.

Yang Kai knew exactly how powerful that spear attack was, and even though it would not be too difficult for him to resolve such a strike, he would definitely not be able to do so as calmly and easily as the old swindler.

Who was this old man? Could he be some kind of Master who hid his cultivation?

However, that seemed impossible when Yang Kai thought more about it, because during the opening of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda of Star Soul Palace last time, only cultivators at the Origin King Realm were allowed to enter. Since the old man could enter, it meant that he was indeed an Origin King at that time.

In just a few years, breaking through to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm was already an astonishing feat, so the chances of this old swindler still hiding his cultivation was basically close to zero.

It was just that… Yang Kai did not understand how he had dispelled Liang Qiu’s blow.

Not only Yang Kai, everyone present did not understand either and still could not calm themselves down from the unbelievable scene.

But after this, no one dared to look down on this old swindler anymore.

Even if he was really a swindler, given that he could resolve an Emperor Realm Master’s attack in just a wave of his hand, he was undoubtedly a powerful swindler!

“Young man, don’t be so impulsive. This Old Master is not as vigorous as young people like you and cannot stand too much reckless fighting,” the old man responded lightly after resolving Liang Qiu’s attack.

Liang Qiu was exasperated at his words, feeling like the old man was mocking him for his incompetence.

“Senior…” Lan Xun looked at the old man and questioned with a trembling voice, “Are you sure that you have a way to solve Little Sister Xiao Qi’s problem?”

After witnessing the amazing skill of the old swindler, Lan Xun regained some confidence in him. There were always some mysterious old masters in this world that liked to hide, normally appearing inconspicuous and avoiding standing out, but when they were needed in some critical moment, they would bloom with astounding brilliance.

Perhaps this old man whom Yang Kai accused of being a swindler was one such Master.

Thrilled, Lan Xun changed her way of addressing him. Although they were both Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators, she still called him Senior.

Unexpectedly, the old man accepted the title comfortably and replied with a faint smile, “I can give it a try.”

Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes lit up and immediately asked, “Does Senior know about the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal? I once heard from Lord Father that the technique Sir Martial Beast used to seal the Heavenly Illusion Butterfly is the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal, which is extremely mysterious and dreadfully complicated. But in this world, only the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal is capable of sealing a Divine Spirit’s Soul.”

The old man shook his head, “The Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal is one of the Martial Beast Great Emperor’s best-kept Secret Techniques. This Old Master has not had the opportunity to study it.”

Lan Xun’s face darkened, “Then what should we do?”

She initially thought that this Senior was well versed in sealing techniques, but now listening to his words, she couldn’t help feeling disappointed again.

The Bright Moon Great Emperor did tell her that the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal was the only way to seal a Divine Spirit’s Soul successfully, so how could this Senior re-seal the Divine Spirit’s Soul without knowing such a profound technique?

But it was also true that the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal was an original creation of the Martial Beast Great Emperor, so even when her Lord Father asked him about it, he just changed the subject and was unwilling to reveal anything to him.

‘That old bastard Martial Beast is really too stingy!’ The criticism of the Bright Moon Great Emperor flashed vividly in Lan Xun’s mind.

“That bastard Martial Beast has always been stingy with his treasures, he doesn’t even share his good wines with his friends, so how could he be willing to pass out the Burning Moon Rainbow Flower Seal?” The old swindler muttered in complaint under his breath, and even though he spoke softly, the Emperor Realm Masters nearby were still able to hear his words clearly.

All of them almost fainted listening to his complaint.

The Martial Beast Great Emperor was one of the Ten Great Emperors. His cultivation was as high as the Heavens, and his status was transcendent. To the entire Star Boundary, his existence was akin to that of a god. Whenever his name was mentioned, everyone expressed admiration and worship, as he was the symbol of the Star Boundary’s supreme strength, but when this old man spoke, that same Martial Beast Great Emperor had become a ‘bastard’.

Such disrespect to the Great Emperor!

On the other hand, Lan Xun wore a look of ponderance on her face.

Because the way this old man spoke… Was exactly like how her father had.

The old man seemed to be aware of his flagrant words and hurriedly diverted attention by changing the topic, “This Old Master is not capable of re-sealing the Divine Spirit’s Soul.”

“What?” Yang Kai’s face darkened after hearing this and he snapped, “If you are not capable of doing so, why are you acting like you have a card up your sleeve? Do you enjoy toying with this Young Master’s feelings!?”

The old man grinned, “This Old Master is not capable, but someone else here is.”

“Ah?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows, his eyes immediately swept around and finally fixed on Yao Si. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If anyone here could re-seal the Divine Spirit’s Soul, it would be a descendant of a Great Emperor who had equal status to Mo Xiao Qi; Lan Xun was definitely incapable of this, so Yao Si was the only remaining hope.

Seeing Yang Kai looking at him, Yao Si simply stated, “Saving people is not my strength. My specialty is killing people. Do you want me to try?”

Yang Kai glared at him before turning back to the old man, “Don’t be so garrulous, quickly tell us who that person who can help is.”

The old man laughed gently, “Young people are really impatient. Don’t worry, it will still take some time for this seal to be completely released; after all, this is her first time unsealing it and the Divine Spirit’s Soul would need to fuse with this little girl first before it can move about freely.”

Noticing Yang Kai’s face that had turned uglier, the old man eventually stopped blabbering and lifted his head, turning a solemn look towards a certain individual and beckoning to her, “You, little girl, come and help this Old Master.”

Following the direction he gestured, everyone turned to look and saw a pale-faced young woman standing there, her Source Qi was fluctuating unstably due to some unknown reason.

Zhang Ruo Xi!

Yang Kai looked at her in befuddlement.

He did not expect that the person who the old man mentioned was actually Zhang Ruo Xi!

Now that he was paying attention though, it seemed that ever since Mo Xiao Qi began the unsealing process, Zhang Ruo Xi’s condition had turned a bit abnormal too. However, due to the seriousness of the Divine Soul Seal, Yang Kai had not paid attention to Zhang Ruo Xi and had only secretly ordered Liu Yan to take good care of her and only inform him if something went wrong.

At this moment, the old man was clearly beckoning to Zhang Ruo Xi, requesting her to help him.

[What does this old man want to do?] Yang Kai was utterly puzzled.
