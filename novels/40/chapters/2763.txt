“We also have to carefully consider what we have to buy and sell. If not, not only might we fail to make a profit, we might even suffer a loss.”

Hua Qing Si replied, “I will personally go to the Southern Territory to conduct an investigation.”

If this matter was handled properly, it would be a huge deal for High Heaven Palace’s future! Despite Yang Kai’s currently extreme level of wealth, and having both Fire Dragon Palace and Full Sky Sect owing a huge debt to the High Heaven Palace, the Sect would still need a way to support itself if he wanted it to grow in the future.

Not staying in the High Heaven Palace for long, Yang Kai returned to the Southern Territory the next day.

After a number of days, Yang Kai looked towards the continuous undulating mountain range in the distance as he travelled swiftly over.

That mountain range was Azure Sun Mountain Range where Azure Sun Temple’s headquarters was located. Although he only held an in-name disciple title within Azure Sun Temple, with Azure Sun Golden Token in his hand, Gao Xue Ting and even Wen Zi Shan treated him with importance. Having come back to the Southern Territory, it made sense to visit Azure Sun Temple.

Furthermore, Yang Kai also wanted to take a trip into the Divine Ascension Mirror to inform Tian Yan about the good news of having found the Flesh Incarnation Fruit.

Originally, he had planned to refine the Flesh Incarnation Pill personally; however, with a helper like Ji Ying working under him, Yang Kai would naturally hand this task over to him. Before leaving, Yang Kai had already left the necessary herbs behind in the High Heavens Palace, and he believed that he would be able to obtain the Flesh Incarnation Pill the next time he went back.

With the Flesh Incarnation Pill, Tian Yan would be able to mould a physical body for himself, and thus extricate himself from the fetters of the Divine Ascension Mirror. He would be able to enter the Star Boundary and become a strong ally for High Heaven Palace.

With a Great Emperor-level Master as his patron, High Heaven Palace would eventually become a Great Emperor Sect despite not being one at the moment. When that happened, its status absolutely wouldn’t be inferior to Star Soul Palace or Serene Soul Palace.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai came to a halt. Turning towards a certain direction, he furrowed his brow and called out, “Which friend is being so sneaky? Why not show yourself?”

As his voice rang out, a glow of light suddenly blossomed from the void in that direction. The dazzling brilliance forced Yang Kai to narrow his eyes, and by the time the light had dimmed down, two extraordinary silhouettes had appeared.

One of them was a middle-aged male, his face pale with no traces of facial hair. A look that was brimming with might, yet devoid of anger was present on his face. The other person was a youth who appeared to be close to Yang Kai’s age. Cutting a suave and elegant demeanour, his brow appeared like slanted swords, positioned above his twinkling star-like eyes. Standing beside each other, those two people seemed to share similar physical features, as though they were a father-son pair.

Compared to the latter, the middle-aged male had an indifferent look on his face. On the contrary, an eager, competitive spirit rose within the youth’s eyes when he looked over towards Yang Kai.

“Senior Xiao!” Yang Kai’s brow rose.

Xiao Yu Yang replied, “So it’s you, Yang Kai?”

“Indeed,” Yang Kai nodded his head before looking over to the youth and giving a faint smile, “Brother Xiao, I trust you’ve been well since the trip to the Shattered Star Sea?”

These two were members of Star Soul Palace, whom Yang Kai had recognized in a single glance.

There was no need to talk about the youth Xiao Chen, whom Yang Kai had had quite a few exchanges with and would always be by the side of Princess Lan Xu, playing the role of the protector. As for his father, Xiao Yu Yang, he was the first Emperor Realm Master Yang Kai had met after his entry into the Star Boundary. At that time, he was a Star Soul Palace Silver Star Envoy with a Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation that made him an existence that Yang Kai needed to look up to.

After these years though, Xiao Yu Yang’s aura seemed to have grown increasingly vibrant and extraordinary, which meant that he had impressively reached the Third-Order Emperor Realm! As for Xiao Chen, his cultivation was not weak either, being at the First-Order Emperor Realm. From the look of it, Xiao Chen had benefited quite a bit since his trip to the Shattered Star Sea.

These two people had suddenly popped up here. Furthermore, they had just so happened to block Yang Kai’s path, so it was easy to see what their intentions were.

The deaths of Star Soul Palace Elder Tan Jun Hao and Deacon Wu Ming had left Star Soul Palace investigating ever since. As they continued to investigate, they had naturally ended up focusing on Yang Kai; however, the latter had been elusive in his recent movements, to the point where even a Great Emperor Sect like Star Soul Palace, with its long reach and extensive network, was still unable to get a good grasp of his location.

Suddenly, a month or so ago, they had received a message from a disciple of theirs by the name of Luo Ping, saying he spotted Yang Kai in Maplewood City.

Xiao Yu Yang proceeded to rush over without stopping. Being one of Star Soul Palace’s Elders and possessing extraordinarily high cultivation, him being dragged into this matter wasn’t because of them giving respect to Yang Kai, but rather, it was because of the information Star Soul Palace had collected about both Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming meeting their deaths at Yang Kai’s hands. This terrifying result meant that anyone lacking in cultivation would be useless against Yang Kai. Only a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would be able to accomplish this task.

For the sake of Tan Jun Hao, the few Third-Order Emperor Realm Elders of Star Soul Palace had all been mobilized, searching for Yang Kai’s whereabouts in all directions.

Knowing that Yang Kai was a disciple of Azure Sun Temple, Xiao Yu Yang had faintly suspected that there was a possibility of Yang Kai returning to Azure Sun Temple after his sudden appearance in Maplewood City, which led him to lay in ambush here. Yang Kai’s appearance proved his decision to be correct, as he had finally managed to come face-to-face with Yang Kai after painstakingly waiting here for half a month.

After hearing Yang Kai’s words, Xia Chen grinned, “Who are you? Do I know you?”

His haughty and lofty stance gave him the appearance of having an exceedingly overwhelming superiority complex.

Having crossed paths with him several times, Yang Kai was well aware of this irksome trait of Xiao Chen’s; therefore, he did not get angry. On the contrary, he gave a faint smile and looked towards Xiao Yu Yang, “May I know why Senior Xiao had obstructed this Junior’s path?”

“You still dare to ask about the obvious?” In a fit of anger, Xiao Chen pointed his finger at Yang Kai, “Are you not clear about what you’ve done? You dare put on such a shameless act!?”

With a faint smile, Yang Kai replied, “I don’t understand what Brother Xiao is talking about.”

Xiao Chen’s expression instantly turned gloomy, “Are you really unaware, or are you just feigning ignorance?”

Not giving a damn about him anymore, Yang Kai proceeded to turn and look at Xiao Yu Yang, letting Xiao Chen continue fuming in anger.

Xiao Yu Yang stood with his hands behind his back, a calm expression present on his face. Nevertheless, he was sighing in admiration and astonishment within his heart. Before this matter had occurred, he did not know much about Yang Kai. The only thing he faintly remembered was that a Dao Source Realm Junior had refined a furnace of Extraordinary Treasure Pills in the Four Seasons Realm. That brought the person into the spotlight, and that person was precisely Yang Kai.

Other than that, Xiao Yu Yang did not know anything else about him. Therefore, he had talked about it in detail with Xiao Chen over the last few days on this matter. Only then did he discover how outstanding this youth was. From what he could tell, every matter that Yang Kai had done was exceedingly hard to accomplish. Although his son was a dragon among men, he still somewhat paled in comparison to Yang Kai.

At this moment, Xiao Yu Yang’s appraisal of Yang Kai rose another notch. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

In front of an Elder of Star Soul Palace possessing a Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, this First-Order Emperor Realm Junior showed not even a trace of intimidation or fear. On the contrary, he continued to chat in a calm and relaxed manner.

Did he really kill Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming? Deep feelings of doubt surged within Xiao Yu Yang’s heart. With Yang Kai’s current level of strength, and with the fact that both Tan Jun Hao and Wu Ming weren’t just ordinary Masters, how could that be possible? How could they have died at this Junior’s hand?

However, during the investigations conducted by Star Soul Palace, there were over twenty Emperor Realm Masters that testified to this effect. Even if Tan Jun Han and Wu Ming’s deaths were not caused by Yang Kai, it was absolutely related to him.

“Tan Jun Hao, Wu Ming!” Xiao Yu Yang only spoke those two names as he shot a deep gaze right at Yang Kai’s eyes, seemingly wanting to bore right to the depths of his soul to see any shift or sliver of fluctuation present within.

Raising his brow, Yang Kai replied, “So, it’s about that matter… Yes, if Senior Xiao is investigating the matter of those two people, this Junior can inform Senior Xiao that I was the one who killed them.”

He admitted this in an exceedingly frank manner, with not a single trace of wanting to conceal this fact.

“Bullshit!” Xiao Chen snapped back with a look of contempt and ridicule, an obvious indication of his disbelief.

“It’s said that you had an impressively strong Monster King by your side at the time, yes?” Xiao Yu Yang deliberately pointed out, “Where is that Monster King who acted?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “The Monster King wasn’t there at the time.”

Xiao Yu Yang said in a deep tone, “Yang Kai, you’re a talented youth, and this King doesn’t wish to cause difficulties for you. Tell this King the location of that Monster King, before following me back to Star Soul Palace.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “Does Senior Xiao believe that Tan Jun Han and Wu Ming met their deaths at the hands of that Monster King?”

“Is there any other possibility?”

Yang Kai burst into laughter and shook his head incessantly. Never did he imagine that no one would believe the truth that he had just stated. After mumbling to himself, his expression turned solemn before he replied, “Being an Elder of Star Soul Palace, Tan Jun Han represented Star Soul Palace and the Bright Moon Great Emperor. It was his solemn duty to protect and guide us Southern Territory cultivators; however, in Flowing Shadow City, he engaged in a plethora of perverse actions and used despicable methods to control various Emperor Realm Masters present at the time, before inciting them to attack this Junior all in order to kill me and pilfer my treasures. This Junior responded in kind and killed him, which can only be considered helping Star Soul Palace clean up their trash. This Junior doesn’t need the gratitude of the Great Emperor or Star Soul Palace and is fine with you all not trying to find trouble for me. Yet, Senior Xiao has obstructed my path today! If this is Star Soul Palace’s attitude, this Junior… feels extremely disappointed!”

“It’s not your place to decide about the matters of our Star Soul Palace!” Xiao Chen snorted coldly.

Xiao Yu Yang nodded and added, “Our Star Soul Palace has done a thorough investigation into the details of the matter. Tan Jun Hao was inhumane, oppressive, and tyrannical, damaging the reputation of our Star Soul Palace with his actions. There isn’t anything worth pitying about his death. If he was really killed by you, the matter would be confined between you and our Star Soul Palace; however, if he was killed at the hands of a Monster King… it would be a different story, do you understand?”

Yang Kai gave an impatient reply, “The Monster King did not take action. Didn’t those Emperors inform you of this?”

Xiao Yu Yang replied, “They’ve mentioned it. However, it is really hard to believe their words. Therefore, I need you to follow me back to Star Soul Palace. This Xiao will guarantee that no one will treat you unfairly. The only thing you need to tell this Xiao is the location of the Monster King.”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, “I’m unable to agree with your request, Senior Xiao.”

“You don’t believe me…” Xiao Yu Yang’s forehead started to wrinkle up slightly.

Yang Kai replied, “I’m not close at all to Senior Xiao, so how can I trust you?”

“It’s a waste of breath to continue this discussion. Father, there’s no need to continue this nonsense with him. Let me take action and take him down.” Filled with eagerness, Xiao Chen could no longer contain himself. Drawing his sword, a metallic hum accompanied the blossoming of Sword Qi as he hurtled towards Yang Kai with a cold snort, “You think you’re extraordinary after being breaking through to the Emperor Realm, huh? Let me show you today the disparity between you and me!”

Emperor Pressure radiated out as Sword Intent filled the skies. The humming sounds continued to ring out as Xiao Chen’s expression turned solemn, before he growled, “The fragrance of plum blossoms wafts out from the snow, and the crescent moon reflects in the mirror to shine across the skies!”

His first action was to unleash an exceedingly powerful killing move. Furthermore, his Sword Intent had a beautiful appearance, causing people to be dazzled by it.

Yang Kai chuckled in response, “I was thinking something similar!”

Assuming a casual stance, Yang Kai sent a light palm towards the incoming Sword Wave.

Xiao Yu Yang felt a sense of satisfaction within his heart after seeing his son unleash his sword move; however, his expression changed drastically upon seeing Yang Kai’s palm.
