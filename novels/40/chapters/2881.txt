The city that once belonged to a huge Clan of the Barbarian Race was now filled and surrounded by Demon Qi since it was long ago occupied by the Demon Race. However, at this moment, the huge city appeared to be quiet and silent. Not even a single person could be seen on the streets, as if it had become a dead city.

Clouds of black mist floated from a distance at an extremely fast speed, and stopped in the sky above the city in the blink of an eye, revealing the figures of several Demon Kings.

There were quite a few of them, as many as five, and the leader among them did not have any flesh and blood but was just a dark and tall skeleton with two constantly flickering ghost fires in his eye sockets.

Bone Demon Fei Li.

“We were too late!” A Demon King standing behind Fei Li swept his Divine Sense across the city as his complexion sank. The other Demon Kings did not look pleased either, except for Fei Li, who could not show any expressions without a physique; however, the ghost fire in his sockets danced even more animated as if reflecting the anger in his heart.

“This is the nineteenth place! Damn that foreign race bastard!” The Demon King who was speaking gritted his teeth as if he held deep grudges against someone.

Another Demon King stood forward and frowned, “I remember that before that foreign race escaped from Senior Mo Duo, he once said, three hundred thousand of the South Barbarian Clan were annihilated, and we Demons would have to pay the same price. Is he really planning to kill three hundred thousand clansmen before he gives up? Where does he get the energy?”

That was three hundred thousand Demons, not three hundred thousand insects. In fact, even three hundred thousand insects would take a lot of effort to kill.

But facts showed that this foreign race had infiltrated deep into Demon occupied territory since the day he fled, and wherever he went, all Demons stationed there would be wiped out, including Demon Kings.

Within a month, just one month, that foreign race boy had already raided nineteen places, turning the nineteen Demon Race bases into ghost towns with no survivors.

Mo Duo was infuriated about this and even personally went to track down the whereabouts of the foreign race. What frustrated the Demon Saint though was that this boy was extremely cunning and managed to avoid him every time, even managing to escape when they came within a hundred kilometres of one another.

He never confronted the Demon Saint and only targeted weaker subordinates.

Moreover, the way he killed the Demons was extremely strange. Ninety-nine percent of the Demons who died had no obvious wounds, only a look of terror on each of their dead faces. It was as if they had encountered something that petrified them, and then they died of fear.

That foreign race’s savage harassment exhausted a large part of the Demons’ energy. In one month, more than a hundred thousand Demons, including five Demon Kings, had died at his hands. Such a loss could not be regarded as a small one for the Demon Race, and although there were as many as two hundred Demon Kings who participated in this invasion, even that number could not withstand such intense consumption.

Most of the Demon Saints were recuperating from their injuries at this time, and although Mo Duo rushed here to provide reinforcements, for certain reasons he could not exert his full strength. The Demon Kings were the mainstay force of the Demon Race, the firm rock in the stream that was their war against the foreign race. It would be extremely detrimental to the future of the Demons if too many of them were killed.

The Demons’ front line shrank rapidly, and the Demon Kings no longer dared to act alone, instead gathering in groups of three to five, partly to resist the attack of the foreign race army, and also to track the whereabouts of that foreign Shaman Grandmaster.

Looking at the city below, Fei Li stated, “I remember this is Ba Han’s territory, but I can’t detect his aura. Someone go take a look and find out what happened to him.”

“I’ll go and investigate,” The Demon King who spoke first hesitated for a moment before taking the initiative to volunteer, turning and descending into the largest building in the city.

The remaining four Demon Kings released their Divine Sense in vigilance. Although they had not encountered that foreign race during this period of time, every place they went was a cemetery, and no one could guarantee that the foreign Shaman Grandmaster would not try to ambush them here.

Every Demon King was terrified of that foreign Shaman Grandmaster because he had the ability to kill Demon Kings!

The surroundings were quiet, but the air was inexplicably cold. Except for Bone Demon Fei Li, the remaining three Demon Kings felt slightly nervous.

Right at this moment, a wave of Demon Qi fluctuated and disappeared in a flash, followed by a building below suddenly collapsing into dust.

The expressions of several Demon Kings changed as their Divine Senses surged over that area like a tide; however, they were baffled by their findings because there was nothing there, not even the companion who offered to investigate the situation, his aura vanishing entirely.

Someone started calling the name of the Demon King, but there was no response.

The hair-raising situation made them faintly realize that their companions had probably encountered tragedy. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He’s here!” Fei Li shouted in a low voice, his skull twisting left and right, the ghost fire in his eye sockets flashing wildly, as if he was searching for the enemy’s trail.

The remaining three Demon Kings, perceiving danger from the hidden enemy, each took out their Demonic Artifact, pushed their Demon Qi, and prepared for battle.

The air seemed to have frozen, and the tense atmosphere sent every hair on the Demon Kings’ bodies upright. They searched desperately, but still could not detect a trace of the foreign Shaman, leaving them feeling helpless and frustrated.

This was how it always was, with this strange enemy appearing and disappearing mysteriously, leaving them constantly on edge.

But every Demon King knew that the enemy had not left, but was still hiding in the dark, ready to deliver a fatal blow to any Demon King who let their guard down.

Many wished that Mo Ke Tuo was here! She was a master at concealment and assassination, and with her ability, she could definitely track down the foreign Shaman Grandmaster.

“Behind!” Fei Li suddenly shouted, causing the three anxious Demon Kings to react instinctively. Fei Li already raised his hand, and a wildfire-like attack shot towards that direction.

The other three Demon Kings also released their attacks together towards the empty space.

They could not sense the aura of the foreign Shaman Grandmaster, but Fei Li was the strongest and most senior among them, so they all believed his judgment.

All the attacks converged at one place, but did not produce the desired effect, and just when the three Demon Kings were still in befuddlement, a muffled grunt echoed.

One of the Demon Kings looked down at his chest with wide eyes, and saw a skeleton hand passing through it, holding onto his two Demon Hearts.

This skeleton hand was very familiar, and this Demon King simply could not believe what he was seeing.

“Fei Li?”

The other two Demon Kings were scared out of their wits by the sudden change. Unable to fathom why Fei Li, who had been fighting side by side with them, would suddenly move against his own people, their minds froze up for a moment.

A ghostly figure appeared at that moment and rushed at them like lightning, sweeping past a Demon King and stopping ten steps away.

*Pu…*

There was a sound of blood gushing out, and the Demon King fixed his eyes on a figure about seven metres tall covered in scales with short horns on his head; that could only be the foreign Shaman Grandmaster!

However, at this moment, the foreign Shaman Grandmaster was holding half of a corpse in each of his hands. Blood and viscera spilled wildly from the Demon King that was completely torn apart by him.

“Shaman Niu!” The remaining Demon King shrieked, feeling his blood freeze in his veins.

There were five of them originally. No one knew what happened to the one who went to investigate the empty city, but his end was likely disastrous. One was attacked and had his Demon Hearts taken out by Fei Li, condemning him to death in the near future, while another Demon King was torn apart by Shaman Niu.

Only one remained now!

This survivor’s expression changed rapidly at that thought and eyes moving from Yang Kai to Fei Li, he asked with heartache, “Why?”

Fei Li had obviously betrayed the Demon Race, otherwise he would not have attacked his companions, and even more misled and attracted others’ attention to himself. If it weren’t for him interfering, no matter how powerful this foreign Shaman Grandmaster was, the several Demon Kings would have the power to fight him, but now?

It’s just that he couldn’t understand why Fei Li betrayed the demons. He was a Demon King, and he was the best among those in the same Realm. What could the Human Race possibly give him to make him throw away his dignity as a Demon?

“Since you have already guessed it, why do you need to ask?” Fei Li replied coldly. As soon as the skeleton hand exerted some force, the demon heart in the palm of his hand burst open, and the light in the eyes of the Demon King who’s his chest had been punched through quickly dimmed and went out.

Fei Li shook his hand, as if he had to clean off something dirty, and the Demon King’s body plunged straight down.

“You are a disgrace to the Demon Race!” The eyes of the Demon King who was still alive blazed with unprecedented anger, as if to burn Fei Li.

Between enemies and traitors, the latter has always been more abhorrent.

The ghost fire in Fei Li’s eyes jumped for a moment, and rushed towards him without saying a word.

The two Demon Kings immediately started fighting each other, and when the Demonic Qi surged, they were inseparable.

But Fei Li was much stronger than them. Judging by what Yang Kai could see, Fei Li was a High-Rank Demon King. Even among the High-Rank Demon Kings, he may be ranked high, but his opponent was only a Mid-Rank Demon King.

The difference might just be a small realm, but this was a chasm that cannot be bridged.

It’s like the gap between a Second-Order Emperor and a Third-Order Emperor.

This battle didn’t last long. Under Yang Kai’s cold eyes, Fei Li only spent a stick of incense before smashing the opponent’s body, shattering his Demon Heart, and making it so he could not be resurrected.

Five Demon Kings came here together, and in the end, only Fei Li survived.

“Sir!” In that huge battle, Fei Li did not show any signs of fatigue, and bowed his head to salute Yang Kai.

Yang Kai lifted the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique and restored his original appearance. In order to kill him with one blow he had to use it. After all, the Demon Kings were not that easy to kill.

Glancing at him coldly, Yang Kai said, “Why did not tell me earlier about Mo Duo’s arrival?”

A month ago, if Yang Kai had got the news of Mo Duo a day or two earlier, then the Southern Barbarians might not have perished. At least they would not have suffered so many losses. But it was just one or two days of delay, and 300,000 of the Southern Barbarian Tribe were lost.
