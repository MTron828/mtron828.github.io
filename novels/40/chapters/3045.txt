After the talk, Zhu Lie returned to his residence, leaving Yang Kai alone on the island. A myriad of dark expressions came over Yang Kai as he was still boiling with anger over what he had learned from Zhu Lie.

[It will be Zhu Qing’s wedding next month?] All of a sudden, Yang Kai looked up at the sky and began to laugh. His Emperor Pressure surged as he sent a circular shock wave across the island using his Emperor Qi.

The trees shook violently, and the sandstorm plunged the beautiful island into chaos. After Yang Kai stopped laughing, he turned his head and looked in a particular direction. At the other end of the island, there was a small area of purple corals in the sea. The corals were beautiful and looked just like crystals.

After stomping his foot, Yang Kai leapt into the air and disappeared into the night sky, upon which the atmosphere on the island became serene again.

A long time later, the corals contorted and transformed into a curvy and beautiful lady who was clad in purple clothes. Staring in the direction Yang Kai disappeared, she batted her alluring eyes and curled up her lips, “It seems that I’ve discovered a big secret! Zhu Lie, I’ll definitely get you this time. You’ll have to pay the price for looking down on me!”

Elated, she giggled for a bit and came up with all sorts of dirty tricks in her mind. After that, she turned around to leave.

Right then she stiffened as, all of a sudden, a chill was sent down her spine as though all her blood had been frozen. It was because she saw that Yang Kai, who had left the place earlier, appeared again and stood right there in silence. With bloodshot eyes, he was glaring at her, as though she was dead meat.

“You…” Flabbergasted, Fu Ling instinctively moved backwards in an attempt to widen the gap between them.

She had heard the conversation between Zhu Lie and Yang Kai earlier, so she knew that this average-looking Human was formidable. Therefore, her first reaction was to flee instead of battling against him.

It wasn’t that she was timid, as members of the Dragon Clan were never afraid of battle. They were the most powerful creatures in the world as well as the leaders of all Divine Spirits. They only respected Masters from the same clan. The reason she was retreating was that she knew she was no match for Yang Kai.

She was only a Sixth-Order Dragon, while even Eighth-Order Dragons like Zhu Lie and Zhu Qing were defeated by Yang Kai previously. Naturally, she couldn’t defeat Yang Kai either.

It had to be said that she had made a wise decision. As long as she could widen the gap between her and Yang Kai and disappear into the sea, she could possibly escape unscathed, given her ability to transform into various different forms.

Moving at full speed, Fu Ling turned into a Purple Dragon and broke through the void.

On the other hand, Yang Kai didn’t seem to be moving his body at all as he stared coldly at her. However, he was able to remain three steps away from her and make sure that she couldn’t escape from him.

The colour drained from Fu Ling’s beautiful face as she pushed her Dragon Essence in an attempt to call for help. Although it might not be useful at all, it might scare Yang Kai off for a moment.

“Look at me!” Yang Kai growled as his voice transmitted straight into Fu Ling’s eardrums.

Fu Ling instinctively raised her head, only to see that Yang Kai had transformed into a 45-metre long Half-Dragon. His towering figure was like a mountain pressing against her chest, making her unable to breathe. The Dragon Pressure he released seemed to have made her blood freeze, as she couldn’t even utilize half of her power.

What terrified Fu Ling most was that Yang Kai’s left eye was golden, which caused her mind to destabilize and her Soul to shake. Following that, a huge claw was seen coming at her.

Flustered, Fu Ling felt her heart fill with fear. She wanted to call for help, but she couldn’t utter a word, as though she had plunged into a nightmare. The next moment, she was sucked into something. The sea and the island disappeared from her sight and a huge area of land magically appeared beneath her feet, and the view around her had changed.

With her knees on the ground, she coughed for a bit and gasped for air, her face as pale as a white sheet. At that moment, her clothes were soaking wet, so they now stuck closely to her body, outlining her voluptuous figure. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Suddenly, a pair of big feet came into view.

Fu Ling raised her head with difficulty and looked up at the towering man as her tender body shook uncontrollably. Her nightmarish experience just now caused her to look particularly pitiful, adding to her appeal at the moment.

Although she knew that Yang Kai was powerful, she didn’t expect that she still couldn’t escape from him after she used all her strength to flee. [What’s going on with him? He’s more terrifying than what Zhu Lie described!]

Right after Zhu Lie and Zhu Qing returned to Dragon Island some time ago, they went to meet the Elders. After that, Zhu Qing was imprisoned. Recently, it was announced that she was to marry Fu Chi, which sent a shock wave across Dragon Island.

After all, there was a layer of mystery surrounding this incident, so all of them wanted to find out the truth. It was the same for Fu Ling. Women were intrinsically gossipy, and the Dragon Clan members were no exception. After putting in some effort, she was finally able to get some useful information.

It was said that Zhu Qing fell in love with a Human after she left the island some time ago. That was fine and all, but what wasn’t acceptable was that she wanted to get married to him. She returned to Dragon Island just to ask for the Elders’ approval.

That Human was named Yang Kai. It was said that he had obtained the Ancestral Dragon Source, which was an extremely fortuitous event for him.

However, he was a Human after all, so there was no way the Elders would agree to Zhu Qing’s request. A similar event had happened more than ten years ago, and that woman was pushed into the Dragon Grave and wouldn’t be able to come out ever again, so her ending was even more miserable than Zhu Qing’s.

Now, Zhu Qing had been confined to the Second Elder’s Spirit Island, and she was going to marry Fu Chi in one month. Fu Ling had no idea how the Elders would handle that Human, but his future was definitely bleak.

The Dragon Clan would certainly deal with him after Fu Chi and Zhu Qing’s wedding, for they couldn’t tolerate the fact that the Ancestral Dragon Source had fallen under a Human’s control.

Fu Ling knew a thing or two about Yang Kai, but she didn’t expect that he was reckless enough to sneak into Dragon Island. If she hadn’t come across Zhu Lie and followed him to this place, she wouldn’t have discovered this shocking secret.

However, now, she regretted the fact that she had been exposed. She was no match for Yang Kai, so she wondered what her ending would be. After struggling internally for a bit, she suddenly leapt into the air and travelled more than a few thousand metres.

Turning around, she was elated to see that Yang Kai remained on the same spot while he was looking at her coldly. Nevertheless, he didn’t seem to have the intention of chasing after her.

Without any hesitation, Fu Ling roared and transformed into a Purple Dragon before she shot up into the sky and hovered around the clouds.

“You’re doomed. My clansmen are coming over now. If you kneel and beg me now, I might consider sparing your life.” With a faint smile, Fu Ling stopped moving and stared at Yang Kai from a few thousand metres away.

The Secret Technique she just used was a call for help. She believed that all the Dragon Clan members on Dragon Island were coming over now, so she wasn’t afraid of Yang Kai anymore. Having regained her confidence, she was able to set her mind at ease and return to her human form.

Without uttering a word, Yang Kai stared mockingly at her. There wasn’t any trace of anxiety on his face.

Surprised, Fu Ling sized him up and asked, “Aren’t you afraid?”

“Why should I be afraid?” Yang Kai grinned.

Fu Ling nodded, “You’re indeed bold.” She flung her hair back casually upon finishing her words. After the fear in her heart disappeared, she became charming again, her alluring gaze seemingly having the ability to suck any man into it.

“However, I don’t think Zhu Qing would fall in love with you just because you’re bold. What does she see in you? I still can’t believe she’s willing to break away from Dragon Island just to be together with you.”

She was speaking to Yang Kai to stall for time. After her clansmen arrived, Yang Kai would never be able to harm her again no matter how powerful he was. Suddenly, she covered her mouth and giggled, “Could it be that… you’re skilful in bed? So Zhu Qing fell in love with your skills, is it…? Hahaha… She’s indeed an inexperienced girl.”

Yang Kai wasn’t surprised that Fu Ling would say such shameless things; after all, he had seen for himself how promiscuous she could be.

“Who knows?” Yang Kai shrugged and remained in the same spot.

Fu Ling licked her plump and juicy lips, which were as attractive as rubies. Panting slightly, she said, “I heard that Zhu Qing managed to become a Ninth-Order Dragon because of you?”

This wasn’t a secret, at least on Dragon Island. When Zhu Qing returned to Dragon Island some time back, all of them were shocked to learn that she was now a Ninth-Order Dragon.

It was extremely difficult to improve one’s Dragon Vein. Even if a Dragon Clan member continuously consumed Dragon Blood Flowers for more than 10,000 years, they might not be able to break through.

Since Zhu Qing was already an Eighth-Order Dragon, it was especially difficult for her to do so. However, she had managed to achieve that. Although she didn’t reveal the reason behind it, the knowledgeable Elders had figured out the truth.

The Human she had gotten together with had obtained the Ancestral Dragon Source. Hence, after they became one, Zhu Qing must have gotten a lot of benefits, which then led to the breakthrough in her bloodline.

Fu Ling was just a Sixth-Order Dragon, so if she could also bed Yang Kai, she should be able to become Seventh-Order with ease. Perhaps she would even make it to the Eighth-Order.

With this thought in mind, she felt her body growing hot as her heart yearned for that man. Her fair face and long neck also turned a shade redder.

“I’d like to have a try as well.” Her voice became alluring as she panted and tried to show off her hourglass figure.

She didn’t attempt to hide her promiscuity because Yang Kai had seen her having fun with other men in the Dragon Palace some time ago. Therefore, she didn’t have to pretend to be innocent now.

At that time, Yang Kai was taking a peek outside the room. She discovered him at the last moment and obviously remembered his face.

“Sorry, I’m not interested in worn-out shoes.” Yang Kai sneered.

Fu Ling turned cold instantly as her eyes beamed with a glacial glare. Clenching her teeth, she screamed, “Human, you’ll pay the price for your rudeness! After you are captured by the Elders, I will bring you home and make love to you! I hope you’ll have enough stamina because it’s difficult for any man to satisfy me!”

“We’ll talk about it when you have that chance.” Unfazed, Yang Kai changed the topic, “Anyway, I’m curious how you were able to hide without Zhu Lie and me noticing.”
