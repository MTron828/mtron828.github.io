“What a joke!”

“In your dreams!”

“Are you messed up in the head, boy?”

The group of Demon Kings clamoured. Although this guy named Shaman Niu seemed invincible, it was impossible for them to surrender voluntarily, with all of them having no intention of backing down, aside from Sha Ya that is.

Bao Qi stood beside Yang Kai, looking at them coldly and mocking them quietly.

Back then, he was like these Demon Kings. He did not want to submit to Sir Shaman Niu either, but what happened in the end? Sir Shaman Niu did not require his compliance, he simply tore open his Knowledge Sea defences and branded him with his Soul Imprint.

Having learnt the lessons of the past, Bao Qi knew the fate that awaited these guys would probably be the same. No one could resist Sir Shaman Niu in this world. Ever since these former colleagues of his stepped into this world, their fate was sealed.

“You want us to be your slaves just like Bao Qi?” Fei Li’s jaw moved, snickering as he grinned, “Your dreams are quite grand!”

“If you have the ability, just kill us all!” Another Demon King shouted and was soon echoed by all of the Demon King present. Besides Sha Ya, who had other plans, all the other Demon Kings showed an unyielding spirit.

Yang Kai swept his eyes around at the Demon King below as they stared back at him fearlessly.

Nodding gently, he declared, “Since you want to die, I’ll help you.”

As his words fell, he suddenly raised his hand and the face of the Demon King who spoke earlier changed, his body involuntarily levitating up to the sky, as if he was lifted by an invisible hand. No matter how much he struggled, he could not resist it at all.

The other Demon Kings certainly would not sit back and watch, so after exchanging looks, they pushed their Demon Qi and rushed up together.

But before they could do anything, Yang Kai suddenly pressed down with his other hand and a powerful force which seemed to come from all around descended on the Demon Kings. This was the force of an entire World, so restraining the fifteen other Demon Kings on the spot was as easy as snapping one’s fingers, making it so none of them could even move a muscle.

The faces of the Demon Kings changed drastically. Although this Shaman Niu showed his unimaginable powers before, they thought that they might still stand a chance if they all united against him. With so many Demon Kings fighting side-by-side, perhaps even a Demon Saint would be given trouble.

Nevertheless, reality overwhelmed them with terror!

The fifteen Demon Kings were suppressed with just a wave of the enemy’s hand. Moreover, he did not seem to have exerted any strength. Was he really a God? What other explanation could there be?

All of the Demon King’s eyes quivered violently as they turned their eyes to the sky with extreme difficulty.

“Ku Ke!” Fei Li gritted his teeth as he bellowed, “Don’t lower your head!”

The panic in the eyes of the Demon King, Ku Ke, dispersed after hearing Fei Li’s encouragement. He stood firm as he declared in a muffled voice, “I will never bow!”

He raised his head with great effort and looked straight into Yang Kai’s eyes.

Yang Kai tightened the grip of his hand, and a soft noise of a crushed object could be heard. Ku Ke, who had been suspended in mid-air, collapsed, his physique turning into scattered dust as it fell.

Ku Ke was a Stone Demon, so his physique was as tough as the hardest rock in the world. Stone Demons had the greatest defensive ability in the Hundred Clans, and even Shadow Demon Mo Ke Tuo was not sure if she could break through Ku Ke’s defence in one blow.

But such a Demon King was crushed to dust by this Shaman Niu in an instant.

The dust, which was formerly Ku Ke’s flesh and blood, rained down on the ground along with three hearts.

Those were Ku Ke’s Demon Hearts!

As long as the Demon Heart remained, the Demon Clan would never die! Therefore, as long as any of the three Demon Hearts remained, Ku Ke would have a chance to resurrect.

*Pu pu pu…*

In the process of falling, the three Demon Hearts exploded one after another, and the pure Demon Qi spilled out, darkening the surrounding world.

The other Demon Kings’ hearts sank, as chills ran up their spines.

Ku Ke was dead! He died without being able to resist! All three of his Demon Hearts were destroyed as well, so not even the Great Demon God would have the ability to revive him now.

Every Demon King understood that Shaman Niu was giving them a demonstration of authority by making an example of one of them, but that knowledge did not reduce the shock they felt about it. He really killed Ku Ke. They thought that since he wanted them to be his slaves, there would be some room for negotiation; after all, dead people could not be slaves.

Nevertheless, he killed Ku Ke without hesitation, as if it did not matter to him and killing them all meant nothing to him.

“Oh right, I forgot to tell you,” Yang Kai crossed his hands behind his back, swept his eyes across the Demon Kings, and continued calmly, “My ability is limited, and I can only accept ten slaves. After all, your cultivations are higher than mine, so ten is my limit, and I can’t accept any more than that. But you still have fifteen people here, so…” Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Some of you must die!”

This smile was imprinted into the Demon Kings’ eyes, and it was more terrifying to them than the anger of the Demon Saints.

Bao Qi stood beside Yang Kai without saying anything, having no idea whether what Yang Kai said was true or not, but as far as he knew, it should be accurate. After all, the cost of implanting a Soul Imprint into another’s mind wasn’t small, and maintaining these imprints required a certain amount of strength as well. One would not be able to expend their Spiritual Energy and Soul without limit.

The true Realm of Sir Shaman Niu was not too high, so being able to enslave ten Demon Kings was already shocking enough.

Including Sha Ya and himself, that meant there were only eight places left, but there were still fourteen Demon Kings present, excluding Sha Ya. In other words, he had to kill six more.

If Bao Qi could figure out such a simple thing, the other Demon Kings could figure it out too, and for a moment, they became gloomy. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Killing Ku Ke was not only to set an example, but it was also necessary because there were too many people, so it was useless to keep them all! Aware of this, the mentality of some Demon Kings began to change.

Before Yang Kai’s announcement, they were fine with working together, and it was an honour to live and die together, but now that some of them had to die while others could live, self-interest began to creep into these Demon Kings’ mentality and a faint hostility suddenly broke out into the atmosphere.

Yang Kai pressed on, “Let me tell you, even if you don’t want to surrender to me, I can still turn you into my slaves; however, I prefer someone who takes the initiative. After all, forcefully picked melons are not sweet!”

Fei Li bellowed, “Don’t listen to his nonsense! He’s lying! As long as we insist, he will have no way but to kill us! As a Demon King, I’d rather die than surrender!”

After his shout, many of the Demon Kings had their courage renewed.

It was a great shame to be a slave to the foreign race, and it was even worse given that this foreigner had lower cultivation than them.

Yang Kai smiled and did not stop Fei Li from befogging others’ minds. He just waited for him to finish, then looked down at a red-eyed Demon King, “I’ll give you ten breaths of time to consider whether you want to live or die.”

The Demon King showed a defiant expression on his face and sneered at Yang Kai’s request. His strength was restrained in his body and could not put up any real resistance, so he just spat at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai continued, “Don’t play the victim here. You all set foot onto this land for no reason, burned, looted, and killed my Barbarian Race. You are the invaders!”

The Demon King snorted, “Then kill me. This King has killed many foreigners anyway. It is not shameful to die here!”

“As you wish!” Yang Kai stretched out his hand and tapped on this Demon King’s forehead. With a soft pop, a hole was pierced into the Demon King’s head, followed by a few explosions in his body. His Demon Hearts were shattered, and his body fell down limply, the brilliance in his eyes disappearing in an instant.

“I will continue to ask and I will kill until I have enough, then it’s congratulations to the rest. Some of you will be lucky to be my slaves!” Yang Kai remarked with an indifferent tone. Compared with the helpless Demon Kings, it seemed like he was the real Demon King, and those who stood in front of him were the weak lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

“You’d best pray that all the people I ask refuse me. In that case, the remaining will have a way to live.”

He walked step by step and soon came to Sha Ya, and asked faintly, “Live or die?”

Sha Ya’s face was pale, as if the death of the previous two Demon Kings had given her a great impact. She looked so panicked that she failed to answer Yang Kai’s questions in the first place.

Fei Li saw this and bellowed, “Sha Ya, we will accompany you soon. Death is just a return to the Great Demon God’s embrace. There is nothing to be scared of here!”

Sha Ya stammered, “Fei Li, it’s easy for you to talk! The person being asked is me, not you. Death is indeed nothing, but dying in such an ugly way would bring shame to our Demon Clan…”

“You…” Fei Li was taken aback and looked at Sha Ya coldly, “Don’t tell me you really want to…”

“You have three breaths of time to decide!” Yang Kai slowly raised a finger and pointed at Sha Ya.

Sha Ya immediately half-knelt on the ground, and bowed her head, “Sha Ya is willing to submit her loyalty to Sir Shaman Niu.”

The faces of all the Demon Kings changed, the majority of them were glaring at Sha Ya with contempt and anger. They were ashamed to call her a Demon King like them! However, a few secretly felt some empathy with Sha Ya.

There were always those who embraced death courageously, but there were still others who were cowards and feared death. Although these Demon Kings were strong, they still belonged to this reality.

“Very good!” Yang Kai revealed a smile and put his hand on Sha Ya’s head, continuing their act. Sha Ya looked up again, and replied with pleasant surprise, “Many thanks, Sir!”

As she spoke, she stood up and walked a few steps over to Bao Qi.

Bao Qi glanced at her and gave her a look of approval.

To be honest, if he had not known Sha Ya’s true status, he too would have been cheated by her.

“I should have killed you earlier!” Fei Li ground his teeth and bellowed. He would have rather had Sha Ya die by his hand than become a slave to this foreigner. This was truly a disgrace to the Demon Clan.

Yang Kai turned around with a solemn look, and shouted loudly, “I’ll ask you one last time. Do you want to live… or die!?”
