Yang Kai was startled upon hearing that. It was the first time he heard someone describe World Force as ‘fresh’. World Force was the foundation of an Open Heaven Realm Master’s power, not a living creature. Was there such a thing as stale World Force, then?

Feeling puzzled, he asked, “What do you mean by fresh World Force?”

Liu Zi An replied with a smile, “Have you heard of the World Sphere before, Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Yes.”

Liu Zi An explained, “Strictly speaking, World Spheres are a kind of artifact invented by the Black Ink Clan. It’s used to absorb the World Force that leaks out after Open Heaven Realm Masters are killed on the battlefield. World Spheres are sold in every Black Ink Clan’s territory, and they’re quite expensive. By buying a World Sphere, a Black Ink Clansmen can consume the World Force inside it to cultivate. The World Force in Sealed Worlds could be consumed by the Black Ink Clan as well; however, that kind of World Force is like a tree without roots or a river without a source. It’s dead. To the Black Ink Clan, this kind of World Force is not fresh enough. It’s like stale food for Humans.”

He paused for a moment and went on to say, “On the other hand, Open Heaven Realm Masters like us have very fresh World Force in our Small Universes. Sir Gui Liao is pretty picky, so he prefers to consume this kind of World Force.”

Then, he looked fervently at Yang Kai, “So, it’s easy for you to gain Sir Gui Liao’s favour. You just have to open your Small Universe and let him consume your World Force to his heart’s content. After that, he’ll grant your wish.”

Yang Kai lowered his gaze and said impassively, “Is this how you please Sir Gui Liao?”

Liu Zi An directly nodded, “Yes. However, according to Sir Gui Liao, the World Force of every Open Heaven Realm Master tastes different. This Liu has been Sir Gui Liao’s servant for a long time. In the past, he loved to consume my World Force, but he hasn’t done so for a long time now. I suppose he’s already sick of it. Since you’re a newcomer, you can let Sir Gui Liao have a taste of a different kind of World Force. He said that the more powerful a Human is, the more delicious his World Force will be, and you’re a powerful cultivator. If you’re willing to do this, I’m sure Sir Gui Liao will see you in a different light. It’ll be much easier for you to get things done as well.”

“Is this the condition?” Yang Kai lifted his head and asked.

Liu Zi An shook his head, “It’s not a condition. It’s just my suggestion. Brother Yang, a wise man will adapt to the circumstances. This is the Black Ink Clan’s territory, and we’re Black Ink Disciples.”

“I’m Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple, not Gui Liao’s.”

Liu Zi An’s expression changed, “Stop being obstinate, Brother Yang! You’ll only lose a bit of your World Force. If you can get a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit, you’ll be able to repair the damaged part of your Small Universe. By then, you can slowly cultivate and make up for the losses.”

Yang Kai shot him a piercing glance, “Before Sir Territory Lord entered the Black Ink Nest, he ordered Gui Liao to get me a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit. Is he going to disobey Sir Territory Lord?”

Liu Zi An chuckled, “No one has the guts to disobey Sir Territory Lord’s orders. In fact, Sir Gui Liao has left the place to look for a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit for you; however, I’m sure you know that it’s a very rare item. As for when he’ll find it, or whether he’ll be able to find it at all, that is up to the Heavens.”

[Up to the Heavens?] Yang Kai secretly cursed. It was apparent that Gui Liao wanted to force him to make a concession in such a way. He had never expected that Gui Liao had a hobby of consuming fresh World Force from Humans.

Even though the one whose World Force was getting absorbed would suffer some losses, they would be fine as long as not too much of their World Force was sucked and their foundation was undamaged. The lost World Force could be replenished easily enough.

However, there was no way Yang Kai would agree to such a demand.

Previously, he gave up a part of his Small Universe twice on the battlefield because he had no other choice. Additionally, he was doing that to fool the Black Ink Clansmen so that they wouldn’t examine his Small Universe.

Liu Zi An leaned against the seat and said calmly, “Why don’t you go back and sleep on it? Everything I’ve said to you is sincere.”

“There’s no need to sleep on it,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Liu Zi An stared fixedly at him, “You mean…”

Yang Kai snorted, “This Yang is Sir Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple, not Gui Liao’s. Regardless of what Sir Territory Lord tells me to do, I’ll not hesitate to do it for him. As for Gui Liao’s ridiculous demand, I’ll tell Sir Territory Lord about it when he comes out of the Black Ink Nest.”

Liu Zi An’s expression changed drastically as he landed a slap on the table, “Don’t go too far, you little bastard! It’ll take Sir Territory Lord several years to recuperate. During this period of time, you’ll have to work for Sir Gui Liao.”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai shot him a glance, “Is he going to kill me?”

“You’re just a Black Ink Disciple. If you make a mistake, why wouldn’t Sir Gui Liao kill you?” Liu Zi An appeared ferocious.

Yang Kai sneered, “Let’s see if he has the guts to do so!”

Liu Zi An fell into a dazed state. After staring at him for a long time, he shook his head, “You’re insane! Insane!”

He couldn’t sense any respect for Gui Liao from Yang Kai, which was inconceivable. As a Black Ink Disciple, how did Yang Kai have the guts to dismiss a Feudal Lord like Gui Liao? It seemed that he didn’t know his place.

Was he confident because he was the Territory Lord’s Black Ink Disciple? Liu Zi An couldn’t help but feel bitter.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai extended his hand, “Give them back.”

“What?” Liu Zi An was startled.

“The Open Heaven Pills I gave you the other day,” Yang Kai pulled a long face.

Initially, even though Liu Zi An was deplorable, Yang Kai didn’t intend to be on bad terms with him; after all, he was new to this place, so he didn’t want to complicate things. However, what had happened totally disappointed him.

Gui Liao wanted to consume his World Force, and he even told Liu Zi An to con him into accepting.

Yang Kai would never agree to such a demand; however, he needed a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit to cover up the secrets in his Small Universe. After taking everything into consideration, he decided to make a huge fuss so that Gui Liao had to take notice.

In this castle, Liu Zi An was the best breakthrough he could make use of to achieve his goal.

Liu Zi An couldn’t believe his ears. A person must be extremely thick-skinned to have the nerve to take back what he had given out.

Honestly speaking, several hundred thousand Open Heaven Pills didn’t matter to Liu Zi An; however, he could never give them back to Yang Kai given the latter’s attitude. If he really did so, it would be the same as admitting he was afraid of Yang Kai.

After a moment of silence, Liu Zi An sneered, “What Open Heaven Pills? I’ve consumed them all.”

Yang Kai balled up his fists as cracking sounds were heard. His aura was rising rapidly, “Since you’ve consumed my Open Heaven Pills, I just have to make you spit them back out!”

He couldn’t help but have the urge to laugh.

Previously, he had suggested giving Yang Kai a lesson in front of Gui Liao. At that time, he was just displeased with the different treatments he and Yang Kai received. This brat surnamed Yang could immediately get a Profound Yin Spirit Fruit upon arrival while it wasn’t until 300 years after he became a Black Ink Disciple that he got the fruit. Moreover, he only obtained it because he had made many contributions.

Nevertheless, Gui Liao told him not to complicate things, so he cast the idea aside.

Now that he was provoked by Yang Kai though, he could seize the chance to teach him a lesson. Certainly, he wouldn’t dare to disobey Gui Liao’s order; however, there was nothing to worry about now since it was Yang Kai who made the first move. This way, he could explain himself to Gui Liao.

When Zha Gu reported to Gui Liao about the battle that Yang Kai had taken part in, Liu Zi An, who was hiding in the darkness, could hear it clearly as well. He knew that this new Black Ink Disciple that the Territory Lord had taken on was powerful as Yang Kai was able to lead a Squad to kill several thousand Black Ink Clansmen, including more than 10 Feudal Lords.

Liu Zi An didn’t think he was capable of doing that.

However, that was what Yang Kai could achieve when he was at his peak.

During that battle, Yang Kai sacrificed pieces of his Small Universe twice. Now, his Small Universe was incomplete, and his foundation had been damaged. There was no doubt that his power had plunged.

In that case, why would Liu Zi An need to fear him?

He was instantly infuriated by Yang Kai’s provocation and his Seventh-Order aura flared sharply. His entire figure was engulfed in a dark fog as he pushed his power, his figure seemingly expanding as well. The sarcoma on his neck throbbed against his skin like a beating heart.

He slowly rose from the chair and looked condescendingly at Yang Kai. With a grin, he snickered, “Brat, do you know the consequences of provoking me?”

Even though he appeared to be giving Yang Kai a warning, he was actually eager to see him make a move.

Yang Kai scoffed, “Anyone ever tell you, you talk too much?”

Upon finishing his words, he threw out his fist.

Liu Zi An almost had the urge to cheer for Yang Kai. He had never expected this person surnamed Yang to be so impetuous that he would make a move on a whim. It was unlike how polite Yang Kai had appeared to be up until now.

This was exactly the outcome Liu Zi An wanted.

The moment he saw Yang Kai making a move, he also pushed out his fist without hesitation. He was a burly man, so his fist was also significantly larger than that of Yang Kai.

When their fists came into contact, it was as though two Universe Worlds had clashed. As the World Force surged, Liu Zi An abruptly stopped appearing haughty as his huge figure was sent flying away like an arrow. He directly crashed into a wall and formed a pit in the ground.

On the other hand, Yang Kai was forced to back several steps before he managed to stabilise himself.

His surging aura made his clothes flap in the wind.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai stepped forward. He wasn’t used to the condition he was in.

If he were still at the peak of his power, he could’ve severely wounded someone like Liu Zi An with one punch and killed him in three.

However, his strength really had plunged as a result of the damage to his Small Universe, leaving him far weaker than before.

Fortunately, his opponent was Liu Zi An.

Even though Liu Zi An was also a Seventh-Order Master, he reached this Order by using the Black Ink Strength to break through his natural limit, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Liu Zi An’s foundation was unstable, so he was unable to fully utilise the power of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm.
