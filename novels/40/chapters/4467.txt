Yin Xin Zhao quickly asked, “What explanation are you looking for, Heavenly Monarch?”

Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch, Huang Quan, smiled without saying anything.

*Pu…*

A soft sound rang out suddenly, mixed with a muffled grunt. Hui Gu spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground weakly without warning. A huge gaping hole appeared in his abdomen. Standing in front of him, one could clearly see the scenery on the other side through the hole in his body.

In the sky, Jin Gang slowly retracted his bloody fist.

“You…” Hui Gu lifted his head to look at Jin Gang with horror in his eyes.

Many of the Prison League’s Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were in an uproar and turned to look at Firm Gold Heavenly Monarch in confusion. They did not understand why the Vice League Master attacked one of their own out of the blue, much less severely injuring Hui Gu in a single attack.

“This is the consequence of colluding with the enemy and bringing harm to our comrades!” Jin Gang coldly snorted, “Hui Gu, you’re doomed. Nobody can save you today.”

Hui Gu clutched at his chest and tried to circulate his strength to stabilize his wounds. His complexion was pale and he said nothing.

A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Protector who generally had a good relationship with Hui Gu asked in a deep voice, “Vice League Master, what is the meaning of this?”

The sudden attack on Hui Gu made him very uneasy; after all, he too was one of the Prison League’s Protectors. If he did not get to the bottom of this matter, something like this might even befall him in the future.

Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch smiled and answered the question, “Don’t panic. His actions are in line with this Monarch’s intentions. Hui Gu is a despicable and cunning man. He is a secret chess piece that these participants inserted into the Prison League!”

A blanket of silence fell over the scene. All the Protectors looked at Hui Gu in disbelief. The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Protector who spoke up earlier also looked absolutely shocked.

Hui Gu gritted his teeth, “What do you mean, League Master? This Hui does not understand.” [I cannot admit to anything here, or else I will really be killed.]

Huang Quan smiled, “At first, this Monarch was only slightly suspicious and could not be certain; after all, there were traces of your interference every time a patrol was dispatched. You might have concealed your tracks well, but there are no walls that are truly airtight. If this Monarch failed to notice something as simple as this, then this Monarch would not be worthy of being Prison League’s League Master.

“Nevertheless, it was not until Wu Nian died and you escaped alone that this Monarch truly became suspicious. In order to verify my conjecture, this Monarch tested you again and again.” At this point of his speech, his expression fell. He pointed at the severed limbs and scattered corpses around him, “Apart from this Monarch and the two Vice League Masters, you were the only other person who knew the whereabouts of the patrol that was dispatched today. Even so, they were intercepted at this spot within an hour of being sent out. If you weren’t the one to tip off the enemy, then who else could it be!?”

Hui Gu shook his head, “League Master, please understand! I have no knowledge of this matter!”

Jin Gang smiled deviously, “If it was not you, then are you implying that it was me or Cang Yan? Hui Gu, oh, Hui Gu… You truly disappoint me. What benefits did these participants promise you to make you turn your back on your old friends of countless years?”

Nearby, Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan exchanged a glance with each other. They initially thought that Yang Kai had sold them out, but based on the current situation, it would seem that the people from the Prison League had figured out Hui Gu’s identity and used their plan against them. Be that as it may, the current situation was very worrying. They couldn’t help being racked by anxiety.

Hui Gu looked sorrowful as he slowly sneered, “One never lacks a reason to make false accusations!”

“How dare you quibble with me!?” Huang Quan’s expression turned frosty, “I initially thought that this would be a chance for you to redeem yourself for your crimes, but it would now seem that you’re determined to make enemies of the Prison League! In that case, I will let you die with full understanding!” He shouted with a wave of his hand, “Bring him!”

Somebody immediately walked out from the side with a bloody figure in his grip. When Hui Gu looked in that direction, his eyes immediately widened in shock and he blurted out, “Bai Mo!”

The bloody figure turned out to be his one and only subordinate whom he sent out on errands previously, Bai Mo.

At this moment, it was difficult to tell whether or not Bai Mo was even still alive. He was dishevelled and filthy and it was easy to see that he had been greatly tormented. Strange tendrils of energy weaved in and out of his body like Spirit Snakes and his vitality was extremely dim.

Ever since the day Bai Mo was sent on that initial errand, three other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had received the message and brought their subordinates with them to the dense forest tree cave and became Yang Kai’s achievement.

Afterward, the Prison League was formed and Yang Kai finally came out of hiding when he ran out of fish to bait.

During this time, Hui Gu had tried to ask around for information on Bai Mo, but his efforts had been fruitless. Only now did he learn that Bai Mo had fallen into the Huang Quan’s hands at some point.

Seeming to hear Hui Gu’s voice, the dying Bai Mo flinched. He raised his lowered head, revealing a face that was so swollen that he looked like he had been soaked in water for several years. It was a mess of rotten meat and turbid blood. A small gap suddenly opened in his swollen eyelids. Carefully looking in Hui Gu’s direction for a while, he cried out in a miserable voice, “Master, Bai Mo is sorry!”

“What else do you have to say for yourself?” Huang Quan stared at Hui Gu coldly.

Hui Gu’s complexion was ashen. He knew that it was useless to try and talk his way out of this. Bai Mo was only in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm after all. It was a pity that he fell into the hands of somebody like Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch. It was only natural that Huang Quan had ways to make him divulge the truth no matter how loyal he was.

“It looks like you have nothing more to say.” Huang Quan coldly snorted and exerted some strength into his hand. Bai Mo exploded into a cloud of blood mist, leaving nothing behind!

The reason why Huang Quan went to so much trouble to prove that Hui Gu was colluding with the enemy was to pacify and reassure the other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Protectors; otherwise, a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Protector could not be killed so easily.

Hui Gu’s eyes immediately widened at the sight. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After dealing with Hui Gu, Huang Quan finally turned to look at Yin Xin Zhao and the others, “Little friends, where are you from?”

Yin Xin Zhao gloomily said, “Xuan Yuan Cave Heaven!”

“And, you must be a Myriad Demons Heaven disciple.” Huang Quan turned to look at Pei Wen Xuan with a smile.

The people from Myriad Demons Heaven were the easiest to recognise; after all, the unique characteristics of Demon Qi were too obvious to miss. It was like walking around with a glaring billboard wherever they went.

“What about you?” He looked towards Yang Kai.

“Void Land!” Yang Kai replied flippantly; however, his mind was focused on Hui Gu’s situation as he seemed to be in an abnormal state after Bai Mo was killed right in front of him.

Huang Quan frowned, “Perhaps I’ve become a bit ignorant and uninformed after all the years. I’m afraid I didn’t know about the existence of a Void Paradise.”

“It’s Void Land!” Yang Kai reiterated.

Huang Quan seemed to understand something and nodded lightly, “So, that’s how it is.”

He was secretly confused. [Didn’t they say that the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters participating in the Dao Theory Assembly are all newly-advanced Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Cave-Heavens and Paradises? Why is this person from Void Land here?]

Too lazy to think too much into this matter, he gave a light wave of his hand and spat out a single but extremely chilling word, “Kill!”

Hui Gu, who had reached some kind of critical limit, suddenly attacked at the same time. Charging directly at the Huang Quan, he let out a ferocious roar, “Huang Quan, suffer death!”

Huang Quan looked over coldly but did not move.

Jin Gang and Cang Ya attacked Hui Gu from both sides and sent him flying backward with just a single move. Hui Gu coughed up a mouthful of blood and stumbled weakly. He had been heavily injured by the Jin Gang earlier, so he was no match for the two Vice League Masters at the moment.

In the meantime, the World Force in the surroundings fluctuated chaotically as the power of various Secret Techniques and artifacts loomed over Yang Kai and the others.

Yang Kai, Yin Xin Zhao, and Pei Wen Xuan roared furiously. They knew that they were in an extremely precarious situation; thus, they did not dare to hesitate and quickly used various means to defend against the barrage of attacks.

*Hong hong hong…*

...

Following a series of explosions, the three of them were shaken badly and their respective Small Universes were in turmoil. The difference in numbers was simply too great, so the outcome of this battle was determined before it even began.

[This place is too dangerous. I can’t stay here for long.] Yang Kai made a feint and retreated backward, leaving Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan to fight against the many Open Heaven Realm Masters from Prison League on their own, with a flicker, he rushed towards Hui Gu.

He was fast, but surprisingly somebody else was even faster than him.

Mo Sheng, the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who had been following behind Pei Wen Xuan all this time, had already arrived next to Hui Gu at some point, grabbed his arm, and dragged the latter towards Yang Kai with all speed. The attacks from Jin Gang and Cang Ya that came from behind him caused him to cough up blood and his Demon Qi to churn violently.

“Go!” Mo Sheng roared at Yang Kai who was rushing towards him.

Yang Kai was dumbstruck, but still surged his Space Principles to wrap up Mo Sheng and Hui Gu, preparing to escape this place.

Jin Gang was following closely behind and his expression turned grim at the sight, “Hm? A Space Secret Technique? Don’t even think about escaping!”

Taking a deep breath, he let out a deep roar. An invisible sound wave spread out into the surroundings, causing the local space to shatter like a broken mirror.

The figures of Yang Kai and the others that had been fading away abruptly solidified once more. His Instantaneous Movement had been interrupted.

Cang Ya and Huang Quan quickly swooped in from both sides when they saw this complication. The World Forces of the two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, like two separate Worlds, were barrelling in this direction.

“Break!” Yang Kai raised his hand and summoned the Azure Dragon Spear. As soon as the spear thrust out, a Golden Dragon Head flashed behind him and a Dragon Roar shook the skies. The Azure Dragon Spear in his hands suddenly transformed into a 1,500 metre long Great Dragon that shook its head and flicked its tail as it charged forward recklessly.

...

A gap suddenly appeared in the oppressive auras of the two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Yang Kai activated Space Principles once more and fled through the gap with a flash as the sounds of explosions and attacks rang out endlessly from behind him. In addition, the rampaging World Force threatened to shatter the Void once more.

By the time Jin Gang broke through the explosions and rushed over, Yang Kai along with Hui Gu and Mo Sheng were nowhere to be seen.

“Space Secret Techniques!” Huang Quan scowled deeply and spread out his Divine Sense into the surroundings; however, Yang Kai was long gone without a trace.

“He sure escaped quickly!” Likewise, Jin Gang looked furious. He had interrupted Yang Kai’s Space Secret Technique as soon as he noticed that something was not right, but unfortunately, his efforts were in vain. It was said that people who were proficient in the Dao of Space were unparalleled when it came to escaping, and judging from the current situation, those rumours were not unfounded.

“We were too careless!” Cang Ya sighed. If they had known that there was somebody proficient in the Dao of Space, they would have created a Heaven Sealing Earth Locking Array or Formation at the beginning so that the other party could not escape.

“It’s fine.” Huang Quan slowly shook his head, “It’s not like we don’t have any gains.”

He looked back at the battlefield where three disciples from two Cave-Heavens were trapped. Although two of them were in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, they were both newly-promoted, so their heritage was a far cry compared to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Prison League. Moreover, there was a huge disparity in numbers, so it was only a matter of time before those three died.

On the battlefield, both Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan were red with rage. Their figures swayed unsteadily, seeming to be at risk of dying at any moment. As Core Disciples of Cave-Heavens, they had various items in their possession to protect themselves; nevertheless, the continuous use of these items was merely a futile dying struggle that delayed the time of their deaths.
