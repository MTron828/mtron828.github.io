“Tell me, tell me!” Fu Shu said anxiously.

There weren’t any Masters left among his subordinates, or any subordinates at all for that matter as they were all sprawled down on the ground, so Fu Shu could only pin his hopes on the goateed man.

The goateed man continued, “With the blessings of the Sacred Tree, First Imperial Prince will definitely not be injured, so since you won’t get injured, why fear him? You are an Imperial Prince, after all. You can command the power of the Sacred Tree, so even if you can’t beat him, couldn’t you have just grabbed her and ran? As long as you return to the imperial palace, what can he do to you?”

Fu Shu’s eyes lit up when he heard this and inwardly cursed himself for losing his mind from fear. Just as the old goateed man said, he had the protection of the Sacred Tree, so normal people couldn’t hurt him. Since he couldn’t be hurt, what was there for him to be afraid of?

He could only be bitter at himself for being so scared that he did not think about such a thing, and bitter at Yang Kai even more for humiliating him. Eyes turning to Zhu Qing, who was standing at the side, his courage was reinvigorated and he slowly stood up from the corner.

Even though his body was shaking a little, it was much better than how he was begging for mercy and trying to flee just now.

Their conflict earlier also attracted many of Human Imperial City’s residents to watch, so the teahouse was now surrounded by onlookers in all directions. When several groups of patrolling guards around the area broke through the crowd after hearing news about the situation and seeing the mess here, they were astonished.

Once they saw Fu Shu, they all saluted and asked about the situation.

“You came just in time!” The presence of the Imperial Guard gave Fu Shu even more confidence. He pointed at Yang Kai and declared, “This vicious man hurt my guards and humiliated this Prince! Quickly subdue that man for this Prince!”

When the guards heard this, they all answered his command.

A cold smile appeared on Fu Shu’s face and an incantation suddenly spilled from his lips, which sounded obscure and difficult to understand. The onlookers were confused, but Yang Kai was the most shocked of them all.

He was much too familiar with this incantation. When the words sounded, his mind involuntarily recalled a magnificent scene of war. During that time, with tens of thousands of warriors under his command, he had launched a long and bloody campaign against the Demon Race, and each time battle was joined, Shamans would chant such spells.

The chanting of the spell made one’s blood boil and filled one’s chest with killing intent, making it so that they would want for nothing more than to destroy everything before their eyes.

Fu Shu’s incantation was very short and seemed to vary a little from the one Yang Kai knew, but it was essentially the same.

A light suddenly bloomed and enveloped the guards.

In the next instant, the vitality of the guards all surged and their bodies bulged violently, as if they were inflated with hot air. Their exposed skin began to glow red, and even their eyes had turned crimson.

Cowardice and fear disappeared from their bodies, replaced by ferocity and killing intent.

“Bloodlust Spell!” Yang Kai’s eyes almost popped out of his head. He never expected to see someone else perform the Bloodlust Spell today after a lapse of more than ten thousand years.

Despite the fact that this Bloodlust Spell was slightly different from the one he knew, Yang Kai definitely wouldn’t mistake it for something else.

There were some traces of Shamanic Spells when Liao Guan Shi performed his technique back in the cave, but it wasn’t too obvious, so Yang Kai didn’t pay it too much attention. But now, it seemed that Shamanic Spells still existed in this Revolving World. Yang Kai had no idea how they managed to pass it down for so long.

Zhu Qing clearly did not expect to see this either and she looked curiously at the cultivators who suddenly changed, feeling puzzled.

When Fu Shu’s chanting began again, Yang Kai immediately figured out what sort of Shamanic Spell it was. This Shamanic Spell was the biggest headache for the Demon Race back in ancient times, and it was also a Shamanic Spell that could not be broken easily.

It was only with the protection of this Shamanic Spell that the Ancient Barbarian Race was able to compete with the Demon Race.

Yang Kai knew deeply how terrifying this Shamanic Spell was, so how could he let Fu Shu cast it?

Taking a step forward, the Myriads Sword disappeared in the blink of an eye, and with a wide sweep of his arm, Yang Kai sent a huge Moon Blade flying towards Fu Shu.

This attack was so sudden and unpredictable that it shocked the goateed man. Naturally, it scared Fu Shu as well; however, the ignorant were fearless, and remembering what the goateed man told him just now, Fu Shu showed no intention to dodge or resist despite his fear, continuing his chanting, becoming louder and louder.

The enormous Moon Blade struck Fu Shu’s body as expected, but it was blocked by the green light that appeared on the surface of his body just as before. Only this time, the green light was particularly dense, so bright that it was almost solid. This green light was a protective barrier, and always responded proportionally to the threat it was facing, which in a sense highlighted just how deadly Yang Kai’s Moon Blade was.

This Divine Ability that could sever space itself was unable to do anything to Fu Shu. The green light was actually able to block the Moon Blade’s attack once more, but a small crack appeared where it met with the black blade, one so small it was almost imperceptible.

Seeing this, Yang Kai suddenly realized that this protection was neither invincible nor unbreakable. The reason why his previous attacks were ineffective was simply that they were not strong enough.

With that momentary delay, Fu Shu had already completed his Shamanic Spell.

Another light burst out, enveloping the guards.

Suddenly, there seemed to be something linking these people together, making them share life and death. All their vitalities came together in one place and rose to the sky.

Zhu Qing frowned slightly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Life Chains!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth. He never imagined that he would one day face off against the two Shamanic Spells of the Two Race Great War, Bloodlust Spell and Life Chains. The great Shamans of the Ancient Barbarian Race that Yang Kai fought alongside in the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld relied on the help of these two Shamanic Spells to become invincible, and it was because of that reason that Yang Kai knew the power of these spells better than anyone else alive today.

The goateed man looked surprised, “You actually know about the Sacred Techniques?”

“What Sacred Technique?” Yang Kai took a few steps back to stand next to Zhu Qing, staring coldly ahead.

The group of guards who were blessed with the Bloodlust Spell and Life Chains numbered about thirty people, all of whom had cultivations just under the Emperor Realm. The strongest was a Third-Order Dao Source cultivator, while the weakest was merely a Second-Order Origin King. If this group of people fought against Yang Kai alone, or even just as an ordinary group, Yang Kai could have easily exterminated them with a wave of his hand.

But right now, this group had the ability to fight against an Emperor in a life or death battle.

The fame of Shamanic Spells in the war did not come from nowhere.

The goateed man continued, “They are Secret Techniques that only the Imperial Family with more than six leaves are able to perform. If you don’t know about the Sacred Techniques, then how do you know the names of these skills?”

Yang Kai did not answer him and instead whispered to Zhu Qing, “We’re in a bit of trouble now.”

Zhu Qing commented, “I’ll deal with these people. I’ll leave that Imperial Prince to you.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “They’re not pushovers. Let me deal with them instead.”

Zhu Qing remained unperturbed, “Don’t underestimate me, will you? Besides, I don’t want to even get close to that nasty guy.”

“Since you’ve already said so, I don’t have much of a choice.” Yang Kai shrugged.

Zhu Qing snorted, “If you can’t handle him, then don’t even think about touching me again in the future.”

As soon as she said that, her body lunged forward in a flash.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, “Does she have to be so ruthless all the time?”

The goateed man poured cold water over him at the side, “It’s useless. Since the Sacred Techniques have already been cast, you have no chance to win. That is unless you can break the Sacred Techniques, but you would have to obtain the Sacred Tree’s blessing to do that.”

Fu Shu fumed, “Whose side are you on, old man?”

The goateed man said indifferently, “This Old Master is just here to watch a good show, he stands on neither side. First Imperial Prince should focus on his enemy. Be careful not to throw the face of the imperial family.”

Fu Shu was stirred up by his words, “Then open your dog eyes wide and watch!”

While they were talking, Zhu Qing had already engaged the thirty or so guards in battle. As the violent energy overflowed, the small teahouse collapsed at once, causing the teahouse’s owner to run out to the streets, crying and cursing incessantly.

Very soon, Zhu Qing discovered the difficulty in dealing with this group of people. Their actions couldn’t be called swift, nor were they very well coordinated. They didn’t have polished formations to take advantage of and would often interfere with one another, appearing quite clumsy.

But still, each one of these thirty or so people was actually able to withstand her attacks.

Each of the blows from Zhu Qing’s fists was actually caught by these stray cats and dogs, which was simply unbelievable. She was a member of the Dragon Clan and had ferocious power. Even a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master would not dare to say that they could withstand a hit from her unharmed, and yet these fodder were able to do just that.

After a few strikes though, Zhu Qing quickly discovered the secret behind how they were able to withstand her attacks.

She had no idea what happened with these people, but regardless of who came up to stop her, the damage from her attack would actually split up between their whole group, allowing the thirty or so to bear the effects together.

A single chopstick could easily be broken, but the resistance more than doubled when two chopsticks were used. Not to mention the fact that some other Sacred Technique or whatever was cast on more than thirty people, causing their vitality to surge, turning them fearless against pain or danger. All of them were red-eyed, and their ability to withstand punishment was multiplied.

Zhu Qing’s face turned cold and her attacks became fiercer and fiercer. Just now, she had been holding back quite a bit to test the waters.

As their fight rumbled on, the battlefield was constantly shifting and soon, half the street was affected.

Over where the teahouse used to stand, Yang Kai gazed at Fu Shu and commented, “You heard what the madam said. For the sake of this Young Master’s future happiness, I must ask First Imperial Prince to please… fall!”

As soon as he said that, he appeared before Fu Shu, so close that they were almost stuck together.

The goateed man’s eyes shrunk as his pupils became as small as a pinhole.

He did not see clearly what happened in that instant.

Fu Shu let out a yelp and almost fell backwards, but he was very quickly able to calm his heart and gritted his teeth while shouting, “You think this Prince is afraid of you!?”

Yang Kai raised a hand and threw a fierce punch at his face.

Fu Shu did not react to it at all, however, and the fist smashed in front of him, but fortunately, the green light appeared to block the blow and did not allow any harm to come to him. Otherwise, he would have died on the spot.

His face paled, but he grit his teeth and began chanting.

He wanted to apply a Bloodlust Spell to himself too, that way, he would no longer have any fear.

Yang Kai suddenly gazed at his chest, “First imperial Prince has eight leaves, huh? Tsk tsk, even the Third Imperial Prince has nine leaves, so why do you, as the Elder Brother, have one less than him? Is the Human Sovereign favouring him, or are you just unlovable?”

Fu Shu’s chanting came to an abrupt end as he shouted angrily, “Don’t talk nonsense! How could Imperial Father be partial towards Third Brother? I’m the First imperial Prince!”
