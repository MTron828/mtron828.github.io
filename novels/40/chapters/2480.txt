The violent power rolled over, and Yang Kai, the first to be affected, was swamped in it all of a sudden.

*Hong long long… *

The Nine Heavens Ice Fire rioted for a time before it gradually dissipated and dispersed.

Wu Meng Chuan stood his ground, staring ahead, dignified.

When the dust settled, Yang Kai stood in the void, his clothes tattered. Although he was dishevelled, he was still very much alive and now wore a sombre expression as he formed a set of profound hand seals.

A mysterious aura permeated the air around him.

Wu Meng Chuan suddenly felt extremely uneasy. His heart jumped, and for some reason, he had a feeling that time around him was slowing down, like his own perception was suppressed and everything around him was growing stagnant. Only Yang Kai’s movements remained as fast as lightning.

Yang Kai quickly finished his set of complex hand seals and pushed his palms forward, growling in a low voice, “Time Flies!”

Wu Meng Chuan was appalled, instinctively aware of the dangers of the incoming attack; but he could not avoid it at all, even his thoughts seemed to be frozen at this moment.

Even the Heaven Devouring Battle Law failed to be of any help.

A strange seal quickly shot towards Wu Meng Chuan.

At the critical moment, Wu Meng Chuan bit the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of Blood Essence, flipping his wrist and summoning a blood-red bottle. This bottle was not big, only about a forearm’s length, but it exuded a very rich bloody aura.

Suddenly, a scarlet light as strong and thick as a physical substance was emitted from the bottle. The air was filled with a pungent blood stench that turned into a bright red light that shrouded anything in front of it.

The void was swiftly filled with what seemed to be a sea of blood.

*Hong hong hong… *

The Time Flies Seal crashed into the Blood Sea, setting off a huge shockwave. The Blood Sea rolled and tumbled, and Wu Meng Chuan groaned once more, stumbling as he was forced to retreat.

Although he summoned this peculiar artifact in time, his face still began rapidly ageing as he was still affected by the Divine Ability of the Flowing Time Great Emperor. It seemed that he was quite badly injured at this moment, but his expression remained calm contrary to his previous panic.

He snarled at Yang Kai in a low voice, “I didn’t expect you to have such a Divine Ability!”

Yang Kai looked around with a frown.

It had only been a span of three breaths since Wu Meng Chuan summoned the blood-red bottle, but the surrounding environment had changed drastically.

The surrounding area was filled with a strong smell of blood arising from the bubbling Blood Sea below that vaguely emitted faint cries and howls.

The surrounding space seemed to be isolated by the Blood Sea, and even though Yang Kai was proficient in the Dao of Space, he could not sense any connection with the area outside of the Blood Sea. It seemed that this place was converted into an isolated space, similar to the Sealed World Bead, completely cut off from the outside.

[What the hell is that?] Yang Kai was puzzled, the only thing he was certain of was that the blood-red bottle was a powerful Emperor Artifact!

It was very likely that it was an Emperor Artifact passed down from Heaven Devouring Great Emperor; after all, Wu Meng Chuan was not an Emperor yet, so it was next to impossible for him to request someone else to refine an Emperor Artifact for him.

Yang Kai frowned deeply. If this was really an Emperor Artifact that belonged to Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, things would be quite troublesome.

“Little brat, just what Divine Ability is this? It’s completely different from your Space Principles earlier!” Wu Meng Chuan hollered again.

Yang Kai glanced at him coldly and snorted, “Why would a dying person ask so many questions?”

Wu Meng Chuan was taken aback before he immediately cackled, “You are truly bold! You should be proud that you were able to force this King to use the Blood Spirit Bottle!”

“Blood Spirit Bottle?” Yang Kai raised his brow, learning the name of this Emperor Artifact.

“Indeed!” Wu Meng Chuan imparted triumphantly, “This is the Emperor Artifact I inherited from my great Ancestor! Only descendants with the Wu Family bloodline can use it. Others would not be able to operate it. Although the Blood Spirit Bottle is not the pinnacle of my great Ancestor’s creations, it is more than enough to handle you.”

[This thing really is an Emperor Artifact passed down by Heaven Devouring Great Emperor to his descendants.] Yang Kai was baffled.

Wu Meng Chuan continued, “Don’t even think of escaping in this King’s Blood Spirit Bottle even if you are proficient in the Dao of Space. Today you will either submit to this King or die here!”

Yang Kai sneered, “You should take care of yourself first. Having taken this Young Master’s Divine Ability, how long can you live?”

Although Yang Kai failed to achieve the desired effect with his Time Flies Seal, Wu Meng Chuan was still injured by it, his ageing face the best proof of that. What’s more, the Flowing Time Force that invaded his body would not be easily dispersed. The Flowing Time Force would continue to consume Wu Meng Chuan’s vitality and he would eventually die of old age.

“A trivial Secret Technique, what can it do to me?” Wu Meng Chuan snorted coldly and stretched out his hand to make a move. The bloody water below him streamed towards him like a thousand rivers flowing back to the sea, and with the influx of bloody water, Wu Meng Chuan’s old face quickly regained its brilliance, and it seemed that it was no longer corroded by the flow of time.

But Yang Kai did not miss the frown which formed on Wu Meng Chuan’s face or the look of shock that soon followed.

Because his restored face was quickly ageing again.

“What kind of power is this!?” Wu Meng Chuan was finally triggered and he asked in shock.

His method of using blood to restore his vitality actually only worked temporarily rather than permanently. Unless he kept absorbing the blood from this place, he would soon die. After realizing this, Wu Meng Chuan was terrified. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Can’t you devour everything? Just try devouring it yourself and you’ll know!” He chimed sarcastically.

“Little brat, you court death! I had wanted to keep your life for my use, but now it seems that I must kill you!” Wu Meng Chuan was furious and waved his hands madly. The Blood Sea suddenly ferociously rioted, and a giant blood dragon emerged from its surface. The blood dragon looked as vivid as an actual dragon, and stared around with its house-sized eyes. It snapped its jaws and swung its claws as it threw itself at Yang Kai.

To Wu Meng Chuan’s surprise, Yang Kai just stood still and sneered gently at the ferocious attack.

[What the hell is he up to now?] Wu Meng Chuan worried in his heart, unsure of what Yang Kai was planning. To avoid accidents, he struck again, condensing several more blood dragons from the Blood Sea, surrounding Yang Kai in all directions.

Yang Kai snorted, “Wu Meng Chuan, your strength is also beyond this Young Master’s expectations; you should be proud you were able to force me to use this treasure!”

He actually returned Wu Meng Chuan’s words from earlier.

Unable to contain his anger, Wu Meng Chuan raged, “How dare a little brat like you be so arrogant? Within this King’s Blood Spirit Bottle’s Blood Sea, what other tricks do you have? Just die!”

“It’s you who is going to die!” Yang Kai responded sharply.

When the words fell, he stretched out his hand, summoning the Mountains and Rivers Bell and pouring his Source Qi and Spiritual Energy into it madly.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell grew rapidly; the magnificent drawings and runes on its surface came to life as it began releasing an ancient and desolate aura.

“This is…” Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes widened suddenly, staring at the Mountains and Rivers Bell in amazement, almost biting his tongue off in shock.

As a descendant of the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, he was naturally more aware of everything in the past and present that happened in the Shattered Star Sea than others. He knew every Great Emperor that had fallen here and what kind of treasures they left behind.

Therefore, he immediately recognized the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

“That’s impossible!” Wu Meng Chuan exclaimed.

No matter what, he could not believe that Yang Kai actually conquered the Mountains and Rivers Bell.

This was the Natal Emperor Artifact of the Yuan Ding Great Emperor! It was a primitive relic brought out by the Yuan Ding Great Emperor from the Ancient Wild Lands.

But hadn’t the Mountains and Rivers Bell escaped into The Void to suppress the Phoenix True Fire? Why was it in Yang Kai’s hands?

If the Mountains and Rivers Bell was here, then where was the Phoenix True Fire?

If this was truly the Mountains and Rivers Bell… Wu Meng Chuan was in grave danger!

*Dong… *

With a melodious chime of a bell, a shock wave visible to the naked eye spread out in all directions. The sound wave was seemingly mixed with a Heaven-destroying and Earth-shattering power that had an almost irresistible suppressive power to it.

The blood dragons that rushed to attack Yang Kai fell apart in an instant and splashed into pools of blood once more.

Wu Meng Chuan trembled as he could not help retreating several steps back, blood now oozing out of his ears and nose as he stumbled.

This was the true Mountains and Rivers Bell!

Everything turned white within Wu Meng Chuan’s vision, his head buzzing wildly as his mind was blinded by the shock.

Having personally endured the impact of the Mountains and Rivers Bell, he no longer doubted.

Wu Meng Chuan stiffened even more at the presence of the Mountains and Rivers Bell, immobilised in place by an invisible force. Even the bloody water that was bubbling below had suddenly become still without a single ripple.

The Mountains and Rivers Bell’s toll could suppress Worlds and invert the Heavens and Earth.

If there was nothing the Heaven Devouring Battle Law could not devour, then there was nothing the Mountains and Rivers Bell could not suppress.

*Pu… *

Finally, Wu Meng Chuan could not withhold any longer and spat a mouthful of blood, his face ageing drastically all of a sudden.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “Wu Meng Chuan, this place will be your deathbed, now obediently die for me!”

He roared and slammed his hand down, sending the Mountains and Rivers Bell plummeting into the Blood Sea, causing it to vanish.

But in the next moment, the entire Blood Sea bubbled madly, followed by crackling sounds from all directions.

Wu Meng Chuan was appalled and exclaimed sharply, “Stop! Stop or you will ruin this King’s Blood Spirit Bottle!”

The local space had been isolated by the Blood Spirit Bottle, integrating with it in a sense, but the Mountains and Rivers Bell was now shattering through the bounds of this space, creating a force that was impossible for the Blood Spirit Bottle to bear. The Emperor Artifact passed down by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor would surely be damaged greatly if this suppressive pressure continued much longer.

Yang Kai sneered, “Still worrying about the bottle when you’re about to lose your life!”

Yang Kai would not have chosen to act this way if the Blood Spirit Bottle could be of use for him; after all, it was a treasure passed down by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, so its value was surely immeasurable. However, since Wu Meng Chuan explained that only the descendants with the Wu Family bloodline could control it, it was useless even if Yang Kai captured it.

Therefore, he showed no mercy.

*Kacha… *

A more intense sound shook the ground.

Wu Meng Chuan paled, and shouted, “Stop! I have something to say.”

Yang Kai replied coldly, “I’m not listening to a single word you have to say!”

*Huala… *

The world that was enveloped by the Blood Sea broke with a loud crack, and the constrictive power that sealed the surroundings disappeared in an instant.
