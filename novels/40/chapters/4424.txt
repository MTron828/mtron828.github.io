Yang Kai’s thunderous voice spread across the entire Boundless Altar. In an instant, the World shook as countless eyes looked in the direction where the voice came from.

Most of the cultivators in Boundless Altar were puzzled as they had never heard of Void Land or Yang Kai before. That was because they were weak and they had rarely stepped out of Boundless Altar. Despite that, they could still clearly sense the hostility in the person’s voice, so they leaped into the air and charged in a particular direction. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

On the other hand, a small number of people had their expressions change drastically as their gazes were filled with horror.

Although Void Land wasn’t a household name as it wasn’t comparable to the Cave Heavens and Paradises, it was still a rising Star in recent years.

This great force was rising at a speed that was unprecedented.

The long lost legendary Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills were found in the Star City of that great force, which drew the attention of other great forces from all over the 3,000 Worlds.

Before that, the Hundred Sects Alliance, led by Heavenly Sword Union, invaded Void Land, but after the battle, the alliance was defeated, and even the Union Master of Heavenly Sword Union, Kong Feng, was executed on the battlefield.

More importantly, Boundless Altar was a part of that alliance, and they had suffered immense losses. Great Elder Ling Chun Qiu and a number of other Open Heaven Realm Masters were killed in Void Land, leaving no corpses behind.

Initially, Boundless Altar and Void Land had no contact with one another; after all, they were separated by several Great Territories, and they had no relationships of any kind. However, since the incident of the Hundred Sects Alliance, grudges had been formed between both parties.

Certainly, those from Boundless Altar were heartbroken at the fact that Ling Chun Qiu and the others were killed. Even though Boundless Altar was considered a Second Class great force, its heritage was weak. A Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was an important pillar in their great force, so Ling Chun Qiu’s death did have some negative impact on Boundless Altar.

Nevertheless, there was nothing they could do about it. The idea of avenging Ling Chun Qiu’s death never crossed their minds as the Hundred Sects Alliance was defeated and nearly wiped out, so how could Boundless Altar achieve anything on its own?

Rather than them looking for revenge, they had to consider themselves lucky if the other party didn’t come seeking trouble.

It could be said that all the great forces that besieged Void Land at that time shared the same sentiment. Recently, they had been hiding inside their great forces and doing their own things as they were afraid that those from Void Land would retaliate against them one day.

Those from Boundless Altar had never expected that Yang Kai would arrive at their great force and directly break their Grand Array!

Boundless Altar was considered a well established Second Class great force with a few tens of thousands of years of heritage. Supposedly, its Grand Array shouldn’t be so fragile to be broken with only one move. The reason this was happening was that none of them had expected that there was such a reckless person in the world who would directly barge into their Headquarters without even giving a warning.

The Grand Array wasn’t even fully activated when a crack was opened in it, which allowed Void Land’s ship to enter.

Furthermore, five Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had made a move at the same time, so regardless of how sturdy the Grand Array of Boundless Altar was, it could never endure the bombardment from so many powerful Masters. Even if it was fully operational, it would only have been a matter of time before it was destroyed.

Even the Nine Heavenly Layers was broken through once, to say nothing of the fact that the Grand Array in this place was significantly weaker than the Nine Heavenly Layers.

After moving through the crack, the ship silently hovered in the air with Yang Kai standing on the deck and looking down coldly at those below.

The person who came from the Spirit Peak turned pale and stared solemnly at Yang Kai as he asked, “Are you Void Land’s Sect Master Yang?”

Yang Kai looked condescendingly at him, “Who are you?”

The person cupped his fist and replied in a bitter voice, “Altar Master of Boundless Altar, Yuchi Cheng Zhou. Please forgive me for not greeting Your Excellency earlier as I was unaware of your arrival.”

Yang Kai arched his brow, “You’re the Altar Master of Boundless Altar?”

Yuchi Cheng Zhou dipped his head, “Yes.”

Yang Kai sized him up, and judging from the faint fluctuations coming from his body, he should be a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Yang Kai thought that Boundless Altar was pretty weak as the Altar Master was only a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

Since the increase in his strength, the height of Yang Kai’s vision had also grown significantly. Before going to the Shadowless Cave Heaven, he was still immensely pressured when he was faced with a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. When he was returning to the Star Boundary back then, he was completely powerless to resist someone like Hei He. In the end, he had to use a precious Mid-Rank World Fruit to help Lu Xue ascend from the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm to the Fifth-Order so that she would have the power to fight back against Hei He and eventually subdue him.

Now, he was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who had defeated Mao Zhe, a peak Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Numerous Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were also killed by him before; therefore, Yang Kai’s attitude was now different when he was faced with someone like Yuchi Cheng Zhou.

It had only been a short time since he arrived in the 3,000 Worlds, and he hadn’t come into contact with a lot of great forces, so he wasn’t aware that this was actually the norm amongst Second Class great forces.

According to the classification of great forces in the 3,000 Worlds, any place with Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters assuming command could claim to be Second Class. If a Sect had several Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, their heritage could be considered impressive. Some of the Second Class great forces only had Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters leading them. Although they were also Second Class great forces, they didn’t have the scale and power to match. Such great forces were actually found everywhere.

After sweeping a glance over Yuchi Cheng Zhou, Yang Kai asked, “Do you know an old fart named Ling Chun Qiu?”

Upon hearing that, Yuchi Cheng Zhou sported a bitter expression, knowing that his biggest fear had come to haunt him. When he heard Yang Kai mentioning his great force earlier, he knew that he was in trouble. It was apparent that those from Void Land were here to retaliate against them; therefore, at the mention of Ling Chun Qiu, he knew that his speculation was right.

He couldn’t help but secretly curse at Ling Chun Qiu for offending Void Land for no reason. Heavenly Sword Union’s Kong Feng had some ulterior motive for heading to Void Land, so it wasn’t necessary for Ling Chun Qiu to butt into that affair. Boundless Altar had nothing to do with Heavenly Sword Union to begin with, so they didn’t need to join forces with the latter.

Now that Yang Kai had stormed into Boundless Altar, how were they supposed to deal with him?

Yuchi Cheng Zhou said in a helpless voice, “To be honest with you, Sect Master Yang, Ling Chun Qiu is the Great Elder of Boundless Altar. He left with some people a few years ago, and he has gone missing since then. Why did you mention him all of a sudden? Have you come across him somewhere?”

It wasn’t like he could say he had no idea who Ling Chun Qiu was. As the Great Elder, Ling Chun Qiu held an important position in the Sect. It would be insincere if he said he didn’t know him. Now, he could only try to separate Boundless Altar from the feud so that they would be able to avoid calamity.

As for avenging Ling Chun Qiu’s death, he wouldn’t even dare to think about it. He had seen the people on the ship making a move earlier. There were five Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, so they could easily destroy the entire Boundless Altar.

“He went missing?” Yang Kai sneered, “Is that really the case?”

Yuchi Cheng Zhou’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he nodded, “I wouldn’t dare to lie to you, Sect Master Yang. Please understand.”

As they spoke, the cultivators from Boundless Altar were flying over from different directions. They still had no idea what was going on when they stood behind Yuchi Cheng Zhou. However, upon seeing that the Altar Master was quite anxious, they realised that they were in a perilous situation, so they sported solemn expressions.

Yang Kai stared seriously at Yuchi Cheng Zhou for a moment before he nodded gently, “I’ll take your word for it. Since you don’t know where Ling Chun Qiu is, I’ll tell you now. That old dog brought some people to invade Void Land, and he was killed by me for his transgression.”

Yuchi Cheng Zhou pretended to be shocked as he exclaimed, “Why would he do something so foolish!?”

Yang Kai stared at him and felt disgusted, thinking that the Altar Master could indeed put on a good show.

A frustrated Yuchi Cheng Zhou said, “The Great Elder was old, and he sometimes made rash decisions. A few years ago, he was pretty dejected over something, so he decided to go out and travel. He hasn’t returned since then. We all thought that he was cultivating in seclusion somewhere, but we never expected that he had made such a huge mistake.” Following that, he bowed deeply at Yang Kai, “Please forgive him, Sect Master Yang. He has paid the ultimate price for the mistake since he was killed. I hope you will not try to settle accounts with him now.”

There was a devious smile on Yang Kai’s face as he said, “Why would I settle accounts with a dead person?”

Yuchi Cheng Zhou’s expression changed. Yang Kai’s words suggested that he was going to settle accounts with those who were living instead. Knowing that the crisis was unavoidable, Yuchi Cheng Zhou secretly sighed and cupped his fist, “Regardless of his reasons, Ling Chun Qiu was the Great Elder of Boundless Altar. As he has offended Sect Master Yang and Void Land, we’ll have to bear some responsibility. Since you’ve come all the way here, we’re willing to pay a price in the hope of appeasing your wrath. Please give us a chance to live!”

After he finished speaking, the people behind him appeared vexed. No one would feel pleased when they had to act so subservient in their own Headquarters; however, none of them dared to express their fury. The Altar Master’s obsequious behaviour suggested the other party was too formidable. If they got into a conflict, Boundless Altar would suffer a huge loss.

“It’s surprising to know that you’re such a sensible person, Altar Master Yuchi.” Yang Kai looked meaningfully at him.

He was initially filled with murderous intent as he was ready to help the Proprietress vent her anger here, but was rendered almost speechless by Yuchi Cheng Zhou’s eloquence.

Since the other party was acting so polite, his murderous intent subsided.

With a lowered gaze, Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before declaring, “Since you’re willing to offer some compensation, Altar Master Yuchi, we can certainly talk it out.”

...

Yuchi Cheng Zhou breathed a sigh of relief, “What demands do you have, Sect Master Yang?”

Yang Kai replied dispassionately, “When the Hundred Sects Alliance invaded Void Land, I declared in front of Ling Chun Qiu and all others present to hear that not only would I kill them, but I would also wipe out the Sects behind them, down to the last chicken and dog.”

He had indeed said such a thing to both Ling Chun Qiu and Qi Jin at that time.

The expressions of Yuchi Cheng Zhou and the cultivators from Boundless Altar changed drastically upon hearing that.

Yang Kai’s cold voice went on to reverberate as he continued, “This King initially intended to honour those words; however, since you’re such a reasonable man, this King will give you two choices. Do you want me to destroy the Sect or kill everyone here?”

Was there a difference between the two options? It seemed that this matter couldn’t be resolved peacefully.

Yuchi Cheng Zhou sported a dark expression as he said in a grim voice, “Sect Master Yang, we’re willing to appease you, so why do you insist on acting ruthlessly?”

Yang Kai snorted, “When the Hundred Sects Alliance invaded Void Land, no one forced you all to join. Since you’ve committed the act, you must pay the price. One’s mistakes must be paid for in kind.”
