A thousand metres underground, Yang Kai stood up.

While this was a rare opportunity to cultivate, and it would be difficult to encounter such rich World Energy in the future, Yang Kai did not intend to waste time simply cultivating here and instead was determined to investigate what the root cause of this phenomenon was.

What’s more, he had just made a breakthrough and would not be able to break through again in a short period.

Sending Liu Yan a Divine Sense Message, Yang Kai asked her to continue protecting the others in their group before he began his own investigation.

Soon, something caught Yang Kai’s eye and he was about to take a closer look, when suddenly he frowned and turned to look in the direction of the entrance.

A vast crowd had gathered, and it seemed like many cultivators had found their way here, underground.

“There’s someone over there! There really was someone who came down ahead of us.”

“Bastard, he must be the one who interfered with my breakthrough!”

“Let’s go and find out who has such courage!”

The sound of loud chattering reached Yang Kai and he quickly released his Divine Sense to investigate the surrounding situation.

Soon, he discovered the problem. The surrounding World Energy had become a little bit thinner than before. Although the difference wasn’t obvious, it was noticeable.

Perceiving this, Yang Kai could not help turning his head to look at Liu Yan’s hiding place, unsure if it was because the Sealed World Bead was devouring World Energy.

This slight difference was not to be underestimated. It was very likely that this little change had prevented these cultivators from reaching a critical point in their breakthrough and had thus drawn so many of them down here to search for the cause.

Yang Kai hurriedly stretched out his hand to retrieve Liu Yan and the Sealed World Bead to avoid anyone catching them absorbing the World Energy.

Then, he stood there waiting quietly.

“Boy, no matter which Sect you are from, you’re dead this time.”

“Come over and apologize if you’re smart, maybe I will spare you your life!”

“This old lady will fight you for taking away my precious opportunity to break through!”

A group of people protested, putting the blame all on Yang Kai, approaching him quickly.

After a while, a group of people stopped in front of Yang Kai.

“Ah... it’s you... “

“This, this, this... “

All the cultivators who were yelling fell silent when they saw Yang Kai and stood in place with cold sweat on their foreheads, showing anxious looks on their faces.

The memory of Yang Kai killing Qu Huai Ren and murdering Zhuang Pan was still vivid in their minds, and all were fearful of provoking Yang Kai. All of them felt horrified about protesting without understanding the situation and were unsure if they had angered this monster.

“Need something?” Yang Kai looked at a group of people indifferently, his words cold.

“No, no, no...”

“It’s nothing, we just came down to have a look, hahaha, the scenery below is good...”

“That’s right, that’s right, we were just curious to have a look!”

“Really?” Yang Kai raised the corners of his mouth and said lightly, “Since the scenery is good, you shouldn’t miss it. You should all take a walk and look around.”

“Yes, yes, yes! We’ll go now!”

Not a single person dared to stop at the sight of his cold expression; they proceeded quickly and headed deeper. Just before leaving, many stared in the direction where Hua Qing Si sat.

With the strength of everyone present, it was natural for them to sense Hua Qing Si’s cultivation realm. It was not shocking that they sensed her Third-Order Dao Source Realm aura though, as there were several others with equivalent cultivations, what was noticeable, however, was the inexplicable aura lingering about her.

Emperor Intent!

Amazingly, they could sense Emperor Intent coming from Hua Qing Si, a sign she was on the verge of reaching the Emperor Realm.

In other words, this woman was very likely to break through to the Emperor Realm in the future.

Undoubtedly it would cause everyone to be shocked and envious. They did not know if Hua Qing Si had Emperor Intent before now, or if she only achieved it by cultivating here in this rich World Energy environment.

With the presence of such a Master here, being protected by this madman Yang Kai, no one dared to remain.

It didn’t take long for everyone to scatter.

After they left, Yang Kai released Liu Yan again and had her remain here to stand guard.

Immediately afterwards, Yang Kai moved deeper as well.

The more he ventured inside, the richer the World Energy became, as if in some unknowable place down below, World Energy was gushing forth from some kind of source.

Yang Kai could not help being curious, wondering what could create such a surge of World Energy like this. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Those cultivators who left before him were not far ahead.

Suddenly, someone called out in shock up ahead, followed by many similar gasps.

They seemed to have discovered something extraordinary.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, and pushing the surrounding Space Principles, he disappeared in a flash and reappeared beside everyone.

In the blink of an eye, he appeared at the head of the crowd.

Following the gazes of the others, Yang Kai could not help but squint at what he saw.

Not far in front of him was a round pit covering a five metre radius, and from this pit Liquid Spirit Qi was gushing up into the air.

“Spirit Spring! Heavens, it’s a Spirit Spring Eye!”

“I can’t believe there’s a Spirit Spring Eye here... “

“No wonder the World Energy is so rich here, it’s all thanks to this Spirit Spring.”

“It should be a Mid-Rank Spirit Spring. If a Sect was established here, it would rise to prominence within a hundred years!”

Everyone present was from a second-class family or Sect, so none of their forces owned a treasure like a Spirit Spring. Only the first-class Sects were qualified to occupy such a treasure land.

Everyone was excited, their eyes brightening as they thought about what kind of earth-shaking changes would occur if they could migrate their Sect here to occupy this Spirit Spring.

It was possible that in less than a hundred years they would be able to rise to compete with first-class Sects.

“Now... I’m afraid there will be trouble,” someone said sadly with a heavy sigh.

“What does this friend mean? There is a Spirit Spring right in front of us, so why are you saying trouble will come?” Someone asked, unable to comprehend.

“That’s right, why are you acting so sullen with such a Heaven-sent opportunity before you?” Some sneered.

The speaker did not argue back and simply sighed, “Have you ever thought about why until now, despite a High-Rank Earth Vein and a Source Crystal lode appearing near Maplewood City no top tier Sect came to investigate?”

“Why? Because even though it is a High-Rank Earth Vein and a Source Crystal lode, it’s not worth those big Sects fighting over. Only small Sects like ours will regard them as treasures.”

“Exactly!” The man looked around, “But what if news of this Spirit Spring spreads out?”

With that, everyone was dumbfounded and their expressions changed slightly, finally understanding the situation.

If the news of a Spirit Spring spread out, none of them would be able to claim this place as the top forces would definitely send Masters to occupy this land, possibly even opening up branches of their Sects here.

The second-class families and Sects would simply be unable to fight against these behemoths and would be forced to watch this delicious meal be snatched away from them...

Considering all this, everyone was suddenly depressed, their earlier excitement and joy dissipating entirely.

“We... we could all swear an oath, on pain of a heart demon, to never spread this news out?” Someone suggested quietly.

Everyone glanced at the speaker, as if they were looking at an idiot, their eyes full of mockery.

There were no impervious walls in this world, and no matter how well they concealed the matter of the Spirit Spring, it was impossible to hide it forever. One day, it would become known to those top Sects.

Besides, many cultivators were allies with or even subjects of big Sects here, so they would send word to their backers after discovering this treasure.

How could this discovery be hidden for long?

“It was just a suggestion...” The man who proposed quickly realized that it would not work and smiled helplessly.

*Hong... *

At this moment, there was an explosion and a gush of Liquid Spirit Qi shot up from the sky, transforming into World Energy Rain that poured down on the surroundings.

“What?”

“What happened?”

“Heavens, are you kidding me?”

“It’s... another Spirit Spring!”

Everyone was stunned for a moment, gawking at a spot some fifty metres away from where another Spirit Spring had just appeared, Liquid Spirit Qi bursting out of it like a fountain.

The World Energy aura underground became richer in an instant.

Yang Kai too, stood dumbfounded.

Spirit Springs were naturally formed and could only be encountered by chance. It would already be a great stroke of fortune for a big Sect to occupy a single Spirit Spring and create a cultivation paradise.

However, two Spirit Springs appeared at once only two thousand kilometres away from Maplewood City. Looking at the scale, both these Spirit Springs were Mid-Rank as well.

*Hong Hong Hong... *

As if the incident was not shocking enough though, the air was filled with the rumbling sounds as the earth shook and the surrounding World Energy aura rapidly increased in density.

There were a few cultivators unable to reach the critical point in their breakthrough earlier because the World Energy had become too thin, but now, the Source Qi in their bodies fluctuated wildly all of a sudden, and they once again showed signs of breaking through.

However, everyone ignored their own conditions and stood in a daze as they stared around in awe.

It was dim underground, with the flood of World Energy, the surroundings became barely visible, but everyone present was a Dao Source Realm Master so they were able to grasp their situation with a sweep of their Divine Sense.

Everyone was shocked as one Spirit Spring after another appeared, and within a short time, the entire underground cavern before them was covered in densely packed Spirit Springs.
