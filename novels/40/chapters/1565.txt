Chapter 1565, Shimmering Moon City

What Yang Kai needed most right now was information.

It should be easy for him to find where Shan Qing Luo was; after all, she was the adopted daughter of the Red Moon Tribal Lord, so she would be wherever the Red Moon Tribal Lord was.

Shan Qing Luo’s heart-piercing cries from when the Emperor Garden closed still echoed in Yang Kai’s ears.

Now that he had come to Monster Emperor Star, naturally, he needed to see for himself if that enchantress was living well.

A few days later, Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang flew out from the deep mountains and lush forests. Along the way, Yang Kai had encountered a lot of Monster Beasts, but all of them were feral so he could not glean any useful information from them, making him feel quite helpless.

He could only pin his hopes on meeting someone in the future.

While speeding along aimlessly with Xia Ning Chang, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to scan their surroundings.

Suddenly, he noticed something, turned towards a certain direction, and said, “There’s movement over there, let’s go take a look.”

“En,” Xia Ning Chang naturally had no objections.

The pair landed and walked side by side in the direction Yang Kai pointed out just now, a short time later encountering a team of about a dozen cultivators.

These cultivators exuded a wild aura quite different from the aura a human cultivator possessed. Additionally, each of them had some physical characteristics that resembled a Monster Beast.

The dozen or so cultivators in this team obviously belonged to the Monster Race!

Each of these Monster Race cultivators was riding a wolf-shaped Monster Beast and wore matching golden armour, giving them an imposing appearance. Even though there were only a dozen or so of them, as they rode forward, they appeared akin to a torrent of fine steel and created quite a loud disturbance.

Sweeping them with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that the strongest cultivator from the Monster Race cultivator was just a Second-Order Saint King, so he had nothing to fear.

Taking Xia Ning Chang with him, Yang Kai walked out openly to greet this group.

“Excuse me,” When he got closer, Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fists to the Monster Race cultivator who seemed to be the team’s leader. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The other party had obviously spotted him a long time ago and rode his wolf-shaped Monster Beast mount over to Yang Kai while looking down at him condescendingly, a natural air of contempt and scrutiny flashing across his eyes.

The Monster Beast mount also projected a malicious aura towards Yang Kai’s face, as if it could not wait to stretch out its mouth and see if Yang Kai tasted delicious or not...

Yang Kai just smiled lightly to all of this.

This was Monster Emperor Star, a world dominated by the Monster Race, so it was only natural for Monster Race cultivators to have a natural sense of superiority when facing those from other races. They felt that no race could compare to their supreme Monster Race and that none were more powerful than them. In front of the Monster Race, all others could only bow their heads and serve them!

“Humans?” The lead Monster Race cultivator squinted at Yang Kai, recognizing his origins immediately.

The wolf-shaped Monster Beast mount also growled, seemingly perceiving its master’s dislike for these two and began circling around Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang.

After returning to his previous position, the Monster Race cultivator coldly snorted and said, “What are you two humans doing out here?”

“Haha, we accidentally lost our way, if you would not mind, could you tell us where this place is?”

“This is the Red Moon Territory!” The Monster Race cultivator replied proudly, “It is the region under the jurisdiction of the great Red Moon Tribal Lord. Don’t you know even this?”

“En, I know this is the territory of Red Moon Tribal Lord,” Yang Kai chuckled, “What I want to ask is, where is the nearest city? If it is convenient, can you tell me where Red Moon Tribal Lord’s palace is located?”

“Why do you want to know where Lady Tribal Lord’s palace is located?” The Monster Race cultivator suddenly wore a cold expression after hearing this as he glared at Yang Kai more and more unkindly, “What are your intentions here?”

“Nothing serious, I just happen to have a friend who lives in Red Moon Tribal Lord’s palace. I was hoping to see her,” Yang Kai replied casually.

“A friend...” The Monster Race cultivator was taken aback for a moment but soon burst into laughter filled with mockery; even the other Monster Race cultivators began laughing.

“Human, I advise you to give up, no one is allowed to approach Lady Tribal Lord’s palace without being summoned, not even my Monster Race, let alone you humans! However, you may rest assured, Lady Tribal Lord has always been kind to you humans. If your friend is a servant in the palace, he or she should be living well.”

He subconsciously thought that the friend Yang Kai was referring to was just an insignificant person in the palace.

This was normal though, the humans in Lady Tribal Lord’s palace were all either beautiful women or handsome men who served as nothing more than servants.

In the territory of the Monster Race, humans always had low status.

“En, many thanks for this friend’s reminder; however, I still wish to know where the palace is,” Yang Kai insisted.

“Humans are always as arrogant as you, that’s why I can’t stand you all!” The Monster Race cultivator snorted coldly as he declared arrogantly, “I can tell you, but why should I? Give me a reason.”

“Here!” Yang Kai nodded before throwing out a bag of Saint Crystals.

The Monster Race cultivator caught this bag, opened it, and suddenly became ecstatic as he exclaimed, “High-Rank Saint Crystals!”

As soon as these words came out, the other Monster Race cultivators showed a greedy look as they stared back and forth between the package and Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang.

Malicious glints were mixed in with their gazes.

“Can you tell me now?” Yang Kai looked at the other party with a smile.

“Of course, you’re quite tactful for a human so I’ll tell you,” The Monster Race cultivator hesitated for a moment before his expression settled and he began telling Yang Kai what he wanted to know.

A short time later, Yang Kai cupped his fists to the Monster Race man before taking Xia Ning Chang away.

“Leader, those humans were obviously quite rich, why did you let them go?” A Monster Race cultivator who seemed to be relatively young approached and asked indignantly.

“Hmph, you think I can’t see how rich he is?”

“Then why didn’t we bury them here? This is the wilderness, so even if Lady Chi Yue doesn’t allow us to kill humans at will, no one will know if they die here.”

“Idiot! If we really tried that, the ones who would be buried here wouldn’t be them but us!”

“Huh... that’s not possible, is it?” The Monster Race youth was not convinced.

“Of course it’s possible, even though he was so rich, when he was facing so many of us, did you ever see him show the slightest bit of fear? Even the human woman next to him was completely calm. What does this mean? It means that neither of them puts us in their eyes! You idiots were blinded by those Saint Crystals and completely ignored their strength. Because this is the wilderness, I don’t dare to act rashly, otherwise...”

Hearing what his team leader said, the Monster Race youth couldn’t help leaking cold sweat as he glanced reluctantly in the direction Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang left while sighing, “That woman looked tender and delicate, if I could have just a bite...”

Some cultivators from the Monster Race were transformed from Monster Beasts, so they still maintained their habits of eating other creatures raw.

But in general, there were not many such cultivators. Most Monster Race cultivators were born in human form and just retained some traces of their Monster Beast heritage.

Clearly, this Monster Race was born a Monster Beast and had achieved human form later, which was why he had no interest in Xia Ning Chang’s face, which was hidden behind her black veil, but instead coveted her fair skin and delicate physique.

Soft and tender humans were always delicious, especially young human women...

“Enough nonsense, Thousand Eyes Tribal Lord’s son should already be on his way here, we need to find his whereabouts and then send word back to so that Lady Tribal Lord can send out a proper escort. We cannot afford a single mistake in this mission,” The lead Monster Race cultivator quickly said, but soon, a layer of haze appeared on his face as he ground his teeth, “I don’t know how many women from our territory will be ruined at the Young Lord’s hand.”

Hearing him mention this Young Lord of Lord Qian Yan, all the Monster Race cultivators fell silent, as if they deeply dreaded him.

.....

“Junior Brother, what should we do now?” Xia Ning Chang followed behind Yang Kai and asked softly.

“Let’s go to the nearest city first,” Yang Kai sighed. Although he had easily learned the location of the Red Moon Tribal Lord’s palace from the Monster Race cultivator, it was impossible for him to just go there to find Shan Qing Luo.

The Monster Race man he spoke to had said very clearly that no one was allowed to approach the Tribal Lord’s palace without being summoned.

Even those from the Monster Race did not dare violate this rule, not to mention that Yang Kai and Xia Ning Chang were just humans.

Chi Yue, one of the Ten Great Tribal Lords on Monster Emperor Star, was inside that palace, so even if Yang Kai was confident in his strength, he wouldn’t dare act carelessly around an Origin King Realm master like her. On top of that, from what Bi Luo had told him, Chi Yue seemed to be a Second-Order Origin King.

If he were to try to force his way in, he would likely die!

He had to think of a better way. It would be best if he could send a message to Shan Qing Luo and let her come out to see him herself.

Yang Kai was lost in thought.

One day later, he and Xia Ning Chang arrived in front of a Monster Race city.

Shimmering Moon City was a little different from the cities Yang Kai had previously been to. The buildings in this city were filled with a rough and wild style that matched with the Monster Race, and while not exquisite, it still had a grand and imposing feeling.

Naturally, it was not just the Monster Race that lived in this city, there were also humans who were coming and going.

Red Moon Tribal Lord was better in this regard compared to other Tribal Lords. In her territory, no Monster Race could kill innocent humans without cause. Although humans still had low status, they had their own talents, and it was these talents Chi Yue fancied, which was why she created a space for humans to survive in.

The other nine Tribal Lords did not share Chi Yue’s level of foresight.

This was especially true for Wild Lion Tribal Lord who was the most addicted to killing and slaughter. In his territory, if there were traces of any humans, his children would follow his doctrine and kill all humans on sight, partaking of their flesh and blood.

As a result, the humans that originally lived in his territory had all scattered and fled, most rushing to Red Moon Territory, a relatively safe region for Humans.

Generally speaking, the two races lived in harmony in Shimmering Moon City. Of course, humans always had inferior status.
