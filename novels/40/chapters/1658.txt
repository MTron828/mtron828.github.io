Chapter 1658, Return To Pure Ice Island

Meeting a group of relatives and friends after so long, it was easy to feel their care and concern.

Yang Kai’s body and mind both felt warmed by this sight.

He reaffirmed that his decision to return to Tong Xuan Realm and bring out all these people was the correct one, despite the difficulties it had involved.

A great tree needed strong roots, just as a flowing river needed a source; these people from Tong Xuan Realm were Yang Kai’s.

Wood without roots and water without a source were destined to dry out quickly.

Inside the Sealed World Bead, in order to celebrate the return of Su Yan, the Three Clans put on a grand and extremely lively banquet.

During the banquet, drinks were pushed around constantly and no matter what one’s cultivation or age was, they all became swept up in the festive atmosphere.

Yang Kai was nearly drowned by all the toasts from the Three Clans’ masters, causing him to wake up the next day with a splitting headache.

Afterwards, Yang Kai stayed with his parents for two more days to fulfil his filial piety duties before leaving the Sealed World Bead.

Before leaving, however, Yang Kai taught Su Yan the Monster Transformation Secret Art.

Now that Su Yan possessed the Ice Phoenix Source, she too could cultivate the Monster Transformation and slowly develop the Source strength inside her body to strengthen herself.

He also gave her the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal.

This supreme treasure had originally been used to hold the Sun’s True Essence, and although it was now no longer useful to Yang Kai, it was an extremely useful auxiliary cultivation tool to Su Yan.

With the Ten Thousand Year Ice Jade Pedestal, Su Yan’s cultivation speed should increase by at least thirty percent.

With everything arranged, Yang Kai flew towards Ice Heart Valley again.

Pure Ice Island had returned to its original tranquillity.

The disciples seemed to have recovered from the aftermath of the shocking war that erupted several months ago and had now resumed their regular cultivation, spending their days calmly and peacefully.

On the Outer Island, below a certain ice peak, a woman in a white dress was sweeping a small ice road when suddenly a gust of wind rushed past and she couldn’t help shivering as an inexplicable sense of panic rose from her heart.

She looked up suspiciously and scanned her surroundings, but ultimately found nothing.

Feeling doubtful, she checked around herself for a while longer, but after still discovering nothing, she simply shook her head and continued to clean the ice road.

In front of an ice peak not far from this woman, a figure mysteriously appeared.

This figure walked forward towards a certain ice room, and after a short time, he arrived at his destination. Looking at the barrier in front of him, barring his path, this figure smiled slightly, stretched out his hand, and slashed towards the space.

A series of ripples emerged as the barrier split open and he walked directly inside.

Inside the ice room, Qing Ya sat cross-legged on the ground, her delicate cheeks resting on her hands as she stared at the Stone Puppet in front of her.

She seemed to be very interested in the Stone Puppet.

Yang Kai and Su Yan had killed two Origin Kings with shocking methods that day then immediately retreated, leaving her behind. Qing Ya had no complaints about this though, as she could vaguely tell that Yang Kai and Su Yan were both injured during this battle and had no leeway to remain.

What’s more, even though Yang Kai left, this weird Stone Puppet remained to guard her, so Qing Ya certainly wouldn’t have any complaints.

She also knew that Yang Kai and Su Yan would definitely return to Ice Heart Valley to take her away at some point.

These days, Qing Ya had remained behind closed doors, looking forward to the day she would leave this ice room, but when she was bored, she would often come and exchange stares with the Stone Puppet.

She discovered that although the Stone Puppet had its own sentience, no matter how she tried to communicate with it, it would not respond, instead just following her around all day silently.

“Little guy, when do you think Yang Kai and Su Yan will come?” Qing Ya sighed lightly. Once, she was proud to belong to Ice Heart Valley, but after her most recent experiences, she could not wait to leave this Sect that so greatly disappointed her and almost forced her to her death.

“Haa, you look a bit dull but how can you not even know how to speak?” Qing Ya stretched out her hand and flicked the Stone Puppet’s forehead lightly

This flick naturally caused no harm, but the Stone Puppet still blinked and wore a bewildered expression on its face.

Qing Ya was amused by its appearance and could not help giggling.

“Seems like you’re in a good mood,” Suddenly, a voice called out from behind her.

Qing Ya’s complexion changed greatly and she instinctually began condensing her Saint Qi, but after realizing who this voice belonged to, her frightened expression turned to one of pleasant surprise.

Turning around, Qing Ya saw a young man standing behind her smiling brightly, his presence like a ray of warm sunlight, dispelling the cold and darkness in the ice room.

The Stone Puppet’s two small black eyes also burst with life as he scampered over to the young man, stretched out his thick fingers, then pointed to himself and Qing Ya in turn, as if trying to express something but unable to form the words.

“I know, you’ve done a good job guarding her!” The young man patted the Stone Puppet on the head.

The Stone Puppet’s small eyes narrowed, obviously feeling quite happy.

“Yang Kai!” Qing Ya shouted as her face flushed slightly.

It seemed that the scene where she was talking to herself just now was seen by him, embarrassing Qing Ya a little.

But soon, Qing Ya adjusted her mood and asked with concern, “Are you all right?”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and replied, “If I wasn’t, I wouldn’t be here.”

“That’s good. Ah... what about Su Yan?” Qing Ya’s face changed as she was unable to see Su Yan’s figure anywhere and could not help worrying that something bad had happened.

“Su Yan is in a very safe place,” Yang Kai motioned to her not to be nervous, “I’m here to take you away. Are you ready?”

Qing Ya took a deep breath then nodded firmly, “I’m ready.”

“Then let’s go!” Yang Kai nodded before suddenly frowning slightly and glancing in a certain direction, smiling wryly a moment later, “En, seems I was still noticed.”

At that moment, a cold voice echoed in the ice room, “Since Young Master Yang has taken the trouble to come, why leave so hastily? If you have time, why not come to Pure Ice Peak so we can chat?”

“Supreme Elder!” Qing Ya’s beautiful face lost all colour as she exclaimed in shock, recognizing that the voice which had just sounded belonged to Ice Heart Valley’s Supreme Elder, Luo Li.

Yang Kai cast her a reassuring look before staring into the distance, a subtle grin appearing on his face as he called out, “It would be rude for Junior to refuse Senior’s kind invitation!”

“Then this Queen will await your arrival on Pure Ice Peak!” Luo Li’s voice sounded once more before her Divine Sense presence disappeared.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai waved to Qing Ya. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Yang Kai...” Qing Ya’s face filled with worry.

“Rest assured, she has no malicious intentions,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Hearing this, Qing Ya relaxed and quickly followed after Yang Kai as he walked out of the ice room.

Stepping outside, Qing Ya couldn’t help gasping slightly when she saw a dozen people standing nearby, the Valley Master, Great Elder, and other high-level figures of Ice Heart Valley among them, all of them seemingly waiting to see Yang Kai.

When these women saw Yang Kai, all of their expressions couldn’t help becoming solemn and respectful.

Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged as he simply nodded to them.

“Young Master Yang...” Bing Long quickly greeted Yang Kai, but how she did so was far more respectful than before. It was obvious that the shocking battle that day had left a huge impact on her.

“Senior Bing Long!” Yang Kai cupped his fists.

“Please don’t be so polite,” Bing Long waved her hand quickly, “If Young Master Yang does not mind, please address this Mistress as Bing Long.”

A visible look of relief spread across Bing Long’s face. Before she came here, she was frightened Yang Kai would not give her any face or would speak insulting words. She was prepared to endure humiliation, but Yang Kai had spoken in a relaxed and casual manner instead while not neglecting proper etiquette, making Bing Long feel as if she had been a bit overly suspicious and pessimistic.

Thinking so, Bing Long was somewhat ashamed.

Seeing that Yang Kai did not seem to bear hostility towards Ice Heart Valley, Bing Long felt a great weight lift from her heart.

“I’ll have to ask Valley Master Bing to lead the way,” Yang Kai nodded.

“En, this way please!” Bing Long stepped back and gave way.

Yang Kai stepped forward.

Inside the crowd, Ran Yun Ting’s expression changed several times, but in the end, she couldn’t hold herself back and called out, “Where is Su Yan? Is she alright?”

Yang Kai stopped, turned around, and gave Ran Yun Ting a faint look.

The hearts of more than a dozen Elders immediately clenched tightly, and even Bing Long’s expression became tense, all of them silently sending signals to Ran Yun Ting to hold her tongue.

Ran Yun Ting turned a blind eye to all of this however and simply met Yang Kai’s gaze head-on with a bitter smile, “I’m not qualified to serve as her Honoured Master any longer, but that does not mean I am not worried about whether Su Yan is safe or now.”

“She’s safe, you need not worry about her!” Yang Kai responded lightly.

“As long as she’s safe,” Ran Yun Ting breathed a sigh of relief.

“From now on, Su Yan has nothing to do with Ice Heart Valley,” After Yang Kai made this declaration, he continued to walk forward.

Ran Yun Ting’s body trembled as the bitterness on her face became even more obvious. At the same time, the other Elders present sighed and shook their heads sadly.

Pure Ice Peak was the central ice peak of Pure Ice Island. It was not the tallest or most majestic ice peak, but it had the richest World Energy. Supreme Elder Luo Li of Ice Heart Valley lived in seclusion here.

It was rumoured that there was a pond which overflowed with cold energy on Pure Ice Peak, and that anyone who cultivated an Ice Attribute Secret Art nearby would be able to cultivate far faster than normal.

When the small group arrived at the base of Pure Ice Peak, Bing Long and the others came to a stop, “This is Pure Ice Peak. Supreme Elder is waiting for you at the summit, please enter, Young Master Yang!”

Without the Supreme Elder’s permission, no one could enter Pure Ice Peak, so Bing Long and the others could only remain here.

Yang Kai nodded, then turned to Qing Ya and said, “You wait for me here.”

“Ok,” Qing Ya nodded.

Yang Kai then set foot on a set of jade white steps as he ascended the mountain.

Along the way, cold and bitter winds whipped about as an icy strength which seemed capable of freezing anything under the Heavens filled the air.

Yang Kai was unaffected by this as he walked forward, he even had some spare capacity to enjoy the surrounding scenery.

A quarter of an hour later, Yang Kai arrived at the summit.

It only took a single glance for Yang Kai to take in everything at this summit as this place was extremely sparse. There were no grand ice palaces or pavilions present, only a small, thatched house covered in snow that seemed like it would leak wind from all sides.

The Supreme Elder of Ice Heart Valley, Luo Li, sat cross-legged inside this thatched hut with a small stone table in front of her. Atop this stone table was a pot of lightly steaming tea which was somehow isolated from the surrounding cold.

When Yang Kai arrived, the tea seemed to have just finished steeping.

Luo Li opened her eyes, looked at Yang Kai, smiled slightly, and gestured, “Young Master Yang, please sit down!”

Yang Kai cupped his fists, “Junior won’t stand on ceremony then!”

Saying so, he walked over and sat down cross-legged opposite of Luo Li.
