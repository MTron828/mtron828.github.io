Xue Yue’s unreasonable appearance angered Yang Kai.

Staring at her coldly for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly snorted and took a step towards her position with a fierce glow in his eyes, causing Xue Yue’s face to flicker with fear.

The next moment, Yang Kai stretched out his hands, seized Xue Yue’s soft, tender body, and under her stunned and terrified gaze, leaned over and forcefully kissed her luscious lips. At the same time, Yang Kai’s hands wantonly groped her body, his movements were extremely rough, without showing the slightest bit of tender affection.

“It hurts, you bastard!” Xue Yue exclaimed hurriedly as she pulled her lips away and tried to shove him off, but no matter how hard she pushed Yang Kai, she was unable to free herself, making her feel like she was trying to move a towering mountain.

But along with the pain, another strange feeling spread throughout her body...

Something between a groan and a moan leaked from her lips as Xue Yue’s struggling weakened and her body went limp.

The surrounding Illusionary Void Butterflies flapped their wings, creating a light humming sound and a glittering multi-coloured backdrop to the twos’ intimate activity.

The Blood Beasts fought and killed the enemy while the giant dark green dragon roared loudly...

Only after a long time did their lips finally separate.

Yang Kai shoved Xue Yue away, only giving her a passing glance as if she were some used pair of shoes to be abandoned.

Xue Yue’s cheeks were bright red, as was her white neck, and her body seemed to have lost all strength. After leaving Yang Kai’s arms, she staggered slightly, and her eyes darted back and forth, no longer carrying the same aggressive light from before.

“Satisfied?” Yang Kai snorted.

“You...” Xue Yue opened her mouth but did not know what to say.

“Damn it, what’s wrong with you!?” Yang Kai yelled angrily, “Pestering me endlessly with all this nonsense, just what is it you’re trying to achieve!?”

Xue Yue’s face instantly became aggrieved and her eyes became moist, as if she was about to cry, but she quickly adjusted her mood after taking a deep breath, then she grit her teeth and spat, “What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you!? Hmph, in any case, I got what I wanted.”

“This is what you wanted?” Yang Kai looked at her sarcastically.

“What of it?” Xue Yue bit her red lips, “In this world, aside from my father and several of the chambers of commerce’s Elders, the only one who knows I am a woman is you. I don’t want to die before experiencing what it’s like to actually be a woman!”

“So, you thought we were going to die,” Yang Kai suddenly understood why this woman was acting so madly.

“En, you said that dying on a bed of flowers was the best way to go, so what does it matter if I act like this?” Xue Yue let out a peal of sweet laughter, “At least if I die here, I’ll die a woman, fulfilling one small wish of mine.”

“Sure enough, you’ve gone completely mad,” Yang Kai shook his head slightly.

Xue Yue snorted lightly as she turned away, “Think what you want.”

After saying so, Xue Yue seemed to relax a lot and became much more energetic, even her face filled with dazzling brilliance.

“Let me say this first: Everything I’ve done today was because you forced me to, I won’t take any responsibility,” Yang Kai pointed at Xue Yue and declared shamelessly.

“Who wants you to take responsibility?” Xue Yue pouted, “I know you have women, and more than one at that, but... as the saying goes, a wife is inferior to a concubine, so a concubine might as well steal...”

“Seems you know more than you let on,” Yang Kai chuckled before sighing and staring at Xue Yue solemnly. “It has not been easy for you.”

Xue Yue pursed her lips, “As long as you know.”

Saying so, she actively leaned towards Yang Kai and stretched out her jade white hand towards him.

Yang Kai held her hand in his and said with a smile, “What’s wrong? Are you planning on travelling to the Yellow Spring together with me?”

“The situation is what it is. If you have any other methods to get us out of this, you should use them now, otherwise, your women will become widows. In any case, I do not have the strength to fight anymore,” Xue Yue said indifferently, seemingly psychologically prepared for death.

Yang Kai nodded, stretched out his free hand, and wrapped it around Xue Yue’s waist.

Seeing his confident look, Xue Yue’s eyes could not help flashing.

She was truly prepared to die here, but from the looks of it, Yang Kai still had something up his sleeve, so she was looking forward to seeing what he would do next.

Yang Kai chuckled and was about to use his Space Force to flee together with Xue Yue when he suddenly remembered something.

Pausing for a moment, he summoned out a certain item.

It was an artifact that looked like a bracelet, but it appeared quite old and plain, with many mysterious runes carved onto its surface.

Staring at this bracelet, Yang Kai swept his eyes across the Illusionary Void Butterflies surrounding them and raised his brow as he poured his Saint Qi into it.

In the next instant, the bracelet radiated a faint light, and the runes began flowing it as a mysterious force propagated outwards!

An incredible scene happened next. When the strange energy fluctuations swept out, the Illusionary Void Butterflies that had been besieging the Blood Beasts without the slightest fear of death suddenly seemed to be paralyzed with terror and fell to the ground.

Look at the situation, it was obvious that this strange bracelet had an incredible suppressive effect on these Illusionary Void Butterflies.

“What is this?” Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai’s bracelet in surprise.

Yang Kai did not reply immediately and instead continued pouring his Saint Qi into the bracelet.

Another wave of energy surged out and more Illusionary Void Butterflies fell down. In a short time, half of the Illusionary Void Butterflies which had surrounded the pair in an impenetrable swarm had lost the ability to move while the rest had fled quite a distance in terror.

“This thing can actually be used like this,” Yang Kai also wore a look of surprise.

“What is it?” Xue Yue asked again, looking at the bracelet in amazement. Even using her Divine Sense, she was unable to see what grade this artifact was.

“The Insect Enslavement Bracelet!” Yang Kai replied casually, “Someone told me that it could restrain all kinds of Exotic Insects. I only tried using it as an experiment, but I didn’t expect it to be this effective.”

The Insect Enslavement Bracelet was an Emperor Artifact, the primary one of the Insect Emperor. Numerous kinds of brutal Exotic Insects were sealed inside. After Yang Kai killed the Insect Emperor, the Insect Enslavement Bracelet had become his trophy, but because his cultivation was too low, Yang Kai didn’t dare to refine it, so it had been gathering dust inside his Space Ring until now.

Yang Yan told him that this Insect Enslavement Bracelet was a powerful treasure that the Insect Emperor had relied upon to become famous in the past. The aura it emitted had a natural suppressive effect on Exotic Insects and from the current situation, it was also effective against these Illusionary Void Butterflies.

Although Yang Kai had not yet refined the Insect Enslavement Bracelet and could only slightly inspire its effects by pouring his Saint Qi into it, the Insect Enslavement Bracelet was still able to immobilize these Illusionary Void Butterflies!

The power of an Emperor Artifact was easy to see.

However, Yang Kai could not exert all of this bracelet’s power, limiting what he could do to the Illusionary Void Butterflies. They instinctively feared the aura coming from the Insect Enslavement Bracelet and lost the ability to act or desire to attack, but none of them had truly died.

The ground was now covered in a thick layer of Illusionary Void Butterflies, many of whom were struggling, but none who were able to fly. More Illusionary Void Butterflies had fled to a safe distance, but they did not disperse, instead just creating a large encirclement.

Yang Kai laughed when he saw this, waved his hand, and took back his battle-weary Blood Beast Army and Dragon Bone Sword. Holding up the Insect Enslavement Bracelet, Yang Kai continuously poured his Saint Qi into it while walking slowly outwards together with Xue Yue.

Wherever he went, the Illusionary Void Butterflies would retreat from, always keeping a certain distance with him. Once, when the distance was shortened, the Illusionary Void Butterflies fell from the sky, unable to fly and pursue them again until he moved a certain distance away.

Xue Yue wore a look of pleasant surprise. Although she was ready to die just now, no one would just accept death when there was a chance to live, especially after she was finally able to express herself to Yang Kai, giving her hope once again for a happier future.

In this manner, the pair travelled a couple hundred kilometres without encountering any difficulties; however, the swarm of Illusionary Void Butterflies never dissipated and continued to surround Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

“These annoying bugs,” Yang Kai frowned, realizing how difficult it was to deal with Ancient Exotic Insects.

“Why don’t we just kill them all?” Xue Yue suggested, in any case, with the Insect Enslavement Bracelet’s suppression, these Illusionary Void Butterflies now posed no threat to her and Yang Kai so it would only take them some time to slowly eliminate them all.

“Too troublesome,” Yang Kai shook his head and looked around before fixing his eyes on a certain spot and pointing, “Let’s head there!”

Saying so, he brought Xue Yue over towards a certain spot.

“Hey... what are you trying to do?” Xue Yue was shocked because up ahead of them was a giant Void Crack. This Void Crack was visible to the naked eye and more than a thousand metres long, exuding a terrifying aura.

And the direction Yang Kai was heading was straight towards this Void Crack, as if he had no intention of avoiding it.

“What’s wrong? Just now, with teary eyes, you wanted to go to the Yellow Spring together with me. Are you afraid now?” Yang Kai looked at her with a grin, “If you’re scared, you still have time to leave.”

Xue Yue bit her red lips and snapped, “Who’s afraid? Don’t try to test my intentions!”

Saying so, she pushed her Saint Qi and dragged Yang Kai over to the Void Crack.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, letting her do what she wanted.

The pair approached the crack at an amazingly fast speed, but as soon as they got close, Yang Kai could clearly feel Xue Yue’s tension rising; after all, there was a massive Void Crack in front of her and no one knew what would happen if they broke into it or even if they could find their way back once inside.

Just as they were about to enter the Void Crack, Xue Yue turned her head and glanced at Yang Kai, as if wanting to make a final inquiry.

Failing to read anything from Yang Kai’s face, however, she grit her teeth and dragged him into the crack.

A light flashed and the pair disappeared.

The Illusionary Void Butterflies trailing behind began circling the area, and after confirming that there was no more prey for them here, they slowly flew off.
