Yang Kai smiled lightly and nodded as he passed by.

The Barbarian Warrior stared at his back for a long time before retracting his gaze and laughing softly, “Interesting!”

Although he was not a Shaman, he had tempered his body to an extreme degree, and as the Guard Captain of King City, his strength was not weaker than that of a High-Rank Shaman Grandmaster. Compared to a Shaman Grandmaster, what he lacked was just Shamanic Spells that were used to bless his clansmen. If they had to fight, none of the Shaman Grandmasters here could be his opponent. However, this extremely scrawny Shaman Grandmaster actually sparked his fighting spirit.

Those who could ignite a desire to fight were powerful opponents who could not be one-sidedly crushed!

This was evident when Yang Kai actually looked into his eyes calmly. Although there was no blessing of a Shamanic Spell in his stare, it was the same moment when his fighting spirit burst forth. It was impossible for any Shaman Grandmaster to withstand this kind of pressure, but Yang Kai did it without any difficulty.

[What an interesting Shaman Grandmaster. His physique looks weak and small, but there is unimaginable power hidden inside of it. That Shaman Tu should thank me, if not for my timely appearance, he wouldn’t have been able to avoid a great public humiliation…]

…..

Inside the main hall, a man whose aura was as deep as the sea stood there quietly, hands behind his back, waiting silently for everyone’s arrival. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Even after the hundred Shamans entered the hall, it was some time before this man turned around, his brow furrowed, seemingly worried about something.

He lifted his head to look at the crowd, and introduced himself loudly, “This King is Shaman Dang, the sixth Shaman King of the South Barbarian Clan. Some of you may know me already, some may have only heard of me, while others have no idea who I am, but it doesn’t matter, because starting today, we will often need to meet each other.”

“Greetings, Sir Shaman King!” Everyone placed a fist over their chest and bowed in salute.

Yang Kai was there too, his eyes flickering slightly. The sixth Shaman King, in other words, among the Shaman Kings of the South Barbarian Clan, this man was ranked sixth in terms of strength. Furthermore, it was unknown how many Shaman Kings were under him.

Yang Kai only knew that the South Barbarian Clan lacked a Shaman Saint. There were only four Shaman Saints in the entire Ancient Barbarian Race, who each commanded the four largest Clans respectively. Among the South Barbarian Clan, the most powerful Shaman King was a High-Rank Shaman King, but Yang Kai did not know his name.

Most of his knowledge of the South Barbarian Clan was taught by the Village Chief, and as a Low-Rank Shaman Apprentice, the information that the Village Chief had was obviously limited.

“I believe everyone knows the reason for my summons. It’s because of the invasion of the Demon Race, which has already exterminated three clans!” Shaman Dang’s voice was deep and low, but it clearly reached everyone’s ears.

When he stated that the three Clans had been exterminated, the faces of the hundred Shaman Grandmasters turned solemn.

Each of these three Clans was not weaker than the South Barbarian Clan and were overseen by at least one High-Rank Shaman King and up to two hundred Shaman Grandmasters, with thousands to tens of thousand other Shamans, but they were still exterminated. In other words, if the South Barbarian Clan encountered this kind of enemy, their ending would be the same.

This matter was not only about the three destroyed Clans, but about the whole Ancient Barbarian Race.

“However, that news is already outdated!” Shaman Dang’s words seemed to raise thousands of ripples, and when the people looked at him bewildered, he continued, “During the few days that we took to gather, the Billowing Clan was also exterminated!”

“What?”

“Really?”

“Even the Billowing Clan was destroyed.”

“It is said that the First Shaman King of Billowing Clan was the most likely to break through to become the fifth Shaman Saint within a hundred years. What happened to him?”

All the Shaman Grandmasters exclaimed one after another, and their faces turned ugly; however, they could not be blamed, because the overall strength of the Billowing Clan was stronger than most of the Clans of the Ancient Barbarian Race, only inferior to the four top Clans.

The news of the extermination of the Billowing Clan came too suddenly, and it was natural for them to be appalled.

Shaman Dang continued in a deep voice, “The Billowing Clan had no survivors. Not a single one!”

The hall was so silent that even a needle could be heard if it fell to the ground. No survivors, which meant everyone died, including the powerful Shaman King who was the most likely to become a Shaman Saint.

War was near, and everyone’s confidence was shaken when they heard this news. Given that the Demon Race had destroyed the Billowing Clan, how horrifying could they be? Who could resist them?

Shaman Dang seemed to see through their thoughts, and pressed on, “The four Shaman Saints have started moving, and I believe their strength will be enough to cause significant damage to the Demon Race, but this war involves our entire Barbarian Race. Although the Shaman Saints are strong, we cannot place all the burden on them. All Barbarians must do their part, which is why King City urgently summoned all clansmen here.”

Everyone was relieved at the news that the Four Great Shaman Saints were taking action. Shaman Saints were the strongest existences in this world, and with their help, the invasion of the Demon Race could be restrained. However, Shaman Dang was right, this was a war involving the whole Barbarian Race. No one could avoid their responsibility. Although the Shaman Saints were powerful, in the end, there were only four of them.

“I believe that you might want to ask me what the Demon Race is, where they come from, and why they want to destroy our Barbarian Clans,” Shaman Dang swept his eyes across the audience, and continued in a deep voice, “This King wishes to tell you too, but he doesn’t know much about these things. Nevertheless, just remember that the Demon Race is the sworn enemy of our Barbarian Race, and there is no way for us to live under the same sky. As long as there is a single Barbarian still standing and drawing breath, the Demon Race will not be allowed to contaminate this land!”

The morale of the Shaman Grandmasters was greatly inspired by his words. They looked excited and were ready to fight to the death, as if they could not wait to fly to the battlefield, stain the blue sky bloody red, and use their lives to push back the invasion of the Demon Race.

Yang Kai observed them indifferently, thinking that the Ancient Barbarian Race was indeed simple-minded. There was not the slightest bewitchment in Shaman Dang’s words; they were just a simple declaration, but that was enough to resonate with these Shaman Grandmasters. If Shaman Dang had added some bewitchment to his words, perhaps it would have been even more effective.

“Sir, what do we do now?”

“Yes Sir, are we going to the battlefield now?”

“I can’t wait to see the power of the Demon Race.”

“Hahahaha, I hope the Demon Race won’t wet their pants when they see this Shaman!”

The group of Shaman Grandmasters started shouting and did not put the Demon Race that already destroyed four Clans in their eyes. Seeing this, Shaman Dang smiled lightly, “All of you will have the opportunity, and I hope you will remember what you said here today. However…” he suddenly turned solemn as he pressed on, “It is not the time yet. We have to wait for news from the Shaman Saints. Moreover, our South Barbarian Clan has not fully assembled yet. There are still many clansmen on their way here. If we are given more time, our South Barbarian Clan will definitely fare better; however, time does not wait for us. Your job now is simple. Help me organize the clansmen of the South Barbarian Clan. Each of you will recruit two to three thousand clansmen. Train them, and make them listen to your orders.”

There were hundreds of thousands of clansmen in the whole South Barbarian Clan.

Each Shaman Grandmaster had to recruit two to three thousand clansmen, which was just enough to use up all the people of the Clan; however, these clansmen were all from different villages, so trying to put them all together would inevitably lead to all kinds of conflicts. It would certainly take some time to adjust to each other, and this kind of matter had to be handled by a leader, which was the Shaman Grandmaster.

Yang Kai nodded lightly in agreement. It was not good for an organization to be a snake without a head. Two to three thousand people as a unit seemed to be an appropriate number, as it was neither too small nor too big, almost the limit that a Shaman Grandmaster could control.

There were about a thousand people under his lead now, so according to Shaman Dang, he would still have to recruit at least another thousand people. However, that was a simple task. All the clansmen would cooperate under the order of the Shaman King, and villagers without a powerful Shaman leader would definitely need to join a strong force. But this matter needed consensus from both sides. There were many Shaman Grandmasters gathered in King City now, so if he wanted to attract those scattered warriors to join him, he would need to show his capability first.

No one would want to follow an incapable Shaman Grandmaster.

Considering all this, Yang Kai swiftly came up with a plan.

Shaman Dang did not say much more as the main purpose of this meeting was to inform everyone of this task. Therefore, after announcing it, he gave a few words of advice before dismissing them.

All of a sudden, the hundred Shaman Grandmasters elbowed their way through and pushed themselves out of the hall. They obviously could not wait to recruit people under them as, once the war began, it would be safer to have more subordinates, so at this critical moment, no one was willing to lag behind others and wanted to use their own means to keep the rest here, so that they could pick the most powerful warriors for themselves first.

Only after everyone else left did Yang Kai walk steadily towards the exit.

“What’s your name?” Shaman Dang’s voice came from behind.

Yang Kai turned around, “Shaman Niu!” he answered, “I was born like this, but I am really from the South Barbarian Clan’s Blue South Village!”

Shaman Dang nodded, “It doesn’t matter if your body is small or big. You’re a Shaman Grandmaster nonetheless. If anyone doubts you next time, just tell them my name.”

Yang Kai was stunned, clueless as to why Shaman Dang concerned himself with this trivial matter, but he still replied with a nod, “Many thanks, Sir.”

“Go!” Shaman Dang waved his hand.

Then, Yang Kai walked out of the hall.

A moment later, the Guard Captain who stared at Yang Kai before came in and looked at Shaman Dang curiously.

Shaman Dang questioned, “What do you want to ask?”

The Guard Captain asked, “Sir, is there anything special about that man?”

He had obviously heard the conversation just now, so he did not understand why Sir Shaman King stopped Yang Kai intentionally to talk to him.

Shaman Dang pondered for a moment before replying, “Special! Of course he is very special! That’s a Shaman Grandmaster who is favoured by the Barbarian God.”

The Guard Captain frowned, “Isn’t anyone who can become a Shaman is favoured by the Barbarian God?”

Shaman Dang smiled lightly, “He is different. Before the winter last year, he was just an ordinary person, or even worse than an ordinary person.”

“What?” The Guard Captain was dumbfounded, “Sir, are you sure?”

A man, who was still an ordinary person last winter, managed to become a Shaman Grandmaster? How was that possible?

Shaman Dang replied, “When I was still a Shaman Grandmaster, I once guided a young man named Shaman Li in cultivation for a while, and that Shaman Li… was the previous Village Chief of Blue South Village.”
