“I apologize, I have been busy with the foreign enemies lately and haven’t had time to see you. Are you accustomed to living in the valley?” Bing Yun asked.

“Yes, I am…” Yang Kai kept nodding his head, “Ice Heart Valley has great people and beautiful scenery. There is nothing uncomfortable about this place.”

“That’s good,” Bing Yun smiled lightly before suddenly declaring solemnly, “But you won’t be staying long, I will personally send you out of here in two days.”

Startled, Yang Kai asked, “Is Senior planning to face the Seeking Passion Sect in a final decisive battle?”

Bing Yun gave a nod, “They are already right at our doorstep, and we, Ice Heart Valley, have no choice but to fight.”

“Is there any chance of winning?” Yang Kai questioned in a heavy tone.

Bing Yun shook her head, “No, but it won’t be easy for them to destroy my Ice Heart Valley. Yang Kai, as we speak about this matter, I still have a favour to ask.”

Yang Kai urged her solemnly, “Senior, ask away.”

Bing Yun sighed, “I established Ice Heart Valley thousands of years ago, but now that its safety is in jeopardy, I hope to preserve its foundation somehow. When I send you away, I hope you can bring some disciples with you and away from the Northern Territory. No matter where you send them, you must tell them not to be reckless and appear before our enemies as they are bound to be defeated. They mustn’t return to the Northern Territory until they are prepared. If they wish to take revenge, they must first be strong enough. If they’re not willing to take revenge… Then, just settle for a peaceful, steady life.”

Yang Kai’s heart sank as he listened, knowing that Bing Yun was telling him her last will. It seemed that she was determined to perish together with Ice Heart Valley.

“Those disciples will be led by Zi Yu. Yang Kai, you and Zi Yu are considered acquaintances, so I will leave them in your hands,” Bing Yun looked at Yang Kai with a solemn face.

Yang Kai frowned and asked pensively, “Senior, is the situation… that severe?”

Bing Yun shook her head, “There are a hundred thousand of them against only seven thousand of us. There is no chance Ice Heart Valley will emerge victoriously.”

Ji Yao, who was standing behind Bing Yun, suddenly spoke up, “Senior Brother Yang, is it possible for you to seek help from those in the Eastern Territory? We don’t need many, just two or three… “

Yang Kai shook his head in disagreement, “Their aid will be too slow to be of any help!”

Yang Kai knew who exactly Ji Yao was referring to.

It could only be the Great Divine Venerables in the Ancient Wild Lands. There was no need for Luan Feng or the other Divine Spirits to appear personally either as a few Monster Kings would be enough to completely flip the situation, but they were too far away in the Ancient Lands of the Eastern Territory.

Ice Heart Valley would be breached long before Yang Kai could return with help from the Ancient Wild Lands. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Moreover, they belonged to the Monster Race, so their appearance might anger the Great Emperors if they intervened rashly with the matters of Human Sects. Luan Feng did not even dare make a move when she accompanied Yang Kai to the Netherworld Sect, only killing Zhou Yong after he repeatedly provoked her.

Although those existences of the Ancient Wild Lands were powerful, there were many limits to the actions they could take when they left their own territory.

Ji Yao obviously knew this too and only asked that out of desperation; but after hearing Yang Kai’s answer, she sighed helplessly.

Yang Kai pondered, “Senior, I’ve thought about this issue for the past two days and concluded that the reason why Ice Heart Valley is at stake now is simply that the enemy has an Array Grandmaster on their side.”

Bing Yun nodded in agreement, “Yes, this Nanmen Da Jun is quite capable. The Sect Defending Array of Ice Heart Valley has already begun to show signs of weakening. He may even be able to break through the Spirit Array if we gave him another ten days to a half month.”

Yang Kai grinned broadly, “What if he didn’t have ten days or half a month?”

Startled, Bing Yun probed him, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai continued, “This is what I think. Didn’t the Seeking Passion Sect issue a Recruitment Order? Perhaps I can pretend to submit to the Seeking Passion Sect and infiltrate their ranks so I can find an opportunity to eliminate Nanmen Da Jun.”

“That won’t work!” Bing Yun was shocked, “I know you are proficient in the Dao of Space, but now there are numerous powerful enemies outside Ice Heart Valley, including many Emperor Realm Masters. If anything goes wrong, I’m afraid you will have no chance to escape. And, don’t forget, those top leaders of the Seeking Passion Sect must know what you look like. No. Absolutely not. This is Ice Heart Valley’s matter, how can I possibly allow you to take such risks?”

Yang Kai chuckled slightly and assured her, “Senior, don’t worry about the issue of appearance. As long as I do not meet Feng Xuan or Yao Zhuo in person, I believe the others will fail to recognize me.”

Bing Yun frowned slightly, “Did you cultivate some kind of special Secret Technique?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “No.”

Ji Yao suddenly interjected up, “Does Senior Brother mean to ask Martial Niece Tian He?”

Yang Kai looked at her with a smile, “Exactly.”

Ji Yao thought for a while before nodding, “Senior Brother’s plan might be feasible then.”

Bing Yun looked bewildered as she asked, “Tian He? That disciple who came back with you a few days ago? She is just a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator. What can she contribute in this situation?”

Ji Yao smiled, answering, “Honoured Master, although Martial Niece Tian He lacks in cultivation, she has a very profound skill.”

“What kind of skill?”

Ji Yao replied, “Her Disguise Technique is exceptional. Last time in Serenity City, I didn’t find any flaws even when she stood right in front of me. If Senior Brother Yang hadn’t noticed a slight flaw and warned me, I’m afraid this Disciple would have been deceived by her.”

Bing Yun was intrigued, “Does she have such ability?”

If even Ji Yao could not see through her disguise, other Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters would probably not be able to do so either. Such disguising ability was simply astonishing.

Yang Kai nodded, “With the help of Martial Niece Tian He, it will be unlikely that I will be recognized even if I walked into Seeking Passion Sect. As long as I infiltrate them and find a chance to kill or abduct Nanmen Da Jun, no one will be able to break through the valley’s defences.”

Bing Yun’s eyes lit up when she heard this, but her excitement quickly died down. Shaking her head as she smiled wryly, “It still wouldn’t work. Even if you killed Nanmen Da Jun, the outcome would be the same.”

“Why?” It was now Yang Kai’s and Ji Yao’s turn to be astonished.

Sighing, Bing Yun explained, “Although the Defending Array of Ice Heart Valley is powerful, it consumes too much when it is used at full strength. Even without Nanmen Da Jun, we won’t be able to hold on for more than two months. In two months, the array will fail regardless, so the outcome will not change.”

Yang Kai was instantly relieved, “If that’s the case, Senior doesn’t need to worry. I have some Source Crystals on me, enough to sustain Ice Heart Valley for a long time, and… two months is enough for me to make a trip back to the Eastern Territory to seek help.”

As long as he could buy some time, he could return to the Eastern Territory to bring out a few Monster Kings.

By then, whether the Seeking Passion Sect had a hundred thousand cultivators or two or three hundred thousand cultivators on their side, it would not be a problem.

“Who will you look for in the Eastern Territory?” Bing Yun asked strangely.

“Junior Sister Yao knows,” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Ji Yao darted her eyes towards Bing Yun and quietly sent her a Divine Sense transmission.

Thunderstruck, she asked Yang Kai in amazement, “Yang Kai, could you really move them?”

“For a trivial matter like this, they should be willing to help,” Yang Kai smiled confidently, and before Bing Yun could object, he pressed on, “Then, this matter is settled. Let’s not delay, I will go to Martial Niece Tian He now!”

He was the one who caused this mess for Ice Heart Valley in the first place, so he could not possibly stay out of it now. He had been racking his brains for the past few days for a way to resolve this catastrophe, and now, he had come up with a solution.

“Wait, Senior Brother Yang, count me in for this matter,” Ji Yao yelled quickly.

“You?” Yang Kai turned his head in shock, and waved his hand, “No, no, I can do this alone, and it’s more troublesome with an extra person.”

Ji Yao insisted, “This is a matter regarding Ice Heart Valley, how can I let an outsider take all the risk alone? I have to go with you.”

Before Yang Kai could refuse again, she sent him a Divine Sense transmission, “Senior Brother Yang, if you dare utter another objection, I will tell the Honoured Master that you have profaned me before.”

Yang Kai’s face froze as cold sweat instantly began dripping down his back. He quickly swallowed the words he wanted to say and changed his tone entirely, “The company of Junior Sister Yao would naturally be best, aha.. haha…”

Bing Yun obviously noticed his insincerity, and wondered what Ji Yao had said to him that changed his attitude so drastically.

But at this point, she could not object either as what Yang Kai said was true, if everything went well, Ice Heart Valley could avoid the fate of being destroyed. Bing Yun had to consider the fate of the seven thousand disciples of her Sect first and foremost.

“Since you insist on this, then ask Tian He to come here, I wish to see her Disguise Technique personally before I make a final decision.”

Ji Yao nodded enthusiastically, “I will ask Eldest Senior Sister to bring her over.”

After speaking, she took out the communication artifact and poured her Divine Sense into it.

Yang Kai also returned to his chair and sat down. He did not look pleased at all, and even the sweet tea that he sipped tasted bitter. He looked at Ji Yao quietly, only to find that she was completely ignoring him, as if the words she spoke before hadn’t come from her mouth.

Within a short time, An Ruo Yun was outside the hall, requesting for a meeting, with Shi Tian He by her side, entering soon after being given permission from Bing Yun.

After the necessary greetings, An Ruo Yun asked, “Honoured Master, what can I do for you?”

Bing Yun answered, “There’s nothing you need to do, I just want Tian He to do something.”

At her words, Shi Tian He hurriedly said, “Ancestral Founder, please give your order, this Disciple will do everything in her power.”

Bing Yun smiled in response, “Don’t be nervous. It’s just that I heard that your Disguise Technique is exceptional. I want to see if it is really that amazing.”

Shi Tian He answered respectfully, “It’s just some paltry tricks, I’m afraid it’s nothing in Ancestral Founder’s eyes.”

An Ruo Yun glared at her, and reprimanded, “Since Ancestral Founder wants to see it, just show it to her.”

“Yes!” Shi Tian He answered honestly, “Then this Disciple will not hesitate to show her inadequacies.”

Yang Kai addressed her, “Tian He, disguise my appearance.”

Shi Tian He looked at Bing Yun for permission, and seeing her nod in approval, she stood in front of Yang Kai and said softly, “Pardon me, Martial Uncle Yang.”

While speaking, she stretched out her hand and took out an assortment of items before placing them on the table next to Yang Kai. Everyone fixed their eyes on the items and found that these things were similar to mud and rouge, seemingly nothing special, possessing no obvious energy fluctuations either.

Shi Tian He fixed her eyes on Yang Kai’s face carefully, her face filled with concentration, taking a moment before she took a deep breath and began moving her hands in a fluid manner, picking up one material after another to smudge and smear across Yang Kai’s face while at the same time using some kind of ingenious technique to merge them together.
