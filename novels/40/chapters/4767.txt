The thought had only just crossed Yang Kai’s mind when he suddenly detected a stream of light speeding by overhead from where he was hiding. The aura coming from the stream of light belonged to a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.

His eyes immediately lit up at the sight. [That’s another set of Sixth-Order materials!]

With a flicker of his figure, Yang Kai immediately blocked the path of the other party.

Startled, the passing Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master quickly came to a halt and turned pale with shock when he caught a clear glimpse of Yang Kai’s face, “S-Senior Brother Yang!”

Before he could even finish his sentence, the sight of a fist rapidly growing larger filled his entire vision. He hastily pushed his World Force to retaliate, but it was already too late. Even though they were both in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, meeting Yang Kai alone was no different from a fish lying on a chopping block.

In just three breaths, the passing Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was knocked to the ground by Yang Kai and crashed hard into a forest below.

Yang Kai quickly descended and looked at the other party with a smile, “Junior Brother, your courage isn’t small!”

When he first saw that this person was acting alone, he thought that Lang Ya Paradise was using him as bait to lure him into a trap. However, there were no traces of any other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from Lang Ya Paradise up until now. It could be certain that this person was indeed acting alone; therefore, Yang Kai couldn’t help praising him. In this situation where all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise were in danger, which one of them did not move about in a large team? There was no denying that this person was bold indeed.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai frowned, “Junior Brother, why do you look so familiar? Moreover, your injuries…”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master looked like he was about to cry as he said, “Senior Brother Yang, we met each other just three days ago! You gave me these injuries!”

“Huh?” Yang Kai’s expression became strange, “Is that to say that you’ve been eliminated?”

“That’s right!” The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master nodded aggrievedly. Just why was his luck so terrible? He had already been eliminated from the training three days ago. Today, he was simply heading towards another Spirit Province for an errand. He was not participating in the training, so who could have expected that he would be captured by Yang Kai again? How did this make sense!?

Likewise, Yang Kai was a little speechless.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master cautiously said, “Senior Brother Yang, if there’s nothing else, then this Junior Brother will be leaving first.”

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly raised a hand to stop the other party.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master felt his heart clench at those words, and an ominous feeling suddenly flooded him, “How may I help you, Senior Brother Yang?”

Yang Kai observed the other party seriously, “I’m sorry, Junior Brother. It seems that my attacks were a little heavy-handed. The main reason is that I’m fighting alone, so I have to act a bit forceful in order to persist.”

“It’s okay. They are only flesh wounds; it’s nothing serious. I’ll be fine after recuperating for a few days.”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded. Changing the subject abruptly, he asked with ‘concern’, “Would you like another healing pill?”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master clutched at his Space Ring in panic, “Senior Brother Yang, I already bought one earlier...”

Yang Kai considered for a moment and generously replied, “I’ll give you half price for the second pill.”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was rendered speechless.

A short while later, Yang Kai patted the shoulder of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in front of him and earnestly advised the other party, “It’s not safe outside these days, so don’t run around for no reason. You should stay at home and focus on your recovery.”

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master looked absolutely depressed and answered weakly, “Many thanks for your concern, Senior Brother Yang. I’ll be leaving now…”

The wealth that he accumulated with great difficulty over the years had all been lost after encountering Yang Kai twice in just three days. Thus, he vowed that he would not reveal himself again until the training was over! If he met Yang Kai again, he wouldn’t be able to afford another healing pill even if it was at half-price!

He rushed into the sky after saying goodbye to Yang Kai, his tears scattering in the wind!

An hour later, in the sky above Menacing Earth Spirit Province, a group of six people swept past at a high speed while on patrol. All six of them were in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. The person leading the team was Gu Ling’er, who held high popularity among all Lang Ya Paradise disciples. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her team originally consisted of three Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, but they merged with a nearby team after receiving Senior Brother Le Mang’s order. That was why they currently had a total of six Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

The six of them were in charge of monitoring Menacing Earth Spirit Province and the void surrounding it. They hardly made any stops, their powerful Divine Senses spreading across every bit of ground. The slightest rustling of the wind could not escape their perception.

All of a sudden, the six of them turned to look in a certain direction at the same time. In that direction, a layer of ripples spread out in space, as though a pebble had been thrown into a calm lake. Immediately after that, a figure appeared out of nowhere.

Somebody in the team exclaimed in shock, “It’s Yang Kai! Yang Kai has appeared!”

“Hurry up and notify the others!”

“We found Yang Kai at Menacing Earth Spirit Province! Fellow Brothers in the vicinity, please send aid as soon as possible!”

The message was sent out instantly; then, under Gu Ling’er’s leadership, the six of them swiftly charged towards Yang Kai. Their World Force surged violently, giving him no chance to escape!

They initially thought that Yang Kai would flee, but who could have known that Yang Kai was only taken aback for a moment but chose to stand his ground. In fact, he even charged towards them with a look of joy, as though he was meeting a friend he had not seen in years. Therefore, they were rather stunned by the situation!

There was less than three kilometres between them, and their various Secret Techniques and Divine Abilities had long been prepared. As long as Yang Kai closed the distance a little more, then they could show him what a one-way trip with no return meant!

Yang Kai suddenly raised a hand, and his deep voice reverberated in the Void, “Near... Distant Horizon!”

The distance between them suddenly stretched out infinitely!

At the same time, Gu Ling’er noticed that something was wrong and shouted, “Attack!”

Numerous Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques burst out with blinding light, accompanied by a horrifying power that blasted towards Yang Kai. But in the next instant they all witnessed an incomprehensible scene. The Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques they blasted outward became as slow as a turtle’s movements, pressing forward little by little as though the void had solidified at this moment.

It would not have been shocking if that were all though. What astonished them even more was that Junior Brother Liu, who stood to the right of Gu Ling’er, suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai for some reason.

On the other hand, the others got further and further away from Yang Kai! Space had suddenly become chaotic, and they could not distinguish the difference between each other as a result.

Nevertheless, this disorder only lasted for a short moment before it was destroyed by the Divine Abilities they exploded together. The Void soon returned to normal, but when they looked up again, Yang Kai was already nowhere to be seen. He had appeared without warning and disappeared just as suddenly, like an elusive ghost.

“Junior Brother Liu is gone!” Somebody noticed an anomaly and exclaimed in shock.

Their team initially consisted of six people, but there were only five left now. Moreover, they saw Junior Brother Liu appearing in front of Yang Kai for some inexplicable reason only to be punched in the gut by the latter.

Their expressions were ugly, “Junior Brother Liu must have been kidnapped!”

On the Spirit Province where Gu Pan lived, the figures of Yang Kai and Junior Brother Liu suddenly emerged. Gongsun Ri Hua, who had been recuperating from his wounds, came out to investigate the situation when he sensed the commotion, but upon recognising the people who just arrived, he immediately turned around and closed the door behind him with a resolute bang. He avoided Yang Kai as though he was avoiding a great disaster!

Junior Brother Liu screamed, “Senior Brother Gongsun, save me!”

Yang Kai looked at Junior Brother Liu quietly, “Senior Brother Gongsun was eliminated a long time ago. I’m afraid he can’t save you!”

Junior Brother Liu had a look of despair on his face and reluctantly said, “Give me a healing pill.”

Yang Kai patted Junior Brother Liu on the shoulder, “A wise man will submit to the circumstances!”

The two teams in the vicinity of Menacing Earth Spirit Province hurriedly rushed over to provide support when they received the message, but by the time they arrived, they saw that Yang Kai had vanished out of sight. Junior Brother Liu had also vanished along with him. There was no need to wonder what was happening. The bastard surnamed Yang was undoubtedly hiding somewhere and coercing Junior Brother Liu into buying a healing pill at this moment. Hence, they all paid silent tribute to Junior Brother Liu!

A message of distress suddenly came from their Identity Tokens again. It was full of panic, “He’s here! He’s here at Wu’an Spirit Province! We have engaged in battle with him. Fellow Brothers in the vicinity, please come and provide aid as soon as possible! Ah! Senior Brother Hua is gone!”

Once again, they paid silent tribute to Senior Brother Hua!

Junior Brother Liu was still reeling from the shock of suffering such a huge loss when a figure abruptly appeared beside him. This was followed by Yang Kai’s reappearance.

Senior Brother Hua, who had been kidnapped to this place, resisted and struggled violently. Catching sight of Junior Brother Liu nearby, he became overjoyed and shouted, “Junior Brother Liu, please help me capture this thief!”

Junior Brother Liu looked extremely awkward as he said, “Senior Brother Hua, I’ve already been eliminated!”

Senior Brother Hua’s mouth fell open in shock, and he stood there blankly. Looking around, he saw that not a single teammate was around him.

Yang Kai cracked his fists and walked towards Senior Brother Hua with a savage grin, “Senior Brother Hua, is it? Who did you just say you wanted to capture?”

Senior Brother Hua quickly dispelled the World Force around him and did his best to squeeze out a harmless-looking smile, “Junior Brother Yang, you must have misheard. I have no intention to capture anybody. Rather, I’ve always wanted to obtain a healing pill from Void Land...”

Inside the building, the Gongsun siblings rolled their eyes in unison. Meanwhile, Gu Pan stifled her laughter.

When Senior Brother Hua finished buying the healing pill, Yang Kai vanished once more. Senior Brother Hua and Junior Brother Liu looked at each other and choked on their tears.

Back at Menacing Earth Spirit Province, the two teams that came to provide support soon left. They had their own sites to monitor, so they could not remain for long. However, Gu Ling’er’s team sent out another distress signal as soon as the reinforcements left. By the time they arrived at the scene again, there was already one less person on Gu Ling’er’s team.

For the next half day, the entire Lang Ya Paradise was thrown into chaos. Yang Kai’s figure was extremely elusive, and somebody would suffer a tragic fate every time he appeared.

The plan that Eldest Senior Brother Le Mang came up with previously could not be said to be wrong. Since Yang Kai was so strong that three or four Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters joining forces could not be his opponent, it was only natural that they had to merge their teams together. The truth was this plan had already shown some effect. At the very least, Yang Kai was not as bold as before. Furthermore, the teams that encountered him were no longer completely wiped out all at once.

Be that as it may, Yang Kai simply became more cunning. He did not confront them directly and turned extremely elusive instead. It was almost as though he had countless Soul Clones. One moment he was there, the next moment he was somewhere else. What’s more, every time he appeared, he would not leave empty-handed.

One after another, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were captured. When the news spread, all the teams were filled with a sense of terror. The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise never imagined that a single person could toy with them so easily. They had always heard about the mysteriousness and unpredictability of the Dao of Space, but it was not until today that they witnessed it for themselves. Therefore, they couldn’t help but admire Yang Kai’s ability to utilise Space Principles so freely.

Gu Ling’er led the remaining two people in her team and hurriedly escaped in the direction of the nearest Spirit Province.

When Yang Kai reappeared at Menacing Earth Spirit Province just before, he had captured another of their team members. With only the three of them left, how could they be Yang Kai’s opponent?
