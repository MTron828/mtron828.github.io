Chapter 1726, World Principle Rejection

“You were struck by lightning, Old Qian?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“En,” Qian Tong nodded, “Although I did not suffer much harm, the power of Heavenly Lightning is still not to be underestimated.”

Fei Zhi Tu’s jaw dropped as he called out in alarm, “I thought you were cultivating some kind of profound Secret Technique that triggered that lightning strike! So it was actually because of this?”

“What nonsense Secret Technique!?” Qian Tong didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “You know all of the Secret Techniques our Shadow Moon Hall possesses. Which one can possible cause Heavenly Lightning? This old master has no time to cultivate any Secret Techniques now anyways, all my focus is on consolidating my realm.”

“What about the Earth-Fire last time?” Dong Xuan’er asked from the side.

“What Earth-Fire?” Fei Zhi Tu asked in astonishment.

Dong Xuan’er blinked her big eyes and explained, “Two months ago, a terrifying Earth-Fire suddenly appeared in Honoured Master’s retreat and burned it to the ground.”

“Such a thing happened?” Fei Zhi Tu was surprised.

“That was also a result of this old master being rejected by Shadowed Star’s World Principles!” Qian Tong grumbled in annoyance, “Since this old master returned to Shadowed Star, he has encountered this kind of thing more than once. Although they have all been resolved by this old master, never causing any real damage, I also have no way to concentrate on cultivating. Not only that, when this old master flies, powerful Astral Winds sometimes emerge from The Void and hammer my Knowledge Sea, draining my Spiritual Energy. This old master no longer dares to fly too high or for too long for fear of the consequences!”

“Heavenly Lightning, Earth-Fire, Astral Wind...” Yang Kai muttered aloud, “Old Qian, it seems that life has been hard for you!”

Hearing Yang Kai’s teasing, Qian Tong felt both aggrieved and helpless.

Living constantly on edge was extremely uncomfortable. Fortunately, Qian Tong had not entered secluded retreat these days. If he was disturbed while in deep meditation, it would very likely lead to a dissonance in his cultivation. Once that happened, it would be difficult for him to emerge unscathed despite already reaching the Origin King Realm.

“How could this be possible!” Fei Zhi Tu had an incredulous expression on his face as his eyes flashed with surprise, “This City Lord has lived for hundreds of years but this is the first time I have ever heard of anything like this.”

“It is a first for this old master as well,” Qian Tong sighed heavily before he directed an expectant look towards Yang Kai, “Yang Kai, you are now Star Master of Shadowed Star, can you figure out a way to remedy this old master’s situation?”

Qian Tong was truly quite troubled not knowing when something like Heavenly Lightning or Earth-Fire would befall him, making it impossible to enter retreat. Now all he could hope for was that Yang Kai had a solution.

But to his great disappointment, Yang Kai could only slowly shake his head, “While I can communicate with the World Principles of Shadowed Star somewhat, it is still impossible for me to alter them in any way.”

Hearing this, Qian Tong released another sigh.

The hall went silent for a while as the expressions of everyone present became heavy.

Shadow Moon Hall now possessed the only Origin King on Shadowed Star, which was no doubt a glorious achievement, but with Qian Tong now being rejected by the World Principles, it was terrible news.

After a while, Qian Tong suddenly said, “It seems that the only way now is for this old master to leave.”

“Old Ghost Qian, are you planning to leave Shadowed Star?” Fei Zhi Tu was shocked.

Wei Gu Chang and Dong Xuan’er also looked at Qian Tong with dismay, seemingly wanting to say something to dissuade him, but uncertain where to start from.

“If this old master doesn’t leave, he will face troubles for the rest of his life and will be unable to cultivate again,” Qian Tong smiled lightly, “This old master finally managed to reach the Origin King Realm, so he does not want to remain stuck here forever. This old master still wants to reach greater heights and see broader horizons!”

“At your age, you still haven’t outgrown such ambitions?” Fei Zhi Tu smiled wryly.

“Old Fei, are you willing to remain in the Origin Returning Realm for the rest of your life?” Qian Tong asked back.

“Impossible!” Fei Zhi Tu snorted, “If not for this City Lord’s realm falling last time, he would have left Shadowed Star together with you. Whether this City Lord can touch the mysteries of the Origin King Realm or not, he must at least try.”

“En, people seek greater heights just as water flows to lower places!”

“Since you’ve already decided, there’s nothing more to say. You need not worry about Shadow Moon Hall, I will take care of it,” Fei Zhi Tu said sternly.

“Yang Kai, if this old master wants to leave this place, he must rely on your strength!” Qian Tong looked at Yang Kai.

“Naturally, that’s not a problem,” Yang Kai smiled slightly, “Actually, I was just about to implement a plan that aligns quite well with Old Qian’s intentions.”

“Oh, what plan?” Qian Tong heard this and his eyes suddenly brightened.

“I am going to construct a Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array!”

“You mean an Ultra-Long Distance Space Array that can connect one Cultivation Star to another?” Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exclaimed together, looking at Yang Kai with extreme shock.

Yang Kai nodded, “Shadowed Star has been closed off from the Star Field for long enough. It’s time we were re-connected with the broader world. If this can be achieved, after a Shadowed Star cultivator reaches the peak of the Origin Realm, they can freely leave to explore the mysteries of the Origin King Realm.”

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu remained silent for a long time, but their eyes were wide with shock.

After a long while, Qian Tong asked nervously, “Can this really be achieved?”

“We’ll have to try to find out,” Yang Kai chuckled, “At the very least, I don’t think there will be a problem arranging an appropriate Space Array.”

“What if masters from other Cultivation Stars try to invade Shadowed Star via the Space Arrays you arrange? Wouldn’t that pose a serious problem?” Qian Tong showed a trace of worry.

“Haha, you don’t have to concern yourself about that,” Fei Zhi Tu laughed, taking out a few tokens with the character “High” on them from his Space Ring and explaining. “Without one of these, it is impossible to use the Space Arrays arranged by Yang Kai.”

“What is this?” Qian Tong was puzzled.

“A Transmission Token!” Fei Zhi Tu immediately explained, and after Qian Tong understood the purpose of these Transmission Tokens, he could not help nodding thoughtfully, “Yang Kai, it seems like you’ve been planning this for some time now.”

“Of course! Arranging Space Arrays across Shadowed Star was simply a way of practising for this,” Yang Kai smiled.

His ultimate goal was to connect Shadowed Star with the Star Field! This was not just a whim, but something Yang Kai had been thinking about for some time now.

Currently, it took far too long to reach the populated regions of the Star Field from Shadowed Star, but if a Cross-Cultivation-Star Space Array were available, this problem would cease to exist.

In the current High Heaven Sect, there was more than one peak Third-Order Origin Returning Realm master, and as Sect Master, Yang Kai had to make plans for the future. Even he himself was a Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator and urgently needed to leave Shadowed Star to prepare to break through to the Origin King Realm.

What’s more, arranging Space Arrays allowed Yang Kai to cultivate his Space Force.

These days, he found that his comprehension of the Dao of Space had become more profound.

Naturally, Yang Kai was not about to abandon such a beneficial project. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Great! This old master can rest assured knowing you’ve thought this matter out so thoroughly. You becoming Star Master is a true blessing to Shadowed Star!” Qian Tong laughed.

“Then do you want to leave with me now or wait until I finish setting up the Space Array before departing?” Yang Kai asked.

Qian Tong thought about it for a while before saying, “This old master will remain on Shadowed Star for a while and leave after you’ve finished setting up the Space Array. There are still some things to deal with in Shadow Moon Hall after all.”

“En, look forward to good news soon,” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Finished with his business, Yang Kai did not remain in Heavenly Fate City for a long time and instead returned directly to High Heaven Sect.

After summoning Elders of the Sect, Yang Kai informed them about his next plan, causing Ye Xi Yun, Yang Xiu Zhu, and all the others to excitedly agree.

Needless to say, Ye Xi Yun was the one who most hoped to break through to the Origin King Realm on Shadowed Star. Last time, she had chosen to remain in High Heaven Sect to take care of Yang Yan, causing her to miss such an opportunity.

If Yang Kai could really set up Space Arrays on other Cultivation Stars though, she would be able to free herself from the shackles of Shadowed Star any time she wanted.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others also held similar mindsets. Last time, they had failed to break through after surviving the Blood Prison Trial, but that did not mean they did not still have a chance. All of them intended to strive for a breakthrough, and even if they failed, they would not regret trying.

“Since everyone agrees, this Sect Master will implement his plan,” Yang Kai grinned and looked around, “But before I begin, I need you to help me gather some supplies!”

“What supplies?” Ye Xi Yun asked.

“Space Spirit Crystals!” Yang Kai’s expression became solemn, “The most critical material for arranging Space Arrays is Space Spirit Crystal! Depending on the transmission distance between two Space Arrays, the number of Space Spirit Crystals required also varies, and for Cross-Cultivation Star Space Arrays, the more Space Spirit Crystals, the better!”

“Understood. I’ll handle it!” Ye Xi Yun nodded.

Now that High Heaven Sect influence had spread across all of Shadowed Star, it was not an issue for it to collect materials. The only question now was how many Space Spirit Crystals High Heaven Sect could purchase.

After all, Space Spirit Crystals were rare, and even if some were found occasionally, it would almost always quickly be used to refine Space Rings.

Yang Kai had a large amount of Space Spirit Crystal before which he collected from the lode under Dragon Cave Mountain, but after cultivating his Space Force with it for so long, he had used all his reserves up.

During these past few months, the Space Spirit Crystals Yang Kai had used to arrange Space Arrays on Shadowed Star had been sourced from the major Sects and cities he had visited.

“Three months, in three months I will leave Shadowed Star! I hope you can help me raise enough Space Spirit Crystal by then!”

“Yes!” The Elders nodded before quickly scattering, intending to contact the various forces on Shadowed Star to begin this mass purchase.

Yang Kai believed that after three months, a big harvest should be waiting for him.

While the Elders of High Heaven Sect bustled about, Yang Kai now found himself with some idle time. After spending a few days accompanying his parents and brothers, he then took Su Yan and Xia Ning Chang out to wander around Shadowed Star.

Yang Kai didn’t know when he would next have free time, so he naturally hoped to accompany his two Senior Sisters for the next three months and enjoy their company.

To Yang Kai, this was a simple but treasured luxury.
