“Hmph! This is the result of trash acting arrogant in front of this Old Master!” After Gao Shan’s move hit its mark, he snorted loudly as he folded his arm behind his back, assuming a victory pose.

“It was just a young man who had only cultivated for a few years and thought he could stand against these Old Masters. Such wanton overconfidence!” Liu Shui sneered.

“Is that it?” The voice of Luo Yuan suddenly came out from the centre of the chaotic swirl of energy, followed by a burst of radiance that scattered the halo of light in the next instant.

Luo Yuan reappeared in front of everyone, a layer of Source Qi covering his body that was so dazzling it almost blinded Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

Not only was Luo Yuan unharmed, but even the round-faced woman who had been standing behind him was not affected at all. However, after being attacked like this, the round-faced woman seemed quite annoyed and she frowned deeply towards Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

“This, this, this...” Gao Shan could not help taking a few steps back, looking at Luo Yuan like he had seen a ghost, unable to believe what he saw.

“How can this be?” Liu Shui exclaimed in shock. He was clear just how powerful Gao Shan’s move was, so even if Luo Yuan was a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator as well, it should have been impossible to take it directly unscathed. But the truth was shown in front of his eyes and he was stupefied by it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I was still worrying that I couldn’t find a good opponent!” Luo Yuan grinned fiercely, his expression causing all who saw it to shudder, “Since you old dogs have come to me, I have no need to hold back...”

He licked his lips while speaking, as if he suddenly saw a delicious dish after starving for a long time.

His look nearly frightened Gao Shan and Liu Shui to death.

As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Yuan gradually raised his hand and a vigorous Source Qi started pulsing from his body, making a strange noise like waves crashing against rock.

“Stop!” A gentle voice interfered at the crucial moment.

Luo Yuan frowned and turned to the direction of the sound. Realizing it was from Qin Yu, he asked with a cold face, “What is it now?”

Previously he was interrupted by Qin Yu when he was about to act against Yang Kai, and now when he was about to fight Gao Shan and Liu Shui, Qin Yu interrupted him again. If it weren’t for the fact that she was the host here where he was staying, Luo Yuan would not have paid any attention to her.

“What do you want to do?” Qin Yu looked coldly at Luo Yuan and questioned with her teeth gritted.

“Isn’t it obvious?” Luo Yuan answered, “Can’t you tell what I was about to do?”

“I can!” Qin Yu did not fear Luo Yuan despite the differences in their strength and she continued to glare at him with her beautiful eyes, “It is exactly because I can tell that I have no choice but to stop you.”

“What do you mean? Speak clearly!” Luo Yuan scowled.

“Do you intend to destroy my Qin Residence?” Qin Yu asked.

“No, I don’t.” Luo Yuan replied seriously.

“Then do it somewhere else!” Qin Yu snorted, “If all of you don’t want to sleep on the street tonight, find another place to fight!”

“Ah...” Luo Yuan pondered for a moment before nodding, “Makes sense!”

The disciples of Eight Paths Sect were staying in the Qin Residence, so if the Qin Residence was really levelled, everyone from Eight Paths Sect would have nowhere to stay and their reputation would plummet for numerous reasons.

Looking up at Gao Shan and Liu Shui, Luo Yuan shouted, “Two old dogs, follow me!”

After that, his figure flickered and he rushed out of the city. When he left, he flew right over Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s heads, a naked provocation.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui could never tolerate a Junior acting so haughty before them, so they immediately turned to give chase.

In the blink of an eye, three Third-Order Dao Source Realm Masters disappeared from everyone’s vision.

“Ai...” The round-faced woman who had stood behind Luo Yuan all this time unexpectedly sighed and looked sorrowful.

From beginning to end, Luo Yuan had never turned his eyes to her or paid any attention to her at all, making her feel quite sad. Gritting her teeth, she turned to glare at Yang Kai and blamed him, “It’s all your fault!”

“Why are you blaming me?” Yang Kai grinned.

“If not for your deceitful lies, Senior Brother Luo would not have left!” The round-faced woman pouted, revealing a cute and playful face.

“Nonsense! In fact, you should be thanking me,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Why should I?” The round-faced woman stared at Yang Kai from the corner of her eyes and mocked, “I don’t see a reason for me to thank you.”

Yang Kai answered with full confidence, “Of course there is. If I did not create troubles, you wouldn’t have been able to see your Senior Brother Luo’s care for you.”

“Senior Brother Luo’s care for me?” The round-faced woman raised her brow and her pretty face blushed before she stomped her foot angrily, “Don’t be ridiculous, Senior Brother Luo only cares... he only cares about pursuing the Martial Dao. He would never care about me...” After a pause, she asked again with hope, “Can you tell me? How did Senior Brother Luo show he cared about... me?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Qin Yu interjected with a faint smile, “Young Lady, I’m afraid you were blinded by the situation because you were too close to it. When Protector Gao Shan struck just now, were you injured in the slightest?”

“No!” The round-faced woman shook her head.

“Then who was it who protected you?” Qin Yu questioned again.

Realization dawned on the round-faced woman and her beautiful eyes lit up as her originally sorrowful expression turned energetic, as if she had been gifted some precious treasure, causing her to smile brightly.

Qin Yu continued, “If your Senior Brother Luo didn’t care about you, you would be seriously wounded now.”

“He... He just... just did it out of convenience, he did not care about me,” The round-faced woman lowered her head, blushing and anxious. Even though she denied it with her words, her demure face had betrayed her thoughts as she looked like she was drunk on honey.

“However... aren’t you worried about your Senior Brother Luo? Although Gao Shan and Liu Shui have some problems... up here, they are still not easy to handle,” Yang Kai smiled while tapping on his own head.

The round-faced woman replied, “There’s nothing to be worried about. Those two men would definitely be crying for their mothers soon enough!”

She had absolute confidence in Luo Yuan.

At this point, she turned her gaze at Yang Kai and asked with a smile, “You still have time to talk about all these things? Better worry about yourself first.”

“What should I be worried about?” Yang Kai sneered and looked around, “It’s just a gathering of trash!”

“What did you say!?”

“Little brat, you’re too full of yourself, I have to teach you a harsh life lesson.”

“Whose family did this boy come from? What a foul mouth he has! Haven’t your parents taught you any manners?”

His surrounding cultivators started to yell at him.

The three strongest cultivators had left them, so the remaining people naturally had no more concerns, all of them staring covetously at the Myriads Sword in Yang Kai’s hand as they plotted and schemed to acquire it.

“Heh heh heh...” An elderly man suddenly laughed as he looked down at Yang Kai kindly, “Little brother, where did you get your sword from?”

“You mean this?” Yang Kai swung the Myriads Sword across his chest and pointed it, releasing a sword light from its blade as he smiled and said, “I picked it up on the road.”

“Then it must be the one that this Old Master lost a few days ago, no wonder it looked so familiar. Little brother, please return it to me!” The elderly man continued hurriedly.

The group of cultivators around looked at the elderly man dumbfounded, thinking to themselves, [This is too shameless. Even if you wanted to rob treasures, you should find a better excuse. The excuse that you just gave was so... ridiculous! Even fools won’t fall for it!]

“I was the one who picked it up so it’s mine now, why should I give it to you?” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he stored the Myriads Sword directly back into his body.

Seeing this scene, the elderly man gulped and asked eagerly, “Little brother, as long as you are willing to give this Old Master his sword back, this Old Master will guarantee you prosperity and wealth for the rest of your life. You may not know, but this Old Master is the Evil Moon Valley’s Vice Valley Master, Qu Huai Ren, and he is always faithful to his word.”

Yang Kai stared at him and said, “I don’t believe you.”

“If you don’t believe me, you can ask them. They can testify for this Old Master,” The elderly man pointed at his surrounding cultivators anxiously.

All the cultivators around sneered when they heard it, and put on a face of ‘this is none of my business’.

“See, they don’t believe you either,” Yang Kai derided, “You must be trying to cheat me out of my treasure!”

Qu Huai Ren’s eyes flashed a fierce light as he snorted coldly, “Fine, you’ve forced this Old Master to get rough with you. Don’t blame this Old Master for acting ruthless now.”

Saying so, he moved in a flash with a ruthless look, like a great peng swooping down from above as he charged towards Yang Kai with his one hand stretching into a claw.

“What... What do you want to do!?” Yang Kai looked flustered and kept stepping back.

“Heh heh heh... little brat, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself for having such bad luck! You were just digging your own grave showing off your treasure with just a trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation! In your next life, if you’re lucky enough to be reborn as a human, remember this, an ordinary man is innocent but his treasures make him guilty!” Qu Huai Ren spoke earnestly but he did not slow his movements, pressing towards Yang Kai while releasing undisguised killing intent.

“I... I’ll fight you!” Yang Kai shouted fiercely, releasing a roar that reverberated like thunder, causing the ears of those present to ring. Initially, when the cultivators around saw the elderly man making a move, their expression changed and some of them even pushed their own Source Qi, seemingly planning to join the fray.

However, everyone could not help but be stunned at Yang Kai’s roar.

A brilliance flashed across the ground where Yang Kai stood on, and the Myriads Sword Emperor Artifact was summoned out by him again. At that moment, he waved his sword around frantically, as if frightened silly by Qu Huai Ren’s attack and unable to release his strength properly.

“Give it to me!” Qu Huai Ren was overjoyed when he saw the Myriads Sword and stretched out his arm to snatch it, excitement covering his face as if he had already seen himself ruling the world with the treasure he just obtained.

*Chi... *

*Pu... *

Five severed fingers flew out in the next instant as blood splattered everywhere.

“Uh...” Qu Huai Ren was standing not far in front of Yang Kai, frozen on the spot. Staring at Yang Kai dumbstruck, as if he had not fully recovered from his shock, he could only feel a coolness on his hand and chest, as well as a sharp, rising pain.

The next moment, he saw the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth curve upwards, showing a mocking grin. This grin made him shiver involuntarily as he vaguely felt something was not right.
