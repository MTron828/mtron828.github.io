The ladies, whether it was Su Yan, Xia Ning Chang, Xue Yue or Ji Yao, had good aptitudes; otherwise, they would not have been able to cultivate to the Emperor Realm in such a short time while still in the Star Boundary. Especially Su Yan, who bore the Ancestral Ice Phoenix Source and possessed the Ice Crystal Jade Body. She had the most outstanding aptitude among all of them.

Their time spent on cultivation was not a lot, but there were never insufficient resources when they were in the Star Boundary, allowing them to build upon solid foundations.

They were restricted by the World Bottle of the Star Boundary and could not be recognized by the World’s Will, so they could not condense their own Dao Seal. Nevertheless, it was no longer the case when they leapt out of the Star Boundary and entered the Outer Universe. Here, it became a simple matter for them to condense their Dao Seals.

Due to their firm foundations, their Dao Seals were also extremely stable.

Zhu Jiu Yin was right. It would not be a problem for them to refine Fifth-Order Elements. As for Yu Ru Meng, she was the Demon Saint of the Demon Race, so she already had her own Dao Seal and had begun to refine Sixth-Order materials like the Great Emperors.

Yang Kai would be pleased enough if the common disciples in Void Land could refine Fifth-Order materials, but since they were his wives, he definitely wanted the absolute best for them.

As such, he took out the remaining Divine Dao Water and distributed it to them.

It was given to him by Zhu Jiu Yin in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Zhu Jiu Yin had lived in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary for many years and possessed a lot of valuable treasures. As a Divine Spirit though, the Divine Dao Water was completely useless to her, so she generously gave it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had used some for himself and traded a couple drops away, but there was still about half of it left. Even though each one of them could only obtain three or four drops now, it was enough to further stabilize their Dao Seals.

One must first sharpen his ax before chopping wood. Ever since Yang Kai left the Star Boundary, he had realized the importance of a Dao Seal to cultivators. It could be said that the future achievements of a cultivator, and even one’s chances of successfully entering the Open Heaven Realm were tied directly to their Dao Seal.

The firmer the Dao Seal, the higher the Order of Elements they could condense, while the chances of failure during the final breakthrough would be smaller too.

Yang Kai and Yu Ru Meng stood guard, while the others entered retreat to refine the Divine Dao Water.

“Does Husband want them to condense Sixth-Order Elements?” Yu Ru Meng guessed Yang Kai’s plan and secretly asked via Divine Sense. At the moment, her clothes are a little untidy, her hair was dishevelled, and her cheeks were still slightly flushed, giving her an extremely seductive air.

Yang Kai grabbed her hand and played with it softly as he whispered, “Entering the Open Heaven Realm is not the end of the Martial Dao. The difference between just one Order is enormous, so if they can have a higher starting point, it will save them many years of cultivation and also allow them to have a more promising future. So, I’ll try to provide them with the best possible starting point.”

“En!” Yu Ru Meng nodded lightly. With a slight tilt, she fell into Yang Kai’s arms, gently stroked the stubble on his chin, and stated in distress, “My Husband has been running around all over the world these past few years. It must have been difficult.”

Although it was her first time hearing about the Divine Dao Water and she had never seen it before, how could anything that could improve a cultivator’s Dao Seal be common? It was definitely a treasure that most cultivators could only dream of.

Everyone wanted such a treasure, so to obtain it, Yang Kai must have gone through plenty of hardships and only succeeded after much hard work.

Yang Kai lowered his head, traced his finger over her ruby red lips, and asked with a playful smile, “Indeed. How do you intend to compensate your hard-working Husband, Ru Meng?”

Yu Ru Meng glanced up at him shyly, “They are refining the Divine Dao Water. Don’t make trouble. It’s bad to disturb them.”

After a pause, she continued, “It’s not often that you return home. When they’re done, you should go and see Luo’er.”

Yang Kai nodded, “How has Luo’er been doing recently?”

His wives were all here, except for Shan Qing Luo. He could not help it, because when he brought her to Void Land from the Star Boundary, Zhu Jiu Yin instantly felt a familial aura from Shan Qing Luo and immediately took her away. Yang Kai could not stop this, and did not intend to either; after all, this was a good opportunity for Shan Qing Luo too, and Yang Kai believed that with Zhu Jiu Yin’s teaching, Shan Qing Luo would definitely have great achievements in the future.

Yu Ru Meng answered, “I don’t know. Luo’er has been following Senior Zhu Jiu Yin, and hasn’t shown up lately. However, I heard from Su Yan that when they met Luo’er last time, she looked well.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll make time to see Zhu Jiu Yin then.”

The several women did not take too long, only about three days to refine the Divine Dao Water. They opened their eyes one after another, and Yang Kai checked their Dao Seals one by one. After confirming that their Dao Seals were indeed stable enough to support Sixth-Order Elements, he was relieved. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If he did not have the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill with him, he may not be bold enough to encourage his wives to condense Sixth-Order Powers; after all, having the capability to condense such Element Powers was completely different from having the courage to do so. The risks of breaking through directly to the Sixth-Order rather than the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm were orders of magnitude different.

However, Yang Kai did have the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills, which could secure their breakthrough in the future.

After ordering them to find Bian Yu Qing to request Sixth-Order materials, Yang Kai departed to Zhu Jiu Yin’s residence.

Other than meeting Shan Qing Luo, he also wanted to know how much of Zhu Jiu Yin’s strength had been restored. She was a Divine Spirit born and raised in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. After escaping the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, she had to adapt to the World Principles of the 3,000 Worlds in order to regain her peak strength.

It had been several years since she left the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, so in theory, she should have fully recovered.

Zhu Jiu Yin lived in the grandest palace complex which occupied an entire Spirit Peak. There were no outsiders here, only her and Shan Qing Luo.

Yang Kai came to the foot of the mountain, climbed the stairs, and soon reached in front of the palace. He adjusted his clothes as he cleared his throat before cupping his fist, “Senior, Junior Yang Kai is here to visit you.”

The sound echoed back and forth through the mountain peaks.

Zhu Jiu Yin’s voice immediately reached Yang Kai’s ear, “Brat, you’re not dead yet?”

Yang Kai was speechless, “Why did you say so, Senior? You are my Protector. Why do you wish for me to die?”

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted coldly, “It’s true that I’m your Protector, but I can only keep you safe in this small place. Since you like to wander around, what does it have to do to me if you get yourself killed outside?”

In fact, she could not wait for Yang Kai to die in a ditch somewhere outside. If he did, she did not have to guard this place anymore, and could go wherever she pleased with Shan Qing Luo.

Yang Kai was annoyed, and if not for the vast gap in their strength, he would have charged inside to teach her a lesson. Forcing down his grievances, he swiftly changed the subject, “Senior, please show yourself.”

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted, “Just say what you want to say and don’t waste our time. This Queen is really busy and doesn’t have the attention to spare to see you.”

Yang Kai wanted to ask her what she was busy with, but on second thought, since Shan Qing Luo was with her, she probably was doing something related to Shan Qing Luo. Irritated but still willing to compromise, Yang Kai simply asked, “Since Senior has been away from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary for a few years, may this Junior ask how much of your strength had been restored? Do you need any assistance from me?”

Zhu Jiu Yin sneered, “How can you help me? I don’t need your help. If there’s nothing else, go back and don’t bother this Queen.”

Yang Kai ground his teeth. He really wanted to grab this woman out and bite her. He proceeded with a low voice, “It’s fine if Senior doesn’t want to show herself, but I want to see Luo’er.”

“Luo’er is busy too. She’s not free. Shoo shoo, go away!”

Yang Kai widened his eyes and burst out, “Senior, this is my Void Land. Not to mention, I am the Master here, Luo’er is my Wife. I just want to see her. Why won’t you allow me?”

“Bite me!” Zhu Jiu Yin sneered.

[I really do want to bite you to death!] Anger filled Yang Kai’s heart so he steeled himself and strode forward. [I was being polite just now for the sake of respect. Do you really think I have to look at your face? Do you think you can stop me from coming in?]

Just as he took one step forward though, a force travelled through the air and smacked him in the face. Yang Kai lost his balance and literally rolled down the mountain.

By the time he got up again, he was already at the foot of the mountain.

Yang Kai looked up at the top of the mountain with clenched jaws. [Zhu Jiu Yin, you crazy woman!]

“Brat, if you have time to bother me, why don’t you use it to study your Void Land? This place... is not as simple as it appears!” The voice of Zhu Jiu Yin resounded around his ears.

“Not as simple as it appears?” Yang Kai was stunned, “What’s not simple about it?” He shouted loudly a few times, but there was no response from Zhu Jiu Yin anymore. He had no idea if the woman did not hear him, or simply turned a deaf ear to him.

In the midst of his anger, a rumble happened nearby. The ground trembled and it sounded like a thunderstorm. Yang Kai turned to it in shock, and saw two huge figures flying rapidly towards him from the mountain forest. When they got close, he saw sticky, slimy fluid dripping from the mouth of one of them, while the other one extended its huge head over to him, its eyes full of joy.

“It’s you two…” Yang Kai was sulking, but his mood improved a bit at the sight. These two giant creatures were the Scarlet Flood Dragon and the Earth Dragon that he brought out of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.

Yang Kai had fed them Dragon Blood Pills once in a while since the time in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary; therefore, every time they sensed Yang Kai’s aura, they would run over and beg for food.

Although Yang Kai refined a tremendous number of Dragon Blood Pills in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary and the quality was excellent, he had been consuming them all these years, so he did not have many left.

However, Yang Kai had no choice but to sigh helplessly when he saw the pleading looks on these two. He took out ten Dragon Blood Pills, and fed them five each as he said, “This is the last time. You won’t get it anymore.”

Without knowing whether they understood or not, they just swallowed the Dragon Blood Pills one by one excitedly before circling around Yang Kai cordially.

It was not surprising for them to appear here, because Zhu Jiu Yin lived here. They were all from the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, so they were more comfortable with each other. Furthermore, Zhu Jiu Yin would teach these two from time to time.

Given their somewhat childish behaviour, it was natural for them to stay here.

Yang Kai looked at them and found that both the Scarlet Flood Dragon and the Earth Dragon were more than twice the size from the first time he saw them. The Dragon auras emanating from their body were also much stronger; after all, they both had Dragon Clan bloodlines, though only a trace amount. Nonetheless, the Dragon Blood Pills were extremely helpful to them and had strengthened them to a great degree.
