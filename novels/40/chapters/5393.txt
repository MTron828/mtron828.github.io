If Yang Kai was in the position of the Royal Lords, he would also divide his forces to hit the Humans before the Great Passes fully converged.

What he was concerned about turned out to be reality as the Black Ink Clan did exactly what he feared.

“Brother, I’ll leave this to you,” said the Old Ancestor of Azure Void Pass. The next moment, his aura faded and a pillar of light shot up into the sky from Azure Void Pass.

The Azure Void Pass Old Ancestor also went to support the second Great Pass that was attacked by the Royal Lords.

The void trembled and the sky shook from an ox’s bellow as a Master’s aura approached rapidly.

Yang Kai turned his head and saw the Wind and Cloud Old Ancestor, riding a mighty bull, charging over from the direction of Wind and Cloud Pass.

Great Evolution Pass was in the center, Wind and Cloud Pass on the right, and Azure Void Pass on the left. Now that Old Ancestors of Great Evolution Pass and Azure Void Pass have left, the Old Ancestor of Wind and Cloud Pass had to shelter the three Great Passes all on his own. Thus, it was only natural that he came to Great Evolution Pass so that he could be positioned at the center, and monitor the left and right passes.

“Greetings, Old Ancestor!” Yang Kai and the members of Dawn saluted.

The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor did not go to Great Evolution Pass directly and instead landed on Dawning Light.

The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor nodded lightly, smiled at Yang Kai, and said, “Well done.”

He was referring to the battle at the Royal City a few years ago. Yang Kai, as a Seventh-Order Master, killed a Territory Lord and a Ninth-Order Black Ink Disciple. This must have been the only achievement of its kind in the entire history of the Black Ink Battlefield.

Normally, the Old Ancestors did not take much note of those in the Seventh-Order; however, Yang Kai had drawn his attention.

“It was a fluke, Old Ancestor,” Yang Kai said modestly.

The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor chuckled and said, “With your abilities, if you can reach the Ninth-Order, you should be more useful than us old guys. What a pity…”

Unfortunately, Yang Kai’s advancement to the Open Heaven Realm started at the Fifth-Order, and then he took a Mid-Rank World Fruit, which raised his innate limit, but only to the Eighth-Order.

An Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was strong, but still not comparable to a Ninth-Order Master.

“Of course, if we can find the Universe Furnace, we should be able to help you break through those shackles.”

Yang Kai appeared gloomy as he replied, “This Junior is only a Seventh-Order Master now. It is too early to think about trying to reach the Ninth-Order. Furthermore, if we can completely solve the problem of the Black Ink Clan, then what does it matter if I am an Eighth-Order Master or a Ninth-Order Master in the future?”

He then raised his eyes, looked to the distance, and said solemnly, “I hope that will be the case!”

They had been on the Black Ink Battlefield for so many years, but if they really could return to the 3,000 Worlds, they would no longer need to cultivate and could just play with their descendants and enjoy a comfortable life.

The war had lasted far too long, so the Old Ancestors were all eager for such peaceful days.

Following his gaze, Yang Kai asked, “Old Ancestor, is the situation dire?”

Old Ancestor laughed lightly and said, “They’re just courting death.”

On hearing him say that, Yang Kai suddenly felt much better. He then raised his eyebrows and asked, “Had the Old Ancestors anticipated this?”

“Not really, it was just a precaution; after all, so many Royal Lords escaped and such a force could not be taken lightly,” the Old Ancestor casually replied, “We can’t find them if they hide, but since they chose to attack, we must capitalise on the opportunity to kill them. It’s better for us that the enemy is out in the open rather than hiding in the dark.”

“But now that the Royal Lords are splitting their forces between several places, it will be difficult for the Humans to deal with them, no?”

The Old Ancestor slowly shook his head “They divided their troops, but so can we. Didn’t Xiao Yue Ya… your Great Evolution Pass and Azure Void Pass’ Old Ancestors go to support the fight?”

[Xiao Yue Ya?]

Yang Kai raised his brow as he realized that he had heard something unbelievable.

“And… the Black Ink Clan is ultimately different from the Human Race. They are indeed rather strong and have caused problems for us Humans when they defended their respective High-Rank Black Ink Nests; however, they have a very obvious disadvantage. Do you know what it is?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and said, “They have to use their Black Ink Nests to heal their wounds?”

The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor smiled and said, “Correct. That is their biggest flaw, a fatal one if you will! The Black Ink Clan’s very survival is based on their Black Ink Nests, so they are nothing without them. Although these Royal Lords escaped previously, all of them are seriously wounded in the process, and without Black Ink Nests, they would not have been able to recover from their injuries in just a few years.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he listened and his worries eased significantly.

He had forgotten about this.

The reason why Mo Zhao had not been able to recover from his injuries over the past few hundred years was because Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao had been harassing him. Occasionally, she would use Space Beacons to teleport to the outskirts of the Royal City to threaten him. When that happened, how could Mo Zhao have the time to fall asleep inside his Black Ink Nest to heal?

Mo Zhao had no way to recover, so he had to drag his injuries out until the final battle, when his Black Ink Nest was destroyed and he was killed by Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao.

That was the case for Mo Zhao, and now the other Royal Lords would suffer similar fates.

Although those Royal Lords escaped from the other Theatres with their lives, they did not have Black Ink Nests to enter retreat and heal; therefore, they were like Mo Zhao, unable to recover from their wounds.

“Moreover, they fled all the way to this place, passing by many dangers along the way. If they were lucky extremely, their journey may have been smooth, but you have experienced the hidden dangers in this region of the void. We relied on the protection of the Great Passes to remain safe, but those Royal Lords had to travel alone. Many of them must have suffered additional injuries along the way.” The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor patted the head of the bull he was riding and joked, “These Royal Lords would be lucky to have 70% of their strength remaining.”

70%! It still seemed like a lot, but it was significantly lower than their peak, and unlike the Royal Lords who had no way to heal, the Old Ancestors were different. When the Old Ancestors were wounded, they might take a few decades of recuperation to heal, but they would eventually recover from their injuries as long as they were given enough time and resources.

“So, if they didn’t reveal themselves, we old folks would have to constantly remain on guard against them. Since they are out attacking us though, it can be considered a good thing. We can kill them now, and it should not be difficult to do so. Now it only depends on how many we can eliminate.” The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor slightly narrowed his eyes and continued, “However, the fact that they chose to attack us here meant that we are not far from the Source Domain. They certainly don’t want us to get close too, so even if they know that they can’t win, they still have to fight hard.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s possible, but highly unlikely.” Old Ancestor mused, “From all the information we’ve gathered, those Royal Lords in the Black Ink Nest Space should be under some kind of restriction with no way for them to easily move their true bodies. They were able to ambush our Ninth-Order Masters in that Black Ink Nest Space only because they had the help of the Black Ink Nest’s power. However, nothing is certain; after all, we do not know anything about the situation in the Source Domain. Whether those Royal Lords will intervene or not, we will find out soon enough.”

Of course, they would know when the final battle began.

Things would not bode well for the Humans if those Royal Lords that appeared in the Black Ink Nest Space could intervene in this battle.

Thus, the result of this battle would directly verify the Human’s previous speculations.

It was always torturous to have to wait. The after-effects of the fight in the void seemed to be increasingly violent, and even from a long distance, the fallout was clearly transmitted to them.

Yang Kai could not tell who had the upper hand.

Then, a strange fluctuation radiated towards them. The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor raised his eyebrows, smiled, and said, “There… A Royal Lord has fallen.”

The fluctuation was due to the death of a Royal Lord!

Those aboard Dawn all punched their fists in the air and cheered in celebration. Yang Kai also heaved a long sigh and began to relax.

A Royal Lord had fallen, which meant that the Human Race had the upper hand. It looked like the Royal Lords that appeared in the Black Ink Nest Space really had not moved; otherwise, a Royal Lord could not have been killed so quickly.

After the first Royal Lord fell, the Humans seemed to gain momentum and soon the Royal Lords were killed one after another.

The battle continued, and the energy disturbances became increasingly violent.

The number of fallen Royal Lords was increasing, and the energy fluctuations were getting progressively more intense!

The Royal Lords who had escaped from the Theatres were now fighting to the death!

It was not until several days later that the commotion in the distance suddenly subsided.

Yang Kai and the others all looked at the Wind and Cloud Old Ancestor. Although they already had a guess in their hearts, since the Old Ancestor did not give a conclusive answer, they remained unsure.

The Old Ancestor obviously noticed their gazes and smiled, “This was a huge victory!”

A huge victory!

Cheers erupted aboard Dawning Light.

At the same time, there was also a loud cheer from Great Evolution Pass.

Apparently, the Inner Sanctum had also found out about the results of the battle.

Yang Kai and the others were extremely excited, but there was a hint of doubt in the Wind and Cloud Old Pass Ancestor’s smile.

He had sensed that in the battlefield, all the Royal Lords auras had withered.

In other words, all the Royal Lords he could sense had fallen.

This was not normal.

In the past, when these Royal Lords could not defeat the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, they still had the sense to escape. Why had they not attempted to flee this time? As for whether or not they could escape, they could still at least try.

Although not personally involved in this battle, Wind and Cloud Pass’ Old Ancestor’s investigation found out that all those Royal Lords fought bravely to the bitter end. Not only did none of them try to escape, they went all out right from the beginning, not seeming to care about their own lives. That was why the energy fluctuations were so intense.

These Royal Lords wanted to destroy a Great Pass, but even after noticing the response of the Human Race, they still did not back down.

The Wind and Cloud Pass Old Ancestor sensed that in the two battlefields, a total of 11 Royal Lords fell. Five in one and six at the other.

Under normal circumstances, a Great Pass could not withstand a combined attack from five or six Royal Lords; however, the Human Race was prepared. The moment the battle broke out, the nearby Old Ancestors all raced over to provide support…
