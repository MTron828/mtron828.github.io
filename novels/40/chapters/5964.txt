Chapter 5963: If We Are Destined To Meet Again, We Will

When Xue Ji killed the Blood Slaves, she didn’t read too much into it. It wasn’t until she heard Li Fei Yu’s words that she realised something bigger was going on.

Everyone who had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength, regardless of whether their temperament had been contorted before, was doomed this time. The bottom of the Black Ink Abyss seemed to be deathly attractive to them as they charged towards it, no matter the cost.

The Blood Slaves were the best examples; all four Blood Slaves had been completely loyal to Xue Ji, and she had even planted a restriction on each of them to ensure that. Still, they betrayed her without hesitation just now.

However, there didn’t seem to be anything wrong with her.

She could feel that some Black Ink Strength remained in her body, probably what she had previously refined in the Black Ink Abyss.

Nevertheless, the Black Ink Strength seemed to have been suppressed by some different power, so it didn’t have any impact on her.

That power that suppressed the Black Ink Strength was coming from her Blood.

It could only be the power she derived from her Master’s blood.

While they spoke, the disturbance among the Spirit Religion’s soldiers intensified. More and more beast-like growls were heard. The cultivators, whose temperaments had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength, lost their sanity and turned into Black Ink Disciples.

Despite his age, the young Holy Son showcased his resoluteness as he ordered, “Order Lords, please return and form a defence line. We can’t let those who have been affected by Black Ink Strength enter the Black Ink Abyss, no matter what!”

He had no idea who the person that the Saintess had mentioned was, nor did he know what that person had done at the bottom of the Black Ink Abyss; however, he knew what he was supposed to do now.

Following his order, the Order Lords came to their senses while the Saintess looked approvingly at the Holy Son, who appeared pleased with this acknowledgement.

Yu Dao Chi looked coldly at him and thought that young men could be easily fooled by beautiful women. They had no idea that power was the best thing in the world.

Despite being exasperated, he dashed forward and gathered his subordinates together as per the Holy Son’s request.

The other Order Lords started taking action as well and soon, a war broke out.

Following a month of the war, many people from the Spirit Religion had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength. They were initially comrades, but they had to kill each other now. Many people didn’t have the heart to do it, but the Black Ink Disciples held nothing back. Since they were determined to enter the Black Ink Abyss, they would do their best to remove any obstacles in their way.

Upon realising that these Black Ink Disciples couldn’t be saved, those from the Spirit Religion no longer held back. Everyone fell into a frenzy, and soon, the disturbance subsided.

Just as they thought the turmoil was coming to an end, Masters that were engulfed in Black Ink Strength charged towards them from all directions.

They were the Black Ink Cult Masters who had been hiding in different places. After they received the calling from the Source Strength in the Black Ink Abyss, they came forward and revealed themselves.

An even more intense war broke out. The Spirit Religion’s soldiers didn’t have the heart to hurt their comrades, but they wouldn’t go easy on those from the Black Ink Cult.

Xue Ji just stood silently beside the Black Ink Abyss and listened to the sounds of the slaughter. She had to execute Yang Kai’s command by killing anyone who tried to enter the Black Ink Abyss.

The upheaval lasted for several days. It wasn’t until the last batch of Black Ink Cultists were killed that peace was restored.

No one cheered or felt happy this time. The Spirit Religion’s soldiers were exhausted as they lay on the ground, and as they looked at the corpses of their slain comrades, they felt sorrowful.

The Spirit Religion Masters gathered in front of the Black Ink Abyss again. With Yu Dao Chi in front of everyone, the Order Lords mounted pressure on Xue Ji.

The sudden turn of events made them realise the importance of the Black Ink Abyss. They had to find out what was hidden at the bottom of the abyss; only by doing so could they prevent the same thing from happening again.

However, Xue Ji never gave in and her murderous intent permeated the air. The atmosphere beside the Black Ink Abyss grew more intense by the day.

The stalemate lasted for a while, but just as hostilities were about to break out, Xue Ji appeared joyful all of a sudden and looked down at the Black Ink Abyss.

At the same time, all of them could feel an aura rising rapidly from the depths of the Black Ink Abyss.

What surprised them was that the power of the aura even surpassed that of Xue Ji.

The next moment, a figure landed in front of Xue Ji, who went over and greeted the man, “Master!”

Yang Kai nodded and gave her an approving look, but he raised his hand to stop her from approaching him.

Presently, the space around him had been contorted as a repulsive force surrounded him. There seemed to be a mysterious power that was trying to destroy him.

“It’s you!?” All the Order Lords were flabbergasted.

All of them had seen Yang Kai before. When he entered the city, all the citizens went over to welcome him. He had the people’s support and the blessing of the World’s Will. At that time, they regarded him as a fake Holy Son.

Back then, in the Ancient Grounds, he couldn’t pass the test left behind by the first-generation Saintess and had been corrupted by Black Ink Strength. As such, three Order Lords joined forces and killed him, after which Li Fei Yu dealt with his corpse.

No one had expected that not only was this guy alive, but he had also dived into the depths of the Black Ink Abyss.

As the Order Lords recalled what the Saintess and Xue Ji had said, they couldn’t help but take a look at the Saintess. They seemed to have realised something.

If anyone else had emerged from the depths of the abyss at this point, these Spirit Religion Masters wouldn’t have let him off; after all, they had no idea whether this guy had been affected by Black Ink Strength.

However, at that moment, Yang Kai’s aura was so terrifying that no one had the guts to say anything.

“What’s happening, Master?” Xue Ji’s face paled. As she looked at the contorted space around Yang Kai and felt its destructive aura, she realised something was off.

Yang Kai flashed a smile at her, “Every World has its limits. The limit of this World is the Immortal Ascension Boundary. If anyone’s power exceeds this limit, they will be repelled by this World itself.”

Xue Ji was surprised as she realised what the man meant, “Master, do you mean you’ve reached the Realm above the Immortal Ascension Boundary?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “There is no end to the Martial Dao. To true Masters, the Realm above the Immortal Ascension Boundary is just the starting point.”

Then, he turned to look at the Saintess, “I’ve settled all the problems at the bottom of the Black Ink Abyss; however, some Black Ink Strength remains. It would be best if you arranged some arrays here to prevent anyone from coveting that Black Ink Strength.”

The Saintess nodded, “Don’t worry, Sir. I will handle everything.”

Following that, Yang Kai looked in Dawn City’s direction and put on a smile, “I have to leave.”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A flustered Xue Ji asked, “Where are you going, Master? Please bring me with you!”

Yang Kai’s words had a significant impact on her. She was originally from the Black Ink Cult, and only sided with Yang Kai after the latter subdued her. Now that the entire Black Ink Cult had been destroyed though, and all the Black Ink Cult Masters who had been hiding in different parts of the world had come out and been killed, it could be said that she was the only one in the World who still had some of the Black Ink Cult’s traces.

The Black Ink Cult had become history in this independent World, and there wouldn’t be any remnants of their presence just a few hundred years later.

Therefore, she didn’t want to stay here on her own. As long as she could follow Yang Kai, she was willing to serve him.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I have a mission to complete, so I can’t bring you with me.”

Xue Ji’s expression instantly dimmed as she pouted and fell silent. She looked like a young girl who had just been abandoned.

Yang Kai smiled helplessly, “Alright. I’ll give you a task.”

Xue Ji immediately appeared elated, “Anything, Master!”

With a solemn expression, Yang Kai said, “Stand guard here and kill anyone who tries to enter the Black Ink Abyss.”

Xue Ji replied seriously, “Yes, Master!” The next moment, she put on a cheeky smile, “Since I’ve taken on this task, do I get a reward?”

Yang Kai shot her a glare before flicking his fingers, after which a drop of golden blood shot towards her.

Xue Ji’s eyes brightened in an instant as she quickly gulped it down. She could tell that this blood droplet was very different from the ones given by Yang Kai in the past. It was a drop of his Blood Essence!

Yang Kai then spoke to her in secret, “I’ve left behind a restriction, so you’d better not be impatient when you refine it; otherwise, you’ll explode.”

Hearing that, Xue Ji nodded repeatedly.

The repulsion of the World’s Will was increasingly conspicuous and the destructive storm around Yang Kai made everyone’s face turn pale. All the Masters at the scene didn’t have the confidence to survive in such a storm, but Yang Kai remained calm and collected, which showed how formidable he was.

Realising something, Xue Ji hurriedly asked, “Will I see you again, Master?”

Yang Kai looked at her and replied, “If we are destined to meet again, we will.”

The next moment, a clap of thunder was heard and Yang Kai turned into a ray of light that shot into the sky.

The Masters watched as a crack appeared in the sky. The ray of light shot into the crack and disappeared.

The destructive aura also disappeared at the same time, as though it had never been there.

As the crack closed, the area beside the Black Ink Abyss fell silent.

All of them were covered in cold sweat and as they recalled Yang Kai’s words, they were astonished.

It was the young Holy Son who broke the silence by asking, “So, was he the saviour described in the prophecy?”

Although he was young and inexperienced, he wasn’t a fool. When he saw Yang Kai earlier, he realised something.

“Am I the fake Holy Son?” He pointed at his nose.

The Order Lords exchanged glances, realising the problem as well.

The Saintess looked at the Holy Son and replied with a smile, “He’s indeed the saviour described in the prophecy, but you’re the Spirit Religion’s Holy Son.”

After a month of the war, the Holy Son had gained the recognition of the Spirit Religion members. Everyone who had taken part in the crusade would only acknowledge him to be the Holy Son.

The young Holy Son scratched his head, “Alright, I’ll be the Holy Son, then. However, it’s inappropriate that no one is aware of who the real saviour is.”

The Saintess suggested, “You can slowly spread his contributions in the future so that the members will understand that he had made a move in secret and saved this World.”

The Holy Son nodded, “That’ll work. However, we’d better deal with the most pressing issue now. Before that person left, he told us to suppress and seal the Black Ink Abyss.”

“How do you want to do it, Holy Son?” Asked the Saintess.

The Holy Son turned to look at Xue Ji, “Do you want to join the Spirit Religion?”

Xue Ji was still feeling the power of the Blood Essence when she heard that. Surprised, she asked in confirmation, “Do you want me to join the Spirit Religion?”

“Yes. We share the same goal now, and that person told you to stand guard at the Black Ink Abyss before he left. In that case, I think it’d be better if we could work together. What do you say?”

Xue Ji looked seriously at him and saw her alluring figure reflected in the Holy Son’s clear gaze. After a moment, she smiled and nodded, “Fine.”

Rather than being all on her own, she felt that this outcome wasn’t too bad.
