“You want me to submit to you and become your slave?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at the young man. When he was cultivating in seclusion, he had noticed the arrival of these people from Azure Nether Paradise, but he hardly cared about them. [By the looks of it, it should be this guy.]

The young man smiled, “That will be your greatest honour!”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai muttered noncommittally.

Luo Qing Yun hurriedly interjected, “Yang Kai, when a man walks the world, he must have an unyielding character. He should prefer death while standing than kneeling in order to live. Think carefully, don’t let a single misstep lead to eternal regret!”

He was really afraid that Yang Kai would agree. If that was the case, then what was the point of Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light joining forces today? How would he avenge Lu Xue?

“This Young Master is speaking, how dare you interrupt!?” The young man from Azure Nether Paradise suddenly glared at Luo Qing Yun with an angry look on his face, “What’s your name? If you have the guts, announce it here!”

Luo Qing Yun’s expression immediately became extremely ugly. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, if he didn’t reply, he would appear weak, but if he did, he would be afraid of being punished later. Although he was a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he was still nothing in front of a colossus like a Paradise. Even if this young man couldn’t really represent Azure Nether Paradise, just the strength behind him was not something Luo Qing Yun could contend with. For the moment, he found himself riding a tiger, unable to get off mid-way.

At the same time, his heart was filled with incomparable fury. If it weren’t for this young man’s backing, how could a mere Emperor Realm brat dare act so presumptuously in front of him?

Fortunately, the young man didn’t make things too difficult for him. At this moment, it was the perfect opportunity to subdue Yang Kai, so he was completely focused on just that and couldn’t care about anything else. As long as he could subdue Yang Kai, all of Yang Kai’s harvests on the Yuan Magnetic Mountain would be his. That was a lot of Sixth-Order Yuan Magnetic Divine Stones. Even in the Cave Heavens and Paradises, it would still be a considerable amount of resources. The Old Ancestor would look at him in a new light when he returned to Azure Nether Paradise with this kind of harvest.

What’s more, Yang Kai had a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm maidservant with him, so perhaps he could use this opportunity to obtain her.

Ever since he met Yue He that day, he had been unable to forget her.

Seeing Luo Qing Yun not respond, he snorted lightly and turned to Yang Kai, asking, “This Young Master’s patience is limited, have you thought it through?”

Yang Kai replied indifferently, “You don’t have the qualifications to make me your slave!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body shook, and a powerful flame burst out from his figure, enveloping him like a raging inferno, causing the space around him to visibly distort and the world to tremble.

Amidst the raging flames, Yang Kai opened his eyes like two small suns, burning with scorching fire. A cold murderous intent filled the air as he shouted in a dignified voice, “You dare interrupt my seclusion and disturb my mind? All of you deserve death! Today, I will use your dog lives to cultivate my Divine Ability!”

With a loud bang, the Fire Element Power in his Dao Seal began to surge. With Yang Kai at the centre, halos of flame spread out in all directions, one after another, emerging to no end.

The next moment, miserable screams echoed through the sky. The cultivators closest to Yang Kai didn’t even have time to react before the wall of flames passed over them, igniting them into balls of fire that flew around like headless flies, crashing into their neighbours. However, in just two or three breaths of time, the screams came to an abrupt halt, and the burning fireballs were reduced to ash as they fell from the sky like dumplings.

In an instant, dozens of people had fallen!

Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock as they watched this scene. Much to their surprise, Yang Kai, who was alone, was the first to make a move even when he was surrounded by three thousand people including dozens of Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Furthermore, dozens of cultivators had fallen with just one strike!

“What kind of fire is that?” Chen Tian Fei’s eyes narrowed as he stared fixedly at the pitch-black flames burning around Yang Kai. He had never felt a shock greater than this.

Just the raging halo of flame alone was already so fierce, undoubtedly indicating that this Fire Element was of a very high Order. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for these cultivators to be unable to resist it.

[A Fifth-Order Fire Element power would never be able to accomplish such a feat. Could it be Sixth-Order?!]

Chen Tian Fei’s heart shook as he realized he had been underestimating Yang Kai all this time. Condensing a Sixth-Order Fire Element meant that Yang Kai’s aptitude was extraordinary, and his ambitions were immense. If this kind of person weren’t born in a Cave Heaven or Paradise, it would be impossible to cultivate to such an extent. Once he grows up, he would have a place in the 3,000 Worlds.

[This boy’s origins were always vague, could it be that he is from a Cave Heaven or Paradise? If that’s not the case, why would he speak to the young man from Azure Nether Paradise like that?]

Thinking so, a thin layer of cold sweat appeared on Chen Tian Fei’s forehead as he secretly prayed that this was not the case; otherwise, Scarlet Star’s good days had come to an end.

The raging burst of flames continued to spread outwards as bright flashes of light erupted. Sword Pavilion and Thunder Light disciples all activated their Secret Techniques and artifacts to protect themselves. The Sword Pavilion disciples even formed their own Sword Formations to block the raging flames.

The Starfall Sword Formation’s power was extraordinary, able to link together the strength of several dozen people once it was formed, boosting the power of all those who formed it, especially the one who held the core position.

Even though the raging flames were quite powerful, they were still blocked by the sword curtain of this Formation. On the other hand, although the number of Thunder Light cultivators was much larger, they were more akin to scattered sand than a cohesive unit. When they saw dozens of their companions die right before their eyes, all of them were terrified and hurriedly retreated.

After Yang Kai’s initial attack, he instantly disappeared from his original position. There was a calm and indifferent look on his face as he rushed straight into the crowd and threw a punch. The punch was surrounded by raging Golden Crow True Fire. The pitch-black flames caused even space to burn.

Tens of Thunder Light disciples in the punch’s path were reduced to ashes instantly.

Long Tai’s eyes bulged as he roared in fury, “Kill him!”

As he spoke, he took the lead and charged straight at Yang Kai. On the other side, Luo Qing Yun and Zhu Li, the other two Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, used various methods to lock onto Yang Kai’s figure with their Divine Senses. The former became one with his sword and slashed towards Yang Kai, while the latter slapped his waist and sent out a nail-shaped artifact. Under Zhu Li’s control, the artifact flew towards Yang Kai in a silent but deadly manner.

Seeing this, Yue He shouted from below, “Young Master, be careful!”

Although she knew that Yang Kai was strong, such a situation was still quite worrying; after all, two palms could not block four fists. A single careless mistake would result in death.

Moreover, she had been paying close attention to Yang Kai’s expression and was shocked to discover that there was something wrong with him at the moment, as if he wasn’t actually focused on the battle he was engaged in.

As expected, facing the attacks of the three Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters and countless others, Yang Kai didn’t even try to dodge. All he did was summon a series of Dragon Shields around his body and unleash a flurry of punches and kicks. The ordinary disciples of Thunder Light who were struck by Yang Kai’s attacks couldn’t resist at all, and even Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had no choice but to dodge.

*Hong hong hong…*

Attacks landed on Yang Kai’s body one after another, and no matter how strong his defensive Secret Technique was, it was unable to withstand such a flurry of fierce attacks. The Dragon Shields shattered, and before he re-formed them, the remaining attacks were already upon him.

Yang Kai’s figure staggered, his clothes instantly becoming ragged as he instinctively manipulated Space Principles in an attempt to dodge. Unfortunately, Zhu Li’s nail-like artifact actually had the effect of locking him in place and pinning him to the spot, making him unable to move.

The next moment, a sword light swished over as Luo Qing Yun roared, “Die!”

The moment he brushed past Yang Kai, a splash of golden blood spurted out from Yang Kau’s chest. Nonetheless, Luo Qing Yun’s eyes suddenly shrank because this sword strike had failed to kill Yang Kai. It was simply inconceivable!

One had to know that he was using a Secret Technique to control his sword, so even if this attack struck a cultivator in the same Realm, he or she would end up dying for sure; however, Yang Kai had only suffered some minor injuries, that’s all.

[How tough is this guy’s physical body? Is he even human?]

Luo Qing Yun didn’t know that although Yang Kai was human, he could take the form of an over 2,000 metres tall Half-Dragon using his Dragon Transformation Secret Technique. Yang Kai had been consuming Dragon Blood Pills all the while as well, so his physique had risen to a new level. Therefore, how could he be so easily killed? Rather, the fact that Luo Qing Yun could injure his physical body was already quite a feat.

Golden Blood was flowing out of his chest, but Yang Kai didn’t seem to notice it at all. From the moment the battle began, the light in his eyes had become calm and cold, like a pool of still water. His entire body had turned into a mindless battle machine, only knowing how to fight.

Long Tai flew over at that moment. He clenched his fists and raised them high before smashing them towards Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai suddenly raised his head and stared at him indifferently, causing Long Tai’s heart to clench. He subconsciously felt that something was wrong, but it was too late for him to withdraw now, so all he could do was let out a furious roar and attack with all his strength, hoping for the best.

Yang Kai sent out a punch of his own, and in front of everyone’s astonished eyes, Long Tai was sent flying backwards at a speed faster than he had arrived, spurting a bloody mist as he tumbled through the air.

The whole Star City went into an uproar!

Long Tai was a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master while Yang Kai was just a mere Emperor Realm cultivator, yet in this frontal clash of punches, it was actually Long Tai who was sent flying and injured! Even if they were in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, this was still inconceivable.

Chen Tian Fei smiled bitterly. If Long Tai had seen Yang Kai kill Du Niang Zi and Gan Hong like slaughtering chickens in Scarlet Star’s Main Hall, he wouldn’t have acted so rashly.

[In front of this monster, a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master is nothing.] He still vividly remembered the terrifying scene of Yang Kai killing Du Niang Zi and would shudder every time he thought about it.

The moment he repelled Long Tai, Yang Kai suddenly turned around and grabbed toward a certain spot in the sky.

A few hundred metres away, Zhu Li’s expression changed as he quickly changed his hand seals, but it was still too late. When Yang Kai withdrew his hand, a nail-shaped artifact appeared in his palm. It was Zhu Li’s.

The pitch-black flames in Yang Kai’s palm burned fiercely.

“Stop!” Zhu Li cried out in horror. This Spirit Fixing Nail was something he had obtained by chance while out for life experience, and its power was extraordinary. Once it was used, it would be like a maggot clinging to rotting bones. As long as he was given enough time, he would be able to use his Secret Technique to launch a fatal blow towards Yang Kai’s Soul through the nail, but before he could prepare himself, Yang Kai had seized the initiative.

[How is this possible?] Looking at the rolling flames, Yang Kai obviously wanted to use his Fire Element Power to destroy this artifact so as to avoid disturbing his Space Technique.

Zhu Li had used his Soul to refine the Spirit Fixing Nail, so if it was really destroyed, his Soul would definitely be damaged, which was why he was panicking.
