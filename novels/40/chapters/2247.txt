The Principles of the Small Sealed World weren’t perfect... Although the Small Sealed World had absorbed a lot of Shattered Principles from the third layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, its inner World Principles still lacked something and could never be compared to the Principles of the Star Boundary.

It was not a problem for a Master like Hua Qing Si, with her level of cultivation, to normally cultivate and comprehend in the Small Sealed World.

However, if she wanted to break through, the Small Sealed World was not suitable for her due to the imperfection of the Principles here. The Heavenly Way and Martial Dao that she could sense and comprehend from this place were insufficient to support her next breakthrough.

But when that time came, Yang Kai would definitely let her out and find a safe and proper place for her to break through peacefully. By then, Yang Kai would have a subordinate Emperor who could fight for him...

He was so excited just thinking about it.

Zhang Ruo Xi had also made rapid progress these days, and now her Second-Order Returning Realm cultivation had been fully consolidated.

The cultivating speed of those Favoured Sons and Daughters of Heaven paled in comparison to Zhang Ruo Xi’s.

Something in Zhang Ruo Xi seemed to be awakening gradually, and as it did so, her cultivation speed only grew faster and faster. There was a gradual change in her character as well, as she became less timid and instead was imbued with strength and confidence.

This naturally pleased Yang Kai.

It had been two months since Yang Kai came back from the Divine Ascension Mirror World, and today, like the day before, he was nourishing his Soul Splitting Saber in order to cultivate the Heaven Severing Slash in his cave mansion. Suddenly, he sensed the barrier outside being slightly disturbed.

He immediately stopped his cultivation and returned his consciousness to his body. Taking out the control token, he then disabled the barriers.

A voice was heard from outside, “Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!”

The voice was familiar and Yang Kai realized who the person was after a while.

He replied, “Please enter, Deacon Tao.”

Outside the cave mansion, Tao Ming, who originally had a small grudge with Yang Kai a few months ago, heard his invitation and stepped into the cave mansion with a solemn face.

After a short while, he came to the secret room. However, Tao Ming at this moment had long lost his past arrogance and greeted Yang Kai with a flattering smile, “Pardon me for interrupting Young Master Yang’s rest. This Tao feels deeply guilty about this.”

Yang Kai glanced at him and said lightly, “Who sent you here? What news do you bring?”

Tao Ming’s face turned solemn again after hearing this, “By the order of Sir Temple Master, this Tao is here to inform Young Master Yang that the item you need... has been found.”

Yang Kai got up hastily as his eyes lit up and he called out, “Really?”

Tao Ming smiled, “Temple Master gave his word personally for this matter.”

“Great, it’s been found!” Yang Kai brightened up.

Although Tao Ming did not tell him what ‘it’ was, what else could it be other than the Tribulation Fruit?

Even though Yang Kai had been busy with the Insect Enslavement Bracelet, raising his Soul Devouring Insects, and nourishing his Soul Splitting Saber, he never stopped thinking about the matter of the Tribulation Fruit. It was just that the appointed time had not arrived, so he did not become impatient either.

Now, he finally received the good news.

He could not help releasing a sigh of relief, and his whole body relaxed, as if the burden he had been carrying for a long time was finally lifted.

After all, the Tribulation Fruit was a matter of life or death for Qin Yu.

All the opportunities that he received during these past few months were only possible because of the Bustling World Token owned by Qin Zhao Yang.

If he failed to obtain the Tribulation Fruit, Yang Kai would not have been able to give a proper confession to Qin Zhao Yang and the Qin Family.

This matter would definitely become a stain on his conscience and may even develop into a Heart Demon.

But now, he no longer needed to worry. Since Wen Zi Shan had ordered Tao Ming to send a message to him, it meant that the Tribulation Fruit had been found.

In this way, he could bring the spirit fruit back to Maplewood City, hand it over to the Qin Family, and finally untie this knot in his heart.

Tao Ming rejoiced with him, although he had no idea what Yang Kai was looking forward to. He just needed to flatter him.

“Right, Deacon Tao, did the Temple Master say where that thing is now?” Yang Kai asked after composing himself again.

Tao Ming replied, “Temple Master said that the thing is already en route and will be here within three days. Young Master Yang may rest assured that there will not be any accidents.”

“Good good good, thank Temple Master Wen on my behalf,” Yang Kai cupped his fists formally.

“If Young Master Yang has no other orders, this Tao will take his leave,” Tao Ming smiled.

“En, many thanks, Deacon Tao!”

Yang Kai sent Tao Ming off, but he did not feel like cultivating again after. He guessed that Wen Zi Shan had sent a message to him just now in order to let him feel at ease, but he also probably did not expect that Yang Kai would value the Tribulation Fruit so much...

Yang Kai felt like he was sitting on pins and needles in his cave mansion for the next three days, and early in the morning of the last day, Yang Kai left Purple Bamboo Peak and rushed towards Myriad Saints Peak.

When Yang Kai reached the temple’s main peak, before he could even announce his arrival, Wen Zi Shan’s voice called out from inside, “Come in.”

Yang Kai was startled... but quickly straightened up his clothes and stepped in.

There was no one else in the temple except for Wen Zi Shan, who was sitting cross-legged, seemingly cultivating some kind of mysterious art.

Yang Kai waited quietly and did not interrupt him after entering the temple.

Secretly, Yang Kai was impressed.

Wen Zi Shan was already so powerful with his Third-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, yet he was still so diligent and did not slack at all in his efforts.

For a cultivator, being untalented was not scary. What made a cultivator formidable was not their aptitude, but their will.

No doubt, Wen Zi Shan was a man of incredible will. It was not a fluke that he was able to reach the Third-Order Emperor Realm ...

After a short while, Wen Zi Shan ceased his work and opened his eyes. He looked at Yang Kai and teased, “What’s wrong? Can’t wait for it anymore?”

Yang Kai said shyly, “The earlier I see it, the earlier I will be at ease.”

“En, a loyal and righteous spirit!” Wen Zi Shan nodded, “The Bustling World Token from the Qin Family was not wasted.”

“It’s only natural for a man to fulfil his promises,” Yang Kai replied.

Wen Zi Shan nodded lightly, pondered for a short while before saying, “Have you given the matter mentioned by Little Xue Ting any thoughts?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Yang Kai gave a wry smile after hearing this, “So, it was Temple Master Wen who asked Elder Gao to persuade me?”

“Yes, it was my idea, but Little Xue Ting also has great expectations of you,” Wen Zi Shan admitted bluntly. “Besides, you have entered the Divine Ascension Mirror World, so you can already be considered half a disciple of the temple, yes? This is a secret that even ordinary disciples do not know about”.

Yang Kai looked solemn and pondered for a long while. He seemed to be considering the words that he was about to say for a long time before finally opening his mouth, “Many thanks to the kindness of Temple Master Wen and Elder Gao, but Junior does not have any thoughts about joining any Sect for now. It is not because I despise or even dislike your noble temple, but... Junior has his own reasons.”

Of course, what he meant was the Demon Spirit.

Wen Zi Shan gazed at him intently and nodded, “Fine, this King won’t force you. However... if one day you grow tired of wandering outside, just come to our temple. Our gates will always be open for you!”

Yang Kai was slightly moved and bowed deeply, “Many thanks for your kindness, Temple Master Wen. If such a day does come, it will be this Junior’s honour to accept!”

Wen Zi Shan grinned, “This King was like you back then, in love with the idea of wandering freely and enjoying life, but then...” The corner of his mouth twitched before he continued, “I picked up a little girl who fought like a wild cat for food in the wild.”

The appearance of Gao Xue Ting floated before Yang Kai’s eyes.

“So, bear in mind that you can pick up any treasure during your travels across the Star Boundary, but be sure not to pick up a little girl!” Wen Zi Shan said in a sincere and serious tone, “These little girls are cute, gentle, and obedient when they are young, but when they grow up, they will show absolutely no respect for you and become utterly heartless. Just speaking of this now... it brings tears to one’s eyes!”

He looked extremely hurt, making Yang Kai feel speechless.

“Only brings tears to your eyes, is it?” A cold, emotionless voice suddenly came from outside the hall, causing the temperature inside the plummet rapidly. It was as if the weather had suddenly turned and winter rolled in, causing one to feel a chill deep in their bones...

Wen Zi Shan froze solid and his face twisted up, as if he had been hit by some kind of paralysing technique.

A moment later, a beautiful figure slowly walked inside.

Gao Xue Ting, her face cold as ice, swept her beautiful eyes, which seemed to be filled with thunder and lightning, across the room.

Wen Zi Shan seemed to shrink to half his original height at that moment, and even Yang Kai could not help shivering.

A murderous intent and hostility filled the air.

“Show absolutely no respect, right?” Gao Xue Ting said flatly as the corners of her mouth curled upwards ever so slightly.

“Th... this is... tha... that...” Wen Zi Shan’s sweat was dripping down like a waterfall and his words cracked like he was stuttering incoherently. At the same time, his eyes kept swirling about as he forced himself to put on a flattering smile, “Little Xue Ting, wha... what are you doing here? Wh, wh, why didn’t you send a notification before coming in? I... i... isn’t this a little impolite?”

Gao Xue Ting answered coldly, “I’m here to deliver the Tribulation Fruit.”

Saying so, she tossed a jade box to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he caught the jade box and opened it with a flick.

The box was full of cold mist, and a crystal-like spirit fruit was lying quietly inside it.

[The Tribulation Fruit!]

Even though Yang Kai had never seen the real thing before, he could still identify it at a glance. By looking at the appearance of the Tribulation Fruit, it seemed that it was freshly harvested not long ago. If he wasn’t mistaken, this Tribulation Fruit was the very one that had been picked in the Realm of Winter in the Four Seasons Realm.

Yang Kai didn’t know which great force Azure Sun Temple obtained this spirit fruit from, but given the time consumed, it seemed that the Azure Sun Temple had put in a lot of effort for this.

“Utterly heartless, you say?” Gao Xue Ting did not intend to give up, however, and continued to stare at Wen Zi Shan coldly after handing over the spirit fruit, her eyes flashing like sharp swords.

Wen Zi Shan grit his teeth before putting on a strong expression and bellowing to Yang Kai, “Disaster has come, so this Temple Master will take his leave first. Take care of yourself! If you ever encounter troubles in the future, come to the temple!”

Yang Kai did not even have time to give his thanks before Wen Zi Shan’s figure flickered and disappeared.

“You want to run?” A cold light flashed across Gao Xue Ting’s beautiful eyes as she summoned her Radiant Sun Mirror Emperor Artifact. An intense beam of blazing sunlight shot out towards the void, and a moment later, Wen Zi Shan’s figure reappeared in that direction. Although Gao Xue Ting found his whereabouts, Temple Master Wen was still able to escape the Radiant Sun Mirror’s suppression with his extraordinary strength and disappeared in a blink of an eye.

“Old thing, don’t you dare run! Today I will show you what it really means to have no respect and become utterly heartless!” Gao Xue Ting ground her teeth as she stomped her foot and chased after Wen Zi Shan.

The disciples who were guarding outside watched this scene with their jaws dropped.

Yang Kai, who was holding the jade box, looked at the farce with a smile on his face. He kept smiling and smiling until he suddenly could not smile anymore, slapping his thigh in regret, “I forgot to ask about the Shattered Star Sea again!”
