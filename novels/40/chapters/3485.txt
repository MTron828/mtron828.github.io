Looking through each jade slip, most of them seemed to consist of trivial matters. Occasionally, there would be anecdotes that Yang Kai couldn’t even be bothered to pay attention to, but through the information gathered in these jade slips, he was able to gain some understanding of the unrest among the Demon Race.

The Demon Race had never been a quiet and peaceful race. Even as they were at war with the Star Boundary, internal struggles did not cease. Rather, the flames of war never settled. This day, the Demon King of this continent would enter into a conflict with the Demon King of that continent, and the next day, the Demon King of that continent would find helpers to get revenge. In short, many places were in utter chaos.

This convinced Yang Kai even more that the Demon Saints intended to thin the Demon Race population through the help of various means; otherwise, all they had to do was toss all these Demons onto the two worlds’ battlefields.

However, one of the jade slips revealed information that made Yang Kai a little concerned. The matter recorded on the jade slip was that regarding a place called Eternal Sky Continent. This continent originally had six Territory Gates that were connected to six different continents. But more than a year ago, four of the Territory Gates suddenly disappeared. Not only that, but the remaining two Territory Gates were heavily guarded. No one was allowed to enter or leave.

Nothing seemed strange about this information at first glance as, for nearly 10,000 years, Territory Gates had been disappearing all over the Demon Realm, and many continents had even disappeared completely. To the uninformed, Eternal Sky Continent seemed to be following in the footsteps of the various vanished continents.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up at this information though.

Even though the time recorded on the information was not too clear, it was consistent with the outbreak of the Two Worlds Great War. In other words, Bright Moon Great Emperor had also fallen into the Demon Realm during that period.

And, the disappearance of four Territory Gates was too abnormal. The Territory Gates that were lost previously all showed abnormal activity before slowly vanishing, but four Territory Gates of Eternal Sky Continent seemed to have closed up bizarrely overnight, disappearing without a trace.

Such a situation could only mean that external forces were interfering with the four Territory Gates, or some great eruption of power caused the collapse of the four Territory Gates.

None but the Demon Saints could wield such vast power.

In other words, there was a high possibility that the Demon Saints did something on Eternal Sky Continent, and the only ones that could match the Demon Saints in a fight would be the Great Emperors!

In a flash, a full grasp on the situation seemed to have formed in Yang Kai’s mind. When the four Great Emperors ventured into the Demon Realm to investigate, they were ambushed by the Demon Saints, and Bright Moon Great Emperor sacrificed himself to delay the many Demon Saints, allowing Iron Blood and the others to escape back to the Star Boundary. Then, Bright Moon Great Emperor was pushed back all the way to Eternal Sky Continent before finally engaging the Demon Saints in a fight to the death. The fallout from that battle then destroyed those Territory Gates!

If this speculation was true, then Bright Moon Great Emperor must be on Eternal Sky Continent, but whether he was dead or alive was unknown. However, Bright Moon was a Great Emperor who had gained the Star Boundary’s recognition. If he truly met with sudden misfortune, there would definitely be signs in the Star Boundary. And, as Heavens Revelations Great Emperor had said, Bright Moon Great Emperor still retained a shred of vitality. For that reason, Yang Kai believed that Bright Moon Great Emperor was alive and was simply trapped somewhere.

[Eternal Sky Continent…] Yang Kai gripped the jade slip tightly, a look of excitement on his face.

He had finally found a clue after staying in the Demon Realm for such a long time, so his efforts had not been in vain. He quickly took out the map that he bought and investigated it. Once he had a clear look at Eternal Sky Continent’s location, Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

This Eternal Sky Continent was not in Yu Ru Meng’s territory, which made things a bit difficult for him.

If Eternal Sky Continent was one of Yu Ru Meng’s territories, then with his reputation as Great King, sneaking in would not be too difficult. But since Eternal Sky Continent was in the territory of another Demon Saint, things weren’t as simple.

After all, he was a Human. Yu Ru Meng attached great importance to him, even going so far as to use her Heart Seal Secret Technique in order to bring him back to the Demon Realm, but that did not mean that the other Demon Saints would necessarily think so highly of him. If he rashly ran into someone else’s territory, it would be laughable if he were to be caught and casually crushed to death. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But no matter what, he had to go to Eternal Sky Continent. At the very least, he needed to figure out whether Bright Moon Great Emperor was truly there or not. If he was, then Yang Kai would find a way to save him; if not, he had to continue seeking information.

But before that, it would be best if he had the Embodiment break through to the Half-Saint Realm. That would give him some security.

As Yang Kai was lost in thought, the sound of footsteps suddenly emerged from behind him. Frowning, Yang Kai put away the jade slips and map somewhat discontentedly, wondering to himself how Xiao Wu could be so thoughtless. He had clearly ordered her not to let anyone in.

Turning his head around though, Yang Kai was stunned for a moment.

The visitor was not Xiao Wu, but rather a woman with an enchanting figure, a charming face, and beautiful red lips. This woman seemed to be a Snow Demon, with long pale silver hair that cascaded down her face, outlining her skin which was as fair as snow. Wearing a white dress, she gave off a pure sense of holiness rather than anything demonic.

Such a reserved way of dressing formed a strong visual conflict with her alluring looks, giving one a sense of amazement at what neither seemed to be pure nor seductive.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but stare for a moment, secretly wondering to himself if there was such a person in the palace? How come he’d never met her before?

But, this woman seemed to be just a maidservant. She approached holding a tray carrying a cup of vibrant red Blood Wine, as well as a bunch of spirit fruits resembling grapes.

As their eyes met, the woman smiled, causing the world to instantly lose its colour. This mere smile was enough to cause the downfall of cities and actually put Yang Kai’s mind into a trance as well.

Fortunately, a cool sensation seeped out from the Soul Warming Lotus and abruptly brought him back to his senses.

In a flash, alarm bells began ringing in his heart. Yang Kai’s face darkened and he suddenly slapped a palm down at the pool of water. Emperor Qi surged as the water turned into countless tiny droplets and splashed towards the Snow Demon. Each one of the droplets was infused with Yang Kai’s Emperor Qi, causing them to carry immense force.

A trace of surprise flashed across the Snow Demon’s eyes as she clearly did not expect Yang Kai to regain his senses so quickly and react so nimbly and decisively, even launching an attack directly at her. Seeing the countless water droplets approaching though, she smiled elegantly and waved her hand. The tens of thousands of water droplets filled with Yang Kai’s Emperor Qi were suspended in front of her, as if they had been frozen.

When she looked back at Yang Kai, he had already taken advantage of the moment when her sleeves blocked her vision to rise up into the air. With a ferocious aura filled with destructive force, he threw a palm strike down without mercy.

The Snow Demon’s brow knit slightly as Yang Kai’s actions undoubtedly caused her some anger. Raising a fair jade hand, she met his attack head-on.

With a bang, a wave of pressure swept out. The tables in the room clattered whilst the water in the pool splashed out. Yang Kai showed a look of surprise when he discovered that he had greatly underestimated this woman. Though he did not use his full strength in that blow, it was not something any ordinary Demon King could casually take on. For the other party to be able to block his attack in such a calm and relaxed manner, she had to be at least a High-Rank Demon King, or even possibly… a Half-Saint!

If this were a month ago, then Yang Kai may still have felt worried. He was unable to withstand the might of a Half-Saint before, but now that the Embodiment had become the Master of Cloud Shadow Continent, enjoying its blessings, even if his opponent truly was a Half-Saint, he still wouldn’t be afraid. If he were provoked, he could just let the Embodiment out and guarantee that this woman would be beaten so badly that she wouldn’t even be able to recognize herself in the mirror. When that time came, he would show her what he was capable of.

When he landed, Yang Kai summoned his Myriads Sword. Pointing the tip of the blade at the Snow Demon, he raised his nostrils to the sky with insufferable arrogance and shouted, “Cheap slut, who are you!”

The Snow Demon’s already unhappy expression instantly turned icy cold, and the tray that she had been holding the whole while shook faintly. She was obviously extremely enraged and glared sharply at Yang Kai with her beautiful eyes.

“What did you say?” Her lips slightly curved, appearing like a smile, but it was clear from her eyes that she was not smiling at all.

“You heard me. Quickly announce your name and I may spare you your life!” Yang Kai coldly snorted. Only then did he have the time to take out a set of clothes from his Space Ring and casually wrap them around his waist to protect his vital area. He was completely naked before, but he couldn’t help it. This woman’s visit was too sudden, so much so that he didn’t even have the time to get dressed.

Regardless of the other party’s intentions, an uninvited entry alone was enough to make Yang Kai hostile towards her. He did not remember having a Demon King like her among his subordinates, and his opponent was clearly not weak. She was obviously not from Cloud Shadow Continent, nor from Blue Plains Continent. Even more ridiculously, this slut actually dressed up as a maidservant to approach him, only making him more and more confused and alert.

“Your courage isn’t small. How dare you speak to this Queen like that.” The Snow Demon was clearly on the verge of exploding, but inexplicably, she just smiled again.

“You’re the one whose courage is great, daring to barge in even while a man is bathing. A single woman being in the room with a single man, aren’t you afraid that something will happen?” While speaking, he even deliberately ran his eyes over her body, as if he was eager to profane it with his gaze.

The Snow Demon answered indifferently, “And what is it that you wish to happen?”

Yang Kai laughed, “When the mood strikes, whatever can happen will happen when the spear points at its mark.”

The Snow Demon’s expression became odd as she looked at him, but then she suddenly covered her mouth and laughed like a trembling flower branch. Though she appeared pure and holy, it did not mean that she did not understand Yang Kai’s words. However, the way she laughed made her seem seductive and charming.

“What’re you laughing at! You think this is funny? I’ll knock your teeth out if you dare laugh again,” Yang Kai cursed her out loud and in his heart, still flaring his nostrils at her. How could women in this world be so bold and outrageous? Yu Ru Meng was like this, now this Snow Demon was also like this. Even though he was practically naked at the moment, that did nothing to deter her.

It was a long while before the Snow Demon put away her smile and slowly shook her head, the hair behind her back dancing along to her movements like a silver spirit, “I was planning to give you a severe punishment, but seeing how amusing and interesting you are, I’ll let you off with just a light one.” After a pause, she tilted her head and looked at Yang Kai, “But then again, if Yu Ru Meng were to know how you teased this Queen, what do you think she would do to you?”

Yang Kai frowned, “It’s still not clear who will do what to whom here yet.”
