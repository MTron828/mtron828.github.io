In the boundless Void, a group of four walked for who knows how long and avoided who knows how many Void Turbulences before they finally arrived at a strange place.

This place seemed to be divided into two levels, an upper and lower level, each connected by an enormous whirlpool. The whirlpools were completely pitch-black and seemed capable of swallowing anything and everything, giving everyone the shudders. Both whirlpools appeared to be in a mysterious static state, but anyone could feel the terrifying suction coming from them.

Yang Kai and the others were standing right in the middle of these two vortices.

After meticulously observing them for a long time, Yang Kai solemnly stated, “These two are the exits, and if I’m right, one should lead to the Star Boundary and the other to the Demon Realm.”

Li Jiao asked, “Which should we take?”

Yang Kai replied, pointing at one, “The upper one. Although both look exactly the same, Demon Qi is overflowing from the bottom one. That one definitely leads to the Demon Realm.”

“Since the location is determined, let’s go then,” Zhu Lie urged.

Yang Kai nodded before exhorting, “I will take you out of here back to the Star Boundary, but I can’t guarantee your safety during the transit; after all, there are a lot of variables here.”

“Since that’s the hand we are dealt, it’s useless to say anything anymore.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile and stated, “Then let’s go, you must closely follow behind me.”

Just as he finished speaking, his figure rushed towards the upper vortex. Space Principles madly surged as an invisible blow shot straight toward the vortex, prying open a way through it, creating a safe passage between the two realms.

Immediately, some unexpected changes began to appear in that calm and quiet vortex. The rotating layers upon layers madly squeezed from all directions, as if they wanted to push everyone out.

At first glance, the entire scene gave the impression that Yang Kai was riding a giant wave, waves that separated and then merged back together, and swirled behind him.

Zhu Lie and Li Jiao could only follow closely behind Yang Kai to avoid getting swallowed up by the current.

Fortunately, everyone was a Master among Masters and were connected by the Emperor Artifact ribbon. Furthermore, no one made any mistakes at this critical point.

Yang Kai pushed forward like a hot knife cutting through butter, releasing Space Principles to the limit.

After shuttling through the vortex for who knows how long, Yang Kai suddenly felt a huge resistance coming from the front, making him feel as if he had run straight into an iron plate. His blood began to roil and he could see stars circling around him.

The World Barrier!

The reason the two Great Worlds weren’t connected to each other was because of the existence of World Barriers. This was the barrier that shielded and bordered a Great World. Generally speaking, it was extremely strong and even Great Emperors couldn’t tear it apart.

According to what Yang Kai knew, only the Great Demon God of the Demon Realm once pierced through the World Barrier, allowing the Demon Realm’s Masters to descend to the ancient Star Boundary.

If the World Barrier was in a normal state, Yang Kai would never be able to pierce through it even if he was proficient in the Dao of Space; after all, his cultivation was too low. Compared to those ancient Masters, he was just in the First-Order Emperor.

But the World Barriers were incomplete here because of the existence of the Revolving World floating between the Star Boundary and the Demon Realm, so some flaws had appeared in it.

Although Yang Kai was disoriented after the collision, he also noticed a chance to break through it.

Suddenly, the Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus in his Knowledge Sea bloomed with seven coloured brilliance, stabilizing Yang Kai’s mind. At the same time, Yang Kai pushed his Space Principles to form Moon Blades one after another which he crazily fired towards the front.

Countless Moon Blades fell like a meteor shower and a gap really began to appear in the sturdy World Barrier.

Yang Kai rejoiced as he led everyone through that gap.

But right then, an accident occurred. Who knows whether it was triggered because of Yang Kai’s methods or because a gap had suddenly appeared in the World Barrier, but the Void Turbulences suddenly rioted, sweeping everyone up in an instant.

Yang Kai was caught off guard, and by the time he regained his wits, Zhu Qing was nowhere to be found.

He immediately turned pale in horror and promptly spread out his Divine Sense, but the next moment, his heart hit rock bottom.

Not only had Zhu Qing disappeared, even Zhu Lie and Li Jiao, who were following behind him, had also disappeared. Even the black puppy was nowhere to be found.

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat and stood rooted on his spot.

Yang Kai turned around, wanting to rush back, but the World Barrier had already repaired itself.

After a bright flash of light, Yang Kai appeared in another world.

Feeling the familiar World Principles in his surroundings, Yang Kai understood that he had returned to the Star Boundary, but it was a little different from his expectations. He wasn’t in the Frozen Earth, because there was no ice and snow anywhere in sight.

This wasn’t even the Northern Territory as although the World Principles of the Star Boundary were roughly the same everywhere, there were some subtle differences between the different territories.

Yang Kai had lived in the Northern Territory for quite some time, so if he was in the Northern Territory now, he would definitely have sensed it.

[Where the Hell am I?]

[Zhu Qing and the others wouldn’t have failed to keep up and get lost into the Void, could they?] Just as this thought crossed Yang Kai’s mind, his face immediately turned incomparably ugly. He hadn’t expected for an accident to happen when he had opened a rift in the World Barrier. Had he known this earlier, he would have been more cautious.

If Zhu Qing and the others were really lost in the Void, they might never be able to find their way out. In that case, he would have to return to the Revolving World to search for them, but even the black puppy was gone now, so even if he could really enter the Revolving World, he would not be able to venture deep into Yin Wind Mountain.

In a flash, Yang Kai became extremely depressed, and all the joy of returning to the Star Boundary had completely vanished.

He lowered his head and looked at his waist where Zhu Lie’s ribbon artifact was broken and had lost most of its brilliance. Its spirituality was completely lost as this fairly good Emperor Artifact was cut to pieces by the intense Void Turbulence. If Zhu Qing and the others had suffered similar fates, even their dragon bodies would be injured.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai forced himself to calm down and carefully think about what just transpired.

After a moment, Yang Kai’s taut nerves finally relaxed.

Although everything happened during a very short span of time, he still had sensed a little, and recalling everything step by step, he found some clues. He now believed that Zhu Qing and the others should not be lost in the Void as the Void Turbulence, which caused them to be separated, struck them as they passed through the World Barrier.

If that was the case, it meant that they had all returned to the Star Boundary, but the place where everyone returned was different.

[As long as Zhu Qing and Zhu Lie returned to the Star Boundary, they would not be in any danger. Perhaps they might be searching for me now.]

As this thought crossed his mind, Yang Kai finally relaxed somewhat, but whether this was the case or not, it had not been verified yet.

Finally, he looked around and found himself standing amidst scorching sand and violent sandstorms, like he was in a desert. The World Energy here was pretty lacking, and the environment was a little harsh too; he could not find a single piece of grass growing anywhere in sight.

[In any case, I need to find Zhu Qing and the others first.]

Thinking so, Yang Kai immediately summoned his Flowing Clouds Shuttle and flew off in a random direction to begin searching.

The desert seemed vast; Yang Kai had been searching around for several days but had not found its end. Of course, he had been circling around where he had appeared and hadn’t travelled in a straight line. Had he flown in just one direction, perhaps he would have left the desert.

The reason he was constantly circling was to look for any signs of Zhu Qing and the others.

After five days though, Yang Kai, who was keeping a close watch on the surroundings on the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, finally sensed a familiar aura. He was taken aback and immediately made a beeline in that direction.

It didn’t take him that long to reach that place, where he saw billowing sand as if an army was rushing over; it was quite an amazing sight.

And in front of that dust storm, a small black figure was running. It seemed to be running away from some fearsome Master, looking quite panicked as it weaved left and right.

The black figure was extremely fast, but pursuing it was an extremely powerful Monster Beast. This Monster Beast was treading the sand but was still unable to catch up to its target. Furious, it kept angrily roaring and attacking, leaving enormous pits in the surrounding deserts.

Promptly stowing the Flowing Clouds Shuttle, Yang Kai ran towards the fleeing black figure.

The black figure had obviously sensed Yang Kai’s aura and raised its head to stare at him. The black figure looked pleasantly surprised and immediately made a beeline towards Yang Kai, its speed shooting up as it pulled away from its pursuer.

After a while, the little black shadow arrived before Yang Kai and jumped into his arms, whimpering and trembling.

“Ah Wang, it’s alright now, don’t be afraid!” Yang Kai’s anxious heart finally relaxed as he gently stroked the black puppy’s back.

Seeing the black puppy, Yang Kai finally confirmed that Zhu Qing and the others were safe and sound. At least Zhu Qing was absolutely fine as the black puppy had been in Zhu Qing’s arms the whole time. Since the black puppy had returned to the Star Boundary, Zhu Qing had definitely returned as well. Only, he had no idea where she was.

Obviously, the black puppy had been fleeing for a long while as it was out of breath and its small body was heaving up and down. It had finally found a sense of security in Yang Kai’s arms.

“Hou!”

A deafening roar suddenly reverberated across the sky, shaking eardrums before the billowing sand flew over and an enormous Monster Beast the size of a two story building suddenly appeared. The beast looked extremely terrifying, like an angry bull that had two fangs protruding from the corners of its mouth. Its eyes were red as blood and it was exuding fearsome Monster Qi. Judging by the aura it was radiating, it appeared to be a peak Eleventh-Order Monster Beast.

Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter, “You are really useless. You were chased by this guy? Don’t you have your Swallowing Divine Ability?”

An Eleventh-Order Monster Beast was equivalent to a Dao Source Realm Master, that’s all. This Monster Beast might appear fearsome but the black puppy had even swallowed Demon Kings, so how could it be helpless before a mere Eleventh-Order Monster Beast?

Yang Kai couldn’t understand what was going on?

“Don’t make trouble! Swallow it.” Yang Kai poked the black puppy, but he didn’t expect it to shrink even more into his arms, leaving only its butt and its short tail between its legs exposed. It looked as if it would not come out no matter what.

“Hou!” The Eleventh-Order Monster Beast was angered by Yang Kai’s carefree appearance and let out another roar before it lifted its enormous paw and smacked it down towards him with the intention of flattening Yang Kai into nothing.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow before lifting his arm and flicking his finger straight towards the Monster Beast’s hoof. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The enormous hoof suddenly exploded and the Monster Beast was sent flying. The brutality in its scarlet eyes disappeared all of a sudden, replaced by pure horror.
