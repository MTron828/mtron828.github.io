“Senior Sister Zhu, pardon my previous offence. I’ll take my leave now.” Ti Zheng cupped his fist at Zhu Jiu Yin and left.

They had engaged in a life-and-death battle just now because they were on opposing sides, but there wasn’t any feud between them. Since the issue had been settled, there wasn’t a need to be hostile towards each other. Zhu Jiu Yin was a Divine Spirit after all, so he had to show her due respect.

All four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters turned into rays of light and disappeared from Zhu Jiu Yin’s sight.

They had suffered immense losses in this battle. Other than their own injuries, the over 20 Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters that they had brought with them were either killed or captured by Black Crow Divine Monarch. Only five or six of them had survived.

These losses were considered painful for the Cave Heavens and Paradises. It wasn’t easy to nurture Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters as it took a long time and countless resources.

Yue He and Bai Qi were still looking for the entrance of the Shadowless Cave Heaven as they continuously inspected the area but to no avail. Ti Zheng and the others must have a way to open the portal; otherwise, they couldn’t have made the Proprietress fall into it at an opportune time. There was no way Ti Zheng would tell them how to open it though, so it was pointless for them to ask him about it.

After standing around for a while, Zhu Jiu Yin sighed and said, “Stop wasting your time. The portal is so well hidden that even this Queen is unable to sense anything, so there’s no way you two will find anything even if you keep looking.”

“You cannot sense anything either, Senior?” Bai Qi was stunned.

If Zhu Jiu Yin also couldn’t sense it, there was no way he and Yue He could. After a long sigh, he looked in the direction Yang Kai had disappeared and fell into a dazed state.

In order to save the Proprietress, Bai Qi traveled to Void Land to inform Yang Kai about the incident. In the end, Yang Kai was forced to become a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, which basically destroyed his future. Now, he had gone into the Shadowless Cave Heaven on his own, and no one was sure whether he could come out again. All these results left Bai Qi feeling extremely guilty.

Yue He stopped making a move as her eyes were filled with anxiety and worry.

Qu Hua Shang came over and comforted her by saying, “Junior Brother Yang is a man who can create miracles that others can’t even dream of. Since he decided to go in on his own, he must have his own considerations and plans.”

Certainly, Yue He was aware of that. Just like what Ti Zheng had said, no one had yet been able to come out of the Shadowless Cave Heaven over the years, so no one knew what was going on inside. Yang Kai must have been worried that none of them could come out if they all went in together, so he decided to venture in alone.

As a Master of the Dao of Space, if he was unable to find a way out, it was pointless for the others to go in with him.

“Let’s go,” Zhu Jiu Yin said. She felt sorry that Yang Kai was forced to become a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master on this day, and he had even dived into the Shadowless Cave Heaven, so it wasn’t certain whether they’d have a chance to meet again. Since she had gotten rid of the oath restraining her, she felt completely at ease now. The problem now was how she was going to explain this matter to Shan Qing Luo when she returned. It gave her a headache just thinking about that young woman rashly deciding to come all the way here to look for him.

She truly valued this Junior of hers who had a Source from her lineage.

“You all can go back first. I must wait for Young Master here,” Yue He gently replied. Even though she was unable to go in with Yang Kai, she was determined to wait for his return regardless of whether it would take her a month or a century.

“What’s the point of doing that?” Zhu Jiu Yin snapped, “Before he left, he told you to go back to Void Land and take care of his Sect. What’s the point of you lingering here? Void Land is still in its development phase and there is no powerful Master to assume command of it now. Mo Mei has to manage the Star City, so who can take care of Void Land if you don’t go back? If you really want to help that brat, go back and help him manage Void Land well. Wouldn’t it be better if he returns one day and sees a prosperous Sect rather than a desolate one?”

After a moment of silence, Yue He replied in a small voice, “Senior is right.”

Upon seeing that she was willing to listen to reason, Zhu Jiu Yin nodded in satisfaction, “Let’s go.”

A while later, the four of them followed the previous route and left the Shattered Heaven, then Qu Hua Shang bid them farewell. Although she didn’t represent her Sect when she followed Yang Kai to this place, she had indeed caused some trouble; therefore, she had to return to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and receive her punishment. She probably wouldn’t be able to leave her Sect for a while.

Meanwhile, a figure was rapidly shooting towards the Territory Gate in the Shattered Heaven. The person’s face was ashen as he coughed from time to time. Besides the fact that blood was still dripping from the corner of his mouth, his aura was a complete mess. He was none other than Ti Zheng.

Four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had joined forces to deal with Zhu Jiu Yin, but the result of that intense battle was that both parties had been injured. While Zhu Jiu Yin indeed suffered serious wounds, the four High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters didn’t fare any better.

Ti Zheng was in especially bad condition because Zhu Jiu Yin was incensed at his humiliating remarks towards her, so most of her attacks were targeted at him Ti Zheng during the battle. There were even times when he almost lost his life.

With a bitter smile, Ti Zheng mused on how it was indeed difficult to deal with a mature Divine Spirit. He was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but if he were to fight a one-on-one fight with Zhu Jiu Yin, he would probably lose his life within an incense stick.

He had never been so severely wounded before. The flesh wounds didn’t matter as they would heal eventually, the problem was his Small Universe. The fierce battle destabilised his Small Universe and caused his World Force to become chaotic.

Now, he desperately needed to look for a place to stabilize his Small Universe; otherwise, he would be left with huge problems in the future.

His situation was similar to what Bai Qi had recently experienced. The reason Bai Qi got out of danger was that he had consumed a Star Gathering Universe Pill. If there were also Star Gathering Universe Pills around at this moment, it could help alleviate Ti Zheng’s problem.

Bai Qi was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so just one pill was enough to fix his situation. On the other hand, Ti Zheng was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so he would require more pills.

Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to refine such pills, so they were always scarce on the market. Back then, Yang Kai had paid a huge price to find an Alchemist to refine the pill; hence, even though Ti Zheng was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he didn’t have such a pill on him.

Furthermore, he had never expected that he would need such a pill one day. If he had only known, he would’ve prepared one in advance.

Presently, he had parted ways with the other three Masters. He had been feigning calm and nonchalance so that no one could tell how serious his injuries were; however, now that he was alone, he was unable to conceal his condition anymore. His Small Universe was continuously shaking while the weltering World Force caused his blood to churn.

All of a sudden, he looked to the side and bellowed, “Who goes there!”

Looking up, he saw someone surrounded by Demon Qi rapidly approaching him. Ti Zheng stared intently and saw through the Demon Qi, and upon making out the person’s face, he set his mind at ease.

When the person reached Ti Zheng, he cupped his fist and greeted, “Sir.”

Ti Zheng nodded lightly, then he suddenly grunted and coughed out some blood.

The person asked in shock, “Are you injured, Sir?”

Ti Zheng waved his hand and replied, “I’m fine. Where are the others?”

The person said in a bitter voice, “They’re all gone. Only I managed to escape. Earlier, Black Crow Divine Monarch had been hunting us down, so we had no choice but to run and hide. When I sensed your aura just now, I immediately came to you.”

Upon hearing that, Ti Zheng felt speechless. This time, Myriad Demons Heaven had sent out seven Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, but only one of them survived in the end, which was a complete tragedy. He secretly swore that he would capture Black Crow one day and let him know the consequences of offending him.

Then, he stared deeply at the person and said, “You’re pretty lucky.”

The person before his eyes was just a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. The two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had died, but this Fifth-Order kid managed to survive.

Embarrassed, the person replied, “I’m too weak, so Black Crow didn’t target me immediately. Perhaps that’s why I had a chance to flee.”

Right then, Ti Zheng grunted again. Besides from his lips, blood was also leaking from his eyes and nostrils, which made him look extremely miserable.

The person exclaimed, “Are you alright, Sir?”

Still, Ti Zheng waved his hand.

The person immediately summoned a ship and said, “Please board and recuperate, Sir. I’ll bring us back to Myriad Demons Heaven now.”

Ti Zheng nodded and entered the ship. After finding a secret room, he opened the isolation barriers, sat down crossed-legged and stuffed some pills into his mouth. As he emptied his mind and circulated his Secret Art, he tried to bring order to the chaos in his Small Universe.

His injuries couldn’t be healed in a short period of time, so even if he returned to Myriad Demons Heaven, it would take him three to five years to fully recover. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

...

Meanwhile, the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Myriad Demons Heaven was standing silently on the deck as the ship moved towards somewhere in the Shattered Heaven. As Demon Qi undulated, a small part of the fog floated away and revealed a pair of fervent and tempted eyes. Soon, a sense of determination flashed through his gaze as beneath the Demon Qi, the person curved his lips into a ferocious grin.

One hour later, Ti Zheng, who was recuperating in the secret room, became alarmed as he hurriedly opened his eyes. A Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master like him had incredibly sharp intuition, so he was often able to detect danger before it even befell him.

Before he could figure out what was going on, he heard an explosion and the ship rocked violently.

The ship had been struck and was about to explode!

Upon that realization, Ti Zheng roared and shot up as he used his immense power to repel the shrapnel around him.

Just when he tried to find out what had happened, he felt a violent force coming at him from all directions, which caused him to spray out a mouthful of blood.

Even though the explosion was powerful, it couldn’t possibly harm him. The reason he fell into such a state was that he had been interrupted while he was in a meditative state. These were no ordinary injuries as his Small Universe had been destabilised, so he couldn’t be interrupted while trying to stabilize them.

At that instant, he realised that the condition of his Small Universe had exacerbated; instead of healing, it had actually worsened.

While Ti Zheng looked around in a dazed state, he saw a figure surrounded by Demon Qi come flying at him backwards.
