When Shaman Che chanted, pressure built up in the surrounding Thunder Domain and pressed towards Yang Kai, suppressing him directly on the spot.

Che lifted his head and asked proudly, “How about now? Do you feel like considering my offer?”

Inside the Thunder Domain, he was in control of everything, and even this Shaman Niu in front of him would not be able to play any tricks.

Yang Kai struggled a few times, but his body was firmly locked and could not move an inch, so he couldn’t help praising, “Not bad!”

Che frowned slightly, revealing a strange look. The faint praise of Shaman Niu in front of him gave him a strange feeling. It felt as if he was not facing a newly promoted Shaman Master, but a Shaman King or a Shaman Saint, who was standing in an aloof position and commenting on his proud skill.

[Why do I have such a strange feeling? Isn’t he just a Shaman Master?]

However, the next moment, Yang Kai took a deep breath, puffed up his chest, and gently flicked the Myriads Sword in his hand. An astonishing vibration occurred at the sword tip next, resulting in circles of small but visible ripples.

Wherever the ripples passed, the Thunder Domain rapidly loosened, showing signs of collapsing.

Che was appalled, and he dared not to hold back his ability anymore. With a shake of his body, he enhanced his control on the Thunder Domain.

Che had not previously exerted his full strength while unleashing his Thunder Domain. After all, the opponent’s cultivation was a Great Realm lower than his, so how could he have expected that this Shaman Niu would have the ability to directly nullify his Domain?

However, it was still futile. The ripples from the strange Shaman Artifact Sword seemed to have unstoppable power, and no matter how much Che strengthened his control, he still could not stop his Domain from collapsing.

Cold sweat instantly beaded on Che’s forehead as he stared at Yang Kai with horror-filled eyes, as if he was looking at a ghost.

With the Myriad Sword quivering gently and Space Principles pulsing out from its blade, the Thunder Domain quickly broke and Yang Kai lightly stepped towards Che.

In the modern world, an Origin Returning Realm cultivator needed to master Shi, while Origin Kings mastered Domain. When one arrived at the Dao Source Realm, they would be able to sense and inspire the surrounding World Principles. As for the Emperor Realm Masters, they would be able to directly use Principle Strength.

To be strict, Che’s Thunder Domain was slightly better than a Domain of an Origin King, and it could even slightly inspire local World Principles.

Nevertheless, the power that was mastered by Yang Kai was even greater than his.

If Che did not try to show off meagre skills before an expert but had instead forced on a direct close combat battle with Yang Kai, perhaps the latter would need to put up more effort in countering him. This was mainly because Yang Kai’s cultivation was restricted at the moment and the power he could use was limited. However, Che had no idea about Yang Kai’s situation and attempted to suppress Yang Kai by taking advantage of the difference in realm between them, which gave Yang Kai a chance to turn the tide.

Space Principles were extremely esoteric in the first place, so when they were introduced into the Thunder Domain, they caused it to destabilize and quickly collapse. Wherever Yang Kai passed, the sky full of lightning turned blank, and the Domain was completely wiped away.

The gap between their level of skill was clear at a glance.

Following the footsteps of his opponent, Che could even hear the collapsing noise of his own Domain.

The distance between the two was rapidly getting close.

Yang Kai’s face was full of mockery, while Che was no longer as calm and proud as before.

When Yang Kai’s foot made the last step, it felt as though he was not stepping on the ground, but on Che’s heart.

Che, who was a powerful Shaman Grandmaster, and one of the few Commanders of the Frost and Snow Clan, trembled and spewed a mist of blood. His Thunder Domain collapsed instantly, and he retreated in a stagger, with a hand over his chest as his initially bright eyes became much dimmer.

When his Domain was broken, it was equivalent to his foundation being damaged, a severe injury. He thought that Shaman Niu talked big and was lying about it being impossible to stop him, but now it seemed that… He was speaking the truth.

But how was it possible for such a Shaman Master to exist in this world?

Yang Kai did not feel elated from overcoming the situation however and instead just swept his eyes around and muttered in annoyance, “Tsk, so troublesome.”

After speaking, he took out a green leaf and communicated with it in his mind. Then, in a flash of green light, his figure disappeared into thin air.

In the depths of the palace, a horrifying aura was aroused like a sleeping dragon being awoken. The appearance of this aura seemed to cause a terrible chain reaction and soon, more incredible auras surged from every corner of the royal palace.

It was the several Shaman Kings who were alarmed.

The colour of the Frost and Snow Clansmen in the entire royal palace drained from their faces as they stood with their heads down, their bodies shaking.

A few powerful Divine Senses scanned across the palace while Che, enduring the pain he was in, placed his hand on his chest, bent his waist towards the void, and spoke, “Greetings, Sirs.”

“What happened?” The aura that appeared first suddenly asked in an erratic voice that echoed from all directions.

Che pondered for a moment before briefly explaining the previous incident, focusing on Yang Kai’s various abilities and his skill in making medicine.

The several Shaman Kings were silent for a moment, likely communicating amongst themselves. Eventually, the Shaman King who spoke earlier declared, “Since he is useful for the Clan, go and invite him again. However, Senior Qing seems to favour him, so don’t be rude.”

“Senior Qing…” Che’s face changed hearing this.

There was only one person in the entire Ancient Barbarian Race who could be called ‘Senior Qing’ by the Shaman Kings, the one who protected the Frost and Snow City, the Evergreen Divine Tree!

[He actually obtained the blessing of Senior Qing?]

After some hesitation, Che showed a look of enlightenment. No wonder Shaman Niu suddenly disappeared. Before, he was still thinking about what was going on just now, but it turned out to be an ability of Senior Qing.

Now that he thought about it, Shaman Niu seemed to have taken out a green leaf just before disappearing.

The auras of the several Shaman Kings arrived rapidly, but also disappeared quickly. In the blink of an eye, they retreated like a tide, leaving Che alone with a frown on his dark face.

The Shaman Kings ordered him to invite Shaman Niu back again, but Shaman Niu was sheltered by Senior Qing. If he was unwilling to, what could Che do to be able to invite him over? If it was before what happened earlier, he still had the confidence to subdue him directly with force; however, after the fight with Shaman Niu, Che felt that he did not have such skill.

That Shaman Niu could not be regarded as an ordinary Shaman Master at all; his strength was at least at the level of a Shaman Grandmaster, or even a peak Shaman Grandmaster.

..…

On the other side, Yang Kai arrived back in his Tree Cave after communicating with the Evergreen Divine Tree through the green leaf he obtained. He then knocked on the trunk and called out loudly, “Senior Qing!”

A figure flashed in the Tree Cave, and the old man appeared leisurely, looking at him with a smile.

Yang Kai spared no time on nonsense, and blurted, “Many thanks, Senior, for your care for all these days. Just as the mountains are always lush and the rivers forever flow, we are bound to meet again someday in the future.”

The Frost and Snow Clan wanted him, not for his life, but for his abilities; however, Yang Kai did not want to lose his freedom, so he decided to quickly leave.

With his current strength, he could easily defeat a Shaman Grandmaster like Che, but if he had to fight against the entire Frost and Snow Clan, he would stand no chance. Now that he had alarmed the Shaman Kings, he had to quickly leave before it was too late.

Moreover, his purpose of coming to Frost and Snow City has been achieved. Now that he broke through to the Shaman Master Realm, it was better for him to go back to a remote place like Blue South Village. With the supplement of the million Monster Cores in his Space Ring, as long as he was given some time, he could be promoted rapidly. Then, when he was strong enough, the Frost and Snow Clan would not be able to keep him even if they wanted to.

While speaking, Yang Kai looked out of the Tree Cave. It was calm and peaceful outside, with people coming and going freely, completely unaware of what just happened in the palace.

But on second thought, it actually made sense. Yang Kai had used the green leaf to teleport here, so no matter how fast the Frost and Snow Clan reacted, they still needed some buffer time.

This buffer time was enough for Yang Kai to leave the territory of the Frost and Snow Clan and run as far as he could. Once he left their territory, the Frost and Snow Clan could do nothing about him.

“Don’t be in such a hurry!” Senior Qing raised his hand.

“What instructions does Senior have?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Senior Qing touched his beard and smiled, “I saw the Secret Art that you used for cultivation for the past few days and found it to be extremely bad. Do you want to change to a better set?”

Yang Kai was stunned, and replied joyously, “I want, of course I want!”

Previously, he also considered changing to a better Secret Art; after all, the Secret Art he had was taught to him by the Village Chief, so how good could it be? But when Yang Kai thought about it carefully, most of the Secret Arts of the Frost and Snow Clan focused on Ice Attributes, which was not necessarily suitable for him. Furthermore, he did not want to be too involved with the Frost and Snow Clan, so he did not ask them for anything. In any case, the way he cultivated was different from others so he just dealt with it even if his Secret Art was bad, believing he would find an opportunity to change it in the future.

Therefore, he was overjoyed when he heard Senior Qing’s offer. He did not expect such a helping hand would be extended at this moment.

After a pause though, Yang Kai asked seriously, “Senior, what can I do for you?”

Although he didn’t have much contact with Senior Qing, Yang Kai could see that the Elder in front of him was not someone who simply liked to give benefits to others for no reason. He was incredibly even-handed with his actions. If one wanted to live in a Tree Cave, they had to offer Monster Beast blood first, and after Yang Kai helped ‘scratch’ him, Senior Qing rewarded him with a green leaf. Perhaps this had something to do with Senior Qing being a blessing tree.

He was looking after the entire Frost and Snow Clan, and if he just granted everything that people wished for, his vitality and strength would have been extinguished long ago.

Therefore, even though Yang Kai was elated, he still asked in caution.

Senior Qing smiled faintly, “I do need a small favour from you.”

“Please name it!” Yang Kai waited respectfully.

Qing disclosed, “If I tell you that my predestined time is approaching, what would you think?”

Yang Kai was taken aback and secretly thought that the change in topic was a bit unexpected, and for a moment he had trouble keeping up with Senior Qing’s thoughts. However, after sweeping his eyes over Senior Qing, the corner of his mouth twitched and he replied, “Senior, don’t joke with me!”

Senior Qing laughed out loud, and did not continue on the topic. Instead, he remarked, “You’re a very strange person, a unique individual I have only seen once in my whole life, so I want to entrust you with something.”

“What is it?”

Senior Qing did not speak anymore and instead reached out his finger to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was surprised, but he knew that Senior Qing did not mean to do any harm to him, so he did not try to defend himself. When Senior Qing’s finger tapped on his forehead, Yang Kai felt like he had been hit by a huge mountain and for a moment, he was dazed as some exceptionally mysterious words appeared in his mind.

However, he could not see clearly what those words were given his current state. Everything within his sight turned black, and he fainted directly on the spot.

In the moment before he passed out though, Yang Kai felt he heard Senior Qing speaking.
