It was Murong Xiao Xiao who was talking. At this moment, she looked up at the sky while pointing her finger upwards, her small mouth opened slightly, with a surprised expression.

Following the direction she was pointing at, everyone looked up, dumbfounded.

They saw a stream of light piercing the sky, like a meteorite falling from the sky, creating gorgeous arcs, falling in a certain direction.

At first, there were only a few streams, but soon, the number of streams increased. At first glance, it looked like a meteor shower.

“Star Seals!” Lan Xun was shocked and screamed, “So many Star Seals?”

“What?” Xiao Chen, hearing this, was taken aback, “Princess, are you sure those are all Star Seals?”

Lan Xun stared at the sky. It was unknown what kind of Secret Technique she was using, but there was a flash of light in her eyes, as she nodded lightly. “There is no mistake, those are all Star Seals!”

Her voice fell, and there was a small *humph* from the side.

Everyone looked around and saw Wu Chang’s entire body turn into a red and white flash of light, flying in the direction where the Star Seals were falling.

He was quick to seize the opportunity. As soon as he heard that the things that fell from the sky were Star Seal, he immediately acted.

Behind him was Luo Yuan.

“Let’s go!” Xiao Bai Yi naturally was not slow to react, as he prompted in a soft but low voice. Thus, he and Murong Xiao Xiao hurried to catch up.

They had been in the Four Seasons Realm for two or three days, and they only encountered a single Star Seal in the Two Seasons Mountain Range. That Star Seal had been Branded on the forehead of a Monster Beast which they had severely injured before it ran away. After they caught up to it, they unexpectedly found all their effort just ended up being an opportunity for Yang Kai to easily pick it up; as though it had been ordered for him. This resulted in Luo Yuan and Wu Chang almost fighting over it.

With so many Star Seals appearing, even if everyone present divided them equally amongst themselves, it would still be enough for each person to receive six or seven Star Seals.

A Star Seal meant a voucher to enter Shattered Star Sea, which was of great significance to any Sect!

How could Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao dare be negligent?

“Princess...” Seeing everyone fly off as swift as the wind. Xiao Chen suddenly became anxious.

“Let’s go too!” Lan Xun naturally did not wish to miss such an opportunity and replied immediately.

Xiao Chen nodded, then joined with Lan Xun and flew towards the Star Seals as well.

However, as soon as the two set off, a boat-like flight type artifact appeared alongside them.

Lan Xun turned her head and saw Yang Kai calmly standing on the wooden boat, with an emotionless expression, with the wind whipping his black hair back.

Lan Xun could not help but sneer. After all, at this moment, Yang Kai’s image was vastly different from the cowardly and timid persona he gave before, and it seemed that he wanted to attract her attention.

She understood Yang Kai’s approach very well. Basically, few men could maintain their nature in front of her. Those people always tried to vie for her attention as if they could get some satisfaction from it.

“Huh!” Xiao Chen coldly snorted with a displeased expression.

Xiao Chen had long been displeased by Yang Kai, and at this moment, this guy was still shamelessly pretending to be cool, it was simply unbearable!

Yang Kai did not seem to notice what Xiao Chen was thinking. So, he continued to act casual while pretending to be puzzled, and rushed to Lan Xun and asked, “Hey, why would this Friend by your side call you a Princess? Is that your name or something?”

“Whose name would carry the word Princess?” Lan Xun lightly smiled, shook her head before reassuring, “You think too much.”

“Then... I don’t understand,” Yang Kai shook his head. “I think your temperament is extraordinary and elegant. You are obviously from a noble background. However, what does that have to do with ‘Princess’? Hey? Can’t you help me understand?”

Lan Xun frowned and couldn’t help but feel a little embarrassed. She couldn’t tell Yang Kai that she was the daughter of the Bright Moon Great Emperor. That’s why she was called a ‘Princess’. It was a bit braggy to say it though it was true.

She could only ask back. “I came from Star Soul Palace, can’t you make a guess?”

To her it was obvious. As long as someone had a bit of common sense, after hearing this sentence, they should be able to come to a conclusion, so she would avoid the need to answer.

But to her surprise, Yang Kai thought for a while, and solemnly shook his head.

Yang Kai’s ignorance made Xiao Chen on the side roll his eyes. He could not help but coldly snort, “Star Soul Palace is a Sect created by the Bright Moon Great Emperor, and this one in front of you is the jewel of the Great Emperor!”

“Huh?” Yang Kai was shocked and hesitated, “So you... you are the daughter of the Great Emperor?” He looked extremely shocked.

“Who my parents are doesn’t mean anything.” Lan Xun smiled slightly and seemed more approachable.

Meanwhile, Xiao Chen cursed. “Where did this frog come from? To think you’ve never heard of the name of our Princess, but still managed to enter the Four Seasons Realm. You are simply an embarrassment for the people of our generation! Princess, you should avoid interacting with this person!”

Yang Kai, embarrassed, explained, “I used to cultivate deep in the mountains, and I just came out for experience not long ago, so I don’t know much about things of the outside world... Heh heh, I don’t know much, but I have at least heard of the name Bright Moon Great Emperor.”

“So...” Lan Xun did not really know what to believe and expressed the same confusion, “It looks like you are the kind of cultivator who enters long retreats and cultivates really hard. It’s normal if you don’t know much about the outside world.”

“Princess, you are too polite, I’m just ignorant and uninformed.” Yang Kai scratched his cheek and said modestly.

“At least you still have a bit of self-awareness!” Xiao Chen continued.

“By the way, what is your name?” Lan Xun asked. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Xiao Chen immediately cut in. “Princess, why are you asking about this frog’s name? Don’t smear your ears!”

“What’s wrong with just asking?” Lan Xun frowned, apparently not wishing to be so close to Xiao Chen. If it weren’t for the Bright Moon Great Emperor, her father, ordering her, she wouldn’t be with Xiao Chen now. She preferred to act alone. For her, nothing was more joyous than having her own adventure. The excitement and unknown danger continued to stir her desire, making her unable to stop.

“I’m Yang Kai.”

Lan Xun nodded, suddenly showing a smile, “I have something I am uncertain about; I don’t know if Brother Yang would be able to enlighten me?”

Yang Kai’s eyes flickered, and he chuckled. “If the Princess has any questions, please say so. This Yang will do his best to answer!”

Lan Xun warned, “Brother Yang, you can’t speak so frivolously. The question I ask might be related to your secrets...”

[Humph, I just wanted to catch your attention! I’m afraid any man who wants to be with you would be willing to answer anything just to get you to have a good impression of him... after all, this little girl would not settle with just anyone!] Yang Kai thought in his heart, faintly guessing what exactly Lan Xun wanted to ask. So, there he was not afraid of the question. “Princess, if you are asking me something, it means that you are already giving me a lot of face. What can’t I say?”

As soon as this remark came out, Xiao Chen had a bad feeling. Although this little brat named Yang Kai was a wild brat that just recently came out of a forest in the deep mountains, he seemed to be well versed with the heart of women. He had just met the Princess and they hit it off so well! How could this be tolerated? Worst of all, the Princess, who was known to be scornful to men, had been dealing with this frog with a smile on her face!

Xiao Chen felt a sense of crisis in his heart, so he immediately cast a threatening look at Yang Kai, as if to say ‘I dare you to continue speaking to her.’

Due to his position with Lan Xun and the angle, it was impossible for Lan Xun to notice his gaze. Meanwhile, it was well within Yang Kai’s field of vision.

However, Yang Kai did not even spare him a glance. It was as though he was completely fascinated by Lan Xun. His whole view was only on the princess.

Xiao Chen felt a sense of powerlessness as he clenched his fist.

“Those two attacked you earlier. How did you manage to come out unscathed?” Lan Xun asked bluntly.

Indeed, as she said, this question was definitely related to Yang Kai’s secret. A First-Order Dao Source Realm that could come out unscathed under the attack of two Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivators. It must have been a powerful Secret Technique. Such a powerful Secret Technique would normally be kept under wraps, never spoken of casually.

So as soon as Lan Xun asked, Yang Kai immediately showed a look of embarrassment. He smiled and stammered: “That... haha... actually...”

“It’s fine... there is no need to speak of it. Just forget that I asked anything.” Lan Xun said.

Yang Kai sounded off. It was as if he was willing to share, but the stammering meant that it was still something he would rather not do.

If Yang Kai had been completely ‘infatuated’ by Lan Xun at this moment, would he hesitate? How could a man who was thinking with his nether region possibly refuse to answer a question from his beloved? Under those circumstances. Even if the man did not wish to speak, he would still speak.

Yang Kai sighed “It’s not that I can’t say it. But...”

At this point, he suddenly put on a solemn expression. At the same time, he lowered his voice. “Princess, you have to keep it a secret for me. If rumours of this Secret Technique were to spread, it will no longer work. I am afraid I will die next time I encounter this kind of situation.”

While he was talking, he deliberately moved towards Lan Xun and almost pressed his lips to her ear.

A scent of fragrance immediately lingered on the tip of his nose.

The two were too close, Lan Xun did not move to avoid him but her delicate ears suddenly turned red.

“What are you doing?” Seeing this scene, Xiao Chen could not bear it and started shouting aloud. He immediately pointed the sharp sword in his hand at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was taken aback, and quickly moved away from her, with an innocent look on his face, he asked, “I didn’t do anything! This friend, what is the meaning of this?”

“You just...” Xiao Chen wanted to explain but could not go on. After all, even though Yang Kai was a little closer to Lan Xun, he really did not do anything. If he really wanted to pursue this, he would seem too jealous. So, he could only give a warning. “Just stand there and speak. If you dare to lean in again, I will take your head!”

Yang Kai said in amazement, “This friend is really strange... Okay, then I will stand here and say it. Princess, please understand, my Secret Technique is called Universe Shifting Divine Art. Once it is used, I can borrow my opponent’s strength to defeat him. It’s how we use the weak to defeat the strong.”

“Take advantage of their strength?” Lan Xun looked surprised.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly, and said in a serious tone, “The two guys before both wanted to take my life, which is in line with the key points of Universe Shifting Divine Art, so I just...” Yang Kai grinned meaningfully, reached out and drew a semicircle, “Tweaked it a little bit and let them fight on their own.”

Lan Xun thoughtfully for a moment and asked “So, if only one person attacked you at that time...”

“Then I’d be dead!” Yang Kai shrugged.
