Chapter 5484: Your Little Brother is in Danger

Yang Kai had never used Purifying Light on such a huge scale. With the support of the Yin and Yang Elements of the two Small Stone Race armies, this Purifying Light seemed capable of illuminating the entire Chaotic Dead Territory.

The thick Black Ink Cloud began to rapidly evaporate under the brilliance of the pure white light, revealing the hidden Royal Lord whose face was filled with shock, obviously unable to understand what just happened.

The unstoppable Black Ink Strength that struck terror into the hearts of the Human Race and all other living beings was actually restrained by some other force!

The Royal Lord was immediately struck with panic.

Under the guidance of the Great Sun and Great Moon Marks, the two armies of different attributes interweaved together, chasing after each other in a circle like a giant millstone. Every time the Yin-Yang Millstone completed a circle, Black Ink Strength surrounding the Royal Lord’s body would be ground away.

As a large part of the energy was drained from the Small Stone Race members, they quickly shrunk back to their normal size.

The Royal Lord, on the other hand, increased the pace of his merciless onslaught. No Small Stone Race member was able to approach within a 100-kilometre radius of him, owing to his surging Black Ink Strength.

But after a short while, the Royal Lord felt his strength rapidly depleting. Only now did he catch sight of Yang Kai in the distance and understand that he was behind all of this.

This sent the Royal Lord into a frenzy. He let out a fierce roar as his Humanoid body suddenly ballooned into a hideous giant. The next moment, he forcefully broke out of the encirclement of the two Small Stone Race armies by relying on his profound strength and charged straight towards Yang Kai.

Be that as it may, his aura was unstable at the moment, clearly having taken a huge hit under the Purifying Light.

Nonetheless, Yang Kai had no intention of fighting him to the death. When he saw the Royal Lord break out of the encirclement, he simply turned around and ran while shouting, “Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, your Little Brother is in danger! Save me!”

The relentlessly pursuing Royal Lord furrowed his brow after hearing this. He had no idea what was so special about this ‘Big Brother Huang’ and ‘Big Sister Lan’ that Yang Kai was requesting for their help, but anger was now blinding him so the only thing on his mind was to catch Yang Kai and tear him to pieces to calm his rage.

In the Chaotic Dead Territory, it wasn’t just two armies that were fighting each other, there were in fact many other armies fighting each other as well.

These armies varied in size and numbers, ranging from a few thousand to even a few million. It was just that the two armies that Yang Kai saw just after entering the Chaotic Dead Territory were comparatively larger.

At first, Yang Kai was already surprised by the fact that Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan had raised armies like these two, but to his astonishment, he learned that what he saw was just a small part of their forces.

By the looks of it, the entire Chaotic Dead Territory was engulfed in the war of the Small Stone Race, rendering Yang Kai speechless at the sight.

Furthermore, every single Small Stone Race member would immediately stop and attack the Royal Lord the moment they sensed his aura.

Be that as it may, they were unable to stop the Royal Lord. Even if Yang Kai used their energy to create a mass of Purifying Light, he could only delay the pursuing Royal Lord for a moment, that was all.

Yang Kai had no intention of fighting the Royal Lord head-on so he kept rushing to the depths of the Chaotic Dead Territory, shouting non-stop.

Only when he suddenly felt two shocking auras approaching him did he finally stop and call out, his face beaming with joy, “Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, your Little Brother has come to see you!”

The pursuing Royal Lord behind Yang Kai also sensed the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer’s auras and his complexion immediately changed. Abruptly coming to a halt, he focused his senses for a moment before hurriedly turning around and fleeing.

Obviously, he had noticed the strength of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer and also understood why Yang Kai had lured him here. It was to seek help from these two beings.

However, just as the Royal Lord was trying to escape, a golden chain appeared behind him all of a sudden. The chain was emanating an extremely rich Yang Element aura; obviously, it was created from Big Brother Huang’s strength.

The chain wrapped around the Royal Lord like it had a mind of its own.

The Royal Lord was quite strong too and his Black Ink Strength surged as he tried to shake off the chains. But suddenly, a small head popped out of the chain. Who knows when Big Brother Huang hid in this chain, but when he did appear, he just lightly blew at the Royal Lord.

This action might have seemed ordinary, but it sent the Royal Lord tumbling through the void.

By the time he regained his balance, a little girl in a light blue dress happened to be standing in front of him, gazing down at him with an innocent and pure gaze.

Enraged, the Royal Lord punched straight at her.

The little girl raised her skirt with both hands and gently lifted her foot, kicking the oncoming fist lightly.

Oddly though, the little girl’s figure remained motionless while the Royal Lord was sent flying like an arrow fired from a bow.

The Royal Lord was completely terrified!

[Who the Hell are these two!?] Much to the Royal Lord’s shock, the two ‘Humans’ were tossing him like he was a piece of trash. What terrified the Royal Lord even more was the fact that he had a faint instinctual fear towards these two insignificant Humans.

The Royal Lord tried his best to regain his footing, but right then, Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan shot towards him, leaving two trails of light, one yellow and one blue. The two circled around the Royal Lord and at first, he could still make out their figures, but gradually, he lost sight of them as his vision filled with streaks of yellow and blue light slowly forming a huge net around him.

Yang Kai heard the Royal Lord’s roars and snarls.

The next moment, the yellow and blue colours fused together, transforming into a pure white light. Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan also simultaneously stopped and drifted away.

In Yang Kai’s sight, the Royal Lord’s figure was no longer visible, leaving only a white cocoon that was radiating a pure and gentle light.

This light had the same aura as the Purifying Light he used, but it was many, many times stronger and more intense than his own Purifying Light.

This wasn’t a surprise though, as Yang Kai condensed Purifying Light from mere remnants of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer’s strength, while this Purifying Light was directly condensed by the two supreme beings.

With a deafening bang, the cocoon of light exploded into countless wisps of light. As for the Royal Lord who should have been trapped in this cocoon of light, he simply vanished.

Yang Kai was even unable to sense remnants of his aura!

Yang Kai was bewildered at the sight of this as he inwardly praised Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan as truly being worthy of being the ancestor of all the Divine Spirits. Even a Master as strong as a Royal Lord was disposed of with ease by the two of them.

If he could persuade them to come forward, there would be no need to fear the Black Ink Clan again!

Yang Kai estimated that these two would even be able to kill the Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods without much difficulty.

Yang Kai then enthusiastically greeted the two, “Big Brother Huang, Big Sister Lan, long time no see. Your Little Brother has missed you very much all these years. Now that I’ve seen your noble bearing once more, this Little Brother’s longing for you has finally been quenched.”

Big Brother Huang completely disregarded his flattery as a furrow appeared at his brow and he asked, “Where did that foul thing come from?”

Big Sister Lan rebuked, pursing her lips, “Had you not been chased by him, why would you even think of us? You didn’t even come to play with us all these years. I think you must have forgotten about us.”

Yang Kai put on an earnest look as he defended himself, “Of course not, your Little Brother has been thinking about you two day and night ever since we parted. Unfortunately, this Little Brother was dispatched to a distant battlefield and was unable to return. However, the moment I came back, I immediately came here to see you.”

Big Brother Huang lightly snorted, “You also brought an enemy with you and asked for our help, am I right?”

Yang Kai stated, embarrassed, “Little Brother’s skills are lacking. As I was not his opponent, I had no choice but to turn to you. It’s only natural for Big Brothers and Big Sisters to take care of their Little Brothers.”

Yang Kai’s face was filled with flattery when he was in front of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer, which suddenly made him realize how Chen Tian Fei must have felt when facing him.

[That Fatty is still quite good, I should treat him better when I return and stop trying to scare him…]

Big Brother Huang stated, waving off, “Forget it, we Big Brother and Little Sister can’t win against you in a war of wor…”

Before he could finish, the nearby Big Sister Lan shouted, “Big Brother and Little Sister? Humph! It’s Big Sister and Little Brother!”

Big Brother Huang shot a disdainful glance at her, “Wait until you have defeated me in this battle. We are Big Brother and Little Sister until it is over.”

Big Sister Lan suddenly became a little dispirited and depressed. Apparently, she had lost the last round.

As someone who had accompanied these two for a few years, Yang Kai was not surprised by this familiar sight.

Big Brother Huang then turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Tell me, what made you come here this time?” Before Yang Kai could say anything, he interrupted, “Don’t say it’s because you really missed us.”

Yang Kai first smiled in embarrassment before he quickly cupped his fist and requested, “The Black Ink Clan has invaded the 3,000 Worlds and is about to wreak havoc upon all the innocents living in it. Little Brother earnestly requests you two descend the mountain and help resolve the Human Race’s crisis!”

Big Brother Huang slightly frowned, “The Black Ink Clan? Like the one who died just now?”

Yang Kai nodded his affirmation, “Indeed. He was a Royal Lord of the Black Ink Clan, equivalent to a Human Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“How many Royal Lords like him are there?”

Yang Kai answered, “Originally, there were 200 or so, but now there are only a few dozen left. But the biggest danger posed by the Black Ink Clan is not how many Royal Lords they have, but rather the unique characteristics of their Black Ink Strength. You two must have seen it, so you should know how peculiar it is.”

Big Brother Huang nodded his acknowledgement.

Yang Kai continued, “The Black Ink Clan uses something called Black Ink Nests to create more clansmen. So long as they have ample resources, they can keep creating more soldiers. Originally, the Humans tried to eliminate them on the Black Ink Battlefield, but unfortunately, we were defeated and our defences were breached a year ago. Now, the Black Ink Clan has broken through the boundary walls and invaded the 3,000 Worlds. If we don’t find a way to stop them, the Human Race will be finished and we will have no place left in this world! The Humans can take care of the Black Ink Clan Army, but the Black Ink Clan has two Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods, whose strength is too much for us. Unless Big Brother and Big Sister take action, there will be no way to stop them.”

Having finished speaking, Yang Kai cupped his fist again, “I earnestly request that the two of you come out of seclusion and save the 3,000 Worlds, saving the Human Race from this crisis!”

Big Brother Huang let out a long sigh, “Things have become so grim?”

Yang Kai nodded, “It will only get worse from here.”

When he escaped from Wind Mist Territory, the passageway had already been fully opened. A year had already passed by now, so he had no idea about the situation in the 3,000 Worlds.

Big Sister Lan, who had been silent all this time, suddenly stated, “But we can’t leave here.”

Yang Kai was taken aback, “Even now?”

Big Sister Lan explained, “Since you know our identities, I believe you’ve also heard the rumours about us from the Humans, and those rumours are not exaggerated. We are physical representations of death and destruction. We’ve told you this before. It’s fine if we are in the Chaotic Dead Territory as it has no vitality… but wherever we go, every place will become part of the Chaotic Dead Territory.”

Naturally, Yang Kai had heard of these rumours before and understood what the consequences of them taking action would be.

Big Brother Huang heaved a long sigh, “Originally, the Chaotic Dead Territory wasn’t so big, it was only the size of an ordinary Great Territory, but later it became this…”
