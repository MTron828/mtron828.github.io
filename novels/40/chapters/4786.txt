“Is there some kind of special Secret Technique required for the transformation?” Yang Kai boldly speculated.

Li Yuan Wang shook his head in response, “The transformation is not caused by the use of a Secret Technique. On the contrary, you have to cultivate a specific Secret Art from the beginning. This Secret Art does not have powerful properties, so there are no advantages in a battle against others. However, it allows the cultivator to transform their Small Universe into a Small Source World at the time of their death. Of course, it is not that simple. The birth of a Small Source World is a very complicated process. It can be said that the cultivator has to pay a lifetimes’ worth of hard work for their efforts to succeed.”

Yang Kai understood, “Sect Master, do you mean that from the very beginning, these people cultivated for the sole purpose of transforming their Small Universe into a Small Source World after their deaths?”

Li Yuan Wang nodded solemnly, “Nobody forced them. They were aware of their future destiny when they first cultivated this Secret Art.”

Yang Kai was slightly stunned by those words.

After cultivating hard for a lifetime, their Small Universe would eventually be transformed into a Small Source World after their deaths to become a training place for others. That would require a great amount of dedication and a strong sense of belonging to one’s Sect.

While achieving such a feat might be as difficult as ascending to the Heavens for any other great force, it would not be difficult to find such disciples among the Cave Heavens and Paradises that boasted an inheritance of countless years. What’s more, cultivating this special Secret Art would not cause any harm to the disciples. It was just that they might suffer some disadvantages in battle. That was because the Secret Art was unsuited for combat; it was only suitable for cultivation.

“The formation of a Small Source World is not an easy feat, and not every attempt will succeed.” Li Yuan Wang explained, “Most of the time, among all the people who cultivate this Secret Art, only one out of ten can successfully produce a Small Source World. I’m sure you understand why the Small Source Worlds are so precious even to the Cave Heavens and Paradises now.”

Yang Kai nodded.

On a fundamental level, a Small Source World was the Universe Paradise or Universe Cave Heaven left behind after the death of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master.

How many years would it take for a cultivator to grow from an ignorant child to a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master before finally reaching the end of their life? Despite such a long wait, there was only a 10% chance of producing a Small Source World in the end. How could a Small Source World not be precious?

Yang Kai suddenly thought of something, “If that’s the case, does that mean all the living beings in the Small Source World are real?”

Li Yuan Wang nodded, “Of course! The disciples who cultivate this Secret Art will never participate in battle; hence, they will start raising living beings in their bodies to form the World Principles in their Small Universe as soon as they advance into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm and their Small Universe transforms from immaterial to material. The prosperity of those living inside would be enough to guarantee that the World Force of the Small Source World would continue to increase even after their deaths. Moreover, the various rules decided by the Master before his death will become the goal of the disciples who enter the Small Source World in the future. By achieving this goal, their training will be completed successfully. The disciples will then obtain the recognition of the Small Source World’s World Principles and receive great benefits!”

Yang Kai revealed a look of understanding.

The rule of the Divine Armament World, which he entered for training previously, was to obtain one of the Ten Divine Armaments. In the end, he went overboard and took three in one go which resulted in a huge loss to the heritage of the Divine Armament World.

When he came out of the Divine Armament World, the Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Ancestor overseeing it had seemed quite upset with him. That was because the results of his training were equivalent to depleting the training opportunities of several disciples! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He finally understood why he was not rejected by the people when he first entered the Divine Armament World. On the contrary, they had accepted his presence as a matter of course. It was all thanks to the effects of the Small Source World’s World Principles, and these rules were formulated by the Master of the Small Source World before his death.

“Generally speaking, most of the Small Source Worlds that belong to the Cave Heavens and Paradises are founded upon Universe Paradises. There are very few Small Source Worlds produced from Universe Cave Heavens,” Li Yuan Wang continued, “A Universe Paradise is the legacy left behind after the death of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so it is open to any Open Heaven Realm below the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm for training and benefits. On the other hand, a Universe Cave Heaven is the legacy left behind after the death of an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. That is why only Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters are eligible to enter.”

Yang Kai understood.

For a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, as long as one advanced directly into the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm when they advanced into the Open Heaven Realm, then they would eventually reach the limits of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm after countless years of cultivation. Such disciples could be found in abundance in the Cave Heavens and Paradises.

On the other hand, it was different when it came to those who could cultivate to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm. They would be the Core Disciples of the Sect, like Gu Pan. Disciples with such aptitude would eventually become the pillars of their respective Sects if they developed fully, so how could their Sects be willing to let them cultivate this special Secret Art?

Nevertheless, there would always be exceptions to everything. Some of the chosen disciples might not have shown outstanding aptitude when they were young, but as they cultivated, their talents shone brighter and brighter. Therefore, it became possible for them to advance directly into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. In due course, these disciples would reach the end of their lifespans after advancing into the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm, leaving behind Small Source Worlds on the rank of Universe Cave Heavens.

In this vast universe where 108 Cave Heavens and Paradises existed, there were hundreds of Small Source Worlds. Be that as it may, there were apparently less than ten Cave Heavens and Paradises with Small Source Worlds on the level of a Universe Cave Heaven.

The cultivation of the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in these ten or so Cave Heavens and Paradises that owned the Small Source Worlds on the rank of a Universe Cave Heaven would progress much faster than the other Cave Heavens and Paradises. Over time, the birth of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would slowly increase in number and frequency. Heritage was something that was accumulated over countless years after all.

“That can’t be all…” Yang Kai suddenly remembered something, “If that was really the case, then what is with the flow of time in the Small Source Worlds?”

Only two months had passed during his training in the Divine Armament World, but the time he actually spent in the Divine Armament World was more than several dozen years! The flow of time in the Small Source World was far too different compared to the outside world.

It had to be said that Yang Kai had already reached the sixth level of the Dao of Time, Exceeding the Ordinary to Reach the Extraordinary; even so, he only managed to double the flow of time in his Small Universe compared to the outside world. It was impossible for those who cultivate this special Secret Art to be better than him in the Dao of Time, let alone be better than him by several times! Seeing as the Universe Paradise or Universe Cave Heaven was the essence of the Small Source World, there was no explanation for this accelerated flow of time.

“Every Cave Heaven and Paradise has pondered this question before, but there has been no clear answer so far.”

Yang Kai frowned and asked, “Who created this Secret Art?”

Li Yuan Wang replied, “It was handed down since ancient times. This Secret Art is something that has existed even before the Cave Heavens and Paradises were formed. Even now, the Cave Heavens and Paradises are simply learning from the wisdom of the past.”

It turned out that the Secret Art had been handed down since ancient times, during an era where too much time had passed for anything to be verified. Yang Kai suddenly felt extremely troubled. He recently encountered many things that came from an era far in the distant past. That was true for the Black Ink Giant Spirit God in the Black Ink Sealing Land, the Black Ink Clan, and even this special Secret Art.

“Although nobody has a definite answer, judging from the results, it would seem that cultivating the Secret Art would indeed cause the flow of time in their Small Universe to increase greatly after they advance into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm. That was an improvement of ten or even tens of times!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up when he heard those words, “Is there really such a good thing!?”

If that was truly the case, then that would truly be a huge help to the Open Heaven Realm Masters; after all, Yang Kai could already feel the benefits even though the flow of time in his Small Universe was only twice the speed of the outside world. Those raised in his Small Universe would produce World Force, and under the same circumstances, Yang Kai was experiencing double the benefits compared to others in similar situations. It was only natural that his growth would also be much faster.

Speaking of which, there were not many people like him in this vast universe who could raise living beings in their Small Universe without any worries. There was no need to even speak of the Sixth-Order and Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had no such qualifications, and the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters barely had any either. Only the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would try to raise living beings in their Small Universe and even then very few did.

“Do you think it’s a good thing?” Li Yuan Wang glanced at Yang Kai with a strange half-smile.

“Could it be that there’s a disadvantage?” Yang Kai frowned.

Li Yuan Wang sighed, “Those who cultivate this Secret Art are generally short-lived. Compared to their Fellow Brothers in the same Realm, their lifespans tend to become very short after they advance into the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Thanks to the influence of the Secret Art, the flow of time in their Small Universe also affects them.”

Yang Kai was stunned by those words.

“If an ordinary person lives for a year, then that same span of time is equivalent to tens or several tens of years to them. How could they live a long life under such circumstances?”

The time they experienced themselves was equivalent to the flow of time in their Small Universe. That was very different from what Yang Kai experienced where the flow of time in his Small Universe might be double the ordinary speed, but that was due to his comprehension of the Dao of Time so there was no harm done to him.

“In this world, it is very rare for only benefits to exist. Nothing in this world is perfect!” Li Yuan Wang sighed once more.

Just like the Black Ink Strength, that was something that could break through the shackles of the Open Heaven Realm that had been in place since ancient times and allowed the cultivator to advance infinitely without regard for their own limitations. Unfortunately, those corrupted by the Black Ink Strength would turn into another person altogether. That was the same for this special Secret Art. Even though the Secret Art could increase the flow of time in their Small Universe by several times, the Secret Art would consume the cultivator’s lifespan in exchange.

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before he spoke, “Sect Master, can I have a look at this Secret Art?”

Li Yuan Wang turned to look at Yang Kai, “Do you plan to cultivate the Secret Art? That’s not a good idea.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I only want to have a look. Allow me to speak truthfully, Sect Master, I know a little bit about the Dao of Time and may be able to gain something from the Secret Art.”

Li Yuan Wang was extremely shocked, “Do you also dabble in the Dao of Time?”

Yang Kai’s proficiency in the Dao of Space was something Li Yuan Wang knew well. In the training that riled up hundreds of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise, Yang Kai would not have been much of an opponent if he had not been proficient in the Dao of Space, regardless of his strength. It was precisely because of his proficiency in the Dao of Space that all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Lang Ya Paradise had been twisted around his finger.

If the Dao of Space was difficult to cultivate though, then the Dao of Time was even more so!

[It’s bad enough that this brat is proficient in the Dao of Space, but he also dabbles in the Dao of Time!? Just what kind of freak is he!?] Despite living for so long and having seen so many things during that time, Li Yuan Wang could not help feeling shocked at this moment. Looking Yang Kai up and down for a moment, he suddenly blurted out, “There’s nothing great about Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Why don’t you become the Young Master of Lang Ya Paradise instead!?”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes immediately, “You must be joking, Sect Master.”

Li Yuan Wang replied seriously, “I’m not joking. The entire Lang Ya Paradise knows that you abandoned Xiao Pan’er after thoughtless sleeping with her. I’m afraid it will be difficult for her to find a Dao Partner in the future. You need to take responsibility for your actions.”

Yang Kai turned to leave, “Forget it. I’m sure Yin-Yang Cave Heaven has this Secret Art too. I’ll go and ask them instead.”

Li Yuan Wang immediately grabbed Yang Kai by the arm, “Calm down! We can always talk things out peacefully.”

Yang Kai turned around, “Who is the one acting unreasonably?”

“Fine fine!” Li Yuan Wang waved his hand dismissively, “Let’s leave the matter regarding Xiao Pan’er aside for now. You can take a look at the Secret Art, but I have a condition.”
