Chapter 2201, Don’t Do Won’t Die

Yang Kai’s expression eased significantly after hearing this.

Xiao Yu Yang added with a serious expression, “Just so you know, this King did not wait here just to try to steal your Spirit Pills! It’s just... an ordinary man is innocent, but treasures make one guilty, you should understand my meaning. With your cultivation level, if you secretly retained any Extraordinary Treasure Pills, you’d only be attracting endless trouble to yourself.”

Yang Kai nodded and answered, “Junior understands. Many thanks for considering my situation, Senior Xiao.”

He knew that even though Xiao Yu Yang was offering up a pleasant-sounding excuse, his true objective was still to steal his Extraordinary Treasure Pills. Well, perhaps ‘steal’ wasn’t the best word to use, as Xiao Yu Yang would definitely compensate him.

But even so... Xiao Yu Yang was correct. Since if Yang Kai really did have extra Extraordinary Treasure Pills in his possession, his future days would be extremely dark and dangerous. He didn’t need to fear Dao Source Realm cultivators, but what about Emperors?

Although it was true that Emperor Realm Masters couldn’t use these Extraordinary Treasure Pills personally, which Emperor didn’t have disciples or relatives? An Extraordinary Treasure Pill would still be extremely attractive to them.

At that time, countless Emperor Realm Masters would definitely hear the news and swarm him to try to rob him...

But now, it was proven that all of Yang Kai’s Extraordinary Treasure Pills had been used up, and Xiao Yu Yang and five other Emperor Realm Masters were present to serve as witnesses to this.

It was likely that nobody would try to make trouble for Yang Kai in order to rob Extraordinary Treasure Pills from him in the future.

In a sense, Yang Kai should actually be thanking Xiao Yu Yang for this.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s Space Ring had reached Gao Xue Ting’s hands while the other five had finished their own inspection, not finding much of use. As such, Gao Xue Ting didn’t even bother searching his Space Ring and simply tossed it back to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai put on his ring again before looking at Xiao Yu Yang and saying, “If Senior Xiao has nothing else to say... then this Junior will take his leave first.”

“Good!” Xiao Yu Yang gently nodded, but in the next moment his expression changed as he commented, “This King has some advice for you, if you’re willing to hear it?”

“It would be Junior’s honour to receive advice from Senior Xiao!” Yang Kai hurriedly adopted a serious expression.

Xiao Yu Yang’s expression became much warmer when he saw how accepting Yang Kai was as he quickly said, “You won’t be able to swallow everything if you try to eat too much!”

Yang Kai arched his brow as a contemplative expression appeared on his face before he cupped his fists and said, “Many thanks, Senior Xiao, for the reminder, this Junior will take this lesson to heart.”

“That would be best. Good, you may leave,” Xiao Yu Yang waved his hand.

Only then did Yang Kai head towards where the Azure Sun Temple’s disciples were gathered as he found a place to sit down.

Currently, many cultivators were gathered together in groups, mainly with their respective Sects and families, as they rested in the nameless mountain valley.

But when counting the people here, they had decreased in number by more than a third compared to thirty-three days ago. The cultivators who weren’t here now had obviously met some bad end in the Four Seasons Realm.

In this land, every Sealed World and every trial ground would have risks along with opportunities, and every cultivator’s path of growth would wander between life and death...

This was a fate that every cultivator had to face, one that was absolutely inescapable!

Cultivation was about survival of the fittest, and only the strongest would remain after the filtering out by an unforgiving world.

As Yang Kai rested, Bian Yu Qing and Kou Wu came to say their goodbyes to him.

They were the only two from Blue Feather Sect who came to the Four Seasons Realm this time and could be considered lucky as despite not obtaining many opportunities or reaping too big a harvest, they had at least both managed to return safely.

Since the Four Seasons Realm was about to close, the two of them would naturally return to Blue Feather Sect.

Yang Kai chatted with them for a while and then watched them leave.

He didn’t waste his energy on telling Bian Yu Qing to not tell Wu Meng Shan about him, because he knew that Bian Yu Qing would definitely go back and tell everything about her experience to Wu Meng Shan, meaning that Wu Meng Shan would learn about his information.

Yang Kai was still rather wary of Wu Meng Shan.

But for now, he could only resolve to absolutely not meet that old bat until he became strong enough, otherwise, he might fall prey to Wu Meng Shan’s tricks.

About one hour later, the Heavens and Earth shook as the nameless mountain valley’s light door suddenly vanished. The Four Seasons Realm had completely closed itself off now, and only the Heavens knew when it would open again.

The Four Seasons Realm experience was completely over now and many cultivators from various Sects and families began to leave. Gao Xue Ting talked to Xiao Yu Yang for a while longer before she summoned her ship that took the Azure Sun Temple’s disciples back.

The Azure Sun Temple didn’t suffer many losses. Apart from the outsider Yang Kai, nineteen disciples had come this time, and only four were missing now.

This amount of loss was far less than the average, so it was acceptable to Gao Xue Ting.

Regardless, some of them had still died, so the disciples were in low spirits on the way back. Most simply sat in silence as they took inventory of their harvest from the Four Seasons Realm.

Suddenly, Yang Kai heard Gao Xue Ting calling out to him. Hurriedly opening his eyes, he saw that Elder Gao of the Azure Sun Temple had her back to him as she stood at the bow of the ship. Elder Gao’s long hair and sleeves fluttered in the wind as she seemed to be gazing at the distant scenery, her elegant posture adding a hint of noble beauty to this place.

Yang Kai didn’t dare to be rude as he hurriedly walked towards her.

He stood not far behind her, cupped his fists, and asked, “Elder Gao, do you have some instruction for me?”

Gao Xue Ting stayed silent for a time before suddenly saying, “Do you understand the meaning of Senior Xiao’s last words to you?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment before replying, “What Senior Xiao meant was that I should choose one between the Martial Dao and Alchemic Dao to focus on.”

“Indeed!” Gao Xue Ting nodded lightly before she turned her beautiful face towards him, her eyes flashing as she stared at Yang Kai before she opened her red lips slightly to say, “You have extraordinary aptitude for both the Martial Dao and Alchemic Dao, and in time you will definitely become tremendously successful in one of these two domains. Perhaps you’ll even reach a height that I am unable to, but... one’s time and strength are always limited. If you choose to pursue the peak of the Martial Dao, you will have to abandon the Alchemic Dao, and vice versa, it is impossible for you to concentrate on both of these domains. Senior Xiao spoke, thinking for your sake.”

“Junior understands,” Yang Kai nodded with a serious expression.

“It’s good that you understand... There’s nothing else I need to say.”

“Then Junior shall take his leave,” Yang Kai bowed slightly.

He was rather surprised that Gao Xue Ting had called for him just for this.

However, he was rather touched, as Gao Xue Ting showed care for him despite him not being a disciple of Azure Sun Temple. It would have been impossible for her to tell him all this if she didn’t care.

Yang Kai had just turned around when he suddenly heard her speaking from behind, “Those Extraordinary Treasure Pills... are there really none left?”

Yang Kai hurriedly turned around again, but saw that Gao Xue Ting had her back to him and wasn’t moving at all, as if she wasn’t the one who said those words.

Yang Kai stood where he was and furrowed his brow as he thought. Not daring to say another word, he could only return to his spot and sit down cross-legged again.

[Has this woman realized something? A woman’s intuition is truly frightening...]

Several days slowly passed by...

On this day, a beautiful ship arrived at the Azure Sun Mountain Range, and all the Dao Source Realm cultivators standing onboard had recovered from the gloom of losing their companions by now. Everyone stood up as they stared out at the familiar scenery below them.

“Wahahaha... I, Xia Sheng, have returned!” Xia Sheng had his hands on his hips as he laughed loudly, as if wanting to make sure everyone knew he had returned, his voice echoing above the mountains as the ship proceeded forward.

His voice was so loud that the Azure Sun Temple disciples moving around below all immediately raised their heads.

“Can you not act more mature?” Xiao Bai Yi coldly glared at him with an expression of disdain.

“Xiao Bai, you should be happy to return home, so here, come shout together with your Senior Brother...” Xia Sheng walked over to Xiao Bai Yi’s side and grasped the latter’s shoulder as he spoke.

“Who would want to shout with you...?” A vein started bulging on Xiao Bai Yi’s forehead.

“So embarrassing!” Murong Xiao Xiao’s face reddened.

“Hmph!” Xiao Bai Yi coldly snorted as he gave Xia Sheng a sidelong glance while saying, “Look at other Sects’ Eldest Senior Brothers like Wu Chang and Luo Yuan! All of them are cold and calm, giving their Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters a sense of reliability, but what about you? You act like a clown every day! How did someone like you actually become the Eldest Senior Brother?”

“So you wanted a cold and cool Senior Brother?” Xia Sheng suddenly adopted a serious expression as a chill emanated from his eyes, his smiling expression instantly being replaced with a domineering glare that seemed to say that none below Heaven were his equal.

At this moment, Xia Sheng’s aura changed tremendously.

“Other Senior Brothers can do it, so this Senior Brother... can naturally do it as well!” He quickly said while acting all serious.

Murong Xiao Xiao was stunned at the sight. Her small mouth formed a circle as she covered her mouth with her small hand as her beautiful eyes trembled.

“Do you feel like I’m reliable now...” Xia Sheng looked directly at her while asking in a deep and masculine voice, “Do you want to abandon everything without care and jump into this Senior Brother’s wide chest and solid arms?”

Murong Xiao Xiao pursed her red lips and cautiously answered, “Senior Brother, your killing intent... is leaking...”

“Stop messing around!” Gao Xue Ting gave Xia Sheng a sidelong glance while lightly stating, “The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree! Stop learning from our Temple Master, otherwise, you won’t be able to find a woman in the future.”

“Really?” Xia Sheng seemed as if he had suddenly been struck by lightning, taking major damage and breaking out into a cold sweat as he muttered, “En... other Sect Masters all have wives and countless concubines, but our Temple Master is still old and single...”

His face paled as if he had seen something incredibly frightening before raising his head to Gao Xue Ting and saying, “Elder Gao, Temple Master is so pitiful, so have you ever considered... ahh, again!?”

Before he could finish, Gao Xue Ting suddenly swung her sleeve and immediately tossed him off the ship. As the ship flew off, Xia Sheng’s pitiful wails could be heard from the distance.

“Don’t do, won’t die!” Xiao Bai Yi didn’t sympathize with him one bit, even coldly snorting at the sight.

Murong Xiao Xiao was actually worried and turned around while intending to beg for mercy for Xia Sheng, but when she saw Gao Xue Ting’s terrifying expression, she instantly swallowed her words back down.
