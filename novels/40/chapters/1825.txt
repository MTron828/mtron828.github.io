“Thank you very much, Sir.” Yang Kai cupped his fists and bowed slightly, but then narrowed his eyes and said calmly, “But... I choose neither.”

“You are courting death!” The figure’s face blackened in rage as his murderous intent surged.

Although that man scolded Yang Kai fiercely, he had no intention of attacking Yang Kai. He just kept glaring at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai immediately broke into laughter. “In that case, Sir, please kill me!”

Yang Kai looked as if he wasn’t afraid of death. He kept provoking the man.

The figure’s face blackened in anger.

“What’s wrong!? You don’t dare to... or you can’t!?” Yang Kai’s glare suddenly became as sharp as a sword, trying to pierce straight into that figure’s heart to see through his lie and truth.

But the figure remained as stable as a mountain.

Yang Kai’s voice grew heavier as he sneered again and again, “Perhaps if it was your true body here, I would not have a chance to resist. I might not know how strong you are, but a cultivator of my level should not be able to resist you. Even still, a trivial wisp of Soul wants me to surrender without a fight? Are you an idiot? This is my Knowledge Sea, I am the master here!”

Just as he said this, the calm sea below them suddenly started to swell as thick water columns rose from the sea, one after another. It gave the impression of an evil dragon waking up from its sleep. The Knowledge Sea was suddenly filled with intense murderous intention.

The figure slowly took a deep breath and looked at Yang Kai indifferently. He finally nodded his affirmation and praised, “Kid, you really are extraordinary, it looks like this King underestimated you. Now that you have seen through everything, this King has no excuse. Kid, you better take care of your life, this King will come for you. You better not die before that.”

Having said this, he suddenly formed some mysterious seals with his hands as his figure started to slowly fade away.

“You want to leave!?” Yang Kai shouted furiously. “This is my Knowledge Sea, it’s not your own backyard where you can come and go as you like!”

All of a sudden, a dazzling golden glow bloomed in Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea as the Demon Eye of Annihilation emerged over the Knowledge Sea, shooting the golden light of annihilation straight down at the figure and enveloping him inside.

The fading figure solidified as if it was imprisoned by the golden light of annihilation.

The figure furrowed his brow as he wondered suspiciously, “What kind of power is this!? How strange!? It’s actually dispersing my wisp of Soul!”

Suddenly, his body jolted, scattering the golden light of annihilation. The man then kept retreating, again and again. Yang Kai was unable to get close to him.

ROAR ROAR ROAR...

At this moment, dozens of evil dragons formed by the energy of Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea swarmed at the figure from all directions, biting at him viciously.

An extremely solemn look immediately appeared on the figure’s face. He then drew a semi-circle before him as a curtain of light appeared around his Soul Phantom to protect him.

BANG BOOM BANG...

The evil dragons crashed into the curtain of light with deafening claps. Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea momentarily shook, and even his Soul Avatar grew extremely weak.

It was a head-on confrontation between Souls. No matter who won and who lost, Yang Kai and that man would be severely injured.

Yang Kai didn’t come out scot-free but neither did that figure, it too paid an equal price. This wasn’t ordinary Spiritual Energy but the power of mutated fire-attribute Divine Sense. He might not have been annihilated under this wave of attack but that scorching power was burning his Soul; he was in great pain.

After having resisted dozens of dragon attacks, the figure started to grow transparent as if it might collapse any moment. Moreover, a scorching-hot energy could be vaguely seen coursing through the figure, eroding his Soul power continuously.

“Great, you are really good!” The figure greeted his teeth as he glared at Yang Kai in anger. “A trivial ant actually dares to harm this King’s Soul Phantom. This King has noted this and will make you pay a hundred times for this someday!”

Just as he finished speaking, he formed some seals again as his figure completely faded from Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea.

However, Yang Kai vaguely noticed him throw a seal into his Knowledge Sea before leaving.

After three breaths, the turmoil in his Knowledge Sea slowly calmed down.

A pale Yang Kai stood there carefully sensing the entirety of his Knowledge Sea. That mysterious figure had already left. There was no doubt in this as there was no aura of him.

[But... What seal did he leave before he left? Where is it hiding?] Yang Kai couldn’t sense it at all.

A deep sense of powerlessness rose in his heart, making Yang Kai extremely uncomfortable.

[However, that was just a Soul Phantom, perhaps just a wisp of that man’s Divine Sense, but that guy can come and go in my Knowledge Sea as he likes. Even a Third-Order Origin King can’t do this.]

[That guy should be on par with Yang Yan and Insect Emperor!?]

What Yang Kai was sure of was that he, Yang Yan, and Insect Emperor came from the same place. And that place was called Star Boundary! It was something of higher-level than Star Field.

There were two things Yang Kai was concerned about. The First was that he paid great attention to the Soul Warming Lotus in Yang Kai’s knowledge. He was even more excited at the sight of Star Chart than when he saw the Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus.

[What’s the secret of this Star Chart!?] Yang Kai was extremely puzzled.

Since he got this Star Chart, Yang Kai had only used it to identify his bearing, he hadn’t found any other use. [But that guy cared so much about this Star Chart. He yearned for it more than the Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus. Perhaps there is some secret about it that I am unaware of.]

The second was the Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus.

Much to Yang Kai’s surprise, that figure said that the Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus could be evolved into Supreme Soul Warming Lotus.

Yang Kai always believed the seven-coloured form to be the final form of the Soul Warming Lotus. It never occurred to him that it had even higher form!

This Soul Warming Lotus had brought great benefits to Yang Kai. The reason why his Spiritual Energy was so strong, not the least bit weaker than a Third-Order Origin King’s, was all due to the constant warming of his Soul by this precious heaven and earth treasure.

The seven-coloured form of the Soul Warming Lotus had already given Yang Kai untold benefits. If it evolved again... Yang Kai’s heart was beating crazily in excitement.

He had gained a lot of information just having talked with that figure for such a short while. He failed to come to his senses for a long time.

After a full fifteen minutes, Yang Kai finally dispelled the distracting thoughts in his heart. He then dispersed his Soul Avatar as his Divine Sense returned to his body.

He glanced back and noticed a pale Mu Wu sitting by his side, motionless. Apparently, abolishing his cultivation had caused his vitality to weaken.

Even those Origin Returning Realm masters hadn’t moved an inch. After having seen Yang Kai cripple Mu Wu without even breaking a sweat, how could they dare to have other thoughts!? They didn’t dare to escape, even if Yang Kai was standing still; they were afraid of angering Yang Kai and causing their own doom.

Only at this moment did they notice Yang Kai look at them, and these Origin Returning Realm masters were struck with panic. Each of them forced a smile that looked worse than crying.

“Young Hero, please give us a chance to live. We were also forced by Mu Wu. We had no choice but to help a tyrant oppress the innocents. We are regretting it now and hope that Young Hero will give us a chance to live. We will listen to Young Hero’s order from now on. We will not even hesitate even if we have to climb a mountain of blades or tread through a sea of fire!” One of them begged quickly.

As soon as he took the lead, the others also voiced their own difficulties. They accused Mu Wu for being overbearing and brutal. They cast their relationship with the Spirit Devouring Sect aside and pushed all the blame on Mu Wu.

Pu...

The already weakened Mu Wu was so angered by this that he could not help but spurt a mouthful of blood. He died right then and there.

Yang Kai coldly looked at their ugly faces. He was already feeling worse because of the mess made by that figure. How could he bear to listen to their bullshit? A golden flash of light illuminated this dim space as Golden Blood Threads shot out from Yang Kai, taking their lives instantly.

Afterwards, Yang Kai picked up their Space Rings and went through them, one by one. He found nearly a hundred Spirit Devouring Crystals from their Space Ring.

He placed all the Spirit Devouring Crystals by the Star Source and formed some seals before pointing at the crystals.

BOOM...

All the Spirit Devouring Crystals burst with a muffled explosion, releasing a tide of World Energy that spread in all directions.

From the start, the energy in these Spirit Devouring Crystals belonged to Tong Xuan Realm, Yang Kai was just returning it to where it belonged. Soon, the World Energy of his homeland would improve. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

After having done all this, he summoned the Sealed World Bead and entered it, letting Xiao Xiao take it back to the surface.

At this same time, on a Cultivation Star billions of miles away from Tong Xuan Realm, a man was sitting in a cross-legged position in a valley rich in World Energy. He sat there as if he was blended into heaven and the earth. Even a Third-Order Origin King would fail to sense his existence if he hadn’t laid his eyes on him.

Butterflies were dancing around him. A bird was even sitting on top of his head, gracefully combing its feathers with its beak.

As far as the bird was concerned, standing on top of this person’s head was no different than standing on an ordinary branch.

This person’s understanding of the Martial Dao had surpassed the entire Star Field, reaching the rumoured Self-Existing Dao Realm.

If those so-called Third-Order Origin Kings saw this, they would immediately kowtow in worship.

The man’s body suddenly jolted as he fiercely opened his eyes, gazing into the distance.

After a short while, a streak of imperceptible energy shot over from the distance, drilling into his body.

The man then closed his eyes and felt it silently. His body jolted again after a while before he screamed in surprise, “A Seven Colored Soul Warming Lotus and the Star Field Map, these two treasures are actually on the same guy!? Isn’t his luck heaven-defying!? But so what!? Since you dared to harm this King’s Soul Phantom, how can this King let you go? However, I will let you keep them for the time being. With this King’s Soul Seeking Seal on you, you will never be able to escape from me, even if you fled to the ends of the world.”

Having said this, he slowly stood up as a cruel gleam flashed in his eyes. He thought for a while and said to himself, “All right, I haven’t found any strong energy fluctuation in this Star Field even after a century, so it seems like this Star Field really doesn’t have a Protector. If that’s the case, then it will become a stepping stone for this King to mount the throne.”

After having said this, a cold smile suddenly appeared on his lips as his entire figure strangely sank into the earth.

In just a moment, he had reached the depths of the planet’s core, standing before the Star Source of this Cultivation Star.

His hands danced in the air as he punched seals into the Star Source, one after another. The World Energy of this Cultivation Star started to surge with this man’s movement, converging towards the Star Source before being sucked in by this man.

All the cultivators on this Cultivation Star instantly noticed that there was something wrong. They could clearly feel the World Energy around them getting thinner and thinner at a horrendous rate, but they had no idea what was going on.
