The reason Void Land’s Star City could gain popularity and become a First Class Star City in a few years was because they had Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills.

The pill recipe of the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pills wasn’t really a secret; after all, it was bought by Yang Kai from the Red Clouds Auction House, so those from Red Clouds Paradise definitely still had a copy of it.

It wasn’t that the Alchemists of Red Clouds Paradise were not skillful enough. It was just that they lacked the main ingredient, which was World Source Liquid. That was the reason they were unable to refine such pills.

Yang Kai could do that because he had World Source Liquid with him.

World Source Liquid would only appear when a new world was born, so it had basically become extinct across the 3,000 Worlds. No world in the 3,000 Worlds was newly born, which was why they were unable to find more World Source Liquid.

However, in the depths of this Newborn Great Territory, there was a place where chaos stirred. It was the sign of a new world about to be born.

When the new world finally took shape, World Source Liquid would probably appear.

If someone else obtained it, the advantage of Void Star City would be gone for good. The Star City was a place where those from Void Land relied on to get their cultivation resources, so Yang Kai would never allow anyone to harm their interests.

He intended to make this new Great Territory the back garden of Void Land. Initially, he thought that he could share some of the profits with others if there was too much pressure; however, he had now thoroughly discarded that idea.

No one else could have a hand in this Newborn Great Territory other than Void Land. If they gave someone else a chance, it was akin to killing their own future.

Nevertheless, the Territory Gate was there. When the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters from the Cave Heavens and Paradises arrived at the Star Boundary, they would also see the Territory Gate. The problem was how Yang Kai could bar them from entry. Should he try to persuade them to go away? No one would listen to him when there were benefits to be gained. It was also impossible to fight against them. Dealing with Zuo Quan Hui alone had caused Void Land to suffer immense losses. If there were more High-Rank cultivators they had to deal with, it was impossible for those from Void Land to defeat them.

Therefore, Yang Kai reckoned that he had to come up with a different solution. As he looked at the place where chaos stirred, he fell into his thoughts.

A while later, he spoke up, “Yue He, look for Luan Bai Feng and tell her to meet me at the Territory Gate.”

Upon hearing that, Yue He replied, “Understood. But you might have to wait, Young Master. Everyone has scattered to explore this Great Territory. I don’t even know where she is right now.”

“It’s fine. I’m not in a rush.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

It was then Yue He left.

After looking around, Su Ying Xue reckoned that it was inappropriate for her to stay with Yang Kai alone, so she told him that she would also explore the new Great Territory, then dashed off into the void.

When Luan Bai Feng received the news and rushed over to the Territory Gate one month later, she saw Yang Kai squatting on a random shattered Spirit Province with a frown. There was a stone in his hand as he drew something on the ground.

The Spirit Province was small as it was only a few square kilometres. It was obviously brought here by Yang Kai as it was only a hundred kilometres away from the Territory Gate.

“Sir!” Luan Bai Feng landed on the ground and stood in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai waved his hand to motion for her to wait as he continued drawing on the ground.

Luan Bai Feng had no idea what he was doing, and when she looked down, she saw many unrecognisable patterns and runes on the ground. She initially pressed her lips together in annoyance, but upon closer look, she arched her brow as her interest had been piqued.

When she realised that it was actually a Spirit Array, she broke into laughter. Given her mastery in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, she naturally could see that there were many illogical and impossible parts in this Spirit Array, though it wasn’t completely useless.

She had no idea why Yang Kai suddenly became interested in Spirit Arrays. She even thought that he had asked her to come over here to teach him the Dao of Spirit Arrays.

“What did you get?” Yang Kai asked without raising his head.

“Well…” Luan Bai Feng’s eyelashes fluttered, “Nothing much.”

Yang Kai stopped what he was doing and looked up at her with a meaningful smile.

Luan Bai Feng pressed her lips into a line, “Really nothing.”

Yang Kai extended his hand towards her.

Luan Bai Feng was initially enraged, then she said in a pitiful manner, “Why are you making things difficult for a small woman like me, Sir? It’s so hard for me to earn a few measly resources.”

Yang Kai took a glance at her chest, “Small?”

Luan Bai Feng pressed her chest forward, her plump bosom almost bursting out of her clothes. However, she took a few steps back. With a flushing face, she said bashfully, “Sir, I won’t sleep with you.”

Yang Kai burst into laughter and snapped, “Stop spouting nonsense. Give me your Space Ring!”

At that instant, Luan Bai Feng appeared aggrieved.

However, Yang Kai was unfazed.

A while later, the woman clenched her teeth and took off her ring before tossing it at Yang Kai. While sniffling, she said, “You’re a man, so how do you have the nerve to oppress a woman like me?”

Ignoring her, Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense across the Space Ring’s contents and arched his brow. He then fished out a wisp of Purple Qi from the ring.

The Purple Qi was like a snake that was somewhere between real and illusory. It was truly mysterious. What was more important was that the Purple Qi contained a pure but profound power. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What’s this?” Yang Kai asked.

A furious Luan Bai Feng replied, “How would I know? I took it because I thought it was special. I haven’t figured out what it is.”

Yang Kai poked her, “Of the nine people on the Loyalty List, only you dare to speak to me like this.”

Luan Bai Feng kept a faint smile on her face as she saluted him in an elegant manner, “This Mistress would like to express her eternal gratitude for her loyalty to Sir.” As she spoke, she shot a charming glance at the man, her eyes flashing a truly alluring light.

Yang Kai examined the Purple Qi for a while but still couldn’t figure out what it was. He had a feeling that it was a kind of material, not a cultivation resource. That was because he had tried to refine it but it yielded no results.

He then asked her where she obtained the Purple Qi from, but that didn’t really help.

After that, he put the Purple Qi inside his Small Universe, causing Luan Bai Feng to become even more aggrieved.

He went through her ring one more time, and upon making sure that there was nothing else that was worth his attention, he tossed it back to her.

A vexed Luan Bai Feng took it with a discontented and aggrieved expression, like a maiden who had been thoughtlessly abandoned by a man after a night of passion.

“I asked you to come over because I want you to assist me in arranging a Space Array.” Yang Kai adjusted his clothes, “You’re an expert in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, so only you can help me.”

Luan Bai Feng frowned, “A Space Array?”

Yang Kai pointed at the Territory Gate that wasn’t far away, “For that.”

Luan Bai Feng looked up, and as she recalled what had happened some time ago, she finally understood Yang Kai’s intention. With a smile, she asked, “You want to hog everything for yourself, Sir? Aren’t you worried that it will invite trouble to you?”

Yang Kai replied dispassionately, “Regardless of the trouble, I just have to gobble up everything first. If I don’t even have the appetite for that, how am I supposed to achieve anything great? Zuo Quan Hui and I opened up the Territory Gate together, and although it’s still not stable, I suppose it will soon become so as more than 1,000 Open Heaven Realm Masters from Void Land have already passed through it safely. I need to arrange a Grand Array here and refine some Jade Tokens so that only those with the tokens can move past it freely. Anyone who does not carry the access token will be exiled to the Void. Can you do it?”

Luan Bai Feng fell into her thoughts with a frown. It wasn’t until a moment later that she replied, “I can do it as long as you’re willing to cooperate.”

Yang Kai let out a breath, “Good. We need to finish this quickly. Just tell me whatever materials you need.”

She looked up at him, “That Purple Qi…”

“It’s mine,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“Robber! Thief! Bandit!” Luan Bai Feng said through clenched teeth as she stomped her foot.

She knew that since Yang Kai had snatched it from her, there was no way she could get it back. Even though she was unresigned, there was nothing she could do. She was practically his servant since her name was on the Loyalty List, so whatever Yang Kai wanted to take from her, she was unable to disobey him.

The man was probably the most thick-skinned person she had ever met. He had no qualms about snatching things from others, even a woman like her.

After venting out her anger though, she immediately started working on the Grand Array.

For the next two months, Yang Kai and Luan Bai Feng remained beside the Territory Gate, working while discussing the Grand Array from time to time.

Yang Kai was a Master of the Dao of Space while Luan Bai Feng was adept at the Dao of Spirit Arrays. They worked together to make up for the weaknesses they respectively had, allowing them to rapidly develop this new Grand Array.

The pair used up countless resources and in just two months, the Space Array outside the Territory Gate finally took shape.

A group of Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters stood in the void as they looked dazedly at the Territory Gate.

The Territory Gate, which was opened up by Yang Kai and Zuo Quan Hui, was initially warped and sent out a dangerous aura. However, at this moment, with the support of the Grand Array, it had become stabilised. They could also see that the Territory Gate was surrounded by an oval-shaped structure that looked like a kind of gateway.

In the middle of the structure was the Territory Gate that connected both Great Territories.

Luan Bai Feng was slightly pale. She had spent a lot of energy trying to arrange this Grand Array over the past two months. However, when she saw that her work had paid off, she still felt gratified.

Yang Kai turned his head and sent a signal to Yue He, who dashed into the Territory Gate with a Jade Token in her hand.

A moment later, she returned and nodded at Yang Kai.

“It works!” Yang Kai let out a long breath. Although he had repeatedly tested it himself and reckoned that there wouldn’t be a problem, he was a Master of the Dao of Space after all. If there was really a problem, he might not be able to detect it.

Since Yue He managed to shuttle back and forth safely though, it meant that his hard work over the past two months had paid off.

Yue He approached Yang Kai and said in a small voice, “Senior Brother Qing is waiting across from here, Young Master. He said that our guests have arrived.”

Yang Kai nodded, “En.”

It had been four months since Qing Kui left. Yang Kai calculated the time and realised that Qing Kui was indeed supposed to return around now.

It had been a long time since they started exploring the Newborn Great Territory, but they still hadn’t gotten a full picture of it. Yang Kai had summoned most of them back. It wasn’t that they would stop exploring, it was just that they still wouldn’t be able to explore everything even if they kept doing it for decades.

This Great Territory wasn’t really that expansive, but there were many hidden corners. If they didn’t investigate carefully, they would definitely miss some wonderful discoveries.

In the 3,000 Worlds, many amazing things would still surface in those known Great Territories from time to time. Even though some places were crammed with people, they might still find something new that they hadn’t paid attention to previously. It was the same case for this new Great Territory.

They still had many years ahead of them anyway, and no one else could come here besides those from Void Land. They could still excavate the resources while exploring the Great Territory in the future. Whatever treasures there were in this place, they now belonged to Void Land, and no one else could lay their hands on them.
