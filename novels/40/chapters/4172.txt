Before the Two Worlds Great War, no one was aware of the Outer Universe. After the war, Yang Kai left the Star Boundary, and it was then people became aware that there was more outside their own World, and that there were stronger Masters out there as well. Several dozen years had passed, and Void Great Emperor had returned. Not only had he solved the crisis facing the Star Boundary, but he also intended to bring many cultivators to explore the Outer Universe.

The news sent a shock wave across the world as countless cultivators began scrambling to get a place for themselves.

From the cities and great forces in all four Territories, innumerable cultivators arrived at Ice Snow City, which was just outside of High Heaven Palace in the Northern Territory, through the Space Array Network. Some disciples from High Heaven Palace were stationed there to take down names, backgrounds, cultivation, and special skills.

During that period of time, Ice Snow City became crammed with people.

In the Southern Territory, Azure Sun Temple, on Myriad Saints Peak, the Temple Master of Azure Sun Temple, Wen Zi Shan, who was clad in purple robes as he placed his hands behind his back as he stood on the edge of a cliff, watching the clouds.

Myriad Saints Peak was the Main Peak of Azure Sun Temple as well as Wen Zi Shan’s residence.

Wen Zi Shan was quietly staring at the movements of the clouds while Gao Xue Ting, who looked like a noble lady, stood beside him.

When the Sun was rising, the clouds were dyed with a golden glow, which enhanced the beauty of the scenery.

Just then, footsteps were heard coming from behind. The next moment, 3 people were heard calling out at the same time, “Greetings Temple Master, Elder Gao!”

Wen Zi Shan turned around and gazed at the 3 of them. Then, he smiled and nodded, “You’re here.”

The trio standing in front of him were the most talented among the next generation in Azure Sun Temple, Xia Sheng, Xiao Bai Yi, and Murong Xiao Xiao. In the past, they were already the brightest disciples in the Sect, and now, they had grown to be fairly powerful Elders. All of them were in the Second Order Emperor Realm.

Xia Sheng cupped his fists and asked, “Temple Master, why did you summon us?”

Compared to decades ago, Xia Sheng was now a calmer man. In the past, he was pretty willful, but after the great war, he had matured tremendously.

“I have a piece of good news.” Wen Zi Shan sported an amiable smile.

Xia Sheng replied, “Temple Master, please enlighten us.”

Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were also looking doubtfully at him, wondering what kind of good news the Temple Master was talking about.

Wen Zi Shan went on to say, “The thing is, all of you are in the Second-Order Emperor Realm, and there is rarely anyone stronger than you in the Star Boundary. Hence, I think it’s time for you 3 to go through an even harder trial and take on a more difficult task.”

Hearing that, the 3 of them turned solemn.

“I’ll choose one person from the 3 of you to inherit the position of Temple Master; however, all of you have your respective virtues, so it’s difficult for this King to make a decision. I’ll need to give it a thought.”

When Xia Sheng and the others heard that, they traded glances before a hesitant Murong Xiao Xiao asked, “Temple Master, are you saying that you’ll pass on your position?”

“Good!” Wen Zi Shan nodded his head.

With a frown, Murong Xiao Xiao said, “But Temple Master, even though we’re all in the Emperor Realm, we’re still young and inexperienced. So, how are we going to inherit the position of Temple Master? Even if one of us is willing to take on that position, no one will obey us.”

Smiling, Wen Zi Shan replied, “You don’t have to worry about that. With this King behind you, no one will dare to criticize you. Moreover, we need young people like you to bring the Temple to greater heights. Maybe you’ll do a better job than old people like us.”

Xiao Bai Yi cupped his fists and stressed, “Temple Master, please think through it carefully. The Temple is not in a perilous situation. If you rashly pass on your position, some problems might arise. What if the foundation of the Temple is…”

Wen Zi Shan raised his hand to stop him, “I’ve made up my mind.”

A doubtful Xia Sheng gaped at him before muttering, “Temple Master, I’ve heard that Senior Void intends to bring some people to the Outer Universe.”

“There’s no such thing,” Wen Zi Shan refuted, “How can you believe such baseless rumours?”

Xiao Bai Yi shot back, “I’ve heard that Senior Void will bring all the Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters with him, and those who are below the Third-Order Emperor Realm can head to Ice Snow Valley to register before being selected accordingly.”

“That’s nonsense!” Wen Zi Shan kept a smile on his face.

Murong Xiao Xiao stared at Wen Zi Shan for a time before pointing out, “Temple Master, even though Senior Void is a Great Emperor now, he used to cultivate alongside us in the past. So… we can contact him.”

Wen Zi Shan’s face twitched as he let out a hollow laugh, “I see… So, you’ve found out about it. In that case, this King will stop hiding it from you.”

He coughed, “That’s right. Senior Void wants to bring some people to the Outer Universe. Your Martial Aunt Gao and I are going as well. So, before I leave, I want to let one of you take over the position of Temple Master; after all, a Sect cannot survive without a leader. Someone has to be in charge of the Temple after we’re gone. I think all of you are suitable for the position. Xia Sheng, you’re the Eldest Senior Brother, so you must take over the position. You mustn’t disappoint this King and your Martial Aunt Gao!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Pretending that he didn’t hear him, Xia Sheng looked up at the sky.

The veins on Wen Zi Shan’s forehead throbbed as he turned to look at Xiao Bai Yi, “Xiao Bai, even though you’re slightly weaker than Xia Sheng, you’re the most rational among the three of you. This King intends to pass on the position of Temple Master to you. I believe that you’ll be able to bring the Temple to greater heights!”

Xiao Bai Yi just picked his ear and looked away.

With a livid expression, Wen Zi Shan gazed at Murong Xiao Xiao and solemnly declared, “Xiao Xiao, even though you’re a woman, you’re more powerful than most men. Do you like the idea of becoming the Temple Master? If you do, you can take the seal of the Temple Master right now. With this King helping you on the side, you’ll be able to fully refine it in just a few days. Since the founding of the Temple, there has never been a female Temple Master. If you agree to it, you’ll be the first ever. By then, your name will be remembered throughout the ages, and all future disciples and descendants will all look up to you.”

Murong Xiao Xiao refuted meekly, “Temple Master, since the founding of our Temple, you’ve been the only Temple Master, right?”

“Don’t be concerned about such trifles.”

“But…” Murong Xiao Xiao hesitantly said, “The 3 of us have already registered with the disciples in Ice Snow Valley.”

“What?” As if struck by lightning, Wen Zi Shan turned ashen, “When did that happen?”

“Yesterday,” Murong Xiao Xiao replied in a hushed voice.

As though he had taken an arrow to the heart, Wen Zi Shan covered his chest and stared at them, “This King is truly disappointed in you all. Just when the Temple needs you, all of you… How could you make such a rash move? It pains this King’s heart so!”

Xia Sheng retorted, “Temple Master, we’d like to experience the wonders of the Outer Universe as well. If we take over your seal, how are we supposed to go?”

“But all of you can’t leave just like this!” Wen Zi Shan was incensed, “Who is going to look after the Temple if all of you are gone?”

After giving it a thought, Xiao Bai Yi said seriously, “In that case, why don’t you stay here?”

“Little bastards!” Wen Zi Shan bellowed as he almost spat out some saliva, “You want to experience the Outer Universe and think this King doesn’t? What a bunch of ungrateful wolves! This King has spent years raising and teaching you since you were young children and this is how you repay my favour? I’m truly overwhelmed with rage at this betrayal!”

The 3 of them fell silent and let Wen Zi Shan reprimand them.

After he became exhausted, Xia Sheng cupped his fists and said, “Temple Master, if there’s nothing else, we’ll take our leave.”

Then, he gave a hint at Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao with his eyes, whereupon the 3 of them said simultaneously, “Farewell!”

Following that, they ran towards the bottom of the mountain.

“Don’t go! We can still talk about this!” Wen Zi Shan called out to them, but none of them bothered to reply to him.

In the blink of an eye, all of them were gone.

Wen Zi Shan said through clenched teeth, “A pack of ungrateful wolves! Little Xue Ting, did you see that? Those little bastards have no regard for me at all now!”

Smilingly, Gao Xue Ting replied, “Alright alright, don’t get mad at them.” As she spoke, she walked over and patted his heaving chest to placate him, “If I were them, I wouldn’t have accepted your seal at this point either. They’re adults now, and they have their own goals and dreams. Isn’t that a good thing?”

“But, what about the Temple?” Wen Zi Shan questioned.

Gao Xue Ting said with a smile, “Why don’t I…”

“I’ll take charge of the Temple,” someone was heard saying. Qiu Ran shuffled out of the clouds and saluted them, “Temple Master, Madame.”

A shocked Wen Zi Shan gazed at him, “Junior Brother Qiu, you…”

With a smile, Qiu Ran stressed, “I’m old now, so I don’t like moving around much. It’s better if I just stay here. No one knows what’s going to happen in the Outer Universe other than Senior Void, but I know that it will be a long journey to a foreign land. Old people tend to get nostalgic and homesick more easily, so I’ll just stay here.”

…..

In the Grand Hall of the Liu Family in the Eastern Territory, with many Elders as witnesses, the Liu Family Patriarch passed the seal to a young man and declared, “Brat, from now on, you’re the Patriarch of the Liu Family. Your aptitude is average, but you’re a reliable man. I don’t expect you to expand our family, but I want you to keep it going at least. You mustn’t disappoint our ancestors!”

The Young Master of the Liu Family took the seal and fell on his knees, “Father, I’ll always remember your teachings.”

The Liu Family Patriarch nodded, “I’ll be able to rest assured, then. I’ll head to Ice Snow City in the Northern Territory tomorrow. If everything goes well, I’ll follow Senior Void to the Outer Universe. If you ever want to meet me again in your lifetime, cultivate harder. Senior Void has said that whoever can ascend to the Third-Order Emperor Realm in the future will be brought to the Outer Universe.”

Hearing that, the Young Master pressed his head against the floor, “Father, Uncles, I wish you all the best.”

In Sky Grasping City in the Eastern Territory, City Lord Xu Tian He was only in the First-Order Emperor Realm, but at this moment, he summoned his favourite Son, intending to make him the new City Lord.

On Immaculate Island in the Northern Territory, Island Master Jiang Zhou Zi clenched a young man’s collar and pressed him into a glorious throne. After stuffing the seal of the Island Master into his hands, he patted his shoulders, “Boy, you’re the Island Master of Immaculate Island from now on.”

The young man sported a sorrowful expression, “Master, you can’t do this to me. I don’t want to be the Island Master! I want to follow Senior Void to make a name for myself in the Outer Universe!”

“Stop spouting nonsense. I’ll follow Senior Void, while you’ll stay here to manage the island. You’ll be better off this way. Come! Everyone! Salute your new Island Master!” Jiang Zhou Zi demanded, whereupon the Elders and disciples cupped their fists with awkward expressions.

“Greetings, Island Master…”

Similar scenes took place over and over again across all four Territories. Countless people were scrambling to follow the Void Great Emperor to the Outer Universe. The cultivators without any ties could immediately head to Ice Snow City and register, but for people like Jiang Zhou Zi, Liu Family Patriarch, and the City Lord of Sky Grasping City, it wasn’t easy for them to leave. They had to make some proper arrangements first. Soon, about 70% of the great forces in the Star Boundary had news leaders.
