Mo Duo had reached this World not long ago, but he already knew the means of the foreign race like the back of his hand, so seeing someone using a completely different power, and one that was actually capable of easily killing a powerful Demon King, Mo Duo was naturally interested in it.

Therefore, he acted personally, wanting to catch this foreigner and study his unique powers.

When he suddenly emerged in front of Yang Kai, Mo Duo examined the former from above without restraint, recklessly enveloping him with his powerful Divine Sense, as if trying to dissect him thoroughly.

But the result surprised Mo Duo, because even he could not penetrate into the depths of this youth’s Knowledge Sea. The Knowledge Sea of this foreigner seemed to have an invisible layer of powerful protection, and that protection was so firm that even a Demon Saint could do nothing about it.

[What a strange guy.] Mo Duo’s interest piqued even more and he asked, “What’s your name?”

Yang Kai maintained his Dragon Transformation and stared warily at the young looking man in front of him. Although it was their first-time meeting, Yang Kai knew his identity, because this pair of eyes gave him a notably familiar feeling. This was the pair of eyes that had been watching him the whole time.

Yang Kai quickly jumped out of the huge pit, stood ten metres away from Mo Duo, clapped his hands, and grinned, “Your Father!”

When the words fell, Yang Kai immediately made his move. With a swing of his hands, a massive Moon Blade was formed and shot towards Mo Duo.

“Oh…” Mo Duo frowned in surprise, but it was more of a pleasant surprise than shock. Instead of dodging, he stretched out his hand to grab the pitch-black Moon Blade, as if he wanted to feel it personally.

The Moon Blade cut through his hand and banished half of his arm into the Void, causing blood to spurt out of the clean cut.

Mo Duo’s expression turned more excited, as if he had found something new and interesting, and rather than flinching from the pain, he took a step forward.

Yang Kai did not back down either, charging recklessly towards Mo Duo who was approaching him.

He raised his arms, and two giant phantom Dragon Claws overcast Mo Duo in an instant.

Mo Duo’s blood spurted from all over his body with hissing sounds, and his body seemed on the verge of fragmenting.

After just three breaths of time, Demon Saint Mo Duo turned into a pool of rotten meat and died just like that.

The Demon Kings who were watching from far away were all dumbstruck, staring at the scene in a daze. They wished that they could gouge out their eyes and throw them there to have a clear look.

[Senior Mo Duo… died?]

[How is that possible? That foreigner who killed him is neither a Shaman King nor a Shaman Saint, he’s just some nobody!]

Yang Kai was a little lost too. When Mo Duo appeared in front of his eyes, he sensed his outstanding strength and knew he was definitely an existence comparable to a Great Emperor! Because that kind of aura could only be exuded by a Great Emperor level powerhouse.

So how could such a Master be killed by him in just a few moves?

Instead of pleasant surprise, Yang Kai only felt uneasy.

He soon realized where the uneasiness came from, because Mo Duo, who should have died, somehow appeared behind him, as if what he had just experienced was all an illusion.

But Yang Kai knew that it was not an illusion, because the sensation of hot spurting blood on his hands was simply too real.

Mo Duo, who was standing behind Yang Kai, spread his arms and Demon Qi flew out from his fingertips, gathering rapidly and condensing into a cage, attempting to capture Yang Kai alive.

Yang Kai naturally did not stand there waiting to die. Facing a strong enemy comparable to a Great Emperor, he decided to use his trump card.

*Ding…*

With a soft ring, a small and ancient-looking bell appeared in Yang Kai’s palm. The surface of the bell was engraved with various patterns of mountains, rivers, birds, and beasts, while it gave off a Primordial Aura.

Mountains and Rivers Bell!

With Yang Kai’s current strength, it was still a little difficult to drive such an Emperor Artifact, but this was the strongest means he could use at the moment.

When the bell tolled, Mo Duo frowned and the dark Demon Qi released from his fingers shrank back. A gap was suddenly revealed in the almost completed encirclement, and Yang Kai reacted by quickly leaping out, tossing out the Mountains and Rivers Bell just as he turned around.

The little bell enlarged rapidly and directly moved to cover Mo Duo.

Mo Duo looked up and attempted to withdraw, but to his surprise, he found that everything within the coverage of the small bell was sealed off, and it would cost him quite a price to escape even with his great strength.

*Hong…*

Before he could use any abilities, the Mountains and Rivers Bell engulfed him.

Yang Kai rushed forward with a solemn face and slapped the Mountains and Rivers Bell furiously.

*Guang…*

As the bell chimed loudly, a visible sound wave spread out from the Mountains and Rivers Bell. The Demon Kings, who had come to complete the encirclement, were all propelled out by this shockwave and fell to the ground like birds who had their wings snapped, overwhelming consternation and confusion filling their faces. Those Demon Kings who were slightly weaker even coughed up a mouthful of blood, as if they were struck by lightning.

As for those Demons who were still besieging and suppressing the South Barbarian Clan nearby, they could not bear the terrifying power of the Mountain and Rivers Bell at all. All of the Demons, including the Demon Great Generals and the Demon Generals, turned into dust as the sound wave swept across them one after another.

A single chime of this bell wiped out tens of thousands of enemies.

Yang Kai was not delighted at all though, because Mo Duo, who was confined in the Mountain and Rivers Bell, burst into a blood mist right after he was suppressed, and the uneasy feeling in his heart became stronger and stronger.

“Interesting, who are you? You’re not a Barbarian!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Mo Duo’s voice appeared strangely from behind, his tone firm, and his body seemingly uninjured. He seemed to have an immortal physique that could reconstitute completely after exploding into a blood mist.

“I told you, call me Father!” Yang Kai retrieved the Mountain and River Bell, turned around and examined Mo Duo with his eyes.

Mo Duo either did not care about his disrespect or was just too lazy to argue with him, instead choosing to examine Yang Kai closely again. After a while, a realization dawned on Mo Duo and he asked with interest, “Which Great World are you from?”

The abilities and treasures that Yang Kai displayed were obviously not compatible with the Ancient Barbarian Race. Therefore, Mo Duo assumed Yang Kai was just like the Demon Race, a foreigner who came from a different Great World.

Yang Kai ignored the question and simply returned a grin as he quipped, “So you just look strong but actually aren’t.”

After two exchanges, Yang Kai finally found a clue about the Demon Saint in front of him. He was truly an existence on par with a Great Emperor, but he could not fully unleash his power right now. If that wasn’t the case, Yang Kai would not be able to cause a ripple in front of him even if regained his full strength.

Bao Qi was right. Mo Duo must have paid a heavy price when he came here from the Demon Realm and was weakened somewhat. On top of that, the world-destroying Black Brilliance that he unleashed earlier definitely consumed a lot of his strength.

Therefore, the person who Yang Kai was facing right now was just a guy who had the attributes of the Great Emperor but could not fully exert the power of one.

This was somewhat similar to his own situation.

“You answer my question first,” Mo Duo looked at Yang Kai seriously, as if he was just chatting with him, not facing an enemy.

Yang Kai answered, “I am Shaman Niu of the South Barbarian Clan!”

Mo Duo shook his head and stretched out a hand to Yang Kai, “Come to my side, I can give you what the Barbarian Race can give you, and I can also take you to visit more Great Worlds, which is something the Barbarian Race can’t provide.”

Yang Kai sneered, and pointed his dragon claw at him, “Get out of this land with your people, or all of you will perish!”

Mo Duo sighed, withdrew his hand, looked at the huge pit, and remarked faintly, “Those who are still struggling are your clansmen, and they are about to perish. Your threat is meaningless.”

Yang Kai replied viciously, “I will avenge them. Today, three hundred thousand warriors of the South Barbarian Clan were killed in battle, so the Demon Race must pay at least the same price in the future!”

Mo Duo smiled lightly, “Perhaps, but not at your hand. You can’t escape while I’m here.”

“If I want to leave, you can’t stop me!” Yang Kai grinned, revealing his pristine fangs.

Mo Duo began to lose patience and no longer wanted to waste time on talk, directly pushing the Demon Qi in his body instead. For him, Yang Kai’s appearance was just a novelty, and inviting him to join the Demon Clan was also just an excuse to study his power. Since this boy did not agree, he could only be destroyed.

Mo Duo raised his finger casually and a dark energy ball suddenly emerged at his fingertip and began to rotate. With the injection of Mo Duo’s Demon Qi, the energy ball rotated faster and faster. Although the size remained the same, its power grew greater and greater, and an astonishing aura began radiating from it.

As he gently pointed in Yang Kai’s direction, the energy ball at his fingertip immediately shot towards him.

Yang Kai kept smiling without showing any intention of dodging.

Mo Duo frowned slightly at this sight.

Just as the energy ball was about to hit Yang Kai, a subtle force fluctuated, and Yang Kai’s figure suddenly disappeared.

“Teleportation!” Mo Duo’s face changed slightly as he immediately looked over in a certain direction before sending out a palm strike seemingly towards the empty air there. This attack looked ordinary, but in reality was able to shatter space.

Vaguely, Mo Duo heard a dull grunt, followed by the resounding voice of Shaman Niu that reverberated throughout the whole world.

“The Demon Race will pay the price for today’s scheme! All Demons will live in fear and anxiety from now on!”

When this voice faded, Mo Duo could no longer find any trace of Shaman Niu, leaving only his words echoing through the air like a curse.

Mo Duo’s face sank a little and snorted softly after a while.

If he was at his peak, even if his opponent executed teleportation like just now, he could still pull him back from the Void, but the truth was just as Yang Kai guessed. Even though he was a Demon Saint, Mo Duo could not unleash the strength a Demon Saint should have now and there was nothing he could do about facing an enemy who had such exquisite Space Techniques.

Everyone heard Yang Kai’s declaration before he left, including the hundred thousand or so remaining Demons, and the few hundred Barbarians who were still alive and fighting back.

Shaman Dang was among these survivors, but he was bleeding all over his body while fighting several Demon Kings. No part of his body was intact, while one of his arms and one of his legs was already missing.

Beside him, only a few barbarians remained standing, but it was just a matter of time before they were slain.

Hearing Yang Kai’s voice, Shaman Dang grinned victoriously as he ignited his remaining vitality, casting the Life Sacrifice as he faced his death.
