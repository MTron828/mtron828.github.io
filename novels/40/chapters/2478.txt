“You’ve played quite the elaborate game!” Yang Kai was slightly shocked. He did not expect Wu Meng Chuan to pass the Heaven Devouring Battle Law to many people, and for all those who cultivated it to have been killed by the backlash.

After all, not everyone had a body like the Embodiment.

Yang Kai rejoiced secretly that he had resisted the temptation to cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law back then, otherwise, he would not even have known how he had died.

Although he had a great deal of perseverance, the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was too overbearing. It seemed that Wu Meng Chuan did not manage to reach the Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation by just being strong in perseverance. Perhaps the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor passed down some cultivation experience for him to use as reference.

“It is nothing to wait for a few hundred years if I could revive the glory of Ancestor!” Wu Meng Chuan shook his body and shouted loudly.

With an ugly face, Yang Kai pressed on, “I want to ask, what is the difference between the original Secret Art and the copy?”

“Heh heh, basically the two are the same, but naturally there are some slight differences. The cultivator who cultivates the copy is just a seed. Once he reaches the top of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, the seed is mature and can be consumed by the cultivator of the original technique. If the seed is swallowed, then you can break through to the Emperor Realm! Moreover, if the seed matures, the person who cultivates the original can sense it from a far distance,” Wu Meng Chuan explained in gradual excitement.

“No wonder you could find me in the Shattered Star Sea, you were able to detect me all along,” Yang Kai remarked.

He had released the Embodiment earlier in the Source Sea, so Wu Meng Chuan must have sensed his presence at that time.

Wu Meng Chuan raised his arms and wailed, “This King has waited for hundreds of years for this day, and the day has finally come!”

Yang Kai nodded; he had obtained answers to all his doubts.

The reason why the Embodiment had reached a bottleneck and was unable to break through turned out to be because of the Secret Art; not because it was incomplete, but because it was meant to be like that.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment before asking, “What if the person who has cultivated the copy swallows the person who has cultivated the original?”

Wu Meng Chuan was taken aback by Yang Kai’s question, but soon understood what Yang Kai meant and grinned meaningfully, “Young people are indeed very ambitious, very good, very good! With your aptitude, if you did not cultivate that Secret Art, you would surely have reached a grand stage in the future. It’s a pity… now you’re just a stepping stone for this King’s promotion.”

“You haven’t answered my question!” Yang Kai looked at him with a darkened face.

Wu Meng Chuan answered, “If you can really swallow this King, naturally you would break through. What is there to ask about?”

“I see…” Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction, “That would be for the best.”

“Little brat, what else do you want to ask?” Wu Meng Chuan snarled, “Ask now as it is your last chance. This King is quite impatient and can barely restrain himself.”

“I have no more questions!” Yang Kai grinned at him.

His sly smile startled Wu Meng Chuan, who gritted his teeth and barked, “Trying to be all mysterious!”

While talking, Source Qi suddenly surged and he prepared to attack Yang Kai.

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand.

“What else!?” Wu Meng Chuan complained impatiently.

Yang Kai smiled at him weirdly, and asked, “Why didn’t you ask why can’t you sense the mature seed now?”

Flabbergasted, Wu Meng Chuan had completely forgotten the odd phenomenon he had noticed earlier when Yang Kai distracted him with a string of questions, and only remembered when Yang Kai reminded him.

He queried hastily, “Why?”

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai grinned, spreading his hands and revealing, “Because, this Young Master never cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law!”

“What?” Wu Meng Chuan was dumbfounded, “Didn’t cultivate it? Impossible!”

If Yang Kai did not cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, how did he reach the Third-Order Dao Source Realm in such a short period of time? By his looks and aura, Yang Kai seemed to have broken through quite some time ago and had an extremely solid foundation.

If Yang Kai did not cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Law, how could the indication of the seed he had sensed earlier be explained?

He obviously travelled so far after sensing that fluctuation and encountered Yang Kai because of that.

Yang Kai added in a low voice, “The one who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Law was someone else!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Who!?” Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes narrowed.

Yang Kai waved his hand, and a behemoth suddenly materialised. The huge figure obscured all the light from the sky, casting a shadow that covered a large area on the ground which shook slightly when it landed.

Wu Meng Chuan’s jaw dropped as he looked up at the hill-like existence, feeling a wave of suffocating pressure, making it difficult for him to even breathe smoothly.

The signal the seed emitted that had disappeared earlier reappeared when this hill-like existence materialised.

This time, Wu Meng Chuan clearly felt that the fluctuation was not from Yang Kai, but from the monster in front of him.

Taking a closer look, Wu Meng Chuan could not help drawing a deep breath.

The huge monster had four limbs, a face, and was covered in thick rock armour. It looked like a huge stone man; however, this stone man had a pair of shrewd eyes that were constantly darting around as well as a black War Hammer held in its hand which exuded an extremely uncomfortable aura.

[A Demonic Artifact!] Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes widened, ogling the War Hammer blankly in shock. He could not believe his eyes. This was a Demonic Artifact, a real Demonic Artifact.

Did Demonic Artifacts still exist in the world today? Shouldn’t such things have been destroyed aeons ago? Hadn’t the Ancient Demons gone extinct?

“Did you hear what this guy said just now?” Yang Kai pointed to Wu Meng Chuan and asked.

The Embodiment waved the Demonic War Hammer in his hand and said in a booming voice, “I heard it clearly.”

“Devour him, and you will be able to break through the bottleneck,” Yang Kai laughed lightly.

The Embodiment chortled with him, “I can’t wait.”

As he spoke, he took a step forward.

*Hong long long… *

The ground boomed when the Embodiment stomped, leaving a gigantic footprint on the solid ground.

“What the hell is this?” Wu Meng Chuan finally recovered from his befuddlement and could not help exclaiming, “Where did you obtain this thing from?”

Such a huge monster couldn’t be taken out of a Space Ring, but Wu Meng Chuan only saw it emerge after Yang Kai waved his arm.

It was also hard to tell if this thing was a living creature. It could talk and communicate like a living thing, but it did not exude any signs of vitality.

Having lived for so many years, Wu Meng Chuan never expected that he could still be so surprised.

“You don’t need to worry about where I got it from, you just need to die obediently. If you don’t resist, I can still give you a painless death, but if you resist, heh heh!” Yang Kai stood aside and sneered.

“You’re asking this King to die?” Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes turned perverse as he barked, “Little brat, you don’t seem to know the situation you’re in! How dare anyone be presumptuous in front of this King!?” He suddenly motioned his hand at the Embodiment and growled, “Heaven Devouring Battle Law, devour it for me!”

A magical power spread out all of a sudden, covering the Embodiment as if it was trying to swallow him whole.

The huge body of the Embodiment staggered and fell to his knees all of a sudden, pain spread across his face as he let out a loud wail.

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically, and he whispered, “What’s going on?”

He knew exactly how strong the Embodiment was. The Stone Puppet clan was born with immense innate strength, and over the years, the Embodiment had refined countless treasures and ores, and now even possessed the Demonic War Hammer; he could even compete against an ordinary Emperor Realm Master. If it was not because he was too large and it was inconvenient for him to move around, Yang Kai would not have kept him hidden so often.

Yang Kai was flabbergasted that his powerful Embodiment was brought to his knees by Wu Meng Chuan in just the blink of an eye, powerless to fight back.

[Is this old thing really so strong?] Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

“I’m dying, I’m dying, I’m dying…” the Embodiment wailed and moaned in pain, “My power is being drained… “

“Hahahaha!” Wu Meng Chuan laughed frantically with frenzied eyes as he roared madly, “How dare you be arrogant in front of this King, watch this King devour you completely!”

Visible to the naked eye, a stream of pure energy was pulled from the Embodiment into Wu Meng Chuan, who turned ruddy from head to toe, as if he had received immense nourishment.

“It’s the suppression from the Secret Art!” Yang Kai’s face sank when realization dawned on him. He immediately sent the Embodiment back into the Sealed World Bead with another wave of his hand, not daring to let him out anymore.

Wu Meng Chuan looked around when the source of power that he was happily devouring suddenly disappeared, together with the gigantic Embodiment who vanished without a trace.

His face suddenly darkened and he gritted his teeth, “Where did that thing go? Release it quickly, or else this King will make you beg for death!”

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and snapped, “You sly old dog, is there a natural suppression between the original and the copy of the Secret Art?”

Wu Meng Chuan answered with a sullen face, “So what if there is?”

Yang Kai snorted, “If so, no matter how strong the cultivator that cultivates the copy becomes, he is just a meal waiting to be consumed by you.”

“Little brat, you’re too long-winded, let the thing out quickly, after this King breaks through to the Emperor Realm, this King could give you a hand or two in the future,” Wu Meng Chuan bellowed impatiently. The opportunity to reach the Emperor Realm was right in front of him, yet Yang Kai had taken it away. How could Wu Meng Chuan not be anxious?

He did not even know how Yang Kai hid that thing away. If he had known, he would not have wasted time negotiating with Yang Kai and attacked him right away.

Yang Kai snorted, “How inhumane was Heaven Devouring Great Emperor? He slaughtered millions of souls, swallowed countless Stars, collapsed whole Star Fields, angered the Heavens and everyone who lived below them, and was finally killed by several Great Emperors. Wu Meng Chuan, so what if you can break through to the Emperor Realm? You’ll just be following in the footsteps of your Ancestor.”

“Nonsense!” Wu Meng Chuan’s eyes went bloodshot as he shouted angrily, “The Great Emperors were narrow-minded people, jealous of the strength Ancestor possessed, and set up a trap for him, but unfortunately, they still lost their gamble! How could a person as strong as my Ancestor die so easily…”

As he finished these words, Wu Meng Chuan suddenly shut his mouth, his initial excitement seemingly having died down.
