Chapter 4257, Try if You Dare

Pei Wen Xuan had lunged at Black Crow Divine Monarch after unleashing his previous attack, but at this moment, it seemed like he walked straight into his death instead. He was caught off guard and captured almost instantly.

Wrapped by the Blood Qi, Pei Wen Xuan felt as though something was suppressing the power in his body and blocking his meridians so that his strength could not flow out. He was absolutely horrified. [Is this really the power that an Emperor Realm cultivator can exert!?]

Zhou Yi was no more than a disciple of Great Thousand Blood Land. His aptitude and comprehension abilities were incomparable to those of Pei Wen Xuan. If it were before he was possessed, then Pei Wen Xuan alone would have been able to defeat three to five of him without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, he became capable of subduing Pei Wen Xuan in a single move after being possessed by Black Crow Divine Monarch!

It was not until this moment that Pei Wen Xuan finally understood one thing, this might be Zhou Yi’s body, but the ‘Zhou Yi’ that stood in front of him could no longer be viewed as the same person at all.

“Die, Junior!” Black Crow Divine Monarch grinned, exerting a sudden burst of force in his hand in order to kill Pei Wen Xuan on the spot. However, his brow twitched at that moment and a huge sense of crisis enveloped him as the aura of death loomed over him.

Pei Wen Xuan’s Identity Token that had been hanging at his waist suddenly burst out with dazzling white light. It was extremely blinding, so blinding that it breached the blood-coloured sea even through the thick blood mist. The white light leaped out from the Identity Token like a bolt of candlelight. It was not very conspicuous at first, but the light exploded in an instant to transform into a blade of overwhelming Demon Qi. Then, the blade came slashing down on Black Crow Divine Monarch!

Black Crow Divine Monarch was shocked. How could he dare to remain standing in place after sensing the terrifying power contained in this strike? Releasing his grip on Pei Wen Xuan, he turned into a ray of blood light and quickly retreated; however, he could not escape the power of this blade no matter how he tried to dodge.

The blade slashed down and a scream rang out. The blood light was split into two, revealing two bloody halves of a body.

Pei Wen Xuan landed heavily, coughing hard with his hands clutching at his neck. He glared fiercely at Zhou Yi’s corpse that had been sliced in half and ground his teeth, “How dare you mess with me, old dog!? How dare you attack me!? Serves you right for ending up dead!”

He let out a gloomy laughter that sounded quite ghastly. While he was speaking, the Identity Token hanging around his waist cracked and shattered before turning into dust.

Yang Kai was amazed by the sight. He had long known about the Identity Tokens carried by the Core Disciples of the Cave-Heavens and Paradises. These Identity Tokens not only symbolised their personal status but also contained a Divine Ability granted by their Elders to protect them. It would automatically be activated in the event that their lives were in danger. Although it could only be used once, it could save their lives at a critical moment. Just like what happened here!

Yang Kai suspected that even a Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master might not have been able to withstand that attack if taken head on. Pei Wen Xuan’s Honoured Master was definitely a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master!

Black Crow Divine Monarch had possessed Zhou Yi, and while he had the heritage of a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, he was limited by Zhou Yi’s body. Combined with the fact that he was a wounded Remnant Soul, the strength that he could exert at this moment was far from his peak. How could he come out unscathed after being hit by a Divine Ability like that?

[This old guy has been plotting for countless years only to suffer such a tragic ending when he finally succeeded in possessing somebody. I’m sure that he himself never anticipated such an outcome.] Yang Kai couldn’t help but sigh in amazement.

Zhou Yi’s body had been sliced into two, but Black Crow Divine Monarch’s Remnant Soul remained nowhere to be seen; hence, Yang Kai did not let down his guard and instead released his Divine Sense to guard against anything that might happen.

Under his close watch, Yang Kai was surprised to discover something strange about the crimson blood flowing out of the corpse that had been sliced in two. The blood seemed to be guided by some sort of pulling force, gathering together from all directions and quickly merging back into one. In the next moment, the two halves of the corpse suddenly joined down the middle and were patched together once more.

The tightly closed eyes of Black Crow Divine Monarch reopened at this moment and he slowly climbed up from the floor. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Inside the Grand Hall, Yang Kai and the two others were dumbfounded by the sight!

“The Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture really does live up to its reputation! Hahahaha!” Black Crow Divine Monarch cackled uncontrollably. When he first stood up, there remained a wound that resembled an obvious blood line extending from the middle of his forehead down to his neck and further down his body where his skin was exposed. However, this wound quickly disappeared while he was laughing. His outward appearance at this moment seemed completely intact! Only his aura was significantly lower than before.

Pei Wen Xuan was shocked and terrified. [I can’t believe that this old dog is still alive! I saw him being sliced in half with my own eyes just now! How is he still perfectly fine!?]

Even Yang Kai found the sight in front of him difficult to believe, but he then remembered what Black Crow Divine Monarch told him before. Supposedly, if one were to cultivate the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture to its limits, they could even be reborn from a single drop of blood. One would be practically immortal and indestructible as a result.

Those words were certainly an exaggeration. Nevertheless, the current situation indicated that the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture was indeed an extraordinary Secret Art. The Blood Light Scripture was definitely the reason why Black Crow Divine Monarch could come back to life.

Black Crow Divine Monarch, who had just gotten back to his feet, cracked his neck and coldly said, “Junior, stop resisting. You will not be able to defeat this Monarch with your abilities. Why bother wasting your energy and suffering in vain?”

“You must be joking, Divine Monarch! Even ants fight to survive, much less cultivators like us!” Yang Kai shouted.

Black Crow Divine Monarch sneered and turned around to look at Yang Kai, “Do you think this Monarch is reluctant to kill you? If you think so, you are very wrong. I will definitely get what I want even after killing you.”

He gently nodded while speaking, “I’ve decided! I’ll start with you!”

The words had just left Black Crow Divine Monarch’s mouth when Yang Kai immediately took out a Wooden Token from his Space Ring and hung it around his waist. He then grinned at Black Crow Divine Monarch with a smug look, “Go ahead, try if you dare!”

Black Crow Divine Monarch glanced at the Wooden Token fearfully, his face twitching at the sight. The incident earlier had traumatised him as he had been ignorant of the situation. Just as he was prepared to kill Pei Wen Xuan, he was cut down by the Divine Ability sealed within the Identity Token that hung from Pei Wen Xuan’s waist. If not for the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture, he would have died from that attack.

As the saying went, ‘Once bitten, twice shy’. He now felt very troubled whenever he saw such a thing.

Unbeknownst to him, Yang Kai’s Wooden Token and Pei Wen Xuan’s Identity Token were completely different items. This Wooden Token was given to him by the Proprietress previously. It was engraved with an inexplicable pattern of a totem. She had claimed that it was a ‘favour’. Therefore, there was no Divine Ability sealed within. On the other hand, he also held a Divine Ability Bead that was given to him by the Proprietress. That was his greatest trump card.

Black Crow Divine Monarch gave Yang Kai a hateful look. Then, he turned to look at Qu Hua Shang.

Qu Hua Shang was no fool either so she gently reached out and tapped the Identity Token hanging at her waist.

[These Juniors… are too much!] Black Crow Divine Monarch felt a great sense of hatred.

“Divine Monarch, if you wish to kill somebody, then there’s a good candidate right there!” Yang Kai pointed in Pie Wen Xuan’s direction, “You ‘died’ at his hands just now. It’s a good opportunity for you to take revenge for what happened!”

Pei Wen Xuan was already coughing, but he nearly spat blood at those words. He gritted his teeth and snarled, “Yang Kai, this Pei will never forgive you if I die in this place, not even if I turn into a ghost!”

Yang Kai replied scornfully, “What has that got to do with me?”

Pei Wen Xuan was so filled with hatred that his teeth hurt, but there was nothing he could say or do. His Identity Token had been destroyed, so he no longer had a deterrent. If Black Crow Divine Monarch really attacked him, then he could only fight to the death.

“I’ll do as you wish then!” Black Crow Divine Monarch nodded.

His body suddenly transformed into a blood ray that charged towards Pei Wen Xuan. He had been ‘killed’ by the Sword Light Divine Ability earlier and severely damaged his foundation as a result. At this moment, he desperately needed to replenish his strength. Since he did not dare to touch Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang, he could only target easy prey like Pei Wen Xuan. After he slaughtered Pei Wen Xuan, it would not be too late for him to slowly torture the other two to death. In any case, the Grand Hall had been completely sealed shut so there was no fear that they might escape.

When Pei Wen Xuan saw that Black Crow Divine Monarch was charging towards him again, he felt a mixture of fear and rage. He let out a fierce roar and his Demon Qi churned violently. Raising his hand, he summoned his Coiling Dragon Shears and sliced through the blood light with them.

The Coiling Dragon Shears was a powerful artifact and the energy fluctuations that it emitted were by no means weak. Even so, the light flickered erratically when it sank into the blood light and its spirituality dropped sharply!

Qu Hua Shang had encountered the exact same situation just now. The blood light seemed to be extremely damaging and resistant towards artifacts.

Pei Wen Xuan turned pale in shock and involuntarily backed away while hastily forming a set of hand seals with both hands. One after another, a barrage of fierce attacks rained down on the blood light without any restraint. The explosions rang out endlessly as each of these attacks were defeated. The blood light flashed towards him like lightning, continuously shooting out blood-coloured blasts from within the blood light. The attacks were so oppressive that he was forced to retreat in a miserable fashion.

Even if Black Crow Divine Monarch had been cut down once and suffered heavy damage to his foundation as a result, Pei Wen Xuan was still not capable of being his opponent. Rather, it could even be said that how long Pei Wen Xuan could last under those attacks was a problem in and of itself.

In just a few breaths of time, Pei Wen Xuan could feel that he had reached his limits. At this moment, he felt the pressure lightening all of a sudden as Black Crow Divine Monarch’s evil laugh entered his ears, “Junior, you truly are insidious and cunning. Did you think this Monarch would not be wary of you!?”

The blood light that was approaching him halted without warning and Pei Wen Xuan looked up to see that Black Crow Divine Monarch had revealed his figure. Black Crow Divine Monarch had one hand blocking an attack to his side. Amidst the dense Blood Qi, Yang Kai had arrived with a spear in his hands at some point in time. It was just that he was trapped in the Blood Qi. It was like being stuck in a quagmire, making his movements extremely sluggish. That was not all. Sizzling sounds were coming from his body and it was obvious that the Blood Qi was corroding away at him.

Pei Wen Xuan immediately understood the situation. Yang Kai’s sneak attack caused Black Crow Divine Monarch to have no choice but to focus on dealing with him. That was definitely the reason why the pressure had suddenly eased off him just now. It could even be said that it was Yang Kai who rescued Pei Wen Xuan at the critical moment.

Even so, Pei Wen Xuan was not grateful. [This bastard sent Black Crow Divine Monarch after me. How abominable!]

Taking advantage of Black Crow Divine Monarch’s distraction, Pei Wen Xuan’s figure flashed consecutively, finally putting some distance between him and the other party, which gave him some breathing space.

As one of Myriad Demons Heaven’s Core Disciples, he was practically an invincible existence among those beneath the Open Heaven Realm. The fact that he could be defeated in such a short span of time only served to show just how powerful Black Crow Divine Monarch was. Moreover, this was after Black Crow Divine Monarch had been ‘killed’ already. If this were before he had suffered death once, how much strength could he have exerted?

For a moment, Pei Wen Xuan was both thankful and frustrated. He was thankful that Black Crow Divine Monarch was heavily injured at the moment but frustrated that his Identity Token was gone as a result.

Inside the Blood Qi that resembled a quagmire, Yang Kai’s movements were sluggish but his expression was calm as he roared, “Break!”

A small pitch-black light appeared at the top of the Azure Dragon Spear. When this pitch-black dot appeared, it was only the size of a pea; however, it immediately expanded wildly and turned into a massive black hole. Everything instantly collapsed!

...

Rupture!
