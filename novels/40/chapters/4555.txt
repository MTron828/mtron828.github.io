The air was quiet, and a million-kilometre area around the Territory Gate was like a forbidden zone that nobody dared to approach. Even those who were in a hurry were unwilling to get too close.

Everyone knew that this was the entrance to the Black Territory, and they also knew how ruthless a woman Luan Bai Feng was. If they were to bump into her along the way, then they just might be captured and brought to the Black Prison to become ore slaves.

Yang Kai remained alone, quietly waiting.

The bait had been cast, but he could not be sure of whether the fish would take it or not. He had only agreed with Xin Peng that if Luan Bai Feng were to leave the Black Prison from another Territory Gate, he would find a way to inform him about it. That would also give Yang Kai time to adjust his plans.

Five days had passed since Xin Peng returned to the Black Territory, but there was still no movement at the Territory Gate.

On the sixth day, however, the Heavens seemingly heard Yang Kai’s pleas and a ship suddenly sailed out of the Territory Gate. Yang Kai, who was watching for any movements from afar, saw the ship as soon as it appeared.

What was certain was that, indeed, it was one of Black Prison’s ships!

However, he did not make his move immediately because he could not guarantee that Luan Bai Feng was aboard. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Concealing his aura and figure, he continued to watch closely.

At a certain moment, a brilliant light suddenly shot out from the ship. Naturally, it was the signal that he had agreed on with Xin Peng!

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, and his body flashed, lunging towards the boat at the speed of lightning.

In the uppermost cabin of the ship, Luan Bai Feng was sitting on her chair, twirling her finger around her hair with a contemplative look on her face. She had no idea why, but she had been feeling restless since leaving the Black Territory, as if something bad was about to happen.

This feeling made her extremely alert.

It was at that moment that a clear energy fluctuation rippled out from a certain part of the ship. She quickly turned her head to the window and, from the corner of her eye, caught a stream of light erupting and illuminating a large space.

Luan Bai Feng’s face paled. Spreading out her Divine Sense, she quickly detected a person leaving the ship and heading out at high speed.

“Xin Peng!” Murderous intent blazed in Luan Bai Feng’s eyes as she shouted his name through gritted teeth. Even though she had no idea why Xin Peng would betray her, the blinding Secret Technique from before was obviously some sort of code agreed upon by Xin Peng and some other party.

Before she even had any time to think about the situation, Luan Bai Feng quickly felt a familiar aura rapidly approaching her and a voice boomed, “Luan Bai Feng, suffer death!”

“Yang Kai!?” Luan Bai Feng was startled by the voice and turned her head towards the direction where the aura was coming from.

She had encountered Yang Kai twice before, so naturally, she was familiar with his aura.

There, in her vision, she saw Yang Kai rapidly approaching just as she had expected.

Luan Bai Feng’s first thought that it must be some sort of trap, and that Void Land’s army was ambushing her. She could possibly be surrounded at any moment and killed; however, from what she could detect, there was no army, only Yang Kai alone in this place.

“Brat who does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! You court death!” Luan Bai Feng began to move as she screamed, leaping through the window as she formed a set of hand seals and pushed her World Force before throwing out a palm at the approaching enemy.

Even though she did not understand why Yang Kai would come to ambush her by himself, she did not want to miss such a golden opportunity. If she was able to capture Yang Kai, then she would be able to offer him up as a great gift to Zuo Quan Hui. Then, once the battle against Void Land was over, her words would hold much more power, allowing her to get more ore slaves from Void Land.

Even though she did not use her full strength, it was still not something that an ordinary Open Heaven Realm Master would be able to withstand, not even for one in the Sixth-Order. She had advanced to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm many centuries ago, so the heritage that she accumulated was extremely rich.

Faced with this palm, Yang Kai simply met it with a sneer as he shouted, “The one who does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth... is you!”

World Force erupted and their auras clashed as the two figures rapidly approached each other!

Luan Bai Feng’s face changed, and her eyes went wide!

[Xin Peng was right, this brat... is really in the Sixth-Order!]

The moment their World Forces collided, Luan Bai Feng was able to sense this clearly. The World Force possessed by her opponent was definitely not something that a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivator would be able to bring out. Yang Kai was definitely a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and not an ordinary one at that!

Luan Bai Feng had never felt this sort of oppression from any other Sixth-Order Master before. When her own World Force was faced with her opponent’s power, it was smashed apart like it was dry weeds or rotten wood. It was her total defeat!

Jolting in realization of the situation, Luan Bai Feng no longer dared to hold back. With her Small Universe’s illusory phantom flickering behind her, she immediately went all out!

However, she was still unable to block her opponent’s attack. Yang Kai’s palm practically crushed and flattened all the obstacles in front of him. Breaking through the force of Luan Bai Feng’s palm, he quickly cut their distance of 1,000 kilometres to zero.

In the next instant, the large palm enveloped in World Force struck Luan Bai Feng’s towering chest.

Her ribs sank down from the force as a look of horror and shock emerged on Luan Bai Feng’s face. Fresh blood spurted out of her mouth, and her aura deflated significantly.

They were both in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but she could not even withstand a single palm from Yang Kai and was severely wounded with just one hit!

However, this woman had presided over the Black Prison for so many years, so she naturally had some real ability. The moment she sensed she was at a disadvantage, she immediately used the force of the recoil to put distance between her and Yang Kai. At the same time, her wrist turned and revealed an Array Plate; launching it straight in Yang Kai’s direction, she shouted, “Open!”

The Array Plate activated, and the Killing Array that was engraved into it spread out in a flash, enveloping hundreds of kilometres in an instant. A violent power erupted from it, transforming into countless attacks that changed the area within the radius into a slaughtering field.

Luan Bai Feng did not pause, however. Although her Array Plate was powerful, judging from the strike that Yang Kai displayed earlier, she knew it would be impossible to stop him with just that. Her Array Plate would delay him for a couple dozen breaths at the most.

Still, that was enough time. She had barely left the Black Territory, so with a few dozen breaths, she could still return.

As long as she could cross the Territory Gate, with the help of the countless Natural Arrays present within, she could exert a strength that was far beyond her own. Forget Yang Kai being a Sixth-Order Master, even if he was in the Seventh-Order, once he was inside her territory, he should not even dream of leaving unscathed.

Having suffered such a huge loss out of nowhere, the hatred gathered in Luan Bai Feng’s heart had already reached the Heavens, so even while she was escaping, she was already thinking of how she was going to take revenge on Yang Kai for this.

However, only 100 kilometres away from Black Territory’s Territory Gate, Luan Bai Feng suddenly stopped and stood in awe, staring at the figure that blocked her path.

Yang Kai stood with a spear in hand that was pointing forward as he grinned widely, “Since I already know about your attainments in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, how could I not be prepared to deal with you?”

“How did you...” Luan Bai Feng was in disbelief.

“You think you were able to trap me in that Killing Array? The Dao of Space is too profound for a woman like you to comprehend!” Yang Kai snickered, “You want to return to the Black Territory? That’s not an option!”

Luan Bai Feng ground her teeth. At the same time as when her body drifted backwards, she summoned three more Array Plates into her hands. However, before she could even toss out the three Array Plates, Yang Kai had disappeared from in front of her.

A great sense of crisis loomed over her. Luan bai Feng raised her hand and was about to ignore everything else to throw down the Array Plates when she felt a sting in her wrist. Her vision became a blur, and Yang Kai was already in front of her, his broad chest practically pressing against hers as his hot breath blew on her face, “I have a great use for you alive, so don’t force me to kill you!”

Luan Bai Feng looked down to see that her hand that was holding the Array Plates had been pierced through by a spear and was covered in blood!

A cold feeling flooded her from her head down to her toes as Luan Bai Feng froze in place. Her eyes quivered, and her mind was a chaotic mess.

How could someone who was merely in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm possibly be this strong? She did not even have the ability to fight back in front of this man. It could almost be said that her life or death was in the palm of his hand.

Raising her head, Luan Bai Feng stared at Yang Kai who was right in front of her, gritting her teeth and asking, “What are you going to do?”

Yang Kai grinned, “I told you, I need you alive, so don’t be so nervous. If you obediently cooperate with me, then naturally, there will be no harm to your life.”

Luan Bai Feng blinked, “You want to cooperate with me?”

“A wise person will submit to the circumstances!” Yang Kai nodded. Then, he took out the Loyalty List and said with an amiable expression, “Come come come, leave your name in your Blood Essence here!”

Luan Bai Feng glanced at the Loyalty list, and her pretty face sank, “Loyalty List? This thing is in your possession?”

“It’s good that you know it, that saves me the effort of having to explain,” Yang Kai smiled.

Luan Bei Feng sneered, “If I leave my name on the Loyalty List, then won’t I be under your control forever, never to have freedom again?”

“Indeed!”

“Then I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. I’d rather die!”

Yang Kai looked indifferently at her, “You only have one chance, so choose well. If you pick the right answer, then you get to live. Otherwise... you die!”

Luan Bai Feng turned her head away and snorted, taking up the stance of a woman who was prepared for death.

Yang Kai nodded, “For a woman to have such a backbone... There are many men who cannot compare to you. That is worth admiring. In that case, let me send you on your way!”

At the end of his sentence, Yang Kai brought his hand down on Luan Bai Feng’s head, and Golden Crow’s True Fire burst from his palm, instantly turning her into a ball of fire.

Miserable screams filled the air as Luan Bai Feng’s entire body was enveloped by the pitch-black Golden Crow’s True Fire. Of course, there was no way for her to die in a short time thanks to her strong vitality; however, her cultivation, which was only in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, was not enough for her to extinguish the Golden Crow’s True Fire. In the face of doom, she was cursed to endure indescribable torment and suffering.

“You’re really going to kill me!?” Luan Bai Feng asked as she screamed in agony; after all, Yang Kai told her earlier that he had a use for her alive, yet now he was actually trying to kill her in the blink of an eye. His mood changed faster than one could flip pages in a book!

Yang Kai remained silent as he watched her indifferently with a cold look in his eyes, as if he were seeing her off from this plane of existence.

Luan Bai Feng panicked. Death was a terrifying thought, and though she knew that Yang Kai was merely trying to force her hand with this method, she was still frightened by his ruthlessness and determination. If this were to continue, then she might really die!

“Please spare me, I’ll do as you ask!” Luan Bai Feng shouted.

When Yang Kai raised his hand and grabbed at her again, the blaze of the Golden Crow’s True Fire that enveloped Luan Bai Feng’s body seemed to have a life of its own and quickly returned to his palm.

“You should have said so earlier, then you wouldn’t have had to suffer so much.”
