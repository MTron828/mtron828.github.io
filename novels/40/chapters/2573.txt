Their appearance seemed to have made some noise as a Monster Race member came rushing over from not too far away to check things out. But before he could approach closer, the Monster King let out a low roar before rushing like a bolt of lightning, pouncing straight at the Monster Race member.

A miserable cry immediately resounded as the Monster Race member was knocked to the ground without even seeing who had sneak attacked him. The Monster King opened his mouth and bit his victim’s neck, swallowing his blood in large gulps. For a moment, the Monster Race member thrown on the ground miserably howled and wailed as he continued to struggle, but he wasn’t able to get free and gradually his struggle and wails died down.

After a while, the Monster King got up and turned around, wiping the blood off the corners of his mouth.

The Monster Race member’s blood seemed to have provided him a lot of energy, and his skinny and ragged figure had improved a lot; at least, his skin had regained a bit of luster, and his figure had become a little bulkier. Even his dwindling vitality had improved a little.

He glanced at Yang Kai with a complicated look in his eyes, but finally, he lowered his head and heavily sighed.

“What should I call you, Monster King?” Yang Kai asked.

“Xie Wu Wei!” The Monster King snappily replied; however, seeing that Yang Kai had no intention of disregarding him just because he was a Soul Slave now, he felt relieved. He was afraid that Yang Kai would throw insults and abuse him after bringing him out. If that were the case, he would definitely not be able to bear it with his explosive temper.

“Fearless and dauntless! A good name, Monster King!” Yang Kai smiled.

Xie Wu Wei responded, waving off, “It’s nothing like that!” After being silent for a while, he asked, “What should this King call you?”

Yang Kai replied, “You can call me Young Master Yang.”

Xie Wu Wei lightly nodded before speaking, “Young Master Yang, earlier you said that this King would need to do something for you, I wonder what exactly that is?”

He couldn’t wait to finish Yang Kai’s task and then try to get rid of his control, and he made no attempt to hide his intentions.

“There’s no rush,” Yang Kai chided, “First take me back to your base, then we will talk about what I want you to do. It needs many people.”

[Back to my base!?] Xie Wu Wei looked annoyed. As one of the thirty-two Monster Kings, he had a distinguished status, and it wouldn’t look good if someone saw him with a Human. Worse, if he were to be seen taking orders from a Human, how would he show his old face in the future?

Yang Kai could tell what was going on in his mind and added, “Monster King, rest assured, I won’t make things difficult for you. If your subordinates ask, you can tell them that this Young Master is your friend from outside. It’s okay for Ancient Lands’ Monster Race members to make one or two Human friends, right?”

Xie Wu Wei’s brow twitched as he reluctantly agreed, “Fine.”

With his Soul Brand being controlled by Yang Kai, how could he disobey? He was under the eaves now and had no choice but to bow his head.

Afterwards, the three figures used their respective Movement Skills, making a beeline towards the depths of the Ancient Lands.

Xie Wu Wei was quite familiar with the Ancient Wild Lands and led Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi forward without trying to hide his tracks.

A few ignorant Monster Race members came to investigate, but they all became Xie Wu Wei’s supplements.

Half a day later, a towering mountain appeared before the trio. There were some buildings hidden on this mountain, and after taking a closer look, Yang Kai discovered that those buildings were made of large and small stones. They didn’t have any beauty at all, looking rough and wild, just like the Monster Race’s temperament.

On the mountainside, there were countless caves, with many Monster Race members living in them.

Yang Kai and the others flew over, obviously alarming the Monster Race members living on the mountain. They immediately walked out of the cave to investigate, but before they could clearly see who had come, the trio had already rushed into the main hall.

In the hall, the few beautiful maids present fearfully looked at Xie Wu Wei before bowing and greeting, “Sir!”

Xie Wu Wei was in a bad mood, so he didn’t bother to care about these maids. He didn’t even cast them a sidelong glance and rushed straight in. But Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi, following Xie Wu Wei, had immediately provoked the maids.

After all, the two of them had no Monster Qi around them and were clearly Humans. They couldn’t fathom why Xie Wu Wei would bring back two Humans from his trip, and judging by the Humans’ appearances, they didn’t seem to be prisoners.

In the main hall, there was a throne made of white bones from who knows what Monster Beast. Xie Wu Wei walked straight ahead, turned around, flicked his robes, and sat down on the throne, looking around with his tiger-like fierce eyes, his actions giving him a sense of majesty.

But soon, Xie Wu Wei looked a little embarrassed.

After having returned to his home, his heart was finally at peace, making him forget his own predicament, but when he saw Yang Kai gazing at him with a smile, Xie Wu Wei quickly stood back up.

“Monster King, just sit down. We are just your friends from the outside,” Yang Kai sent him a voice transmission. He could tell that this Monster King had an unyielding temperament; therefore, he didn’t want to make things too difficult for him. After all, Yang Kai needed him to do something and didn’t care about such superficial things.

Xie Wu Wei felt grateful, thinking that this Human was at least reasonable, allowing his repulsion from before to lessen. So, he sat back down and said, stretching his hand, “Young Master Yang, please take a seat!”

Yang Kai slightly smiled and walked to the side and found a seat to sit. As he looked around, he found that this place was far more sophisticated than Yang You Wei’s place; the two couldn’t compare whether it was in terms of style nor in layout. A Monster King was a Monster King in the end, a trivial Monster General like Yang You Wei simply couldn’t be put on par with him. Just as he arrived, Yang Kai felt the auras of many Twelfth-Order Monster Beasts, which were equal to Emperor Realm Human Masters.

[Just a single Monster King has so many Emperor Realm Masters among his subordinates, so how many do the thirty-two Monster Kings have in total? Not to mention, there are four Divine Spirits in the Ancient Wild Lands.]

[If so many Monster Beasts and Monster Race members went out, unless the Ten Great Emperors joined forces, I’m afraid they could sweep through the entire Star Boundary.]

[The Ancient Wild Lands can’t be underestimated!]

Zhang Ruo Xi, who was obediently standing behind Yang Kai, was also curiously looking around with her pretty eyes.

“Come in!” Xie Wu Wei yelled in a deep voice.

Six Monster Race members with imposing auras promptly entered the hall, all of them seemingly having been waiting for a long time. Each and every one of them exuded a powerful pressure. Yang Kai’s pupils immediately shrank at the sight of them as all of them were Mid-Level Twelfth-Order, equal to Second-Order Emperor Realm.

The six Monster Race Masters entered the main hall and respectfully greeted, cupping their fists, “Greetings, Sir!”

Xie Wu Wei gestured to them to dispense with the ceremony before speaking, “Nothing happened while this King was away, right?”

He also didn’t tell his subordinates that he had accidentally fallen into the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb; otherwise, he would be unable to explain how he got out.

A thin Monster Race member on the left immediately stepped forward and spoke, cupping his fists, “Reporting to Sir, there is something your subordinate wishes to report.”

“What is it?” Xie Wu Wei indifferently asked, without so much as raising his eyes, simply sipping the tea from the cup handed to him by the maid at his side. Who knows what was used to brew the tea, but it was red and thick like blood and exuded a strange aroma.

When the thin Monster Race member heard this, he hesitatingly glanced at Yang Kai, who was sitting on the side, and stopped talking.

Clearly, he didn’t want to make a report in front of a Human to prevent leaking of secrets.

Xie Wu Wei, taking another sip and putting down the cup, raised his eyes and stated, “You may speak freely, Young Master Yang is this King’s life and death friend. There is nothing to hide.”

He was also helpless in this situation as now his Soul Brand was in Yang Kai’s hands; his life and death were just a matter of Yang Kai’s whims. Even if he wanted to make Yang Kai leave, he couldn’t do so; he was completely powerless and secretly regretting it. If he had known how awkward this would be earlier, he would not have summoned his subordinates in. Now that things had come to this though, he could only choke down his grievances and let his subordinates report on whatever matters.

The Monster Race members were also taken aback when they heard this. When they saw a Human sitting in the hall earlier, they were filled with suspicion. They had no idea about his origins, or why Sir Monster King was treating a mere Human like this, but when they heard Xie Wu Wei mention that he was a ‘life and death friend’, they were even more shocked.

[When did Sir Monster King have such a good friendship with a Human?]

But then they recalled that Sir Monster King had once left the Ancient Lands several dozen years ago. Apparently, he had gone to the Human world to explore and rumour had it that it was an extremely dangerous trip and Sir Monster King almost lost his life. Later, they heard that the Monster King was rescued by a certain Human, which finally allowed him to return to the Ancient Lands safe and sound.

Unknowingly, the Monster Race members connected Yang Kai to Xie Wu Wei’s benefactor, who had saved Xie Wu Wei’s life. Suddenly, the arrogance and disdain in their eyes had lessened a lot.

The thin Monster Race member reported in a heavy voice, “Sir, the Blood Gate showed some changes!”

“Blood Gate!” Xie Wu Wei momentarily paused before looking up at his subordinate in shock. The latter slightly nodded in confirmation. Immediately, Xie Wu Wei’s breathing became rapid as he quickly asked, “Is this news correct?”

The Monster Race member replied, “It’s certainly true. It was first discovered by Monster King Xi Lei’s subordinate, but many saw the event and confirmed it happened. Now, the change in the Blood Gate has already alarmed even the four Divine Venerables and they have deployed people to investigate.”

Xie Wu Wei suddenly lost his calm, standing up and hurriedly ordering, “Tell me the details.”

“Yes!” The Monster Race member replied, arranging his thoughts before continuing, “It happened over a month ago, when the Blood Gate suddenly emitted a blood red beam straight up into the sky, but that only lasted a moment. However, during this past month, the Blood Gate has obviously become a little different from before, seemingly radiating a kind of intense energy fluctuation. Many people couldn’t help but want to rush in when they got close, but all who tried lost their lives.”

“Bloodline attraction!?” A crazed look immediately appeared in Xie Wu Wei’s eyes.

The Monster Race member agreed with a nod, “We hypothesised as much as well. Your subordinate risked his life to explore and found that the Blood Gate could indeed tempt your subordinate, making him have an impulse to rush in. If it weren’t for Shu Yu and the others quickly awakening and dragging him back, your subordinate might have already lost his life! All signs indicate that the Blood Gate is about to open and that the ancient rumours were true.”

Xie Wu Wei looked excited after hearing this, beginning to pace back and forth on the podium, folding his hands behind his back. After a while, he finally stopped and asked in a serious voice, “What are the Divine Venerables’s intentions?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Monster Race member replied, “The Divine Venerables have issued a joint command, asking us to not believe false rumours and lose our lives meaninglessly. Now, the eight Great Kings have been dispatched near the Blood Gate and are blockading the area near the it, preventing anyone from approaching.”

“False rumours!?” Xie Wu Wei sneered, “Bloodline attraction can only be caused by instinct. Do the Divine Venerables think that everything will be fine if they seal everyone’s mouth? I’m afraid that they are just worried about the emergence of one or two new Divine Venerables, which would affect their status.”
