Zuo Qiu Ming took a glance at Tao Ling Wan and added, “I’m sure Martial Niece Tao won’t mind it either.”

A blushing Tao Ling Wan hung her head low and remained silent.

Chen Xiu quickly waved his hands, “She definitely won’t mind it. The more the merrier.”

After a nod, Zuo Qiu Ming gazed at Yang Kai, “Martial Nephew, you have the final say in when to hold the wedding. When your partners come together one day, and you happen to be free, you have to inform us earlier. We’ll hold a grand wedding for you.”

A grateful Yang Kai cupped his fist, “Many thanks, Sect Master. I will not forget this favour.”

Zuo Qiu Ming ran his fingers through his beard, “Since we’re one family, you don’t have to be overly polite with me. Although you come from a less desirable background, your capabilities are unrivalled among the disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises of the same generation. We are fortunate to have you get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

Chen Xiu played along by saying, “That’s right. Although there are a lot of bright disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises in this generation, and they will be the pillars of strength in their respective Sects in the future, none of their achievements are comparable to yours, Nephew Yang. Senior Brother Xu does have acute vision, and Martial Niece Qu is truly lucky.”

Yang Kai frowned, “Sect Master, I have a request when it comes to getting married into your Sect.”

“Go ahead,” Zuo Qiu Ming replied.

“It wouldn’t have mattered if I were on my own. I would’ve been more than willing to get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and rely on your Sect; however, I’m sure you’re aware of my situation. As the Lord of Void Land and the Palace Master of High Heaven Palace, I have to provide for hundreds of thousands of people. I’m afraid it’s not appropriate for me to get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

“What’s not appropriate about it?” Zuo Qiu Ming asked.

Yang Kai said, “Let me ask you, Sect Master. If I get married into your Sect, what will happen to Void Land and High Heaven Palace?”

Zuo Qiu Ming replied, “They will become subsidiaries of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

On the side, Chen Xiu said, “Nephew Yang, there are some precedents that are similar to your situation. Many of the subsidiaries of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven belong to Sect Masters who got married into our Sect, so you don’t have to worry about it. If you get married into our Sect, you’ll still have full control over Void Land and High Heaven Palace, and we won’t interfere in any way. It’s just that there’s a Master Sect on paper. Moreover, with Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s protection, Void Land and High Heaven Palace will be safer. This is a good thing.”

Yang Kai shook his head, “Let’s put Void Land aside for now. Void Land might be fairly powerful compared to other great forces, but it’s still insignificant when compared to the Cave Heavens and Paradises. Nevertheless, High Heaven Palace is different. The World Tree in the Star Boundary is the centre of attention in the entire 3,000 Worlds. The Cave Heavens and Paradises have all set up Dao Temples in the Star Boundary, and there are senior experts who look for disciples with excellent aptitudes in that place year round. It’s the same case for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. If High Heaven Palace becomes a subsidiary of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, the Star Boundary will be your Sect’s territory as well. Even if I am fine with that, the other Cave Heavens and Paradises won’t agree to it.”

Zuo Qiu Ming said, “If that’s what you’re worried about, you can set your mind at ease. We’ll deal with it appropriately so that the other great forces won’t have any complaints.”

Yang Kai shook his head again, “It’s still inappropriate.”

Regardless of what Zuo Qiu Ming and Chen Xiu said, once Void Land and High Heaven Palace became subordinate Sects of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, there would be complications. As the leader of both Sects, Yang Kai had to take their future into consideration.

Moreover, he had the intention to develop Void Land or High Heaven Palace into one of the Cave Heavens and Paradises one day. If they became Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s subsidiaries, he would never achieve his goal.

Zuo Qiu Ming narrowed his eyes, “What opinion do you have then, Martial Nephew?”

“I wouldn’t dare to say that it’s an opinion,” Yang Kai said humbly. He had already expected this kind of situation, so he was well prepared, “What I mean is that I’m not going to get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Instead, I’ll marry Senior Sister Qu and bring her back with me.”

Zuo Qiu Ming arched his brow.

A stunned Chen Xiu gazed at Yang Kai, “Nephew Yang, even though there have been disciples of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven who married outsiders and left the Sect, those were the marriages between the Cave Heavens and Paradises. Other than the Cave Heavens and Paradises, those who want to marry our disciples have no choice but to get married into our Sect. This is the case even for common disciples, not to mention that Martial Niece Qu is a noble Core Disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

Zuo Qiu Ming nodded, “Since time immemorial, the Core Disciples of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven have never married outsiders and left the Sect. Besides our Sect, it’s the same case for the other Cave Heavens and Paradises. If you don’t believe me, you can ask around. If you can find such a precedent, I will agree to your request.”

Those who could become Core Disciples must have directly ascended to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, and they had a chance to become Eighth-Order Ancestors in their respective Sects.

It was expected that such disciples were treasured in the Cave Heavens and Paradises, and these Sects would never let them go.

Yang Kai argued by saying, “Precedents can be created.”

Zuo Qiu Ming shook his head, “We won’t make an exception for you, Martial Nephew.”

His firm stance suggested that he wouldn’t be easily persuaded by Yang Kai, who didn’t expect he could do it with ease anyways.

On the side, Chen Xiu asked, “Have you discussed this matter with Martial Niece Qu before, Nephew?”

Yang Kai shook his head as he had never mentioned this to Qu Hua Shang before; however, he believed that after they went through nine reincarnations together, she would support any decisions he made.

“Why don’t you ask Martial Niece Qu about it? If she’s willing to get married and leave the Sect, we’ll continue talking about it.”

“There’s no need for that.”

It wasn’t that Yang Kai didn’t respect Qu Hua Shang’s opinion; however, if he really asked her about it, she would be put in a tight spot. On the one hand, there was the partner she was engaged to and had gone through nine reincarnations with. On the other hand, there was the Master Sect that had nurtured her for years. Regardless of what decision she would make, her conscience would never be at ease.

“Sect Master.” Yang Kai cupped his fist and gazed at Zuo Qiu Ming, “I know that there are rules in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and Senior Sister Qu is a noble Core Disciple of your Sect. If she gets married and leaves the Sect, it will be a huge loss for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. On the most basic of levels, if I marry Senior Sister Qu, your Sect will lose a potential Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in the future.”

While Zuo Qiu Ming remained silent, Chen Xiu nodded, “That is indeed just one part of the picture.”

Yang Kai went on to say, “Yin-Yang Cave Heaven will lose a potential Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but what if I can make sure that you’ll have more Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in the future? Will you agree to my request then?”

Zuo Qiu Ming’s interest had been piqued, “What can you do that will allow us to have more Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in the future?”

Chen Xiu raised his eyebrow and made a speculation, “Is it the World Tree in the Star Boundary?”

“It’s not the World Tree.”

The nourishment from the World Tree could indeed raise a cultivator’s potential and allow them to achieve greater heights; however, that was the general trend in the 3,000 Worlds. 1,000 years later, all the Cave Heavens and Paradises would benefit from it, so Yin-Yang Cave Heaven wasn’t the only one.”

Yang Kai gazed at Zuo Qiu Ming, “Sect Master, if you agree, I will tell you everything. However, if you don’t agree, it’s pointless for me to say anything further.”

Zuo Qiu Ming replied with a smile, “You have to make yourself clear so that I can make a judgement; otherwise, how will I know if you’re just making things up?”

“Certainly, I wouldn’t make things up when it comes to such a matter.”

And so, both sides fell into a deadlock. Zuo Qiu Ming wanted to find out why Yang Kai had the confidence to make such a claim. On the other hand, Yang Kai wanted the Sect Master to agree to his terms first before he would tell him anything.

Chen Xiu tried to probe him, but Yang Kai wouldn’t reveal anything. This made the two leaders of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven doubt whether Yang Kai was really capable of achieving what he said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They would have run out of patience by now if Yang Kai was anyone else.

However, he had just made a huge contribution by bringing two important disciples out of the Samsara Pavilion, so Zuo Qiu Ming wouldn’t be stern to him. Certainly, Chen Xiu wouldn’t dare to do that as well since he still hoped there would be a proper arrangement for his Disciple. He remained polite while probing the younger man.

One hour later, Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang left since both parties hadn’t come to any agreement.

Nevertheless, it was a good start in Yang Kai’s eyes.

He had already made his stance clear, and those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would have to slowly accept it.

As Yang Kai walked alongside Qu Hua Shang, he suddenly asked, “Do you blame me, Senior Sister?”

Qu Hua Shang turned her head and flashed a smile at him, “Blame you for not discussing the matter with me in advance?”

“Yes.”

Qu Hua Shang replied with a smile, “Since it happened suddenly, you didn’t have time to discuss it with me.” Right after they left the Samsara Pavilion, they witnessed Luo Ting He’s ascension. Following that, they were summoned by the Sect Master.

As she spoke, she wrapped her arm around Yang Kai’s and rested her head on his shoulder, “Honoured Master used to tell me that a woman has to follow her man wherever he goes. To me, it makes no difference whether you get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven or bring me out of the Sect; however, it’s a different case for the others.”

She was talking about Su Yan and the others.

If Yang Kai really got married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Su Yan and the others naturally had to come over as well. By then, they would be living under someone else’s roof. Certainly, those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven wouldn’t oppress them; however, if something unexpected happened one day, they might feel aggrieved.

“But how are you going to persuade Sect Master and the others? Since Honoured Master isn’t around, no one else can help you with it,” Qu Hua Shang asked curiously.

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “I’m prepared to pay a hefty price to buy you.”

Qu Hua Shang stared at him before scoffing, “You want to buy me? You will have to spend a fortune then, for I’m very expensive.”

“Regardless of how high the price is, I’ll accept it as long as they’re willing to let you go.”

Qu Hua Shang giggled, “It’ll cost you an arm and a leg. You’d best be prepared.”

Over the following days, Yang Kai followed Qu Hua Shang to visit the Spirit Provinces in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and take in the sights. He had never felt more at ease as he left behind the conflicts and carnage that he had always been tangled up with over the past many years, giving him an almost surreal feel.

Ten days later, two visitors arrived at Qu Hua Shang’s residence.

The visitors surprised Yang Kai, but it was also somewhat within his expectation. He asked with a smile, “Martial Aunts, are you here to persuade me?”

Luo Ting He remained as willful as ever. Although she was now an Eighth-Order Ancestor in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, she still sat directly with her legs crossed on a chair and munched on a delicious spirit fruit she took out from somewhere. As she was having her snack, she said, “I’m annoyed by that brat surnamed Zuo. He insists on making me ask you what you’re up to. I decided to come here since I was unable to brush him off.”
