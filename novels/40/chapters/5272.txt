The creation of the Great Passes dated back to ancient times, and over countless years, generations after generations had built upon the foundations that were there until they were able to reach the scale they had today.

Even though there had been many expansions, the core of each Great Pass would not change too much, firstly because of how important these locations were that even the slightest change may disrupt everything, and secondly because they were powerless to even change anything due to the loss of understanding.

For example, the Grand Hall where the Space Array was located.

This Grand Hall contained a very ancient aura, a legacy of the ancient Great Expert’s work that contained mysteries that were beyond the reach of this generation’s cultivators.

The same was true of the Universe Temples in the Great Territories of the 3,000 Worlds. All of these were legacies of ancient Great Experts.

So, when several Universe Temples fell into disrepair, the Cave Heavens and Paradises were unable to fix them and they were simply allowed to fall into decay until Yang Kai appeared. With the help of the Universe Array inside of the Universe Temples, he gained further enlightenment in the Dao of Space while simultaneously comprehending how to repair and even construct new Universe Arrays.

The Universe Arrays in the Universe Temples and the Hyper Space Arrays in the Great Passes were products of the same era and thus had many similarities.

Yang Kai was able to arrange a Universe Array, so naturally, it was no trouble for him to repair the Space Array here.

It only took time and effort.

After working for half a year, Yang Kai finally completed the repairs.

Inside the Grand Hall, several highly respected Array Masters were gathered together, and when they saw Yang Kai standing at the center of the array, a bald Grandmaster yelled out, “Yang Boy, will it succeed this time?”

This Array Master had high achievements and had reached the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Reasonably, he should not be affected by the ails of mortals, but somehow, his head had gone bald.

Yang Kai gave him a thumbs up, “Definitely!”

Another Array Master, who was as fat as a ball snickered at his words, “That’s what you said last time, and that’s also what you said the time before that when you almost destroyed this thing. Yang Boy, if you’re not confident, then please don’t attempt it.”

During the past half a year, there had been bumps in the road to repairing the array. Many times, after the repairs were ‘completed’ and energy was circulated through it, problems would appear in unexpected places. Sometimes the problems would be small, but sometimes they would be big.

The small problems were no matter and would not cause any real trouble, but if big problems appeared, it could very well lead to the collapse of the entire array.

That was the case of the time before the last where a black hole appeared out of thin air in the Grand Hall that almost swallowed everything and everyone into it.

Fortunately, Yang Kai moved quickly and was able to suppress the black hole; otherwise, these Grandmasters might still be wandering the Void Crack to this day if they were unlucky.

So now, every time Yang Kai activated the array, the Grandmasters would all stand far away lest anything were to go wrong.

“This time will definitely work out!” Yang Kai said with certainty.

Several problems appeared the last few times, but they had all been fixed after the cause was identified, and Yang Kai had verified that there were no more issues this time. If it still did not succeed, then he would have cultivated the Dao of Space all these years in vain. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The recesses in each corner of the array were filled with crystals containing the powers of the Seven Elements. Each crystal was extremely precious and contained the condensed essence of many cultivation materials.

The Puppet Army that Xiang Shan deployed previously also made use of these energy crystals; however, each one of those puppets needed at most a fingernail-sized piece of crystal in order to power it for a long time. For this one transmission test, there were more than 100 crystal placed in the array.

It was because of this immense consumption that the Space Arrays in each of the Great Passes were not used casually.

Divine Sense surging, Yang Kai made one last check to ensure that he had missed nothing before circulating his World Force and connecting with the Grand Array beneath his feet.

The array hummed and a pattern was illuminated. The crystals placed in the recesses were also rapidly drained.

Under the nervous watch of the Array Masters, the Void began to distort at the centre of the array.

The bald Grandmaster raised his brow and cheered, “It’s working!”

Something like this had not happened in the previous few attempts, but the distortion of space now meant that the Space Array was functioning, a sign that it was going to succeed.

The Void twisted more and more, and as the energy drained away from the crystals, a Space Gate at the centre of the array seemed to be vaguely taking shape.

However, it always seemed to fall short, never really taking shape from start to end.

It seemed that the energy crystals were about to be depleted, and if it were to happen before the Space Gate fully formed, then this attempt would fail as well.

The Array Masters could not help but hold their breath.

However, even after waiting for a long time, the Space Gate continued to writhe unstably. Seeing that the energy crystals placed in the Grand Array were about to be completely depleted, Yang Kai suddenly stepped forward and reached out, grasping the constantly churning Space Gate that refused to take shape, and with some massaging, Space Principles rippled like dough being kneaded.

The well-respected Grandmasters were all dumbfounded by this scene.

What amazed them even more was the fact that Yang Kai’s seemingly reckless actions actually had an unexpected effect.

The Space Gate was actually stabilizing.

Immediately after, Yang Kai stepped through it, and at the same time, the energy of the array was fully consumed. The Space Gate turned into a fluorescent glow before disappearing.

Gone with it was also Yang Kai’s figure!

The Grandmasters were stunned.

The energy around the Grand Hall, which had been in disarray due to the activation of the array, had regained its peace. The Grandmasters all looked at each other, wondering, “So, was that a success or not?”

The fat Grandmaster was even more concerned about another matter, “Nothing will happen to Yang Boy, right?”

“Should we report this to the Army Commanders?”

…..

Discussions bounced back and forth as the Grandmasters were at a loss as to what to do, but very soon, they decided to go and report the matter. That was because they had no way of dealing with the current situation, so the only thing they could do was let the higher-ups take charge.

Soon after, Xiang Shan, Liu Zhi Ping, and the others rushed over, and after getting the rundown about what happened, they were also at a loss. Finally, they could only continue up the chain of command and report the matter to the Old Ancestor while waiting for any news from Yang Kai.

With his proficiency in the Dao of Space, he should be able to find his way back even if this attempt was a failure, not to mention that he was the one who took the initiative to step through the Space Gate. He might have his own ideas.

At the same time, Yang Kai was struggling to navigate through the Void.

He was a little confused as to why his previous attempt had gone awry. The repairs had already very much been perfected after going through a few mistakes, and the Space Gate should have opened successfully after the array was activated.

But in actual fact, something seemed to be interfering with it from inside the Void, preventing a stable connection from being established.

Even though the Space Gate did take shape with his help, if he did not find the root of the problem, then the soldiers would still not be able to use the Space Array to travel safely from one Great Pass to another in the future.

If Yang Kai wanted to figure out what was wrong though, he could only investigate it personally.

He was not worried about not being able to get back as he had left a trail of Space Principles along the way, so if he ran into a dead end, he could just return the way he came.

Ever since entering this stretch of Void, Yang Kai discovered that there really was a problem. An invisible force seemed to be preventing him from advancing, even with his mastery over the Dao of Space. Since it could hinder him, what more need be said about others? If they were to come here, then they would likely struggle to even take a step forward.

Yang Kai kept going, but could not find the cause, which made him even more confused.

However, this teleportation could not be considered a complete failure, because he could sense a link to the target of Great Evolution Pass’s Space Array ahead.

During this attempt, his destination was Wind and Cloud Pass, which was one of the closest Great Evolution Pass. If everything went well, then he would have been transported directly to Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array.

That was because the Space Gate would only form if the target ahead could be detected.

However, the path was full of obstructions, a sign of another failure, which was extremely contradictory.

Meanwhile, in the Grand Hall where Wind and Cloud Pass’ Space Array was located, several Army Commanders and Eighth-Order Division Commanders were gathered around, led by the Eastern Army’s Army Commander, Yuan Xing Ge, staring intently at the centre of the array.

There was a distorted Space Gate that had been writhing around for more than an hour now.

Every time a Great Pass transported materials or soldiers here, a Space Gate would always open at the centre of the array, but it always opened and closed quickly.

The situation today was unprecedented.

So, the soldiers standing guard here immediately reported the problem when they discovered it, and the top brass of Wind and Cloud Pass came to investigate without daring to dally.

Under the watch of the many Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, the Space Gate remained the whole time, but it never took a proper shape.

After waiting for a long time but seeing no other movements, Yuan Xing Ge turned his head around and asked, “Is it possible to see which Great Pass is trying to connect to us?”

One of the Eighth-Order Division Commanders who stepped forward shook his head, “There’s too much distortion, so we are unable to ascertain it.”

Yuan Xing Ge frowned slightly, “What will happen if the Space Gate never takes shape?”

The Eighth-Order Master said, “The worst-case scenario is that the teleportation fails, and whoever was being sent will fall into the Void Crack and stay there for the rest of their life.”

“Is there anything we can do here to help?” The Northern Army’s Army Commander Tian Lu asked, “Even though I have no idea why such a thing would happen, it’s clear that something has gone wrong during the teleportation on the other side. If there is anything we can do to help, then we should try to lend a hand.”

The Eighth-Order Master shook his head, “It’s difficult. Teleportation involves the Dao of Space, and there are no cultivators who cultivate this Dao in Wind and Cloud Pass. To intervene rashly would only make the situation worse, I’m afraid.” After a pause, he added, “In this situation, we can only hope that whoever is coming will be lucky.”

“Then, we shall just wait,” Yuan Xing Ge concluded.

Tian Lu came over and asked in a whisper, “Should we report this to the Old Ancestor?”

Yuan Xing Ge was silent for a moment before shaking his head, “No need. Even though the Old Ancestor’s cultivation is strong, he may not be a solution for this matter.”

It would be a shame for them to bring the Old Ancestor here if he were unable to provide a solution.

As they spoke, the warping Space Gate seemed to distort even more. Surprised, everyone quickly looked over.

In the next moment, a pair of hands suddenly emerged from the Void, spreading left and right as if to tear through a barrier. Following that, someone came out of the Space Gate and shouted, “I’m finally out!”

After saying that, he looked up to see many Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters staring at him. Thus, Yang Kai quickly saluted, “Greetings, Sirs!”
