A short while later, five more Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters arrived one after another to sit on both sides of the hall.

There were a total of ten Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Prison League. After Wu Nian was killed, only nine were left. It could be said that all the strongest Masters in Prison League were gathered here at this moment.

Hui Gu couldn’t help feeling apprehensive. It was his first time seeing such a large-scale force ever since he first joined Prison League. There had never been a time when all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in Prison League gathered together before.

There was only one thing that could make Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch summon all the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. It was obvious that Prison League was planning something very big.

Thus, Hui Gu sat in his seat and observed the situation. He soon discovered that most of the people present did not know why the League Master had summoned them. Divine Senses continuously fluctuated across the Grand Hall as everybody quietly communicated with each other. All of a sudden, somebody stood up and cupped his fist, “League Master, why did you summon us?”

Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch nodded at that person lightly and said, “Don’t be impatient. You will find out soon. Since everybody is here, then follow me.”

He stood up while speaking and walked down from his seat. The rest did not dare to neglect and quickly followed suit. When they came outside, they saw a huge group of Prison League members gathered, numbering at least 100. Moreover, every one of these people was a Fourth-Order Master or above. Everyone was waiting quietly in formation.

“Greetings, League Master!” As soon as Huang Quan appeared, they shouted at the top of their voices, seemingly shaking the sky as they roared. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Huang Quan nodded lightly and waved his large hand, “Let’s go!”

After a few moments, countless streams of light rose from Yellow Spring Cave and rushed towards a certain direction.

At this moment, almost all of the Prison League’s forces had been mobilised. Although some people remained behind, they were all below the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm. Their nest was practically empty. If any Masters were to raid them at this moment, Yellow Spring Cave would be razed to the ground in the blink of an eye.

Hui Gu was becoming more and more nervous with every passing moment. That was because the Prison League was heading towards the place where Yang Kai was lying in ambush! Unless something unexpected happened, they would encounter each other in a matter of moments.

Yang Kai might be powerful, but all the elites of the Prison League had been mobilised this time. From the League Master, Yellow Spring Heavenly Monarch, to the many Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters below him, it was impossible for Yang Kai to stop this raging torrent no matter how powerful he was.

It was foreseeable that Yang Kai would suffer a tragic ending once both parties encountered each other. At present, Hui Gu’s life was tied to Yang Kai’s, so if something were to happen to the latter, he would also have a hard time protecting himself.

[I need to get a message out!] The thought flashed through Hui Gu’s mind, but just as he was about to send a warning to Yang Kai, he noticed two people approaching him from left and right. He turned to the side only to see the two Prison League Vice League Masters. Firm Gold Heavenly Monarch and Blue Flame Heavenly Monarch drew close to him from both sides.

When their gazes met, Blue Flame Heavenly Monarch smiled at Hui Gu. On the other hand, Firm Gold Heavenly Monarch lightly commented, “Brother Hui Gu, you seem rather nervous.”

Hui Gu forced a smile, “You must be joking, Vice League Master. I’m just worried about Yellow Spring Cave. What is League Master planning to do? All the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters have been mobilised. If any strong enemies were to invade the Headquarters, the remaining members would be powerless to resist.”

Firm Gold Heavenly Monarch shook his head, “League Master knows what he is doing. Since he won’t explain, then it is not our place to ask. We only need to obey his orders.”

Hui Gu was astonished, “Even the Vice League Masters don’t know what League Master is planning?”

Jin Gang said, “Why don’t you go and ask, Brother Hui Gu?”

Hui Gu glanced at Huang Quan leading at the forefront and shook his head, “Forget it. Since League Master has a plan, it’s useless to ask.”

Firm Gold Heavenly Monarch chuckled and patted Hui Gu on the shoulders, “Relax. Yellow Spring Cave might be our Headquarters, but it’s nothing special. It doesn’t matter even if it were destroyed. Besides, the Prison Star is vast. As long as we remain, we can rebuild again anywhere.”

“You’re right, Vice League Master.” Hui Gu nodded.

They did not continue the conversation. Whilst travelling with Huang Quan in the lead, Hui Gu tried multiple times to escape Jin Gang and Cang Ya; however, his efforts were in vain. Those two stuck to his sides like glue and he felt his heart sinking into the abyss while the ominous feelings he had only grew stronger and stronger.

..…

In the mountain valley where the ambush was set up, Yang Kai and the others waited for approximately an hour. Sure enough, a Prison League patrol consisting of a team of twelve passed through the mountain valley right on schedule. It was perfectly in line with the information that Yang Kai received.

Pei Wen Xuan and Yin Xin Zhao were well-prepared, so as soon as the twelve man team stepped into the ambush range, they were struck by a sneak attack. The leader of this patrol was only in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so how could they stand up against two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters?

Yang Kai didn’t even need to do anything as the twelve men were quickly captured.

Zhuang Wei excitedly rushed forward with a longsword in his hand. Ignoring the bitter pleading and vicious cursing of those twelve people, he killed each one of them with a stab of his sword. Numerous black lights flew out from the wrists of those Prison League members to plunge into the golden wristband around his wrist, lighting up four stars in an instant.

“Hahaha!” He roared with laughter as the number of stars on his wrist had almost caught up with Yang Kai’s before this ambush. Now, he surpassed him!

He turned around to cup his fist and bow to Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan, “Many thanks, Senior Brothers!”

Yin Xin Zhao smiled and nodded. Then, he patted Zhuang Wei on the shoulder, “Don’t forget this Senior Brother when you marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven in the future!”

Zhuang Wei sincerely said, “This Junior Brother will never forget the kindness you showed me today, Senior Brother!”

Yang Kai was watching coldly from the side when all of a sudden, he turned his head to look in a certain direction. An exclamation of surprise escaped his lips.

“What’s wrong?” Pei Wen Xuan followed Yang Kai’s gaze, then his expression changed drastically, “This is bad! Let’s go!”

Along the horizon, a dense stream of lights was charging at them in an aggressive manner.

The strongest great force on the Prison Star was undoubtedly Prison League! Furthermore, the only organisation that could mobilise so many people at once was also the Prison League!

Yang Kai felt a twinge of fear in his heart. He had long planned to kill Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan with a borrowed knife, and to that end, he had been trying to figure out an opportunity to expose their whereabouts so that Prison League members could get rid of these two on his behalf. Contrary to his expectations though, Prison League took action before he could even implement his plan.

[How did Prison League learn of our whereabouts? Unless… Hui Gu spilled the secret? But Hui Gu is restricted by the Loyalty List, he wouldn’t do something that would dig himself into the grave like this unless he was prepared to lose his life. In that case, there is only one possibility! Hui Gu’s identity has been exposed! Prison League turned the tables on us!]

Yang Kai secretly sighed in amazement. Although this was somewhat different from what he originally planned, the end results weren’t too dissimilar. Be that as it may, Prison League’s League Master, Huang Quan, sure was cold and ruthless to use the lives of twelve people in a patrol as bait to lure them out.

All sorts of thoughts rolled around in Yang Kai’s head in an instant; then, he turned around and fled. To his surprise though, four figures suddenly appeared ahead of him, each one a Sixth-Order Master.

The person in the lead was dressed in a python robe, which gave him a menacing appearance. He lightly slapped his palm down over the crowd while saying, “Since you’re already here, you should stay!”

The overwhelming power of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master flooded out as the other three Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters attacked in unison.

Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan’s expressions changed drastically!

The four Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who appeared behind them displayed an extremely powerful and pure World Force, so it was obvious that many years had passed since these four broke through to their current realm. Newly-advanced cultivators like them were utterly incomparable.

Having advanced directly into the Sixth-Order, their starting point was generally higher than others, but even so, that advantage was not enough to make up for the difference formed from the accumulation of thousands of years. Hence, they were no match for any one of these four Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters in a one-on-one battle, much less if these four joined forces against them.

The two of them desperately used their Divine Abilities to break out of the encirclement, but unsurprisingly, they were blocked by the people who came.

*Shua shua shua…*

One after another, the sound of something slicing through the air rang out. They had missed the only chance they had to escape. Numerous figures landed in all directions, surrounding Yang Kai and the others tightly!

Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan both looked furious while Zhuang Wei shivered in fear. On the other hand, Mo Sheng looked contemplative as he quietly watched from the side.

...

Yin Xin Zhao and Pei Wen Xuan swept their Divine Senses out before they felt their hearts sinking into the abyss.

The people surrounding them were displaying their respective strengths without the slightest reservation, so it was easy to tell that there were nine Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters from Prison League gathered in this place. In addition, there were more than a hundred cultivators below the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm but above the Fourth-Order. Such a line-up could be said to be inescapable!

“Yang Kai, how dare you betray us!?” Yin Xin Zhao turned to glare at Yang Kai. In such a short time, countless possibilities had crossed his mind and the most likely one was that Yang Kai had betrayed them.

Yang Kai glared at Yin Xin Zhao coldly, “Idiot!”

While it was true that he had this plan in mind and had been making some quiet moves to accomplish it, the current situation was completely unrelated to him. The Prison League had dispatched so many Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, which went to show their determination. Even he was powerless against such a force. If he wanted to survive, then his only option was to escape.

It was just that he could not confirm whether Hui Gu’s identity had been compromised or not; otherwise, he would have escaped before this encirclement was formed. There were as many Prison League Masters as there were clouds in the sky at the moment, and Yang Kai was certainly not their opponent, but even the Prison League could not hope to stop him if he wanted to flee.

Yang Kai glanced surreptitiously at Hui Gu and immediately furrowed his brow at the sight. With his eyesight, how could he not realise that Hui Gu was being closely guarded by two Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters? Hui Gu didn’t have the slightest freedom at all!

[No wonder Hui Gu didn’t even send a single message even though the Prison League was carrying out such a large-scale operation. It was not that he didn’t want to but that he couldn’t. It looks like my guess is correct. Hui Gu’s identity has been exposed. The current situation is all part of Prison League’s retaliation.]

“Prison League’s Huang Quan greets little friends!” The man in the phyton robe blocking the path from behind gave a slight nod in greeting.

“So it is Brother Huang Quan, I have long admired you!” Yin Xin Zhao forced himself to remain calm on the surface even though his heart was pounding. [This guy is the Prison League’s League Master!]

Huang Quan smiled, “My reputation is nothing more than floating clouds. You are too polite, little friend.”

...

“You have certainly come from afar, Heavenly Monarch. How can I help you?” Yin Xin Zhao asked with a frown. They were currently stuck in a precarious situation where the slightest mishap could lead to their deaths. The criminals on the Prison Star were heinous and cruel after all, so they would not bat an eye at killing others. Yin Xin Zhao might be in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and boast great strength, but a newly-advanced Sixth-Order Master could barely make a ripple under the current circumstances.

“Little friends, you’ve killed so many people from my Prison League. As League Master, it’s only natural that I give the people under me a suitable explanation.” Huang Quan was cheerful and amicable, but the friendlier he appeared, the more terrifying he seemed.
