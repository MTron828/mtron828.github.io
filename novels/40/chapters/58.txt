Chapter 59 - The mining site

After leaving the bustling Black Wind Trade area, under Hu Mei Er’s guidance, the two people walked towards the north side of the Black Wind Forest. Hu Mei Er looked very happy and within her pair of charming eyes you could glimpse signs of happiness, she also had slightly flushed cheeks.

“That day’s affair, I am sorry!” Kai Yang suddenly apologised. His actions that day were really over the top and now that he had come to ask her for help, he felt a bit two faced.

Hu Mei Er pursed her lips before smiling: “It’s okay. Also, you didn’t curse me or anything. These few years, I have heard even worse words and I’m still living well aren’t I?”

“You don’t hate me?” Kai Yang asked astonished.

“What’s the use in hating you?” Hu Mei Er smiled and suddenly said: “Actually I hated you quite a bit but.........one of your actions made me unable to hate you.”

“What action?”

“He he, that day when Cheng Shao Feng and Niu Tao appeared, you went and stood in front of me. Perhaps that was a subconscious action, but these past few years, that was the first time someone sincerely and with all their heart wanted to protect me.”

“I don’t remember it, but you must have suffered quite a lot.” Kai Yang sighed. A perfectly good female, intentionally sullied their own reputation in order to find some talented disciples for the Blood Group. Although the methods were good, it still contained filial piety within.

“Ge ge.....” Hu Mei Er smiled: “It wasn’t too hard ah. Don’t you know that putting on a show or act is a women’s speciality. ”

“He he, I have never interacted with women.”

“Really?” Hu Mei Er’s eyes brightened.

“En, so these past few days I have been exhausted and toyed around with thoroughly by you two sisters.” Kai Yang said seriously.

A streak of anger flashed in Hu MeI Er’s eyes as she said: “What you said is too bad! Fortunately sister’s not here, otherwise you would be guaranteed a beating from her!”

“Your sister.....”

“True element first boundary!” Hu Mei Er said with some pride.

“Strong!” He praised.

Su Yan was at the true element third boundary, Hu Mei Er’s sister was slightly weaker than Su Yan, but nonetheless it wasn’t a big difference.

As soon as Hu Mei Er mentioned her sister, she thought about what Kai Yang had said again, causing her to throw her head back in laughter. During this flurry of actions she didn’t stop laughing.

Kai Yang remained silent and stood in place waiting for her to recover her breath.

After laughing for a good while, Hu Mei Er finally recovered her breath and turned to him with a big smile: “I see that you have great courage. There has never been a man who dared to speak to my older sister like that. Her that place......is it true that one is bigger than the other?”

“It could be because of the clothes she was wearing, so you can tell her later not to worry about it.” Kai Yang gently laughed.

“Then how about mine? Is it really well portioned?” Her face bashful, Hu Mei Er Er asked boldly.

“Not only are they well portioned, they stick out smoothly and are well rounded.” Kai Yang nodded his head, “You body figure is very good, so you have no need to sell yourself short.”

For a moment, Hu Mei Er thought it was a bit hard to bear. These frank and motiveless praises were the best words she had heard in a long time.

At that moment, she was secretly happy inside.

“How much longer will it take until we arrive?” Kai Yang didn’t want to continue discussing this topic, so he asked this question.

“There is still one hour’s worth of walking and although that place can be considered a part of Black Wind Forest, it is closer to the heart of the forest.” Hu Mei Er explained: “Over there, there is a vein that our Blood Group discovered a few years back. We sent over people to protect it and extract ores, the ores that are extracted from there are quite peculiar.”

“How are they peculiar?” Kai Yang asked.

“Over there, there are only stones of two attributes. One of them is the stone you had bought, the Bright Yang Stone while the other is the Bright Yin Stone. If you say it is peculiar, it is not but these two stones mutually suppress each other. So to find them appearing together is quite a mystery.”

“That is really strange.” Kai Yang’s interest was slightly piqued.

The Bright Yang Stone contained Yang attributed energy while the Bright Yin Stone contained Yin attributed energy, they were opposing attributes. Under normal circumstances, they definitely would not form together.

“Even the elders in the group feel that something isn’t right with the mining vein, but even after years of investigation, they have yet to find anything out of the ordinary. Though, from this mine we have earned no small amount of money.” Hu Mei Er didn’t seem to treat Kai Yang like an outsider and whatever she thought, she would say.

“This is your Blood Group’s good fortune!” Kai Yang chuckled.

Hu Mei Er replied with an en and then suddenly lapsed into a reign of silence before speaking again: “Actually it is such a coincidence that you wanted to find me today. If it was at a later date then you probably wouldn’t be able to find me. So it should be your good fortune.”

“Where are you going?” Kai Yang understood the underlying hint in her words.

“It’s not going somewhere.” Hu Mei Er shook her head and as she explained, she secretly observed Kai Yang’s expression: “After your words last time, I suddenly thought that my actions these past years weren’t correct. When utilizing those underhanded methods, the roped in talents don’t care about the Blood Group, but rather only me! And since I cannot provide them with what they really want, naturally they won’t try their best for the sect. That’s why I have decided to go into seclusion to train and become stronger so I can shoulder some of the burdens with my daddy; just like my sister!”

“The fact that you can think like this, is a good thing.” Kai Yang nodded his head in approval.

Not only was Hu Mei Er disappointed by his response she also saw that from the beginning till the end, Kai Yang’s face didn’t change much at all. Her words caused no fluctuations in his mood.

A bit pained and agonised, Hu Mei Er didn’t have mood to continue talking and only led the way at the front.

Since she didn’t speak, Kai Yang naturally wouldn’t go find something to talk to her about. After walking for another hour, the two people arrived at the mining site of the Blood Group.

It was positioned at the centre of Black Wind Forest. An area of roughly twenty li was the size of the Blood Group’s mining area. In the surrounding area, a few houses had been erected to allow the disciples to rest.

Because the ore vein was underground, when Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er arrived, they didn’t see many people and instead saw several large holes in the ground that lead underground.

Apart from the surrounding hundred feet or so, Kai Yang felt a weak reaction from his Origin of Yang in the center of his stomach area; a reaction to the underground Bright Yang Stones. Along with the growth of his strength the area in which he could sense Yang energy also grew larger, but it didn’t increase by much.

Seeing the two people entering the mining area, a Blood Group disciple took notice of them. Then an old man suddenly dropped down from the sky and landed in front of Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er. Cupping his hands he said: “Young lady!”

“Grandpa Long.” Hu Mei Er called out familiarly and pulled on Kai Yang to introduce him: “This is our sect’s vice head, grandfather Long, Long Zai Tian.”

Kai Yang hurriedly paid his respects: “This one meets the Long senior.”

Long Zai Tian looked at Kai Yang in contempt and didn’t pay any regard to him. With his immortal ascension boundary cultivation, and position as vice head of the Blood Group, was there any need to pay regard to Kai Yang’s little face?

Not to mention a youngster who relied on a woman! Long Zai Tian especially despised people like Kai Yang, and if it wasn’t for Hu Mei Er’s face, he would have long since slapped Kai Yang to death.

“Young lady, why did you come to the mining site?” Stroking his long white beard, Long Zai Tian kindly asked her, “It is both dirty and hot here so how is this someplace you can come to. Hurry and return, otherwise when your father learns of it, he will scold me.”

“It wouldn’t happen. Daddy wouldn’t have the guts to scold you because you are the third most powerful elder in the sect, in fact he only respects you.” Hu Mei Er used her ** spoilt child act, causing Long Zai Tian to become quite joyful.

“Grandpa Long, my friend here wants to purchase some things from some of the disciples here. Would you allow us to trouble you and enter to find them?” Hu Mei Er asked, arriving at her goal.
