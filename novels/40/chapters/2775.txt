“Good, good, good.” Old Lu smiled happily. If the matter was as Yang Kai had mentioned, he would not need to be in a rush to obtain the two sets of Five Elements Monster Cores he required. Instead, he could cultivate using the first set first, before obtaining the second set, piece by piece.

“We can go ahead with the exchange. However, this Old Master wishes for Elder Yang to supplement me with a million High-Rank Source Crystals. After all, there is still a large disparity between the value of these items and this Old Master’s price.”

This old fellow seemed simple and honest, yet had such a black heart! Yang Kai cursed silently, before replying with much thought at all, “Five hundred thousand.”

Old Lu turned silent for a while, appearing to be deliberating over this matter, before finally nodding his head, “Good.”

Yang Kai proceeded to send five hundred thousand High-Rank Source Crystals over before obtaining the Heavenly Music Treasure Box from Old Lu, which he shoved into his Space Ring.

“Junior Brother, you’re willing to spend so much for the temple even though you had just become an Elder! Senior Sister really has to thank you on behalf of the many disciples of our temple. When they cultivate in the future, they will definitely remember your benevolence,” Gao Xue Ting’s voice suddenly drilled into Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai’s face turned black upon hearing her words. Turning his head around, he noticed that Gao Xue Ting was focused on the stage, not appearing to be talking to him at all.

“This… Senior Sister Gao, this treasure box is mine…”

Turning her head over, Gao Xue Ting’s gaze turned chilly, “Hmm?”

Yang Kai immediately corrected his words, “It’s naturally not an issue if the temple’s disciples need it.”

Only now did Gao Xue Ting nod her head, “You’re too thoughtful, Junior Brother.”

Yang Kai let off a dry laugh, feeling as though his mouth had been stuffed with bitter medicine, with him pondering silently how to reach a compromise…

There were still quite a few treasures that graced the stage in the exchange meet, with many Emperor Realms taking turns to walk up and present the treasures they had kept for many years, whipping the audience into a frenzy time and time again. However, being in the territory of Azure Sun Temple, everyone still maintained order, keeping their manners when exchanges failed, with no one daring to incite any trouble.

Yang Kai took action a few times and obtained a few precious items, including an ancient pill recipe.

This continued all the way to the morning of the second day before the exchange meeting finally finished. Everyone then proceeded to stand up before the host, Qiu Ran represented the higher-ups of Azure Sun Temple and cordially invited everyone to remain as a guest. Nevertheless, no one really wanted to remain and everyone proceeded to say their goodbyes.

Not long after, the hundred or so Emperors brought along their descendants and disciples and departed.

“Junior Brother Yang, please come and visit this Old Master’s Spirit Jade Peak. It should be time for you to choose your residence,” Qiu Ran suddenly said.

Yang Kai nodded and replied, “Good. Please wait a moment, Senior Brother Qiu, as I still have a small matter to handle.”

After replying, he immediately rushed out of the palace, transforming into a streak of light as he flew away.

Qiu Ran frowned, before sighing, “He certainly is energetic… Ah, youth…”

He did not know what Yang Kai was running off to do, to the point that he had pushed an important matter like choosing his residence aside. From the looks of it, it seemed to be something urgent.

After an instant, Yang Kai suddenly appeared at a place three hundred kilometres away from Azure Sun Temple. Looking around, he immediately focused his sights on a certain location. Cupping his fists, he called out, “Sect Master Zhang, it has been a while.”

The void rippled before a whirlpool appeared. In the next instant, an ordinary-looking middle-aged man suddenly appeared from the centre. Stepping out, a sliver of a surprised look was present on his face as he replied, “What good eyesight you have, Elder Yang.”

He had concealed himself at that location and had put up his guard, yet he did not expect Yang Kai to see through his concealment with a single glance. Indeed, he really possessed the ability to back up his conferment as an Elder of Azure Sun Temple. The crucial point was that the latter was still young, which made Zhang Dao Shan feel as though he had aged past his prime.

“May I know what the matter is, for Elder Yang to ask this Zhang to meet at this place?”

Earlier, Zhang Da Shan was about to leave after the end of the exchange meet when he received Yang Kai’s transmission. Thus, he had waited specifically at this place. If not, he would already have headed back to his Sect.

If it was any other person, he would most likely not pay attention to such a brusque request; however, with Yang Kai’s status as an Elder of Azure Sun Temple, Zhang Da Shan had no choice but to treat the latter with high regard, leaving him no other option but to wait here.

Yang Kai chuckled, “My apologies if this offends you, Sect Master Zhang; I would like to request for an item from Sect Master Zhang.”

A frown appeared on Zhang Da Shan’s face as he immediately understood the situation, “The Supreme Divine Water?”

Earlier, when the previous owner of the Supreme Divine Water had taken it out during the exchange meet, Yang Kai had also made an offer, though the trade was not successful. In the end, the Supreme Divine Water ended up in Zhang Da Shan’s hands. There were no previous interactions between the two of them; therefore, if Yang Kai wanted to find him for any matter, the only possibility would be due to the Supreme Divine Water.

“Indeed,” Yang Kai nodded his head.

A guarded look immediately appeared on Zhang Da Shan’s face while he sent his Divine Sense to scan in all directions, appearing as though he was preparing to fight his way out of an ambush at any given moment.

Yang Kai immediately let out a dry laugh, “There’s no need to worry, Sect Master Zheng. This Yang has come here alone and is genuinely interested in trading with Sect Master Zhang for that Supreme Divine Water.”

Zhang Da Shan frowned as he replied, “If that is the case, I would really have to apologize. This Supreme Divine Water is very important to this Zhang, so I would have to disappoint Elder Yang.”

Yang Kai raised his hand and continued, “There’s no hurry to reject me, Sect Master Zhang. Would you allow me to guess your use for the Supreme Divine Water?”

Zhang Da Shan’s frown grew deeper, as he felt increasingly impatient towards Yang Kai’s obstruction. He had already rejected the latter’s request, so what more did Yang Kai want to say?

Yang Kai pretended to not see this as he continued, “The use of the Supreme Divine Water is without a doubt for the cultivation of Spirit Herbs, and is one of the greatest treasures an Alchemist can ask for. Sect Master Zhang should want the Supreme Divine Water for this reason, right?”

“That’s right,” Zhang Dao Shan nodded his head in agreement. This was not hard to guess, so it didn’t prove the latter’s brilliance at all.

Yang Kai smiled and continued, “However, from what I can see of Sect Master Zhang’s talented capabilities, you are lacking any kind of Fire Attribute Qi or traces of Spirit Medicines. Therefore, Sect Master Zhang should not be proficient in the Alchemic Dao.”

Zhang Da Shan shook his head, “The Martial Dao is broad and boundless. This Zhang does not have the patience nor the capability to explore the Alchemic Dao as well.”

Yang Kai revealed a calm expression and smiled faintly, “In other words, Sect Master Zhang is planning on gifting this Supreme Divine Water to another, right? Furthermore, it must be to an Alchemy Grandmaster that would let Sect Master Zhang gift such a precious treasure. From the looks of it, Sect Master Zhang seems to have some kind of request for the other party, most probably refining a specific pill?” Yang Kai paused for an instant before continuing, “Perhaps Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s Grandmaster Huang Fu?”

A look of surprise finally appeared on Zhang Da Shan’s face, “Elder Yang is even able to guess this?”

Yang Kai laughed and replied, “There are not many well-known Alchemists in the Southern Territory. Furthermore, only those few Emperor Alchemists are worthy enough for Sect Master Zhang to offer such a precious treasure like the Supreme Divine Water. There is no need to consider other Emperor Alchemists, however, as every one of them belongs to a great Sect and are extremely difficult to meet, much less request to concoct pills too. On the contrary, Violet Chamber of Commerce is focused on business, with Grandmaster Huang Fu frequently offering Alchemy services to the public. Generally speaking, only he would entertain requests for pill concoction.”

Having arrived at this point, Zhang Da Shan did not conceal any further as he nodded his head, “That’s right. This Supreme Divine Water is indeed a gift I’ve prepared for Grandmaster Huang Fu.”

Yang Kai replied, “Sect Master Zhang is planning on using this treasure to request Grandmaster Huang Fu to concoct a Spirit Pill for you?”

“Is there anything wrong about that?”

“Of course there isn’t anything wrong with that; however, with Grandmaster Huang Fu’s fame, there are innumerable people that are requesting for his Alchemy services, so who wouldn’t offer precious gifts to him? Although Sect Master Zhang’s Supreme Divine Water is very precious, you might not be able to gain any priority in the queue for his services. In fact, you might have to wait for a period of time even if Grandmaster Huang Fu accepts your gift.”

Zhang Da Shan frowned, “This Zhang naturally knows this; however, as long as Grandmaster Huang Fu accepts this gift, there should be results within three months. It is still better than those who have to wait bitterly for a few years.”

“Three months…” Yang Kai laughed, before raising a finger and saying, “What if I could let Sect Master Zang obtain the Spirit Pill he desires in one day?”

“What?” Zhang Da Shan’s entire being shook, “One day? Impossible!”

Doubt and suspicion immediately filled Zhang Da Shan’s expression. If Yang Kai had said those words to him yesterday, he would have snorted and scoffed in disdain; however, it was a different matter now. Right now, Yang Kai was an Elder of Azure Sun Temple. With such a golden signboard attached to his name, everything that Yang Kai said contained a certain level of credibility.

After hesitating for quite a while, Zhang Da Shan finally replied, “Which Emperor Alchemist does Elder Yang know?”

“Has Sect Master Zhang heard of the name Ji Ying?” Yang Kai asked back.

“Ji Ying…” Zhang Da Shan muttered as he fell into deep thought, but very quickly, his expression shook as light burst forth from his eyes, “Grandmaster Ji Ying? The Disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor?”

“Other than him, who else could it be?”

“You can’t be serious, right?” Zhang Da Shan was exceedingly shocked, “That Grandmaster is in the Northern Territory, and Elder Yang mentioned that within a day…”

Yang Kai interjected, “At this moment, Ji Ying is in Azure Sun Temple. I have a friendly relationship with him, so it isn’t a problem for me to request him to concoct a furnace of pills.”

Zhang Da Shan was instantly dumbstruck.

Requesting a furnace of pills from an Emperor Alchemist? Furthermore, from the Disciple of Wondrous Pill Great Emperor! How can a mere friendly relationship work like this? The point that made it extremely hard to believe was that Grandmaster Ji Ying was supposedly in Azure Sun Temple right now! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as Zhang Da Shan was lost in his confusion and tumultuous emotions, Yang Kai’s voice rang out once again, “Is Sect Master Zhang willing to gift that precious treasure and wait for three months or more to be able to obtain your desired Spirit Pills, or is Sect Master Zhang willing to try to obtain those Spirit Pills by tomorrow? However, truthfully speaking, even if Sect Master Zhang is able to request Grandmaster Huang Fu to perform Alchemy for you within three months’ time, I’m afraid that the fee for his work would be sky-high. However, if I use my connections, this fee can be waived.”

“Waiver of fees?” Zhang Da Shan’s eyes lit up.

When one requested an Emperor Alchemist to perform alchemy for them, not only would they need to prepare all of the required materials, they would also have to pay a rather high commission. If not, how would those Alchemists become filthy rich?

“Only this time!” Yang Kai replied with a straight face.

Zhang Da Shan immediately sensed something from Yang Kai’s reply as his face lit up with excitement, “Then the next time, this Zhang can also…”

“You naturally have to pay appropriate remuneration next time,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Zhang Da Shan was simply ecstatic. If he was able to form a connection with Grandmaster Ji Ying through this, he would no longer need to be at the beck and call of other people and wait bitterly when he needed pills in the future. As for commission fees, that was something that he was naturally willing to pay.

Seeing the change in his expression, Yang Kai struck again while the iron was still hot, “To tell you the truth, Sect Master Zhang, I need that Supreme Divine Water as well as I was planning to give some to Grandmaster Ji Ying. Set a price, Sect Master Zhang, and I’ll pay it.”

“There’s no need for that,” Being a decisive person, Zhang Da Shan had already made up his mind, and thus did not plan on hesitating further. After some organizing, he tossed a Space Ring to Yang Kai, “The Supreme Divine Water and the alchemy materials are inside. I’ll have to trouble Elder Yang then.”

Yang Kai extended his hand out to grab it. Sweeping the contents with his Divine Sense, he smiled faintly and replied, “Just wait here for a day, Sect Master Zhang, and I will come find you tomorrow.”

“Many thanks!”
