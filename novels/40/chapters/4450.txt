While the Elders from the Cave Heavens and Paradises were having a discussion, the younger generation were not standing idly by. Instead, they were exchanging pointers. Presently, there were one man and one woman who were engaging in an intense battle. As their Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm auras clashed, they flew around the place.

The people from the Cave Heavens and Paradises rarely had such a chance to gather together; therefore, using the Dao Theory Assembly as a chance, the Elders brought their favourite Disciples to this place. It wasn’t that they wanted them to take part in the assembly as they wouldn’t have the heart to let the Disciples they had high hopes for get married into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.

Nevertheless, they could make use of this chance to let the younger Disciples familiarise themselves with one another and increase their experience.

As the people in the gazebo watched the fight, some of them would make a remark from time to time. They looked like they were having a chat with the people around them, but they were actually commenting on the strengths and weaknesses of the ones in the battle.

Although there was only a difference of one Order between them, the gap between the Mid-Rank and the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm was no different from the distance between the Heavens and Earth. As Inner Elders, they were perfectly qualified to point out the weaknesses of these youths.

The man and the woman in battle continuously adjusted the ways they made a move as they listened to the Elders comment, gaining some valuable knowledge along the way.

Just then, an old man with a rosy face said, “Good, the battle should stop here. Both of you must be exhausted, so get some rest now.”

Upon hearing that, the man and the woman leaped away and saluted one another. Then, they put away their artifacts and sat down with their legs crossed.

Just then, a grim-looking old man with an aquiline nose in the gazebo turned to look at Xu Ling Gong and asked in a hoarse voice, “Why are you in the mood to keep us company today, Brother Xu?”

Xu Ling Gong was responsible for handling all the affairs in the Dao Theory Assembly. Supposedly, he had to keep these Elders company; however, since the day they arrived, Xu Ling Gong had only shown up once on the first day and let them stay in their respective residences after. He had practically ignored them since then.

In fact, they fully understood how Xu Ling Gong felt. He was resentful of them. After all, they had used a dirty trick to make sure that only Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would take part in the Dao Theory Assembly, which meant that only a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master would eventually marry Qu Hua Shang.

They reckoned that Xu Ling Gong had been pretty restrained for not outright attacking them, so it was understandable that he ignored them most of the time.

However, he had come to visit them on this day with a jovial expression, as though something great had happened to him.

“What do you mean? While it is true I was too swamped with work and didn’t have the time to keep you company, I do now,” Xu Ling Gong replied nonchalantly, “Since all of you have come all the way here, I’ll have to make time for you even though I’m busy.”

They naturally wouldn’t believe him. This guy previously showed no trace of politeness when glaring at them since they arrived. However, they couldn’t figure out why he was in a jubilant mood on this day.

Just then, someone approached them from afar. After saluting all of them, he walked up to the grim-looking old man and whispered something to him.

The grim-looking old man’s expression changed as he shot a meaningful glance at Xu Ling Gong, soon understanding what had happened.

Then, he gently waved his hand to motion for the person to withdraw and stared at Xu Ling Gong before commenting, “An ingenious move indeed, Brother Xu. This Zhuo is impressed.”

With the wine cup in his hand, Xu Ling Gong looked smilingly at him, “What are you talking about, Brother Zhuo? I don’t understand.”

“It’s fine. I know what you’ve done,” the old man surnamed Zhuo sneered and rose from the chair, “I’ll take my leave.”

Seeing that, Pei Wen Xuan, who was seated among the younger disciples, hurriedly got up and left with him.

As they walked down the mountain, Pei Wen Xuan cautiously followed the old man surnamed Zhuo. He instinctively had a feeling that the other party was in a terrible mood, but he had no idea what had happened.

“There’s been a change in the Dao Theory Assembly, Wen Xuan,” the old man surnamed Zhuo suddenly said.

Pei Wen Xuan became startled for a moment, then asked, “Master Zhuo, you mean…”

This old man was none other than Zhuo Bu Qun, an Elder from Myriad Demons Heaven. In the past, Ti Zheng was responsible for handling all external affairs; however, after his death in the Shattered Heaven, Zhuo Bu Qun took over his duties and subordinates.

“A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master has appeared in the Dao Theory Assembly,” Zhuo Bu Qun replied.

“A Sixth-Order? We all agreed that only Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters would join the assembly. Who broke the rule?” Pei Wen Xuan asked with a frown.

“He’s not from one of the Cave Heavens and Paradises. You know him as well actually.”

“Who is it?”

“The Lord of Void Land, Yang Kai!”

Pei Wen Xuan was startled for a moment, then knitted his brows together, “Are you mistaken, Master Zhuo? I’m aware that Yang Kai is in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven because he moved past the Territory Gate we had cordoned off; however, he’s supposed to be in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, not the Sixth-Order.”

“The eldest son of Kong Feng, Kong Tian Yu, ascended to the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm several hundred years ago. His power was considered quite good among those in the same Order. Nevertheless, he was killed by Yang Kai in one move.”

Pei Wen Xuan’s pupils contracted when he heard that.

Although he hadn’t been in any contact with Kong Tian Yu before, he had heard about him. Just like Zhuo Bu Qun had said, that guy was a powerful Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who achieved his ascension several hundred years ago.

Nonetheless, he was killed by Yang Kai with only one move. Pei Wen Xuan wouldn’t doubt Zhuo Bu Qun. Since the older man had said so, the information must have been verified.

Seeing as Yang Kai was able to kill Kong Tian Yu easily, he had to be in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm.

Pei Wen Xuan was dumbfounded to learn that Yang Kai was in the Sixth-Order, which was the same as him as according to the information the Cave Heavens and Paradises had gathered, Yang Kai had only made it to the Fifth-Order outside the Shadowless Cave Heaven.

Suppressing the doubt in his mind, Pei Wen Xuan asked, “Master Zhuo, you mean…”

He knew that Zhuo Bu Qun wouldn’t have said such a thing for no reason. He was definitely required to do something.

“According to the original plan, all of us only had to respectively send one Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly; however, with this turn of events, things have changed. What’s more, the problem occurred at the Territory Gate we were responsible for. Since we’re at fault, we have to give an explanation to the others. I want you to participate in the assembly and become the winner,” Zhuo Bu Qun ordered impassively.

That was the reason he immediately left the gazebo upon hearing the news.

The news would be spread among the other great forces soon and if he hadn’t left, he would’ve been criticized by the others. After all, the problem was with the Territory Gate that Myriad Demons Heaven had guarded.

Upon hearing that, Pei Wen Xuan replied, “I can definitely become the winner. But, Master Zhuo, I’ll have to marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven by doing so.” Despite knowing that Yang Kai was also in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, he was still confident of defeating the other party since he was a disciple from a Cave Heaven.

The disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises were not afraid of anyone in the same Order.

“You’re a Core Disciple of Myriad Demons Heaven, so we won’t let you marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Don’t worry, I’ll handle the issue.”

Pei Wen Xuan nodded his head, “I’ll do as you say, Master Zhuo.”

After giving it a thought, Zhuo Bu Qun said, “You must not be complacent. Although you’ve refined Sixth-Order Elements and eventually ascended to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai condensed several Seventh-Order Elements before. Moreover, he’s able to use a Divine Manifestation; therefore, you can’t regard him like any other Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. It will probably be difficult for you to deal with him.”

Pei Wen Xuan replied, “Don’t worry, Master Zhuo. I will not be negligent.”

“Very good. The assembly is just a few days away. Get some rest and make sure that you’re prepared.”

“Yes.”

...

In the gazebo on the Spirit Peak, Xu Ling Gong was humming a tune as he was in a jovial mood. He watched as the cultivators from the Cave Heavens and Paradises came over and reported to their respective Elders in small voices one by one.

The Elders initially had no idea why Zhuo Bu Qun had left all of a sudden, but upon hearing the reports from their subordinates, they finally realised what had happened.

A Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master had suddenly shown up in the Dao Theory Assembly. Although there was only one person, it had derailed all of their plans and arrangements, forcing them to change their tactics.

The Elders subsequently left, all of them shooting resentful glances at Xu Ling Gong before that. It was never a good feeling to be stabbed in the back.

Xu Ling Gong on the other hand only became more jubilant. After all of them were gone, he couldn’t help but start guffawing.

Meanwhile, there were only a small number of people in a certain palace of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven where Open Heaven Realm Masters had to make a registration to take part in the Dao Theory Assembly.

Those who were supposed to make a registration had already done so, and since the assembly was just a few days away, it was basically too late for those who hadn’t managed to do so already to sign up. The disciples responsible for registering the Open Heaven Realm Masters were thus lazing about somewhat sleepily.

Although there were several hundred people already registered, there was only one Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. The outcome of the Dao Theory Assembly wouldn’t be surprising since there was a stark difference between those in different Orders.

However, they were just ordinary disciples, so it had nothing to do with them.

When two disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, who were bored behind the registration desk, saw a figure appearing all of a sudden in front of them, they were astonished. Looking up, they could instantly recognise that the person was a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master who was the Outer Elder of Myriad Demons Heaven.

Previously, this person had brought a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from the same Sect to make a registration, so the two disciples could recognise him.

...

One of the disciples from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven rose from the chair and asked, “So, it is Elder He. Why have you come here all of a sudden?”

Elder He’s expression was so cold that it was as though a layer of frost could be scraped off his face. He had nowhere to vent out his fury, which almost burned him alive.

He was the elderly man who had previously stopped Qing Kui and Yang Kai just outside the Territory Gate.

Since Yang Kai had managed to enter Yin-Yang Cave Heaven under his watch, he had to take full responsibility for it. As such, he had just been harshly reprimanded by Zhuo Bu Qun, which was why he was in a foul mood.

“I’m here to make a registration!” He said in a sulky voice.

“What?” The disciple who spoke earlier was startled. When he looked behind Elder He, he saw no one there. Puzzled, he asked, “Are you doing it for yourself or…”

Elder He roared, “You want this Old Master to marry into Yin-Yang Cave Heaven!? Of course I’m making a registration for someone else!”

The two disciples were stunned as they had no idea why Elder He was so incensed. Still, they hurriedly straightened up and helped him with the registration, “Please tell me the person’s name, cultivation, and Master Sect.”

Elder He replied in a grim voice, “Pei Wen Xuan, Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, Myriad Demons Heaven!”

The two disciples were startled as they looked up at him. One of them asked hesitantly, “Are you sure you want to make a registration for Senior Brother Pei?”

They had heard about Pei Wen Xuan. He was a rising star in Myriad Demons Heaven who directly ascended to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm. There was no doubt that he had a bright future.
