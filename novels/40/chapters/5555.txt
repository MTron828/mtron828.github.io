Chapter 5556: Method of Escape


 

The Black Ink Clan Army was taken aback. When Mo Na Ye ordered them to eliminate the Human Race Masters rushing out of the Universe Cave Heaven, they obeyed the order without question. Unfortunately, they had failed to stop the wave of Humans. It wasn’t until they heard Yang Kai’s shout that the Feudal Lords discovered the shocking truth. Mo Na Ye and the others were gone!

[Have the Territory Lords really escaped!?]

In the beginning, some of the Black Ink Clansmen refused to believe the truth and continued to confront the Human Race Masters bravely; however, there was no movement from the Territory Lords even though the fight had been ongoing for some time.

In the end, they had no choice but to face reality. The Territory Lords had fled! The morale of the Black Ink Clan Army instantly dropped like a stone, and their tight formation rapidly collapsed.

Even though the strength of the Black Ink Clansmen varied greatly, they held an overwhelming advantage in terms of numbers. If they were determined to put up a fight, they could cause huge casualties among the small number of Humans. Dawning Light and the two Bi Xi Battleships might come out unscathed, but not many among the 1,000 or so Hunters would survive such a battle.

Having said that, the Territory Lords had escaped, so without their pillars, how could the Black Ink Clan Army retain their fighting spirit? The siege fell into tatters after several clashes with the numerous Human Race Masters. That was especially true for the places where Yang Kai and Feng Ying passed through. Wherever Yang Kai and Feng Ying went, swathes of Black Ink Clansmen were cut down like ripe wheat in a field.

Dragon Roars and Phoenix Cries sliced through the air, immediately followed by the emergence of Tai Yue. As thousands of lives disappeared with each breath, the Black Ink Clan Army was filled with absolute terror.

The Black Ink Clansmen in the outermost circle began to retreat. The Territory Lords had already escaped, so were they supposed to hang around and wait for their deaths? Their choice quickly affected the Black Ink Clansmen in the inner circles. Hence, more and more Black Ink Clansmen began to break away from the battle and flee into the distance.

At this moment, the Black Ink Clan Army was a Dragon without a head, so it didn’t take long before the 1 million strong Army became completely vulnerable and fell apart like a handful of loose sand.

There were several Feudal Lords who tried to rally their companions to stand and fight without retreating. They undoubtedly had a clearer picture of the situation, so they knew that they had a chance of survival if they banded together and fought back desperately. On the contrary, they would not stand the slightest chance if they panicked and all escaped in random directions. Without any exceptions, these Feudal Lords would quickly be cut down by Yang Kai.

Yang Kai navigated his way through the Black Ink Clan Army as though there was nobody in his path, heading in the direction where the resistance was fiercest. It was difficult even for him to eliminate such a massive Black Ink Clan Army, and since that was the case, his focus was to force them to retreat.

As time passed, more and more of the Black Ink Clan Army fled the battlefield. When the number of escaped Black Ink Clansmen reached a critical point, the fighting spirit of the Black Ink Clan Army collapsed completely. The three Warships and the Hunters pounced on this opportunity, causing heavy casualties to the Black Ink Clan everywhere they went.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“A hard-pressed enemy should not be pursued too far!” Yang Kai shouted, preventing the Hunters from chasing the enemy into the distance.

Upon hearing his command, everybody quickly ceased their pursuit. Countless Black Ink Clansmen quickly fled in all directions, vanishing into the depths of the void and disappearing out of sight.

The battle ended on an anticlimactic note. After the battle, countless Black Ink Clan remains littered the battlefield. Just a rough estimate indicated that there were at least 300,000 fresh corpses. That number was nothing compared to the Black Ink Clan Army of 1.5 million that was transferred here, 20% of it at most, but the battle had not lasted for very long either. The entire process took no more than an hour from the beginning to the end.

300,000 enemies had been slaughtered in an hour, which was a staggering victory.

Likewise, there were casualties among the Human Race Masters. Many Hunters had lost their lives, and those who survived were covered in wounds. Nevertheless, these casualties could not be avoided to achieve this kind of result.

It was impossible to suffer zero casualties in such a battle, but nobody mourned too much. Ever since choosing to become Hunters, these people had disregarded their concerns over life or death. Nobody knew when they would encounter an accident, so they had long since become indifferent to such matters.

For the first time, the Hunters discovered that large-scale army battles were much more enjoyable than their previous small-scale raids. The main reason they chose to become Hunters was that they could not adapt to the way the Army fought in war. Cultivators generally believed in their own strength rather than the support of others.

However, it might not be unacceptable if all the Army fought in this manner. For a time, many Hunters entertained different ideas in their hearts.

“Keep a lookout in all directions,” Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief and issued the command before he slipped back into the Universe Cave Heaven again.

Due to the destruction of the portal, the Human Race Masters inside the Universe Cave Heaven could vaguely see the battle taking place outside. It was just that they did not have a very clear view of the situation. The battle had erupted without warning and then ended so quickly that many people could not tell who had won and who had lost. It was not until Yang Kai’s figure appeared again that everybody finally breathed a sigh of relief.

“Sir!” Li Zi Yu came forward to greet Yang Kai, “The situation outside…”

“The Territory Lords have escaped, and the Black Ink Clan Army has been repelled,” Yang Kai briefly explained. The 10,000 Human refugees inside the Universe Cave Heaven immediately burst into cheers, causing the entire World to resonate with joy.

“Can we leave this place now?” Li Zi Yu asked emotionally.

Several dozen years had passed since they were tasked with the responsibility of evacuating the Humans in Acacia Territory and became trapped in this Universe Cave Heaven. It was extremely dull to remain cooped up inside this Universe Cave Heaven. When the Black Ink Clan besieged them after they accidentally exposed their whereabouts, they believed that they would die soon. Who could have known that Human Masters would be dispatched to rescue them?

At this moment, the Black Ink Clan Army standing guard outside had been repelled, so there was nobody to stop them from leaving the Universe Cave Heaven.

Yang Kai nodded lightly. In the next moment, he opened the portal to his Small Universe, “Everybody, please enter my Small Universe!”

Not many among the 10,000 refugees were in the Open Heaven Realm, so it was not difficult for Yang Kai to take them in.

Many Black Ink Clansmen were slaughtered during the previous battle in the Universe Cave Heaven, and Black Ink Strength flooded the World as a result. Although Feng Ying and the others had distributed Purifying Black Ink Pills to the crowd, the weaker Humans here would not be able to resist the Black Ink Strength for long. Therefore, they did not hesitate to rush into the portal of Yang Kai’s Small Universe upon hearing his command.

An hour later, all 10,000 refugees in the Universe Cave Heaven had been taken into Yang Kai’s Small Universe.

“You too!” Yang Kai turned to Li Zi Yu and the others.

“Us, too?” Li Zi Yu was astonished.

He was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Not to mention, he was not the only Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in this place. Although they could enter Yang Kai’s Small Universe… Could Yang Kai really accommodate so many cultivators at once?

Despite feeling suspicious, he did not dare to question Yang Kai’s orders further, so he immediately told the others, “Move.”

The crowd of Open Heaven Realm Masters quickly plunged into the portal. Since Yang Kai wanted them to enter his Small Universe, then he must be confident in his ability.

Li Zi Yu was the last to enter, but before he did, he secretly peeked at Yang Kai’s complexion. Yang Kai was very pale, but that was more likely a result of the injuries he sustained in his previous battle than any strain on his Small Universe.

Hence, Li Zi Yu was secretly astonished, [How large must Sir Yang’s Small Universe be!?]

After accepting all of the Human Race Masters in the Universe Cave Heaven, Yang Kai darted out.

Outside the Universe Cave Heaven, the rest of the Human Race Masters were watching their surroundings under Feng Ying’s command. It was just that none of the Black Ink Clan came attacking. They had only just been forced to retreat, so who would dare to return?

When Yang Kai appeared without anybody else behind him, Feng Ying immediately understood the situation. Those Humans inside had probably been taken into his Small Universe, so she simply asked, “Squad Leader, do we fight our way out?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “All five Territory Gates are guarded by Black Ink Clan Armies, and we don’t know where the three Territory Lords who escaped might be. It’s too risky to charge out of Acacia Territory.”

The reason they managed to defeat the Black Ink Clan Army earlier was pure luck as the three Territory Lords had escaped first. If the scenario unfolded for a second time, they might not be so lucky again. As long as the three Territory Lords were not fools, there was a great chance that they could stop their advance if they joined forces and cooperated with a large Black Ink Clan Army.

“What should we do?”

“I have an idea,” Yang Kai replied, “How many people can you accommodate in your Small Universe if they are in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm and below?”

Feng Ying considered for a moment before she responded, “I’ve never tried, but 200 is probably my limit with Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters as a standard.”

If she took in those in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, then she might only be able to accommodate 20 or 30 at most; after all, the higher their Order, the larger the size of their Small Universe, and the heavier the burden to hold them became.

“Do your best to take in as many as you can. I will deal with the rest,” Yang Kai instructed.

Feng Ying nodded.

Yang Kai swept a glance across his surroundings and spoke in a loud voice, “Everybody, it is true that we won this battle; however, the Territory Gates in Acacia Territory are guarded by large Black Ink Clan Armies. The whereabouts of the Territory Lords also remain unknown, so it will be extremely difficult for us to safely leave Acacia Territory. While I have a method to escape this place safely, I will require your full cooperation.”

His speech was mainly aimed at the Hunters since he was not familiar with them. Furthermore, these Hunters were not part of the Army, so his orders held no weight with them. Discussion and compromise were the only options here.

One of the Hunters shouted, “Sir, please feel free to ask anything of us, we will not refuse.”

Having witnessed Yang Kai’s strength and heroics, these Hunters could be said to hold great admiration for him. Now that the Territory Gates in Acacia Territory had been blockaded, they could only rely upon him if they wanted to leave, so how could they dare to be disrespectful?

Yang Kai nodded, “I would like to ask you to enter my and Senior Sister Feng’s Small Universes!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, he shot a glance at Feng Ying. The two of them opened the portals to their Small Universe in unison.

Ordinary people might not be able to notice any kind of difference; however, for these Masters, as soon as the two portals appeared side by side, the difference in strength between the two Small Universes could be seen at a glance.

The aura radiating from Yang Kai’s Small Universe was undoubtedly more substantial. Even the impression given by the two portals was distinctly contrasting. If the portal to Feng Ying’s Small Universe was akin to a wooden door, then the portal to Yang Kai’s Small Universe was a huge steel gate. There was no comparison between the two at all.

“Those in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and below will enter Senior Sister Feng’s Small Universe first. Those in the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm will come to my side,” Yang Kai continued.

Many of the Hunters rushed over without hesitation and plunged straight into the two portals.

Not long afterwards, Feng Ying’s expression began to twist in discomfort. She persisted for a while longer, but eventually closed her portal with a shake of her head when her aura fluctuations became unsteady, “I can’t take any more.”

Her Small Universe had reached its limits, so it was impossible for her to accommodate any more Open Heaven Realm Masters.

On the other hand, the opened portal to Yang Kai’s Small Universe resembled a bottomless pit that accepted every single person who came forward. Even so, it could be seen that he too was starting to feel the pressure after accommodating so many cultivators in his Small Universe.

When all the Hunters had entered his Small Universe, he turned to look at Yang Xiao and the others, “You too.”

Yang Xiao worriedly said, “Adoptive Father, will you be okay? We don’t need to enter…”

“Enough nonsense, get inside,” Yang Kai snapped irritably. [Do you really think I can’t see through your little schemes?]

These little ones were clearly looking for an opportunity to escape his watch so that they could continue wandering outside; however, the situation here was too dangerous. How could they be so careless? If he had not come to Acacia Territory himself, they would have been in mortal danger by now.

Seeing Yang Kai being so insistent, Yang Xiao and the others had no choice but to obey; thus, they dejectedly took turns entering the portal.
