“I’ve taught you how to cultivate and passed on my Secret Arts to you, but I’ve never taught you how to use a spear,” Yang Kai explained, “There are 3,000 Grand Daos in the world. While Xiao Bai is talented in the Dao of Space, your comprehension of the Spear Dao is unrivalled. Both the Dao of Space and Spear Dao are my Daos!”

Zhao Ya finally understood everything. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“In comparison, your aptitude is much better than Xiao Bai’s. If I hadn’t suppressed your cultivation over the years, you would’ve moved beyond the Immortal Ascension Boundary a long time ago.”

A puzzled Zhao Ya asked, “Master, I’ve never understood why you’ve been suppressing my cultivation. Can you tell me now?”

After giving it a thought, Yang Kai said, “I don’t mind explaining it to you, but it will take a very long time. You’ll find out about it when the time is right.”

Zhao Ya nodded and said in a gentle voice, “What about Green Mountain Town? Did you deliberately tell Aunty Lu and Grandma that you came from that place so that I’d look for you there? After all, you brought me out of that place before.”

Yang Kai fell silent.

There had always been a hint of ruthlessness in her since Zhao Ya was a young child. This was evident in her reaction when she was forced to become Yang Kai’s Disciple, and it became even more conspicuous as she grew up. Yang Kai initially wanted to make use of this life experience trip to let her find her biological parents in the hope that the knots in her heart would be solved.

However, his goal was not achieved in the end.

“Master, you were the one who named me. I’ll always be Zhao Ya, and I have nothing to do with the Xu Family. I’ll not be resentful of them for what they’ve done to me; after all, Aunty Mei took good care of me during that period of time. We’re even now.”

Yang Kai nodded.

“However, there’s one thing I don’t understand. Please enlighten me, Master.” Zhao Ya looked seriously at him.

“Go ahead.”

“You could’ve kept hiding your identity, and it’s clearly not the right time to expose it, so why did you show your true appearance after Big Brother Ye Bai and I came back from the adventure?”

“That’s because I won’t have time to pay attention to you two in the near future,” Yang Kai explained.

Zhao Ya frowned in puzzlement.

“Above the Emperor Realm is the Open Heaven Realm. To reach that Realm, a cultivator must gather the powers of Yin, Yang, and the Five Elements before splitting Heaven and Earth apart in their body to form a Small Universe. I’m an Open Heaven Realm Master, and the world you live in is my Small Universe!”

Zhao Ya was instantly astonished. The vast world they were living in was actually just her Master’s Small Universe. She still couldn’t believe it as the notion was beyond her ability to comprehend.

“My true body is now trapped in a kind of shattered space, and I’ve been trying to comprehend its secrets over the years in an attempt to escape. I’ve finally gotten some clues, so I must focus on that now. Therefore, I won’t have time to deal with the matters in my Small Universe.”

Zhao Ya nodded blankly.

“When I’m not around, you and Xiao Bai have to work hard and not be complacent. I hope that you’ll show significant improvements when I see you again in the future.”

“Yes!” Zhao Ya and Zhao Ye Bai nodded their heads at the same time.

Yang Kai waved his hand again, whereupon two petite figures with wings behind their backs appeared as they danced in the air.

Zhao Ya and Zhao Ye Bai were instantly amazed as they gazed at the figures that were the size of a palm.

Mu Zhu and Mu Lu flashed amicable smiles at the pair. This couldn’t be helped. While Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya didn’t know these petite beings, Mu Zhu and Mu Lu were very familiar with them. In the past, when Yu Lu was having difficulty giving birth, they were the ones who used a Secret Technique to stabilise her vitality and so they had been there to witness Zhao Ye Bai’s birth. Over the years, they had been observing the two children’s development. It was just that Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya had never seen them before.

“These two are members of the Wood Spirit Clan and are also the earliest residents of my Small Universe. Even before then they accompanied me for years. After I’m gone, you can ask them about cultivation or anything else.”

Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya nodded at the same time.

Yang Kai gazed at Mu Zhu and Mu Lu, “Please take care of them.”

The Wood Spirits replied with a smile, “Don’t worry, Master.”

With a nod, Yang Kai disappeared.

In the hall, both parties glanced at one another for a moment before Zhao Ya pulled Zhao Ye Bai’s clothes and said respectfully, “Junior Zhao Ya greets two Seniors.”

Mu Zhu smiled helplessly when she heard that. It had been a long time since she was born, but it was the first time she had ever been called a Senior. On the other hand, Mu Lu felt that she had taken up a heavy responsibility as she stuck out her chest and pretended to be a senior expert.

However, when she took a glance at Mu Zhu’s towering mountains and remembered her own vast plains, she instantly became dejected.

“Are there any questions you want to ask?” Mu Zhu said with a smile.

Zhao Ye Bai immediately spurted out, “Does Master really have several Wives?”

Zhao Ya looked smilingly at him, “What’s wrong, Big Brother Ye Bai? Do you want to learn from Master?”

Zhao Ye Bai quickly scratched his head, “I’m just curious.”

…..

Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya were now in their early twenties, and the flow of time in Yang Kai’s Small Universe was twice as fast as in the outside world. In other words, Yang Kai had been trapped in the shattered space for another ten years.

To an Open Heaven Realm Master, ten or so years wasn’t long at all; hence, Yang Kai , Xia Lin Lang, and Cheng Yang, who had chased after them to this place, were all doing just fine.

The three of them were in different parts of the shattered space while searching for a way out; however, both Xia Lin Lang and Cheng Yang knew nothing about the Dao of Space, so even though they were stronger than Yang Kai, they were powerless to do anything in this situation.

On the other hand, after years of study, Yang Kai had finally gotten some clues about this space. That was the reason he decided to expose his identity to Zhao Ye Bai and Zhao Ya at this point.

For the next six months, Space Principles never stopped undulating around Yang Kai. His expression kept changing as it alternated between frowning and elation.

Suddenly, one day, he opened his eyes as a glint flashed across their depths.

His movement shocked Xia Lin Lang and Cheng Yang as they turned and paid close attention to him.

Under their watch, Yang Kai took a step forward and disappeared. They quickly looked around, but the man was nowhere in sight. No one knew where he was headed.

A large part of the Void was shattered by an ancient Great Expert using a Space Secret Technique. Like a broken mirror, the space fragments here were like those shattered pieces. There was no order to speak of here as everything was in complete chaos.

Both Xia Lin Lang and Cheng Yang could already feel the strangeness of this space when they previously barged into it; therefore, they were not surprised that Yang Kai had gone missing as they were certain that he was randomly transferred to some distant space fragment.

However, Cheng Yang ‘s pupils contracted the next moment.

That was because a figure suddenly appeared beside Xia Lin Lang. It was none other than the previously missing Yang Kai.

A pleasantly surprised Xia Lin Lang asked, “Have you figured it out?”

If that wasn’t the case, Yang Kai couldn’t have coincidentally appeared beside her. The two of them and Cheng Yang had given it many tries before, and were always randomly transferred around the space fragments. They had no idea where they would appear next after leaving a particular space fragment.

However, the fact that Yang Kai could accurately appear beside Xia Lin Lang proved that only mastery in the Dao of Space could solve the mysteries of this shattered space.

“I haven’t figured it out entirely, but I have discovered some patterns.” Yang Kai shook his head; after all, the space fragments were originally a single whole. Although it was now shattered, there must be a faint connection between the space fragments. Only experts in the Dao of Space could clearly see such connections though.

“Do you have the confidence to get us out of here?” Xia Lin Lang asked.

Yang Kai replied, “It’s not hard to find a way out, but what comes after that will be difficult to handle.”

Xia Lin Lang suddenly recalled that there were countless Divine Abilities that just waiting for them outside of this space. Before they arrived at this place, they had experienced a lot of hardship and almost lost their lives. At that time, Bright Sun Divine Monarch was behind them to clean up the mess. If he hadn’t blocked most of the Divine Abilities, they wouldn’t have stood a chance to survive.

It could be said that Cheng Yang had actually done them a favour.

With that said, they were forced to sneak into this place as Cheng Yang was chasing them.

Yang Kai suddenly turned to look at Cheng Yang and spoke to him using a Secret Technique, “Divine Monarch, given the situation we’re in, cooperation will benefit both sides while disagreement would do no one any good. Why don’t we put down our grudges and work together?”

Cheng Yang snorted and stared at him with a pair of piercing eyes, “Aren’t you worried that I’ll harm you?”

Yang Kai replied, “The reason you’ve been hunting me down is that you’re after one of the Four Universe Pillars, the World Spring. However, I’ve refined the World Spring and it is now a part of my Small Universe. Even if you kill me, you might not be able to get it. The World Spring will most likely fall apart alongside my Small Universe. So even if I work with you, I don’t have to worry about my safety for the time being. Without you, Senior Sister Xia and I might not be able to get out of here, and it’s the same case for you. Without me leading the way, you’ll never be able to leave this place despite being an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master.”

Cheng Yang stared coldly at him for a long time before putting on a grin, “Since you’ve made things so clear, what else can I say? If you aren’t worried that I’ll stab you in the back after we get out of here, why would I be bothered?”

A moment later, he asked with a smile, “Do you want me to make an oath or something?”

“If oaths were useful, what would be the point of cultivating? Even if you really made an oath, I wouldn’t believe it.”

Cheng Yang arched his brow, “You’re pretty reasonable, Brat. Because of what you’ve said, I can assure you that I won’t kill you before you ascend to the Seventh-Order.”

“Many thanks for your kindness then, Divine Monarch.” Yang Kai put on a faint smile.

To the side, Xia Lin Lang appeared worried. She knew that if they brought Cheng Yang out of this place, the other party would definitely stab them in the back; however, if they didn’t make use of his power, she and Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to leave this place alive.

It was understandable that Yang Kai had made such a decision in the face of this predicament. Regardless, they had to get out of here first.

“I’ll go over there now, Divine Monarch,” Yang Kai said, then turned to Xia Lin Lang, “Don’t circulate your strength, no matter what.”

Xia Lin Lang nodded, “Got it.”

As Space Principles undulated, Yang Kai led her to take a step forward and disappeared from the space fragment.
