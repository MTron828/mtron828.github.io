In front of the Divine Bird, the power of The Void fluctuated wildly before collapsing inwards into a single point. A moment later, this collapsed space exploded outwards, crushing a large region of the Severed World’s Void.

However, after exploding, this Void Crack did not disappear and instead was replaced by a massive rotating vortex that was translucent, like a cloudy piece of glass.

Through this vortex, one could vaguely see what was on the opposite scene.

There, a figure was turning its head and looking around, seemingly a bit dazed. Naturally, it was Yang Kai.

The Divine Bird saw him and let out a fierce cry as it flapped its wings and dove into the vortex without hesitation, its figure appearing on the other side a moment later.

When the Divine Bird left the Severed World, the monstrous aura it was radiating also disappeared.

The Origin Kings who had fled before also appeared one after another, gathering not far from the vortex and staring at the situation on the other side with strange expressions.

Over there, Yang Kai was clearly being chased by the Divine Bird, fleeing madly as his figure rapidly drifted away.

And the space he and the Divine Bird were now in seemed quite familiar.

“The Star Field?” Ni Guang raised his brow, recognizing this area as the place where he and the other masters had entered the Severed World before.

“How is this possible?” Gui Zu was also at a loss and could not figure out what had happened.

Not far away, Zi Long’s expression changed as he seemed to be contemplating something, but he swiftly made a decision, silently wrapped Zi Dong in his Saint Qi and diving towards the vortex.

Xu Wei, who was under Zi Dong’s control, quickly kept up.

After these three rushed into the vortex and appeared on the other side, they chased after Yang Kai stealthily. Obviously, Zi Long was unwilling to simply let this matter drop, but that was expected as the Immortal Tree was currently in Yang Kai’s hands. As long as he could catch up with Yang Kai, there was still a chance he could snatch the Immortal Tree from him.

“Uncle Ni, let’s go too,” Xue Yue said in a hurry.

Ni Guang nodded, “It looks like the Star Field is really on the other side of this vortex, and it’s not dangerous to pass through. There aren’t many benefits left in this place anyways, so... En. let’s go!”

Saying so, he turned to look at Gui Zu again, “Friend, do you plan to...”

Gui Zu snorted, “My Sect Master is being pursued! This old master certainly cannot just stand by and do nothing!”

“Understood, then this Ni will accompany you.”

The two reached a consensus quickly and rushed towards the vortex.

The remaining Kong Fa thought for a while before also hurriedly following.

As Ni Guang had said, there were not many benefits left in this place, so there was not anything to gain by remaining, only dangers. However, if they were lucky, chasing Yang Kai might yield some benefits.

A moment later, everyone had disappeared.

Soon after, a figure appeared sneakily and swept its eyes around. It was none other than Meng Tong who had left early.

It was impossible to know where he had been hiding but having detected that the situation had become calm again, he had decided to show up.

*Xiu xiu...*

A whooshing sound soon filled the air and grew louder, clearly indicating that someone or something was approaching.

“There’s still someone here?” Meng Tong was taken aback for a moment and turned towards the direction the sound was coming from. A moment later, a beautiful figure appeared in his field of vision.

After seeing this person’s appearance, Meng Tong smiled lightly nodded in greeting.

“Huh, Brother Meng?” The visitor recognized Meng Tong and called out.

“Elder Luo!” Meng Tong greeted, also recognizing this individual. It was none other than Luo Lan of Sword Union. Although the pair were not familiar with each other, they had at least met a few times before. Meng Tong was like this, having neither deep hatred nor friendship with other Origin Kings, always insisting on acting alone.

“What happened here? This Mistress was in the distance just now and thought she saw the Divine Bird,” Luo Lan asked curiously. She had seen the Divine Bird leave its nest, but at that time she was quite a distance away, so by the time she arrived here, everything had been settled so she was at a loss about what had transpired.

“It’s a long story.” Meng Tong gave a wry smile, “But now, there is a chance to leave this place, so would Elder Luo like to exit first?”

Luo Lan was taken aback, looked at the vortex thoughtfully, and lightly opened her lips to ask, “Leave through this vortex?”

“Yes. Everyone else has left already. Only you and I remain in this Severed World, and this Meng was planning to leave just now,” Meng Tong nodded.

“Everyone left?” Luo Lan was surprised, but after thinking about it, she nodded, “In that case, this Mistress will leave with you.”

“Is that so,” Meng Tong smiled lightly before taking the lead and diving into the vortex.

After he and Luo Lan left the Severed World and returned to Star Field, Meng Tong briefly explained to her what had happened before.

When she learned that the Immortal Tree had ultimately fallen into Yang Kai’s hands, Luo Lan was shocked!

After all, there were so many masters present, with three powerful Second-Order Origin Kings, but the one who won the prize turned out to be Yang Kai, an Origin Realm junior. It was truly an unexpected outcome.

Luo Lan could not help feeling that Yang Kai’s luck was too good.

However, the Divine Bird obviously would not give up easily and had actually chased Yang Kai out of the Severed World and into the Star Field. At this moment, Yang Kai’s situation was likely extremely perilous.

“Yeah, and that’s what happened,” After Meng Tong finished speaking, he went silent.

Luo Lan looked into the distance with some worry, uncertain if Yang Kai could escape this disaster. Her impression of Yang Kai was quite good, and she knew that Gu Jian Xin wanted to make friends with him, so she didn’t want anything bad to happen to him.

But now, the scope of this situation had exceeded the boundary she could interfere in, leaving Luo Lan with a deep feeling of powerlessness.

“Elder Luo, this Meng will take his leave here. May we meet again in the future!” Meng Tong was a cautious individual, so although the Immortal Tree held great attraction to him, he did not think his luck was Heaven-defying enough to snatch it, so he didn’t plan on wading into the muddy waters. After exiting the Severed World, he had decided to return to his secluded home immediately.

His gains from this trip were not small, so after entering retreat for some time, if he was fortunate enough, even if he couldn’t break through, his strength would certainly increase noticeably.

“Many thanks for dispelling my doubts, Brother Meng. Have a safe journey!” Luo Lan gently nodded.

“Farewell!” Meng Tong cupped his fists, turned around, and flew off.

After Meng Tong left, Luo Lan could not help sighing but did not attempt to pursue Yang Kai, instead adjusting her bearings and flying off in the direction of Azure Tree Star.

At the same time, Yang Kai was fleeing wildly through the Star Field!

Behind him, the Seven Coloured Radiant Peacock pursued as swiftly as the wind, depressing him greatly.

He did not know exactly how strong the Divine Bird was or what realm it was equivalent to, but judging from how it was doggedly pursuing him, Yang Kai was certain it wasn’t weaker than a Third-Order Origin King.

Because even if he used the Space Secret Technique and was moving extremely fast, he still could not escape its pursuit.

With each beat of its wings, the Divine Bird would instantly cross dozens of kilometres.

Yang Kai almost spat blood in depression.

The Divine Bird seemed consumed with hatred on the level of him killing its father or taking its wife, following behind him relentlessly. The distance between the two sometimes widened and sometimes narrowed, with no signs of the situation changing for the better.

What frightened Yang Kai the most was when the Divine Bird occasionally spat out blasts of Seven Coloured Radiant Light. When that happened, he had to focus all his attention on dodging as he did not dare allow himself to be contaminated.

This kind of fleeing through the Star Field from a powerful being brought back memories for Yang Kai...

When Yang Kai escaped from Green Mountains Star, Luo Hai had chased him like this, following him for an entire half a year until Yang Kai arrived on Scarlet Wave Star. After hiding in the Sealed World Bead, Luo Hai completely lost his trail.

Now, the Divine Bird was doing the same thing again, but it was undoubtedly much stronger than Luo Hai. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

If it were not for Yang Kai’s accomplishments in the Dao of Space increasing dramatically during this time, he would definitely be doomed.

After mobilizing his Space Force repeatedly and avoiding the Seven Coloured Radiant Light again and again, the situation became even more dangerous.

After a countless number of its attacks had failed, the Divine Bird seemed to become incensed.

No longer spitting its beams of light towards Yang Kai, the Divine Bird concentrated its power onto one of its feathers and shot it towards its fleeing prey.

This attack was extremely difficult to dodge or defend against.

Yang Kai had been in a state of crisis for some time now.

Of the twenty Blood Beasts he had managed to condense in the Severed World, several had already been destroyed in order to protect him from danger.

Each Blood Beast represented a Golden Blood Thread, so each destroyed Blood Beast meant a destroyed Golden Blood Thread.

Yang Kai’s heart felt like it was bleeding.

*Xiu...*

A splitting sound suddenly rang out from behind, causing Yang Kai’s complexion to change dramatically, but just as he was about to evade as usual, Yang Kai realized that the Divine Bird’s attack this time was a bit different, not only faster but also stronger.

Not daring to be negligent, Yang Kai turned around in a hurry and thrust out his hands.

The space in front of him was disturbed by his Space Force and a large circular Void Crack was suddenly opened.

As soon as this Void Crack took shape, a streak of light impacted it.

With a bang, Yang Kai’s heart clenched as he saw the circular Void Crack he just opened shatter and a fierce attack pierced towards his chest.

Pain assaulted Yang Kai as he felt his body was about to explode as he felt something penetrate straight through his chest, causing a blowout of his Golden Blood in the process.

He had suffered a heavy blow this time causing his aura to deflate significantly.

Under the huge inertia, his body was sent flying like a sack.

As he was tumbling, Yang Kai looked down and after seeing his injury clearly, a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Sure enough, something had penetrated through his chest, but fortunately, it had missed his heart, piercing through the right side of his body instead.

This kind of injury was not fatal, but it was quite serious, even for Yang Kai.

*Chi chi...*

A sound that caused Yang Kai to tremble rang out next, and when he looked up, he saw the Seven Coloured Radiant Peacock closing in on him with several feathers floating around it.

These feathers were the Divine Bird’s true feathers and each possessed some of its Blood Essence. Under normal circumstances, the Divine Bird would only use its feathers as a last resort.

This only proved how strong the Divine Bird’s determination to kill Yang Kai was.
