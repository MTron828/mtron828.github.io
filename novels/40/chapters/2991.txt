Sweeping their Divine Sense across their surroundings and finding no hidden traps, Spirit Arrays, or Masters waiting to ambush them, the Emperors finally felt a sense of relief wash over them. However, the way the girl stood with her back to them annoyed them greatly. They felt as if they were being looked down upon and the thought left them feeling very uneasy.

A red-faced old man sighed, ‚ÄúLittle girl, why did you go and provoke Wind and Cloud Pavilion? You brought this upon yourself. Although I don‚Äôt condone bullying the weak, the reward is too generous to pass up. It is impossible not to be swayed by such benefits. Heed my advice, you should surrender without a fight; otherwise, you might get hurt if a fight breaks out. That won‚Äôt be good for you.‚Äù

His tone was as earnest as could be; however, his eyes were shifting about suspiciously as he spoke. He was clearly up to no good. The rest of the group were silent, but even so, each of them was secretly circulating their Emperor Qi, preparing for a fight at a moment‚Äôs notice.

The old man continued, ‚ÄúLittle girl, you don‚Äôt have a chance of winning. As you know, resistance will only cause you more harm than good. It‚Äôs not easy for somebody as young as you to reach this realm! Unfortunately, you don‚Äôt know how to hide your claws! I‚Äôm willing to be a peacemaker and accompany you to Wind and Cloud Pavilion to apologize and resolve this grievance. What do you think?‚Äù

As soon as the words left his mouth, the girl chuckled, ‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt trying to covertly use a Secret Technique on me, I might have actually believed you‚Äôre not a bad man. It‚Äôs a pity that your methods are too crude. What my Master said was right; the people outside are cunning and dishonest. It really is hateful.‚Äù

After saying that, she suddenly lifted a finger into the air and swiped horizontally. Her actions were accompanied by a soft tearing sound as if something was being cut open. A cloud of brilliance burst out in the air and in response, that red-faced old man shuddered. His complexion paled greatly, obviously suffering from the backlash of his Secret Technique being forcefully broken.

Therefore, he was both shocked and horrified. He did not expect a petite little girl to be able to break his Secret Technique with such ease. Gaining a deeper understanding of her strength, he instantly became fearful of her.

At the same time, a figure appeared without any warning about ten metres away from the girl. That person had secretly hidden next to the girl at some point in time. Before this moment, not a single trace of their presence had been revealed and they took advantage of the moment she broke the Secret Technique to attack. It was the moment when her guard was at its lowest and his timing could not be more perfect. Enveloped in powerful Emperor Qi, this man raised his hand and threw a large net-like artifact over her. The large net sparkled in a brilliant multi-coloured glow and one could tell that it was a high-grade Emperor Rank Artifact at a glance, one specifically meant for capturing people.

The large net opened so widely that it seemed as though it could encase the entire world in it, enclosing the space around the girl firmly and securely. Then, the person who launched the surprise attack laughed heartily, ‚ÄúHahahaha! Let‚Äôs see where you can escape now!‚Äù

The girl‚Äôs strength was exceptional, but she obviously had little combat experience. When this change occurred, she frowned and tried to retreat. Unexpectedly, the large net followed her closely like maggots on rotting bones and she couldn‚Äôt get away from it no matter what she did. Furthermore, the large net was shrinking rapidly to capture her within it.

She would not be able to escape if she were to be caught by this Emperor Artifact, regardless of how powerful she was. After all, there were many Emperor Realm Masters gathered here and if they all attacked at once, she would surely be overwhelmed by their numbers.

The moment she turned around though, Yang Kai stared at her in a daze. He stared blankly at the somewhat familiar yet unfamiliar face but could not associate her with the person he knew in any way.

[Is this her? Or, not?] He wasn‚Äôt certain anymore.

At that moment, the Emperor Realm Master that threw the net formed a series of hand seals and shouted, ‚ÄúSeal!‚Äù

In response, the large net shrank abruptly and completely encased the girl inside it. A panicked expression surfaced on her face, and although she wanted to escape, the space surrounding her had been sealed inside the net. Then, a trace of determination flashed through her beautiful eyes.

At that moment, a strange force suddenly enveloped her, and by the time the large net fully closed around her, they discovered that she had escaped through some unfathomable means. The owner of the large net was astonished and looked bewildered and incapable of comprehending what had just happened.

‚ÄúMaster said that if a person hits me once, I should hit them back twice. If you can take two hits from me and survive, I will let you go.‚Äù The girl seemed a little angry after being ambushed just now and her beautiful face furrowed in rage. Still, a beauty would always be a beauty and even her angry face was gorgeous.

As she spoke, her tender body shifted slightly and she lunged towards that person with a pair of small fists that were glowing with a bright light. Then, she threw a punch at him from more than ten metres away.

That person was still wondering why his Emperor Artifact had failed to capture the girl; however, he immediately became furious when he heard what she said, ‚ÄúThose are some cocky words, little girl! You‚Äôre far too arrogant! I don‚Äôt know who your Master is, but he must not be that great of a person to raise a disciple like you. Two hits? Even if it‚Äôs a hundred‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly noticed that something was wrong. When the girl threw her punch, the entire world seemed to freeze in that moment. He himself had the illusion that a vast mountain was pressing down on him and he physically felt a huge weight on his chest, making it hard to even breathe. Moreover, all the blood in his body felt like it had frozen in his veins.

*Hong‚Ä¶*

A loud sound rang out, followed by the sound of bones breaking as that Emperor Realm Master flew backwards and smashed into the ground like a meteor. He even coughed up blood mid-air as his complexion became bloodless in an instant.

*Pa‚Ä¶*

He crashed into the ground, creating a huge crater, and at the same time, cracks spread out in all directions like the world itself was breaking apart.

The sound of many shocked gasps could be heard; everyone widened their eyes in surprise as they stared at the delicate and weak-looking girl in a daze. None of them had expected such an ordinary-looking punch to carry such power. The visual impact gave them an incredibly unreal feeling, so much so that they couldn‚Äôt help wondering if they were dreaming.

Even Yang Kai was dumbfounded. He was fairly certain at this point that this girl was not the person he knew as, although she was a First-Order Emperor, the strength she unleashed was horrifying. Contrarily, the person he knew would not be able to achieve this level of strength.

‚ÄúTake my second fist!‚Äù The girl flew up above the crater and threw another punch downward as she shouted.

This time around, everybody was mentally prepared and stared fixedly at this attack, all of them becoming aware that this was no simple punch. There were no traces of any kind of Secret Technique being used, but even so, this small fist caused the crater to expand by more than ten times. The Earth trembled from the force of her blow while the First-Order Emperor Realm Master that had crashed into the pit uttered a muffled groan before he stopped moving.

Many Divine Senses swept over and following that, their expressions were filled with shock. That man was dead! He actually died! He was killed in two punches by a delicate-looking little girl!

Inside the crater, that man had died a terrible death, to the point where his remains barely even looked human anymore.

‚ÄúW-W-Who is your Master?!‚Äù The red-faced old man asked in surprise. Even an idiot could tell that something was amiss by now. The girl‚Äôs strength was too shocking, not something an ordinary person could achieve. The Disciple was already so strong, so surely the Master would be even more powerful than her. It was very likely that she had some kind of supreme existence backing her.

After thinking about it from this perspective, everybody looked at the girl again and seemed to see a giant illusory shadow standing behind her.

At that moment, all of them felt rather distressed. They were afraid that they might have provoked an existence that they should not have and that there was a reason why she dared to kill the Young Pavilion Master of Wind and Cloud Pavilion.

Although Wind and Cloud Pavilion was fairly influential, several great forces in the Western Territory could rival it in strength. Not to mention there was still the elusive Shadow Killer Palace standing above them all.

‚ÄúWhy do you care about who my Master is? You secretly tried to trick me just now! I‚Äôm going to hit you twice too!‚Äù After getting rid of her first opponent, the little girl fixed her gaze on the red-faced old man and raised her small fists.

The old man was extremely shocked in response. He might have been strong, but he wouldn‚Äôt dare to claim he was stronger than the man just now. If that man failed to receive two blows from this girl, then he wouldn‚Äôt be able to survive them either.

From an uninvolved party‚Äôs perspective, the girl‚Äôs slightly reddened fists looked quite attractive; however, in the old man‚Äôs eyes, they looked like deadly weapons that were about to slaughter him. Panicking, he shouted, ‚ÄúThis girl is strong! We need to attack her together!‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle girl, you are beautiful indeed! Let me give you some love!‚Äù A furious roar rang out as a burly figure lunged towards the girl.

Everybody else felt astonished in response to that burly figure‚Äôs actions and thought to themselves. [Great! People who are not afraid of death really exist!]

They had learned their lesson after the spectacle from before and were planning to withdraw. Source Crystals were attractive, but one needed their life to be able to enjoy them. Even though the possibility of winning against the little girl was very high if all of them worked together to bring her down, they knew that everyone had their own reservations. Hence, it would only give the girl an opportunity to break through their ranks if they really attacked with such a fragile alliance. That would only result in more injuries and casualties on their side.

For somebody to rush forward at this time would undoubtedly cause some changes to the situation though. Therefore, everybody turned to watch how things would unfold. Upon seeing the person‚Äôs appearance and cultivation, however, many were shocked.

‚ÄúXiong Kai Shan!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is great! With him taking the lead, we might have a chance of winning!‚Äù

One by one, the Emperor Realm Masters that were about to retreat stood their ground to watch the situation unfold.

On the other side, Xiong Kai Shan appeared in front of the girl, his Emperor Qi surging greatly as his fists that were as large as plates flew out. Every punch he threw could crush mountains and split seas. The air filled with afterimages of his punches at that moment, and thanks to his brawny figure, his attacks covered a wide range, making him look extremely fierce.

In the face of this violent storm of fists, the girl pursed her red lips and retaliated blow for blow without saying a word. Following several loud booming sounds, the pair exchanged hundreds of blows in a matter of breaths.

All of a sudden, Xiong Kai Shan pulled back from the fight, his expression filled with shock as both his arms trembled uncontrollably.

Everybody was dumbstruck by the sight. Xiong Kai Shan‚Äôs fists were covered in blood while on the contrary, the girl was safe and sound. Even though her enemy had retreated, she did not take advantage of the situation to pursue him further and just glared at the other party angrily.

‚ÄúHow is she this strong?!‚Äù Xiong Kai Shan lowered his head to look at his fists in disbelief; however, the reality was laid out before his eyes and did not allow any room for doubt. As a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, he actually lost to a little girl in a direct exchange of fists! That fact made him feel extremely humiliated and he roared to activate his Secret Technique. At that moment, the necklace of skulls hanging around his neck snapped and flew out. Those white skulls danced about in the air and transformed into gigantic skulls with gloomy ghost fires burning in their eye sockets as they slammed towards the girl.
