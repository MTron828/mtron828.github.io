Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Yang Kai’s reaction was very fast, almost simultaneously attacking the moment Shan Qing Luo used her Beguiling Technique.

Even Shan Qing Luo was secretly surprised that he could free himself from her technique so quickly; without mentioning him only possessing a True Element Boundary Fourth Stage cultivation, even an Immortal Ascension master could not free themselves from her skill so easily.

[What exactly is this scoundrel’s background?]

The Asura Sword shot out from within the black gas, like a snake striking from its hole, and stabbed towards Guo Yuan Ming’s neck.

Guo Yuan Ming’s confused and empty eyes suddenly released a cold light as a disdainful grin appeared on his face. Yang Kai’s face instantly sank, and he quickly shifted from attacking to defense and poured all his Qi into his guard.

*Ding...* Yang Kai tumbled backwards, and eventually landed beside Shan Qing Luo. The hand holding his Asura Sword trembled slightly, and his blood flow was in chaos. Breathing heavily, he tried to steady himself.

“Ha ha ha!” Guo Yuan Ming laughed scornfully with an obscene look plastered all over his arrogant face. Licking his lips as he unscrupulously stared at Shan Qing Luo, he mockingly said, “Demon Queen’s beguiling fantasy technique deserves its reputation, it is truly extraordinary!”

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful face was filled with an icy cold. Apparently Guo Yuan Ming had long ago been prepared.

“If Lady Demon Queen was at full strength, naturally I would not be able to resist your technique, but now... heh heh!” Guo Yuan Ming crudely laughed, as he cried out, “Brothers! Lady Demon Queen doesn’t seem to be feeling too well, she should be easy prey! Make sure you don’t use too much strength, we don’t want to ruin her body before we get a taste!”

“Brother Guo, rest assured, we’ll be sure to be gentle!” Yuan Shi stepped forward slowly, and obscenely stared at Shan Qing Luo. All traces of fear were gone from his face.

“Heh heh heh ...” A burst of wicked laughter rang out. Everyone here had been somewhat uneasy at first, but now seeing how easily they could withstand Shan Meng Luo’s Beguiling Technique, their courage suddenly surged.

Shan Qing Luo was extremely furious, but she maintained an elegant and aloof look and softly quipped, “Do you trashes really think you can take on this Queen so easily?”

Seeing her calm demeanor, without the slightest trace of panic, Guo Yuan Ming’s heart jumped as he involuntarily hesitated.

But after a moment, he grit his teeth and cursed, “Brothers, now that the arrow has left the bow there is no turning back, since we have already offended this cheap whore if she manages to escape you all know what fate awaits us!”

Given Shan Qing Luo’s personality and methods, if she really escaped from them now, even if they all hid at the ends of the earth they would still not be safe.

Knowing how seriousness things had become, these men gripped their fists and nodded heavily.

“Since it has come to this. We only have one choice left! If we’re able to taste the world’s most seductive woman, what need is there to fear death?” Guo Yuan Ming voice suddenly became cold, “Brother Ban, your strength is the lowest, you deal with that little shit over there. As soon as you’re done come assist us!”

A tall lanky man looked over towards Yang Kai, disdainfully laughing, “No problem!”

Shan Qing Luo on the other hand, while maintaining an indifferent smile, had secretly been gathering her True Qi. Suddenly waving her hands forward as she cried out, “Since you dare offend this Queen, you can all go to hell!”

A crystal like white silk thread suddenly filled the sky, shrouding the opposite party.

These six or seven were all Immortal Ascension Boundary masters, but their cultivation was not too high, most of them only reaching the Second Stage, only Guo Yuan Ming had broken through to the Third Stage.

Facing Shan Qing Luo’s sudden attack, all of them hastily circulated their Secret Arts and summoned their artifacts to defend themselves.

Yang Kai also thrust forward his hand and condensed nearly a thousand Sword Qi blades around him. As these blades stabbed forward, Yang Kai simultaneously summoned the thousand petal blades of the Thousand Blossoming Blood Begonia.

With the appearance of this slaughtering artifact, the surrounding space instantly became a sea of blood red petals!

With his opponents all being Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators, Yang Kai did not plan to hold back.

Such a dense and rapid attack sent the enemy party’s resistance into confusion.

Shan Qing Luo quickly formed a series of hand seals, which manipulated the crystal silk threads to dart and weave, which instantly wrapped up two of the Immortal Ascension Boundary First Stage cultivators.

These two were the weakest members of the enemy group, and facing this surprise attack, they soon found themselves bound tightly by layers of silk thread.

Yang Kai quickly seized this opportunity to launch his White Tiger and Divine Ox Seals and summoned the two crimson Monster Beast phantoms. With an Earth shaking roar, the two phantoms bared their fangs and charged towards the two trapped individuals and ferociously mauled them.

The thousand red petals also shot forth in concert, each piece as sharp as any high quality artifact blade. A short burst of extremely shrill screams rang out, which caused Guo Yuan Ming and his companions to cringe as the sound reached their ears.

*Pu pu pu...*

Blood splattered everywhere!

A surprised light also flashed across Shan Qing Luo eyes. She had not thought that Yang Kai’s attack would have such power. The series of fierce attacks was not something an ordinary True Element Boundary Fourth Stage cultivator could display.

Gripping her fist, her silk threads viciously contracted and instantly dismembered the two already black and blue Immortal Ascension Boundary First Stage cultivators.

Within the span of a few breaths, two Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators had been brutally killed.

As this happened, another burst of white threads shot out from around Shan Qing Luo’s tender body and wrapped up the remaining enemies.

Her image flashing, she appeared beside Yang Kai, grabbed his arm with her delicate hand and shouted, “Run!”

Yang Kai quickly waved his hand, recalling the thousands petals into his body and activated his Movement Skill and escaped together with Shan Qing Luo.

This devilish woman could now only use strength equivalent to a True Element Boundary Third Stage cultivator. Working together with him to kill two Immortal Ascension First Stage cultivators was already the limit of what she could handle. Although the conflict only lasted an instant, the amount of True Qi she had consumed was certainly not small. If they stayed behind, they would certainly suffer.

“Cheap slut!” Guo Yuan Ming’s angry voice rang out from behind them. He had not thought that Shan Qing Luo would only be able to launch a single attack. It was only after she had left that he realized that she had never actually planned to fight it out with them.

After a few tens of breaths, Guo Yuan Ming and his companions finally managed to break free from their silk bindings. One after another, they stared somewhat fearfully in the direction Shan Qing Luo had disappeared. In the end, a Devil King was still a Devil King, and even if they were seriously injured, they were not so easy to deal with.

“What should we do now?” Yuan Shi asked gloomily.

Guo Yuan Ming ground his teeth in hatred, “If you don’t want to live the rest of your life fleeing from her, we can only catch up and kill her!”

“Brother Guo is right!” The others quickly nodded in agreement.

No longer hesitating, they hurriedly began the pursuit.

When Shan Qing Luo had first grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, she had wanted to drag him along with her as they escaped, but she quickly realized the speed of this little rascal was actually not much slower than her own. Every time his feet moved, he cast some kind of strange Movement Skill that seemed to instantly propel him forward several tens of meters.

Running at full speed, her proud peaks continuously brushed against and pressed onto Yang Kai’s arm, which made Shan Qing Luo’s cheeks blush bright red, and she soon released her grip.

“Don’t!” Yang Kai hurriedly stopped her, “My Movement Skill is only a short-ranged technique and my Yuan Qi is about to be exhausted, at that time I’ll need your help!” Yang Kai hurried held her hand.

(PewPewLaserGun: Mmhmm... suuuuure... we believe you...)

(Silavin: Why do you think he only thinks about sex? Oh wait...)

“En!” Shan Qing Luo nodded slightly and continued holding Yang Kai’s arm as they dashed through the jungle.

Half an hour later, Guo Yuan Ming and his band were catching up!

They all knew what the consequences would be if they allowed Shan Qing Luo to escape, so they spared no effort in chasing her down.

Shan Qing Luo ground her teeth in hatred and anger, “If this time I can escape, I will let them suffer a fate worse than death!”

Yang Kai quickly quipped, “You should worry more about what will happen if they catch up to us.”

Shan Qing Luo’s complexion suddenly paled as a ripple of fear gripped her heart and sent a shiver through her tender body.

Suddenly, her beautiful face showed a touch of intoxicated blush and she resolutely declared, “If that is my fate will be... before then, I’ll give myself to you first! In any case, you’re not too terrible, at least a bit better than those damn bastards.”

“Ah...” Yang Kai looked towards her in surprise, half laughing half crying, “My fair lady, although I am happy you’d propose so, I know that if I accept your offer I won’t have a good end. So I’m afraid I’ll have to decline.”

Shan Qing Luo glanced at him bitterly and whispered, “So you already know?”

“Of course I know.”

In this life or death crisis, there was no need to hide anything, so Shan Qing Luo sighed and explained, “I have a special constitution called the Poison Widow Body!”

Yang Kai, somewhat scared, quickly said, “What kind of constitution is that, what are its characteristics?” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“When I become aroused, all my bodily fluids become highly toxic, including my breath!” Shan Qing Luo looked at him meaningfully. “Now you should understand why you fainted the last time I kissed you, right?”

Yang Kai quickly licked his lips, recalling the sweet and savory flavour from that experience.

“The more intense my emotional state, the more potent the poison becomes! Last time was just a little punishment. Who told you to be so presumptuous!”

However, Yang Kai simply grinned stupidly, “I also had no choice, who told you to catch me back then for no reason why? ... All your bodily fluids, does that include... you know... down there?”

Shan Qing Luo’s face instantly turned bright red, and she violently cursed, “Shameless!”

Yang Kai hesitantly asked, “So if you’re intimate with someone, they die?”

“Yes!” Shan Qing Luo took a deep breath, already deeply regretting telling her secrets to this little bastard. This rogue dared to say anything that popped into his head. He was truly shameless. It was simply unbearable.

Yang Kai suddenly averted his eyes and asked, “Then... how about I get you in the mood then you spit a few mouthfuls of poison at them?”

(Silavin: Damn. I would certainly do that. Though, how would he wash it off? Heck, if it is so potent, she could milk herself and kill all her foes. =.=)

“Can you at least try to be serious!” Shan Qing Luo really couldn’t stand it. Just what the hell was going through this little bastards mind right now?

“I was being serious.” Yang Kai said bluntly.

Even as the two quipped back and forth, their feet never stopped moving, racing forward as fast as the wind when all of a sudden, the area in front of them opened up, and they rushed out of the jungle.

The two of them suddenly paused, extremely shocked by the scene in front of them.

Not far away, there was actually another two groups of people.

One of the groups had completely surrounded the other, and the ones in the centre were all wearing faces of unwillingness and despair.

As Yang Kai swept his eyes over them, he couldn’t help being startled.

He found that the surrounded group was actually the group led by Qiu Yi Meng, the giant breasted Luo Xiao Man, and the Bai Family’s Bai Yun Feng were among them. In addition, there were three or four other True Element Boundary cultivators along with several dead bodies on the ground, blood constantly flowing from them.

(Silavin: I love how the person needs to be described as Giant Breasted haha.)

The group encircling them were all staring maliciously towards Qiu Yi Meng’s group. Most of them directed their gaze towards Qiu Yi Meng and Luo Xiao Man’s bodies. Their eyes exposed an obscene light.

Qiu Yi Meng wryly smiled while Luo Xiao Man’s beautiful face had gone pale. The two women stood back to back, their breath ragged and their True Qi also completely depleted.

After escaping for so many days, they had finally been overtaken by the Devil Path cultivators of the Ash-Gray Cloud Evil Land. Experiencing a desperate battle where several of them had been killed, they had now been completely surrounded.

It was just as they came to understand that escape was impossible that Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo suddenly appeared.
