Yuan Wu had lost consciousness while Madam Hua’s expression remained livid. At that moment, the atmosphere in the beach was eerily quiet. Moments later, Madam Hua snarled at Yuan Wu, “Stop pretending! Get up now!”

It wasn’t possible for Yuan Wu, a Dragonborn in the Second-Order Emperor Realm, to be defeated by Yang Kai, a Human in the First-Order Emperor Realm, with just one palm strike. Therefore, Madam Hua concluded that Yuan Wu was just pretending to have passed out. Although she didn’t understand the reason behind it, she still shouted at Yuan Wu because he was the only person she could still order around at the moment.

However, Yuan Wu remained lying on the ground. It seemed that he had really passed out. Seeing that, Madam Hua approached him and landed a forceful kick on him, but he remained reactionless.

“How dare you!” Madam Hua bellowed. Just when she was about to keep rebuking Yuan Wu, she realized that her vision had turned a tone darker. When she raised her gaze, her pupils contracted uncontrollably, for Yang Kai was standing right in front of her and glaring at her.

Feeling her chest tightening, Madam Hua took a few steps back and asked in fright, “What are you trying to do?”

Upon finishing her words, she started to circulate her Emperor Qi and pushed out her palm at Yang Kai’s chest. She seemed to have planned for it earlier as there were no signs that suggested that she would make such a move. Judging from her expression and posture just now, no one could have guessed that she was about to take action.

After she pushed out her palm, she put on a sinister grin. She believed that Yang Kai must have never suspected she would launch such an attack. Given that their cultivation realm was the same, she had the confidence of defeating him with just one palm.

“What a devious woman.” Yang Kai snorted and pushed his palm forward as well. Despite the fact that he made a move later than Madam Hua, he managed to land a palm strike on her shoulder first.

“Ah!” Madam Hua was sent flying backwards from the impact as her mouth was instantly filled with blood. At the same time, she felt excruciating pain in her shoulder, so she knew that her bones must have been fractured. Just then, she felt a violent energy rushing along all her meridians and spreading across her five viscera and six organs, throwing her Emperor Qi circulation into chaos.

[How is he so strong?] Madam Hua widened her eyes in disbelief. Although both of them were in the First-Order Emperor Realm, Madam Hua realized that Yang Kai was far more powerful than she was. Just one attack was enough to make her realize that there was a huge difference between them.

A moment later, she fell to the ground, and before she managed to get to her feet, her vision turned dark again. Raising her head, she saw Yang Kai looking down at her with a sneer.

“How dare you attack me!” Flabbergasted, Madam Hua had forgotten about the pain in her shoulder as she stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“Why wouldn’t I dare to attack you?” Yang Kai raised his leg and put his foot on her chest, causing her tall peaks to deform noticeably.

Feeling a sharp pain, Madam Hua knitted her brows together. At the same time, she was stunned by what Yang Kai had said. [How dare he lay a hand on me? I’m Fu Chi’s favourite woman, no one has ever had the guts to attack me!]

“You court death!” Madam Hua turned mad as she gathered her Emperor Qi in an attempt to resist; however, with Yang Kai’s foot still pressing against her body, she couldn’t even get up, let alone counterattack. As she was clawing at the air, her hair became messy. At that moment, she looked like a mad shrew, completely unlike her beautiful self earlier. Her face had contorted as her gaze was filled with a sense of hatred.

“How are you still so arrogant at this point?” Yang Kai snorted and exerted more force with his foot, causing Madam Hua to wail and her face to turn pale.

It was then Lu San Niang came to her senses. After Yang Kai killed the Golden Backed Red Carp, she was stunned at the sight and rooted to the spot. It wasn’t until she sensed Yang Kai’s murderous intent that she regained her senses. Following that, she rushed over and grabbed Yang Kai’s arm before shouting, “Little Brother Yang, you can’t kill her!”

“There’s no one I can’t kill in this world.” With a ruthless expression, Yang Kai turned his head and glared at her.

It was the first time Lu San Niang saw Yang Kai looking so ferocious. After some contact with him, she believed that, while a bit arrogant, he was a reasonable man. Now though, he seemed to have completely changed, she was stunned and instinctively flinched.

Nevertheless, it was she and her daughter who caused this problem. If Yang Kai really killed Madam Hua, none of them would be able to leave the island alive. With that said, the problem had come to a point where it couldn’t possibly be solved anymore.

Given Madam Hua’s temperament, it wasn’t possible that she would let them off after she was humiliated in such a way. They would have to pay a hefty price to dispel her fury.

“You can’t kill her, Little Brother Yang. Release her first!” Lu San Niang tried to persuade him. Although she was grateful that he was standing up for her and her daughter, things had come to a point where she had been put in a tight spot. Whatever the case, they couldn’t kill Madam Hua, and they could only come up with a way to settle the issue later.

Seeing that Lu San Niang was showing her weak side, Madam Hua became haughty again as she snarled, “You bitch! I’ll definitely tell Sir what all of you have done to me. Just you wait!”

Her face turning a shade paler, Lu San Niang pleaded, “Elder Sister, it’s all my fault, and it has nothing to do with Qin’er. Please forgive her and never mention her name in front of Sir.”

Madam Hua sneered, “It’s no use begging me now. It’s too late! All of you must die!”

She shot a malicious glare at the mother and daughter as she watched their faces transformed by fear. Feeling gleeful, she shifted her attention to Yang Kai, but she was soon stunned. That was because she couldn’t see any sign of fear on his face. Instead, he was calm and collected, as though he was unperturbed by what he had just done.

[What’s wrong with him?]

“Elder Sister Lu, you see it now? You’re kind-hearted enough to let her go, but she isn’t willing to let you off. Why don’t I just kill her and end all the trouble?” Although Yang Kai was staring at Madam Hua, he was talking to Lu San Niang in a dispassionate tone.

Feeling anxious, Lu San Niang fell silent, for she wasn’t sure what she should do. If they released Madam Hua, she would go back and tell Fu Chi what had happened; however, if they killed her now, Fu Chi would also make sure that they couldn’t leave the island alive.

Whatever their decision, the outcome would be the same. In her heart, she was extremely exasperated. The incident on this day happened because Madam Hua’s red carp had been slightly injured, which wasn’t a big deal at all. Nevertheless, Madam Hua still brought along her subordinates to find fault with them; moreover, they had already apologized to her, but she still wanted them to suffer miserably.

“You… want to kill me?” Finally understanding the emotion behind Yang Kai’s gaze, Madam Hua was gripped by fear. In an instant, she was no longer arrogant as her body turned cold, as though all her blood had been frozen over. She had never expected that someone would have the guts to kill her on this island one day.

With a sneer, Yang Kai replied, “You think I’m making a joke?”

If they were in a different place, it wouldn’t matter whether he would kill Madam Hua. However, they were now on Dragon Island, and such a conflict had happened between Madam Hua and them, so they could never let her go. As for the consequences of killing her, they could only think about them later.

Engulfed in his murderous intent, Madam Hua was flustered as the colour had been drained from her face. She certainly didn’t expect that things would come to such a point. If she knew Yang Kai was such a daredevil, she would have given in to him earlier. Nevertheless, it had never crossed her mind that Yuan Wu would be of no use to her at all.

“Don’t kill me! Please don’t kill me! I won’t pursue this matter again! I swear! Please let me go!” Madam Hua pleaded with him as her body trembled. Finally realizing that he truly intended to kill her, all she wanted now was to survive. Hence, she stopped caring about her dignity. Due to the fact that she was terrified, her tears were now slipping down her face.

Seeing that Yang Kai still remained impassive, she hurriedly shouted out to Lu San Niang, “San Niang, we were Sisters for centuries, and I treated you well in the past. I know I’m in the wrong here, so will you please forgive me?”

Lu San Niang’s heart softened as she really didn’t have the heart to kill her. On the other hand, Lu Yu Qin was incensed. Earlier, Madam Hua had haughtily shamed her mother, but she now appeared to be lowly and servile, which was why Lu Yu Qin was gleeful. However, she also felt horrified as she had never seen anyone being killed before. It was then she realized that lives could be so fragile in the face of a threat.

“San Niang…” Madam Hua continued to plead with her.

Lu San Niang was in a dilemma as she wasn’t sure if she should keep asking for Yang Kai’s mercy on Madam Hua’s behalf. She had always been a kind-hearted woman, and although Madam Hua had always opposed her in the past, she still didn’t have the heart to watch her get killed over such a trivial matter. In the end, her nature got the better of her as she parted her lips and was ready to plead with Yang Kai, but just then, she suddenly frowned and turned to look at the sea.

The next moment, her expression changed drastically as she exclaimed, “A Dragon!”

She could sense that a Pureblood Dragon was approaching them, and it seemed that the person was just as powerful as Fu Chi. She had lived on Dragon Island for years, so naturally, she was sensitive to the presence of members of the Dragon Clan.

Following that, she shifted her attention to Yang Kai and said anxiously, “Little Brother Yang, release her now!” No matter which Dragon Clan member was coming, they couldn’t let the person see this sight; otherwise, Yang Kai would be doomed.

Naturally, Yang Kai had noticed this newcomer’s approach as well. However, unlike how flustered Lu San Niang was, there was a tinge of strangeness in his expression as he stared fixedly in the direction the Dragon Clan member was coming.

“Hahaha!” Madam Hua started cackling all of a sudden as she no longer appeared to be subservient.

With an insidious expression, she glowered at Yang Kai and said coldly, “You want to kill me? Try it! Since you have the guts to harm me, I’ll slowly settle the score with you. I’ll make sure you’ll go through the cruellest torture in this world!”

As a Dragon was coming, she was no longer afraid of Yang Kai. Glaring at him, it was as though she was trying to imprint this revolting face in her mind forever. Then, she shifted her attention to Lu San Niang and her daughter. She seemed to be shooting imaginary daggers at them through her gaze.

Lu San Niang was astounded as she said, “Little Brother Yang, release her now. A member of the Dragon Clan is coming.”

Although Madam Hua was just Fu Chi’s plaything, she was still his woman. No matter which Dragon Clan member was coming, the person wouldn’t watch her get killed without doing anything. Most probably, the person would murder Yang Kai.

At that moment, Lu San Niang was completely on edge.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
