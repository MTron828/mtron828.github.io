Chapter 83 - What is special about Xia Ning Chang

The night that Kai Yang broke through into the initial element stage, there was a female wearing a veil that attacked him during his breakthrough. Originally, he thought that she was going to kill him, it wasn’t until that final moment, he found out that this really wasn’t the case. She had just wanted to assist him with breaking through, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to block any of the strikes from that veiled female.

At that time, Kai Yang already had his suspicions about the identity of the lady, and now he had finally been able to confirm the identity of that veiled female.

Once he did so his heart filled with appreciation for his senior Xia.

Unfortunately old man Meng jumped into between Kai Yang and Xia Ning Chang, interrupting their sweet moment. And, like a mother hen protecting her little chicks, he protected his treasured disciple.

Suspiciously, Kai Yang looked towards him, asking: “You know each other?”

Snorting, Meng Wu Ya showed a face full of pride and righteousness: “This is my disciple!”

“Your disciple?” Kai Yang’s jaw nearly fell to ground as his eyes continuously flitted between Xia Ning Chang and Meng Wu Ya in complete disbelief.

He never would have thought, he truly never would have thought it. That such an irresponsible man like Treasurer Meng would actually accept a disciple. This couldn’t be a accidental or false disciple could it?

“You two........know each other?” Glancing to the side, Meng Wu Ya asked Kai Yang.

“We don’t know each other!” Xia Ning Chang’s response was extremely clear and firm, leaving no room for argument. As she replied, she also moved to hide behind Meng Wu Ya, positioning her hands in a defensive manner.

Kai Yang took the hint and chuckled: “It can’t be counted as knowing each other. It’s just that on that night, senior sister helped me with a small matter.”

Meng Wu Ya nodded his head. Xia Ning Chang had already informed him regarding this matter, and if it wasn’t for that night’s matter, then she wouldn’t have found out that Kai Yang had such pure Yang type World Qi.

“Treasurer Meng, what type of task does senior sister need my help for? Could you please tell me?” He asked with an inquisitive look. Since it was related to Xia Ning Chang he wouldn’t reject the request no matter the task.

Instead of replying, Meng Wu Ya turned to his beloved disciple and inquired: “Is he okay?”

Xia Ning Chang’s delicate earlobes suddenly reddened, lowering her eyes one could see her long eyelashes were trembling. Only after a good while did she tentatively nod her head.

Seeing her act like this, Meng Wu Ya couldn’t help but let out a small sigh of exasperation: “Stop, stop, stop. Since time is limited, it will be him.”

Standing to side, Kai Yang observed the proceedings without saying a word.

A few minutes later, Meng Wu Ya suddenly started to speak in a serious tone: “Kai Yang, you should know that on this earth, there are certain types of people that are different from ordinary people. These people possess skills and abilities that normal people can’t possibly fathom.”

Kai Yang could only stare blankly before softly responding: “Treasurer Meng, you are talking about those people who have a special physique?”

“That’s right.” He answered while nodding his head, “These people are protected by the heavens, and are the children of the heavens. Some are gifted in cultivating, others can heal quicker than others, while other physiques are more suited to battling. There are various types of physiques, coming in all shapes and forms, but no matter who it is, as long as they possess a special physique they are subjected to the envy of others. It’s just, those who possess special physiques are extremely rare; you might not even find one in a million people. Little Kai Yang, you are very lucky because today you are blessed enough to see someone with a special physique.”

In shock, Kai Yang glanced at Xia Ning Chang who was currently hiding behind Meng Wu Ya: “Don’t tell me it’s senior sister............”

“He he........” With a face full of arrogance, Meng Wu Ya grinned from his heart, nodding his head he replied: “That’s right. Ning Chang is different from ordinary people.”

Kai Yang’s heart was going up and down. Never in a thousand instances would he have thought this little and easily shy senior sister was actually someone who possessed a special physique.

“What is special about senior sister?” Kai Yang couldn’t help but curiously ask.

Meng Wu Ya didn’t reply but instead sank into contemplation while muttering to himself, finally saying: “These fruits on the tree have just matured, so my dear disciple, turn them into pills.”

“En.” Xia Ning Chang walked up to the Three Sun’s Fruit Tree and lightly plucked the ripe fruits from its branches.

Kai Yang didn’t ask anything, he felt that all his questions would soon be answered.

“My disciple, let him see some of your might.” Meng Wu Ya chuckled.

Xia Ning Chang nodded her head then walked up to Kai Yang. Taking one of her white jade hands she placed the fruits on the palm of her hand.

“Please watch junior brother.” Xia Ning Chang quietly instructed him, before activating her World Qi.

Kai Yang was extremely shocked. This was because as she activated her World Qi, he saw that the from within the fruits, out surged a glowing red energy.

The Yang energy within the fruits burst out. Since Kai Yang cultivated the True Yang Tactics, he was extremely sensitive to Yang energy. Currently he could clearly feel the the energy within the Three Sun’s Fruits, violently bursting outwards.

But......how did this happen?

The energy that came from within the fruits converged in front of Xia Ning Chang. Once all the energy had been extracted from the the fruits, Kai Yang watched as they deflated without an ounce of Yang Qi to be sensed within them before disintegrating into the wind. This process all happened in the span of ten breaths.

Xia Ning Chang moved again; one hand held the extracted energy, while the other hand performed some unknown movements in the air.

Then the Yang Qi from within Coiling Dragon Stream rushed towards her in one solid stream. With a motion of her hand, Xia Ning Chang grabbed that qi and added to the already condensed red coloured energy from the fruits. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As time went on, her grabbing speed became faster and faster as each handful of Yang Qi assimilated with the red energy from the fruits in her palm.

Though as more energy was poured in, not only did the accumulated energy not expand, it actually decreased in size.

But the energy within the energy ball was becoming stronger and stronger.

A few minutes later, Xia Ning Chang finally stopped seizing Yang Qi from Coiling Dragon Stream, she then used her two hands to squeeze the energy ball.

Her two hands quickly clasped together and when she reopened her hands again, there were three bright red pills within her palm. The pills were smooth and round, with a alluring luster, not to mention the pill marks were all clearly visible.

Watching this had long since caused Kai Yang to stare blankly ahead with no reaction!

The scene that had played out, apart from using peak level skills, there was no possible way to explain it.

It was only at that moment, did Kai Yang realise how his senior sister had obtained that bottle of pills. They were refined by her in such a manner!

But, wasn’t that too easy and simple? Receiptair masters were originally rare, and along with the successful refinement of pills, there would always be many failures. Not to mention when receiptair masters refined pills, they required the usage of special tools, examples of which would be furnaces, fire, etc.

But senior sister Xia had only used her hands, and apart from the Three Sun’s Fruit, she didn’t use any other materials, yet she so easily crafted those three pills.

“For you!” Putting her hand in front of Kai Yang, she offered the pills to him.

Taking in a deep breath, Kai Yang calmed his flustered heart before taking the pills from her. Then he carefully inspected each pill and discovered that each and every one of them held Yang Qi that was far richer and denser than the original fruit. Afterall, when Xia Ning Chang was refining the pills, she had also added Yang Qi from Coiling Dragon Stream.

“Senior sister, if you were to start refining pills, then the current sellers would have no customers left.” Kai Yang said as he forced out a bitter smile. Never had he seen someone simplify pill refinement to such a degree.
