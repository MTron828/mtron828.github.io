Right in front of everyone’s eyes, the black dot in the void soon expanded to the size of a baby’s fist. Furthermore, the aura of another Universe World wafted from the black dot.

Yang Kai arched his brow as he finally understood why so many people had gathered together in this place.

Xu Wang exclaimed, “It’s a Universe Cave Heaven!”

The black dot that suddenly appeared in the void was actually a portal that led to a Universe Cave Heaven.

The Small Universes of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters were corporeal. If their Small Universe didn’t collapse when they passed away, there was a chance for them to merge with the Void. The Small Universes left behind by Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters after their deaths were called Universe Paradises, while the ones left behind by Eighth-Order and Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were called Universe Cave Heavens.

There were countless Great Territories in the 3,000 Worlds. There might be some existing Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens in any Great Territory, but it was always hard to find the entrances to these hidden Worlds.

Of all the Great Territories, there was no doubt that the Shattered Heaven had the highest number of Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens; after all, this was the place where many Great Experts fought against one another in ancient times. Countless High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had passed away here.

Many of the Sects in the 3,000 Worlds, especially the Second Class great forces, had their own teams deployed into the Shattered Heaven all year round in the hope that they could find those hidden portals.

Before coming to the Shattered Heaven, Yang Kai thought about the possibility of him discovering such a portal, but that remained a casual thought, as he didn’t have any high hopes of it.

The Shattered Heaven had existed for countless years already, so the portals that were easy to find had all been discovered. Those that were not yet discovered must be extremely well hidden. Moreover, the Shattered Heaven was vast. Even though he was a Master of Space Principles, he might not be able to find anything even if he searched.

However, Yang Kai had never expected that while chasing after Blood Crow, he would come across a portal that led to a Universe Cave Heaven.

This was the legacy that was left behind by an Open Heaven Realm Master that was at least in the Eighth-Order, possibly containing that Master’s entire inheritance. Even other High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would be tempted, not to mention those in the Mid-Rank.

While Yang Kai was in a dazed state, the black dot had expanded to the size of a palm. All of a sudden, right in front of everyone’s eyes, the portal that led to the Universe Cave Heaven contracted and disappeared as though it had never existed before.

Yang Kai and Xu Wang were stunned upon seeing that.

The burly man, who was asked a question by Yang Kai some time ago, was initially looking forward to entering the portal. All his energy was about to surge as he was ready to dash into it; however, all his hopes were crushed since the portal had abruptly disappeared. He then let out a sigh and cursed.

According to his mutterings, it seemed this wasn’t the first time such an incident happened. There were many times in the past when the portal didn’t successfully open.

It was then that Yang Kai realised why this place had attracted so many people to come together.

It was apparent that for some reason, the portal of this Universe Cave Heaven started showing signs of opening recently, but there were many times when it didn’t fully open. After word got out, many Open Heaven Realm Masters started gathering in this place in the hope that they could go in and snatch up the treasures when the portal fully opened.

“Could you forcefully open it if you make a move, Junior Brother?” Xu Wang secretly asked.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai nodded, “It would take some effort.”

It was then Xu Wang arched his brow, “You’re truly incredible, Junior Brother!”

Suddenly realising something, Yang Kai turned to look at him, “You know me, Senior Brother Xu?”

The question was somewhat strange; after all, they had just parted ways outside of the Astral Wind Divine Ability after only exchanging names. Nevertheless, from the questions Xu Wang was asking, he seemed to know about him.

With a smile, Xu Wang replied, “I found your name familiar when I first heard it, and after witnessing you take action, I finally recalled that there was a person who had embarrassed the Cave Heavens and Paradises in the Dao Theory Assembly in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven back then. Even a Core Disciple of Thousand Cranes Paradise was killed. Furthermore, the Star Boundary and High Heaven Territory has become household names since the appearance of a World Tree over there. Even though this Xu doesn’t care about worldly affairs, it’s not like I’m deaf. There are trillions upon trillions of people in the 3,000 Worlds, and countless people share the same names; however, you’re a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and even Blood Crow, who has been reborn by occupying someone else’s body, was not a match for you. If I can’t figure out who you are, I’d be embarrassing my own Sect, Bright King Cave Heaven.”

Yang Kai nodded gently.

There was a shocked expression on Xu Wang’s face as he asked, “Are you really that Void Land’s Yang Kai?”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “Haven’t you already figured it out?”

Xu Wang landed a slap on his own forehead and grinned, “It was just a speculation, but I hadn’t expected it to be true.” He then looked fervently at him, “I heard that you killed Zuo Quan Hui. Is that true?”

Yang Kai replied, “It’s true, but there’s a lot more to that story. I didn’t achieve that on my own.”

Xu Wang nodded, “Regardless of how you did it, it’s astonishing enough already that you were able to kill a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master while only being in the Sixth-Order. En, you’re stronger than I am. I should probably call you Senior Brother instead.”

As he spoke, there was a bashful expression on his face. When he first met Yang Kai, he immediately claimed to be the Senior Brother. At that time, he just thought that other than the disciples from the Cave Heavens and Paradises, no one else in the Sixth-Order could be a match for him. Since he was now aware that this person was the famous Yang Kai, he didn’t have the nerve to claim that he was a Senior Brother to him.

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “Well, you’re definitely older than I am, Senior Brother Xu.”

Xu Wang rolled his eyes, “Why don’t you just say that my aptitude is worse than yours?” He was an open-minded person though, and since Yang Kai didn’t mind calling him Senior Brother, he wouldn’t be concerned either.

After straightening his face, Xu Wang looked at the spot where the portal appeared and asked, “I wonder who the senior expert was that left behind this Universe Cave Heaven. Do you want to open it, Junior Brother?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “There are too many people watching over the portal now. If we make any rash moves, we’ll just draw public outrage. We’d be better off just waiting and seeing. Moreover, I don’t know where Blood Crow is. It will be troublesome if he launches a sneak attack on us while we’re distracted.”

Xu Wang nodded in agreement.

Thus, they continued waiting in silence.

A few days later, the portal appeared once again. Previously, it had expanded to the size of a palm and disappeared. This time, it had expanded to the size of a washbasin.

Yang Kai had no idea how many times this portal had appeared before, but it seemed that it was getting bigger every time it opened. The reason the people around here never made a move was that the portal was not large enough for a Human to pass through. If they forcefully tried to enter through it, it might lead to some unexpected consequences.

From the looks of it, the portal would be large enough for them to enter after two more openings. By then, there would be a fierce struggle between the evenly matched opponents for control of the entrance.

It was apparent that Blood Crow had been hiding in this place without exposing his aura because he wanted to sneak into this Universe Cave Heaven and get rid of Yang Kai.

Certainly, Yang Kai wouldn’t let him achieve his goal. He had learned how hard it was to kill Blood Crow. If he couldn’t destroy him this time, it would be extremely difficult to do so after the latter recovered.

Although there were some grudges between them, Blood Crow was the one who had suffered most of the setbacks. If Yang Kai hadn’t ruined his original plan, he would’ve refined the Blood Monster Divine Palace and occupied it. If he were successful, all the resources in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven would’ve belonged to him. Blood Crow could’ve slowly restored his strength instead of wandering around in the Shattered Heaven.

From Yang Kai’s perspective, it wasn’t necessary for him to destroy the other party.

However, he also had his eyes on the Grand Evolution Immortal Blood Light Scripture.

He had comprehended parts of the Blood Light Scripture in the Blood Monster Cave Heaven before, so he knew that the Secret Art was truly abstruse. Unfortunately, those tablets there were not complete, so he was unable to have a full picture of the Secret Art.

The Blood Light Scripture was a Secret Art related to the Dao of Blood. If he could fully comprehend it, it would be immensely beneficial to his Dragon Clan bloodline. Besides him, the Dragon Clan members from Void Land would benefit as well. Even the other Divine Spirits might be able to have a clearer picture of their futures by learning this Secret Art.

Bi Xi and Zhu Jiu Yin once told him that the way Divine Spirits cultivated was different from that of Human cultivators. For the Divine Spirits, it was all about improving their bloodline. The stronger their bloodline, the more powerful they would be.

The Blood Light Scripture might be useful to the Divine Spirits in Void Land. Even if it wasn’t the key to unlocking the shackles of their bloodlines, they would still get something out of it.

Therefore, if Yang Kai could capture Blood Crow, he would not hesitate to make a move against him. Nevertheless, this guy was even more adept than Yang Kai at fleeing and saving himself. That was the reason Yang Kai hadn’t managed to achieve his goal.

A few days later, the portal opened up again, and it was two times larger than before.

It seemed that just like Yang Kai had speculated, the portal would be large enough for the cultivators to pass through when it opened one more time.

Certainly, the other Open Heaven Realm Masters who had gathered together in this place had figured this out as well; therefore, these hundreds of people, who were initially calm and quiet, now became tense and morose. They secretly circulated their strength so that when the portal opened again, they could immediately charge into it and gaze upon the magnificence of the Universe Cave Heaven.

As time passed, the tension in the air intensified as they all looked around with vigilance.

Suddenly, there came a moment when six people moved forward and stood right in front of the portal.

Seeing that, Xu Wang snorted, “Ridiculous!”

These people apparently wanted to stay close to the portal and be the first to enter. Although they appeared to be fairly powerful, the Open Heaven Realm Masters at the scene naturally wouldn’t allow them to achieve their goal. If they ignited public outrage, they would be knocked out of the competition in advance.

However, as soon as Xu Wang finished speaking, a few more groups of people came forward from all directions. The numbers of people varied from two to eight.

Soon, over thirty people had gathered together in front of the portal.

These people then surrounded the portal as though they had already agreed upon it. The next instant, they activated their auras together.

The onlookers, who initially looked teasingly at them, had their expressions changed, while Xu Wang turned solemn as well.

That was because seven out of the more than thirty people were in the Sixth-Order. The rest of them were weaker, but they were all in the Fifth-Order.

It was apparent that they didn’t come from the same great force. They belonged to about five to six different Sects, but since they knew each other, they had secretly come to an agreement to help each other out. As soon as they made a move, they were in an advantageous position, and the rest had to be wary of these people.
