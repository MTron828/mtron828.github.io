Shan Qing Luo was an extremely seductive woman. Back when she was in the Tong Xuan Realm, she was known as the Beguiling Demon Queen, and now that her strength had grown markedly, her charms had become even more stunning.

A bright red dress might look gaudy on most, but she was able to wear such colours with ease and they only made her beauty appear even more striking.

At this moment, she was holding a wine glass in her hand as she gazed out at the sky with narrowed eyes. She seemed to be observing the stars and the moon, but upon closer look, one would realise that her eyes were out of focus, as though she wasn’t looking at anything physical before them.

Then, she slightly lifted her head and poured the wine into her mouth. The clear liquid slid down the corners of her mouth and fair neck before sneaking into the deepest part of her unknown valley, dampening her clothes. If there was a man in this place, his blood would undoubtedly boil and he would lose all control of his rationality from this sight.

Staring at the Starry Sky, she raised her hand and grabbed the air, as though she was trying to grasp a star and never let it go. However, when she spread her palm, there was nothing in it.

Agitated, she hurled the wine glass away and messed up her hair before bellowing through clenched teeth, “That jerk!”

The sound of a wine glass breaking to pieces shocked the people outside and the door was quickly pushed open, upon which an hourglass figure stepped into the room. After taking a look at Shan Qing Luo and then the broken glass on the floor, this newcomer silently crouched down and began cleaning up.

“Bi Luo, come here.” Shan Qing Luo beckoned to her. Her voice was soft and pleasant to the ears. Even Bi Luo, as a woman, felt her chest tightening upon hearing that, as though something was squirming within her body, causing her to be fidgety.

Placing her palm on her forehead, Bi Luo uttered, “Mistress, what do you want?”

“Come here!” Shan Qing Luo was being unreasonable because she was drunk.

Feeling helpless, Bi Luo walked up to her, but before she could stop in her tracks, she was pulled into Shan Qing Luo’s embrace and placed on her thighs.

Looking up, she realised that Shan Qing Luo’s alluring face was just a finger length away. Her lips were as translucent as rubies and the breath she let out exuded an intoxicating scent. Shan Qing Luo was looking down at her with a smile as her long hair tickled Bi Luo’s face.

Bi Luo gulped as her face turned completely red, “Mistress…”

However, Shan Qing Luo just smiled at her without uttering a word, which caused Bi Luo to be on pins and needles. [Oh, my goodness. Is my wish going to be realised now? I haven’t gotten prepared yet. What should I do? Should I reject her? But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. When she sobers up, I’ll never get another opportunity…]

Bi Luo was a maidservant who had followed Shan Qing Luo all the way to this place from their original home in Fragrance City, so she had entrusted her heart and body to the latter long ago. Her cultivation wasn’t low, as she was in the First-Order Origin King Realm. In truth, Bi Luo’s aptitude wasn’t outstanding, so the reason she was able to achieve such success was all thanks to Shan Qing Luo’s support and guidance over the years.

Therefore, she would do anything for Shan Qing Luo. She wouldn’t even frown if her Mistress asked her to die for her. At this moment, she was panting heavily as her blood was boiling. Her entire body was stiff as though she had been struck by lightning.

“Do you love me?” Shan Qing Luo suddenly asked with a grin as her eyes appeared out of focus. As she spoke, she extended her finger and whisked across Bi Luo’s lips.

Bi Luo almost couldn’t contain her urge to lick it. Fortunately, she still hadn’t lost all her rationality yet. Torn between tears and laughter, she uttered, “Mistress, you’re drunk.”

“Nonsense.” Shan Qing Luo poked the maidservant’s red lips and spoke in a languid voice, “I’ve only downed a few bottles of wine tonight, so how would I be drunk? Hey, you haven’t answered my question.”

Pressing her lips together, Bi Luo nodded slightly and replied, “I’m yours.”

Shan Qing Luo chuckled, “You’re the best.”

Then, she leaned close to her and let out a fragrant breath. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Bi Luo widened her eyes in disbelief. Just when she thought something was going to happen, Shan Qing Luo only landed a kiss on her forehead, which caused her to feel dejected.

Just then, Shan Qing Luo uttered as she whisked across Bi Luo’s nose, “But we’re both women. If I were a man, I would’ve bedded you by now.”

Bi Luo looked away shyly and said in a small voice, “I am willing…”

“What do you mean?” Shan Qing Luo heaved a sigh, “It’s much better to be a man. He can leave whenever he wants without having to worry about anything. However, he isn’t aware that he’s taken my heart away as well. I don’t even know whether he’s having fun with other women right now. Perhaps he’s gotten more wives and even children. Maybe he has forgotten about me.”

An enraged Bi Luo said, “Mistress, that kind of man isn’t worthy of your love. You should just forget about him.”

Shan Qing Luo took the maidservant’s hand and placed it on her own chest before replying with a weak smile, “But this part of my body doesn’t agree.”

Bi Luo was heartbroken as her tears almost slid down her face. In a crestfallen manner, she uttered, “Mistress, no matter what happens to us or how the world changes, I will always be by your side. As long as you don’t chase me away, I will never leave.”

“Why would I chase you away?” Shan Qing Luo smiled faintly at her.

Bi Luo beamed at her as well before uttering in an awkward manner, “Mistress, if you really miss him so much… I have a way to help you unwind and relieve your longing.”

A curious Shan Qing Luo asked, “What do you mean?”

Bi Luo replied, “I’ve learned some illusion skills in recent years.”

“Oh?” Shan Qing Luo was surprised.

“I can transform into that person.”

Shan Qing Luo remained silent as she appeared tempted.

Seeing that, Bi Luo quickly struck while the iron was hot, “Maybe I won’t look exactly like him, but it’ll be 70 to 80 percent similar.”

“Who are you going to imitate?”

The voice from outside the window shocked the ladies.

Bi Luo immediately bounded off the chair and bellowed, “Who!?”

They were now in the most important location on Half-Moon Mountain, which was the Monster Queen’s bedroom. How was it possible that someone was able to approach this place without anyone noticing?

When Bi Luo raised her head, her jaw dropped as she uttered dazedly, “Y-Y-You…” That was because she saw a face that she had never expected to see there.

Shan Qing Luo was stunned as well. She fell into a dazed state as she was gazing at the face she had been missing for the past several dozen years.

“Luo’er!” Yang Kai grinned and waved his hand at her before turning to look at Bi Luo, “Little girl, it’s quite bold of you to try to snatch my woman when I’m not around!”

He had known about Bi Luo’s ‘interest’ in Shan Qing Luo since their first meeting back in Tong Xuan Realm, but he had never expected that after so many years, she still hadn’t changed one bit. It could be said that she was really quite obstinate.

The harmonious relationship between Yin and Yang was the Grand Dao of the Heavens and Earth, but Bi Luo seemed dead set on going against it.

With that said, when they were still in Tong Xuan Realm, a certain incident had taken place between Yang Kai and Bi Luo, so upon their reunion, he couldn’t help but glance at her red lips.

The experience was extremely pleasant and he still remembered it vividly.

Upon finishing his words, he attempted to jump into the room through the window.

With a loud slam though, Shan Qing Luo shut the window as the hardwood smashed at Yang Kai’s nose, causing him to stop in his tracks.

“Hmph!” Liu Yan snorted at his side as her expression appeared mocking.

Inside the bedroom, Shan Qing Luo extended her hand and rubbed her own temple.

A stunned Bi Luo uttered, “Mistress, what are you doing?” [The man she’s been missing for years has finally appeared, so why did she shut him out? Shouldn’t she have crashed into his embrace and told him how much she missed him?]

Shan Qing Luo replied with a frown, “I think I’m seeing things because I’m drunk.”

As she spoke, she opened the window and gazed out again, but when she met a pair of eyes out there again, she immediately slammed the window shut once more.

“This wine is so strong. Bi Luo, where did you get it from?”

Seeing that, Bi Luo was torn between tears and laughter.

“Hey, you silly woman!” Unable to take it anymore, Yang Kai pushed the window open and leapt into the room. With an upright posture, he uttered, “How dare you avoid seeing me when I’m back! When did you become so gutsy?”

Shan Qing Luo took a step backwards and sized him up before asking in shock, “Are you really my husband?”

It was as though she hadn’t seen him until now.

Yang Kai took a step forward and pinched her cheek before pulling it to the other side, causing her beautiful face to contort. In a fierce manner, he questioned, “What in the world are you doing?”

“No…” Shan Qing Luo couldn’t even speak clearly, “I thought I was seeing an illusion. Are you really back? Oh, I’m so happy. I don’t think I can contain my joy.”

Although her words sounded happy, she spoke in a monotone voice that clearly portrayed her displeasure.

The corners of Yang Kai’s eyes twitched as this was different from his imagination. After a snort, he released her.

Shan Qing Luo rubbed her cheek and looked meekly at him. Appearing guilty, she asked cautiously, “Husband, how long have you been there? Have you heard anything you shouldn’t have heard?”

Yang Kai grinned at her, “No matter what I should or should not hear, I’ve heard everything.”

Shan Qing Luo heaved a sigh as a glint of determination flashed across her eyes, as though she had just made an important decision. Then, she wrapped her arm around Bi Luo’s shoulder and pulled her into her embrace. Putting on a fearless face, she declared, “Good, there’s nothing I should hide. To be honest with you, Bi Luo and I are deeply in love with each other now. Our life together has been happy and carefree, so I’ve forgotten all about you. Please forgive me for feeling lonely and falling in love with someone else.”

As she spoke, she bowed to Yang Kai, “I’m sorry.”

The corners of Yang Kai’s brow twitched harder.

While Bi Luo was still dumbfounded, Shan Qing Luo pinched her back, after which Bi Luo hurriedly bent over and added, “I-I’m so sorry for snatching your woman.”

Shan Qing Luo straightened up and took Bi Luo’s hand before looking lovingly at her, “Husband… No. Little Brother Yang, as long as you don’t force us to break up, I’ll agree to any demand you come up with.”

“Little… Brother… Yang…?” Yang Kai said slowly through clenched teeth.

Shan Qing Luo replied with a smile, “You’re younger than I am, so there’s nothing wrong with how I address you. If it really bothers you, I can call you Big Brother Yang.”

Before she could finish her words, Yang Kai pinched both her cheeks again and pulled harder than last time as he muttered, “Are you done?”

“Stop it!” Shan Qing Luo bellowed, “We are no longer husband and wife, so why are you still touching me? Your actions are too outrageous!”

“Alright. Let’s talk about something serious now.” After Yang Kai was done messing with her face, he pretended to be stern and stared at her. He didn’t understand what she was doing. They hadn’t met for decades, and he had finally come back, so why did she put on such a show? What did she mean by this?

“Hmph. I am being serious.” Shan Qing Luo appeared displeased, “What’s wrong? You can flirt with other women out there, but why am I not allowed to fall in love with someone else?”
