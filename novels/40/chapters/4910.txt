Yang Kai once used the Black Ink Strength within his Small Universe to trick Lang Ya Paradise’s Black Ink Disciples into believing he was one of them. If the other end of the Void Corridor was really the Black Ink Battlefield, then there was a high chance that he would encounter the Black Ink Clan or Black Ink Disciples. In that case, this disguise would provide a large degree of security.

Outside the Void Corridor, many Ancestors spoke to Yang Kai, sharing with him what they knew about the Black Ink Battlefield.

Yang Kai took note of everything.

However, as Liu Mu had said before, they did not have personal experience in the Black Ink Battlefield, and all the information was passed back from beyond the No-Return Pass. Although this information could likely be attained as long as Yang Kai paid attention once he entered the Black Ink Battlefield, knowing ahead of time was still helpful.

A few days had passed.

The rate of dissipation of the ancient sealing power in the Void Corridor seemed to have accelerated again.

Mo Sha said, “We can’t wait any longer, let’s start sealing it as soon as possible.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Seniors, please wait just a moment longer!”

Saying so, he turned around and walked towards Void Land and High Heaven Palace’s group.

His Wives stood at the forefront of the group, each looking at him with intense expressions. Their eyes were full of worry and reluctance. When he got close to them, Yang Kai smiled faintly at them but did not try to comfort them. Any words of comfort at this time would only be self-deception. Everyone knew and understood the dangers of this trip.

Yu Ru Meng stood forward and her crimson lips began to quiver. There was much she wanted to say, but she held herself back. In the end, she simply said, “Be careful in everything you do!”

Yang Kai nodded and replied with a smile, “I will.”

He suddenly looked beyond the crowd and towards the depths of void, where several rays of light could vaguely be seen coming towards them in a hurry.

Yang Kai heaved a long sigh of relief that the ones he wanted to see had arrived at the last moment.

The leader of the group was Lan You Ruo, who had left Black Territory and returned to the Star Boundary a few months ago.

Perhaps due to pushing herself to her limit, even though Lan You Ruo was now a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, she still looked slightly pale and exhausted.

“Greetings, Proprietress!” Yang Kai cupped his fist and said.

Lan You Ruo glared at him, then at the Void Corridor, before asking in a dark tone, “Do you really have to do this?”

Yang Kai said helplessly, “It can’t be helped. There is no other way.”

Lan You Ruo pursed her lips and did not answer. She also knew that the workings of fate could not be changed by an individual’s power. Since the Cave Heavens and Paradises had already agreed to this, they could only follow the plan.

Yang Kai then looked at those behind her. There was the Fatty Chen Tian, Yun Xing Hua, Hei He, and Hua Qing Si. All of them were brought over from the Star Boundary by the Proprietress.

When their eyes met, they hastily saluted.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and called out one by one, “Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hui Gu, Hei He, Chen Tian Fei, Yun Xing Hua! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Subordinates are here!” The seven of them announced.

“In the past, due to various circumstances, all of you had to leave your names on the Loyalty List. I know some of you have complaints against me and are not resigned to your positions, but it matters not now. You’ve worked hard all these years, and your efforts and sacrifices have allowed High Heaven Palace and Void Land to grow to their current heights. All of you have contributed greatly to the Sect. It is unknown if life or death awaits me, so today, I will set you free. You are free to stay, or to go, but I hope that when we meet again in the future, we can still chat and share a drink with no animosities for one another!”

Saying so, Yang Kai took out the Loyalty List, took the Xie Zhi horn, forced out a drop of Blood Essence and dipped it. He then scratched their names from the list.

Fresh blood seeped into the Loyalty List, and the names on the pages gradually faded and disappeared.

The seven people whose names were on the Loyalty List suddenly felt a sense of relief. They inexplicably had a feeling of freedom from bondage.

Mao Zhe frowned slightly and looked at Yang Kai with conflicted emotions.

Of all the people who had signed the Loyalty List, he was the one who was most unconvinced by Yang Kai. He had endured his humiliation in order to one day advance to the Seventh-Order and free himself from the Loyalty List.

He had heard that by reaching the Seventh-Order, he would become free from the restrictions of the Loyalty List; however, he did not know if that was true or not. Regardless, he still worked hard towards that goal over the years.

He had never imagined that Yang Kai would take the initiative to dissolve the master-servant relationship between them. This made him slightly surprised and relieved.

In the days leading up to today, he was not unaware that Yang Kai was going to seal the Void Corridor, nor was he unaware of what may happen to Yang Kai once that happened.

Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, and his lives were connected to Yang Kai’s, so if anything happened to the latter, they would also suffer.

Now that the constraints of the Loyalty List had been lifted though, he no longer had to worry about their life or death because of Yang Kai’s problems.

However, Mao Zhe was not as happy as he imagined he would be.

Looking back on the years in Void Land and High Heaven Palace, it was no exaggeration to say it was an extremely easy and comfortable life. They had all the resources and status they could have wanted!

He had not advanced to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm simply because he had not felt a turning point.

Now that he was free, even if he left High Heaven Palace and Void Land, what other place could provide such a favourable environment for cultivation?

If Yang Kai could make this decision at the last moment, it was obvious that he had been thinking about this matter. This also hinted at the dangers of this trip.

Even Yang Kai was unsure if he could survive.

“Sect Master, since we have entered Void Land, we will not be duplicitous. Sect Master may rest assured and go. We will guard the Sect. You need not worry about anything here,” Mao Zhe said and cupped his fist.

Geng Qing and Zhou Ya also said, “Sect Master, please rest assured!”

Fatty Chen was far less dignified as snot and tears dripped from his face as he loudly proclaimed, “Sect Master, whether there is a Loyalty List or not, this Chen Tian Fei is a man of Void Land in life, and will be a ghost of Void Land in death! I swear to never do anything to betray the Sect! If I break my word, may I be struck by lightning and die a horrible death. With me, Chen Tian Fei, as its guardian, the Sect will never be in danger!”

Mao Zhe couldn’t help glancing sideways with a disgusted look on his face, thinking this ass-kisser had always been like this. [What can he do as a mere Fourth-Order Master? How dare he boast so shamelessly!]

When Yun Xing Hua and Hei He saw the others making their declarations, they also quickly expressed their loyalty to the Sect.

Honestly, they had lived a good life in Void Land all these years, and it was impossible for any other Sect to provide them with so many resources for cultivation. They would not leave even if they were driven away at this time.

Hui Gu was not so melodramatic, but his loyalty was unquestionable as he asked, “Sect Master, why don’t I accompany you so I may offer whatever assistance I can.”

Yang Kai, however, waved his hand and said, “This is a dangerous endeavour, and even the first step of entering the Void Corridor will not be safe. I am not sure what will happen, and if I take you with me, it will only serve to distract me.”

Hui Gu had nothing else to say when he heard this. If he was going to be a burden, then it was better not to go.

The seven of them were removed from the Loyalty List; Luan Bai Feng and Xin Peng had long been set free from its constraints. The latter naturally did not need to express their appreciation for the gesture.

Yang Kai looked at Hua Qing Si and said, “Head Manager, I’ll have to trouble you with the management of the Sect.”

Hua Qing Si squeezed out a smile and said, “Sect Master may rest assured, when you return one day, I will hand you back a Sect that is a thousand times better than the current one!”

Halfway through the journey, she had heard Lan You Ruo talk about some things and was clear about the dangers Yang Kai would be facing.

It could be said that this was definitely the biggest risk Yang Kai had ever had to take. This was not a task that could be accomplished by simply being careful. Even the slightest mistake would result in death.

No one would depend on luck for something as important as this.

Yu Ru Meng suddenly grit her teeth and said, “You’d better survive! If you dare to die, I will take all my Sisters and remarry! I mean what I say!”

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded sincerely, not knowing whether he was promising to survive or acknowledging that he approved of the remarriage.

What should be said, had been said. All things had been taken care of and he had no more worries left.

Yang Kai took a few steps back, looked out at Void Land and High Heaven Palace’s members, put on a solemn expression, cupped his fist, and declared, “Everyone, this is goodbye!

His eyes swept over the faces of Yu Ru Meng and the others as if he wanted to engrave them into his heart.

After saying that, he turned around and dashed towards the Void Corridor.

The women suppressed their emotions so that Yang Kai would not worry; however, the moment he turned around, all of them could not hold back anymore and began to shed tears.

However, none of them made a sound and continued to suppress their voices!

Yu Ru Meng clenched her fists so tightly that her fingernails dug into her skin and blood began to seep out along her fingers.

In front of the Void Corridor, Yang Kai nodded to the Eighth-Order Ancestors and said, “Junior is ready.”

All the Eighth-Orders cupped their fists in a solemn salute.

The burden of maintaining the peace of the 3,000 Worlds was placed on the back of a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Junior, which made all of them feel ashamed.

However, they all knew that only Yang Kai could seal the Void Corridor.

Fortunately, he understood the importance of the situation and did not object in any way.

The 3,000 Worlds was lucky to have such a son.

“May good fortune and longevity accompany you!” Liu Mu shouted in a deep voice.

“May good fortune and longevity accompany you!” The chant came from the mouths of the Cave Heavens and Paradises Masters and resounded throughout the void.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, turned around, and boldly rushed into the Void Corridor without hesitation or looking back.

The Void Corridor opened up and swallowed Yang Kai’s figure.

Not long after, space churned at the entrance of the Void Corridor. A black hole emerged and looked as if it could swallow everything for as far as the eye could see, but within half an hour, everything had disappeared.

Many Ancestors released their Divine Senses to inspect the region carefully before exchanging glances and nodding.

Even with their cultivation, they could not detect anything at the spot where the Void Corridor once stood. In other words, the entrance of the Void Corridor had been completely sealed. Unless someone like Yang Kai, who was proficient in the Dao of Space, chanced upon it and forced it open again, no one would ever be able to find this entrance.

However, the Cave Heavens and Paradises did not dare to be careless. After a short deliberation, they decided to designate Black Territory as a Restricted Area and seal all Territory Gates leading to it. No one from the 3,000 Worlds could enter without permission and at least one Eighth-Order Ancestor would be dispatched to monitor the situation at all times to guard against any potential problems.

It would be a similar setup to the Chaotic Dead Territory where an Eighth-Order Ancestor and a team of High-Rank Masters would be stationed at the Territory Gate, monitoring the movement of the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer.
