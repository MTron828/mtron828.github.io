Qiu Yu sighed, “You’re placing me in a difficult spot, Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai smiled and replied, “Don’t speak as though I’m an outsider, okay? It’ll only take you a little bit of effort to accomplish this matter. Furthermore, it’s not as if I’m asking you to take off your clothes and run around naked, right? Be more straightforward, okay? So, is it possible to change it or not?”

Qiu Yu’s face twitched as he stared at Yang Kai, “Changing it or not, what difference does it make?”

Giving a chuckle, Yang Kai patted on Qiu Yu’s shoulder, while conveniently wiping off the fruit juice on Qiu Yu’s clothes, “If we can change seats, we’ll become good friends. You’re happy, I’m happy, everyone’s happy. If it’s not possible, this Young Master will have no choice but to look for the City Lord to have a good chat, asking him about the whereabouts of his precious daughter...”

“Enough!” An icy expression flashed across Qiu Yu’s face as he smacked Yang Kai’s hand away. Staring at the Yang Kai, he growled between his clenched teeth, “Are you threatening me?!”

“Am I?” Yang Kai blinked, “You’re misunderstanding me, Brother Qiu. I’m just negotiating with you, that’s all.”

Qiu Yu replied in extreme anger, “I should have known not to ask you about Luo Bing’s whereabouts, you despicable person!”

Yang Kai grinned, “Young man, it’s not good to flare up so easily! It’s damaging to your body!”

Qiu Yu shot a glare at Yang Kai that lasted for a long while before he finally turned around and left. Arriving by the side of a man that had the makings of a steward, Qiu Yu whispered a few words into his ears.

Upon hearing those words, a slight frown appeared on the steward’s face, as if he had been placed in a difficult position. Nevertheless, he shot a few looks at the location where the Thousand Leaves Sect disciples were seated before shaking his head slightly.

However, no one knew what Qiu Yu said next, as the steward seemed to agree to his request while keeping the ugly expression on his face.

After an instant, the steward arrived before the Thousand Leaves Sect disciples, cupped his hands and said, “Honoured guests, due to the many matters that needed to be dealt with today, our subordinates seemed to have been somewhat negligent and issued you all the wrong seats. Please follow this old man to your correct seats and forgive us for our negligence in this matter.”

Du Xian and Ye Jing Han gawked in response to his words, as they did not know what the hell this steward was talking about.

On the contrary, Yang Kai grinned meaningfully and cupped his hands towards the steward, “Many thanks!”

After giving his thanks, he shot a look at Ye Jing Han and the others.

Although everyone was baffled by the development of events, they still proceeded to stand up. Under the guidance of the steward, they headed towards the empty table at the foremost position in the inner hall, before taking their seats at the new table.

After making sure everything was fine, the steward left.

It was only then that Ye Jing Han turned around, looked at Yang Kai, and asked, “Young Master Yang, what exactly did you say to Qiu Yu?”

She knew that with Thousand Leaves Sect’s current level of strength, as well as their relationship with Sky Crane City, it was impossible for them to receive such a level of treatment. The only plausible explanation was the secret exchange Yang Kai had with Qiu Yu.

After all, once he left, Qiu Yu went to find that steward to immediately get their seats changed.

Du Xian and the others also had inquisitive looks on their faces as they stared at Yang Kai, waiting in anticipation for his reply.

Yang Kai broke out a smile, “It’s nothing much. I simply told Brother Qiu that we felt like old friends the moment we met and he felt that the City Lord’s Mansion was too negligent in their treatment of you all, so he took the initiative to raise the request to get your seats changed.”

Obviously, no one was going to buy that.

Ye Jing Han snapped, “As if I’m going to believe that!”

Yang Kai simply replied innocently, “Brother Qiu’s a pretty good person.”

The series of abnormal activities had caught the eyes of quite a few guests, as they quietly felt shock in response to the outcome; after all, everyone had some level of understanding towards the relationship between Thousand Leaves Sect and Sky Crane City. As such, it was unavoidable that even a small matter like the sudden changing of seats to the foremost dining table would cause suspicion and doubt to surface in people’s hearts. People started to secretly guess that Thousand Leaves Sect and Sky Crane City had set their grievances aside. If that was really the case, they might have to re-evaluate whether or not they should patch up their relationship with Thousand Leaves Sect as well.

The atmosphere within the inner hall turned weird in an instant.

The Thousand Leaves Sect disciples were also unable to sit in peace as they were constantly sensing peculiar gazes being shot at them, causing discomfort to run through their whole bodies.

As time gradually went by, the empty seats in the inner hall were gradually filled by the incoming guests, slowly restoring the lively bustling atmosphere originally present.

All of a sudden, someone announced in a loud voice, “The City Lord had arrived!”

Right as those words rang out, the entire inner hall turned silent, as everyone turned their eyes in the same direction.

The first thing they saw was a man dressed in large red robes. Striding over, a joyous smile was plastered on his face as he proceeded to cup hands towards everyone around him.

“Sir City Lord!”

“It has been a while! City Lord, your bearing has grown even more graceful!”

“Congratulations to Sir City Lord for marrying a beautiful lady! You’re the role model for my generation!”

“On this joyous occasion, I wish Sir City Lord good health, a prosperous journey in your Martial Dao, an endless chain of heirs, and a family lasting through eternity!”

...

Congratulatory words from guests streamed in from all directions, smiles plastered on all of their faces as they did their utmost to flatter the City Lord.

The man dressed in elegant red robes also continued to exchange greetings with them, the smile on his face appearing exceedingly carefree and filled with delight.

“Is that Luo Jin?” Yang Kai stared with his eyes wide open as he whispered towards Ye Jing Han.

With a gloomy expression on her face, Ye Jing Han nodded, “That’s the man himself!”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, “If you didn’t confirm it, I would have assumed he was Luo Jin’s father...”

This was the first time Yang Kai had seen the Sky Crane City’s City Lord. Originally, from his knowledge that this fellow had fifteen concubines, Yang Kai assumed that the City Lord would definitely be maintaining a youthful appearance, brimming with energy and vigour. Even with a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation, he definitely wouldn’t have an old and withered appearance.

However, the man he saw today was elderly looking with white hair that grew sparsely from his head. Although he possessed an impressive cultivation, his vitality appeared superficial. Clearly, he had already passed the prime of his life, with no hope of ever reaching the Emperor Realm.

The loose red robes he wore further emphasized his age.

“Whoever this lady is, she must be truly blind!” Wu Ma couldn’t stop himself from shaking his head, as he felt mournful for the lady who was going to get married to Luo Jin today.

“Shut up! Don’t let your words get you into trouble!” Du Xuan shot a fierce glare at Wu Ma and whispered, “Did any of Luo Jin’s concubines willingly get married to him? As if you don’t know about that!”

Wu Ma snorted, “It’s due to his evil ways of oppressing people and seizing women that led to him having no offspring. One will always receive the seed of karma that they sow! The Heavenly Way is just!”

“And you’re still talking!?”

Wu Ma pursed his lip, “Okay, okay. I’ll shut up.”

The entire venue was bustling with liveliness, filled with a festive atmosphere.

This lasted for quite a while before a loud voice rang out, “The auspicious hour has arrived!”

In an instant, the sound of wind instruments rang out in all directions, accompanied by gongs and drums that shook the Heavens; it seemed as though they wanted to blow off the roof of this inner hall.

Luo Jin’s face radiated with a reddish glow as he tied his robes and looked towards the outside of the hall with a smile on his face.

Festive music started to play from the outside. As the music played on, the concubine escort group gradually appeared before everyone’s eyes, with a female matchmaker walking in the front. Gyrating her tub-like waist, a nauseatingly sweet smile hung on her face. Present by her side was a bridal sedan carried by four people as she slowly headed towards the inner hall, all while doing her utmost to display the result of her abilities.

The bridal boy and girl followed behind the bridal sedan, sprinkling flower petals from the baskets held in their hands.

Flower petals trailed behind the bridal sedan, causing the fragrance of flowers to perfuse throughout the air.

Following behind the flower petal sprinkling boy and girl were two columns of little boys and girls who held lanterns in their hands. The lanterns they held had various auspicious words like “May you live a long and happy life together” and “May your marriage last long”.

The procession took the time one would take to drink a cup of tea to travel several dozen metres, before the bridal sedan finally arrived at the entrance of the inner hall.

“Lower the sedan!” A loud voice rang out, before the bridal sedan proceeded to lower steadily.

The matchmaker went forward, pushed aside the drapes, and extended a hand into the sedan. In the next moment, a white and soft hand peeked out from within.

Just the sight of this hand was enough to cause the eyes of quite a few men to light up.

That jade white hand was perfect and devoid of blemishes, her skin as pure as snow. Just the sight of her delicate skin was enough to make people become lost in wild and fanciful thoughts, that the owner of that jade white hand would definitely be exceedingly beautiful and enchanting. However, this person just so happened to be Luo Jin’s future fifteenth concubine, causing people to wring their hands and lament in envy and jealousy.

This was followed up by an elegant red embroidered shoe. Landing on the red carpet at the front of the door, a dazzlingly beautiful figure was imprinted in the eyes of everyone present.

The new bride wore a phoenix coronet with a red veil covering her face. Brilliant phoenixes in flight were embroidered on her gown, while the gem-laden phoenix coronet and red veil obscured the face that made people become lost in wild and fanciful thoughts.

At this moment, countless people were cursing out in their hearts.

This couldn’t be helped, as the phoenix coronet and red veil that the new bride wore over her head unexpectedly had the ability to block off the intrusion of Divine Sense! It was impressively an extraordinary artifact!

All of the cultivators who had secretly sent out their Divine Sense to take a peek at the face of this new bride were blocked by an invisible barrier, leaving them utterly incapable of uncovering what her face really looked like.

Seemingly aware of the ideas the crowd would have, Luo Jin shot a gaze towards his left and right as a silent warming, before giving a satisfied faint smile in response.

Right at this moment, Yang Kai’s mouth twitched fiercely.

Unlike the others present, if he had forcefully sent his Divine Sense out, he might be able to break through the artifact’s barrier and catch a glimpse of the bride’s true appearance; however, with this being a marriage ceremony, doing so would definitely attract attention and would cause unnecessary trouble for him.

Therefore, after his first attempt, he did not try it again, choosing to quietly spectate the ceremony.

At this moment, under the guidance and assistance from the matchmaker, the new bride took step after step towards the inner hall.

Although her face could not be seen, the outline of her figure faintly visible beneath her bridal gown had revealed her stunning body line, one that was brimming with grace and elegance.

Yang Kai continued to size this woman up, before a frown suddenly appeared on his face, as though he felt that something wasn’t quite right. Nevertheless, he wasn’t able to identify exactly what gave him this feeling.

More importantly, the heart palpitations and jitters he had felt yesterday had surfaced abruptly once again, causing his frown to deepen.

He turned his head around to look at Ye Jing Han and the others, only to see not a single reaction from them.

However, the spectacle happening before them seemed to have caused some kind of desire to surge out from the depths of Ye Jing Han’s heart. Looking at the new bride taking step after step forward, a look of anticipation gleamed across her beautiful eyes, as though she was imagining the day when she would be able to wear that phoenix coronet and red veil, and get married to her beloved.

She sneaked a look at Du Xian, while her small face turned slightly flushed.

Not long after, the procession group finally arrived at the head of the inner hall. Handing the new bride’s hand to Luo Jin, the matchmaker said with a smile, “Sir, I’ll hand the new bride to you. Make sure to take good care of her, okay?”

With a hearty chuckle, Luo Jin replied, “I definitely won’t let her be shamed.”

The matchmaker replied, “The new bride is so blessed! Why is my life so unfortunate, to never meet a male like Sir!?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The people in the inner hall burst into laughter, instantly raising the atmosphere within.

Silavin, I mean... it obviously has something to do with your appearance right?
