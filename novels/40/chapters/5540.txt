Chapter 5541: The Little Ones

 

When the five Territory Lords in the distance unleashed their attacks, the Heavens shuddered and the Earth shook. Everybody aboard the Warship immediately noticed the commotion and turned to look in that direction.

 

Among the five youths was a young man dressed in all-white clothes. Even his hair was snow white. His expression became solemn, “A Master from the Black Ink Clan is attacking somebody. Moreover, this aura… It’s a Territory Lord!”

 

Standing next to him was a young woman. She was also dressed in white, but her hair was black. She nodded at his words, “More than one at that. I believe there are at least three of them, possibly even more.”

 

The black-haired young woman had a sweet appearance that was somewhat similar to Yang Kai’s.

 

“Were the whereabouts of a roaming Hunter exposed?” Among the five youths, a simple-looking young man approached the side of the Warship with a vague look of worry on his face.

 

Over the past few days, the whereabouts of several Hunters hidden in the vicinity had been exposed. The exposure of their whereabouts had naturally attracted the pursuit of the Black Ink Clan; however, the strongest among those Black Ink Clansmen were mere Feudal Lords. Although the people aboard this Warship had rescued many Hunters from the grasp of the Black Ink Clan recently, it was their first time seeing a Territory Lord here, not to mention that there was more than one.

 

“It will be difficult for them to escape seeing as a Territory Lord is personally attacking them,” standing beside the simple-looking young man was a woman with a cold and sharp expression, making her seem extremely unapproachable. It was only when her gaze landed on the simple-looking young man that a glimmer of warmth entered her eyes.

 

“Should we rescue them?” Out of the five young people, the last person was a young man with bowl cut and an eager expression, “We’ve never fought a Territory Lord. Eldest Senior Brother, let’s go save them!” His last sentence was directed at the simple-looking young man.

 

The small Stone Man who had been staring into the void in boredom all this while suddenly leapt up and climbed to the top of the bowl-cut young man’s head. Hammering his chest with his fists, he let out a battle cry. He was clearly very excited, and his fighting spirit was overflowing.

 

“Let’s save them!” The simple-looking young man announced with a determined expression, “Senior Bi Xi, turn around! We’re going to rescue them!”

 

Of course, Bi Xi’s Soul Clone ignored the simple-looking young man as he scoffed to himself, [Your Honoured Master is there, why would he need you to save him? We should leave Acacia Territory as soon as possible before he discovers the situation here. If he learns that the little ones are here, this Old Master will be in trouble.]

 

He thus remained unmoved by their pleas.

 

Seeing that Bi Xi’s Soul Clone not only showed no interest in rescuing those people but was also moving further and further away instead, the simple-looking young man quickly yelled, “Senior Bi Xi, it’s not this way! The other way!”

 

While the simple-looking young man was yelling at Bi Xi’s Soul Clone, the cold and arrogant young woman simply leapt off the Warship and sped towards the direction of the commotion.

 

The bowl-head young man immediately panicked and shouted, “Wait for me, Second Senior Sister!”

 

Then, he chased after the young woman, his speed quite extraordinary. The small Stone Man tried to grab at the bowl-headed young man’s hair to steady himself, but there wasn’t much to cling onto. With no other choice, he held onto the youth’s ears instead to prevent himself from being thrown off.

 

“Don’t be reckless!” The simple-looking young man hastily yelled after them; however, his Junior Brother and Junior Sister had already flown off into the distance. With a frustrated grunt, he hurriedly gave chase.

 

“Little Aunt, let’s go!” The white-haired young man dressed in white shouted. Then, he floated off the Warship hand in hand with the young woman beside him.

 

The Ominous Beast that had been resting with its eyes closed abruptly stood up while the little girl who was stroking his fur immediately got on his back. In the next moment, flames appeared at the feet of the Ominous Beast and he leapt into the void without hesitation.

 

Before leaving, the little girl did not forget to reach out and grab the pair of children to bring them along.

 

In the blink of an eye, there was nobody left on the Bi Xi Battleship.

 

“I… You…”

 

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone was desperate to cry, but was unable to shed any tears. He had planned to sneak the little ones back to the Territory Gate and quietly leave Acacia Territory as soon as possible. Who could have known the little ones would be so reckless?

 

[This is bad! This is bad! I knew I should never have brought them out of the Star Boundary!] He deeply regretted being so indulgent towards them and believing in their promises of just coming out to see a bit of the world. Look at the situation now! They had deserted him and left him alone in the void.

 

He couldn’t help feeling extremely worried about them, so with no other choice, he quickly turned around and chased after the little ones. While chasing after them, he sent a transmission to his other Soul Clone, “How is the situation on your side? Why did you suddenly start fighting?”

The other party replied, “We encountered five Territory Lords, but it’s nothing to worry about!”

 

He was shocked by the response and asked, “Five Territory Lords!? How is that nothing to worry about!? Hurry up and hide! The Territory Lords are not to be trifled with. Not to mention, they are Innate Territory Lords. Every one of them is comparable to a peak Eighth-Order Master in strength.”

 

“No need to worry, it’s just five trivial Territory Lords after all!”

 

Those words stunned him as he secretly thought to himself, [I don’t have the habit of boasting. What is with my other Soul Clone? There are five Territory Lords! How is that trivial?]

 

From the way the other party was talking, he did not seem to think much of the five Territory Lords. It had to be said that even Bi Xi’s true body could only handle one Territory Lord at a time. If two Territory Lords were to cooperate against him, he would surely be at a serious disadvantage. Needless to say, Bi Xi had an extraordinary defensive strength, so while he might not be able to defeat two Territory Lords, protecting himself wouldn’t be a problem.

 

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone had no time to ponder on the issue though, so he could only inform the other party, “The little ones have gone there. Don’t let anything happen to them.”

 

The other side inquired, “How many little ones came?”

 

He sighed and helplessly said, “Yang Xiao, Yang Xue, Yang Kai’s three Disciples, Xiao Xiao, Qiong Qi, Liu Yan, Xiao Hong, and even Xiao Hei.”

 

The other side was clearly shocked, “Did all of them come here?”

 

These were all the little ones who were left behind in the Star Boundary.

 

He helplessly replied, “I know. If anything were to happen to them, we won’t have any way to explain the situation to Yang Kai… Ha…”

 

The little ones had charged forward, so they were bound to run into Yang Kai; therefore, Yang Kai would surely question the reason they were in Acacia Territory. How was he supposed to explain the situation once that happened?

 

The more Bi Xi’s Soul Clone thought about the situation, the wearier he became. He was such an old man, yet he had to take care of the children of others. The most important point was that he failed to take good care of them.

 

However, his other self clearly did not have such reservations and became excited instead, “Great timing. Tell them not to expose their whereabouts. We might need their help to kill these Territory Lords.”

 

He exclaimed in astonishment, “Kill the Territory Lords?”

 

[When did my other Soul Clone pick up such a terrible habit? Who did he learn it from?]

 

Although the little ones were undeniably strong, even if all of them worked together, they could only handle one Territory Lord at most. However, the enemy was five Territory Lords! It was only natural to flee as fast as possible when faced with this many overwhelming enemies.

 

“En. We’re going to kill these Territory Lords! Just trust me,” The other Soul Clone sounded confident and calm.

 

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone was at a loss for words. They were both Soul Clones of the true body, so there was no differentiating between them in terms of sense or strength, so he could not figure out the reason for the other Soul Clone’s confidence.

 

Now that things had reached this point though, he could only choose to trust in the other party… which was himself.

 

As for how to call the little ones back… That was simple. They did not know that the commotion ahead was caused by Yang Kai and simply assumed that one of the Hunter Squads had been exposed. As long as he told them the truth, they would come back immediately.

 

To prevent them from exposing their whereabouts, he quickly sent a Divine Sense transmission and sure enough, the figures charging forward hastily came to a stop and returned to the Warship.

 

The white-haired Yang Xiao who was dressed in all white exclaimed in astonishment, “Senior Bi Xi, is Adoptive Father really up ahead?”

 

The honest-looking Zhao Ye Bai was extremely excited, “Is it really Honoured Master?”

 

Although the others did not ask any questions, their eyes were filled with pleasant surprise and anticipation.

 

“That’s right. Yang Kai is there. The Territory Lords are chasing him,” Bi Xi’s Soul Clone replied.

 

The cold and arrogant Zhao Ya immediately summoned a long spear. Her long hair flew in the wind as her murderous intent flared, “Bold! I must go assist Honoured Master!”

 

Xiao Xiao, who was standing on top of Xu Yi’s head, also became impatient. He jumped up and down on top of Xu Yi’s head, causing the latter to become somewhat dizzy as a result.

 

Seeing that Zhao Ya was about to rush off again, Bi Xi’s Soul Clone hurriedly called out, “Calm down. Yang Kai does not want you to expose your whereabouts yet. He might need your help to kill the enemies later!”

 

Those were the words of the other Soul Clone. It was just that he was not in the position to explain too much under the current circumstances, so he simply took those words as Yang Kai’s. In any case, he believed that his other Soul Clone would inform Yang Kai about the situation and then get back to him.

 

Zhao Ya did not dare to disobey the orders of her Honoured Master, so after hearing those words, she slowly withdrew her murderous intent and turned to look into the distance. It felt as though the commotion in that direction was getting bigger and bigger.

 

Liu Yan, who was riding on top of Qiong Qi, frowned and asked, “Senior Bi Xi, although Master has reached the Eighth Order, there are quite a lot of Territory Lords there. Can he… handle them all?”

 

They knew that Yang Kai had become an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; after all, he previously stopped to visit Bi Xi’s true body on his way back from the Black Ink Battlefield.

 

Afterwards, the news spread to the people of the Star Boundary when Bi Xi’s true body retreated there with the cultivators from Void Land.

 

What they did not know was Yang Kai’s feats over the last several dozen years, including his battle record of killing three Territory Lords in Profound Nether Territory. It had not been long since that incident took place. Besides, the Hunters were scattered across the various Great Territories which made it difficult to keep up with the latest news.

 

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone coughed lightly, “Don’t you know the strength of your Master? Judging by what he said, I’m sure he has his means.”

 

Liu Yan considered for a moment before agreeing. Since her Master was acting in such a manner, then he must have his own reasons. There was no need for her to overthink the situation, she only needed to obey his orders.

 

The whole group immediately calmed down while Bi Xi’s Soul Clone exhaled a sigh of relief, [Thank goodness I managed to fool them for now. As for what happens after this… That’s not up to me anymore.]

 

Activating a Secret Technique, he concealed his aura and secretly moved forward.

 

Bi Xi not only had an outstanding defence, but his ability to conceal his aura was also unmatched. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for so many Masters to fail at detecting his presence despite passing by Void Land for so many years. It was not until Yang Kai took over Void Land and Zhu Jiu Yin went on a rampage that the sleeping Bi Xi awakened and made his presence known.

 

One of the reasons why this group of youths could leisurely wander around the various Great Territories for so many years was undeniably thanks to their outstanding strength, but the other reason was that they had Bi Xi’s protection.

 

After killing Black Ink Clansmen, they would only need to hide deep within the void. Even if the Black Ink Clan mobilised a large force to search the area, they would have a hard time locating a lone Warship.

 

At the same time, far off in the void ahead, Dawning Light and the Bi Xi Battleship carrying Yu Ru Meng and the others were being bombarded indiscriminately by the Territory Lords.

 

Fortunately, both Dawning Light and the Bi Xi Battleship had extraordinary defensive capabilities. As long as they did not suffer an endless barrage of attacks from the Territory Lords at close range, they would be fine for some time.

 

Bi Xi’s Soul Clone avoided the attacks from the pursuing Territory Lords while at the same time, he sent a secret Divine Sense transmission to Yang Kai and told the other party about the situation on the other side.
