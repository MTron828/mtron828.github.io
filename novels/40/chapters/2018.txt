Gong Sun Mu had a prominent identity in his day, so even his servants would have impressive strength. After being driven away by Gong Sun Mu, this servant lived in seclusion in the Southern Territory, married a wife, and had children, creating his own family.

Unfortunately, as the generations passed, his descendants’ aptitude was somewhat unremarkable and the family eventually declined.

A hundred years ago, only one heir to the family remained. That heir, by chance, was rescued by Kang Si Ran when he was being hunted down by his enemies, but unfortunately, he suffered severe injuries from which he could not recover.

Before his death, that heir, out of gratitude, informed Kang Si Ran about his family’s greatest secret.

This was also the reason why Kang Si Ran was able to obtain such intimate information about Gong Sun Mu’s hidden cave mansion.

As Yang Kai listened, most of his doubts were assuaged.

Having gotten to know Kang Si Ran over the past two months, Yang Kai felt that he was a good person, not a villain, and saw no reason for Kang Si Ran to deceive him here. Secondly, Yang Kai knew that such opportunities and coincidences truly occurred in this world as he had experienced several himself.

After mulling the information for a while, Yang Kai spoke, “If it is truly the cave mansion of Gong Sun Mu, exploring it really would be a great opportunity, but in that case... Why is Shopkeeper Kang coming to me with this offer? Your chamber of commerce is full of talents who are far stronger than I, why not ask them for assistance and improve the odds of success?”

Kang Si Ran chuckled, “What Alchemist Yang says is reasonable, the headquarters of my chamber of commerce is indeed full of talented individuals, with countless Dao Source Realm masters as well. If this old master invited them to participate, the chances of success and safety would be much improved, but then... how many benefits would this old master obtain? Alchemist Yang must know that this is a private action, unrelated to the chamber of commerce. If the masters from headquarters were to learn about such a golden opportunity, this old master most likely would not even obtain some leftover soup. In order to carry out this plan, this old master has been searching for a reliable partner with similar strength, please understand this, Alchemist Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, “I understand Shopkeeper Kang’s concerns.”

“Alchemist Yang is considerate, it is truly this old master’s good fortune to have met him. Now, about Alchemist Yang. After hearing this much...”

Yang Kai smiled, “Since it is related to an Alchemy Grandmaster like Gong Sun Mu, I am very interested in participating.”

Kang Si Ran was overjoyed and nodded, “Very good! However, this old master must make something clear.”

“Shopkeeper Kang, please speak!”

Kang Si Ran wore a serious look and said, “If there is a Dao Source Pill inside the cave mansion, this old master has the first rights to it!”

“Alright,” Yang Kai didn’t even think about it and readily agreed.

Kang Si Ran was startled seeing Yang Kai agree so quickly, a trace of gratitude appearing on his face, “Many thanks for Alchemist Yang’s understanding. This old master knows that his aptitude is low, and without something like a Dao Source Pill, he will never reach the Dao Source Realm, but just how rare are Dao Source Pills? When the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda was opened this time, this old master did not even hear rumours about the appearance of those three Dao Source Fruits. If not, this old master would not be in a rush to explore that hidden cave mansion. But Alchemist Yang may rest assured, regardless of whether there is Dao Source Pill in there or not, all materials related to Alchemy will belong to Alchemist Yang, as for other things, you and I can discuss the distribution when the time comes.”

“That’s fine,” Yang Kai nodded, “When will we leave?”

“Tentatively, after one month. One month from today, this old master will be waiting for Alchemist Yang at the pill shop. This old master has to make some preparations and in addition, there will be an auction soon in the city, so this old master wants to join in the fun and see if he can gain something good. I wonder if Alchemist Yang is interested in participating?” Kang Si Ran asked.

“There’s going to be an auction held in the city?” Yang Kai was startled.

“Yeah,” Kang Si Ran chuckled, “This time, Maplewood City’s cultivators obtained many good things from the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, so Sir City Lord plans to host an auction where everyone could exchange some of the rarer treasures they acquired but do not need. Perhaps in this auction, this old master will even see a Dao Source Fruit. Alchemist Yang is now a Third-Order Origin King, so wouldn’t now be a good time to prepare a Dao Source Pill?”

“Indeed. When and where will this auction be held?” Yang Kai asked.

...

After half an hour, Yang Kai walked out of Spirit Pill Plaza.

Regarding the auction, Yang Kai did not say he would certainly attend, only telling Kang Si Ran that if he had time, he would go and join in the fun. Kang Si Ran of course made no objections.

After leaving Spirit Pill Plaza, Yang Kai thought for a while before turning towards a certain direction and heading out of the city instead of returning to his secluded home.

A short while later, outside Maplewood City, Yang Kai adjusted his bearings before flying due north.

At a location about thirty kilometres away from Maplewood City, there was a manor-like complex filled with houses and buildings covering a vast area. There were small bridges built of pristine rivers, making for a peaceful and elegant environment.

Yang Kai flew down and swept the manor with his Divine Sense for a moment as he muttered, “It should be here.”

The reason why he came to this place was naturally to fulfill his previous agreement with the man named Zhang Gao Xuan he had encountered in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. The Zhang Family was also a somewhat famous family in Maplewood City, so after just a few inquiries, Yang Kai had found where it was located.

The Zhang Family’s foundation was not located inside Maplewood City, but outside Maplewood City. After all, a bit of land inside Maplewood City was worth an immense sum of money, and even building a simple house would be a great expense. Outside the city was different though, and although the World Energy would not be as abundant, that was not a problem for a small family.

Yang Kai glanced around and immediately understood that someone from the Zhang Family should have a little understanding of Spirit Arrays, as there were some simple ones arranged around the manor to gather World Energy.

Having received a Dao Source Fruit from the Zhang Family Patriarch, Zhang Gao Xuan, Yang Kai had a reason to come here and have a look while at the same time deliver Zhang Gao Xuan’s other possessions and final words.

He had been busy until now, so his visit had been slightly delayed.

When he arrived at the front entrance, Yang Kai prepared to call out, but before he could even say a word, two streams of light shot out from the inside of the complex.

Behind these two streams of light, two figures also rushed out, each one tightly gripping their fists, their eyes bloodshot and red, as if they had some kind of absolutely irreconcilable hatred with Yang Kai and their only wish was to kill him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Yang Kai was stunned.

However, he did not put the attacks of the other party in his eyes as these two were just a Second-Order and First-Order Origin Returning Realm. Even if both used their full strength, how could they possibly harm Yang Kai?

So, he simply stood in place and waved his hand lightly.

With that wave, the two streams of light that had shot towards him shattered.

Seeing this, the two people who had rushed out froze in place, but soon, a grim look filled their faces as they used some kind of Secret Technique, coughed up mouthfuls of Blood Essence, and forced their auras to rapidly inflate.

Yang Kai’s brows suddenly wrinkled, and without waiting for these two people to summon their artifacts, he casually released his Domain.

In that instant, the two attackers felt as if mountains had been placed on their backs, causing them to go stiff, unable to move. However, this did nothing to diminish the anger on their faces as they continued to glare at Yang Kai hatefully, fire nearly spewing from their eyes.

“Is this the Zhang Family?” Yang Kai maintained the power of Domain, suppressing the two, and asked faintly.

The pair were both male and seemed to be about thirty years old. One was fat while the other was thin. Hearing Yang Kai’s question, the fat man coldly snorted and snapped, “Why ask something you already know? If you are here to kill, just kill, why bother with so much nonsense!”

Although the thinner man did not speak, the stern look that came out of his eyes clearly indicated his attitude.

“Has something happened to the Zhang Family?” Yang Kai was no fool, so seeing these two’s attitude, he had a faint guess about what had transpired, causing him to frown.

“You sure like running your mouth! Since you are here to do the Lu Family’s dirty work, why bother acting pretentious?” The fat cultivator snapped with a look of contempt.

The thin man sneered, “Lu Bai Chuan is nothing but an old bastard, so the people he hires are naturally the same, why is Third Brother so surprised?”

The fat cultivator laughed, “You’re right, it was Third Brother’s mistake.”

As he spoke, he spat towards Yang Kai fiercely.

Yang Kai sighed, “I am afraid that the two of you are misunderstanding something. I don’t know any Lu Bai Chuan or Lu Family, I only fought back because you suddenly attacked me.”

“You don’t know that old dog Lu Bai Chuan? Then why have you come to meet the Zhang Family?”

At that moment, an aged voice suddenly called out from inside the manor and soon, an old woman with silver hair and a wooden walking staff stepped out with the help of a young girl.

Behind this old woman were a few other people.

The old woman had a face full of wrinkles and her complexion was clearly somewhat sallow, but her eyes still contained a sharp light as she stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept out and he immediately understood that this old woman was a First-Order Origin King, but it seemed she had suffered a serious wound recently that damaged her foundation, so her Saint Qi aura was somewhat disordered.

However, what puzzled Yang Kai was that the people who followed this old woman were all women, some middle-aged, some young, several of them even just little girls and young children.

The only males present were the fat and thin cultivators who had attacked him before.

It was like all the men in this family were dead except for the fat and thin pair.

Yang Kai waved his hand, dispersed his Domain, and freed his two assailants.

The two men also had some sense and understood that there was a massive gap in strength between them and Yang Kai, so they did not act rashly again and instead retreated to the old woman’s side, standing before her in a defensive stance as they stared at Yang Kai vigilantly.

“Junior Yang Kai greets old madam. Dare I ask if this is the Zhang Family?” Yang Kai cupped his fists politely.

“Yes, this is the Zhang Family,” The old woman replied in a deep voice while supporting herself with her cane.

“Good,” Yang Kai smiled slightly and pondered before asking, “Old madam, is there some kind of misunderstanding here? Why was I sneak attacked the moment I arrived?”

“Misunderstanding?” The old woman sneered, “Whether it is a misunderstanding or not depends on what business you have here. You say you don’t know Old Dog Lu Bai Chuan?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “I’ve never heard of him.”
