Chapter 935, Bite

During the Inheritance War, everyone who followed Yang Kai obtained great benefits. Little Senior Sister Xia Ning Chang had used the Myriad Drug Liquid and a large number of medicinal herbs to create a pool of medicinal liquid which cleansed their bodies and improved everyone’s aptitude by varying degrees.

Huo Xing Chen, Qiu Yi Meng and other important people obtained even greater benefits than this.

It could be said that their future achievements were guaranteed to not be low; even if they remained in the Central Capital for the rest of their lives, breaking through to the Transcendent Realm was a certainty.

After ten odd years, Qiu Yi Meng had already reached the Peak Immortal Ascension Boundary, but Huo Xing Chen was still stuck at the Sixth Stage, greatly surprising Yang Kai.

He couldn’t understand why Hou Xing Chen’s cultivation had fallen behind so much.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, many people inside the Yang Family Elder Hall couldn’t help chuckling, revealing knowing looks.

Even Qiu Yi Meng had to cover her mouth in order to stifle her laughter.

Huo Xing Chen’s face instantly became bitter as he helplessly complained, “Young Lord Kai, you don’t know how much misfortune has befallen me...”

Saying so, he began telling his story.

As he silently listened, Yang Kai’s expression became more and more awkward.

The Huo Family was one of the Central Capital’s Eight Great Families, but the previous generation’s Patriarch, Huo Zheng, only had one son, Huo Xing Chen, while on the other hand, he had a great many daughters who he treated as treasures, taking care of them in every possible way.

After Huo Xing Chen assumed the position of Patriarch, the Huo Family Elders, having learned a painful lesson from the previous generation’s Patriarch, immediately began arranging marriages for Huo Xing Chen to ensure he fathered a large number of descendants.

Over the past decade, the Huo Family had added more than a dozen women to Huo Xing Chen’s harem, and under the intimidation of the Elders, Hou Xing Chen had diligently fulfilled his duty to expand the Huo Family.

Having to satisfy so many ‘demands’ had consumed Huo Xing Chen’s time and stamina greatly, so it was only natural his cultivation had not advanced.

“Haa... if I count them all, this Young Lord had a full fifteens concubines and wives,” Huo Xing Chen stared at Yang Kai, his face filled with a look of suffering as he grabbed his shoulders and sobbed, “If some day there is a chance, I’ll introduce them to you. Although each of them is a rare beauty, facing their combined might, this Young Master is really incapable of fighting back.”

Yang Kai looked at him with sympathy but didn’t know what to say, thinking about it for a long time before finally muttering, “My condolences...”

Inside the hall, everyone burst into laughter.

It seemed that the news of Yang Kai’s return had already spread out. Immediately after Qiu Yi Meng and Huo Xing Chen arrived, the other young Patriarchs of the Eight Great Families appeared.

Meng Family Patriarch Meng Shan Yi, Liu Family Patriarch Liu Qing Yao, Kang Family Patriarch Kang Jian, Gao Family Patriarch Gao Ren Xian, Ye Family Patriarch Ye Jing Li...

Of these five people, Yang Kai was only somewhat familiar with Meng Shan Yi and Liu Qing Yao. The other three he had barely even spoken to before.

All of them had come together after hearing that Yang Kai had returned and swept away all the Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple invaders, wanting to inquire about what was to happen next.

Upon learning that Yang Kai wanted to bring the Yang Family away from the Central Capital and take them to Tong Xuan Realm, the five young Patriarchs couldn’t immediately make a decision.

Relocating their entire family was not something they could decide at will.

They also had other concerns.

During the Inheritance War, the Huo Family and Qiu Family were by far the closest to Yang Kai, with Qiu Yi Meng and Huo Xing Chen having assisted him directly. Them following Yang Kai was a given, but the other five had mostly fought against Yang Kai in the past. Now that circumstances had changed so dramatically, they weren’t certain how to position themselves.

Yang Kai extended an invitation to them casually, asking them to join him in Tong Xuan Realm.

As for what had transpired between them in the past, Yang Kai had long ago stopped caring about it. These five were also people from his homeland and helping them required very little effort for the current Yang Kai, so he didn’t hesitate to ask.

However, all five young Patriarchs said they needed to go back and negotiate with their family’s Elders before making a decision.

After these five left, before they could have a moment of calm, a steady stream of people began arriving.

All of these visitors were friends of Yang Kai who had participated in the Inheritance War.

Han Xiao Qi, Ye Han, Liu Qing Ru, and Hua Ruo Yin of Ten Thousand Flower Palace.

Feng Qian Hen of Water Moon Hall.

Zuo Fang, Li Xin Yuan of Pure Heart Palace.

Reflecting Moon Sect’s Chen Xue Shu and Su Xiao Yu.

Treasure Instrument Sect Tao Yang and Zhao Rong.

Leng Shan, Chen Yi, and Chen Ying of Ghost King Valley...

These people had all been helping to rebuild the Central Capital after Yang Kai left, causing the Yang Family to feel quite grateful and fostering close ties with each of their respective Sects. Each of them had mutually taken care of the others these past ten years and eventually, the young leaders who had been among the first ones to support Yang Kai were chosen as representatives of their respective Sects to the Yang Family and thus remained in the Central Capital all this time.

Fortunately, during the most recent disaster, none of them had suffered tragedy, all of them managing to survive.

With so many old friends meeting, the atmosphere became jubilant, the four Ten Thousand Flower Palace girls had even matured into great beauties, adding a layer of colour to the scene. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After enthusiastically exchanging greetings, Yang Kai told them about his future plans, all of them saying they would immediately return to their Sects to inform their Elders.

After they left, Yang Kai said, “Second Brother, you discuss with the Elders whether you plan to follow me or not. Please give me a reply as soon as possible though as I won’t be able to stay here for too long.”

“There’s no need to discuss anything, Ninth Brother. Since you’ve already arranged everything, the Yang Family will naturally follow you,” Yang Zhao readily agreed.

Everyone else also nodded, not a single objection being raised, the Blood Warriors all showing excited looks, openly displaying their happiness that they would be able to follow their Little Lord once more.

“Good, then have everyone pack their things, tell them to only take with them their most precious possessions. As for any cultivation materials or resources, you can leave them behind, they won’t be worth anything in Tong Xuan Realm,” Yang Kai urged them before turning his eyes to Qiu Yi Meng and Huo Xing Chen.

The Huo Family Young Lord quickly stated, “Whatever Qiu Yi Meng decides to do I will follow along with, her vision is far better than mine.”

“I must bring the Qiu Family to Tong Xuan Realm,” Qiu Yi Meng stated decisively as she shot him a glance.

Huo Xing Chen shrugged his shoulders, “Then I’ll go back and inform my old man and let our people hurry up and pack.”

Saying so, he quickly left.

“We will also get to work,” Yang Zhao stood up and ordered to the rest of the Yang Family members in the hall, “Just as Ninth Brother said, only take with you what you cannot bear to part with, the rest can be left behind.”

“Yes!” Numerous people shouted and dispersed.

Inside the hall, only Yang Kai, Li Rong, Han Fei, Qiu Yi Meng, and Luo Xiao Man remained.

“Master, we’ll be waiting outside if you need us,” Li Rong pursed her lips and smiled before walking out with Han Fei. With her eyesight, how could she have not seen the way the young girl named Qiu Yi Meng looked at Yang Kai?

It was the look of a maiden that could not hide her longing and infatuation.

Her deliberately staying behind was obviously in order to see Yang Kai alone.

“Elder Sister Qiu, I’ll also go on ahead,” Luo Xiao Man whispered before quickly following after Li Rong and Han Fei.

Inside the Elder Hall, silence fell and the atmosphere became a bit tense as Qiu Yi Meng just stared at Yang Kai without saying a word.

Yang Kai finally broke the silence in a slightly embarrassed tone, “Seeing your current appearance, you don’t seem to have gotten married yet. You’re not young anymore.”

“I was waiting for you,” Qiu Yi Meng raised her eyes, revealing her long, slender white neck.

“Don’t joke with me,” Yang Kai let out a hollow laugh.

“Do you think I’m joking?” Qiu Yi Meng coldly snorted, suddenly grinding her teeth, “I know that there are other women in your heart, and I don’t expect you to like me back... Even I know that the current gap between us is too big. I have some self-awareness!”

Yang Kai could only stare back at her helplessly.

“But you rarely come back, so I need to clearly express myself. You said to me before... You will not speak about love to me but having fun is alright!”

“I really said such feral words?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“You did!” Qiu Yi Meng angrily bit her lip as she glared at him, “You realize now what an animal you were? I thought you were still ignorant!”

“Ah... er... That was all in the past, I was young and frivolous...”

“It doesn’t matter anymore. Since you want to play, then let’s play! I don’t expect to wait for you forever, I know that’s not realistic, I don’t want to spend every day suffering like this, I just hope that I can turn your head at least once.”

“Eh...” Yang Kai was dumbstruck by Qiu Yi Meng’s bold words, unable to even answer back.

“I don’t care what you think about me, but just you wait, after we arrive in Tong Xuan Realm and everything has calmed down, I’ll let you know how fierce I can be!” Saying so, Qiu Yi Meng’s tender body flashed, appearing right in front of Yang Kai and completely disregarding whether he was willing or not, stood on her tiptoes and pressed her lips against his.

In the next instant, Yang Kai let out a pitiful yelp as he stumbled back as felt a burning pain from his lips.

Qiu Yi Meng turned around gracefully and gradually drifted away, her silver bell-like laughter ringing through the air, “That’s just a little bit of interest, when we get to the other side I’ll find an opportunity to get the rest of it from you as well as the capital you owe me.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help staring dumbly.

After an incense stick worth of time, Yang Kai walked out of the hall with a blank expression.

Li Rong and Han Fei, who were waiting outside, glanced over at him, then quickly turned their eyes away, their shoulders trembling lightly as they desperately tried to stifle their laughter.

“Go on, laugh, haven’t you seen a woman bite before?” Yang Kai touched his lip helplessly, feeling he had no face left at all.

“That young lady is actually quite good,” Li Rong said in a serious manner, “If she had been born in Tong Xuan Realm, her cultivation would be much higher.”

“En, this world has fettered their development!” Han Fei also agreed.

“That’s why I want to take them away from here, so they can see a wider world;” Yang Kai said profoundly, “This world is too small. Although there are more dangers over there, the conditions are still far better.”

Both women nodded in agreement.

A moment later, Yang Kai ordered, “You two temporarily remain here in the Yang Family to guard this place in order to avoid any unexpected situations.”

Li Rong was startled, “Is Master going somewhere?”

“There are still two places I need to visit.”

“Then allow either Han Fei or myself to accompany you.”

“No need, I’ll be fine on my own, with the Flying Heavens Shuttle, I’ll be perfectly safe. No one can catch up with me, especially not in this world.”

Li Rong thought about it for a moment and didn’t insist on it, only saying, “Then Master must be careful.”

“Tell my parents that after I finish my errands I’ll have lots of time to accompany them,” Yang Kai said before summoning the Flying Heavens Shuttle and soaring off in a blue flash of light, disappearing across the horizon in the blink of an eye.

After gazing in the direction of his disappearance for a moment, Li Rong and Han Fei’s figures flickered and also disappeared, the two of them flying over to the Fourth Master’s house to accompany Yang Kai parents in his place.
