“This Human Race Army must be filled with elites with exceptional strength; otherwise, they wouldn’t have been able to ambush and kill the clansmen who broke through the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction. Furthermore, there is also a Divine Dragon on their side! If we want to go against such an Army, we can’t afford to send in too few Masters from our side, or we will just be sending them to their deaths. However, if we draw too many of our forces away from the front lines, how can we stabilize the situation on the various battlefields? The Humans will inevitably seize the opportunity to attack and break through our defences!”

Saying so, Mo Na Ye then looked at the Royal Lord and asked, “Do you know how many people are in that Army?”

“There shouldn’t be more than 10,000 in total, which isn’t a lot, but each individual is quite strong, especially those 400 Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters. Additionally, they seem to have a large-scale artifact similar to a Great Pass with them.”

“A Great Pass!” Mo Na Ye furrowed his brow, and the Territory Lords all became fearful.

Although all of the Great Passes that still survived were abandoned around the No-Return Pass and were now occupied by the Black Ink Clan, it had cost them a massive price to capture them. If it weren’t for the two Black Ink Giant Spirit Gods aiding them at the time, the Black Ink Clan would not have been able to conquer the No-Return Pass.

Now, with an elite Army stationed at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction and a Great Pass-like artifact assisting them, it was no wonder they had the confidence to open a gap in the Grand Restriction to alleviate the pressure.

Mo Na Ye couldn’t help but sigh deeply, “The Human’s heritage remains as powerful as ever…”

Just from the fact that the Humans were able to withdraw so many elites to the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction without any impact on the situation in the various battlefields was enough to prove that the Human Race of today was not the same as the one from 3,000 years ago.

After the war in the Barren Territory, the Human Race had sunk to its lowest point. The Great Territory Battlefields were all in a passive state of defence, and Profound Nether Territory was almost conquered by the Black Ink Clan. If it weren’t for Yang Kai’s sudden appearance at the critical moment, Profound Nether Territory would have fallen into the hands of the Black Ink Clan.

Yes, it was all because of Yang Kai…

Since Yang Kai appeared in Profound Nether Territory, the Human Race’s plight had gradually been reversed. How did he even manage to accomplish such things?

After careful observation, Mo Na Ye realised that Yang Kai didn’t do much. Although he had killed many Innate Territory Lords, it hadn’t significantly impacted the balance of power between the two Races. No matter how powerful he was, he was just a single individual and could not wipe out the entire Black Ink Clan.

The true root of the matter lay in the peace agreement between the two Races!

The constraints of the peace treaty had provided a relatively safe training space for the younger generation of the Human Race. While this alone might not seem significant, what was crucial was that the Human Race had the Star Boundary and the Myriad Monsters World, two Open Heaven Realm Cradles.

The combination of such a relatively stable cultivation environment and a continuous influx of talented successors had shaped the Human Race’s formidable heritage over thousands of years.

It was a pity that when Yang Kai’s reputation was at its peak, and all the Innate Territory Lords trembled at the mere mention of his name, he proposed the peace agreement.

Who would dare to reject him at that time?

Looking at the current situation, this was all Yang Kai’s cunning plan. Even if the Black Ink Clan had seen through it at the time though, they could only accept it.

Mo Na Ye also caught on at this point. He thus grew more afraid of and suspicious of Yang Kai since he not only possessed incredible combat power but also had a far-seeing perspective. He was a great threat to the Black Ink Clan.

The Black Ink Clan had naturally thought about how to deal with this issue and concluded that the best course of action would be to destroy the Star Boundary and the Myriad Monsters World, the places that contributed to the continuous enhancement of the Human Race’s heritage. They were just two trivial Universe Worlds. If given the chance, any Territory Lord or Eighth-Order Black Ink Disciple could easily deal with them.

However, the Black Ink Clan simply could not find the opportunity to do so as every soldier that had been recalled from the front lines had to pass through a Grand Array filled with Purifying Light. Even if a Black Ink Disciple had impure intentions, the Purifying Light would cleanse and dispel any Black Ink Strength within them.

Moreover, both the Star Boundary and the Myriad Monsters World had multiple powerful Masters stationed there all year round, standing guard…

The voice of the Royal Lord came through, bringing Mo Na Ye back to focus.

“This King has asked if they need support over there, but those within the Grand Restriction believe it would be unwise to cause a commotion. They are working on finding other ways through the Grand Restriction, and if they succeed, they will be able to break free.”

Mo Na Ye perked up and asked, “Can they do it?”

He knew firsthand just how formidable the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was. When he was inside it years ago, many Black Ink Clansmen had attempted to breach it from within, but all had failed.

The Royal Lord replied, “Since they’ve said as much, there should be some progress. Although we do not know who the person overseeing the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction is now, their strength is far inferior to Cang, so their control is obviously not as good either. Furthermore, opening a gap in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction has had some impact on its integrity, which may have provided some opportunities for those inside!”

Mo Na Ye nodded lightly. The Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction was extremely ancient and had been operating constantly for millions of years. The new Human Race Master overseeing it was not like the legendary Cang, a powerful monster with unfathomable experience. They couldn’t be fully prepared, and as long as there was even the slightest flaw, those within the Grand Restriction would not miss that chance!

Today, the Royal Lord summoned many of his Territory Lords to share the good news. He wasn’t worried about any Territory Lord leaking the information because the Black Ink Clan was not the same as the Human Race. If a Human was corrupted by Black Ink Strength, they would tell everything they knew to the Black Ink Clan, but the Black Ink Clan would never leak critical information to the Humans.

After a while, the Royal Lord left, and the rest quickly dispersed as well while Mo Na Ye walked away, frowning deep in thought.

He was thinking about none other than Yang Kai!

Over 100 years ago, Yang Kai led a group of Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters through the No-Return Pass and into the depths of the Black Ink Battlefield. There had been no news about him for all this time, and no one knew where he had gone or what he was up to.

If it were an ordinary Eighth-Order Master, Mo Na Ye wouldn’t have cared, but Yang Kai was different. Whatever the circumstances, Yang Kai had even killed a Pseudo-Royal Lord, which was enough to make Mo Na Ye take him seriously.

After thinking for a while, Mo Na Ye couldn’t come to a conclusion. Yang Kai’s whereabouts had always been elusive, and it seemed that even the Human side had difficulty keeping track of him.

He was once again relieved when he thought about how Yang Kai had no hope of reaching the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm. If this headache-inducing menace had a chance to ascend to the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm, how could they handle him?

“Sir Mo Na Ye!” A Territory Lord approached suddenly.

Mo Na Ye turned his head and saw one of his Territory Lords in charge of logistics. He nodded and asked, “What’s the matter?”

The Territory Lord replied, “Sir, several squads that were supposed to return with resources have not returned yet.”

This wasn’t a big deal, but since Mo Na Ye was in charge of everything related to the No-Return Pass by the Royal Lord’s orders, he still had to investigate all abnormal occurrences. The Territory Lords had also become accustomed to his meticulous style, so they would come to him with any matter, big or small.

“How long are they overdue?” Mo Na Ye frowned, feeling that something was off.

The Territory Lord replied, “The earliest squad was supposed to have returned a month ago, while the latest should have arrived at the No-Return Pass five days ago.”

“Have you sent anyone to investigate?”

“Yes, a team has been sent and we should receive a report in a few days.”

Mo Na Ye nodded, “Notify me the moment you have answers.”

“Yes!”

A few days later, the Feudal Lord in charge of gathering news sent a message to the No-Return Pass using his Black Ink Nest. The teams responsible for transporting materials had already set off for the No-Return Pass, but mysteriously disappeared halfway!

When the news reached Mo Na Ye, he immediately realised the problem.

The teams transporting resources disappeared without a trace, but the Human Race had no presence on the Black Ink Battlefield other than at the Grand Restriction. Over the years, the Black Ink Clan had been constantly mining resources from the Black Ink Battlefield and transporting them to the front lines without any issues; however, recently, several squads transporting resources disappeared for no reason!

[Someone must be causing trouble…] The first person that came to Mo Na Ye’s mind was Yang Kai.

Only Yang Kai could do such a thing. Considering that he had gone deep into the Black Ink Battlefield over 100 years ago and had not been seen since, it was almost certain that Yang Kai was now camping near the No-Return Pass, waiting for the Black Ink Clan’s resource teams to appear so he could rob them.

[Shameless!]

Mo Na Ye immediately took out a communication bead and transmitted a message using his Divine Sense.

This communication bead was left to him by Yang Kai the last time they met when he needed to hand over a batch of resources. Mo Na Ye hadn’t thrown it away, thinking that he might be able to use it to probe Yang Kai’s location in the future. He didn’t expect it to be useful so soon.

After a while, the communication bead in his hand trembled slightly, causing Mo Na Ye’s brow to twitch…

Yang Kai was really near the No-Return Pass. The movement of the communication bead was undoubtedly a sign that the message had been successfully transmitted!

10 million kilometres outside of the No-Return Pass, on a lone Universe Fragment, Yang Kai hid his figure and surveyed the surroundings with his Divine Sense. His current Divine Sense was incredibly powerful, and from this location, he could monitor the movements of all Black Ink Clan squads returning from the Black Ink Battlefield.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Over the last month or so, he had raided five Black Ink Clan teams, seized their resources, and made a great deal of profit.

He didn’t raid all the Black Ink Clan squads, but selectively chose a few; after all, he was doing business without investment so he couldn’t be too excessive. To continue this venture for a long time, he needed to take a steady approach; otherwise, the Black Ink Clan would probably act out in rage, damaging his future prospects.

As he was monitoring the movements of the void around him, Yang Kai suddenly felt something and took out a communication bead. With his Divine Sense, he probed it and couldn’t help but praise Mo Na Ye’s quick thinking.

He knew that he couldn’t hide his actions for long, so Yang Kai deliberately wore this communication bead on his body. He just didn’t expect Mo Na Ye to contact him so quickly.

The message in the communication bead was very simple, with only one sentence, “Sir Yang, can we meet?”

It was obvious that Mo Na Ye had already concluded that Yang Kai was involved in the disappearance of the teams transporting resources.
