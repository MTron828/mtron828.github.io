Ni Guang looked at Gui Zu like an idiot, “You stayed here for two thousand years, what’s so amazing about this place to make you not want to leave for so long?”

He looked around and found that there was nothing strange about this place.

“Do you think this old master didn’t want to leave?” Gui Zu’s complexion suddenly became extremely ugly, “This old master was trapped here for two thousand years! Do you know what it feels like to be trapped for two thousand years!? It’s worse than death...”

Thinking back on those two thousand years, Gui Zu’s heart clenched in pain.

With Gui Zu’s roar, Ni Guang’s complexion changed sharply, “You were trapped here for two thousand years... So, that is how it is. No wonder I’ve never heard of you before, it’s because you were here all that time. Did you just manage to escape recently?”

“Yes, thanks to Yang Boy. Otherwise, this old master would still be trapped even now,” Gui Zu nodded.

“How did you get trapped here?” Ni Guang looked blank, “I can’t see anything dangerous nearby.”

“This is... the Chaotic Abyss, right?” Xue Yue had been observing the surrounding area and suddenly said thoughtfully.

“You’re quite knowledgeable, little girl,” Gui Zu grinned, “Yes, this is the Chaotic Abyss!”

“What? This is actually the Chaotic Abyss?” Ni Guang’s face changed, “The famed most dangerous region of the Star Field?”

“What? Scared now?” Gui Zu snickered at him.

“Why would I not be? I’ve heard that even Origin Kings can die here without burial.”

“Heh heh, those rumours aren’t wrong. The Chaotic Abyss is not dangerous during ordinary times and is actually quite peaceful, but if a Chaotic Vortex erupts and one is sucked into it, there’s a good chance they’ll be crushed!” Gui Zu sneered, “This old master was pursued by a mortal enemy back then and was forced to escape to this place where he was accidentally caught in one of those Chaotic Vortices...”

“And it didn’t kill you? Fate has made you difficult to kill off,” Ni Guang was shocked.

“That is this old master’s fate! After being sucked into that vortex, I was trapped in a certain space for two thousand years, and it wasn’t until Yang Boy was also pulled into that place that he managed to bring me out,” Gui Zu took a deep breath. It was all because of this incident that Yang Kai and Gui Zu had met.

After leaving that place though, the two had not met again until the Severed World opened.

“Senior, what you mean is that Yang Kai...”

“En, Yang Boy went to the place where this old master was trapped before,” Gui Zu grinned.

Xue Yue’s face paled greatly.

“Don’t worry; did you forget what power Yang Boy is proficient in? Back then, this old master was able to escape thanks to him leading me through The Void. Now, he can enter that place at will, so he must also have full confidence in leaving. Moreover, once inside, that old fart Zi Long can only stare at him from the outside. Yang Boy will come out on his own one day, on his own terms.”

“Is waiting here... dangerous?” Ni Guang asked worriedly. Although the Chaotic Abyss was quiet at this moment, if a Chaotic Vortex appeared, it would likely be fatal.

“What are you afraid of? Chaotic Vortices don’t appear frequently,” Gui Zu said, unafraid.

“In that case, we will wait, but let me say this first: Many matters are waiting for this old master back in the chamber of commerce, so I cannot delay too long. This old master will wait here for two months at most,” Ni Guang said, while quietly glancing over at Xue Yue.

Although he said these words to Gui Zu, he was actually talking to Xue Yue.

Now that Yang Kai had hidden like this and was no longer in any danger, Xue Yue should be able to calm down even if she did not wait here.

“Do what you’d like. This old master must wait for Yang Boy to come out,” Gui Zu chuckled lightly.

As they talked, they arrived at a spot not too far from Zi Long’s group.

Zi Long was feeling very upset when he saw Ni Guang and the others rush over, so he couldn’t help snorting at him coldly.

Ni Guang did not pay him any attention. The two had torn all face inside the Severed World and neither was able to defeat the other, so there was no need for pleasantries between them. For the moment, the two groups simply stood apart and waited quietly.

.....

Above the floating continent, Yang Kai broke through The Void and leisurely appeared.

This was his first stop in the Star Field, and it was here that he had met Gui Zu, seeing what an Origin King Realm master truly was. It was also here that he realized just how insignificant he was and secretly swore to cultivate hard to make himself stronger.

Several dozen years later, he had returned here, drawing a slight sigh from his lips.

Although his cultivation had not reached the Origin King Realm yet, he could no longer be considered weak anymore.

Back then, he had been casually captured by a few Saints, while now he could destroy an army of Saints with a wave of his hand.

The floating continent was exactly what Yang Kai imagined it to be, the safest haven to avoid Zi Long’s pursuit.

Before he left that year, Yang Kai had left a thread of his Divine Sense deep underground, so following the faint connection it had with him, he was able to accurately locate the floating continent and use his Space Force to reach it almost instantaneously from the Chaotic Abyss.

Standing in place, Yang Kai took a light breath, feeling relaxed both physically and mentally.

He did not know how the floating continent came to be, but it was truly a small landmass, only stretching about two or three hundred thousand kilometres in diameter; however, this place was filled with rich World Energy and countless precious treasures.

Back then, Yang Kai had collected a lot of Origin King Grade herbs here.

When he returned to the floating continent for a second time, Yang Kai found that the aura here was even stronger than when he left, causing him to wonder how this place came to be and how it sustained itself.

Strictly speaking, the floating continent could be considered an extremely small star, because it had its own World Principles and its own Star Source. If it was given enough time, it might even become a flourishing Cultivation Star.

Could it be that other stars in the Star Field were born like this?

Yang Kai pondered over this thought for a while but to no avail.

“Haha, someone finally came in,” Suddenly, a loud laugh came from below, one filled with excitement.

Yang Kai frowned and turned his head in amazement.

He had not expected that there would be others on this floating continent.

Only after he saw the face of the other party did he suddenly remember!

He actually knew this person.

Lu Gui Chen! A name that Yang Kai had all but forgotten.

This man was a cultivator from Purple Star. When Yang Kai was captured by the cultivators of Purple Star and imprisoned on a Purple Star Starship, Lu Gui Chen had been the one in charge and it was also Lu Gui Chen who had sealed Yang Kai’s cultivation at that time.

At that time, Lu Gui Chen, like Yue Xi of Sword Union, had a Second-Order Saint King cultivation, and from Yang Kai’s point of view back then, that was already an insurmountable mountain. As such, when facing the seal placed on him by Lu Gui Chen, he was all but helpless.

Back then, the cultivators from Purple Star and Sword Union numbered a hundred in total, all of whom had landed on the floating continent together; but afterwards, as Gui Zu experimented with his Space Array, countless casualties occurred and very few ultimately survived.

Finally, when Yang Kai brought Yue Xi, her disciples, Gui Zu, and a few others out from the floating continent, he had not taken Lu Gui Chen with him and instead left him here.

But now, a few dozen years later, he was meeting this old acquaintance again.

If Lu Gui Chen hadn’t come out on his own initiative, Yang Kai would probably have not even remembered he was here.

“Friend, were you also pulled into this place by a Chaotic Vortex?” Lu Gui Chen seemed to have not spoken to another soul in several dozen years, so he called out very enthusiastically; however, after speaking for a moment, he frowned and stared at Yang Kai suspiciously. His eyes flashed brilliantly the next moment as he pointed at Yang Kai and shouted, “It’s you, it’s you!”

Obviously, he remembered Yang Kai too.

After all, Yang Kai had brought Gui Zu and the others to leave this damned place back then while abandoning him here. Lu Gui Chen had cursed Yang Kai an uncountable number of times since then, and seeing his most hated enemy before him at this moment, he felt enraged.

“Haha,” Yang Kai smiled faintly as he swept his eyes over Lu Gui Chen, realizing that the latter was in good health and had even reached the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm.

Several dozen years to go from the Second-Order Saint King Realm to the Second-Order Origin Returning Realm was a terrifying rate of improvement.

Such miraculous progress could only be attributed to the rich World Energy on the floating continent as well as all the precious treasures here.

Gui Zu had also used two thousand years in this place to reach the Origin King Realm. This floating continent was nothing short of a cultivation paradise.

“It’s you!” Lu Gui Chen’s angry expression suddenly turned to one of ecstasy, “Haha, the Heavens are truly just! I did not expect you would come back here one day, Boy! This is truly my, Lu Gui Chen’s, good fortune!”

As soon as these words fell, his face filled with ferocity and he charged towards Yang Kai, his Saint Qi pulsing madly as he shouted viciously, “Boy, obey this King and take him out of this damned place otherwise this King will kill you!”

“‘This King’?” Yang Kai raised his brow and sneered, “In front of me, you dare call yourself ‘this King’?”

“Brat! You do not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth! Just wait until this King catches you!” Lu Gui Chen saw Yang Kai not putting him in his eyes and became furious, raising his hands to capture Yang Kai without delay.

Yang Kai simply stood in place, without any intention of dodging, just staring at Lu Gui Chen flatly.

This stare made Lu Gui Chen’s heart clench as he suddenly had a bad premonition, as if he was a sheep that was about to attack a sleeping tiger.

But the arrow had already flown from the string, so Lu Gui Chen pushed aside this feeling and rushed out, grabbed Yang Kai’s shoulders, and poured his Saint Qi madly into him, trying to force him to submit.

[This damn brat, trying to act all mysterious,] Lu Gui Chen thought to himself, feeling overjoyed when he found he was so easily able to capture Yang Kai.

After seemingly succeeding, Lu Gui Chen coldly shouted, “Don’t move if you don’t want to die. This King has control of your life now, so if you dare to resist, this King will...”

“Scram!” When Yang Kai saw him drone on endlessly, he became slightly irritated and abruptly pushed his Saint Qi.

The next moment, Lu Gui Chen’s complexion changed drastically as he noticed the Saint Qi he poured into Yang Kai’s body disappear like a stone sinking into the sea. In the next instant, an irresistible force burst from Yang Kai, rushed into his arms, and rampaged through his five organs.
