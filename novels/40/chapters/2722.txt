Yang Kai had just told Zhu Qing earlier that this boy was a Medicine Pill Valley disciple, a disciple of Wondrous Pill Great Emperor.

The fact that she slapped him would definitely bring trouble to High Heaven Palace. Worse, she might make Yang Kai angry with her, then she wouldn’t be able to complete her mission…

Zhu Qing was panicking, but she really couldn’t stand being in that situation just now.

“I almost got slapped to death by this bitch, can’t you tell!?” The young man shouted hysterically, his face filled with indignance as if he had suffered a massive grievance.

“No, not really.” Yang Kai looked at him in amazement and beckoned him, “Why don’t you come closer so I can see where she hit you?”

The young man hopped to his feet and scampered over to Yang Kai, pushing his cheek out for him to see, “My face! She actually hit my face! Look at what she did! If you don’t settle this matter to my satisfaction, I’ll never let this matter rest!”

Yang Kai observed the injury seriously and nodded lightly before suddenly raising his hand and slapping him flying on the other side of his face.

Pa…

A crisp noise sounded as Li Xuan flipped into the air, tumbling a dozen times before landing heavily. Around half of his teeth had been lost before he even hit the ground.

After he fell, he was seeing stars and lay there dumbly. It took him quite some time before he was able to recover from the shock.

The women present were all shocked, their eyes widening in unison.

“Palace Master, you…” Hua Qing Si was horrified. If one were to call Zhu Qing’s slap to Li Xuan’s face inviting disaster, then as High Heaven Palace’s Palace Master, Yang Kai’s slap was already serious to the point of being unmanageable.

Yang Kai was the representative of High Heaven Palace at this moment, so his every move carried great consequences. Wouldn’t this slap be an open challenge to Medicine Pill Valley?

Just thinking about it was terrifying, and as High Heaven Palace’s Head Manager, Hua Qing Si suddenly felt… exhausted! But very soon, she felt relieved. When she saw that boy called Li Xuan being swatted away, she really felt incredibly good.

This little bastard was just too outrageous.

“Next time you encounter this sort of thing, hit harder!” Yang Kai glanced at Zhu Qing.

Zhu Qing nodded dumbly.

As a dragon girl, her domineering power was almost insurmountable. Yang Kai had nearly eaten a great loss from her himself back then. If she had struck him with even ten percent of her strength, Li Xuan would have exploded into a blood mist a dozen times over. It was only because of Yang Kai’s words that she acted with so much restraint, only giving some light punishment. If this wasn’t the case, how could Li Xuan still be alive?

“You… You actually dare to…” Li Xuan finally came back to his senses and tremblingly pointed his finger at Yang Kai. His speech was slurred and the contents of his words unclear, “You actually dare to hit me?!”

“So what if I hit you!” Yang Kai raised his hand menacingly, causing Li Xuan to scamper to hold his head with his arms in fear.

Only when nothing happened after he waited for a long time did Li Xuan dare to sneak a peek at Yang Kai. Realizing he had been toyed with, his face instantly turned red and he howled, “I am a disciple of Medicine Pill Valley, but you dare hit me?! You’re dead!”

“So you remember getting hit, but not the pain?” Yang Kai looked at him sternly and walked over to him, lifting Li Xuan up to face him.

Li Xuan struggled hard, but how could he escape from Yang Kai’s grip with his meagre strength? He shouted in terror, “What… What are you doing!”

“Teaching you a lesson!” Yang Kai coldly snorted and reached out to slap him.

Pa pa pa…

The incessant sounds of slaps rang out, and although Yang Kai didn’t use his Emperor Qi, his physical strength alone was enough for Li Xuan to beg for death. In just a few slaps, his face was already tear-streaked as he wailed out with no shame.

“Such outrageous behaviour at such a young age,” Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance and raised his palm in front of Li Xuan’s face, looking fiercely at him, “Are you going to speak properly now?”

“Y-Y-Yes…” Li Xuan nodded repeatedly, only to feel that most of his face was numb. Even from the corner of his eye, he could see that his cheek was swollen up high.

“Apologize!” Yang Kai tossed Li Xuan right over to Zhu Qing’s feet.

Zhu Qing looked at Yang Kai, surprised, and feeling inexplicably moved.

Was he standing up for her? With Yang Kai’s current identity, the best thing to do in this situation would be to try to minimize the problem and ensure no trouble came to him in the future, but instead he actually beat up this little brat and demanded he apologize to her.

Wasn’t he annoyed at her and avoiding her? Why was he doing this?

For a moment, Zhu Qing’s mind was a mess.

Li Xuan struggled to stand properly in front of Zhu Qing before bowing deeply and saying in a sincere voice, “Little Brother apologizes to this Elder Sister for his brusqueness. I hope Elder Sister can be generous unlike myself. I’m just a child, I don’t know anything, so please don’t be angry, Elder Sister.”

After being given a sound beating, Li Xuan was like a whole new person. There was no need to mention how well behaved and sensible he had become.

Zhu Qing frowned, “It’s nothing.”

It really was nothing. When this little brat tried to take advantage of her earlier, he didn’t even manage to touch her clothes, so she didn’t suffer any loss. Instead, Li Xuan was beaten black and blue by Yang Kai.

“Thank you, Elder Sister, for your magnanimity!” Li Xuan had a grateful look on his face. Then, he turned around and went over to Yang Kai, a flattering smile on his face, “Elder Brother, Little Brother has already apologized, and Elder Sister has also forgiven me, you see…”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “En, good. It seems like you can be taught after all.”

Li Xuan responded with all smiles, “Elder Brother’s compliments are overgenerous. If there’s nothing else, then this Little Brother will excuse himself for now!”

“Don’t you want the Spirit Herbs?” Yang Kai glanced at him with a curious expression on his face.

Li Xuan slapped his head and laughed dryly, “Haha, I almost forgot! This was the task that Honoured Master has given me!”

Yang Kai smiled and tossed him the Space Ring he prepared earlier, “The herbs on the list are all in there. Take a look yourself.”

“No need, no need. I trust Elder Brother’s integrity.” Li Xuan put away the Space Ring as he spoke before taking out another Space Ring, handing it to Yang Kai, “These are the Source Crystals for the Spirit Herbs. Elder Brother, please have a look!”

Yang Kai nodded in response and accepted the Space Ring. After checking it with his Divine Sense though, he looked back at Li Xuan and asked, “The quantity is a bit low. Are you sure that these are the Source Crystals your Honoured Master gave you?”

The Spirit Herbs on that list weren’t just ordinary materials, and based on Yang Kai’s estimations, they would be worth at least twenty million High-Rank Source Crystals!

But there were only a thousand Source Crystals in the Space Ring, and they were all Low-Rank Source Crystals!

The immense difference was simply like Heaven and Earth.

Li Xuan was stunned, then smiled and said, “That’s the wrong one, the wrong one, this is the one that Honoured Master gave me!”

While speaking, he scrambled to take out a different Space Ring for Yang Kai.

This time, the number of Source Crystals inside the ring made more sense. Moreover, it was even higher than Yang Kai’s estimations, with a total of twenty-five million High-Rank Source Crystals in it. It seemed what Ji Yao said previously was true. Even though Medicine Pill Valley asked all the top Sects in the Northern Territory to collect Spirit Herbs for them, they definitely wouldn’t let those Sects suffer a loss. All the herbs were bought according to their worth, and they even paid out a little extra.

After all, this matter related to the reputation of Medicine Pill Valley and Wondrous Pill Great Emperor. The disciples of Medicine Pill Valley also wouldn’t dare to mess around.

But Yang Kai knew that if Seeking Passion Sect still existed, this brat Li Xuan would only have needed to pay them the Source Crystals in the first ring for their herbs.

Li Xuan clearly wanted to take advantage of the situation. After all, twenty-five million High-Rank Source Crystals was no small number.

That was why he prepared two sets of Source Crystals in two separate rings.

But after the fierce lesson he received from Yang Kai, how could he dare to cheat him?

After the exchange was over, Li Xuan immediately excused himself and naturally Yang Kai didn’t try to stop him.

The young man boarded his ship. His actions did carry some elegance, and if not for his face which was as swollen as a pig’s head right now, he would have looked quite the gentleman.

“Farewell Elder Brother and Elder Sisters!” Li Xuan waved enthusiastically at them while standing on the deck.

“Have a safe trip!” Yang Kai responded with a smile.

Li Xuan’s ship quickly sailed away, but the moment he turned around, the smile on his face was quickly replaced with icy coldness.

…..

“What are you trying to do?” Ji Yao suddenly flickered and stood in front of Yang Kai, blocking his way. Her cold eyes were just like sharp knives that penetrated into Yang Kai’s heart, seeing into his soul.

This sudden action stunned both Hua Qing Si and Zhu Qing, as neither of them understood what Ji Yao meant.

“Nothing, I just felt like going out for a walk!” Yang Kai looked up at the sky, not daring to look Ji Yao in the eye.

“I’ll accompany you then,” Ji Yao said.

“I’m just going for a casual walk, why would you want to come with me?” Yang Kai eyed her.

“I want to take a walk too.”

Yang Kai grit his teeth, “I’m in the mood to visit a brothel to have some fun, are you going to accompany me for that too?”

“In the mood, are you?” Ji Yao sneered, “Fine, come back to Ice Heart Valley with me. You need only raise your hand and I guarantee hundreds of Ice Heart Valley’s disciples will willingly drown you to death!”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, “But aren’t the disciples from Ice Heart Valley very particular about purity of heart and freedom from worldly desires?”

“It’s just satisfying a need, what’s there to shy away from? I can’t talk for the others, but I have a few Martial Nieces who I know adore you very much. If you want, I can make arrangements for you, and I ensure they will be willing participants.”

[This Martial Aunt really is thoughtful…]

Yang Kai couldn’t help but gulp, almost agreeing instinctually to her proposition when he suddenly felt two burning gazes on his back. Choking down his words, he quickly barked, “What’s the fun with a good, well-behaved girl? This Young Master likes the broken flowers and withered willows in the brothel. That’s where the fun is!”

“Enough!” Ji Yao was trembling from anger. Even though Yang Kai was just mouthing off and not actually doing anything, she still found his words hard to accept. What’s more, what Yang Kai said made it sound as if he was a regular patron of brothels…

“You’re the one who should know when to stop! What are you getting in my way for? I already have one woman constantly following me around and pestering me. If you join in too, how am I going to live!” Yang Kai glared at her.

Zhu Qing frowned, sulking, “Who are you talking about? Speak clearly!”

“You, I’m talking about you! You have a problem with that?” Yang Kai glared at her.

Zhu Qing turned away, mumbling, “You think I want to do this?”

“Don’t try to hoodwink me!” Ji Yao scoffed, “You’re not trying to visit a brothel, you just want to silence the witness to the crime, aren’t you?”

“Silence the witness to the crime!” Hua Qing Si was shocked, “Silence what witness? What crime?”
