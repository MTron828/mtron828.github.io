Void Land was in a mess. Numerous Spirit Peaks had been razed to the ground, and the seven Orchards had suffered heavy losses.

Yang Kai was heartbroken.

Void Land was his foothold in the 3,000 Worlds, and he spent a massive fortune to arrange the Nine Heavenly Layers Grand Array here. It would be a huge loss if it was damaged due to such a battle.

However, according to the current situation, even though the battle between Zhu Jiu Yin and the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters was fierce, it was still insufficient to destroy Void Land outright.

And what made Yang Kai slightly relieved was that Zhu Jiu Yin also knew that there were many disciples living in Void Land, so the battlefield was not spread to areas with a higher population.

What Yang Kai could not figure out was why this woman decided to fight inside Void Land. He had asked her to lead the enemy out into the void, but Zhu Jiu Yin turned a deaf ear. No one knew what she had planned.

Yang Kai’s eyes were not quick enough, so although he knew three figures were constantly flashing back and forth, fighting against each other, and he could sense the turbulent World Forces and the shaking around him, he could not see who had the upper hand, so he could only ask Yue He humbly, “Which one of them is stronger now?”

Yue He replied, “Zhu Jiu Yin won’t be able to persist for long alone…”

Yang Kai frowned. He had a rough estimate of Zhu Jiu Yin’s strength, and it was indeed difficult for her to hold out against two Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters alone. However, she did well for holding on so long. In other words, Zhu Jiu Yin now possessed the strength of a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; otherwise, the situation would not be like this…

[Is this Zhu Jiu Yin’s full potential?] Yang Kai was not sure; after all, although Zhu Jiu Yin had been with him since the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, no one knew whether she had fully adapted to the Principles in the 3,000 Worlds, and no one knew whether she could even restore herself to her peak.

If this was all of Zhu Jiu Yin’s strength, Zhu Jiu Yin was a Divine Spirit equivalent to a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master; if not, her peak strength must be on par with an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master!

After thinking about it for a while, Yang Kai shouted, “Assist her!”

Yue He and Mo Mei received the orders and rushed towards Zhu Jiu Yin. In a battle between High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, they were the only two in the entire Void Land who could intervene. Although Pang Duo and the others had cultivations in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm, they were not strong enough to participate in such a battle. Sending them would be the same as throwing them into the tiger’s den, so it was better for them to stay out of it.

Therefore, Pang Duo and the others did not move at all but stayed by Yang Kai’s side to avoid being taken advantage of by the enemy.

But Yue He and Mo Mei were both newly promoted Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, so it was hard to say how much help they could provide.

“Don’t come here!” Zhu Jiu Yin suddenly yelled, apparently aware of Yue He and Mo Mei’s movements.

Yue He and Mo Mei immediately stopped. Since Zhu Jiu Yin stopped them from approaching, it meant that the two of them would be more trouble than help. All of a sudden, everyone became tense.

Although Void Land had won three out of the four major battles, and the Hundred Sect Alliance was almost completely wiped out, with even Kong Feng, the main culprit, captured alive, the battle between Zhu Jiu Yin and the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realms was the one that would decide the fate of this conflict.

If Zhu Jiu Yin won, Void Land would be safe and sound. On the other hand, if she lost, all other victories would be in vain, no matter how many there had been. The power of the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters was simply not something that Void Land could compete against right now.

The survival of Void Land now depended on Zhu Jiu Yin alone!

Yang Kai clenched his fists and teeth, his eyes glued unblinkingly on every movement on the battlefield. As time passed, even he could tell that Zhu Jiu Yin was at a disadvantage.

The two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters had extraordinary strength and both of them worked together seamlessly. Zhu Jiu Yin let her guard slip for a moment and barely blocked a few attacks, allowing the Master from Myriad Demons Heaven to thrust his spear towards her chest.

Zhu Jiu Yin’s beautiful face paled and she pulled away, but the long spear chased after her like maggots on rotting bones.

When Zhu Jiu Yin was about to be stabbed, there was a loud bang and an enormous creature suddenly appeared.

It was a gigantic, silver-white spider. A crescent-shaped mark was branded on its back, permeating the void with the power of a Divine Spirit.

Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!

Zhu Jiu Yin was forced to reveal her true form.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. If she was not left with no other choice, Zhu Jiu Yin would not have revealed her true form. Now that she had, it was obvious she was forced to a fatal corner.

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider had an odd appearance, both menacing and enchanting all at once. Swinging her eight legs, Zhu Jiu Yin weaved a Spirit Web across Void Land to trap the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters.

The sword wielder launched at this web while scoffing, “It turns out that Madam is of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider lineage. I haven’t seen one for many years. Since Madam is a Divine Spirit, why should you restrict yourself to this small place? It’s better to retreat quickly to avoid unnecessary suffering!” The sword slashed down, cutting through strands of spider web.

Zhu Jiu Yin gritted her teeth and did not answer, continuing to spin more Spirit Webs, sealing the skies and locking the earth. Every step she took on the ground shook the world.

The sword wielder frowned, wondering what the hell Zhu Jiu Yin was doing.

The High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master of Myriad Demons Heaven shouted in a low voice, “Let’s not drag this longer. Finish it!”

The sword wielder gave a small nod, his Sword Intent soaring.

The combined attacks of the two were more than twice as fierce as before, and Zhu Jiu Yin’s situation became more and more precarious. If she faced either of these two separately, she would not be at such a disadvantage, but she had too many constraints inside Void Land, and had not restored herself to her peak. Worst of all, she could not escape because she had to protect Yang Kai, hence her current situation.

However, although she did pull back and tried her best to resist, she did not stop stomping the earth, causing a drum-like reverberation into the depths of the ground.

In the beginning, the two High-Rank Open Heaven did not think too much about it, but after a while, both of them realized that something was wrong. Zhu Jiu Yin was already struggling to deal with their attacks, so why did it seem like she was distracted?

The sword wielder muttered in a low voice, “I don’t know what trick this woman is playing, but stay alert.”

The Open Heaven Realm Master of Myriad Demons Heaven smiled grimly, “How dare you scheme against us when you’re about to die!”

As soon as the two of them spoke, their expressions suddenly changed, and they quickly backed off to look around in shock, as if they were about to face a great enemy.

Zhu Jiu Yin too, stopped and took a long breath, feeling quite aggrieved. If only she had recovered to her peak, these two would be nothing to her, and there would be no need for her to fight so hard. However, it would take at least three to five more years to completely restore her strength.

She made up her mind at that moment. If the situation turned dire, she would flee with Yang Kai and Shan Qing Luo immediately. These two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would not be able to stop her if she really wanted to.

She was Yang Kai’s Protector and had to ensure his safety no matter what. Shan Qing Luo possessed a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider Source, so she must protect her too. As for the lives of others, Zhu Jiu Yin had no concern for them whatsoever. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, in this way, Yang Kai would definitely complain and reprimand her.

Fortunately, the crisis had finally been resolved. She relaxed a bit, and snarled through gritted teeth, “I thought you would never come out. Are you trying to be a turtle that hides in its shell forever? Try hiding if you still can!”

Outside the battlefield, Yang Kai and the others were completely confused. They were under the impression that Zhu Jiu Yin was in a precarious situation, and were utterly astonished by the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master’s sudden retreat and change in expressions.

And they became even more puzzled by Zhu Jiu Yin’s words.

But soon, a strange look appeared on Yang Kai’s face. He faintly sensed an aura awakening from Void Land, as though the entire World had come alive. What’s more, this awakening aura made his Dragon Vein pulse slightly…

“Oh oh, little girl, it hurts when you’re jumping around on this Old Master’s head like this.” An aged voice suddenly boomed loudly, and then, a short figure appeared a short distance in front of Zhu Jiu Yin. His appearance was quaint and completely relaxed, as if he had been standing there all along, except that no one had seen him, including Yang Kai and even the two Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

“Besides, how can I be a turtle if I don’t hide?” The short figure spoke again.

Zhu Jiu Yin snorted coldly. She was a Divine Spirit, so even though she looked young and beautiful, she had in fact lived in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary for many millennia; however, she did not rebuke when she was addressed by this old man as ‘little girl’.

...

Yang Kai looked strangely at the short figure who appeared. His hair and beard were completely white, and his face was so wrinkled and withered that he looked as if he was about to die. Bent forward with a thick turtle shell behind his back, one could see the intertwined ravines on his shell clearly. It appeared to be exquisite and profound patterns and texts, carrying the wisdom of the Grand Dao.

Aware that Yang Kai was looking at him, the hunched old man, who seemed like he was dying, turned his head to look at Yang Kai and smiled at him.

Based on his appearance, combined with the aura on him and the response in his own blood, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up!

“Another Divine Spirit?” Eyes narrowed, the Myriad Demons Heaven’s High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master squinted at the short old man. It was already surprising enough for a trivial Void Land to have a Heavenly Moon Demon Spider living here, who would have thought there would be a second Divine Spirit?

However, the true form of this Divine Spirit was not revealed at this moment, and there was no way to know which race he belonged to. The conspicuous turtle shell on his back piqued many assumptions though.

If it was only Zhu Jiu Yin, the combined forces of the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters would give them the upper hand; however, with an additional Divine Spirit appearing, they had no chance of victory.

This Divine Spirit was so well hidden before that they had no way of realizing he was even here, and it did not appear right until the critical moment to disrupt the situation. While it wasn’t clear whose side this old man was on, it was certain he wasn’t an ally to them.

Thinking of this, the two High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters frowned.

The sword wielder took a step forward and crossed an arm across his chest, his long sword held in the other hand behind him, “How should I address Old Sir?”

The old man did not answer. His head was lowered because of his hunched back, and his two long white eyebrows dangled from his face, obscuring everyone from his expression.

The sword wielder waited for a while, but there was no response. He was naturally a little upset and was about to open his mouth to ask another question, but he suddenly heard a snore.

...

This old fart actually fell asleep!
