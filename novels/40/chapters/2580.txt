“Honoured Guest, you are truly kind. Forgive this Elder for being overly suspicious and pessimistic,” Elder smiled lightly, stroking his beard.

Yang Kai added, “Actually, I hoped that Xiao Xiao could stay and live with you from the start. I am already satisfied by the fact that I found him.”

Exactly as he said, since Xiao Xiao had found his clan, it was far better for him to live with his clansmen than to remain alone with Yang Kai. All the living beings in the world, no matter what kind, were social creatures. If they remained alone, they would lose their minds sooner or later.

Elder and Mu Na glanced at each other before lightly nodding, seemingly agreeing with Yang Kai.

Mu Na then asked with a smile, “Honoured Guest, I wonder if you have heard of the Blood Gate?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, having no idea why they suddenly switched the topic to this, but he still replied with a nod, “I knew nothing about it before coming to the Ancient Lands, but I happened to have heard of the legends regarding the Blood Gate a few days ago.”

Mu Na’s beautiful eyes lit up as she continued, “Honoured Guest, since you know about it, then this saves this Queen the trouble of explaining it to you.”

Yang Kai asked in amazement, “What does the Blood Gate have to do with you?”

Mu Na didn’t speak this time, but turned to look at the Stone Spirit Elder, who replied in a grim voice, “The Blood Gate is connected to every creature of the Ancient Lands. In the Ancient Lands, there is a saying: If one can enter the Blood Gate, he or she can be reborn, stimulating his or her ancestral bloodline and transforming into a Divine Spirit!”

Xie Wu Wei had said the same thing a few days ago too, so Yang Kai still remembered it.

Elder continued, “Although most have heard of this rumour, they have no way to verify it. Only a few people know that it is indeed true.”

Yang Kai’s expression slightly changed as he asked, “Can one’s ancestral bloodline really be stimulated and he or she truly become a Divine Spirit after entering the Blood Gate?”

Elder chuckled before replying, “Not necessarily. It’s just a chance, that’s all.”

Yang Kai’s interest was piqued and he immediately asked, “I would like to hear the details.”

Elder pondered for a moment as he was sorting out his words before finally speaking, “Most of the Ancient Lands’ creatures are descended from Ancient Divine Spirits, thus inheriting some proportion of their ancient bloodline, and only those who fulfil this condition may become a Divine Spirit after entering the Blood Gate! Furthermore, the process is extremely dangerous. It could be said that nine out ten would certainly die.”

Mu Na added, “Guest, since you dare to enter the Ancient Wild Lands, your cultivation cannot be weak, so I assume you have already come into contact with Source Strength, yes?”

Yang Kai nodded in confirmation. Cultivators would have already come into contact with the Source Strength in the Dao Source Realm, and he was already an Emperor Realm Master, so how could he be unfamiliar with it?

Mu Na continued, “If one wants to become a Divine Spirit and regain the glory of their ancestors, entering the Blood Gate is just the first step, nothing more. After entering the Blood Gate, that’s when the real test begins. Most of the Ancient Lands’ creatures think that entering the Blood Gate is enough to become a Divine Spirit. Although this isn’t technically wrong, it is a somewhat na?ve interpretation of the truth. They just know the possible end result, but do not know anything about the process involved.”

“What kind of test is it then?” Yang Kai tightly frowned, grasping some idea of the matter quickly.

Elder replied in a heavy voice, “Every Divine Spirit has its own Divine Spirit Source. Bloodline atavism is one aspect of regaining the status of a Divine Spirit, but the more important factor is obtaining the recognition of the Divine Spirit Source. Only after obtaining the acknowledgement and acceptance of a Divine Spirit Source can one have the opportunity to become the true Divine Spirit.”

Even though this was a somewhat convoluted explanation, Yang Kai understood it at once.

A Divine Spirit Source was a very peculiar existence. For instance, the Phoenix True Fire was a Fire Phoenix Source. If someone could get the Phoenix True Fire, he or she might have a great chance to become a Fire Phoenix, like in Liu Yan’s case, but whether she could succeed or not depended on her luck. If she couldn’t get the Phoenix True Fire’s recognition, it would be disastrous for Liu Yan. This was a kind of test for her.

In other words, if one wanted to become a Divine Spirit, Bloodline Power and the Divine Spirit Source were indispensable.

Yang Kai was stunned and hesitatingly asked, “Do you mean that there are Divine Spirit Sources inside the Blood Gate?”

Elder and Mu Na glanced at each other, feeling a little surprised. They felt that Yang Kai was too sharp, as he had arrived at this conclusion with only these few clues.

Elder agreed with a nod, “That’s right. There are Divine Spirit Sources inside the Blood Gate. If someone has the opportunity to enter it, he or she could attempt to merge with one, and if he or she succeeds, they can then really become a Divine Spirit. But if he or she can’t, then they would meet their end.”

“How can there be Divine Spirit Sources inside the Blood Gate?” Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

Elder replied with a bitter smile, “Because the Blood Gate is just an entrance. There is a Divine Spirit Palace inside the Blood Gate, where many Divine Spirit Sources are stored. It could be said that almost all Sources from the Divine Spirits in ancient times are kept there.”

Yang Kai was greatly shocked again, “How is that possible?”

He suddenly made an educated guess and asked, shocked, “Could it be that it’s something like the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, where those Divine Spirits would enter on their own when their predestined time of death arrives, leaving their Source Strength after their deaths?”

If not, how could there be countless Divine Spirit Sources inside this so-called Divine Spirit Palace.

“That’s not the case,” Mu Nu said, shaking her head, “The Heavens are impartial in all things. Divine Spirits are too strong, and in ancient times, Humans could not resist them. There were far too many Divine Spirits in the early eras of the universe, and each of them was incredibly powerful. Such immense strength led to many of the Ancient Divine Spirits becoming extremely cruel and violent. They would fight at every turn, disturbing the world around them and all other creatures in existence. However, all things in the universe have their nemesis, just like Yin and Yang counter and balance one another. One day, a peerless Master was born among the Humans, one who possessed a natural ability to restrain Divine Spirits. It could be said that the individual was the natural enemy of all Divine Spirits. That Master spent countless years executing rampant Divine Spirits and taking away their Sources to seal in the Divine Spirit Palace. Then, that peerless Master sealed the Divine Spirit Palace and hid it inside the Blood Gate, cutting off the inheritance of those Divine Spirits, preventing them from continuing to spread their destruction.”

“The Divine Spirit’s natural enemy!” Yang Kai gasped in shock. He had never expected that such a person could have existed in this world. How strong would someone like that have to be?

Nu Ma solemnly added, “Although that Master was strong according to the legends, that Master’s strength didn’t exceed that of the Masters of that generation by much. Rather, it was due to that Master’s innate ability to suppress Divine Spirits that they were able to achieve what they had. No Divine Spirit could pose any resistance when facing that Master, and their lives were all up to that Master to preside over! Therefore, there are lots of Divine Spirit Sources inside the Divine Spirit Palace. That person was called Heaven’s Order, enforcing justice on behalf of the Heavens. Heaven’s Order wielded the Heaven’s Order Sword, and wherever that Master went, Divine Spirits retreated. Everyone trembled at the mere mention of ‘Heaven’s Order.’”

[Heaven’s Order!]

Yang Kai memorized it and lightly nodded, but soon, he suspiciously asked again, “How do you know about such ancient matters?”

Mu Na glanced at Elder, who chuckled and explained, “If you want to talk about lifespan, I’m afraid there is no race in this world that can live longer than my Stone Spirit Clan. These things have been passed down word for word from one generation to another in my Stone Spirit Clan, which is just a matter of the last two generations, that’s all.”

[Last two generations!?] the corners of Yang Kai’s lips twitched when he realized that this Stone Spirit Elder was an even older monster than he originally thought, probably hundreds of thousands of years old already. It was no wonder he looked so aged!

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming his throbbing heart, before curiously asking, “Elder and Matriarch, for what reason did you call me here and specifically tell me about this?”

Elder suddenly looked at him with a serious expression on his face before speaking in an earnest voice, “This Elder would like to request Honorable Guest’s help to retrieve a certain Divine Spirit Source left by my Stone Spirit Clan’s ancestor.”

Yang Kai was stunned, “Elder, your Stone Spirit Clan’s ancestor was a Divine Spirit!?”

Elder nodded, “Yes. The Stone Spirit Clan’s ancestor was known as Tai Yue. In the past, because he offended Heaven’s Order, he was killed. Heaven’s Order then collected his Source Strength and sealed it in the Divine Spirit Palace.”

Yang Kai’s facial features twitched, “But why do you think that I can help you? I don’t understand this point at all. Furthermore, something unusual is happening at the Blood Gate now and the Monster Race’s Four Great Venerables are keeping a close eye on it. It won’t be easy to enter the Blood Gate under these circumstances.”

Mu Na agreed, “We naturally know this. The change of the Blood Gate is a sign from the Heavens. If it weren’t for this, we too wouldn’t have come up with this plan.”

Elder added with a sigh, “Although the Stone Spirit Clan is strong, it has not been easy for us to continue surviving. Because of the extraordinary strength and abilities we wield, the Ancient Land’s Four Great Divine Venerables have always wanted to subdue us for their own use. Some time ago, the Four Great Divine Venerables gave us an ultimatum, that if our clans did not surrender to them, we would be completely destroyed. If our clans want to resist, we can only do so if we have power equal to theirs, and the Blood Gate is our last chance.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow. He knew that the Stone Spirit Clan had no other option, so they considered the Blood Gate, wanting to regain Tai Yue’s Source to fight against the Four Great Divine Venerables.

Xiao Xiao was now a member of the Stone Spirit Clan, so the Stone Spirit Clan’s survival was in line with his interests. Yang Kai couldn’t ignore their predicament.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai suggested, “If Elder wants to, I can take you out of the Ancient Wild Lands. Although the Four Divine Venerables are powerful, as long as you leave this place, I’m afraid you will be beyond their reach.”

Elder gave a wry smile before stating, “We can’t leave our homeland, please forgive me.”

He was rejected.

Mu Na stated, “Elder wants Shi Jiu to inherit the power of Tai Yue. If he succeeds, then Shi Jiu will be the new Tai Yue. By then, he will have the strength to protect the Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Clans. Shi Jiu was raised by you, so you must also want what’s best for him, am I right?”

[Why does it feel that I’m being led into a trap?] Yang Kai couldn’t help but grumble in his heart; however, hearing that Elder wanted Xiao Xiao to inherit Tai Yue’s power, Yang Kai was inevitably a little tempted.

If Xiao Xiao could really inherit Tai Yue’s power, he would be a new Divine Spirit.

Although moved, Yang Kai still solemnly asked, “Why are you letting Xiao Xiao inherit Tai Yue’s power? Are there no other candidates?”

Elder replied with a smile, “Shi Jiu is still young and malleable. If he inherits it, the chances of success will be higher.”

“In other words, there is still a possibility of failure?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

Elder and Mu Na sunk into silence. This question was obviously difficult to answer.

Yang Kai asked, maintaining a stoic look, “Does Xiao Xiao know about this?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder confirmed with a nod, “I have already consulted Shi Jiu about this, and he too has agreed.”

Yang Kai unhappily stated, “So to say, even if I don’t help you, you will still rush into the Blood Gate!?”

“That’s right!” Elder affirmatively replied.

Yang Kai’s expression immediately turned gloomy. Since they had already decided, then why the hell were they only telling him about this now? Although he had quite a good impression of the Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Clans, Yang Kai didn’t have any deep friendship with them. If they wanted to court death, Yang Kai could care less about it, but the point was that Xiao Xiao was involved.

Yang Kai secretly thought. [How about I find a chance to take Xiao Xiao and run away, saving myself from the trouble of getting mixed up in this muddy water…]
