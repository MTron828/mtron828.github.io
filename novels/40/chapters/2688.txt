*Kacha‚Ä¶ *

Everyone was taken aback by the soft noise. The face of the old man who sat in room seven turned pale and his eyes widened as he could not believe Yang Kai was so powerful.

Yang Kai could actually cause a crack in the barrier with a single punch, so it could be imagined what would happen if he unleashed a few more punches‚Ä¶

[Damn Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce, what kind of defective Spirit Array is this? Useless!] The old man cursed in his heart. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

While the old man was still in a state of shock, Yang Kai summoned the Myriads Sword and pushed his Emperor Qi fiercely, causing an eruption of sword light as he slashed out.

*Hong‚Ä¶ *

The power of the sword seemed to be able to penetrate space itself and flip the Heavens and Earth. The expressions of the Emperor Realm Masters in the other private rooms turned solemn as they realized just how formidable Yang Kai was.

The light curtain barrier which already had a crack on it completely shattered under the slash of the sword, turning into fluorescent dust as it scattered and disappeared.

Room seven was immediately exposed, utterly unprotected.

Yang Kai slashed once more and broke into the room where he met an old man with a pale and frightened face staring back at him with his eyes widened.

With a flicker, Yang Kai rushed inside and rested the broad Myriads Sword on the old man‚Äôs shoulder and demanded, ‚ÄúOld thing, give me your head.‚Äù

*Deng deng deng deng‚Ä¶ *

The old man stumbled back in horror and shouted with his teeth gritted, ‚ÄúFriend, it‚Äôs now or never!‚Äù

Having said that, he pounced at Yang Kai while pushing his Emperor Qi wildly. The old man bent his fingers into claws as an eagle phantom flashed behind him. A shadow of two gigantic claws cast over the entire sky, charging forward fiercely, as if he was about to tear apart Yang Kai‚Äôs body.

Although the old man knew that Yang Kai was not easy to be dealt with, in the end, he was also a First-Order Emperor Realm Master. Furthermore, with the assistance of his ally from room thirteen, the old man was not too afraid of Yang Kai. As such, he held nothing back with his attack, obviously wanting to end things in a single stroke.

However, just when he was about to reach Yang Kai‚Äôs face, he was welcomed by a big foot covered in rich Emperor Qi, stomping on his face directly. Despite the simplicity of this move, it managed to disperse the shadow of gigantic claws from the old man.

The old man instinctively tried to evade, but to his surprise, the surrounding space seemed to solidify at that instant, making it impossible for him to move at all.

With a loud thud, the old man was thrown out and slammed directly into the wall behind him, from which he slid down slowly. Stars spun around his head, and apart from feeling dizzy, he also felt that his nose had been flattened.

When the old man opened his eyes again, he saw a broadsword pointed at his neck, the feel of it against his skin ice cold and at its opposite end stood Yang Kai with a sneer on his face.

The old man was appalled. He did not expect that even though they were both First-Order Emperors, he could not even take a single exchange of blows with Yang Kai before being beaten down.

[Is he‚Ä¶ is this monster really a First-Order Emperor Realm Master?]

Gasps sounded one after another from the surrounding private rooms as no one could believe the scene that just took place in front of them.

All of them had been observing the battle clearly just now. First, Yang Kai broke the protective barrier around the old man‚Äôs private room with just two blows, then he exchanged moves with the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect head-on, leading to the old Sect Master to take a kick to the face before he slid to the ground, his life now no longer in his own hands.

Everything that happened was beyond belief, and if they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would not believe that such a thing could happen in this world.

The Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect was an established First-Order Emperor Realm Master, so how could he be so vulnerable in front of an opponent with the same cultivation?

‚ÄúYou have a helper?‚Äù Yang Kai sneered, lightly glancing over at room thirteen.

The door of room thirteen was open, and a middle-aged man stood there in a posture that made it seem like he was preparing to rush out of his room, but right now, he was frozen stiff.

In front of him was Ying Fei, who was leaning against the door frame with his arms crossed, watching at him with a pair of sharp eagle-like eyes and a casual smirk.

There was no hostility, no aura fluctuations, and not even any pressure coming from Ying Fei‚Äôs body, but his mere presence had caused sweat to trickle down the head of the middle-aged man, locking him in place.

Inexplicably, this man felt that the one standing in front of him had the ability to kill him with ease, so even though he wanted to assist the Sect Master from Grey Sky Sect, he could not take a step forward.

‚ÄúGo back. Young Master Yang will visit you soon,‚Äù Ying Fei looked at the middle-aged man and waved his hand lightly.

The middle-aged man gulped down his saliva and gently closed the door, retreating back to his seat as he shivered from head to toe.

Inside room seven, Yang Kai grinned at the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect and teased, ‚ÄúIt looks like you‚Äôve been abandoned.‚Äù

Of course, Yang Kai knew what had happened to the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen. With Ying Fei guarding the door, it was difficult for that man to even leave his room, much less provide help to the old man in front of him.

But when the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect heard these words from Yang Kai, his face went ashen.

Initially, he thought he did not need to be too afraid of Yang Kai because they had the same cultivation. Moreover, with the support of room thirteen, it would be a two versus one battle so the old man didn‚Äôt put Yang Kai in his eyes at all. But as soon as they clashed, he realized how wrong he was.

This First-Order Emperor Junior was completely different from any he had encountered before.

However, what angered him more was that the person in room thirteen actually did nothing.

Feeling the cold chill of the Myriads Sword, the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect begged in a trembling voice, ‚ÄúForgive me, Young Master. I‚Äôm willing to apologize and make up for the mistakes. Please spare my life.‚Äù

At the critical moment of life and death, the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect did not care about face anymore; he just wanted to live. Without life, everything else was pointless.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs word is more valuable than their life!‚Äù

When the words fell, the Myriads Sword flashed across the old man‚Äôs neck.

The old man‚Äôs eyes widened as he stared in horror at Yang Kai, reaching up to touch his neck with his hand as he muttered, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before he could finish his thought though, blood spurted out of his neck with such force that it separated his head from his body, sending his head flying into the air.

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶‚Äù

Screams were heard around the room.

The Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect seemed to have brought several young disciples with him to experience the auction this time, so all of them were dumbstruck when Yang Kai broke into the room and could not help screaming in fear when their helpless Sect Master was beheaded without being able to even fight back. Among them were two beautiful female disciples who fell to the ground on their butts, their eyes completely glossing over.

Yang Kai ignored them as he casually grabbed the head of the Grey Sky Sect Sect Master by the hair and began examining it. The Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect truly lived up to his reputation as an Emperor Realm Master as he was still glaring at Yang Kai in anger even after he was beheaded, as if he could not accept such a fate, but after a while, the light in his eyes gradually faded.

Thousands of cultivators in the hall fell silent.

Previously, when Yang Kai took out hundreds of millions of High-Rank Source Crystal to create an unprecedented cultivation paradise for them, they appreciated him so much and never thought that such a good man could exist in the world. However, after watching him behead the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect just because of a few casually spoken words, they realized just how frightening Yang Kai could be.

The Emperor Realm Masters in the other private rooms also stared in shock. For those who slightly knew about the background of Yang Kai, they just shook their heads and felt pity for the old man.

This young man was the one who beat up a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master at the entrance of the auction house, so all of them were doing their best to avoid him. On the other hand, this old man dared to provoke him, so what end except death could he expect?

As for the Emperors who had no clue about Yang Kai, they could not help feeling a sense of dread. Most of them were just First-Order Emperors as well, similar to the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect. Seeing that this old man couldn‚Äôt even put up any kind of resistance before Yang Kai swiftly killed him, they could not help feeling terrified when they thought about if it was them in the old man‚Äôs position. All of them secretly decided not to provoke this devil, otherwise, they would be the next victim in line.

‚ÄúSince you wanted this Young Master to kick your head, then this Young Master is forced to accept it.‚Äù After speaking, Yang Kai tossed the old man‚Äôs head up, and spun his body into a flying spin kick, sending the head of the Grey Sky Sect Sect Master in a swoosh, straight arc to the auction stage, over Hua Qing Si‚Äôs head, and finally crashing directly into the backstage, completely smashing it into a mush, like a tossed watermelon.

Backstage, Wu Ming who was watching the show did not expect Yang Kai to kick the head to his side and only managed to dodge it narrowly, but he still had blood splash all over his body. Wu Ming‚Äôs face darkened instantly as he desperately held down his anger, despite how uncomfortable it was for him.

After doing so, Yang Kai lifted up the dead body of the Grey Sky Sect Sect Master and glanced at room thirteen with a grin, ‚ÄúWhere is my friend who said that he would eat three kilograms of shit? Be prepared, there‚Äôs a hot and fresh pile here.‚Äù

He then took the body and headed towards room thirteen as he spoke.

*Shua shua shua‚Ä¶ *

Everyone turned to room thirteen with full of sympathy.

Even though the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect was dead, it was a quick death as Yang Kai did not torture him, but for the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen, perhaps death would be a preferable option to his coming fate.

Imagining the torture that the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen would encounter soon, many shivered uncontrollably as goosebumps appeared all over their bodies.

They did not doubt Yang Kai‚Äôs strength and determination. Previously, the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect in room seven had stated that he would let Yang Kai kick his head like a ball, and Yang Kai really did it. On the other hand, the Emperor Realm Master in room thirteen had stated that he would eat three kilograms of shit, and they were afraid that‚Ä¶ he really would have to eat it now.

None of them had ever attended an auction like this, nor had they ever seen such an unruly person before.

The whole auction house turned dead silent as Divine Senses all emerged from the private rooms one after another to monitor the situation in room thirteen. No one could suppress their curiosity. Although they knew what was going to happen, they all still felt an irresistible yet terrifying urge to watch.

*Peng‚Ä¶ *

The door of room thirteen was kicked open, followed by the growl of the middle-aged, ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis Young Master is here to grant your wish. You‚Äôre welcome!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no, I didn‚Äôt say that. It wasn‚Äôt me.‚Äù

‚ÄúA real man never goes back on his word. At this point, there is nothing you can do to avoid it!‚Äù

‚ÄúYoung Master, please spare me from this, I was wrong! Broad-minded people will not care about the narrow-minded people, please don‚Äôt take offence!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no, it‚Äôs the first time this Young Master has heard such an awe-inspiring request, so he simply must grant it today! Monster King, don‚Äôt let him resist!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ You can kill me, but I‚Äôll not let you humiliate me, I‚Äôll fight you!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow dare you try to move without this King‚Äôs permission! Young Master Yang, three kilograms is too little! Make it thirty kilograms!‚Äù
