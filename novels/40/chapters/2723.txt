As soon as Hua Qing Si finished speaking, she suddenly came to her senses and looked at Yang Kai in horror, “Palace Master! You couldn’t be thinking of…”

Wanting to silence the witness to the crime all of a sudden. Thinking back to what happened just now, it was already obvious who the ‘witness’ was going to be.

She couldn’t help but feel shocked at Yang Kai’s recklessness.

That person was a Medicine Pill Valley disciple! How could Yang Kai just kill him? If he really did such a thing, Medicine Pill Valley would never let this matter rest.

“What nonsense are you talking about…” Yang Kai denied vehemently, “It’s nothing of that sort. You have quite a rich imagination, Yao’er.”

“Then why don’t you dare to look me in the eye while you’re talking to me!” Ji Yao coldly snorted.

“Fine, I’ll look at you! It’s not like I’m afraid of you!” Yang Kai turned around with eyes as wide as chicken eggs as he stared aggressively at Ji Yao.

The beautiful eyes in front of him were clear and without flaw, clean as a pure spring. Yang Kai could see himself clearly reflected in Ji Yao’s eyes, mottled by her long lashes that were curved like dancing spirits, making them appear even more pure and unique.

“Hmph!” Ji Yao sneered, “You think you’re going to look any less guilty just because you widen your eyes at me like that? Don’t think I don’t know what you’re thinking.”

[I’m thinking of the time when I saw you stripped naked at Phoenix Nest Palace!]

“That little brat obviously isn’t the type to just let matters drop. He may act submissive after you beat him up a little, but he actually hates you to death in his heart. He’s young and shallow, thinking he can get away with things just by putting on a little show, but in truth, who of us does not know that he only wanted to leave here quickly in order to contact Medicine Pill Valley to complain? You obviously think that there’ll be no evidence if he’s dead, that’s why you’re planning to kill him, aren’t you?”

Yang Kai’s face was sullen, “So, what better solution do you have when things are already like this?”

This time he didn’t deny it anymore. He was just curious whether he made it seem that obvious. Otherwise, how did Ji Yao see through him at just a glance?

“Regardless, killing him isn’t the answer!” Ji Yao frowned, “If you really killed him, then things will truly become troublesome. Or so to say, you shouldn’t have hit him like that just now. If you didn’t want to deal with the fallout, you shouldn’t have stirred up this mess in the first place. You’re a Palace Master now, yet you still act so recklessly!”

“I shouldn’t have hit him?” Yang Kai jumped up like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, “I don’t even know who that little brat thinks he is! Throwing his weight around my High Heaven Palace, even trying to molest my people, yet still daring to speak so impertinently? You tell me I shouldn’t have hit him, but I would have killed him right then if I could! Letting him leave High Heaven Palace alive is already very magnanimous of me!”

“Who’s your person?” Zhu Qing said, blushing.

“I said what I said, why do you care about all that?” Yang Kai waved her off impatiently, “If he knew his mistake, then I could let him be, but if he’s secretly thinking about how he’s going to get revenge, how could I allow that!”

“How chivalrous of you!” Ji Yao may be complimenting him on the surface, but her eyes were filled with ridicule, “Are all you men like this?”

“This has nothing to do with chivalry!” Yang Kai suddenly said in a sullen voice, “This is just proper moral conduct!”

“I don’t blame you for hitting him just now… Even I wanted nothing more than to hit him,” Ji Yao pursed her lips, easing her attitude a little bit, “Only, you shouldn’t try and silence him by killing now.”

“Didn’t you stop me from doing anything?” Yang Kai bristled.

“It would’ve been over if you’d really done it. When that happens, you would have been the unreasonable one even if your reason for acting was valid,” Ji Yao sighed, “I think you’ve just let your anger get to your head, and that’s what got you thinking about doing something so foolish.”

“Say whatever you want,” Yang Kai put on the face of a dead pig that didn’t fear boiling water, remaining obstinate while Ji Yao lectured him.

Ji Yao was both angered and amused, “You’ve been in the Star Boundary for so many years now, so how can you not know how these young people are? He doesn’t represent Medicine Pill Valley. He’s just a second-generation disciple of Medicine Pill Valley…”

“Second-generation disciple?” Yang Kai raised a brow.

“En,” Ji Yao nodded and explained, “Medicine Pill Valley is where the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor cultivates in seclusion. His few Legacy Disciples under him are the first generation, all of whom are Emperor Alchemists with profound attainments in the Alchemic Dao. The Wondrous Pill Great Emperor stopped accepting disciples long ago, so the disciples taken in by his few Legacy Disciples are the second generation. Naturally, Li Xuan is one of them.”

“In that case… it doesn’t seem to be as big of a deal anymore,” Yang Kai stroked his chin thoughtfully. The only one he was really afraid of was the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, but if what Ji Yao said was true, then the situation wasn’t unsalvageable.

Li Xuan and Wondrous Pill Great Emperor were separated by a generation, so the only one Li Xuan could rely on would be one of Wondrous Pill Great Emperor’s Legacy Disciples.

Yang Kai was also an Emperor Alchemist, so why would he need to fear this unknown figure?

What’s more, no matter how the matter was put, Li Xuan was the one who asked to be humiliated himself, using his identity as a Medicine Pill Valley disciple to put on airs. If his Master was a reasonable man, then he wouldn’t blame Yang Kai and High Heaven Palace for this matter.

Of course, he couldn’t expect him to thank him either. This unknown Master’s disciple had been punished by an outsider, so they would definitely feel uncomfortable. If this Master was small-minded, they might even come to look for trouble.

“So, do you still want to silence the witness to the crime?” Ji Yao asked.

Yang Kai laughed and waved his hand, “What are you talking about? What silencing the witness to the crime? Such frightening words you speak Yao’er. This Palace Master is scared of hurting an ant even while sweeping the floor and covers all his lamps to protect the moths. How could I do such a thing?”

The three women rolled their eyes at him in unison.

“Though there’s not much to worry about, it doesn’t hurt to be careful. I think it would be best if I return to Ice Heart Valley and ask about the situation for you. That Li Xuan’s Senior Brother is currently at our Ice Heart Valley,” Ji Yao said after some thought.

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded.

Ji Yao turned and left.

Yang Kai then looked to the side and shouted, “What have you been hiding there for? Come out!”

A ripple suddenly appeared in the air like a stone tossed into a calm lake, quickly revealing Nanmen Da Jun’s figure.

“Palace Master’s might is matchless, this Nanmen admires you greatly!” Nanmen Da Jun walked over with a flattering smile on his face.

“Enough of that, why are you here?” Yang Kai looked in askance at him.

Who knew what this old fogey was sneaking around and hiding here this whole time for? However, Yang Kai didn’t really care about this. Naturally, with Nanmen Da Jun’s current identity as High Heaven Palace’s Chief Array Master, it was impossible for him to mean any harm to him.

Nanmen Da Jun immediately answered, “This subordinate has prepared something good for Palace Master!”

“Something good?”

Nanmen Da Jun grinned meaningfully and said mysteriously, “Please, take a look!”

…..

“I’ll kill him, I’ll kill him, I’ll kill him…”

Atop the deck of his ship, Li Xuan had a hate-filled look on his face as he constantly cursed in a quiet voice.

What happened was a great shame to him. He had a noble identity as a Medicine Pill Valley disciple and was certain to become an Emperor Alchemist in the future. How could he endure such humiliation? Just as Ji Yao said, he may act submissive on the surface, but he was actually plotting how to get his revenge the whole time.

After flying all the way to a deserted mountain valley, he landed his ship.

After putting away his flight type artifact, the look of hatred on his face had already become warped. Feeling the burning pain on his cheeks, he slammed his fist fiercely down onto a giant boulder in front of him, sending debris flying everywhere together with a cloud of dust. Li Xuan was throwing out his power wantonly, seemingly wanting to vent all his rage and grievances.

After a long time, he panted and sat down on the ground, taking out a healing pill from his Space Ring and swallowing it. His eyes turned with a dark and unkind look as he cursed, “You’ll all die!”

As he said that, he took out his communication artifact and using his Divine Sense, used it to send a message.

Millions of kilometres away, inside the headquarters of Fire Dragon Palace, a top Sect in the Northern Territory, in a certain place overflowing with abundant World Energy.

This place was only a dozen kilometres across, but even within Fire Dragon Palace, it was considered a Restricted Area that only a few Elders and Palace Master Li Jiao were qualified to step foot into.

That was because this was where the Sect’s precious spirit medicine garden was located.

The number of spirit medicines cultivated in the medicine garden was not large, only about a hundred or so, but each one was Emperor Grade, extremely precious. Any one of these Spirit Herbs would be a rare existence to find outside. The entire garden was filled with dense World Energy and overflowing medicinal fragrance. Any cultivator visiting here would be able to improve their cultivation a lot just by breathing in lightly.

At this moment, three people were sitting at a table in the pavilion next to the medicine garden.

The one on the left, dressed in a graceful and luxurious purple robe with a chiselled mouth and nostrils, appearing quite furious at this moment, was the Palace Master of Fire Dragon Palace, Li Jiao.

On the right, a man with an extraordinary aura that looked to be about forty or so, but whose real age was obviously far greater, had a solemn expression on his face; it was the Sect Master of another top Sect in the Northern Territory, Full Sky Sect’s Mi Qi!

It was not surprising for the two of them to gather together. Since Yang Kai destroyed Seeking Passion Sect, these two top Sects had grown much closer. Just as Bing Yun said, they were wary of Yang Kai’s High Heaven Palace, so they naturally wanted to huddle together for warmth.

The one sitting at the centre was a middle-aged man whose cultivation was only Second-Order Emperor Realm, a Minor Realm lower than Li Jiao and Mi Qi. However, in terms of their attitude towards him, it could be seen that both Li Jiao and Mi Qi regarded this person with much respect, and it could also be said that they had a small mind to ingratiate themselves to him.

There were not many people in this world who could attract such respect from two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters, even causing them to be somewhat anxious and wary about how they spoke, but the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor’s Legacy Disciple certainly was among these figures.

This man was the last disciple of the Wondrous Pill Great Emperor, ranked fifth, Emperor Alchemist Ji Ying.

The ten-year collection of Spirit Herbs for Medicine Pill Valley could naturally not be left to a Junior like Li Xuan. This time, Ji Ying had been the one to lead the collection team to visit all the various top Sects, but Ji Ying had encountered something that delayed his trip as soon as he arrived in Fire Dragon Palace, so he had no choice but to send his two disciples to Ice Heart Valley and High Heaven Palace.

He knew as well that his disciple, Li Xuan, was usually a little lustful, that was why he sent his other disciple to Ice Heart Valley instead, lest this little brat get himself caught up in the flower field, affecting his mood to cultivate.

But lust was not a big problem; after all, Li Xuan was young and hot-blooded. After studying Alchemy at Medicine Pill Valley all year round, it was only natural that he would feel somewhat pent up for women.

In Ji Ying’s opinion, both Disciples he accepted were fine seedlings, and as long as he gave them a little guidance, then even if they did not achieve as much as he did, they would not be much worse. Moreover, they usually behaved respectfully, so he was quite at ease to send them off on this little errand.
