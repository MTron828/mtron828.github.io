“It’s really no use.” Yang Kai felt somewhat speechless as he looked at Zhu Qing lying on the bed.

He displayed the Dragon Transformation Secret Art once again. This time, however, there wasn’t any significant change, as his height still remained at 45 meters, with completely no increase at all.

Raising her snow white body, which was covered by the bedsheet, Zhu Qing frowned slightly as she replied: “I’ve already told you, so why don’t you believe me?”

Thinking about it now, it wasn’t a question of whether he believed her or not, but a result of the rise of his lecherous side that he wanted to go all the way with.

Dispelling the Dragon Transformation Secret Art, Yang Kai chuckled: “We only tried a few times. If we do it a few more times, it might work…”

Right as he finished his sentence, he leapt back onto the bed. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Stop messing around,” Zhu Qing reached out and pushed him away, shooting him a glare. “Dragons are lascivious by nature, the stronger your Source the more you would need to restrain yourself.”

During these few days of their intimate relations, Zhu Qing had always behaved submissively. However, now, she suddenly expressed her views solemnly, with a look of authority. Yang Kai could not help but look at her in bewilderment. It was as though she was a completely different person.

He could only bob his head and agree. “Alright, alright. I’ll control myself. Just that… If all those in the Dragon Clan are like this, how exactly do you live with it?”

Zhu Qing said, “Only the males of the Clan are like this. They also won’t act so presumptuously in front of the other Dragon Clan Members on Dragon Island.”

Yang Kai’s eyes widened. “Then what if they… need it?”

Zhu Qing had no desire to answer his question but knew that he could continue to pester her about it, so she could only frown and state. “They have their own ways.”

This statement inevitably made Yang Kai’s imagination run wild. Some funny scenes came to mind, and he could not help but chuckle. He was ready to meet Zhu Lie again and make fun of him.

Zhu Qing stared at him and reprimanded. “Didn’t I tell you not to touch me without my consent?”

Yang Kai made an innocent expression and asked. “But didn’t you give me your consent? I swore you did.”

“Just don’t do that next time!” Zhu Qing pinched Yang Kai’s arm to vent her frustration and then started to get dressed.

Yang Kai propped his head up on one hand and enjoyed looking at her, giggling.

“What are you staring at me for?” Zhu Qing became flushed.

“You are just too beautiful.” Sweet words started to spew from his mouth. “I can just stare at you for the rest of my life.”

“I wonder how many women you’ve said this to before?” Zhu Qing’s question carried a strong tinge of jealousy, she quickly organized her dress and blankly looked around before asking. “Where’s Ah Wang?”

“Guarding the door.” Yang Kai pointed at the door.

Zhu Qing just recalled that the black puppy had seemed to have been driven out by Yang Kai. She then recalled that several princesses were standing outside the door. Soon, her beautiful face lost all colour. It was clear that what they did was heard.

She did not know how she could possibly see people now…

She was so ashamed and annoyed that she reached out and grabbed Yang Kai’s ear. “Why are you not getting up yet!?”

Abiding her order, Yang Kai got up. He was completely naked. Although not stout, his body was quite well proportioned. He exuded an aura of masculinity. Facing the embarrassed Zhu Qing, he simply laughed and played dumb.

Zhu Qing gave him an angry look. Her eyes were wandering here and there. She was trying to look away from where she shouldn’t be looking. She picked up his clothes from the bed and started carefully dressing him.

It was the first time the dragon girl was doing this, so she was a little unfamiliar. Men’s clothes had always been a little different from women’s, and having never had the experience of serving others, and the fact that Yang Kai was standing right opposite to her, her hands and feet were tied.

After gasping through for a good while, she slowly got better and gradually dressed Yang Kai neatly.

She then grabbed Yang Kai’s hand again, leading him to the vanity mirror beside her and pushed Yang Kai down on the chair, sitting him down and cautiously grooming his hair.

Yang Kai was staring at the figure in the mirror with a smile hanging on his face. And seeing her serious and focused look, his pride skyrocketed.

…

Half a day later, the Human Sovereign came in a hurry. And when he arrived at the gate of the palace, he looked at his daughters standing outside in surprise, “Why are you standing outside?”

Fu Yu replied, pursing her lips, “He made us stay here.”

The Human Sovereign furrowed his brow. “Has it been like this these days?”

Fu Yu gently nodded.

The Human Sovereign heaved a sigh as a look of disappointment flashed in his eyes, but nothing else. He just reported aloud, “Sir, there has been some progress about the news you have been looking for.”

The door of the hall was pushed open as Yang Kai and Zhu Qing walked out in succession.

The princesses had varying expressions on their faces. Second Princess Fu Yu couldn’t hide the look of contempt in her eyes, especially when she looked at Zhu Qing. The Sixth Princess lowered her head; it was hard to see the expression on her face. The Eleventh Princess, on the other hand, was making seductive gestures, looking at Yang Kai with great interest, as if she was secretly expecting something. But the next moment, the princess turned pale and quietly slipped behind the Sixth Sister, shuddering.

Their reaction didn’t remain hidden from Yang Kai. He coldly snorted in his heart, noticing it. But he didn’t have time to care about that. He focused his gaze on the Human Sovereign and asked, “Tell me about it.”

The Human Sovereign replied, “About thirty minutes ago, there were signs of someone fighting at Eagle Beak Cliff. This Old Master immediately sent someone to investigate, but by the time he reached there, the battle was already over. He found a dozen or so dead Demon Race members, all of whose cultivation was quite extraordinary.”

“Did you find who did it?”

The Human Sovereign shook his head. “No, it’s just that all the Humans in the Revolving World live in Human Sovereign City. I’m afraid that no one apart from the two of you could remain outside. And more importantly, they don’t have the strength to kill a dozen or so Demon Race members. So, this Old Master thinks that the person you are looking for is probably near Eagle Beak Cliff.”

Yang Kai, after nodding and pondering for a moment, suggested, “If that’s the case, then let’s go and have a look.”

The Human Sovereign agreed, “The Old Master will immediately arrange someone to lead the way.”

“No need, I know the place. My wife and I will go and check it out on our own.” These past few days, Yang Kai had clearly memorized the layout of the Revolving World. So, he knew where Eagle Beak Cliff was when the Human Sovereign mentioned it.

“Sir and Madam, please be careful.”

Yang Kai pursed his lips into a smile. “If everything goes well, we may directly leave this world. Thank you for your hospitality.”

Hearing this, the Human Sovereign happily smiled. He wished that Yang Kai would go away as soon as possible, lest his rule was shaken. Naturally, he was overjoyed after hearing this. He quickly suppressed his excitement and calmly stated, “Sir and Madam, please forgive this Old Master if this Old Master has not looked after you well.”

His face didn’t match his words. And Yang Kai was also too lazy to haggle with him. Just as he was about to call Zhu Qing to leave, he suddenly caught a glimpse of Fu Yu still staring at Zhu Qing with a look of contempt. Her face was filled with disdain. This immediately annoyed him a little.

Suddenly, an idea clicked Yang Kai as he stretched his hand out to Ah Wang and ordered, “Ah Wang, let’s go!”

“Woof!” The black puppy stood up and threateningly barked at Fu Yu before slowly making its way to Yang Kai.

“What!? What did you say?” Yang Kai stared at the black puppy with widened eyes.

“Woof!” The black puppy titled his head, wondering what the hell Yang Kai was up to.

“What!? That’s impossible. You bastard, how can you even think like that? That’s simply outrageous.”

The black puppy was completely dumbstruck. It stupidly stood in his spot, completely confused.

Yang Kai continued, ignoring it, “One should have a sense of propriety. As a dog, you should know your limit. You shouldn’t think about what you shouldn’t, you just shouldn’t, understand!? Thankfully this Young Master is here, otherwise, you would have been beaten and eaten by him.” While he was speaking, he leisurely glanced at the Human Sovereign.

Everyone was left confused and disoriented by him. The princesses were even more confused. Fu Yu slightly frowned. Instinctively, she felt something wasn’t right, but she couldn’t think what was wrong?

But the Human Sovereign was smart and shrewd. He immediately snickered and asked, “Sir, I wonder what your pet wants to do? If you don’t mind, can you tell this Old Master. If this Old Master can satisfy it, this Old Master will definitely fulfill it.”

Yang Kai replied with a chuckle, “It’s nothing. It just made an interesting request. You don’t need to care about it.”

The Human Sovereign criticized in his heart but still asked, “If it’s interesting, why not tell us? There is no harm telling us.”

Yang Kai pointed at Fu Yu. “This Bastard has actually come to take a liking to the Second Princess. It has hit it off with the Second Princess and actually wants to take her with it. Don’t you find it funny?”

The smile on the Human Sovereign’s face immediately froze. He really didn’t know how he should answer as a drop of cold sweat trickled down the corner of his forehead.

Blood immediately drained from Fu Yu’s pretty face as she cried in horror, “Impossible!”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold as he asked, “Why is it impossible?”

Fu Yu replied, panicked, “How…how can it like me? You are clearly talking through your hat.”

Yang Kai added with a snort, “When it’s impossible for me to like you, but you have still taken a liking to me. I can’t do anything, can I? Probably, after having been looking at you for a long while, it has been attracted to you. If you don’t believe me, you can ask yourself.”

“How…how can I ask?” Fu Yu was completely dumbfounded. She really couldn’t ask the black puppy this question. Although she was sure that Yang Kai was taking revenge on her, the current situation was more complex than she realized. She might really be carried off and be reduced into a beast’s plaything.

She would rather die than be subjected to this. How could she even agree to it?

“Imperial Father!” She hurriedly looked at the Human Sovereign, trying to ask for his help. But what entered her eyes next caused her words to be stuck in her throat. Because she noticed a tight frown on her Imperial Father’s face. He appeared to be in deep thought as if he was considering whether to agree to this or not.

In an instant, all her hopes shattered to pieces. She lost all her strength.

[Imperial Father is really considering giving me to that beast!]

[That’s right, the Imperial Father is very afraid of these debauchers. If he can send them away without any accident, not to mention one daughter, he will gift all his daughters without even a frown.]

[Since ancient times, the Imperial Family has been devoid of any familial love. Who knows what I was expecting?]

The Human Sovereign’s lips parted. But before he could speak anything, Yang Kai chuckled. “Second Princess, don’t worry. Even though Ah Wang likes you, I can’t take you with us. Second Princess will be staying in Human Sovereign City, being a good princess.”

Fu Yu didn’t utter a word. She just glared at him with extreme hatred. It looked like she could not wait to eat his flesh and drink his blood.

“By the looks of it, it seems the Second Princess would like to come with me! If that’s the case, you can tell me. It’s not like this Young Master can’t consider it.” Yang Kai raised the corner of his lips.

Fu Yu hurriedly lowered her head. She didn’t dare to take another look at him, lest he started making things difficult for her again.

“Hmph!” The Human Sovereign coldly snorted. At this moment, how could he not realize that Yang Kai was deliberately making things difficult for her? [Presumably, Fu Yu had looked at the dragon girl with a wrongful gaze.] He looked at Fu Yu and ordered, “Why are you still not thanking Sir!?”

How could Fu Yu dare to disobey him? Left with no choice, she stepped forward and elegantly bowed, thanking Yang Kai in a low voice. “Thank you, Sir!”

Her arrogance had been completely worn out.
