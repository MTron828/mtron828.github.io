“When did I ever flirt with other women?” Yang Kai was guilty, so the way he spoke was diffident. [Wait a moment. Yes, I’ve indeed gotten together with a new woman, but I’ve only confessed that to my mother and Su Yan, so how did Shan Qing Luo find out about it? She must be bluffing me! Whatever she accuses me of, I’ll not admit it!]

Shan Qing Luo sneered and looked down at Liu Yan, “You’ve even conceived a child, yet you still dare to say you didn’t hook up with other women?” Then, she turned milder and crouched down, “Little girl, what’s your mother’s name?”

Yang Kai saw this and laughed confidently as he stroked Liu Yan’s head, “Ask all you want.”

He suddenly understood why Shan Qing Luo treated him in such a weird way upon seeing him, because she thought that he had brought his daughter back with him. [She must feel very bitter now. Anyway, if I weren’t there when Liu Yan’s body was restructured in the past, I wouldn’t have been able to recognise her either, to say nothing of the fact that Shan Qing Luo hasn’t met her for decades. So, a misunderstanding is bound to happen; after all, Liu Yan did indeed go through a transformative change.]

“Tell her who you are!” Yang Kai grinned at Liu Yan.

Liu Yan appeared timid as her eyelashes fluttered. Grabbing the hem of Yang Kai’s clothes, she hid behind him and uttered in a small voice, “Daddy, I don’t want to stay here. This aunty is so strange.”

The smile on Yang Kai’s face froze as he stared at Liu Yan with widened eyes, feeling as if a knife had just been stabbed into his back.

“Hahaha…” Shan Qing Luo scoffed and slowly rose from the chair before glaring at him, “What else do you have to say?”

“What am I supposed to say?” An enraged Yang Kai made Liu Yan face him and glowered at her, “How can you do this to me? I’ve treated you so well over the years… why must you harm me like this!?”

Tears almost slid down Liu Yan’s face as she cried out, “Daddy, you’re hurting me!”

“Enough!” Shan Qing Luo bellowed and pulled Liu Yan behind her back before she glared fiercely at Yang Kai, “How can you bully a child? Is this what you’re supposed to do as a father?”

Yang Kai found it difficult to explain himself, so he embraced her and uttered, “Luo’er, this is a misunderstanding. Please hear me out.”

“There’s no need for any explanation!” Shan Qing Luo pushed him away with a cold expression, “I guess I’ve gotten together with the wrong man. From now on, we’re no longer husband and wife. Don’t come looking for me again!”

As if struck by lightning, Yang Kai shuddered as the colour drained from his face. Standing beside Shan Qing Luo, out of her line of sight, Liu Yan stuck out her tongue.

[Argh! It seems that I’ve crossed the line…]

On the other hand, Bi Luo appeared excited. If what was happening was really happening, she would still stand a chance! Although it was improper to take advantage of the situation when they were going through a crisis, she reckoned that she had to do it to save Shan Qing Luo from this mess.

“Luo’er, are you sure?” Yang Kai looked solemnly at her.

A glint of fluster flashed across her eyes, but she still nodded steadfastly, “I’ve made up my mind.”

Appearing dejected, Yang Kai turned around and gave it a thought before he heaved a sigh, “Forget it, then. I’ve made many mistakes in the past because of my recklessness. Now, I’m not willing to hold you back. Luo’er, please take care of yourself.”

Shan Qing Luo’s chest tightened as she hurriedly questioned, “Where are you going?”

Nevertheless, Yang Kai jumped onto the windowsill and waved his hand. Following that, he plunged into the darkness and disappeared from her sight.

“Hey! Come back!” Shan Qing Luo was flustered, as she didn’t expect that he’d really go.

[How could he leave just like that? I was just pulling his leg because I was mad at the fact that he’d left for so many years. Why did he act so hasty and decisively? Why didn’t he even try to coax me?] She rushed towards the window and yelled, “Come back! Come back here right now!”

No one replied to her as all she saw was endless darkness. With her eyes turning bloodshot, she collapsed to the ground and muttered, “Come… back… you heartless bastard!”

Just then, a muscular figure approached her from behind as he pressed his broad chest against her back and gently wrapped his arms around her waist. Following that, he uttered close to her ear in a deep voice, “I was just pulling a prank on you!”

With her eyes already drenched in tears, Shan Qing Luo turned around and thumped her fists against the man’s chest, but she didn’t seem to have exerted any force at all. Rather than venting out her anger, she seemed to be acting coquettishly.

Yang Kai grinned at her without moving a muscle. After pounding his chest for a while, Shan Qing Luo suddenly draped her arms around his neck and landed a kiss on his lips.

“Mmm…” At that instant, Yang Kai found it hard to breathe. The body in his embrace was warm and her soft tongue swiftly snuck into his mouth like a snake and did whatever it wanted. Certainly, Yang Kai had to fight back, so he grabbed her twin peaks and fiddled with them, which caused her body to turn completely limp as she collapsed into his embrace.

A long time later, their lips parted as a thread of saliva still hung between them.

Shan Qing Luo’s alluring gaze was just like a blooming flower, which gleamed with a charming glow. Suddenly thinking of something, she said with a red face, “Your daughter…”

She was so engrossed just now that she had forgotten about the little girl. Although she was quite bold when it came to the affairs of men and women, she was still embarrassed at this moment.

“They’ve already left,” Yang Kai put on a smile.

Earlier, seeing that they were about to make out, Bi Luo and Liu Yan immediately left the room. At this moment, only two of them were left in Shan Qing Luo’s bedroom as the atmosphere turned intimate.

Shan Qing Luo looked around and realised that he was right. Both Bi Luo and the little girl were already nowhere in sight. With no more worries, she cupped the man’s face and thoroughly examined it. Despite her loving gaze, she still scolded, “What a heartless guy. I was just playing with you. How could you hurt me like this?”

Yang Kai reached out and helped tuck her hair behind her ears. His eyes also appeared loving, as though he wanted to suck the woman in front of him into his gaze to relieve his longing for the past decades. In a gentle voice, he uttered, “I’m sorry.”

Shan Qing Luo replied, “You have to be punished for what you’ve done.”

Yang Kai asked with a smile, “Luo’er, how are you going to punish me?”

In response, Shan Qing Luo raised her hand and placed it on his chest before beaming at him, “I hope you’ll be able to endure it and not pass away.”

Upon finishing her words, she released her Saint Qi through her palm and sent the man flying backwards. She was now in the Third-Order Origin King Realm, so her control of her Saint Qi had reached an extreme. Therefore, her attack wouldn’t cause any harm to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai placed his hands on the back of his head and flew towards the wall, but he didn’t seem worried at all. He just looked smilingly at her as he wondered what she was up to.

Shan Qing Luo slowly got up and opened her mouth, upon which a gust of Saint Qi shot out from her lips and whizzed past Yang Kai before turning into a spider web, which hung in mid-air.

Yang Kai crashed into the web and immediately felt that his back was stuck. He tried to struggle, but instead of struggling out of it, he realised that more parts of his body were stuck to the web, including his hands.

[This seems quite exciting.]

He gulped at the sight as his blood started boiling. His eyes appeared lustful and fiery as he stared at Shan Qing Luo, as though he was trying to burn all the clothes on her body.

“Hahaha…” Shan Qing Luo covered her mouth and giggled. Hearing her intoxicating laughter, Yang Kai felt as though his bones had turned soft.

Then, she raised her hand, upon which the door and windows were shut at the same time. Following that, she lightly stepped toward Yang Kai as she took off her clothes and revealed her fair hourglass body. Her skin was so delicate that it looked as translucent as white jade. Her plump bosom swayed as she stepped forward in a seductive rhythm. The red cherries on the tip of her peaks looked like two swirls that were capable of hypnotizing any man. There was no excess fat or muscle on any part of her slender figure, and her long lithe legs and delicate feet looked so delicious they would cause a man to salivate over them.

With his throat turning dry, Yang Kai uttered in a restrained voice, “You seductress, what are you trying to do?”

Shan Qing Luo climbed up the spider web as the most precious treasure between her legs was faintly exposed. She looked down at Yang Kai in an aloof manner, as if a deity was examining her own territory impassively, and she replied, “What do you think?”

Soon, she stuck out her red tongue and licked her lips, which made her appear even more seductive.

At that instant, Yang Kai was about to lose control. Fortunately, he had some fun with Su Yan not too long ago. Otherwise, he might forcefully struggle out of the web and pin Shan Qing Luo down on the floor. Unlike the reserved Su Yan, Shan Qing Luo had always been unrestrained when it came to their bedroom activities. She was able to give Yang Kai a sense of wanton and immoral pleasure that he couldn’t receive from other women; however, it was their first time engaging in such an exciting game.

It seemed that there were still some benefits that came with their decades of separation. At the very least, it had unlocked some chains in the deepest parts of these women’s hearts. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Shan Qing Luo raised her leg and gently slid it down Yang Kai’s shirt, which caused robes to rip apart and revealed his muscular figure. Her gaze appeared cold and elegant as she licked her lips, “I wonder how many women have enjoyed your body over the years.”

Yang Kai replied in a steadfast manner, “There’s no such thing.” Although he was lying, he couldn’t admit it at this moment.

Shan Qing Luo waved her hand and shredded the rest of his clothes before declaring, “How dare you lie to me! If I don’t teach you a lesson today, you’ll probably forget how fierce I am.”

In response, Yang Kai grinned at her, “Luo’er, please teach me a lesson immediately. I can’t wait!”

Then, she rode on top of his body and leaned close to him. Following that, she licked his earlobe and puffed out a breath that smelled as pleasant as orchids, “Aren’t you afraid I’ll eat you down to the last bone?”

Yang Kai replied, “I heard that there’s a kind of spider called black widow that eats her male partner after they mate. Luo’er, are you going to do just that?”

“En, I just might!”

Without a warning, Yang Kai stuck out his waist and thrust against her, causing her to straighten up. As her long hair swayed in the air, she shrieked, but her expression suggested that rather than a sense of pain and panic, she was in a state of euphoria, “Damn it! Why didn’t you warn me first? Ah…”

Yang Kai chimed in, “Why should I warn you when you’re going to eat me? Let’s see who will be the one who feasts today! Luo’er, you mustn’t be defeated too soon.”

Shan Qing Luo gritted her teeth as her body swung in the air along with his movements. Intermittently, she uttered, “You’re… doomed! I… will never… go easy… on you!”

Seeing the tall mountains and deep valleys before him quaking back and forth, Yang Kai grabbed onto them and rubbed them vigorously, causing Shan Qing Luo to scowl and moan louder. The huge spider web swayed in the air as two naked bodies entangled with each other in the bedroom.

Soon, a strange smell permeated the air.
