Chapter 1741, Arriving One After Another

This time, Gu Jian Xin had set off from Sword Union’s Home Star for Azure Tree Star on some kind of business, and Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Miao had followed along. Never had they imagined they would get involved in such a battle and almost lose their lives.

After finishing her story, He Zao did not ask Yang Kai about his experiences over the years as she was aware her status and identity were not high enough to know.

Yang Kai nodded faintly and said, “By the way, how much do you know about your Young Union Master, Gu Jian Xin?”

“Young Union Master?” He Zao was startled, “Does Big Brother Yang want to know more about the Young Union Master?”

“En,” Yang Kai was satisfied seeing her understand his intent. “Tell me whatever is convenient for you to disclose.”

He Zao smiled lightly, “I don’t know much actually, so there’s nothing inconvenient to talk about. Young Union Master can be said to be the most talented genius in Sword Union in the past thousand years. He is currently less than sixty but has already reached the peak of the Origin Realm. There are also rumours that he will be able to break through to the Origin King Realm within three to five years!”

Yang Kai nodded while sipping his tea, motioning her to continue speaking with his eyes.

He had already learned this information from Liu Dong before.

“Young Union Master is humble, respectful, and righteous. He is the successor Union Master has placed his hopes on. Not only is his cultivation high, but his combat strength is also excellent as well. It seems that only Xue Yue, Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce’s Third Young Master, and Purple Star’s Zi Dong are able to compete with him among the younger generation of the Star Field.”

“Is that so...” Hearing this, another person suddenly appeared in Yang Kai’s mind.

Xu Bin Bai!

The interesting young man Yang Kai met outside Green Mountains Star’s Blood Prison that day! It was said that he was the Disciple of an Origin King Realm master named Wu Dao. This Wu Dao’s cultivation was so profound that even Green Mountains Star’s Star Master Luo Hai was extremely respectful of him, addressing him as Senior Wu Dao!

Wu Dao was no doubt a genuine Third-Order Origin King and one of the divine dragons who one could never catch sight of.

The disciple of such a person could not be worse than Gu Jian Xin, Xue Yue, or Zi Dong, perhaps even slightly stronger, but this thought lingered in Yang Kai’s mind for just a second, and he did not annunciate it.

He Zao had lived in Sword Union for a long time and her strength was not very high, so the things she had come into contact with were quite limited, making her vision somewhat narrow.

“Young Union Master’s reputation in Sword Union is also excellent. If not, Honoured Master would not have chosen to follow him. En, Young Union Master is always accompanied by his Left and Right Sword Servants. I’ve heard that they have cultivated together since childhood and are like brother and sisters.”

“Probably not just brother and sisters,” Yang Kai chuckled.

When the Left and Right Sword Servants looked at Gu Jian Xin, there was clearly more than just friendship in their eyes. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He Zao pursed her lips as a trace of crimson filled her cheeks. Squeezing her dress slightly, she didn’t respond to Yang Kai’s comment and instead continued, “The Left Sword Servant is called Ling Yue while the Right Sword Servant is called An Xing. Young Union Master and his Left and Right Sword Servants have cultivated a profound method together known as the Sun, Moon, and Stars Secret Techniques. Combined, the three of them can exert a combat power far beyond their own cultivation level. However, even without the assistance of his Left and Right Sword Servants, the personal combat power of the Young Union Master alone is very strong, and an ordinary Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cannot possibly be his opponent.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

Whether a cultivator was powerful or not was often discernable at a glance. Gu Jian Xin gave Yang Kai a powerful feeling.

Clearly, Gu Jian Xin belonged to the elite of the elite!

“This is everything I know,” After He Zao finished speaking, she looked towards Yang Kai respectfully, as if waiting for his next instructions.

“Then Gu Jian Xin’s trip to Azure Tree Star this time, do you know what its purpose is?”

“I don’t, we were simply following orders. We didn’t even know where we were sailing to until Young Union Master mentioned it,” He Zao shook her head.

“Big Brother Yang, you are asking so many questions, so are you planning on being enemies with Young Union Master?” He Miao asked with some worry.

Yang Kai laughed and shook his head, “Why would I? There’s no grudge between us so how could I become Gu Jian Xin’s enemy? Besides, Gu Jian Xin should be a good person. However, since I have boarded his Starship, I naturally want to learn more about him. You don’t need to be so nervous.”

“Oh,” He Miao relaxed greatly while her little hand patted her rather well-endowed peaks, a relieved expression filling her face.

He Zao and He Miao were only Third-Order Saint Kings, and although they were somewhat young, they had a chance of becoming pillars of Sword Union in the years to come, but that was a matter for the future. With their current cultivation and status, they naturally did not have access to much high-level information.

To them, their current lives could be summed up in two words.

Follow orders!

There was no need to ask anything or even think too much, they simply needed to follow orders from above. Even if it was a task which would cost them their lives, they had no choice but to obey.

This was the sorrowful fate of cultivators at the bottom of great forces. These cultivators seemed to receive excellent shelter, but they lost some of their freedom in exchange. If Yang Kai really wanted to be an enemy of Gu Jian Xin, He Zao and He Miao would be put in a difficult position.

Afterwards, Yang Kai continued his conversation with He Zao and He Miao before asking them to leave.

“Big Brother Yang...” Before leaving though, He Zao suddenly turned around and called out.

“Is there something else?” Yang Kai looked at her.

He Zao bit her red lips lightly for a moment before shaking her head, “It’s nothing, please have a good rest. If you need anything, just summon us. We live in the fiftieth room of this wing.”

“Sure,” Yang Kai nodded suspiciously.

After sending the sisters off, Yang Kai stood there and pondered for a moment. He Zao must have wanted to say something to him just now, but ultimately decided not to.

Although he had only met these two sisters twice, after the experience back on the floating continent a couple dozen years ago, sharing adversity together, they could be considered quite close.

The encounter this time had reaffirmed their bond of friendship.

If He Zao really asked him for help, Yang Kai would not refuse, unfortunately, it seemed she had concerns of her own and decided not to say anything, making it tricky for Yang Kai to ask as well.

“Big sister, did you want Big Brother Yang to speak on our behalf?” He Miao asked He Zao when they returned to their own room.

“En,” He Zao nodded lightly as she said quietly. “Now, only Big Brother Yang can help us. Even Honoured Master is unable to solve this problem.”

“So why didn’t you say anything? Big Brother Yang is a good person, so he would definitely not sit back and watch if you asked.”

“I believe so too...” He Zao sat down on the edge of the bed. “But this matter has nothing to do with him; it’s our own affair.”

“Elder Sister...” He Miao lay down and rested her head on He Zao’s lap while whispering sadly. “If we don’t do something, we’ll really have to... with that person...”

He Zao reached out her hand a brushed He Miao’s hair, a trace of sorrow also appearing on her pretty face, “En, if it weren’t for Senior Qin’s shelter all those years ago, we and Honoured Master would not have escaped punishment and would perhaps not even be alive today. He is Senior Qin’s son, and it is precisely because of this that Honoured Master was unable to refuse Senior Qin’s proposal. It should be... our turn to repay him. Over the years, Senior Qin has done much for us after all.”

“I don’t want to!” He Miao stood up suddenly and displayed a fit of fierce anger as she clenched her fists and said firmly, “If that day comes, I’ll butcher that Qin Qi Yang brat first!”

He Zao was startled as she stared at He Miao in shock, quickly shouting, “You’re not allowed to talk such nonsense!”

He Miao pouted but did not speak anymore, sinking back down to the bed and falling into her big sister’s lap again.

Inside his room, Yang Kai had just sat down to meditate again when he heard another knock at the door.

This made him frown as he stood up slightly displeased and opened the door only to be met with a glamorous but slightly flustered face.

Yang Kai was stunned.

“Can I come in?” The visitor asked in a low voice as she looked around, seemingly afraid she would be discovered.

[What’s happening?] Yang Kai was even more at a loss; however, seeing the anxious look on the other party’s face, he did not refuse, moved to the side, and allowed this visitor to rush into the room, bringing with her a fragrant burst of wind.

After closing the door, Yang Kai turned to look at this beautiful woman and asked suspiciously, “Lady Yue, is there something you need to discuss with me?”

The person who had come was surprisingly the Honoured Master of He Zao and He Miao: Yue Xi!

Yang Kai was quite confused. The two sisters had only just left but now their Honoured Master had followed on their heels. What was happening here? If outsiders noticed this scene, it would certainly generate rumours about something unspeakable and shameful happening between him and these three.

“This Mistress greets Young Master Yang,” Yue Xi elegantly bowed and lightly opened her lips, saying, “This Mistress thanks Young Master Yang for his life-saving grace...”

“Speak frankly,” Yang Kai looked at her lightly.

Yue Xi’s face became stiff but soon she wore a bitter smile, bit her lips and hesitated for a moment before bluntly saying, “This Mistress wants to ask Young Master Yang to show mercy and save He Zao and He Miao from a miserable fate.”

“What’s happening to them?” Yang Kai frowned, “From what I can tell, they seem quite well without any signs of illness or injury. Is there some matter they need saving from?”

“It is true they are not ill or injured,” Yue Xi shook her head. “It’s just that they... one of them must marry a strange man, one who is not normal!”

Yang Kai squinted and stared straight at Yue Xi.

The force behind his gaze caused Yue Xi to feel quite pressured and her expression gradually became tense, a look of embarrassment and guilt flashing across her face, but soon, she raised her eyes again and stared straight at Yang Kai.

“Have a seat first, then we can talk,” To Yue Xi’s surprise, Yang Kai motioned to her to sit down then poured her a cup of tea.

“Many thanks,” Yue Xi took a deep breath and took a seat.

“I’ll need you to explain in more detail,” Yang Kai sat on the other side and asked.

Yue Xi nodded, “I should have made myself clearer. It’s like this.”

After listening to her speak, Yang Kai understood the whole story.

This matter was related to the events of that year. When Yang Kai had first met Yue Xi, she was a Third-Order Saint King and commanded a Saint King Grade Starship charged with performing some low-risk tasks in the Star Field.

During the events of that year, Sword Union had suffered huge losses. In the end, only Yue Xi, He Zao, and He Mao had survived. After returning to Sword Union’s Home Star, they faced a disaster they were unable to resolve.
