The power of the Dragon Clan’s Secret Techniques was extremely potent, but only those with the Dragon Clan’s bloodline could perform them. These illusory phantoms were clearly Secret Techniques left here by a Dragon Clan Master.

This Secret Technique would not appear in the Void Corridor for no reason though. Yang Kai hadn’t thought that the defenses of the Dragon Clan would be so tight. Dragon Island was on the other side of the Void Corridor after all, so who would dare to risk their lives just to sneak in?

Looking at the Dragon Phantoms again, it was clear as day that they were lethal existences. If Yang Kai had not used his Dragon Transformation to bolster his defences, it would have been impossible for him to stand here at this moment.

[This is a trap! It’s definitely a trap meant for somebody. A trap like this is enough to kill a Third-Order Emperor on the spot. Was it aimed at me?] A sudden thought came to mind, but Yang Kai couldn’t be certain.

While he was distracted, the Dragon Phantoms suddenly started chanting in the obscure Dragon Language. Dragon Language was the foundation supporting the Dragon Clan’s Secret Technique. On the surface, it sounded similar to the spells of the Ancient World’s Shamans; however, it was even more ancient and esoteric than that.

The Dragon Language rang out rhythmically as the Dragon Phantoms suddenly separated from each other, their voices never stopping.

Meanwhile, Li Jiao shivered uncontrollably, instinctively feeling scared. He deeply regretted coming here. [If I had known this would happen, I would have turned around and gone home just now!]

The scattered Dragon Phantoms regrouped and suddenly transformed into a huge ancient character. They loomed over Yang Kai and Li Jiao like a net that covered the skies.

Yang Kai and Li Jiao hastily retreated only to discover that no matter how they tried to escape, they could not avoid being enveloped by this ancient character. The mysterious ancient character looked like four squarish ancient characters superimposed on one another, forming a regular and orderly shape.

In that tense situation, the ancient character blanketed the two of them. Following that, a strange Principle Strength began fluctuating.

Li Jiao’s complexion turned ashen in response. He looked like he had given up. On the other hand, Yang Kai made a soft exclamation of surprise with an odd expression.

In the next moment, their visions blurred and they instantly found themselves standing in a world of nothingness. There was neither light nor sound in that space. It was even more disturbing than when they had been deep under the sea previously.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense out and sensed Li Jiao standing not too far from him. Thus, he reached out to pull him over.

“Palace Master Yang… What is this place?” Li Jiao asked, gulping hard.

“A Void Crack!” Yang Kai replied as he dispelled the Dragon Transformation Secret Art and changed back to his original appearance.

The Dragon Phantoms from before were gone without a trace. After they transformed into the ancient character, they had forced Yang Kai and Li Jiao into a Void Crack.

“Ah!” Li Jiao paled in shock.

It was only natural that he was familiar with what a Void Crack was. Even for a Master like him, this was an extremely dangerous place where the slightest bit of carelessness would cause him to lose his way and never find his way out again.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai took out a new set of clothes from his Space Ring and put them on while carefully taking in his surroundings. He did not know how many times he had been in and out of Void Cracks by now; but even so, this place gave off a slightly different feel. It was as though something profound was hidden everywhere within its depths.

Yang Kai tried to manipulate the local Space Principles and, fortunately, there were no restrictions placed on them. He believed that he could break out of this Void Crack and return to the outside world if he used his full strength. It was just that he did not know where they would end up appearing; therefore, he was in no hurry to make a move. Besides, he still needed to enter Dragon Island.

A Void Crack would not appear for no reason. From the accumulation of his past experiences, Yang Kai could vaguely sense that this Void Crack was between the Star Boundary and Dragon Island. In other words, as long as they could locate the proper exit point of this Void Crack, they could enter Dragon Island.

[This is definitely a trap!] Yang Kai had a faint feeling that this trap was aimed at him, yet at the same time, it didn’t seem like that either.

Anyone who passed through the Void Corridor would have triggered this trap and been exiled to this place. Yang Kai might just have been in the wrong place at the wrong time; after all, Dragon Island was so well-hidden and their defences were so strict, that they were willing to leave a Dragon Clan Secret Technique here to defend against intruders.

If that was the case, Yang Kai couldn’t just tear space as he pleased here. He could not determine where they would land if he did that. There was no guarantee that he could enter Dragon Island.

As that thought passed through his mind, a plan formed in his heart and he sent a Divine Sense transmission to Li Jiao, “Follow me closely. The Void Turbulence in the Void Crack is very unstable. If you get caught, you will be sent to another place instantly and I’m not sure I’ll be able to find you then. There are also Void Fissures lurking here, and if you touch those, you will either die or suffer from severe injuries.”

Void Cracks were different from Void Fissures. The environment they were in was a Void Crack. On the other hand, Void Fissures were much smaller tears in space, sometimes so tiny they were imperceptible. They were similar to sharp blades randomly floating about, and if one were to come into contact with one they would be lucky to get away with some scratches. If they were unlucky, they could be cut in half.

Li Jiao clearly understood the situation he was in. In this damned place, only Yang Kai, who was proficient in the Dao of Space, could guarantee his safety. Thus, he nodded heavily, “I understand.”

After that, Yang Kai immediately led the way forward. Space Principles fluctuated as he inspected their surroundings, carefully avoiding all the Void Turbulence and Void Fissures around them. Li Jiao followed at Yang Kai’s heels, stepping where Yang Kai stepped and always staying one step behind him, his nerves stretched to their limits.

Yang Kai’s movements were rather erratic, constantly moving from left to right without a pattern. Although there was nothing to be used as a reference in this place and Li Jiao couldn’t distinguish North, South, East, or West, Yang Kai’s change in direction was still rather obvious. Sometimes, he would even turn around and walk backwards without warning.

Li Jiao kept quiet through it all, not daring to disturb Yang Kai. Only the Heavens knew how long it had been since they started walking when all of a sudden, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks with a strange expression on his face.

“Palace Master Yang… Did you find the exit?” Li Jiao asked cautiously.

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Then…” Li Jiao looked at Yang Kai inquiringly.

“We’re lost,” Yang Kai replied.

“Huh?” Li Jiao was taken aback, “We’re l-lost?!”

He nearly thought that he had misheard. [The surrounding space is in pure chaos and nothingness. There is no road to speak of, so how can we get lost? Still, Yang Kai must have his reasons to say that; after all, he has the most authority to speak in this place.]

“We passed through here earlier.” Yang Kai sighed softly.

Li Jiao scratched his head and released his Divine Sense into his surroundings to look around. [This damned place is the same everywhere. I can’t tell the difference at all. I can’t believe Yang Kai can differentiate where we are in this place.]

“This is a labyrinth.” There was a strange light in Yang Kai’s eyes. If he had not seen it for himself, he wouldn’t have dared to believe that there was such a mysterious labyrinth within this Void Crack.

The labyrinth was incredibly large. Using the Void Turbulence as paths and combining countless Void Fissures into one, it transformed a vast region into a maze with no way out.

What shocked him even more was that the labyrinth was not static. It changed constantly. Any changes to the surging Void Turbulence and the flowing Void Fissures could trigger a change across the entire labyrinth.

[Who set this up? Who has such great ability to pull this off? Is it Dragon Island? If it is Dragon Island… For what reason did they set up this labyrinth? Who are they trying to trap?]

All of a sudden, a sentence Li Jiao said before came to mind. Twenty years ago, Martial Beast Great Emperor had caused a ruckus on Dragon Island!

Yang Kai burst out in cold sweat. [This labyrinth… Maybe it was meant for Martial Beast Great Emperor! Only such a huge layout could trap a Great Emperor after all! On that same note, only a Great Emperor has the ability to force Dragon Island to set up a labyrinth like this, I’m nothing more than an innocent victim caught up in their squabble!]

When that thought crossed his mind, Yang Kai’s spirits lifted suddenly. [It looks like my previous guess was right. I can enter Dragon Island as long as I can crack this labyrinth because this Void Labyrinth was created with the Void Corridor as its foundation. The exit of the Void Labyrinth should coincide with the exit of the Void Corridor!]

He started moving again, carefully observing the changes around him. Then, he gradually formed a map in his head. It was a map of the entire labyrinth. He believed that as long as he could perfect this map, he could find a way out of the labyrinth.

Li Jiao did not know what plan Yang Kai had come up with. All he knew was that Yang Kai suddenly sped up; thus, he could only grit his teeth and keep up.

Time flew by. There was no Sun, Moon, or Stars here, and there was no way to tell how much time had passed, but even so, Li Jiao had the feeling that at least one month had passed.

Yang Kai spent the entire month walking here and there aimlessly. He stopped from time to time and observed his surroundings, muttering something under his breath before setting off again. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Although no battles had taken place during this month, Li Jiao nearly died several times. Void Turbulence could appear anywhere, and there was one time when he got caught in them and was nearly teleported away to a random place. Fortunately, Yang Kai had reacted swiftly and pulled him back or he might have been trapped here for the rest of his life. Li Jiao did not have the confidence that he could escape this place on his own.

During this past month, Yang Kai’s expression had gotten grimmer and grimmer. He slowly realized that he had underestimated this Void Labyrinth greatly. The map in his head had to be redrawn over and over again, to the point where he had barely made any progress.

With his knowledge of the Dao of Space, it was not difficult for him to leave this place. All he had to do was tear open the space randomly and he could return to the Star Boundary; however, doing that would mean giving up on his plan to enter Dragon Island. That was not what he planned on doing.

On this day, Yang Kai and Li Jiao were walking in the Void Labyrinth while looking for the exit as usual.

Li Jiao felt dead inside. He had given up, feeling as though he should never have hoped to set foot on Dragon Island in the first place. He simply followed Yang Kai mechanically, stepping where Yang Kai stepped.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai stopped in his tracks and his Emperor Qi surged. Surprised, Li Jiao pushed his Emperor Qi without any hesitation, thinking another Void Turbulence was coming.

Contrary to his expectations though, Yang Kai didn’t make any moves. He simply stood there and stared to the front in a daze. Li Jiao frowned and looked in the direction Yang Kai was staring before his jaw suddenly fell open in shock.

Not far away, a figure sat cross-legged inside the Void. It seemed to be exuding a strange Principle Strength fluctuation from its body and the surrounding Void Turbulence could not approach it.

[There’s somebody here? There are people in this damned place?!] Li Jiao could barely believe his eyes. However, he soon discovered that this ‘person’ was not really alive. Rather, it seemed to be a phantom image. Although that person’s entire being exuded a faint glow, they did not have a physical body.
