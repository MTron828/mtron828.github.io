[The World Tree!]

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. If the changes in the Star Boundary were related to the World Tree he had planted, then it was not impossible.

The World Tree was simply too mysterious. At the very least, Yang Kai had never seen anything like the World Fruits that could allow the Open Heaven Realm Masters to advance an entire Order simply by consuming them.

Small Source Worlds were already quite impressive. Yang Kai had gone to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s Divine Armament World for life experience; there, his foundation in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm was greatly strengthened. However, if he could obtain a High-Rank World Fruit, he could directly advance from the Sixth-Order to the Seventh-Order. The effects of the two were incomparable.

If the World Fruit had such a heaven-defying effect, the World Tree that gave birth to those World Fruits could surely create mind-blowing miracles.

The World Tree planted in the Star Boundary was a root Yang Kai had brought from the Great Ancient Ruins Boundary’s Primordial Land. Because of the war between the Human and Demon Race, the Star Boundary had nearly been destroyed.

Even if they obtained the final victory and killed Mo Sheng, the Star Boundary was so severely damaged that it could not last for too long. The reason why Yang Kai went to the Outer Universe was firstly to pursue a higher Martial Dao, and secondly to find the World Tree to save the Star Boundary.

Fortunately, he found the World Tree and brought back one of its roots from the Great Ancient Ruins Boundary.

On the day he returned to the Star Boundary and planted the root, Yang Kai faintly felt that there would be some changes to his homeland, and that the cultivators who remained in the Star Boundary would grow together with the Star Boundary as it recovered, perhaps gaining some unexpected benefits.

This kind of opportunity to grow and recover together with the entire Universe World was extremely rare. In the entire 3,000 Worlds, only the Star Boundary which had a World Tree Root planted could have such a chance.

It was just that Yang Kai had not expected this change to occur so quickly! Moreover, the effects were so obvious that even his parents had condensed their Dao Seals.

No wonder Head Manager Hua Qing Si who stayed in the Star Boundary had asked Hei He to come to Void Land to find him. Such a huge change in the Star Boundary was indeed not something that could be ignored.

The hall sunk into silence for a moment before Hei He pondered and added, “Sir, Head Manager Hua did an extensive investigation of all the cultivators in the Star Boundary. Basically, everyone’s cultivation speed is faster than before. What’s more, many newborns have outstanding aptitudes. All the great Sects have now taken in many good seedlings, and with time, they will surely become powerful Masters.”

Yang Kai nodded his understanding, “I understand. Tell me how you were captured.”

Hei He let out a bitter laugh, “When we were passing through White Light Territory’s Universe Temple, Young Lady Lan Xun accidentally mentioned Void Land. Yin Xin Zhao must have overheard her and waited in ambush for us outside the Universe Temple, and then…” Hei He’s face became gloomy; he was unable to continue anymore. He was only a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. Although Yin Xin Zhao had broken through recently, he was still a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. It was a simple matter for Yin Xin Zhao to overpower a Fifth-Order Master like Hei He.

After using a Soul Searching Technique on Lan Xun, Yin Xin Zhao came to the Heavenly Sword Palace with Hei He and Lan Xun through Flying Smoke Territory.

Naturally, Zuo Quan Hui welcomed Yin Xin Zhao’s arrival, not to mention the fact that he brought two gifts along with him. After learning that Hei He and Lan Xun were actually from Yang Kai’s homeland, Luan Bai Feng took the opportunity to escape with them by pretending to take them to be imprisoned.

Fortunately, Luan Bai Feng was proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays and had many Array Plates on hand; otherwise, she would not have been able to escape from Zuo Quan Hui’s pursuit.

Be that as it may, she had still suffered injuries, and what happened next was clearly witnessed by Yang Kai.

After learning the whole story, Yang Kai was filled with fear. Thankfully, Luan Bai Feng had acted decisively; otherwise, he would have been pushed into an absolute passive position.

With Hei He and Lan Xun in Zuo Quan Hui’s hands, it would be quite difficult for Void Land to handle the situation.

If it weren’t for the current predicament, Yang Kai would have immediately rushed to the Star Boundary to investigate whether the changes there were caused by the World Tree he had planted or not.

However, now that Heavenly Sword Union was occupying the entrance to Void Territory and was eyeing him like a tiger eyeing its prey, how could he possibly escape?

“Why don’t I go back and take a look?” Flower Shadow Great Emperor suggested. The Star Boundary was also her homeland, and every resident of the Star Boundary felt a unique connection to it. Although judging by Hei He’s report, the change in the Star Boundary was truly good news, how could they be assured without checking it out completely?

Flower Shadow Great Emperor was also a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now, so it wasn’t a problem for her to investigate the changes in the Star Boundary.

Yang Kai was just about to nod in agreement when Jin Yuan Lang rushed in and reported, cupping his fist, “Sect Master, there are some movements on the Heavenly Sword Palace’s side!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately ran outside the hall and looked up. The next moment, he saw the Heavenly Sword Palace, which had been occupying the Territory Gate for over a year, slowly retreating and disappearing into it.

[Zhuo Quan Hui is retreating?]

Seeing this, Yang Kai instinctively had a bad premonition. After a slight pause, he snapped, “Damn it, Zuo Quan Hui is going to the Star Boundary!”

Yin Xin Zhao had used a Soul Searching Technique on Lan Xun. Regardless of how much information he obtained from Lan Xun’s memories, the location of the Star Boundary and the World Tree could not remain hidden at the very least.

The Star Boundary was Yang Kai’s and other Great Emperors’ homeland; furthermore, High Heaven Palace and his parents were also there. If Zuo Quan Hui were to attack the Star Boundary, it would be impossible for the latter to resist.

After all, it was not protected by a Divine Spirit like Void Land was!

More importantly, the World Tree alone was enough to incite Zuo Quan Hui’s greed! Yang Kai didn’t know if the roots he brought back could grow into another World Tree, or if they could bear World Fruits, but something that could change an entire Universe World was definitely far from ordinary!

The act of Heavenly Sword Palace’s sudden retreat to Flying Smoke Territory undoubtedly indicated that Zuo Quan Hui had some kind of plan for the Star Boundary, otherwise he would not have acted in such a manner.

No wonder Zuo Quan Hui had not taken any action just now. A year ago, this old dog had been trying all kinds of means to force Yang Kai to show himself so that he could launch a sneak attack and kill him. But when Yang Kai finally appeared, Zuo Quan Hui had not made a move.

It wasn’t that Zuo Quan Hui was being kind, but rather that he had a better choice before him!

The Great Emperors who had followed Yang Kai out of the hall turned to him.

Yang Kai hurriedly shouted, “All forces, assemble immediately!”

*Xiu xiu xiu… *

All the Open Heaven Realm Masters in the temporary base began to gather around.

Yang Kai swept his gaze over them and ordered, “Don’t try to resist, I want to take you all into my Small Universe.”

Old Bai was shocked after hearing this, “Take us into your Small Universe? Yang Kai, only a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master’s Small Universe can materialize and contain living beings. You’re just in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm right now, how can you do that?”

Yang Kai replied, glancing at him, “My Small Universe has already become corporeal!”

When he had broken through to the Open Heaven Realm, Yang Kai had integrated the Sealed World Bead into his Small Universe, resulting in a rather unique phenomenon. If not for this, it was impossible for his foundation to be so robust, and neither would he have been able to suppress his opponent in the same Order so easily. It was just that this fact was not worth discussing with others.

If it weren’t for the pressing situation and the lack of a large-scale flight-type artifact like the Heavenly Sword Palace in Void Land, Yang Kai wouldn’t have made such a desperate move.

He was bearing risks by taking other Open Heaven Realm Masters into his Small Universe, even if they were his disciples, friends, and family.

Old Bai was stunned!

Yang Kai had already begun taking everyone in. As the Open Heaven Realm Masters below the Sixth-Order gave up resisting, they felt a pull enveloping their bodies. By the time they regained their senses, they had already arrived in another world.

Batches of Open Heaven Realm Masters disappeared into thin air one after another, pulled into Yang Kai’s Small Universe. But very soon, Yang Kai noticed a feeling of fullness coming from his Small Universe, a feeling he had never felt before. It was strange and new.

As if she noticed the change in Yang Kai’s expression, Yue He nervously stated, “Young Master, if you sense something is wrong, you should stop immediately! High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters can indeed store living creatures into their Small Universe, but there is also a limit to their capacity, especially since everyone you are taking in is an Open Heaven Realm Master with their own Small Universe. Although it is not a real Universe World, it is still quite a burden for you. If you fight with anyone at this moment, you will be in a really tough spot and will be at great disadvantage.”

Yang Kai nodded, “I understand!”

Having said that, the number of Open Heaven Realm Masters that Yang Kai’s Small Universe could take in continued to decrease, and the feeling of fullness became more obvious.

Over the past year, many Open Heaven Realm Masters had died in the war, but even so, there were still over 1,300 remaining.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai finally managed to collect all 1,300 cultivators into his Small Universe. At this moment, Yang Kai could clearly feel that his Small Universe was completely stuffed. He felt as if he had accidentally eaten too much and couldn’t even circulate his World Force smoothly.

He understood that it was just as Yue He had said, if he were to fight in this condition, he would definitely be at a grave disadvantage.

What’s more, if anything were to happen to him and his Small Universe collapsed, all 1,300 people residing inside would be buried along with him!

For this reason, a High-Rank Open Heaven Master would almost never be willing to accept another Open Heaven Realm Master into their Small Universe, and lower Rank Open Heaven Masters would not want to enter a High-Rank Open Heaven Master’s Small Universe under normal circumstances. Both sides were at a risk.

Yang Kai turned his head and stated, turning his head towards the Sixth-Order Masters, “I can’t take you in.”

Yang Kai had secretly experimented with Yue He before, and although they were both Sixth-Order Masters and he was able to take Yue He into his Small Universe, the feeling of fullness and discomfort her presence created was far greater than those below the Sixth-Order. Perhaps only when Yang Kai had advanced to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm would he be able to take Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters into his Small Universe without immediately becoming discomforted.

“Hei He!” Yang Kai shouted again.

“Reporting!” Hei He quickly cupped his fist, respectfully greeting.

“I leave Lan Xun to you. Take her to Void Land and hand her over to Senior Bi Xi where she can focus on recuperating!”

“Sir, please rest assured, this subordinate will protect Young Lady Lan Xun to the death!” Hei He nodded repeatedly. He was secretly shocked that his Master had actually advanced to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm!

Some time ago, he had been forced to leave his name on the Loyalty List. Yang Kai was just a mere Emperor Realm Master at that time.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai pushed his Space Principles as he wrapped everyone with his energy before disappearing.

He didn’t pursue the Heavenly Sword Palace because he couldn’t guarantee that Zuo Quan Hui wouldn’t have set up an ambush in Flying Smoke Territory. Although this possibility wasn’t high, he still had to be prepared for even that remote possibility.

If he were to rush into Flying Smoke Territory and be blocked by Zuo Quan Hui, he would definitely be thrown into panic and have his hands tied, especially since his current state was not suitable for fighting. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Fortunately, if he wanted to go to the Star Boundary, Flying Smoke Territory was not the only route.

Furthermore, Yang Kai might not be able to circulate his World Force smoothly, making intense combat impossible, but simply bringing people along with him as he traveled wasn’t an issue. Unfortunately, the people around him were all Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, so even if they weren’t resisting, his consumption was quite high
