When Yang Kai left a month ago, he handed over the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation to Ji Yao. Since then, every disciple of Ice Heart Valley had been practising this Formation diligently, including Bing Yun and her Direct Disciples.

This was the core Formation of Black Tortoise Sect, a secret that was not passed on to outsiders. This Formation‚Äôs defensive ability was extremely strong. Now, with the combined force of seven Emperor Realm Masters, including a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master like Bing Yun who took the central position, the Formation that they formed was nigh impregnable.

Although Bing Yun and the others had not doubted the power of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation, it was their first time using it in real combat, so they honestly did not know how powerful it would be. Seeing that they easily forced Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo back, however, they were delighted and knew that if Yang Kai did not leave such a unique formation to them, Ice Heart Valley would be doomed today.

Even though the Sect Defending Array was breached, the seven thousand disciples could still reduce their casualties greatly with the help of this Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation, possibly even allowing some of them to escape and preserve the inheritance of their Sect.

‚ÄúYou bitches!‚Äù Contrary to the pleasant surprise of the Elders of Ice Heart Valley, Feng Xuan was maddened.

The Seeking Passion Sect and Ice Heart Valley were both top Sects in the Northern Territory, and they knew each other‚Äôs backgrounds extremely well. However, he had never known that Ice Heart Valley possessed such a mighty Formation Technique, nor did he have any clue where Bing Yun obtained it. His mood became dreadful as his proud attack had been turned back so casually.

‚ÄúListen to me, my Disciples! Follow me to carve a path of blood out of here!‚Äù Bing Yun shouted coldly.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Everyone replied in unison.

‚ÄúWhy are you still standing around gawking? Kill them!‚Äù Feng Xuan was enraged but did not lose his mind. Seeing that his combined force with Yao Zhuo was not enough to gain the upper hand, he could only choose to overwhelm the enemy with pure numbers.

This strange Formation was indeed profound and mysterious, but Feng Xuan noticed that Bing Yun and the others had not cultivated it for very long and were still not proficient in using it. In other words, they could not unleash the maximum potential of this Formation.

So, even if they hastily tied together this formation, there was a limit to the amplification it would provide. Feng Xuan had twenty Emperor Realm Masters on his side, so it was still possible for them to break through using brute force.

Hearing Feng Xuan‚Äôs order, the spectating Emperor Realm Masters put on solemn looks, pushing their Emperor Qi and summoning their Artifacts one after another before charging towards Bing Yun and her Disciples.

In an instant, the surrounding World Energy and Principles become disordered and space itself cracked, flipping the Heavens and Earth.

Nearly thirty Emperor Realm Masters had become locked in a life or death battle, a sight rarely seen in the Star Boundary.

Emperor Artifacts of various shapes and kinds emerged, displaying their great power, and turning into various attacks, bombarding the phantom of the Black Tortoise. However, the Black Tortoise phantom was extremely durable, remaining safe and sound despite the heavy onslaught.

Nanmen Da Jun was observing from the side with bright eyes, and after a long time, a realization dawned on him as he cried out involuntarily, ‚ÄúThe Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation!‚Äù

As an Array Master renowned in this generation, Nanmen Da Jun had a broad knowledge base, so although it was his first time seeing this Formation, he recognized its origins quickly.

‚ÄúThe core inheritance of Black Tortoise Sect that was said to have been lost to history!‚Äù Nanmen Da Jun had never been so excited before.

Spirit Arrays were his specialty, and his passion for this Dao was as deep as his attainments in it. To him, rare Spirit Arrays and Formations were like great beauties. He had once risked his own life just to study an Ancient Array in a Forbidden Zone, spending a whole three years to crack it in the end, narrowly escaping death.

Nanmen Da Jun had seen the records of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation in ancient books and learned that it was once the foundation of Black Tortoise Sect from Eastern Territory. However, when the Black Tortoise Sect was wiped out, the Spirit Array was said to have been lost.

According to the ancient books, Black Tortoise Sect comprehended this Formation by observing the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise. The Divine Spirit Black Tortoise was one of the greatest Divine Spirits of all time, so how could a Formation which was comprehended by observing such a majestic beast be weak?

Seeing this Formation stimulated the desire of Nanmen Da Jun. It was an array that he had studied for a while yet was not able to obtain.

He had never expected to witness this long lost formation in Ice Heart Valley today.

‚ÄúThis trip has been completely worth it!‚Äù Nanmen Da Jun‚Äôs eyes lit up as he completely forgot that a desperate life and death battle was taking place. Instead, he immersed himself in studying from the side with interest, ogling this Formation as he wished he could rush forward to study it in detail.

Although he was electrified, he knew that with his cultivation, he would only bring a miserable death to himself if he rushed out now.

On the other side, Ice Heart Valley and Seeking Passion Sect‚Äôs battle had reached a fever pitch.

Seeking Passion Sect had twenty Emperor Realm Masters on its side, greatly surpassing Ice Heart Valley in terms of numbers and overall strength, but they still could not break through the defence of the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation.

Their attacks were all blocked by Bing Yun and the others while, on the contrary, Bing Yun and her Disciples were able to unleash powerful killing moves from time to time, terrifying everyone from the Seeking Passion Sect. All of them were drenched in cold sweat as they tried to handle this precarious situation.

Especially troubling was the cold domain and swirling Ice Principles that slowed down the circulation of Emperor Qi in their bodies.

With the passage of time, the Masters from the Seeking Passion Sect grew more and more frightened, worried they would be completely exhausted before they could break through the defences of this Formation. At that time, they would all become pigs waiting to be butchered.

After all, Bing Yun and the others were defending more than attacking, and with the assistance of this Formation, their consumption would naturally be much lower than those of the Seeking Passion Sect who were attacking.

Many of them were in a panic and their attacks became less fierce than before.

Realizing this situation, Feng Xuan suddenly exploded like a volcano as he raged, ‚ÄúBing Yun, you are still putting up a stiff resistance with your back to the wall, but this King really wants to see how your seven thousand disciples in Ice Heart Valley will resist our forces! This King‚Äôs Sect has already sent another ten Emperor Realm Masters to the centre of your Ice Heart Valley! By now, your precious valley must be a river of blood!‚Äù

There were not just twenty Emperor Realm Masters on the Seeking Passion Sect‚Äôs side, but more than thirty in total. Only about one-third of this number directly belonged to the Seeking Passion Sect, while the rest were the helpers recruited from the outside.

Before coming here, ten Emperor Realm Masters were ordered to infiltrate into Ice Heart Valley to kill the disciples. With the remaining power of Ice Heart Valley, there was no way for them to resist.

Sure enough, when Feng Xuan‚Äôs words fell, the faces of the Ice Heart Valley Elders darkened.

Bing Yun bellowed as she gritted her teeth, ‚ÄúFollow me!‚Äù

While speaking, she led her Disciples in an attempt to break through their encirclement.

Feng Xuan put on a fierce expression as he struck out with his Wind and Thunder Divine Spear, ‚ÄúIn your dreams! Bing Yun, just watch how this King wipes out Ice Heart Valley, and tremble in despair and regret! When those ten Emperor Realm Masters come back, you will all die!‚Äù

Yao Zhuo, who had been silent the whole time, also became bloated with confidence and sneered, ‚ÄúThis is the consequence of opposing our Seeking Passion Sect!‚Äù

These words had a deep meaning behind them and the Emperor Realm Masters who did not belong to the Seeking Passion Sect turned silent after hearing them, secretly planning whether they should pledge their fealty to the Seeking Passion Sect after this war lest they no longer have a foothold in the Northern Territory. n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

‚ÄúTen Emperor Realm Masters?‚Äù

At this moment, a lazy voice sounded. When this voice reached the ears of all the Ice Heart Valley Elders, they could not help feeling delighted as they turned to look at its source.

‚ÄúSenior Brother Yang!‚Äù Ji Yao was pleasantly surprised.

On the other side, Feng Xuan widened his eyes in hatred and burst out, ‚ÄúLittle animal!‚Äù

He recognized this voice as his son‚Äôs murderer. Furthermore, he had encountered Yang Kai outside Ice Heart Valley just a month ago, so it was impossible for him to forget it.

Swiftly, Feng Xuan turned and glared at Yang Kai full of murderous intent, paying his complete attention to him as if no one else besides him mattered.

‚ÄúDo you mean these ten Emperor Realm Masters? This Young Master brought them to you. It was just a slight effort, no need for any thanks.‚Äù

Yang Kai emerged slowly from the Void without the slightest fluster on his face, as if he was taking a leisurely stroll in his own back garden. When his figure was revealed, he waved his hand lightly.

*Hua la la‚Ä¶ *

Corpses fell down from the sky one after another. It could be noticed that these corpses all belonged to important individuals as they were all dressed in fine robes. However, they were all dead, each of them having a single fatal wound on their bodies that blood still flowed out of.

‚ÄúAh, it‚Äôs Great Elder Feng Zi Ping of Green Wind Valley!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiu Rui of Hundred Refining Sect!‚Äù

‚ÄúNine Star Sect‚Äôs Sect Master!‚Äù

‚Ä¶..

The air burst out in exclamations as the Emperor Realm Masters who were besieging Bing Yun and the others swept their eyes across the corpses, each of them calling out in fright one after another.

All of them recognized the deceased as they were quite familiar with each other. They had just separated from these people to follow Feng Xuan to tie down Bing Yun while the rest led the hundred thousand troops into Ice Heart Valley.

Nevertheless, all of these Masters had been turned into corpses.

They counted the number of corpses, and it was precisely ten.

In other words, all ten Emperor Realm Masters who separated from them were now dead.

The twenty Emperor Realm Masters gasped simultaneously, feeling a chill running from the back of their spines to the top of their heads.

Everyone stopped attacking, distracted by the ten corpses, staring in disbelief.

How could all of them die in such a short time? How could Ice Heart Valley still have such formidable power in reserve?

In contrast to the bewilderment on Seeking Passion Sect‚Äôs side, everyone from Ice Heart Valley was overjoyed.

Especially Bing Yun and Ji Yao, for both of them knew about Yang Kai‚Äôs plan. Now that they saw these ten corpses, they immediately understood that Yang Kai had brought back powerful helpers, otherwise it would be impossible to accomplish this without anybody knowing it.

‚ÄúYang Kai‚Ä¶‚Äù Bing Yun was lost for words as she called out warmly to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai on the other hand looked at Bing Yun and lowered his head slightly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm late.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt. You came back just in time,‚Äù Bing Yun shook her head slowly.

She knew that Ice Heart Valley would be saved with the return of Yang Kai.

‚ÄúSect Master Feng, long time no see!‚Äù Yang Kai turned to Feng Xuan who was livid, and grinned.

‚ÄúBastard!‚Äù Feng Xuan‚Äôs teeth almost shattered from how hard he was grinding them, ‚ÄúHow did you kill all of them on your own!?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you see, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Yang Kai‚Äôs lips curved into a mocking grin, ‚ÄúHave no comments!‚Äù

‚ÄúLittle Bastard, I‚Äôll kill you!‚Äù Yao Zhuo seethed at this moment, pushing his Emperor Qi madly as he slashed down with his sword from above, intending to cut Yang Kai in two with a single stroke.
