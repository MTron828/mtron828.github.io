“Your companion was a bit tactless, so he died!” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Fu indifferently, without the slightest emotion in his eyes, making Zhang Fu sweat even more profusely.

He wanted to escape but found that he couldn’t muster the courage.

He had a feeling that if he really tried to run, he would be the next one seeing his own decapitated body.

“I hope your answers can satisfy me!” Yang Kai continued to put pressure on Zhang Fu as he observed his victim carefully.

Zhang Fu’s complexion was forlorn, and his eyes showed a clear light of fear. Pursing his dry lips, he asked, “If I tell you what you want to know, will you let me go?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai sneered.

Zhang Fu’s body trembled as he gathered his courage and said, “Since you won’t let me go, why should I cooperate with you? Either way, I’ll die.”

“I can kill you quickly, so you won’t even notice you died!” Yang Kai smiled gently.

This smile was like that of a reaper from hell and Zhang Fu felt that this young man he was facing was scarier than Senior Li.

“I need to think about it!” Zhang Fu gulped hard as his eyes drifted about, obviously trying to find a way to escape.

Yang Kai just observed with a smile for a moment before flicking his wrist, causing the golden thread at his fingertips to flicker. Zhang Fu saw this, screamed, and hurriedly tried to dodge.

However, before he could dodge, a powerful Shi wrapped him up making it impossible for him to even move!

Zhang Fu’s eyes shrank as he looked down to find that the tips of his fingers on his left hand had been sheared off, as if they were sliced by some kind of extremely sharp blade, leaving a smooth wound that blood continued to splash out of.

The pain of this injury was nothing for a battle-hardened Origin Realm master, but what frightened Zhang Fu was that he had no power to fight back in front of Yang Kai.

Both of them were Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators, but the other party was like an aloof god who could easily control his life or death!

The golden light flashed again...

Zhang Fu felt a twang of pain again as his left fingers were shaved down slightly more, the severed pieces drifting away slowly right before his eyes.

The other party did not speak anymore and simply kept waving his hand, sending out the golden thread every once in a while.

Another slice was taken, then another...

Zhang Fu’s left hand was slowly but surely cut away and soon disappeared altogether, leaving him with only a handless left arm. Yang Kai showed no intention of stopping though and instead continued his task with meticulous precision, cutting off small pieces of Zhang Fu’s left arm now that his hand was gone.

What caused Zhang Fu to tremble though was that while this young man continued this slow torture, he spoke in a callous voice to explain what he was doing. “After cutting off your left arm, I will cut off your right, then your left leg, then your right leg. I believe that with your cultivation, you won’t die even after that, so I’ll then begin cutting off parts of your body, but don’t worry, I’ll make sure you survive long enough to witness your heart being cut apart, so you understand exactly how you died.”

Zhang Fu could no longer hold back the panic in his heart and shouted, “Enough, whatever you want to know, I’ll tell you! Just stop!”

One death was not equal to another. Suffering slowly and dying painlessly were completely different concepts. Zhang Fu could not bear watching himself slowly be cut apart; just thinking about such a scene made him shudder uncontrollably. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Yang Kai paused and looked at him lightly before chuckling, “If you’d done this earlier, you could have avoided some pain. What was there to hesitate about?”

Zhang Fu grit his teeth and spat, “The winner is the King, the loser is the villain, just tell me what you want to know.”

“Good! Who are you!” Yang Kai went straight to the point.

“We’re from Sword Union!”

“Sword Union?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

Sword Union was one of the Star Field’s hegemons, a super force that controlled several Cultivation Stars. Although it was not as large as Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, its strength was not to be underestimated.

In fact, Yang Kai had some dealings with Sword Union’s cultivators before, but that was many years ago. In the Star Field, in addition to Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce and Sword Union, there was another super force Purple Star, as well other significant players like Galaxy Ridge and Abandoned Lair, each one occupying their own territory, fighting amongst themselves for dominance.

“Who are you trying to ambush by hiding here?” Yang Kai asked again.

Zhang Fu’s eyes flickered as his look became hesitant, but in the end, he grit his teeth and replied, “The one we’re here to ambush is also from Sword Union.”

Yang Kai looked at him with a strange expression.

Zhang Fu quickly explained, “I’m not lying to you! The one we’re here to ambush is our enemy! Although everyone belongs to Sword Union, there are different factions!”

Yang Kai nodded lightly. From the other person’s eyes, Yang Kai could see that he wasn’t lying and his explanation was also reasonable.

For a great force such as Sword Union, its internal structure was naturally complicated and power struggles were inevitable; however, setting up an ambush like this seemed somewhat excessive.

“Explain in detail,” Yang Kai asked, just to be safe.

Since Zhang Fu had chosen to cooperate, naturally he did not try to hide anything and immediately told Yang Kai everything he knew.

In Sword Union, there were apparently several different factions, but two dominated above the rest. One faction was led by the current Union Master while the other was headed by the Vice Union Master. These two factions had been fighting one another for many years.

The Senior Li Zhang Fu mentioned before, whose real name was Li Ming Hai, belonged to the Vice Union Master’s faction.

This time they were here to ambush the rising star of the Union Master’s faction, the direct descendant of Sword Union’s Union Master Gu Cang Yun, Gu Jian Xin!

“A rising star, even the descendant of your Union Master, is actually worth dispatching an Origin King to ambush?” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Fu in astonishment before pensively asking, “What is it about this person that you are all so afraid of?”

Zhang Fu smiled bitterly, “If it was just an ordinary Origin Realm master, naturally we wouldn’t need to pay him so much attention, but the Young Union Master possesses the Universe Sword Body and has now reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm. If he breaks through to the Origin King Realm, the Vice Union Master’s faction will have no future, so we need to take advantage of this time, when he has no strong guardians, to take action. Your appearance disrupted Senior Li’s plan, so he tried to kill you.”

“Universe Sword Body?” Yang Kai touched his chin, “Some type of Special Constitution, isn’t it? What’s so terrifying about it?”

“The Young Union Master is only sixty years old this year yet has already reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, what isn’t terrifying about it?” Zhang Fu said solemnly, “I think your true age is also not very big, and your strength is quite good, but if you were to be facing our Young Union Master, it’s not certain who would win or lose!”

“Really?” Yang Kai chuckled.

A cultivator who reached the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm in less than sixty years was indeed a top talent! However, Yang Kai was only about fifty, even younger than this Gu Jian Xin!

When cultivators cultivated, they often did not notice the passage of time, so they didn’t care much about age.

“If it’s true what you say, then I am somewhat interested in your Young Union Master,” Yang Kai snickered.

Zhang Fu swept his eyes over Yang Kai before nodding, “People like you will collide with each other one day, creating great sparks, but... that will all depend on the Young Union Master escaping this tribulation alive! Good, have I told you everything you want to know?”

“En!” Yang Kai nodded lightly at him.

“Then do it!” Zhang Fu urged impatiently, but there were still no signs of Yang Kai acting. Instead, his consciousness just became blurred in the next moment.

Sure enough... he did not even know what happened!

Standing in place, Yang Kai took Zhang Fu and Liu Dong’s Space Rings then burned down their bodies with his Demonic Flames. Pondering for a moment, Yang Kai summoned his Star Shuttle again and flew back the way he came.

He had not sought trouble, but that Li Ming Hai hadn’t even said a word and tried to kill him for simply passing by. How could Yang Kai tolerate such an affront? After being beaten by someone, how could he not hit back?

Yang Kai was planning on joining the fun! If he could find a chance to kill Li Ming Hai, that would be best.

In the Asteroid Sea, the group of cultivators headed by Li Ming Hai waited quietly, like patient beasts ready to pounce.

After a long time though, someone frowned and said, “Why haven’t Zhang Fu and Liu Dong come back? With their skills, could they have failed?”

“Did they encounter some kind of danger?”

“Is there any danger around here? You don’t want to say they were killed by that guy, do you?”

“How could that be? That guy took a blow from Senior Li and was lucky to have even survived. How could he have the strength to fight against Zhang Fu and Liu Dong? However, it is strange they have not come back after so long, should we go out and look for them?” A man asked Li Ming Hai.

“No, if they cannot even handle such a simple matter, their lives are worthless! Do not act carelessly, within a day or two the Young Union Master’s Starship will pass through here. Just wait quietly.”

“Yes!”

After a brief conversation, the group of ambushers went silent, only occasionally glancing in a certain direction, looking forward to the arrival of the Young Union Master’s Starship.

This Asteroid Sea was quite large, so it was easy to hide in, otherwise, Li Ming Hai would not have chosen to ambush Gu Jian Xin’s Starship in this place.

It was because it was so big that Yang Kai was not spotted when he snuck around and approached.

At this moment, Yang Kai had gotten to within a hundred kilometres of Li Ming Hai’s group.

He also hid behind a big asteroid and stared in the direction of Li Ming Hai with a cold expression.

With his current strength, he could simply have charged forward and attacked. Even if he could not kill Li Ming Hai this way, it would not be a problem for him to kill a few of his subordinates and retreat calmly.

But Yang Kai didn’t choose this course of action. It was Li Ming Hai who injured him before, so he wanted to settle accounts with him personally.

Yang Kai was also waiting. Waiting for the Young Union Master to arrive and for the two sides to fight so he could find an opportunity to launch his own sneak attack, repaying the earlier favour he received in kind!
