Duan Hong Chen snorted, “Do you think the name Heaven Devouring Great Emperor is for nothing? If we miss this opportunity, this Old Master is afraid there will be no chance to kill him in the future.”

When the words fell, he laughed again, “No one in this world can kill this King!”

Two sentences were spoken with two different tones, like Duan Hong Chen had split personalities.

Yang Kai rebuked, “You shut up!”

Duan Hong Chen turned to look at Yang Kai coldly and challenged in a grim voice, “Little brat, say that again if you dare. Do you believe that I would…”

Yang Kai immediately interrupted him by waving his hand, “Enough, enough. You already had a hard time with this Young Master just after he broke through to the Emperor Realm. Wait until this Young Master becomes a Great Emperor, then destroying you will be as easy as waving his hand. Hurry up and let Senior Duan come out to talk.”

“You…” After Wu Kuang uttered a word, Duan Hong Chen rapidly took over his body again, “Brat, now you can see that this Old Master’s body doesn’t only have his own Soul, but also that old fart, Wu Kuang’s Soul. Due to his interference, this Old Master cannot self-destruct with him, and also has no way to drive him out, making me neither human nor ghost. What’s the point of me living like this?”

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat hearing him and hurriedly comforted, “Senior, don’t give up. It’s just a bout of bad luck. Since the Heavens arranged it this way, there definitely has to be a good reason.”

“Tell this Old Master then, what good reason is there? If you can convince this Old Master, he won’t blame you for saving his life.”

Yang Kai was on the verge of crying. How could he have known that saving a life would cause so much trouble? And he was just trying to comfort Duan Hong Chen by saying what he did, he didn’t actually know if there was any bright spot in this incident. After pondering for a while though, he explained, “Senior Duan, think about it, now that Wu Kuang’s Soul is in your body, even though it causes you a lot of inconveniences, in this case, you can also constantly monitor him. Under your watch, Wu Kuang can’t cause any troubles, and he can’t harm the Star Boundary in the future.”

Duan Hong Chen’s eyes lit up, nodding with a smile in agreement, “Good, what you say is correct.”

Yang Kai beamed, “Since the two Seniors will have to share the same body in the future, you two must live in harmony. Come and hold hands together. Be good friends from now on!”

Duan Hong Chen growled, “I’m afraid we can’t be friends. If this Old Master ever gets a chance, I will self-destruct. Wu Kuang, you better sleep with one eye open and never let your guard down.”

Yang Kai broke into a cold sweat again. He did not know how Wu Kuang, who was hiding in Duan Hong Chen’s body, felt about this.

It took him so much effort to finally seize half of Duan Hong Chen’s body in order to keep his own Soul alive, but now, he had to constantly be alert against the original owner of the body as each passing moment, Duan Hong Chen would be trying to self-destruct. It would surely be an exhausting existence.

“Good, since that’s settled for now, let’s return to the Shattered Star Sea,” Yang Kai straightened up his body.

Duan Hong Chen shook his head, “I’m afraid we can’t go back to the Shattered Star Sea now.”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai looked at him with a puzzled face.

Duan Hong Chen replied, “Wu Kuang’s previous shelter was the core of the Shattered Star Sea, but that place has been ruined by our battle and the Shattered Star Sea will collapse as a result.

Yang Kai was paralyzed with fear, whispering, “The Shattered Star Sea is going to collapse? Then what about the people inside?”

Although he had out Liu Yan, Zhang Ruo Xi, and Mo Xiao Qi in the Sealed World Bead, Hua Qing Si was still out in the Shattered Star Sea, as well as Xia Sheng, Murong Xiao Xiao, Xiao Bai Yi, and the other elite disciples from the Four Territories of the Star Boundary. If these elites all died as a result of the collapse of the Shattered Star Sea, it would be a severe loss to the Star Boundary and would shake its foundations for hundreds of years.

Duan Hong Chen calmly answered, “Don’t worry. Before the Shattered Star Sea collapses, all of them would be ejected out of it and there won’t be any danger to their lives.

“That’s good to hear,” Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief.

“But from now on, there will be no more Shattered Star Sea and the young cultivators will have one less training ground in this world,” Duan Hong Chen continued with a feeling of sympathy. Although this entire Shattered Star Sea had been hiding Wu Kuang, this dreadfully dangerous villain, it was undeniable that the existence of the Shattered Star Sea contributed a lot of Emperor Realm Masters to the Star Boundary.

By the looks of the results of the Shattered Star Sea this time, the cultivators who had sufficient luck and aptitude had already broken through to the Emperor Realm, whereas those who had not been promoted might still have a chance to after entering retreat in their respective Sects.

It was conceivable that in the next ten, fifty, or even a hundred years, Emperor Realm Masters would continuously sprout up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

In fact, there had always been such a phenomenon after every opening of the Shattered Star Sea. New Emperor Realm Masters would be born unceasingly in the subsequent hundred or so years.

“It was inevitable,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Gains and losses go hand in hand. It is worth it to resolve the latent danger of Wu Kuang, even if the cost is the Shattered Star Sea.”

Duan Hong Chen looked at him and agreed, “You are right.”

While speaking, he slowly stood up, “Good, let’s leave this place first. Let this Old Master have a look… this is the Void, so in order to leave this place, we must find the weak part in the world barrier…”

He suddenly stopped and turned to look at Yang Kai in amazement, because Yang Kai was unleashing a wave of strange power from his whole body. He then stretched out his hands and swung fiercely, opening a crack in space.

“You’re also proficient in the Dao of Space?” Duan Hong Chen’s jaw dropped and his eyes gleamed in astonishment. Yang Kai’s previous performance was already impressive enough, but Duan Hong Chen never expected that he also cultivated the extremely esoteric Dao of Space. If Yang Kai was not proficient in manipulating Space Principles, how could he easily break through the Void Barrier? Even if it was Duan Hong Chen himself, he would need to search for a weak spot then use incredible force to stand a chance to escape from this place. Moreover, he had to be careful while attempting to leave, lest he cause a Void Collapse, trapping him in the Void forever.

Yang Kai grinned, “Just some paltry tricks. I’m sorry for my lack of skill in front of Senior.”

The corner of Duan Hong Chen’s mouth slightly twitched, “Amazing, amazing. Youngsters nowadays are truly amazing.”

Just when he finished his sentence, he suddenly fumed, “Duan Hong Chen, if it weren’t for you, this King would have already seized this brat’s body! This King is afraid that he will never be able to find such a terrific host again in the future!”

Yang Kai was speechless. Although he knew that the speaker was Wu Kuang, he was still not used to someone who could change his face faster than flipping through the pages of a book. He stretched his hand and gestured, “Senior Duan, after you.”

Duan Hong Chen nodded his head before taking the lead to walk out of the crack and disappearing. After his departure, Yang Kai followed leisurely.

A desolate view appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes after stepping out of the Void Crack.

The place was like a desert, with boundless yellow sands rolling on the ground. The wind billowed amongst the rising clouds, but nothing else could be seen within a radius of ten thousand kilometres.

Duan Hong Chen, who came out earlier than Yang Kai, was inspecting the surroundings. Yang Kai stood behind him and shaded his eyes with his hand, asking, “Senior Duan, what is this place?”

The only thing he could be sure of was that this place was somewhere in the Star Boundary. In other words, he had returned to the Star Boundary after coming out of the Void.

However, this place was definitely not the Northern Territory that he entered the Shattered Star Sea from, because the Northern Territory was a freezing cold place, and this landscape did not match with that at all.

After pondering for a moment, Duan Hong Chen revealed, “This should be the Purple Mountain Range in the Eastern Territory.”

“Eastern Territory?” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

Earlier, he planned to travel to the Eastern Territory after settling everything in the Shattered Star Sea to look for Xiao Xiao after he had inquired about him from Yin Le Sheng.

The journey to the Eastern Territory was long and perilous, and Yang Kai had initially planned to travel by using the Space Arrays in large cities or big Sects to cross the distance, but he did not expect to travel directly to the Eastern Territory through this odd coincidence.

This was a pleasant surprise.

“Do you have something to do in the Eastern Territory?” Duan Hong Chen glanced at Yang Kai curiously and seemed to have read his mind.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “Just a small personal matter.”

Duan Hong Chen did not press the matter and just nodded in understanding, “In that case, you and this Old Master will part ways here. Remember to always walk the righteous path in the Star Boundary, and act in a way that does not violate your conscience!”

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “Junior will not forget Senior’s advice.”

After speaking, he further asked, “Senior, don’t you want to return to Azure Sun Temple?”

Duan Hong Chen shook his head, “It’s not appropriate for this Old Master to appear in a crowded place in his current state. If you see Wen Zi Shan again in the future, don’t tell him about this Old Master. He worries too much.”

Yang Kai, “Junior understands.”

Duan Hong Chen nodded, and with a flicker, he instantly disappeared from the sand-filled land.

Yang Kai sighed lightly at the spot Duan Hong Chen was standing before he vanished.

Duan Hong Chen was obviously worried about Wu Kuang’s Soul in his body; therefore, he could not wait to part ways with him, and also dared not to go to places with lots of people. Yang Kai had no idea what Duan Hong Chen’s plans for the future were, but given that he had to share his body with Wu Kuang, there must be an enormous amount of trouble waiting for him. However, luckily, he could not self-destruct for now, so he still had the opportunity to find a way to cast Wu Kuang’s Soul out of his body in the future. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Nevertheless, he would definitely require tremendous strength to be able to do so.

After a while, Yang Kai summoned his wooden boat and flew off like a bolt of lightning.

About half a day later, Yang Kai finally reached the border of the sandy landscape when a green light captured his eyes.

When he flew closer, Yang Kai realized that the place turned out to be a small oasis.

Oases were extremely rare in the desert, and a small place like this could often save many lives and bring hope to people who lost their way. There were some traces of human activity in this oasis, but no one was here at the moment, and it seemed that it had not been visited for quite some time.

Yang Kai disembarked and found a clean place to sit before entering his Sealed World Bead.

Previously, during his promotion to the Emperor Realm, he had no choice but to extract a trace of World Force from the Sealed World Bead to counter the real world’s World Force which had descended upon him. He had no idea if this action had caused any harm to his Small Sealed World.

He did not have time to examine its situation after his breakthrough, and only now found some free time to do so.
