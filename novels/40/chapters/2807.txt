“Y-You…” In front of the dilapidated log house, the Village Chief looked at Yang Kai dumbfounded. His mouth was agape, and his murky eyes were filled with shock. He could barely speak a coherent sentence as a result.

Only one night had passed, but he discovered that Ah Niu had become a Shaman Apprentice!

[A Shaman Apprentice! I worked so hard throughout my entire life, and yet I am still just a Shaman Apprentice. I can’t believe Ah Niu achieved that in just one night! Compared to him, I have lived my entire life for nothing…]

He could sense that the vitality in Yang Kai’s body was extremely strong and the Shaman Strength lingering on the surface of Yang Kai’s body seemed to be several times more powerful than his, even though he was also a Shaman Apprentice. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Village Chief, time is pressing, so let’s not waste it on nonsense. Please teach me all the spells you know as soon as possible.” Yang Kai went straight into the Village Chief’s log house. He had been in this village for three days now, so he only had two more days left. Naturally, he needed to hurry up.

Taken aback, the Village Chief followed Yang Kai inside obediently.

The two of them spent the whole morning studying. In addition to the few Shamanic Spells that the Village Chief taught to Yang Kai, the Village Chief also explained the divisions of the Shaman Strength.

Just yesterday, Yang Kai unlocked his Shaman Strength and was recognized by the ‘Barbarian Gods’. Strictly speaking, he could not be considered a true Shaman Apprentice at the time; however, he had become a true Shaman Apprentice today, which was the actual starting realm for Shamans.

Standing above the Shaman Apprentice was the Shaman Warrior, followed by the Shaman Master, Shaman Grandmaster, Shaman King, Shaman Saint, and the Shaman God which stood at the highest realm! Moreover, each realm was divided into three ranks: Low-Rank, Mid-Rank, and High-Rank.

For example, the Village Chief was a Mid-Rank Shaman Apprentice! Meanwhile, Yang Kai was now a genuine High-Rank Shaman Apprentice, one realm higher than the Village Chief and one step away from becoming a Shaman Warrior. Yang Kai could learn more powerful Shamanic Spells after becoming a Shaman Warrior, but it was a pity that the Village Chief did not know any such Shamanic Spells and could not teach them to him.

According to the Village Chief, the most powerful of them all, the Shaman Gods, were just legends among the many realms. No Shaman God had ever appeared. Although there were several Shaman Saints, they only belonged to the more powerful clans.

On the other hand, the Blue South Village belonged to the South Barbarian Clan. The strongest Shaman in the clan was only a Shaman King, a Great Realm lower than a Shaman Saint.

During the study session in the morning, Yang Kai not only learned how to read many ancient characters, but he also gained a deeper understanding of this ancient world. The second most important thing was that he learned the Bloodlust Spell!

That could be considered as the first harvest he gained in this Sealed World. The Ancient Barbarian Shaman’s cultivation method he learned yesterday was of no value as it only allowed him to cultivate in this world. That cultivation method would become useless once he left this Sealed World, but the Bloodlust Spell could occasionally be used.

However, the Village Chief had mentioned that the Bloodlust Spell he mastered was only the lowest level of the technique. Not only was the duration of the technique extremely short, but the backlash was also very severe. The Bloodlust Spell mastered by the Shaman Grandmasters of large clans was far better than the one the Village Chief knew. Even though there were still drawbacks to such spells, they did not cause the people to be weakened for several days as a consequence. It was just that one needed an equally strong ability to support the casting of such a powerful Bloodlust Spell.

At noon, Yang Kai walked out of the Village Chief’s house. It wasn’t that he did not seek to make more progress, but rather that the Village Chief had nothing else to teach him at the moment. Besides the ancient characters, the Village Chief had already taught Yang Kai everything he learned in his life. Meanwhile, Yang Kai learned and understood everything at once. His brilliance utterly shocked the Village Chief.

“From now on, come here every day to learn how to read for an hour. You can only rely on your own efforts to further your cultivation. I have nothing else to teach you.” When the Village Chief saw Yang Kai off, his tone was a little lonely and a little relieved.

Regardless of the era, the next generation would eventually overtake the previous. Even so, Yang Kai’s outstanding performance had made the Village Chief aware of his own incompetence and powerlessness.

All of a sudden, bursts of pained shouts and screams entered Yang Kai’s ears. He paled in shock, thinking that the village was under attack again, but upon lifting his head to look, he realized that he had been overthinking things. He saw that the villagers were gathered in a spacious place within the village and posing in extremely weird postures that could even redefine the limits of human shame, regardless of gender.

Their muscles trembled uncontrollably as large drops of sweat rolled off their skin and dripped onto the ground. Among all the various postures, the villagers seemed to insist on doing the most difficult ones. Occasionally, they even let out a scream or two but all insisted on continuing.

Yang Kai had sharp vision and vast experience, so he immediately realized that this was a kind of Body Tempering Art. Feeling surprised, he walked over to observe. He did not know what kind of effect this method of Body Tempering would bring, but he could tell just by looking at the physiques of the villagers in this Ancient Barbarian Race village that their Body Tempering Art was pretty impressive.

“Ah Niu!” Ah Hu had his head down with his hands propped against the ground and his body arched into the shape of a bow. When he saw Yang Kai walking over, he called out suddenly. Unfortunately, his expression changed drastically the moment he spoke. As if being struck by a heavy blow, his arched body suddenly bounced back and he flew out several tens of meters away before slamming into a tree and spitting out blood.

Yang Kai was shocked and hurriedly rushed over to help Ah Hu up, asking, “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine! I’m fine!” Ah Hu grinned from ear to ear. Reaching up, he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth as if he was accustomed to it, “Congratulations! I heard from the Village Chief that you unlocked your Shaman Strength!”

“It was a fluke!” Yang Kai smilingly replied.

Ah Hu shook his head in response, “That’s not a fluke; it’s a gift from the Barbarian Gods!” He patted Yang Kai on the shoulder heavily and earnestly said, “Ah Niu, you are a Shaman now, which means you will be the next Village Chief. You better cultivate well; the future of the village depends on you!”

Yang Kai responded with a wry smile. He would be leaving in two days, so what future could there be? However, he didn’t say much to these people that might be characters in an illusion. He simply changed the topic and said, “You seem to be in the middle of cultivating…”

Ah Hu said, “That’s right! Do you want to join us?”

Yang Kai nodded, “Sure! But, I don’t know how to do it.”

“Come! Come! I’ll teach you!” Ah Hu was extremely enthusiastic as he dragged Yang Kai into the training session, smiling very cheerfully as he did.

[Ah Niu is really different now. He has turned into a completely different person ever since he received the Barbarian Gods’ blessing. He used to refuse whenever I tried to drag him along to cultivate together, preferring to stay in his house rather than interact with the villagers. However, that very same Ah Niu now took the initiative to cultivate!] Naturally, Ah Hu was overjoyed beyond words.

Even if Ah Niu was now a Shaman, a strong body was still fundamental. Thus, Ah Hu immediately began to teach Yang Kai. These Ancient Barbarians were not Shamans and could not use Shaman Strength. Therefore, their cultivation was directed toward their bodies. In other words, it was Body Tempering!

In contrast to the rest of the villagers assuming different poses, Ah Hu explained the various movements of Body Tempering to Yang Kai, which he promptly memorized.

The body was not just crucial to the Ancient Barbarian Race, it could not be ignored in the present day either. Unfortunately, most present-day cultivators only focused on the improvement of their cultivation and neglected the tempering of their bodies. They were ignorant that the body was the carrier of all their power, and only with a mighty physical body could they exert their full strength. Yang Kai himself was a beneficiary of a powerful physical body, thus, he understood this concept very well.

The whole set of the Barbarian Body Tempering Arts took Yang Kai only an hour to master, but he was secretly surprised when he did. Although he had not personally cultivated nor verified the results yet, this Body Tempering Art was undoubtedly very sophisticated. [So, the Ancient Barbarian Race uses this Body Tempering Art… No wonder all of them are as strong as Dragons and Tigers!]

Regardless of whether this place was an illusion or whether the people and the things that he was in contact with were illusions, this set of Barbarian Body Tempering Arts alone was enough to make this trip worthwhile.

Since his physical body was incredibly strong, this Body Tempering Art could not bring about much improvement to him personally; however, that was not the case for the disciples of High Heaven Palace nor his friends and relatives back in Heng Luo Star Field. If they cultivated this Barbarian Body Tempering Art, their physiques would certainly improve several times over. It would also make it easier for them to progress with their cultivation.

After experimenting in person, Yang Kai became certain of his conjecture. This Barbarian Body Tempering Art was very impressive. Cultivating it in his current body was a little strenuous even for him. Moreover, his muscles seemed to have become denser while his entire body was sore.

The whole afternoon was spent cultivating, and when night fell, many of the villagers finally returned home, exhausted. Meanwhile, Ah Hu warmly welcomed Yang Kai over to his house.

Thinking about the lack of food back home, Yang Kai decided that he might as well grab a free meal at Ah Hu’s place and nodded in agreement.

This lifestyle repeated for the next two days. Yang Kai spent an hour in the mornings to learn ancient characters at the Village Chief’s house, then he joined Ah Hu and the rest in their Body Tempering training. When night fell, he would return to his log house, sit down cross-legged, and cultivate in meditation.

Without the supplement of Monster Beast meat and Monster Cores though, Yang Kai’s cultivation speed slowed greatly. He had not been able to break through to the Shaman Warrior Realm even though two days had passed.

Still, it didn’t matter anymore. It was already the fifth day and the one-month deadline was almost here. It was time for Yang Kai to say goodbye to this world, so sitting in his log house, he no longer looked for anybody and waited to be kicked out of this Sealed World.

…

Three days later, Ah Hu knocked on the door. Soon, the door opened and Yang Kai looked out with bloodshot eyes.

“Ah Niu, why didn’t you show up over the past few days? The Village Chief told me to check up on you! Everybody is very worried about you!”

Hundreds of villagers stood uniformly behind Ah Hu. Even Ah Ni, who was brought to tears because of Yang Kai the other night, stood among the crowd, her beautiful eyes filled with concern.

“Did something happen?” Ah Hu asked nervously.

“It’s nothing. I was just cultivating the Shamanic Spell the Village Chief taught me and lost track of time. I’m sorry for worrying you all,” Yang Kai forced a smile.

Upon hearing those words, Ah Hu breathed out in relief, “That’s great. We thought… Oh, right! The Village Chief mentioned that he wants to bring back the dead beasts from the canyon you mentioned, so we need you to lead the way. It’s going to start snowing again, so we won’t be able to leave the village anymore if we don’t go soon.”

“Alright. You get organized and I’ll come find you in a bit!” Yang Kai replied before closing the door again, all the while roaring in his heart, [What the hell is going on?!]
