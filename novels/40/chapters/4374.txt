Among all the seven Elements, Yin and Yang were much harder to find than Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. Yang Kai had spent lots of Open Heaven Pills to buy all sorts of materials, so he was fully aware of that.

Yue He was now a part of Void Land, so it was reasonable that she didn’t have any Sixth-Order Yin Element treasures on her. That was because many people in Void Land needed Sixth-Order materials right now, and such materials were difficult to come by. Be it the items Yang Kai had acquired back then or the new Sixth-Order materials that had appeared in the Star City, they were all given to the cultivators who needed them in Void Land, so there was basically nothing left.

Certainly, Bai Qi and Qu Hua Shang didn’t have one either. The former had followed the Proprietress for a long time. If there were any precious items, the Proprietress would keep them and only give them to him when needed. As for the latter, even though she was a Core Disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, she had just ascended to the Sixth-Order. Hence, she didn’t need any Sixth-Order materials to improve her cultivation for now.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected that he would have to ascend to the Open Heaven Realm when he left Void Land, which was why he hadn’t prepared anything. Although he had made up his mind, he didn’t have the item he needed, and even the cleverest woman could not cook a meal without rice.

All of them appeared embarrassed in this situation.

Yang Kai glared at Zhu Jiu Yin and asked, “You’d been accumulating wealth for a long time in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Why don’t you even have a single Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure?”

Zhu Jiu Yin rolled her eyes and replied, “This Queen doesn’t need those things to cultivate, so what’s the point of collecting them? Moreover, it’s also hard to find Yin and Yang materials in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.”

This was giving Yang Kai a headache as he didn’t know what to do.

Across from them, Ti Zheng and the others were supposed to be at ease. As soon as Yang Kai ascended to the Open Heaven Realm, the burden on their shoulders would be lifted. However, this unexpected situation rendered them speechless at that instant.

Certainly, they were more than happy to see Yang Kai ascending to the Open Heaven Realm at this point as he would no longer be a threat to them once he did. Although they hadn’t managed to kill him as they had planned, the outcome was acceptable as they could explain themselves to the great forces behind them.

However, it would be troublesome for them as well if Yang Kai couldn’t achieve an ascension because there wasn’t a Yin Element material available.

Since they were not able to kill everyone here, they wouldn’t dare to make a move on a member of the Dragon Clan; otherwise, they would have to face the Dragon Clan’s wrath. Nevertheless, they were not willing to let Yang Kai go just like this.

While they were in a dilemma, they saw Yang Kai staring at them.

The corners of Ti Zheng’s brow twitched as he asked vigilantly, “Why are you looking at me?”

Yang Kai snorted, “Since you want me to ascend to the Open Heaven Realm here, I’m willing to grant your wish; however, you should show me some sincerity in return.”

“What do you mean?” Ti Zheng furrowed his brows.

“Stop asking the obvious. You know what I want.”

A speechless Ti Zheng gazed at him and fell silent for a moment before parting his lips to secretly speak to his companions. Although he was a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he didn’t have a Sixth-Order Yin Element material on hand; therefore, he could only ask the others whether they had such an item.

If they could solve this issue by offering up a Sixth-Order Yin Element material, it would be acceptable. Although Ti Zheng was displeased, he still suppressed his anger.

However, after asking around, he realised that none of them had such a resource.

Just like Zhu Jiu Yin, they had some Sixth-Order materials but not Yin and Yang ones. That was because Yin and Yang materials were extremely rare. Even if they obtained such items, they either had to give them to their respective Sects for the disciples’ cultivation needs or refine these items themselves. The Cave Heavens and Paradises were extremely powerful, so they needed more of these rare resources compared to Void Land.

Ti Zheng glanced at Yang Kai and declared, “None of us have a Sixth-Order Yin Element material.”

Yang Kai’s face fell, “All of you are Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters who are filthy rich, and you’re telling me that none of you has a single Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure. Do you think I was born yesterday?”

Ti Zheng snapped, “Believe it or not, we don’t have the item you need!”

Upon hearing the reply, Yang Kai put on a sneer.

His expression enraged Ti Zheng. Instead of getting prepared for his ascension, Yang Kai was now blaming others for not having the item he needed, which was ridiculous. However, after giving it a thought, Ti Zheng realised that Yang Kai had always focused on looking for a High-Rank Yin Element treasure in order to ascend to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm. Even if a Sixth-Order Yin Element material was presented to him in the past, he probably wouldn’t even spare it a glance. This time, he was forced to achieve a breakthrough, so it was expected that he wasn’t prepared.

After a cough, Ti Zheng said, “Do you want a Fifth-Order Yin Element? This Monarch has a very good Fifth-Order Heavenly Yin Sand, which is hard to come by. It’s the best kind of material in the Fifth-Order. If you want, this Monarch can give it to you.”

Yang Kai bellowed, “You may kill me, but you cannot humiliate me, Ti Zheng! You’ve forced me to ascend to the Sixth-Order, which is my bottom line, but now you want me to ascend to the Fifth-Order? What is this? Regardless of how great that Heavenly Yin Sand may be, it’s still a Fifth-Order material! Can it help me ascend to the Sixth-Order? Why don’t we just fight it out and leave the rest to fate?”

Upon realising that his suggestion was indeed unrealistic, Ti Zheng fell silent. Yang Kai had built such a solid foundation, and he was gifted enough to become a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master directly. He was practically forced to ascend to the Sixth-Order, so it would be outrageous if they still asked him to lower his expectations further and become a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master. If they pushed him over the edge now, this young man might do something crazy to retaliate against them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

If they got into a fight again, they wouldn’t dare to ruthlessly kill Yang Kai. By then, they would be the ones who suffered losses.

After giving it a thought, Ti Zheng asked, “Why don’t you wait here for a while? This Monarch will send a message and tell someone to bring a Sixth-Order Yin Element material over.”

In fact, he was completely vexed deep inside. His goal was to kill Yang Kai to nip this problem in the bud, but things had come to a point that he seemed to be begging the young man to achieve an ascension as soon as possible. Moreover, he had to prepare a Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure for him, which was simply preposterous.

He had lived for a long time, but there had never been a time when he felt so vexed.

Yang Kai asked in a grim voice, “How long will it take?”

Ti Zheng replied, “It’s unrealistic to go back to Myriad Demons Heaven now; however, this Monarch can tell someone to buy a Sixth-Order Yin Element material in the Shattered Heaven’s Star City where all sorts of goods are available, so it shouldn’t be difficult to find the item you want. It’ll probably take one month for the thing to be sent here.”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, “That’s a long wait.”

Ti Zheng frowned, “It’s just one month.”

Yang Kai said, “I can’t wait any longer.”

“What do you want then?”

Yang Kai reminded him, “I want a Sixth-Order Yin Element material right now.”

Ti Zheng bellowed, “I told you we don’t have one. Do you want this Monarch to make it appear out of thin air?”

“I don’t believe you!” Yang Kai swept a glance over the Space Rings on their fingers, “Unless you let me examine your rings.”

The faces of the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters fell. Ti Zheng stared coldly at Yang Kai and snapped, “Brat, do you know what you’re talking about?”

“Are you going to agree to it or not?” Yang Kai sneered and gazed arrogantly at him, “Fine, I don’t want to see your rings anymore. Let’s go back to Void Land. I don’t believe I’ll never get a High-Rank Yin Element treasure in my lifetime!”

Then, he seemed ready to bring everyone back home in a resolute manner.

Ti Zheng questioned, “Are you going to let Lan You Ruo perish here?”

Yang Kai shot him a glance, “You’d better pray that she’s safe. If anything happens to her, I’ll destroy Myriad Demons Heaven right after I ascend to the Ninth-Order. I’ll remember what you’ve done to me and visit all of you one by one when the time comes. I hope you’ll still be able to laugh by then.”

“Impudence!” Ti Zheng roared.

“Wait a moment, Little Friend Yang,” another High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master suddenly spoke up. His voice suggested that he was pretty old now.

Yang Kai shot him a cold glance, “What now?”

...

The old voice was heard saying, “Since you’re a Half-Step Open Heaven Realm Master, it must have been quite some time since you started cultivating. So, you should know that a Space Ring is the most personal possession to a cultivator and it mustn’t be examined by anyone else easily. If you want to inspect our rings, it’s no different from humiliating us. We’ve lived for a long time, so we do have a reputation to preserve.”

Yang Kai scoffed, “You four are High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, but you joined forces and plotted against an Emperor Realm cultivator like me. I’m surprised to learn that you actually still care about your reputation.”

The old voice replied impassively, “If you were on your own, all of us wouldn’t have shown up; however, since you have some powerful protectors, we have no choice but to come all the way here, but now is not the time to talk about such things. What this Old Master means is, we can let you examine our rings to prove to you that we didn’t lie to you. We really don’t have the Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure you need; however, what if you still don’t find any Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure after going through all of our rings?”

“What do you want?” Yang Kai questioned.

The old voice said, “Since you want to humiliate us, we can’t possibly bear it for nothing. There’s a price you have to pay, little friend.”

Yang Kai swept an impassive glance over them and frowned. After giving it a thought, he suddenly said through clenched teeth, “I don’t believe that you don’t have a Sixth-Order Yin Element material, but if I still can’t find one after examining all of your rings, I’ll ascend to the Fifth-Order.”

His expression was that of a gambler who had lost it all.

Upon hearing that, all of them were stunned.

An anxious Yue He said, “You can’t do that, Young Master!”

Yang Kai was unable to ascend to the Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm, so the Sixth-Order was supposed to be his bottom line; the Fifth-Order was totally unacceptable. If he ascended to the Fifth-Order, the highest limit for him would be the Seventh-Order in the future. In other words, the end of Yang Kai’s Martial Dao was his initial starting point. The disparity between expectation and reality was too great to bear.

Bai Qi said, “You mustn’t ascend to the Fifth-Order, Yang Kai!”

...

Qu Hua Shang also dissuaded him from doing so.

Yang Kai put on a bitter smile, “I can’t ascend to the Seventh-Order, and there isn’t a Sixth-Order Yin Element treasure now. What can I do if I don’t ascend to the Fifth-Order? Wait for them to get the item I want from the Shattered Heaven’s Star City? Who knows what could happen to Proprietress in one month, we can’t wait any longer.” As he spoke, he secretly winked at Yue He, “Do you remember that thing I have?”

Yue He, who was about to dissuade him again, became startled as she suddenly thought of something.

[That’s right. Young Master still has ‘that’ thing. With that item in his possession, it makes no difference whether he ascends to the Fifth-Order or Sixth-Order, he can even use this to trick others into believing that he’ll only become a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master and stop them from targeting him. In that case, it’s not necessarily a bad thing.]
