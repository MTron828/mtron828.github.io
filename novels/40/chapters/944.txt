Chapter 945, Own People

It took a full three days of work but finally, everyone arrived safely through the Void Corridor in Tong Xuan Realm.

Within a radius of fifty kilometres, many cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty had found suitable places, sat down cross-legged, and immersed themselves in the Heavenly Law and Martial Dao, shaking off the shackles which had chained them and breaking through to the next realm.

Because of the differences between the World Principles, all the cultivators arriving in Tong Xuan Realm were able to obtain a certain promotion in their strength.

The cultivators who were on the verge of a breakthrough could naturally take advantage of this opportunity to advance in one fell swoop.

This was also the case when Yang Kai first set foot in this world.

When the Ancient Demon Clan was brought out of the Mysterious Small World by Yang Kai, they too had experienced such a phenomenon.

Now, it was the turn of these cultivators from the Great Han Dynasty. Yang Kai was well aware that this would happen so he had cleared out the surrounding fifty-kilometre radius to ensure all his friends and family would have a safe environment to break through.

Of the several thousand people who had come to Tong Xuan Realm, at least one-third of them immediately achieved a breakthrough, and while the others weren’t as lucky as them, they were still quite satisfied as their own cultivation having experienced some improvements, scattering themselves about to stand guard for their companions who were in the midst of their breakthroughs.

Qiu Yi Meng flew over from a spot about ten kilometers away, grinding her teeth as she muttered under her breath, seemingly cursing something or someone.

Quickly arriving in front of Yang Kai, she leaned in and stared deeply at him, “Is this the ‘big present’ you prepared for me?”

“Not satisfied?” Yang Kai grinned.

“I’ve very satisfied with it, but what does it have to do with you? Open your eyes and look around for yourself. So many people are breaking through...” Qiu Yi Meng swept her hand around at the countless cultivators sitting cross-legged on the ground and inhaling the rich World Energy.

“Since you’re satisfied then you shouldn’t have anything to complain about, right?”

“Mark my words, I’ll make you regret disappointing this woman!” Qiu Yi Meng stamped her foot bitterly and no longer had enough patience to deal with Yang Kai, stomping off to where the Qiu Family had gathered.

Yang Kai scratched his head and wore a helpless look.

“Holy Master!” At that time, Shi Kun suddenly appeared and hurriedly said, “There is a large group of people approaching here and their demeanor is quite imposing.”

“Who are they?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Subordinate has not had enough time to investigate, but the other party is led by a Saint Realm master.”

“I’ll take a look,” Yang Kai said in a disgruntled tone. The only big force nearby was Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple, but after losing so many masters here, Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple seemed to have vanished. Before beginning the migration, Yang Kai had even let Li Rong go to the Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple to survey the situation, but upon her return, she actually reported that the Sect was deserted.

Yang Kai couldn’t help wondering which group of ignorant people had now decided to run over.

Before he could go far, Yang Kai spotted some small black spots on the horizon that were rapidly approaching. As time passed, the figures among this group became clearer and clearer.

Sweeping this group of newcomers with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly became strange.

Among these people, he found that there was only a single First Order Saint Realm expert, the rest were just Transcendents and Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivators.

What he found strange though was not the strength of these people, but that there were many familiar auras among them.

After carefully examining them, Yang Kai suddenly burst into wry laughter.

The group of cultivators who were approaching had obviously also determined the situation here and stopped a kilometre or so out, their leader calling out, “May I ask, are several friends members of Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple? This humble one is Dragon Phoenix Palace’s Palace Master, Chen Zhou. I would like to consult with you about a certain matter.”

“Dragon Phoenix Palace?” Li Rong, who stood behind Yang Kai, wrinkled her brow, not having any impression of this Sect.

“They’re our own people,” Yang Kai said casually before shouting back, “Is Sun Yu with you?”

As soon as this question came out, the Dragon Phoenix Palace cultivators all frowned deeply and Palace Master Chen Zhou swiftly moved his body to cover a young man inside the crowd, preventing Yang Kai from seeing him.

“Disciple, someone is calling for you. Do you have a friend in Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple?” Ling Jian turned a suspicious look towards Sun Yu who was being protected on all sides.

As his master, Ling Jian knew best the life experiences of this disciple of his.

Sun Yu had been picked up by Ling Jian at a very young age and brought to the Dragon Phoenix Palace to cultivate. In all these years, Sun Yu had never left Dragon Phoenix Palace, in fact, if he had not strongly insisted on coming here now, how could Ling Jian dare bring him out so easily?

Now, Sun Yu was the hope of all of Dragon Phoenix Palace, he absolutely couldn’t have any accidents.

As a young man who had never left Dragon Phoenix Palace, how could Sun Yu have made an acquaintance in Free And Unfettered Spirit Temple? Ling Jian was genuinely confused.

Palace Master Chen Zhou also turned his attention to Sun Yu and asked, “Do you know the person who just shouted?”

Sun Yu, however, was so ecstatic he didn’t even respond to his Master or Palace Master Chen and instead stepped out from the crowd with a look of awe on his face and shouted, “Is that you, Senior Yang?”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, “Yes!”

“It really is Senior Yang!” Sun Yu was overjoyed and couldn’t help rushing forward, leaving his fellow disciples and Elders behind as he flew over towards Yang Kai.

The masters from Dragon Phoenix Palace were shocked by this sudden development and quickly chased after him.

“Elder Ling, what background does this Senior Yang Sun Yu speaks of posses? Why does he seem so enthusiastic to meet him?” As they sped along, Chen Zhou asked curiously.

“This old master doesn’t know either,” Ling Jian was also confused.

As the spoke, everyone arrived in front of Yang Kai, Sun Yu looking more excited with every breath, respectfully cupping his fists, “Greetings Senior Yang. It turns out you already arrived here.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, lifting his eyes from Sun Yu and staring at the crowd behind him.

Almost every master from Dragon Phoenix Palace had come out and were even now carefully guarding Sun Yu, directing vigilant looks all around in case someone here was harbouring ill intentions.

“Right, let me introduce you,” Sun Yu said spiritedly as he pointed to Yang Kai, “This is Senior Yang.”

He then pointed to the people from Dragon Phoenix Palace and said, “This is our Palace Master, Chen Zhou, this is my Master, Ling Jian, this is Elder Xiao Ling, this is...

As he introduced everyone one by one, Yang Kai nodded and said hello.

“What qualifications does this young man have to be called Senior?” Chen Zhou asked somewhat unhappily.

Sun Yu was now the Dragon Emperor of his Dragon Phoenix Palace, his true status far more important than even his own as Palace Master, yet now, meeting this youth, Sun Yu had actually enthusiastically called him Senior, making Chen Zhou feel very uncomfortable, as if doing so was a disgrace to Sun Yu’s identity as Dragon Emperor.

If Yang Kai had been a middle-aged man, Chen Zhou wouldn’t have paid it much mind, but the young man in front of him was clearly less than thirty years old.

“Palace Master, Senior Yang has a great graciousness to me, you must not speak disrespectfully to him,” Sun Yu snorted.

Chen Zhou stunned, his face becoming somewhat awkward as he cupped his fists and said, “I hope this friend will not take offence, this Chen’s mouth is simply a bit frank, I meant no disrespect.”

“Palace Master Chen is too serious,” Yang Kai didn’t care. Seeing Chen Zhou immediately compromise because of a few words from Sun Yu, Yang Kai fully comprehended how much importance Chen Zhou attached to him.

Nearby, Dragon Phoenix Palace’s Elder Xiao Ling was starring at Shi Kun and after hesitating for a moment, asked, “Dare I ask if Your Excellency is Elder Shi Kun of Nine Heavens Holy Land?”

“It is this Shi, have we met before?” Shi Kun looked at him curiously.

Xiao Ling smiled widely and called out in a fluster, “No wonder Your Excellency looked familiar. Six months ago, this Xiao once travelled to Nine Heavens Holy Land to seek the assistance of your Sect’s honoured Alchemy Grandmaster. At that time, Elder Shi Kun was sitting outside the nine peaks inside the stone pavilion so this Xiao had seen your face, but Elder Shi Kun probably does not have any impression of me.”

“Is that so...” Shi Kun nodded, every time he was on duty outside the nine peaks, he would see and greet dozens of people, how could remember all of them?

“Your Dragon Phoenix Palace came to request Alchemy services?” Yang Kai turned to Sun Yu and asked.

“En, Elder Xiao came back and said that there were many people waiting in line so he had to wait for a month before it was his turn,” Sun Yu laughed foolishly.

“Later if you need pills just ask me directly, you don’t have to wait in line,” Yang Kai declared.

In an instant, the look all the Dragon Phoenix Palace masters were directing at Yang Kai changed greatly.

Chen Zhou stammered as he hesitantly asked, “May I ask what relationship you have with Yang Kai, the Holy Master of Nine Heavens Holy Land?”

With the Holy Land Elder Shi Kun standing respectfully behind Yang Kai, it was clear who had the higher status.

Sun Yu had also called him Senior Yang.

Chen Zhou had a sharp mind and was quickly able to put together these clues, arriving at a certain possibility.

“This is my Holy Land’s Holy Master!” Shi Kun solemn replied.

Everyone from Dragon Phoenix Palace was shocked as they stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Chen Zhou’s expression became quite awkward as he cupped his fists and bowed, “So it is Holy Master Yang, a moment ago this Chen acted impolitely and offensively, I humbly request Holy Master Yang forgive my indiscretion.”

When he first saw him, Chen Zhou was unaware of Yang Kai’s identity and had even questioned him; how could he have known that this young man was actually one of the most prominent figures in the world?

The gulf in strength between Dragon Phoenix Palace and Nine Heavens Holy Land was enormous, if his boorish actions just now really angered Yang Kai, Dragon Phoenix Palace would definitely suffer a terrible end. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Realizing this, Chen Zhou couldn’t help feeling afraid as a chill shot up his spine.

“Palace Master Chen does not need to worry, I am a friends with Sun Yu, naturally I won’t care about such trivial things,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Friends...” The masters from Dragon Phoenix Palace were all dumbfounded once again, each and every one of them showing an excited look, as if being friends with Yang Kai was a great honour.

Turning their gazes back to Sun Yu, their eyes filled with even greater worship.

Each of them was thinking in their hearts that the Dragon Emperor really was worthy of his title, even able to make friends with this grade of character.

He was still so young and weak yet he had won the favour of Nine Heavens Holy Land’s Holy Master. It also seemed like this Holy Master Yang was a man of great vision and had seen through Sun Yu’s extraordinariness.

As the masters from Dragon Phoenix Palace indulged in their flights of fancy and smiled happily to themselves, Yang Kai looked to Sun Yu and asked, “How come you are here?”

Sun Yu scratched his head, “Previously, Senior Yang asked me to inquire about a certain piece of news so when the Sect finally got word of a Mysterious Small World that seemed related to Senior Yang’s request, I requested to come investigate it personally. I didn’t think that Senior Yang would also be here though.”

“En, I also heard about it recently and came to investigate.”

“Then these people are...” Sun Yu swept his eyes around and soon discovered that there were some four or five thousand people gathered nearby, astonishing him greatly.
