The two Huo Family masters obviously thought it was the two Blood Warriors who had exposed their hiding place.

However, Qiu Yi Meng slowly shook his head and giggled lightly, “The two Blood Warriors are currently in meditative healing and have no time to meddle in such matters, but it was also not I who discovered Seniors. I don’t have such great skill.”

“Then...”

“Hehe, Junior will take her leave here,” Qiu Yi Meng didn’t say much, just smiling brightly as she turned around.

The Qiu Family’s Eldest Daughter was as sharp as she was charming and excelled at making others dance to her tune, although she was always suppressed in front of Yang Kai, it was quite different with all the others.

At this time, she didn’t reveal anything; leaving the two Huo Family masters with some questions would only lead to greater benefits for Yang Kai right now.

After Qiu Yi Meng left, the two old men looked at the wine pots in their hands and sighed.

They also understood who it was that had sent Qiu Yi Meng, but they simply couldn’t understand how Yang Kai had found them.

“What do we do now?” One of them muttered with a frown.

The other master’s face was also ugly, shaking his head slowly, “Haa... We’ve been duped, now that we’ve accepted these two pots of wine, tonight...”

“This Young Lord Kai is really sinister.”

This was no doubt a case of offering gifts to exploit one’s weakness. Although it was only two pots of wine, it had been personally delivered to them by Young Lady Qiu. The so-called light courtesy, heavy affection. Having accepted such a gift, when crisis befell Yang Kai tonight, could they still just stand by and watch?

If it was someone else who had come to deliver wine to them, even if it was Yang Kai himself, these two masters could have simply rejected, but there was no way for them to refuse Qiu Yi Meng.

“But Patriarch hasn’t let us officially participate in the Inheritance War yet, not to mention that, over the years, although many forces would dispatched Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh or Eighth Stage masters to assist, some even sending out Peak Masters, but the other Seven Great Families would never send anyone who exceeded Immortal Ascension Boundary Fifth Stage. If we were to expose ourselves and someone were to recognize us... what face would our Huo Family have left?”

“Should we send this wine back then?” One person proposed.

The other person nodded, “Good, you send it!”

“Go to hell!”

Sending this wine back, wasn’t that like slapping Young Lady Qiu’s face? Who would do something so stupid?

“Haa...” Shaking their heads and sighing, the two masters suddenly felt that these two pots of wine were burning lumps of iron instead.

With no way out, each of them took up their wine and drank it down, but there was no mellowness in their mouths, only a strong bitter aroma accompanied by a long aftertaste of helplessness.

As time slowly passed and sunset approached, a few bright stars began emerging, shimmering like gems in the darkening sky above, painting a beautiful and tranquil picture.

Inside War City, the noise of the day gradually calmed.

Tens of thousands of eyes were all staring at the movements of the Eight Young Lords.

A potent group of Divine Senses spread out over War City. These powerful and tyrannical Divine Sense belonged to a group of masters whose purpose was to observe the Inheritance War’s progress.

The center of War City, Seal Temple.

In this majestic palace, around an octagonal table, sat eight white-haired old men.

Each of these eight people appeared as tranquil as ancient wells as they slowly circulating their Secret Arts. It seems like they had completely removed themselves from all distractions from the outside world, but in fact the Divine Senses of these eight people had penetrated every corner of War City.

These eight people belonged to the Central Capital’s Eight Great Families, each one a top master at the Above Immortal Ascension Boundary!

When the Yang Family Inheritance War launched, War City became the gathering place the world’s young talents, almost all of them the leaders of their respective forces’ younger generation.

So every time the Inheritance War was held, the Eight Great Families would all respectively send an Above Immortal Ascension Boundary master to War City first to oversee the progress of the Inheritance War, and secondly to protect the young geniuses who had come to participate.

Were these masters not present and a strong master from the Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land snuck in, the loss to the Great Han Dynasty would be unimaginable.

These eight people were all over a hundred years old, the eldest even reaching the two hundred year mark, essentially half a neck into the grave. For these masters, they would not involve themselves with their families’ affairs, nor would they trouble themselves with worldly matters, instead solely cultivating the Martial Dao.

Although they were here, they would not interfere in the Inheritance War, their only responsibility was to supervise the outcome, and defend War City against external threats.

Whoever won or lost was not their concern.

At their age and with their cultivation realm, their entire focus was unravelling the mysteries of the Above Immortal Ascension Boundary.

At the eight Young Lords’ respective bases, some people were eager to move, some were worried and anxious, some prepared to sit back and watch the show from a distance, while others were waited to reap the fisherman’s benefits.

The differences in strength each one possessed naturally produced different mentalities.

The sun had finally set and the night grew deeper and deeper, but the eight Young Lords still showed no signs of movement, so many people who were looking forward to spectating the various battles held their breath and waited.

Yang Kai, with his hands behind his back, stood straight as a sword before his mansion, staring up at a flag hanging at the building’s highest point.

In the Inheritance War, this flag was also a vital symbol.

There were two ways to eliminate a Young Lord from the Inheritance War.

One was to capture the person directly, so that the Young Lord lost the qualification to continue.

The second however was related to this flag.

Once someone had taken this flag, the corresponding Young Lord would also lose the qualification to participate.

Moreover, this flag had to be hung in the position directly atop the mansion’s highest point and could not be carried on one’s body.

The Yang Family had used these rules for all of its past generations, it was probably designed as a way for the Young Lords to have more than one way to win, and also to increase the level of difficulty, forcing them to display their wisdom and wits to the very limit.

The flag hanging here was a constraint imposed on these Young Lords by the Yang Family!

Someone always had to guard this flag, in case an opponent tried to steal it. If it was lost, it meant elimination.

On the one hand, there was a need to protect your own flag, and on the other hand, it was necessary to think of ways to snatch others’ flags. The Inheritance War was also a battle of wits.

Looking at the big flag fluttering out in the open, Yang Kai’s mouth curled into a smirk.

Behind Yang Kai stood the Qiu Family’s First Young Lady Qiu Yi Meng, the Central Capital Wolf Huo Xing Chen, and the Xiang Family’s Second Young Lord Xiang Tian Xiao.

As of right now, all of Yang Kai’s allies had gathered here.

“Brother Kai, are you ready to hand over your Golden Feather Eagle to me?” Huo Xing Chen smiled dismissively as he swung his folding fan, “Let me tell you now, if anyone comes here looking for a fight, I’ll be the first to surrender. Don’t expect me to help you.”

Qiu Yi Meng glanced over at him coldly, “If you keep spewing nonsense I’ll give you a dozen slaps and then throw you out.”

“Hey hey hey, you’re a woman, aren’t you? Why must you act so violently?” Huo Xing Chen said with a depressed expression.

Xiang Tian Xiao quickly added, “My Xiang Family’s troops will cooperate with you, deploy us as you see fit.”

“Feel free to arrange yourselves,” Yang Kai glanced over at him and replied casually.

Xiang Tian Xiao frowned but didn’t say a word, instead just turning around and walking off, apparently planning to deploy the people he had brought with him. The strength of his group wasn’t very high, although there were four who had reached the Immortal Ascension Boundary, in the face of real masters, they wouldn’t last long.

The only good thing was that tonight was the first day of the Inheritance War, so the other Young Lords also shouldn’t have too much available power, so the people he had brought could still play an important role.

“Now that we’ve reached this point, isn’t it time to tell me what you plan to do?” Qiu Yi Meng asked with a smile, “Do you have some hidden allies somewhere? When are they going to show up?”

However, Yang Kai just shook his head, “I don’t have any hidden help, what you see here now is my complete current strength.”

“Seriously?” Qiu Yi Meng’s beautiful face twitched slightly.

“I’m not lying to you this time!” Yang Kai said seriously.

“How are you going to defend this place then?” The Qiu Family’s Eldest Daughter suddenly panicked. Although the two Blood Warriors were incredibly powerful, how much strength could they display right now? Even counting the cultivators from the Xiang Family and her own Autumn Rain Hall, it really wasn’t enough to turn any spray.

As long as any of Yang Kai’s brothers could send out two Immortal Ascension Boundary Seventh or Eighth Stage masters, it would be enough for them to conquer this place. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

And right now, amongst the Yang Family Young Lords, there were at least three people who could send out these kinds of masters!

“It’s too late for you to regret it now,” Yang Kai said as he stared at Qiu Yi Meng coldly.

Feeling his gaze, Qiu Yi Meng’s brow wrinkled, suddenly realizing something, letting out a light laugh as she shook her head, “No, I believe in you.”

“Hahaha, well I don’t believe in you,” Huo Xing Chen laughed raucously as he walked off. “I’m going to find some bird food, I need to get a gift for my new eagle.”

Saying so, he quickly disappeared.

When there were only two people left in front of the main entrance, Yang Kai suddenly said, “I want to go out!”

Qiu Yi Meng’s face suddenly changed colour as she hesitantly asked, “Go out? What do you want to do?”

“What do you think?”

The Qiu Family’s First Young Lady looked at Yang Kai incredulously, her mouth slightly agape, hoping that he was just joking, but seeing Yang Kai’s calm expression, she knew he was being serious.

“Are you sure?”

“Naturally, in the Inheritance War, if you defeat an opponent you can gain a lot of benefits! Tonight is the first day so someone will surely be eliminated. This is a golden opportunity!”

If there were no benefits to be won from defeating an opponent, none of the participating Young Lords would proactively take the offensive, after all, attacking another’s stronghold was a time and resource consuming endeavor that would draw forces away from protecting one’s own flag.

As long as you could capture a Yang Family Yong Lord, or obtain their flag, you could exchange them with the main family for a lot of supplies.

“Are you crazy?” Qiu Yi Meng looked at Yang Kai with an amazed expression, “You don’t even have enough strength to defend your base yet you want to take the initiative to attack? Who are you planning to take with you? My Autumn Rain Hall, or the people from the Xiang Family? Or perhaps the two Blood Warriors?”

The first two groups wouldn’t have much effect even if they went with Yang Kai while the latter two leaving would be the same as leaving his flag completely undefended.

“I’m going alone!” Yang Kai frowned.

“No!” Qiu Yi Meng yelled, her full chest heaving up and down as she snapped at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suddenly smiled and stared at her undulating peaks, decisively saying, “I wasn’t asking for your opinion, only informing you about my decision, whatever I decide to do, no one has the right to object!”

Qiu Yi Meng’s expression suddenly became bitter, grinding her teeth in anger.

After a long time, she took a deep breath and let out a sigh, “Good, since you’ve decided so, I’m too lazy to try convincing you otherwise. If you lose tonight, it just means that I, Qiu Yi Meng, was blind to follow such a man!”

“Woman, don’t say these kinds of easily misunderstood words!” Yang Kai sneered, “Besides, who wins or loses tonight hasn’t been decided yet!”
