[How is this a Knowledge Sea? It’s clearly Hell.]

A group of foolish small ghosts sensed the presence of a strange aura and together, pounced at Yang Kai; however, he destroyed all of them with a swing of his sabre before they could get close to him. Shaman Chei, who was snooping secretly, was appalled and eyed the long sabre with a complicated gaze, instinctively afraid of it.

[What is this Shaman Artifact? Why is it so strong?]

On top of that, Yang Kai even brought it into his own Knowledge Sea. How was that possible? There should not be such a majestic Shaman Artifact in this world!

Although the ghosts in his Knowledge Sea were also born out of living beings, they were nourished and refined by Chei himself, and ordinary ghosts were incomparable to them at all. They were capable of tearing up and consuming the Soul Avatar of even a Shaman King.

However, under the light swing of this sabre, Shaman Chei could clearly feel the fear the ghosts in his Knowledge Sea had, as if they were mice meeting a cat, not daring to get close to Yang Kai.

Holding the sabre in one hand, Yang Kai looked around and sneered, “Playing hide and seek? Shaman Chei, Shaman Chei, you are a Shaman King, aren’t you? Don’t be such a disappointment.”

Shaman Chei ignored him as no fool was capable of becoming a Shaman King. He would not dare to reveal himself before he understood what the long sabre Shaman Artifact was.

As if he could see through Shaman Chei’s inner fears, Yang Kai raised the sabre, flicked his wrist and declared, “This is the Soul Splitting sabre. It doesn’t harm the physique, but is instead designed to wound the Soul. Allowing this Young Master to enter your Knowledge Sea was your biggest mistake. So, now that you understand, Shaman Chei, come out and accept your death. This Young Master will show you mercy and make it quick for you.”

[Doesn’t harm the physique, but instead damages the Soul?] Shaman Chei did not want to believe such nonsense, but after what he witnessed, he had to admit that his opponent was right. This was definitely the most wicked Shaman Artifact he had ever seen.

“Good, good, good, you’re not showing yourself, right? Then just continue hiding!” Yang Kai sneered, holding up the Soul Splitting sabre as he poured Spiritual Energy into it before slashing downwards.

A massive sabre made of light that could tear apart this Knowledge Sea emerged. The sabre of light swung forward and the countless ghosts that tried to block it were all killed on the spot. Even Shaman Chei, who was hiding in the dark, felt excruciating pain, like his head was being torn apart.

This was his Knowledge Sea, so even the smallest damage Yang Kai caused here would affect him. Although this level of injury was not too big a deal, it would not be fine if this continued on.

Shaman Chei’s face turned deadly pale when Yang Kai slashed the Soul Splitting sabre everywhere like a madman, cackling wildly, “Do you like this? How about this? What about this!?”

Of course, there was no way Shaman Chei would ‘like’ anything Yang Kai did.

Shaman Chei could feel great pain with every slash of the sabre, which made his Soul Avatar shudder.

He knew that it was pointless to hide anymore, because it would be a disaster to allow this madman to continue destroying his Knowledge Sea, so Shaman Chei finally could not help but shout, “Enough!”

When his words fell, he appeared in front of Yang Kai and slightly raised his hand to block Yang Kai’s attack.

Although the Soul Splitting sabre was extremely strange and possessed the ability to tear apart his Knowledge Sea, this was his world where he dominated everything. If they really had to start a fight here, they most probably would end up causing destruction to both sides.

He was not powerless to strike back.

“Don’t you like to hide? Just carry on hiding then!” Yang Kai pointed the sabre at Shaman Chi mockingly.

“Scram!” Shaman Chei ordered him to leave with a cold face. It was not a good thing for his Knowledge Sea to be invaded by an outsider as it was not only the home of his Soul, but also the hiding place of all his secrets. No one would want their Knowledge Sea to be spied on.

“Beg. You can try to beg me to see if I am willing to leave,” Yang Kai grinned. His smug face triggered Shaman Chei, causing his anger to boil up like a volcano that was going to erupt.

“Get out!” Shaman Chei glared at Yang Kai coldly.

Yang Kai curled his lip, “You’re the one who wanted to collect my Soul, but now you want me to leave? You should really make up your mind!”

Shaman Chei slightly narrowed his eyes, and announced lightly, “It seems that you want this Shaman to kick you out. I hope that you can handle this Shaman’s wrath!”

In this short conversation, he realized that if he wanted to drive out this Shaman Grandmaster, he had to do it himself. After all, it was not easy for Yang Kai to gain an upper hand, so how could he let go of this opportunity? Shaman Chei spared no more effort trying to talk with him and decided to expel him even if he would hurt himself in the process. Yang Kai’s presence here was a threat to Shaman Chei’s life, so some sacrifices were acceptable.

After speaking, Shaman Chei collapsed and integrated into the Knowledge Sea.

Yang Kai’s face turned solemn as he understood that Shaman Chei was planning to fight him to the death.

For a split second, the space solidified, and a huge repulsive force came crashing towards Yang Kai. It reflected Shaman Chei’s power as the master of this Knowledge Sea.

If one was capable of invading the Knowledge Sea of another, they could cause great damage to the opponent; however, entering another person’s Knowledge Sea would mean fighting against an opponent who controlled the whole battlefield. Therefore, it was not common for this kind of thing to happen. Only someone with an overwhelming advantage in strength would dare invade the Knowledge Sea of another.

But then again, if there was such a huge gap in strength, there would naturally be no need to use this method to kill the enemy.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai sensed the pressure around him increase, and felt that he was going to be squeezed out of the world.

He forced himself to stand firm, but was barely holding on despite his best efforts.

Seeing that he was about to be expelled by Shaman Chei, Yang Kai suddenly took action. With a flash in his eyes, the Soul Splitting Sabre buzzed and burst into a beam of light, “I will deliver you a gift. I hope that you will like it!” He shouted as he slashed down.

“How is this possible!?” Shaman Chei’s voice was mixed with both surprise and anger as the power of this slash was almost double of what he had experienced before.

Being caught off guard, Shaman Chei failed to protect himself against it and his defences were instantly torn apart. His Soul was slashed, and he felt unbearable pain from the attack.

Yang Kai saw the whole world shake as he was expelled out of Shaman Chi’s Knowledge Sea. The next moment, a pitch-black light shrouded him, and when he managed to dispel the cloud of darkness, there was not a trace of Shaman Chei.

He had escaped. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Smart move!” Yang Kai snorted coldly and did not chase after him recklessly. Thanks to his Soul Technique, Heaven Severing Slash, he was finally able to repel Shaman Chei.

Shaman Chei obviously noticed the situation was growing dire so he used a distraction and took the opportunity to escape.

If he stayed, it would definitely not end well for him.

Yang Kai sighed, located his body, and immediately returned to it, not daring to leave his Soul Avatar exposed.

When he opened his physical eyes and looked up, he saw that he was being held in Tiea’s arms. It seemed that Tiea had noticed that his Soul had left his body, and had come to guard him.

“How are you?” Tiea asked with concern.

Yang Kai shook his head and tried to stand up; however, he felt dizzy and fell back into her arms. Wryly smiling, he muttered, “I’m not dead yet.”

Tiea looked at Yang Kai with a look of strange disbelief. It was a miracle for a Low-Rank Shaman Grandmaster to badly wound a Shaman King, and although he also paid a price for it, the consequences were obviously not too serious.

After not seeing him for one month, he had become a Shaman Grandmaster.

[Just how does he cultivate?]

Tiea’s heart was full of questions.

“Where are the villagers?” Yang Kai laid down and asked after recovering some strength.

“They’re safe,” Tiea replied. She had taken the villagers out of the Blue South Village through the underground tunnel earlier, and after everything was settled, she came back to check on Yang Kai’s situation, just so happening to witness Yang Kai’s Soul leaving his body and immediately moving to protect his body.

“Call them back. It should be fine now.” Yang Kai let out a breath.

A Shaman King of the Bone Devouring Clan came, but was forced to retreat in the end. The Bone Devouring Clan would certainly not make any moves for a time now unless a more powerful Shaman King or the Shaman Saint was willing to take action.

However, a Shaman Saint would not even care about such trivial things and it would not really help much if other Shaman Kings of the Bone Devouring Clan came. After using his trump card, Shaman Chei, whose strength was comparable to a High-Rank Shaman King, was incapable of taking down Yang Kai, so what could other Shaman Kings do when they came?

Moreover, as long as Yang Kai was given time, he would grow stronger. If he met those Shaman Kings next time, he would definitely be able to handle them more easily than before.

While speaking to Tiea, Yang Kai suddenly frowned and looked in a certain direction.

Tiea obviously noticed something too and also looked towards the direction Yang Kai was staring, immediately remarking with a wary face, “Someone else is approaching!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened and secretly kept a sharp lookout.

Blue South Village was just a small village, so on most days, it was basically isolated from the world with few outsiders visiting. The only reason Shaman Chei could even find this place was because of Shaman Chi.

A man soon appeared after Yang Kai drove Shaman Chei away, so it was hard to guarantee that this newcomer wasn’t an ally of the latter. If he was a Shaman King too, they would be in deep trouble.

Tiea certainly thought of this too and her pretty face turned slightly pale.

But soon, she heard a sigh of relief from Yang Kai.

“What’s wrong?” Tiea turned to him.

“It’s just a Shaman Master. Don’t worry, maybe he is just passing by.”

After listening to Yang Kai, Tiea could not help breathing out a sigh of relief.

The Shaman Master was obviously not just passing by, however, because after a short time, he flew straight towards Yang Kai and Tiea.

A moment later, an honest-looking Ancient Barbarian appeared in front of Yang Kai, hovering in mid-air.

“Was someone fighting here just now?” The Shaman Master looked around and asked from above.

The traces of the previous battle were still there, and although he could not judge how strong the people in the previous battle were, he felt a little shocked by the residual fluctuations here.

It was clearly a high-level battle, which was not something he could involve himself in. Perhaps just the fallout from such a conflict would be enough to extinguish his Soul.

When he thought about it, he hurriedly turned to Yang Kai and Tiea.

Yang Kai revealed a weak expression on his face, the Shaman Strength from his body pulsing slightly which allowed this Ancient Barbarian to see his cultivation clearly.

“A Shaman Grandmaster?” The man was taken aback and immediately flew down from the sky.
