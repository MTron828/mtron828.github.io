The average cultivator who encounters the Spirit Qi Sea can only sigh in disbelief. After all, they cannot waste their precious time stopping here to cultivate with the abundant World Energy of this place.

Yang Kai would not do so either.

But he had the Sealed World Bead!

The World Energy in the Sealed World Bead could not be considered to be thin, but there was still a huge difference when compared to this place. If he could use the Sealed World Bead to absorb all the World Energy here, the cultivation environment inside the Small Sealed World would undoubtedly improve.

Yang Kai got this great idea because last time, in the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, his Sealed World Bead had absorbed a large amount of broken World Principles. If even the World Principles could be absorbed, there was no reason why World Energy could not be absorbed.

And, his attempt was successful.

A huge tornado formed on the surface of the Sealed World Bead and, as it rotated and pulled, all the World Energy around it was devoured into the Emperor Artifact, filling the Small Sealed World.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed.

The success of this experiment meant that he could upgrade the cultivation environment of the Small Sealed World. It could even get as good as those cultivation paradises in the Star Boundary! Of course, that was if he could find more areas with Spirit Qi Sea.

He handed the Sealed World Bead to Liu Yan and asked Liu Yan to hold the Emperor Artifact while looking after Zhang Ruo Xi.

Liu Yan took it without saying a word, then withdrew a short distance away so as not to disturb Zhang Ruo Xi’s cultivation with the noise from the Sealed World Bead.

Only then did Yang Kai tilt his head at Hua Qing Si, signalling her to move closer to talk.

Hua Qing Si said angrily, “Am I your pet? Do you take me for a pet that I will do whatever you want?”

Yang Kai replied, “If you don’t want to, then I can just send you back there.”

“Good! Great! Excellent! You have guts! You truly have guts!!!” Hua Qing Si rage seemed to cause steam to be produced from her ears. Her whole body was ready to pounce, but she knew she had to temporarily put up with this humiliation.

Hua Qing Si obeyed and moved. After confirming that Zhang Ruo Xi would not be disturbed, Yang Kai spoke while checking around, “Have you considered what I told you before?”

“What?” Hua Qing Si carelessly responded to Yang Kai while looking for an opportunity to make a sneak attack.

But what she didn’t know was that Yang Kai was in the First-Order Dao Source Realm, and kept his back towards her on purpose. He was intentionally showing a posture that was full of openings. With how haughty he was acting and how vulnerable he currently was, Hua Qing Si was having a difficult time deciding the benefits and drawbacks of her actions.

She didn’t know what would happen to her if attacked!

But, she also had enough of being locked up in the Small Sealed World, and if she were to be locked up again, she would go crazy.

“Playing dumb?” Yang Kai stopped walking and turned around to look back at her.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Hua Qing Si expressionlessly replied.

Yang Kai grinned and continued, “Let me explain it to you then, I just think it’s a bit inhumane to keep you in there all the time. After all, you and I have no enmity nor grudge ......”

“Were you always this sensible?” Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes lit up. She looked eagerly at Yang Kai and said, “If that’s the case, then ......”

“Stop dreaming first!” Yang Kai coldly snorted, turned around, and continued to walk forward, “You know of my biggest secret, so if there is no means to restrain you, I do not feel at ease to let you run about freely. This time is just an exception. You probably won’t have a next time. If you really do not wish to pass me your Soul Imprint, then be prepared to be locked up inside for the rest of your life.”

Hua Qing Si’s pretty face changed slightly. After a moment of silence, she said, “Would you give your Soul Imprint to someone you don’t know? Who would basically wield your life, and your death, out of your control?”

“Of course not!” Yang Kai shook his head.

“Then why would I do that if you wouldn’t?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Because I’m better than you!” Yang Kai replied straightforwardly.

Hua Qing Si’s mouth twitched and she continued, “A trivial First-Order Dao Source Realm dares to say such things in front of me! Just where do you get that level of confidence from?”

“There is no need for you to try to test my strength. If you really thought you could beat me, you would have done it already. Why would you still bother with words?” Yang Kai gave a cold laugh as he turned around again. With cold, emotionless eyes, he looked at Hua Qing Si and continued, “My patience is limited, you must give me an answer now. I will not give you another chance again in your lifetime!”

Seeing how serious he looked, Hua Qing Si’s heart sank and she realized that she could no longer muddle through in the face of Yang Kai’s ultimatum.

She grit her teeth and opened her lips slightly, as if she wanted to say something. But, in the end, she did not know where to start.

Yang Kai continued, “The reason why I did not force you last time was because I wanted to give you a little bit of time to ponder this. You should have already made a decision long ago. In the end, it is just a simple choice, is it so difficult?”

“Of course I have considered it thoroughly!” Hua Qing Si pursed his lips and replied.

“Oh? Then your answer?” Yang Kai looked at her with great interest.

Hua Qing Si grit her teeth, “If I offer you my Soul Imprint... damn it! Can you stop smiling like that? It makes me feel like I am being cheated and taken for a fool!”

“Just keep talking!” Yang Kai replied in a serious manner, relaxing the expression on his face.

“Will you ask me to do something life-threatening?” Hua Qing Si asked in a sharp tone.

“I have always been generous to my own people. If something is really dangerous, I will do it myself!”

While Yang Kai was answering, Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes kept staring into his, as if to see if there were any traces of lies. But to her surprise, what she saw were a pair of calm and clear eyes.

Hua Qing Si nodded, “I need to have my own privacy, so you must not pry into my secrets, and you must not order me to do anything against my will and conscience!”

“No problems!” Yang Kai agreed readily, causing Hua Qing Si to freeze, seemingly not expecting him to agree so easily.

“Will you treat me well in the future?” Hua Qing Si asked again.

Yang Kai’s entire face turned odd, “Are you going to marry me? Why are you asking such a humiliating question...”

Hua Qing Si became angry out of shame and barked back, “You think too much! Shameless!”

Yang Kai smiled, “Well, my answer would be... it would be like owning a dog...”

Before he finished his sentence, Hua Qing Si sent out a fist towards his face, Yang Kai raised his hand to block, and then continued: “I will be good to you, and I won’t forget that you are still a human!”

Hua Qing Si clenched teeth to the point it produced a gritting sound, and suddenly leapt back a few steps. Her Source Qi suddenly surged as she shouted: “The last question: Since you want me to offer my Soul Imprint, you must have the strength! Although I do not think I can beat you, I must at least try!”

Once she said her piece, she raised her hand, summoning her own ribbon artifact. Ribbons rose, fluttering about and they all stretched out. They started to intertwine and suddenly formed a rainbow bridge. It quickly rushed forward towards Yang Kai, filled with enough power to destroy.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Yang Kai stood still without moving, and said coldly: “After seeing what I can do, you won’t have any more reason to refuse!”

Hua Qing Si did not speak anymore. Her hand shifted, and the rainbow bridge made of coloured ribbons suddenly condensed, and split apart, forming into ropes, and in the blink of an eye, Yang Kai was wrapped into a dumpling, to the point even his mouth and nose could no longer be seen.

“Huh?” Hua Qing Si looked stunned, not expecting Yang Kai to be so easy to deal with.

[If that is the case...]

Before the joy in her heart had finally erupted, she heard Yang Kai coldly snort, “It looks like you’re mentally prepared!”

At this point, Yang Kai’s figure actually became illusory. As though he had not formed and he disappeared from this space. The ribbons that were tightly strung around him had suddenly loosened.

Space Secret Technique, Nihility!

Once this technique was used, Yang Kai would disappear into the Void, allowing him to avoid lethal attacks, in addition, he could also use the Nihility Secret Technique to hide his body and aura, so as to spy.

“How?” Hua Qing Si’s pretty face changed.

“Never seen a Space Attribute Secret Technique before?” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came from the side.

Hua Qing Si’s face changed again, and she turned her head to see Yang Kai hovering above, unharmed, looking at her playfully.

“A Space Attribute Secret Technique!” Hua Qing Si shouted, her beautiful eyes shone with disbelief.

“Moon Blade!” Yang Kai raised his hand and dozens of Void Cracks, as black as space, took the shape of crescent moons and flew towards Hua Qing Si.

Sensing the terrifying power hidden in this mysterious attack, Hua Qing Si did not dare to be slow and shouted: “Fluttering Butterfly Dance!”

She started to turn, and a colourful light suddenly burst forth. Each ray of light quickly formed into a colourful butterfly, facing Yang Kai.

Hong Hong Hong...

The Moon Blade clashed with the countless butterflies, emitting an array of sound. This space quickly started to become unstable.

“Star Chaser Arrow!” Hua Qing Si immediately used another move, Star Soul Palace’s Secret Technique.

After all, she hailed from Star Soul Palace, the Southern Territory’s strongest Sect, and with the powerful cultivation of a Third-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator, Hua Qing Si was not an ordinary woman. She could be considered first-class in terms of combat experience, strength and adaptability.

Once the Secret Technique was launched, starlight started to leak out of Hua Qing Si’s body. The starlight coalesced and turned into a giant arrow. Trembling as it moved forward, it pierced through the void and headed directly towards Yang Kai, trying to pierce him through the skull.

“Paltry tricks!” Yang Kai coldly snorted. With the power of Principle, he grabbed onto the Star Chaser Arrow, and with power, crushed it into dust.

Hua Qing Si’s heart started to beat violently, as if Yang Kai had shattered her heart instead of the Star Chaser Arrow. She could only speak in terror, “How is that possible?”

Yang Kai grinned, “Three thousand paths, thousands of Secret Techniques that make use of the combination between World Energy and World Principles. Your Secret Technique is only making use of World Principles, so as long as I understand the Principles used for it to form, it is easy to unravel.”

Hua Qing Si’s forehead was drenched with cold sweat.

She was already a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, only one step away from the Emperor Realm, and the Star Soul Palace she came from was not a small sect, but she had never heard of such an unbelievable idea as she had just heard.

But it was the absurdity of this statement that had touched and inspired her.

She furrowed her eyebrows and stood still with clenched hands, deep in thought.
