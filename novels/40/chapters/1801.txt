“Where did they go?” Standing in the Starry Sky, Ni Guang, Gui Zu, and Xue Yue looked around.

A quarter of an hour ago, they lost sight of Zi Long and Xu Wei. At that time, they only saw an artifact flash in Zi Long’s direction and they were gone.

“What did they just use? How did their speed suddenly increase so dramatically?” Xue Yue was as anxious as an ant on a hot wok. They could only track Yang Kai by following Zi Long, so now that they had lost all trace of Zi Long, how could they find Yang Kai?

Yang Kai possessing the Immortal Tree would surely bring him endless troubles. She could not rest easy with Yang Kai acting alone. If she could join up with him, she could at least be of some help.

“Shattering Void Shuttle!” Ni Guang’s eyes shone brightly, “It turns out that Purple Star really refined the Shattering Void Shuttle. I always thought the rumours were false.”

“Shattering Void Shuttle? Is that something amazing?” Gui Zu asked.

“It is something the Great Emperor personally granted, what do you think?” Ni Guang glanced over at him lightly.

“One of the Great Emperor’s personal treasures?” Gui Zu’s expression changed dramatically as he could not help parroting.

“Well, not exactly,” Ni Guang pondered for a moment before explaining. “The refining method was handed down by the Great Emperor, but it was ultimately refined by Purple Star’s Artifact Refiners.”

“Really? Why would you scare me like that!” Gui Zu said with some lingering fear.

If it really was a treasure handed down by the Great Emperor, then no one in the Star Field would be able to match it, but if it was just the refinement method, then it would not be too frightening.

“Even so, the Shattering Void Shuttle is still the fastest artifact in the entire Star Field. Now that we have lost their trail, how are we supposed to follow them?” Ni Guang frowned. The Star Field was too big and only the Heavens knew where Yang Kai and Zi Long would run.

As long as they changed course slightly, it would soon be impossible to find them.

“Heh heh, fortunately, this old master took precautions beforehand,” Gui Zu grinned and said in a low voice.

“Oh? You have a way?” Ni Guang looked at Gui Zu with some pleasant surprise in his originally disappointed eyes.

“En, wait a moment,” Gui Zu said before waving his hand and summoning his Ten Thousand Soul Banner before forming a series of mysterious seals. A moment later, while staring at his Ten Thousand Soul Banner sternly, Gui Zu shouted, “Go!”

The Ten Thousand Soul Banner shook slightly before transforming into a mass of black Qi that shot off in a certain direction.

“Follow this old master!” Gui Zu waved his hand and left in the direction the Ten Thousand Soul Banner flew.

Ni Guang followed together with Xue Yue.

Shortly after they left, in the seemingly empty Star Field, a vague figure appeared stealthily. The aura and vitality fluctuations coming from this translucent individual were suppressed to the limit, and if one weren’t close by, they wouldn’t notice its existence at all.

It was none other than Elder Kong Fa of Galaxy Ridge!

He came to a stop almost exactly where Gui Zu’s group had been and stared in the direction they departed, a feeling of hesitation filling his heart.

Should he follow them, or not?

Following them, with his First-Order Origin King cultivation, would likely lead him into crisis.

But if he did not follow, knowing the Immortal Tree was right in front of him, he wouldn’t be able to live with himself.

After only a moment’s contemplation, Kong Fa grit his teeth and pursued Gui Zu.

Facing the temptation of the Immortal Tree. Kong Fa simply could not resist! He could only hope that his luck was good enough to fish in troubled waters while the masters fought amongst themselves.

Just as the Martial Dao was boundless, so too was the Star Field.

The chase continued through the Star Field for the next five months.

Yang Kai was always in the lead, teasing and taunting Zi Long’s group, a calm and relaxed look on his face. His condition had long ago been restored to its peak, so it would be quite easy for him to get rid of Zi Long’s entanglement.

However, he did not choose to do so.

He wanted to give Zi Long a big, pleasant surprise, so he flew forward unhurriedly, even taking the initiative to slow down when he noticed the Shattering Void Shuttle behind him reduce its speed; allowing them to always catch up.

Behind him, Zi Long and his son wore indescribably gloomy expressions inside the Shattering Void Shuttle.

For five months, they had been unable to catch up to Yang Kai. Zi Long could not understand how a mere Origin Realm cultivator could sustain such incredible speed, or have such terrifying perseverance and seemingly inexhaustible strength.

He had noticed it a long time ago that Yang Kai was stringing them along, baiting them like stupid fish.

But even if he felt indignant, Zi Long could not give up.

Things had reached this point, so giving up would be equivalent to admitting failure and defeat. How could Zi Long accept that?

And so, he grit his teeth and continued to chase after Yang Kai.

Xu Wei had already become skin and bones again despite the Sovereign Blood Pill, his condition even more serious than last time. His eyes had become extremely cloudy, and though he sat upright, his thin body still planted above the Spirit Array, it was clear he was faltering and might pass away at any moment.

Zi Dong would yell at him from time to time, but Xu Wei no longer had the energy to care.

If it had been an ordinary cultivator in such a situation, they would have died a long time ago. It was only because Xu Wei was an Origin King Realm master that he was barely able to maintain his last breath.

But after everything that had transpired, Xu Wei would certainly degenerate into a waste, and likely wouldn’t live very long.

Further behind, Gui Zu, who was using his own Secret Technique, together with Ni Guang and Xue Yue, continued to follow after Yang Kai.

Kong Fa brought up the rear, with no one seemingly aware of his existence.

“It’s been too long. Old Ghost, are you sure Yang Kai is still alive? He really hasn’t been caught by Zi Long?” Ni Guang asked as he chased behind Gui Zu.

“En, Yang Boy is still safe and worry-free. This old master left his Ten Thousand Soul Banner’s Vice-Yin Soul on his body in the Severed World that day. If Yang Boy had died, that Yin Soul would certainly be extinguished as well. This old master is relying on the subtle connection between the Ten Thousand Soul Banner and that Vice-Soul to determine its position, about this, this old master is certain.”

“En, if you say so,” Ni Guang glanced over at Xue Yue while he spoke, but upon seeing her leak a sigh of relief, he could not help heaving a sigh of frustration.

If this whole situation did not involve the Immortal Tree or Xue Yue, he wouldn’t have continued this chase for so long.

He had never experienced such a long pursuit. Even when he was once seriously injured and nearly killed by one of his enemies, he had only fled for a single month before President Ai Ou brought a large number of their brothers to rendezvous with him and slaughter his pursuers.

Even though this happened over a thousand years ago, Ni Guang still remembered those events vividly.

“Hm!?” While Ni Guang was reflecting on the past, Gui Zu’s expression suddenly changed.

“What’s wrong?”

Gui Zu turned his head, looked at Ni Guang in amazement, and slowly said, “My Vice-Soul... vanished.”

“What?” Ni Guang was shocked.

Xue Yue paled after hearing this and almost fainted.

Gui Zu had just said that as long as Yang Kai was alive, his Ten Thousand Soul Banner would be able to track him via its connection to the Vice-Soul on him, but now this Vice-Soul had disappeared, didn’t that mean Yang Kai was...

Xue Yue did not dare to think about it further, her eyes turning red as tears began gathering at their corners.

“Are you sure you’re not mistaken?” Ni Guang shouted.

“Wait!” Gui Zu frowned before looking around with a thoughtful look on his face, “Why does this damned place look so familiar to this old master.”

“So what if it looks familiar? What does that have to do with anything?” Ni Guang urged Gui Zu while glancing towards Xue Yue, clearly hinting at him to say something positive to soothe the situation.

“Ah!” Gui Zu’s eyes suddenly lit up and he laughed, “This old master remembers now! So, we’re here!”

“Fuck!” Despite Ni Guang’s usual mild-manner, at this moment he couldn’t help cursing out loud, thinking this Old Ghost’s brain had been kicked and he couldn’t tell good from bad.

Gui Zu did not care about him at all though and just grinned meaningfully, speaking directly to Xue Yue in the next moment, “Girl, don’t worry. Yang Boy is still alive.”

“But... but you just said...” Xue Yue looked at him sorrowfully.

“I didn’t say Yang Boy died just now, I only said my Vice-Soul had disappeared,” Gui Zu chuckled. “This old master was a bit anxious just now, so he wasn’t clear enough. En, let me explain it this way, my Vice-Soul is indeed gone, but it wasn’t destroyed. Rather.... it is as if this old master was inside that Severed World and unable to sense that Vice-Soul outside in the Star Field. Do you understand now?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“What the hell are you trying to say?” Ni Guang glared at him.

“Haha, just know that Yang Boy is not dead, and this old master also knows where he is,” Gui Zu laughed, stretched out his hand, recovered his Ten Thousand Soul Banner, then immediately beckoned, “Let us go see Zi Long’s depressed face. Hah, that old dog is probably so mad he wants to cough up blood.”

“How do you know?” Ni Guang did not believe him at all, feeling like this Old Ghost was simply too unreliable. He could not tell if Yang Kai’s Sect having such a character as Supreme Elder was a blessing or a curse.

“Heh heh, just wait and see.”

The trio sped off a moment later.

After an hour, Ni Guang suddenly narrowed his eyes as he stared at a group of figures standing not far away.

The one in the middle was naturally Zi Long.

Perceiving the auras of Ni Guang and Gui Zu, Zi Long turned his head and glared at them coldly.

Meeting eyes, Ni Guang laughed heartily, “Haha, this bastard has depression all over his face.”

“I told you he would,” Gui Zu grinned confidently.

“How did you know?” Ni Guang was really curious now.

“He failed, so he’d naturally be depressed. After five months of chasing Yang Boy, only to suddenly lose all trace of him, how do you think his mood is?” Gui Zu explained lightly.

Ni Guang frowned and began to ponder, a moment later spitting out an exasperated sigh, “Vexed, too vexed, especially considering that Yang Kai is just an Origin Realm Junior. Hah, if I was Zi Long, I’d be so embarrassed I’d kill myself and just be done with it.”

Saying so, he let out another burst of laughter, clearly taking pleasure in Zi Long’s misfortune.

“But wait, how did you know that Yang Kai escaped?” Ni Guang suddenly realized something and asked Gui Zu.

“Because this place... I’ve been here before. En, I stayed here for two thousand years, so I know why Yang Boy escaped here and where he is now!”
