“En, I had not thought about such a possibility, I was negligent,” Lan Xun heard this and was startled for a moment, but soon she smiled again and said, “It’s simple then, if that happens, the one with the higher medicinal age will be used!”

“Good idea!” Zhuang Bu Fan nodded, “The higher the medicinal age, the stronger the medicinal efficacies and the higher the chance for a successful refinement.”

“If everyone is alright with this suggestion, then...” Lan Xun smiled and looked around, waiting for a reply.

“I don’t have any objections. Since it’s a matter of luck, everyone has an equal chance!” Finally, someone expressed their opinion, and to everyone’s surprise, it was actually Wu Chang. He seemed to be quite interested in this proposal.

“Good, I like this proposal and don’t have any objections!” Xia Sheng shrugged.

“I agree with the Princess’s suggestion,” Zhuang Bu Fan also said.

With these three taking a stand, no one else would dare raise any objections. What’s more, Lan Xun was the one who made this proposal in the first place, so at this time, refusing to cooperate would be equivalent to slapping Lan Xun’s face... Her Highness was gentle and understanding, but Xiao Chen standing beside her was not so friendly.

Suddenly, everyone’s opinion was unified, and all of them clamoured on about how Lan Xun’s proposal was perfect.

“Many thanks!” Lan Xun saw that a consensus had been reached and turned a smile to Yang Kai, “Brother Yang, please tell us what the last herb you need is.”

As soon as these words came out, everyone fell silent and looked towards Yang Kai, many people showing expression of expectation and nervousness; after all, this was all a matter of luck. Once Yang Kai reported the herb he required, as long as everything went right, there was a chance they could obtain an Extraordinary Treasure Pill.

This was a Spirit Pill that basically guaranteed one could reach the Emperor Realm, who wouldn’t be anxious?

Many people even felt their heartbeats pound in their chests.

In front of everyone’s eyes, Yang Kai slowly and clearly announced, “I need a Jade Blood Mushroom that has a medicinal age of at least five thousand years!”

“A Jade Blood Mushroom... a rare herb,” Lan Xun heard this and smiled as she looked around, “Does anyone have what Brother Yang needs? If you can provide it, it will be equivalent to obtaining an Extraordinary Treasure Pill, a rare opportunity one cannot hope to come across!”

From her words, it seemed like she had great confidence in Yang Kai, as if all one needed to do was present the required herb and Yang Kai would surely be able to refine the Extraordinary Treasure Pill successfully.

It was unknown where her confidence came from.

As soon as her voice fell, many people immediately showed disappointed looks. Obviously, most knew they did not have anything like a Jade Blood Mushroom; however, a few cultivators quickly immersed their minds in their Space Rings...

“Hahahaha...” Suddenly, a loud laugh rang out.

Everyone turned to look and saw a man with a Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation excitedly laughing. Noticing everyone now staring at him though, this man quickly composed himself and simply smiled widely, still unable to hide his joy but at least not coming off as obnoxious.

“Does this friend possess what was requested?” Lan Xun looked at the man with a smile.

The man quickly jumped out from where he stood and forcefully suppressing the joy and excitement in his heart, he replied with a serious face, “Many thanks to her Highness, this one truly possesses a Jade Blood Mushroom!”

“Oh?” Lan Xun raised her brow and said happily, “Please take it out so we may have a look.”

The man hesitated at this moment, but Lan Xun quickly realized what he was worried about and immediately said, “You may rest assured, the words I spoke just now will not be taken back. If you really have the herb Brother Yang needs, one of the Extraordinary Treasure Pills will be yours!”

“Many thanks, Princess!” The man was waiting for this guarantee from Lan Xun, so after hearing what he needed to, he didn’t hesitate any more and immediately took out a large green and red mushroom from his Space Ring.

“It’s a Jade Blood Mushroom!” Yang Kai glanced over and knowing that the other party hadn’t produced a fake, he quickly said, “Please let me see it.”

The man held the Jade Blood Mushroom in both hands and couldn’t help trembling slightly. What he was holding was not just a simple spirit medicine, but rather his own good future, so he was extremely nervous about even slightly damaging it.

When he came to Yang Kai, he carefully handed over the Jade Blood Mushroom before standing back with an anxious look on his face.

“What dog shit luck!”

“Why couldn’t this opportunity have fallen into my hands?”

“The Heavens must be jealous! I am not convinced!”

...

Numerous voices filled with jealousy, anger, envy, and so on echoed about.

As for the man who had produced the Jade Blood Mushroom, these voices only sounded like sweet music to his ears and he could not stop a smug expression from filling his face.

“This is indeed a Jade Blood Mushroom...” Suddenly, Yang Kai frowned and said, “But its medicinal age is too low, only about three thousand years, far from sufficient.”

“What?” The man heard this and his complexion changed drastically, his eyes widening as he stared at Yang Kai incoherently before haltingly stuttering, “You... what did you... no... please take a clear look...”

“There’s no need to doubt,” Yang Kai gave the Jade Blood Mushroom back to the other party as he spoke confidently, “Every thousand years, the colour of the Jade Blood Mushroom will change slightly, becoming deeper and more pronounced. This friend, although your Jade Blood Mushroom can still be considered mature, and can be used to refine most Spirit Pills, it cannot be used in the Extraordinary Treasure Pill. I’m sorry to disappoint you.”

“Impossible!” The man cried out in grief.

The greater one’s hopes were, the more disappointed they were when they fell through. This man had thought that an Extraordinary Treasure Pill was within his grasp, but the plans of Heavens are beyond what men can control. How could this man stand seeing this opportunity just slip through his fingers?

“Take another look!” He stared at Yang Kai reluctantly.

Yang Kai simply shook his head, “If you can’t believe me, you might as well ask someone else for confirmation. I believe there should be others here who can distinguish this herb’s medicinal age.”

As he said so, Zhuang Bu Fan stepped forward, “This friend, this one is Orthodoxy Temple’s Zhuang Bu Fan, and although his knowledge of pharmacology is not on par with Brother Yang’s, he still has some experience in this field. If you trust this Zhuang, you might as well let him perform an examination.”

“Of course I trust you!” The man heard this and immediately rushed over to Zhuang Bu Fan and handed over his Jade Blood Mushroom.

Compared with Yang Kai, an unknown person, Zhuang Bu Fan’s name resounded like thunder across the Southern Territory, so his words carried great authority. As such, this man did not hesitate to place his hopes on Zhuang Bu Fan, hoping Zhuang Bu Fan would be able to overturn Yang Kai’s previous assessment. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

As this man stood back, Zhuang Bu Fan began examining the Jade Blood Mushroom carefully. Not only did he perform a visual inspection, but he also sniffed it deeply and even took a fine scrape of it and tasted it.

His movements were methodical and extremely skilful, making it apparent he had performed such actions many times before.

After a while, Zhuang Bu Fan slowly shook his head and while returning the Jade Blood Mushroom to the other party, he said, “Brother Yang’s knowledge of herbs is indeed much deeper than this Zhuang, needing only a single look to tell its medicinal age, this Zhuang is most impressed... Friend, your Jade Blood Mushroom is really only three thousand years old.”

“How can... that be?” The man muttered to himself with a despondent look on his face.

He could somewhat dismiss Yang Kai saying his Jade Blood Mushroom only had a medicinal age of three thousand years, but if Zhuang Bu Fan was the one saying this, he had no choice but to accept.

The cultivators who had previously been feeling extreme envy towards this man now couldn’t help taking pleasure in his misfortune...

“There are so many people gathered here, is there no other friend who possesses a Jade Blood Mushroom?” Yang Kai turned his head to look around while shouting loudly.

No one responded!

Yang Kai sighed.

“Brother Yang, if you use this three-thousand-year-old Jade Blood Mushroom to refine...” Lan Xun frowned at him.

“That is not possible!” Yang Kai replied, “Princess, you must know that when refining extremely precious Spirit Pills, the demand on the adjuvant herbs is incredibly strict. Not to mention a difference of two thousand years, even if this Jade Blood Mushroom was only a hundred years too young it would not be usable.”

“Haa...” Lan Xun sighed slightly. It wasn’t that she didn’t know what Yang Kai was saying was true, it was just that she was hoping it wasn’t.

“That’s fate!” Xia Sheng suddenly shook his head and said, “The Jade Blood Mushroom is not a common spirit medicine, so it was already quite impressive that someone here possessed one. Since no one else has one, then it seems we can only fight it out for this lotus when the time comes!”

“Actually...” Lan Xun wore a slightly apologetic and helpless look, “I too have a Jade Blood Mushroom, and it should meet Brother Yang’s requirements.”

“Huh?” Xiao Chen was startled when he heard these words and said, “Why didn’t you take it out just now then, Your Highness?”

Yang Kai also looked towards Lan Xun in amazement, but quickly a thoughtful expression flashed across his face and he smiled before cupping his fists, “This Yang deeply admires the Princess’s magnanimity!”

At that moment, he understood why Lan Xun hadn’t taken out her own Jade Blood Mushroom until now.

It wasn’t that she was reluctant to share it...

She was the daughter of Bright Moon Great Emperor, so no matter how precious a spirit medicine was, could she really not bear to part with it? Her not stepping forward was all because she wanted to give this opportunity to someone else and had repeatedly asked if there was no other way just now.

In the end, though, she was forced to come forward.

She was also probably a bit embarrassed about the proposal she had made since she had the herb Yang Kai happened to need.

No one present was a fool, so after listening to Yang Kai’s words and a little thought, they realized what had happened and for a moment, all of them couldn’t help casting awe-filled and admiring gazes at Lan Xun.

Lan Xun’s cheeks went slightly red, making her look even more stunning.

“En, I can contribute the Jade Blood Mushroom, but as for the Extraordinary Treasure Pill... I don’t want it,” Lan Xun pursed his red lips and said.

“How can we accept that!?” Xiao Chen was the first to jump out and object.

“Silence!” Lan Xun frowned and snapped at him, “I have the right to deal with my own possessions!”

Xiao Chen opened his mouth but didn’t dare to speak anymore, feeling quite suffocated as his face turned blue from mixed emotions.

“Your Highness’s words are inappropriate here,” Xia Sheng smiled slightly and said, “Since everyone here reached an agreement before, Your Highness is more than entitled to this prize. If you were to reject this proposal now, it would be equivalent to everyone here owing Your Highness a heavy favour. Later, no one will know if the precious pill they received should have rightfully belonged to Your Highness. This kind of losing trade, this Xia does not want to participate in it!”
