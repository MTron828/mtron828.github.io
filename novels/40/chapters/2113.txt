After Yang Kai returned to the Zhang family’s home, he pushed upon the door of the guest room then entered it, sighting upon the tearful Zhang Ruo Xi sitting there in a daze.

Upon hearing some noise, she raised her head to take a look and her pretty eyes immediately shone with delight. She quickly stood up and said in fluster, “Sir...”

Yang Kai cast a glance at her then said with a smile, “What’s wrong? Did you assume that I have abandoned your Zhang family and left? Are you wiping your tears over it here?”

Zhang Ruo Xi pursed her lips and shook her head slowly.

“Then why are you crying?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Ruo Xi said in a soft voice, “Since Ruo Xi followed Sir, she no longer had anything to do with the Zhang Family... Ruo Xi thought, Sir... didn’t want me anymore,” As she spoke up to here, she summoned her courage and raised her head to look at Yang Kai. “Sir, I know that I’m weak and can’t provide any help to you, rather you would have to take care of me. But, I can still serve you tea, make your bed and other trivial daily affairs and I don’t mind becoming your maid...”

After she finished her speech, she was shocked by her bold words and she quickly lowered her head, while her pretty face got flushed. She bowed and said, “Please forgive me, I won’t disturb your rest.”

After her voice fell, she turned around to leave.

“Stop!” Yang Kai yelled suddenly.

Zhang Ruo Xi’s body shook and she stood there nervously, then said in a shivering voice, “Sir, what instructions do you have for me?”

It looked like she had just thought of something in particular and her nervousness was apparent on her face. She put her little hands against her belly and started tangling them unconsciously, while her face turned as red as a peach and the fragile heart hidden behind her modest chest started beating loudly like a drum.

Yang Kai looked at her and said firmly, “Don’t disparage yourself. I have already accepted the madam’s request and I’ll take you with me. Besides, I really need your help in some matters.”

“How can I help?” Upon hearing this, Zhang Ruo Xi’s eyes lit up and she said eagerly, “Sir, what do you want me to do? Can you tell me?”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “I planned to raise your power a little before telling you, but since you are so eager, then I’ll just tell you now.”

As Yang Kai spoke, he took out the Space Spirit Jade he got from the Lu family’s Lu Bai Chuan.

When the Space Spirit Jade appeared, Zhang Ruo Xi’s body shook and she stared at it, mumbling, “This feeling is...”

At this moment, it looked like the Space Spirit Jade had been stimulated by some unknown power, and it had emitted ripples of Space Force, which sent the surrounding space into a mess, as if it would be engulfed by the void at any moment.

Lu Bai Chuan wasn’t mistaken. Zhang Ruo Xi was the crux to inducing a reaction from the Space Spirit Jade. As long as Zhang Ruo Xi was within a certain range of it, it would release a mysterious power, and this power was precisely the reason Lu Bai Chuan had been able to get slight attainments in the Space Force.

Moreover, he still devised ways to eliminate the Zhang family’s remaining power and force it to marry Zhang Ruo Xi into the Lu family. If his ploy prevailed, he would get a lot of opportunities to study the Space Spirit Jade and he might be able to use its distinct Space Force to raise his own power further.

Yang Kai waved his hand and used the Space Principle to seal the whole guest room’s space. He had isolated it thoroughly, preventing any fluctuations from spreading outside.

“What did you detect and feel?” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruo Xi and asked.

“I’m not sure.” Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head and said, “But, it’s a familiar feeling. When I was a guest in the Lu family’s residence, I frequently got the same feeling, as if something within it was summoning me. It’s the same feeling as before, yet it never has been so intense.”

Yang Kai nodded. It could be seen that the connection between Zhang Ruo Xi and the Space Spirit Jade ran both ways.

“Can you recognize it?” Yang Kai asked.

Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head slowly.

“I got it from Lu Bai Chuan,” Yang Kai said.

“It belongs to Uncle Lu?” Zhang Ruo Xi was quite surprised.

Lu Bai Chuan had been the Zhang family’s enemy, yet Zhang Ruo Xi still didn’t dare to call him by his name casually and it could be seen that the girl’s mindset was still pure and kind-hearted.

“But, I heard from Lu Bai Chuan that it once belonged to your Zhang family,” Yang Kai spoke again. “And it seems to have been owned by a female ancestor of the Zhang family. At that time, she had married into the Lu family, and this object had been her dowry. She had brought it with her into the Lu family.”

“Since it’s a dowry, then it does belong to the Lu family now,” Zhang Ruo Xi said with a smile.

Yang Kai said, “It doesn’t matter who’s its rightful owner, the crux is that it’s from your Zhang family. Did any outstanding person emerge amongst your Zhang family’s ancestors?”

Zhang Ruo Xi shook her head and said, “I don’t know, but I heard from my grandma that our Zhang family was one of the top families in the past, but we had gradually declined due to some unknown reasons.”

“Then, everything makes sense,” Yang Kai nodded.

“But... Why does this object have such a strange connection with me? What about the other members of the Zhang family?” A confused look was apparent on Zhang Ruo Xi’s face.

“The others didn’t cause the same response and the reason why it’s you is...” Yang Kai paused for a while then said, “There are two possibilities. You either have some Bloodline Power, a Bloodline Power stronger than your other relatives and that’s why the Space Spirit Jade showed some response to you. As for the Bloodline Power, it must have originated from the previous owner of the Space Spirit Jade, one of your Zhang family’s ancestors.”

“Then, what’s the other possibility?”

“You have some kind of Special Constitution,” Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruo Xi then shook his head slowly. “I don’t think that is possible. I have observed you for many days and you don’t possess any Special Constitution.”

“Then it’s likely the first possibility, isn’t it?” Zhang Ruo Xi said.

“That’s right,” Yang Kai revealed a faint smile. “I’m not clear about the nature of Bloodline Power, but your bloodline is probably quite similar to that said ancestor, and that’s why you can interact with the Space Spirit Jade.”

“Huh?”

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t show any strong reaction.

“Aren’t you happy?” Yang Kai looked at her with great interest.

Zhang Ruo Xi furrowed her brows and said, “Sir, why are you asking this?”

Yang Kai said with a smile, “It looks like you don’t know anything, then let me explain it to you. Your Bloodline Power is similar to that said ancestor and you have gotten some sort of recognition from the Space Spirit Jade. So, your future achievements may be on par with that ancestor.” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly turned low and he said, “The Space Spirit Jade is no ordinary object, and if you can become its master, then you’ll be at least an Emperor Realm Master.”

Upon hearing this, it looked like it finally dawned on Zhang Ruo Xi and a stunned look showed up on her face. She said, “Sir, are you implying that I have a good chance to become an Emperor Realm Master in the future?”

Yang Kai nodded in response.

“That’s awesome!” An excited and delighted look appeared on Zhang Ruo Xi’s face, “If I can get such great power, then I’ll be able to help you.”

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai was taken aback. After she learned that she could become an Emperor Realm Master, her first thought was that she would be able to help him. The girl’s concern really warmed up his heart.

“Sir, can I have a look at it?” Zhang Ruo Xi looked eagerly at Yang Kai and asked, then cast a glance at the Space Spirit Jade in his hand.

She was quite concerned about it because it was closely related to her future prospects.

“That’s what I planned to do,” Yang Kai said with a smile and handed over the Space Spirit Jade to her.

He had already studied the Space Spirit Jade several times since he had gotten it, yet couldn’t make any discoveries and he only knew that someone had refined it with a great Divine Ability, and it should be some sort of Artifact, but he didn’t know how to use it.

He was quite proficient in Space Force and had already grasped the Space Principle, yet he still couldn’t fathom the mysteries of the Space Spirit Jade. If anyone could understand the Space Spirit Jade’s mystery, then it would be none other than Zhang Ruo Xi.

After Zhang Ruo Xi took the Space Spirit Jade excitedly, a matter beyond their expectations occurred.

When Zhang Ruo Xi touched the spirit jade, it suddenly shook and emitted intense energy ripples.

As for Zhang Ruo Xi’s body, it had also been shaken up, as if she had been electrocuted.

*Sizzle!*

A peculiar sound reverberated and dazzling flowing light appeared on the surface of the Space Spirit Jade.

Soon after, many bizarre projections emerged out of the Space Spirit Jade and filled the whole room. Those projections surrounded Zhang Ruo Xi and the Space Spirit Jade, and were circling around them ceaselessly.

Yang Kai’s expression turned stern and he couldn’t help but furrow his brows as he observed them. They were flickering rapidly, but he still got a clear look at many of them with his great eyesight power.

Towering pavilions, a mountain hidden in fog, a mass of rubble, towering peaks, flying spirit cranes, and various birds, as well as a mountain spring with clear water...

Those scenes were the stuff of an earthen paradise, and those were all dazzling and attractive sights.

Yang Kai had been stunned!

At this moment, Zhang Ruo Xi let out a soft groan and her aura started weakening, while a pained look appeared on her face. Meanwhile, mysterious Space Force ripples started pervading the room.

Yang Kai sighed upon a pitch-black Void Corridor, which had appeared suddenly in the middle of the room. It was still quite unstable, but it was slowly taking shape.

The Void Corridor’s interior was pure chaos and he couldn’t discern what location it was connected to.

“Throw it away!” Yang Kai let out a shout and used his Source Qi and the Spatial Principle to suppress the Void Corridor taking shape here. Soon after, he exerted his power to jump toward Zhang Ruo Xi and take the Space Spirit Jade off her.

The scenes that filled up the room suddenly disappeared, while the Void Corridor in the middle of the room collapsed.

Zhang Ruo Xi let out a soft groan and fell weakly on the ground. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yang Kai’s face fell. He didn’t expect that such an accident would occur, simply because Zhang Ruo Xi held the Space Spirit Jade in her hands. If he had known this earlier, he wouldn’t have taken such a risk.

Yang Kai put away the Space Spirit Jade then stooped to pick up Zhang Ruo Xi only to find her drenched. She got drenched in sweat in that short moment.

Yang Kai placed her on the bed then held her wrist and circulated his Source Qi within her body. At this moment, his expression had already turned gloomy.

He had discovered that a lot of Zhang Ruo Xi’s vitality had been forcefully extracted and she suffered serious damage. She was a girl in her teens, yet her body’s internal state wasn’t any different than a person who lived for dozens of years.

These fundamental injuries couldn’t be treated by ordinary pills, and if he didn’t pay heed to her and abandoned her, then the state of her body would quickly deteriorate.
