The little girl named Ling’er tilted her head as her eyes flashed while she curiously looked at Yang Kai.

However, it was evident that she no longer remembered Yang Kai. Even though she had met him more than ten years ago on Clear Jade Mountain, Ling’er had just awakened her sentience then, so there were many things that she couldn’t remember clearly. She could only sense that this person in front of her seemed faintly familiar.

Yang Kai smiled harmlessly at her.

Luan Feng’s heart suddenly skipped a beat, afraid that Yang Kai would become enamoured with her daughter and try to steal Ling’er away, so she hurriedly gestured at a nearby maidservant, “Take her away. Let’s not bother Sir Yang.”

The maidservant hurriedly answered, “Yes!”

She then immediately took Ling’er by the hand, excused herself, and slowly left.

Luan Feng heaved a slight sigh of relief as she watched Ling’er vanish from her sight. She secretly resolved to absolutely not let Ling’er meet Yang Kai again while he was staying in her palace for this period of time.

A Divine Spirit’s descendant would be tremendously attractive to any Human. No matter if the descendant was any help or not when brought outside, just the status of being a Divine Spirit’s descendant would awe many people. If Yang Kai really stole Ling’er away, Luan Feng wouldn’t even know who to cry to. Not only that, Ling’er really loved to play and was difficult to keep an eye on.

“Sir Yang, please come this way!” Luan Feng gestured with her hand.

Yang Kai nodded as he and the Third Disciple followed Luan Feng into the Phoenix Nest Palace.

The palace had been constructed on a grand scale, and its interior was decorated with amazing beauty. It could be seen that Luan Feng really knew how to enjoy herself in this manner.

There was an inner pavilion with a flying dragon and phoenix sculpture that only emphasized the grandeur of this abode.

Luan Feng finally spoke up after she led Yang Kai all the way to a courtyard deep inside, “Sir Yang, does this place suit your tastes? If you’re not satisfied, we can change it to a different location.”

Yang Kai glanced around and found nothing to be dissatisfied with, so he nodded in affirmation, “This is fine!”

Luan Feng heaved a sigh of relief. She glanced back at the other seven maidservants following her and ordered them, “All of you shall stay here to serve Sir Yang during this time. If Sir Yang has any requests, any at all, you must satisfy them, otherwise, this Queen absolutely won’t forgive you.”

The seven Low-Rank Twelfth-Order maidservants hurriedly answered, “Yes!”

They couldn’t help but secretly worry. Their Divine Venerable said to satisfy all of Sir Yang’s requests, but what if he was lustful and wanted them to do this or that… What should they do then? Men were all the same, no matter if they were Human or Monster.

But since the Divine Venerable had already made this declaration, they didn’t dare to disobey.

“Sir Yang, if there’s nothing else, this Queen shall take her leave. Feel free to give them orders if there’s anything that you need,” Luan Feng smiled as she looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded, “Lady Feng, go ahead and do what you need to. En, as for those spirit flowers and so on, please pay attention to those as well, Lady Feng.”

Luan Feng could only bitterly smile to herself as she realized she couldn’t escape from this tribulation; however, outwardly she could only respond, “Sir may rest assured, this Queen shall deal with it right away.”

After that, she then politely took her leave.

Yang Kai stepped forward after she left and began looking around. He pointed at a building to the left and said, “Third Disciple, will it be fine if you live there for the time being?”

The Third Disciple glanced at the building and then answered, “Will Honoured Master also be living here?”

Yang Kai smiled, “I’ll be living there.”

He pointed at a nearby building.

Third Disciple instantly had an expression of ‘this was difficult for her to accept,’ “But this Disciple wants to serve next to Honoured Master…”

“It’s not far away, so it’s fine,” Yang Kai waved his hand. He didn’t wait for the Third Disciple to say anything else as he looked at one of the maids and asked, “What’s your name?”

The maidservant bowed, “Reporting to Sir, this servant is Tian Long!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Please take her over there and bathe her, then find some clean clothes for her to change into.”

The Third Disciple’s current appearance wasn’t really convenient for meeting others right now. Her Ice Heart Valley attire hadn’t been changed for an unknown number of years, her hair was messy, her face was filthy, and there was a strange smell on her body that somewhat resembled a pungent fruit.

But now that things had calmed down for the time being, Yang Kai naturally wanted to have her clean herself first, as otherwise it really would be difficult to keep looking at her.

“Yes!” Tian Long took the Third Disciple’s arm as she spoke and pulled her away.

The Third Disciple seemed to panic, so Yang Kai hurriedly consoled her by saying, “Come see me again after you’re clean!”

Yang Kai’s words were quite effective on Third Disciple now, so his command immediately calmed Third Disciple down.

After the maidservant named Tian Long took Third Disciple away, Yang Kai waved at the other six maidservants, “You can go do whatever you need to do. I don’t need you to serve me.”

The six maidservants all showed their delight when they heard this. Without saying anything, they all bowed and took their leave.

They had been really afraid that Yang Kai would make some obscene request that they wouldn’t be able to resist due to the Divine Venerable’s command from earlier. However, this Human seemed quite easy to get along with, so they now felt a lot more reassured.

After Yang Kai made everyone leave, he walked into the building by himself and went straight up to the second floor.

The second floor was spacious and had everything needed to live in. Yang Kai walked over to a table, sat down, and slightly sighed.

This trip to the Ancient Lands was truly filled with so many twists and turns.

When facing the Four Great Divine Venerables, Yang Kai truly experienced what it was to feel strong in will but weak in strength, a feeling he hadn’t had in a long time. His Space Divine Abilities which he relied on so much were basically worthless in front of the Four Great Divine Venerables. Things likely would have been bad if it wasn’t for Ruo Xi’s bloodline suddenly awakening at the last moment.

Yang Kai was also truly astonished that Ruo Xi was actually Heavens Order’s descendant.

Still, since her bloodline had awakened already and she was now in the Blood Gate, she would definitely be able to inherit her ancestor’s strength as long as she could emerge from the gate. As for Xiao Xiao, who had gone in together with her, he would also transform into the Divine Spirit Tai Yue.

Even his Embodiment had obtained Shi Huo’s Source and was likely to become the next Divine Spirit Shi Huo.

Overall, although this trip was a bit dangerous, Yang Kai had gained an incomparably large harvest. This wasn’t even counting the treasure that he was extorting or the million Monster Cores he obtained in the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb. He also didn’t know how much treasure Shi Huo had left behind, nor did he know how many good things the other three Divine Venerables would give to him.

Without mentioning the current and future benefits though, what Yang Kai truly felt the strongest about right now was his own desire for greater strength!

This time, the danger had only been resolved because Ruo Xi had awakened her bloodline, but what about the next time? How should he deal with things if he met another Divine Spirit or Master on the level of a Great Emperor? It wasn’t like he could always have such good luck, right?

In terms of methods, he had countless techniques and Divine Abilities that wouldn’t be fewer than anyone’s. He had his Dao of Space techniques, the Time Flies Seal, his Golden Divine Dragon Source, and the power of that Ancient Demon. Any of these techniques and means would be astonishing all on their own.

As for artifacts, he possessed the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Just this one artifact alone would be more than enough for anyone to be in awe.

The only thing he lacked was cultivation!

With his First-Order Emperor Realm cultivation, he was neither weak nor strong. It was an awkward realm to be in.

Yang Kai still needed to cultivate; he needed to work even harder at cultivating!

When he thought of this, Yang Kai was no longer in the mood to keep thinking random things, so he waved his hand and brought his Black Jade Furnace before him. He sent his Divine Sense searching through his Space Ring and Small Sealed World to look for suitable resources.

He was now an Emperor Grade Alchemist, so he had plenty of herbs on hand to refine Emperor Grade Spirit Pills.

With the assistance of Emperor Grade Spirit Pills, he would be able to achieve twice the result and half the effort in his cultivation.

That was why he intended to first refine some Spirit Pills, which would also be useful for improving his Alchemy proficiency, in preparation for refining the Flesh Incarnation Fruit in the future.

Yang Kai took out numerous Emperor Grade spirit medicines and Monster Cores and placed them in front of himself. Various pill recipes flashed through his mind before he finally decided upon making several Spirit Pills that would assist in his cultivation based on the current resources he had on hand.

Yang Kai poured his Emperor Qi into the Black Jade Furnace, which caused flames to immediately start burning. This raised the temperature of the room by several degrees.

However, before Yang Kai could put the spirit medicine before him into the Alchemy Furnace, his expression suddenly changed as he raised his head and glanced outside.

The maidservant named Tian Long was running over in a panic with an anxious expression on her face, as if something major had happened.

“Sir Yang!” Tian Long immediately raised her head and shouted when she approached the building.

“What is it?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow as he replied.

“Sir Yang, you should hurry and go take a look! I don’t know what happened to your Disciple, but she suddenly went crazy and won’t cooperate with us bathing her!” Tian Long answered anxiously.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he secretly thought to himself, [This is bad!]

The Third Disciple’s mental state was extremely unstable, and judging from Tian Long’s words, it seemed her consciousness had become chaotic again.

Yang Kai flashed and immediately appeared next to Tian Long as he quickly said, “Lead the way!”

Tian Long was slightly surprised as she didn’t know how Yang Kai had come out, but she didn’t dare to ask as she hurriedly led the way.

Not long after, the two of them arrived at a secluded hall that seemed to be for bathing. There was a large pool in the centre of the hall which was covered with flowers of different colours that emanated a gentle fragrance that spread everywhere in a wondrous manner.

At this moment, the other six maidservants were also in this hall, trying to anxiously search for the Third Disciple.

When they saw Yang Kai arriving, the six maidservants hurried over and kneeled on the floor while trembling.

Yang Kai glanced at them and asked in surprise, “Where is she?”

Tian Long hurriedly answered, “We don’t know…”

Yang Kai frowned, “What happened exactly?”

Tian Long answered, “Everything was fine at first, but when we prepared to wash your Disciple, it seemed as if she suddenly became someone else. We tried to catch her, but she disappeared before any of us could even blink.”

There was something else that Tian Long didn’t dare to directly say, which was that the Third Disciple had previously acted like a completely unreasonable maniac.

Yang Kai slapped himself on the forehead and thought to himself that he had been overconfident.

He waved his hand, “It’s not your fault. All of you can rise.”

“Many thanks, Sir!” The six maidservants who were kneeling all heaved sighs of relief.

Yang Kai looked around and saw that there was only one exit in this hall, while everywhere else was completely sealed off, so he immediately asked, “Did any of you see her leaving this place?”

The six maidservants exchanged glances and all shook their heads, indicating that they hadn’t seen her leave; however, that made things even stranger. They had searched the entire hall already without finding her, so if she hadn’t left, just where could she be? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When Yang Kai heard this, he secretly had an idea as he looked all around and coldly snorted, “Third Disciple, if you still don’t come out, your Master is going to get angry! I’ll give you three breaths of time to obediently come out by yourself. Otherwise, you’ll be punished according to the Sect’s Laws!”
