If it wasn’t for Yang Kai inadvertently leaving a shadow in Shan Qing Luo’s heart, the Demon Queen wouldn’t currently be suffering from this torment, but now that her sentiments towards him had grown to such an extent, Shan Qing Luo had to separate herself from Yang Kai and focus wholeheartedly on suppressing her desires. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The moment she lost control, either Shan Qing Luo would die, or Yang Kai would.

It was for this reason that Bi Luo hated Yang Kai so much.

As the two were arguing, a familiar figure reappeared and stood staring helplessly towards the pair.

“You...” Shan Qing Luo stared at Yang Kai in shock, muttering, “Why did you come back?”

“I know that your current condition isn’t good,” Yang Kai sighed gently; Shan Qing Luo’s abnormal state was incredibly obvious, how could he not have noticed? A moment ago, he had only pretended to disappear so he could listen to this enchantress’ true feelings.

Her steadfast determination and willingness to sacrifice herself for him had touched Yang Kai deeply.

“Since you came back on your own then everything is simple! Mistress, you don’t have to suppress yourself anymore, just take his life.” Bi Luo enthusiastically encouraged as she glared towards Yang Kai.

“You seem to be quite prejudiced against me,” Yang Kai returned a sharp glance to Bi Luo.

“Good!” Bi Luo shouted resolutely, “I can’t wait to peel your skin, drink your blood, and eat your meat! If it weren’t for you, how could my Mistress have fallen into such terrible hardship?”

“Even without me, there would eventually be some other men who would enter her heart; such is the tragic fate of her Poison Widow Body lineage!” Yang Kai replied coldly.

Bi Luo wanted to argue back but didn’t know what to say, choosing instead to bite her lip.

“You have to leave, quickly!” Shan Qing Luo’s breathing accelerated rapidly. As early as six months ago the sentiment within her heart had reached a level where she had difficulty suppressing it. While she was unable to meet Yang Kai this past half a year, her condition had become slightly better, but now that they had reunited and spent three days together, suppressing her impulses was becoming impossible and each time she forcefully did so it would result in a severe backlash, “Go now while there’s still time.”

Yang Kai however slowly shook his head and declared firmly, “The problem between you and me must be resolved; evading the issue won’t solve anything.”

“This is what you said yourself,” Bi Luo smiled brilliantly, twirling her figure and sending out a brilliant flash of light. Suddenly, a faint melody began filling the world as Bi Luo softly whispered, “Mistress, the time has arrived, and you don’t need to suppress yourself anymore.”

All around the three people an intoxicating sense of enchantment emerged and Bi Luo no longer displayed any of her former aggression and anger, instead, an aura similar to Shan Qing Luo’s gently wafted from her body.

Bi Luo also cultivated a profound Seduction Technique.

When she displayed her Seduction Technique, her target surprisingly wasn’t Yang Kai but instead Shan Qing Luo.

“Bi Luo, you...” Shan Qing Luo was already having difficulty resisting the impulses in her heart so when Bi Luo suddenly used her Seduction Technique, it was as if a dam had burst as those desires flooded out, drowning her rational mind.

The overwhelming emotions Shang Qing Luo was now experiencing instantly destroyed her sincere wish to protect Yang Kai, leaving her with only one instinctual thought.

To embrace Yang Kai! If she was currently like an ancient block of ice, then Yang Kai was akin to a burning flame. All Shan Qing Luo wanted to do was approach him and either extinguish his fire or melt herself.

A bewitching moan leaked from her luscious red lips as the Beguiling Demon Queen’s face blushed bright red, her smooth slender neck turning a faint shade of pink. An intoxicated expression covered her face as her eyes quickly blurred as she made no attempt to hide her burning desire to devour Yang Kai.

The surrounding world also underwent a strange mutation and a wondrous scenery filled with countless young girls singing and dancing appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes. Each of these girls were beautiful and seductive, their enchanting figures all only half covered, further emphasizing their bountiful peaks and secret valleys. In an instant, all of them encircled Yang Kai, sinfully calling out to and flirting with him.

Yang Kai’s heart clenched.

Shan Qing Luo’s Seduction Technique had grown even stronger than before. At this moment, she hadn’t even deliberately displayed it, this fantastical illusion he had been drawn into was nothing more than her instinctual response to her current condition.

“Break!” Yang Kai coldly shouted, circulating his Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art causing the world around him filled with flirtatious young girls to shatter and disintegrate into tiny particles of light.

“Hehe...” Bi Luo smiled charmingly, “You bastard, give up, no man can resist my Mistress’ Seduction Technique, emm...”

As she spoke, her two slender legs involuntarily clamped shut as she felt a burst of heat pass through her lower abdomen. As the cold wind blew past her now slightly moist precious treasure, a slight chill ran up her spine further stimulating her body, causing her to nearly lose control of the impulses in her heart.

Clearly she had also been influenced by Shan Qing Luo’s Seduction Technique.

“I’ll tidy you up later!” Yang Kai glanced at her coldly and grumbled in a disgruntled tone.

“Hmph, you’ll have to live through this first!” Bi Luo panted for breath as she clenched her legs and twisted her hips, biting her thin lips as she stared at Yang Kai with hot eyes.

It was as if she wanted to rush over and ‘go all out’ with Yang Kai, but she stubbornly resisted this urge.

A delicate fan shaped artifact appeared in the Beguiling Demon Queen’s hand at this moment, various images of men and women embroidered on its surface. These handsome men and beautiful women were all half naked and were engaged in pleasurable acts, all of them seemed to be drowning in happiness, their lifelike faces filled with happiness and joy.

“Soft Silk Fan.” Yang Kai solemnly muttered.

This artifact was an heirloom that has been passed down from generation to generation in Shan Qing Luo’s family. Coupled together with the unrivaled Seduction Technique of the Beguiling Demon Queen, it was able to display a truly fearsome power.

Shan Qing Luo gracefully waved the fan and the men and women on its surface become more active, all of them soon rushing out of the fan as if they had suddenly come to life before pouring into Yang Kai’s mind.

*Pa pa pa pa...*

These illusions that invaded his subconscious only lasted a short breath of time before disintegrating into powder.

The Yin-Yang Joyous Unification Art easily broke Shan Qing Luo’s Seduction Technique even with the assistance of her Soft Silk Fan, allowing Yang Kai to remain unaffected.

However, Shang Qing Luo in her current intoxicated state didn’t seem to realize so after using her Soft Silk Fan, Shan Qing Luo simply giggled happily and in a burst of fragrant wind rushed in front of Yang Kai, stretching out her jade hands and gently wrapping them around his neck as she licked her supple lips with her small scarlet tongue. As her breathing became somewhat ragged, her perfectly shaped snow white peaks heaved up and down and slowly pressed against Yang Kai’s firm chest, bringing with them an amazing elasticity as she drew him into her embrace, bringing her delicate mouth closer and closer to Yang Kai’s own.

Yang Kai’s body twitched and heat began flooding his lower half; at this moment, he sincerely wished he could let go of all his constraints and fight a hundred rounds with the incredible beauty before him. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

But once the Beguiling Demon Queen’s emotional state reached such a high, her every breath would fill with a potent toxin that no man could withstand.

“You little seductress...” Yang Kai smiled helplessly and lifted his reached his hand behind Shan Qing Luo’s head, sending out a violent burst of True Qi.

Suffering this sharp blow without the making the slightest effort to defend herself, Shan Qing Luo’s eyes quickly lost their light and the amorous music with seemed to pervade the air gradually faded to the wind. Falling into a stupor, her body went limp and sank into Yang Kai’s arms.

Bi Luo, who was waiting nearby to witness this exciting scene, had been thoroughly affected by the surrounding atmosphere and her two small hands were unconsciously kneading her milk-white bosom, her face filled with joy and anticipation, but upon seeing Yang Kai’s actions just now, all colour was drained from her face.

“Get over here!” Yang Kai slung Shan Qing Luo over his shoulder gently before smirking towards Bi Luo.

“What do you want to do?” Bi Luo immediately became vigilant and quickly stepped back, “What happened to my Mistress?”

“I killed her already, now it’s your turn.” Yang Kai sneered, a ruthless glint flashing across his eyes.

Bi Luo’s trembled violently as her eyes filled with tears before suddenly crying out hysterically, “I’ll kill you!”

Like an enraged beast, she recklessly charged towards Yang Kai and swung her fists.

Unfortunately for her, Yang Kai simply extended his hand and easily restrained her.

While carrying Shan Qing Luo on his shoulder, Yang Kai held Bi Luo under his other arm quickly, lifted his free hand and slapped it down on her perfectly rounded bottom.

*Pa...*

Bi Luo went stiff from head to toe, as shame and anger burst from her heart, but at the same time, she felt a jolt of electricity shoot through her body, like Yang Kai’s harsh slap had unleashed some long suppressed desire deep inside her, causing her to feel a kind of devastating pleasure.

*Pa...*

After the second strike, Bi Luo finally called out in alarm as she began struggling and squirming fiercely, shouting wildly as he punched and kicked Yang Kai.

But Bi Luo’s struggles were pointless because in his first strike Yang Kai had sealed her True Qi and was now meeting out her punishment in a rhythmical manner.

Gradually, Bi Luo struggled less and less and her cries of protest began changing into seductive moans. With each proceeding slap, her body filled with heat and became more and more limp, her face blushing and intoxicated pink.

Noticing this, Yang Kai was dumbstruck, “There is something wrong with your taste.”

“What’s it to you, you bastard? Put me down already!” Bi Luo suddenly regained her senses and angrily shouted.

*Pa...*

A squeal of pleasure resounded through the air once more.

One day later, Ash-Grey Cloud Evil Land, Fragrance City.

Inside Shan Qing Luo’s palace, Yang Kai suddenly appeared together with the Beguiling Demon Queen and Bi Luo.

The mature beauty who Yang Kai he met before, Yun Li, along with young girls Ruo Yu and Ruo Qing heard the news and hurriedly rushed over, all of them genuinely happy to see Yang Kai again.

However, upon seeing Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo’s current states, they couldn’t help feeling shocked.

The Beguiling Demon Queen was unconscious, while Bi Luo’s eyes were red and swollen, it seemed like she had been crying for a long time but at the same time her face also had a strange glow about it, as if she had just run through a spring shower that had moisturised her skin giving it a faint radiant lustre.

When Yang Kai put her down, Bi Luo let out a small yelp as her legs went soft and she sank to the floor, her two small hands unconsciously reaching down and rubbing her butt as she gnashed her teeth.

“Bi Luo, what’s wrong with you?” Yun Li hurriedly asked.

“No...nothing...” Bi Luo replied stutteringly, her face blushing a light pink as she snuck a glance towards Yang Kai. Her beautiful eyes now flashed a terrified light and contained none of her previous domineering arrogance.

The slaps she had suffered on the road here had left a deep shadow in her heart.

“What about the Mistress, what happened to her?”

“Mistress, she... had an accident.” Bi Luo’s expression sank once again.

“Let them rest first.” Yang Kai said.

“Good,” Yun Li, Ruo Yu, and Ruo Qing quickly held Shan Qing Luo and Bi Luo and sent them back to their room.

Tranquil Phoenix Pavilion, where Yang Kai had once lived.

Inside the second floor room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression quite gloomy.

Shan Qing Luo’s relationship with him was not very profound; in fact, it was only because of a set of coincidences and accidents that Yang Kai had planted a seed of sentiment in her heart, inextricably linking the two of them together. If Yang Kai wanted to resolve Shan Qing Luo’s current crisis now, he had no idea where to begin so obviously he was feeling somewhat anxious.
