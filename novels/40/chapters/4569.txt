With no way to deal with the strange aura permeating the depths of Black Prison, they would inevitably incur losses when mining the Ore Stars located there.

The amount of resources that Xin Peng brought over on this trip could not be described as large, but the quality was excellent.

Without even mentioning the two Seventh-Order materials, there were a total of 34 Sixth-Order materials alone, with two Sixth-Order Yin and one Yang Element materials!

The latter were exactly the materials that Void Land was most in need of right now!

For the current Void Land, this was not exactly big news, but it was not small news either; however, knowledge about Xin Peng’s visit was limited to only a few people.

“What else?” Yang Kai gathered himself and asked.

“Gathering Yuan Union’s Young Union Master, Lu Jing came to visit a month ago, and has been waiting for Sect Master to exit retreat since his arrival.”

Yang Kai raised his brow, showing a look of surprise. At this juncture, almost over 70% of the Star City’s merchants had left. Even for those who chose to remain, a good many of them were still on the fence. The great forces with cooperative relationships with Void Land were all wishing they could cut off contact lest they draw unwanted fire to themselves.

[Why would Lu Jing rush over here to see me during this time? Is he acting in the Gathering Yuan Union’s name or is he here by himself?]

“Is he alone or with someone else?” Yang Kai asked.

Bian Yu Qing responded, “Apart from a few guards, he is alone.”

Yang Kai nodded, now having an understanding of the situation.

An hour later, inside the reception hall, Yang Kai met Lu Jing. After exchanging pleasantries, they took their seats.

“Brother Lu, what can I help you with on this visit?” Yang Kai looked at him curiously after taking a sip of tea.

Lu Jing responded with some awkwardness, “I have failed to make good on Senior Brother Yang’s favour, and I originally did not have the face to return because of that, but I had to come regardless because I owe Senior Brother a life-saving grace.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded, “Why are you talking about that?”

Lu Jing said, “I have spoken to my Father about Senior Brother’s proposal. Originally, he seemed quite interested, but... things changed!”

He sighed deeply with a helpless expression on his face.

Yang Kai smiled, “That’s how business is. There is no need for it to sour our relationship just because the deal did not go through, so pay it no mind, Brother Lu.”

Last time, when Lu Jing came by, Yang Kai tried using distribution rights for the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill as a bargaining chip in order to negotiate a deal with Gathering Yuan Union. Originally, he figured that since Gathering Yuan Union’s merchant ships were spread across the 3,000 Worlds, it would surely not be difficult for them to gather up some rarer resources. If Gathering Yuan Union could truly help him acquire the Sixth-Order Yin and Yang Element materials that he needed, then Void Land would not be at a disadvantage even if they exchanged some Heavenly Yuan Stabilizing Pills for them.

At that time, Void Land and Zuo Quan Hui had not broken out into a full confrontation yet.

Though less than a year had passed since then, things had changed greatly. Void Land fought a great battle against Zuo Quan Hui and his Disciples, in which Zhou Ti was killed. Zuo Quan Hui subsequently became Heavenly Sword Union’s Union Master then spread word of his feud with Void Land far and wide. Anyone who was slightly well-informed would naturally have found out about what happened.

Gathering Yuan Union was a mercantile-based Sect, so it was only natural for them to be very well-informed, which explained why Lu Jing said that things had changed. Even though his Father was interested in the Heavenly Yuan Seal Stabilizing Pill, he also had to watch out for the stance of Zuo Quan Hui and Thousand Cranes Paradise behind him. So, how could he dare to work with Void Land at such a time?

However, Yang Kai did not care about that anymore. After heading to the Black Prison and bringing so many resources back, Void Land’s immediate needs had already been satisfied, so they did not have to worry about cooperating with Gathering Yuan Union anymore.

Lu Jing looked even more embarrassed now and hung his head low, “Senior Brother Yang’s generosity is admirable.”

Yang Kai waved his hand and laughed, “Brother Lu is exaggerating.” Without the harvest from the Black Territory, he may have been slightly disappointed by how things turned out. However, with the Black Territory as a back-up for resource production, the problem he had, had already been solved.

Lu Jing raised his head and cupped his fist, “Additionally, I have also come with a request.”

Yang Kai sat up straight and gestured for him to continue, “Pray tell, Brother Lu.”

Lu Jing said, “I would like to rent some shops in Void Star City and open a Trade Company.”

Yang Kai’s face became serious, “Is this Brother Lu’s idea, your Father’s, or Gathering Yuan Union’s?”

Moving into Void Star City was not a good choice in these times. There was no need to mention the merchants who stayed since they were originally established in Void Star City to begin with. Whether they left or stayed, Zuo Quan Hui was in no position to question or rebuke them for their choice.

However, to move in at this juncture would likely be interpreted by outsiders as a gesture of goodwill towards Void Land, which was no different than drawing fire upon oneself! There was no way that a business alliance as large as Gathering Yuan Union would not be able to see that.

Lu Jing responded, “This has nothing to do with my Father or Gathering Yuan Union. I am solely responsible for this decision.”

Yang Kai looked deeply at him, clearly not believing him. Despite being the Young Union Master, Lu Jing’s cultivation was still only in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm. If his Father had any objections to this idea, he had thousands of ways to keep Lu Jing from acting. How could he possibly have allowed his son to wade into these muddy waters?

Since Lu Jing was here, then someone must be supporting him from behind. As a whole, Gathering Yuan Union likely would not support him in such a move. In which case, that must mean that as the Union Master of Gathering Yuan Union, his Father had at least given his tacit agreement for Lu Jing to proceed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Doing things this way, however, meant that even if Void Land were to ultimately lose the war, Zuo Quan Hui would have no reason or be in any position to give Gathering Yuan Union any trouble.

It was not appropriate to speak about such matters openly, but it was fine as long as all involved understood the subtleties of the situation. As a result, Lu Jing was not deliberately trying to deceive Yang Kai.

After a short pause, Yang Kai said, “Brother Lu, you should know what the current situation is like in my Void Land. Coming to our Star City at a time like this is not the best choice.”

Lu Jing smiled, “I understand what Senior Brother Yang is trying to say, but for a merchant, danger also signifies opportunity, does it not?” He winked playfully at Yang Kai as he said so.

“Well, as long as you’ve made up your mind.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Lu Jing was no child. As a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, and the Young Union Master of Gathering Yuan Union, he could make his own judgements and decisions. There was no need to coddle him with advice.

Receiving Yang Kai’s agreement, Lu Jing perked up and asked, “Senior Brother Yang, how many shops can you offer me here in Void Star City?”

Yang Kai laughed, “How many does Brother Lu want?”

Lu Jing said generously, “The more the better, naturally. The best would be if you could offer me a whole street or two.”

Now, Yang Kai was even more sure that Gathering Yuan Union’s Union Master was behind this move; otherwise, Lu Jing would not have the guts to make such a big request.

“You really don’t hold back!” Yang Kai laughed. After some thought, he continued, “I will contact the Governor’s Mansion about this matter later, then you can go there and discuss it with Governor Mo yourself. Right now, the Star City has many empty shops to offer, so we will definitely be able to satisfy your requests.”

“Many thanks in that case, Senior Brother Yang.” Overjoyed, Lu Jing stood up at once to bow, “There’s no time to lose, I will head to the Governor’s Mansion at once!”

Clearly, he was also eager and impatient to start his own business. And, Void Star City was a place with the opportunity for him to do so.

“I will send someone to go with you.” Yang Kai contacted Bian Yu Qing and had her arrange for someone to take Lu Jing over to the Star City.

Naturally, Lu Jing thanked him again. While waiting for his escort to arrive, Lu Jing added, “By the way, Senior Brother Yang. About the things you were looking for last time... Gathering Yuan Union is unable to provide you with them for now, but I do know of two places that are rich with Sixth-Order Yin and Yang Element materials.”

Yang Kai asked with great interest, “Oh? Where?”

Lu Jing casually blurted, “The first place is the Black Prison. Yang Kai should have met a woman named Luan Bai Feng before, yes?”

Yang Kai burst out in laughter inwardly, but on the surface, he kept calm and nodded repeatedly, “Yes, more than once.”

“Then that makes things easy. The Black Prison produces something called Black Stone, and these Black Stones can contain cultivation materials of all different Orders and Elements. If Senior Brother Yang could take over the Black Prison, then you will naturally have no need to worry about cultivation materials anymore.” Lu Jing looked at him, “Only... There are many Natural Arrays all over the Black Prison. Even though Luan Bai Feng is only in the Sixth-Order, not even a Seventh-Order Master can best her inside of the Black Prison because of her mastery over the Dao of Spirit Arrays. If Senior Brother Yang is truly interested, then you must be careful of Luan Bai Feng.”

“I know a thing or two about the Black Prison’s situation.” Yang Kai nodded. Inside, he thought to himself, [not only do I know about it, I just came back from the Black Prison recently after carrying out an Ore Star from its depths!]

After a pause, Yang Kai asked, “What about the other place?”

Lu Jing’s expression became a bit serious when he mentioned the Black Prison and Luan Bai Feng. Clearly, he knew the oddities present within the Black Prison as well as Luan Bai Feng’s strength. However, his face turned even more serious when he continued, “Has Senior Brother Yang heard of the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer?”

Yang Kai’s face also turned solemn, “Chaos gives rise to Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang give rise to the Four Symbols, Ancestors of all Divine Spirits, Burning Light and Serene Glimmer?”

According to ancient legends, at the beginning of existence, there was only Chaos, which later gave rise to Yin and Yang, which became the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer, the oldest Divine Spirits in the world.

It was only after the two beasts transformed into the Four Symbols that Divine Spirits like the Dragons and the Phoenixes appeared.

It could be said that the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer were the progenitors of all Divine Spirits. That was to say, they were the shared ancestors of all Divine Spirits!

These two were terrifying existences that were highly likely to be even stronger than the Giant Spirit Gods.

Back then, Yang Kai obtained a Divine Spirit Record which listed the ranking of all the Divine Spirits in the 3,000 Worlds. The book listed the Dragons and the Phoenixes at the top, but the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer’s introductions appeared at the very beginning of the manuscript. Only, the author of the book did not believe that these two beasts still existed in this world, and that was why the Dragon and Phoenix Clans were ranked first.

Yang Kai was surprised when he read this, but he did not think much of it.

The one who really brought up the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer to him later was the Proprietress!

At that time, Yang Kai was looking to advance into the High-Rank Open Heaven Realm directly and was in search of a source of High-Rank Yin and Yang Element materials. That was when the Proprietress brought out her Universe Chart for him to see. Inside of the Universe Chart, there were several Great Territories that were blank, without the markings of any great force. Not even Universe Worlds existed there.

According to the Proprietress, those Great Territories used to be thriving places, but the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer were naturally opposing forces. Since fire and water did not mix, the continuous clash between the two eventually tore those Great Territories apart.

The Great Territories then became areas forbidden for all life, Dead Territories so to speak. Whether it be a Seventh-Order or even Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, none could survive after they entered that place, so nobody had any idea what the situation was inside of these Dead Territories. Even the Proprietress herself had only heard others mention rumours about them, and there was simply no way of confirming whether the Burning Light and Serene Glimmer truly existed.

Naturally, Yang Kai would not dare to provoke existences as terrifying as them. Even Seventh-Order and Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters went silent after entering the Chaotic Dead Territory. He was only a trivial Emperor Realm Master back then, so how could he dare to have any extravagant thoughts about them?

However, he never thought that he would once again hear the Sun’s Burning Light and Moon’s Serene Glimmer’s names, this time from Lu Jing!

It was clear that though Lu Jing’s cultivation was low, he was still well-informed.
