Hearing him say this, Luan Bai Feng grabbed a washbasin-sized Black Stone and tossed it to Yang Kai, “You can try it yourself, but I have no way of verifying it.”

Yang Kai accepted the Black Stone from her and weighed it in his hand, discovering that it was not as light as he expected it to be. After squeezing it with some force, no marks or traces seemed to have been left on the piece of Black Stone.

He was considered to be very strong now, so even if it was not crushed, any piece of raw ore would still crack open if squeezed in his hands. However, this Black Stone was obviously very different in make-up, and was also extremely resilient.

Divine Sense surging, Yang Kai tried to investigate the insides of the Black Stone, but it actually repelled his Divine Sense completely, so it was impossible to find out whether something was hidden inside or not.

Yang Kai was surprised. Currently, he was in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so his Divine Sense was extremely strong, yet it was still rejected by the Black Stone, [Just what... is this thing?]

After contemplating for a moment, Yang Kai activated his Demon Eye of Annihilation, and his left eye immediately turned into a gold vertical slit.

Looking at it now, he could see something different. Inside of the Black Stone he was holding was the fluctuation of a vague and indistinct pale yellow energy.

Seeing this made Yang Kai’s heart stir. The Demon Eye of Annihilation worked!

Even though he had no way of seeing clearly into the Black Stone, he could be sure that something was inside of this piece, and it was likely an Earth Element material. As for what Order it was, he had no way of ascertaining that. He would have to dissolve the Black Stone to find out.

The Demon Eye of Annihilation had the ability to see through all illusions, and alongside the Black Purgatory Eye, they made up Myriad Demons Heaven’s Core Divine Abilities. These were extremely profound Eye Techniques, and even in Myriad Demons Heaven, only the most elite disciples were qualified to cultivate them.

Yang Kai had obtained his Demon Eye of Annihilation when he was still very weak, and he never knew these secrets either before meeting Ti Zheng.

However, since it was one of Myriad Demons Heaven’s two Core Divine Abilities, the Demon Eye of Annihilation naturally had its own profound traits. Even though his Divine Sense was unable to penetrate the Black Stone and assess the situation within, the Demon Eye of Annihilation could break through some of its barriers and penetrate straight into its essence.

However, Yang Kai’s cultivation of the Demon Eye of Annihilation was not very high, so he could only vaguely see what was inside. If it were truly someone from Myriad Demons Heaven who cultivated these Secret Techniques, then they would obviously be able to have a clearer look inside.

His movements did not escape Luan Bai Feng’s eyes, who was looking at him with some surprise, “You cultivate an Eye Secret Technique, too?”

“What’s wrong with that?” Yang Kai withdrew his Demon Eye of Annihilation and turned to look at her.

Luan Bai Feng shook her head, “It’s nothing. Were you able to see anything?”

“No,” Yang Kai responded casually. Even though Luan Bai Feng could tell that he possessed an Eye Secret Technique, she naturally might not be able to recognize it as a Myriad Demons Heaven’s Secret Technique, so Yang Kai would not try and explain it to her.

However, in order to prove whether or not his ability was right, Yang Kai urged his World Force to his palm, enveloping the Black Stone in it.

Rapidly, it shrank in size.

With his Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivation, especially his World Force, which was much richer than an ordinary Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Yang Kai was able to dissolve the Black Stone at a ridiculously fast rate.

The washbasin-sized Black Stone in his palm completely disappeared before a stick of incense could even fully burn out, and a piece of yellow crystal gradually emerged from it.

Luan Bai Feng looked on in surprise at it and muttered, “Fourth-Order Earth Element. You are quite lucky indeed!”

Yang Kai casually played with the earth-coloured crystal in his hand and said, “What is the probability that a piece of Black Stone would contain cultivation materials?”

“Very small,” Luan Bai Feng responded, “If you’re lucky, then it’s about 30% percent; otherwise, it may not even be 1%.”

“30% is too low.” Yang Kai shook his head. Out of 10 pieces of Black Stone, at least 7 would be empty. How much time and energy would that waste?

“That’s why I told you that none of the resources here came easy. Did you think this place was really so full of treasures that you could just bend over and find a piece?” Luan Bai Feng snorted, but then she frowned, “What are you even looking for? You have already taken away the stash that I have been gathering for so many years. Is that still not enough for you?”

Yang Kai shook his head, “It’s not enough. I still need more Sixth-Order Yin and Yang Element materials.”

Luan Bai Feng frowned, “If you are using it for your own cultivation, then you could just refine using Fifth-Order materials. Even though it will be a little slower, Fifth-Order materials are not as hard to find. Why restrict yourself to only the Sixth-Order?”

She obviously thought that Yang Kai was seeking out so many Sixth-Order cultivational materials for his own use.

Yang Kai laughed, “Naturally, I can use Fifth-Order materials for my own cultivation, but what if someone needs to advance into the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm?”

Luan Bai Feng was taken aback for a moment, then her eyes widened, “How is that possible? How could your Void Land have so many people advancing directly into the Sixth-Order?”

It had to be known that any cultivator that could break through directly to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm had hopes of reaching the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm one day, so their numbers are extremely limited. Even in the Cave Heavens and Paradises, such disciples only appeared once every 1,000 years or so. Yang Kai had already plundered plenty of Sixth-Order Yin and Yang Element materials from her, which was enough to meet the advancement needs of 10 whole people, so how could he still be needing more?

Yang Kai did not bother to explain it since it was useless to say anything. Now that Luan Bai Feng had come under his banner, she would naturally understand that he was not just boasting once she saw Void Land’s heritage for herself.

“Don’t just stand there, help them out. Get these Black Stones dissolved and see whether you can find what I’m looking for,” Yang Kai called out to her. Even though there were a dozen Open Heaven Realm Masters currently working to dissolve the Black Stones, they were not very efficient. Dissolving these Black Stones was something that happened faster the higher one’s cultivation was, and it was likely related to the potency of one’s World Force.

Luan Bai Feng looked at him in disbelief, obviously still shocked by what he just said, “There probably won’t be any Sixth-Order materials in these Black Stones. No need to bother.”

“Huh?” Yang Kai turned his head to look at her, “Why do you say that?”

Brushing her hair back behind her ear, Luan Bai Feng answered, “I’ve been in the Black Territory for so many years, so I still have some amount of experience. There are countless Ore Stars in the Black Territory, and the deeper the Ore Star, the greater the chance of it producing higher Order materials. The ones we collected here are mainly mined from the Ore Stars near the outer region, so one would be lucky to even find a Fifth-Order material. If you don’t believe me, you can check them yourself.”

Yang Kai had noticed it as well. Out of the resources that Luan Bai Feng’s subordinates found from the Black Stones here, it was true that the highest one only reached the Fifth-Order, and the amount was very small. He could not help but frown, “Then, where did you find the ones in the Sixth-Order, and even in the Seventh-Order?”

Luan Bai Feng explained, “Naturally, they came from the deeper Ore Stars. Previously I had several Sixth-Order ore slaves among my subordinates, and those things were mined by them. Unfortunately, no one is able to go into the deeper Ore Stars since they’ve passed away, so we are naturally unable to get to them.”

Yang Kai understood, “Is that why you were so eager to intervene when Heavenly Sword Union was stirring trouble in my Void Land?”

Luan Bai Feng remained silent.

Yang Kai stroked his chin, “So to say, in order to obtain Sixth-Order materials, there is no other choice but to go deeper into the Black Territory to mine them.”

“You could say that!”

Yang Kai nodded, “In that case, let’s go.”

“What?” Luan Bai Feng looked at him in shock, seemingly doubting her ears, “What are you thinking of doing?”

“We are going to go to the Ore Stars where the Sixth-Order materials are produced to mine out the Black Stones!” While speaking, Yang Kai reached for Luan Bai Feng, grabbing her by the shoulders, then turning around and flying off.

Luan Bai Feng was agitated and anxious as she shouted, “Let me go, I’m not going there!”

Yang Kai broke out into a fit of laughter, “Since you are under my command now, that’s not up to you to decide!”

“You bastard!”

The dozen Open Heaven Realm Masters who were hard at work watched dumbfounded as their usually terrifying and overbearing Warden was carried away by Yang Kai like a little chick, cursing all the way and disappearing in the blink of an eye. As if they had seen a ghost, cold sweat ran down their foreheads.

In the void, Yang Kai enveloped his World Force around Luan Bai Feng, who was clearly uncooperative, her expression as cold as ice.

“Do you really need to make a face as if you just lost your parents? We’re just going on a mining trip, not to have you killed!” Yang Kai laughed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Luan Bai Feng answered coldly, “Naturally, it is because you do not understand the dangers deep inside of the Black Territory. Even after managing this place for so many years, I still dare not say that I know the Black Territory like the back of my hand. There are countless Natural Arrays in this place. Once triggered, neither you nor I would be able to escape easily!”

Yang Kai nodded, “That is why I will have to depend on you on this journey. I’m not very proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays, but if I die here, you will not get away either.”

Luan Bai Feng gritted her teeth, “I have never met a man as shameless as you before!” Inwardly she was drowning in regret. If she had known this would happen, then she would not have told Yang Kai that Sixth-Order materials could only be found in the deeper Ore Stars. She had moved a rock only to smash her own foot.

However, although Luan Bai Feng’s words were harsh and unpleasant, she was still quite sensible and flexible; otherwise, she would not have surrendered so easily. She knew that she could not resist, so after throwing a small tantrum, she cooperated obediently.

She knew herself that if she were to slack off here, then with Yang Kai running all around the Black Territory triggering the Arrays, something bad would happen sooner or later, then she herself would have to suffer for it.

After a half day’s journey, Luan Bai Feng suddenly spoke, “The area we have arrived at will start to get more dangerous. Do not leave my side no matter the cost; otherwise, if you were caught up in a powerful Array, even I would not be able to save you!”

“Got it!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

Then, Luan Bai Feng suddenly rubbed her eyelids with her fingers. Looking over, Yang Kai saw that her eyes were suddenly glowing with a purple light, exuding a demonic charm.

Yang Kai raised his brow. It was not until now that he finally learned that this woman actually cultivated an Eye Secret Technique, too. That was the reason why she said what she did when she saw him use the Demon Eye of Annihilation.

She must have noticed Yang Kai’s gaze because Luan Bai Feng explained, “I was born with this Eye Secret Technique, I did not cultivate it. It doesn’t have any offensive or defensive abilities, but it seems to have a natural advantage in deciphering arrays.”

Yang Kai was enlightened, “So that is how you became so proficient in the Dao of Spirit Arrays?”

Luan Bai Feng’s Eye Secret Technique had a natural advantage when it came to cracking Arrays, and having lived in this Black Prison for so many years, observing and emulating the many Natural Arrays in this place, even someone unlearned in the Dao of Spirit Arrays would be able to grow into a Master in time.

Luan Bai Feng coldly snorted, “How else do you think a poor little girl can survive in the 3,000 Worlds alone?”

“A little girl?” Yang Kai could not stop himself from laughing.

Luan Bai Feng glared menacingly at him.
