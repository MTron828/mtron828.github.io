After gently calling out to her a few times, Shan Qing Luo did not show any signs of waking.

So as a last resort, Yang Kai could only use his hands to slowly stroke Shan Qing Luo smooth delicate waist, gradually applying more and more strength until his fingers involuntarily sunk deeply into her supple bottom and severely massaged it a few times.

Feeling her shapely hips touched so aggressively, Shan Qing Luo finally woke up.

Unconsciously twisting her tender body, a seductive moan leaked from her mouth.

Hearing this, Yang Kai regained his wits and quickly stopped.

Seeing her pair of elegant enchanting eyes slowly open, Yang Kai hurriedly whispered, “Beauty, you have to control yourself!”

Once she became aroused, the consequences would be disastrous. After all, Yang Kai didn’t want to faint again after just waking up.

Her eyes were slightly confused for a while, then Shan Qing Luo quickly composed herself and recalled everything that had happened. Seemingly aware that Yang Kai had just pulled some kind of stunt, this devilish woman actually ground her teeth in frustration and glared at him, “Little bastard, what did you do ? “

However, Yang Kai just grinned and shrugged, “I was just trying to wake you up.”

Without waiting for her to shoot back, Yang Kai quickly re-directed the conversation, “What should we do now?”

Shan Qing Luo’s brow wrinkled as she struggled a little, soon finding that she and Yang Kai were tightly wrapped together by the silk cocoon unable to move about freely or even separate. She also quickly became aware of something hot and hard pressing against her lower abdomen.

Her lashes jittering, Shan Qing Luo giggled meaningfully as she glanced towards Yang Kai.

Understanding her meaning, Yang Kai without an ounce of embarrassment said, “It’s an instinctive reaction, definitely not intentional, you can only blame yourself for being too charming!”

However, Shan Qing Luo didn’t seem annoyed, just a bit shy as her cheeks became slightly pink.

“These spider webs are quite tough, it won’t be easy to break free from them.” Yang Kai frowned as he discussed their situation, “But, my artifact can still cut through them.”

“Don’t!” Shan Qing Luo quickly warned, her expression quite solemn “Right now we are quite weak, even if you can cut open this cocoon there’s no way for us to escape this place with so many Sixth-Order Monster Beast around. If we provoke them, we’ll only end up dying faster.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. It was because he was worried about this exact point that he had not already tried to cut his way free. Although he had gained control of one of the Sixth-Order spiders before falling unconscious, in their current predicament it wouldn’t be enough to ensure their safe escape. For now, it was better if he simply allowed it to guard his and Shan Qing Luo’s safety.

“Earlier, you said you came here to find something?”

This subterranean cavern was clearly a spider’s nest, and not a normal spider’s nest at that. With so many Sixth-Order Monster Beasts living here, along with countless Fifth-Order and Fourth-Order poisonous spiders, this was definitely not a place to take lightly.

“This is the Spider Mother’s Den!” Shan Qing Luo softly replied, a faint sweet aroma wafting off her breath, like the scent of flowers, gently brushing past Yang Kai’s nose, which caused him some slight discomfort. “My family’s special constitution was acquired from here. It is said that one of my ancestors had come here by accident hundreds of years ago and was bitten by a great poisonous spider. After going back, her physique changed and was from that point on passed down from generation to generation.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

In this world, some people’s constitutions were very special, different from the average persons’.

So far, Yang Kai had only met one such person, Xia Ning Chang who possessed the Sacred Spirit Medicine Body!

And now, he had met Shan Qing Luo, the possessor of the Poison Widow Body. However, comparing the two, Shan Qing Luo’s special constitution was somewhat evil.

Most special constitutions were innate, unable to be inherited by one’s descendants.

But this Poison Widow Body was undoubtedly the kind of constitution that could be inherited!

“Every one of my ancestors, after their cultivation had achieved a certain height, would come here seeking something. Obtaining it would allow them the display the full potential of their physique.” Shan Qing Luo continued to explain “I have never been here before and had only learned the route from my mother, but I did not expect after all those twist and turns to inadvertently arrive here. Perhaps this is the will of the Heavens!”

Letting out a faint sigh, Shan Qing Luo wasn’t sure whether this was a fortunate or unfortunate development.

“Yang Kai?” As the two of them were speaking, all of a sudden they heard Qiu Yi Meng’s voice.

Apparently she had been placed next to them and had just now awoken. Yang Kai glanced around and soon discovered the source of her voice, a slightly struggling white spider cocoon a couple meters away from him.

“Elder Sister Qiu ...” Luo Xiao Man’s voice also called out, coming from another cocoon to his right.

This was an unexpected coincidence, these two little girls actually being placed beside Yang Kai.

“Xiao Man, don’t be afraid, don’t move around too much, you don’t want to attract those Monster Beasts’ attention.”

Qiu Yi Meng was still quite calm, even taking the time to comfort Luo Xiao Man.

“En,” Luo Xiao Man swiftly replied, stopping her struggles.

“Yang Kai, I know you are next to me, I clearly heard your voice!” Qiu Yi Meng called out softly. Under such dangerous circumstances, she didn’t dare speak too loudly.

“What do you want?” Yang Kai snapped back. He very much didn’t like this woman. She had unreasonably come to High Heaven Pavilion, acting completely domineering, and without a word launched an attack which caused him to be separated from his companions and his lover.

“Still upset?” Qiu Yi Meng giggled lightly, her voice did not contain the slightest remorse or embarrassment. “Facing imminent death, will such a big man like you care so much about some past grievances with a little girl like me?”

“Little girl?” Yang Kai snorted, “The Qiu Family’s world’s famous first young lady, only twenty one years old yet already a True Element Boundary Ninth Stage master, the Qiu Family’s great hope for the future, the object of every Eight Great Families’ young master’s dreams? You dare call yourself some ‘little girl?’”

Qiu Yi Meng giggled happily, “You seem to know quite a bit about me, are you perhaps an admirer of mine?”

“Hah! Why would I concern myself with you?” Yang Kai spat disdainfully “This Young Master currently has this world’s most charming woman in his arms, her tender peaks pressed right up against my chest! Enough nonsense, if you have something to say just say it!”

Shan Qing Luo gently pinched and twisted Yang Kai’s waist, but her eyes still flashed a touch of pride.

Listening to others praise her charms was normally grating because they were no doubt hiding ulterior motives, coveting her beauty or profaning her in their minds, but somehow Yang Kai praising her felt comfortable. Just his comment about her chest was a bit distasteful.

“Must you use such foul language?” Qiu Yi Meng frowned.

“Then don’t bother listening if it offends you. I’m also too lazy to waste my spit on you.”

Qiu Yi Meng softly laughed, “But you’re right, in the face of the Elder Sister Shan, the dream woman of every man, I really can’t compare.”

Shan Qing Luo watery eyes twinkled slightly, and she softly whispered to Yang Kai, “This little girl really has some a quick wit, she probably has something she wants to request.”

Sure enough, Qiu Yi Meng quickly followed up, “Qiu Family Qiu Yi Meng greets Elder Sister Shan. A few days ago, I was unaware of Elder Sister Shan’s distinguished status, moreover I even offended you. I humbly ask Elder Sister Shan to not mind my impoliteness.”

Qui Yi Meng had obviously heard Shan Qing Luo’s name, one of the six Great Evil Kings. Although she was currently the weakest, she was also the youngest, so there was no doubt that it would not be long before she could openly hold her own against the other five overlords.

One month ago, she had not known her identity, but now that she did, Qiu Yi Meng naturally did not show any disrespect.

“Hehe...” Shan Qing Luo giggled openly and smiled happily towards Yang Kai before leisurely responding, “Junior Sister Qiu’s tongue is quite sweet, but this Elder Sister Elder Sister you keep shouting about, I believe the gap in our ages isn’t that small.”

Qiu Yi Meng grinned happily and softly quipped, “Though Elder Sister is definitely older, she most definitely looks younger. If we were to go out together, others would only be able to think I am the Elder Sister.”

Hearing such praise, Shan Qing Luo smiled more radiantly, and her charm instantly magnified.

[This temptress!] Yang Kai took a deep breath, and did not dare to stare into her eyes, afraid he might lose control of himself, “Sister Qiu, please be at ease.” Shan Qing Luo quickly asked, no longer teasing Qiu Yi Meng. With the Beguiling Demon Queen as her partner, even this Qiu Family’s first young lady was under no small pressure, always on edge, afraid she may inadvertently anger her.

“What advice does Sister Qiu want to speak?”

“I don’t dare!” Qiu Yi Meng politely replied, “Junior Sister just wished to ask if Elder Sister has any way of escaping our current predicament?”

Shan Qing Luo was the strongest master here, and although she was also currently bound, she was still the best chance they had of making it out of this situation alive, and relying on the others like Guo Yuan Ming was not even worth considering.

“If Elder Sister has any way out of this, could you possibly bring our two Junior Sisters along with you?” Qiu Yi Meng asked cautiously “Elder Sister Shan will not regret doing so, my Qiu Family has a Treasure Bead, a naturally occurring Heaven Grade Top-Rank artifact. By perennially wearing it, it will preserve the beauty of Elder Sister Shan’s face, if you can help us, Junior Sister can have it brought to you.”

Shan Qing Luo’s beautiful eyes suddenly flashed, obviously somewhat interested.

Qiu Yi Meng was indeed the Qiu Family’s first young lady. Although she was young, she was still well versed in reading people’s hearts. If she promised Shan Qing Luo some outstanding Precious Treasures or high grade elixirs she would likely not be tempted, but this artifact specifically useful for maintaining a woman’s beauty was clearly different.

After all, which beauty didn’t want to maintain their youthful radiance and appeal?

Especially a Heavenly beauty like Shan Qing Luo, her face becoming yellowed and wrinkled after merely a hundred years was no doubt one of her biggest worries.

Observing Shan Qing Luo’s silence, Qiu Yi Meng knew that she had found a path forward and immediately pressed her advantage. She quickly followed up, “If Elder Sister Shan has any other request, please don’t hesitate to ask, as long as this Junior Sister can accomplish it, I will agree.”

“Oh... really?” Shan Qing Luo suddenly smiled slyly.

“Of course!”

“Good, then I want you and that little girl named Xiao Man!”

Qiu Yi Meng was startled, quickly wearing a forced smile, “What does Elder Sister Shan mean?”

“I have a little rascal here who seems to be very interested in both of you. If you can serve as his maidservants for a year, I’ll take you with me when I leave this place!”

“Hey...!” Yang Kai couldn’t help pinching the beauty before him, calmly saying, “Why are you trying to pull me into this? I don’t deny that I have some stray thoughts towards them, but that’s just a man’s nature. I don’t actually want to be involved with them.”

“I’m just casually saying things; I don’t actually have a way out of this mess.” Shan Qing Luo grinned.

“Are these his intentions?” Qiu Yi Meng replied, a gentle grating sound was apparent in her voice. Although she did her best to hide it, she was clearly irritated.

“Nope, these are just my whims!”

“Elder Sister Shan seems to be quite good towards him.” Qiu Yi Meng smiled helplessly and wondered why the Beguiling Demon Queen would take such an interested in this little High Heaven Pavilion brat.

[They... they’ve only known each other for less than a month or so. During that time, what exactly happened?]

“Please let me consider Elder Sister’s proposal!” Qiu Yi Meng bit her lip and whispered.

“En.” Shan Qing Luo didn’t force her any further, instead just nodding lightly.
