Chapter 1651, Slap In The Face

“Take someone? Who do you want?” Luo Li frowned, “My Ice Heart Valley should not have anyone you need, Chi Huo.”

“Indeed, your Sect truly does not have anyone I need, but...” Chi Huo waved his hand and shouted, “Little bastard, stand up and say it yourself; after all, this is your business.”

Wei Feng wore a happy look and quickly walked out from behind Chi Huo. First, he saluted Luo Hai, Luo Li and the others, following proper etiquette, then straightened his waist and opened his mouth, but just as he was about to speak, suddenly noticed a pair of cold eyes fixed on him.

This gaze pierced Wei Feng like a sharp sword, making his face pale with fright and forcing the words he was about to speak back down his throat.

He was unable to utter a word.

Following that gaze, Wei Feng only saw Luo Li staring at him coldly. Although she was not using any of her power, just this simple gaze was enough to chill him to the bone.

Wei Feng’s legs began to shiver as he nearly started choking, his eyes filling with panic.

Bing Long and the other Elders suddenly thought of something and unconsciously glanced over at Su Yan.

When Wei Feng came forward, they realized what Chi Huo was thinking about, and all of them became extremely displeased.

The son of Brilliant Flame Sect’s Sect Master had ideas about Su Yan for quite some time, and the fighting which broke out a little more than a year ago was all because Brilliant Flame Sect asked Ice Heart Valley to hand over Su Yan.

The people of Ice Heart Valley knew exactly what Wei Feng’s disposition was.

It could be said that if Wei Feng was not born in Brilliant Flame Sect, and if he was not Wei Qing’s son, even breaking through to the Saint King Realm would have been impossible.

Even if he consumed countless rare and precious pills and piled up innumerable Saint Crystals, he had barely managed to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.

Even with all that, he could not even condense his Shi!

He may be the only Origin Realm cultivator in the entire Star Field that did not possess his own Shi, making him a laughingstock to the world.

Wei Feng’s aptitude was obviously trash.

Compared with him, Su Yan was a beautiful fairy blessed by the Heavens. The two of them belonged to different worlds and should never have met.

But one time, when Su Yan went out for life experience, she accidentally bumped into Wei Feng, and he was immediately entranced by her and became determined to make her his.

Brilliant Flame Sect decided to use this as an excuse to kick up a big fuss!

Wei Feng’s character and morals were indeed terrible, but he was still the son of Wei Qing, so his status was extraordinary. Brilliant Flame Sect thought that Wei Feng taking a fancy to Su Yan was Su Yan’s blessing...

And so, Chi Huo bringing Wei Feng to Ice Heart Valley and forcing him to stand up and speak now made his purpose self-evident.

However, this pitiful boy nearly passed out from fear just by being glared at by Luo Li, unable to even open his mouth to speak.

Chi Huo’s face became extremely ugly as he watched Wei Feng destroy all the face Brilliant Flame Sect had. Annoyed, he kicked out and almost knocked Wei Feng to the ground.

“Useless thing! With this old master here, what are you afraid of? Just say what it is you want and prove to this old master you’re still a man!”

Chi Huo shouted loudly.

It seemed that being scolded by Chi Huo, on top of receiving such a guarantee, Wei Feng’s courage grew slightly, and with a flushed face, he grit his teeth, stretched out his finger, and declared, “I want this woman named Su Yan!”

All of Ice Heart Valley’s Elders were enraged!

Ran Yun Ting also wore an unsightly expression.

The smile on Yang Kai’s face gradually dimmed as his eyes became icy cold as he glared towards Wei Feng and curled his lips into a subtle grin.

Since entering this ice palace, Yang Kai had found this pathetic excuse for a man continuously staring at Su Yan; however, he hadn’t taken it to heart, after all, Su Yan was an incredible beauty who naturally attracted the attention of men. Now that Wei Feng had said something like this though, Yang Kai immediately understood that the other party wasn’t just satisfied with looking but wanted to possess her too!

A murderous intent surged in Yang Kai’s heart as he stared at Wei Feng faintly, his expression somewhat similar to the one Wei Feng gave him before.

It was as if he was staring at a dead man!

Su Yan turned her beautiful eyes at this time and frowned slightly as she stared at Wei Feng suspiciously.

She did not seem to regain consciousness until this time as all her thoughts had been focused on Yang Kai before, with nothing else entering her vision at all.

“You again?” Su Yan recognized Wei Feng and spoke indifferently, “What? Was the lesson I gave you not enough? Did you come here looking for more?”

These simple words made Wei Feng jump up like a frightened rabbit and he hurried back to Chi Huo, seeking a sense of security.

Wei Feng’s performance was terrible to the extreme, and Chi Huo also felt he had lost all face, his expression turning as black as the bottom of a pot.

Even Luo Hai, who had been watching from the side, slowly shook his head.

“You know him?” Yang Kai asked.

Su Yan shook her head, “I don’t know him. Last time we met; he made some impertinent remarks so I broke a few of his ribs. It turns out he actually belongs to Brilliant Flame Sect, no wonder he was so persistent and annoying.”

After saying so, she sighed again, “If I had known things would turn out like this, I would have just killed him directly and been done with it.”

“En, don’t show mercy next time,” Yang Kai patted the back of Su Yan’s hand.

Su Yan smiled and nodded slightly.

“You...you... how dare you!” Although Wei Feng was timid and incompetent, he also could not help feeling a little angry at this moment. He could not forget about Su Yan even in his dreams, yet the other party clearly did not even know about his background.

On top of that, it seemed she did not even know his name.

Wei Feng suddenly felt aggrieved, watching her act so intimately with this bastard of a man, completely ignoring his existence, he felt ashamed.

“You’ll see! When you become mine, I’ll let you know how fierce I am!” Wei Feng vowed daringly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Courting death!” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed a cold light as he violently waved his hand towards Wei Feng.

A recognizable palm of Saint Qi appeared and shot towards Wei Feng like a violent storm. This palm clearly contained terrifying destructive power.

Wei Feng was frightened and trembled as his face turned pale and he called out anxiously, “Supreme Elder, save me!”

“Boy, you’ve got guts, daring to act in front of this old master!” Chi Huo coldly snorted as he stretched out his hand and hit the air, causing the Saint Qi palm to burst apart.

The moment this palm exploded, however, it immediately underwent a subtle change and transformed into a sharp blade that once again shot out and caught Chi Huo off guard. Before he could react, the blade had already stabbed through Wei Feng’s left cheek and out his right.

Chi Huo’s face changed dramatically!

Luo Hai also raised his brow as he stared at Yang Kai in surprise.

Luo Li’s beautiful eyes also flashed brilliantly as she gave a nod of appreciation.

The three of them all saw that it was not that Yang Kai had applied some hidden trick to his Saint Qi palm, but had instead manipulated his Saint Qi masterfully, reorganizing it after it was shattered by Chi Huo to form a new attack.

Although as a result, this attack’s power was greatly reduced, to the point where even Wei Feng should have easily been able to defend against it.

However, Wei Feng’s performance was disappointing as he did not even notice anything until he was abruptly injured.

Only after blood began splashing from both sides of his mouth did Wei Feng notice the severe pain, feeling as if his cheeks were being burned as a strange power seeped into his wounds.

He immediately began howling violently, covering his cheeks with his hands as tears and snot dripped down his face, making everyone present embarrassed to even look at him.

Many Ice Heart Valley Elders shook their heads slowly as looks of contempt and disgust filled their faces.

Such a person actually wanted Su Yan? Comparing him to Yang Kai, the latter was countless times better, a real match for her.

Chi Huo’s old face went blue then white as he stared at Yang Kai and squeezed out a low shout like that of a mad beast, “Brat, you’re dead!”

In front of his face, Wei Feng’s cheek had been pierced. This was akin to slapping his face as well.

Chi Huo being slapped in the face was the same as Brilliant Flame Sect being slapped!

An old monster like Chi Huo could not bear such an insult.

Like a dormant lion, a horrific aura burst from Chi Huo’s body, causing everyone from Ice Heart Valley to pale.

Yang Kai remained calm and relaxed, though, as he stared at the red-haired old man indifferently, a sarcastic grin appearing on his lips.

“Chi Huo!” Luo Hai shouted, “Finish your business!”

He naturally would not let Chi Huo kill Yang Kai. Chi Huo using him to persecute Ice Heart Valley this time was something Luo Hai was willing to go along with only if Chi Huo did not pursue Yang Kai’s secrets.

However, if Chi Huo wanted to act against Yang Kai, he would not just sit back and watch.

No one could touch Yang Kai in front of him until he extracted everything he wanted.

Hearing this shout, the aura around Chi Huo’s body was like a raging flame that was doused with cold water, extinguishing instantly. He seemed to have regained his composure in that instant and simply glared at Yang Kai coldly.

“Supreme Elder, you must seek justice for me! Kill him! Kill him! Supreme Elder you must kill him for me!” Wei Feng wailed and cried incoherently, oblivious to the situation around him.

Chi Huo’s breathing began somewhat ragged hearing these cries.

Why did he bring this waste here to Ice Heart Valley?

At this moment, he could not wait to slap Wei Feng dead.

Chi Huo secretly made up his mind that after this trip, he would definitely imprison Wei Feng in Brilliant Flame Sect and never let him go out. Otherwise, he would continue destroying Brilliant Flame Sect’s face wherever he went.

Brilliant Flame Sect having such a waste in its midst was simply a curse from the Heavens!

“You shut up!” Chi Huo shouted angrily.

Wei Feng’s howling stopped abruptly as he did not dare disobey the Supreme Elder’s command, but the pain he felt still distorted his expression, and combined with the still dripping blood, made him look quite hideous.

Holding his cheeks with his hands, his eyes darted about, but not daring to look at anyone present in this hall, he settled for staring at his feet while holding his tongue.

“Boy, consider yourself lucky! Since Brother Luo Hai intends to shelter you, this old master will not care about you this time. If you want to thank anyone, you should thank Brother Luo Hai!” Chi Huo said grimly before turning to Luo Li and shouting, “I think you’re clear why this old master has come this time. My good-for-nothing Junior has taken a fancy to this girl, so I’ll be taking her back to Brilliant Flame Sect with me!”
