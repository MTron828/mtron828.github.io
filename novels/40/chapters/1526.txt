As soon as the Origin King Grade Starship appeared, everyone was dumbfounded.

Almost without any pause, a shocking energy fluctuation appeared as the ship’s Crystal Cannons began charging and aimed directly towards Bai Xi.

“Yang Kai, you dare!” Bai Xi paled in shock, never expecting Yang Kai to be so decisive and ruthless.

Without even trying to discuss things with him, Yang Kai went straight for the kill, not leaving him any room to manoeuvre.

Did this boy really not fear perishing together with him?

“Kill him!” Yang Kai coldly shouted.

Bai Xi’s expression became flustered as he saw the Crystal Cannons aimed at him and the energy fluctuations growing stronger by the moment. When a white beam of light faintly formed and ready to fire, Bai Xi could no longer restrain himself and roared, “Little brat, you forced me to do this! Even if this old master dies here, you won’t feel any better!”

Saying so, he madly poured his Saint Qi into the Annihilation Thunder Bead.

The Emperor Pressure radiating from the bead swelled, causing everyone present to tremble.

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn, as did Ye Xi Yun’s, the two of them staring directly at the Annihilation Thunder Bead in Bai Xi’s hand.

One after another, rice-grain sized runes emerged from the Annihilation Thunder Bead and as Bai Xi’s Saint Qi continued to flood into it, a small lightning arc suddenly appeared from its surface.

Although this arc was small and inconspicuous, it pulsed with an unfathomable power that seemed capable of extinguishing the soul of anyone it touched.

In the next instant, Bai Xi tossed the Annihilation Thunder Bead upwards, where it then split into two, then four, then eight...

In the blink of an eye, the sky was filled with Annihilation Thunder Bead with lightning arcs flickering around each of them, like tiny lightning snakes.

Then, these arcs lased out in unison, shooting towards the Origin King Grade Starship.

Yang Kai could tear space, and Ye Xi Yun had extraordinary strength and experience, so Bai Xi wasn’t confident he could kill either of them with this blow, thus he decided to aim at the Origin King Grade Starship!

If he could destroy this Starship, then his goal would have been achieved. At that time, Yang Kai would likely shed tears of blood!

After using the Annihilation Thunder Bead, Bai Xi’s aura became extremely weak.

Although this Emperor Artifact had unmatched power, a trivial Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivator needed to pay an enormous price to use it. Consuming almost all of his Saint Qi at once was the price Bai Xi needed to pay.

Although he knew he was bound to die, he was still laughing wildly at this moment.

Bai Xi’s cackling came to an abrupt halt though when he noticed both Yang Kai and Ye Xi Yun directing looks filled with pity at him, neither of them seeming the slightest bit concerned about the Origin King Grade Starship.

[What’s going on?] Bai Xi heart clenched, suddenly realizing something was wrong, glancing up towards the Origin King Grade Starship instinctively.

Lightning arcs filled the sky, each one containing extraordinary destructive power as they crashed towards the Origin King Grade Starship, completely overwhelming it and shattering it in an instant, causing it to disappear without a trace.

Just as it appeared before, it vanished silently.

As if it had never been there in the first place.

Bai Xi was dumbfounded when he saw this and his face suddenly became extremely pale as he called out hoarsely, “An illusion?”

“Seems you’re not a complete idiot, old man!” Yang Kai laughed.

Accompanied by his laughter, another Origin King Grade Starship appeared mid-air. It was the same as the one from before, but this one was completely undamaged, as if the Annihilation Thunder Bead hadn’t left a scratch on it.

Bai Xi’s face filled with shame. At this moment, how could he not understand that he had been fooled by his opponent’s plot?

The attack he had placed all his hopes on had not hit anything, it was only an illusory Starship, which explained why it was destroyed so easily!

Being pressured by Ye Xi Yun and facing Yang Kai’s aggressiveness, Bai Xi’s judgement had become clouded and he was unable to distinguish between reality and an illusion.

But how did they create that illusionary Starship? And such a realistic one at that, capable of even deceiving his Divine Sense. It was simply incredible.

“Old dog, it’s time to send you on the road!” Yang Kai declared coldly as a Golden Blood Thread appeared between his fingers and transformed into a sharp golden arrow.

“Let me do it, it is this Queen’s duty to clean up her own Sect,” Ye Xi Yun suddenly called out.

Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at her for a moment before nodding lightly, no longer insisting.

He knew that Ye Xi Yun was doing this for his benefit. Regardless of whether Bai Xi was helping a tyrant do evil or not, he was still a long-standing member of Star Emperor Mountain. If an outsider killed him, it would inevitably create some dissatisfaction.

But if Ye Xi Yun took action it was different.

She was simply cleaning up the Sect, just as she said.

Without any Saint Qi, Bai Xi was like a venomous snake without fangs, unable to even summon ordinary artifacts, so how could he oppose Ye Xi Yun?

Moments later, Bai Xi died by Ye Xi Yun’s hand.

“Are you two going to cripple your cultivations or do you want this Queen to deal with you personally?” Ye Xi Yun coldly glared towards the two who had arrived with Bai Xi.

The two of them didn’t dare to resist and immediately shouted, “Sect Master, please forgive us! We didn’t know that Sect Master was still alive and were deceived by that usurper. Please show mercy, Sect Master!”

“After reaching this point, do you think this Queen will believe your words?” Ye Xi Yun remained unmoved.

Since the two of them had come here with Bai Xi, they must have been aware of the news from the outside world, proving they had chosen to oppose her, so now they would have to pay the price.

But even though she killed Bai Xi, Ye Xi Yun didn’t want to act ruthlessly if it wasn’t necessary.

“This is the absolute truth, please understand Sect Master!” The two cried out in fear.

“Fine, since you insist on acting stubborn, this Queen will personally send you to reunite with Bai Xi!” Ye Xi Yun declared coldly as her Saint Qi surged up again.

“Wait! We’ll cripple ourselves! We’ll do it!” Seeing that Ye Xi Yun was really going to kill them while refusing to listen to their explanation in the slightest, the two men quickly made a decision.

In any case, it was better to live than to die. Although their fate after crippling their cultivations would surely be miserable, it couldn’t be worse than losing their lives on the spot.

Yang Xiu Zhu and the others were watching vigilantly from nearby, so these two didn’t dare play any tricks, honestly shattering their dantians and meridians, scattering their Saint Qi, and degenerating into ordinary mortals, forever unable to step onto the Martial Dao again.

“Get out!” Ye Xi Yun commanded coldly.

The two hurriedly helped each other up and scampered away.

After these two left, Ye Xi Yun turned her head to look at the crowd, took a deep breath, and declared firmly, “This Queen knows that some among you may have collaborated with that person in the past, but even so, you have not harmed the honour or foundation of the Sect, so this Queen will not insist on holding you all accountable. Now, this Queen has only returned to this place to clean up the Sect on behalf of the honoured ancestors, so I will only ask all of you to wait here while this Queen deals with that person before we speak any further.”

“Many thanks for Sect Master’s magnanimity! May Sect Master’s victory be swift and decisive!” Yang Xiu Zhu bowed.

“May Sect Master’s victory be swift and decisive!” Everyone followed suit. Now was their only chance to prove their allegiance, so how could anyone dare speak otherwise? Even if some people had indeed been won over by and worked for the current Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain, none of them had fully submitted like Bai Xi.

The law does not punish the public, and Ye Xi Yun did not want to take things too far, so she gave these people a way out. After all, there weren’t many of them, so there was no way they could resist Ye Xi Yun’s momentum.

“Sect Master, let’s go,” Ye Xi Yun looked over at Yang Kai.

“En,” Yang Kai gently nodded before glancing over at the two hundred gathered cultivators and sighing slightly.

If they were willing to help, this matter wouldn’t be so troublesome. Against so many masters, even if the current Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain had Heaven-defying strength and abilities, there would be no way for him to resist.

Unfortunately, these people were all Star Emperor Mountain members and were forbidden to kill one another.

This was a law passed down by their ancestors that all of them needed to follow.

Yang Kai and Ye Xi Yun drifted away while the Origin King Grade Starship followed behind slowly.

Star Ascendance Peak was the highest summit in Star Emperor Mountain, towering up in the sky where the white clouds lingered, giving it a beautiful and mysterious scenery.

This was where, for generations, the disciples of Star Emperor Mountain would pay homage to the Great Emperor. There was an altar at the top of this peak engraved with the names of each generation’s Sect Master and Elders, atop which sat a Star Emperor Token.

The Divine Ability sealed inside this Star Emperor Token had already been expended.

Now, it was simply a symbol of the Great Emperor!

Every year, on a certain day, everyone in Star Emperor Mountain would gather here to make some offerings.

At this moment, two people stood in the wind on Star Ascendance Peak.

One was a spirited old man that, although appearing old, still had a ruddy complexion and tender skin. The other was a middle-aged man in green robes.

At this moment, the middle-aged man looked anxious while the old man looked relaxed.

Several dozen meters away from the pair was a young man with his head lowered.

If Yang Kai was here, he would definitely recognize two of these three people. The middle-aged man was Thunder Typhoon Sect’s Sect Master Fang Peng. He really came to Star Emperor Mountain to seek refuge.

As for the young man, it was Leng Qing, who was an acquaintance of Yang Kai’s.

In the fourth layer of the Flowing Flame Sand Field, outside the current High Heaven Sect headquarters, the two young men had met once. Both of them had been Saint Kings at the time, but were now Origin Realm cultivators, their respective cultivation speeds only describable as fast.

At this moment, the young man stood there motionless like a fossil, a cold and determined expression adorning his face.

Fang Peng’s anxious voice soon called out, “Brother Tian Che, they seem to have reached Star Emperor Mountain. Don’t we need to do something?”

The old man chuckled, “What does Brother Fang think we should do?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Fang Peng frowned, “This Fang doesn’t know what Brother Tian Che has planned, but if we don’t act now, I’m afraid that the outcome will be decided before we even begin.”

“Haha, Brother Fang worries too much, the outcome is undecided until it is over. Calm down.”

“This Fang does not understand, please enlighten me, Brother Tian Che.”

“It’s not that Brother Fang is dull, it’s just... Before this King and Senior Sister Ye can determine a winner, nothing else will matter. The decisive factor will be whether she survives or I do, so in the end, this King only needs to fight Senior Sister Ye!”

Fang Peng frowned, thought for a moment, but eventually understood, hesitating briefly before asking “Then what does Brother Tian Che think his odds of winning are?”

The old man simply smiled without saying a word, acting mysteriously.

Seeing his expression, Fang Peng’s eyes brightened as he slowly calmed down. Although he didn’t know what this old man was relying on, it seemed that he was quite certain of his victory.
