“Impolite?” Zhuang Pan sneered, “And just how will you treat me impolitely? This Deacon is really curious to know how City Lord Duan will follow through on his threat.”

“Beat me then, beat me if you dare!” Zhuang Pan put his face in front of Duan Yuan Shan and the others and blatantly provoked them.

The cultivators all around shook their heads with disdain.

These foreign cultivators were basically meeting Zhuang Pan for the first time and knew nothing about him before today, but the attitude and behaviour of a man could be easily seen when he spoke like this.

Zhuang Pan was undoubtedly a type of villain that would kick an opponent when they were down, the type of person everyone despises.

The Patriarchs from the few big families in Maplewood City who rushed here revealed their sad expressions as they were sympathetic to Duan Yuan Shan’s plight.

Over the years, the big families had been under the management of the City Lord’s Mansion, and although there were some frictions and conflicts between them, there were no big fights or wars. In fact, the City Lord’s Mansion had mostly served as a buffer between the big families, earning it the respect of these families.

Seeing the City Lord, Vice City Lord, and the Patriarch from the Qin Family being bullied and disdained by Zhuang Pan at this moment, it was natural that those Patriarch would feel uncomfortable.

*Pa... *

A crisp sound suddenly resounded.

Everyone was dumbfounded as cold sweat formed on their foreheads, wondering to themselves if Sir City Lord had really lost his temper and acted rashly.

With doubt, they turned and looked.

The scene they saw stunned them.

They saw a figure standing in front of Zhuang Pan, cracking his neck and palming his fist, as if he was getting ready to fight.

“Who!? Who dares to strike me!?” Zhuang Pan was stunned by the slap just now. He felt half of his cheek swell up and go numb. His head had been struck sideways, so he couldn’t see who had slapped him immediately, so he immediately shouted hysterically as he turned his face back, “Who dare... uh...”

Mid-shout, his eyes met with Yang Kai’s grinning face and suddenly felt like he was being stared at by a vicious beast. This brought a chill to Zhuang Pan’s back as he forcefully choked down the ruthless words he was about to say.

“Interesting...” While speaking, Yang Kai gave another slap again. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

*Pa... *

With another crisp sound, Zhuang Pan’s other cheek swelled up as several bloody teeth flew from his mouth.

Yang Kai grabbed Zhuang Pan’s collar with one hand, fixing him in place, then proceeded to slap Zhuang Pan’s face continuously with his free hand, each time adding a little force to his blow, the Source Qi on his palm growing more and more vigorous.

*Pa pa pa... *

Rhythmic and crisp music played out above the empty wilderness.

“This is the first time...” Yang Kai kept on slapping his face while sneering at him, “I’ve heard someone... wish to be beaten so badly... I simply had no choice but to oblige!”

All the cultivators felt pain from looking at the scene, and could not help touching their own cheeks.

Zhuang Pan was completely dumbfounded and it took a long time for him to recover. When he did, he struggled violently to free himself from Yang Kai’s grip.

But a man with just a First-Order Dao Source Realm cultivation like him could not possibly achieve this, so he remained completely suppressed by Yang Kai’s Source Qi.

In despair, Zhuang Pan cried loudly and begged for mercy, “Senior Yang, stop, stop, don’t beat me anymore.”

“Senior Yang, I know my mistake, I really know! Please let go of me, I apologize to you!”

“I’m a Deacon of Flying Saint Palace, quickly release me!”

“Bastard! You can kill me, but you can’t humiliate me. I will go all out on you if you keep doing this...”

“Wuwuwuwu... Senior Yang, please spare my life, I don’t want to die!”

The cultivators around watched this scene and heard every single word from Zhuang Pan, all of them openly despising him now for his lack of spine, honestly thinking his death would not be worth pitying.

After several dozen slaps, Zhuang Pan’s face no longer resembled that of a human.

Previously during the fight, Yang Kai did not try to kill Ning Yuan Shu due to his unique identity and because he had a father who was an Emperor Realm Master. Yang Kai did not want to cause unnecessary trouble for himself.

But it was different with Zhuang Pan. Every slap from Yang Kai sent bursts of Source Qi into Zhuang Pan’s meridians, snapping and breaking them along the way.

In other words, even if Zhuang Pan survived this time, he would become a cripple without any cultivation and unable to cultivate anymore.

“Little Brother Yang...” Duan Yuan Shan could not bear the miserable look of Zhuang Pan “Forget it, being a coward is in his nature. In the end, he did not cause us any losses, so just give him a quick mercy.”

Drunkard made a burp, his eyes gleaming with cold light as he said, “Beat the snake to death to avoid it climbing up your stick. Allowing a tiger back to the mountains would only breed calamity for the future!”

While speaking, he suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed the top of Zhuang Pan’s head.

Yang Kai squinted, stretched his hand and pushed Drunkard’s hand away and smiled, “Sir Vice City Lord shouldn’t be bothered with such a trivial matter.”

It was inappropriate for Drunkard to do the dirty job, but not Yang Kai. He had beaten Ning Yuan Shu up before, so how could killing Zhuang Pan be worse than that? In any case, he already had a silent feud with Flying Saint Palace, so this act would not change anything.

When his words fell, Yang Kai clenched his hand tightly and poured his Source Qi into Zhuang Pan before tossing him out.

“Ahhhhh....” Zhuang Pan yelled miserably, but his scream ceased abruptly when his body exploded, turning into a rain of blood, showering down on the ground.

The surrounding cultivators kept silent like a cicada in the winter.

However, when they recalled the moment when Yang Kai killed the Vice Valley Master of Evil Moon Valley, they secretly felt that this scene in front of them was not a big deal.

Duan Yuan Shan and Drunkard simultaneously cast their grateful eyes at Yang Kai, thanking him for cleaning up Maplewood City’s mess.

At that moment, the ambient World Energy trembled again and an indescribable feeling suddenly surged forth from the horizon, followed by a muffled sound of thunder and a rumbling from the earth.

Everyone was shocked and looked around.

“Does anyone else feel like... the World Energy in the air has suddenly become richer?” A Second-Order Dao Source Realm cultivator among the crowd asked.

Someone immediately answered, “I felt it before, but I thought it was my imagination. Since Brother Liu has sensed it too though, it seems to be real!”

“Since there’s a change in the World Energy, it’s very likely something has happened to the Source Crystal lodes or the Earth Veins!”

As soon as this statement was made, everyone’s eyes lit up and after exchanging a few knowing glances, all of them executed their Movement Skills and rushed towards the place where the Source Crystal Lode and Earth Veins were located.

Duan Yuan Shan and Drunkard were the Lord and Vice Lord of Maplewood City, so obviously they could not just sit back and watch, immediately following after the others after saying goodbye to Yang Kai.

“Brother Yang...” Qin Zhao Yang looked at Yang Kai, “It seems that the tremor we sensed before was not triggered by the battle between Luo Yuan and Gao Shan and Lui Shui, but rather because something happened to the Earth Veins and Source Crystal lode.”

“It should be!” Yang Kai nodded. He also thought the tremor happened because of the battle between Luo Yuan and the two Protectors, but right now it seemed that there were other reasons.

“Would you like to check it out?” Qin Zhao Yang asked Yang Kai for his opinion.

“Of course I have to take a look at such an interesting matter,” Yang Kai grinned. Just as he was about to leave, however, he caught a glimpse of Ye Jing Han from the Thousand Leaves Sect standing not far away, looking at him quietly.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

This woman was like a sticky plaster he could not get rid of, which really annoyed him.

Acknowledging Yang Kai’s annoyed face, Ye Jing Han stepped back some distance, her face filled with sorrow which made it hard to ignore.

“Let’s go!” Shouting so, Yang Kai rushed towards the source of the tremor.

When the pair arrived, there saw a great glow on the horizon as well as a gathering of bright clouds high above. The barren wilderness seemed to have been transformed into some kind of paradise at this moment.

“What’s happening?” Qin Zhao Yang was puzzled.

When Demon Qi flooded the city, he and Yang Kai had come to this region to assist Qin Yu in reinforcing the ancient seal. Although their plan failed, they did not notice anything unusual about the seal except for a boundless amount of Demon Qi.

However, a few months later, many Earth Veins and a Source Crystal lode had surprisingly been found here.

*Hong... *

A loud sound burst out at that moment as a massive pit appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes. From this pit, an intense beam of light suddenly shot out into the sky.

“This is...”

“Heavens.”

“Can there be such a thing in this world?”

All the cultivators who came here yelled as they looked up at the beam of light. Using their Divine Senses, they all immediately discovered the true nature of this phenomenon.

This beam of light was actually formed by a convergence of the purest World Energy, one so rich it actually began to form into a kind of condensation.

Everyone was so astonished that they could not believe their eyes, their faces filling with extreme excitement.

The purity and concentration of World Energy in this place were astonishing. The cultivators who came here were at best from second-class Sects and families which all had their own cultivation paradises, places where the World Energy aura was richer and could allow their disciples to cultivate faster.

But when everyone compared the World Energy in their own cultivation zones to this place, the difference was simply incomparable.

Perhaps, only the cultivation paradises occupied by peak level Sects could be like this.

All of sudden, the beam of light that soared into the sky burst apart and an unimaginably rich World Energy began to fall down on the surrounding area in tiny droplets.

*Xi xi li li... *

In an instant, it began to rain.

World Energy Rain.

The richness of the World Energy in this once barren wilderness rose at an incredible speed...

In no time, everyone was standing in what appeared to be a massive Spirit Qi Sea.
