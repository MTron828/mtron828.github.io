A short while later, Yang Kai received the Loyalty List back from Luan Bai Feng’s hands with great satisfaction. There, on the final page, was Luan Bai Feng’s name written in three large, bright red characters.

From the time that Chen Tian Fei volunteered to put himself on the Loyalty List at the very beginning until now all nine pages had been used up.

On each page was Blood Essence used to write the name of each person.

Chen Tian Fei, Hei He, Yun Xing Hua, Mao Zhe, Geng Qing, Zhou Ya, Hui Gu, Xin Peng, Luan Bai Feng!

Unless one of them died, a new blank page would not appear in the Loyalty List. And out of the nine, as many as five pages were taken up by Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, which helped Yang Kai on many occasions.

Without the Loyalty List, Yang Kai would not have had the confidence to bring the three Mountain Lords of Profound Yang Mountain out from the Shadowless Cave Heaven. Without the Loyalty List, there was no way he could safely cooperate with Hui Gu, much less subdue Luan Bai Feng on this day!

The Loyalty List was a mysterious artifact with great binding force refined by a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master that had been nicknamed Loyalty Demon many years ago. The list was made using the flesh and bone of the Divine Spirit, Xie Zhi. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, the power of the Loyalty List depended on who was using it.

Even though Chen Tian Fei also held the Loyalty List back then, he was only in the Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so the Loyalty List was of little use in his hands; however, things were different when it was passed on to Yang Kai’s possession.

“So, that’s how it is. No wonder Xin Peng had the guts to betray me.” Luan Bai Feng glanced at the Loyalty List with a grim look on her face. She saw Xin Peng’s name on the Loyalty List just now, which dispelled all her doubts from before. It was only natural that Xin Peng would obey Yang Kai’s orders since he was under the Loyalty List’s suppression.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Don’t look so reluctant. It’ll be much better for you to join me than to stay holed up in the Black Prison. There’s a big world out there, so if you’re free, you should go out and have a look!”

Luan Bai Feng coldly snorted, “The winner is the King, the loser is the villain. Anything you say is right.”

Yang Kai then took a glance around and commented, “These subordinates of yours don’t look very loyal!”

Luan Bai Feng was livid.

She had not come out alone today; she had brought some other subordinates with her, but when she was fighting Yang Kai, none of them came forward to help her. Of course, part of it was because Yang Kai had moved so quickly that they did not even have the time to react, but if they were truly loyal to her, then they would naturally have come to save her by now.

In fact, they had only been watching from afar on the ship without any intention of coming closer. They had even taken a stance where they might leave at any moment.

“What are you all staring at? Scram!” Luan Bai Feng’s stomach was full of grievances.

A dozen Open Heaven Realm Masters of different Orders rushed into the ship in an instant, disappearing without a trace.

Luan Bai Feng turned to look at Yang Kai, “Are you satisfied now? My name is already on your Loyalty List. Now, whatever orders you have for me, just voice them.”

“There’s no hurry. What’s more important is to heal your injuries first. I can’t bear to see a beautiful woman like you burned like this either.” While saying this, Yang Kai used his Towering Evergreen Divine Manifestation. Wondrous green branches dropped down, enveloping Luan Bai Feng with rich vitality.

Earlier, under the Golden Crow’s True Fire, Luan Bai Feng had tried her best to resist, but she was still burnt all over, with her exposed skin covered in appalling blisters.

They looked terribly painful, but Luan Bai Feng did not say a word about it, which showed how strong her endurance was.

Now, with the surge of vitality from the Towering Evergreen, Luan Bai Feng’s surface injuries healed at a rate visible to the naked eye. While resisting the tingling sensation caused by the technique, Luan Bai Feng turned her face away, “Do not expect this Queen to thank you for such a small favour.”

She had a calm expression on her face, but inwardly, she was quite shocked. Her burns came from the Golden Crow’s True Fire, yet the Wood Element Divine Manifestation that Yang Kai used was actually able to produce such visible restorative capabilities, [Just what Order Wood Element Power did he condense when he was advancing to the Open Heaven Realm?]

Yang Kai was unperturbed, “Now that you have submitted to me, I will naturally treat you well, so I do not expect any thanks from you, either.”

Luan Bai Feng frowned and shut her eyes, enjoying the rich vitality that was healing her wounds. A moment later, she suddenly spoke, “Xin Peng was instructed by you to draw me out, so how much of what he said is true, and how much of it is false?”

“What he told you is basically the truth.” Yang Kai responded with indifference.

Luan Bai Feng’s eyes widened in surprise, “So, it’s true that Zuo Quan Hui was injured?”

“Indeed!”

Luan Bai Feng’s brows furrowed in thought for a moment before she nodded lightly, “You must have been the one to injure him. Your abilities are... a little better than what I expected!”

Even after fighting Yang Kai personally, Luan Bai Feng still could not understand how someone in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm could be so strong.

“Zuo Quan Hui was careless and underestimated his opponent, which allowed me to take advantage of the situation; otherwise, how difficult do you think it is to wound a Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Master?”

“Your Void Land and Zuo Quan Hui have already tossed aside all semblance of civility, yet you choose to run all the way here instead of staying back and watching after your Sect? I may be in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, too, but not even ten of me can match up against Zuo Quan Hui. If you are expecting to use me as a countermeasure to deal with Zuo Quan Hui, then I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. Unless... Did you come here just to take revenge? After all, I did give you trouble twice in the past.”

Yang Kai laughed, “Void Land is as strong as iron. Even without me there, there’s nothing Zuo Quan Hui can do to it. I didn’t come here for you this time. Rather than that, it’s the Black Prison that I’m interested in! There are plenty of supplies in the Black Prison, and I happen to be in need of cultivation materials!”

Luan Bai Feng clenched her teeth and snarled, “Shameless!”

Yang Kai chuckled and took back his Towering Evergreen, “Think what you’d like. Now, let’s go. Bring me into the Black Prison.”

Luan Bai Feng glared viciously at Yang Kai before turning around reluctantly, “Follow me!”

After the pair returned to the ship, Xin Peng ran back as well. He seemed very embarrassed to see Luan Bai Feng again, but she did not even spare him a glance.

This woman knew, too, that the reason why her ship would have capsized on calm seas this time was partly to do with Xin Peng, but Yang Kai was the main culprit. Even if she wanted to kill Xin Peng for revenge, Yang Kai would not allow it, so there was no point in doing something useless.

On board the ship, the other dozen Open Heaven Realm Masters were all looking at Yang Kai in awe. They saw with their own eyes how powerless Luan Bai Feng had been when she was forced to submit to Yang Kai, so they had an inkling about just how powerful this man was.

The boat was not too far away from the Black Prison, so it only took a few moments to return.

After passing through the Territory Gate, they soon arrived in the Black Territory.

A dim light enveloped the entire sky. Standing on the deck, Yang Kai looked up and saw there, far away, was a great sun that was giving off light. However, unlike an ordinary Sun Star, this one gave off the impression of a dying old man. There were even black spots forming on its surface from time to time.

Yang Kai had refined the Golden Crow’s True Fire and had the Divine Manifestation, Golden Crow Casts the Sun, which was why he was constantly haunted by an indescribable feeling ever since stepping into the Black Territory.

He could clearly feel that the Black Territory’s sun was about to die!

It was not that he had not experienced the death of a Sun Star before. Back then, when he was escaping Seven Wonders Land, he witnessed with his own eyes as a Sun Star went out, and it was there that he obtained the Golden Crow’s carcass, which in turn allowed him to refine the Golden Crow’s True Fire.

Only, he never expected to see such a similar scene again after so many years.

Perhaps, hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of years later, the Black Territory’s Sun Star would also burn out.

There was only this one Sun Star in the entire Black Territory as far as the eye could see, so once this Sun Star was extinguished, the entire Black Territory would be plunged into cold darkness.

The dying Great Sun enveloped the entirety of the Black Territory in an air of solemnity.

“This Black Territory does not seem very large,” Yang Kai noted his observations after looking around.

Luan Bai Feng subconsciously twirled her hair with her finger as she commented casually, “The Black Territory wasn’t large to begin with. Compared to the other Great Territories, you can even say that it’s pitifully small. There’s even only one Sun Star. What other Great Territory have you seen that’s like this?”

Yang Kai nodded lightly, “You’re right, I’ve never seen one like this before.”

Luan Bai Feng continued, “Legends say that the Black Territory used to be similar to other Great Territories. It was large and vast, but for some reason, it slowly shrank to the size it is now. Perhaps, once the final Sun Star goes out, the entire Black Territory will cease to exist. However, it’s thanks to this that the Black Territory was left untouched. Otherwise, how do you think that I, a woman, would be able to occupy such a piece of land? The environment here is harsh, so those under the Open Heaven Realm are simply unable to survive. Only those above the Open Heaven Realm can live here. If it were really any kind of prosperous place, then it would long have been taken over by other great forces.”

“En.” Yang Kai deeply agreed with her sentiments. Looking up, he saw the large and small celestial bodies floating silently in the void. The smaller ones were maybe a few dozen kilometers in diameter, while the larger ones may even be compared to the Star Boundary. However, the ones that could be seen were all filled with pits and cracks. Some were even split into pieces.

Those pits and cracks were clearly traces left behind by cultivators.

“These are...” Yang Kai frowned.

Luan Bai Feng explained, “All the objects in the Black Territory are technically Ore Stars that give birth to Black Stones. What you see are the mined-out Ore Stars, and these are only from the outermost region.”

Yang Kai understood and was just about to ask her more questions when Luan Bai Feng waved her hand, “Do not disturb me right now. We have already arrived at the area covered by the Natural Arrays. If you want to die together, then speak freely; otherwise, keep your mouth shut and don’t poke around with your Divine Sense! There are many peculiarities in this place.”

Yang Kai rubbed his nose embarrassedly and kept silent. When he looked around, he saw that all of the Open Heaven Realm Masters on the ship all had stiff looks on their faces, as if something very bad was about to happen.

All eyes were fixed on Luan Bai Feng, and at this moment, the woman had a grave look on her face as she kept forming new hand seals while guiding the ship through the void.

A few moments later, Yang Kai clearly sensed a terrifying power lurking around them. This power felt like it was sleeping, yet could be woken up with the slightest disturbance, bringing about a Heaven destroying, Earth shattering disaster.

Since he had received Luan Bai Feng’s reminder earlier, Yang Kai did not dare to probe his surroundings either. He was stunned that the Black Territory actually turned out to be this ferocious, and he had no idea how Luan Bai Feng was able to survive in a place like this.
