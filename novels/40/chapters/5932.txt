Chapter 5933: Information

In this world, Black Ink Strength existed, as did the Black Ink Cult, an opposing force to the Light Spirit Religion.

“Holy Son, Black Ink Strength is highly corruptive and can warp a Human’s nature. Please check whether you have been affected!” Zuo Wu You anxiously warned.

Yang Kai merely shrugged. Even Black Ink Strength wielded by a Royal Lord couldn’t harm him, let alone the extremely diluted power possessed by someone from the Black Ink Cult.

Although his Small Universe was currently suppressed and sealed, making it impossible for him to use his World Force, the World Tree clone was still there. Moreover, with the protection of the Soul Warming Lotus, he was essentially immune to the effects of Black Ink Strength.

Still, it was a thoughtful warning, so Yang Kai went through the motions of checking himself before saying, “It’s fine. This Black Ink Strength seems to have no effect on me.”

Upon hearing that, Zuo Wu You and Liu Ji breathe a sigh of relief.

Their attention then turned to Yan Peng, who stood motionless to the side. Ever since this Immortal Ascension Boundary Master had used his Soul Avatar earlier, he became frozen in place, and even the death of a large number of his subordinates aroused no reaction from him, as if he had lost his Soul.

It made Zuo Wu You and Liu Ji puzzled.

“Holy Son, what’s happening to Yan Peng?” Zuo Wu You asked, uncertain but with a suspicion forming in his mind.

“His Soul has been shattered. He’s basically a living corpse now,” Yang Kai explained.

Zuo Wu You was shocked, “Holy Son, do you possess one of those Special Constitutions that are immune to all evil?”

The fact that Yan Peng’s Soul shattered as a result of his using his Soul Avatar against Yang Kai, coupled with his resistance to Black Ink Strength, left Zuo Wu You at a loss for words with no explanation of what just happened.

“Something like that,” as Yang Kai was thinking about how to explain it, Zuo Wu You was thoughtful enough to come up with an explanation for him.

Seeing him admit to it, Zuo Wu You and Liu Ji exchanged a glance, both thrilled beyond measure. 

The Holy Son was impervious to all evil, born to counteract the means of the Black Ink Cult. He was truly the future hope of the Spirit Religion; the Saintess’ prophecy was right on the mark!

Furthermore, his strength was unfathomable. He didn’t even need to use much power in his previous killing spree, only employing the most basic Sword Secret Techniques. Yet, the Black Ink Cult Masters were unable to block even a single strike.

At this moment, the gloom in their hearts was illuminated by the dawn’s light.

“We shouldn’t stay here for long,” Zuo Wu You said, struggling to stand up before falling back down. His injuries were still severe.

It was the same for Liu Ji. He was caught off guard by Zheng Hai and took a direct punch to the back. If Zheng Hai hadn’t reserved some strength to attack Yang Kai, that punch would have ended Liu Ji’s life.

“You should both rest and recover for a while,” said Yang Kai.

Zuo Wu You looked bitter. Although he wanted to leave this dangerous place as soon as possible, he was strong in will but weak in strength. After exchanging a glance with Liu Ji, he decided to heal his injuries on the spot and try to restore some strength for now.

Inside Yang Kai’s Knowledge Sea, on the seven-coloured island, Yan Peng’s Soul Avatar became respectful and forthcoming before the young man and the thunder leopard; he would answer any questions they had without holding anything back.

This couldn’t be helped. Yan Peng initially thought this seven-coloured island was his great opportunity, never expecting to find two Masters here whose strengths were both beyond his imagination. 

Yan Peng did not doubt that either of these two could extinguish his Soul with a single thought.

How could people under the eaves not lower their heads?

Fortunately, the young man was kind enough not to harm him, only asking for some basic information.

So, Yan Peng cooperated obediently.

After a brief exchange, Feng Tian Ci uncovered some secrets of this World, which he naturally shared with the others.

In the Primordial World, two Great Forces, the Light Spirit Religion and the Black Ink Cult, had vied for dominance since ancient times, each claiming half of this independent World.

Even after years of unending conflict, neither side could gain the upper hand.

Within the Black Ink Cult, there was a Black Ink Master who could bestow Black Ink Strength upon all living beings, corrupting their hearts and minds, making them obedient servants of the cult.

Meanwhile, the Light Spirit Religion was the only force that could stand against the Black Ink Cult. They had been battling them for countless years. Without them, the entire World would have fallen into the hands of the cult long ago.

The first-generation Saintess of the Light Spirit Religion left behind a prophecy, which was the same one that Yang Kai heard from Liu Ji. Over the years, the followers of the Light Spirit Religion had been searching for the whereabouts of the Holy Son while fighting against the Black Ink Cult, because according to the guidance of the first-generation Saintess, the only way to completely defeat the Black Ink Cult was for the Holy Son to appear.

Likewise, the Black Ink Cult was also searching for the whereabouts of the Holy Son of the Light Spirit Religion.

Unfortunately, neither side had made any progress.

Until today, during the Black Ink Cult’s hunt for Zuo Wu You, Yang Kai suddenly descended from the sky…

When the news reached Yan Peng, he personally led his men to capture Yang Kai, but things took an unexpected turn as they were all slaughtered and Yan Peng found himself trapped.

On the small island, Fang Tian Ci continued to question Yan Peng for more information.

Meanwhile, in front of the ruins, Yang Kai fell into deep thought.

The information he had was not extensive, but he now had a general understanding of the situation; however, there were two things that were different from what he had initially thought.

The first was the impact of Black Ink Strength on living creatures.

In the outside world, Black Ink Strength was extremely potent. Any Master who was contaminated by it and failed to deal with it in time would inevitably become a Black Ink Disciple. These beings had long since abandoned their humanity and identities and became loyal only to Mo. It could be said that any Black Ink Disciple would willingly sacrifice everything they had for Mo.

However, Yan Peng was different.

Though his Soul Avatar was trapped on the Seven Colour Island, he had a strong will to survive; otherwise, he wouldn’t have cooperated with Fang Tian Ci and provided so much information about the Black Ink Cult.

In other words, he wasn’t a true Black Ink Disciple!

[Is it because of how weak the Black Ink Strength is here?]

When Yang Kai killed those Black Ink Cult members before, the last few activated their Black Ink Strength to enhance their abilities; however, their Black Ink Strength was extremely thin and clearly abnormal.

It seemed that Black Ink Strength in the Primordial World could distort someone’s nature to a certain extent, but it wasn’t potent enough to transform them into true Black Ink Disciples.

The second point of curiosity was the Saintess of the Light Spirit Religion.

Yang Kai had a suspicion about the Saintess before, but after learning some information about her from Yan Peng, he began thinking he might have been wrong.

The prophecy was left behind by the first generation Saintess of the Light Spirit Religion; since then, the Light Spirit Religion had gone through many generations of Saintesses.

Among the past Saintesses, some were assassinated by the Black Ink Cult, some experienced cultivation dissonance, and some naturally died when their predestined time arrived.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If that was the case, then this Light Spirit Religion’s current Saintess was not the person he wanted to meet…

Another thing that caught Yang Kai’s attention was the name of this World – Primordial World.

The name of this World seemed to imply something.

Yang Kai felt helpless. Although Mu had left a hidden hand in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, it was still elusive; he had to clear the fog in front of him before he could glimpse the truth.

“It’s time to go,” he said after half a day.

Since Yan Peng personally took action, the Black Ink Cult would certainly send more Masters to investigate the situation once there was no news from him for long enough.

In fact, according to the information revealed by Yan Peng, he was able to arrive so quickly only because he happened to be nearby.

The other Black Ink Cult Masters should also have set out and were on their way.

The appearance of the Holy Son of the Light Spirit Religion, even if it was only a possibility, was a matter that the Black Ink Cult would not take lightly.

Together, Zuo Wu You and Liu Ji opened their eyes. Half a day of rest was not enough to completely heal, but they had gained enough strength to move at the very least.

Yang Kai raised his hand and threw the long sword back to Zuo Wu You.

Zuo Wu You caught the sword and spoke, “Only in the hands of the Holy Son can this sword unleash its true power.” 

Yang Kai’s swift and efficient movements were all observed by him, which left him in awe and realised that if he could enter retreat and comprehend these Secret Techniques, he would surely bring his Sword Techniques to the next level.

Yang Kai shook his head casually, “No need, I’ll use this.”

With a flick of his foot, a long spear lying on the ground flew into his hand. He wasn’t sure which dead Black Ink Cultist it belonged to, but after giving it a quick shake, he was satisfied with how it felt in his hand, despite it being not the best of quality. 

Without saying anything more, Zuo Wu You approached Yan Peng and swiftly beheaded him with his sword. 

Then, the three of them set off in a certain direction under Zuo Wu You’s guidance. 

When they left, all that remained were dead bodies and destruction.

An hour later, a group of beasts attracted by the scent of blood arrived, but soon became alert and fled after a brief hesitation. Suddenly, a blood-red line shot through the air and pierced one of the beasts, causing it to cry out in agony and turn into a lifeless husk. 

The blood-red line transformed into a blood-red light, from which a figure strolled out.

The figure was a woman in tight red robes, her stunning physique accentuated by the vivid colour of her clothes. Her nails were long and sharp as blades, and she licked her lips with satisfaction after the recent kill, her eyes curved with pleasure.

Dozens of people had already gathered around, examining the remnants of the battle. 

After a while, the woman spoke up casually, still filing her nails as if sharpening a blade for herself, “Anything noteworthy?”

Someone quickly knelt down and respectfully replied, “Chapter Master, all of them died from sword injuries, killed by a single strike. Even Yan Peng seemed to have put up no resistance before he died.”

“Oh?” The woman showed a hint of surprise, “So Yan Peng didn’t even try to fight back? Looks like there were some extremely powerful swordsmen among them. Was it Zuo Wu You?”

“It couldn’t have been Zuo Wu You. He’s only in the True Element Boundary, while Yan Peng is in the Immortal Ascension Boundary. With a difference of a Major Realm, Zuo Wu You couldn’t have been responsible,” the Black Ink Cult disciple explained.

“So it must have been their newfound Holy Son,” the woman raised an eyebrow.

“I don’t know, Chapter Master.”

“Which way did they go?” 

“It should be that way,” the man pointed in a direction.

Immediately, the woman’s body flickered, turning into a blood beam, which shot towards that direction. Her voice echoed in the distance, “I’ll go on ahead. You guys catch up as soon as possible.”
