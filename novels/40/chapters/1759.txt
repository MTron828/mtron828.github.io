Chapter 1759, Immortal Tree

“Oh...” The strange Origin King stopped suddenly, as if he had just discovered something, and turned towards the underground ravine, using his Divine Sense to survey it. After a while, he let out a burst of wicked laughter and muttered to himself, “There’s actually such a thing here. Although I do not know what you are, you’re useful to this old master.”

Saying so, he jumped directly into the ravine.

As soon as he landed, countless small black shadows sprang out from the crevices lining the ground in all directions and leapt towards him like starving beasts.

This man wasn’t afraid though and instead excitedly shouted, “Haha, good, good. Come!”

Saying so, he summoned a large black flag that immediately released a series of wailing howls. These howls drowned out the scattered cries of the dark shadows and from the flag, numerous twisted, phantom-like human faces appeared.

Forming a series of seals with his hands, the strange master poured his Saint Qi into the black flag and shouted, “Go!”

In the next moment, the black flag turned into a giant black curtain that shrouded the surrounding region and, as if they had encountered their nemesis, the small black shadows were easily suppressed and swallowed up.

As the black flag swallowed up these black shadows, the aura it emitted became stronger and stronger while the darkness became deeper and deeper.

It seemed capable of swallowing everything in existence, even light.

The horrible suction force of the black flag obviously made the black shadows panic and soon they began to merge together, just like when Yang Kai and the others fled, in an attempt to fight off the black flag’s influence.

Seeing this scene, the Origin King wrapped in black Qi wasn’t afraid and instead became exhilarated, calling out, “You even have such a skill, good, good, good. This King’s Ten Thousand Soul Banner is going to have a feast today, kahahaha!”

As he laughed, he stretched out his hand and the black curtain twisted and condensed into a massive, terrifying human-shaped face. This face, however, had countless eyes and radiated an ominous and powerful light.

In addition, blood seemed to be overflowing from this face as he released violent and feral roars.

As the strange mouth opened, it continued to grow until it spread across and the entire face’s surface while at the same time, a vague human-shaped phantom appeared behind it.

The massive black shadow formed by the fusion of countless small shadows naturally didn’t sit there waiting to die and quickly lashed out with its two black whip-like hands in an attempt to block the advance of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner.

A huge cloud of dust and debris was kicked up from the intense shockwaves of the exchange, shaking the ravine and the surrounding earth.

However, it was all in vain.

The Ten Thousand Soul Banner did not fear the huge black shadow’s attacks at all and simply charged forward and bit down on it before raising its head up like a bird which had caught its prey and attempted to swallow it whole.

Vaguely, a scream came out from inside the face.

The terrifying face of the Ten Thousand Soul Banner flashed a look of satisfaction at that moment and its countless eyes shined with excitement.

*Ge...*

It even vividly belched.

The moment the huge black shadow was swallowed, the remaining fish that slipped through the net fled into the surrounding crevices, not daring to appear again. They seemed to have noticed that this Ten Thousand Soul Banner was their natural enemy, and they were unable to resist it!

Upon seeing this, the Origin King, who was still wrapped in black Qi, stretched out his hand somewhat unconsciously and summoned the Ten Thousand Soul Banner back to him.

On the surface, the Ten Thousand Soul Banner had not changed much compared to before, but the potency of the wicked aura it exuded was obviously greater.

“Heh heh heh...” The Origin King cackled lightly as he examined his artifact, nodding repeatedly, “Not bad, not bad. I just came in and already had such a harvest, worthy of the famed Severed World. This King is very much looking forward to what comes next!”

Clearly a bit disturbed in the mind, after talking to himself for some time, the Origin King put away his Ten Thousand Soul Banner and with a loud laugh wrapped his black Qi around himself tightly and rushed out of the ravine, chasing in the direction Yang Kai and his group had left.

Elsewhere in the Severed World, Sword Union’s Elder Cui Hong was desperately urging his artifact to fight off a Monster Beast that was nearly a hundred metres in length and resembled a winged snake.

His luck had been quite poor. Just after entering the Severed World, he had accidentally entered the territory of this Monster Beast, and when he was discovered, a fight broke out.

The greatest danger in the Severed World was the invisible Void Cracks scattered about irregularly and undetectable to both sight and Divine Sense. Even an Origin King Realm who touched such a Void Crack would not escape unharmed.

The second most dangerous thing, however, was the Monster Beasts that lived here.

The Monster Beasts here had almost all inherited the bloodlines of ancient variant species, and affected by the strong World Principles, they had all grown incredibly powerful. Even if similar Monster Beasts existed in the Star Field, the ones in the Severed World would generally be at least thirty percent stronger.

The one Cui Hong encountered was a genuine Tenth-Order Monster Beast, and from the looks of it, it had obviously inherited the bloodline of the Flying Feathered Python, but as time had passed and the World Principles had changed, this Monster Beast’s bloodline had diluted, and it was no longer able to display the full might of its glorious ancestors. If it had, Cui Hong would have died upon meeting it.

However, it was none-the-less a Tenth-Order Monster Beast, meaning it was equivalent to an Origin King in strength. A rare existence.

Fortunately, this Monster Beast did not seem to have broken through to its current level long ago, and as a Sword Union Elder, Cui Hong’s Artifact Armour and artifacts were all extremely high grade, so, he did not suffer much damage over the course of his battle and instead gained the upper hand by relying on various Secret Techniques.

This winged python was over a hundred metres in length, bat-like wings on its back and a long, sharp tongue in its mouth. It flew about in an extremely flexible manner, dodging around Cui Hong while ejecting its tongue like a steel whip from time to time, bombarding Cui Hong and causing him significant difficulties each time it landed a hit.

After a full three hours of fierce fighting, in exchange for taking a rather serious injury, Cui Hong managed to behead the winged python.

Standing in place, breathing heavily, his whole body stained red with blood, Cui Hong cursed angrily. After a short rest, he used what little strength he had left to collect the winged snake’s body into his Space Ring.

At this moment, he did not have the time to properly process the corpse and could only wait until after leaving the Severed World to deal with it slowly. The value of the corpse of a Tenth-Order Monster Beast was almost unimaginable, especially its Monster Core which had a huge attraction to Origin Kings.

When a cultivator reached the Origin King Realm, it became extremely difficult to break through because of the limitations placed on them by the Star Field’s Principles. If a cultivator wished to stride upwards, besides tortuous cultivation for an extended time while comprehending the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao, only rare treasures and powerful pills could enhance their strength.

An Origin King being unable to break through a single Minor Realm for centuries or even millennia was a very common occurrence.

Because of this, throughout the entire Star Field, Third-Order Origin Kings were extremely rare and almost all of them were old monsters who had long secluded themselves from the world...

After resting on the spot for a while, Cui Hong immediately left, afraid the smell of blood would attract other Monster Beasts. In his current state, he couldn’t fight another intense battle like just now.

In another place, Zi Long, the Sect Master of Purple Star, was bringing Zi Dong through the Severed World. He seemed to have a very clear goal and did not stop at any point along the way. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Their luck was also good, and they had not encountered any real danger since entering this place, so they proceeded with peace of mind.

“Father, does this Severed World really host an Immortal Tree?” Zi Dong, who was following Zi Long, suddenly asked.

Hearing the words ‘Immortal Tree’, Zi Long’s calm eyes suddenly burst with dazzling light and his long purple hair blew up even in the absence of wind. Nodding slightly, he replied, “Although your father cannot say for certain, the probability is at least eighty percent. After all, word of the Immoral Tree’s existence was sent back by your Grand Uncle. Two thousand years ago, your Grand Uncle once caught a glimpse of something very similar to the legendary Immoral Tree but when he attempted to obtain it, he was seriously injured by the Monster Beast that was guarding it and was forced to flee, ultimately dying from his wounds.”

Zi Dong’s face changed slightly as he whispered, “If I recall correctly, Grand Uncle was supposed to be a Second-Order Origin King, but he was still seriously injured by the guardian Monster Beast? What kind of Monster Beast was it?”

“A Divine Bird... an Ancient Peacock!” Zi Long took a deep breath.

“A Divine Bird!” Zi Dong couldn’t help paling slightly.

As long as a Monster Beast was classified as a Divine species, it was clear it was not to be provoked lightly. Every Divine beast had Heaven destroying and Earth-shattering means, as well as a vicious personality. If such a Monster Beast broke into the Star Field, it would likely destroy countless Cultivation Stars and become a disaster for the entire Star Field.

Zi Long then quickly followed up, “In the Star Field, the name ‘Three Great Divine Waters’ is widely known; one is Life Revitalizing Jade Cream, one is the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and one is Immortal Source Liquid! Among these three, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water does occasionally appear, but not often, only once every few hundred or thousand years. As for the Life Revitalizing Jade Cream and Immortal Source Liquid, both are things of legend, lost to history, or at least your father here has never met anyone who succeeded in obtaining either of them. Each of the Three Great Divine Waters has its own unique effects which make them precious treasures that cultivators dream of. The Soul Cleansing Divine Water can wash the Soul, purifying and condensing one’s Spiritual Energy, the Life Revitalizing Jade Cream can enhance a cultivator’s physique and vitality, a single drop allowing a person to be reborn. However, neither of these two compare to the Immortal Source Liquid.”

“Father, does the Immortal Source Liquid have some kind of relation with the Immortal Tree?” Zi Dong asked curiously.

“Haha, naturally they are related,” Zi Long, as the master of one of the Star Field’s biggest forces, was normally a dignified man, but he became quite amiable when facing his son; after all, Zi Dong had never failed to live up to his expectations and was the successor he put his hopes on.

“Please enlighten me, Father!” Zi Dong put on a respectful look and showed an appearance of humility.
