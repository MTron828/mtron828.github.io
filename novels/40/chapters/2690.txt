Patriarch Gong looked around, and pointed out, “It seems that this place has something other than just a Five Elements Grand Sealing Array. There is another Spirit Array linked to it.”

“An Array within an array!” The speaker’s face darkened. Although he was not proficient in Spirit Arrays, he knew the concept of nested arrays. Such Spirit Arrays were several times more difficult to arrange than just two independent Spirit Arrays.

“Even Patriarch Gong can’t recognize it?” A middle-aged man without facial hair asked. He initially thought that it would be a simple matter to break this Spirit Array with Patriarch Gong here, but he did not expect that Patriarch Gong would be having a tough time too, which really worried everyone.

Patriarch Gong shook his head, “It’s not that I can’t recognize it, but it is hidden too deep.”

“Can Patriarch Gong crack this array?”

Patriarch Gong answered, “It’s possible, but it would be a waste of time and effort.”

With his ability, if he was given three to four days, he was confident he could crack this kind of Spirit Array, but the auction would have long ended by then and this Spirit Array would naturally be opened at that point, so there didn’t seem to be a point in him cracking it.

“Relax, everyone.”

Just then, a voice suddenly came from behind. Everyone turned around in surprise and found Wu Ming standing nearby with a grin on his face.

“What exactly is Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce up to? It’s time to give us an explanation.” The middle-aged man without facial hair jumped out and glared at Wu Ming.

He thought that Wu Ming was a manager from Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce; after all, he was the one who welcomed the guests at the door earlier.

The rest glared at Wu Ming too.

Wu Ming smiled faintly, “Each of you is a precious guest, so what can I do to you? It’s just that this one’s Honoured Master had ordered that no one can leave before the auction has ended. As such, I hope everyone can please return to their room. Once the auction is over, Honoured Master will disable the array and allow you to leave.”

“Are you trying to bully us into staying here? This King demands to come and go whenever he wants! Quickly remove this array and let us leave!”

Wu Ming looked at the speaker with a light smile. He did not respond, nor did he even move, but all of a sudden, the surrounding World Energy surged and a sharp blade of five-coloured light materialised, shooting towards the speaker like an arrow released from its bow.

Everyone was taken aback and immediately dodged.

The face of Emperor Realm Master who stepped out turned pale. He immediately pushed his Emperor Qi to resist the incoming attack; however, all his efforts were in vain against the five-coloured blade. The blade penetrated his Emperor Qi protection, then opened a big hole in his chest.

Blood splashed everywhere.

Everyone gasped.

The man did not die instantly though, having just enough time to glance down at his chest, then looked up at Wu Ming as if he could not believe it and spoke in a trembling voice, “You…”

After saying just one word, this man fell to the ground.

The dozen other Emperor Realm Masters were in a state of shock. They could not believe that Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce dared to kill someone in its own branch. No one knew what the five-coloured blade was, except for Patriarch Gong, because it was not something generated by a cultivator, but rather by a Spirit Array. The Five Elements Grand Sealing Array not only had the ability to isolate space, but it also possessed the power to kill enemies inside of it.

Wu Ming stood there smiling still, but to the onlookers, his smile was scarier than anything in the world.

Previously, Yang Kai killed the old man in room seven in the auction hall with a stomp of his foot and a slash of his sword, but Wu Ming did not even move his hand and was able to kill this man. How could that be possible?

All of a sudden, everyone recalled the ‘Honoured Master’ who Wu Ming had mentioned before.

If Wu Ming himself was already a Second-Order Emperor Realm Master, wouldn’t only a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master be capable of becoming his Honoured Master?

With the addition of this Spirit Array to a Second-Order Emperor Realm Disciple and a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, everyone realized that they could be wiped out easily without even being able to put up a fight. Knowing this, fear began to creep into their hearts.

“Who else wants to leave?” Wu Ming looked at the crowd with the same eerie smile.

No one answered.

Wu Ming nodded, “Then, this way please.”

He stepped back and gestured for them to return to the auction hall.

Everyone exchanged looks with each other, but they dared not to have any different opinions, for the still-warm corpse in front of them served as a warning for them to not make the same mistake. Although they all looked infuriated, they dared not to say anything and went back to their rooms one after another.

“Patriarch Gong.” Wu Ming suddenly called.

Patriarch Gong stopped and turned his head, “What can I do for Your Excellency?”

Wu Ming smiled faintly, “Patriarch Gong is too polite. I didn’t expect that a trivial auction could attract Patriarch Gong’s honoured self to attend personally. My Honoured Master was truly surprised and wished to invite Patriarch Gong to have a small discussion.”

“And your Honourable Master is…?” Patriarch Gong questioned with a frown.

Wu Ming smiled lightly, “Patriarch Gong will know when you see him.”

Patriarch Gong laughed wryly, “Does this Old Master have a choice?”

He knew that nothing good would happen if he complied and secretly regretted giving a long speech and commenting on this Spirit Array just now. Although he had no idea about the purpose of this Spirit Array, it was obvious that the person who set up this Spirit Array was concerned about him, for he was a Spirit Array Grandmaster.

Wu Ming narrowed his eyes, and replied, “Honoured Master is offering his earnest hospitality, Patriarch Gong should not reject it.”

The tone was plain, but anyone could hear the threat behind it.

Knowing the fact that an arm was no match for the thigh, Patriarch Gong sighed, “Lead the way.”

He was also curious about the mastermind who had arranged all of this and what purpose he had.

“This way please!” Wu Ming turned around, but before he could take a step, he was horror-struck by what he saw in front of him.

Just steps away, Yang Kai was smiling at him.

Wu Ming was genuinely frightened of this young man who had just beaten him at the entrance of the auction house. His Second-Order Emperor Realm cultivation seemed so weak when confronting this anomaly.

The moment Wu Ming saw Yang Kai blocking his way, he instinctively jumped several tens of meters back and yelled, “Yang Kai, what do you want?”

Yang Kai glanced at him, then looked around and nodded in acknowledgement, “The Five Elements Grand Sealing Array isolates the world inside from the outside. It seems that you are well prepared to deal with this Young Master.”

Wu Ming’s face darkened when he heard this, as he realized that Yang Kai should have overheard the information Patriarch Gong disclosed just now.

It was true that his Honoured Master set up this Five Elements Grand Sealing Array to counter Yang Kai’s ability to use Space Principles. If they did not create a sealed space, Yang Kai could simply teleport away and flee anytime he wanted. Therefore, only by turning this place into a prison could they restrict his movements.

Wu Ming did not try to hide now that he was spotted by Yang Kai, and instead snorted coldly, “I warn you, you’d best cooperate, otherwise you’ll regret it.”

Yang Kai sneered, “You don’t need to care if I will regret or not, but if you dare act impudently to me again, I promise you won’t live to see another sunrise.”

Wu Ming’s face turned cold, but he really dared not act presumptuously anymore. He had witnessed Yang Kai’s strength and knew he was no match for him if they had to fight one-on-one. As such, he just stared at Yang Kai fiercely with a pair of resentful eyes.

“Patriarch Gong? I’ve long admired you,” Yang Kai cupped his fists towards the elderly man surnamed Gong.

“So you are Yang Kai?” Patriarch Gong swept his eyes over him in amazement.

Yang Kai frowned, “Has Patriarch Gong heard about me before?”

Patriarch Gong explained, “That brat Wen Shan mentioned you to me. Moreover, the news about Young Master Yang refining the Extraordinary Treasure Pill in the Four Seasons Realm caused quite an uproar in the Southern Territory.”

“Gong Wen Shan!” A vague figure flashed across Yang Kai’s mind. Although he did not really have a close relationship with Gong Wen Shan, he had at least had some dealings with him in the Four Seasons Realm.

On top of that, the reason Ye Jing Han came to Maple City to find Yang Kai to enlist his assistance in opening Emperor Heaven Valley was because Gong Wen Shan recommended him to her.

“Young Master Yang is truly a shining rising star, already reaching the Emperor Realm. Wen Shan, that boy, is still languishing in the Dao Source Realm. It seems the younger generation is destined to surpass the older,” Patriarch Gong sighed, secretly feeling that the Extraordinary Treasure Pill should have something to do with Yang Kai’s speedy breakthrough to the Emperor Realm.

Back then, Yang Kai refined a few Extraordinary Treasure Pills and bartered them away for certain treasures. Patriarch Gong had heard that Wu Chang of Heavenly Martial Holy Land and a young female Eight Paths Sect disciple had each gotten one. Wu Chang showed the powerful effect of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill when he broke through to the Emperor Realm, and although that Eight Paths Sect disciple had not broken through yet, she was now being courted by many top Sects looking to poach her. As long as she nodded and agreed, she could obtain the identity of Core Disciple in any top Sect straightaway.

All this was thanks to the Extraordinary Treasure Pills.

“Patriarch Gong flatters me, this Junior was just a bit lucky.” Yang Kai replied humbly and smiled, “This Junior would like to invite Patriarch Gong to have a chat in my room. I wonder if Patriarch Gong is interested?”

Patriarch Gong revealed a look full of gratitude because he understood that Yang Kai was resolving this awkward crisis for him, but he still hesitated as he glanced over at Wu Ming.

Yang Kai also looked over with a gloomy expression, “Patriarch Gong is going with me, do you dare to object?”

Wu Ming was maddened, but he did not dare to answer. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It seems that you have no objections!” Yang Kai curled his lip, then gestured to Patriarch Gong, “This way please!”

Patriarch Gong looked relieved, and gestured with his arm stretched too, “After you, Young Master Yang!”

Both of them walked towards the auction hall one after another. Before leaving, Yang Kai turned to Wu Ming and mentioned, “Go back and tell your Honoured Master to wash his neck and wait for this Young Master to take his head.”

Patriarch Gong stumbled and almost fell to the ground hearing this. He thought to himself that Yang Kai was really too young and impulsive. How could a First-Order Emperor Realm Master dare to challenge a Third-Order Emperor?

Wu Ming glared at the backs of the two people with a resentful face, secretly cursing, [You can bark as much as you like now, because you will definitely kneel down and beg for mercy later.]

Yang Kai brought Patriarch Gong back to room one and introduced him to Ying Fei, Ye Hen, and the others.

Patriarch Gong also thanked Yang Kai for offering him a way out of his earlier predicament.

Yang Kai waved his hand lightly, “There’s no need to thank me, Patriarch Gong. Although I had no idea why Wu Ming invited you, I’m sure he planned to use you to cope with me. Me bringing you here is a matter of self-interest.”

Yang Kai did not dare to underestimate a Spirit Array Grandmaster. If Patriarch Gong really cooperated by controlling the Spirit Arrays surrounding this auction house, the power these arrays would display would undoubtedly increase by at least thirty percent. If this wasn’t the case, Yang Kai wouldn’t have acted so rashly as Chi Yue, Ai Ou, and the others were still being held hostage by Wu Ming. If he really crossed the bottom line of the Honoured Master behind Wu Ming, nothing good would happen.
