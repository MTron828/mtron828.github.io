Chapter 47 - You think I’m Dirty?

As Kai Yang and Hu Mei Er’s figures, one in front , one behind, walked into Black Wind Forest, two figures stepped out from behind some trees.

One of the people wore a mask of extreme hatred as he looked at Kai Yang’s receding figure, there was also a light purple colour on his charming face. At one glance, you could tell that he had suffered a beating in these last couple of days.

While the other person’s expression was truly malicious, staring at Hu Mei Er’s swaying hips, a lustful glint flashed through his eyes.

“Junior brother Cheng, you were beaten by those types of people?” The cold and strict face of that youth looked over at Cheng Shao Feng, “Although you have just entered into the initial element stage and as such are somewhat weak you aren’t weak enough to not be his match. That guy looks like he’s only in the tempered body stage.”

Cheng Shao Feng began to defend himself: “I was a bit careless then, and that guy is really strange, for when he started to fight, he disregarded his life completely. As I thrust my sabre out, he actually used his palm to block it and as the sabre pierced through his hand, he didn’t even cry out. Not only did he stop my sabre, he also immobilised one of my arms, and it was because of this that I lost.”

“Oh? This is a bit interesting, only if we were to compete, who would be the fiercer one.”

Cheng Shao Feng followed him laughing: “Of course it’s senior brother Nu Tao who’s stronger, how can he compare to you.”

“Have you fully investigated his status yet? We can’t provoke or anger any powerful people.” Nu Tao asked him carefully.

“I have investigated clearly. This guy in Sky Tower is only a trial disciple with no background whatsoever. Even if you killed someone like this, no one would care. ”

“Ha ha, trial disciple? According to my knowledge, Sky Tower only has about ten trial disciples right? He’s one of those?” Nu Tao kept on laughing like he had heard some extremely good news, for as soon as he heard the two words, trial disciple, all his worries flew away. These people were Sky Tower’s disgrace, for him to lay a hand on one or even eliminate one would be him doing Sky Tower Pavilion a favour.

“En. Before I was afraid that people would come here , so I couldn’t carelessly attack. Who would have thought that this guy would unexpectedly go into the depths of Black Wind Forest with that slut. This makes things much easier.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Nu Tao laughed incomparably obscenely: “It looks like not only can junior brother obtain his revenge, he also has some luck with women. This is really killing two birds with one stone.”

Cheng Shao Feng also started to laugh: “Senior brother, saying those types of words, you are a helper I have called over. So if there are good things, how can this junior brother enjoy them alone? Later, once senior brother has had his fun, then junior brother will partake. Hu Mei Er that ** although she is loose in her morals,she is young, and her body will definitely be fine.”

(TL: OKAY, SOMEONE COME AND KILL THESE **** TARDS!!!)

“Junior brother is indeed generous!” Nu Tao was a bit impatient to get started and said: “Let’s go, there’s no time to lose. Let’s quickly catch up to them, and find a good opportunity to strike.”

To these two people, killing Kai Yang was a simple task. While in broad daylight with the sky as their bed, together they could ** Hu Mei Er, this was the thing they looked forward to the most.

As for when the time came, whether or not Hu Mei Er retaliated, they didn’t need to consider it. This ** person, as long as they made her feel pleasure, she would happily want more, so how would she dare to retaliate? In most likelihood, she would only immerse herself in that feeling of forceful and insulting pleasure and stop thinking about anything else.

These two people were not novices and often spent their time away in Black Plum Village’s red light district. Naturally they would know how to satisfy women like Hu Mei Er.

Deep in Black Wind Forest, Kai Yang still was walking and turning around to coldly laugh, Hu Mei Er was still a bit apprehensive. But after seeing Kai Yang repeatedly acting like this, she was no longer scared, not only was she no longer afraid, she had matched Kai Yang’s pace. Intimately she pulled on Kai Yang’s arm and covered his arm with her full and soft chest.

Kai Yang became distracted, but when he remembered this woman’s style, his aroused feelings immediately dissipated.

“What trouble do you want to cause?” Kai Yang was annoyed.

“Accompany me once! In the future, I will no longer bother you!” In all four directions, there was no sign of any humans, and Hu Mei Er didn’t bother to mask the intent behind her words in the slightest. She even dared to say these shameful things!

“Go and dream!”

“Am I not beautiful?” Hu Mei Er’s charming eyes were like silk, “Is my figure not good? Are you not even the slightest bit moved?”

“A woman is defined by her outside and inside traits. Your outside isn’t bad, and your are justified in being proud of it, but your inside is unbearable to look at.” Kai Yang looked at her coldly.

These words were a bit heavy, Hu Mei Er asked, her face down: “You think I’m dirty?”

“Yes!” Kai Yang replied straightforwardly.

Hu Mei Er’s charming face trembled, and she sneered: “You are nothing but a trial disciple in Sky Tower. Although my strength isn’t as high as yours, I am the Blood Group Head’s daughter. The fact that I can take a fancy to you is your good fortune, and yet you unexpectedly can’t see your own good fortune when it’s in front of you! Do you know how many men are outside having ideas about me?”

(TL: Yeah, at least two despicable ones.)

“Then, your royal highness can go find those men. Why is there any need to nag me?” Kai Yang indifferently replied.

“Kai Yang, don’t be shameless when other’s are giving you face! If I return and inform my father that I was humiliated here, even if you are a Sky Tower disciple, you still wouldn’t be able to see tomorrow’s sun.” Hu Mei Er hissed out as cutely as possible. Kai Yang’s attitude, had completely infuriated her, making her face hit rock bottom. After all, her status wasn’t low, how could she have suffered this type of humiliation before?

Kai Yang also coldly laughed: “I dare to ask your royal highness, if I were to kill you right here right now, will you have the opportunity to return and complain?”

Hu Mei Er looked distracted, her rage had made her forget that she was deep in Black Wind Forest, and if Kai Yang really attacked her, she definitely would have no hope of returning alive. Also this was the ideal place to murder someone. In other words, if she really died here, she would have died in vain.

When she thought about this, Hu Mei Er became alert, looking at Kai Yang she urgently retreated a few steps. A trill in her voice, she said: “You’re joking right?”

“There is a limit to my patience.” Kai Yang indifferently replied.

Hu Mei Er rigidly looked at him, her eyes containing her humiliation and fury, but she didn’t dare do anything. She wasn’t sure whether Kai Yang’s words were a joke or not.

While Hu Mei Er was in confusion, Kai Yang suddenly became vigilant and looked over in a certain direction.

Intentionally or not, Kai Yang moved in front of Hu Mei Er. Looking at a large tree he said: “Come out!”

Hu Mei Er was surprised, but the next moment she understood what was going on.

Two people suddenly came out from behind the tree, and walked over while smilingly coldly. Their laughs were sinisters and strange, one looked at Kai Yang without rest and the other at Hu Mei Er.

(TL: Reveal! Ah, Cheng Shao Feng fancies Kai Yang!)

“Cheng Shao Feng, Nu Tao?” Hu Mei Er clearly recognised them, and cried out their names in suspicion, but in a blink of an eye, she knew the reason why these two people showed themselves here.

This time, it looked like Kai Yang was in some real danger.

Being stared at unrestrainedly by Nu Tao’s obscene gaze, caused Hu Mei Er’s entire body to feel uncomfortable, and she creased her eyebrows, she moved to further hide behind Kai Yang’s body.

“Elder sister Mei Er, come over here. We only want that guy’s life, move to the side, so you don’t accidently get injured!” Cheng Shao Feng called out from about five to ten feet in front of Kai Yang, as he warned her he slowly drew the sabre hanging at his side.

Nu Tao also spoke up, laughing he said: “That’s right, if you were to get injured, my heart would ache.”
