Chapter 5937: Spirit Religion’s Reinforcements

Yang Kai dashed forward relentlessly, determined to capture the Earth Chapter Master; however, he was intercepted by a group of Black Ink Cult members mid-way, forcing him to deal with them first. And by the time he was done, the Earth Chapter Master had already vanished into thin air, leaving him with no choice but to backtrack.

Zuo Wu You was still there, having fought against some Earth Chapter members during Yang Kai’s battle with the Earth Chapter Master. He now appeared worn out, his body slumped against a pile of rubble, his breath ragged, and his body covered in blood.

“Where’s Xue Ji?” Yang Kai glanced around but saw no trace of the seductive woman.

“She escaped when you went after the Earth Chapter Master,” Zuo Wu You replied.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and said, “Never mind, she won’t live much longer anyway.”

To think that the Night Chapter Master dared to covet a Divine Dragon’s blood, she was bound to die by her own hand, so Yang Kai had no interest in tracking her down either.

“Can you still move?” Yang Kai asked Zuo Wu You.

Zuo Wu You replied, “Please, Holy Son, go ahead first.” Then, he pointed in a certain direction and continued, “When you see a large city with tall walls, that would be Dawn City.”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although Yang Kai had demonstrated formidable Sword Secret Techniques and great physical strength, he was still True Element Boundary. Zuo Wu You had not expected him to turn the tables against the joint attack of two of the Black Ink Cult’s top combatants. 

It was a victory across realms, a miracle that had never been achieved before.

With a Holy Son of such strength, it was best for him to travel to Dawn City alone as Zuo Wu You didn’t want to be a burden to him.

Yang Kai understood his intention with just a moment’s thought. He walked over to help Zuo Wu You up and said, “My sense of direction has always been poor. I will need your guidance along the way.”

Zuo Wu You was about to say something more when Yang Kai interrupted, “The Night Chapter and Earth Chapter have failed consecutively. The Black Ink Cult won’t be able to spare any more forces to pursue us in the short term; therefore, the road ahead should not be too dangerous.”

Zuo Wu You thought for a moment before feeling it was reasonable. Although the Black Ink Cult was a mighty army with the finest weapons and the Eight Chapters’ heritage was magnificent, the sudden emergence of a Holy Son who was not previously known made it difficult for Black Ink Cult to prepare appropriately. The fact that they could mobilise so many Night Chapter and Earth Chapter cultists, even having the personal presence of the two Chapter Masters, was already the limit of what Black Ink Cult could do in the short term.

Now that the two Chapter Masters had been defeated, and many of their troops were either killed or injured, they were unlikely to have the strength to cause any more trouble.

Finally gaining a sense of relief, Zuo Wu You said, “Then I will travel with you, Holy Son.”

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded and enveloped him with his power before flying off.

…..

In the depths of a damp and dark underground cavern, within a natural cave, the sound of agonising screams echoed through a cluster of crimson mist, as if someone was enduring unbearable torture. 

The mist contorted and expanded randomly, desperately trying to take on a humanoid shape, but each time it did, it would explode uncontrollably, the screams growing louder with each cycle.

This scene repeated itself again and again, the mist becoming thinner and the screams gradually becoming less audible. Finally, at a certain moment, the thinning mist condensed once more into a graceful figure who curled up on the damp ground like a wounded rabbit. Her fair body was covered in dried-up blood, motionless, like she was devoid of vitality.

However, after a while, the owner of that body suddenly took in a deep breath as if her Soul had returned. When she opened her eyes, they were filled with a look of horror.

“Such power…” she whispered softly, almost inaudible.

Madness then overtook her as she murmured it several times, her voice gradually becoming more resounding, “…brings me such joy!”

Trembling with excitement, her eyes became filled with anticipation and glee.

She forced herself to stand up despite her weakened body and retrieved a blood-red robe from her Space Ring. After putting it on and restoring herself for a moment, she turned into a bloody mist and vanished into the dark underground.

Moments later, she reappeared on the previous battlefield, searching earnestly among the pieces of broken limbs and flesh. Finally, she made a discovery which caused her to turn ecstatic. Then, she activated her Blood Secret Technique, sending a burst of scarlet mist deep into the ground. Later when she retrieved it again, the mist glimmered with a golden light.

She merged it into her body and immediately felt the terrifying power expanding within her body, causing her expression to contort and a mournful cry to erupt, frightening countless beasts and birds in the nearby wilderness.

…..

“Zuo Wu You, is this the Holy Son you spoke of?” Outside a small town, a group of people blocked the way of Yang Kai and Zuo Wu You.

The leader, an Immortal Ascension Boundary Master, looked at Yang Kai from top to bottom and asked.

Zuo Wu You cupped his fists, replying, “Senior Chu, when the Holy Son descended, he fulfilled the prophecy passed down by the Spirit Religion, there is no mistake!”

The cultivator surnamed Chu nodded, “The Spirit Religion’s prophecy has been circulating for countless years. In the past, there have been several instances of suspected Holy Sons, but they were all proven to be misunderstandings or the schemes of people with ulterior motives.”

Zuo Wu You was suddenly confused by his words as he asked, “Sir, there have been several Holy Sons in the past?” Though he possessed quite a high status in the Spirit Religion, he was only in the True Element Boundary, so he wasn’t qualified enough to know about some top secrets.

The Master surnamed Chu nodded, “As I said, the prophecy of the Spirit Religion has been passed down for countless years, and the Black Ink Cult is also aware of it. They had previously attempted to use this method to infiltrate us.”

Upon hearing that, Zuo Wu You became anxious, “Sir, this Holy Son is definitely not a member of the Black Ink Cult.” He had seen how the Holy Son had fought with the Black Ink Cult’s two Chapter Masters and how he had killed those Black Ink Cultists along the way. How could such a person be a spy sent by the Black Ink Cult?

The Master surnamed Chu raised his hand to stop him, “Your loyalty to the Spirit Religion is clear to me, but the matter of the Holy Son still needs to be decided by the many Order Lords. We only need to do our part, understand?”

Zuo Wu You pursed his lips, “I understand.”

The Immortal Ascension Boundary cultivator finally looked at Yang Kai and introduced himself, “Old Master Chu An He, how should we address this young friend?”

Yang Kai smiled and bowed respectfully, “Yang Kai.”

He couldn’t help but find the old man interesting. By saying all of those to Zuo Wu You in front of him, Chu An He was clearly warning Yang Kai, but he understood that it was a necessary action, so he held no grudges.

Besides, Yang Kai was never really concerned about his status as the Holy Son, it was only Zuo Wu You and his comrades who persistently addressed him as so throughout their journey. All he wanted was to go to Dawn City and meet the Saintess of the Light Spirit Religion to verify his suspicions.

Only one thing puzzled him.

After his identity as the Holy Son was exposed, the Black Ink Cult swiftly organised three high-level attacks, but there had been no response from the Light Spirit Religion. Zuo Wu You had sent a message ahead when they were getting the carriage at a small town a while back, so logically, whether or not his identity as the Holy Son was real, the Light Spirit Religion should have given him enough attention and quickly arranged for people to assist them. But in fact, it had already been four days since Yang Kai and Zuo Wu You began their trek.

After another one or two days, the two would have arrived at Dawn City on their own.

It wasn’t until now that the Light Spirit Religion finally dispatched a group of people to meet them.

In terms of efficiency, the Light Spirit Religion was far worse than the Black Ink Cult. Their attitude towards Yang Kai, as the Holy Son, were also completely different.

“I shall address you as such, then,” Chu An He showed a warm smile, “After Zuo Wu You’s message was received, the Spirit Religion made the corresponding arrangements and deployment. There are enough people ahead to receive you. Follow me. The Saintess and the Order Lords are already waiting in the Holy City.”

The Black Ink Cult had Eight Chapters: the Heaven, Earth, Profound, Dawn, Night, Space, Flood and Barren Chapters.

Likewise, the Light Spirit Religion also had Eight Orders: Heaven, Earth, Thunder, Wind, Fire, Water, Mountain, and Lake Valley Orders.

The Eight Chapter Masters and Eight Order Lords were the most powerful Masters in the World.

“Good,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Follow me this way,” Chu An He beckoned, walking with Yang Kai towards the small town ahead.

“You must have encountered many hardships on your way here, little friend,” Chu An He said with a smile, “Seeing how dusty and tired you look, you must have been attacked by the Black Ink Cult?”

Yang Kai replied with a smile, “En, but it was just a bunch of small fry that Brother Zuo and I easily took care of.”

Behind them, Zuo Wu You couldn’t help but glance at Yang Kai with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

“So that’s how it is!” Chu An He also smiled, “The Black Ink Cult has always been vile and treacherous. If you encounter them again in the future, don’t underestimate them.”

“Of course,” Yang Kai replied casually.

As they walked and chatted, the group soon entered the small town and Yang Kai looked around and asked in curiosity, “Why is this place so desolate? I don’t see anyone around.”

“It’s a matter about the Holy Son… well, though it hasn’t been confirmed, it’s better to be cautious. So, before your arrival, this Old Master cleared out all the people in the town, lest they give Black Ink Cultists an opportunity.”

Yang Kai praised, “Sir Chu’s actions are quite thorough.”

Saying so, he suddenly stopped and turned around, reaching out to grab Zuo Wu You’s shoulder while smiling, “Brother Zuo, you must learn from Sir Chu.”

Zuo Wu You was in a daze at the sudden instruction. Though he felt something was off during their journey, he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. When Yang Kai pulled him over, he instinctively nodded and said, “As the Holy Son instructs.”

Chu An He, on the other hand, stroked his beard and smiled without saying a word.

The group passed a corner of the small town.

Suddenly, Zuo Wu You froze in place and looked around, “Senior Chu?”

Yang Kai stood beside him with a smile.

“Be careful, Holy Son!” Zuo Wu You was suddenly as nervous as a startled rabbit, pulling out his sword to guard Yang Kai in front of him.

Because at the moment they turned the corner, Chu An He and the others who had been travelling with them disappeared without a trace, leaving only the two of them.

There were obvious traces of a Spirit Array being activated all around them!

In other words, they had fallen into a trap. No one knew when it was set up or what kind of mystery it held.

But entering such an Array recklessly would surely bring about great danger.
