Run! They had to run now or it would be too late!

Just when the yellow-faced youth and the middle-aged scholar thought this, Yang Kai turned his head and coldly glared at them.

Both of them suddenly gasped. Under Yang Kai’s cold and frigid gaze, their limbs went limp and they couldn’t summon the slightest bit of their strength.

“Are you going to kill yourselves or do I need to come over and do it myself?” Yang Kai stood holding his sword in a nonchalant and relaxed manner. His clothes were neat and tidy still, as if the previous battle hadn’t cost him anything.

This gave the impression that Feng Xi was the Dao Source Realm, whereas he was in the high and mighty Emperor Realm. This contrasting scene was completely out of their imagination and they couldn’t accept it.

Monster! The yellow-faced youth and the middle-aged scholar grit their teeth hard as they continued to rattle, unable to speak a word in horror.

“I guess you are choosing the latter,” Yang Kai coldly snorted as he moved towards the pair.

The yellow-faced youth and the middle-aged scholar suddenly stopped breathing. They wanted to escape but their bodies weren’t listening to them. A sense of despair instantly drowned them.

However, the next moment, Yang Kai frowned as he looked towards a certain direction.

The next thing that entered his sight caused his eyes to bulge in shock.

Because Feng Xi, who was supposed to be floating there limply, waiting for his death, slowly stood up at this moment. However, his state seemed extremely strange, as if he did not have his own consciousness, his eyes shut tight and his movements stiff, like a puppet.

Also, the Emperor Qi in his body was circulating madly while an aura that left Yang Kai shivering seemed to slowly be awakening from Feng Xi.

Very soon, Feng Xi stood up straight again and his eyes flashed open.

Those eyes were filled with frigid-cold chill, but also shone brightly like stars.

Yang Kai was taken aback!

The moment Feng Xi opened his eyes, that strange aura coming from his body soared and a powerful Emperor Pressure suddenly broke out from him, causing Yang Kai’s breath to stagnate for a moment and his blood to stop flowing smoothly.

“What happened?” Yang Kai frowned as he muttered. At this moment, Feng Xi gave him an extremely dangerous feeling, and when they met eyes, Yang Kai actually had the illusion of being stared at by an ominous beast. It was very uncomfortable.

Feng Xi had undergone an earth-shaking change. His previous Young Sect Master’s bearing was nowhere to be found, rather a graceful and noble temperament had replaced it. Also, his eyes were filled with disdain for everyone, as if he was the ruler of the world.

Yang Kai’s heart pounded crazily as he found this feeling a little familiar. He had felt something similar from Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters like Yao Chang Jun, Chi Ri, and Bing Yun.

However, Feng Xi had just advanced to the Emperor Realm, so how could he stand shoulder to shoulder with such peak level Masters? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

[Is this one of Seeking Passion Sect’s Forbidden Techniques?] Yang Kai was filled with doubt as he fiercely swung his hands, releasing two Moon Blades that formed a cross-shaped cut that flew towards Feng Xi. This cross reached Feng Xi in the blink of an eye, leaving no time for him to dodge.

Looking at the cross-shaped Moon Blade, Feng Xi’s eyes glimmered with surprise, as if he was seeing Yang Kai using his Space Divine Ability for the first time, but the calm and composed look on his face never changed, nor did he show any intention of dodging. Rather he just slowly pointed his finger.

This finger poke struck right at the centre of the cross, without the slightest bit of deviation.

Immediately, the two Moon Blades collapsed under the might of this finger while Feng Xi hadn’t suffered the slightest bit of damage.

“What!?” Yang Kai was shocked. He was naturally clearer than anyone else about the weakness of the Secret Technique he had just displayed. Although this was the first time he had used this cross-shaped Moon Blade, he had simulated it countless times in his mind, so the effect it displayed should have been extraordinary nonetheless.

As for the weakness of this Secret Technique, it was exactly where Feng Xi had poked.

How did he see through it though? Yang Kai’s face was filled with uncertainty.

If Feng Xi had such insight and ability, why had he been beaten so badly just now? Some earth-shattering change must have happened to him in that short period when he was unconscious and woke up.

“Who is Your Excellency?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled a certain Secret Technique and his heart skipped a beat as he asked with a shout.

‘Feng Xi’ coldly gazed at Yang Kai and replied lightly, “Junior, you are really something. This Old Master thought that you were simply extraordinary, but now it seems that this Old Master’s vision still fell somewhat short.”

“Sii…” Yang Kai gasped in horror as he involuntarily retreated a few steps.

Feng Xi’s sudden way of taking pride in his seniority confirmed Yang Kai’s guess even more so.

He nervously gulped before muttering, “Soul Descent! You’re Feng Xuan!”

Yang Kai had long heard some top Masters would leave a wisp of their Spiritual Energy on their heirs or Disciples in order to protect them should they encounter life-threatening danger. Normally this technique wouldn’t be triggered, but in the moment of a life or death crisis, this wisp of Spiritual Energy could be used to create a Soul connection and possession, allowing the Master to confront the danger in their descendant’s stead.

However, the price for using this Secret Technique was very high. Once it was used, the damage to their heir or Disciple wouldn’t be small, so few Masters were willing to do this. Even for those who did use this technique, it was a measure of absolute last resort only.

But now, this technique had appeared in Feng Xi, which meant that Feng Xi was at the edge of death.

“Little brat, you’re pretty knowledgeable. It is this King indeed!” Feng Xi shouted.

“What!?”

“Sect Master!?”

The yellow-faced man and the middle-aged scholar were also taken aback, but soon, the two became ecstatic and immediately rushed to Feng Xi’s side and knelt down, tremblingly greeting, “Disciple greets Sect Master!”

Feng Xuan indifferently glanced at the two before reprimanding them with a cold snort, “Two wastes who can’t even protect their Young Sect Master, forcing this King to appear in person. What use are you!”

The expressions of the two drastically changed, but they didn’t dare to give any excuses.

In their minds, however, they were thinking, [Young Sect Master is already an Emperor Realm Master, far stronger than us, yet he was still so severely injured and fell unconscious after just two to three moves from this Yang Kai, what were we supposed to have done? Wouldn’t we have been killed with just one finger flick?]

Although they were cursing to themselves, the two of them didn’t dare to really say what they were thinking, simply lowering their heads as cold sweat dripped down their faces.

Feng Xi ordered with a snort, “Take your Young Sect Master to a safe place to heal once this is over. If you can’t even bring your Young Sect Master back to the Sect safe and sound, don’t bother returning at all.”

Since the two could enter the Shattered Star Sea, they were undoubtedly elite disciples of the Seeking Passion Sect, but in Feng Xuan’s eyes, they weren’t worth even a single strand of his son’s hair.

And judging by Feng Xuan’s tone, it was obvious that Yang Kai would very soon be dealt with.

The two disciples quickly nodded, as if they were given amnesty, “Yes, Sect Master!”

Feng Xi turned his head to look at Yang Kai again, letting out a cold snort and asking, “Junior, are Xi’er injuries your handiwork?”

Yang Kai replied with a dull face, “If I said no, would you believe me?”

Feng Xi countered, “What do you think?”

Yang Kai angrily rebuked, “Then why bother asking?”

Feng Xi’s face sank as he stated, “Junior, you’re quite bold to even dare to yell at this King! I wanted to give you a quick and painless death, but since you are so arrogant, don’t blame this King for being impolite!”

Yang Kai flashed a mocking smile as he quipped, “Feng Xi also said this before, but he was beaten black and blue by this Young Master. Sect Master Feng, be careful, or you might follow your son’s footsteps!”

Feng Xi frowned, “You dare to look down on this King?”

Yang Kai lazily stated, “If Sect Master Feng was here in person, Junior would naturally not be your opponent and would immediately flee as far as possible, but… Sect Master Feng, you have borrowed your son’s body to manifest your Soul, so just how much of your strength can you display?”

“Enough to take your life!”

Yang Kai broke into laughter, “How willful! Sect Master Feng, be careful not to lose all your face today!”

“Silence!” Feng Xi angrily shouted, “This King will take your dog life, Seeking Passion Finger!”

While shouting, he pointed towards Yang Kai’s location.

An unimaginable force suddenly shot out. This force was completely traceless and invisible, but it still seemed capable of tearing space apart wherever it passed, a terrifying display of power.

This finger thrust wasn’t as powerful as the Emperor Authority Bead that Feng Xi had used before, but it wasn’t significantly weaker either.

The reason why it wasn’t comparable wasn’t because Feng Xuan’s strength had declined over the years. When he had refined that Emperor Authority Bead, Feng Xuan had just broken through to the Third-Order Emperor Realm. After so many years, his cultivation had definitely made great progress.

If he really performed this Secret Technique in person, its might would be far greater.

But at this moment, he had used a Soul Descent, so the strength he could exert depended entirely on what Feng Xi’s body could withstand.

Therefore, the might of this Seeking Passion Finger had greatly reduced.

Nevertheless, it was still not something Yang Kai wanted to take head-on.

He hurriedly tried to teleport, but the might of this finger had actually disrupted the local space, causing Yang Kai to stagger and get hit.

Yang Kai felt like he had been struck by a mountain and he groaned as he spurted a mouthful of blood and flew out. All of his bones creaked while many of them broke. His body was torn and battered, bleeding all over.

Yang Kai was injured with just one move, proving just how amazing Feng Xuan’s strength was.

Before he could regain his footing, Feng Xuan swung the sword in his hand, shouting, “Seeking Passion Sword!”

The fan-shaped peerless Sword Wave crossed a distance of over a thousand meters in the blink of an eye, reaching Yang Kai.

Yang Kai couldn’t dodge again.

The yellow-faced young man and the middle-aged scholar couldn’t help but rejoice at the sight of this. They were excited about their Sect Master’s strength. No matter how strong Yang Kai was, he was still completely vulnerable before their Sect Master’s Soul Descent.

After the last attack, Feng Xi’s body’s aura declined greatly. It seemed Feng Xuan had paid a great price to unleash these two moves and was now slightly panting for breath.

But this was sufficient. Feng Xuan was confident that Yang Kai couldn’t handle these moves with only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm’s strength and would soon be split asunder.

Feng Xuan put away his sword and stood straight, coldly looking ahead, waiting for the moment when Yang Kai died.
