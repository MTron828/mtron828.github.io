All of them were shocked when they saw the Dragon Island Token. The hundreds of cultivators had been living in Half-Dragon City for a long time, so they were familiar with the Dragon Island Token. However, they had only heard about it, and it was the first time they saw the real thing. At that instant, all of them shifted their attention to the Dragon Island Token and stared fixedly at it.

Fu Chi scoffed, “How can you take out a random token and claim that it’s the Dragon Island Token? Do you think that the Dragon Clan is made up of a bunch of fools?”

He decided to mock Yang Kai because he was resentful of him.

Nevertheless, Yang Kai looked at him as though the latter was an idiot, “The Great Elder has already said that this is the Dragon Island Token. Do you think you have a sharper vision than him? Or do you think he is lying?”

Fu Chi was startled as his expression darkened, “Boy, don’t slander me!”

Although he was an Eighth-Order Thunder Dragon, he wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences if he was regarded as not believing in the Great Elder. Therefore, he hurriedly turned to Zhu Yan and rectified, “Great Elder, that’s not what I meant.”

Zhu Yan waved his hand and gazed at Yang Kai, “Although I can see that the aura on this Dragon Island Token is pure, it requires further inspection to determine whether it’s the real Dragon Island Token. Would it be convenient for you to let me have a look?”

Yang Kai took a look at Zhu Qing, and upon getting a nod from her, he replied with a smile, “Please inspect it at will, Great Elder.”

After that, he tossed the Dragon Island Token to the Great Elder.

Upon catching the token, the Great Elder performed a hand seal and pointed at the token with one finger. Instantly, the Dragon carved on the token started moving and roared loudly.

The Fourth Elder, Zhu Kong, nodded, “En, it’s a real Dragon Island Token.”

In fact, the Elders were certain that it was the real thing when they first saw the token; however, since this was an important item, they had to examine it as well.

With a faint smile, Yang Kai uttered, “I heard that the Dragon Island Token’s holder can make a request of Dragon Island…”

Just then, his expression changed as he spoke angrily, “What are you doing?”

While he was speaking, the Second Elder suddenly extended her hand towards the Dragon Island Token in the Great Elder’s hand. Her movement was so swift that her hand transformed into an illusion as it tried to grab the Dragon Island Token.

The Great Elder had never expected that Fu Zhun would make a move, so he hurriedly twisted his wrist to evade it; however, the Second Elder was well prepared as her hand pursued the token.

The Dragon Clan’s two Elders remained in the same spots, but their hands transformed into countless illusions as they battled with each other in silence. After a loud thud, the atmosphere fell into silence again.

While Zhu Yan frowned, Fu Zhun remained dispassionate. Zhu Kong took a look at both Elders and heaved a sigh.

Right in front of everyone’s eyes, the Dragon Island Token in the Great Elder’s hand decomposed into a pile of dust as it trickled down his fingers and disappeared completely.

“Second Elder, what do you mean by this?” With a grim expression, Yang Kai stared at Fu Zhun as he clenched his teeth. He had never expected that she would destroy his Dragon Island Token right in front of so many people, which was the epitome of shamelessness. It was beyond his imagination that a Master, who was as powerful as a Great Emperor, would do such a thing in full view of the public.

Earlier, Yang Kai was already distrustful of this ice woman, which was why he only passed the Dragon Island Token to the Great Elder after getting Zhu Qing’s advice. Nevertheless, what happened just now was beyond his expectations.

Zhu Yan turned to look at Fu Zhun, awaiting her explanation.

Fu Zhun uttered unenthusiastically, “I don’t need to explain my actions to you. Since the Great Elder and the Fourth Elder believe that it’s the Dragon Island Token, I won’t deny it. I’ll just regard it as the Dragon Island Token, then.”

“You’ll just regard it as the Dragon Island Token?” The veins on Yang Kai’s forehead popped. [She’s basically lying in front of so many people. How can she deny my Dragon Island Token’s authenticity just like this?]

Fu Zhun wanted to shift the focus away from the issue, so she said coldly, “You’ve entered Dragon Island without the Dragon Clan’s permission; that’s your first crime. You’ve made a scene on the Dragon Clan’s wedding day; that’s your second crime. You’ve ruined a Dragon girl’s reputation; that’s your third crime. For these crimes, you should be killed three times over; however, I won’t kill you today. In exchange for the Dragon Island Token, you can keep your life, now leave!”

Unresigned, Yang Kai refuted, “I’ve never said that I want to trade that Dragon Island Token for my life. Second Elder, don’t you think you’re acting too despotic?”

He was truly infuriated by her actions. He had just fished out the Dragon Island Token and had yet to make a request, but this woman destroyed the token and said that it would be exchanged for his life. Even robbers wouldn’t do such a thing.

“If you don’t want it to be traded for your life, do you want to go to Hell then?”

Yang Kai raised his head and demanded, “I want you to release Qing’er and let her leave with me!”

“Dream on!” Fu Zhun sneered.

In a disappointed manner, Zhu Qing uttered, “Second Elder, according to the Dragon Clan’s rules, anyone holding a Dragon Island Token can make a reasonable request and have it fulfilled by the Dragon Clan. Although you’re the Second Elder, it doesn’t mean you can ignore our ancestors’ teachings!”

Yang Kai turned his head and shot a glare at Zhu Yan, “Great Elder, I need to hear your opinion.”

It was impossible to communicate with Fu Zhun. She was as obstinate as an eternally frozen ice block, so it was useless to try persuading her. Yang Kai would only get more exasperated if he kept speaking to her, which was why he shifted his attention to Zhu Yan.

Since the Dragon Island Token was destroyed right in his hand, he couldn’t evade the responsibility.

Hearing that, Zhu Yan nodded his head, “You’re right. There is such a rule in the Dragon Clan.”

With his gaze turning hopeful, Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, “Since that’s the case, I only have one request. I hope that you’ll forgive us and let Qing’er leave with me.”

After a moment of silence, Zhu Yan shook his head and replied, “I’m afraid I cannot agree to it.”

“Great Elder…” The light in Zhu Qing’s gaze went out. Without the Great Elder on their side, she and Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to leave this place.

Yang Kai sneered, “The Dragon Clan is indeed very mighty and honourable. Many thanks for opening my eyes today.”

The Great Elder shook his head and uttered, “It’s not that I’m making things difficult for you; it’s just that… Your request goes against the Dragon Clan’s principles, so I can’t agree to it. The Second Elder is right. You have a Dragon Island Token, so I’m supposed to grant your wish, but that request has to be reasonable! Allowing you to take Zhu Qing away is beyond what the Dragon Clan can tolerate, so you’d best leave on your own.”

The Great Elder’s statement was within Yang Kai’s expectation, so he wasn’t really disappointed.

Some time ago, he had asked Zhu Lie whether he could trade the Dragon Island Token for Zhu Qing’s freedom, but Zhu Lie had refuted his idea. The reason he even took out the Dragon Island Token today was to try his luck.

It seemed that Zhu Lie was right. Although he had a Dragon Island Token, Yang Kai couldn’t leave this place with Zhu Qing. It was impossible for the Dragon Clan to agree to such a request.

Just then, Zhu Kong said, “That’s right. You’d best leave now. We won’t stop you.”

Given the Dragon Clan members’ temperament, they would have directly killed any person who dared to make a scene like this. However, Yang Kai indeed possessed a Dragon Island Token, so no matter how rude he had been, the token was enough to be traded for his life. The prerequisite was that Yang Kai would just leave immediately.

“Huh?” The Second Elder suddenly snorted, “Did I say I’d let him go?”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched when he heard that, and he scoffed, “So, you want to go back on your word and kill me. Alright, then. I’ll just fight with you. Since you’re making life difficult for me, I also won’t let the Dragon Clan live peacefully.”

“How conceited!” Fu Chi snorted.

The expressions of the other Dragon Clan members darkened as well. Obviously, Yang Kai had enraged all of them. They were already displeased at the fact that he had the guts to snatch the Dragon Clan’s bride, and now he was trying to threaten them in their own home. To the Dragon Clan, Yang Kai didn’t understand how outmatched he was.

“You’ll see if I have the ability to act conceited or not!” Yang Kai shot a look at Fu Chi, who he had decided to attack first if they really got into a fight.

Yang Kai had to vent out the anger he had accumulated over the past month.

[How dare this fool try to snatch my woman!]

“Second Elder…” Zhu Yan looked at Fu Zhun with a frown, “As members of the Dragon Clan, we are not supposed to go back on our word. What is your meaning here?”

Since the Dragon Island Token had been destroyed, it wouldn’t matter if they let Yang Kai go. Therefore, he didn’t understand why Fu Zhun went back on her word.

“Of course I won’t go back on my word.” Fu Zhun looked coldly at Yang Kai, “I’ve promised not to kill him, but I’ve never said that I’ll let him leave. If he doesn’t give the Ancestral Dragon Source to us, he shouldn’t even think about leaving Dragon Island!”

Hearing that, Zhu Yan and Zhu Kong turned solemn, as they understood what Fu Zhun was trying to achieve.

Yang Kai possessed Ancestral Dragon Source, and since he had come to Dragon Island himself, they certainly couldn’t let him go easily. The Ancestral Dragon Source was important to the Dragon Clan. If they could get their hands on it, the entire Dragon Clan’s power would increase dramatically.

Previously, Zhu Yan wanted Zhu Qing to invite Yang Kai to Dragon Island exactly because he wanted to obtain Ancestral Dragon Source. That was why when he realized the Second Elder’s intention, he stopped refuting her.

As far as he knew, Yang Kai had extremely high attainments in the Dao of Space, so if they let him go on this day, they might never be able to capture him again. After weighing the options, Zhu Yan decided to keep his mouth shut.

“Second Elder, don’t cross the line!” Zhu Qing was so furious that she started trembling.

“How dare you talk to me like this!” Fu Zhun glared at her.

“Shut your mouth!” Yang Kai shouted back at Fu Zhun with an even more ferocious glare, “So what if Qing’er talks to you like this?”

“Brat, you’ve gone too far! Since you desperately want to die, I’ll grant your wish!” Fu Zhun had never been insulted in such a way before, so she couldn’t contain her fury anymore and pushed out her palm at Yang Kai.

Instantly, her hand turned into an ice crystal as though it had been carved by the great sculptor. The formidable coldness transformed into a swirling current that engulfed Yang Kai.

Her palm magnified rapidly right in front of Yang Kai’s eyes, as though it could block out the entire sky.

Yang Kai snarled, “It is the Dragon Clan who is domineering and oppressive today, not I!” As he spoke, he pushed Zhu Qing away and, right in front of all the astounded people, he actually charged towards the Second Elder instead of retreating.

“Hou!!”

As soon as a roar was heard, Yang Kai swelled up and transformed into an 80-metre long gigantic creature. Stubby horns protruded on his temples, and his entire body was covered in scales. His flesh squirmed as his bones kept cracking. His hands had also turned into pointed Dragon Claws.

As a peerless Dragon Pressure spread out, Yang Kai puffed out scorching breath from his nostrils. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Dragon Transformation Secret Art!” While the crowd broke into a commotion, the Dragon Clan members were dumbfounded.

The Dragon Transformation Secret Art was a legitimate Dragon Clan Secret Technique, so they were familiar with it. However, it was the first time they saw someone use it in such a domineering way.

Yang Kai had transformed into an 80-metre long beast, and while he could still only be considered a Half-Dragon in that form, the pressure he gave off was intense. Moreover, his Dragon Aura was extremely pure.
