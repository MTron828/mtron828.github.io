Upon figuring out the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon’s secret, Yang Kai darted his gaze around while continuing to lie in the same position. As he never activated his power, the fog around him remained calm. Next, he examined his body and couldn’t help feeling sorry for himself.

In summary, his condition was terrible.

Before he was hunted down by this sheep headed Royal Lord, he was already badly injured; then, during the pursuit, he was repeatedly struck by this Royal Lord and his injuries exacerbated after he entered this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon.

His five viscera and six organs were a mess as they all nearly ruptured exploded. About 70% of his bones were broken and there were even sharp bones stuck out from his flesh here and there.

Half of his Dragon Scales, which were originally hidden under his skin, were gone. If he transformed into his Dragon Form now, he would be half-naked.

Fortunately, despite his serious injuries, he wasn’t at risk of losing his life. Coupled with his own restorative power and his potent Dragon Vein, he was actually on the mend.

He stealthily stuffed some Spirit Pills into his mouth and took a glance at the Royal Lord, only to see that the other party was still engaged in an intense fight. Amazing Divine Abilities and Secret Techniques were cast from the Royal Lord’s hands as he his fight against the fog seemed to have turned the entire universe upside down.

[That guy is really dumb!] Yang Kai was gleeful; however, it wasn’t until he blacked out twice that he realised the secret behind the fog. The Royal Lord still hadn’t passed out after persevering for such a long time, so it wasn’t surprising that he hadn’t discovered the truth yet.

Anyone who fell into danger would instinctively counterattack to save themselves. Who would have thought that in this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon, doing nothing was the best way to protect oneself? The more one attacked, the more perilous their situation became.

[Maybe he’ll exhaust himself to death!] Yang Kai hoped.

However, his wish wasn’t to be granted. Just like what happened to him previously, the Royal Lord was unable to fend off the pressure despite going all out. He kept roaring and releasing his Black Ink Strength until he had no more energy left and finally passed out several days later.

As soon as he became unmoving and all the noise in the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon died down.

Staring at the unmoving Royal Lord, Yang Kai knew that the other party wasn’t dead, so he was naturally disappointed. Nevertheless, he soon pulled himself together and gazed fervently at the Royal Lord. His eyes were filled with murderous intent.

[Since this guy is unconscious and exhausted, maybe I can kill him now!] As soon as Yang Kai began gathering his power though, he realised he felt the pressure coming from the fog again. The more he exerted himself, the more powerful the pressure became.

Soon, he released his power, as he realised his idea wasn’t feasible. The Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon was extremely sensitive to any foreign power. Before Yang Kai could gather the necessary strength to kill the Royal Lord, he would pass out again.

Left with no choice, he could only gather his World Force on his palms and test the response from the fog. He tried to adjust his energy fluctuations to reach a kind of balance. Then, he slowly wriggled his arms as though he was swimming towards the sheep headed Royal Lord.

However, Yang Kai found himself to be outrageously slow. Two whole hours passed, but he only managed to cross half of the distance between them.

Another two hours later, Yang Kai arrived at a place that was 100 metres away from the Royal Lord. He slowly summoned his Azure Dragon Spear and pointed it at the Royal Lord’s neck. Then, he squirmed and stealthily inched closer to him.

Watching as the Azure Dragon Spear was about to stab into the opponent’s neck, Yang Kai felt his heart thumping in his chest. Perhaps the Royal Lord was shocked by the murderous intent or he indeed had an incredible restorative power, but he opened his eyes all of a sudden.

Black blood spattered as the razor-sharp Azure Dragon Spear was even able to penetrate a Royal Lord’s robust body. His spear jabbed right into the opponent’s throat and was about to stick out from the other side, but just then, the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon launched a counterattack.

Instantly, Yang Kai felt immense pressure coming at him. His wounds split open, and as he faced enormous resistance, unable to extend his spear one bit.

He couldn’t help but curse.

As a sharp pain shot through him, the Royal Lord came to his senses and turned his head, only to see Yang Kai stabbing a weapon into his throat.

[This brat is still alive!?] The Royal Lord was startled. When he saw Yang Kai looking battered and unmoving earlier, he thought he had died. To his surprise, not only had Yang Kai survived, but he had also seized this chance to try to kill him while he was unconscious.

If the Royal Lord hadn’t woken up in time, he very well might have lost his life. Enraged, the Royal Lord released his aura as his Black Ink Strength burst forth.

“Wai…” Before Yang Kai could even get a word out, his expression had darkened as the pressure coming from all directions intensified many times, causing all the bones in his body to crack. He couldn’t help but spray out a mouthful of blood, and following that, he blacked out and lost consciousness.

The Royal Lord extended his hand in an attempt to kill him, but his hand was forced to stop just a metre away from Yang Kai, and he was unable to push it any further.

His expression changed. Ignoring Yang Kai, he surged his power in an attempt to shake off the restrictive force; however, the force became so immense that he soon fell into a state of despair. Three breaths later, his eyes rolled back into his head and he too passed out.

Without the disturbance of foreign powers, the fog soon calmed down.

When Yang Kai awakened, he saw the Royal Lord hovering somewhere near him. This guy had passed out, but his hand still remained stretched out towards Yang Kai. Seeing that, Yang Kai knew what the other party intended to do after he blacked out.

After hesitating for a bit, he gave up on the idea of killing this Royal Lord.

The Royal Lord indeed looked like he was powerless to resist now, but based on the previous experience, Yang Kai believed that the Royal Lord would regain consciousness the moment he made a move against him.

A Royal Lord’s sense for danger was extreme, so any external threat would undoubtedly wake him up. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Moreover, the reflective power in this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon was savage. Yang Kai had to activate his power if he wanted to kill the Royal Lord, but if he did that, he would be the one who would suffer. Before he even managed to kill the Royal Lord, he would pass out upon getting squeezed by the pressure.

In this damned place, neither one of them could kill the other. In that case, Yang Kai reckoned that his best option for now was to flee.

Since the Royal Lord was still unconscious, he had to try to leave the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon. Perhaps he could return to the battlefield and join the war again. Making use of his previous experience, Yang Kai carefully activated his power and infused energy into his hands. Then, he flailed about as he awkwardly swam away from the Royal Lord.

Half a day later, the Royal Lord also regained consciousness. This time, he didn’t immediately make a move; instead, he remained still and fell into his thoughts.

It wasn’t until Yang Kai blacked out twice that he found out the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon’s secret. Since the Royal Lord was not a fool, he certainly could do the same.

If there was really an invisible enemy in this fog, the two of them would have died after falling unconscious. Since he and the Human brat were still alive, something was obviously off.

A moment later, the Royal Lord also figured out the secret behind this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon. As he scanned his surroundings, he soon spotted Yang Kai swimming away from him. After giving it some thought, he imitated Yang Kai and infused some of the power into his arms. Then, he started swimming in this fog.

Detecting something, Yang Kai turned his head and saw the Royal Lord running after him. He couldn’t help but curse, “You’re a stubborn one aren’t you!?”

The Royal Lord snorted as his eyes reflected Yang Kai’s figure. Slowly, he followed behind Yang Kai.

“Haa… even if we get into a life-and-death battle here, it won’t affect the war between the two Races. I’m just a Seventh-Order Human, so it’s pointless for you to kill me. Why don’t we bid each other farewell here? We’ll meet again if fate brings us together in the future.”

With a cold expression, the Royal Lord remained unfazed.

Yang Kai kept persuading him by saying, “You’re a Royal Lord, so what’s the point of you making things difficult for me? If you spare my life now, I’ll spare yours in the future. Who knows? We might even be friends.”

However, the Royal Lord remained silent.

“It’s not like you’ll be able to reach me, so stop wasting your time. I can see that you’re horribly injured, so why don’t you recuperate now to prevent your injuries from becoming worse?”

Seeing that the other party totally ignored him and refused to back down, Yang Kai grew incensed and said through clenched teeth, “Injured Black Ink Clansmen have to recuperate inside Black Ink Nests. You’re badly wounded now, so I guess you can only use half of your strength right now. On the other hand, I’m different. My wounds are healing quickly, and I’ll be energetic again in a few days. Chase after me all you like, when we leave this place, let’s see which one of us will die!”

When the Royal Lord heard that, his expression changed slightly.

Yang Kai had a point. The Royal Lord indeed needed a Black Ink Nest’s help to recuperate, and given how wounded he was, using half his strength would really be his maximum. He was already unable to capture Yang Kai when he was at the peak of his power, so now that he only had half of his strength left, he probably wouldn’t have a way to deal with this tricky opponent.

Nevertheless, he was still a Royal Lord. He had personally made a move against a single Seventh-Order boy, yet after such a long time, he was the one who ended up in a horrible state. He was simply unresigned.

As for Yang Kai’s threat, that didn’t bother him one bit. Even though he was only left with half of his power, that was still significantly more than a Seventh-Order Human could hope to handle. He could even deal with an Eighth-Order Master with ease in his current state.

If Yang Kai had the guts to make a move on him, he would be the one who would suffer.

As the Royal Lord squinted his eyes, he said, “Pass me the last thing Cang gave you and I’ll leave.”

A helpless Yang Kai sighed, “Will you believe me if I say that old man never gave me anything? That was his way of diverting all your attention away from him so he could use that strange jade. It’s laughable that you all believe it to be true.”

The Royal Lord sneered while relentlessly pursuing him.

A frustrated Yang Kai roared, “It seems that you don’t believe me. Forget it! It’s not like there’s anything I can do about it. Just chase after me all you like.”

Without speaking further, he tried to control his power and strike a balance with the fog. As he waved his hands, he swam further away.

Somewhere behind him, the Royal Lord imitated him and pursued him, the two of them swimming forward ever so slowly.
