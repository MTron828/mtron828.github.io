Inside the palace, Shaman Che was holding a small pot of sticky healing medicine, and looked up after a long silence, “Did you refine these?”

In front of him, the two old men exchanged looks, then the colourful-haired old man answered, “Strictly speaking, we refined them under the guidance of Shaman Niu.”

Shaman Che continued, “So, have you learned how to refine more?”

The two old men nodded, with the white-haired old man saying with obvious shame, “He… didn’t hide anything. He willingly taught us to make these healing medicines, so we learned very quickly.”

“Excellent!” Shaman Che revealed a faint smile, “What do you think about Shaman Niu?”

The old man with colourful hair replied, “Broad-minded!”

“Open-minded!” The white-haired old man added.

Che replied, “I was asking about his ability.”

The two old men pondered for a while, and responded in unison, “Unparalleled.”

Che’s eyes beamed, as if he were a hungry beast that had finally found its prey, and remarked faintly, “It’s a pity that the South Barbarian Clan doesn’t make good use of such an excellent Herbalist.” After a pause, he ordered someone standing by his side, “Yu, treat him well and try to meet any of his requirements, but… don’t let him leave the royal palace.”

Yu’s heart jumped, and she understood Che’s intention.

“Yes!” She replied with a complicated face.

The two old men looked at each other and sighed lightly. They wanted to say something more, but when they looked up, Che had already disappeared.

On the other side of the royal palace, Yang Kai sat cross-legged in a room that was considered luxurious by ancient standards. As he released his Divine Sense, feeling his recovered power, his heart filled with joy.

Sure enough, as the Village Chief mentioned, he regained use of his Divine Sense after he became a Shaman Master, and once he cleared this hurdle, the restrictions that hindered Yang Kai’s progress were all shattered.

His Space Ring could be opened again, and his various artifacts could be summoned too. For a moment, Yang Kai felt like he could break into anywhere in this vast world.

The first thing he did was check the Sealed World Bead.

The Sealed World Bead had devoured tremendous amounts of shattered Principles in the fourth layer of the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda, after which Yang Kai deliberately collected a massive amount of Five Elements Principles. According to his speculations, when the Five Elements joined together, they would give birth to a new world. However, he never got the chance to check the changes of the Sealed World Bead until now.

As his Soul Avatar entered the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai immediately noticed that this place was notably different from before. Although there was no obvious change on the surface, the Sealed World Bead had been with him for many years, so any slight changes would not escape his eyes.

If the Sealed World Bead had been an incomplete world before, it was now complete!

Yang Kai could clearly feel that the world was filled with all kinds of Principles. Using the Five Elements Principles as a foundation, they mutually reinforced and counterbalanced each other. They derived all things together by evolving each other, and gathered the three thousand Grand Daos of the Heavens and Earth.

This was a true world, a world without any flaws!

In the past, the Sealed World Bead had incomplete Principles, so one could not make a breakthrough to a new Great Realm even if their strength was sufficient, because it was impossible to resonate with the incomplete World Principles and gather World Energy to initiate a baptism.

Now though, the situation had changed.

There would be no obstacle even if someone was to break through to the Emperor Realm here now.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and carefully examined the Sealed World Bead, rejoicing many times. The improvement of the Sealed World Bead had a positive effect on his medicine garden as well, causing the various flowers and plants that were planted there to sway happily in the wind. With the Immortal Tree at the centre, the amazing vitality brought by it made countless herbs flourish.

What pleased Yang Kai most was that he now felt a hazy will in the Sealed World Bead.

It was the Will of the World, but like a newly born baby, it was clueless and not fully sentient. But Yang Kai knew that as long as it was given some time, it would definitely mature.

By that time, he could use it to comprehend World Force and allow him to break through the shackles of the Great Emperor Realm.

This was also why Yang Kai desperately wanted to repair and improve the Sealed World Bead in the first place. Now, it seemed that he had made the right decision.

Instead of hurriedly leaving the Small Sealed World, Yang Kai immersed himself into it by assuming an ethereal form, spreading out his consciousness and communicating with the newborn Will of the Sealed World Bead, like a parent tending to his child.

Despite the repeated failures and rejections, Yang Kai did not give up.

After an unknown amount of attempts, Yang Kai started to sense that the rejection of the World’s Will was slightly weakened, and seemed to have the sign of gradually accepting him. Just as Yang Kai was about to establish contact with one last effort, his vision was suddenly blacked out and his Soul Avatar collapsed while he returned to his true body instantly.

When he opened his eyes again, a sense of dizziness struck him. Yang Kai, who sat cross-legged on the bed, fell to the ground resulting in a loud bang.

Yang Kai was currently experiencing a splitting headache and his face was gaunt. He knew that this was due to excessive consumption of his Spiritual Energy.

Although he was now a Shaman Master, and could mobilize his Divine Sense, his strength was still far from his peak. He could not project his Soul out of his body without limit, as it caused a great load on himself.

If he was at his peak, this would not be a problem at all; however, it was a big problem now.

The sound of someone or something falling to the ground startled the guards outside the room, and Yu was the first one to rush inside. At first glance, she saw that Yang Kai’s face was pale and blood was oozing from all his seven orifices, so she hurriedly went forward to help him up, and asked worriedly, “Shaman Niu… What happened to you?”

Yang Kai opened his eyes sluggishly, and after identifying the person in front of him, he waved his hand to signal that he was fine. With a flip of his wrist, he took out some Spirit Pills that could supplement Spiritual Energy and swallowed them down without hesitation before sitting cross-legged on his bed.

Although Yu was worried, she also calmed down after seeing that Yang Kai was not in a panic, and looked after him closely on the side.

To her great shock, after a while, Yang Kai was in high spirits again, which astonished her to a degree that her eyes almost popped out of their sockets.

Yu could see more or less what happened just now. It was obvious that something went wrong while Shaman Niu was cultivating. It was a matter that could lead him to death, so how could he have recovered in such a short time?

When she was still lost in thought, Yang Kai asked, “How long has it been?”

Yu was stunned, but she still answered, “Five days.”

It had been five days since Yang Kai entered the room. Yu came to check on him once before, but seeing that Yang Kai was cultivating, she did not want to disturb him and just kept guarding outside the door instead.

“It’s been that long…” Yang Kai jumped up while speaking. A series of crackles could be heard as he straightened himself up, then he stretched his waist and informed, “Since my job here is done. I should go back now.”

Yu was taken aback, before she immediately stopped him, “You can’t go yet.”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai looked at her with his head tilted.

Yu racked her brain, and finally came up with a good excuse, “Shaman Che still wants to see you.”

Yang Kai frowned, even though he felt things becoming a little troublesome, he tried his best to be patient and nodded, “Then take me to Shaman Che now.”

Yu replied with a stiff expression, “Shaman Che went out and hasn’t returned yet… And, I don’t know when he will come back.”

Yang Kai looked at her and noticed that Yu kept dodging eye contact with him, and dared not meet his gaze, so he could not help laughing to himself, “Lying has really never been a strong suit of the Barbarian Race.”

A certain thief’s face suddenly surfaced in his mind before he continued, “Most of them at least. Does Shaman Che want to keep me in the Frost and Snow Clan?”

Being exposed by Yang Kai, Yu immediately looked frightened and did not know how to explain.

Yang Kai reached out and patted her on the shoulder, “I have taught the method of making the healing medicine to your Herbalists, so please go back and tell Shaman Che that I don’t appreciate his intentions. Although I don’t mean to be an enemy of the Frost and Snow Clan, if he wants to restrict my freedom, I’m afraid that the Frost and Snow Clan will have to pay a heavy price for it.”

His tone was soft, but it still sent chills down Yu’s spine. At that moment, she felt that she was not facing a High-Rank Shaman Warrior, but a Shaman King or Shaman Saint…

Yang Kai walked straight past her, but Yu stood petrified on the same spot, unable to even turn around. She shockingly found that she could not freely control her body.

[What kind of Shamanic Spell did he use!? How could there be such a mystifying effect?]

Following a muffled grunt, the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground came from outside the door. The warrior who was standing guard outside had undoubtedly been put down too.

Yu sighed lightly. Although she felt a little sorry about it, she was also relieved at the same time.

Shaman Che intended to keep Shaman Niu in the Frost and Snow Clan, which was understandable. A Herbalist who could make such healing medicine was a huge source of wealth. If he could stay and serve the Frost and Snow Clan, it would be greatly beneficial to the Clan.

Unfortunately, before Shaman Che had time to explain it to him, Shaman Niu had already forced his way out. At this point, Yu had no idea how to handle the situation.

In any case, there was no way for her to intervene in this matter anymore. From the start, she owed Shaman Niu a favour for the incident in the White Net Mountain, so she was unwilling to deceive him. Therefore, she actually felt relieved now.

The Barbarian Warriors in the royal palace dropped silently one after another as Yang Kai passed by them.

When he was about to walk out of the royal palace, a tall Shaman Grandmaster suddenly appeared in front of him with a lightning sharp aura.

Who else could it be other than Che?

As a Shaman Grandmaster of the Frost and Snow Clan, one of the commanders of the palace, it would be a serious dereliction of duty if he had not noticed Yang Kai incapacitate so many guards along the way.

Che could not hide his admiration and surprise at the sight of the clansmen in front of him who stood no chance against Yang Kai.

It was already extremely rare to find a Herbalist with such outstanding skills, but Che had not expected this Shaman Niu’s strength to also be so exaggerated. No wonder he dared to wander through White Net Mountain alone in the cold winter and snow. According to Yu’s report, he killed six Bone Melting Wolves and one Wolf King almost completely alone with just pure physical strength and simple spells. Che could not completely believe it back then, but now it seemed that what Yu had reported was true.

[Why was such a genius not born in my Frost and Snow Clan?] Shaman Che pined.

But now was not the time to grumble about such things. It would be fine as long as he could persuade Yang Kai to join the Frost and Snow Clan; after all, it was not uncommon for a powerful Shaman to join a different clan in this world.

And the best way to win over a person was naturally to meet his wants and needs.
