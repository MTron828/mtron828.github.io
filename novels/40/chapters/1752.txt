After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai turned to Ni Guang, cupped his fists, and said, “Junior is moved by Senior’s kindness, but Junior’s strength is low, so he is afraid if he were to travel together with Senior, he would only become a burden.”

“Haha,” Ni Guang smiled lightly. “Seems you have some self-awareness, but... Since this old master has invited you, naturally he has the confidence to protect you, or are you questioning this old master’s strength and methods?”

Yang Kai frowned while Luo Lan’s face also changed slightly, silently urging Yang Kai to pay more attention to his words.

Yang Kai smiled hesitantly and continued to argue, “Senior has great strength and superb cultivation, Junior doesn’t dare doubt that, but... Junior came here today with Senior Luo, so...”

“A true man should act decisively and not quibble about such minor issues!” Ni Guang snorted coldly, seemingly dissatisfied with Yang Kai continuing to make excuses, taking a deep look at him, and declaring, “In that case, you and Elder Luo can join hands with this old master, what do you think?”

Instead of Yang Kai, Ni Guang’s last words were directed at Luo Lan.

Luo Lan was startled as hesitation and struggle flashed across her face, but she quickly composed herself, smiled, and replied, “Since Senior Ni has offered so kindly, it would be impolite for this Mistress to refuse.”

Saying so, she cast a meaningful glance towards Yang Kai before flying over towards Ni Guang first.

With Luo Lan agreeing already, Yang Kai was out of reasons to object so he could only sigh and chase after her.

Soon after, the pair arrived in front of Ni Guang and Xue Yue, forming a small group.

Among everyone present, originally, only Ni Guang had brought an Origin Returning Realm Junior, while the other Origin Kings came alone. Now that Luo Lan and Yang Kai had joined them, there were now four people in Ni Guang’s group.

If one only counted numbers, this group overwhelmed all others present, but... whether the two Origin Realm Juniors would be more help or hindrance was unclear.

After inviting Luo Lan and Yang Kai, Ni Guang seemed to lose interest in speaking and simply stood in the void, closing his eyes and resting.

After Luo Lan came over, she could not help acting somewhat cautious; after all, her cultivation was lower than Ni Guang’s and she belonged to a different great force, so she was somewhat uncomfortable.

Yang Kai was even less pleased and simply remained sullenly silent.

Xue Yue closed her folding fan and flashed a smile, “Brother Yang, who would have expected that we would meet once more, I didn’t expect to see you here, it must be fate.”

“What do you want?” Yang Kai glared at her and spat with no trace of politeness, “Let me say this first, I have no interest in crossing dragons and swords with other men, so don’t get close to me!”

Luo Lan’s head whipped back and her beautiful eyes flashed a strange light as she glanced back and forth between Yang Kai and Xue Yue, unable to hide her shock.

Even Ni Guang, who had just closed his eyes and calmed his mind, opened them wide once again, his expression turning into an extremely strange one.

“You...” Xue Yue didn’t think that Yang Kai would speak such shameless words as soon as he came over, causing her face to go completely red as she trembled in anger, “What... what nonsense crossing dragons and swords!?”

“Hmph!” Yang Kai snorted through his nostrils, putting on a haughty appearance, “What it means, you know in your heart.”

The ambiguity of his words made Xue Yue even more helpless. Coupled with Luo Lan and Ni Guang’s awkward gazes, Xue Yue could not control her emotions for a moment and blushed all the way to her neck.

“Ha... haha...” Luo Lan did not know what to say so she just let out some forced laughter, as if wanting to ease the embarrassment but only succeeding in making things more embarrassing for Xue Yue.

“You... if you dare to speak impertinently again, I’ll kill you!” Xue Yue ground her teeth and put on a look of absolute anger towards Yang Kai, as if trying to clarify her stance.

“Are you willing?” Yang Kai sneered, looking directly into Xue Yue’s eyes.

Xue Yue was speechless, her teeth grinding even harder as her Saint Qi began showing signs of welling up.

Ni Guang’s eyes narrowed and he let out a slight snicker, “Young man, your courage isn’t small, actually daring to speak such nonsense in front of this old master. No wonder Third Young Master has an interest in you, but... the nonsense stops here, no more trying to stir up trouble just to prove a point.”

Yang Kai grinned and shrugged his shoulders.

Since Ni Guang had given him such a warning, he could only comply. In fact, Yang Kai was only angry that Xue Yue had made things difficult for him and was trying to get some revenge.

After speaking, Ni Guang closed his eyes again, as if nothing happened just now.

On the contrary, uncertainty flashed across Luo Lan’s eyes as she stared at Yang Kai and Xue Yue for a while, as if trying to figure out if there really was some unspeakable secret between them.

Did the famous Xue Yue Third Young Master really like men and not women? Why else would he have looked so guilty just now? What exactly had transpired between these two shocking talents?

Just thinking about it for a moment caused Luo Lan’s face to blush...

“Come here!” Xue Yue suddenly spat out a breath, the blush on her face receding like a tide before she coldly called Yang Kai out and flew away. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

She obviously wanted to find a more private location to talk with Yang Kai, lest he say something even more embarrassing.

Yang Kai frowned and wanted to ignore Xue Yue, but thinking about what kind of reaction Ni Guang might have, he sighed and followed after her.

“Young people are always ignorant and arrogant, Elder Luo doesn’t need to pay them any mind,” After the two left, Ni Guang suddenly muttered.

“Haha, it is as Senior Ni says,” Luo Lan gave a light laugh.

Thirty kilometres or so away from the entrance, Xue Yue stopped and turned to look back, her beautiful eyes flashing a complicated light. After Yang Kai came over, she immediately shouted, “Why are you acting like this!”

“Why are you doing this?” Yang Kai asked back.

“What’s wrong with me doing this?” Xue Yue grit her teeth.

“You could have just pretended to not see me and then nothing would have happened. Why drag me over to follow you?” Yang Kai spat; his stomach full of grievances.

“Don’t you know how dangerous the Severed World is? Even Origin Kings cannot guarantee their safety there. I asked Uncle Ni to let you join us to protect your safety! You really don’t know how to appreciate other people’s kindness!” Xue Yue snapped angrily, almost spitting in Yang Kai’s face.

Hearing this though, Yang Kai just smiled slyly as he stared at Xue Yue’s face.

“What?” Xue Yue began feeling somewhat anxious being stared at so aggressively and could not help taking two steps back.

“Didn’t you want to kill me? Since when do you care so much about my safety?” Yang Kai smiled and said, “I know your secret, so wouldn’t it be perfect for you if I died? That way, your secret will never be exposed. You are paying so much attention to me now though, it’s almost as if you’ve fallen for me. Is that what this is all about, Beautiful?”

Xue Yue heard this, curled her lips into a grin, and snickered, “Stop projecting your delusions onto me, just who do you think you are? Why would I, Xue Yue, ever be interested in a shameless guy like you?”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow hearing this and began stroking his chin, as if he was lost in thought. Seeing this caused Xue Yue’s heart to clench because she thought she had wounded his self-esteem, instantly becoming a bit regretful.

However, in the next instant, Yang Kai suddenly said earnestly, “Aren’t women supposed to have special feelings for their first man? Am I wrong?”

“Who is whose first man!?” Xue Yue ground her teeth hard as she spat angrily.

“Although there hasn’t been much progress between you and me, at the very least, we’ve been intimate, with no barriers between...” Before Yang Kai could finish his thought though, his expression changed, and he reached out to grasp towards the void in front of him.

Suddenly, a burst of Saint Qi erupted as Xue Yue’s hand was caught by Yang Kai’s in a tight grip.

With a loud bang, Yang Kai’s body shook slightly, but he did not retreat, instead taking the opportunity to clasp Xue Yue’s little hand and twist her around before using his free arm to lock her neck, holding her firmly in place.

Xue Yue still wanted to struggle, but Yang Kai had moved too fast for her to react.

In an instant, Xue Yue was subdued!

Her face changed slightly as she whispered, “When did you become so strong?”

“Don’t look down on others too much, Beautiful,” Yang Kai said while whispering into her ear, “Moreover, isn’t wanting to fight the moment we meet growing tiresome for you too?”

“Let go!” Xue Yue bit her thin lip lightly.

The hot breath on her ear made it feel like lightning was coursing through her veins, and the intense heat pressing against her back involuntarily made Xue Yue recall all the ‘intimacy’ she had shared with Yang Kai on that Dead Star so many years ago.

Naturally, whenever she thought about that time, full of unbridled contact...

“Let me go!” Xue Yue struggled, but found that she could not escape from Yang Kai’s grip at all, her voice couldn’t help lowering to a whisper, “If someone sees this, how do you plan to explain?”

Yang Kai stared at her red earlobes and laughed frivolously, “Your mouth says no, but your body is still quite honest!”

These ambiguous words only made Xue Yue feel even more embarrassed. Taking a deep breath and trying to sound as calm as possible, she said, “Don’t make trouble. Can you let go now? I promise I won’t act against you again.”

Yang Kai thought for a moment before nodding, “Good.”

Xue Yue’s attack just now did not carry any murderous intent. Obviously, she did not want his life, only to shut him up, so Yang Kai didn’t take it to heart.

Having reached an agreement, Yang Kai released Xue Yue’s hands.

The moment she regained her freedom, Xue Yue instantly opened a dozen metre distance between her and Yang Kai before turning around and glowering at him, wishing she could eat his flesh and drink his blood.

After a while though, she adjusted her somewhat messy clothes and calmed her mood.

“Tell me, what is your real goal here?” Yang Kai’s expression turned extremely serious, completely different from the lawless and obscene one he was just wearing.

Seeing this, Xue Yue had some trouble adapting...

“You didn’t ask that Ni Guang to invite me along for no reason, what do you want?”

“I said it was for your own good, don’t you believe me?” Xue Yue raised her brow.

“So you really do like me...” Yang Kai said deeply.

“Shameless!”

Yang Kai laughed loudly, “Just kidding, don’t be so serious.”

Xue Yue had to take a few deep breaths this time to regain her calm, “In the Emperor Garden, we never got to finish our transaction, or have you forgotten?”
