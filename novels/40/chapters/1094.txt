Chapter 1094, You’re Quite Pitiful CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It wasn’t that Saint Qi didn’t exist in his Yang Kai’s body however, it was just that all the strength he had accumulated over his years of cultivation had currently been exhausted. After discovering that his foundation was still intact, Yang Kai tried circulating his Secret Art and immediately found that he was able to absorb and refine the ambient World Energy, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief.

As long as his foundation remained, it would only cost him some time to restore his strength, and with the help of his numerous pills and Saint Crystals, that time wouldn’t be too long. After at most a few days, Yang Kai would return to his peak state, but in order to replace his once inexhaustible supply of energy would require a long period of accumulation.

On the other hand, Yang Kai’s Spiritual Energy had not diminished and instead was stronger than ever.

Using his Divine Sense to examine his body, Yang Kai quickly became pleasantly surprised.

The golden blood flowing through his veins now seemed far purer and denser than before.

On top of that, he now possessed nearly a hundred drops of the most orthodox Demon God Golden Blood, each one of them containing a terrifying amount of power. This was true Demon God Golden Blood, equal in might to the blood of Great Demon God himself. These hundred drops of blood had even greater restorative strength compared to the rest of Yang Kai’s already formidable blood.

These hundred drops of Golden Blood also seemed to contain Yang Kai’s insights into the Heavenly Way and Martial Dao as well as his understanding of his own strength and its utilization.

The former restlessness in his heart was instantly replaced with joy.

Yang Kai had no idea what had happened in the Body Tempering Divine Pond, but he surmised that he had triggered some kind of Spirit Array linked to the Sacrificial Altar which then caused the entire pool to compress into the blood-red crystal which had encased him. Afterwards, he had obviously drifted through the Starry Sky while his blood and body had been tempered, ultimately winding up in his current situation.

His Saint Qi had not disappeared for nothing and had likely been refined into his blood to assist in the formation of these hundred drops of Golden Blood.

Now that his blood had become purer, Yang Kai believed his vitality had also risen greatly and the resilience and restorative strength he could display in battle would be far great than before.

In order to verify his conjecture, Yang Kai gathered what little strength he had just managed to restore and gave himself a bone-deep wound on his palm.

Golden light shone from the wound and before blood could even flow out, the terrible wound sealed itself and in less than half cup of tea’s time, not even a scar remained on his palm.

Yang Kai took a deep breath to suppress his inner excitement.

In the past, although he wouldn’t consider such an injury serious, it would still have taken at least an hour or two to fully heal, but now, half a cup of tea’s worth of time was sufficient.

His restorative abilities had indeed increased exponentially.

After examining his body and determining that his current situation was only a short-term problem, Yang Kai put down his worries and took out a piece of Saint Crystal. Holding this crystal in his hand, Yang Kai began circulating his Secret Art to draw out power from it while at the same time he stuffed a handful of restorative pills into his mouth. Refining these medicinal efficacies and Saint Qi, feeling his strength slowly returning, Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling like he was being reborn.

The Heavenly Spirit Ghost Orchid’s mark on his chest had long ago disappeared, so Yang Kai was able to infer that he had been in a comatose state for a long period of time, as for how long exactly, he had no way to judge.

The woman he had spoken with before said they were currently near Shadowed Star, and that this Cultivation Star was several years away from Rainfall Star. That meant that Yang Kai might have been sealed in that blood-red crystal for several years. During that period, the energy in the blood-red crystal had combined with his own Saint Qi and promoted the quality of his blood. When the energy in the crystal and his own Saint Qi were exhausted, the effects of the Sacrificial Altar ended and the crystal shattered. Yang Kai didn’t see any trace of the altar itself.

The precious treasures which had been placed on the Sacrificial Altar should also have been refined into pure energy to help promote the quality of his blood.

Although the whole affair had been somewhat haphazard and unpredictable, Yang Kai had gained a lot of benefits.

Although Yu Feng was a bit rude and thuggish, he was still a man of his word and really brought over something good for Yang Kai to eat. Yang Kai didn’t stand on ceremony and quickly swallowed down the food to assist him in his restoration.

With his Third Order Saint Realm cultivation, it didn’t matter if Yang Kai ate or not, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have any appetite whatsoever, and the food Yu Feng had brought also contained a large amount of energy which was beneficial to him, so Yang Kai didn’t hesitate to consume it.

Over the next night, Yang Kai consumed three High-Rank Saint Crystals and accumulated a good deal of Saint Qi in his meridians; of course, it was nothing compared to his peak.

The next day, footsteps sounded in the hall outside and the young woman who had spoken to him yesterday soon pushed open the door and walked inside, not even bothering to knock. Another cultivator who had accompanied her quickly pulled up a chair for her and set it down in a flattering manner.

After Wu Yi took a seat, she waved at the cultivator, signalling that he could leave.

The cultivator hesitated before asking, “Young Lady, is leaving you alone with him appropriate?”

“What’s the problem?” Wu Yi glanced over at him unhappily, “Or do you think that you’re stronger than me and can offer me some kind of protection?”

The cultivator wore an embarrassed look and dared not remain, respectfully bowing before walking out and quietly closing the door.

Taking a look at Yang Kai sitting on the ground, leaning against the wall, Wu Yi giggled, “Feeling better?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, not knowing what this woman wanted to ask him. He felt that the cultivators on this Starship didn’t hold any malicious intentions towards him. Although Yu Feng clamoured about killing him, it was obvious he was just acting vigilantly.

“You look better. I don’t know how long you’ve been drifting through the Starry Sky, but this time if it weren’t for my subordinate saving you, perhaps you would have gone on floating forever. If you had accidentally encountered a powerful Star Beast, being swallowed up is entirely possible,” Wu Yi casually spoke, clearly trying to frighten him, “If you were swallowed by a Star Beast, your fate would have been quite miserable.”

Yang Kai saw that she was playing with a Space Ring while speaking to him and immediately understood the point she was trying to make, grinning as he nodded, “You saved my life, so naturally I must offer my thanks. Unfortunately, I currently have nothing on my body as my only Space Ring was taken away by that guy named Yu Feng yesterday...”

“So, you’re offering me this Space Ring as thanks?” Wu Yi was overjoyed, “Great, then this ring and its contents are now mine, no going back on your word.”

“I won’t,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Wu Yi extracted the contents of the Space Ring and stuffed them into her own ring before returning the empty one to Yang Kai.

“You’re really rich, there were actually five hundred High-Rank Saint Crystals in that ring. Don’t you understand that excessive wealth easily attracts unwanted attention? Fortunately, you ran into my Starship. If it was anyone else’s you likely wouldn’t be alive right now.”

“Does that much make me rich?” Yang Kai scratched his head.

“It doesn’t?” Wu Yi asked helplessly, “En, that’s right, you outsiders possess a lot of Saint Crystals, but on Shadowed Star it’s not the same. There are only a few Saint Crystal mines, and they are all occupied by big forces, holding one is impossible for a small family like mine so we can only risk our lives by mining outside Ore Stars, each time resulting in many deaths.”

“Are you all so poor?” Yang Kai was utterly shocked. Since coming to the Star Field, he had never had to worry about Saint Crystals. On the floating continent, he had robbed all the Purple Star and Sword Union cultivators, obtaining a lot of Saint Crystals. On Rainfall Star, he had robbed the treasure of the Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce branch.

He really didn’t know that someone could be so happy about obtaining a measly five hundred High-Rank Saint Crystal. What’s more, it didn’t seem like this young woman’s identity was low.

“You said you came from Rainfall Star? As far as I know, that Cultivation Star is owned by a force called Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce, right?”

“En.”

“Is Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce big? How many masters does it have? Are the strongest really Origin Kings? I heard that they build palaces entirely out of Saint Crystal and that they eat precious pills as snacks, is that true? Is it?” Wu Yi let out a barrage of questions that nearly made Yang Kai’s head spin.

Hesitating for a moment, Yang Kai asked, “Have you ever been outside?”

Wu Yi shook her head, “I’ve only moved about Shadowed Star, everywhere else is too far away from this place. I heard that Heng Luo Chamber of Commerce does business all over the Star Field, but you won’t find them on Shadowed Star. It’s really annoying, they look down on us far too much.”

“Why can you only stay on Shadowed Star? Since you want to see the outside world, why not just go yourself?” Yang Kai suddenly felt that this woman was a bit pitiful, she obviously longed for adventure but was clearly fettered by something which made it impossible for her to leave.

“Do you think it’s easy to leave this place?” Wu Yi glanced at him meaningfully, causing Yang Kai to unconsciously straighten up a bit.

“Without a suitable Star Chart, a solid enough Starship, and a sufficient amount of resources, how can a several year-long voyage be made? People here rarely go outside, and outsiders basically don’t come over, Shadowed Star seems destined to become a forgotten place.”

After hearing what she said, Yang Kai couldn’t help thinking of Tong Xuan Realm.

There were many similarities between the two, both were extremely remote, but Shadowed Star was obviously better than Tong Xuan Realm, at least they knew about the Star Field whereas Tong Xuan Realm was completely isolated, not even qualified to explore the Starry Sky.

Throughout the vast Star Field, existences like Tong Xuan Realm and Shadowed Star were definitely not rare, it was likely there were many such Cultivation Stars tucked away in unknown corners.

For a moment, Yang Kai actually felt a subtle connection to this woman, and thinking about it, he muttered, “Actually, you’re much better off than me.”

“How so?” Wu Yi asked curiously.

“Do you know where I came from? A place where the strongest masters were Third Order Saints...”

Wu Yi’s jaw dropped.

“Don’t believe me?” Yang Kai smiled, “It’s the truth though. We didn’t know about Star Shuttles or Starships or even that there were other Cultivation Stars in the Star Field. We would sit beneath the stars and think that the Third Order Saint Realm was the peak of the Martial Dao. If I hadn’t accidentally obtained a broken down Star Shuttle and possessed enough skill to leap out from my world, no one would have even known such a feat was possible. I am the first and only one from the homeland to reach the Star Field, most others still live their lives completely ignorant of this place’s existence.”

Wu Yi stared at Yang Kai and only after a long time said, “You’re quite pitiful.”
