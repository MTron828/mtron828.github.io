Sensing that something was off, Yang Kai turned around and looked in that direction, where he saw four people flying over, one man and three women. That man was none other than Yuan Wu, who appeared to be obsequious and cautious as he accompanied the ladies, nodding and bowing to them.

All three women were strikingly beautiful, especially the one at the front who appeared about 25 years old. Her face was alluring, her figure was curvy, and her peaks were grand. Moreover, her long imperial green dress and jet-black hair were fluttering in the air as she was flying over to this place. However, something might have happened to the lady earlier as she appeared to be furious. At the moment, her expression was grim, and her gaze was cold. Although the two behind her were pretty as well, they paled when compared to the leading lady.

As Yang Kai watched them flying towards him, he frowned and wondered what these people were up to. Apparently, Lu San Niang saw them as well and in an instant, she turned pale as her tender body started trembling.

Seeing that, Lu Yu Qin hurriedly approached her and asked in a small voice, “Mother, what happened to you?”

Lu San Niang shook her head and remained silent, but her expression grew more apprehensive by the moment.

Noticing her strange behaviour, Yang Kai took a look at her and then shifted his attention to the three ladies. With his brows twitching, he asked in a small voice, “Do you know them?”

In response, Lu San Niang gave a small nod. It was then Yang Kai understood her reaction when she saw these three.

According to Lu San Niang, they were now on a Spirit Island where Fu Chi of the Dragon Clan resided. Centuries ago, she was captured by Fu Chi and forced to live on this island. Apparently, Lu San Niang wasn’t the only woman on this island, and most of them were Fu Chi’s playthings.

Obviously, the three ladies coming at them were also Fu Chi’s toys, so it was no wonder that Lu San Niang knew who they were. After all, they had been living together for centuries, so she might have been familiar with them. However, it seemed that she was afraid of them. Perhaps there were some grudges between them.

After Yang Kai pondered over the matter for a bit, he got a rough picture. Hence, he decided to take a step to cover up Lu San Niang’s figure. He wasn’t sure why these ladies were coming at them, but the expression of the leading lady suggested that this wasn’t a friendly trip.

In the blink of an eye, Yuan Wu and the three women arrived, but they just floated in the air and looked down at Yang Kai and the others in an aloof manner. With a cold expression, the leading lady sized Yang Kai up and asked coldly, “Who did it?”

Yuan Wu hurriedly pointed at Yang Kai and the others before uttering, “Madam, they’re the culprits!”

The leading lady shot a glare at them and said through gritted teeth, “How dare all of you hurt Xiao Hong!”

Unfazed, Yang Kai just stared sternly at Yuan Wu, who became uneasy because of that gaze. Recalling the humiliation he went through a few days ago, Yuan Wu’s expression changed as he flinched a little. He was truly terrified of Yang Kai. Until this day, he still couldn’t understand how a trivial Human who was merely in the First-Order Emperor Realm could be so much stronger than he was, and how he was able to suppress his Dragon bloodline.

Nevertheless, Yuan Wu soon remembered that he wasn’t alone. He had a prominent lady by his side, so he shouldn’t be afraid of Yang Kai. Considering all this, he straightened up and pointed at the leading lady before snarling, “This is the Mistress of the Master who owns this land, Madam Hua. Are all of you deaf? Pay your respects to her, now!”

Upon hearing the introduction, Madam Hua raised her chin, appearing quite overbearing. In fact, there was no such position as ‘Mistress’ on this Spirit Island. Fu Chi brought them here and regarded them as mere outlets for his sexual desires, so he had never treated them with any kind of respect.

However, Madam Hua was an alluring lady who knew how to make a man happy, so she was Fu Chi’s favourite plaything, which was why her position was second only to Fu Chi on this island. Yuan Wu’s introduction was a great compliment for her, so she was satisfied with it. With narrowed eyes, she stared at Yang Kai as though the latter was an ant.

Ignoring her, Yang Kai continued to stare at Yuan Wu and curled his lips into a sneer.

In an instant, Yuan Wu felt furious as he had been provoked, [I’ve introduced Madam Hua to them, so how could he still be so arrogant? Doesn’t he understand Madam Hua’s importance on this island?]

Nevertheless, he was gleeful at Yang Kai’s behaviour. He was no match for Yang Kai, but it would be wonderful if he could teach him a lesson with Madam Hua’s help; therefore, he was now taking pleasure in Yang Kai’s imminent misfortune as he secretly hoped that this boy would act even more arrogant, so he intentionally stirred up the situation more, “Madam Hua, look how insolent he is! He doesn’t have any regard for you at all!”

At that moment, Madam Hua was quite infuriated. She thought that these insignificant people would bow to her right after she showed up. Although she wasn’t Dragonborn or from the Dragon Clan, she was Fu Chi’s favourite woman; therefore, she regarded herself as more important than anyone else on this island. Having been incited by Yuan Wu, she snorted coldly, “You’re all quite bold, no wonder you had the guts to hurt Xiao Hong!”

It was then Yang Kai slowly shifted his attention to her and asked with a frown, “Who is Xiao Hong?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yang Kai really didn’t know who or what Xiao Hong was, so he instinctively thought that Yuan Wu had played a dirty trick to shift all the blame to him.

Madam Hua scoffed, “Don’t you even know what you’ve done?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“How impudent!” Yuan Wu growled at Yang Kai, “Madam Hua’s prized Golden Backed Red Carp was hurt today. On this island, only you have the guts to be so reckless!”

Shaking his head, Yang Kai replied, “What Golden Backed Red Carp? I’ve never seen it.”

Yang Kai had just come back from outside, so he had never seen any Golden Backed Red Carp. However, its name suggested that it was a fish that Madam Hua had been keeping. These ladies had been confined to this island for such a long time and had nothing to do except when Fu Chi needed them in bed. Hence, it was natural that they wanted to raise some pets to occupy and relax.

However, Yang Kai truly wasn’t the culprit, so he put on a sneer and thought, [Yuan Wu, I was going to let you off, but I didn’t expect that you’d try to use such a transparent scheme on me. It seems that you haven’t learned from your previous lesson!]

With a murderous intent flashing across his mind, he stared at Yuan Wu as though the latter was already dead.

All of a sudden, Madam Hua waved her hand, “Show him!”

Then, one of the ladies behind her stepped forward with a fish tank in her hands. Inside the tank, there was a red fish that would easily fit into one’s palm. Its back was golden, but the rest of its body was red, so it had an outstanding appearance.

It seemed that it was the Golden Backed Red Carp Yuan Wu just mentioned, but its aura suggested that it was just a Fifth-Order Monster Beast. Hence, although it looked pretty, it wasn’t powerful. Furthermore, its original form should be larger than this. The fish tank must have some special power to contain the fish in it.

Indeed, the Golden Backed Red Carp was hurt as some of the scales on its back had peeled off, which affected its overall beauty; however, it should be alright as it still appeared energetic inside the tank. Given enough time, the fish’s beauty should be restored. However, by just looking at Madam Hua’s expression, one would have thought that the fish had died a terrible death.

The pretty face of the lady, who was holding the fish tank, was cold, as though one could scrape a layer of frost off it. Glowering at Yang Kai, she bellowed, “This is Xiao Hong! Do you remember now?”

Impassively, Yang Kai replied, “I’ve never seen this red carp before, let alone hurt it. You’re blaming the wrong person.”

“How dare you deny it when the evidence is right here!” Madam Hua was incensed, thinking that this guy’s attitude was outrageous.

Yang Kai refuted coldly, “You can’t prove that I hurt it. Moreover, if I had made a move, your fish would be dead by now.”

Hearing that, Madam Hua was startled for a moment before she started trembling in rage, “How dare you talk to me like this!?”

“I can talk to you however I want. Who do you think you are?” Yang Kai snorted.

Madam Hua was infuriated because her power on this Spirit Island was second only to Fu Chi. Although she was servile to Fu Chi, all others on this island had to be respectful to her. Earlier, when she went over to Yuan Wu’s place and revealed her identity, everyone there instantly became subservient to her. Hence, she didn’t expect that Yang Kai would have no regard for her at all and simply could not tolerate it.

Ignoring her fury outright, Yang Kai snapped coldly, “The red carp’s injury has nothing to do with me! Scram back to where you came from and stop bothering me!”

Madam Hua’s expression turned livid when she heard that. Although this red carp wasn’t valuable, she had been keeping it for more than ten years. Whenever she felt lonely, it was this fish that kept her company and helped her set her mind at ease. Now that it was hurt, she definitely had to settle the score with the culprit.

Nevertheless, the culprit before her eyes kept talking back and insulting her. Now, this matter had escalated beyond the red carp’s injury. If she didn’t teach this young man a lesson on this day, her authority would be forever damaged. [How dare a trivial Human provoke me! He must be sick of living!]

Just when Madam Hua was ready to teach Yang Kai a lesson at all costs, Yuan Wu suddenly pointed at the people behind Yang Kai and said, “If you’re not the culprit, it must be them who did it! Yes, it was them! Madam Hua, it was that mother and daughter who were gathering Luminous Pearls nearby. They must have come across your pet in the sea and hurt it!”

“What?” Madam Hua frowned and looked behind Yang Kai. She had not paid attention to the people behind him because she was furious about Xiao Hong’s injury. With her mind set on getting her revenge, she had no time to care about other matters.

Upon Yuan Wu’s reminder, she then noticed that two people had been hiding behind Yang Kai. One of them was covered up by the young man before her eyes, and the other young girl was looking timidly at her.

“Hmm?” Madam Hua stared at the young girl and frowned, finding her somewhat familiar, thinking she had met her somewhere before.
