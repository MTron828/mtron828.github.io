Now that she took the initiative to admit it, Yang Kai was still shocked even though he was prepared for it…

The Dragon Clan held itself as the ruler of all living beings. Although the title seemed to be self-proclaimed, it was indeed not far from the truth.

In Ancient Times, Dragons and Phoenixes were the most powerful and respected among all the Divine Spirits! Whereas now when most of the Divine Spirits were extinct, the Dragon Clan was still living and thriving in the East Sea.

It could be said that this powerful race had witnessed the myriad ages of the world itself, experiencing the full passage of time from primordial to present. The Dragon Clan was not just a name, but also a symbol of inheritance and power!

Because Yang Kai possessed the Golden Divine Dragon Source in his body, he did not feel any intimidation or fear in the face of Zhu Qing, a living Dragon, but rather an inexplicable affection.

This affection quickly turned into greed and covetousness though as thoughts of subduing this Dragon Girl and making her his woman raced through this mind… What else could a man ask for with a life like this?

“How did you know?” Zhu Qing asked again.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, rubbing his fingers, and replied, “This Young Master is proficient in the art of divination, I could tell with a simple look…”

Zhu Qing glared at him furiously, thinking only a ghost would believe such a liar, but she did expose a lot of information when she was fighting with Yang Kai before, so it was not surprising that he had guessed her identity.

“It’s fine if you know, but I ask you to keep this information to yourself; after all, the identity of a Dragon Clan member is a bit too… shocking.” Zhu Qing looked at Yang Kai sincerely.

Although it was rumoured that Dragon Island was situated somewhere on the East Sea in the Eastern Territory, and many Dragons were living there, this was just a rumour after all and the world at large did not know anything about them. If a living Dragon Girl suddenly appeared in public, it would inevitably bring an unimaginable shock.

“No problem,” Yang Kai responded readily. “I am not someone who likes running their mouth.”

Zhu Qing expressed gratitude, thinking that this person could be a good person when conversed with properly. Perhaps she had been too biased, making him appear annoying and displeasing no matter what he did, but it was time to change her opinion of him.

“But what can you give me in return?” Yang Kai’s tone changed, and the aggressive gaze once again scanned over the sensitive parts of Zhu Qing’s body, like a dozen big hands trying to strip her naked.

Zhu Qing took a deep breath as she slowly closed her eyes, her body trembling slightly.

[I’m so naive to think that this person could be good!]

“What… do… you… want… in… return!” Zhu Qing opened her eyes, grinding her teeth as she uttered each word with fury, becoming increasingly infuriated the more she looked at his disgusting face.

“It depends on what you can give me,” Yang Kai rested his cheek on his palm, remaining calm and composed.

Yang Kai instinctually felt that there was something wrong with him today. The long-forgotten desires that he had been suppressing began boiling incessantly ever since he met Zhu Qing. Such feelings disappeared after separating from her, but they returned again now, especially when they were both alone in this room. The thrill of playing with fire was quite irresistible despite him continuously warning himself to not provoke this Dragon Girl.

Zhu Qing stared at him deeply, and it took a long time before she lightly opened her crimson lips and uttered, “… friends…”

“Huh?” Yang Kai looked at her, flabbergasted.

Zhu Qing inhaled gently, and repeated, “I said, I can be friends with you.”

Although the tone was plain, the unconcealable arrogance between her brow was saying that this matter was a Heaven-sent opportunity for him.

Yang Kai was stunned on the spot, just staring at her blankly.

Zhu Qing did not avoid his gaze, but frowned when Yang Kai did not respond after a long time, “Did you hear what I…”

“Hahahaha!” Yang Kai burst into laughter, slapping his thigh vigorously.

Zhu Qing was irritated, “What are you laughing at?”

Yang Kai stopped laughing, and looked at Zhu Qing mockingly, “The arrogance of the Dragon Clan is worthy of its reputation.”

Zhu Qing sneered slightly, “Better than the cunning Humans.”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, and nodded, “En, what you said is right. Humans are indeed very cunning, and no one can deny that, but you said you want to be friends with me. Do you know… what a friend is?”

Zhu Qing replied proudly, “I don’t need to know.”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly, and looked at her, guessing, “You have no friends, right?”

[What kind of friends does a Dragon need?] Zhu Qing sneered in her heart, her face showing disdain, but suddenly realized that Yang Kai’s expression had a hint of pity and sympathy, suddenly making her feel annoyed. How dare a trivial Human look at her with this expression? Her slender fingers twitched, trying hard to suppress the idea of gouging his eyeballs out.

That was because she was not his opponent, and she would just be humiliating herself if she acted rashly.

[Elder, the task you gave is really arduous. Qing’er really doesn’t know how to complete it. Is this a test from the clan for me?]

“Why do you want to be friends with me?” Yang Kai frowned as he asked.

[Of course, it’s because of the Elder’s order and the Ancestral Dragon Source.] Zhu Qing muttered in her heart, but replied out loud, “Do I need a reason?”

“Why not?” Yang Kai was astonished.

Zhu Qing looked impatient, and demanded through gritted teeth, “Just tell me if you agree.”

One’s ancestors would jump out of their graves to receive such an honour to be friends with a Dragon, so how dare this man make things difficult? He really did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.

“What if I agree? And what if I don’t?” Yang Kai looked at her with a smirk, then his expression suddenly became stern, “You can’t be friends by just saying it.”

Yang Kai wondered if Zhu Qing was just too arrogant or simply had no experience socializing with people; he had never met a person who wanted to be friends and still put on an expression that said ‘you should feel lucky that I want to be your friend’.

“What should I do then?” Zhu Qing frowned and thought for a while, unexpectedly putting on an expression of confusion and questioning.

Yang Kai glanced at her and waved his hand, quickly explaining, “As friends, you should put your life on the line for each other, share each other’s worries and problems. As friends, you should be honest with each other and take care of each other. As friends… “

“Be specific,” Zhu Qing interrupted him impatiently, “What do you want me to do before you are willing to be friends with me.”

Yang Kai looked at her with a broad smile, and patted the bed next to him, “I don’t have a bed warmer. If you can undress and accompany me for the night, I would think about it.”

“Out of the question!” Zhu Qing roared. This man was nothing but a bastard, revealing his degenerate mentality in every word he uttered! Warming a bed was not something a friend needed to do! Although Zhu Qing had no friends, how could she not understand common sense?

Yang Kai shrugged his shoulders, looking helpless.

Zhu Qing turned her head away, filled with reluctance, “Change it.”

“Then I won’t agree.” Yang Kai said with a wave.

“What do you want?” Zhu Qing flushed with anger and glared at him fiercely.

Yang Kai slapped the table in front of him into pieces, and exploded, “This Young Master wants to ask you instead, what do you want?”

How baffling. In Yang Kai’s entire life, he had never seen anyone like her, who had come over and demanded to be friends with him. How could friendship be a coerced transaction?

Zhu Qing pursed her red lips and stated, “I just want to be friends with you.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Yang Kai swept over her up and down to confirm that the woman was not insane, and yelled, “Good, I heard that there’s a force known as the Sword Villa in the Western Territory. The Sword Wine brewed there is the best in the world, even Great Emperors would praise it profusely. If you can get me some…”

Zhu Qing’s eyes lit up, “You will be friends with me?”

Yang Kai rubbed his chin, “I’ll think about it.”

“You…” Zhu Qing was furious, “You’re too much!”

Yang Kai sneered, “This is who I am, get out if you can’t stand it!”

“Fine. No one has ever dared to treat me like this. You will regret it!” Zhu Qing glared at him fiercely and headed out after spitting out a ferocious threat.

Yang Kai turned around and smiled, “It’s getting late. Qing’er, don’t you want to stay the night at least?”

Zhu Qing, who was by the door and was about to push it open, threw a punch in front of her upon hearing this.

In an instant, a big hole was opened in the door, spattering splinters of wood everywhere. Zhu Qing glared back at Yang Kai, turned around, and rushed into the darkness.

Outside the door, Ying Fei was thoroughly drenched in cold sweat. After Zhu Qing was long gone, he peeped into the room and found Yang Kai safe and sound, finally letting out a breath of relief, “Young Master Yang, what happened to her?”

“Only a ghost would know.” Yang Kai chuckled happily, feeling a lot easier in his heart.

After this incident, Zhu Qing would never come to pester him again, right?

Although it was a good thing that a Dragon Girl was attracted to him and insisted on being friends, Yang Kai found himself unable to suppress his carnal desires whenever they were in close proximity.

He was afraid a day would come when he really could not hold back anymore and would force himself on her. At that point, he would have offended the entire Dragon Clan.

All in all, although this Zhu Qing did not seem malicious, her existence was too dangerous to him, in multiple ways.

Yang Kai was puzzled. Zhu Qing did not cultivate any Charm Techniques, and her beauty was not to the extent that he could not suppress himself, so why was he so unable to control himself whenever he caught a sniff of her scent?

“This, this…” An elderly man wearing a golden robe like a landlord’s suddenly rushed upstairs, exclaiming again and again after seeing Yang Kai’s broken door.

Every room here was strengthened with a Spirit Array so powerful that even a general First-Order Emperor Realm Master would not be able to destroy it. What kind of terrible monster could have punched a big hole in this door?

“Who are you?” Ying Fei glanced at him and asked.

The elderly man seemed to know the identity of Ying Fei and bowed respectfully after hearing the question, “Replying to Sir, this lowly one is the keeper of this inn. What happened to this place just now…”

“Don’t ask something you shouldn’t ask,” Ying Fei glanced at him, taking out some Source Crystals from his Space Ring before tossing it to the innkeeper and saying, “This is the compensation. Give my Young Master a new room.”

“Yes, yes!” The innkeeper nodded and quickly got up. He would have never let it slide if someone else made trouble in his inn. Although he was just an innkeeper, this inn was actually an industry of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect.

But Ying Fei was a powerful Monster King, and Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was just a fart compared to him.

Very quickly, the innkeeper arranged a new room for Yang Kai and withdrew respectfully.
