Strictly speaking, the people from the seven Third Class great forces were outsiders, while the people from these ten or so Universe Worlds were Yang Kai’s subordinates. Previously, they were ruled over and exploited by Seven Wonders Land. Now, Void Land had risen and taken Seven Wonders Land’s place, and Yang Kai appeared to be different from Qi Qiao, which allowed them to see some hope.

These representatives were Great Emperors from their respective Universe Worlds, chosen ones who had obtained recognition of their World’s Will. Their status was just like that of Yang Kai in the Star Boundary.

People like them, if they didn’t die for various reasons, were bound to achieve great things in life, dependant on their own opportunities and effort of course.

Knowing what was on their minds, Yang Kai asked, “How many people can you send over here?”

These people looked at each other and appeared somewhat embarrassed. One of the Great Emperors cupped his fists and said, “True Monarch, I am from Three Brilliances World, and we can send about 40 people.”

Another Great Emperor said, “I’m from Golden Sun Continent, and we can send 35 people.”

…

In order to break free from a Universe World’s restraints, one had to be in the Third-Order Emperor Realm at the very least. Those with weaker cultivation could never accomplish this. As for how many Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters a Universe World could produce, one could look at the heritage of the Star Boundary as a reference. Both Three Brilliances World and Golden Sun Continent were Universe Worlds that were similar to the Star Boundary, so the fact that they had several dozen Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters was actually quite amazing.

If one wanted to ascend to the Open Heaven Realm in the future, they would need a lot of Open Heaven Pills. They could earn the pills by working for Yang Kai, so none of them were willing to miss this chance.

Every Universe World could only send several dozen people, ranging from 20 people to 70. When combined, there were some six or seven hundred people in total. It was similar to the number of people a Third Class great force could produce.

Yang Kai waved his hand and said, “It’s decided, then. Go back and get prepared now. You will receive the same pay. Everyone will earn two pills each day of work.”

All of them were elated as they saluted him, “Many thanks, True Monarch!”

Even though they were excited, they were not willing to stay any longer. After they were all gone, the Grand Hall fell into silence again.

The Third Class great forces like Golden Light Dock were truly efficient. In just one month, their disciples started arriving at Void Land. Coincidentally or not, the number of people who arrived were more than what had been promised.

Yang Kai didn’t really care about this as when it was time to repair the Grand Array, they would surely need many people, so there was no harm in getting more help now. He didn’t mind giving out more Open Heaven Pills.

Yue He was given the task to manage these people. The cultivators who were experts in Spirit Arrays immediately identified themselves and were sorted into a different group. When the time came, they could assist the Array Grandmaster hired by the Proprietress.

The wages were distributed daily, which made Hong Ji and the others feel even more grateful. After coming into contact with Yang Kai twice, they realised that he was far more benevolent than the previous Heavenly Monarch, which was why they quickly grew fond of him.

With so many people in Void Land, the place became bustling with noise once more. With that said, the Leaders of the respective great forces were strict with their disciples, so no fights or conflicts occurred.

One day, when Yang Kai was cultivating in seclusion, his expression changed as he looked at the abstruse pattern on the back of his hand. Previously, after he snatched the Innate Spirit Fruit in the Primordial Land, it exploded and transformed into this pattern, which contained a special space. Presently, Zhu Jiu Yin was sound asleep in it, but at this moment, Yang Kai could clearly feel signs she was stirring.

[She’s finally waking up!] Yang Kai felt emotionally exhausted. Initially, he thought that with a powerful Divine Spirit to protect him, even if he couldn’t walk sideways in the 3,000 Worlds, no one would dare to offend him at the very least.

However, as soon as they left the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, Zhu Jiu Yin fell into a kind of coma. Yang Kai had to personally battle against a great force like Scarlet Star, which made him feel exhausted.

A moment later, Zhu Jiu Yin awakened and spoke to Yang Kai via Divine Sense, “How long have I been asleep?”

“About three months,” Yang Kai replied and carefully checked on her. He realised that her aura was still weak, so it was apparent that the damage to her Source hadn’t been fully healed yet.

“Where’s this place?” Zhu Jiu Yin asked.

“It used to be called Seven Wonders Land, but it’s called Void Land now. It’s my territory.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he felt that the back of his hand became itchy. The next instant, a ray of light flew out of it and landed in front of him before Zhu Jiu Yin revealed herself. It had to be said that she was truly alluring. Not only was her face attractive, but she had a perfectly proportioned figure. Her eyes were as beautiful as a summer’s day. Presently, she was frowning due to the fact that her Source had been damaged, which made her look pitiful. No man could ever turn a blind eye to her.

After she appeared, the strange pattern on the back of Yang Kai’s hand dissipated. Following that, with Zhu Jiu Yin as the centre, a horrifying Divine Sense spread out.

At that instant, it was as though the world was about to end. A feeling of pure terror rose within everyone’s heart as the thousands of disciples from different great forces in Void Land turned ashen.

Hong Ji and the others widened their eyes and stared at the place where Yang Kai was cultivating in seclusion. All of their hair was standing on end, and they were utterly shocked and astonished.

However, the Divine Sense disappeared the next moment. Zhu Jiu Yin was just trying to scan her surroundings and didn’t have any malicious intent.

“What was that? An illusion?” Hong Ji and the others were still reeling from the shock.

Inside the secluded room, Zhu Jiu Yin shot a glance at Yang Kai and placed her palm on her forehead, “It seems that space has dissipated because this Queen has come out.”

A stunned Yang Kai asked, “Does that mean that I won’t be able to keep you inside it anymore?”

Zhu Jiu Yin nodded as she seemed to be suffering from a headache. Even her aura appeared unstable.

Yang Kai silently ground his teeth. Initially, he thought that after Zhu Jiu Yin recovered, he could carry her around like a trump card. Whenever he came across an opponent that he couldn’t defeat, he could just release her to deal with it.

However, the pattern and the space on the back of his hand had disappeared, which meant that his plans all came to nought. Thinking so, he felt dejected.

Yang Kai wondered if he could keep her inside the Six Fated Paths Bag, but even if he could, she might not agree to it. Although the space inside the bag was expandable, it always felt rather cramped.

“This Queen was born and raised in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Now that I’m in the outside world, I need a long time to adjust and adapt to the new Principles before I can display my peak strength. Before that happens, you’d better behave yourself and not offend people who are too powerful; otherwise, I won’t be able to protect you.”

An astounded Yang Kai asked, “How long will it take?” He had never thought about this before; however, after giving it a thought, he realised that it wasn’t so surprising. Although Zhu Jiu Yin was a Divine Spirit, she was a native of the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. Now that she had entered the 3,000 Worlds, she needed time to get used to it.

“Who knows?” Zhu Jiu Yin shook her head, “Moreover, my Source is damaged, so I need time to recuperate.”

Upon finishing her words, she disappeared from the spot as her voice drifted over into Yang Kai’s ears, “This Queen will enter seclusion. Do not bother me regardless unless it’s something life-threatening!”

Yang Kai clenched his teeth as his Protector didn’t seem to have the intention of protecting him at all. He was utterly regretful. If he knew this would be the outcome, he would’ve chosen to work with Jin Wu instead. At the very least, that guy could give him a Seventh-Order Metal Element treasure.

Following that, the door of the room was opened, and Yue He came in with a nervous expression, “Is she awake?”

Yang Kai nodded.

A puzzled Yue He asked, “Where is she?”

“She’s looking for somewhere to cultivate in seclusion. I’m not sure where she is,” Yang Kai replied.

Yue He closed her eyes and connected with the Grand Array to scan the seven Spirit Provinces. Soon, she found Zhu Jiu Yin’s whereabouts.

That woman directly entered the largest palace in Void Land. Presently, she seemed to be adjusting her breathing. Sensing someone’s eyes, she lifted her head and glared at her.

Yue He stuck out her tongue and retracted her gaze.

After a sigh, Yang Kai said, “It’s such a tragedy. Haaa!” Then, he sensed something and fished out an item. After that, he arched his brow, “Good news.”

A curious Yue He asked, “What is it?”

“Proprietress has arrived.” Yang Kai beamed. Following that, he rose from the chair and rushed towards the door; however, he soon realised something and turned his head, only to see that Yue He remained on the same spot with a pale face. Her hands were clenching her dress, and she appeared to be apprehensive.

Yang Kai approached her and took her hands before comforting her, “You have to face this eventually. Just apologise to her. Proprietress treasures her friends, so she won’t harm you.”

Yue He bit her lip and lowered her head.

“Come on. We’ll greet her together.” Yang Kai dragged her away.

Seeing Yang Kai, Hong Ji and the others hurriedly saluted him. Yang Kai didn’t have the time to make small talk with them though as he landed in an open space and looked up at the sky.

Soon, a ray of light passed through a gap in the Grand Array and landed on the ground. Following that, the ray of light disappeared and revealed several figures.

The woman at the front was clad in an imperial dress. She was elegant and charming. Seeing her, the male disciples from these Third Class great forces caught their breaths and drooled over her beauty. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

She was none other than the Proprietress!

Hong Ji and the others on the other hand sported solemn expressions. As Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters, they could clearly feel that this alluring woman was a peak Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master, far stronger than Yue He, who worked for the True Monarch.

Recently, they had finally figured out that Yue He was a Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, a powerful figure in the 3,000 Worlds. Since this woman was stronger than Yue He, she was most likely in the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm!

Besides the woman at the front, there were two Mid-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters whose auras were a match for that of Yue He. There was also a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master standing with them.

[Void True Monarch must have a powerful background. To think he has connections with these people. No wonder he can occupy Seven Wonders Land and become its new owner.]

While they were astounded, Yang Kai obediently rushed over and cupped his fists before saying loudly, “Greetings, Proprietress. How have you been?”

There was a faint smile on the Proprietress’ face as she stared fixedly at Yang Kai. Her breath was as pleasant as the scent of orchids, “Oh, you’re still alive.”

Yang Kai grinned, “Many thanks for your concern, Proprietress. I’m still alive and kicking.”

“En, you’re indeed alive and kicking, but… This Great Aunt doesn’t feel very good about it!” The Proprietress said through clenched teeth and grabbed his collars before proceeding to beat him up.

Hong Ji and the others were horrified as they felt their throats tightening.
