When he said this, the corners of Chi Huo’s mouth twitched, as even he felt that Wei Feng was not worthy of holding Su Yan’s shoes.

However, this was indeed a good opportunity to deal a blow to Ice Heart Valley; as long as Ice Heart Valley could be forced to compromise here, then Brilliant Flame Sect would have the upper hand in all future battles.

The most important point was that he could use this incident to attack Luo Li’s state of mind and act contrary to her convictions.

Once this happened, it would surely become a heart demon for Luo Li and halt her cultivation in place.

After that, once he could advance his own cultivation, under the current circumstances, Scarlet Wave Star would belong to Brilliant Flame Sect.

As soon as Chi Huo’s voice fell, Ran Yun Ting took a step forward and coldly declared, “In your dreams! Su Yan is my Ice Heart Valley’s Core Disciple, how could she be allowed to marry an outsider? She will always be an Ice Heart Valley disciple!”

Chi Huo snickered as he stared at Ran Yun Ting and said, “If this old master isn’t mistaken, what she has cultivated should be your Ice Heart Valley’s Ice Jade Secret Art, right?”

“So what?” Ran Yun Ting did not know what he was thinking.

“If so, then this will be simple. This old master can see her heart has been moved, and her Ice Jade Heart stained, causing her to receive backlash from the Secret Art. This backlash also seems quite serious... En, in her situation, I’m certain that within a year or two her cultivation will completely scatter, and she will become an ordinary mortal. What use will she have for your Ice Heart Valley then?”

Ran Yun Ting’s face changed slightly as she was shocked by Chi Huo’s shrewdness.

Su Yan’s situation had been concealed very carefully, and only she, her Master, truly knew its full extent, but it only took Chi Huo a glance to properly assess Su Yan’s condition.

For a moment, Ran Yun Ting’s face became extremely gloomy and she shot a look filled with disappointment towards Su Yan.

However, Su Yan turned a blind eye to this, not even changing her expression, still just smiling happily as she stood there cuddling next to Yang Kai, as if her cultivation and strength meant nothing to her. As long as she could be with Yang Kai, even death was worth it.

Ran Yun Ting was even more disappointed.

“Su Yan...” Yang Kai was stunned and turned to the beautiful woman standing next to him with worried eyes.

Quickly releasing his Divine Sense and scanning Su Yan’s body, he finally noticed something wrong.

Su Yan’s aura was indeed fluctuating slightly, which was obviously an outward sign of her receiving backlash from her Secret Art. The situation was still manageable now, but if it was allowed to continue, it would definitely get worse.

“It’s fine,” Su Yan smiled softly, remaining perfectly calm, not worrying about this seemingly inevitable fate at all.

“I will find a way to resolve it for you,” Yang Kai took a deep breath and promised her solemnly.

“Kill yourself here and now and you can solve the problem immediately!” Ran Yun Ting burst into anger and shouted at Yang Kai.

“Honoured Master, please don’t say such things!” The smile on Su Yan’s face suddenly disappeared as she frowned and declared seriously, “If Junior Brother dies, I will immediately follow him!”

Ran Yun Ting opened her mouth and stared at Su Yan in a daze, showing an expression of astonishment.

It was the first time Su Yan used such a tone of voice to speak to her, which shocked Ran Yun Ting greatly. Su Yan had always been obedient to her; no matter her command, this disciple would complete the task with absolute certainty, making her extremely satisfied. This, in turn, raised Su Yan’s value in her eyes.

But today, her impression wavered.

It was as if all the work she put into teaching her and the great expectations she had for her, as her Honoured Master, were not as important as this little brat in her heart.

Ran Yun Ting’s face became cold and gloomy as she glared at Yang Kai and said in a deep tone, “Boy, you’ve destroyed Su Yan’s future, even if you die here, you won’t be able to redeem your sin!”

After speaking, she backed away and closed her eyes, as if she did not want to interfere with what would surely happen next.

“I’ve destroyed Senior Sister’s future? That is not something you get to decide, what the hell do you count for?” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

“Good, this farce ends here!” Chi Huo stood up, his eyes burning like flames as he turned to Luo Li, “This old master has explained his intentions. Luo Li, it is your choice, if you agree, this old master can retreat, if you don’t...”

There was an obvious threat in his words.

Many Elders of Ice Heart Valley wore anxious looks.

Luo Li looked at Chi Huo faintly, then turned to look at Luo Hai and lightly opened her lips and asked, “Is this Sir Luo Hai’s will as well?”

She knew better than anyone that Chi Huo daring to come to Pure Ice Island in such a bold manner this time and even pretentiously asking for the Sect’s best disciple was all because of Luo Hai’s backing!

Without Luo Hai, Chi Huo would not even dare to set foot within a thousand kilometres of Pure Ice Island.

Luo Hai smiled at this and said mildly, “Junior Sister Luo Li’s words are a bit unreasonable. This matter is between your Ice Heart Valley and Chi Huo’s Brilliant Flame Sect. This King is just here to enjoy the show, that’s all.”

Having said so though, Luo Hai continued, “However, this King feels that what Chi Huo said isn’t wrong. This disciple called Su Yan truly has good aptitude, but since she is suffering from the backlash of your Ice Jade Secret Art, I’m afraid it will be difficult for her to achieve anything of note in the future. As such, it would be better to marry her to Wei Feng so your two Sects can become in-laws, allowing you a chance to resolve your long-standing grievances. Wouldn’t it be best if you could all live in harmony in the future?”

Hearing what he said, Luo Li’s face grew dark as she knew that Luo Hai was standing on Brilliant Flame Sect’s side.

As for becoming in-laws and resolving the grievances between the two factions... that was nothing but sophistry.

The two Sects had fought for dominance of Scarlet Wave Star for thousands of years, and the grievances between them had been forged in oceans of blood, making them absolutely impossible to resolve. In this world, there would never be peace between Ice Heart Valley and Brilliant Flame Sect. The two Sects were destined to be enemies until the day one of them was destroyed.

“I understand,” Luo Li gently nodded and closed her limpid pupils, apparently caught in a difficult decision.

No one disturbed her, but all the Elders of Ice Heart Valley had their eyes fixed on her, wondering what answer she would give.

Luo Hai had a calm and relaxed face as he quietly sipped his tea. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Chi Huo wore a triumphant look, as he laughed under his breath constantly.

He was not afraid that Luo Li would refuse. This time, he was taking advantage of Luo Hai’s prestige to crush Ice Heart Valley’s morale. As for the girl named Su Yan, she was just a pawn in their battle.

Without Su Yan, there was Zhang Yan, Wang Yan... With so many female disciples in Ice Heart Valley, how could he not find a suitable candidate?

Wei Feng did not howl anymore. At this time, he was like a cat smelling fish and his eyes brightened as they darted back and forth. Although he still felt pain in his cheeks, he still gazed at Su Yan lustfully, like she was some kind of new toy he was about to acquire and could play with all he wanted.

In his heart, he was secretly pondering how he would torture this woman named Su Yan to teach Yang Kai the price for incurring his wrath.

Yang Kai and Su Yan stood side by side in the middle of the ice palace, as if they were outsiders.

No one cared about their feelings or opinions. In such high-level dialogue, the two of them had no right to speak.

The happiness in Su Yan’s beautiful eyes was dimmed with a tinge of sorrow, and the small hand she used to hold Yang Kai’s became harder.

She secretly decided that if Supreme Elder really compromised, then she would use her life to create an opportunity for Yang Kai to escape! As for herself, even if she died, she couldn’t go to Brilliant Flame Sect.

Yang Kai looked on with cold eyes, as if this matter had nothing to do with him, carefully observing the changes in Luo Li’s expression.

After a while, he let out a sigh and whispered in Su Yan’s ear, “Senior Sister, do you trust me?”

Su Yan did not even hesitate to nod.

“Good,” Yang Kai smiled warmly, “Junior Brother assures you that no one will take you away today. If they dare have such thoughts, I’ll make sure that they will all end up inside a coffin!”

“Then Senior Sister will wait and see,” Su Yan winked to Yang Kai.

This playful appearance made Yang Kai dumbfounded for a moment. He had never seen such a side to Su Yan before. It seemed that because of the great crisis, she dared to do things that she would never do before.

Although the two people spoke softly, how could they hide their conversation from Luo Hai and Chi Huo?

Hearing Yang Kai’s bold claims, the two Origin Kings both shot Yang Kai a disdainful look.

“Luo Li, it’s time to make a decision,” Luo Hai urged impatiently.

He was anxious to bring Yang Kai back to Green Mountains Star and extract all of his secrets. He was unwilling to delay time here.

Luo Li opened her eyes, and for an instant, all eyes inside the ice palace focused on her.

First, Luo Li turned to look at Su Yan, and a faint light of guilt flitted across her eyes, but that disappeared in a flash.

“You may take her away; I hope you can treat her well in the future!” Luo Li’s aura instantly deflated, as if it was punctured, with even her face going pale.

Obviously, making such a concession had violated her principles and caused her injuries to worsen.

“Supreme Elder...” Ran Yun Ting called out.

Although she had already guessed this would happen, she still could not accept Supreme Elder’s answer in the end. After shouting unconsciously though, she could not say anything anymore, just turning a regretful look towards Su Yan and sighing, “This is your own choice, don’t regret it in the future!”

At this moment, she ultimately decided to abandon Su Yan.

She had no way to resolve the flaw in Su Yan’s cultivation, so even if she could safeguard her here today, Su Yan’s cultivation would at best halt where it was. For such a disciple, it was not worth putting all of Ice Heart Valley in danger. Not to mention, she couldn’t violate Luo Li’s orders even if she wanted to.

Forcing the entire Sect into perdition for Su Yan would make her an eternal sinner to Ice Heart Valley.

Ran Yun Ting would not do such a thing, as it was obvious that no single disciple was more important than the Sect itself.

She closed her eyes to avoid looking at Su Yan again.

“Good!” Chi Huo laughed.

After so many years, he had finally completely suppressed Luo Li and made her back down in front of him. Although all of this was based on Luo Hai’s strength and status, the result was what Chi Huo wanted to see most.
