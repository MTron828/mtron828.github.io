“There are three great mantras in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and the Myriad Law Mantra is one of them. However, this mantra is too profound as it requires a lot of people to sing it together to be of any use. It’s not harmful in any way, but it has an amazing effect on soothing one’s mind,” Yu Xiang Die explained.

Yang Kai nodded in response. He recalled that his mind was indeed completely at ease when he sang the Myriad Law Mantra just now.

In any case, he was already a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Son-in-Law, so he was considered a member of the Sect. Whether or not he chanted the Myriad Law Mantra wouldn’t change anything.

They went on to wait for a few days more before Luo Ting He could finally gain some measure of control over her power.

The Sect Master of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven led a group of High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters to stand before Luo Ting He and salute her, “Greetings, Ancestor!”

Luo Ting He walked up to him and grabbed his long beard with a smile, “Junior Brother Zuo, we haven’t met for ages. Why is your beard so long now?”

Zuo Qiu Ming’s face twitched as he felt helpless in his heart. Many years had passed, but this Senior Sister was still as willful as ever. Only Senior Brother Sun was able to put her in her place, but he passed away 2,000 years ago. Now, no fellow Brothers of the same generation could discipline her.

Furthermore, she was now an Eighth-Order Ancestor.

“Ancestor Luo, my name is Zuo Qiu, not Zuo,” the Sect Master refuted meekly.

“What’s the difference?” Luo Ting He patted the Sect Master’s shoulder; however, since she had just achieved an ascension, she still couldn’t fully control her power. Her pat caused Zuo Qiu Ming’s shoulder to sink quite noticeably.

The brows of the Seventh-Order Elders behind him twitched.

Luo Ting He suddenly leaned close to him and winked, “Junior Brother Zuo, where are your little lovers? Why are none of them here? In the past, you’d always walk around with several women beside you, looking quite pleased with yourself.”

Upon hearing that, the Elders were stunned.

Many people were not aware of the Sect Master’s love affairs in the past. He always appeared solemn nowadays, and everyone respected him as the Sect Master. Hence, no one could have expected that he used to be a lascivious person.

At this moment, they couldn’t help but let their thoughts run wild after listening to what Luo Ting He had said.

A flushing Zuo Qiu Ming refuted, “Please do not slander me, Ancestor Luo. I’m now the Sect Master of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and I represent the Sect’s face. If these words are spread to outsiders, it will cause a misunderstanding and tarnish Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s reputation.”

Luo Ting He started counting with her fingers, “Let me see… When you were fifteen, you were in love with Senior Sister Zhou who was three years older than you were. Then, you fell in love with someone else. That little girl came to me and bawled her eyes out. It was quite annoying actually. When you were twenty, you got together with Senior Sister Zhang who was ten years older than you were. The relationship only lasted for a few months. Oh, after you ascended to the Emperor Realm, there was Martial Aunt Tan…”

Zuo Qiu Ming’s expression darkened as Luo Ting He spoke, and at the mention of Martial Aunt Tan, he couldn’t take it anymore as he put on a smile and cut her off by saying, “You have such a good memory, Senior Sister, and you look just as beautiful as in the past!”

Luo Ting He looked smilingly at him and gave him another pat, “There you go! Why did you even call me Ancestor? I wiped your backside countless times when you were a baby, don’t you think it’s awkward for you to call me Ancestor?”

“Whatever you say, Senior Sister!” Zuo Qiu Ming wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, “Anyways, you’re an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master now, so you’re indeed a Supreme Elder of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Please come to my place when you’re free as I have to help you to go through the registration process to leave your name on the ancestral records. You’ll receive the treatment that an Ancestor deserves.”

A nonchalant Luo Ting He replied, “Fine fine, I’ll look for you when I’m free. Later!”

Upon finishing her words, she shuffled towards Yu Xiang Die and gave her a signal with her eyes. Then, she engulfed Yu Xiang Die with her power and left.

After they were gone, Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang traded glances.

“Respects to the Ancestor!” Zuo Qiu Ming saluted her, and the others followed suit.

All of a sudden, an Elder behind him asked, “You like older women, Sect Master?”

Zuo Qiu Ming ran his fingers through his beard and replied impassively, “Junior Brother Wang, you joined the Sect at a later time, so you’re not aware of Ancestor Luo’s temperament. You don’t have to take her words seriously.”

Just when Junior Brother Wang wanted to ask more questions, Zuo Qiu Ming turned to look at Yang Kai and Qu Hua Shang, “You two, come with me. Elder Chen, bring your Disciple as well.”

Chen Xiu, who wasn’t far away from them, bent his back, “Yes.”

Yang Kai instantly figured out that Zuo Qiu Ming was going to talk about the marriage with him.

After the Open Heaven Realm Masters were done with witnessing Luo Ting He’s ascension, they soon left; however, this piece of exciting news would cause a sensation within Yin-Yang Cave Heaven for quite a long time.

Yang Kai took Qu Hua Shang’s hand as they followed Zuo Qiu Ming. Chen Xiu brought Tao Ling Wan to follow after them, then took the initiative to say, “Nephew Yang!”

“Elder Chen.” Yang Kai nodded in response, then flashed a smile at Tao Ling Wan, “Junior Sister Tao.”

He was not fond of Chen Xiu, but he felt a sense of shame when facing Tao Ling Wan. Perhaps he knew that he was unable to give her anything and thus felt guilty.

A blushing Tao Ling Wan called out in a small voice, “Senior Brother Yang.”

Qu Hua Shang glowered at Yang Kai, “I’ve been wondering. Why are you taking advantage of her?”

An aggrieved Yang Kai refuted, “What do you mean ‘taking advantage of her’?”

Qu Hua Shang reasoned with him, “In the Sect, Senior Sister Tao is my Senior Sister, so how can you call her Junior Sister? Do you want to call me Junior Sister as well?”

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai was lost for words.

Tao Ling Wan was the one who called him Senior Brother first, and he just followed along. He didn’t intend to take advantage of her in any way. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Qu Hua Shang shot him another glare, then brushed past him and walked up to Tao Ling Wan before taking the other woman’s hand, “Senior Sister Tao, you have to be wary of him. He now takes advantage of you by calling you Junior Sister, and he might bully you in the future. If he really does that, you have to tell me about it. I’ll stand up for you.”

With a reddened face, Tao Ling Wan hung her head low, “No.”

It wasn’t certain what she meant by that.

Qu Hua Shang hadn’t frequently come into contact with Tao Ling Wan in the past, but she was aware that this Senior Sister was a bashful person. According to her observation, Tao Ling Wan was identical to Qian Qian, who served Meng Ru in their first reincarnation.

She couldn’t help but feel sympathetic towards this innocent Senior Sister.

Presently, Chen Xiu was walking alongside Yang Kai. He turned his head to look at Qu Hua Shang and Tao Ling Wan, then said with a smile, “Martial Niece Qu is a magnanimous person. Nephew Yang, I’m not sure if you’ll be the same.”

Yang Kai asked, “What do you mean, Elder Chen?”

Chen Xiu let out a sigh, “What’s the point of playing dumb, Martial Nephew? This Chen was indeed selfish previously, but I meant no harm. I understand that you have some grudges against me, and I don’t intend to defend myself; however, Wan’er’s future hinges on you now, so I hope that you’ll give this issue some serious thought. I would die with no regrets as long as she can obtain the happiness she deserves.”

Yang Kai frowned but didn’t respond to him.

Seeing that Yang Kai was unwilling to speak, Chen Xiu knew that the other man was resentful of him. It would only create the opposite of the desired outcome if he kept talking.

A moment later, they arrived at a Grand Hall atop a Spirit Province following the Sect Master’s lead. It was supposed to be the place where the Sect Master dealt with his daily business.

After they were all seated, a disciple of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven came over to serve tea.

It was the first time Yang Kai dealt with the Sect Master of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. Be it the incident regarding Dao Theory Assembly or the Samsara Pavilion, this Sect Master of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had never shown up; therefore, Yang Kai wasn’t certain about the older man’s temperament.

As the Sect Master, it was expected that Zuo Qiu Ming was stern. This was how most people who were in powerful positions behaved. He gave off a sense of authority without the need to say anything.

What surprised Yang Kai was that Zuo Qiu Ming suddenly rose from the chair and saluted him.

A flabbergasted Yang Kai quickly stood up, “What are you doing, Sect Master? I don’t deserve this.”

Zuo Qiu Ming slowly straightened his back and said, “I salute you because I want to thank you on behalf of everyone in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven for saving Ancestor Luo from the Samsara Pavilion.”

The person Yang Kai had saved wasn’t just someone who had ascended to the Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm, but also a talented genius who had the chance to make it to the Ninth-Order one day.

It was profoundly meaningful to everyone in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.

Yang Kai waved his hand, “It just happened by chance. I wasn’t even aware that Martial Aunt Luo was trapped inside the Samsara Pavilion. The only reason I entered the Samsara Pavilion was to look for Senior Sister Qu.”

As he spoke, he took a glance at Qu Hua Shang.

Zuo Qiu Ming nodded, “I’m aware of what’s going on between you and Martial Niece Qu. It was inconsiderate of Elder Chen to do such a thing, but I hope that you’ll forgive him.”

Yang Kai replied impassively, “Elder Chen already told me about it.”

He suddenly realised that Chen Xiu must have gotten permission from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s management before making such a move. In other words, Zuo Qiu Ming was aware of Chen Xiu’s plan at that time, but he didn’t try to stop him.

From his perspective, he would support anything that would save Yin-Yang Cave Heaven’s face, and it had nothing to do with his own honour.

“Now that you’ve brought Martial Niece Qu out of the Samsara Pavilion, it shows that the love between you two is true. The couples who can pass the test of the Samsara Pavilion in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven always become partners for life.”

Yang Kai said humbly, “The reason I’ve come to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven is to marry Senior Sister Qu.”

Zuo Qiu Ming bowed his head, “Good. Since you have the intention to get together with her, I’ll not beat around the bush. So, when you plan on marrying her?”

Yang Kai replied frankly, “I haven’t considered it yet. Sect Master, to be honest with you, I already have several partners that have stayed by my side for years before I met Senior Sister Qu, and I haven’t married any of them yet. Now, due to various reasons, they are cultivating in a number of different places. I want to wait for them to gather together one day and marry them all at once.”

Zuo Qiu Ming nodded, “It’s normal for a man to have three wives and four concubines. There must be a good reason why so many women have fallen in love with you. We don’t stick to archaic rules in Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, and I don’t really care about such personal matters. I’m sure Martial Niece Qu wouldn’t mind it either.”
