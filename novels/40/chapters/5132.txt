“That’s the Black Ink Clan!?”

Hiding on an inconspicuous asteroid, Miao Fei Ping’s eyes widened as he stared at the group of Black Ink Clansmen flying across the void before his eyes, thinking to himself, [it’s just as the Senior Brothers said, the Black Ink Clan is filled with all kinds of strange creatures.]

He saw giant figures in the group of several hundred Black Ink Clansmen, some of whom were humanoid, but most had parts that looked like they were from Monster Beasts. To his surprise, there were some Black Ink Clansmen who looked exactly like a Monster Beast.

However, no matter what form they took, the bodies of these Black Ink Clansmen were all surging with Black Ink Strength. The places they passed by were stained with Black Ink Strength, as if they left spilling ink that could not be removed.

Miao Fei Ping couldn’t help but gulp as he turned to look at Yang Kai.

There were quite a lot in this Black Ink Clan team, so he didn’t know how Yang Kai was planning on dealing with them. Was he going to attack them or wait and watch?

Had Mao Fei Ping been alone, he probably wouldn’t have been able to conceal his aura at this close a distance and might have been discovered by the Black Ink Clan; however, with Yang Kai by his side and with his help, his aura had been completely concealed. Furthermore, as there was a certain distance between them, the Black Ink Clan didn’t notice two pairs of eyes watching them from the shadows.

“This should be a Feudal Lord’s private troops,” Yang Kai whispered. From his observations, he could clearly tell that there were four or five Feudal Lords in this group of several hundred Black Ink Clansmen, while the rest were High-Rank and Low-Rank Black Ink Clansmen.

This was in line with the intelligence he had obtained about Black Ink Clan Fiefs Zha Gu had shared with him.

“Where are they going?” Miao Fei Ping asked, a little puzzled. Judging by the direction this Black Ink Clan army was heading, they weren’t travelling towards Blue Sky Pass.

“They should have received some kind of order from this region’s Territory Lord to assemble with the other Feudal Lord forces before attacking Blue Sky Pass,” Yang Kai explained.

Miao Fei Ping understood, “Martial Uncle, I heard from the Senior Brothers that each Territory Lord has dozens to a few hundred Feudal Lords under their command, is that correct?”

This piece of information was brought back by Yang Kai and had long since spread throughout the various Great Passes, so it wasn’t strange for Miao Fei Ping to have learned about it from the other members of Dawn Squad.

Yang Kai affirmed, nodding, “Correct.”

Miao Fei Ping was slightly surprised, “In that case, a Territory Lord can easily gather tens of thousands of troops during a battle?”

The Feudal Lord’s troops in front of him numbered in the hundreds, so if there were one or two hundred such troops, naturally, the total would easily surpass 10,000.

Yang Kai nodded again, “If not, where do you think the millions of troops during the Black Ink Clan sieges come from? It comes from the gathering of all these Feudal Lord troops.”

Miao Fei Ping couldn’t help but gasp in shock.

How many soldiers were there in each of the Great Passes? Forget about the other Great Passes, just Blue Sky Pass only had some 30,000 cultivators in total. It was probably the same for other Great Passes too, but the Black Ink Clan had an army of at least a million strong in every Theatre.

Although he knew that most of the Black Ink Clan army was composed of cannon fodder made up of Low-Rank Clansmen, the difference in numbers was still too great.

For a time, Miao Fei Ping found it difficult to imagine just how the Human Race had managed to resist the Black Ink Clan for so many years.

If Yang Kai wanted to, he could have charged forward and killed this army of Black Ink Clansmen, but as he had Miao Fei Ping accompanying him, it wasn’t convenient for him to act; after all, he couldn’t protect Miao Fei Ping in such an environment.

As such, after watching the Feudal Lord’s troops leave and noting their direction, Yang Kai gently patted Miao Fei Ping’s shoulder, “Let’s go.”

Miao Fei Ping quickly followed after him.

Soon, he discovered that Yang Kai was moving in the opposite direction of the Feudal Lord’s troops.

He was quite sharp and guessed where they were going, “Martial Uncle, are we going to that Feudal Lord’s Fief?”

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, “Why do you think so?”

Miao Fei Ping replied, “The Feudal Lord’s troops came from this direction, so his territory must be in this direction. Since Martial Uncle hasn’t changed directions, do you want to take advantage of his absence to storm the enemy’s den?”

Yang Kai stated meaningfully, “Not me, you!”

“Me?” Miao Fei Ping was beside himself in shock.

Yang Kai suddenly raised his head and grinned, looking towards a direction, “Just our luck, there are two Black Ink Clansmen alone, go practice with them first.”

Saying so, he reached out and grabbed Miao Fei Ping’s collar before tossing him forward while he was unprepared.

Miao Fei Ping let out a strange cry as he was instantly thrown far away. By the time he managed to stabilize himself, the two Black Ink Clansmen in front of him were staring at him with shock and ferocity. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Human!”

“Sixth-Order!”

“Corrupt him!”

After a brief exchange, the two Black Ink Clansmen attacked Miao Fei Ping from both sides.

Miao Fei Ping’s face went pale in fright and he quickly summoned his long sword as he mobilized his strength, creating a sword curtain to ward off the attackers.

As soon as they clashed, Miao Fei Ping fell into a disadvantageous position. He discovered that these two were High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen, and each of them was comparable to a Sixth-Order Human Master.

Miao Fei Ping believed that he could easily take care of either of them in a one-on-one fight, but with both of them attacking him together, it would be difficult for him to handle. After all, he had just advanced to the Sixth Order and had only been an Emperor Realm a year ago. As such, he wasn’t very proficient in utilizing his Open Heaven Realm strength yet.

The two Black Ink Clan Masters didn’t employ any tactics, they just kept bombarding him with Secret Techniques using their Black Ink Strength, aiming to overwhelm him. What caused Miao Fei Ping even more pressure was that the Black Ink Strength was actually invading his Small Universe, forcing him to divert some of his attention and strength to resist its corrosion.

No matter what others had told Miao Fei Ping about the Black Ink Clan, facing them first-hand was far more informative than any evaluations he had heard before.

Miao Fei Ping finally understood what kind of enemies the Human Race had been fighting for countless years.

He couldn’t sense his Martial Uncle’s aura, nor could he find his figure, but he knew that his Martial Uncle was definitely hiding somewhere close by, so he knew that his life was not in danger.

Thinking so, Miao Fei Ping became more daring.

Taking advantage of one of the Black Ink Clansman’s mistakes in coordination, the sword in Miao Fei Ping’s hands flashed as he rushed forward, his figure wrapped in sword light. His momentum was unstoppable, as if he wanted to perish together with this Black Ink Clansman.

The targeted Black Ink Clansman was shocked. He had never imagined Miao Fei Ping would suddenly become so fierce, as if he had turned into a completely different person. Unable to react in time, he was stabbed in the head by the sword and died on the spot.

However, the other Black Ink Clansman’s attack was already upon Miao Fei Ping, who was now completely powerless to defend himself. The sudden death of his companion had enraged this Black Ink Clansman, so he didn’t show any mercy.

A Black Ink Disciple might be precious, but he still needed to be alive to enjoy having him. Basically, he was not completely sure that he would be able to corrupt Miao Fei Ping without his companion’s help.

Since he was not 100% certain, he could only send Miao Fei Ping to his grave.

However, the space around him suddenly solidified, causing his massive body to freeze on the spot. Although it was only a brief moment, he had missed the opportunity to kill his opponent.

Miao Fei Ping had already steadied himself and the sword in his hand glowed with an exquisite aura as his figure moved, flying up and down around the Black Ink Clansman, drawing blood with every strike.

He knew that his Martial Uncle must have secretly taken action just now; otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to block the attack of the second Black Ink Clansman.

Be that as it may, his Martial Uncle clearly had no intention of interfering further, and this was exactly what he wanted. Flowers grown in a greenhouse could not withstand the harsh winds and rain of the outside world and were destined to not live long. Only after experiencing real storms would they be able to thrive.

Although he was only a newly promoted Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, Miao Fei Ping’s confidence had greatly increased after his first kill. Moreover, he was quickly adapting to his strength during this life-and-death struggle.

As such, an incense stick after the death of the first Black Ink Clansman, the second followed in his companion’s footsteps.

Miao Fei Ping stood in the void with his sword in hand, his face slightly pale and his aura a little unstable.

Killing two High-Rank Black Ink Clansmen who were comparable to Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters was quite exhausting, and it took a clear toll on him.

Yang Kai suddenly appeared in front of him and lightly nodded his acknowledgement, “Not bad.”

Miao Fei Ping withdrew his sword and humbly stated, “Martial Uncle is too kind. If it weren’t for Martial Uncle secretly taking action, this Disciple would have already died. However, Martial Uncle, this Disciple seems to have been invaded by Black Ink Strength and is unable to suppress it.”

“I know,” Yang Kai slightly nodded. Miao Fei Ping’s entire body was shrouded in a thick layer of Black Ink Strength and the dark look in his eyes could not be hidden, “There’s no need to suppress it, just open yourself and allow it in.”

Miao Fei Ping was slightly startled, but he still complied.

In less than a dozen breaths of time, Miao Fei Ping suddenly let out a shout before thrusting his sword at Yang Kai with a flick of his wrist.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and caught the longsword between his fingers. Miao Fei Ping roared as he tried to pull his sword back, but it didn’t budge in the slightest. He decisively let go of the sword and rushed forward like a madman, punching at Yang Kai, fist images blotting out the void before he even reached his target.

Yang Kai simply waved his hand and the fist shadows filling the void disappeared like the Moon’s reflection in the water.

Surprisingly, Miao Fei Ping had disappeared from Yang Kai’s sight. He had already fled into the distance the moment he swung his fists. His speed was extremely fast. It appeared his fierce attack was just a cover for his escape.

Yang Kai grinned and muttered, “Smart choice!”

Be that as it may, trying to escape from him was destined to be futile.

Yang Kai used his Space Principles, and under the effects of Near Distant Horizon, Miao Fei Ping suddenly froze in place, seemingly unable to escape even half a step further.

Yang Kai slowly strolled over to Miao Fei Ping’s back. His palms glowed with two different colours before he brought them together, releasing a burst of Purifying Light.

Under the Purifying Light, the Black Ink Strength started dispersing with sizzling sounds as Miao Fei Ping’s expression changed from pained to calm.

When the Black Ink Strength was finally dispersed completely and Miao Fei Ping regained his sanity, he found that his clothes were drenched in sweat.

“How do you feel?” Yang Kai asked.

Miao Fei Ping had a look of lingering fear on his face, “Like I’ve awoken from a bad dream!”

Yang Kai nodded, “Every Black Ink Disciple says so when they wake up. Remember this feeling, this is what it’s like to be corrupted by Black Ink Strength. In the Black Ink Disciples’ hearts, the Black Ink Clan is supreme, and the Human Race is nothing to them.”

Miao Fei Ping broke into a cold sweat, “Disciple will remember this lesson well. In the future, I will definitely not let myself be corrupted into a Black Ink Disciple and become a slave to the Black Ink Clan.” Pausing for a moment, he apologized, “Disciple was disrespectful to Martial Uncle just now, please forgive me.”

Yang Kai waved off in response, “It would have been stranger if you hadn’t attacked me.”
