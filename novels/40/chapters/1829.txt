After squabbling with Gui Zu for a long time, Yang Kai finally got him to return those Spirit Devouring Crystals. In exchange, he would ask Little Senior Sister to refine a few Origin King Grade pills for him after returning to High Heaven Sect.

How would Gui Zu know that Little Senior Sister could refine Origin King Grade pills easily? With her natural talent, she could refine pills with less effort than ordinary alchemists, so it was as simple a matter as asking. If he came to know this, he would probably call Yang Kai cunning and insidious.

Gui Zu brought back forty to fifty Spirit Devouring Crystals, all of which were smashed by Yang Kai, returning their energy to this world.

Tong Xuan Realm was already connected to the entire Star Field and could continuously absorb the energy of stars. With Xia Ning Chang as its Star Master, it would surely prosper again in time.

Next, Yang Kai summoned Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai from their retreat and gave a Transmission Token refined by him. He asked them to take good care of Nine Heavens Holy Land and enter the Space Array with the Transmission Token, reporting to Azure Tree Star, if Tong Xuan Realm was in a crisis due to outsiders again.

The two had just advanced to Saint King Realm. They weren’t that strong, and as such, Yang Kai left a Blood Beast just to be on the safe side. Naturally, it was the Steel Flame Ghost Spider that had reached the Tenth-Order. Although the Steel Flame Ghost Spider’s strength had declined slightly after being refined into a Blood Beast, anyone below the Origin King Realm was not its opponent. Even if it was up against an Origin King, it could still deal with the situation.

With the Steel Flame Ghost Spider guarding the Nine Heavens Holy Land, Yang Kai could finally rest assured and leave.

After he left Shadowed Star, he had arranged several Cross-Cultivation Star Space Arrays along the road, completely connecting Shadowed Star with his homeland. In the future, it would be extremely convenient to go back and forth or to another Cultivation Star.

This was just the beginning. Yang Kai’s plan was to spread the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array throughout the Star Field so that every prosperous Cultivation Star would be connected.

However, this was a time-consuming and laborious project. More importantly, it needed a lot of Space Spirit Crystals, so Yang Kai wasn’t in a hurry.

After arranging the matters of Tong Xuan Realm, Yang Kai stepped into the Space Array with Gui Zu, poured in his Saint Qi, and activated the Spirit Array.

Meanwhile, Lin Yu Hao and Yi Zheng Kai respectfully sent them off.

Azure Tree Star, Twin Shark Island, Yang Kai’s palace...

He Zao and He Miao sisters were sitting cross-legged in the depths of the palace, facing each other. The two sisters had no idea how profound the Secret Art they were cultivating was. As their palm came in contact with each other, their Saint Qi met and circulated non-stop in their bodies. Meanwhile, the World Energy outside kept pouring into their acupoints.

There was no wind blowing in the hall, yet their hair was dancing and their clothes were flapping continuously.

At this time, the Cross-Cultivation Star Space Array in the main hall gave off strange noises as it bloomed with a dazzling white glow.

He Zao and He Miao were instantly jolted in shock. They opened their pretty eyes and immediately stood up, looking towards the Array.

“Someone came from Shadowed Star again,” He Zao said, pondering. Ever since Yang Kai left with Luo Lan, cultivators of the High Heaven Sect kept arriving from Shadowed Star. All of them were at the peak of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, and one had even reached the Origin King Realm. The sisters gradually realized the power and heritage of the High Heaven Sect, feeling proud to be a member of such a Sect. Now, when they saw the Spirit Array up and running again, He Zao suddenly thought that someone was coming from High Heaven Sect again.

As soon as her voice fell, two vague figures appeared in the centre of the Array and slowly grew distinct with time. After the white light dissipated, Yang Kai and Gui Zu appeared at the same time.

“Ah, it’s Brother Yang Kai!” He Miao cried in joy.

The nearby He Zao immediately knocked her head and rebuked, “It’s Sect Master!”

He Miao stuck out her tongue, showing a coy expression.

The two sisters came to Yang Kai, elegantly bowed, and greeted with joy, “Greetings, Sect Master!”

“Are you on duty here?” Yang Kai looked around and asked with a smile.

“Yes,” He Zao replied with a sweet smile.

“Thank you.” Yang Kai nodded gently to her.

Gui Zu recovered from the long-distance teleportation only now. He shook his head and complained, looking ill at ease, “It was really uncomfortable, I felt like I was going to be swallowed by the void.”

Even someone as strong as he felt uncomfortable during this kind of super-long-distance teleportation. As for those with weaker cultivation than his, it would take them a good long while to recover and stabilize their aura after each teleportation. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

If anyone stepped into the Space Array without the Transmission Token specifically refined by Yang Kai, they would be banished into the endless void, unable to find their way forever.

“He is...” He Zao looked at Gui Zu with a frown. Gui Zu was radiating a sinister and loathsome aura. It made her extremely uncomfortable. In just one glance, she could tell that he was far from good. She didn’t understand how Yang Kai could mingle with someone like him.

“Heh heh, are these two little girls your Sect’s disciples?” Gui Zu asked before Yang Kai could explain.

“Mhmm, He Zao, He Miao, and their master, Yue Xi, have been accepted into the High Heaven Sect by me,” answered Yang Kai, nodding his head. While answering, he beckoned to He Zao and He Miao and said, “Come and greet Supreme Elder.”

“Supreme Elder!?” He Zao and He Miao were shocked. They hadn’t expected this old guy with such a detestable aura to actually be their Sect’s Supreme Elder.

But since Yang Kai had said so, there would naturally be no mistake.

They immediately converged their thoughts, bowed and greeted Gui Zu earnestly, “Disciple greets Supreme Elder!”

“Hahaha!” Gui Zu suddenly started laughing like crazy. He looked very proud. He forced a kind smile, raised his hand, and said, “Relax, relax! You girls are pretty good. Well, since we are meeting for the first time, this Old Man will have to give you some gifts.”

“Ah!?” It never occurred to He Zao and He Miao that they would receive such benefits by just greeting. Amazed, they looked at Yang Kai for his opinion.

Yang Kai looked at Gui Zu with a strange look. He could easily guess that Gui Zu, who had been alone for so long, was feeling a little complacent after suddenly becoming the Supreme Elder of High Heaven Sect and respected by the disciples so much.

Otherwise, why would he give them any gifts after just meeting the Sect disciples?

None of the other Sects’ Supreme Elders was so generous.

All Supreme Elders were symbolic existences. They were the target of every disciple’s admiration and worship. Only those disciples who had made great contributions to the sect or had outstanding aptitude would be eligible to meet them in person, let alone receive some advice and gifts.

By acting like this, Gui Zu might have shown the amiability of a Supreme Elder, but it was at the expense of his majesty.

However, that didn’t matter, it was a novel experience for him. How could Yang Kai stop it? He smiled and said, “Since Supreme Elder is gifting you, take it.”

He Zao and He Miao were overjoyed. They immediately thanked, “Thank you, Supreme Elder.”

“Mhmm.” Gui Zu smiled in return. He took out two copper lock-like things from his Space Ring as if he was already prepared. He waved his hand and said as the two copper locks floated to He Zao and He Miao, “This is a set of Twin Lock artifacts. They are not used for fighting, but to assist in cultivation. Refine them separately, and when you cultivate with these Twin Locks in the future, they will help you two reach the ‘One Heart and Soul State,’ doubling your cultivation efficiency.”

“How generous of Supreme Elder!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up immediately. Although this set of artifacts weren’t high-grade, just releasing Mid-Rank Origin Grade fluctuations, these kinds of auxiliary artifacts were extremely rare. They were especially suitable for siblings like He Zao and He Miao.

Clearly, Gui Zu had noticed that they were related by blood, so he especially gave them these Twin Locks.

Gui Zu smiled and didn’t say anything, acting like a powerful master.

He Zao and He Miao sisters took the Twin Locks and played with them joyfully.

“Ask your master to come and see me. I have something to ask her,” having said this, Yang Kai left the hall with Gui Zu and moved to the bedroom.

Yue Xi rushed over after a short while. She must have heard about Gui Zu from He Zao and He Miao, as she didn’t look that surprised after meeting Gui Zu. Rather she generously bowed to Gui Zu.

“How did the Sect Master’s trip go?”

In the bedroom, Yang Kai and Gui Zu were sitting apart. Yue Xi stood before the right-hand seat and asked in a gentle voice.

“It was okay! Did anything unusual happen during my absence? Did any ignorant people come looking for trouble?” Yang Kai took a sip of tea and asked indifferently.

“Nothing happened. Now, everyone on Azure Tree Star knows that Twin Shark Island is under Senior Luo Lan’s shelter, so no one dares to come here and seek their deaths. The cultivators are also living peacefully on the island, and would pay Saint Crystals as tribute every month.”

“That’s better! Did anyone come from the High Heaven Sect?”

“I was just about to report it to the Sect Master.” Yue Xi smiled slightly with grace. “Many people have come from the High Heaven Sect after Sect Master left. This Disciple has written down their names. Sect Master, please check.”

Having said this, she stepped forward and offered a sheet of beast hide.

Yang Kai went through it and found Qian Tong, Yang Xiu Zhu, Lin Yu Rao, Chu Han Yi, Mu Yu, and others’ names on it. Except for Qian Tong, who was in Origin King Realm, everyone else had reached the peak of Third-Order Origin Returning Realm.

Their purpose was self-evident: They wanted to use the World Principles of Azure Tree Star to attack the barrier of Origin King Realm.

“Huh, Great Elder has also come?” Yang Kai was puzzled at the sight of Ye Xi Yun’s name on the list. Ye Xi Yun had once said that she wanted to protect Yang Yan. Before the Great Emperor woke up, she would never leave the High Heaven Sect. [And yet she had come to Azure Tree Star. Could it be...]

Having considered everything, Yang Kai was stunned. He hurriedly asked, “When did the Great Elder arrive?”

“Great Elder Ye arrived three months ago.”

“Do you know where she is now?”

Judging by the eager look on Yang Kai’s face, Yue Xi knew that this was important. She immediately answered in embarrassment, “This Disciple only knows that Temple Master Qian is currently in Azure Tree Palace to discuss the profundities of Origin King Realm. As for the others... Please forgive me, Sect Master. Disciple has no idea where they have gone. After arriving here, every Elder only told Disciple that they are leaving to search for a secret place to enter retreat. Therefore...”

“Hmm, I’m not blaming you for this, you don’t have to rebuke yourself.” Yang Kai said in a comforting voice. Ye Xi Yun and the others came here to break through to the Origin King Realm, so they went looking for a suitable place for their retreat. Azure Tree Star was so big, and they could easily find a secluded spot. How would Yue Xi know where they were?
