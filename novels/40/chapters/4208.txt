“Is this all the wealth that Blood Swan Continent possesses?” Inside the Main Hall, Yang Kai sat in the head seat while Yue He stood behind him. At this moment, he was holding a Space Ring in his hand and staring speechlessly at Yun Xing Hua, who was standing in front of him

Yun Xing Hua had left his name on the Loyalty List, so no matter what kind of character he had, he was now part of Void Land. Blood Swan Continent was located in Shocking Swan Territory, which was where Shocking Swan Pavilion reigned supreme. Even if Yang Kai wanted to bring the entire Blood Swan Continent under his command as a Subordinate Sect of Void Land, he was strong in will but weak in strength.

If anybody were to do something like that in the Void Territory, Yang Kai would not be able to accept it either. If he really did do this, then Shocking Swan Pavilion would definitely interfere.

Therefore, he could only give up on Blood Swan Continent’s Spirit Province despite his reluctance. Although Yang Kai could give up on the land, the people had to come with him.

Starting from Yun Xing Hua, the twenty or so Open Heaven Realm Masters and the numerous elite disciples of Blood Swan Continent would need to migrate to the Star City of Void Territory. From now onwards, they would live in and manage the Star City on behalf of Void Land.

Yang Kai believed that with a Fourth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master in charge, in addition to the cooperation of several Third-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, the Star City would be managed properly.

Be that as it may, it was a given that all of Blood Swan Continent’s wealth would be taken along before they left this place. Yang Kai had expected Blood Swan Continent to be very poor; otherwise, Gu Zhi Xin would not have targeted his own Disciple to steal a mere two Fourth-Order materials. Nevertheless, he never imagined that a Third-Class great force could be so poor!

Blood Swan Continent’s treasure house contained no more than 100,000 Open Heaven Pills while all the other cultivation resources combined were probably only worth around 200,000 to 300,000 Open Heaven Pills. In other words, all the assets in Blood Swan Continent’s treasure house were worth no more than 400,000 Open Heaven Pills!

For somebody who literally spent billions at a time like Yang Kai, this paltry sum was not even worth looking at. After further consideration though, he realised that it was not Blood Swan Continent’s fault for being so poor. The reason he had so much wealth was that he made a fortune in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. In the 3,000 Worlds, most Third-Class great forces would not have much savings in reserve. That was because its members would always require various resources for their cultivation.

Take Blood Swan Continent for example. There were 20 to 30 Open Heaven Realm Masters under Yun Xing Hua, who served as the Elders, Deacons, Hall Masters, and various other important positions in Blood Swan Continent. These people would need a certain amount of remuneration every month, ranging from several hundred to several thousand Open Heaven Pills. In one month, their expenditures would cost several tens of thousands of Open Heaven Pills, and this was not counting the disciples below the Open Heaven Realm.

This was the case for Blood Swan Continent, and most other Third-Class great forces were in similar situations.

Back then, it had been a massive hemorrhaging for Great Moon Province to give Yang Kai 100,000 Open Heaven Pills in order to express its apology. Those who had accumulated hundreds of millions of Open Heaven Pills like Yang Kai were few and far between.

Yun Xing Hua responded in a panic, “Sir, this subordinate was in retreat for my breakthrough recently, which consumed a lot of resources. That… Uh…”

He thought that Yang Kai was not satisfied with the amount; thus, he kept shooting furtive looks at the other Open Heaven Realm Masters while speaking, as if to ask them to pool some resources together to calm Yang Kai’s anger. Although many of the Open Heaven Realm Masters were extremely reluctant, they did not dare to disobey and began taking action. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Stop.” Yang Kai waved his hand dismissively and threw the Space Ring in his hand back to Yun Xing Hua.

Yun Xing Hua was puzzled, “Sir?”

Yang Kai picked up the teacup beside him and took a sip of the tea. Then, he slowly said, “That belongs to Blood Swan Continent. Take good care of it. This King is not interested in your possessions.”

Yun Xing Hua looked ashamed, “Sir, your benevolence puts this subordinate to shame.”

Yang Kai added sternly, “Right now, this King has a heavy responsibility to entrust to you!”

Yun Xing Hua hurriedly said, “Sir, please do tell!”

“Bring out your Universe Chart!” Yang Kai gestured.

Yun Xing Hua quickly took out his Universe Chart and gave it to Yang Kai. Yang Kai took the Universe Chart, poured some power into it, and then tossed it back to Yun Xing Hua a short while later, “I have marked the location of Void Land on your Universe Chart. Choose 1,000 people from Blood Swan Continent and head to Void Land to find someone named Lu Xue. Tell her that I sent you there.”

Yun Xing Hua replied respectfully, “Yes, Sir!” Pausing for a moment, he tried to probe for more information, “Sir, what should this subordinate do after meeting Lu Xue?”

Yang Kai glanced at Yun Xing Hua, “You will help this King manage the Star City in Void Territory!”

*Shua shua shua…*

The gazes of more than 20 Open Heaven Realm Masters below all turned in this direction at the same time.

Likewise, Yun Xing Hua was also stunned by those words. He stared at Yang Kai in great astonishment and asked, “Sir, you want me to manage the Star City?”

He could not believe his ears.

For any great force that was in control of a Great Territory, the existence of the Star City could almost be said to be one of the greatest sources of income. They could collect taxes and rent from the people living and working in the Star City, allowing them a steady stream of Open Heaven Pills with only minimal work and risk.

There was also a Star City in Shocking Swan Territory, but it was naturally under the management of Shocking Swan Pavilion. Blood Swan Continent had no chance to get involved in that matter whatsoever; after all, the existence of the Star City was extremely important to any great force. Only those who were the most loyal to the Sect were allowed to manage the Star City, so as to ensure the continuity of the great force.

And yet, Yang Kai was actually allowing Blood Swan Continent to manage Void Territory’s the Star City under Yun Xing Hua’s leadership!

“What’s wrong? Do you not want to?” Yang Kai’s expression sank.

Yun Xing Hua hurriedly shook his head, “No, no. This subordinate will carry out Sir’s orders even if he must cross a sea of swords and flame. It’s just that a Star City… It is so important. I am afraid of disappointing, Sir.”

Yun Xing Hua was extremely suspicious, [Could he be setting me up? But, he doesn’t have to go that far. He can determine my life or death with a single thought, so there’s no reason for him to use this method even if he wants to get rid of me.]

Yang Kai’s expression remained sullen as he explained, “Void Land is newly established and this King does not have enough Open Heaven Realm Masters or the necessary manpower to manage the Star City currently. If not for that, do you think you would obtain such a chance?”

Although these words held no trace of politeness to them, they sounded like music to Yun Xing Hua, [So that’s how it is! It’s because of insufficient manpower!]

He was jumping for joy on the inside, but he remained calm on the surface, “I see. This subordinate understands. Sir, please rest assured, this subordinate will take good care of the Star City and will not disappoint Sir’s trust.”

He was very good at hiding his emotions as neither his joy nor anger showed on his face. On the other hand, the other Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters did not have such prudence and many of them showed pleased expressions as they rejoiced in their hearts.

They originally thought that with Blood Swan Continent compromised, their days would become bitter. Even the Sect Master was being so respectful to the other party; therefore, they expected the road ahead to be extremely difficult. Many of them were already considering whether to find an opportunity to escape. They were Open Heaven Realm Masters after all, so they would be accepted anywhere no matter which great force they defected to. Even if they became lonely rogue cultivators, it would still be better than having to suffer another person’s whims.

Who could have expected that they would have the opportunity to manage a Star City? That was a lucrative job! Although all kinds of trouble could pop up in a Star City, it was also the place where transactions frequently took place and every transaction would involve large amounts of Open Heaven Pills changing hands.

Even among the great forces that were qualified to control a Star City, the candidates to manage it would have to go through extremely severe assessments and much competition before the final selection could be determined. On the contrary, the opportunity that countless people fought over was being placed right in front of them.

Sure enough, as the saying went, ‘One would surely experience great fortune after surviving a huge catastrophe’. They had been worrying about their lives not long ago, but they were now being handed such a great fortune. Every one of them could almost see huge amounts of Open Heaven Pills pouring into their pockets in the near future, so how could they not be excited?

Even Yun Xing Hua couldn’t help but smile. If he had known earlier that he would be helping Yang Kai manage a Star City, he would not have fought back at all earlier. He would have immediately opened the Grand Array and respectfully welcomed Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave Yun Xing Hua a meaningful look, “If you work hard and show this King your sincerity, your cultivation journey in the future will not be as difficult as it is now. Over time, it will not be difficult for you to enhance your Order.”

Yun Xing Hua quickly replied, “Many thanks, Sir. Rest assured, this subordinate will live up to your trust.”

“Take this jade slip. When you arrive at Void Land and meet with Lu Xue, hand it to her. She will make further arrangements for you.”

“Yes!”

“I will give you five days to settle all the affairs of Blood Swan Continent. It’s up to you who to bring with you and what to do with the rest. I only want 1,000 people entering the Star City!” While speaking, Yang Kai stood up, “This King still has other important matters to attend to. When this King returns to Void Land, I hope to see the results of your efforts!”

Yun Xing Hua bowed, “Please look forward to the results! Have a safe trip, Sir!”

The Open Heaven Realm Masters also echoed in unison, “Safe travels, Sir!”

...

Under their gazes, Yang Kai led Yue He into the Falling Lotus. Afterward, the lotus quickly turned into a stream of light and flew off into the distance.

When the stream of light disappeared from view, Yun Xing Hua exhaled heavily as he felt this was all a blessing in disguise!

After pondering for some time, he turned around and issued order after order. The entire Blood Swan Continent immediately became bustling.

There were not many disciples in Blood Swan Continent, but they were not few either. There were about 7,000 people in total. Unfortunately, Yang Kai only wanted 1,000. The remaining disciples could not be brought along with them. Moreover, Yun Xing Hua would be permanently based in the Star City. In other words, he might never return to Blood Swan Continent again.

Naturally, he wanted to bring the 1,000 disciples with the best aptitudes. As for the rest, they would have to figure out a way out for themselves. They might defect to another Third-Class great force, join Shocking Swan Pavilion, or even end up homeless; however, Blood Swan Continent was bound to be merged into Shocking Swan Pavilion at this point anyways.

At the same time, inside the Falling Lotus. Yang Kai looked at the father-and-daughter pair in front of him with a big smile on his face, “Congratulations on your reunion with your daughter, Commander Guo.”

Guo Zi Yan bowed, “It’s all thanks to you, Sir. If not for your timely rescue, the two of us would be dead right now.”

Guo Miao also said, “It’s all thanks to your life-saving grace, Sir.”

Yang Kai raised his hand to stop Guo Miao, “Your Father is part of Void Land, which makes you a part of Void Land. If my disciple is in trouble, I will not sit idly by and watch.”

He then turned to look at Guo Zi Yan, “This King mentioned before that he will provide your daughter with the best cultivation resources within the range of her ability to refine. What Order Power can your Dao Seal withstand, Guo Miao?

Guo Miao’s expression darkened, “This disciple believes that Fourth-Order should not be a problem while Fifth-Order will be a little difficult. But, now…”

...

Guo Zi Yan also looked sad. Whenever he recalled that his daughter’s future had been ruined by Gu Zhi Xin, he couldn’t help feeling extremely distressed.
