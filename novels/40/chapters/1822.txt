Chapter 1822, Core

After an hour, Yang Kai and Gui Zu set out again, disappearing into the horizon.

Watching the disappearing duo, the girl from the Shrouded Heaven Mansion immediately cheered in her heart.

[Our world is saved with the return of Holy Master Yang.] Although she had never met Yang Kai before, she was completely convinced after meeting him for the first time.

“Yang Kai, according to that little girl, this Spirit Devouring Sect is sinister.” Gui Zu fell into thoughts, “This method of extracting World Energy from the entire planet and transforming it into Spirit Devouring Crystal is brilliant. Even this Old Man is left puzzled.”

“Indeed, but this is only possible by hurting the base of the star.” Yang Kai played with the Spirit Devouring Crystals that were almost of the same size and same colour.

He had found these Spirit Devouring Crystals in Mu Cheng Feng’s Space Ring.

One of them was incomplete, which he had obtained from the Spirit Devouring Array, whereas the remaining were complete. Obviously, it was this year’s harvest.

Every strand of World Energy in these Spirit Devouring Crystals belonged to Tong Xuan Realm.

According to the girl from Shrouded Heaven Mansion, the Spirit Devouring Sect suddenly came to Tong Xuan Realm a year ago. Tong Xuan Realm cultivators were baffled by the sight of a Starship descending; they had no idea what was going on. And soon, the Spirit Devouring Sect suddenly started enslaving Tong Xuan Realm cultivators after suppressing the entire Tong Xuan Realm with absolute strength to work for them and maintain the Spirit Devouring Array.

And all those, who tried to resist, were killed without mercy. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In a year, several dozen powerful families on Tong Xuan Realm were wiped off the face of the earth!

Their Shrouded Heaven Mansion had also suffered heavy losses. In the end, only a thousand members survived.

“Has Elder never heard of the Spirit Devouring Sect?” Yang Kai looked at Gui Zu.

Gui Zu shook his head and denied, “No. You also know that this Old Man was trapped for two millennia and escaped not too long ago. In fact, I don’t know much about the affairs of this Star Field. However... don’t you just happen to have someone you can ask?”

“You mean...” Yang Kai pondered for a moment before he understood who Gui Zu was referring to. He immediately took out the Soul Sustaining Bowl from the Space Ring, focused his Divine Sense inside, and shouted, “Come out!”

Next moment, the swaying Zi Dong’s soul suddenly emerged, looking at Yang Kai with fear and trepidation. He immediately asked with a smile, “Brother Yang, what can this Lowly One do for you? Could it be that we are at Purple Star already?”

“We are not at Purple Star but I have something to ask you.”

“Brother Yang, just ask. This Lowly One would tell you all I know and without reserve.” Zi Dong Lai wiped his forehead as if he was relieved.

“Have you heard of the Spirit Devouring Sect?”

“Spirit Devouring Sect?” Zi Dong Lai’s face changed at once as a look of extreme fear took over his face.

“So you really know!?” Yang Kai, judging by his expression, immediately knew that this guy had heard of the Spirit Devouring Sect.

“This Lowly One indeed knows. What’s wrong!? Did Brother Yang encounter someone from the Spirit Devouring Sect?” Zi Dong Lai looked at Yang Kai suspiciously.

“Yes! I just came across a group of cultivators who claimed to be from Spirit Devouring Sect. They had laid a Spirit Devouring Array, refining something called Spirit Devouring Crystal.” Yang Kai took out a Spirit Devouring Crystal while speaking. “This thing.”

“A Spirit Devouring Crystal!” A fervent look instantly appeared in Zi Dong Lai’s eyes; his eyes were completely glued on the Spirit Devouring Crystal; his face was overflowing with greed. But very soon, he remembered that his body was completely destroyed now. The Spirit Devouring Crystal would be utterly useless in his current predicament. He lowered his head, saddened.

“Tell me about this Spirit Devouring Sect. Why did you look so scared?” Yang Kai continued with his questions after putting away the Spirit Devouring Crystal.

“Spirit Devouring Sect ... well, this one has never encountered them before. I have only seen some records in some ancient books of my Purple Star. According to the records, the Spirit Devouring Sect suddenly came to existence on a cultivation star called Heavenly Wolf Star a century ago and then rose like a comet. It’s rapid rise immediately drew attention from the entire Star Field. The Spirit Devouring Sect gave birth to many experts in less than a decade, including several Origin King Realm experts. It was really unusual for a sect that was completely unknown until then.”

“So, three great forces in the Star Field carried investigations and research on the Spirit Devouring Sect. Later, it was found that this Sect had discovered a set of secret methods from somewhere, which were the methods to lay the Spirit Devouring Array that Brother Yang just spoke of and refine Spirit Devouring Crystals. And the cultivators of their Sect advanced by leaps and bounds by absorbing and refining the energy of Spirit Devouring Crystals.”

“It was okay if it was just like this. The key point was that their rise was accompanied by the decline of Heavenly Wolf Star. In less than half a century after the birth of the Spirit Devouring sect, the density of Heavenly Wolf Star World Energy had dropped by several levels. Only then did the three great forces of Star Field realized the seriousness of this. Any Cultivation Star was a valuable asset of a Star Field. How could they allow the Spirit Devouring Sect to act so recklessly? If they let them continue like this, the Heavenly Wolf Star would collapse sooner or later. So, after some discussion, the three great forces jointly dispatched experts to the Heavenly Wolf Star and attacked the headquarters of the Spirit Devouring Sect.”

“Though the Spirit Devouring Sect was uprooted in that battle, the three great forces also lost a lot of experts. This was something that had never happened before; a Sect that could compete with the three great forces. Since that battle, the Spirit Devouring Sect had disappeared from the stage of history. I thought that the Spirit Devouring Sect had long disappeared but who would have thought that a fish still had slipped through the net.”

“The three great forces joined hands!” Yang Kai was also startled but he soon sneered. “The three great forces allied not just to prevent the Spirit Devouring Sect from destroying the Heavenly Wolf Star, right? What else were they eyeing?”

Zi Dong Lai smiled in embarrassment and replied, trying to flatter Yang Kai, “Brother Yang is truly farsighted. Which force would not be greedy for the Spirit Devouring Sect’s shocking method that can quickly train cultivators. A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing another’s greed. However... as far as I know, although the three forces had destroyed the Spirit Devouring Sect, they never got the method of arranging the Spirit Devouring Array.”

“Oh!? Why is this?” Yang Kai was surprised.

“I have no idea. I have only read some records from the Sect’s ancient book and don’t know about the specifics of what happened back then.” Zi Dong Lai furrowed his brow as a look of worry appeared on his face, “But for the Spirit Devouring Sect to have unexpectedly returned after several decades, this is bad news. By the way, Brother Yang, where are we? The Spirit Devouring Sect has become the target of everyone’s hatred after that incident. They can’t make any move under the noses of the three forces.”

“This is my homeworld!” Yang Kai replied casually. “No outsider has come here for a long time. Maybe this attracted the Spirit Devouring Sect, and they had laid the Spirit Devouring Arrays here.”

“So that’s how it is. Brother Yang, since you have found the Spirit Devouring Sect, you should eradicate them as soon as possible. If you give them a breath of respite, they will turn into a big problem. Judging by the density of this world’s World Energy, I think there are no experts here. If you take me back to Purple Star, I can mobilize Purple Star experts ... hey, hey, Brother Yang, let me finish, Brother Yang ... “

After Yang Kai stuffed the Soul Sustaining Bowl back to the Space Ring, he said to Gui Zu, “Elder, can I trouble you to take a trip?”

“Sect Master, if you have any orders, just let me know.” Gui Zui chuckled.

“The Spirit Devouring Sect seems to have a lot of people. As you just heard from the girl, they have scattered across the continent and laid the Spirit Devouring Array. I would like to ask you to help me eradicate them all.”

“That’s easy,” Gui Zu let out a peal of weird laughter. “It’s also very easy to find them. I just have to follow the flow of World Energy. It’s as easy as following the vines to get the melons. Moreover, this Old Man is also very interested in the Spirit Devouring Array. This Spirit Devouring Array is so heaven-defying, you shouldn’t have watched Mu Cheng Feng get killed. You should have interrogated him first.”

“The Spirit Devouring Array can be studied but can never be used.”

“Naturally, this Old Man is aware of it. This Old Man doesn’t want to be a public enemy of the Star Field, Sect Master doesn’t have to worry about that. This Old Man will be right back in a jiffy. By the way, where should I find you after dealing with them.”

“Nine Heavens Holy Land!” replied Yang Kai. “You can just ask anyone, they will know where it is.”

“Okay, this Old Man will take his leave then!” Gui Zu broke into laughter as the Ten Thousand Soul Banners wrapped around him and shot into distance, leaving a streak of light.

After Gui Zu left, Yang Kai gazed deep in a certain direction before the Wind and Thunder Wings spread behind him and he too disappeared, leaving howls of winds and roars of thunder.

It never occurred to him that Tong Xuan Realm would face such a crisis. Now that the survivors of the Spirit Devouring Sect were being eradicated by Gui Zu himself, he wasn’t worried, but he would have to go to the core himself.

[Mu Cheng Feng had said that his father is planning on refining the Star Source of Tong Xuan Realm. In that case, the Spirit Devouring Sect Master must be at the core now.]

[The Star Source of a Cultivation Star is always hidden in the depths of its core, but it’s extremely difficult to reach it. Not just anyone can resist the law contained in the power of Star Source; only a Third-Order Origin King can put up some resistance.]

[Also, the Star Source of Tong Xuan Realm has been refined by Little Senior Sister, who is not on this planet. So, it shouldn’t be difficult to sneak into the core.]

If Yang Kai’s guess was right, the Spirit Devouring Sect Master should already be at the planet’s core.

Having flown for a while, Yang Kai looked for a suitable place and landed. He then released Xiao Xiao with a wave of his hand while he himself got into the Sealed World Bead, letting Xiao Xiao take this Emperor Artifact.

Xiao Xiao’s figure then disappeared into the earth as he used his natural Divine Ability, moving towards the core at a very fast speed.

After half an hour or so, Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense to investigate the outside. He was immediately surprised to find that he had reached the core. It was very hot and had surging magma. Even the World Energy here contained unimaginable heat toxin.

He could also sense some faint movements at a very distant location.

Yang Kai’s face turned stiff as he sprang out of the Sealed World Bead. His expression grew worse as he listened closely for a movement. He hurriedly shot towards the source of the movements.

About a hundred miles away from Yang Kai stood a tough-looking middle-aged man with his hands crossed behind his back and five Third-Order Origin Returning Realm cultivators standing on either side behind him.

The middle-aged man was looking ahead with a dignified look in his eyes.

A dazzling ball of energy happened to be floating right before him. There was a clear face on that ball of energy. The face was covered by a veil, hiding its true appearance, had a blue crystal on its forehead and its eyes were as clear and pure as elves.

It was none other than Xia Ning Chang!
