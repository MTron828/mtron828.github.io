The number of Lower Star Fields was incredibly large. Some of them were completely sealed off and isolated on their own. Some of them were connected to the Star Boundary. The cultivators in these Star Fields were undoubtedly blessed, because once they reached a certain cultivation realm, they could head to the Star Boundary to further increase their strength and pursue a higher Martial Dao.

In the past, the Star Boundary was connected to essentially all Lower Star Fields. Not only could the people from below go up once they reached a certain cultivation realm, but the Masters from the Star Boundary could also go down using some methods.

However, after what the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had done, the entrances of those Lower Star Fields that led to the Star Boundary had all been sealed. That was because to those cultivators from the Star Fields, the Masters from the Star Boundary were too powerful. There were many Star Fields that had been destroyed by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, and no one could guarantee that another similar incident wouldn’t happen in the future.

The existence of these Star Fields was crucial to the Star Boundary, so these seals also acted as a kind of protection.

That was where Star Court came in. It was a mysterious great force that was unknown to most people. It was founded by the Great Emperors at that time and was charged with guarding the passageways to these Lower Star Fields so that those from the Star Boundary could not go down as they pleased.

If Yang Kai wasn’t mistaken, the Iron Blood Great Emperor was the current leader of Star Court.

Yang Kai had always thought that anyone who wished to go to any Lower Star Field must obtain Star Court’s permission first. His plan was that he would go back to Heng Luo Star Field one day when he was free so that he could bring his friends and relatives out of that place.

He even suspected that Yang Yan, who had gone missing for quite some time, was currently in Star Court’s headquarters. However, he had never expected that before he could carry out his plan, he would see a Void Corridor that led to a Lower Star Field in the Dragon Temple on Dragon Island. Moreover, it was the infamous Heaven Devouring Great Emperor who had opened it up.

Although it was highly improbable that Wu Kuang would go to Heng Luo Star Field, Yang Kai still couldn’t set his mind at ease. What if Wu Kuang really went there? That was why Yang Kai became flustered when he heard from Mo Huang that Wu Kuang had gone to a Lower Star Field. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After giving it some thought, Yang Kai proposed, “Sirs, Wu Kuang has not regained his full power yet. If we don’t take this opportunity to kill him, he’ll be a scourge for all of us in the future. What are you all hesitating for?”

Zhu Yan raised his head and took a look at him. His already displeased expression darkened, “If we can accurately locate where Wu Kuang is, I’ll definitely race after him without you telling me to do so; however, no one can be sure which Star Field he has snuck into.”

“Is that why you’re staying put?” Yang Kai stared back at him defiantly.

With a frown, Mo Huang uttered, “It’s not as simple as you think.”

Yang Kai refuted, “Although we don’t know which Star Field Wu Kuang has snuck into, we have so many people with us now. If we all pursue him, we might stand a chance of finding him. However, if we don’t even try, we’ll only be allowing him to do as he pleases, then, when he regains his full power one day, no one in the Star Boundary will be able to stop him. I don’t think all of you want another Great Emperor War, right?”

“You’re both bold and ill-tempered.” Mo Huang snorted.

Yang Kai replied, “I’m just speaking the truth.”

Fu Xuan uttered, “This matter is very complicated, so you should calm down first.” Compared to the others, Fu Xuan had treated Yang Kai relatively gently. However, she didn’t understand why Yang Kai had become agitated all of a sudden, as though he was extremely eager to go after Wu Kuang.

Yang Kai shook his head, “I just don’t understand.”

“Shut up! How do you still have the gall to speak?” Fu Zhun suddenly raised her head and shot Yang Kai a cold glare.

Exasperated, Yang Kai stared back at her and said mockingly, “What is it that you want to say, Second Elder?”

Fu Zhun uttered through clenched teeth, “If it weren’t because of you, all these misfortunes wouldn’t have happened to us. If Fu Chi hadn’t been hurt by you, how would he have lost his life? If Wu Kuang hadn’t obtained Fu Chi’s Dragon Source, how could he have entered the Dragon Temple?”

She was accusing Yang Kai in an overbearing manner.

Yang Kai sneered, “Why do you make it sound like it’s all my fault? I’m just someone with a low cultivation, so I’m not powerful enough to take up this responsibility. You’re thinking too highly of me.”

He wasn’t fond of Fu Zhun at all, because not only did she try to break up Mo Huang and Fu Xuan, but she also wanted to interfere in the relationship between Zhu Qing and him. It was as though she was jealous of others’ love lives, so she wanted to destroy their relationships. Although she was beautiful and alluring, Yang Kai still found her to be contemptible because she tried to get Zhu Qing married to another man. Yang Kai was only giving in to her because he was still not her match. When he became powerful enough one day, he would deal with her and make her have a taste of her own medicine.

Upon finishing his words, he didn’t wait for her response as he turned to Zhu Yan and cupped his fists, “Great Elder, this incident has happened on Dragon Island, and Wu Kuang has fled from this place. So, the Dragon Clan shouldn’t evade responsibility. Now, the most important thing is to track down Wu Kuang and nip him in the bud. Otherwise, he’ll only return to destroy us one day.”

“Brat, don’t you try to cross the line!” Fu Zhun bellowed.

“Great Elder!” Yang Kai ignored her and stared fixedly at Zhu Yan.

However, Zhu Yan replied with a frown, “This has nothing to do with you. Step aside now.”

He was also sick of Yang Kai. Although Fu Zhun’s accusations against Yang Kai just now were extreme, it was true he held a great deal of responsibility for the events that transpired on Dragon Island this day. After all, Yang Kai was the one who had hurt Fu Chi first and held up the other Dragon Clan members. Otherwise, Wu Kuang wouldn’t have been able to carry out his plot so easily.

Certainly, Yang Kai understood that as well, but he couldn’t tolerate Fu Zhun placing all the blame on him.

Instead of stepping aside though, Yang Kai replied impassively with a dark expression, “It seems that the Dragon Clan does not want to get involved in this. Fine. I’ll do it then!”

All of them looked weirdly at him after he finished speaking.

Fu Xuan even secretly spoke to him via Divine Sense, “Don’t say such reckless things. Listen to the Great Elder and step aside for now. Perhaps there’s still a chance for you and Qing’er.”

Yang Kai looked gratefully at her, but he shook his head and uttered, “All I ask is that you will not stop me and allow me to leave. If I manage to find Wu Kuang, I’ll deal with him on my own. If I can’t do that, there won’t be any losses for the Dragon Clan.”

As he spoke, he pointed at the Void Corridor.

During the discussion, the Void Corridor’s entrance had been slowly closing. After all, World Principles had the ability to heal spatial tears. The Void had been broken through after Wu Kuang had made use of the Dragon Temple’s power, so it could be considered a kind of damage to the world. With the help of the World Principles, this kind of damage would disappear quickly.

If Yang Kai wanted to leave this place through the Void Corridor, he had to do it quickly. After it was closed, he wouldn’t have another chance to flee.

“In your dreams!” Fu Zhun shouted.

Zhu Yan shook his head, “I also cannot agree to this.”

It was already their fault that Wu Kuang had managed to escape to a Lower Star Field through Dragon Island. Although they didn’t have to explain themselves to anyone, it would still be embarrassing for them if this news was spread. If they also allowed Yang Kai to descend to a Star Field, their reputation would be ruined.

Since both Elders didn’t agree to it, there was basically no other way around it. If Yang Kai was clever, he should stop insisting now, for if he infuriated the Dragon Clan, he would be punished harshly.

However, all of them didn’t expect that not only did Yang Kai not give in, but he also stepped forward and said in a steadfast manner, “If you don’t agree to it, I can only use force.”

“How dare you disobey us!” Fu Zhun snorted, “Seize him!”

Apparently, she was speaking to all Dragon Clan members. Although she wasn’t fond of Yang Kai, it was difficult for her to personally move against him given her status and cultivation.

Upon receiving the order, the dozen Dragon Clan members started making a move.

Some of them were hurt by Yang Kai not long ago, but although their Blessing Technique was broken, they were mostly fine. With the Elders watching over them, there was no way they would be afraid of Yang Kai.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai and Zhu Qing were surrounded.

“Just try it!” Yang Kai shouted and stomped his foot on the ground, causing the entire Dragon Temple to shake. After a resounding roar was heard, the illusory phantom of a huge Golden Divine Dragon emerged from the back of his head, appearing overbearing and aloof.

Upon sensing the Golden Divine Dragon Source’s aura, all the Dragon Clan members fell into a dazed state, including the Elders.

[It’s the Ancestral Dragon Source! This is the true Ancestral Dragon Source!]

Although the Dragon Clan members were aware that the Ancestral Dragon Source was with Yang Kai, it was the first time they saw its true form with their eyes.

Even the Great Elder and the Second Elder were not comparable to this Pureblood Dragon aura. To all the Dragon Clan members, the Ancestral Dragon Source was like their origin as well as a mother’s embrace, making them feel familiar and amiable.

In an instant, the hostility they had towards Yang Kai vanished into thin air.

The Elders quickly pulled themselves together though and guarded their minds so they wouldn’t be affected by the Ancestral Dragon Source Strength.

“Second Elder, do you remember what place this is, and what kind of power I possess?” After the Ancestral Dragon Source appeared, Yang Kai suddenly began acting lofty and aloof. Although there was no sign of him using his Dragon Transformation, the way he looked at Fu Zhun was clearly as though he was superior to her.

Suddenly, he started forming a set of mysterious hand seals and began speaking in two different tones at once, as though two people were chanting at the same time through his mouth.

The first voice was uttering the abstruse Dragon Language, while the other was his usual voice, “Water cannot be dynamic without its origin. The tree cannot grow without its roots. The Ancestral Source is present, so why have you not come to pay your respects yet?”

Two voices were intertwined in a perfectly coordinated manner, so they didn’t sound awkward to the ears. Instead, they sounded like a perfect harmony.

The ordinary Dragon Clan members didn’t have much reaction when they heard these words, but the Elders all turned pale at the same time.

Fu Xuan’s gaze brightened as she exclaimed. Just then, Dragon roars could be heard again, but this time, they were coming from all directions in the temple in a continuous and alternating manner.

The slumbering spirits of all the Great Dragons in this place awakened at the same time as though they had been summoned by an irresistible call.

Suddenly, a spot in the dim hall brightened and then spread across the entire room. In the blink of an eye, the entire hall was as bright as daylight.

Great Dragons of different colours, scarlet, orange, red, emerald, green, blue, and purple, flew about, illuminating the hall in a dazzling display of light.

The first Great Dragon hovered above Yang Kai’s head for a moment before it stabilized itself and faced the Golden Divine Dragon. After that, it lowered its head in a dignified manner, followed by the second Dragon, the third Dragon, and all the others in order.

…

All who witnessed this scene were dumbfounded.
