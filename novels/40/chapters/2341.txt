[To think a Dao Source Realm cultivator would boast so shamelessly! To tell an Emperor Realm Master he would die to his face, has this guy lost his mind?]

Shi Cang Ying and the others all had strange expressions on their faces.

Only Hua Qing Si knew that Yang Kai was not joking. Even though Yang Kai was not an Emperor Realm Master, he definitely had the strength to fight at that level. Not to mention the others, the Embodiment itself was enough to give Qiu Ze a headache. If Yang Kai were to join the fray as well, then he may be able to fight on equal ground with Qiu Ze.

So, after Yang Kai appeared, Hua Qing Si’s heart was finally put at ease. Even if Yang Kai’s cultivation was a little lower than hers, Hua Qing Si was definitely no match for him!

She had never met a man as radiant as Yang Kai.

[No...] Hua Qing Si suddenly realized that Yang Kai’s cultivation was not lower than hers, but rather, it was on par with her.

[When did he advance to the Third-Order Dao Source Realm?] Hua Qing Si was shocked. [It was not that long ago that he reached the Second-Order Dao Source Realm... To think he actually broke through again in such a short amount of time? Is cultivating as easy as drinking and eating for him?]

Even though she was shocked, she was still mostly elated.

Yang Kai had gotten stronger again, which meant that the situation before him was now even more favourable.

“Heh...” Qiu Ze suddenly scoffed. Even though Yang Kai did not speak too loudly, he heard it loud and clear, and an amused smile emerged on his face. Looking at Yang Kai, he said, “Little brat, it seems you do not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth. You actually dare think of taking this King’s life?”

Luo Jin shouted from the side, “Palace Lord Qiu, that guy is the one who injured your son!”

“He’s Yang Kai?” Qiu Ze’s face turned dark. Even Mu Zheng of White Clouds Tower, and Ruan Hong Bo from Sky Peak Temple were glaring at Yang Kai with angry looks on their faces. Mu Guan of White Clouds Tower and Ke Tian from Sky Peak Temple were both killed by Yang Kai, so he was the reason why the two of them had come to stir trouble with Thousand Leaves Sect. Now that their enemy was right before their eyes, they were naturally seeing red.

“That’s right, he’s the one!” Luo Jin spat with hatred.

That day at the City Lord’s Mansion, Luo Jin suffered the greatest humiliation of his life. It was a day he would never forget. Even though Yang Kai spared his life in the end, his hatred for him was like a lump in his throat. If he did not get revenge, he would not be able to rest easy again.

Even in his dreams, he dreamt of killing Yang Kai and avenging his past shame.

After learning of Yang Kai’s identity, all the Masters of each Sect were looking at Yang Kai as if he were a dead man. However, since Qiu Ze did not move, none of them dared act on their own.

“You’re Yang Kai?” It seemed that Qiu Ze wanted to confirm it and stood there questioning Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered disdainfully, “What the hell do you count for, daring to ask for this Young Master’s name!”

His expression could not be any more arrogant, as if Qiu Ze wasn’t worth his time at all, but the latter kept a calm expression. He did not get angry, but instead gently nodded, “Very good. This King heard that you have refined a furnace of Extraordinary Treasure Pills in the Four Seasons Realm?”

Yang Kai raised a brow thoughtfully, “So, you’re after something else, aren’t you? You want an Extraordinary Treasure Pill? I apologize, but they’re all gone.”

Qiu Ze responded, “No matter. This King also did not expect to get an Extraordinary Treasure Pill from you. However, this King has heard that you took one of them yourself. After I capture and boil you down, traces of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill’s medicinal efficacies should still be present.”

As soon as he said this, even the faces of Ruan Hong Bo and the others standing on Qiu Ze’s side changed. They all looked over in unison as if they could not believe that he had just said such a thing.

They had never thought of getting a trace of the medicinal efficacies of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill by boiling a person who had taken it. As expected of Qiu Ze, to be able to think of such an idea. But on second thought, it did seem to make sense.

The effects of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill were strong, and most of the medicinal efficacies would be gathered in the meridians, slowly refined by the cultivator as time went on. So, the sooner one takes the Extraordinary Treasure Pill, the better.

Back then, that girl from Eight Paths Sect had taken the Extraordinary Treasure Pill when she was still in the Second-Order Dao Source Realm. Even though she was forced to take it by Luo Yuan, it perfectly unleashed the efficacy of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill. As long as her aptitude was decent enough and she cultivated hard in the future, reaching the Emperor Realm was inevitable.

Qiu Ze was already in the Emperor Realm, so the Extraordinary Treasure Pill obviously wouldn’t be of use to him. He likely wanted it for Qiu Yu.

But just thinking that he would first have to drink a pot of human meat soup in order to obtain the medicinal efficacies of the Extraordinary Treasure Pill... Ruan Hong Bo and the others instantly paled and their stomachs churned. They inwardly began feeling sympathetic towards Qiu Yu. Who knows what Qiu Yu’s reaction would be if he learned the truth in the future.

“You wish to boil this Young Master?” Yang Kai failed to stifle his laughter and sneered back, “You are the one that does not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth.”

“How presumptuous of you, little brat.” A cold glint flashed past Qiu Ze’s eyes as he snorted, “But if you don’t have the strength to match that attitude, this presumptuousness of yours just seems childish and ridiculous.”

While speaking, he suddenly raised a hand and struck his palm in Yang Kai’s direction.

The wind surged up in an instant. A huge palm formed in the sky and flew over, blanketing a vast area.

Qiu Ze’s palm clearly did not care about the life or death of the others, or even Yang Kai’s survival. To him, it did not matter whether Yang Kai was dead or alive, he just needed to take his corpse back and boil it.

With this sudden strike, the sky darkened.

Ye Hen and Du Xian’s eyes almost bulged out of their sockets as their bodies shook with tension, but they could only watch the scene unfold without any means to help.

A fiery red light suddenly shot out at that moment, and the hot aura instantly diffused. A delicate and small figure rose to the skies and met the palm strike head-on.

The two collided in a flash and Liu Yan groaned as she was slapped down, but as a result of her efforts, the palm print was dispersed and light returned to the sky.

*Xiu...*

A sound of something breaking through the air rang out as a certain figure flickered at the same time. Before the bystanders could see what happened, the figure had already returned to the array base platform.

It was Yang Kai who took the opportunity when Liu Yan acted to retrieve Ye Hen and Du Xian.

He was highly proficient in the Dao of Space, so he caught everyone off guard. By the time Qiu Ze could react, it was already too late to stop Yang Kai, and when he looked over, he saw that all his hostages had already been saved.

Qiu Ze’s face dimmed instantly, frowning at Yang Kai and the little girl whom he had slapped to the ground.

If it was just Yang Kai, then so be it. For a Third-Order Dao Source Realm, he may be fast, but he still wasn’t worth mentioning; however, for this oddly-dressed little girl to be able to sustain a blow from him was a little unbelievable.

He could not feel Liu Yan’s cultivation prior to this, but in their brief confrontation, Qiu Ze clearly perceived that she was at the peak of the Dao Source Realm.

Qiu Ze was not the only one in disbelief. Everyone present was dumbfounded.

They did not expect that Yang Kai would not be the one to take the hit, but rather the eight-year-old looking girl. [How could this little girl survive a blow from an Emperor Realm Master head-on? Can’t you see that she was slammed into the ground by Qiu Ze and even left a little human-shaped hole there?]

[She should be in pieces by now.]

In an instant, everyone was looking at Yang Kai with disdain. Even enemies like Ruan Hong Bo scorned Yang Kai’s actions, thinking that this guy was simply a beast to actually let a little girl like that send herself to death’s embrace.

“That hurts!” The crisp voice of a child mixed with fierce anger emerged from the human-shaped hole in the ground. In the next moment, a little head popped out. Liu Yan’s face was livid with rage as she leapt out of the hole and patted away the dirt from her body.

“She’s still alive?” Luo Jin was stupefied. He didn’t expect a little thing like her would be able to survive taking a hit from Qiu Ze face-first.

Not only did she survive it, but she also didn’t seem injured at all.

[What kind of monster is this?]

Ye Jing Han and Hua Qing Si were also dumbfounded and stared at Liu Yan in shock.

Suddenly, Hua Qing Si’s expression changed and she asked hesitantly, “Little Sister Liu Yan?”

Just now, when Liu Yan moved, Hua Qing Si was able to sense her aura. The two of them had been cultivating in the Sealed World Bead together with Zhang Ruo Xi all this while so they naturally could not be more familiar with each other. Looking at her again now, the attitude and appearance of this little girl clearly looked about seventy to eighty percent similar to Liu Yan. Only, she was now much younger.

She did not pay much attention to this little girl before; after all, they were in a life or death situation so she didn’t have the leisure for such random thoughts; but now, after realizing that this little girl may be Liu Yan, Hua Qing Si could no longer restrain the shock in her heart.

[How... is this possible?]

Liu Yan turned around and shot a sweet smile at Hua Qing Si, “Sister Hua!”

[It’s Liu Yan, no doubt about it! It has to be her!]

Hua Qing Si’s beautiful eyes were round in surprise as she stammered, “How... How did you end up like this?”

Liu Yan responded meekly, “Master said he liked little girls the best, the smaller the better, so I...”

“Ahh?” Hua Qing Si squinted and glared at Yang Kai. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Cold sweat poured down Yang Kai’s forehead like a waterfall. Reaching up to wipe it, he hurriedly shouted, “Don’t listen to her! That’s nonsense!”

This time, even Chi Yue and Ye Jing Han were glaring daggers at Yang Kai.

“Beast!”

“Shameless!”

“Scum!”

The three women chimed in one word after another, each word stabbing into his heart. Even Yang Kai’s face had gone blue.

Hua Qing Si coldly snorted as she called out, “You have to follow me closely in the future. You must never be alone with him! Sister Hua will protect you.”

“Thank you, Sister Hua!” Liu Yan put on an innocent smile.

“Are you alright? Were you hurt just now?” Even though Liu Yan seemed to be in good condition, Hua Qing Si still could not help but ask. She had traded blows with Qiu Ze and knew how powerful he was. Even she was not his opponent, it naturally made her worry to see Liu Yan take a hit from him.

“Couldn’t be better!” Liu Yan smiled. However, that smile didn’t reach her eyes in the slightest. Those eyes were filled with bone-chilling frost, and she even shot a cold glance at Qiu Ze as she spoke.

For some reason, Qiu Ze’s heart jumped when he met her eyes. A kind of uneasy feeling suddenly sprouted in his heart. Shaking off his unease quickly though, he took a decisive step forward and shouted, “This is a touching reunion, but let’s end this here. This King does not wish to start killing here. So, I will only offer you all a choice...”

Then, speaking up to this point, his voice turned cold and the killing intent within it surged like a tidal wave, the wind blowing from the nine hells of purgatory as he declared, “Those who obey me will prosper, those who rebel will die!”
