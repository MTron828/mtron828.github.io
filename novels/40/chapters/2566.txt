The Monster General was utterly helpless. He had no idea whether his assistance would be useful or not; however, he was grasping at straws from the beginning.

To his surprise, Yang Kai really stopped.

The Monster General felt like he had just survived the storm and knew he had bet right, immediately adding, “Sir, rest assured. As long as Sir lets me live, this lowly one will definitely not disappoint Sir. Besides, this lowly one also has some men under him. If you make them search, they will surely be helpful one way or another.”

[That makes sense!]

Yang Kai had never ever thought that he would run into Ice Heart Valley’s Third Elder in the Ancient Wild Lands, but now that he had run into her, he couldn’t simply let her roam free like this. However, the Third Elder’s movement skill was extremely strange and her camouflaging techniques were fearsome. If just he and Zhang Ruo Xi tried looking for her, they might not be able to do anything no matter how hard they tried.

If they could get the help of this Monster General, it would save them some time; after all, the Monster General had many subordinates at his disposal.

In order to put Yang Kai at ease, and safeguard his own life, the Monster General gritted his teeth and proposed on his own, “If Sir wants, this lowly one is willing to hand over his Soul Brand. This lowly one will be at Sir’s beck and call and work myself to the bone.”

Handing over one’s Soul Brand was tantamount to be becoming a Soul Slave. His life and death would be up to Yang Kai to decide. In order to control Hua Qing Si, Yang Kai had done the very same thing.

However, Hua Qing Si was forced to do it and was powerless about it, but the Monster General was actively proposing it.

However, the Monster General wasn’t doing this for no reason; he could care less about anything else to save his own skin, but who knows whether he would regret it in the future or not.

“Hand it over!” Yang Kai stretched his hand towards him.

“Yeah…” The corner of Monster General’s mouth started twitching, noticing Yang Kai’s cold gaze pointed at him. He didn’t dare to resist anymore and obediently closed his eyes and used a certain Secret Technique. In a few moments, a glowing golden wisp flew out of his forehead before being caught by Yang Kai.

The Monster General let out a stifled groan; his face going slightly pale.

After Yang Kai had stored the Monster General’s Soul Brand in his Knowledge Sea using some means, he finally put away the Myriads Sword and indifferently ordered, “Get up!”

Although the Monster General was agonizing in his heart, he knew that his life was saved somehow. He quickly got up, patted the dust off his body, then faintly sighed as he glanced over at his mount that had been cut in half.

“Sir, can you ask that Young Lady… To stop? This lowly one is afraid that she might accidentally get hurt!” The Monster General pointed at Zhang Ruo Xi’, who was still fighting with the other Monster Race members.

Yang Kai nodded and transmitted his voice into Zhang Ruo Xi’s ears.

The Monster General also shouted at the same time, “Everyone, stop!”

By the looks of it, he had very high prestige among the Monster Race members here as all of them retreated with just his one command, distancing themselves from Zhang Ruo Xi while leaving two fresh corpses on the ground.

Although they were locked in a heated battle, few had actually died, mainly because Zhang Ruo Xi’s hands and feet were tied while fighting so many enemies at once. After all, she was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm.

However, the fact that she had killed two members of the Monster Race and remained unscathed after just a short battle had terrified all her opponents.

Fortunately, the Monster General had ordered them to stop, otherwise, they had no idea if they would still have the courage to fight after a few more deaths.

The Monster Race members and their mounts both looked towards Yang Kai and the Monster General. Seeing them standing side by side in peace had made them curious.

The Monster General lightly coughed and explained, “Everything was a misunderstanding. This Sir is on our side, we don’t need to fight anymore.”

He was too ashamed to tell his subordinates the truth that he had already become Yang Kai’s slave; after all, he still wanted to save face. When he spoke, he surreptitiously looked at the change in Yang Kai’s expression, but after finding that Yang Kai didn’t mind, he finally put his heart at ease.

The Monster Race group on the other hand looked at each other blankly, confused about what their leader was doing. This man and woman were clearly humans, so how could they be on their side?

But after having experienced Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi’s ferocity first hand, they didn’t dare to raise any questions, lest they draw trouble to themselves.

“In the future, seeing this Sir will be as if you are seeing me. Do you understand?” The Monster General shouted again, pointing at Yang Kai.

Although the Monster Race members were totally confused, they still nodded in agreement; mainly because they were scared and they had no desire to risk themselves to avenge their fallen comrades.

The Monster General turned and spoke with a flattering smile next, “Sir, you must be tired from the journey, how about you take a rest at this lowly one’s mountain?”

“Rest?” Yang didn’t give him face and ordered, waving his hand, “Hurry up and ask them to find her. If they can’t find her, death will be the punishment.”

The Monster General immediately looked bitter as he replied, “Sir, I believe you don’t know about this yet, but when that woman is frightened, she won’t show up for some time. It’s useless to look for her during that period.”

Yang Kai calmly asked, “What do you mean?”

The Monster General continued to explain, cupping his fist, “She is very timid, and every time she is frightened, she will hide for a month or two. During this time, no one has ever been able to find her. So, if Sir wants to look for her, the best method is to wait and lie low. After a time, she will naturally show up again.” Seeing Yang Kai looking at him suspiciously, the Monster General began sweating profusely, “Sir, this lowly one is speaking the truth, Sir can ask them.”

Yang Kai had experienced Bing Yun’s Third Disciple’s timidity first hand. It should be because of her problem with her sanity, so he felt that the Monster General wasn’t lying to him. Not to mention, his life was in Yang Kai’s hands, so this Monster General wouldn’t have the courage to lie to him in the first place.

“Even if you can’t find her, you still have to keep looking. Let me know if there is any news,” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

Although he knew that the Monster General was not lying, Yang Kai was still hoping for a chance that she would be found.

“Yes, yes, yes!” Since he couldn’t dissuade Yang Kai, all he could do was ask his subordinates to look around and immediately report back if there were any news.

After having received the order, the twenty or thirty Monster Race members of varying cultivation dispersed in all directions, leaving only five Monster Race members to escort the Monster General and Yang Kai.

“Where are we going to rest?” Yang Kai glanced at the Monster General with a straight face. Now that someone was helping him look for the traces of the Third Disciple, he didn’t need to work so hard. This Monster General also said that the Third Disciple won’t show up for a month or two, so Yang Kai had no intention to look for her immediately and decided to wait.

The Monster General immediately made an inviting gesture after hearing this, nodding and bowing his waist, “This way, Sir, it’s not too far. It will only take half a day.”

Yang Kai nodded before flying towards the indicated direction.

Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t know what Yang Kai was doing, but she didn’t ask any questions either, just flying into the air along with Yang Kai, shooting a contemptuously look at the Monster General as she passed him.

No matter what, he was a Monster General, a Twelfth-Order Monster Race equal to an Emperor Realm Master of the Human Race, so how could he be so spineless? He was no better than cowardly Humans. Zhang Ruo Xi had heard that the Monster Race of the Ancient Lands were brave and did not fear death, so how could she suddenly accept this great disparity in reality?

Having been looked at by Zhang Ruo Xi like this, the Monster General embarrassingly touched his nose before he followed them.

And following his lead, a file of people flew towards the Monster General’s abode.

“What’s your name?” Yang Kai suddenly asked in the middle of the journey.

The Monster General cupped his fists and introduced himself, “This lowly one is Yang You Wei!”

“I heard you mention a Monster King Ying Fei, who is he?” Yang Kai curiously looked at him.

Yang You Wei immediately turned serious as he replied, “Sir Ying Fei is one of the eight Monster Kings under the Divine Venerable. His strength is unfathomable and has already reached the peak of the Twelfth-Order, which is comparable to a Third-Order Emperor Realm Human Master!”

“Eight Monster Kings!” Yang Kai furrowed his brow, “So to say, there are seven other Monster Kings?”

Yang You Wei chuckled before proudly stating, “Not just seven, there are thirty-two Monster Kings in the Ancient Lands!”

Yang Kai was shocked, “So many? Are all of them at the peak Third-Order Emperor Realm!?”

Yang You Wei responded with a nod, “But of course! How can they secure the position of Monster King without such a level of strength? In fact, there are more than thirty-two with this level of strength, but there are only thirty-two Monster Kings, that’s all. Those who couldn’t seize the position of Monster King are all powerful Masters who serve the Divine Venerables directly. There are more than a dozen of them and they aren’t any worse than any Monster King. Some of them may even be stronger.”

Yang Kai gasped a cold breath of air.

Before coming here, he had never known that there were so many fearsome Monster Race Masters in the Ancient Wild Lands. Hearing information about this, Yang Kai finally realized that he had been greatly underestimating the Ancient Lands.

In the entire Star Boundary, no Sect had so many Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters! Even those sects led by Great Emperors did not have such formidable strength! At most, a single Sect would have seven or eight such Masters.

In other words, the force of the Ancient Lands was comparable to four or five Star Soul Palaces combined.

No wonder everyone called the Ancient Lands a dangerous domain. It was far more than dangerous, it was simply a gateway to Hell. One might not even know how they died in this place!

Yang Kai felt slightly lucky now that he didn’t kill Yang You Wei right away, otherwise, he might not have been able to get hold of this important information. This made him a little worried about the task that lay ahead of him.

“Then who or what… Is this Divine Venerable you speak of?” Suddenly, a fearsome notion flashed in Yang Kai’s mind as he hesitatingly asked.

“A Divine Venerable is a Divine Venerable!” Yang You Wei meaningfully grinned, “They rule over the entire Ancient Wild Lands. Oh yes, according to humans, a Divine Venerable is also referred to as a Divine Spirit!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

[As I expected…]

Yang Kai was shocked. Although there were rumours that Divine Spirits existed in the Ancient Lands, the general population didn’t know if this was true or not. After hearing what Yang You Wei had said, it seemed that the Monster Race living here was well aware of their existence.

There were really Divine Spirits in the Ancient Lands!

Zhang Ruo Xi looked at Yang You Wei in shock, unable to digest this shocking news, her mouth slightly agape as she gasped lightly.

Yang You Wei wasn’t finished yet though and immediately threw out another startling piece of information, “There are four Divine Venerables in the Ancient Lands, each of them having eight subordinate Monster Kings as well as two Great Kings under them. Heh heh, our Ancient Lands’ strength is extraordinary!”

[Four Divine Venerables… Doesn’t that mean that there are four Divine Spirits here?] Yang Kai turned pale.

Although his current cultivation was decent, he was still no match for a Divine Spirit.

Yang You Wei was paying close attention to Yang Kai’s expression, so when he noticed that there was some shock and awe in it, he secretly felt elated. He didn’t give him any face, but it looked like he was scared now!

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai turned to him and stated, coldly looking at him, “No matter how strong the Divine Venerables and Monster Kings are, your life or death is now mine to control.”

This time it was Yang You Wei’s turn to turn pale as he stated in an aggrieved voice, “Sir, this lowly one is loyal to you. Sir, I always keep my word, the Sun and Moon can testify to it. Sir, please understand!”

[Loyalty? What nonsense! How long have we known each other? To think you are actually talking about loyalty. You are lying right through your teeth!]

“Rest assured, I will give you back your freedom once I find that woman!” Yang Kai stated with a snort, giving him the carrot after hitting him with the stick.

Yang You Wei beamed with joy in his heart but said otherwise, “The lowly one will do anything for Sir, loyally and faithfully.”

Who knows where this guy learned to be this good with words, sucking up and flattering Yang Kai at every turn with complete seriousness, drawing even more contempt from Zhang Ruo Xi towards him.
