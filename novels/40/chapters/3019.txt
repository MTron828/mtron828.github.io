A labyrinth existed inside the Void Crack. That in itself was incredible. However, there was a human phantom image in the labyrinth at this moment. That was even more incredible.

[Who is this person? Or should I ask; who is the person who left this phantom image behind?]

Both Yang Kai and Li Jiao were staring in that direction with widened eyes. Unfortunately, they were disappointed to learn that they could not see the true face of the phantom image no matter how hard they looked.

That Phantom Image Secret Technique seemed to have existed for many years. It might have been extremely powerful once, but it had become a little unstable after being exposed to the Void Crack for so long. The figure wavered erratically. Sometimes, it was long and thin; sometimes, it was short and round. It looked as if it might collapse at any time.

For some reason, Yang Kai had the feeling that the figure looked familiar, as if he had seen the one it was modelled after somewhere before.

“Brother Li, have you seen this person before?” He asked softly.

Li Jiao shook his head, “I can’t tell, but this person was definitely not just a nobody.”

That phantom image might be unstable, but the occasional short-lived aura that pulsed out from it was extremely powerful. That person was obviously not an ordinary Emperor Realm Master.

Yang Kai nodded. Images of all the Masters he had met before flashed through his mind as he tried to match them to the figure in front of him.

At that moment, the phantom image suddenly expanded then rapidly contracted. It turned into a small fist-sized ball of white light that slowly drifted towards somewhere.

Yang Kai did not have the time to think about anything else as he grabbed Li Jiao and shouted, “Follow him!”

Li Jiao was stunned, “Follow him?”

“En!” Yang Kai replied. He had the feeling that the appearance of this figure might be a turning point. He had been searching this place for a month now; however, he still couldn’t find a way out of this Void Labyrinth. [At this point, it won’t hurt to try everything at our disposal. We might as well see what that ball of light will do.]

Yang Kai no longer hesitated and followed closely behind that ball of light. The movement of that ball of light was even more erratic and elusive than Yang Kai’s movements from before. It looked aimless, but there were signs of predictability upon closer look.

Yang Kai was secretly encouraged, thinking that his guess was right. Now, all he wanted to know was who had left that figure behind; therefore, he had been observing the state of that ball of light but had not found any traces that would identify its source. That ball of light was produced by a Secret Technique cast by a Master who also made that phantom image. Unfortunately, it had long since become completely unrecognizable after so many years in this chaotic place. Thus, it was extremely difficult for Yang Kai to trace the origins of that figure.

They walked for several days and Li Jiao was becoming desperate while, similarly, Yang Kai felt his heart pounding wildly. The idea of giving up had popped up in his head several times by now, but doing so seemed like such a waste. Hence, he could only grit his teeth and continue to persevere.

All of a sudden, the ball of light accelerated and rushed forward. Yang Kai hurriedly chased after it upon seeing that. Unexpectedly, the ball of light suddenly exploded in a shower of sparkles and disappeared when it reached a certain spot in the Void.

“Uh…” Li Jiao looked a little dumbfounded.

They had been walking behind this ball of light for several days now but he had not expected that this would be the outcome of their efforts. Thus, he nearly cursed out loud at the sight. [Wasn’t this a waste of time?]

Following this incident, he began to lose confidence in Yang Kai. [We are probably destined to be trapped here for a lifetime. We will never be able to get out of this labyrinth.]

He turned to look at Yang Kai only to find that Yang Kai’s expression had lit up with joy as if he had discovered something amazing.

“Palace Master Yang?” Li Jiao called out.

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Li Jiao and said, “I found it!”

“You found it?” Li Jiao frowned and subconsciously asked, “Found what?”

“What do you think?”

Li Jiao was startled, then he became excited, “Are you saying… you found the exit?!”

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. He mulled over it for a moment before continuing, “I will open the exit now. Follow me as quickly as possible. If we are too slow, Dragon Island might discover us.”

“Good!” Li Jiao couldn’t help swallowing nervously. [We found it just like that? We actually found the exit just by walking behind that ball of light for a few days? What in the world was that ball of light?! Why would it guide us to the location of the exit? Whatever; that’s not important anymore. What’s important is that I’m about to set foot on Dragon Island! I’m about to complete my life’s greatest wish!] He was excited, nervous, eager, and anxious…

While Li Jiao’s emotions were all over the place, Yang Kai’s expression had already turned solemn. Space Principles began surging as he stretched out his hands and fiercely tore space apart.

“Go!” Yang Kai shouted.

Li Jiao immediately plunged into the gap and Yang Kai followed closely. Then the two of them instantly disappeared from this endless Void.

In the East Sea of the Eastern Territory stood a lush and beautiful island rich in World Energy, reminiscent of a paradise.

On that island stood a man dressed in white, holding his hand out to the void. Beside him stood a beautiful woman dressed in an elegant black dress. She had her arms crossed in front of her chest, squeezing her ample assets so tightly that they were slightly deformed. The split in her dress rose up to her thighs, exposing more than half of her legs to the air. Her fair skin was smooth and tender, exuding a seductive lustre akin to fine soft white jade. If a man were to witness this sight, he would be so charmed that he would lose his soul to her.

The man was handsome while the woman was voluptuous and graceful. Just by standing there, the two of them made an extremely eye-catching sight.

The two of them were looking out into the distance where a small figure was sitting cross-legged at the mouth of an active volcano. The blazing heatwave did not harm her whatsoever. Rather, it continuously rushed towards her childlike body and was completely absorbed into her.

“Feng’er, did that girl really assimilate with the Phoenix True Fire?” The white-robed man asked abruptly.

The beautiful woman in black who was called ‘Feng’er’ replied, “En. Moreover, it was a perfect assimilation.”

He asked, “Isn’t she an Artifact Spirit? Although she is a Fire Attribute Artifact Spirit, which does not clash with the attribute of the Phoenix True Fire, she does not have a flesh and blood body. How did she assimilate with the Phoenix True Fire?”

She responded, “Don’t underestimate her body. It might be artificial, but its ability to adapt and grow is incredible. That is the body of a Spirit Puppet. You will never find another one like her in this world.”

“You seem really taken with her,” he turned his head and looked at the person next to him.

She smiled, “Her future achievements will surely surpass mine.”

He nodded, “In any case, I should congratulate the Phoenix Clan for adding another clansman to their ranks.”

Her smile widened. It was an amorous sight.

At that particular moment, the white-robed man frowned and revealed an expression of surprise.

“What happened?” The beautiful woman glanced at him in amazement. At their cultivation, it was rare for anything to surprise them anymore; however, the expression on his face clearly indicated that something big and unexpected had occurred.

“You wouldn’t believe me even if I told you!” He turned to look at her with a strange expression, “Somebody has broken into Dragon Island!”

She was stunned for a moment. Then, she giggled, “Who could be so desperate? What an unlucky guy.”

She did not ask how the white-robed man knew about this because she knew that he had probed into the situation on Dragon Island several years back. Furthermore, he had left a kind of Soul Clone back in that Void Labyrinth.

That Void Labyrinth was not easy to crack. Even the white-robed man had failed to find the exit back then. In the end, he could only cast a Secret Technique to leave a Soul Clone to slowly decode the labyrinth.

More than a decade had passed since then and that Soul Clone had obviously made some headway in regards to escaping the labyrinth during that period. For the white-robed man to receive this information could only mean that he had received feedback from it. In other words, the Soul Clone he left behind in the Void Labyrinth had been dispelled.

“If it was really him, you also know him,” the white-robed man said with an odd expression. He couldn’t be sure about the identity of the person that had broken into Dragon Island; after all, the message he received from his failing Soul Clone after it had scattered had been incomplete. Thus, he was only sixty percent certain.

“I know him too?” The beautiful woman was taken aback by those words and asked curiously, “Who is it?”

“He is related to the Young Lady.”

She frowned at those words.

“He is also related to her!” He pointed at the small figure by the mouth of the volcano.

“Do you mean that guy?!” She was dumbfounded. His hints were so obvious that she would be an idiot if she still couldn’t guess who he was referring to. Still, she could not imagine that that person could successfully break into Dragon Island. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How can it be him?” She was in disbelief, “Is he insane?! He actually dared to break into Dragon Island!?”

In response, he shrugged with a look that seemed to say, ‘I don’t know either.’

“Did you lead him in?” she asked.

He replied, “No, it wasn’t me. It’s something my Soul Clone did on its own.”

“Nonsense! What kind of place do you think Dragon Island is? What can he do after entering that place with that paltry strength of his!? He will probably be beaten to a pulp!”

The man added, “I left my Soul Clone there more than ten years ago. I didn’t know him back then, so the Soul Clone I left behind doesn’t know him either. It only led him into Dragon Island in hopes that he could make some waves in that place. It wanted to see if that person could create an opportunity for me to take advantage. It would be great if he causes a ruckus there, but it’s fine even if he doesn’t.”

“If anything happens to him, Xiao Qi will never forgive you for it. It’s not like you don’t know how important he is to her. She has been clamouring to go to the Southern Territory to look for him for years now. If she had not been confined by her father, she would have run off a long time ago.”

He sweated profusely at those words, “Please don’t tell her.”

She replied, “There are no secrets that can be kept forever.”

He exclaimed, “So, what should we do? He has already gone inside. If he was going to die, he would already be dead by now!”

She pondered in silence for a moment, “Well, this is certainly an opportunity. It wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we took this chance to sneak into Dragon Island… I will report this to Sir. We’ll see how he decides to proceed with this matter.

“Good.” He nodded.

Then, the beautiful woman transformed into a fiery light and headed into the distance as swiftly as lightning.

“Were you talking about Master just now?” A childish voice suddenly rang out.

The corners of the white-robed man’s mouth twitched at those words. Lowering his head, he glanced in the direction of the voice and saw a seven-or-eight-year-old little girl standing there. He did not know how long she had been standing there. She was staring unblinkingly at him with a pair of large, sparkling eyes.

The little girl looked like a jade sculpture. One glance was enough to determine that she would become a beauty that would turn the world upside down in the future.

However, the white-robed man knew that this little girl wasn’t a little girl at all. Lifting his head to look at the sky, his expression was full of vicissitudes as he groaned, “The wind today sure is noisy…”
