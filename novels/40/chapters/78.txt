Chapter 80 - Immovable Will

Su Xuan Wu was squinting his eyes as he looked at Kai Yang, who was currently being beaten up, and remarked: “He looks like he is trying to understand something.”

“What do you mean?” Su Mu didn’t understand.

Su Xuan Wu only shook his head slowly and didn’t bother to explain further.

In his eyes, although Kai Yang was very pitiful, he could tell that he was currently trying to understand something, that something could be a mental understanding or it could be a martial skill. Wrapped within that cold hurricane of air, shivering due to the cold piercing him to the core of his body, he could see a flaming hot energy within his core spreading its warmth. When this fiery energy burst outwards, perhaps he would be able to step into a new level.

If he were to succeed, then his future accomplishments definitely would not be ordinary! Su Xuan Wu had truly never seen a martial practitioner who while in such a sorry state, would actually be able to enter such a deep state of enlightenment. This was nothing short of a miracle.

“Grandpa, I’m afraid that if elder sister continues like this, then senior brother Kai Yang will die.” Su Mu cried out urgently.

Su Xuan Wu replied with a shake of his head: “Yan-er knows how to control the strength of her attacks properly, and within her attacks, there are no killing attacks; after all, she doesn’t want Kai Yang’s life.”

Finishing this statement, he then whispered to himself: “Strange.......why would Yan-er punish him like this?”

If not because Su Xuan Wu was mature and sophisticated, then he definitely wouldn’t be able to guess as to what had just happened between Su Yan and Kai Yang.

When the ice storm died down, Su Yan continued to float in the air, while Kai Yang fell towards the ground. His entire body was battered all over, his clothes torn and where you could see his skin there were signs of frostbite.

Just as he was about to hit the ground, Kai Yang suddenly did a flip and landed firmly on the ground and opened his eyes to look around.

Under the starlight, Su Yan’s white clothes fluttered about with the night breeze, she was like a fairy descending with the full moon hanging behind her. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Her grand and clean aura made people become more modest for no apparent reason.

Ka cha cha.....could be heard from all directions as ice started to form all over Kai Yang’s body. Soon, he had become an immense ice block.

The smoothness of the ice block was obvious, it was also as clear as glass. It was so clear that every single strand of Kai Yang’s hair could be seen, even his attitude and feelings could be clearly seen on his face.

Su Yan didn’t say a word, only turning to look at Kai Yang mysteriously before turning around and returning to her room.

The scene of her leaving was clearly seen by Kai Yang.

“Look after him, once he breaks free from the ice it will be the start of his success!” Su Xuan Wu solemnly told Su Mu.

Su Mu was nervous to the point that he started perspire: “Grandpa, senior Kai won’t be frozen to death, will he?”

Su Xuan Wu gently laughed: “He won’t, this is his good fortune!”

After reassuring Su Mu he turned and left.

Only then did Su Mu’s group walk up quietly and softly to the ice block containing Kai Yang. Each and everyone of them surrounded that enormous ice block, tapping away at it. But with Su Yan’s comprehension of the ice arts, would they be able to break it?

“This is bad, this is bad! Senior brother is already injured, and now that he is frozen, I’m afraid that his little brother may also become frozen and fall off. How is this good?” ** didn’t have any sort of filter, so as soon as he thought of it he said it, he was glared at by Su Mu: “Didn’t you hear my grandfather say, this is senior Kai’s good fortune, huh? Everybody don’t move, if this ice breaks and hurts senior, it won’t be good. We’ll just stand guard here.”

“Yes.” The group of people chorused.

Guarding until the fifth bell toll of the night (3-5 am in current time), there had still been no movement from the ice block and Kai Yang continued to stay in it like the living dead. His breath shallow, he could only continue to look at the place where Su Yan disappeared to.

Su Mu’s group considered the situation for a while before deciding to leave two people behind to guard Kai Yang while the rest returned to do whatever they needed to do.

This continued for an entire three days. Within a small attic was a large ice block, and inside that was a living person. Looking at it, it was as strange as strange could get.

During these past three days, they had rotated their shifts countless times and yet the ice still showed no signs of breaking. This caused the group to become so anxious that their lips were blistered.

During these three days, Kai Yang didn’t feel the flow of time; although his eyes were open, he couldn’t see anything.

All of his focus was on comprehending the changes occurring within his body.

Sensing the energy within his bones, sensing that unyielding warmth the energy brought along with it, and sensing how that warmth would boost his strength each and every time.

The ice that Su Yan left behind for him, provided him with the perfect place to comprehend what was happening accurately. The energy contained within the ice block left behind, constantly released cold air that permeated him to his core.

This cold was something that the current Kai Yang could not resist, but he managed to resists every time. Each time, he relied on the mystical properties of the golden skeleton.

Resisting hundreds of times, thousands of times, allowed Kia Yang to understand the mysteries of the golden skeleton and why it could amplify his abilities.

Within his body, a small flame had started to burn hotter and hotter, and it would do so until the day he finally comprehended what was occurring. This flame continued to burn peacefully, until it finally started to send heat waves out of Kai Yang’s body.

A breaking sound rang out!

Su Mu and Li Yun Tian who were currently on the guarding shift were startled but they quickly turned their heads around.

They only saw small numerous cracks appearing all over the ice block, with the cracks resembling the strands of a spiderweb.

“Senior Kai is about to come out!” Su Mu cried with enthusiasm and certainty.

Sure enough, as soon as he said those words, the ice block exploded and the shards melted in the light before disappearing.

Kai Yang remained standing in his previous position, his bloodstained upper body ** did look a bit weak, but his eyebrows were creased showing he was still deep in thought.

Su Mu and Li Yun Tian didn’t dare to disturb him, so they quietly waited off to the side.

After a good half an hour, Kai Yang’s worried looked disappeared and he stated in a cheerful tone: “Since it’s so, I will call you Immovable Will.”

Immovable Will was the thing that Kai Yang had gained an understanding of during these three days. This martial skill was not one you could use to attack, but rather one that helped to strengthen one’s body.

This was the skill that he had learned from the golden skeleton, so this skill was closely related to the skeleton.

Only when one has an unyielding spirit, is unwilling to surrender under any adversary, will they be able unlock this type of skill. As soon as he activates it, the golden skeleton will give him energy to temporarily increase his strength and fighting ability.

Although previously he was unknowingly activating this Immovable Will skill he didn’t have any understanding of it, with this type of martial skill there is a big difference in the power it displayed once it was understood.

In other words, he could now say that he had completely grasped this secret skill with his own hands. It could be also said it was a skill exclusive to him.

It was no longer the same as before, when he is battle and/or receives injuries, he no longer needs to rely on his stubbornness to activate the skill.

Although his harvest this time was great, Kai Yang was still a bit unsatisfied, because he could sense that there were still secrets hidden within the golden skeleton. Yet since he couldn’t see through them he couldn’t claim them, thus he couldn’t help but feel regret.

The days are long, and one shouldn’t care over one lost hour, Kai Yang consoled himself.

Only when Kia Yang started to move, did Su Mu and Li Yun Tian walk up to him, asking worriedly: “Senior Kai, are you alright?”

“Me? I’m very good!” Kai Yang moved his limbs around and found that all this past injuries had all healed.

“I shall help you put your clothes on, otherwise if elder sister were to see you again, I’m afraid she might beat you again.” Su Mu said, his voice full of worry.

p.s. First chappy of the weekkkkkk. Well, Kai Yang gaiend some insight and I’m starting to like Su Mu more and more. Cause he actually seems human and more normal than most xianxia characters.
