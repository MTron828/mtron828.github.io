The Black Ink Clan never imagined that the Human Old Ancestor would actually be hiding in the midst of the Army to launch a sneak attack. What they found even more difficult to understand was how the Old Ancestor got the strength to fight so quickly.

According to the news they had received from the rear, the Human Old Ancestor was severely wounded and would not be able to fight for the next 30 to 50 years; otherwise, they wouldn’t have continued besieging Yin-Yang Pass for so long.

The Royal Lord had fallen into a deep sleep, so their side was without a Supreme Master. Once the Human Old Ancestor took action, the Territory Lords would not be able to resist.

It was precisely because they knew that the Old Ancestor did not have the ability to fight that the Territory Lords were so fearless. As strong as those Eighth-Order Humans were, it was not easy for them to kill a Territory Lord on the battlefield; therefore, when the figure of the Old Ancestor suddenly appeared on the battlefield and killed one of the Territory Lords in the blink of an eye, the Black Ink Clan was beside themselves in shock.

The Old Ancestor didn’t stop there. She wielded her longsword again and quickly killed another Territory Lord with the cooperation of Tang Qiu and the other Eighth-Order Masters.

Two Territory Lords had fallen in succession in less than a dozen breaths, so how could the surviving Territory Lords dare to remain? All of them quickly fled, and without them to hold the line, the Black Ink Clan army instantly routed.

In a flash, the Black Ink Clan suffered heavy losses, whereas the morale of the Humans shot through the sky.

All the Territory Lords immediately focused all their energy on escaping while the Old Ancestor didn’t waste any time chasing after them; instead, she turned around and charged towards the South.

On the Southern side, the Black Ink Clan army still didn’t know what was happening on the eastern front, so the Territory Lords were still leading their Army to provide reinforcements.

Before they could arrive though, they were directly intercepted by Eighth-Order Division Commanders led by their Old Ancestor.

In the initial clash, another Territory Lord was swiftly killed off by the Old Ancestor, and the aura of the Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master began to spread through the surroundings, oppressing the entire battlefield.

Three Territory Lords had died, the Eastern front had collapsed, and the Southern front had been thrown into chaos with the sudden appearance of the Old Ancestor. By now, the Territory Lords in the North and West of Yin-Yang Pass had sensed the Old Ancestor’s aura. They knew that things were not looking good, so they decisively threw a bunch of cannon fodder to divert the attention of the Humans while they led their elites to escape from the battlefield, running towards the Black Ink Clan territory without even looking back, fearing that the Old Ancestor would pursue them.

Since the battle had reached this point, the Black Ink Clan could no longer turn the tide. Only a cup of tea had passed since the appearance of the Old Ancestor, and yet three Territory Lords had died by her hand while many weaker the Black Ink Clansmen were annihilated from the fallout of her attacks. The Black Ink Clan was utterly defeated. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Without the suppression of a Royal Lord on the battlefield, the Old Ancestor was simply too intimidating to the Black Ink Clan.

The Black Ink Clan army was fleeing everywhere like stray dogs, so naturally, the Human Race would not miss such a good opportunity. The four Armies pursued the enemy under the leadership of their respective Army Commanders, leaving a bloody trail behind them.

Yang Kai didn’t participate in the battle, for as extraordinary as his strength might be, one more person on such a battlefield in the Seventh Order was not going to make a significant difference. His task was to escort the Old Ancestor back to the Great Pass.

After recuperating for two years in his Small Universe, the Old Ancestor had only managed to recover enough strength to kill three Territory Lords. The Old Ancestor was no longer able to continue after killing the third Territory Lord.

Even if the Black Ink Clan didn’t retreat, it would have been impossible for the Old Ancestor to attack again. Be that as it may, the Black Ink Clan Territory Lords were completely terrified by the appearance of the Old Ancestor, so how could they dare to remain after sensing her presence?

This gave the Humans an opportunity to pursue and slaughter. In the battle between two races, this was the best opportunity to increase one’s Military Merits. Many Eighth-Order Division Commanders deeply understood this principle, so how could they let this chance pass?

Nonetheless, the Humans didn’t dare to pursue the enemy too far and began to withdraw their forces and return to the Pass after 10 days.

The Black Ink Clan Army had suffered heavy losses in this battle and it would take them at least 100 years to replenish their forces. If the Territory Lords’ casualties and the consequences of the Black Ink Nests’ destruction were factored in on top of that, it would probably take several hundred to 1,000 years for the Black Ink Clan in Yin-Yang Theatre to recover.

This battle could be considered a great victory!

The morale of Yin-Yang Pass’ soldiers was still pretty high after the battle. The battle between the two Races had resulted in casualties on the Human Race’s side too, but their casualties were within acceptable limits compared to the losses suffered by the Black Ink Clan.

After calculating the Military Merits, Yang Kai naturally received the highest reward.

Leaving aside the fact that he infiltrated the Black Ink Clan’s domain, ruined their grand plan, and rescued 300 Artifact Refiners, just the destruction of the 10 Mid-Rank Black Ink Nest was something no one could compare to. Not only did he discover many secrets about the Black Ink Clan, he had also brought the Old Ancestor back to the Great Pass. Each of these feats was of great merit.

Yang Kai might have belonged to Blue Sky Pass, but his contributions this time were not small. Furthermore, Yin-Yang Pass had also made an exception to record his Military Merits.

Yang Kai could exchange them for anything he wanted from Yin-Yang Pass’ War Materials Palace with his Military Merits; however, he had looted a huge number of resources from the Black Ink Clan already, so he didn’t need to worry about his own cultivation and naturally didn’t need to exchange for anything at the moment.

After the battle ended, Yang Kai did not immediately return to Blue Sky Pass; instead, he opened the portals to the Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens in the periphery of the Pass at the behest of Tang Qiu and the other Army Commanders.

There were multitudes of hidden Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens around each Great Pass which were all left behind by High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Masters who had died in battle. It was true for Blue Sky Pass, and so was it for Yin-Yang Pass.

Yang Kai had already opened the portals to the Universe Paradises and Universe Cave Heavens around Blue Sky Pass, and the Array Masters back there had set up multitudes of restrictions and traps inside of them to deal with the Black Ink Clan Army in the future.

Yin-Yang Pass had heard about this matter, so it was only natural for them to follow suit. Unfortunately, these hidden gates were difficult to find, unless one was proficient in the Dao of Space like Yang Kai.

Over the next few months, Yang Kai had been searching around the periphery of Yin-Yang Pass to open these hidden portals, and as long as one was opened, Array Masters would get to work.

After finishing these tasks, Yang Kai began searching for the entrance to the Sealed World portals further afield. It took him almost two years to finish everything.

After returning to Yin-Yang Pass, the Purifying Light in the four Purifying Black Ink Battleships still needed to be replenished, so he had to act again.

Taking into consideration the fact that the Southern Army Commander Wu Qing had one of the Four Universe Pillars, Yang Kai gave him a number of Small Stone Race members to let him raise them inside his Small Universe. It was like a priceless gift to Wu Qing.

He was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but he was not far from breaking through to the Ninth-Order. Now that he had the Small Stone Race, the time it would take him to advance had been reduced.

Everything was ready.

The Marketplace was extremely lively at this moment, just like the first time Yang Kai had come here. The entire street was crowded and bustling with activity, like a mortal city.

But compared to his initial confusion, Yang Kai now knew that this Marketplace was built to treat the Old Ancestor’s injuries.

After easily finding the Old Ancestor, who happened to be listening to a story in the teahouse, Yang Kai sat down next to her without any trace of politeness.

The speaker on the stage was an Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master whom Yang Kai didn’t recognize. Yang Kai had no idea which Division Commander he was, but he seemed to be telling some kind of fantastical story. It was wonderful and a few among the audience were cheering in excitement.

Yang Kai’s brow couldn’t help twitching as he really couldn’t get used to this kind of scene; after all, everyone in the audience was a powerful Open Heaven Realm Master.

“Are you leaving?” The Old Ancestor asked casually while stuffing food into her mouth.

Yang Kai nodded his agreement, “Everything here has been taken care of, so there’s nothing left for me to do.”

“It’s been hard on you all these years. You’ve been running all over the place and haven’t had time to rest.”

“It is this Junior’s duty,” Yang Kai replied.

“En, when you get back, you should focus on your cultivation and strive to break through to the Eighth Order as soon as possible. In the end, the Seventh Order is not enough to ensure your safety on this Black Ink Battlefield.”

“Junior understands,” Yang Kai replied respectfully. He hesitated for a moment before asking, “Does the Old Ancestor need help to heal? If the Old Ancestor needs it, the Junior will not hesitate.”

The Old Ancestor answered with a smile, “There’s no need, healing here is the same. Although the speed can’t be compared to your Small Universe’s, the Black Ink Clan’s forces have suffered heavy casualties and there won’t be any war for the next several hundred years or more, so the speed of my recovery isn’t important.”

Yang Kai was just about to nod when the Old Ancestor suddenly added, “Why don’t you come to Yin-Yang Pass? You’re half a disciple of Yin-Yang Heaven, so it’s only right and proper for you to come here.”

Yang Kai replied, “This Junior cannot make the decision on this matter. If the Old Ancestor really wants this Junior to come to Yin-Yang Pass, Blue Sky Pass must be informed. If Blue Sky Pass allows it, I will not refuse.”

The Old Ancestor chuckled, “It was just a casual remark, don’t take it seriously. Since you’re a Human, no matter where you are, as long as you fight against the Black Ink Clan, it’s all the same. It does not matter which Great Pass you belong to.”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded and accompanied the Old Ancestor for a while before standing up and stating, “This Junior will take his leave then!”

“Go on,” the Old Ancestor waved him off.

After leaving the Marketplace, Yang Kai went straight to some place inside the Inner Sanctum and stopped in front of a small courtyard.

There was a barrier outside the courtyard, obviously to prevent anyone from disturbing its occupant. Be that as it may, Yang Kai didn’t pay it any heed and simply lifted his hand to touch it. Soon, a portal opened before Yang Kai entered inside.

In the courtyard, Blood Crow sat up straight and glanced over, “What is it?”

Yang Kai smiled, “Nothing important, I’m preparing to return to Blue Sky Pass, so I came to see you before I left.”

Blood Crow immediately became sullen, “Since when were we friends?”

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed a few bottles of wine out of thin air before placing them on the table in front of Blood Crow.

Blood Crow looked at the wine and then at Yang Kai before clicking his tongue, “Are you trying to make friends with me with just these few bottles? Have you forgotten what you did to me?”

Yang Kai placed two bowls, filled them with wine, and picked one up, “Let me ask you, do you want to drink it or not?”

Blood Crow remained silent for a moment before picking up a bottle, unsealing it, and then pouring it.

Yang Kai didn’t pay attention to this and just lifted his bowl.

They didn’t talk much, just kept drinking.

After drinking a few bottles, Yang Kai stood up and stated in a slightly drunk manner, “Brother Blood Crow, the battlefield is dangerous, and fighting alone will not guarantee your safety. All the Humans here are wearing the same robe, I hope that when next I come to Yin-Yang Pass, I will see you again.”

Saying so, he waved his hand and turned to leave.

Watching him disappear, Blood Crow snorted, “How boring!”
