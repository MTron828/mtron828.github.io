The cultivators in the hall instantly fell silent as they ogled at the stage with their eyes widened. Even the Emperor Realm Masters who were sitting in their private rooms could not help stretching out their necks to have a peek at the breathtaking scene before them.

“So many Source Crystals! I’ve never seen so many Source Crystals in my life!”

“They are all High-Rank Source Crystals, authentic High-Rank Source Crystals!”

“Such a big pile, there must be at least a hundred million!”

“Sir, this slave wants to have a baby with you! Please spare this slave a glance…”

All the cultivators sitting in the lower hall exploded. Their cultivations weren’t high, so the cultivation resources that they could obtain were always limited. They had never seen so many Source Crystals before, not to mention they were all High-Rank Source Crystals. Such a huge sum of wealth was enough to send them into a state of insanity.

If such a fortune fell into their hands, they would not have to worry about their cultivation for the rest of their lives. Even their future generations would not have to worry about resources for a thousand years.

*Gudong… *

The sound of gulps came from the various private rooms one after another. While floored with disbelief, these Emperors’ eyes were filled with covetousness, because it was no less eye-opening for them than it was for the cultivators in the hall to see this many Source Crystals all at once.

“He really has so many High-Rank Source Crystals…” The old man in room seven muttered in disbelief, his face twitching. Apart from feeling shocked, he also felt uneasy and frightened because he had made such an outrageous boast when he got mad earlier. For a moment, he felt a chill on his neck and subconsciously touched it.

But soon, he sneered.

[So what if this brat can take out a hundred million High-Rank Source Crystals? I’m a First-Order Emperor as well and have been one for centuries. How could it be possible for me to lose to this young man? If he is smart enough, he should now try to minimize the conflict, but if he still wants to pester me endlessly, I will teach him a lesson.]

[Moreover, this little brat has long infuriated everyone and does not understand the principle of not exposing one’s wealth, going so far as to recklessly show off his treasures. If we really have to fight here, I’m certain many others won’t just stand by and watch. At least, the friend in room thirteen will certainly help.]

Considering all this, the old man was instantly relieved.

On the stage, Yang Kai casually waved his hand again, and another pile of High-Rank Source Crystals appeared at once. The amount this time was even higher than in the previous pile.

“Ssii…”

The sound of deep inhalation was heard from all around as everyone stared at the Source Crystals on the stage stupidly, as if they were all petrified. The radiance of these High-Rank Source Crystals was dazzling, making everyone restless.

It was not over yet though as this was followed by a third pile, then a fourth …

In just a moment, the whole stage was almost buried in High-Rank Source Crystals, and the permeating World Energy had all but become liquid. Every cultivator in the auction venue felt that both their minds and bodies were reborn.

“Ah, my bottleneck… My bottleneck is loosening, I’m about to break through!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Someone shouted loudly with a face full of pleasant surprise.

Before he finished speaking, an aura suddenly burst out; someone else had made a breakthrough before him.

*Hong hong hong… *

Auras inflated rapidly one after another. There were about one hundred cultivators who broke through their shackles with the assistance of the extremely rich World Energy, reaching the next realm.

Those cultivators who did not make a breakthrough were also full of joy though as every one of them madly circulated their Secret Art to absorb the dense World Energy.

These people did not have high cultivations or good cultivation resources. The places where they chose to cultivate in retreat were not excellent places either; however, because of the hundreds of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals that Yang Kai took out, he had created a kind of cultivation paradise that was comparable to the greatest cultivation rooms of top Sects.

Given this environment, it was a matter of course that they could break through their bottlenecks.

“My hero…” Someone cried his heart out. This person had been stuck at the peak of Second-Order Saint King Realm for thirty years and had thought that he would never be able to take another step further in his life, but today he had actually met such a good opportunity.

“Young hero, please accept my bow!” Another person stood up and bowed sincerely to Yang Kai who was standing on the stage.

More and more people stood up to offer their gratitude.

Yang Kai looked at them with a smile and did not stop those people from absorbing the World Energy emitted by his Source Crystals.

He had gained an absurd amount of wealth in the Ancient Wild Lands and again when he emptied the Treasury of Seeking Passion Sect. Just in High-Rank Source Crystals, he had more than a billion on him. A small loss of World Energy meant nothing to him.

From the wealth that he had now, a small donation was enough for these cultivators to use for their entire lives.

Backstage, Wu Ming stared at the High-Rank Source Crystals with scorching eyes, gulping hard as greed filled his mind, [Mine. It’s all mine!]

He did not expect Yang Kai’s wealth to be so great. Since hundreds of millions of High-Rank Source Crystals were just something that he could take out casually, this meant there must be even greater treasures in his Space Ring. If he could take him down, wouldn’t this wealth all fall into his hands?

[No, no, it should belong to Honoured Master. But it doesn’t matter because as long as Honoured Master obtains it, I will still be able to have a share!] Considering all this, Wu Ming was exhilarated and almost laughed out loud wildly.

“You trash, have you seen clearly yet? Now tell me, is this Young Master just maliciously bidding?” Yang Kai asked with a cold tone while glaring at the crowd.

Everyone turned speechless.

Words were not proof, but with the evidence right in front of their eyes, they had no other choice but to believe. Yang Kai really managed to take out so many Source Crystals at once. He had proven himself beyond any doubt.

Saying so, Yang Kai retrieved the High-Rank Source Crystals back into his Space Ring.

The rich World Energy in the surroundings was suddenly cut off, and everyone in the hall put on a sad face. Given that these things did not belong to them and the owner was an Emperor Realm Master though, it was already a great kindness for him to even show it to them, so they could not just expect Yang Kai to keep those Source Crystals there for them to cultivate.

Many sighs could be heard for a while.

“I’m glad that you all have no comment,” Yang Kai grinned, then turned to room seven, “Old thing, it’s time to fulfil your promise.”

“What promise, I don’t understand!” The old man in room seven yelled angrily.

“How dare you not keep your word!” Yang Kai’s face turned grim, “Who was the old bastard who said that if this Young Master could take out one hundred million Source Crystal, he would take down his own head and let me kick it like a ball? How dare you deny it. Are you that thick-skinned?”

The old man snorted coldly, “Can jokes be taken seriously?”

Yang Kai retorted in a deep voice, “Old thing, you really are shameless. I’ll count to three, if you don’t take down your head, don’t blame this Young Master for doing it for you.”

“Boy, how dare you!” The old man was maddened. After all, they were both First-Order Emperor Realm Masters, so he did not expect Yang Kai to not show him the slightest respect. Although he did make such a promise out of anger, anyone would understand that he was not being serious. Why would he follow through now?

“One!” Yang Kai ignored him and started counting.

“Little brat, don’t take things too far. This Old Master is the Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect. Do you want to make enemies of my Grey Sky Sect?” Seeing the determined look on Yang Kai’s face, the old man hurriedly revealed his identity in hopes of making Yang Kai back down.

“Two!” Yang Kai was unaffected as he called again coldly.

What thing was Grey Sky Sect to Yang Kai? He had even dared to annihilate the Seeking Passion Sect, so why would he fear some unknown Grey Sky Sect?

The old man was now beginning to panic. He did not expect Yang Kai to be serious. Was this little brat crazy? The two of them had equal cultivation and there was no deep hatred between them. Was it really necessary to take things to this extent?

However, he had no idea that a trivial First-Order Emperor Realm and a trivial Grey Sky Sect were nothing in Yang Kai’s eyes.

If he was a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, Yang Kai might still consider bargaining a bit.

The old man gritted his teeth, and tossed his gaze in the direction of room thirteen, using his Divine Sense to communicate with the Emperor Realm Master there, “Friend, this little brat is insane. How about we join hands to take him down? Otherwise, given his attitude, he will target you after he finishes dealing with this Old Master. It’s better if we strike first, then split his hundreds of millions of Source Crystals between us evenly!”

The Emperor Realm Master’s face in room thirteen darkened too, because Yang Kai was simply too overbearing. He also knew that the old man was right. Previously, he proclaimed he would eat three kilograms of shit just to annoy Yang Kai, but he did not expect Yang Kai to be able to locate him even though he had deliberately hidden his position.

While he was still worrying that Yang Kai would also want him to fulfil his promise, the old man sent a Divine Sense Message.

After being motivated by the hundreds of millions of Source Crystals, this middle-aged man nodded as he replied without a second thought, “Good!”

The old man was ecstatic, thinking to himself, [Little brat, since you court death, don’t blame this Old Master for being ruthless.]

“Three!” After Yang Kai shouted, he stared coldly at room seven and nodded, “Very good, it seems you won’t shed tears unless you see your own coffin. In that case, let this Young Master help you!”

He shot towards room seven and sent out a punch.

A loud explosion, followed by a sudden appearance of a light barrier covered room seven. The barrier successfully blocked Yang Kai’s attack as it flashed brilliantly.

The private rooms in the auction were guarded by stronger barriers meant to protect the privacy and safety of important guests. For top-notched auction houses, these barriers were generally sufficient to defend against the spying of a Third-Order Emperor Realm Master, and even handle a few attacks from one.

Although Flowing Shadow City was not a small city, it was not a big city either; as such, the Spirit Arrays in this branch of Seven Glories Chamber of Commerce were only able to defend against the attacks of ordinary First-Order and Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters.

They were essentially useless against Third-Order Emperors.

However, there were not many Masters of this level and they were even more rarely seen. Even if such a Master appeared, each of them was a noble existence who would not commit such rude actions.

“Hahaha!” The Sect Master of Grey Sky Sect in room seven burst into laughter after seeing Yang Kai suffer a setback, “Little brat, do you think you alone can cause this Old Master trouble? You should go back and cultivate for another… Ah!”

In the middle of his boasting, he suddenly screamed as if he had seen something horrifying.

Everyone looked towards the room, their eyes bulging as they found what they saw impossible to believe.

A slight crack had actually appeared on the light barrier around room seven.
