The battle between Zi Long and Ni Guang started instantly.

Xu Wei and Kong Fa looked up at the terrifying scene in the sky and trembled, deeply feeling their own weakness.

As Origin Kings, they always had eyes atop their heads, but they were just First-Order after all. Now that they had a chance to witness an all-out battle between Second-Order masters, they immediately understood the gap between them.

Both Ni Guang and Zi Long were so strong, what about Gui Zu, who was at the same level as them?

The two people had the same thoughts as they glanced over towards Gui Zu.

Gui Zu had not moved to attack them and was instead standing next to Yang Kai to guard him. Gui Zu understood the priority at this moment and naturally placed Yang Kai’s safety above defeating Xu Wei and Kong Fa. As long as these two people didn’t move, Gui Zu wouldn’t bother with them.

However, Gui Zu did not expect that Xu Wei’s life was not his to control, and was actually clenched in Zi Dong’s hands.

Seeing that his father and Ni Guang were already fighting, Zi Dong wanted to contribute as well and immediately sent a message to Xu Wei, telling him to attack Gui Zu.

Xu Wei’s face was extremely ugly as he cursed Zi Dong vehemently in his heart.

However, with his Soul Brand in Zi Dong’s hands, he did not dare refuse and could only try to rope his old friend into this turbid water. Thinking quickly on his feet, Xu Wei calmed himself and whispered to Kong Fa, “Brother Kong, our opportunity is here.”

Kong Fa frowned, “Brother Xu, by opportunity you mean... we should attack that little brat now?”

“Exactly.”

“Are you trying to kill yourself? That old monster next to that boy is not affable. Even if you and I team up, we will not necessarily be his opponents,” Kong Fa was taken aback.

“Brother Kong, riches and danger always appear together! Since you and I reached the Origin King Realm, have we ever had any opportunities to reach another breakthrough? Do you want to remain a First-Order forever? The Immortal Tree is a supreme treasure that few will ever see in their lifetimes. If we miss this opportunity this time, this Xu will not be able to accept it. Hence, this Xu is willing to fight. So what if we end up losing our lives?” Xu Wei earnestly spun his words, trying to drag Kong Fa down with him as there was no way he would challenge Gui Zu on his own.

Kong Fa’s face could not help becoming solemn, as if he was considering his options.

Seeing this, Xu Wei struck while the iron was hot and said, “You and I don’t have to defeat that old man. Now that Ni Guang is entangled by Zi Long, we just need to distract that old man while one of us seizes the opportunity to attack that boy. As long as we can catch that brat, it will surely tie that old man’s hands.”

“That may be so, but...” Kong Fa was still hesitant.

“Brother Kong, this Xu is willing to be the one distracting that old man while you take the opportunity to deal with that boy,” Xu Wei did not have the option to refuse, so he immediately offered to take on the more dangerous role.

Kong Fa trembled slightly as he stared at Xu Wei in amazement, truly somewhat moved as he said, “Brother Xu, you...”

The Xu Wei that Kong Fa knew was not such a bold and daring individual, so seeing him willingly take on danger surprised Kong Fa somewhat.

Xu Wei simply laughed, however, and said, “I just hope that if Brother Kong succeeds, he won’t forget this Xu’s contributions!”

“Naturally!” Kong Fa was finally moved by Xu Wei and quickly said, “Brother Xu, since you are willing to go so far, it would be unreasonable for this Kong to refuse. Let us do this! If this Kong really succeeds, we will split the Immortal Tree evenly between us!”

“En!” Xu Wei was overjoyed and thought to himself that he had finally managed to drag his old friend into this mess.

After the two finished their negotiations, they did not delay and began condensing their Saint Qi as they directed menacing gazes towards Yang Kai.

“Heh heh heh...” Gui Zu grinned strangely, “Can’t hold yourselves back anymore? It just so happens that this old master was getting bored standing here like this. You two brats, come entertain this old master.”

As Gui Zu finished speaking, the huge ghost head suspended midair suddenly roared, opened its black mouth, and bit towards Kong Fa and Xu Wei.

The pair were taken aback and dispersed quickly, summoning their artifacts and using their Secret Techniques to bombard the ghost head as they fled.

Gui Zu was not hurried and simply waved his hand lightly, causing the ghost head to split in half, causing the two men’s attacks to miss. The divided ghost head halves distorted and transformed into two smaller ghost heads then that pursued their respective targets.

Both Xu Wei and Kong Fa’s faces sank, only now realizing they had still underestimated Gui Zu. It would not be easy for either of them to escape the chase of these ghost heads, let alone get close enough to Yang Kai to attack him.

For a time, the Divine Bird’s nest became extremely active and lively, with fierce battles raging in the sky and on the ground

Yang Kai, under the protection of Xue Yue and Gui Zu, safely controlled his Embodiment to advance into the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.

Soon, the Embodiment arrived at the Immortal Tree.

Through the Embodiment, Yang Kai was able to see this Immortal Tree clearly, and when he got up close to it, he could truly feel just how dense and rich the vitality contained within it was.

He had heard the rumours about the Immortal Tree before and knew that it was supposedly a relic of antiquity that had long ago disappeared in the river of history, but now, he was actually seeing one in this Severed World.

This was a supreme treasure that could grant one an immortal and indestructible body! It was even more valuable than Yang Kai’s Seven Coloured Soul Warming Lotus, and it is now in front of his eyes!

Yang Kai could not help feeling a bit agitated and had to forcefully calm himself down before controlling the Embodiment to uproot the Immortal Tree.

The two palms of the Stone Puppet Embodiment gripped tightly to the roots of the Immortal Tree and then began pulling up with some slight force.

What surprised Yang Kai though was that the Immortal Tree did not move at all! This small sapling seemed to be permanently rooted in the ground.

He could not help increasing his strength...

Still no improvement.

Yang Kai did not believe he couldn’t succeed and further increased the force he used...

Repeating this process a few times, Yang Kai only became more shocked.

Although his Stone Puppet Embodiment had not swallowed too many rare ores and had thus not grown its strength greatly, as a Stone Puppet it was born with great innate power. However, Yang Kai was now controlling his Embodiment to use all its strength, but it was still unable to even shake the Immortal Tree. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This Immortal Tree simply could not be pulled out!

However, what shocked Yang Kai even more was that the Immortal Tree remained undamaged despite such great force!

If it were any normal tree, it would likely have been crushed to splinters already.

It seemed that Ni Guang and Zi Long’s puppets failing to obtain the Immortal Tree before was not because they were interfering with each other, but because the two puppets themselves were not strong enough to pull this sapling out.

At that time, even if they worked together, there was no hope they could obtain the Immortal Tree!

“Is it still not enough?” Yang Kai muttered to himself and his eyes flashed, the next moment waving his hand and summoning out Xiao Xiao!

If one Stone Puppet weren’t strong enough, perhaps two would be. Yang Kai knew of the potential risk, but the reward was too much to not attempt it.

Moreover, Xiao Xiao had swallowed countless rare ores and was many, many times stronger than Yang Kai’s Embodiment.

As soon as Xiao Xiao appeared, he received instructions from Yang Kai and immediately rushed towards the Immortal Tree.

Soon, Xiao Xiao charged into the Seven Coloured Radiant Light!

The suppression from the Seven Coloured Radiant Light pressed from all directions towards Xiao Xiao’s body, but before he could even stumble, he released a profound energy fluctuation from his figure which completely offset it.

Xiao Xiao only paused slightly before he ran forward again unimpeded, moving through the Seven Coloured Radiant Light as if it were nothing but air.

“This is... Principal Strength?” Yang Kai was taken aback. Although his Soul Clone was controlling the Embodiment, his own senses were not personally affected, so he could still clearly perceive the changes around Xiao Xiao.

Just now, the strange power fluctuations that emerged from Xiao Xiao’s body were similar to World Principles!

Yang Kai was quite familiar with this kind of aura as he was the Star Master of Shadowed Star and had experienced its World Principles multiple times. Although the Principal Strength coming from Xiao Xiao’s body was extremely weak, it was no doubt real.

[Since when had Xiao Xiao been able to manifest such power?] Yang Kai frowned as he thought about it. The sentience of Stone Puppets wasn’t high, and Xiao Xiao couldn’t have simply comprehended Principal Strength on his own. The only possibility was that some Xiao Xiao had obtained this ability from some external source.

But when did such an event happen?

Reasoning through this scenario, Yang Kai quickly came up with a hypothesis.

On the Ore Star, Xiao Xiao had once swallowed the remnants of its Star Source and then fallen into a deep slumber for a time. Back then, Yang Kai had thought that Xiao Xiao would become stronger after waking up.

But when Xiao Xiao re-awakened, he had not experienced any kind of change, causing Yang Kai to be a little disappointed.

Now, it appeared that Xiao Xiao had experienced a significant change, it was just that it had yet to manifest at the time!

After devouring the Ore Star’s remnant Star Source, Xiao Xiao had clearly obtained some slight traces of Principal Strength, and although this power was quite weak, it was more than enough to counter the Seven Coloured Radiant Light.

Principal Strength was an extremely profound power!

While Yang Kai was distracted, Xiao Xiao arrived beside the Embodiment, stood on the opposite side of the Immortal Tree, and grabbed hold of its roots.

The next moment, a deep roar came from Xiao Xiao’s throat and his two small eyes narrowed, a clear sign he was exerting a great deal of strength.

*Kacha...*

From underground, a vague cracking sound rang out.

The Immortal Tree, which had so far been motionless, was finally shaken by the force being applied to it and the tiny sapling was clearly being pulled out at a subtle speed, causing the surrounding ground to crack as a result.

As the Immortal Tree was being pulled out, the aura in the surrounding region began to fluctuate wildly, setting off an incredible chain reaction.

“This is...” Gui Zu stopped his battle with Xu Wei and Kong Fa to concentrate on the changes occurring around him, his expression extremely solemn as he quickly discovered that, within the surrounding several-thousand-kilometre radii his Divine Sense could cover, the ambient World Energy and aura was rapidly gathering towards the Immortal Tree. In just a short period of time, the aura inside the medicine valley had been greatly reduced.

If this continued, it would likely be difficult to grow any valuable medicinal herbs here in the future.

“This Immortal Tree is actually closely connected with the vitality of the entire medicine valley?!” Gui Zu realized what was happening and his eyes bulged in shock.

At that moment, a piercing cry rang out from the far horizon, one that contained clear and extreme anger, causing Gui Zu’s face to pale.
