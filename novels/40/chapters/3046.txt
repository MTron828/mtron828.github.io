Fu Ling grabbed her own hair and fiddled with it as she spoke nonchalantly, “I’m a Purple Dragon who was born with the Ever-Changing Innate Ability, so it isn’t surprising that I could turn into some rocks.”

“Ever-Changing Innate Ability!” Yang Kai exclaimed, “An impressive Divine Ability!”

If he hadn’t allowed his Emperor Qi to explode and noticed that something was off, he would have been fooled by her. Despite that, he wasn’t so certain himself, which was why he pretended to have left the place while actually hiding nearby to observe.

He didn’t expect that he would really catch someone, and that person turned out to be Fu Ling. Because of Fu Chi, he was generally resentful of all those that were in the Fu Clan. He especially loathed Fu Ling’s promiscuity, but now that she had eavesdropped on his secret discussion with Zhu Lie, it would cause him huge trouble if this matter wasn’t handled properly.

Finally sensing that something was amiss, Fu Ling knitted her brows and looked around cautiously.

“If you’re waiting for help, I’m sorry to disappoint you, but none will be coming.”

Fu Ling’s expression changed as she muttered, “This isn’t an Illusion Array! Is this a Small World?”

Just now, when the view changed as she was transported from that Spirit Island to this strange place, she thought that Yang Kai had used an Illusion Array to confine her. Now, she realized that they were in a Small World instead of an Illusion Array.

Upon that realization, Fu Ling almost broke down, for she finally understood why her clansmen were not coming. A Small World was an independent space, so there was no way she could send her call for help across World Barriers using her Secret Technique. Without the help of her clansmen, it meant that she had to confront Yang Kai on her own.

“Damn it!” Both exasperated and shocked, she whirled around and turned into a beam of purple light, no longer calm and collected. She didn’t know what this Small World was, nor how Yang Kai managed to bring her into it; however, she knew that she was in deep trouble, so she had to flee.

Not long after she flew off though she suddenly screamed. She was being pressured from all directions, which had fixed her onto the spot, as though she had crashed into an invisible wall. At that moment, she was bound to that place and couldn’t struggle out of it.

Just then, a strange force could be felt from ahead of her, which pushed her backwards and shortened her gap with Yang Kai. She started shrieking, for it was the first time she experienced such a strange event despite her age.

[It’s World Force! It’s the power of this Small World!] Fu Ling’s gaze was transformed by fear. The fact that Yang Kai could control this Small World plunged her into a state of despair. She knew that there was no way she could go against him in this place.

In just a short moment, all her effort had gone to waste as she was now right in front of Yang Kai again. Gazing at the 45-metre-tall Half-Dragon, she was panic-stricken and yelled, “You can’t kill me!”

Unfazed, Yang Kai went on to land a palm on her with a cold expression, he wanted to vent out his anger from last night on her.

Just then, Fu Ling shouted, “I’m Zhu Lie’s woman!”

Yang Kai’s Dragon Claw stopped just a hand’s length above Fu Ling’s head as her clothes flapped in the wind brought by the palm. Still reeling from the shock, she fell on her bottom, her face completely pale.

Yang Kai looked down at her and lifted a finger before he placed a pointed Dragon Claw on her forehead, upon which, blood started streaming out of her wound, “Say that again.”

“I’m not lying. I’m really Zhu Lie’s woman!” Fu Ling’s tender body trembled uncontrollably as it was the first time she was so close to death, which was why she was suffering from a breakdown. No longer dignified as a Dragon Clan member, she looked up at him and put on a fawning smile. Due to her fear, her smile was uglier than if she was crying.

“You’re quite bold to make such a claim.” Yang Kai chuckled, but he was now in a Half-Dragon Form, so his laugh was rather eerie.

Fu Ling hurriedly replied, “It’s true. It’s the Elders’ collective decision… As well as my own request.”

Yang Kai frowned as he realized that she wasn’t lying, “What do you mean?”

“Zhu Qing will get married to Fu Chi. As compensation, someone from the Fu Clan will have to marry a Zhu Clan member. I’m the designated woman, and Zhu Lie will be my husband.”

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth twitched when he heard that.

“We’ll be one family soon…” With teary eyes, Fu Ling looked at Yang Kai in a pitiful manner, as though she was gazing at someone she admired. In a soft voice, she uttered, “Brother-in-law, all I’ve said is true.”

She seemed to be sincere when she addressed Yang Kai in such a way, and her expression was natural, as though they were indeed one family now.

With a weird expression, Yang Kai asked, “Has Zhu Lie… agreed to it?”

He was amused upon learning this news. [That brat’s taste in women is… heavy. I’m sure he knows what kind of woman Fu Ling is, so how does he have the courage to marry such a slut? Isn’t he worried that she’ll cheat on him in the future?]

Fu Ling forced a smile, “It’s not up to him. To the Elders, the most important thing for the Dragon Clan is to sustain our bloodline.”

“What a poor man.” Yang Kai sighed as he felt sorry for what Zhu Lie had to go through. [My little brother-in-law is so pitiful. If I were in his shoes, I would have blown my top.]

“Brother-in-law,” Fu Ling called out smoothly, “I didn’t intend to expose your secret. I just wanted to threaten Zhu Lie with this and make him agree to marry me. As for Fu Chi’s matter, I don’t care about it at all. Moreover, Zhu Qing is a Ninth-Order Dragon, so only a man like you is the perfect match for her. Who does Fu Chi think he is to snatch your woman? He doesn’t know his place!”

She had never flattered anyone before, so her words didn’t sound sincere, and seeing that Yang Kai remained silent, she felt extremely apprehensive. However, in order to survive, she mustered her courage and took Yang Kai’s finger before shaking it in a coquettish manner, “Brother-in-law, please trust me. I will never lie to you.”

Yang Kai looked down at her with a dispassionate expression, “It doesn’t matter whether I believe you or not.”

Fu Ling’s face turned pale again as she pressed her lips together, “Do you really want to kill me?”

Before Yang Kai could reply to her, she went on to say, “Brother-in-law, we’re one family, so I won’t complain even if you want to kill me. I shouldn’t have seen what I wasn’t supposed to see, and I shouldn’t have heard what I wasn’t supposed to hear. However, if you kill me, it will send a shock wave across the entire Dragon Island. By then, the Great Elder and the Second Elder will start an investigation and find out that you’re the culprit. When that happens, you’ll never have a chance to save Zhu Qing.”

Yang Kai frowned when he heard that. Fu Ling finally made a valid point after talking so much nonsense.

In fact, he really was hesitating whether he should kill Fu Ling or not. Inside the Sealed World Bead, it wouldn’t take him much effort to end her life as he was the Master in this place and could easily suppress her bloodline. The problem was what would happen after she was dead.

There were only a small number of Dragon Clan members, so everyone on Dragon Island would be alerted if any one of them died. If Fu Ling lost her life, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to remain hidden anymore.

Seeing that he was hesitant, Fu Ling was elated. Knowing that he was now wary of the consequences of killing her, she reckoned that she had made the right move.

With her expression turning softer, she said gently, “As long as you don’t kill me, I’ll do whatever you want me to do.”

She was kneeling on the ground with her dress wide open, and her fair bosom appeared particularly alluring under the sunlight.

Understanding the meaning behind her words, Yang Kai shifted his attention to her bosom.

Putting on a faint smile, Fu Ling extended her hand and slightly pulled at her robes, which revealed more of her body. At the same time, she felt gleeful in her heart. [He’s just a Human while I’m a member of the Dragon Clan. By just exposing my body, I’m sure he’ll be enchanted by me! Furthermore, this Human has obtained Ancestral Dragon Source. Zhu Qing managed to gain benefits from him and even broke through. I’m only in the Sixth-Order, so if I can do the same, I should be able to gain even more benefits!]

With this thought in mind, she no longer felt repulsed by his aggressive stare. Instead, she was over the moon as she now yearned for his love. With her body growing hotter, she clenched her thighs tightly.

Just then, some popping sounds could be heard, upon which Yang Kai returned to his Human form. Following that, he stretched out his hand and clenched her neck.

“Brother-in-law…” Fu Ling was blushing as she made herself look charming. At that moment, she was pretending to be shy. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Open your Knowledge Sea!” Yang Kai growled.

The shyness disappeared from Fu Ling’s face in an instant as she stared at him in shock, finally realizing his intention and turning pale as a result.

“Don’t make me repeat my words.” Yang Kai’s voice was cold, “I’ll grant your wish if you want to lose your life.”

After hesitating for a bit, Fu Ling decided to give in. With a forced smile, she replied, “Brother-in-law, please be gentle, it’s my first time.”

As soon as she lowered her Knowledge Sea’s defences, she felt a stream of pure Spiritual Energy gushing into her body.

In an instant, she felt her head growing heavy. It was really the first time she let anyone invade her Knowledge Sea, and she had given up resisting it. At that moment, she felt like she would rather die. [If I knew this would be the outcome, I wouldn’t have tailed Zhu Lie.]

At the same time, she cursed Zhu Lie in her heart.

Sending her consciousness into her Knowledge Sea, she appeared as her Soul Avatar and immediately saw Yang Kai’s figure. Yang Kai had also transformed into a Soul Avatar as he was standing on the vast waters of her Knowledge Sea. With a solemn expression, he wove a series of seals to form an Imprint.

Despite knowing what he was trying to do, Fu Ling was powerless to stop him. Standing to the side, she was extremely frustrated.

A moment later, a Seal appeared on Yang Kai’s palm and shot into Fu Ling’s Knowledge Sea. Instantly, her Knowledge Sea became volatile. Fu Ling groaned as her Soul Avatar kept shaking, as though it would disintegrate at any moment.

It took her some time before she managed to come to her senses. Raising her gaze, she realized that Yang Kai was nowhere in sight. Apparently, he had left her Knowledge Sea.

Upon checking on the Soul Imprint, she felt utterly helpless. Initially, she thought that she could dissolve the Soul Imprint with some time and effort, but upon seeing how complicated and solid it was, she gave up on the idea.

After her consciousness returned to her body, she looked apprehensively at Yang Kai and asked gently, “Brother-in-law, what do you want me to do?”

Since a Soul Imprint had been planted in her Knowledge Sea, her life or death was now up to Yang Kai to decide. Hence, she had to give in and stopped being presumptuous. Also, she had become more cautious when dealing with Yang Kai.

“Just make sure you don’t ruin my plans. I’ll leave this place in a month. By then, you’ll be set free.”

“Good.” Fu Ling appeared to be obsequious.
