The Wind and Thunder Divine Spear was a relic left behind by the Seeking Passion Great Emperor, so it was undeniably powerful.

However, Yang Kai already possessed countless treasures, so he did not fancy it very much, thinking he could just keep it and give it away in the future.

“Go and help Ice Heart Valley deal with the cleanup,” Yang Kai motioned lightly to the three Monster Kings.

The three Monster Kings vanished without saying a word.

In Ice Heart Valley, shouts and battle clashes of different sizes were heard from time to time, mixed with the occasional scream. However, the screams were almost uniformly those of men. It seemed that the invading enemy was getting slaughtered.

There were more than thirty Emperor Realm Master corpses on the ground now. No one would have thought that in just a stick of incense worth of time, all of these Masters would be sent to the underworld.

Yang Kai seized their Space Rings one by one.

“Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!”

At this moment, someone shouted from the side.

Yang Kai turned his head to look, and drawled lightly, “Why is Grandmaster Nanmen still here? Didn’t you already enjoy the good show? Or are you still planning to stay in Ice Heart Valley as a guest? Ice Heart Valley has never welcomed men, so Grandmaster Nanmen should probably leave now.”

Nanmen Da Jun had been witnessing the entire process from the side. Neither Ice Heart Valley nor Seeking Passion Sect had attacked him, so he was still safe and sound.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s warning, he grinned meaningfully and returned cheekily, “Isn’t Young Master Yang also a man?”

Yang Kai snorted, “How can you compare yourself with this Young Master?”

[Such shameless boasting!] Nanmen Da Jun scoffed, but he did not have the arrogant demeanour of a top Array Master; after all, from the standpoint of Ice Heart Valley, he really could not be compared to Yang Kai, since Yang Kai was the reason Ice Heart Valley could be preserved today. Nanmen Da Jun rubbed his hands while he trailed off, “Young Master, this one wants to ask you something…”

“No comment!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, having no interest in talking to him.

Although Nanmen Da Jun was an Array Master renowned in this generation, Yang Kai was quite capable as well. He was an Emperor Alchemist, and there was no need to lower his status before others, especially when the person in question was hugely responsible for the crisis in Ice Heart Valley. He was fortunate that Yang Kai did not straight up kill him, yet, he still dared to ask for more.

“Young Master Yang, don’t be so cold,” Nanmen Da Jun gave a dry laugh, still unwilling to yield, “I would just like to inquire about something. If Young Master Yang could inform me, this Nanmen would be very thankful.”

Without waiting for Yang Kai’s refusal, he suddenly lowered his voice, “Young Master Yang, those three Monster Kings… came from the Eastern Territory, right?”

As soon as he said this, Yang Kai’s eyes turned cold and he cast a stern gaze towards Nanmen Da Jun, warning him in a deep voice, “I didn’t expect a man of your age would speak so recklessly. Be careful of what comes out of your mouth.”

Xi Lei and the other Monster Kings were brought out from the Ancient Wild Lands. Although it was only three of them, if rumours of three Monster Kings coming out of the wilderness were to spread, it would arouse the disapproval of the Masters of the Human Race, especially if these Monster Kings were from the Ancient Wild Lands.

Some people might even wonder if the Monster Race in the Ancient Wild Lands had come out to harm the Human Race Sects out of boredom. If this happened, it would be troublesome for Yang Kai.

“So, they really are from that place?” Nanmen Da Jun turned a deaf ear to Yang Kai’s warning, his eyes flashing as he cupped his fists positively and promised, “Don’t worry, Young Master Yang. This will only be between you and me, this Nanmem will never publicize it.”

“Hmph!” Yang Kai looked at him disdainfully, wondering if he should silence the witness to the crime.

Nanmen Da Jun seemed reckless, but was thinking clearly. As soon as he sensed Yang Kai’s murderous intent, he was secretly surprised and hurriedly pleaded, “Don’t be angry, Young Master Yang, this Nanmen was just interested in the many ancient restrictions and natural Spirit Arrays hidden in that place. I have gone in and out of that place to study them several times before, but my strength is too low, so I didn’t dare venture too deeply. It was quite regrettable that I didn’t manage to discover anything! It seems that Young Master Yang’s relationship with those three Sirs is… extraordinary. Do you think you can speak…”

“What are you talking about? This Young Master doesn’t understand. Don’t even mention it again!” Yang Kai interrupted him unceremoniously.

Yang Kai knew what Nanmen Da Jun meant before he even finished speaking. He just wanted to take advantage of Yang Kai’s relationship with Xi Lei and the others so that he could enter the Ancient Wild Lands in the future to study the restrictions and Spirit Arrays left behind there from ancient times.

He was the Array Grandmaster after all, so while he might not be interested in other things, Nanmen Da Jun was naturally quite eager to learn about anything related to Spirit Arrays.

Nanmen Da Jun opened his mouth, as if he wanted to say something, but finally sighed heavily, comforting himself in his heart that there would still be a lot of chances in the future.

Nanmen Dajun spoke again, changing the topic, “Since Young Master is unwilling to talk more about this, then this Nanmen will not insist. However, there’s another thing I would need Young Master Yang’s guidance on. It’s about the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai could not help being surprised, “Does Grandmaster know about the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation?”

Nanmen Da Jun had obviously seen Bing Yun and others form the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation earlier, but Yang Kai had not expected him to have such sharp vision, actually recognizing this core technique of Black Tortoise Sect from ten thousand years ago. It seemed that he was really worthy of his title as an Array Grandmaster.

This much was already apparent, however, as if he was only fishing for fame and recognition, he would not have been able to break Ice Heart Valley’s Defending Array.

“Young Master Yang must be joking. This Nanmen is an expert in these matters,” Nanmen Da Jun chuckled happily, “This Nanmen would be blind if he could not recognize such a famous Formation in front of his eyes.”

“So, what if it is the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation? Do you want the arrangement method?” Yang Kai looked at him with interest.

Nanmen Da Jun rubbed his hands, and began somewhat embarrassingly, “If I have the opportunity, of course I would like to study…”

“Hmph!” Yang Kai sneered, “Don’t even think about it.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Nanmen Da Jun was startled and asked, “Why?”

“There’s no why, just forget about it,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Nanmen Da Jun spat angrily, “Don’t be too arrogant, Young Master Yang! Senior Bing Yun is kind, and I believe that as long as I’m sincere, she will not necessarily reject this Nanmen’s request.”

He had spoken with Yang Kai politely earlier mainly because Nanmen Da Jun felt ashamed and also wanted to form a good relationship. He only wanted to study the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation, but Yang Kai was now strongly rebuffing him.

[That’s too foul! What gives him the right to say that?] The Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation was set up by the people of Ice Heart Valley. Nanmen Da Jun had only come to Yang Kai to ask him to put in a few good words, so it was also fine if he didn’t want to help, but what gave him the right to refuse, and even tell him to stop thinking about it in the future?

The unparalleled, mysterious Formation that had been lost for ten thousand years had suddenly appeared in front of him. Nanmen Da Jun would lose the heart to delve into the Dao of Spirit Arrays if he did not insist on pursuing the Seven Points Black Tortoise Formation.

“Oh, someone lost his temper!” Yang Kai looked at him with a cunning smile.

“Hmph! This Nanmen won’t talk to you further. I’ll go to see Senior Bing Yun.” Nanmen Da Jun flicked his sleeve, turned around and walked away frustratedly.

Yang Kai snorted, “Go, go, don’t come crawling back to me begging.”

[Only a ghost would beg you!] Nanmen Da Jun retorted to himself, but at the thought of Ancient Wild Lands… He held his tongue. He was still obsessed with the restrictions and Spirit Arrays in the Ancient Wild Lands, and it seemed that with a few good words from Yang Kai, he would be able to explore that place without fear of the Monster Race. This might even allow him to obtain a breakthrough in his comprehension of Spirit Arrays.

However, Nanmen Da Jun was very troubled by the difficulty of communicating with this young man.

When Nanmen Da Jun left, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and checked the situation in Ice Heart Valley.

The results of the battle were no different from what he had expected. The Seeking Passion Sect had more than thirty Emperors completely wiped out; Xi Lei and Xie Wu Wei joined forces and killed more than ten thousand people as easily as crushing dry wood, and although there were still a large number of enemies, they were like a herd of sheep without a shepherd, losing all spirit to continue fighting.

After the arrival of the Elders of Ice Heart Valley, the battle was now a one-sided rout.

At this moment, Ice Heart Valley was already cleaning up loose ends, and everything would soon be over.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he flew towards the Ice Lake, killing any enemies he met along the way and leaving a long trail of corpses in his wake.

After a while, he appeared in the area that was originally the Ice Lake, the Restricted Area of Ice Heart Valley.

He looked around and then whistled softly.

In the hidden rockery on the side, two figures, one old and one young, came out looking around curiously. When they saw Yang Kai, they immediately greeted him with joy.

The pair who followed Yang Kai to Ice Heart Valley was none other than Old Ban and his granddaughter.

Weng weng weng…

A strange buzz filled the air, and immediately after these two figures emerged, a group of hundreds of black insects flew towards Yang Kai.

Soul Devouring Demon Insects!

Yang Kai took out the Insect Enslavement Bracelet and retrieved the Soul Devouring Demon Insects before turning to Old Ban and Xiao Ling’er with a smile and asking, “No one came by, right?”

Old Ban shook his head and replied, “No one, thanks to Young Master Yang’s careful arrangement.”

While talking, he glanced at the Insect Enslavement Bracelet in Yang Kai’s hand with some slight fear.

Although he did not know what those black insects were, each of them gave him a sense of horror. Old Ban also knew that since Yang Kai left the insects to guard him and his granddaughter, he was obviously confident in the capabilities of the insects.

With the protection of the Soul Devouring Demon Insects, Yang Kai did not need to worry about their safety at all. A few hundred insects could put up a fight against a First-Order Emperor Realm Master, not to mention that the Emperor Realm Masters of Seeking Passion Sect were already dead. Even if someone accidentally bumped into Old Ban and his granddaughter and tried to take advantage of them, the final outcome was only to be killed by the Soul Devouring Demon Insects.

“Young Master Yang, there’s a lot of fighting outside, don’t you need to help? Ling’er and I can just hide here, you don’t need to worry about us too much,” Old Ban glanced at Ice Heart Valley worriedly. Even though he had been hiding the whole time, he could still hear the commotion outside and the clamour of shouting and killing, obviously concluding that a great battle was being waged.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, assuring them, “No, the situation has basically been settled already.”

He squatted down next and patted Xiao Ling’er’s head with a smile, “Do you like this place? From now on, this will be your Sect.”

Xiao Ling’er blinked her big eyes and replied crisply, “I like it, but it’s a little cold.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “This is Ice Heart Valley, it’s only natural that it is cold. Don’t worry, you will gradually get used to it.”
