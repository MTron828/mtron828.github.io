“Do your parents know that you act so recklessly?” Yang Kai sat cross-legged in the same place, looking at Ye Jing Han coldly.

Ye Jing Han replied bitterly, “This Mistress has been an orphan since she was a child.”

Yang Kai was struck speechless and remained silent for a while before asking in a deep voice, “What did you see just now?”

“What?” Ye Jing Han asked with a blank face.

“Nothing,” Yang Kai exhaled softly. Ye Jing Han’s tone and expression seemed genuine, so she should have seen nothing just now.

“Grandmaster Yang...” Ye Jing Han stammered, “Can you give this Mistress a chance to say a few words?”

“Aren’t you already talking?” Yang Kai was now completely weakened at the moment, and although Ye Jing Han probably would not act disadvantageous to him, it was wise to always be on guard. He concealed his fatigue and quietly recuperated, restoring his strength while casually answering.

“Many thanks, Grandmaster Yang!” Ye Jing Han was overjoyed when she heard these words, feeling emotional that her sincerity and efforts had finally paid off. After considering her words carefully, she spoke seriously, “This Mistress is actually looking for Grandmaster Yang to ask a favour.”

Yang Kai closed his eyes and focused, ignoring her.

Ye Jing Han continued, “This Mistress hopes that Grandmaster Yang... eh? Grandmaster, be careful behind you!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What!?” Yang Kai was startled because at that moment he felt a sudden chill coming from behind, like a sharp blade that was cutting into his skin.

His face changed drastically! He was so focused on restoring his strength that he failed to notice danger approaching from behind him. If it had not been for Ye Jing Han’s warning, he probably would not have even noticed it.

Deep down, he felt extremely shocked and perplexed at who could have come this close to him without him noticing.

In haste, Yang Kai pushed his Source Qi madly and leapt into the air, turning around as he crossed his arms in front of his chest.

*Hong... *

A huge force struck him head-on at that moment.

*Gezhizhi...*

The sound of bones fracturing rang out.

Yang Kai was extremely shocked this time.

His physique was incredibly intrepid, to the point that even a simple blow from an Emperor Realm Master would not be able to crack his bones, but this inexplicable attack did just that.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai snarled abruptly and accompanied by a high-pitched dragon roar, Dragon Scales covered his arms, blocking the impact of the violent power.

“This power...” Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn as he suddenly noticed something odd about the force which attacked him. It did not seem to be Source Qi that he was familiar with, but another kind of unknown power.

He looked up immediately, releasing his Divine Sense, trying to search for the culprit who had the courage to attack him.

Yang Kai gasped when he finally saw it.

Not far from Yang Kai stood a dark silhouette, one without the slightest vitality, filled with so much violent energy that it was constantly fluctuating unstably.

In the darkness, two scarlet predatory eyes which could make anyone shudder stared at him.

Yang Kai’s face darkened and he asked in a low voice, “Who is Your Excellency!?”

There was no answer. The figure just tilted its head and looked at Yang Kai blankly before lifting its fist and swinging it towards him fiercely.

Although it was just a simple fist, the wind generated from this attack was like a storm of a thousand sharp blades, cutting through the air fiercely.

Having suffered a loss just now, Yang Kai was extremely vigilant, and with a flick of his ten fingers, he summoned a series of tiny Void Cracks that flew out like a rain of needles towards the incoming assault.

His opponent seemed to understand this attack was dangerous and withdrew from the battle, tilting its head as it stared at Yang Kai from a distance.

The black shadow did not have quick reflexes, and even seemed a bit stiff and jerky in its movements, almost like it had not moved about for a long time, but Yang Kai instinctively knew that this was a formidable enemy!

*Om...* a strange sound reverberated from the black shadow, and Yang Kai suddenly felt a hot sensation coming from his lower abdomen.

“What?” Yang Kai was perplexed and backed away with a tap of his foot.

He would not be flustered even if his opponent was a genuine Emperor Realm Master, but at this moment, he couldn’t help wanting to get as far away as possible from this dark shadow.

The reason was that the Ancient Demon Qi sealed in his lower abdomen was somehow aroused. Thankfully, the mysterious power of the gold and silver seal suppressed this Ancient Demon Qi firmly, otherwise, Yang Kai would definitely transform into a Demon again.

[This shadow... is it related to that Ancient Demon?] An unimaginable thought surfaced in Yang Kai’s mind and he suddenly paled.

Although the surging Demon Spirit in his lower abdomen was suppressed, it was clearly noticed by the black shadow. In a short time, the murderous thoughts of the black shadow spread out like a tide, unspeakable hostility permeating towards him, and even the dark energy becoming visible to the naked eye.

“Demon Qi!” Yang Kai exclaimed.

At this moment, he was absolutely sure that the black shadow before him was related to the Ancient Demon, because the energy fluctuations of the two were almost the same.

“Kill!” A single word came out of the black shadow’s throat before it shot towards Yang Kai, sending out a punch that seemed capable of collapsing the world.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened, flicking his wrist without hesitation, and summoned the Emperor Artifact Myriads Sword into his hands. With a great bellow, he flourished his sword, “Myriad Sword Arts, One Man As A Mountain!”

*Zheng...*

The wave of Sword Qi surged out and filled the air.

A thick and solid barrier formed from sharp Sword Qi appeared before Yang Kai, blocking the first strike, but the black shadow quickly sent another punch, causing Yang Kai’s body to tremble and almost shattered his sword barrier.

“Grandmaster Yang, this Mistress will assist you!” Ye Jing Han’s voice trembled slightly, revealing her inner panic and fear, but she still braced herself and flew over. Summoning a bracelet onto her delicate wrist as she channelled her Source Qi into it. Next, the bracelet enlarged into the size of a washbasin and whirled towards the black shadow.

“Don’t!” Yang Kai let out a loud shout.

Although Ye Jing Han’s cultivation was similar to his, she would have no chance to fight against this black shadow, and a single mistake here would result in her death.

He was too late though, because the bracelet artifact activated in the blink of an eye and struck towards the dark shadow’s head. The dark shadow did nothing to prevent it though, and simply let the attack hit.

*Dang...*

As if hitting a solid object with a loud clunk, the light on the bracelet flickered wildly and a trace of Demon Qi began to contaminate it, corrupting its spirituality.

*Pu...*

Ye Jing Han spurted a mouthful of blood, her aura instantly weakening.

The bracelet artifact was her Natal Artifact, cultivated together with her own life essence from when she was young. If this artifact was damaged, her physical body would also be affected. She immediately retrieved the bracelet with a wave of her hand as a deep fear gripped her.

Looking down at the bracelet, a black Qi intertwined around it, gradually spreading to its surroundings, corroding everything it touched.

Ye Jing Han was mortified as only now did she fathom the gap in strength between herself and the dark shadow.

“Kill!” The hoarse screeching voice which sounded like metal rubbing against metal sounded, making the two people present extremely uncomfortable.

Yang Kai composed himself as he lifted the Myriads Sword once again towards the black shadow. Staring at his opponent solemnly, he shouted in a low voice, “Who exactly is Your Excellency? What is your relationship to that One-Eyed Great Demon?”

“Kill!” The black shadow repeated the same word, ignoring his question.

“Are you underestimating me?” Yang Kai was furious and a golden gleam suddenly appeared in his left eye, activating his Demon Eye of Annihilation to spy on the black shadow.

He wanted to see exactly who this black shadow was.

The sight which greeted him, however, turned Yang Kai’s expression strange as he muttered in shock, “This... this is...”

Yang Kai could see through all illusions using his Demon Eye of Annihilation, so he was able to observe the true form of the black shadow.

He discovered that this black shadow, just like Liu Yan, was not a living thing at all, but a kind of existence similar to an Artifact Spirit assuming human form.

However, this dark shadow’s original form seemed to be a giant hammer.

The hammer was hidden and enclosed in the black shadow’s body and contained a boundless amount of Demon Qi. Exquisite runes flowed across the surface of this hammer like living creatures.

Yang Kai felt a sharp sting in his left eye, followed by a moist and hot sensation trickling down from its corner.

He forced himself to examine the shape of the hammer carefully, feeling a sense of familiarity the more he looked at it.

Then, he remembered.

He had indeed seen this hammer before, not in his life, but rather from when he scanned the memories of Young Lord Jiang Chu He of the Jiang Family.

When the Demon Qi flooded Maplewood City previously, Jiang Chu He had been transformed into a Demon when he was corroded by the Ancient Demon Qi. Yang Kai and Qin Yu had worked together to display a Secret Technique that allowed them to scan his memories at the time.

Among those memories was one of this hammer.

During a great ancient battle, the weapon used by the Ancient Demon was this War Hammer. Its power was all-conquering and countless ancient mighty warriors had died tragically under it.

“Demonic War Hammer!” Yang Kai yelled as he quickly dismissed his Demon Eye of Annihilation, not daring to look at it again.

If it really was the Ancient Demon’s War Hammer, it made sense for the Demon Spirit sealed in Yang Kai to resonate with the black shadow. There was an inseparable relationship between the two, and it was only natural for them to react to each other.

If that was the case, the mighty men in ancient times did not only seal the Black Eye of the Ancient Demon here, but also the Demonic War Hammer!

It was just that the Demonic War Hammer had been suppressed by the Eighteen Stars Grand Array and was only just now released!

Perhaps it was related to the Source Crystal lode that Yang Kai collected. The Source Crystal lode could have been the key to suppressing the Demonic War Hammer!

Although that was his deduction, Yang Kai did not feel any regret in collecting the Source Crystal lode.

Also, not like you have any regrets taking treasure away from the start. When has that been the case?
