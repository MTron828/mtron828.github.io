Xie Wu Wei’s defiant look immediately terrified his subordinates like frightened rats. They secretly thought, [Sir sure is hot-headed. Fortunately, there are no outsiders here, otherwise, if this reached the Divine Venerables’ ears, Sir might have to pay for it.]

“Blood Gate, what’s that?” Yang Kai, after listening for a while, finally couldn’t help but ask out of curiosity.

He had also heard Yang You Wei mention the Blood Gate before and knew that it was one of two Restricted Areas of the Ancient Wild Lands, just like Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb; however, he didn’t get into details that time. But now, seeing Xie Wu Wei’s expression and listening to his words, it was apparent that this Blood Gate was of great importance, so much so that even the four Divine Spirits of the Ancient Lands were interfering in matters related to it.

This was no small matter.

Yang Kai was now looking for Xiao Xiao in the Ancient Wild Lands, as well as the Third Disciple, so it wasn’t a bad idea to learn more about the situation here. As the saying goes, if you know your enemy and yourself, you can win a hundred battles.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Xie Wu Wei gawked, suddenly remembering that there were two outsiders present here. The corners of his lips momentarily twitched as he had been so excited that he had forgotten about this.

“If it’s inconvenient to speak about it, then forget it!” Yang Kai smiled lightly before picking up the dark red tea served by the maid beside him. But after smelling the scent, he didn’t dare to drink it, for the fear that it was really brewed from blood.

He might have casually spoken, but Xie Wu Wei didn’t dare to take it lightly; after all, Yang Kai was already interested and who knows what was going on in his mind. So, all Xie Wu Wei could do was go along with the flow and satiate Yang Kai’s curiosity, “Not at all. The Blood Gate is useless to Humans anyway. It’s one of the Restricted Areas in our Ancient Lands!”

Yang Kai asked, “I heard someone mention that the Blood Gate and the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb are designated as the two Restricted Areas of the Ancient Lands. I wonder if that’s true or false?”

Xie Wu Wei agreed with a nod, “That’s right. The Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb is the place where we, who were born in the Ancient Lands, go when we reach our predestined time of death, while the Blood Gate is the place where one can go to obtain a whole new life. One for life and one for death, they are the two sides of the same coin.”

“Where you can get a whole new life?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Xie Wu Wei quickly added, “According to ancient rumours, if one can pass through the Blood Gate, he or she would basically be reborn, regain their ancestral bloodline, and transform into a Divine Spirit.”

“Transform into a Divine Spirit!?” Yang Kai was shocked, “Does that mean that if you can enter the Blood Gate, you can become a Divine Spirit?”

Xie Wu Wei replied with a nod, “That is the literal meaning, but no one knows whether it is true or not. Since the Ancient Lands came into existence, the Blood Gate Restricted Area has also existed; however, no one we know of has ever been able to approach it, much less enter it. There are still ancient rumours passed down from generation to generation about it though. In the Ancient Lands, even the weakest Monster Race member who has just gained sentience will know about these rumours. It’s no secret that the residents of the Ancient Lands all have some bloodline connection to ancient Divine Spirits, some having a stronger inheritance while others were weaker, but in the end, quality is the key. One’s strength is related greatly to his or her aptitude as well as the purity of their bloodline. If one can fully awaken their bloodline, and reproduce the glory of their ancestors, then naturally they will have strength comparable to a Divine Spirit.”

Yang Kai was shocked, “There is such a place in this world? Does the Blood Gate really have such a miraculous effect?”

Xie Wu Wei replied, “Whether it has such a miraculous effect or not remains uncertain, but rumours have it that all Divine Spirits originated from the Blood Gate. Unfortunately, those rumours are all from aeons ago so there is no way to verify them. Regardless, the Blood Gate is a great fortune to the residents of the Ancient Lands. Just like the rumours of a fish transforming into a dragon after leaping over the dragon gate, the Blood Gate is tantamount to the dragon gate. Who wouldn’t want to give it a try?”

“Monster King, do you also want to go in?” A strange look appeared in Yang Kai’s eyes.

Xie Wu Wei stated with a sneer, “That would depend on if the Sirs would give us a chance. They have now sent their Great Kings to block the vicinity of the Blood Gate, so who can get close to it? But by doing so, they have just given themselves away. If one asks who knows the most about the secrets of the Blood Gate best, the answer would undoubtedly be the four Divine Venerables.”

Yang Kai nodded in agreement. Listening to Xie Wu Wei, he immediately understood the significance of the Blood Gate. If it could really simulate the Ancestral Bloodline of the residents of the Ancient Lands, it would surely increase their strength. The Blood Gate was undoubtedly a place of rebirth; it was the complete opposite of the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb, where the creatures at the end of their lifespan go to die.

[Nothing is too strange in this world…] Yang Kai sighed in his heart. If he had not entered the Ancient Wild Lands to search for Xiao Xiao this time, he wouldn’t have been able to imagine that there was such a mystical place in this world.

“The Divine Venerables have been consolidating their power for a long time, and since the eight Great Kings have been dispatched, no one would dare to do anything strange for the time being; however, no one can suppress the temptation of their ancestral bloodline. I’m afraid this move will only be counterproductive. “Pass my order to closely monitor the situation of the Blood Gate, and if there are any changes, immediately report to me. I don’t believe those thirty or so old fogies will obediently remain still,” said Xie Wu Wei, waving his hand.

“Yes Sir!” The thin Monster Race member immediately retreated after having received the order.

Xie Wu Wei, standing on the platform, pondered with an uncertain look on his face for a while before he finally raised his head and asked, looking at Yang Kai, “Young Master Yang, you said that you want this King’s help for something, what is it?”

“To find someone,” Yang Kai slightly smiled.

“Find someone?” Xie Wu Wei asked in astonishment.

“It’s the crazy woman you saw before,” While speaking, Yang Kai stretched his hand a bit as ripples appeared, displaying the Third Disciple’s appearance, causing Xie Wu Wei to gawk and his face to turn black.

He could still vividly remember the scene when he was hit by the Third Disciple with a Monster Core in the Ten Thousand Spirits Tomb.

“I have some connection with this woman. She has lost her sanity and it’s dangerous for her to remain in the Ancient Lands. Therefore, I need to find her and take her away.”

[This isn’t that difficult!] Xie Wu Wei finally put his heart at ease. He was worried that Yang Kai would ask him to do something difficult after taking his Soul Brand, but now, it seemed that he was just looking for someone, which was a trivial matter.

He cast his gaze on a man with a deer head and rat eyes, and said, “Shu Yu, let the men pay more attention to this woman’s tracks. Immediately report to me if you find something. Also, don’t let anyone hurt her.”

The Monster Race member with the deer head known as Shu Yu immediately obeyed, cupping his fists, “Yes, Sir.”

He then turned around and left the hall.

Xue Wu Wei then turned his head and stated, looking at Yang Kai, “If this woman is still in the Ancient Lands, as long as she shows up, she will definitely be spotted by this King’s subordinates. Young Master Yang, you just have to calmly wait for the news.”

Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction, “Sorry to trouble you, Monster King.”

Xie Wu Wei’s brow twitched before he spoke words contrary to his convictions, “Young Master Yang’s business is this King’s business, you need not be so polite. Come, lead Young Master Yang and arrange a place for him to take a rest.”

He couldn’t wait to send Yang Kai away; after all, he was still feeling uncomfortable with him around and was afraid that his men would find some clues from his words and expressions.

“That can wait,” Yang Kai raised his hand and interrupted him, “I still want to ask Monster King to inquire about another matter.”

Xie Wu Wei slightly furrowed his brow, looking at Yang Ka unhappily. Yang Kai ignored him and lifted his hand, about to show him Xiao Xiao’s image before a deafening clap from below interrupted them. Immediately after, the mountain and the ground started quaking, causing the entire palace to shake left and right. The maids immediately screamed in panic and even the faces of the four Monster Race Masters in the hall changed.

“Hou…” A muffled roar suddenly came from deep underground, as if there was a beast trapped for a thousand years down there. The roar was extremely stifled, but everyone could clearly feel the anger of the voice’s owner.

Yang Kai couldn’t remain indifferent and curiously looked at Xie Wu Wei. He had no idea what was going on here, or what kind of monster was suppressed under the mountain.

Xie Wu Wei’s face immediately turned ugly as he looked down at the Monster Race Masters standing before him and shouted, “Has that big guy still not surrendered?”

One of the Monster Race members replied with an ugly look, “That thing is a bit stubborn. We used all kinds of methods but we can’t make it submit.”

“A group of wastes!” Xie Wu Wei coldly snorted, causing the Monster Race Masters to all lower their heads.

“This King will go and see in person.” Who knows why Xie Wu Wei suppressed a monster under the mountain, but with a flick of his sleeve, he did just as he said and went to check the situation personally. However, after just a few steps, he turned around and stated, “Sorry about that, Young Master Yang, something has come up, so this King needs to personally deal with it. This King’s maid will take you to rest. This King will later come to apologize to you for this.”

“There is no harm. I’ll also join in the fun.” Yang Kai slightly smiled.

Xie Wu Wei rolled his eyes, but he knew it would be pointless to try to stop Yang Kai, so all he could do was quietly walk forward.

The remaining four Monster Race Masters hurriedly followed after him, grumbling in their hearts. They felt that Sir Monster King was way too polite to this Human, even allowing him to participate in such a confidential matter.

After leaving the main hall, the group came to a cave where they walked in, one after another, in a file.

The cave seemed to be the only entrance and had stairs leading downwards; who knows where it led to. There were luminous stones on the cave walls on either side, providing illumination so the cave wasn’t that dim.

Xie Wu Wei and the others descended the stairs in large strides.

After a few thousand meters descent, the cave suddenly widened up as a spacious underground cavern appeared below. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

There were a lot of Monster Race members gathered in this underground palace, but at this moment, these Monster Race members were acting as if they were facing a powerful enemy. Many Monster Race members were even in their true forms, looking in a certain direction warily.

Seeing Xie Wu Wei and his men arrive, these Monster Race members retreated to either side, one after another, looking at him and his men with respect and fear.

Xie Wu Wei scanned them before he called a Monster Race member and shouted, “What’s going on?”

The Monster Race member immediately turned around and stammeringly replied, “We don’t know, it suddenly woke up and flew into a rage. We couldn’t suppress it with our low strength and a few of our Brothers and Sisters have already died. If Sir hadn’t personally locked him with that chain, I’m afraid it would have already broken free.”

“Scram, you lot are useless to this King!” Xie Wu Wei flicked his sleeve with a displeased look on his face, throwing the Monster Race member to one side then walking straight to the depths of the underground palace.

*Hou…*

Another roar came, giving rise to a powerful gust of wind that swept across the underground palace. Everyone’s clothes and hair flapped along with this gust.

A look of surprise appeared on Yang Kai’s face though as he had no idea who or what powerful being was suppressed in this underground palace.

Curious, he focused his gaze, looking inside.

But what entered his vision next left Yang Kai dumbfounded. He stood rooted on the spot as if he was struck by lightning, mumbling in a trembling voice, “Xiao Xiao…”

About several dozen metres away, a huge, fifteen-meter-tall Humanoid creature was shackled by heavy black chains. This enormous figure’s entire body was sharp and angular, and at a glance, it looked to be carved from stone. It had an ore-like lustre, but it also had distinct facial features and four robust limbs. It was giving off a sense of immense power.

The big guy before him clearly looked like what Xiao Xiao would look like after he assumed his stone giant form.
