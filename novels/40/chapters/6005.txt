Chapter 6004: Chanting

Gong Lian, who was still called brat by Ou Yang Lie, had already reached the Ninth Order. Basically, his cultivation was the same as Ou Yang Lie’s, but as there was still a Master and Disciple relationship between them. Even if he was a Ninth-Order Master, he could not go against Ou Yang Lie. So, he could not help but nod his confirmation after hearing this, “Honoured Master is telling the truth!”

Ou Yang Lie’s laughter became even more carefree.

A few of the newly advanced Ninth-Order Masters also started laughing, all of them knowing how Ou Yang Lie loved to brag and deciding to just go along with it.

All of them had witnessed or experienced the might of a Pseudo-Royal Lord first-hand, and it was definitely not something an Eighth-Order Master could contend with, unless they formed a Battle Formation.

Be that as it may, back when there weren’t many Eighth-Order Masters, Ou Yang Lie had indeed fought a Pseudo-Royal Lord alone, and it was him who was beaten to the point that he had wet his pants. Even so, fighting a Pseudo-Royal Lord alone was still an incredible feat in itself.

At that moment, the noisy hall suddenly fell silent, everyone stopped blowing their own trumpet and raised their eyes, looking directly above.

In that direction was a calm and composed, half-white-haired Ninth-Order Master with a smile on his lips. He swept his gaze over everyone before addressing them, “Ladies and gentlemen, it’s been 1,000 years since we last met, but it seems everyone’s noble bearing is still the same. Hmm, there are also a few new faces, very good.”

Everyone greeted with a bow, “Greetings, Supreme Commander Mi.”

The person who had arrived was none other than Mi Jing Lun. Although the Human Race’s Crusade Force and the various Armies had been disbanded, Mi Jing Lun’s title of Supreme Commander had remained. In terms of cultivation, Mi Jing Lun might not be the strongest Ninth-Order Master, but in every battle against the Black Ink Clan, he had played a far greater role than any other Ninth-Order Master. There was no battle in which he had not wracked his brain hard to map out a strategy for victory, and it was he who had ultimately coordinated and dispatched the various troops.

He was a cultivator of the same era as Ou Yang Lie, Xiang Shan, and Wei Jun Yang, but if they were to stand together, Mi Jing Lun would definitely look older because he had been under even greater stress and for a longer duration during the thousands of years of war.

Above the main hall, Mi Jing Lun returned the greeting before continuing, “It’s the day of the Void Festival. Counting the time, this is already the eighth celebration, and I’m sure everyone knows what this means.”

Hearing this, everyone’s expressions became solemn.

“For a long time, there have been gaps in our memories. There appears to be traces of a person’s existence in many key memories, but whether it’s us or others, none of us can remember this person. I don’t know what kind of mood I was in when I oversaw the compilation of this person’s biography, but now that I think about it, it was definitely the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. All the signs indicate that this person should’ve really existed, and that all the accounts in this person’s biography should indeed be true. This person is the greatest contributor to the Human Race’s victory over the Black Ink Clan!”

Unlike the cultivators with low cultivation, although the Ninth-Order Masters present here had some gaps in their memories, these missing memories could be perfectly filled in by Yang Kai’s biography; therefore, they could conclude that Yang Kai really did exist and the records in his biography were not fabricated.

The reason they had forgotten about Yang Kai was because of the mysteries of the Shadow Secret Technique.

“A Hero cannot be allowed to be forgotten; otherwise, the current Human Race does not deserve to live. 8,000 years have already passed, and it is time for him to return. The Void Ceremony has been conducted precisely for this moment. Everyone, the arrangements we had laid back then should be used, it’s time to witness the truth!”

The world only knew that the Void Festival’s ceremony was a grand event for the entire Human Race, but didn’t know that it was a hidden hand Mi Jing Lun and the other Ninth-Order Masters had arranged long ago.

When they had set up this contingency back then, perhaps they had still not completely forgotten about Yang Kai; but now, they really could not remember anything about him. It didn’t matter if they didn’t remember though, as long as the plan worked.

“Please instruct us, Supreme Commander Mi!” The Ninth-Order Masters cupped their fists.

Mi Jing Lun lightly smiled, “Then let us see if all of this is just an unrealistic conjecture on our part or if we really have forgotten something!”

One after another, the Ninth-Order Masters received their orders and flew out of the hall, quickly disappearing, leaving only one Ninth-Order Master behind.

This was a Titled Great Emperor recognized by the Star Boundary and the only surviving Great Emperor who had managed to break through to the Ninth Order. There had been other Ninth-Order Great Emperors from the Star Boundary, but they had all fallen during the crusade.

The hall sunk into complete silence as Mi Jing Lun and the Great Emperor patiently waited.

10 days later, Mi Jing Lun finally opened his eyes and glanced at the Ninth-Order Great Emperor, “It’s about time.”

The Ninth-Order Great Emperor slightly nodded before slowly closing his eyes and spreading his Divine Sense; the next instant, he had become one with the entire Star Boundary.

Right then, in every settlement across the Universe World, Yang Kai’s statues, which had stood tall for 8,000 years, suddenly started glowing, attracting the attention of countless people.

Soon after, a voice started to reverberate from the statue, chanting something. What the voice was reciting was the contents of Yang Kai’s biography.

The voice seemed to contain some kind of mysterious power, causing everyone who heard it to involuntarily stop in their tracks and quietly listen. As the chanting continued, an enormous picture scroll seemed to have filled everyone’s vision. The picture scroll was impressively portraying the life of a cultivator named Yang Kai and how he gradually grew to become the strongest, eventually leading the Human Race to defeat their enemies.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Not just in the Star Boundary, even in Myriad Monsters Territory, on every Universe World where the Humans lived, the set up in the statues was activated by the Ninth-Order Masters.

At this moment, that chanting was simultaneously ringing in the ears of trillions of Humans.

Once, twice, three times…

Gradually, people began to read along the voice coming from the statue. Almost everyone had read Yang Kai’s biography, and many scholars had even memorized it by heart. Only, the biography which in the past was only read to pass time was given heavy importance today.

Trillions of Humans were chanting the Void Great Emperor’s real name.

At the same time, in the distant void, on the battlefield where the final battle between Yang Kai and Mo was fought, a few people were gathered together inside a floating palace.

There weren’t many people, only a dozen or so, but apart from a middle-aged couple, the lowest cultivation of the others was the Eighth-Order, and there were actually quite a number of Ninth-Order Masters present.

Everyone gathered here was Yang Kai’s close relative.

His parents, his Wives, his Disciples, Yang Xiao, Yang Xue…

These people had been waiting here for 8,000 years. Xia Ning Chang had originally stayed behind to guard High Heaven Palace because, despite her high cultivation, she had very little experience in fighting; moreover, she was an Alchemy Great Grandmaster and was more useful stationed in the rear. However, for the final crusade, even she was roped in. 

After their triumphant return, once Xia Ning Chang had helped compile Yang Kai’s biography with Mi Jing Lun, she immediately returned here. 

Naturally, Mi Jing Lun immediately set out to fetch all those close to Yang Kai, bringing Yang Ying Feng and Dong Su Zhu here to meet up with Su Yan and the others to wait for Yang Kai’s return.

Their wait had now lasted for 8,000 years!
