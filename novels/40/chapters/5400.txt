“The Divine Spirits were the first to rule the Universe. They were born powerful, and had almost no natural enemies except themselves. They were Kings in those days and the vast world bowed at their feet.”

Cang began to orate and the Ninth-Order Masters listened carefully.

Although they were all top Masters who lived for many tens of thousands of years and stood at the pinnacle of the Human Race, they were considered Juniors when compared to Cang.

They knew this, so as soon as they found out about Cang, they treated him as their honourable Senior.

The Old Ancestors never knew these secrets of the Primordial Era and Early Ancient Era. No one had ever told them these while the ancient books did not have much in terms of details.

Everyone realized that today they would be learning from Cang things that they never knew before.

“The Divine Spirits were proud and undefeatable, but they had innate arrogance that they needed to prove to others. So, the Divine Spirits fought amongst themselves, and all Divine Spirits were enemies to all but their own.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Such a war soon swept across the 3,000 Worlds. As the battle raged on, it shattered the Heavens and Earth. Countless living beings perished while even the Divine Spirits themselves were not spared as many were killed. The battle of the Divine Spirits of the Primordial Era was almost a battle of complete extinction.”

“It was not until millions of years later when most of the Divine Spirits were exterminated and those that survived could barely sustain their Clans that the era of the Divine Spirits dominating all lives came to an end!”

“That also marked the beginning of the Early Ancient Era!”

“When the Divine Spirits fought, they created many servants and descendants. As the Divine Spirits declined, these servants and descendants, who were all essentially soldiers themselves, grew stronger. Their strength may not have been on par with the Divine Spirits, but they reproduced much faster than their predecessors, and if they grew to the very limits of their strength, they may not be worse off compared to the Divine Spirits themselves.”

“Those servants and descendants were the Monster Race! The Early Ancient Era was a period where the Monster Race ruled the Universe. All kinds of powerful Monster Beasts emerged, and in terms of pure numbers or species, they were far more numerous than the Divine Spirits.”

“While the Divine Spirits became dormant, the Monster Race were the Masters of the World. They also attacked and killed each other, along with those of other races as well.”

As Cang spoke, the grand images of the Primordial Era and Early Ancient Era gradually formed in the minds of the Old Ancestors.

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were in awe as they listened while Yang Kai stood still, stopped pouring wine, and listened carefully to Cang’s narration.

No one would have thought that the Primordial Era and Early Ancient Era would be such periods where Divine Spirits and the Monster Race dominated the World.

“Senior, what about Humans? When was the Human Race born, and who created it?” An Old Ancestor asked.

The Monster Race was created by the Divine Spirits, but what about the Human Race? Everyone was curious who created the Humans.

“The Human Race…” Cang smiled and then replied, “The Human Race was not created by anyone. When the Heavens and Earth were created, the Human Race was born. The Human Race has existed throughout all the ages, even when the Divine Spirits ruled the Primordial Era and the Monster Race ruled the Early Ancient Era. During both Eras, there were traces of Human activity. At that time, the Human Race was separated into many small tribes. The Humans were born weak. The Divine Spirits were born with great power, and the Monster Beasts were born with strong bodies, so what about the Human Race? Human infants and children only knew how to cry and would perish without protection from others. The Human Race was slaughtered during those times of chaos.”

“That was until the dawning of the Late Ancient Era,” Cang said solemnly, “A great power felt that the Human Race had to grow stronger in order to survive the various hardships it had to endure, and 10 people were selected by that great power to travel the Universe and teach other Humans to cultivate and slowly become stronger. As time passed, the Humans became capable of competing with the Monster Race. Although Humans were born weak, they had an advantage compared to the Divine Spirits and the Monster Race, the ability to reproduce rapidly. This meant that their population grew at a pace that was orders of magnitude greater than others, allowing the Race as a whole to quickly become strong. The Human Race grew and grew until by the end of the Late Ancient Era, they were strong enough to rule this vast Universe. At that time, Humans flourished in every Great Territory and every World.”

“A great power…” An Old Ancestor asked seriously, “Senior mentioned about a great power. What is it?”

Cang leisurely mused, “Perhaps the Heavenly Way?”

He did not answer directly and the crowd was not sure if he did not want to say or really did not know.

The Old Ancestor who asked did not pursue the question while another asked, “The 10 who were entrusted to teach the other Humans. Senior… are you one of the 10?”

The reason why there was such a question was because Cang had lived for so long. To know what went on during the Primordial Era, Early Ancient Era, and Late Ancient Era, the only way was to have personally experienced those times.

Furthermore, when Cang spoke about the restriction, he said that the restrictions were set up by him and his nine other friends.

That was exactly 10 people!

Cang smiled faintly and said, “Sort of.”

The Ninth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were in awe. They were originally sitting in the void, but now they all rose up and bowed to Cang in deep respect.

An Old Ancestor held up his jar of wine and roared, “To Martial Ancestor!”

Martial Ancestor!

If the 10 of them did not go around teaching the Human Race how to cultivate, it would be unimaginable what state the Humans would still be in today. As one of the 10 who originally taught the Human Race about the existence of the Martial Dao, Cang deserved the title of Martial Ancestor.

“To Martial Ancestor!” All the Old Ancestors proclaimed with utmost respect.

The crowd shouted in unison, tilting their heads and drinking the wine in the cups.

Cang reached out and cupped his fist humbly, “Back then, when I taught with my nine old friends, I was only abiding by the Will of the Heavens. It was the only way the Human Race could continue to survive, so I do not deserve the title of Martial Ancestor.”

Yang Kai diligently poured wine for him and chuckled, “The people in front of you are the top Masters of the Human Race. When they say that you are the Martial Ancestor, then you are our Martial Ancestor. If not for you and the other nine Martial Ancestors, the Human Race would not be here today.”

A true Martial Ancestor! Yang Kai never dreamed he would one day meet such a mythical figure, one of the founders who taught the Human Race about the great Martial Dao.

Although this was only a one-sided revelation from Cang, no one doubted it.

Who could have known so much if they had not experienced the events themselves?

“What about Mo? When did it appear?” An Old Ancestor asked.

Regardless of what happened during the Primordial Era, Early Ancient Era, and Late Ancient Era, the only thing that everyone was now more concerned with was Mo. Only when it was resolved, would this crusade of the Human Race be considered a success. It would only be then that there would be no more conflicts to resolve.

“Mo…” Cang sighed, “In the beginning of the Universe, when the First Primordial Light came into existence, darkness was also born. That darkness was Mo. Its existence is even older than that of the Divine Spirits!”

The Ninth-Order Masters gasped.

As Cang mentioned, the Divine Spirits ruled the Primordial Era and the Monster Race ruled the Early Ancient Era, making them sound like they were the first beings to exist. Who would have expected that Mo was even older than them?

“Since Black Ink Strength was so invasive, why didn’t Mo rise up to dominate everything during the Primordial Era and the Early Ancient Era, when the Divine Spirits and the Monster Race were ruling?”

If Mo rose up during that time, neither the Divine Spirits nor the Monster Race would have had a chance to rule over the Universe. No matter if it was in the Primordial Era or Early Ancient Era, it would have been the Black Ink Clan that ruled the World.

Cang shook his head and explained, “Although it existed since the beginning of the Universe, its sentience formed much later. It lay dormant during the Primordial Era and Early Ancient Era, and even during the Late Ancient Era, before the Human Race became dominant, it still remained unaware. It was not until a long time later that it became sentient and began to leave this place on its own accord.”

“This place?” The Ninth-Order Masters paid close attention to Cang’s choice of words, “Senior, does it mean that it was born here as well?”

Cang nodded and said, “This is where the Heavens and Earth began, and it is also the birthplace of Mo. It can also be considered the end point of the Universe. That is why we laid the restrictions here, deceived it here, and sealed it.”

“Deceived…” the Old Ancestors murmured to each other.

Cang said solemnly, “In fact… its sentience is not too developed, at least, before it was imprisoned. In fact, Mo’s sentience was only equivalent to that of a child. It was a little naughty, but it was not bad in nature. Unfortunately, its existence itself is evil.”

The Old Ancestors were surprised to hear his comment.

On the other hand, Yang Kai was suddenly reminded of Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, whom he met in the Chaotic Dead Territory. Both of them were also extremely powerful, but their personalities were just like that of children.

The Old Ancestors may not be able to understand Cang’s comment on Mo, but since Yang Kai could associate what he said with his experience with Big Brother Huang and Big Sister Lan, he could understand the situation better.

Upon that realization, Yang Kai suddenly wondered, [Perhaps, in this World, once their strength reaches beyond a certain level, their sentience becomes limited?]

“The Late Ancient Era ended as Mo’s sentience began to take form, slowly assuming a form that then left this place. At that time, the Human Race had already dominated the 3,000 Worlds, so you can imagine what it would be like for a child who suddenly arrived in an extremely prosperous World. Someone who grew up in deathly silence, was always alone, and had never had any companions.”

The Old Ancestors fell silent, leaving Yang Kai to respond, “It must have been very happy and wanted to be part of it.”

“En,” Cang nodded, “Mo did not intend to harm anyone, it just wanted to immerse itself and enjoy its prosperity, to get to know others and feel the bustling world around it. However, it did not know that its power was too overbearing for the mundane world. Thus, everywhere Mo went, all the people were corrupted. Everyone honoured it, saw it with reverence, and fulfilled all of its demands.”

“Everywhere that was occupied by Mo became tainted in its colour. Every Great Territory was corrupted by Mo and its power grew rapidly. Everywhere Mo went became its territory! World Force was its favourite food, and the noisy cities became its favourite places.”

“In less than a few hundred years, hundreds of Great Territories fell, all the World Force was consumed, and the lands naturally died. The people living in these dead lands became corrupted by Black Ink Strength.”

“This Old Master and my nine old friends came to investigate immediately after we became aware of the news, and learned about the strangeness of Black Ink Strength. We knew that if we could not solve this problem, the 3,000 Worlds would one day be completely consumed by Mo, and by that time, there would be no one else in this World!”
