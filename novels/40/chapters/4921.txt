For that reason, it was impossible for Nu Yan to accept Lang Ya’s invitation for a third round. Not unless there was something wrong with his head.

Coldly snorting in response, Nu Yan turned to leave. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I will continue to use this servant. You can send any of your men into battle. What do you think?” Lang Ya’s voice came from behind.

Nu Yan froze and turned back to look at Lang Ya with a puzzled expression as if asking, “Are you speaking the truth?”

Lang Ya shrugged slightly, indicating that he was not joking.

There were countless eyes on them, watching curiously as though enjoying a good show.

Nu Yan immediately scowled upon hearing those words. Needless to say, there was nothing stopping him from leaving this place at this moment. Although he suffered a huge loss, it wasn’t like he hadn’t gained anything. The World Force of Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master was still useful to him, and picking E-5 up along the way here had made up for the losses he sustained this time; however, if he left just like this, he would never be able to swallow the resentment in his heart.

Lowering his head, Nu Yan looked into the crater. A-1 might have been defeated and killed by the Bright King Cave Heaven cultivator, but he had not been completely powerless to fight back. His desperate resistance had also caused some injury to his opponent. In addition, the battle just now had consumed quite a lot of the Bright King Cave Heaven cultivator’s strength.

[A one-on-one fight might have been impossible against him, but won’t a series of continuous battles bring him down?]

It had to be said that the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master below was a huge temptation to Nu Yan. The most important reason was that the resentment in his heart could be wiped clean in one go if he won.

Seeing Nu Yan’s hesitation, Lang Ya immediately waved his hand dismissively and said, “Of course, you can leave if you’re scared. There’s no need to force yourself.”

He had said those words before. His statement had been a provocation earlier, and it remained a provocation now. It was just that his tone was completely different. He had spat out those words through gritted teeth earlier, but he was openly sneering now.

Nu Yan had already been hesitating earlier, so he immediately made up his mind after being agitated by those words, “Who’s scared? But, let’s make it clear now. You don’t get to regret your decision when you lose later.”

Lang Ya nodded repeatedly, “Don’t worry, I won’t regret my decision.”

His expression was calm and relaxed, seeming to have great confidence in the Black Ink Disciple under his command.

Looking at Lang Ya’s reaction made Nu Yan’s heart clench. He had the vague feeling that he had made a fool of himself again; unfortunately, he had already agreed to the challenge and could no longer back out of his decision. If he refused the challenge now, he would only become the laughingstock of his clansmen.

Gritting his teeth, Nu Yan gave B-2 a questioning look. A-1 was dead, so he could only count on B-2 now. There was no denying that B-2 was slightly weaker than A-1, but the difference was not too great. Against an injured and exhausted opponent, his odds of obtaining victory were quite high.

Under Nu Yan’s gaze, B-2 lowered his head and said nothing.

“Waste!” Nu Yan snarled.

B-2’s behaviour obviously indicated that he had no confidence in winning. Things were bound to end badly if he were sent to fight with such a mentality. Besides, he had diligently served Nu Yan for a long time. Even if he was a mere servant, B-2 had been very earnest and supportive throughout all these years.

Nu Yan was reluctant to send B-2 to certain death despite his angry cursing, so he turned to Yang Kai and snapped, “You go!”

Having only just picked E-5 up, he did not know what his strength was like. Be that as it may, the Open Heaven Realm Masters were all the same. Seeing that B-2 had no confidence of winning, then the situation was most likely hopeless for E-5 too.

At this point, Nu Yan already regretted not leaving immediately earlier. If he had left, even if he suffered some losses, they wouldn’t have been too unbearable. In contrast, the situation had worsened now. Even the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Black Ink Disciple he just picked up would have to die here.

Be that as it may, if he had to choose between B-2 and E-5, Nu Yan would choose to abandon E-5. He was not familiar with the new recruit, so he could simply act as if he had not picked anybody up in the first place. By thinking like that, he could comfort himself slightly.

“Yes!” Yang Kai froze for a moment before he cupped his fist in response. He never imagined that this matter would fall upon his shoulders. Although he felt helpless, the Black Ink Clansman who was supposed to be his ‘Master’ had spoken, so he could only obey.

Nu Yan spoke through gritted teeth, “Even if you die, you have to drag him down with you!”

Yang Kai nodded and jumped into the crater.

Standing beside Nu Yan, D-4 sighed slightly. If it had to be said, he quite liked E-5. The main reason was that A-1 and the others were taciturn while E-5 was willing to chat with him despite being a newcomer. Now that E-5 had been ordered to enter the gambling arena, he would most likely never return again. The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Bright King Cave Heaven was not an easy opponent after all. That was why D-4 couldn’t help feeling a little regretful.

Inside the crater, a bloody stench filled the air. Severed limbs and pieces of flesh could be seen everywhere. An innumerable number of Black Ink Disciples had died in this place, so much so that the blood they spilled had dyed the ground crimson.

The Sixth-Order Master from Bright King Cave Heaven looked over indifferently. His expression was calm. There were signs of injury on his body, but they were not serious. It was just that his battle against A-1 earlier had indeed consumed a lot of his strength. Regardless of his condition though, he was confident that he could defeat his opponent in this kind of venue.

“Please!” Yang Kai cupped his fist at the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Bright King Cave Heaven.

The words had only just left Yang Kai’s mouth when the opponent shot towards him like an arrow released from its string. His World Force was wrapped around his figure for defence, but his momentum was very aggressive. Since he had already revealed his hand during the first round, there was no longer any need to hide his abilities. Besides, he planned to finish this fight as soon as possible. It was only natural for him to seize the advantage by closing the distance.

In the next moment, the Bright King Cave Heaven Master was slightly taken aback because his opponent was also rushing forward like him. There were no signs of activating a Secret Technique or traces of summoning an artifact, just a punch clad in World Force crashing down on him.

There was an uproar in the audience as countless Black Ink Clansmen and Black Ink Disciples widened their eyes in shock and amazement.

Although Nu Yan was also shocked, he was even more furious! [That damn E-5! Knowing that the opponent comes from Bright King Cave Heaven and boasts a strong physical body, I can’t believe he dared to take the initiative to meet him head on! That’s exactly how A-1 was killed earlier!]

However, recalling his own words just now, he suppressed the flames of his anger. He had the vague feeling that E-5 was following his orders and trying to create an opportunity to drag his opponent down with him. If that was the case, then his current actions were understandable.

*Hong…*

A loud explosion boomed across the arena, and shockwaves visible to the naked eye erupted outward. Two figures collided fiercely against each other, then suddenly separated as they flew out in opposite directions.

The first collision went beyond everybody’s expectations.

In the previous battle, the Sixth-Order Master from Bright King Cave Heaven had already displayed the immense strength of his body. Seeing Yang Kai dashing forward without the fear of death, they all believed that it would be a one-sided massacre, but on the contrary, it turned out to be an evenly matched situation.

Nu Yan was stunned! Even Lang Ya, who had a smile at the corner of his lips, was also stunned. Meanwhile, D-4’s mouth gaped open in shock.

Nobody could have expected Yang Kai to withstand the punch of the Sixth-Order Master from Bright King Cave Heaven. Nevertheless, one clash was not enough to prove anything, only the upcoming battle would determine the victor.

Two figures landed on the ground heavily.

The Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master from Bright King Cave Heaven had a surprised look in his eyes, but his figure kept charging forward without stopping. Putting some strength into his legs, he kicked off the ground so hard that an indentation formed. At the same time, he charged towards Yang Kai once more. When he was in mid-air, he saw his opponent making the same choice again!

*Hong… Hong… Hong…*

The two figures inside the crater constantly collided and separated. The cycle repeated again and again without the slightest pause. With every collision, the violent World Force kicked up the wind and the clouds. Like throwing a rock into the calm surface of the lake, shockwaves blasted out like ripples spreading into the surroundings.

The silent audience gathered around the crater immediately burst into cheer. This fierce battle enraptured and excited the Black Ink Clan.

There were no fancy Secret Techniques or exchanges between offensive and defensive artifacts, there were only bloody fists against flesh. It was the most primitive kind of conflict, a battle that had never been seen before in the gambling arena. It was enough to bring out the deep-seated murderous brutality buried deep within their hearts and intoxicated them greatly.

The smile on Lang Ya’s face gradually vanished, and his expression became solemn.

Meanwhile, Nu Yan’s expression was filled with surprise. He originally made the choice between abandoning B-2 or E-5, sending the unknown E-5 into battle. Who could have known that E-5 would give him such a pleasant surprise?

Despite facing a direct confrontation with a cultivator from Bright King Cave Heaven, E-5 did not lose out in the slightest. Leaving aside the final outcome of the battle, just this scene alone had already broken his previous assumptions.

“Is he also from Bright King Cave Heaven?” Nu Yan turned to look at D-4.

Along the journey, D-4 and E-5 had gotten together and whispered to each other from time to time. It was not that he did not notice, but rather that he did not have to worry about the loyalty of the Black Ink Disciples under him, so he rarely bothered to care about their private lives. Nu Yan had not asked about E-5’s background and had even given him a name in a haphazard manner.

However, D-4 should know something.

Upon hearing the question, D-4 shook his head, “No. He claimed to be from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

The Black Ink Clan had a certain understanding of the various Cave Heavens and Paradises, so needless to say, even Nu Yan had heard of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven. As a result, he immediately became puzzled, “Do the people from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven have such powerful bodies?”

D-4 shook his head and said, “Those from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven are proficient in the Yin-Yang Union Cultivation. They are not known for the strength of their bodies. E-5… may just be innately gifted!”

That was the only explanation. It was not to say that others would not have strong bodies if they did not come from Bright King Cave Heaven. It was only a general comparison. The cultivators from Bright King Cave Heaven mainly focused on Body Tempering, so their Secret Arts were also based on enhancing their physiques.

“Who do you think is better between them?” Nu Yan asked with great interest. Although he was a High-Rank Black Ink Clansman with strength equivalent to a Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, he was not very familiar with the way Humans fought. He could only see that the battle was extremely intense, but he could not see who held the upper hand.

D-4 could not really say because he himself could not tell; thus, he could only speak conservatively, “E-5 has hope of winning!”

That was enough.

Nu Yan laughed heartily, “Good! Very good!”

[I’ve truly found a treasure! It’s a blessing that I sent him out to participate in this battle. I would never have known that E-5 was so amazing otherwise.]

At the same time, he began to worry about E-5’s safety. It would be good if E-5 won the battle, but if E-5 was defeated and killed, the loss would break his heart even more than the death of A-1.

Nu Yan turned his head to the side, and seeing that Lang Ya’s expression was solemn and no longer as calm and relaxed as before, he sneered, “D-4, what do the Humans say about such situations?”

Observing the situation, D-4 quickly said, “All your clever scheming has led to your downfall! There’s also a saying, ‘Tried to steal a chicken, only to lose the rice’!”

“Right! Right!” Nu Yan nodded repeatedly, “That’s how it goes.”

Lang Ya glanced sideways and coldly spat, “The Black Ink Disciple under your command is too presumptuous.”

Nu Yan snorted with laughter, “As you know, he is a Black Ink Disciple under my command. He is none of your damn business! Weren’t you laughing so happily earlier? Why don’t you show me a smile now?”

How could Lang Ya smile at this time when he was pale with rage?
