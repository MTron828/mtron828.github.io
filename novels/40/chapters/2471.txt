Earth Sword Falling Thunder was a Secret Technique that was used by someone Yang Kai knew.

This Secret Technique was one of a set of three, Mortal Sword Swirling Destruction, Earth Sword Falling Thunder and Heaven Sword Shattering Star, each skill stronger than the previous, and the combination of three skills was even more powerful.

The one who cultivated this Secret Technique was Xiao Bai Yi of Azure Sun Temple. Previously, in the Flowing Time Temple of Four Seasons Realm, Yang Kai fought with Xiao Bai Yi and learned first hand of the profoundness of this Secret Technique, so it was still quite fresh in his mind.

At this moment, seeing someone in the Source Sea performing this Secret Technique immediately grabbed Yang Kai’s attention.

When he turned his head to look, he saw a figure in a chaotic battlefield, his white clothes flapping in the wind. If it was not Xiao Bai Yi, who else could it be?

This guy was always wearing white clothes, and he always looked elegant and cold since the day he met Yang Kai; however, he seemed to be in a bad situation right now, his white robes dotted with red blood, looking quite miserable.

Next to him was another figure that Yang Kai was familiar with.

It was Murong Xiao Xiao!

These two elite disciples of Azure Sun Temple were standing back-to-back on top of a small island, each performing Secret Techniques to resist the attacks coming at them from all directions. The small island they were on was not big, just enough for them to settle down.

Both of them were the elites among the elites, and after not seeing them for a few years, both of them had clearly reached the peak of the Third-Order Dao Source Realm, but they were outnumbered now and stuck in a difficult situation. Blood spurted out of Xiao Bai Yi’s body from time to time, while Murong Xiao Xiao’s hair looked messy, her clothes soaked in sweat, attaching tightly to her tender body.

When Yang Kai saw this scene, he realized that those who besieged them had not completely sealed off their path of escape. In other words, Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao still had a chance to withdraw.

It was just that the two of them did not have the intention to run away. One looked cold and determined, while the other looked furious and sorrowful. Both of them stood their ground and kept unleashing their strength.

This was a territory war!

Yang Kai noticed it at a glance. The island occupied by Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao was obviously favoured by their attackers. These people probably wanted to overwhelm the Azure Sun Temple pair with numbers and force them to give way, but after initiating the battle, they came to realize that Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were not easy to be dealt with.

The gap that they opened deliberately was intended for Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao to leave. This was the reason why they did not completely surround them while besieging them. They did not want to fight them to death, and hoped that they could force them away.

Unfortunately, Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao did not plan to escape, causing the battle to intensify moment by moment.

Yang Kai hurriedly turned around and rushed towards them.

He was still regarded as an in-name disciple of Azure Sun Temple, and Wen Zi Shan and Gao Xue Ting had taken great care of him in the past. Furthermore, Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were his friends, so how could he just stand idly by in this situation?

Seemingly oblivious to Yang Kai’s movement, a long-faced old man who was besieging Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao warned, “We will give you one last chance, will you leave or not!?”

Murong Xiao Xiao gritted her teeth and shouted, “Don’t you dream of stealing our location unless you kill us!”

Xiao Bai Yi did not say a word, but the sword on his hand blossomed with many sword flowers, and his murderous intent answered for himself.

“Good, there was a path to the Heavens, but you refused to take it and chose the door to Hell instead. Since that’s the case, don’t blame us for being ruthless!” Saying so, the long-faced old man signalled the rest of his group and put on a ferocious expression. It was obvious that he did not want to delay any longer and intended to end the fight quickly.

The others understood his intentions and their actions changed, becoming more decisive and brutal.

The faces of Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao darkened, feeling heavily pressured.

The long-faced old man seemed to sense Yang Kai at that moment and with a flicker, turned to greet him with cupped fists, “Friend, Western Territory Pointed Star Sect is dealing with some matters here. Please don’t interfere with us and make a detour!”

“Oh? Are you guys from the Pointed Star Sect?” Yang Kai did not stop his pace, but accelerated with a joyful face.

“Indeed, who is Your Excellency?” From Yang Kai’s words, the long-faced old man thought that Yang Kai was also a cultivator from Western Territory and he could not help looking at him suspiciously, wondering which Sect he came from.

Yang Kai replied with a proud face, “I’m from King of Hell’s Palace!”

“King of Hell’s Palace?” The long-faced old man wore a bewildered expression as he could not recall any Sect in the Western Territory named after the King of Hell’s Palace, but soon, he reacted with a darkened expression, “Is Your Excellency teasing this Old Master?”

None of the Sects would use a name like ‘King of Hell’s Palace’ that could easily gain public hatred, so it was obvious that Yang Kai was making things up.

Yang Kai grinned, “Why would I? I really belong to the King of Hell’s Palace…” At this point, his face abruptly turned solemn and continued with a deep voice, “The King of Hell sent me to deliver your life to him!”

The long-faced old man’s face changed drastically and he bellowed, “Little brat, you court death!”

The Source Qi in his body surged as he hastily performed a mysterious hand seal before stretching his claws out to grab Yang Kai, seemingly wanting to show Yang Kai a bit of his superiority.

But what horrified him was that Yang Kai suddenly disappeared before his eyes.

This strange scene surprised the old man because he could not figure out how Yang Kai disappeared at all. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the next instant, the old man felt a chill shoot up his spine, making him wonder if he had encountered a ghost.

Before he could finish his thoughts though, Yang Kai’s face reappeared in front of his, so close he could feel the other party’s breath.

The long-faced old man gasped and immediately retreated, pushing his Source Qi madly to form a visible shield around his body as protection.

Yang Kai revealed a sly smile on his face and a white lotus bud appeared in his left eye before shooting out in a flash.

Blossoming Lotus!

Yang Kai’s Soul had strengthened greatly over the past year and a half while he was subduing the Mountains and Rivers Bell. Now, he felt more and more proficient in using this Soul Secret Technique, and the power it could display was also far higher than before.

The white lotus bud instantly turned into a magical power that tore through the old man’s protection and rushed into his Knowledge Sea.

Just when the horrified old man was retreating, he suddenly stiffened in his place, with his eyes frozen as a pained look appeared on his face.

There was now only a white lotus bud left in his vision, blooming hastily, its radiance seemingly devouring his entire body and mind.

Yang Kai immediately sent out a punch, and under a blast of the violent power, the long-faced old man exploded into a mist of blood, leaving not even bones as his remains scattered across the Source Sea below.

“Ah!”

A scream was heard as the people who were besieging Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao stared in shock at this scene.

Although the long-faced old man was a bit aged, his strength was definitely not low. He could easily be ranked among the top three Dao Source Realm cultivators in Western Territory’s Pointed Star Sect; however, such a strong Master had actually been helpless before a single punch from this strange young man who had come out of nowhere.

The old man had just ordered his people to decide the battle quickly, but now he himself had been killed in the blink of an eye.

The one who killed him, could it be an Emperor Realm Master?

Even though there were not many Emperor Realm Masters in Shattered Star Sea, there were definitely not a few either.

The bloody death scene of the old man scared the few disciples of Pointed Star Sect to death as they thought an Emperor had appeared. Seeing Yang Kai rushing towards them unceasingly with a cold smile on his face, they dared not remain.

They left Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao and escaped one after another. At this time, they did not even dare to avenge the old man, only caring for their own lives.

“Solidify!” Yang Kai reached out his hand and grasped towards the void, causing a surge of Space Principles that froze the surrounding space.

The few people who were fleeing widened their eyes in panic, realizing that they were now moving as slow as turtles, sweat beading on their foreheads as chills filled their bodies.

Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao were overjoyed seeing this situation. They did not know who was helping them as they did not have the time to check the appearance of this stranger, but regardless, at this moment, they could finally let out all the anger that was accumulated due to the actions of the Pointed Star Sect disciples before.

“Mortal Sword, Swirling Destruction!”

“Earth Sword, Falling Thunder!”

“Heaven Sword, Shattering Star!”

The three sword skills of Xiao Bai Yi’s Secret Technique were sent in sequence through his longsword. The ferocious power of the combination of three sword skills caused the world to shake.

Although Murong Xiao Xiao was a woman who always gave Yang Kai the impression that she was gentle and elegant, she revealed her merciless side at this moment, summoning a pair of Heavenly Feather Rings that instantly divided into two, then four, then eight and so on, swiftly enveloping the Pointed Star Sect disciples layer by layer.

Screams were heard one after another as the several Pointed Star Sect disciples, who lost their fighting spirit and intended to run away, could not resist the incoming attacks as their bodies were being restrained by Yang Kai.

The two elite disciples of Azure Sun Temple unleashed their strikes, and these people collapsed like straws.

At that moment, the sky filled with blood and flesh, with severed limbs flying this way and that.

Within not more than ten breaths of time, the few remaining Pointed Star Sect disciples were killed on the spot, and their corpses fell into the Source Sea below.

Star Seals shot out from the backs of these people’s hands one after another towards Xiao Bai Yi and Murong Xiao Xiao, who quickly divided them between them.

“Many thanks to this Senior Brother for his assistance… Ah! It’s Senior Brother Yang!” Murong Xiao Xiao immediately recognized Yang Kai and exclaimed with joy when she turned around to thank him.

Previously, she was still wondering who would actually help her and Xiao Bai Yi in this situation, not having expected it to be Yang Kai.

Xiao Bai Yi remained silent, but turned to Yang Kai with a look of saying ‘I knew it was you’, staying aloof as usual.

After all, Yang Kai had used the Space Principles during their battle in the Flowing Time Temple, so Xiao Bai Yi knew it was Yang Kai who had come once he felt the familiar fluctuations.

Now that he had turned to look, he was indeed correct.

“Sister Murong, I haven’t seen you in a few years but you have become far more beautiful!” Yang Kai flew over in front of them with a smile and greeted Murong Xiao Xiao.

Murong Xiao Xiao blushed and stomped her foot, “Senior Brother Yang is making fun of me.”

“I’m not making fun of you. I’m just speaking the truth!” Yang Kai responded solemnly.

Murong Xiao Xiao blushed even deeper.
