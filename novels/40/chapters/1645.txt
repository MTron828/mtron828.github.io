“As expected. It’s you!” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

Ran Yun Ting returned the gesture as she looked down at Yang Kai condescendingly, as if overlooking an ant.

“It seems you very much want my life!” A sarcastic smile appeared on Yang Kai’s face, “It must have taken a great deal of effort to set up this situation to force me out, right?”

When he sensed that Ran Yun Ting was nearby, Yang Kai immediately knew that this situation was no accident but was instead a carefully laid trap.

Today, whether he had come to seek out Qing Ya or not, he would have been drawn over. That was why Bing Die had deliberately shouted after arriving in front of Qing Ya’s cave mansion, to ensure Yang Kai was alarmed in his housing nearby.

As long as he took notice of Bing Die’s intentions, Yang Kai would act.

It was just that no one had thought that Yang Kai would happen to be nearby already.

Repeatedly making things difficult for Qing Ya, accusing her of such great crimes, and even using a heavy hand when attacking her, were all just ploys to force Yang Kai into fighting back.

At the very end, Bing Die even ignored the safety of her fellow Law Enforcement Hall disciples and ordered them to kill Yang Kai just to provoke a response from him.

Everything was an act to achieve this objective.

And the person behind this plot was undoubtedly Ran Yun Ting!

As Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder, holding the powers she did, manipulating the Law Enforcement Hall to act was a minor matter.

Qing Ya is just an innocent pawn while Ran Yun Ting’s ultimate goal was Yang Kai!

“Great Elder...” Qing Ya looked towards the aloof Ran Yun Ting.

“Ungrateful thing, you’re not qualified to speak to me!” Ran Yun Ting glanced over at Qing Ya coldly and with a wave of her hand sent out an icy blast towards her.

Qing Ya simply stood in place, unable to react.

Yang Kai once again appeared in front of her though and sent out a punch of his own.

Demonic Flame burst out and the black flames impacted the icy blast, the two forces mutually destroying one another, creating an intense explosion of hot and cold energy that even warped the surrounding space.

Ran Yun Ting raised her brow as she finally gave Yang Kai a serious look, secretly shocked by his strength.

Although she hadn’t unleashed her full strength in the blow just now and seemed to only be casually waving her hand, she had still used a third of her power, but Yang Kai had resolved her attack with an equally casual one.

[It is obvious that he has power to spare!]

“Originally, I didn’t quite believe you had truly killed Jiang Xi and Yan Chi Lei with your ability alone, but now it seems to be true. Not bad indeed!” Ran Yun Ting nodded slightly, not changing continence much even after witnessing Yang Kai’s prowess, simply offering a few light words of praise. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“However, that’s all there is to you. Since you have injured my Ice Heart Valley’s disciples on my Pure Ice Island, not putting my Ice Heart Valley in your eyes, you will definitely die today!” Ran Yun Ting’s eyes suddenly became cold and without any emotion declared to Yang Kai, “It is your honour to die at this Elder’s hands!”

On the ice peak, countless female disciples’ tender bodies trembled as they stared at Ran Yun Ting in shock.

Great Elder was going to take action personally?

What was the origin of this young man? The Sect searched for him so hard before, yet the Great Elder wanted to kill him now? What kind of unknown story had taken place without their knowing? Everyone was at a loss, wondering what was going on.

However... It seemed that Great Elder had not truly fought for some time.

It was rumoured that the last time she engaged in a real battle was ten years ago, but no one witnessed that fight with their own eyes and only knew that her opponent had become an ice sculpture.

Now, Great Elder wanted to kill this young man here on Pure Ice Island.

At that moment, the countless Ice Heart Valley disciples were eagerly looking forward to seeing the great power of their Great Elder.

Many people responded with sympathetic glances towards Yang Kai, secretly thinking that since this young man had provoked Great Elder, he would be buried on Pure Ice Island today.

Before everyone’s eyes, Yang Kai’s cold and angry expression suddenly became calm. This strange change made everyone’s heart jump as they felt a vague sense of unease.

Immediately, Yang Kai turned to Ran Yun Ting and bowed slightly.

He actually bowed!

Everyone’s eyes bulged in shock.

All the disciples of Ice Heart Valley did not understand what Yang Kai was trying to do, actually bowing to their Great Elder when facing her murderous intent.

Was he scared? Did this man know that he was not Great Elder’s opponent, so he wanted to compromise to survive?

Bing Die to the side couldn’t help snickering as she stared at Yang Kai mockingly. She despised this type of gutless man who bullied the weak but feared the strong the most.

[And this man wanted to capture Su Yan’s heart? What utter nonsense.]

“It’s too late to admit your mistakes now!” Ran Yun Ting still stood aloof, her expression unchanged as her tone remained cold and indifferent, “You should know in your heart why this Elder wants to kill you. If you really understand, if you want what is best for her, you should commit suicide here and now! This Elder would prefer to not stain her hands with your blood; after all, I will see her often in the future.”

As if she was giving Yang Kai a final benevolent gift, Ran Yun Ting stood in place and waited quietly, allowing Yang Kai to decide how he would die himself.

Yang Kai, however, just smiled back at her, his face still calm as he gently shook his head and declared, “I did nothing wrong!”

Ran Yun Ting’s expression instantly turned grim, “Things have already gotten to this point yet, you still insist on remaining stubborn? She is not someone the likes of you can match. She is going to reach the peak of the Martial Dao. In the future, you will only be able to look up to her as she gets further and further away! Rather than suffering in the future, it is best for both of you if you disappear now. If you do this for her, she may still remember you for the rest of her life. Only those who can endure unending loneliness and solitude can achieve true greatness! Do you still not understand what lies ahead if you continue on this path?”

“It is you who are blind to the future!” Yang Kai looked at Ran Yun Ting lightly, “I bow to you today to thank you for teaching and caring for her over the years, but after this point, you and I will be enemies! If you insist on killing me still, you must prepare yourself to die by my hand as well!”

Ran Yun Ting’s pair of phoenix eyes flashed with murderous intent, making all who were watching her cower. Fearful, all the female disciples of Ice Heart Valley were unable to help turning their gazes away.

Yang Kai remained indifferent though, his eyes still staring into hers without flinching in the slightest.

“As for whether I can match her, that is not for you to decide. Who says ascending to the peak of the Martial Dao is a path one must walk alone? I will reach that supreme summit hand in hand with her!”

“Ignorant child, any more talk is useless. Surrender your life!” Ran Yun Ting seemed to be irritated by Yang Kai’s wild words and refused to listen to any more of his nonsense. Stretching out her hand, she created a vortex that drew in all the Ice Attribute Energy from the surrounding ten kilometres and used her Saint Qi to condense a several-dozen-metre-long, tens-of-metres-thick ice lance.

At first glance, this ice lance looked more like an inverted ice peak, imposing and majestic.

The onlooking disciples all exclaimed in shock as they stared at this scene in amazement.

The Great Elder’s might was earth-shaking, making all them stare at her with eyes filled with worship and yearning.

All of them could not help wondering when they too would be able to stand at the same height as their Great Elder!

However, most of them knew that this was nothing but an unrealistic fantasy. In the Sect, aside from a select few like Su Yan, none had the potential to reach this level. All of them were destined to be the foils for these geniuses.

Many thoughts passed through the minds of these female disciples as they used their Movement Skills to withdraw.

None of them dared to remain in place as a fight on the Great Elder’s level would surely wreak terrifying destruction. If they stayed so close, they would likely get caught up in the fallout.

Yang Kai stretched out his hand and sent Qing Ya a few kilometres away with a wave before he leapt up and charged towards the small ice mountain without any trace of fear.

Ran Yun Ting narrowed her eyes and formed a seal with both her hands as she exhaled a white mist that poured it into the ice lance.

In a flash of light, the ice lance began radiating an even more intense destructive aura as she sent it flying forward.

Dark flames burned on Yang Kai’s two fists as he pushed his Saint Qi to the limit before he swung them wildly towards the ice lance.

*Hong Hong Hong...*

A thunderous noise rang out as the ice lance was being broken apart inch by inch.

Yang Kai was like a fierce beast swimming against the raging current, and wherever he went, chunks of ice were sent flying. He moved with unstoppable momentum, blasting the ice lance to pieces as easily as if it were rotting wood before directly arriving in front of Ran Yun Ting.

Everything happened in the blink of an eye!

“I respected you as Su Yan’s Master, and did not want to embarrass you, but since you insist on killing me, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Yang Kai’s voice was ice-cold as he stood just ten metres away from Ran Yun Ting and once again sent out a punch.

An astonishing Saint Qi accompanied this fist and the surrounding space seemed to distort as the area around Ran Yun Ting began filling with tiny, flickering Void Cracks.

Ice Heart Valley’s Great Elder was so shocked that she could not help crying out.

At this moment, she had the illusion that her life was hanging by a thread, and that if she did not exert her full strength immediately, she would undoubtedly die.

In truth, Ran Yun Ting had never paid any attention to Yang Kai. Although she had learned from Thirteenth Elder Yu Xue Qing that Yang Kai killed Jiang Xi and Yan Chi Lei, Ran Yun Ting hadn’t seen this with her own eyes and simply felt that even if Yang Kai was a rising star, able to fight opponents above his realm, he couldn’t be her opponent.

She was a character who achieved fame a long time ago and was at the very peak of the Third-Order Origin Returning Realm, possessing strength second only to an Origin King.

But the instant their battle truly began, she felt tremendous pressure from Yang Kai.

This young man was like an extremely sharp sword that had been released from its sheath, his strength and momentum seemingly even more powerful than her own!

Breaking out into a cold sweat, Ran Yun Ting’s complexion changed drastically as she madly pushed her strength.

Snow filled the surrounding thousand-metre radius around her and the temperature in this range plummeted. Each tiny snowflake in this region seemed to contain a mysterious power.

This was Ran Yun Ting’s Shi, and in its range, she became the one and only master. The falling snow became her strongest weapon, capable of killing any enemy which it enveloped.

Even the wandering Void Cracks froze over.

Staring at Yang Kai coldly, her murderous intent rose to even greater heights, she commanded the falling snow with her mind to swiftly engulf Yang Kai.
