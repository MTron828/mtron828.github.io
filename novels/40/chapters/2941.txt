Zhu Lie coldly snorted, “Probably means I’m not sure! Are you stupid?”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but he was speechless, his mood instantly becoming terrible.

Zhu Lie glanced at him and chuckled, “You seem concerned about her. Are you curious to know her situation?”

Yang Kai snickered, “It’s not like I’m that close with her, so why would I be concerned? Whether she lives or dies has nothing to do with me. Naturally, that’s the business of your Dragon Island, so enough with the nonsense.”

Zhu Lie shrugged, “The last time she contacted Dragon Island was two months ago, and it’s precisely because we were sure that she was in a dangerous place and would most likely lose her life there that I came out from Dragon Island to look for you.”

“What are you looking for me for?” Yang Kai asked, dissatisfied.

Zhu Lie answered, “Her mission hasn’t been completed, so naturally, someone has to complete it for her!” Shaking his head, he sighed, “Only, it seems like I, too, will not be able to bring you back to Dragon Island. But remember, Dragon Island won’t give up. You won’t be so lucky next time.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “Go back and tell your Dragon Clan that if anyone dares to disturb this Young Master again, send one and I will kill one, send two and I will kill two. I just don’t know how many Dragon Clan members you have on Dragon Island for me to kill.”

Zhu Lie’s face turned dark and he gritted his teeth, hissing, “Shameless boasting!”

“Off you go!”

With a flick of his sleeve, Yang Kai turned around and went back into Spirit Sword Peak. Zhu Lie stood in place and stared for a long time before his body moved, flying away in a stream of light.

No one intercepted him on the way. Right now, the temple was busy with the Demon Banishment Order and the search for Wu Kuang, so most of the Sect’s Masters were outside and it was naturally impossible for those who were left to try to stop a Dragon.

Zhu Lie moved very quickly and left Azure Sun Temple in just a short while, but just as soon as he left the Azure Sun Mountain Range, he paused, his eyes staring coldly at a figure in front of him. It was Yang Kai.

Zhu Lie had no idea when he had run past him, or how long he had been standing there with his hands behind his back, but he was annoyed and shouted angrily, “What do you want now? You’re not thinking of going back on your word, are you? This Dragon is not even thinking about starting trouble with you, but if you dare to go against your word…”

“Don’t be so nervous!” Yang Kai interrupted him with a cold smile on his face, “I just want to ask how your Dragon Island is prepared to deal with Zhu Qing’s matter.”

“Zhu Qing is already dead, what else can we do?” Zhu Lie frowned.

Yang Kai said, “Didn’t you say probably, and that you weren’t sure just now? So why are you so sure now that she’s dead?”

Zhu Lie told him, “Even if she’s not dead, she won’t be alive for long. The place that she went to is the Frozen Earth. You should know how dangerous that place is.”

“ I know. If it wasn’t dangerous, then it would have been impossible for one of your Dragon Clan to have been lost there to begin with. I just wanted to ask, is your Dragon Island not planning to save her?”

Zhu Lie sneered, “She’s an Eighth-Order Red Dragon, if even she lost her life there, then there aren’t many Dragons on the island who can guarantee their own safety. Dragon Island will not risk the lives of other clansmen just to save a fellow clansman who they’re not even sure is dead or alive!”

Yang Kai shouted, “Even if she’s dead, you should go and collect her corpse! She’s one of your clansmen after all!”

Zhu Lie scoffed at him, “She did not know the immensity of Heaven and Earth and decided to trespass into the Frozen Earth, so why should others join her in taking this risk? If she’s dead, then she’s dead. No one will go and save her either.”

“Is this what you think, or is this what Dragon Island thinks?” Yang Kai’s expression was dark.

“It’s what I think and it’s what Dragon Island thinks!” Zhu Lie turned his head away, not meeting Yang Kai’s eyes.

Yang Kai was silent for a moment before muttering, “I really feel like punching you.”

Zhu Lie sneered, “Haven’t you beaten me enough these days? This Dragon will surely return the shame that you gave a hundred times in the future!”

“Talk to me after you can beat me.” Yang Kai looked in contempt at him and turned around, flying back to Azure Sun Temple.

He returned to Spirit Sword Peak in just a few breaths, coming straight to the back of the mountain. Even though they had just experienced the escape of the Demon Spirits at Spirit Sword Peak, the back of the mountain did not suffer much damage, so the Cross-Territory Space Array he placed there was perfectly undamaged.

It wasn’t until he stood in front of the Space Array that Yang Kai suddenly came back to his senses. His mind was so filled with other thoughts earlier that he didn’t even notice his own movements, and by the time he realized, he was already here.

“Follow your heart, huh…” Yang Kai muttered softly and said helplessly to himself, “How troublesome.”

Despite that, the hesitation on his face disappeared without a trace, replaced with a look of determination.

A noise whistling through the air was approaching from the distance. Yang Kai turned his head around and saw a fiery red light flying in. Seemingly able to sense Yang Kai’s location, it came straight to the back of the mountain, landing not far away from him.

“What?” Yang Kai looked at Zhu Lie who decided to turn back without much enthusiasm, looking as if he wanted to fight with him.

Zhu Lie asked, “Are you planning on going to the Frozen Earth to look for Zhu Qing?”

“None of your damn business!” Yang Kai scoffed.

Zhu Lie’s face distorted a little. Turning away, he said, “If you’re going to go, count me in.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brow, looking at him with interest, “Give me a reason, and don’t tell me it’s because you found your conscience or some other nonsense. I’m not going to believe such a childish reason.”

Zhu Lie scratched his nose and said, “Zhu Qing is my Elder Sister!”

Yang Kai was slightly surprised, but he soon relaxed.

He had a vague feeling prior to this that Zhu Lie and Zhu Qing shared some sort of blood relationship because of certain similarities in their appearance and characteristics. Only, since he asked once and didn’t get an answer, he didn’t bother to get to the bottom of things.

But only now did Yang Kai find out that his guess was correct. These two Red Dragons were, in fact, siblings.

“Is that reason enough?” Zhu Lie looked at Yang Kai with a serious expression.

“En, it’s enough.” Yang Kai nodded before stepping onto the Space Array and calling out, “Get on.”

Zhu Lie frowned. Even though he had no idea what Yang Kai was going to do, he didn’t sense any hostility from him, so with utter confidence in his own strength, Zhu Lie mounted the array.

“Don’t resist!” As Yang Kai shouted, Space Principles began to fluctuate. The Void seemed to collapse in on itself in that instant, and if Yang Kai had not warned him, Zhu Lie would likely have tried to struggle, and would perhaps have been exiled to the Void as a result.

With a flash of light, the two figures disappeared.

At the same time, the Northern Territory’s High Heaven Palace.

At the Space Array, both Yang Kai and Zhu Lie appeared at the same time. Seeing their arrival, the two disciples who were keeping watch at the side quickly saluted, “Greetings Palace Master!”

Yang Kai nodded before taking out his communication artifact and pouring a message into it. Then, he stood in place, waiting. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zhu Lie had already recovered from the side effects of the cross-territory teleportation and was now looking around, frowning as he asked, “Where is this?”

Yang Kai answered without even turning back, “The Northern Territory, High Heaven Palace!”

Zhu Lie was stunned for a moment before he began observing the Space Array, pondering, “Zhu Qing said you had a Cross-Territory Space Array here. So it’s true.”

Yang Kai fumed, “Why does that damn woman report everything to Dragon Island? Do I have no secrets at all over there?”

Zhu Lie frowned, “Watch your words, Human. That’s my Elder Sister you’re talking about!”

Yang Kai sneered, “Elder Sister? I didn’t see you taking the initiative to save your Elder Sister. If I had a brother like you, I would have strangled him a long time ago, what would I need him for!”

“What do you know?!” It was not known which one of Yang Kai’s words struck a sensitive nerve in Zhu Lie, sending him into a rage as he gnashed his teeth, “You think I don’t want to save her? You think I’m willing to just watch her die out there!?”

“Then why didn’t you go? Wherever the heart leads, the body should follow. Cultivators like us should tread upon the path we determine for ourselves, bravely, without hesitation or regret. The only thing we should fear is being over cautious and indecisive. If Zhu Qing is really your Elder Sister, then you shouldn’t have sought me out at Azure Sun Temple. You should have looked for her in the Frozen Earth. Even if you died, you should die together with her. Now, with time delayed, you may have cut off her only chance to survive.”

Zhu Lie’s mouth opened and closed, looking extremely angry, and even his eyes seemed to burn.

But for some reason, those fires suddenly died down. Face hazing over, he sighed, “Wherever the heart leads, the body should follow. Is that the reason you want to save her?”

Yang Kai curled his lip, “What else? I don’t know her well enough to risk my life for her, and I’d rather she have gone and died sooner rather than later… But since the thought of saving her appeared in my heart, I’m afraid this thought will haunt me and become a heart demon if I don’t take action.”

Zhu Lie said, “No matter what, I thank you in Zhu Qing’s place.”

“No need to thank me, just don’t bother me in the future.” Yang Kai coldly snorted.

A beautiful figure flew over from afar at that time and landed in front of the pair. It was High Heaven Palace’s Head Manager, Hua Qing Si. Cupping her fist, she spoke, “Palace Master, you’ve returned!” While speaking, she glanced curiously at Zhu Lie who was standing next to Yang Kai, but asked no questions about him.

Naturally, Zhu Lie did not bother to say anything. Members of the Dragon Clan had always been arrogant, and if he had not suffered so much at Yang Kai’s hands, he wouldn’t even look at the latter either.

“We’ll be leaving immediately.” Yang Kai looked to be in a hurry.

“Where are you going?” Hua Qing Si asked.

“I have to make a visit to Fire Dragon Palace. Are we connected to Fire Dragon Palace’s Space Array?”

Hua Qing Si responded, “I proposed it before, but Li Jiao wasn’t too willing, so I didn’t force the issue.”

“Of course he wouldn’t be…” Yang Kai smirked. Even though Fire Dragon Palace and Full Sky Sect were established top Sects in the Northern Territory, both of them ate a big loss at Yang Kai’s hands and now owed a huge debt to High Heaven Palace that they would not be able to pay back even after a few dozen years, so how could they be willing to connect their Space Arrays with their debtors? Wouldn’t this just make it more convenient for debt collectors to come and demand payment?

“No matter, I’ll just fly there directly. Point me in their direction.”

Hua Qing Si quickly pointed in a certain direction and said, “Fire Dragon Palace is that way. With Palace Master’s speed, it should only take about three days. Does Palace Master need me to accompany you? I’ve been to Fire Dragon Palace once.”

“No need.” Yang Kai waved his hand. But then, he changed to Divine Sense transmission, “How is the situation with the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld?”

Hua Qing Si adopted a serious countenance and replied, “Everything has been arranged and Chi Yue and the others have gone in once already, gaining much from the experience. However, the scope and scale of the Thousand Illusions Dreamworld are too big. I’m afraid it will take some time to map out the rules. I’m preparing to choose some disciples from Thousand Leaves Sect for the next batch to enter.”
