Chapter 950, Guest From Twin Spirit Pavilion

Soaring Heaven Sect, deep inside the depths of the prison mountain, Yang Kai pushed his True Yang Yuan Qi fiercely and engulfed the Bone Race skeleton in it, burning it down.

Chu Ling Xiao and the others all stood by close and watched quietly.

Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi was not an ordinary flame, it was the crystallization of his cultivation, an incredibly pure and dense form of energy, there was nothing it could not incinerate.

The Bone Race master, bound by the Demon Sealing Chain and various artifacts, seemed to be dead.

But the malevolent aura which emanated from his body was actually becoming more and more intense.

*Chi chi chi...*

Inside the dimly lit room, a harsh, grating sound resounded as cracks spread throughout the Bone Race’s skeleton, his meridians and bones slowly reducing to ash.

Suddenly, the two deep green lights appeared in the eye sockets of the Bone Race master, just like a pair of gloomy eyes which flickered erratically.

The malevolent aura suddenly exploded out.

*Hou...* An angry roar suddenly burst forth from the Bone Race’s head, his Spiritual Energy penetrating into the Knowledge Seas of everyone nearby, allowing them to clearly sense his violent unwillingness. This scream also contained a potent yet mysterious Divine Sense attack which caused the Souls of everyone except Chu Ling Xiao to tremble.

Everyone paled at this sight and Yang Kai hastily increased the output of his True Qi.

*Kacha...*

Under the intense heat, the skeleton gradually disintegrated.

The green glowing eyes of the Bone Race master also quickly dimmed and eventually lost all light.

After the time it would take to burn a stick on incense, only a black powder remained.

Everyone stared at this sight for a moment, unable to speak.

“He really hadn’t died... such tenacious vitality!” Fei Yu wore a frightened look.

“All that was left was his skeleton, how could he have survived?” Cang Yan also couldn’t understand.

“Perhaps, he was originally just a skeleton, with no flesh or blood at all, or perhaps his skeleton was the core of his life essence...” Yang Kai spoke thoughtfully.

“What Little Martial Nephew means to say is that as long as his skeleton remains, he won’t die?”

“En,” Yang Kai nodded, “In any case, this race is completely different from the others in this world, and is extremely dangerous. If any of us encounter them again in the future, we mustn’t take them lightly.”

“Rest assured, if I ever bump into these creatures again, I’ll definitely smash their bones,” Li Wan said firmly.

“Is there really such a strange race in this world?” Chu Ling Xiao’s brow wrinkled. Even with all his knowledge and experience, if Yang Kai hadn’t arrived today, he wouldn’t have been able to figure out the identity of the Bone Race master he had captured.

When he had entered the Snow Mountain Range to investigate all those months ago, following the shocking evil aura he had sensed, all Chu Ling Xiao had found was a skeleton buried a thousand meters beneath the ice. It was only because he realized there was something strange about it that he brought it back.

Fortunately, he had the foresight to seal and suppress it.

“For some time now, this old master has felt that this world has become subtly different,” Chu Ling Xiao solemnly said.

“The meaning of Ancestral Founder is...” Yang Kai turned a curious look towards him.

Chu Ling Xiao hesitated for a moment before finally saying, “Your realm is not high enough, so you probably have not noticed yet, but I believe that all the Third Order Saints around the world have the same feeling as this old master. This world seems to have somehow been released from something, and the stars in the night sky are also much clearer and more numerous than before.”

Yang Kai’s look changed.

“This old master doesn’t know why, but it’s as if some great change is approaching,” Chu Ling Xiao sighed.

The four other Saints present shivered, finally understand why since the day he had brought back the Bone Race skeleton, their Martial Ancestor had often left his cultivation room at night to stare up at the night sky.

They didn’t know why their Marital Ancestor had suddenly begun taking such a strange action, they had only thought that Chu Ling Xiao had obtained some kind of enlightenment, but listening to his words just now, they now know that he had actually discovered something unusual.

After spending two days in Soaring Heaven Sect, Yang Kai returned to Nine Heavens Holy Land with Ling Tai Xu and Su Mu.

When they left, Chu Ling Xiao had sternly cautioned them and repeated insisted that if they encountered another Bone Race master again, they must let him know.

Yang Kai readily agreed.

Along the way, Yang Kai remained silent, lost in thought.

Ling Tai Xu did not miss his absent-mindedness and asked, “Is there something wrong?”

Yang Kai nodded and told him about the Bone Race matter, causing Ling Tai Xu to pale slightly. Unfortunately, there was nothing Ling Tai Xu could contribute to the discussion; after all, he had just arrived in Tong Xuan Realm and was unfamiliar with even the common sense of this world, let alone something as out of the ordinary as the Bone Race.

In the past, back in the Great Han Dynasty, he hadn’t even known about the existence of the Demon and Monster Races.

He had thought that under the Heavens, the only race capable of rational thought was the Human Race.

It was only after arriving in Tong Xuan Realm that Ling Tai Xu realized his own naivety.

“Grand Master doesn’t need to worry about this matter, if the sky collapses, the world’s giants will be there to hold it up,” Yang Kai laughed, relaxing his expression greatly before turning to look at Su Mu and asking with a smile, “What good things did you obtain that you can’t stop grinning?”

Su Mu chuckled and took out a Universe Bag, “Look, this is a gift from Ancestral Founder.”

“A Universe Bag!” Yang Kai nodded, “Do you know how to use it?”

“Of course I do, the Ancestral Founder, Martial Uncles, and Martial Aunt all gave me many artifacts, Martial Skills, Secret Arts, ancient books, and other treasures,” Su Mu held the Universe Bag to his chest and gently patted it.

“You must make good use of all the treasures you received, do not disappoint the expectations of Ancestral Founder and your Martial Seniors,” Ling Tai Xu said sincerely. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Disciple knows,” Su Mu nodded before suddenly asking, “Brother-in-law, when are you going to bring Elder Sister back? Our entire Sect has migrated here, I think it’s a good time for her to return.”

“En, after sending the two of you back, I plan to go look for Su Yan,” Yang Kai responded.

Even if Su Mu did not remind him, Yang Kai had been planning to do so. After nearly eight years apart, Yang Kai had grown quite anxious to see his beloved again.

Now that Xia Ning Chang was also in Nine Heavens Holy Land, he only needed to find Su Yan so that they could all reunite.

Yang Kai very much yearned for such a day!

Two days later, the three returned to the old War Spirit Temple site.

Just after returning to this place, Xu Hui, who heard the news, flew over and reported, “Holy Master, two guests arrived at the Holy Land two days ago and requested to see you.”

“Who are they?” Yang Kai asked.

“They announced themselves as the Sect Masters of Twin Spirit Pavilion, Wu Fa and Wu Tian!” Xu Hui reported with a wry smile, unable to stop himself, apparently thinking that their names were far too rampant.

“Oh? They came personally?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

On the way to the Nine Heavens Holy Land with the Great Han Dynasty cultivators, Palace Master Chen Zhou of Dragon Phoenix Palace had sent Xiao Ling, one of his Sect’s Elders, to Twin Spirit Pavilion to deliver a message. Now, only a few months later, Twin Spirit Pavilion had taken swift action.

The two Sect Masters travelling all this way to seek an audience with Yang Kai explained just how much importance they placed on the Hu Sisters.

This made Yang Kai very satisfied; at least they had shown enough sincerity.

“Holy Master, do you wish to see them?” Xu Hui asked.

“Of course I must see them. Where are they now?”

“They are waiting inside the Holy Land!”

“Good, continue to entertain them and tell them I will return shortly.”

Xu Hui acknowledged the command and quickly departed.

After he left, Yang Kai spread out his Divine Sense to search the former War Spirit Temple site, soon finding the location of the Hu Sisters and rushing over to see them.

War Spirit Temple’s grounds covered a large area and the Blood Battle Gang was situated in the northwest corner where a number of splendid residences had previously been constructed.

The Hu Sisters and Sect Master Hu Man were currently working with the gang’s disciples to repair these broken houses and clean up the surrounding area, keeping themselves occupied.

Seeing Yang Kai appear, Hu Man smiled and walked over, cupping his fists as he said, “Nephew Yang, you’ve come.”

The Hu Sisters’ beautiful eyes brightened as well as they smiled happily.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and asked, “How are things here, is there anything you’re unsatisfied with?”

Hu Man quickly waved his hand, “How could there be anything we’re unsatisfied with? Nephew Yang has already arranged everything and provided so many cultivation resources, all we need to do is cultivate diligently. As for the environment, we weren’t picky in the first place so we couldn’t be happier.”

“That’s good. En, if you have anything you need, just inform my Holy Land’s Elders and they will do everything they can to accommodate you.”

“We have no additional needs,” Hu Man laughed before smoothly changing the subject, “The only request I could think of would be for Nephew Yang to find some free time to help teach my two daughters. If you could, this Hu would be most grateful. En, personal guidance at night would be the best, it would greatly ease this Hu’s worries, heh heh heh!”

“Father, if you continue speaking, someday, you might turn mute!” Hu Jiao’er turned red and glared at her father.

Since coming here, Hu Man had constantly been mentioning how much he appreciated Yang Kai to his two daughters. What their father was thinking, the sisters knew, but now that he was all but spelling it out to them, what’s more right in front of Yang Kai, Hu Jiao’er suddenly couldn’t take it anymore.

What this so called father of theirs’ plan was, was clearly written on his face.

“I’ll leave you three to talk!” Hu Man let out a hollow laugh and quickly slipped away.

“Don’t pay any attention to him,” Hu Jiao’er quickly walked over to Yang Kai, the blush on her face still not faded as she faintly whispered, “He’s just spouting nonsense.”

“Why did you suddenly come to see us?” Hu Mei’er asked.

“Guests from Twin Spirit Pavilion have come,” Yang Kai replied frankly.

The two Hu Sisters trembled lightly as they directed glowing gazes towards Yang Kai.

“The ones who have come are the two Sect Masters of Twin Spirit Pavilion, their purpose is obvious and they’ve displayed their sincerity. All that’s left is for you two to decide how you want to proceed.”

The two sisters exchanged a glance, seemingly a bit hesitant about what choice to make. After a brief silence, Hu Jiao’er said, “Whatever you decide, we’ll go along with.”

They entrusted the decision to Yang Kai.

“Do you want to go?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The sisters nodded simultaneously, Hu Jiao’er saying, “Naturally, I want to see what kind of Sect it is.”

Yang Kai could understand their mood because he was the same. When Yang Kai discovered that Dragon Phoenix Palace had some relation with the inheritance he and Su Yan obtained, his first thought was also to check this Sect out.

Of course, right now, it was partially because it was a huge opportunity for Sun Yu that Yang Kai had striven to build a good relationship with Dragon Phoenix Palace.

“Since you want to go, then let’s go! Perhaps you’ll be able to find others with valuable experiences you can study; on top of that, there will certainly be gains if you go.”

Chen Zhou had guaranteed the character of Wu Fa and Wu Tian, and with the additional layer of protection their status as Yang Kai’s friends provided, the Hu Sisters would not be mistreated if they went to Twin Spirit Pavilion.

On the contrary, Wu Fa and Wu Tian would regard them as precious treasures and treat them as such.
