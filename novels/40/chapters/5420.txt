There didn’t seem to be an end to this vast Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon, so Yang Kai wasn’t even sure if he would have a chance to leave.

Fortunately, being in this Celestial Phenomenon, both he and the sheep headed Royal Lord didn’t dare to activate too much of their strength lest they draw a counterattack to themselves.

In this way, even though the Royal Lord was significantly more powerful than Yang Kai, it was unlikely that he could capture him.

Three years, five years, 10 years… The Human and the Royal Lord were still swimming in this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon with no end in sight.

Yang Kai even suspected that this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon also had the effect of a Bewildering Array; otherwise, he should have left this place after swimming in the same direction for 10 whole years despite his slow movements.

He was initially anxious and fidgety, but he gradually became as calm as a tranquil lake.

His original plan was to make use of this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon to get rid of the Royal Lord and return to the battlefield to fight against the Black Ink Clansmen; however, 10 years had now passed, so the war should already be over.

Who won? Did many Humans lose their lives? Was the Black Ink Giant Spirit God with only half a body killed?

Yang Kai didn’t have the answers to any of those questions. At any rate, since he was in a trap, it was pointless for him to think about those things. The most pressing issue for him was that he had to leave this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon as quickly as possible.

His wounds had all healed after 10 years of recuperation, and he was at peak strength again. On the other hand, the Royal Lord was still wounded as without a Black Ink Nest, it was hard for him to recuperate.

Regardless, Yang Kai was irritated at the fact that the Royal Lord still followed closely behind him.

It wasn’t easy for him to get rid of the other party either. This Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon had significantly restricted their movements, and the Royal Lord was determined to hunt him down. Unless he had a way to kill this Royal Lord, he was helpless to shake him off.

After 10 years of exploration, Yang Kai had figured out more secrets about this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon. As he activated his Demon Eye of Annihilation, his left eye turned golden, allowing him to see through all falsities in the world. In this way, he was looking for a way out of this fog.

The Royal Lord, who was following closely behind him, helplessly discovered that Yang Kai was inconsistent in the ways he moved around. There were no regular patterns to speak of.

Finally, there came a day when Yang Kai suddenly spoke to his partner behind him, “Hey, can I have a word with you?”

The Royal Lord said smugly, “There’s no need to beg for mercy, unless you’re willing to pass me the thing Cang gave you.”

A helpless Yang Kai refuted, “I told you that old man named Cang didn’t give me anything, but you just don’t believe me. Forget it. We’ve been trapped in this Celestial Phenomenon for 10 years, and there isn’t any hope of us getting out if we keep blindly stumbling around. Recently though, I’ve discovered some traces of regular patterns in this fog. Perhaps I’ll be able to find a route to leave this place.”

Instantly, the Royal Lord’s face stiffened as he quickened his pace.

Despite noticing it, Yang Kai was unfazed, “Relax. Given my current ability, it’s unlikely I’ll be able to leave here. Therefore, I need to cultivate for some time. You don’t want to get stuck here forever, do you? If I can find a way out, it’ll be beneficial to you too.”

A myriad of expressions came over the Royal Lord as he wasn’t certain if Yang Kai was telling the truth or not. Nevertheless, Yang Kai had a point; if he could find a way out, both of them would stand to benefit. The Royal Lord was equally vexed being trapped in this damned place.

Even though they both had thousands, if not tens of thousands of years left to live, there would eventually come a day when they passed away if they remained stuck in this place.

“You want to cultivate?”

“Yes.”

“How do I know you won’t seize this chance to break through?”

It was already so hard to deal with Yang Kai when he was just a Seventh-Order Master, if he managed to make it to the Eighth-Order, the Royal Lord wasn’t confident he would ever capture him.

Yang Kai was rendered speechless for a moment, then said, “It has only been several hundred years since I reached the Seventh-Order, how is it possible that I’ll achieve a breakthrough so soon? Don’t worry. I’m just going to cultivate an Eye Secret Technique.”

“Are you being serious with me?” The Royal Lord was doubtful.

“What’s the point of me lying to you in this situation? Moreover, you will certainly be able to tell what I’m doing at this range,” Yang Kai explained, “What do you think? It has come to a point where we have to cooperate if we want to get out of this trap. Why don’t we stop making things difficult for each other?”

After giving it some thought, the Royal Lord nodded, “Good.”

Saying so, he stopped in his tracks.

Yang Kai let out a breath and stopped moving as well. There was nothing he could do if the other party insisted on chasing after him relentlessly. Even though he was still able to cultivate the Eye Secret Technique while moving around, it was far less efficient than if he could sit and focus. Without anyone interrupting him, he could concentrate on doing it.

Not long after the Royal Lord started chasing after him back then, Yang Kai activated the Demon Eye of Annihilation in an attempt to see through the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon’s mysteries.

After 10 years of hard work, he had indeed discovered some patterns in it. What made him feel even more pleasantly surprised was that the Demon Eye of Annihilation showed signs of a breakthrough.

In other words, he was about to achieve a breakthrough with this mastery of this Eye Secret Technique. The Myriad Demons Old Ancestor, who was Yang Kai’s mentor, had told him about it when they were still in the Myriad Demons Pass back then.

At that time, Yang Kai had coughed up a lot of Military Merits to get a chance to ask the Myriad Demons Old Ancestor to teach him the profundities of the two Eye Secret Techniques.

Over the years, Yang Kai had been working hard to improve these Eye Secret Techniques, but he had never had the time to really focus on cultivating them.

All the same, the chance presented itself after he barged into this Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon.

Although the Royal Lord had stopped pursuing him, Yang Kai naturally didn’t fully trust him and kept his guard up while activating his power to run a special cultivation route and improve his Eye Secret Technique. It was a process that required lots of hard work and attention to detail.

Regardless of how powerful a cultivator was or how robust their body was, they still possessed some innate weaknesses, and a person’s eyes were especially fragile.

The reason it was difficult to cultivate the Eye Secret Techniques of Myriad Demons Heaven wasn’t that they were particularly abstruse. On the contrary, it was actually quite easy to start cultivating these two Eye Secret Techniques. One just had to activate their power and run a special cultivation route around their eyes as they continuously improved their vision. As time passed, they would succeed at mastering these Eye Secret Techniques.

What was difficult was the process. The eyes were a weakness to every cultivator. By using one’s own power to train the eyes, they would either yield no results or risk damaging these sensitive organs. If one wasn’t careful enough, their eyes might explode, turning them blind.

It was said that in the early days, there were a lot of blind people in Myriad Demons Heaven because they had cultivated these two Eye Secret Techniques. Then, the high-ranking officials of Myriad Demons Heaven realised they couldn’t let this keep happening; otherwise, all their disciples would become blind. Therefore, they stopped letting ordinary disciples learn these Eye Secret Techniques. Only the brightest disciples had a chance to cultivate these Eye Secret Techniques, and they would have to pass a number of tests before they began.

Unlike the disciples of Myriad Demons Heaven, Yang Kai wasn’t worried about his eyes exploding.

That was because he had inherited his Eye Secret Techniques from Great Demon God, Mo Sheng. He had gotten the hang of the Eye Secret Techniques long ago, but his current problem was that his eyesight wasn’t acute enough. With such a natural advantage, he was far ahead of young disciples from Myriad Demons Heaven when it came to cultivating these Eye Secret Techniques. It could be said that he didn’t have to go through the dangerous initial stage of cultivation at all.

Mo Sheng had built the foundation for him, so he just had to keep on improving and master the Eye Secret Techniques. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

10 years of exploring the Dense Fog Celestial Phenomenon was also a kind of training for Yang Kai; hence, it wasn’t surprising that he was about to achieve a breakthrough with his Demon Eye of Annihilation.

As the Royal Lord watched closely, Yang Kai sat down with his legs crossed and closed his eyes. His aura became completely still as though he was dead.

The Royal Lord’s expression changed as he had the urge to flare up and take Yang Kai’s life; however, as he considered the distance between them and the strangeness of this fog, he knew that even if he made a move now, he wouldn’t be able to achieve his goal.

Moreover, this Seventh-Order Human was certainly still wary of him. If he made a move, the other party wouldn’t just sit idly by; therefore, he could only suppress this urge.

On top of all that, if Yang Kai could really find a way out, the Royal Lord could follow him and leave this place as well. He had the confidence to deal with whatever happened afterwards, which was why he agreed to Yang Kai’s request.

As time passed, following Yang Kai’s activation of power, he felt that his left eye was getting hotter until it became unbearably scorching, as though something was stuck in his eye. Instead of feeling shocked though, he was thrilled. He knew that it was the sign of achieving a breakthrough that the Myriad Demons Old Ancestor had told him about before; therefore, he exerted more force to sharpen his vision.

Half a month later, the feeling of blockage intensified. When it reached a peak, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes. His right eye looked perfectly normal, but his left eye was blood red. His aura undulated and turned into several streams as they crashed into his left eye.

With a solemn expression, the Royal Lord stared fixedly at him.

Although he was able to learn a lot about the Humans through the Black Ink Nest in the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, it wasn’t first-hand information after all. It wasn’t until he witnessed Yang Kai cultivating a Secret Technique that he realised there was a reason why the Black Ink Clan hadn’t managed to defeat the Humans after all these years of war.

While the Royal Lord was lost in his thoughts, Yang Kai started growling like an injured beast.

At the same time, not only did Yang Kai feel that his left eye was scorchingly hot, he also felt as though countless needles had jabbed into his eye. A moment later, there seemed to be innumerable ants that crawled through his body, making him feel limp and numb.

Yang Kai secretly cursed, for the Myriad Demons Old Ancestor had never told him that he would be bothered by all sorts of odd sensations when achieving a breakthrough with this Eye Secret Technique. The average Open Heaven Realm Master could easily bear such disturbance; however, it had come to a critical point where he was trying to achieve a breakthrough and the slightest anomaly could make him suffer cultivation dissonance. When that happened, he wouldn’t only risk failing to achieve the breakthrough, but his eye might also explode.

He withstood the discomfort in his eye and continued to activate his power to sharpen his eyesight. A moment later, a cloud of blood mist billowed from his left eye.

When the Royal Lord saw that, he couldn’t help arching his brow. He wasn’t even sure if he should feel pleased or worried.

He was pleased because there seemed to be something wrong with Yang Kai’s cultivation; otherwise, a cloud of blood mist wouldn’t have appeared from his eye. What he was worried about was that if Yang Kai failed in his attempt, could they still find a way out?

Although the Royal Lord was tremendously more powerful than Yang Kai, that didn’t mean he would be capable of finding a way to get out of this eerie Celestial Phenomenon.

While he was waffling back and forth in his head, Yang Kai suddenly turned to look at him. What came into the Royal Lord’s sight startled him.

He initially thought that Yang Kai’s left eye must have exploded, but at this moment, his eye was still intact. His left eye was no longer filled with redness. Instead, it was radiating a glow. Initially, Yang Kai’s eye was golden after he activated the Demon Eye of Annihilation, but it had turned into something that looked like a cross now.
