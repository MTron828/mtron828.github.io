Kun Sha had a body that was 10,000 metres long, but the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was not far behind. The two giants used their respective Divine Abilities, engaging each other in an intense melee. The ground was shattered and the surrounding space warped. The World Energy in a radius of several tens of thousands of kilometres was thrown into chaos by their battle.

The strength of the two Divine Spirits was almost at the same level and both were living in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary. This should not be the first time they were fighting either as it seemed they understood each other very well and killing moves were unleashed incessantly, sending chills down the spines of those who stood witness.

But after watching for a while, Yang Kai realized that Kun Sha was most likely not the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s opponent. Just as the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider said, Kun Sha was a Divine Spirit born from the sea. She may not be his opponent if they were fighting in the depths of the ocean, but she had the upper hand on land.

Threads of spider silk that were strong enough to seal the world were gradually woven into a web. Even someone as strong as Kun Sha could not extricate himself from it. It seemed that Kun Sha would be completely defeated the moment the spider web was fully formed.

Kun Sha obviously realized this as well. Shaking his head, he opened his big bloody mouth and bit down on a weak point, tearing apart tens of thousands of spider threads. Then, he turned back to human form and rushed out of the gap, fleeing quickly.

His voice echoed from afar, “Zhu Jiu Yin, don’t feel smug just because you have beaten me today! We will cross paths again at the Spirit Seizing War! When the time comes, let’s see who will have the last laugh!”

The Heavenly Moon Demon Spider did not stop him when she saw him leave. Her huge spider body distorted and transformed, turning back into the harmless innocent girl from before. Standing with her hands behind her back, she gazed into the distance.

A hundred or so kilometres away, in the middle of a spider web, Yang Kai and the others watched on in horror.

The unrestrained might of the two Divine Spirits was beyond their imagination. Even in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary, they could exert strength surpassing that of the Low-Rank Open Heaven Realm, which may have something to do with the fact that they were born here, but also the fact that their strength itself was incredible.

But no matter what, the might of a Divine Spirit was unstoppable!

The girl turned around and arrived in front of Yang Kai and the others in a few hops. She studied Yang Kai with a smile, a scrutinizing look present in her beautiful eyes, looking ever more satisfied as if she were a maiden, looking at her lover.

Yang Kai felt his scalp tingle as he decided to ask, “Senior, what do you want from me?”

The girl smiled, “Don’t worry, I won’t kill you, nor will I let someone else kill you. You are very useful to me, but this is not the place to talk. Let’s go back first.”

Raising her hand, she retrieved her web. Yang Kai and the others regained their freedom, but they did not even think of escaping as in front of an existence of this level, that would be foolish. They could only follow behind her obediently as they headed back to the Star City.

Hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, Kun Sha suddenly stopped with a furious look on his face, “How dare that bitch spoil my good deed! Now that that cheap slut Zhu Jiu Yin has her eyes on that stinking brat, I won’t be able to get my hands on him... Hm, I wonder if that other brat is dead yet.”

Saying so, he spat something out of his mouth.

It was none other than Lin Feng whom he had swallowed up before.

“Hm, you’re still alive? Good. At least you have some ability!” Kun Sha’s eyes lit up. He discovered that though the brat named Lin Feng was pale-faced, he was completely unharmed. Only, the light golden layer protecting him had been corroded by digestive juices and could break at any moment.

Lin Feng himself obviously did not have the ability to withstand the corrosive power of Kun Sha’s gastric juices, so he must have used one of the treasures given by his Elders to save his life.

Suddenly released, Lin Feng gasped and coughed heavily.

Before he could recover from his shock though, he heard Kun Sha’s mighty voice, “Boy, you’ve passed this King’s test. You are now qualified to become this King’s Bearer. Over the next few years, this King will carefully nurture you. Then, you must do one thing for this King. If you do it well, you will be spared. If not, then obediently become food for this King.”

Lin Feng looked up and stared blankly at him. His mind was still blank from surviving that previous encounter, even to the point where he could not process what Kun Sha was saying to him.

But Kun Sha didn’t care. He simply grabbed Ling Feng by the collar and carried him to the sea.

In the main hall of Yang Kai’s residence, the girl wandered about, touching this and that, as if everything was novel to her.

Yang Kai and the others stood at the entrance, not even daring to breathe loudly.

Even though this Heavenly Moon Demon Spider said before that she would not kill him, who knows whether this devilish woman would actually keep her word? If she really made a move, then no one would be able to resist.

Chen Yue suddenly ran in from outside and said in a small voice, “Sir, Scarlet Star’s Managers have come seeking an audience.”

Everyone was watching as the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider led Yang Kai back to the Star City, so how could Chen Tian Fei and the others sit still when something so terrifying suddenly appeared in their home? Naturally, they had to rush over to pay their respects.

Yang Kai raised his head to look at the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider.

The girl waved her hand, “Make them leave.” She looked extremely impatient.

Chen Yue shrunk her neck and excused herself respectfully.

The girl finally stopped moving and turned her head to look at Yang Kai with a smile, “Where is Da Lang’s corpse?”

“Da Lang?” Yang Kai was stunned, [What Da Lang? Where Da Lang?]

“You killed him, didn’t you?” The girl asked.

Yang Kai suddenly realized who she was talking about and quickly raised his hand to summon a headless corpse. It was the mantis head that he had killed two years ago at Sword Pavilion’s Star City. Only, this guy’s head was blown apart by the Azure Dragon Spear, leaving his body behind.

Since this Monster’s strength was not weak, and both his scythe arms were rigid and sharp, they were great materials for refining artifacts. For that reason, Yang Kai kept the body this whole time.

“Da Lang followed me for many years, and I was the one who taught him how to gain sentience. Though he has died, I still wish to retrieve his body. You have no complaints about that, do you?” The girl asked Yang Kai.

“This one would not dare!” Yang Kai dropped his gaze. He dared not say a single ‘no’ to her at this moment.

The girl nodded. Raising her hand, she put away the mantis head’s body. Turning around, she sat down on the seat that used to belong to Yang Kai, crossing her legs and propping her cheek up with her hand, saying lazily, “This Queen is Zhu Jiu Yin. You have already seen what my true form is.”

“Greetings, Senior Zhu!” Yang Kai quickly bowed while shooting a look at Lu Xue and the others.

In his mind, he wondered. Was this woman surnamed Zhu because she was the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider?

The girl giggled and stared at Yang Kai, “This Queen has come out of the mountain this time just to see you.”

With those words, Yue He immediately turned her head to look warily at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was curious, “Does Senior know me?”

“Not before, but I do now,” Zhu Jiu Yin smirked.

Yang Kai frowned, “What did Senior seek me out for? If it is to avenge Da Lang, then Senior should have taken revenge long ago.”

“Naturally, it is not for Da Lang; otherwise, would you still be alive? This Queen came in order to seek your help. If you do this Queen this favour, then I will forget about you killing Da Lang. Otherwise, I will have to settle this score with you properly.”

Yang Kai was speechless, “What kind of help does Senior need from me?” If even she herself could not do it, would he be able to?

“You will naturally know when it is time. It is useless even if you know now. For the moment, all you have to do is improve your strength as fast and as much as possible. I will live here before you help me with this favour, so don’t even think about running away.” Zhu Jiu Yin turned to look at Yue He and Lu Xue, “The two of you, follow me. This Queen needs maidservants to call upon.”

Yue He was furious!

She was in the Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, but she was actually being taken as a maidservant! However, when she thought of Zhu Jiu Yin’s identity and strength, she was indeed qualified to treat her as a maid. If such an existence were to reach the outside world, she would definitely be on par with a High-Rank Open Heaven Realm Master.

Zhu Jiu Yen then really began living in the mansion that day, and she chose the best room for herself, which should’ve been Yang Kai’s.

She had nothing to do during her days here, so she would take Yue He and Lu Xue along with her as she browsed the Star City, buying many miscellaneous trinkets, which made the two speechless. She was the Divine Spirit Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, but even though she was so strong, she still could not help but be curious about this lively world.

Yang Kai was deeply confused. This woman only told him that she needed his help, but she did not say what sort of help she needed, only that he would understand when the time came.

But since it was a request from the Divine Spirit, it must be very important. Yang Kai could only further intensify his cultivation.

Unfortunately, even the cleverest woman could not cook a meal without rice. For the Yin, Yang and Five Elements in his Dao Seal, he was still stuck on the Metal Element. With no suitable Metal Element material to refine, he had no way of furthering the cultivation of his Dao Seal. He did have a Water Element material in his possession, but without first refining his Metal Element, it was simply impossible for him to refine the Water Element.

He could only strengthen his body physically each day by consuming Dragon Blood Pills and refining his Bloodline Power. Then, gain further insight into his Wood and Earth Powers.

A few days later, Yang Kai suddenly took out a communication bead and immersed his consciousness into it. Overjoyed, he asked, “Brother Xu, are you alright?”

The communication bead was his link to Xu Zhen. He had lost contact with Xu Zhen last time, which worried Yang Kai. He had no idea whether he was dead or alive, but he did not expect Xu Zhen to take the initiative to contact him today.

“Not dead yet, but not in a good situation either!” Xu Zhen responded.

“What happened? First of all, why did you go silent all of a sudden? Where’s everyone else?”

“The rest are fine for now, but obviously, it may not be so in the future. Brother Yang, you should also make plans early. You have been showing off your strength too much, so you will eventually catch their attention.”

“What do you mean by that?” Yang Kai was confused, “and catch the attention of who?”

Xu Zhen said, “Has Brother Yang heard of a Bearer before?”

“No, I haven’t.”

Xu Zhen went on, “I saw some records in my ancestors’ ancient books and didn’t take them seriously, but now, I know they are real. Kun Sha is not the only Divine Spirit in the Grand Ancient Ruins Boundary.”

Yang Kai laughed dryly, “That I know.”

Xu Zhen was surprised, “How do you know that? Did you encounter one?”

Yang Kai said with a headache, “Not only have I met one, but I have one living in my mansion!”

Xu Zhen did not respond for a long time. Yang Kai thought that something had happened to him, so he quickly transmitted a message. Only then did Xu Zhen respond, “As I thought, you’ve caught their eye, Brother Yang. In that case, I can just explain it to you. Did the Divine Spirit on your side ask you for a favour?”

Yang Kai was surprised, “How does Brother Xu know about that?”

Xu Zhen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “Because I am in the same position. We really are Brothers sharing the same fate.”
