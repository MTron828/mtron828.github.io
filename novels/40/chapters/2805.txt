As the saying went ‘food was the most important thing in life’, that was an unchanging principle. During the ancient times, being able to eat until they burst was definitely the most luxurious enjoyment one could have.

The Ancient Barbarian Race’s cooking methods were extremely simple, meat was roasted. They skewered large chunks of the beasts’ meat on wooden poles, set up bonfires everywhere in the village, and grilled the meat over the fire. The golden colour and the crackling grease of the meat whet one’s appetite greatly.

Even though they had obtained the meat yesterday, the entire village, including the Village Chief, had not taken a single bite out of it. That was because they had been waiting for the hero to return! Now that Ah Niu had returned, it was naturally time to celebrate.

The smell of barbeque soon drifted across the entire village. They did not use any complicated condiments and simply grabbed the meat with their bare hands, tore into it with large bites, and swallowed it. Some of the meat was still bloody and slightly undercooked, but even so, the villagers couldn’t care less as they ate the meat with gusto.

Meanwhile, the fattiest cut of the meat from the beasts was placed in front of Yang Kai. This treatment was not even enjoyed by the most respected Village Chief. This was because Yang Kai was the one that contributed the most to repelling the Beast Tide and slaying the Barbarian Beast, so it was only natural for him to receive the best treatment.

Yang Kai originally planned to casually respond to their treatment; after all, it didn’t matter even if he didn’t eat anything with his current cultivation. However, a gurgling sound came from his stomach when the smell of the barbecue entered his nose, stunning him greatly.

[I actually… feel hungry?! How is that possible? I’m an Emperor Realm Master!] Yang Kai no longer needed to eat anything, and under normal circumstances, it would be enough for him to simply absorb ambient World Energy to replenish his body’s needs. Yet, he actually felt hungry in this strange place! On top of that, he was even feeling fatigued.

[How is this world so realistic?!] He couldn’t ponder over it deeply. Affected by the villagers, he reached out to grab the cooked meat and wolfed it down.

The village women took out preserved dried vegetables, and the Village Chief also ordered for the sealed fruit wine to be fetched. The whole village was filled with an extremely lively and festive atmosphere. Even so, they did not neglect their defences and remained vigilant of their surroundings outside the village just in case the smell of barbeque attracted wild beasts to them.

The celebration lasted a whole day.

Yang Kai didn’t know how much he ate or how much fruit wine he drank, but in the end, he became faintly drunk. Staggering back to the log house where he lived, he immediately fell onto his bed.

At that moment, he noticed somebody entering his log house in his dazed state.

Despite being weary and drunk, he was still an Emperor Realm Master, so he opened his eyes immediately and shouted, “Who?!”

Just as the words left his mouth, he felt a scalding hot body slipping under his blanket made of animal skins. Subsequently, an arm reached out to hug his waist and a head buried itself in his chest. Furthermore, a delicate fragrance entered his nose while strands of messy long hair tickled his face. There was no hostility, but the person lying in his arms seemed to be breathing rather heavily and trembling slightly.

Yang Kai snapped awake instantly and tilted his head back. With the help of the dim moonlight coming in from outside his window, he finally saw the appearance of the person lying in his arms.

“Why are you here?!” Yang Kai stared at the young girl in astonishment. It was the tall girl who had served him the bowl of Sacred Wine when he returned yesterday. Her soft and warm body in his arms made him become more and more aware of an amazing elasticity pressing up against him.

“Brother Ah Niu…” the young girl murmured. She lifted her head and looked into his eyes. Despite her shyness, she made a bold gesture and pouted her red lips, making her look extremely seductive.

Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling dazed and subconsciously asked, “What are you doing here?”

As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew he had asked a stupid question. This girl had already given such obvious signals, so what else could she be trying to do? Sure enough, the young girl whispered, “Brother Ah Niu, Ah Ni turns fifteen years old today…”

She did not provide a thorough explanation, but even so, Yang Kai could vaguely guess what it meant for a girl from the Ancient Barbarian Race to turn fifteen years old. It probably meant that she was now an adult and a full-fledged woman! One should be given an amazing birthday gift on their fifteenth birthday. Moreover, it was her decision to dedicate herself to the best warrior in the village.

Upon realizing this, Yang Kai immediately felt awkward. If this had been the real world, it would have still been acceptable. The Ancient Barbarian Race was known to be very open to these kinds of things and they were not as rigid and conservative as ordinary present-day women. This would be considered nothing more than a love affair, and nobody lost anything from it.

Unfortunately, this place was a Sealed World! Even now, Yang Kai couldn’t figure out whether this place was real or just an elaborate illusion. If it was the latter, then what was the point of doing this? If he were to do such a thing with an illusion, what difference would that be from pleasuring himself?!

Just as he was mulling over this, the young girl arched back slightly and pressed her fiery body against his skin, as if trying to melt him with her heat. Lifting her head slightly, she whispered into his ear, “Brother Ah Niu, do you like Ah Ni?”

Deciding to bite the bullet, Yang Kai replied, “Of course I do!”

The desire for beauties was universal, to say nothing of such a pure and beautiful ancient-styled young girl. Ah Ni smiled brightly and, flipping up, she sat on his body, lifted her hands, and pulled at something. The simple animal skin top that she was wearing instantly came off, and under the pale moonlight, her perfect curves were clearly displayed before him.

Yang Kai suddenly felt as if he was about to suffer from a nosebleed.

How many years had it been… How many years was it since he last felt a woman’s skin? Yang Kai had remained abstinent ever since he left Heng Luo Star Field, so faced with such a stimulating scene, he felt incredibly overwhelmed even though his mental discipline was incredibly strong.

“Wait! Wait…” He hastily spoke up.

“What is it?” She glanced at him curiously.

Thinking on his feet, Yang Kai swallowed and said, “I’m injured! I’ve been severely injured!”

She covered her mouth with her hands, seemingly surprised by his words. She worriedly asked, “Is it serious?”

Yang Kai awkwardly replied as he glanced away, “It’s not that serious…”

“Then, it’s fine,” Upon hearing those words, she reached out to take off his clothes; however, Yang Kai gripped his clothes tightly, feeling extremely conflicted inside as he said, “Ah Ni, please don’t be rash!”

Pausing in her actions, she looked at him a little incredulously, “Brother Ah Niu, do you hate me?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Of course not!” He hurriedly denied.

“Then, why…” She pursed her lips lightly, feeling as if she had received a direct blow from a giant beast and suffered great damage as a result.

“I just feel that we should be more cautious about these kinds of things!” He replied solemnly.

Ah Ni looked at Yang Kai earnestly. After a long while, she turned around and grabbed her clothes that had been thrown aside. Flipping her body, she got up from his body and ran out the door with tears in her eyes.

“Ah Ni…” Yang Kai shouted after her. Even so, how could he possibly receive a response from her? All of a sudden, he felt lost as if he had a huge and empty void in his chest.

He had completely sobered up after Ah Ni pulled this little stunt on him. Thus, he decided to get up and sit cross-legged on the bed. His thoughts were a mess, and it took quite a while for him to calm down and consider how he should proceed in this Sealed World.

This strange place completely suppressed and sealed his Emperor Qi as soon as he had entered. All he could rely on here was the power of his body. When hunting down the Barbarian Beast from before, Yang Kai had tried to mobilize his Spiritual Energy, but he quickly discovered that both his Spiritual Energy and Emperor Qi had been sealed. He could not sense even the slightest trace of them.

[There were only five days before the one-month period ended when I entered the fifth layer, and I’ve been in this village for two days, so I only have three more days before I have to leave the Five Coloured Treasure Pagoda. What can I get from this Sealed World within three days? No matter how I look at it, what can this dilapidated old village give me? At my peak I could wipe out several of these villages with a sneeze!]

Subconsciously Yang Kai circulated his Secret Art and was immediately stunned by what he discovered. He could feel a trace of power circulating in his meridians! Although it was very weak, so weak that it was practically non-existent, it was definitely Emperor Qi.

[Why did my Emperor Qi suddenly reappear?] Yang Kai frowned. Then, he suddenly remembered that when he had just returned from slaying the Monster Beast today, he drank a bowl of Sacred Wine. After that, he vaguely felt an abnormality in his meridians. Yang Kai was just about to check on the abnormality, but unfortunately, the villagers’ enthusiasm had interrupted him.

[Is it because of that bowl of wine?] Yang Kai also drank some alcohol during the celebration banquet today, but it did not have the same effects as the bowl of wine Ah Ni had served to him before. [That bowl of wine Ah Ni served to me must have been specially handed to her by the Village Chief.]

This discovery made Yang Kai a little overjoyed. [That bowl of murky wine made my meridians produce some Emperor Qi, so what if I get more of it? Is it possible for me to restore some of my strength? Maybe even restore my power to its peak?]

Yang Kai couldn’t wait to go to the Village Chief and ask for more of that wine to confirm his suspicions. Even though he had yet to meet with any danger since entering this Sealed World, he couldn’t help wanting to take precautions; after all, Shamans existed in this ancient era, and a powerful Shaman was nothing like the old Village Chief; they were masters not inferior to the present-day cultivators.

Turning his head to look out the window, Yang Kai saw the moonlight shining brightly outside and sighed. [Everything can only wait until tomorrow. I wonder when I’ll fall back asleep again.]

At dawn the next day, Yang Kai woke up at first light and walked out of his log house. Many villagers were already up and working, but when they saw him, they looked respectful and nodded at him lightly. However, the moment they turned around, they also chuckled softly. Some of them even gathered together and pointed in his direction. If it had been only one or two, it would not have mattered. Unfortunately, all the villagers he met reacted the same way, making it difficult for Yang Kai to even ask them where the Village Chief’s house was.

[What’s going on?] He was utterly bewildered.

“I heard that Ah Ni went to your house last night and came out very quickly.” Ah Hu asked with a sly smile, appearing out of nowhere and wrapping his arm around his shoulders.

Yang Kai was shocked and asked, “How did you know?”

Ah Hu chuckled non-stop and pointed with his hand, “Everybody knows.”

Yang Kai suddenly felt exasperated. No wonder the villagers were acting so strange. It turned out it was because of this…

“How did everybody find out?” Yang Kai looked embarrassed. Although he was not too bothered, he did not know whether it would compromise Ah Ni’s reputation; after all, the village was not that big. If news about this got out, it would surely become public knowledge.

Ah Hu explained, “The night watch saw.” Then, he immediately leaned over and acted as if he was trying to be mysterious. He asked in a whisper, “Are you… incapable of doing it?”

“You’re the incapable one!” Yang Kai became livid. In response, Ah Hu burst into laughter.
