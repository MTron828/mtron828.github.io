Chapter 5535: Six Arms

After moving forward for a while longer, Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand and exuded his might just as those Fifth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters could no longer resist the Territory Lords’ might.

At that instant, the terrifying pressure was like snow meeting the sun, gently melting away.

This foray to the Black Ink Clan’s base camp was not only about passing through the Black Ink Clan’s territory, but also a type of message. Therefore, Yang Kai didn’t activate the protective measures on Dawning Light, leaving it in a completely exposed state.

Seeing Yang Kai easily ward off the Territory Lords’ pressure, the Humans became even more motivated and chanted even louder.

Meanwhile, the Territory Lords all looked gloomy. [That Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master is indeed too powerful, no wonder he was able to escape from the Royal Lord’s grasp.]

Dawning Light continued to move forward and stopped just 3 million kilometres away from the Black Ink Clan Army.

To powerful Innate Territory Lords and Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master, such a distance could already be considered meeting each other face-to-face because they were within striking distance of ordinary Secret Techniques. Any sudden movement from either side could set off a great battle between the two clans.

During all of the previous clashes, there hadn’t been anyone brave enough to take such actions when both armies were facing each other because it was equivalent to courting death. If the Humans had provoked the Black Ink Clan to this extent, the Black Ink Clan wouldn’t have endured it and would have simply attacked.

But now, even when Dawning Light was sitting alone right in front of the Black Ink Clan Army, the Black Ink Clan still didn’t move.

Meanwhile, all the members aboard Dawning Light were nervous and excited.

If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have dared to believe that one man could deter the entire Black Ink Clan alone.

The cultivator surnamed Hou was even more shocked. He was a new member who had joined Dawn only a few decades ago and had heard many anecdotes about Yang Kai from Shen Ao. He used to think that the latter was exaggerating, but after following Yang Kai here, he discovered that all those stories were real!

Not only was the man surnamed Hou excited, but Shen Ao and the other veteran members of Dawn were also elated. Every one of them was smiling and had rosy cheeks.

During the battle at the Primordial Heavens Source Grand Restriction, Yang Kai disappeared while many members of Dawn were either injured or killed. Later, Dawn almost fractured under the weight of their losses in the following wars. Although new members were joining in, it was difficult for Dawn to return to its former glory.

That was because Dawn lacked a leader.

Now, their leader had returned. This was their first mission, and the first thing Yang Kai did was lead Dawn to stand before the entire Black Ink Clan Army. Under the gazes of both clans, Shen Ao and the others didn’t feel scared but excited, feeling like they had returned to the days when they followed their Squad Leader, Yang Kai, to kill the enemy!

The chants continued to shake the void while both the Black Ink Clan and Human Race Army faced off with Dawning Light anchored between them.

This scene was meant to be written down in history books, destined to be remembered by all who witnessed it today.

Yang Kai raised his hand slightly and signalled the Humans to quiet down.

It was only then that the continuous chants finally ceased.

Then, Yang Kai strode forward on the deck and looked at the Territory Lords who were before him with a smile on his face, “Is there a Commander among you all?”

The Territory Lords either looked gloomy or ghastly pale, but none of them spoke.

While raising an eyebrow, Yang Kai asked, “What’s wrong? Every one of you is a powerful Innate Territory Lord, so you can’t be afraid of me, right? If that is true, you should just return to your Source Domain as there’s no need to embarrass yourselves here.”

The Territory Lords naturally couldn’t stand such provocative words and immediately began cursing Yang Kai from all directions.

However, Yang Kai turned a deaf ear and looked around, sneering, “I will remember all of you who cursed at me. You will be the ones I deal with first!”

Immediately, the roars of indignation and curses stopped. If another Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master had made such a threat, the Territory Lords wouldn’t have taken it to heart because they weren’t wary of Eighth-Order Humans in general.

But Yang Kai’s record of killing three Territory Lords was still fresh in their minds, so they didn’t dare to ignore his threats.

The war between the Human Race and the Black Ink Clan was ongoing, so if any one of those Territory Lords found themselves alone while being targeted by Yang Kai, they would almost certainly die.

It was also impossible for them to always move together; therefore, the Black Ink Clan’s already weak momentum was dampened even further with just a few words from Yang Kai.

Only then did one Territory Lord with several long arms step forward from the crowd. There was a straight-almond-shaped mark on his forehead, making him look quite strange.

He was originally unwilling to speak with Yang Kai because he knew and had experienced how cunning Humans could be. His way of thinking was simple, when dealing with Humans, it was best to just kill them!

No matter what the Humans said or did, the solution to any matter was to fight.

But if he didn’t come forward now, the situation would only worsen.

Yang Kai looked over and observed the Territory Lord, especially the almond-shaped mark on his forehead, he thought, [That mark isn’t just some kind of decoration, it carries some sort of powerful means.]

“Six Arms!” Back where the Human Race Army stood, Ou Yang Lie snorted coldly.

He had been battling the Black Ink Clan in Profound Nether Territory for a couple dozen years now, so he knew quite a lot about the Black Ink Clan’s Masters here. Though Innate Territory Lords were stronger than ordinary Territory Lords, there were still differences between them, possibly related to how much of Mo’s Source Qi they possessed.

Innate Territory Lords were spawned directly from Black Ink Nests using Mo’s Source Qi; therefore, the more Source Qi used, the stronger that Territory Lord was.

Six Arms was the strongest Territory Lord in Profound Nether Territory and had severely injured Ou Yang Lie during their last battle.

Although Ou Yang Lie kept bragging to Wei Jun Yang that he had also caused significant injuries to his opponent, the truth was that Ou Yang Lie’s wounds were much more severe because while Six Arms was only slightly injured, Ou Yang Lie almost lost half his life.

Xiang Shan had previously snuck into Profound Nether Territory and launched a sneak attack on Six Arms while the Human Race and Black Ink Clan Armies were locked in combat, but was unsuccessful.

Even Xiang Shan couldn’t deal with Six Arms with the element of surprise on his side, which showed how hard it was to deal with this fellow.

Hence, Six Arms was indeed the Territory Lord who could command the Black Ink Clan in Profound Nether Territory.

Ou Yang Lie quickly informed Yang Kai about Six Arms.

On the other hand, Yang Kai’s brow rose slightly. To be able to survive Xiang Shan’s sneak attack meant that this Territory Lord called Six Arms was indeed impressive. If Yang Kai were to compete with Six Arms in terms of pure strength, he might not come out as the winner as it hadn’t been long since Yang Kai advanced to the Eighth Order, meaning his heritage was still somewhat weak.

However, Yang Kai’s biggest advantage when killing Territory Lords now was his Soul Rending Thorns, so if it was he who made the sneak attack, he might have succeeded in killing Six Arms.

While Yang Kai was observing Six Arms, Six Arms was also observing him. Six Arms had received footage of Yang Kai’s attacks on the No-Return Pass and was sure that the Human before him was the one who caused all that chaos. Not only did this Human kill three Territory Lords, but he also destroyed seven High-Rank Black Ink Nest.

Six Arms felt his heart sink as he didn’t dare to belittle Yang Kai, eventually opening his mouth to shout, “Human, who gave you the guts to provoke us?”

Looking around, Yang Kai smiled, “This King came here with only one Warship to discuss some matters with you. Does this count as a provocation?”

Yang Kai touched his chin and nodded gently, “If you think it is, then so be it. What can all of you do about it? If you want to attack, go ahead. See if this King doesn’t beat you senseless.”

While saying that, Yang Kai had his nose pointed upwards, looking incredibly arrogant.

The Territory Lords were furious, and Six Arms also looked grim after hearing these words. During the years they had battled the Humans, they had never been in a disadvantageous position; however, they didn’t expect that the momentum they accumulated for so many years would be smashed by a single Eighth-Order Open Heaven Realm Master aboard a lone Warship.

This Human only had one Warship with him, but the Black Ink Clan was acting like they were facing a powerful enemy. Their behaviour was indeed quite embarrassing.

Seeing the Humans’ side’s spirits rising even further, Six Arms didn’t dare to continue this topic and snorted coldly, “The Black Ink Clan has previously experienced the Human Race’s sharp tongue, so let’s get straight to the point. If you Humans want to start a war, the Black Ink Clan will gladly accompany you.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Good, let’s get straight to the point. I came here today with only the intention of discussing something with you all, not to start a fight. Your side suffered quite a huge loss after the last battle, so you should take some time to recuperate. We Humans have always been generous and would never bully the weak just because we’re strong.”

Meanwhile, Six Arms looked at Yang Kai with a blank expression, thinking that Yang Kai was talking nonsense.

[They don’t want to start a battle? The Human Race Army is already at our doorstep. How can that not be counted as wanting to start a war?]

If the Humans didn’t want to start a battle, the Human Race Army wouldn’t be standing here.

Moreover, the situation in Profound Nether Territory today was that the Humans were weaker than the Black Ink Clan; therefore, Six Arms didn’t know where this Eighth-Order Master found the courage to say that the Humans wouldn’t bully the weak.

Shameless as well as arrogant!

That was the first impression Six Arms had about Yang Kai.

“What do you want to discuss?” Six Arms asked, “If you want the Black Ink Clan to retreat, that is not up for discussion.”

Shaking his head, Yang Kai replied, “I naturally wouldn’t ask you to retreat. The Black Ink Clan in Profound Nether Territory have killed so many of my fellow comrades, so who would I seek revenge on if you guys ran away? No, no, you must stay and not leave so that someday, the Profound Nether Army can kill all of you!”

Six Arms frowned, “If you came here just to taunt us, I don’t see the need to continue this conversation.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yang Kai chuckled and cupped his fists, “My apologies. My murderous intent was provoked by your words and I’ve forgotten my original intentions. This King came here today to ask that you grant us easement.”

“Grant easement?” Six Arms looked confused, “What do you mean?”

[Grant what easement? Does the Black Ink Clan have an easement to grant?]

Not only was Six Arms baffled, but the Humans were also confused.

As this was a decision made after private discussion, only a few higher-ups knew the whole story while the ordinary soldiers had no information at all. Moreover, the news of Yang Kai being appointed as the Army Commander of the Profound Nether Army hadn’t been released yet either.

Just as they were feeling confused, they heard Yang Kai continue, “I want to leave Profound Nether Territory… through that portal!”

While saying so, Yang Kai pointed at the Territory Gate behind the Black Ink Clan’s base camp.

Once he said that, both the Humans and Black Ink Clan were shocked and finally realised what Yang Kai was referring to when asking to be granted an easement.

They were purely asking for easement because that Territory Gate was under the Black Ink Clan’s control, so if the Black Ink Clan was reluctant to let them pass, it would be difficult for Yang Kai to get past, no matter how strong he was.

However, many were dazedly looking at Yang Kai while secretly exclaiming, [Has he gone mad? How can he discuss such a thing with the Black Ink Clan? Isn’t this the same as humiliating them? If the Black Ink Clan are determined not to yield, it would be impossible for them to agree to this.]

In fact, there were signs of a riot building among the Black Ink Clan Army already. If it hadn’t been for the Territory Lords and Feudal Lords stopping them, the Black Ink Clan soldiers would have already charged at Yang Kai to rip him apart.
