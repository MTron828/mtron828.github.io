[They dare act so arrogant and domineering when they have nothing to do with any of the Great Emperors?!] Hua Xing’s expression turned cold instantly.

While those two were talking to each other, Yang Kai was admonishing Lin Yun’er, “Didn’t we agree to launch a sneak attack together? Why did you attack the instant we got inside?”

Lin Yun’er scratched her head before spitting out her tongue, “I forgot.”

Yang Kai sighed, “This is just great. Now that you have acted rashly and alerted the enemy to our plans, it won’t be easy for us to take him down anymore.”

“Then, what should we do now?” She looked at him with a rather innocent expression. She, too, realized that Hua Xing was a tough opponent when she fought him just now. Ever since she came to Star Boundary, she had been cultivating in retreat with her Master, and all her battles so far were one-sided tramplings. It could be said that this was her first true battle in many years.

It wasn’t until she ran away from home recently that she discovered that most people in the outside world weren’t very strong. They couldn’t take her attacks and often died in just one or two punches. Hence, she had assumed that everybody in the world was like that; however, Hua Xing’s performance had broadened her horizons and made her aware that there were still other powerful people in this world.

“What else can we do? We’ll just have to push through by force,” Yang Kai shrugged.

Understanding the meaning behind his words, she nodded in agreement, “I see. Then, let’s kill him together.”

She spoke matter-of-factly as if victory was certain, so when Hua Xing heard those words, he was absolutely livid, “Impudence! I wasn’t going to stoop down to your level, but you just had to walk right into the fire yourselves! Good! Good! Good! Today, this place will be your grave!”

Since these two had nothing to do with the Great Emperors, Hua Xing became bold and felt that he had been overly cautious before. Youngsters were always hot-blooded. Wasn’t he the same when he was younger? It’s always the newborn calves that are not afraid of tigers. They would forge ahead thinking that they are indomitable, even if the road before them is covered in thorns. It’s only when they grew older that they became overly suspicious. Not every youngster comes from a powerful background.

Hua Xing secretly vowed fiercely in his heart, [Today, I’m going to show them their place!]

Gritting his teeth, he looked at Li Jiao and warned, “Brother Li, we can still be friends if you leave right now.”

He was not worried about the two young ones, but he was worried about Li Jiao; after all, the latter was a Dragonborn and stronger than himself.

“I don’t have a friend as deceitful as you!” Li Jiao retorted unceremoniously, filled with resentment.

Hua Xing sighed in response, “If that’s the case, I have nothing else to say.”

Lifting a hand into the air, Hua Xing shouted, “Kill!”

As soon as the word left his mouth, he took the lead to attack. The cyan sword once again transformed into a phantom form that covered the entire sky. At the same time, the Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples nearby also attacked in unison. Various artifacts flew out and Secret Techniques flashed brilliantly, enveloping the trio in an instant.

“Palace Master Yang, I will keep that old dog busy, please lend me a hand once you’re done dealing with the other rabble!” Li Jiao shouted.

Reaching one hand into the void, an ancient scroll immediately appeared in his hand. The scroll unfurled quickly, emitting blasts of dazzling light from within as it guarded against the attacks from their surroundings. It was an impenetrable defence.

With a loud rumble, Li Jiao completely blocked all the attacks aimed at them before he flickered and lunged towards Hua Xing.

Hua Xing shouted angrily, “You! Shameless!”

His rage was driving him crazy. He had been very hospitable to Li Jiao when he arrived at Wind and Cloud Pavilion, not only providing him with good food and wine, but also with many beauties for a pleasurable indulgence! He couldn’t believe Li Jiao would so easily and completely betray him at this moment.

Hua Xing held a deep grudge in his heart and immediately engaged Li Jiao in battle. As the two Third-Order Emperor Realm Masters put their lives on the line, their fight turned into a grand-scale battle that began cracking space around them while throwing the surrounding World Energy into chaos.

While those two were fighting each other, the rest of the Wind and Cloud Pavilion’ disciples did not remain idle. They relied on their overwhelming numbers to launch devastating waves of attacks at Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er. Unfortunately, the effects of their assault were minimal. Most of these cultivators were only in the Dao Source Realm, and they were no match for those two.

When the attacks rained down on Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er, they each moved in opposite directions and vanished from where they stood. None of the attacks landed on their targets as a result.

Immediately after that, bone-chilling screams rang out as one after another Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples exploded into a fine blood mist. More than forty people died tragically on the spot in just ten breaths. Consequently, the rest of the disciples turned pale with shock and their eyes were filled with absolute horror and terror.

They initially thought that Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er would not be overwhelmingly strong even though both of them were in the Emperor Realm. Their First-Order auras were on full display for all to see, but after actually clashing with those two, those disciples realized how mistaken they were. These two were slaughterers! Nobody could stand against them, and Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples dropped like flies wherever those two went.

[How do we fight these monsters?!] The surviving disciples no longer had the courage to resist and wanted nothing more than to run as far as possible. At that moment, several whooshing sounds came from afar.

The Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s disciples were overjoyed at the sight, “The Great Elder is here!”

“The other Elders are here too!”

“There are also some Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters!”

“Please save us, Elders!”

The surviving disciples started shouting all at once, watching the Great Elder of Wind and Cloud Pavilion flying in this direction as if their saviour had come to rescue them.

Wind and Cloud Pavilion was one of the top Sects in the Western Territory, and aside from Hua Xing, who was a Third-Order Emperor, there were two other Second-Order Emperors and almost a dozen First-Order Emperors in the Sect. Such a heritage was unbelievably powerful.

The two Second-Order Emperors were seated as the Great Elder and the Second Elder respectively. Unfortunately, the Second Elder was killed in Great Cloud City previously, causing Wind and Cloud Pavilion’s overall strength to drop noticeably.

Having received a message from Hua Xing, the Great Elder brought all the forces he could muster here with him. Hundreds followed behind him, with even the weakest among them being a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master. They were clearly the complete elites of Wind and Cloud Pavilion.

It had been a long time since Wind and Cloud Pavilion brought out its full power to deal with an enemy; however, the situation was too dangerous at the moment. They would not have any chance of winning this battle if they did not go all out.

The Great Elder flew over with his sleeves fluttering in the wind. He had witnessed the Sect’s disciples being slaughtered from a distance and was instantly enraged as he roared, “Stop this instant!”

While speaking, a simple but ancient-looking sword appeared in his hand. His Emperor Qi surged as he slashed at Yang Kai. That attack was shockingly powerful and Sword Intent covered the sky, causing one’s skin to crawl.

The sword light slashed through Yang Kai’s body with unparalleled precision and cut him into two. Many of the Wind and Cloud Pavilion disciples immediately cheered at the sight.

“Great Elder is mighty!”

“Great Elder is too amazing!”

“How could that trivial brat survive the might of Great Elder’s sword?! In terms of the Sword Dao, Great Elder might rank in the top ten in the entire Western Territory!”

“Hahaha! That’s what you get for being so arrogant and wild! Now you finally know your place!”

…..

Many of the Wind and Cloud Pavilion disciples who had fled in terror after being beaten up just now felt their morale lifting and their hearts were filled with joy.

On the other hand, Lin Yun’er’s pretty face paled instantly as she yelled, “Uncle Yang!”

“Huh?” However, the Great Elder did not look the slightest bit joyful at his accomplishment. He knew his own swordsmanship best and had not felt as if he had cut through anything solid. When he looked again, he felt a chill running down his back as what he saw made the blood in his veins run cold.

The figure that he had cut apart was not a real person and not even a single drop of blood flowed out from it. It was clearly just an afterimage. Even so, the afterimage was so realistic that it managed to deceive so many eyes.

[Where is he? Since it is just an afterimage, that little brat must be unscathed. Where did he go? I didn’t even notice any movement!] The thought had just crossed his mind when a strange figure suddenly appeared before him.

*Ssii…*

The Great Elder gasped in surprise and stabbed out with the sword instinctually.

That sword was undoubtedly an Emperor Artifact as it was exuding waves of Emperor Pressure. Moreover, the Great Elder had wielded this sword for many centuries, so he had long ago reached the point where it was like an extension of his body. The thrust of his sword was immaculate, without any kind of flaw be it the angle or the timing. Sword Intent was dense and focused while the Sword Aura was stable and silent.

“Hm?” Yang Kai was rather surprised. He had met many Second-Order Emperors before and even killed some of them; however, those people were significantly weaker than the Great Elder of Wind and Cloud Pavilion.

The attack might have looked simple, but it was made exquisitely and would land no matter how he tried to dodge or escape, thus he found himself unable to avoid the blow. But if he couldn’t avoid it, he simply had to face it head-on.

Summoning the Myriads Sword into his hands, Yang Kai swung at the approaching sword and a series of metal clashing sounds rang out as they exchanged countless blows in the blink of an eye.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai retreated and looked at the Great Elder in astonishment,

Not far away, the Great Elder’s complexion was pale, his hand holding his sword trembling uncontrollably as he gritted his teeth and shouted, “What is this?!”

In terms of swordsmanship, the young man facing him was not even worthy of carrying his shoes; however, that same young man had blocked his series of attacks despite only being a First-Order Emperor. What the young man relied on wasn’t his mastery of the sword but rather his phenomenal reaction speed and terrifying strength. In particular, the brute force this young man wielded astonished the Great Elder. The power that surged through the opponent’s sword made his blood churn and if not for his own great strength, he probably would have lost the ability to even hold his sword up.

“One man can defeat an army with brute force alone if his strength is great enough!” Yang Kai raised his face and smiled in approval, “Great Elder, your swordsmanship is amazing!”

When those words left his mouth, countless blood arrows suddenly shot from his arms and legs. Even the clothes he was wearing were torn to pieces. During this exchange, Yang Kai had suffered a loss. Although the Great Elder’s vitality had been disturbed from the fallout of their clash, it was Yang Kai who suffered more injuries in the clash. If he had not been wearing the Great Soaring Black Dragon Armour, his injuries would have been far worse.

“Uncle Yang, are you okay?” Lin Yun’er’s voice came from the side. Every time she swung her fists, Wind and Cloud Pavilion disciples died or were critically wounded. When she saw Yang Kai being cut in half just now, she thought he had died and it saddened her so much that she nearly cried. Fortunately, he immediately reappeared and she understood she had seen wrongly and finally felt relieved.

“I’m fine. Yun’er, you should be more careful,” he urged.

“Good.” She nodded repeatedly before declaring, “They can’t beat me.”

Her nonchalant attitude made the Great Elder and many other Elders furious. They could tell that Yang Kai and Lin Yun’er were extraordinarily powerful though, and if they moved carelessly, they might end up failing miserably instead.

The Great Elder glanced at the battle taking place up above, where Li Jiao and Hua Xing fought on par with each other. It would be a long time before they could decide on a winner; thus, he could not place his hopes on the Pavilion Master to come and aid him. Understanding this, a savage look flashed across his eyes as if he made his decision about something as he shouted, “Formation!”
