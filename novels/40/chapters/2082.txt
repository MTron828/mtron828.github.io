How would Qin Zhao Yong not know someone as infamous as Ghost Hand Shen Tu? Having been a Dao Source Realm Master in Maplewood City for so long, he had crossed paths with Shen Tu several times over the years, and had even fought twice due to differences in opinions.

Despite holding Shen Tu in contempt due to his prior actions, Qin Zhao Yong begrudgingly acknowledged Shen Tu’s strength, treating Shen Tu as his number one foe. When they fought, he could only maintain a slight advantage and was unable to properly finish Shen Tu off. Both times, he couldn’t prevent Shen Tu from escaping.

However, from what Qin Yu had mentioned, Yang Kai was actually able to deal a heavy blow against Shen Tu during the critical moment of his promotion to the Dao Source Realm!

In other words, at that time, Yang Kai had yet to reach the Dao Source Realm and was merely a Peak Third-Order Origin King.

Qing Zhao Yang was utterly incapable of imagining the strength required to injure Shen Tu under such circumstances. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Didn’t this also mean that, at that time, Yang Kai was already out of his league?

Now that Yang Kai had ascended to the Dao Source Realm, his cultivation realm had taken a huge step forward, and his strength might have more than doubled!

Reaching this conclusion, Qin Zhao Yang suddenly felt his breathing turn heavy. Earlier on, he had tried his best to convince himself of Yang Kai’s strength, but he was actually underestimating Yang Kai!

“What about Shen Tu?” Qin Zhao Yang asked impatiently.

Shen Tu had had some past grievances against the Qin Family, and if they could track him down while he was still recovering from serious injuries, it was a golden opportunity to exterminate the root of the problem.

With a bitter smile, Qin Yu replied, “I was just about to tell you about this matter, Old Ancestor! Shen Tu is dead!”

“Dead?” Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes contracted in shock. “Didn’t you say that he only suffered serious injuries? How did it go from serious injuries to death?”

“During his promotion... that sir had another Dao Source Realm protecting him from the shadows. After suffering serious injuries and being forced to retreat, Shen Tu was killed by that protector in a single strike! However, it’s a pity... I was unable to see exactly who that protector was, nor the level of their strength.”

“Eh?” A look of excitement filled Qin Zhao Yang’s face. “Are you telling me that a hidden master is backing Little Brother Yang?”

Qin Yu nodded her head and replied in excitement. “Yes, Old Ancestor. That person is a loose cultivator. If we’re able to pull him into our Qin Family, we will definitely receive a great boost in strength. Furthermore, with another powerful master behind him, our Qin Family will definitely benefit if we’re able to establish a good relationship with him!”

A gleam flashed across Qin Zhao Yang’s eyes. “I understand what you’re implying. However, that matter can only proceed after the danger before us is settled.”

“Yu’er understands. However, please pay attention to this, Old Ancestor. Please be careful to never offend that person,” Qin Yu reminded her Old Ancestor in a solemn voice. A peculiar gleam sparkled within her beautiful eyes, before she quickly added, “Perhaps, the revival of our Qin Family will fall on his shoulders.”

Hearing her words, an intense tremble shook through Qin Zhao Yang’s face as he said with rapt attention, “Did you see something else, Yu’er?”

Qin Yu shook her head and replied, “My Fated Fortune Heavenly Pupil only allowed me to see his absolutely insane fortune and opportunities. His future is definitely not limited to Maplewood City.”

Qin Zhao Yang’s expression changed. “Your words give this old man some assurance.”

After finishing their conversation, the two looked outside the city, though they were unable to see anything through the darkness. The only thing they could make out was the constantly surging Demon Qi, still appearing to be gathering towards a certain location. Within the patch of jet-black Demon Qi, various roars of demonic creatures continued to ring out, making everyone’s hair stand on end.

“Where the hell did all of these damn things come from?”

Outside of the city, a deep frown had covered Yang Kai’s face. Before he had exited the city, he wasn’t able to notice this. However, upon leaving the city and entering this endlessly dark world, he was gradually able to discover the seemingly endless amount of demonic creatures within the Demon Qi.

Furthermore, just like a speck of radiance within the jet black world, he attracted countless demonic creatures to encircle and attack him.

Under the pressure from his Dao of Space, the surrounding region became incomparably dense. Regardless of how high their cultivation level was, any demonic creature that came within 20 feet from him was rendered immobile.

As all-encompassing golden light sparkled about, all of the demonic creatures were sliced into bits by the Golden Blood Threads.

Nevertheless, despite Yang Kai’s incomparably valiant display, the demonic creatures still continued to rush towards him like berserkers without the fear of death. After a moment of work, a hill of corpses had already formed beneath his feet.

Although the Source Qi protecting his body was able to resist the Demon Qi’s corrosion, he could tell how exceedingly strong its corrosive properties were from the intense hissing sounds ringing out all around him. If this continued on, it would be severely taxing on Yang Kai’s strength.

“Come out!”

After fighting for a moment, Yang Kai’s forehead wrinkled. With a low roar, the Queen Monster Insect and Blue Flame Thunder Wolf both graced the battlefield, standing by his side.

Upon their appearance, the two great Blood Beasts immediately moved in accordance with Yang Kai’s commands.

Flashes of light blossomed from the Queen Monster Insect’s twin violet swords, as an ice-cold Domain expanded out. In an instant, a bitter cold engulfed a one thousand metre radius. Snowflakes started fluttering down from the sky, and as they fluttered by the bodies of the surrounding demonic creatures, miserable shrieks rang out as they were sliced into halves.

Take big gulps and exhaling heavily, balls of fire and bolts of lightning shot out from the Blue Flame Thunder Wolf’s mouth. Although the might of its attacks weren’t comparable to the Queen Monster Insect, it was still able to hold its own.

*Chi Chi Chi...*

The blood radiance blossoming from the two great Blood Beasts was so dense, they appeared to be corporeal. Stained with a weak golden-red brilliance, they continued to reject the advancement of the seemingly unstoppable Demon Qi.

For a moment, the current situation seemed to stabilise.

With no other person present, Yang Kai was free to unleash all of his abilities without restraint. With Space Force surrounding his body, various kinds of Space Force Secret Techniques were launched by him. With the cooperation from the two great Blood Beasts, the countless demonic creatures present were utterly incapable of coming any nearer than ten metres from him!

Fortunately, considering the average cultivation realms of the cultivators in the vicinity of Maplewood City, despite the strength boost after being corroded by the Demon Qi into demonic creatures, they did not become substantially stronger.

If not for that, how could Yang Kai be able to accomplish this feat as easily?

After fighting for quite a while, Yang Kai started to become affected by the bloodlust. No longer carrying about conserving his energy, Moon Blade after Moon Blade flew out in all directions, creating neat paths in their wake.

Just at this moment, appearing to have sensed something, the Queen Monster Insect waved its twin swords, sending its frost Dao powers shooting to a certain location.

Right there, a ghostly figure that was approaching them stealthily was forced to make an appearance by the incoming attack.

This new figure seemed to appear somewhat different from other demonic creatures, as the evil aura surrounding its body was incomparably large as compared to the others. Furthermore, it was surrounded by a dense clump of Demon Qi, and had also used some kind of Secret Technique to obscure Yang Kai’s senses.

If not for the Queen Monster Insect detecting it, Yang Kai might have only been able to detect it after it had closed in on him.

“A Jiang Family member?” Nevertheless, Yang Kai reacted exceedingly quickly in response. Right as the Queen Monster Insect made its move, he had already cast his gaze towards the location of its attack. Upon focusing his gaze, he was astonished to discover that it was actually an elder of the Jiang Family, someone whom Yang Kai had fought with previously.

However, Yang Kai didn’t know his opponent’s name.

This Jiang Family Elder’s cultivation was previously at the Third-Order Origin King realm, but right now, it had increased in might, with the current energy fluctuations radiating from his body already reaching the Dao Source Realm in strength. However, the strange thing was that he was still in the Third-Order Origin King realm!

Thinking about that, Yang Kai immediately realized that this was the contribution from the Demon Qi.

After being corrupted by the Demon Qi, despite the loss of consciousness, one’s strength would increase as a result.

After turning into a demon, this Jiang Family Elder’s strength had greatly increased. Nevertheless, the Demon Qi wasn’t omnipotent and thus was unable to truly promote him into a Dao Source Realm cultivator. It was able to increase the quality of the Source Qi within his body but was unable to lead any quantitative change.

“Courting death!” Yang Kai had a deep-seated hatred for the Jiang Family evildoers that had caused the crisis that Maplewood City was currently facing. If not for their wanton harvesting of that mine, he would not have been swept into all of these troubles.

If not, he could very well be focusing his mind on his cultivation in his cave mansion.

Sensing the murderous intent rising from Yang Kai, the Queen Monster Insect didn’t hesitate one bit to wave its twin swords. Two different coloured flashes of light crisscrossed as they shot towards the Jiang Family Elder.

The sound of a body being sliced into bits rang out.

Despite gaining strength from being corrupted by Demon Qi, how would the Jiang Family elder be a match for the Queen Monster Insect?

As the flashes of light shot over, the Jiang Family Elder’s body was sliced into four parts.

Before he died, there was unexpectedly not even a shred of terror in his eyes. On the contrary, roars continued to ring out from his mouth, as though he had turned into a raving lunatic.

“Whoosh...” right at this instant, a figure wielding a sword suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai. The sword was completely black in colour, with a jet black aura radiating from its entire blade. With a flash, the sword pieced towards the back of Yang Kai’s head.

As this figure surfaced, the Blue Flame Thunder Wolf opened its mouth to shoot out a brazier-sized fireball right at it.

However, this person unexpectedly did not evade or dodge, choosing to meet the fireball head-on. The jet black Demon Qi that surrounded it scattered apart, accompanied by a wave of a charred smell.

However, after enduring that attack head-on, his long sword was successful in piercing Yang Kai’s head.

“Ha ha ha ha!” Managing to land his strike, the person could not hold back and started to chuckle heartily, his deranged laughter filled within unconcealable nefarious intent.

“You sound so happy, Brother Chu He!”

An indifferent sounding voice rang out from an unknown position behind his back.

Turning pale in fright, this demon hastily turned its head around, only to discover Yang Kai, whom he thought he had just killed, was already standing behind him and was staring at him with a look of ridicule.

As for the figure whose head he had just stabbed with his sword, it started to slowly dissipate away. That was merely an afterimage.

Seeing the demon look over, Yang Kai could not help but chuckle. “What made you so happy for you to laugh like that, Brother Chu He? Can you share the happiness with me?”

After the earlier incident where the Jiang Family Elder had concealed his figure and almost managed to unleash a sneak attack, how would Yang Kai relax his vigilance? Therefore, he had naturally managed to discover Jiang Chu He’s movements the instant the latter took action. With Yang Kai’s skills, evading a sneak attack like this did not pose any difficulty for him at all.

At this moment, Jiang Chu He was radiating an aura even more powerful than the Jiang Family Elder. He was not able to break through into the Dao Source Realm, was unable to utilize the power of a domain. However, all of his other abilities were on par with a Dao Source Realm master.

Faced with such ridicule from Yang Kai, Jiang Chu He was completely blinded by rage; all of a sudden, with a low roar, his expression grew ruthless, while surging Demon Qi gushed out from his body. At this moment, his originally black pupils grew even more jet black, to the point that they seemed to be able to suck in the souls of people who dared to look at them.
