After thinking for a while, Yang Kai solemnly put away the jade slip.

He had a free and easy disposition. So, knowing that it would be useless to mess around with the Withered Soul Seal, he stopped paying attention to it.

He turned his gaze back to the little pot of thick medicinal soup.

According to the information left in the jade slip, the small pot of medicinal soul was the Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup that Gong Sun Mu spent the remaining half of his life brewing. What ingredients were used to brew this Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup and what its miraculous effects were, Yang Kai had no idea.

But since it was compensation for the Withered Soul Seal, obviously, it would be quite beneficial to take it.

Furthermore, Gong Sun Mu’s cave mansion had existed for a couple millennia and it had been a very long time since he was alive. In other words, this pot of medicinal soup had been brewing for one or two millennia at the very least!

It was thanks to the Earth Fire drawn by the Array that it could continue to boil. Or else, it would have been reduced to nothing but a waste a long time ago.

The Yuan Furnace Mountain had always been incomparably desolate. No cultivator paid attention to it, which should be Gong Sun Mu’s handiwork. It wasn’t difficult for an Emperor Realm master to cause the people to misunderstand it as a barren mountain with a bit of disguise and some tricks to prevent the Yuan Furnace Mountain’s World Energy from leaking.

The cultivators were finally drawn to this place because of the sudden appearance of intermittent colourful glow and the strange fragrance.

And that phenomenon was obviously caused by this pot of soup.

When a Heaven-defying precious treasure was about to mature, or an extremely high-level artifact or pill was about to be refined, it would trigger a Heavenly Manifestation!

The manifestation at the Yuan Furnace Mountain was obviously due to the successful brewing of this medicinal soup.

Now that it had successfully brewed and was of great benefit to him, Yang Kai had no reason to let it go.

He sat cross-legged before the small pot and used a bit of his energy to cut off the supply of Earth Fire drawn by the Array. Immediately after, he reached out and picked up the small pot, bringing the pot of Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup before himself.

Observing it this closely, Yang Kai found that the medicinal soup was extremely thick and yet crystal clear; it didn’t have the slightest bit of impurities. He could clearly see the bottom of the pot. Meanwhile, colourful bubbles continued to rise from the bottom, making for quite the magical sight.

As the strong aroma entered his nose, Yang Kai felt refreshed.

He had no words to describe the scent at the tip of his nose. Even the charming fragrance of the purest and holiest virgin body couldn’t match this scent and Yang Kai had never smelled anything that could leave such a lasting pleasant flavour.

Along his journey to the Third-Order Origin King Realm, Yang Kai had not had a desire to taste something for a long while. And with his strength and physique, he didn’t need to eat anything. But after this aroma entered his nose, his rare appetite was stirred, as if he hadn’t eaten for many days. He couldn’t wait to swallow this pot of soup.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai brought the small pot to his mouth and started drinking.

Strangely enough, the pot of Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soul seemed incomparably hot, but when it entered the mouth, it wasn’t. On the contrary, its temperature was just perfect. Furthermore, its fragrance filled his entire mouth and it was far more delicious than anything Yang Kai had ever eaten.

There was only one bowl of Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup. As such, he raised his head up and downed it in one go, not leaving a single drop behind.

After a while, Yang Kai let out a loud burp, spurting a colourful glow.

Before he could relish the taste of the Ten Thousands Medicinal Treasure Soup, his stomach suddenly became extremely hot as streams of heat quickly flowed through his limbs and bones like it was tangible, giving rise to an itching sensation.

Yang Kai’s face immediately changed. He hurriedly threw that small pot into the Space Ring and closed his eyes, regulating his breathing while silently circulating his cultivation technique.

And after just ten breaths of Yang Kai taking the small pot of Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup from its place, the entire Yuan Furnace Mountain suddenly started quaking with deafening rumbles. The ground started shaking, rocks rolled down the mountain, and the peak fell to one side as the entire Yuan Furnace Mountain suddenly split into countless pieces and quickly sank down.

Inside the mountain, in the countless identical stone rooms, all the cultivators who were still alive had a change in their expression.

Just when they were wondering what the Hell was going on, all the Transmission Arrays in the stone room were activated. In an instant, all the surviving cultivators disappeared from their positions.

In the next moment, figures mysteriously appeared one after another about a dozen kilometres away from the Yuan Furnace Mountain. Everyone looked confused.

“Brother Lian, you were sent out too?” hurriedly shouted Raging Fire Temple Vice Temple Master Zong Qing as he looked around and noticed a frowning Lian Yu Ming.

Hearing the shout, Lian Yu Ming immediately turned his head to look at Zong Qing. He was surprised to find Zong Qing too. He nodded and replied, “Yes! It seems that you were also teleported out!?”

“That’s right!” Zong Qing solemnly looked at the shaking Yuan Furnace Mountain and doubtfully asked, “What happened there? Why is everyone teleported out?”

Lian Yu Ming thought for a while before asking, “Brother Zong, did you come across stone rooms after you entered?”

“Yes! And all kinds of weird tests as well. They seemed to be related to Alchemy. By the way, Brother Lian, you are proficient in Alchemy, those tests shouldn’t be difficult for you.”

Lian Yu Ming slowly shook his head in response and replied, “This old master had only passed the fifth stone room. I have no idea what we would gain after passing all the tests, but judging by the tests, this cave mansion should belong to an Alchemist.”

Hearing this, Zong Qing pondered for a moment and agreed, nodding, “Brother Lian has a point. If that’s the case, you can ask the other disciples if they have gained anything or not.”

While talking, Zong Qing looked around. And when he noticed that only a half of his elite disciples were left, his expression finally changed.

Right then, he focused his gaze on a nearby figure and asked in surprise, “It’s you!?”

Not too far away, a helpless look appeared on Kang Si Ran’s face.

He too was sent out when the commotion of the Yuan Furnace Mountain started. And now, he happened to be caught in the middle of many Raging Fire Temple disciples. He didn’t dare to act rashly so as to prevent other people from misunderstanding. At this moment, he was noticed by Zong Qing. He was left with no choice but to cup his first and introduce himself, “Maplewood City Spirit Pill Plaza, Shopkeeper Kang Si Ran greets the two Vice Temple Masters.”

“Spirit Pill Plaza!?” Lian Yu Ming’s pupil constricted after hearing this. “Violet Source Chamber of Commerce’s Spirit Pill Plaza!?”

“That’s right,” Kang Si Ran nodded and at the same time, he was finally relieved. He was really helpless this time and had no choice but to reveal his identity and origin. After all, his fists weren’t bigger than the opposite party. All he could do was use the awe and prestige of Violet Source Chamber of Commerce to deter the opposite party.

As expected, after having come to know Kang Si Ran’s background, Zong Qing and Lian Yu gazed at each other before withdrawing their previous hostility. The former then said, “This Zong has heard of Spirit Pill Plaza. So Your Excellency is Spirit Pill Plaza’s Shopkeeper Kang. I’m sorry for not recognizing you.”

“Vice Temple Master Zong, you are being too polite,” Kang Si Ran replied calmly.

“Shopkeeper Kang, do you know what happened inside the Yuan Furnace Mountain?” Zong Qing asked in a deep voice.

Kang Si Ran shook his head and replied, “This Kang is at a loss too.”

“If I remember it correctly, Shopkeeper Kang had a friend with him. Where is he now?” Lian Yu Ming asked, immersed in his thoughts.

Hearing this, Kang Si Ran’s expression darkened. He glanced in the direction of the Yuan Furnace Mountain and sighed, “Since Brother Yang has failed to appear here, he has obviously encountered something unexpected inside. I see that your noble Temple seems to be short of many disciples, this Yuan Furnace Mountain’s tests aren’t that simple.”

He really believed that Yang Kai had fallen inside the Yuan Furnace Mountain. After all, even two Dao Source Realm masters like Zong Qing and Lian Yu Ming were teleported out. It was natural to imagine the fate of those who were not teleported out like this.

For a moment, Kang Si Ran could help but feel a little sad. On the one hand, it was because he couldn’t find the much needed Dao Source Pill in the Yuan Furnace Mountain, and on the other, it was because of Yang Kai’s death.

Zong Qing and Lian Yu Ming gazed at each other before lightly nodding their acknowledgement.

As they didn’t notice any pretence in Kang Si Ran’s expression, they have no intention of pestering him. Zong Qin said, “In that case, please restrain your grief, Shopkeeper Kang. Please go back. In any case, the Yuan Furnace Mountain is within the domain of my Raging Fire Temple. We will be doing another search.”

How could Kang Si Ran not notice such an obvious order to leave? After a long sigh, he cupped his fists to Zong Qing and Lian Yu Ming before turning around and flying in the direction of Maplewood City.

After a while, the entire Yuan Furnace Mountain completely collapsed with an earth-shattering crash.

After everything returned to calm, Zong Qing and Lian Yu Ming led the remaining Raging Fire Temple disciples to search the ruins of the Yuan Furnace Mountain. But unfortunately, even after flipping the entire collapsed mountain for two months, they couldn’t find anything.

All they found were the corpses of a few disciples that had died tragically!

Two months later, the Raging Fire Temple disciples had no choice but to leave.

...

Heaven knows how many feet deep underground, Yang Kai was continuously roaring like a wounded beast in the stone cavern. If anyone heard his screams, they might immediately flee in fright. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The efficacy of the Ten Thousand Medicinal Treasures Soup was extremely strong and continuous. After he drank it, it transformed into streams of pure energy that surged to every nook and cranny of Yang Kai’s body.

After his meridians and physique were eroded by its efficacy, they continuously grew tougher and stronger. The meridians widened and the physique remoulded. Yang Kai’s entire body was violently shaking. Every inch of his body, his skin, and even his internal organs and marrow, was stinging, as if tens of thousands of ants were gnawing his body. He was feeling as if he was suffering the most painful torture in the world!

Bit by bit, his skin began to crack as Golden Blood flowed out, which slowly solidified into a blood clot.

The outer surface of the blood clot was covered by the Golden Blood that flowed out again.

Gradually, Yang Kai’s entire figure was covered in a golden blood cocoon. His figure couldn’t be seen from outside. Only his strong heartbeat, which sounded much like war drums, could be heard.

Heaven knows how long this lasted. One second, it seemed countless years, but then it seemed just a moment in another.

And with the passage of time, Yang Kai’s roars coming from the blood cocoon gradually weakened before disappearing altogether, as if he had grown accustomed to this painful transformation.
