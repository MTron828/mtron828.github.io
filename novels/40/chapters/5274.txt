Then, Yang Kai spoke of the bloody battles that the North-South Army fought with the Black Ink Clan Army in order to stop them from leaving Great Evolution Pass and returning to the Royal City to provide reinforcements.

He also spoke of the East-West Army’s withdrawal from the Royal City, the panic of the Black Ink Clansmen at Great Evolution Pass, and the negotiations with the North-South Army which led to the Great Evolution Army taking back Great Evolution Pass without further bloodshed.

Bit by bit, Yang Kai tried to detail everything to the best of his abilities and retell the encounters of the Great Evolution Army over the years.

After he finished, he also felt a bit reminiscent about the campaign that lasted over 100 years. East-West Army’s Xiang Shan and North-South Army’s Mi Jing Lun used their strategic talents to the fullest, and if not for the two of them overseeing their respective fronts, even if they had twice the amount of troops, it would still be a far-fetched dream to recover Great Evolution Pass within just 150 years.

Yuan Xing Ge was silent, so nobody could tell what was on his mind. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After hearing everything, the Old Ancestor nodded, “You have all worked hard.”

Yang Kai did not dare to take credit for the feat and cupped his fist, “This Junior was just one soldier at the front. It was thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of all the Seniors that today’s successes were achieved.”

The Old Ancestor smiled at him, clearly pleased with his humility.

However, the Old Ancestor knew that perhaps even the boy in front of him had no idea what a difference his arrival made to the entire Black Ink Battlefield.

Not to mention the Purifying Light which was able to dispel and cleanse Black Ink Strength, the Purifying Black Ink Pills which were being mass-produced in each Great Pass was also found by Yang Kai when he was exploring a Sealed World. There were also those Purifying Black Ink Battleships that were with each Army. Which one of these innovations did not have this boy’s mark on them?

Now, it was also easier for Humans to mine for resources thanks to the existence of the improved Void Yin-Yang Mirrors.

Without all of these, how could the Human Race even have hoped to retake Great Evolution Pass? Furthermore, how could they plan for a future crusade?

It could be said that though the cultivation of this boy in front of him was not very high, he was the key point that brought change to the landscape of the entire Black Ink Battlefield. Even a venerable Ninth-Order Master could not underestimate someone like this because, oftentimes, such existences were able to make great differences with just a small bit of power in places that they themselves do not even realize, which was enough to influence the fortune of an entire Race.

The Old Ancestor did not ask any more questions. He had only called Yang Kai over here to find out about the situation of the Great Evolution Army’s campaign, and now that he knew, he would not bother with saying anything more.

The Old Ancestor continued feeding tender grass to the Black Cattle by hand, appearing just like an old farmer in the mountains, not the least bit imposing.

Yuan Xing Ge withdrew with Yang Kai.

Before leaving, the Old Ancestor gifted Yang Kai several dozen kilograms of beef as a reward for his taking the time to travel here. The beef was very fresh and the blood had still not dried, as if it had just been butchered.

After exiting the Old Ancestor’s Small Universe, Yang Kai carried several dozens of kilograms of bloody beef with him and asked Yuan Xing Ge with an expectant look on his face, “Sir, this beef… is there anything special about it?”

He could not bring himself to ask such a question in front of the Old Ancestor himself.

Now that he was out though, he didn’t have to be so cautious. Yang Kai just could not settle down if he did not find out.

Yuan Xing Ge pondered for a moment before saying, “The texture is… good?”

Yang Kai’s face went dark, “Sir, you know I don’t mean that…” He rubbed his brow for a moment before deciding to speak frankly with him, “Old Ancestor’s beef, will there be any special effects after eating it?”

Yuan Xing Ge advised, “You’ve seen the Black Cattle that the Old Ancestor was feeding. Did you notice it having any sort of divine bloodline in it?”

Yang Kai thought about it for a moment and shook his head, “They were just ordinary Black Cattle.”

Yuan Xing Ge looked askance at him, “Then what were you expecting?”

Yang Kai was suddenly struck speechless, but he was also unrelenting, “Is this beef from the cattle raised by the Old Ancestor?”

Yuan Xing Ge gave him a vague answer, “I suggest you take it back and cook it into soup. The cattle that Old Ancestor rears are somewhat gamey and are not very tasty.”

He spoke, appearing experienced.

Yang Kai didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. When he looked at the several dozen kilograms of bloody beef in his hands, he sighed and silently put them away.

In the end, it was still a gift from an Old Ancestor, so he would make some soup with it once he returned and hand it out to the members of Dawn Squad so that they could enjoy the taste. Everyone had been working quite hard, after all, these past 150 years.

After returning to the Grand Hall where the Space Array sat, some Eighth-Order Masters were still waiting there, in no hurry to leave.

Yuan Xing Ge asked, “Has Brother Tian Lu not returned yet?”

An Eighth-Order Master shook his head, “We haven’t received any news yet.”

Yuan Xing Ge nodded before turning to Yang Kai, “What about you? Will you wait here?”

Yang Kai cupped his fist, “This Junior came here to test the effects of the Space Array. Now that the task is complete, it is time for me to return to Great Evolution Pass.”

Yuan Xing Ge did not stop him, “In that case, go on.”

The soldiers guarding this area were asked to prepare the supplies for teleportation and soon, Yang Kai was standing at the centre of the array. Once the Grand Array was activated and the Space Gate opened, he disappeared without a trace.

He was expecting a repeat of what he encountered earlier, but this journey was completely smooth.

Soon, Yang Kai reappeared on the Space Array at Great Evolution Pass, where a group of Array Masters scrambled over to ask about the situation earlier.

Yang Kai gave them a simple rundown of what he experienced, but he himself could not quite figure out where the problem lay.

“Did someone from Wind and Cloud Pass come earlier?”

The bald Grandmaster answered, “En, a man who called himself Wind and Cloud Pass Northern Army’s Army Commander, Tian Lu. He is currently speaking with Army Commander Xiang Shan and the others.”

The fat Grandmaster then asked, “Yang Boy, has our Space Array been fixed or not?”

Yang Kai frowned, “I think we can consider it fixed.”

“Then what happened earlier?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, “Perhaps there was a blockage in the Void since the corridor between these two places had not been open for so long? Then, after I went into it myself, the blockage was cleared?”

The Grandmaster were all speechless at his uncertain explanation.

However, other than this, there did not seem to be any other explanation. After all, it was only Yang Kai’s first transit where a problem arose. After that, everything was smooth whether it be for Tian Lu coming over from Wind and Cloud Pass or Yang Kai’s return trip.

From this alone, it seemed like the Space Array had been repaired.

Since the repairs had been completed, the higher-ups had to be informed.

Yang Kai personally went to Liu Zhi Ping to report on the matter, and she naturally praised him. At once, arrangements were made for news of the successful recovery of Great Evolution Pass to be passed around to each of the Great Passes.

It was only natural that the entire Race be informed of such good news; after all, everyone was paying great attention to this matter, and the sooner the news got to them, the better.

Soon, a jade slip bearing Old Ancestor Xiao Xiao’s aura was sent through the Space Array to each Great Pass, with the good news recorded into each of them.

A lot of resources were spent each time the Hyper Space Array was used. Depending on a cultivators’ realm, the consumption of the materials also varied. On the whole, the higher one’s cultivation, the higher the consumption would be; however, if they were only sending things such as jade slips, then the consumption could be minimized.

So, with the current stock of resources at Great Evolution Pass, it was enough to support simple matters such as sending out jade slips.

However, they had to send a jade slip to each of the Great Passes, so it would still take a considerable amount of time to complete.

After many days had passed, Great Evolution Pass had opened and closed the Space Array over 100 times so that they could send out the more than 100 jade slips that they had.

During this time, Yang Kai stayed by the array, monitoring its condition.

Fortunately, everything went smoothly. No abnormalities appeared in any of the activations, so all of the jade slips were also sent out successfully.

With that, it seemed as if Great Evolution Pass’s Space Array truly had been repaired.

Elsewhere, news of their success was met with great joy in all of the Great Passes as 30,000 years of humiliation were finally wiped away.

It was clear to the higher-ups that Great Evolution Pass had been retaken, which meant that the Human Race’s crusade was not far off, so they were all secretly preparing for it.

In fact, as early as when the Human Race decided to take back Great Evolution Pass, they had already been preparing for the crusade. The Evil Purging Divine Spear created by Grandmaster Ma Fan was the greatest weapon for this crusade, and in order to hide it, Great Evolution Army did not dare to use it during the entire war to retake Great Evolution Pass, fearing that news would get out, putting the Black Ink Clan on guard.

If they had made use of the Evil Purging Divine Spears, it would have been much easier to recover Great Evolution Pass and they would have suffered fewer losses, but this would be detrimental to the entire Human Race in the long run.

…..

One day, Yang Kai was leading Dawn’s Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters around, searching for a suitable location.

Dawn was still an incredibly powerful team. Even though they lost Qi Tai Chu in the previous war, they had recruited Blood Crow, so Dawn’s Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters still numbered 8 in total.

Yang Kai’s intention bringing these Seventh-Order Masters out this time was not to stir up trouble with the Black Ink Clan.

The Black Ink Clan in the Great Evolution Theatre were now hiding in their Royal City, licking their wounds, so how could they dare to come all the way to Great Evolution Pass?

These Seventh-Order Masters were all brought here to help act as Protectors.

150 years had passed since Yang Kai departed from Blue Sky Pass, and with the flow of time in his Small Universe being four times faster than the outside, it meant that nearly 700 years had passed in Void Continent.

During these 700 years, many new disciples had cultivated to the peak inside the Void Dao Temple, and there were now 10 youths who had the qualifications to advance to the Open Heaven Realm.

The nurturing of the World Tree clone was constantly impacting Yang Kai’s Small Universe, which allowed Void Dao Temple’s disciples to grow so quickly.

Previously, during the war against the Black Ink Clan in the Great Evolution Theatre, Yang Kai was in no position to allow these disciples to break through, but now that things had settled down, there was no need for him to worry as much as before.

10 cultivators needed to break through to the Open Heaven Realm, so Yang Kai alone could not stand guard for all of them. As such, he dragged all of the Seventh-Order Masters of Dawn out here so that they could help out. With the current vision and abilities of Dawn’s Seventh-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, standing guard for these little ones was no problem at all.

It did not take long for him to settle on a spot in the void. After looking left and right and confirming that there were no issues, Yang Kai waved his hand, and as the Void distorted before 10 Emperor Realm cultivators appeared out of thin air in front of him.

There were both males and females among them, occupying half of the numbers each, all of them sharing one characteristic, and that was that they all looked young and vigorous.

There were only two possibilities for a cultivator looking so young, and that was either that they had cultivated beauty techniques, or that they had grown up very quickly. As long as one was able to grow quickly in strength and make progress in their cultivation, then time would not leave as many traces on their appearance.

The Emperors before them were clearly part of the latter. Due to the nurturing power of the World Tree clone, as well as their own innate talent for cultivation, these youths ascended rapidly on their Martial Dao.
