After half a day, the group landed on a certain mountain. The entire Ancient Wild Lands was filled with who knows how many rolling and zig-zag mountains, making such places the best for Monster Race to establish themselves upon.

This was where Yang You Wei’s cave mansion was located.

According to him, with this mountain as the centre, the surrounding ten nearby mountains were his territory.

Yang Kai took out the jade slip handed to him by Pi San and compared it, soon finding that where he now stood already exceeded the range recorded by the detailed map. The only thing that was noted about this place was that it was a dark shade of red, meaning it was extremely dangerous.

Apparently, the information in the jade slip wasn’t useless. If an ordinary cultivator saw this indication in jade slip, he would definitely not dare to arbitrarily come here.

There was a cave halfway up the mountain, one leading to the belly of the mountain. Inside, there was a special Cave Haven, with many grottos and the like having been dug out. There was little aesthetic sense to it as the Monster Race probably never cared about decorations and cared only about practicality.

Yang You Wei led Yang Kai and Zhang Ruo Xi into a certain grotto for Yang Kai and the one adjacent for Zhang Rui Xi before he left with much nodding and bowing.

It was a good idea to be respectful to the one who had one’s life in his hands.

Inside the grotto, Yang Kai looked around and found that although the place was small, there were five rooms in it. It should be the place where Yang You Wei lived. There were stone beds in it with exquisite beddings that Yang You Wei obtained from who knows where.

There was also a natural bath in the grotto that used water seemingly gathered from a mountain spring. The water was crystal clear, and Yang Kai tried it out and found that the temperature was actually quite pleasant.

“These guys sure know how to enjoy life,” Yang Kai smiled slightly as he walked to a nearby stone bench and sat down.

“Sir, what should we do now?” Zhang Ruo Xi, who was next to him, asked.

“We’ll figure that out when we need to,” Yang Kai heaved a slight sigh. He didn’t expect the trip to the Ancient Lands to be this eventful; however, he couldn’t ignore the Third Disciple even if his primary concern was finding Xiao Xiao.

There was a spiritual connection between him and Xiao Xiao, similar to the one he once shared with Liu Yan, allowing him to sense Xiao Xiao’s existence as long as they weren’t too far apart.

Naturally, Zhang Ruo Xi would only follow his orders and raised no objections.

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. The two looked at each other before Yang Kai signalled Zhang Ruo Xi with his eyes. The latter moved lithely and went to the door.

Outside the door, Yang You Wei was anxiously fidgeting. There were two beautiful maids carrying something on either side behind him. One was holding a pot of spirit wine and the other was holding a plate of spirit fruits. They had beautiful eyes and slim and slender figures while their voluptuous figures were only covered by a thin and translucent muslin, tantalizing one’s imagination, especially their bare snow-white slender thighs that instantly drew the attention of men.

Obviously, these two beautiful maids were not Human as they were exuding an obvious Monster Qi, their true forms unknown; however, since they could assume Human form, they had undoubtedly gained sentience and knew how to cultivate.

The two women were also very curious. They had always exclusively served Yang You Wei, but this time, Yang You Wei had asked them to serve an honoured guest. Yang You Wei clearly stated that no matter what the honoured guest wanted, they had to obey, and they had to do it with smiles and flattery, not showing any resistance.

It wasn’t like the two were totally oblivious to what Yang You Wei meant; though, they didn’t mind it either. Accompanying Yang You Wei was ‘accompanying’, and accompanying the honoured guest was also ‘accompanying’. They were just guessing which powerful Monster General or Monster King had come here. If that wasn’t the case, how could Yang You Wei be willing to ask the two of them to please someone else?

As the door opened, Yang You Wei looked up, but before he could address his new ‘Sir’, he swallowed his words back and asked in amazement, looking at Zhang Ruo Xi, “Young Lady, what are you doing here? Where is Sir?”

Zhang Ruo Xi vigilantly glanced at him before turning her focus on the two alluring women who were acting coquettishly and were indecently dressed. Her pretty face immediately turned colder, especially after seeing the two women peeking through the crack in the door. She could see what was going to happen, and this made her uncomfortable.

She looked back and found that Yang Kai happened to be curiously looking at this side, his eyes constantly scanning the two ‘offerings’ over and over again.

She immediately stepped forward and slammed the door shut behind her, cutting off the presumptuous gazes of the two women, making the two look at her with resentment.

“Sir is tired and resting. What’s the matter?” Zhang Ruo Xi didn’t give Yang You Wei any face.

Yang You Wei chuckled before replying with a bow, “It’s like this. Sir came here for the first time, but there is nothing for entertainment in this barren mountain, so this lowly one came to offer a pot of spirit wine and a plate of spirit fruits. This lowly one hopes that Sir will not refuse this lowly one’s hospitality!”

Zhang Ruo Xi finally shifted her gaze to the spirit wine and spirit fruits before lightly snorting through her nose.

Yang You Wei didn’t know what she was planning to do, so he remained standing there to make her give way, but he discovered that Zhang Ruo Xi had blocked the door like a guard, and she wasn’t showing any intention of giving way at all. In desperation, he turned to the two women and gestured to them, signalling the two to give the things in their hands to Zhang Ruo Xi.

“Anything else?” Zhang Ruo Xi took the items and impatiently asked when she saw that they hadn’t left yet. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yang You Wei flatteringly smiled and said, “Sir is tired from the long journey, so this lowly one had also prepared these two maids to wait upon Sir, to help him take bath and rest… I wonder if you can…”

Before he could finish speaking, he saw Zhang Ruo Xi stretch her hand out, pointing towards the way out.

Yang You Wei turned his head but found nothing, making him doubtfully scratch his head.

“Sir has me to serve him, he doesn’t need you. You can go back where you came from. Apart from the news about the crazy woman, if you dare to disturb Sir again, I will take all of your dog lives!” Zhang Ruo Xi’s pupils turned colder as a murderous look appeared on her face.

Yang You Wei was taken aback. He had no idea what mistake he made to offend this Young Lady, but he didn’t dare to be presumptuous before her; after all, Zhang Ruo Xi was brought here by Yang Kai, so offending her would not bode well for him.

He repeatedly bowed and scraped before he took the two women and walked away in frustration. The two women had come here in excitement but were forced to return in disappointment, not to mention a lot of resentment.

“Shameless vixens!” Zhang Ruo Xi, holding the wine pot with one hand and the fruit plate with the other, ground her teeth and cursed.

[Two impure vixens actually dare to aim for Sir, how dare they!? How annoying!? What’s more annoying is that Sir’s eyes actually lit up when he looked at their bodies. That look was very different from…]

Turning around, Zhang Ruo Xi was just about to open the door and step in, fuming in anger, but suddenly, her raised foot froze in the mid-air.

Suddenly, she remembered that she had never seen Sir having close contact with any woman during all the years she had been accompanying him. She was no longer a child and was not ignorant of the relations between men and women. She used to live with Sister Hua in the Small Sealed World, who would often tease her about these matters, making her blush.

She knew very well that with Yang Kai’s cultivation, if he wanted a woman, thousands of beauties would line up to let him choose between them, but he seemed to have never had such ideas. He had been smashing his way through all kinds of difficulties and had been tirelessly cultivating; having almost no time to relax at all.

[How can a man possibly dislike women? Why is Sir so self-disciplined?]

Suddenly, she started blaming herself, feeling like she shouldn’t have blocked the two women; after all, judging by her Sir’s gaze, he seemed quite interested in those two vixens. But she had now presumptuously sent them away…

She anxiously pushed open the door and walked in, placing the spirit wine and fruits on the table before explaining what just transpired, carefully observing Yang Kai’s expression.

Yang Kai just nodded and didn’t do anything else.

[Sir isn’t angry because I ruined his good deed! Otherwise, why would his reaction be so dull, right?] Zhang Ruo Xi suddenly became a little concerned about the pros and cons. She couldn’t help but speculate something, and now, her imagination was running wild…

After a long silence, Zhang Ruo Xi bit her red lips and asked, “Sir, you must be tired from the long journey, do you want me to call back the two women and ask them… To serve you?”

After saying this, Zhang Ruo Xi’s cheek turned slightly red. She was a little embarrassed, and a little afraid that Yang Kai would agree.

Yang Kai took a sniff of the spirit wine and said without raising his head, “No need.”

He was just checking them out, curious about what their true Monster Beast form was. They were indeed charming and sexy, so if they were in the outside world, they would definitely bring a disaster to the nation, but there was no other meaning behind his gaze, so he replied calmly while pouring himself a glass of spirit wine to taste.

“Then… do you want Ruo Xi to personally serve you?”

*Pu…*

Yang Kai spurted the sip of spirit wine and hurriedly wiped it, flabbergasted.

Zhang Ruo Xi couldn’t help giggling at this comical sight, approaching Yang Kai and using her sleeve to wipe his wet clothes with gentle movements.

A sweet fragrance immediately tickled his nose, causing Yang Kai to stare at the flower-like tender and sweet face and say with a smile, “Ruo Xi has grown up.”

He still remembered when he brought Zhang Ruo Xi out from the Zhang Family; she was a little girl back then who had yet to mature, but after following him for so long, she had become a great beauty herself. Perhaps, it was because it was always darker under the lamp that Yang Kai hadn’t noticed it until now.

Zhang Ruo Xi blushed and her movements momentarily paused after hearing this.

Yang Kai patted her shoulder and motioned her to get up, then he got up and dispersed the wine from his robes before speaking, “If you find a man to your liking in the future, tell me. I’ll have him marry the beautiful you.”

Zhang Ruo Xi bit her lip a bit harder than before and held her tongue, a slightly bitter look flashing across her eyes.

“Okay, things should be fine now. You should focus on your cultivation. If there is any news, I will call for you,” Yang Kai waved her away.

Zhang Ruo Xi opened her mouth, but couldn’t come up with anything to say, so she eventually gave a meek ‘yes.’

After she went out and closed the door, Zhang Ruo Xi covered her cheeks with her hands and dashed into the grotto next door, blushing furiously as her heart pounded like a drum.

She couldn’t understand what was wrong with her today. She was hit with a sudden thought and said something she wouldn’t dare to say normally. Looking back now, she really didn’t know where she got the courage to make such a proposal.

These feelings had always been bottled up in a corner of her heart, and if she hadn’t spoken them today, she might not have even noticed them.

[Have I reached the stage mentioned by Sister Hua, the so-called ‘girl in spring’?]
