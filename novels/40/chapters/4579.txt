After Iron Blood Great Emperor had advanced, six more Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters had appeared in Void Land. Although all of them had just broken through and were unable to display the full strength of the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, two of them would easily be able to suppress one opponent.

As long as Zuo Quan Hui’s side didn’t send out more than four Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters, Yang Kai could deal with them without making an appearance, but it was impossible for him to keep hiding Void Land’s strength.

It was not easy to reach the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so Yang Kai estimated that Zuo Quan Hui wouldn’t have too many more at his disposal. In other words, with Void Land’s current strength, they should be able to handle the situation.

A moment later, another batch of streaks of light rushed out from the Heavenly Sword Palace and rushed towards the battlefield. The two leading people were obviously Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters.

Yang Kai looked over, and when he saw the face of one of them, he was stunned as this person’s entire body was surrounded by Demon Qi. It was none other than Myriad Demons Heaven’s Pei Wen Xuan!

[Why is he here? Is it on Myriad Demons Heaven’s orders or of his own volition? If it’s the former, then Void Land will really be in big trouble. Myriad Demons Heaven is one of the 36 Cave Heavens, how can Void Land resist such a massive force?]

If Myriad Demons Heaven really decided to interfere, Yang Kai decided that he would immediately gather everyone and return to Void Land to hide under Bi Xi’s tortoise shell.

However, Yang Kai didn’t find too many Myriad Demons Heaven disciples in the new batch of Open Heaven Realm Masters, only three or four at most. This discovery made Yang Kai feel relieved. Apparently, Pei Wen Xuan’s interference in Void Land’s battle with Heavenly Sword Union wasn’t ordered by Myriad Demons Heaven; otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent so few people here. He should be acting alone.

Naturally, Luan Bai Feng was leading the group together with Pei Wen Xuan.

At the same time Yang Kai saw her, his Communication Bead vibrated. Yang Kai took it out and immediately understood the message Luan Bai Feng had sent him.

All the elites had been deployed to lure the snake out of its hole, so they had to be careful!

Yang Kai quietly put away the Communication Bead and turned his head to look at Iron Blood Great Emperor. Just as he was about to speak though, he suddenly felt two powerful auras appear seemingly out of thin air. Looking up, Yang Kai saw two streaks of light approaching from the distance at an astonishing speed.

Feeling the aura of these two newcomers, Yang Kai’s expression became strange and he swallowed his words.

The two people who had suddenly appeared flew across the vast void like two sharp blades, directly charging towards the team led by Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng with astonishing momentum!

Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng had received Zuo Quan Hui’s orders. They were preparing to bring their people into the battlefield to pressure Void Land further and force Yang Kai to take action, thus creating an opportunity for Zuo Quan Hui to act. But who would have thought that two more Sixth-Order Masters would suddenly appear and attack them.

Feeling the strength of the approaching enemies, Pei Wen Xuan didn’t even have time to think about where these two people had come from or what their identities were. He immediately used a Divine Ability together with Luan Bai Feng to counter-attack.

The two attackers didn’t try to dodge and instead seemed to perform a joint attack technique. The two figures quickly intertwined and their World Forces fused together to form a Taiyi Yin-Yang Chart which suddenly expanded and enveloped Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng.

The next moment, the Taiyi Yin-Yang Chart began rotating rapidly, like a giant millstone crushing the void.

World Force fluctuated wildly as miserable screams rang out.

The people on the shattered Spirit Province were dumbfounded at this sight. Iron Blood Great Emperor and the others, who had been itching to fight, broke into a cold sweat as they stared at the sudden change in the battlefield, secretly wondering what would happen if they were enveloped by this kind of Divine Ability.

They might not end up dead, but serious injuries would be inevitable.

“Who is that?” Iron Blood Great Emperor turned to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hesitated before replying, “It should be Yin-Yang Cave Heaven.”

“You invited them?” Bustling World Great Emperor asked. These two had suddenly appeared without any warning, and Yang Kai had never told them about this either.

Yang Kai denied, shaking his head, “I don’t know about this either.”

He really had no idea what was happening. If it weren’t for those two taking the initiative to attack, he wouldn’t have even known they were here. By the looks of it, Xu Ling Gong didn’t ignore him. His status as a Yin-Yang Cave Heaven Son-in-law still seemed a little useful.

“Then do we still attack?” Iron Blood Great Emperor stared at Yang Kai.

“No need for now.” Yang Kai waved his hand, “Just continue hiding.”

Some of the Great Emperors wore looks of disappointment on their faces. It had only been a short time since they had broken through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm, so they hadn’t had a chance to carefully test their strength yet. They had thought that this was an opportunity, but who would have thought that people from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would suddenly appear and intercept the enemy?

For a moment, they didn’t know if they should thank or curse them.

With a massive burst of energy, the Taiyi Yin-Yang Chart that had been suppressing the entire region suddenly shattered as several figures flew out.

Originally, Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng had brought some 40 or 50 Open Heaven Realm Masters below the Sixth-Order from Heavenly Sword Palace, but now only half of them remained. The rest were all dead. Furthermore, almost everyone who was still alive was injured, with the exception of those at or above the Fifth-Order.

Although Pei Wen Xuan wasn’t hurt, he was still in a sorry state. After breaking free, he roared, “Qing Kui, Su Ying Xue, you court death!”

In the void, Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue stood side by side. The former sneered when he heard this and snapped back, “Such impudence! It seems you need a good beating!”

Luan Bai Feng stood to the side, not saying a word as she adjusted her messy clothes slightly, feeling a heavy weight lifting from her chest.

She had been worried that Yang Kai would be forced to act and give Zuo Quan Hui a chance to kill him, but by the looks of it, the sudden appearance of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven had resolved this crisis.

From her standpoint, she should be thanking Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue, so she naturally wouldn’t say anything, but neither would she let her expressions betray her thoughts.

“You dare attack me?” Pei Wen Xuan stared coldly at Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue, “I’m afraid you’ve forgotten what happened to Qu Hua Shang. I will definitely report this matter to Yin-Yang Cave Heaven and have you condemned as accomplices!”

Back then, Qu Hua Shang had only interfered with Yang Kai’s affairs, nothing too serious, yet she was forced to become a prize for the Dao Theory Assembly and was sentenced to 100 years of confinement. Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue’s actions just now were much more serious than Qu Hua Shang’s as they had directly killed others. If they really followed the rules set by the Cave Heavens and Paradises, they would definitely be charged with the crime of creating internal strife.

Qing Kui, however, wasn’t intimidated and sneered, “If you can’t beat others, you whine and complain to your Elders? Is this Myriad Demons Heaven’s way of doing things? How eye-opening!”

Qing Kui also didn’t have a good impression of Myriad Demons Heaven. The reason why his Little Junior Sister had encountered such a terrible situation was because of Myriad Demons Heaven’s Ti Zheng, so how could he have any goodwill towards Pei Wen Xuan?

Pei Wen Xuan coldly snorted, “Whatever you say, this matter will be decided by your Yin-Yang Cave Heaven!”

Qing Kui wore an aloof expression while Su Ying Xue stated indifferently, “There’s no need to worry about that. Senior Brother and I are no longer Yin-Yang Cave Heaven disciples.”

“Huh?” Pei Wen Xuan gawked, wondering if he had misheard her.

“Because the two of us defied our Honoured Master’s commands a few days ago, we were expelled from the Sect, so we are no longer Yin-Yang Cave Heaven disciples!” Su Ying Xue’s expression remained flat, as if she was discussing the weather rather than their expulsion from their Master Sect. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Pei Wen Xuan’s face was filled with shock, “The two of you were expelled from Yin-Yang Cave Heaven?” His first thought was that it was impossible.

Xu Ling Gong had taken in a total of three Disciples in his life, and each of them was extremely precious to him. Even if they had committed a grave mistake, he would not be willing to expel them from the Sect. Moreover, all Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters were considered part of the elite forces of any Cave Heavens and Paradises and were more than capable of holding the position of an Outer Sect Elder. How could they be casually expelled from the Sect? Even if Xu Ling Gong was willing, Yin-Yang Cave Heaven would not let them go so easily. At the very least, their cultivations would be crippled.

However, on second thought, this explanation sounded somewhat familiar…

Zuo Quan Hui’s lineage could rebel against Thousand Crane Paradise, so why couldn’t Qing Kui and Su Ying Xue be expelled from Yin-Yang Heaven?

Xu Ling Gong was obviously trying to cheat! But thinking about the other party’s character, it wasn’t strange for him to act so shamelessly.

“Good, enough idle chatter. Boy, are you ready?” Qing Kui palmed his fist tightly as he looked towards Pei Wen Xuan with a grin.

“Ready for what?” Pei Wen Xuan’s brow twitched.

“Ready for a beating of course! I hope your skin is thick enough so you don’t get beaten to death by Father here!” As he finished speaking, Qing Kui raised his fists and pushed his World Force towards Pei Wen Xuan.

Pei Wen Xuan cried out in alarm as the Demon Qi around his body surged, transforming into a black cloud that engulfed his body.

Although it had been a few years since he had broken through to the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm and his foundation had somewhat stabilized, how could Pei Wen Xuan be a match for a veteran Sixth-Order Master like Qing Kui? Although he knew that Qing Kui couldn’t really kill him, being beaten half to death was still quite embarrassing, not to mention painful. So, when he saw Qing Kui charging straight at him, Pei Wen Xuan immediately used his Divine Ability to conceal himself while falling back and waiting for an opportunity to act.

However, the Cave Heavens and Paradises had interacted with each other for countless millennia, so even if they didn’t know each other’s techniques and Divine Abilities like the back of their hands, they had a certain understanding of them at the very least. Qing Kui didn’t even bat an eye as he rushed into the Demonic Cloud, and a moment later, Pei Wen Xuan’s muffled grunts clearly rang out.

On the other side, Su Ying Xue went straight to Luan Bai Feng before the two women engaged in a fierce battle.

Unlike how Qing Kui had proclaimed that he would beat Pei Wen Xuan, he had to hold back a bit in order to avoid killing him. In the end, Pei Wen Xuan was still a Core Disciple of Myriad Demons Heaven, so if he were to die, it would definitely cause a huge stir.

The current battle between Void Land and Heavenly Sword Union was all because of the death of a Core Disciple, and this was only possibly because of Yin-Yang Cave Heaven applying political pressure from the background. If it weren’t for Yin-Yang Cave Heaven, Void Land wouldn’t be facing Heavenly Sword Union, but Thousand Crane Paradise.

Su Ying Xue, on the other hand, didn’t need to worry too much about this. When she attacked, her killing intent surged and every move she made was deadly.

However, Luan Bai Feng didn’t dare to say anything to her and could only try to resolve the situation on her own. Fortunately, Luan Bai Feng was no pushover. Although her background wasn’t as high as Su Ying Xue’s, her Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm cultivator was extremely profound. For a time, the fight between the two as they exchanged moves one after another was quite a spectacular sight.

Zuo Quan Hui had sent Pei Wen Xuan and Luan Bai Feng as a last resort, but they were unable to finish their mission. Furthermore, the Sixth-Order Open Heaven Realm Masters he had sent out were also being preoccupied with different opponents, and were unable to extricate themselves.

As for those below the Sixth-Order, they were suffering heavy casualties because they were outnumbered.

Inside the Heavenly Sword Palace, Zuo Quan Hui’s face was so dark and gloomy that it looked as if it could blot out light from the entire world.
