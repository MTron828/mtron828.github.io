“Sir, Hua Fei Chen is an Elder of the Netherworld Sect. He became a Second-Order Emperor close to a hundred years ago and is now a renowned Master. Not only that, but Yin Le Sheng is now an Emperor Realm Master too. It would be best to stay away from them, Sir.” Yang Kai’s reaction stunned Qi He Feng; he had never met someone so ignorant to the immensity of Heaven and Earth. Yang Kai was clearly just a newly promoted Emperor Realm Master, yet he dared to take Hua Fei Chen lightly.

“Sir, it would be best to leave here first and think of a plan later,” Qi He Feng urged.

“Yin Le Sheng also broke through to the Emperor Realm?” Yang Kai frowned, “When did that happen?”

“We are uncertain of the exact time, but we do know that he was an Emperor Realm Master when he left the Shattered Star Sea,” Qi He Feng responded.

“It seems that he had quite a few fortuitous encounters there,” Yang Kai mused to himself.

When they were in the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Le Sheng was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master. Yang Kai himself was only able to break through after witnessing the battle between two Great Emperors and studying the auras released by the clash. He wondered what kind of fortuitous encounter Yin Le Sheng had.

However, he wasn’t very surprised, as the Shattered Star Sea was filled with opportunities, and Yin Le Sheng had a good aptitude.

After sorting out his thoughts, Yang Kai bent down and lifted the wrinkly-faced man’s chin, forcing him to meet his gaze. Next, Yang Kai’s right eye flashed with golden light as he released some Spiritual Energy and pressured the other’s consciousness.

“Are you from the Netherworld Sect?” Yang Kai asked.

As a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, how could the wrinkly-faced man resist? He succumbed and responded within a breath.

“Yes.”

“Am I the reason you guys came to the Ancient Lands Passageway?”

“Yes.”

“How many people are there, and are there any Emperor Realm Masters other than Hua Fei Chen and Yin Le Sheng?”

“Twenty-five people came. Other than Elder Hua and Senior Brother Yin, there are no Emperor Realm Masters.”

Yang Kai coldly snorted, “Is Yin Le Sheng stupid? He thinks this Young Master can be defeated with just that? What paltry tricks do you have in store for me?”

“My fellow Brothers will set up the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array. Once you are trapped inside, Elder Hua and Senior Brother Yin will enter and personally kill you,” the wrinkly-faced man responded.

“The Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array!” Qi He Feng suddenly exclaimed.

Yang Kai looked at him, “What kind of Spirit Array is that?”

“It is one of the Netherworld Sect’s most powerful Trapping Arrays. Once it is set up, the person inside would be suppressed inside like a ghost and have their vitality constantly sucked out of them. Moreover, the area covered by the array will be completely isolated from the outside world, making it impossible to break out,” Qi He Feng explained with a strange expression on his face.

Afterward, he frowned and added, “Why would they use the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array… isn’t that going too far?”

Evidently, in Qi He Feng’s eyes, Hua Fei Chen was already giving Yang Kai enough face by dealing with him personally; after all, no matter how powerful Yang Kai was, it should be impossible for him to escape a First and Second-Order Emperor Realm Masters’ siege. Sooner or later, he would be brought down.

The collaboration of the two was more than enough to capture Yang Kai, so why did they decide to set up the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array too? One must know that the setting up the array required the use of Netherworld Purgatory Banners that the disciples of the Netherworld Sect needed to refine using their own Blood Essence.

If the array was broken, the artifacts would be destroyed completely, and each disciple would suffer the Ten Thousand Ghost Biting Backlash that made life feel worse than death.

The Sect Defending Array covering the Netherworld Sect itself was a gigantic Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array with three Emperor Artifact rank Netherworld Purgatory Banners as its Cores. If an outsider was to invade, the array would activate and trap them inside with no way to escape.

Thus, the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array set up using over twenty Netherworld Sect disciples was undoubtedly formidable.

Was Yang Kai so powerful that the Netherworld Sect had to take such extreme measures to deal with him? Qi He Feng simply couldn’t figure it out.

However, what he didn’t know was that Yin Le Sheng had insisted on using this array because he knew Yang Kai was proficient at using Space Principles. Hua Fei Chen might be stronger than Yang Kai, but wanting to kill him without cutting off his path of escape was all but impossible.

Since ancient times, cultivators who were proficient in the Dao of Space were the hardest to deal with. In order to kill them, one must first think of a way to seal them in a certain region in order to prevent them from simply escaping.

“Isolated from the outside world… Hmph,” Yang Kai coldly snorted. He immediately understood what the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array was for.

“Sir, you should retreat. If your purpose for entering the Ancient Lands is to look for something, our Qi Family Fort can help. You would only need to wait for our message,” Qi He Feng said, looking at Yang Kai eagerly.

He believed that with Yang Kai’s current strength, throwing himself into the array would be the same as throwing himself into a grave.

“Your Qi Family Fort cannot help with what I’m seeking.” Yang Kai shook his head.

He was not looking for treasure, but Xiao Xiao. How could he let the Qi Family Fort help with that?

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s outstretched hand jerked, and the wrinkly-faced man immediately fell over. On the outside, there was not the slightest sign of injury, but his insides had already turned to dust. He couldn’t be more dead.

“Let’s go,” Yang Kai said to Zhang Ruo Xi and Old Ban. There was nothing more he needed to know. As he spoke, he wrapped his Emperor Qi around the two and disappeared like a ghost.

“Sir! Sir!” Qi He Feng yelled twice, but Yang Kai had already left. Qi He Feng ran out after him, but the strange fog quickly obstructed his sight and Divine Sense. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Qi He Feng stood in one spot for a moment, then he stamped his foot and quickly went on his way.

It would be impossible to find Yang Kai again. He had waited inside the cave for him, but now that he was gone, so Qi He Feng had to send word back to Qi Family Fort as soon as possible so that the Young Fort Lord could decide what to do next.

…..

Fifty kilometres away from the original location of Yang Kai’s group, in another cave.

This cave was much larger than the one Yang Kai’s group hid and could accommodate over twenty without feeling crowded.

The people inside the cave were all wearing the same clothes and were from the same Sect.

Their leader was a Second-Order Emperor who was wearing a traditional-style robe. He appeared to be around fifty years old, but his face looked rosy and young.

This person was Elder Hua Fei Chen of the Netherworld Sect.

Sitting beside him was Yin Le Sheng, whose venomous gaze had been staring into the surging strange fog as though wanting to pierce through its depths. There was a cold and unsettling smile on his face.

Whenever he recalled his encounter with Yang Kai in the Shattered Star Sea, he would have trouble eating and sleeping.

He had never suffered such a great loss since he became a cultivator. He had always been the one to crush others with absolute strength and never expected that one day, someone of the same level would oppress him.

He couldn’t stand it.

Worse, in order to survive last time, he even had to lower himself and flatter Yang Kai. Yin Le Sheng reckoned that if he didn’t have information Yang Kai was interested in, he would’ve died at that time. In the end, he had to rely on a Soul Contract to stay alive.

Back when they were in the Starlight Corridor, Yang Kai wasn’t his match at all. He never expected that in just less than ten years, Yang Kai would advance to such heights.

Who knew how monstrous Yang Kai would become if he was given a few more years? Thus, Yin Le Sheng had to get rid of Yang Kai once and for all, like cutting weeds and pulling out their roots. Yin Le Sheng was certain that if he allowed Yang Kai to grow further, his life would become exceedingly difficult.

Therefore, as soon as he returned to his Sect, he asked his Honoured Master to send Elder Hua Fei Chen to the Ancient Lands Passageway with over twenty disciples to help him kill Yang Kai.

With the assistance of Hua Fei Chen, the Heavenly Net Absolute Sealing Array, and his own trump cards, there was no way Yang Kai would be able to survive!

Yin Le Sheng could already imagine the wonderful scene of Yang Kai falling to his knees and begging for mercy.

Suddenly, a loud voice shouted, “Elder, we have bad news!”

His reverie interrupted, Yin Le Sheng was somewhat displeased and turned to see a Netherworld Sect disciple standing beside Hua Fei Chen, an ugly expression on his face.

“What’s the matter?” Yin Le Sheng asked with a frown.

Hua Fei Chen also opened his eyes and looked at him calmly.

“Senior Brother Yao… is dead,” the disciple said in a trembling voice

“Who killed him?” Yin Le Sheng asked.

Although there were many hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the Ancient Lands Passageway, the Netherworld Sect was a name that caused those in the Eastern Territory to tremble and obey. Who would dare to kill one of their disciples so casually?

“It seems to be… this man,” said the disciple, revealing a bead in his palm. An illusory phantom appeared from it, reflecting the scene of Yang Kai’s hand crushing the wrinkly-faced man’s five viscera and six organs.

This was a mysterious technique that could replay the scene of the wrinkly-faced man’s death clearly to Hua Fei Chen and his group.

“Yang Kai…” Yin Le Sheng clenched his teeth, glaring at the image of Yang Kai in the illusory image. His eyes turned red as soon as he saw this enemy of his.

“That’s him! That’s the bastard who bullied this Young Lady! So he really did enter the Ancient Lands Passageway! Hua Fei Chen, you need to catch him so this Young Lady can torture him.” On the other side of the cave, a young red-clothed woman suddenly jumped up and cried out, glaring at Yang Kai’s figure with gnashed teeth.

This young woman was the one who had troubled Old Ban; she had met up with the Netherworld Sect at an unknown time. Old Fu, who was protecting her, was also present; however, the two Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master guards were nowhere in sight, their life or death unknown.

She was only a Third-Order Dao Source Realm Master, yet she showed no respect for Hua Fei Chen, an Emperor Realm Master.

Despite that, Hua Fei Chen wasn’t angry at all. There was only some helplessness in his expression.

Yin Le Sheng turned to the red-clothed girl, the corners of his lips turning upwards as he asked, “Young Lady Lin’er, you mean… The person you want to punish is him?”

“That’s right!” The girl named Lin’er, gritting her teeth, fire almost shooting from her eyes, “I would recognize him even if he turned to ashes! You, hurry up and catch him for me! I want to see him kneel down in front of me and beg for mercy!”
