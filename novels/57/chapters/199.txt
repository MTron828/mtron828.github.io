With a powerful claw strike, Selena scared one of the yetis from his forehead to his abdomen. She landed with a loud thud, her ears flinched and her eyes shifted to the left where the other yeti was charging at her.

Using her feet claws to pin herself to the ground, she drew her fist back. The yeti was charging at her with a powerful kick.

Cain smiled when he was watching that moment, The yeti that was trying to kick Selena had 17 strength while she had 19. He was in for a painful surprise.

Selena punched the yeti's foot as he was trying to kick her, smashing his tibia instantly. It made a crunching noise as the monster's leg bent around Selena's fist.

'That what you get for trying to kick a swinging hammer.' Cain though as he kept observing her with a smile, she had grown more accustomed to fighting with her hands instead or relying on her powerful bite.

GRWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWA! The other yeti roar as it swung his it's claw blindly at Selena. Thud! Selena changed her stance and blocked his palm with her elbow, causing the bones of his palm to shatter like sticks.

With her right hand claws she grabbed the yeti from his broken palm and pulled him toward the ground. The monster smashed his face on the ground as it wasn't able to resist Selena's powerful pull.

From the tree, Cain tried to see what kind of ground Selena was using, her foot claws were nailed down into a rocky platform underneath her. 'Did she think of that or it was just her instincts?' He wondered but it was all good since she managed to hold her own.

She let go of the yeti and turned toward the one who had his leg broken. The yeti gazed at her with all his power, he wanted to at least slow her down. He failed. she didn't even notice nor feel his gaze of how quick her body resisted it. Selena's raging metabolism and high constitution, and muscle density made her extremely hard to freeze.

In a split second she leaped toward the yeti in one massive jump and latched her left claws to his temple. Before the yeti could grab her with his claws. SMACK! She punched him in the middle of his forehead causing it to crack and forcing his consciousnesses out of his brain. The yeti's eyes rolled back just for Selena to interrupter them as sign for him trying to use chilling gaze on her so she made a second punch. SMACK! SMACK! her arm pierced his skull in the third attack killing him instantly.

Seeing his brother get torn apart by this small creature the other yeti made a run for his life. He wasn't ready to face certain death. His instincts screamed that he was the prey while she was the hunter, no, she was the predator.

Thud! Before he know it, Alice had mounted the back of his neck. latching her feet claws deep into his neck so she won't be blown away by the force of the impact. She put both her hands together and dropped down at the yeti's skull causing it to cave-in, a loud cracking noise rang across the forest as the yeti was killed on the spot.

"How could she? Is 19 strength supposed to be this strong?" Alice asked unable to believe what she was witnessing. With 20 strength you can bend metal in your hand like dough and 19 was just below that.

"Most people who have high strength end up lacking the support to fully utilize that power. She had her claws and they can anchor her to whatever surface she want. Kayden and Takeshi both relied on skills and dexterity to be able utilize their strength, she on the other hand can relay on brute force." Cain explained that without such a support she would just get blown backward instead.

Selena quickly returned to Cain while covered in blood and brain matter, she was awaiting his praise her, maybe give a head pat.

Seeing her like that, Cain tried using a spell but the magic failed in his hand.

'Damn it, I always forget the niche spells. I better start using a grimoire like all mages do.' A grimoire was just a small book mages use to write their least used spells so they would find recollecting them easy.

{First-tier magic: [Create water] has been added to the system} [Firebolt]

Instead he poured hot water on her. "Cain we probably should use the tower for that..." Sofia told him.

He stared at her for a moment...'With Selena's 16 constitution she should be able to resist getting a cold easily but...' Cain didn't know what to do, should he tell them it was okay for Selena or just allow the waste of an hour in the bath...

"You're right, I will build it right up." Cain gave up quickly and built the tower immediately. They should be able to afford an hour...what harm could it cause?

Selena rushed inside quickly to rinse the blood from her skin, Cain's hot water was only able to get the big clumps.

Cain and the other took their time to strip in the changing room, he slowly realized it was the first time he was going to see Gracie naked in a bath so he got a bit exited. He decided to stand there and watch her strip.

Alice and Sofia asked him why he was staring at Gracie. they ¬†gave him a weird look and pulled him back into the bath.
