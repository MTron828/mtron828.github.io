It was already morning when Sofia woke up, a sharp pain rang from her lower half up to her shoulders. The moment the tried to move a cramp struck her legs. She looked to the bedside and saw Cain already up and getting ready, “It’s still early, sleep for a bit longer.” Cain said in a gentle voice looking at her writhing in the bed like a cat stretching.

“I’m sore, I don’t think sleep will solve that. I better move a bit.” Sofia replied as she sat up. checking her lower side it was still a bit red.

“Then a bath might help you. Gracie are you outside?” Cain looked at Sofia and then turned toward the door. Gracie immediately entered as he called her, “A bath it is?” She said implying she was listening to what was being said inside the room.

“From when you were there?” Sofia Gasped and Gracie ignored her and walked toward Cain, “Would you want her to have the bath here or downstairs?”

“Here is probably for the best, she seems sore after all,” Cain replied and Sofia stood and rushed toward the to protest about Gracie ignoring her.

“Come Gracie tell her!” Cain said the maid nodded.

“I’m the Headmaid, I’m supposed to sleep inside the same room with the master but thanks to your embarrassment I’m sleeping in the hallway. Please get used to it quickly.” The Headmaid’s main job is to be ready to serve 24/7 for that, she must not leave her master’s side. Even Kings, you Always find the Headmaid standing by their side at all times.

“I will be leaving now. Remember to not give her any weird orders.” Cain said as he left the room and Sofia was looking at him closing the door with wide-open eyes.

“Fine, I will do my best.” Sofia sighed as she thought it was a problem and not anyone else, both Alice and Selena didn’t seem to have a problem with it so she has to be the one pushing things too far.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In reality, Alice was used to maids as she lived her whole life being cared for by them. Having one now helps her bath or stay in the same room was comforting if nothing else. Selena on the other hand didn’t mind at all, instead, she was hoping Cain could get more girls as the bigger his pride grow, the more she can brag about it.

As Cain got downstairs he was met by Sebas who seems to have woken early, “Good morning master, The room is ready.” Sebas bowed slightly. Cain smiled and tapped him on the shoulder.

“Good, I believe you have dealt with the cost?”

“Yes, it was a little over a hundred gold coins in total. I didn’t pay it all from your money though, Lord Leon seems to have caught wind of that and paid half. He said to make sure Alice is happy.” Sebas pulled some papers from his pocket and handed them to Cain, They were a list with detailed costs of everything, the bill.

“From today that room is called the Alchemy room. I’m going to eat breakfast so send the five unallocated servants my way.” Cain turned around and headed toward the kitchen.

Seeing his master leave Sebas sighed, “He is going to have dinner in the kitchen again, I hope at least he asks us to bring it to the dining room.” Sebas was worried about his master’s manner, he didn’t seem to act like a noble at all. “How could I bring that to him without sounding rude.”

Sebas brought them to Cain as he was eating, a sad look washed over the old butler’s face as he saw his master downing yesterday’s break with milk and eggs. He looked around and the maids had a concerned look on their faces.

“Here they are, feel free to use them as you wish,” Sebas said lining the five girls in front of him.

Cain slowly lifted his head and glared at them, “I have an alchemy lab, who wants to work there? Consider that you might be working with lethal toxins and unknown concoctions. I will do my best to teach whoever chose to work there.” Cain said as he took a big gulp of his milk.

The five girls were Amaya Bennett, Scarlett Holmes, Lucy Brooks, Lia Butler, and Olivia Hamilton. Cain looked at them studying each of their movements and gestures. It was apparent that they were nervous, this was a weird occupation to have.

One of them lifted her hand, she was Olivia Hamilton. “You can speak.”

“Well master, none of us has the slightest knowledge about alchemy. We expected things like tailor or jester, we have even prepared to be dancers or pet keepers.” She was kind right as those were the odd jobs a noble usually gave, a tailor is someone who fixes clothes. A jester’s job is to entertain the housemaster either by jokes or by making a fool of themselves. A dancer will dance for the master and they can usually sing as well. And lastly, pet keepers will take care of the master’s pets, usually dogs and horses, some call them stable-masters when they are only tending to horses.

“I will be the one teaching you, as long as you follow the recipes, nothing will explode. So who wants to take the job?” They all looked at each other when they heard his words, who of them will take such a dangerous and delicate job?

“Master if I may say,” Sebas said walking close to Cain and whispering in his ears.

“I believe Olivia would be the most suited for this job, she is both good with her hands and patient.”

“I wouldn’t make her take the job just because she spoke up,” Cain replied whispering.

“Olivia, want to take the job? You will definitely climb the ranks.” Sebas looked at her with sharp eyes. Ranks were the house hierarchy. Cain is at the top with Alice, Sofia, and Selena his wives being with him. Albeit Cain is seen as the top. Directly followed by Sebas and Gracie. However, Gracie is considered a bit higher than Sebas as she has access to Cain’s private life making her closer in rank to the wives. and then the rest of the maids and workers. And at the bottom sat the five of them.

“Master, how high do you think we Can get them?” Sebas asked.

Cain thought about it for a moment, “Depends on how much they learn and how respectful they are. They can even climb to be the same level as you.” Cain said. Sebas was the butler, the person who oversee the inner problems of the house. If Olivia, for example, was to become the alchemist she will definitely be as important if not more than him.

“I will take, pleased to work for you,” Olivia said with a deep bow.

Seeing her Cain smiled and looked at the rest, “then this is it for this time, I will soon find positions for the rest of you. Olivia, you stay and the rest can leave.”

As the other four left the kitchen Cain finished his food while both Olivia and Sebas were standing by his side waiting. “Sebas lead the way to the alchemy lab, Zaleria comes with us.” As Cain said that Zaleria walked from the door, “Did you call me?”

“Yeah, I did. I will be enchanting your nails now so follow us.” The three of them followed Sebas. With each step, Olivia’s anxiety grew.
