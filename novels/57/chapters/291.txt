“Just so you know, there is an evolution called high human. It seems to be an improved version of humans that focuses mostly on magic.” Cain explained as he rode the horse closer to his father.

“Like a high elf but for humans? Where did you hear of that?” Chad asked, hearing that something like that existed piqued his interest.

“I only discovered it a few weeks ago, I seem to have inherited those genetics from my mother,” Cain said as he stared at the trees in the distance.

Chad thought for a moment. “I don’t seem to remember her looking any different than other people.”

“White hair, blue eyes, and pale skin. All high humans lack the comical solution that gives the body its color. That results in them having an affinity for nothing and everything related to magic. Like a white paper that you draw anything on.” Cain explained.

“That’s from your experiment, if your mother was really a high human, she should be a natural born one, just like you I guess. Is there a chance that the whiteness is a feature specific to you and her?” Chad asked with a serious face.

“I won’t deny that it’s possible, I did the experiment only on myself. I would usually prefer to test on at least ten subjects before making an assumption.” Cain replied as he slowly pulled his sword. Both Sofia and Chad noticed that something was up ahead.

“Or I might have been…” Cain suddenly disappeared from his horse and teleported behind the trees.

“Oga Boga!” Cain yelled at the snow apes that were hiding in the trees.

OOO! The apes squealed as they heard the sudden scream. They immediately turned and held their rocks high. The ambush failed and they started going mental. Cain counted more than thirty apes surrounding him.

“Let’s play a bit!” Cain swung his sword in a circle and chanted something incomprehensible to the apes. [Fly] [Firebolt: Multi-cast]

Cain’s body started to float as small dots of flames appeared around his shoulders. BANG! He started shooting the fire bolts at the apes repeatedly while slowly floating around.

The apes ducked behind the trees to avoid the Firebolt shower that Cain was unleashing at them.

[Telekinesis] Cain let go of his sword that started floating in front of him. [Fireblade] The sword burst into flames. “Try hiding from this!” Cain released the sword at them, the blade flew behind the trees and slashed one of the apes in half. The remaining apes tried to run away but the sword kept chasing them.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

OOO! An ape jumped at Cain from behind and grabbed his head. [Enchanting: Electric discharge] The ape was immediately shocked to death.

“Careful there, my whole body is enchanted with enough lightning to fry an elephant.” Cain started at the charred corpse.

Looking in the distance, Cain saw his father and Sofia fighting as well. Sofia seems to have learned to keep her distance and shoot them down with Firebolt. That was a noticeable growth on her part.

His father on the other hand…’What is he doing?’

Chad was exchanging punches with a silverback snow gorilla.

The gorilla grabbed Chad by the leg and swung him around like a stick. Chad twisted his hips and tried to get a punch in but the gorilla slammed him to the ground.

Thud! Chad dodged a direct punch and retaliated with a straight kick to the face. The gorilla growled in pain as her left fang shattered.

Chad was not using his foresight to save MP, he was only relying on brute force as he did in his fight with Zaleria. His actions seemed stupid to Cain, why hold back and have a fistfight while you can finish the fight quickly with a second-tier spell?

Chad swung a fist at the gorilla but it jumped away and picked a stone, throwing it directly at Chad. Crack! A backhand fist was all he needed to shatter the stone to pieces.

“AWAAA!” Chad yelled at the top of his lungs and he leaped forward with a direct punch.

The gorilla opened her jaw to go for a bite. The moment Chad’s fist was connected with the inside of the gorilla’s mouth, its head flew away.

Cain was standing beside the gorilla with his sword in hand. “Why did you cut its head?” Chad growled.

“I should be the one asking, why aren’t you finishing the fight immediately?” Cain asked.

“This is my training grind, monsters are tougher than humans!” Chad said with a stern face.

“Don’t do it while we don’t have a healer then, what if the gorilla’s teeth had some kind of disease?” Cain asked with a serious face. Animals carry enough fatal diseases but monsters carry a whole another stinky bowl of magical death.

“I don’t get sick that often!” Chad declared.

“I don’t want to deal with deciphering a cure for a magical disease!” Cain stared at him.

“Fine, I will use my sword next time!”

“Are you two done? Can we keep moving, I hate the smell of charred flesh!” Sofia called them out. She was standing in the middle of the apes’ burned corpses she took a lot of them down.

Cain opened an arcane gate and used [Telekinesis] to throw all the corpses into the maze and turn them into undead for Amaya to use.

After that, they resumed their trip amidst the snow, this time Cain decided to keep an eye on their surroundings to avoid any unnecessary fights. After traveling for the whole day, it was almost nightfall.

“At this rate, we will reach the western mountain in the middle of the night, I say we came here and resume tomorrow,” Cain suggested as he stopped his horse.

“You’re right, it’s better to fight in the daylight.” Chad stopped his horse. “I will set the camp so you gather firewood.”

“No need for that, I can do this!” [Lisworth’s magnificent mansion] “Feel free to use this, it has all that you need for the night!” Cain asked his father to spend the night in the mansion.

“What about you two?” Chad stared at Cain and Sofia. He couldn’t leave his son sleeping in the snow.

“We will use this, I need to stay in the real world to keep detecting our surroundings!” Cain lifted his forearm and cast [Lisworth’s tower]

The tower got erected from the ground immediately. Chad only stared in awe, “Two camping spells, did you really have the money and time to learn them?”

“I created them, they even have our last name.” Cain stared at his father. Deep down Cain knew that he only created the tower to flex on the elves so his father wasn’t wrong.

After a short chat, Chad excused himself to the mansion to rest. Cain took the chance to call his scouts.

[Summon lesser Devil: Spindle]

“M-master…Did you… it’s freezing cold!” Spindle cried as he stood barefoot in the snow.

“Sorry for calling you to such a place, I need some devils to keep guards. Do you have any recommendations?” Cain asked Spindle.

“Devils…in ice?” Spindle thought for a moment, “Ice Mephits, Spindle heard about them. Ice elements that have been banished to the eighth layer of hell.”

“The eighth layer? Where the Ice devil lord resides? It’s true if they survived there spending a single night in the snow will be a cakewalk for them. Thanks, I will summon them.” Cain said as he dismissed the shaking spindle before he turns into a popsicle. Cain then summoned a bunch of Ice mephitis to guard the area.

“Can we get in, I’m freezing!” Sofia said as she pulled on Cain’s arm.

“You getting cold? Please stop joking like that, I know what you want so let’s head inside quickly!” The two of them rushed into the tower with quickened steps.

Just like he did the first time, Cain created a two layers tower. The first floor was a bath and the second one was a bedroom with all that they might need.

The moment they entered, Cain locked the door behind them and started taking off his armor. His body was itching for a hot bath after spending a day riding in the snow.

Sofia quickly took her boots off and helped him undo the straps on his back.

“Let’s get into the bath quickly…” Sofia dragged Cain toward the bath with a wide grin on her blushing face.
