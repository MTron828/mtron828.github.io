Ôªø496 A deal with the monster

Cain transformed into the abominable chimera, "Today it ends, I shall make sure you never rise again."

~Cain, we got the phylactery. Dispater ran away before we could finish him~ A message reached him from Ariel, the hell mission was a success.

Cain did know that the lord of the second Layer Dis, Dispater had a unique ability. Ironfication is the ability to turn anything he touches into pure iron.

That was the bulk of his strength, and luckily it was useless against those three he sent. Ariel was an angel with high resistance and she could fight at full power in hell. Kayden has fast regeneration and is a demon, he could survive having an arm petrified. And lastly his father Chad, such a status effect wouldn't work on him.

"Die!" Morena growled breathing a blast of acid on Cain's chimera.

[Telekinesis] the breath goes deflected with an invisible force. Tentacles rushed from Cain's lower torso and tied Morena down. The more she struggled, the tighter he squished her.

RROOOAR! RRROOAR! The girls could hear her screams from beneath Cain's tentacle barrier, it wasn't a fight anymore. It was just her trying to survive.

The dark stars Cain released earlier rushed in and tore Morena's limbs off, she was struggling a bit too much. "Sit still, it won't hurt as long as you be obedient," Cain said with a booming voice.

"Hell no!" Morena yelled as her body swelled, BAM! She exploded in a massive blast of acid. Cain's was fine as his chimera body was covered in a thin layer of [Prismatic dome]

Now that he has a lot of MP and High-speed mana regeneration, it was possible for him to waste MP by melding ninth-tier spells and changing them.

Cain suddenly felt a horrible headache in his stomach, His need to sleep and adjust to his new Mana circulation, the increase was too much to have easily.

The moment Morena resurrected in her human form, Cain leaped and bit her off without a second thought. Inside his mouth, he blasted her with a [Sleep] spell that was magnified to the ninth tier with enchanting.

With this, digesting her only took a few seconds.

'Better keep those to grant spells to the girls, bet, some would need them‚Ä¶' Cain reverted back to his humanoid form bleeding from every pore in his body.

Even if he was a chimera, leaping from 4000 MP to 14000 MP and increasing his MP regeneration by around 25 times was just too much. Right now, his body was almost falling apart.

"Cain!" the girls yelled rushing at him. But then, he flicked his fingers. Click! They found themselves back in Furberg.

Now alone on the battlefield in the middle of hordes of sinners and devils. Cain stared at the red sky clearing. His vision was blurry.

Thud! A short, red-haired girl landed on his stomach glaring down at his face. "You look as dead as a fish, no, an octopus. Was that transformation a part Aboleth?" Lilia asked while giggling.

~Don't‚Ä¶need me to answer~

Cain replied with [Message] as speaking from his blood-filled mouth was impossible.

"Why did you send them away? Was that supposed to protect them from me?" Lilia asked staring in Furberg's direction. She could still sense the girls from that distance.

~What brought you here?~ Cain asked.

ROAR! One of the sinners rushed at them trying to attack.

Lilia glared at him, "At least wear some pants‚Ä¶ prismatic expansion." A crystal barrier appeared around her and Cain, and rapidly expanded, pushing all the sinners away and crushing them.

"Curiosity, what are? Monster." Lilia asked with a smile.

~A friend of Sylph~

Lilia glared at him and then sat on his stomach cross-legged. "Shame, Shame, you use the system. Though I finally found someone like me."

~You would have killed me already if that was the case~

As Cain replied, she kicked him in the face, "Shut up, I'm thinking kid."

~Cain you off me? I'm kind of dying here~

"Like I care‚Ä¶" She said glaring at his chest.

~Then how about this?~

#24]!"¬£$%^^&^ ^%$¬£~~~!"¬£$

A piece of information entered Lilia's head through a means different than [Message] or normal speech or telepathy.

Lilia instantly stared at Cain's face with a weird look.

"Not worth the risk‚Ä¶but it seems interesting. You got a deal." Lilia stood up, still standing on Cain.

~You accepted rather easily considering the low pay‚Ä¶~

"I can get my hand on anything but that thing. If your stupid idea worked and we got her‚Ä¶things are fun, fun!" She glared down at him.

Lilia then looked around, "Want me to clear this mess?"

~If you can. Also could heal me a bit ~

"Fine, but payment first." Lilia stared at him.

Cain flicked his fingers and a small orb of light appeared. Lilia immediately grabbed it and smiled.

Here you go, in an instant, the ground started moving, the sky clouded with dark clouds, and started to rain. The violent wind a flood cleared the blood and guts from the area.

In a matter of seconds, the deserted area has become a green hill filled with grass and a soothing breeze.

"See you soon, Enchanter." Lilia disappeared.

Cain could feel a bit better, she healed his body just enough that he could move.

"Really what brought her here, the monster had me play my card early." He looked around and felt exhausted, [Teleport]

He returned to Furberg.

Upon appearing in his mansion, he found Alice, Sofia, and Selena panicking at what happened.

"Cain!" They all leaped on him, "What happened?"

"Nothing important, just a passing magical disaster going by the name of Lilia," Cain replied with an annoyed face.

"Your old master? Was she there?" Alice asked with a worried face.

"Yeah, don't know how she sniffed us but luckily it went well," Cain replied.

After a while, Chad, Ariel, and Kayden returned from their expedition to hell. Zaleria and Mary seem to have captured Lola as well.

Everyone gathered in the dining hall staring at each other, "We need to rest for some time, after that, I will go to hell and find Malta for Spindle and grind some levels." Cain said looking at them.

"You still think of work? You need to rest for a bit!" Sofia glared at him.

"I know, I said we need to rest. I already received a massive boost and I have some meals to digest." Cain replied.

"What about the aftermath?" Alice asked.

"I brought Sara and Noel for a reason, let them deal with it. After we rest and get Spindle's problem settled, will have Jack lead us across the sea to the elvish kingdom. Our true mission starts there." Cain said with a serious face.

"Lady Sylph is waiting patiently, we must not let her wait any longer," Farryn said with a proud face.

"Father, how did the fight in hell go?" Cain asked.

"Well, that's a short story. I punched him until he ran and then we located the phylntry!" Chad replied.

"Phylactery‚Ä¶" Cain said.

"I don't concern myself with such names‚Ä¶" Chad replied with a smile.
