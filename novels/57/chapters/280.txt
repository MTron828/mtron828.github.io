“That isn’t an excuse. I will have you tied down to a tree!” Alice jumped to grab Elsie.

“Gracie do something!” Elsie called Gracie, she was probably the only one with enough power to save her.

“Lady Alice I have a rope,” Gracie handed a rope to Alice immediately. Elsie didn’t even know where she was hiding such a thing.

Realizing that her chances have diminished, Elsie cried “Look at him, do you want him to look like that at the wedding?”

Alice looked back at Cain and wondered what she should do.

“Even Sebas has commented that Master shouldn’t be eating in the kitchen but in the dining hall. He is technically a noble now and it’s your duty to make sure he acts the part!” Elsie kept pushing forward.

Marriage between commoners and nobles is not a new thing. It is widely spread throughout the kingdom. When a noble marry a commoner, it is the noble duty to assure the commoner act as a noble to not disgrace the family.

For example, if a nobleman married a commoner woman, he will have her learn ethics, dancing, art, and a whole lot of other things. It will be his duty to make sure his wife integrates well into the nobility life.

The reverse was also true. For example when a valiant knight marries the daughter of a lord. It’s her duty to make sure her husband acts like a noble. Cain and Alice were in this situation albeit a bit different.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Cain seemed to know the nobility’s ethics but rarely follow them. He wasn’t a commoner who knew no better, he was a noble who didn’t care about nobility.

Now Alice being the only noble one in the family, it was her duty to make sure Cain, Sofia, and Selena follow in her example.

“Master you as well, Cain you just stop this?” Elsie called Cain directly. She knew well that he wasn’t stupid and just messing around.

Cain slowly stood up while carrying his carrot. “Let her go, I was just looking for a light meal, I didn’t have lunch after all.”

Alice stared at him, “Elsie, when will the food be ready?”

“About two hours, he could go have a bath and relax a bit in the meantime,” Elsie replied, as she felt relieved. The situation finally seemed to be calming down a bit.

“That won’t do, I need something to eat right here right now!” Cain exclaimed. His stomach was growling, and he could not wait a whole two hours.

“You have already eaten enough, can’t wait?” Alice stared at him and then at the half-eaten mound of vegetables.

“What is going on?” Sofia suddenly entered the kitchen and Cain rushed toward her half crying.

“Sofia…They are starving me, make me a sandwich.”

Sofia looked at him confused, “W-why not. Lexi has prepared the bath so you go there and I will bring a sandwich as soon as it is ready.” Sofia patted Cain on the head and then dismissed him toward the bath.

“Care to explain what happened?” Sofia glared at them with a piercing gaze.

After hearing what they had to say, her head was steaming. “Elsie you’re a maid, right? Your job is to follow Cain’s orders not think about how he acts! You as well Alice, who cares about eating in the kitchen or the hall, we’re in our home so he can do however he pleases.” Sofia lashed at them, “Look here at Gracie, that’s how a maid is supposed to act. And I believe you could have made a salad for him!” Glaring at Alice and Elsie.

“Sorry, we should have acted differently.” Alice apologized. Sofia was right. She should prioritize Cain first.

“Katherine come help me make the sandwich.” Sofia sighed as she grabbed a knife.

…

Cain went inside the bath, Lexi and Amaya were awaiting his arrival in the changing room. “I haven’t seen you in a while, Lexi, how have your family been?” Cain asked her.

“They are doing great thanks to you, even since the last incident the villages haven’t been attacked again,” Lexi replied with a smile.

Lexi and Amaya helped Cain take his clothes off, he had been too exhausted to bother struggling with his leather armor.

After helping Cain out, both of them prepared to join him in the bath. Since Alice is busy with the wedding preparation, Selena is having some business in her village and Sofia didn’t show up for some reason.

It was the maids’ job to take care of the master when his wives aren’t available. Cain didn’t seem to mind them and instead just let them wash him. In all honestly, he was too hungry and exhausted to bother wasting the opportunity.

As they were washing him, Cain snuck some looks at Amaya’s body to check for any abnormalities. To his luck, he found none. It was possible for something to change over time so he had to be careful.

After that they walked into the hot water, Cain slowly dipped himself in and relaxed his arms. Lexi sat to his right and Amaya to his left.

Lexi clung closely while Amaya kept a shy distance between them. Feeling Lexi’s side touching him he turned toward her, “Sofia might not take this lightly.” Said Cain. He would have preferred it to be like how Amaya is doing it. They can get in the bath with him but respecting the personal space is appreciated.

“Lady Sofia won’t mind, we already got her permission to care for you in the bath,” Lexi replied.

“I could swear she meant only washing and keeping an eye on me in case something happen. Seeing something like this will set her off.” Cain replied as he glared at Lexi. He quickly relaxed.

“Fine do what you want.” He gave her permission to stay, it’s not like he hated her being close to him, it will just cause unnecessary trouble.

“Cain I brought the food.” Sofia suddenly opened the bath door and saw Lexi stuck to Cain’s side like a cat.

“What are you doing?” Sofia growled as a faint flame emerged from her nose.

“Taking a bath with the maids, Care to join?” Cain replied and Lexi’s face went pale.

Sofia sighed as she calmed herself down, “Here is the sandwich you asked for. Lexi, Can you come here for a moment?”

Lexi awkwardly went to Sofia, her legs were shaking a bit. She couldn’t imagine what was going to happen to her. “I won’t lie to you, I’m steaming over this. I believe I said you can help him bath not rub him with your body.” Sofia’s stare was chilling. Cain secretly prepared his magic to shield Lexi in case Sofia decided to hit her.

Half dragons were known for their wild temper, especially half-red dragons. The flame emerging from her nose earlier was a great example of such a thing.

“Sorry, I just…” Lexi didn’t find words to answer with. Cain did warn her but she didn’t listen.

“Fine, as long as you understand. I wish I was as accepting as Selena…Or can I?” Sofia suddenly stared at Lexi with a thinking face.

Sofia gently grabbed Lexi’s cheek in her palms and stared at her eyes. “You can stay with him, but don’t do anything unnecessary by telling me. Do you know what I mean?” Sofia said with a sharp grin.

“I understand,” Lexi replied in confusion. “And you as well.” Sofia stared at Amaya on the side.

“What do you mean?” Amaya replied with a confused face.

“Don’t try, Charisma won’t work on her. You can have my word instead.” Cain said with an exhausted look. ‘When did she get this good at using her charisma?’

“You know what? I’m coming in as well.” Sofia rushed to the changing room to drop her clothes.
