“I have to check this later with William, those papers are suspicious,” Cain said as he flipped the paper under his magical light.

“To think she gave the entire bath to Sofia, what a nice old lady she was,” Chad said with a smile.

“What are you saying? Those are clearly fake!” Sofia said looking at the old papers. Her name was clearly handwritten there just a while ago.

“But I don’t see the old name anywhere, this is strange,” Cain added. He forged a lot of papers in his life to tell, those are fake in a strange way. It was better to let an expert take a look at them, William might even have a copy of the original document.

Cain then shifted his attention toward the magic inscription, they were honestly like a kid trying to draw armor from memory. Just a mess.

“What is this part saying to increase heat and pressure on the matter until it explodes? And what is this part about it leaving a permanent mutation effect on the area affected by the explosion, I never heard of such an effect.” Cain could barely make sense of the scribbles on the paper, they all had the same notion of throwing more power in until it works.

“She probably meant something like this.” Sofia used both of her hands to create a small red flame and then heat it until it became blue.

“I don’t see that causing anything to mutate unless she meant cooking or burning but those aren’t mutations,” Cain said with a tired face, those papers were basically useless.

“Maybe I just lack power? I will throw more heat.” Sofia forced enough heat into the small flame until it became white. As the flame shines brighter than Cain’s magical light, Sofia’s face turned bright red as she squeezed her inside.

“Stop that, I don’t want your guts to spill out. Will figure this out later, for now, let’s head back.” Cain said as he feared Sofia will let something else out from the strained look on her face.

Chad stared at them silently, he then looked at the sky. “Why did her domain barrier suddenly weaken?” He asked the question that was spinning in his head.

Sofia looked at him for a moment, “A domain? Her expression did change a bit after she showed me something, it was just before she ran away into the Hell Gate.” Sofia explained.

“That skull-shaped thing? Was that her power source?” Chad asked.

“That’s most likely since her power weakened upon showing it up. What concern is that it was a skull, usually powerful magic sources are derived from living creatures. That skull must have belonged to someone in the past and he was powerful.” Cain explained and Sofia gave him a confused face.

“I will explain it simpler. Let’s say I die, you can use my blood, hands, or even skull as a magical component. It’s just like how we use troll blood to create healing potions.” Cain smiled remembering how his blood resulted in a powerful healing potion, “I bet my skull will be worth a heavy penny.” Cain laughed.

“Don’t joke like that, I will never let anyone use you like they do magical monsters,” Sofia replied with a stern face, she might be a witch, both Bela and Zaleria mentioned using creatures as material but never Cain.

“Let’s head back I want to rest,” Cain said yawning. Ariel dragged him out of his important discussion with Alice which was less than pleasant.

On their way back, Cain met Alaric who has just finished clearing the goblins.

“It’s been a while, I haven’t seen you in a while.” Cain strangely stopped to greet a small bird.

“Chirp?” the bird looked confused for a moment, even Sofia and Chad has to question Cain’s action.

“You have grown stronger, I bet you killed a lot of the monsters.” Cain smiled.

“This should be an almost perfect shifting, how could you tell?” The bird suddenly spoke in a deep voice scaring both Sofia and Chad.

Cain giggled, “Polymorph, isn’t it? I do agree I’m not a fan of transforming into animals but it’s an easy spell to use.” Cain said with a smile.

“Then show me!” The bird angrily flapped its wings.

“Let’s me try something harder than a bird. I will show you how to use it quickly.” [Polymorph] Cain’s face changed until it resembled that of Alaric in all appearing aspects, “How about this?” Cain even changed his voice.

“Hold up how could you?” The bird snapped.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t worry, I’m just mimicking your hands and head from memory. I also mixed some illusions in the spell to hide the polymorph spell within the fake presence created by the polymorph.”

The bird sighed, immediately shifting back to Alaric, “I admit that you’re the better mage, even though I worked hard on perfecting it.” Alaric looked sad as Cain shifted back to his normal form.

Both Chad and Sofia couldn’t tell the difference in quality between Cain’s polymorph and Alaric’s polymorph. It was such a faint difference that both of them didn’t pick it up.

“If it needed Cain to be discovered, it’s mostly just a minor problem,” Chad said. He was proud that his son is talented in magic but was at the same time sad remembering how he lacks physical strength.

“Outside the hard talk, how are everyone in the village? Your family, are they healthy and how are you doing?” Cain patted Alaric’s shoulder.

“They are doing great thanks to you and William, this is the first time a city respected our presence like this.” Alaric smiled and then mumbled, “Probably since you were the one to introduce us.”

“I bet it has nothing to do with me, William and Leon are different from other lords. They are good people, to an extent.” Cain started having doubts about remembering William’s constant nagging.

“And you?” Alaric smiled, “Expecting a new Cain or what?”

“Little Cain has to wait a bit longer, it will be bad when we’re in constant fighting or travels,” Cain replied with a smile.

“You’re right, even we have strict rules about having kids right before migration. Not that it matters now that we settled down.” It was then that Alaric heard a wolf howl, “I need to go, they are calling me.”

After saying that Alaric shifted into a wolf and rushed to the forest.

…

Back in the mansion, Alice and Katherine were awkwardly waiting for Cain’s return.

“Did you wait for a long time?” Cain smiled as he entered.

“A long time it was indeed, I bet it was something that didn’t need your presence.” Alice was a bit angry, she hated being left hanging.

“In reality, it was a bit complicated and I think I reached late. I will explain it later for you so let’s pick up where we left off.” Cain turned toward Katherine and her face stiffened up.

“So do we start with you or Alice? You might need to wait for a while if I took Alice first.” Cain smiled.

“I’m here to merely assist, please don’t mind me. I will never take the lead from one of the ladies.” Katherine replied.

Alice interfered “Then do say what you came for, I know that you and Amara have your own reasons for being here.”

“Lady Alice it’s just…”

“Just go first, I do want to have my sweet time with Cain so you better hurry!” Alice growled with a smile. She had heard that Cain issued a respectable amount of money to build an orphanage at the request of Marina’s maids. She can’t have her maids be left out, can she?
