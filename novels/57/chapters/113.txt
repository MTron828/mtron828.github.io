Sofia’s body was considerably thinner and softer than Selena’s. Cain could feel the heat surging from her body even though they are in the bath. Gently caressing her abdomen and her thighs, they felt a bit swollen.

“I can sense some muscle developing down here!” Cain whispered to her, she flinched. Those muscles probably developed due to her constant use of burning hands or burning feet in her case.

As he touched her more it became more and more apparent that her hips were getting wider and wider. Unlike the other two, she didn’t have any inhuman futures to take advantage of so Cain tried the traditional way.

She writhed her hips each time his fingers wiggled, her upper body jolted like a snake. Cain kept going further and further, with each move she moaned, “Stop!” but as soon as he slowed down, she gave him a sad look. The bath owner was right.

Just like the other two, he left her hanging at the edge. It helps to build anticipation.

Cain walked toward the hot tub after making sure they have all cleaned up, Alice and Sofia followed him while Selena rushed ahead and plunged headfirst into the water. The water was boiling and the bath was covered in mist. After rinsing in the hot water for a while, Cain reached his hand to Selena who was swimming close to his feet.

There was no Gracie here this time, and he hasn’t done anything in days so he was pent up. Cain thought about what the girls preferred. Selena liked it rough, Alice like to be the dominant, and Sofia liked the passionate embrace. How about switching things up a bit. He made sure to ask them and they agreed on the condition of going back to normal in bed.

Cain’s new switch was like this. Alice would have it rough, Sofia will be dominant and Selena would have.

He wanted to start with Selena as he felt he wasn’t giving her that much love lately. Gently dragging her to his side, she quickly understood what he want. Selena slowly sat on his hips at the side of the bath.

Faintly tickling the base of her tail and ears, his fingers slid down with her twitching. It was clear to him that even with her reaction she wasn’t feeling it that much. Her high constitution was a real problem in those situations.

Going even further, Cain’s hands caress her chest, what looked like gentle grips was him using all his might. With his still low strength, even if he tried to rip them off it felt like gentle tickling to her.

Selena writhed her hips on him, bumping her waist on him up and down asking for it. The low stimulation was slowly washing her mind, she unconsciously turned her head and reached for his mouth.

With a gentle “AH!” She felt him get inside in one go, reaching ever so deep. It’s been a couple of days missing that sensation. She gritted her teeth as she gulped down, her eyes quivering and drool escaping her lips. “meow!”

“AH! OOOO!” She got out a breath as she felt him slowly slide out, her hair stood out as her hips jolted. “AHH!” The moment he re-entered her in one got she felt a wave of pain and pleasure rush down her spine. He’s going slow and rough interchangeably leaving her trembling with anticipation for each thrust. Cain gently grabbed her leg and turned her to face him. She reached for his mouth.

“Please don’t stop-nya!” as their tongue intertwined, massive waves of pleasure burst in her hips as he massaged her insides. “Relax,” Cain whispered in her mouth as they came off.

Cain slowly went for her bosom as his fingers slid into her back door. Without realizing it, she started moving on her own. Each time he pulled out, she would follow him down.

Her legs wrapped tightly around his back, as she wanted him to get deeper. Hugging his neck, she pulled her chest from his mouth and went for a kiss. Her initiative was accepted and she felt Cain tightening his grip on her lower side.

As they slowly picked up the pace, Selena found herself wanting more and more. “More, faster-nya!” As she begged. Cain locked her mouth with a kiss. “Close your eyes and relax, no matter what, don’t move!” Doing as he said she loosened her whole body. Letting him take the lead.

After a few satisfying thrusts, she felt a jolt in her back door. “NYA!” She meowed as her body writhed, the heat accumulated inside her belly as she reached climax from that jolt. With each thrust, she didn’t know if he will go through her front or back door.

“I love it, I love you!” she moaned making Cain hug her even tighter, “I love you as well,” He replied. The two of them kept stuck like that for a while, sucking on each other’s mouths.

“H…H-here it is!” Cain moaned as he picked up the pace, focusing on her front door while having his fingers ravage her sensitive other end and tail. Selena as well started shaking her hips, tightening her inside as she held him in a strong embrace.

“AH!” they both moaned at the last couple of pushes. Selena’s body twisted around as she felt her insides fill up rapidly. Cain took this chance to do a few thrusts between both of her holes forcing her to the last climax before getting to a halt.

The two of them rested for a while stuck like that before finally separating. Cain took a seat to rest while Selena lay on the ground with a satisfied face.

His heart was racing, this was too much of a workout for his recovering body. He gently stroked Selena’s hair. As she felt his hand she woke up, her stamina was in a whole other league than him.

She slowly crawled her head toward his meat and started sucking, Cain didn’t know what she wanted but decided to enjoy it anyway. “AHH!” she was taking him so deep it was unreal. He put one hand on her head pushing her down while his other hand gently stroked her body.

He did hear her gagging but she never resisted, with how strong she is he would know when she is uncomfortable.

This entire time, Cain was focusing on Selena alone, forgetting that the other two were there watching. Alice was sucking on her tail as she used both her hand to please herself. While Sofia had been taking a gentler approach using just one hand while staring at the distance.

Selena suddenly stooped when Cain tried to pull her head up, “Leave them some.” He whispered as he turned around, he didn’t expect to see them drowning in their worlds of pleasure.

Which one he should take first, Sofia or Alice? He quickly decided to go with Sofia, as she would be dominating and give him time to physically rest. Alice on the other hand will require great strength, as he needs to be rough.

Selena pulled her head up and Cain went toward Sofia. He stood in front of her but she didn’t seem to notice him.

“AH! Cain.” As Cain heard her call his name, he knew she was in her fantasy going wild.

“Look at me!” He pulled her hands out and gave her a deep kiss. She quickly jolted back to reality with a beet-red face. “D-did you…”

“Who cares? It’s your turn!” Cain replied as he reached down to her most intimate place.
