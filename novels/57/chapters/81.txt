Covered in veins of arcane blue magic, Cain’s limp arm started to move again.

[Animate dead] is a spell that allows corpses to move by creating a magical nervous system for carrying signals to the bones and forcing the body to move through magic. That spell didn’t need muscles as magic could attach to anything, as long as a skeleton exist, the body will move.

The spider’s poison attacked the nerves in his arm, severely damaging them. The fangs also tore his forearm’s muscles, simply healing it will take a long time.

Since he doesn’t have an hour or two for his arm to heal, Cain decided to force it to move by animating it with [Animate dead]

“As long as I’m still conscious and have enough MP, my body won’t fail to move!” Cain declared as he stood up, sword in hand.

Alice was confused at what he meant, she could feel cursed magic coming from him but she wasn’t able to know that it was necromancy.

[Thunder step] Cain flashed toward the spider, Selena charged at the same time as she noticed him.

[Cursed decay] “I’m able to slow its regeneration but that means no healing for us, don’t get hit!” Alice warned them, that she can’t heal them while still using [Cursed decay] on the spider. If they got severely injured, Alice would stop healing them which will give the spider a chance to heal as well.

[Burning hands] Sofia managed to escape the hordes of Giant ants in a single burst, she flew directly toward the spider.

The spider turned around, flinging a net in Sofia’s direction.

“Those holes need to be closed!” [Earth wall], [Enchanting], [Earth wall], [Enchanting], [Earth wall], [Enchanting], [Earth wall], [Enchanting] Cain created four earth pillars by using Enchanting to simply change the shape of the earth walls. Wedging the things in the spider’s silk holes.

‘Let’s see if you can take them off on your own’ Cain quickly sliced one of the spider legs, and Selena also bit a leg off.

[Fireblade] Extending a blade from her feet, Sofia cut right through the spider web. Finally wedging that blade in the spider’s massive body. with her food wedged inside the spider [Burning hands] releasing all that firepower inside.

Cain quickly followed her with multiple cuts across the spider’s underside. Selena took another leg out causing the spider to fumble around.

“It’s OVER!” Cain screamed, [Fireblade] extending his sword and cutting the spider’s head with a blazing slash.

As soon as the spider died, the dungeon gate crumbled and a fist-sized pearl fell off. The dungeon core, a prof that the dungeon boss was killed.

Cain fell on his ass panting, It was over. The dungeon magic was slowly fading, it will take a couple of hours before it fully disappear.

“Cain!” Alice came rushing to heal his arm, they finally have the time for that.

Sadly the fight wasn’t over, the other monsters still roamed around and they needed to be cleared as well.

“We will take care of them-nya!” Selena said, “She is right, you two just sit there.” Sofia joined her, the two of them fought the monster while Alice was busy healing Cain’s arm.

Cain did use a necromancy spell to force his arm to move but that didn’t mean it was dead. His arm was alive as it still had blood supplies. That won’t be the case for long, if left untreated, the spider’s venom will destroy his nerves beyond repair and kill his arm. At that point, healing magic would be useless.

Cain just downed a healing potion to accelerate the healing process, Alice asked him where did he get the potion and he said it was from the guild. He was lying, it belonged to the adventurers they killed yesterday.

After about half an hour, Cain’s arm was healed enough to take it out of the danger zone. The monsters have also run away as they were beaten by Sofia and Selena.

It seems to be safe for now, with no monsters around they could finally relax.

Sofia fell flat on her face, she was too exhausted to move. “Can we take a short rest, I’m beaten up!”

“Me two-nya! I need a bath-nya!” Selena sat on the ground with an exhausted look on her face.

Cain looked at them and smiled, “I have something that might help.”

[Lisworth’s Tower] With a single flick of his fingers, a two-story tower emerged close to them. The cavern was big enough so Cain could use this spell.

From the outside, the tower looked like a cylindrical tube made of smooth stone slabs. It had a single large metallic door and no windows.

Cain stood with Alice’s help, he was exhausted as well, using thunder-step puts a lot of strain on his body.

“What is this?” Sofia asked. Being amazed at the structure that has just appeared out of nowhere.

“It’s big-nya!” that’s what she said.

“One of my original spells, it will offer us a relatively safe place to rest.” Cain didn’t explain further, seeing it firsthand would be better.

Selena slowly opened the massive still door, CREEEEAK! The door made a loud creaking noise as it was slowly dragged open.

From inside, a cloud of warm vapor rushed out, smelling like something familiar. Inside the tower’s first story they were faced with a fully equipped bath.

The bath was lit with magical light from the ceiling, it had been separated into four sections, a changing room, a shower, and lastly a large bathtub.

Cain was already taking his clothes off, “What are you waiting for? This thing has cost a lot of MP.” Cain looked at their surprised faces. None of them expected magic to be usable like this.

After a quick look at each other, the girls just accepted it and started stripping as well. They won’t complain about a bath after that fight. Sofia made sure to take her jewels off before stripping, it will be bad if Cain lunged at her at that time.

After about half an hour they were all cleaned up and relaxing in the bathtub.

“Is this place safe? monsters won’t try knocking it down, will they?” Alice asked, listening carefully to voices outside, she heard nothing.

“They could try, but if it’s not something like an Alpha gator or a hydra, I doubt they will be able to shake this thing.” Cain knocked at the stone walls, “I did make this thing extremely durable!” He stated.

Cain has made this tower in his past life, designing each section for months. Making something like this shouldn’t be possible with a mere third-level spell. The key was that the spell didn’t make the full tower, It just make a frame when the already made tower is summoned. The real tower is hidden in a pocket dimension that Cain can’t access without a certain ninth-tier spell.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I hope that’s the case,” Sofia said, relaxing in the water.

Selena, on the other hand, was already half-asleep, It must have been an exhausting journey for her who use only her body to fight.

Now that he had a second look at them, he seemed to be oddly energetic down there. ‘No, they must be exhausted!’ He quickly brushed the idea from his mind and decided to relax.

He closed his eyes and laid his head back, all of them were trying to enjoy the hot water, letting their sore limbs have a rest.

Alice noticed the problem with Cain’s tower so she reached with her hand, trying to get a feeling of what was wrong.

“What are you doing?” Cain asked as he felt her hand.

“Just trying to get a feeling, don’t mind me.” She replied naturally, Cain just wanted them to rest.

He then felt another thing touching him, Sofia’s feet were pressing tightly on him. “You too? I’m doing my best to stay calm, if you kept pressing further, things might get ugly!” Cain opened his eyes, “You’re already exhausted.”

Seeing their weird expression, they were also on the edge as well.

With a sigh, Cain slowly stood up. “Sofia, get out of the tub, you too Alice,” Cain ordered and they silently obeyed.

Sofia quickly got on her knees and opened her mouth without him needing to say it, Cain just patted her on the head before proceeding to what he does best.

Cain grabbed her head from the hair and started so lowly push in, Sofia was more than happy to move more violently than that, she quickly started taking it to the base on he own.

Alice slowly stood beside Cain, taking a keep kiss. “There is something I know you hate, would you do it for me?” Cain whispered in her ear.

Alice’s body quivered, “Anything!” She replied without thinking.

“Would mind licking Sofia’s back end? loosen it up well!” as soon as she heard him her face tensed up. She hated to be anywhere near another girl’s back end, to her that was disgusting.

“Do I have to?” She asked, clearing not wanting to do it.

“You don’t, I won’t force you!” Cain replied. He will find another way.

Alice looked at him for a moment, and that stared down at Sofia’s face being shaken so violently.

“Nevermind, I will do it!” Alice changed her mind, “just use the binding to force me, I want to try that!” Alice made a weird suggestion.

Cain looked at her determined eyes for a moment before making his decision.
