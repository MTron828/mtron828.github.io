Cain walked out of the guild with Mary and Olivia in tow, he had bought all he needed and even registered Olivia as an Alchemist.

“Where should we go now? We’ve gotten everything we needed right?” Mary asked Cain as he walked ahead of them.

He turned to her with a puzzled face, he as well didn’t know. All he had arranged for today was getting the ingredients, even the blacksmith trip was Mary’s idea.

“What do you think Olivia? Want to explore the capital?” Cain asked, he had brought her all the way here so sending her back immediately didn’t sound right.

“Actually, I do feel uncomfortable with such a crowd around us. I prefer the quietness of my lab. So I would like to get back to work.” Olivia didn’t seem like the person to be uncomfortable around people but it can’t be helped.

They went to a closed alley where he tried to open a portal for her, “Burr…” The spell failed, He has been wasting too many dungeon cores that he run out…

“We have to use the one at the castle. Mary did happen to know the location of dungeons around here?” Cain looked toward Mary scratching his cheek, he ran out of power.

“I did get a few records from the guild but no map, I should be able to pinpoint them though. Let’s head to the castle as I have them in my room.” Mary smiled.

After that awkward failed spell from the great wizard Cain, they slowly headed toward the Castle. ‘I did know I ran out this morning…How I could forget, now why didn’t I just keep the door open and hide it.’ Cain was frustrated.

Who should he take with him to the dungeons…He can’t take them all. Sofia would have been a great pick if she wasn’t training with Zaleria. He could summon Alice at any time so it was safer to keep her in the castle in case anything happen. Gracie, he had taken her with him last time so she need to stay. Selena was the only choice, they would make a good team with her being the warrior and him being the mage.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He could take Zaleria or his father if he wanted to clear the dungeons as fast as possible, even Nemmoxon would do a great job. He would have loved to create a team with him, Kayden, Alaric, and Reith. That team would be a fun mess. But sadly it was impossible at the time with the other three probably being busy.

Then the thought of taking Farryn with him crossed his mind, ‘that would be a bad idea, I’m sure we would end up fighting’ He shook the stupid idea from his head.

The last time he went with her on an expedition they almost killed each other. Usually in fights, the fighter or warrior keeps the monster busy as the mage prepares his spell. Then depending on if the spell was a de-buff or attack, the battle will be settled. In the case of a de-buff, the fighter will finish the fight and in the case of an attack, it’s most likely the wizard.

Farryn didn’t understand that and kept barking at Cain about how he was stealing her kills and Exp. As time passed he quickly lost his patience and ended up blasting her across the forest. She raged and rushed at him so they fought to the death until Sylph stopped them.

What pissed Cain the most wasn’t her barking at him, it was the fact she was stealing his kills intentionally and then calling him the one stealing her kills. That Hypocrite elf, just thinking about her get him mad.

After they reached the castle, Cain dropped Olivia off with Alice as he headed to the garden looking for Selena. Mary rushed toward her room to get the information he needed.

As Cain entered the garden, he quickly turned around to leave.

“Why are you leaving?” Farryn who was sitting there drinking tea called him.

“I was looking for Selena and she isn’t here, that’s all,” Cain replied as he kept walking.

“Just listen to me idiot, can’t you feel her? she is deeper into the garden chasing some butterflies.” Cain stopped a vein popped in his head, she was already getting on his nerves.

Cain could feel Selena’s presence, he just wanted to avoid Farryn and jumped from the window with magic to hide.

“I know, I will grab her later,” Cain replied as he started walking again, his mind was telling him to leave. Starting a conversation with her in the castle ground was bad.

“Are you going on a mission? Is it about the dungeons you were talking with Mary about earlier?” Farryn walked toward him with steady steps.

‘Her hearing distance is as long as her ears, I should have been more careful.’ Cain kept his calmness.

“I should go with you, it was Sylph’s orders to serve and protect you after all. I hate to say it but she even ordered me to become your slave.” Farryn was serious, this was her mission from Sylph.

“I will be taking Selena with me and that is enough. I also have no intention of enslaving you.” Cain replied. Enslaving her was a bad idea in the long run, at least with how things are now.

“Such stupid human, are you saying a high elf isn’t even worth enslaving? Know your place.” Farryn growled at him.

Cain quickly turned around smoking, ‘You hear that? At first, she asks me to enslave her and then proceeds to insult me.’

“Listen, you and me, can’t think on the same wavelength. If I were to enslave you, I will most of the time end up abusing you by shutting down all your free will or decisions. Doing that will kill any chance of us reaching a productive understanding and will negatively impact our strength in the future.” Cain tried to explain it as simply as he can. He knew Farryn wasn’t the smartest person on the planet.

“Are you saying I can’t even do the job of a slave?” Farryn looked somewhat angry.

“Listen, I say you stay free and move away from my way for the time being.” Cain tried to seem as calm as possible.

“Why is that?” Farryn asked with a puzzled face.

‘Is she stupider than I remember?’ Cain thought inspecting her stats.

————————————–

<Name: Farryn Caiqirelle><Race: High Elf><Level: 82/100>

<HP: 1722><MP: 1558><SP: 2214>

<Strength: 45><Dexterity: 16><Constitution: 28>

<Intelligence: 12><Wisdom: 36><Charisma: 18>

————————————–

‘That explains it, she is definitely dumber than I remember. When I knew her in my past life has already reached level 88 and had her intelligence at 16. Which gave her a much better balance with her wisdom and Charisma.’

“Fine, I will give one order to test you. You wouldn’t mind right?” Cain stared at her, this woman have a problem with challenges.

“What is it? Speak your order.” Farryn said with a confident voice that made Cain’s head hurt.

“This week will be your trial as a slave, you won’t be under any spell so you could disobey me at any time. If you managed to stay obedient until the end of the week. And ask me again after that. I will accept you as a slave.” Cain explained.

“Fine, that just means I can start my work a week early. What is your first order then?” Farryn said proudly. Even though she miscalculated, she will be starting her work on time if she succeeds and never if she failed.

“Go sit in your room until I return.” Cain pointed toward her room and she silently went inside.

Cain sighed as he went to fetch Selena, this whole thing exhausted him more than it needed.
