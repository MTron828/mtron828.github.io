Covered with eldritch flames, Cain’s body started to float slightly beside Alice. The rumbling of his magic was enough to shake the whole mansion! A Large blue magic Circle covered the ceiling of the room.

“I…Cain Lisworth!” Cain started chanting, with each word his magic escalated, It just kept expanding that it seemed about to explode!

At this moment, both Sofia and Yamauba have woken up after sensing Cain’s magic going mental.

“Order thee to bow to my will!” With another expansion in his magic, multiple small magic circles covered his right arms! At this point, glass was shattering in Alice’s room due to the immense pressure Cain was generating.

Daraku was already feeling dizzy being this close to them, “Holy Fu*k! This is even worse than Yamauba going crazy!” He screamed as he grabbed the unconscious maids and took them to safety!

Daraku wasn’t an expert in magic so he couldn’t tell at which tier Cain was operating now but he for sure knew it was higher than Six! That was Yamauba’s limit, and she was considered to be a monster in his eyes.

“Consume this body and Take your shape!” Cain chanted again, this time his left arm was covered in magic Circles, causing another burst of Magic. At this time most of the residents have abandoned the mansion fearing the thing in Alice’s room might blow the entire place up!

Leon who was calling his father froze in place upon sensing Cain’s magic, ‘Did I aim my wand at that monster?’ Leon regretted even aiming at Cain, he realized that if Cain wanted he could have blasted the entire mansion away.

William and Leon’s mother Lisa were with Leon when Cain started, they could feel the shaking. It was too sudden for them to fully grasp what was happening, all William knew was that Jack was the one who cursed Alice with her condition and that this shaking is caused by the mage who discovered that as he is trying to heal her!

The spell [Devil Calling] seemed more flashy than it needed, that was due to its nature!

The first part was already done by the cursed object in the past which was bringing the devil soul. Now it was time to construct a body for it!

To construct a body you needed raw material, a human body! We’re using Alice’s own body for that purpose and that is why she needed the painkiller and the sedative!

The second thing we needed was a large amount of Mana to be the energy consumed at the construction! Cain can’t provide that huge amount of Mana himself and neither did the spell creator expect anyone to be able to provide it alone!

The large Magic circle at the ceiling’s purpose was to gather Mana from the surrounding air and compress it inside Cain’s body! That process is what caused the spell to seem as if it was about to explode!

Cain’s job was then to slowly feed that magic into Alice’s body while monitoring the spell! The magic circles on his arms were made just for that!

Lastly, he is floating and his eyes are glowing simply because his body is filled with that compressed Mana!

The combination of all of those made the spell look more dangerous than it was! Just like a merchant who could work with over 1000 gold coins in a day while his profit for that day is just 3 or 4 gold coins!

Looking down on Alice, Cain finally completed setting the spell! It was time for him to finish and let Alice slowly transform!

Suddenly, All that magic started getting compressed in Cain’s right hand, shining like t could start a whole new world!

Now that he wasn’t glowing anymore, the real damage Cain sustained from casting the magic was apparent! He was bleeding from every orifice in his body, and his skin was peeling off just like Alice’s! It was clear that the only thing keeping him Alive was him casting [Lesser healing] on himself all this time!

“Now for the last touch, Please just don’t wake up now!” Cain said as he held the compressed magic in his palm.

Without wasting any time, Cain slammed the magic directly onto Alice’s chest, aiming at her heart! Just after a moment, glowing veins surged through Alice’s body as the transformation started!

Cain was already out of energy, his body was also failing as he had gone beyond his limit.

Thud! Someone just jumped inside through the window, and It was a face Cain hated to see! Jack was there.

“To think someone could use that failure! Where did you learn that kid!?” Jack said, looking at the bloodied Cain. slowly walking toward Alice.

“What do you think? Can I control her?” Jack said smiling as he reached toward Alice’s body with his hand.

Clap! Cain catches Jack’s hand, looking at him menacingly!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What is the meaning of this? You’re already on death’s door!” Jack sorted at Cain. He was somehow right as Cain didn’t have enough strength to fight, yet he was awake, meaning his MP still didn’t run out completely!

‘Sorry Alice, I did sense him coming so I took a bit of MP from the ritual, It might leave you with a scar on a random place of your body so forgive me!’

[Second-tire Magic [Mist Step] Has been added to the system]

In the next moment, The scenery in front of jack changed completely! they were falling outside the window!

‘Short-range teleportation?!’ When Jack looked up, Cain was already unconscious and falling after him. ‘This bastard! He still had some steam in him!’

“Die you piece of shit!” Jack swang his sword at Cain’s neck midfall.

Slash! A knife flew directly into Jack’s hand before he could hit Cain.

“This moth****ker slipped when I was helping the maids escape! Sorry, bro!” Daraku sniped Jack’s hand with one of his throwing knives!

Both Cain and Jack fell on the decorative bushes below, so they didn’t sustain fatal damage, broken bones were probably only what they got!

Still having some life in himself, Jack painstakingly stood and pointed his swords at Daraku, “Another one? What are the guards doing?” Jack screamed.

“We’re here!” The one who replied was Leon, coming with a whole battalion of guards!

“Ah, Little brother you came! See this, you bastards are going to be executed!” Jack screamed laughing at Daraku.

[Lightning Burst] The loud and majestic lightning bolt flashed in the night sky like the divine punishment of god, hammering directly on Jack’s head.

“You’re dead!” Leon screamed [Lightning Burst] Striking Jack with another one, burning him to a crisp!

“You dare lay your hand on MY ALICE! Are you sick of existing!” Leon was furious, seriously trying to kill Jack on the spot!

‘Yeah, I heard it before but he REALLY, REALLY likes his sister!’ Daraku thought upon seeing Leon’s expression!
