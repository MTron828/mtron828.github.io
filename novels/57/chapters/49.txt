The dinner was something else, nothing can beat homemade food! Except for the bread, Mabel’s was on another level that the maid who baked this could never hope to reach!

Decades in the profession, mixed with care and love, have sprouted what could only be called a miracle! “Sebas, from today onward we buy bread from Evan’s Inn!” Cain said looking as if he was about to cry.

“As you say!” Sebas simply bowed his head, agreeing with Cain. He had also tasted that famous bread that haunted all bakers in the city, some have even said it was baked by a god!

“Who baked this anyway? It’s good, but seemed like a cheap copy of what Mabel made!” Cain asked looking at the maids who were standing to the side.

Usually, in noble houses, the servants don’t eat with the master but stand ready to serve him at any time. They eat either before or after.

No one replied, Sofia was just looking down at her plate, It was her!

Having a bit of mixed feeling as Cain said it was good as well as a cheap imitation. Should she be happy or sad?

“It’s me, how did you find it?” She asked, waiting for some hope.

Cain stopped for a moment to think about his words carefully, he didn’t want to hurt her feeling.

“Did you learn it from her?” Cain asked, trying to find a lead. He was using his 20 intelligence to its max potential!

“I did, I just wanted to learn after tasting it,” Sofia said, looking across the table.

(To the side, both Selena and Alice were gorging themselves without a care in the world.)

“You’re gone too far, imitation it may be. This is a revolution considering how little time you had!” Cain’s words struck a deep spot in her heart, a bit of hope that she can do it!

The rest of the dinner went smoothly until Cain was about to leave.

“Master Cain, I wish to borrow some of your time!” Sebas called Cain for a private talk.

Inside the office, there were only three people present for that conversation. Cain, Sebas, and Elsie!

‘What is she doing here? Is it a problem with her?’ Cain thought, he seem to have seen her face a bit too much in a single day!

“I’m sorry that one of the maids angered you on the first day, this is a shame I would like to fix now if possible!” Sebas said with a serious face, signally for Elsie to approach.

“What?” Cain was confused, who made him angry and when? He didn’t remember being angry at any of the maids.

“She is here, I just ask of you to not be harsh in her punishment, she is still new after all!” Sebas said, standing up to leave the room.

“Hold on, who said I’m angry?” Cain stopped him, this was a misunderstanding and he needed to fix it on the spot!

“But…” Elsie was about to speak but Cain interrupted her, “If I was angry I would have said so on the spot, you might have misunderstood something!” Cain declared standing up.

“Are you sure?” Sebas asked, looking at Elsie in confusion!

“I’m sure, If I was angry at her she would have been punished on the spot!” Cain quickly exited the room, he had another girl to deal with!

He headed directly for his room to wait, Sofia said that she will follow him after getting herself ready.

************************************

As soon as he opened the door, his eyes fell on Alice who was sitting on his bed! She was in her devil form wearing barely any clothes.

She was in a one-piece nightgown.

“Master, want to play?” Slowly opens her arms and legs as if calling him in.

“You know it’s Sofia’s turn right? Can you just wait a bit?” Alice’s body was too thin at the moment for his taste. It will take her some time to put on some meat!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ahh, I lost the bet! You’re a hard-headed one, aren’t you?” Alice lay on the bed almost wanting to throw a tantrum!

“I would like you to keep your promise!” Sofia spoke from behind Cain.

He turned around to see her standing behind the door. She was covering her whole body with a blanket, only her face was apparent.

“You seem to have figured it on your own! Stay covered until we finish speaking.” Cain said as the three of them sat on the large bed.

“So, can I ask what is that bet?” Cain asked as he felt it had been important!

“It was whether she could seduce you or not!” Sofia replied to him, getting a bit closer to Alice.

“The bets were as follows, the loser had to obey the winner for the whole night and only respond with thank you!” Sofia, voice carried happiness.

“Is that so? Well, Sofia I have to make sure about one thing!” Cain said staring at her eyes.

“Today I won’t resist your 17 charisma. That means I might lose control and be too rough on you!” Cain warned her.

“She isn’t a wimp, go crazy!” Alice commented from behind.

“She is right, at least for this night alone I wouldn’t mind. I came ready! She slowly unveiled her body.

Wearing only her pure white underwear, her whole body was decorated with glittering silver.

A single glance at her was enough to drop Cain’s 20 intelligence into 2, turning him into a wild Beast.

Quickly tackling her down on the bed, Cain started with a deep kiss that shocked her brain.

Each time she tried to breathe she would end up swallowing some of his saliva.

At last, he moved away giving her a chance to breathe.

Her rest didn’t last long as Cain jumped on top of her face, forcing his thing down her throat to the base.

Once again, struggling to breathe she was about to tap out, only to have her hand pinned down by Cain’s knees. Cain wasn’t trying to be gentle on her as he was already out of control!

Her only savings grace was the bed being soft enough to prevent her arms from snapping.

Alice on the other hand was busy casting healing magic on her, it was the only thing preventing Sofia from passing out.

On the other hand, Cain was busy making himself familiar with the taste of her feet. From each toe to her ankles, he made sure to take his time. Without forgetting about her mouth, he kept moving up and down violently, each time hammering her head down.

As he reached the end, Cain pushed downward with all his might, emptying his load as deep as he could in her throat!

At the same time, Sofia’s Dam bursts open sending a river of clear water.

It wasn’t over, Cain added a few thrusts after that, releasing for a second time.

That extra nudge was Sofia’s breakpoint. Her body went limp as her eyes rolled backward, releasing the Golden syrup inside her.

At this point, Alice has already started pushing two fingers down her own throat and flower.

Cain was still under the influence of her 17 Charisma so this was just the start.

Acting quickly, Alice healed Sofia in case she has sustained any damage.

Sofia wasn’t waking up so Alice zapped her with a bit of curse magic.

Reacting to the pain, Sofia woke up coughing milk. The next thing she felt was Cain feasting on her downside.

Sofia looked at Alice with crying eyes, ” What just happened?”

“Who knows? I might help if you asked nicely!” Alice said pushing her feet onto Sofia’s face.

“I did win the bet, right? It’s an order, help me!”

Alice thought about it for a while, long enough for Cain to start doing the bee work on Sofia.

Keeping one of her legs straight and lifting the other enough to touch her face. Sofia started feeling her inside being smashed.

As the waves of pleasure rushed through her body, Sofia remembered how her mouth was being used before.

Without realizing it, Sofia opened her mouth moaning and begging for more!
