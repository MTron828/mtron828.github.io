The maids prepared the bath quickly, It was as if they were expecting that.

Gracie was standing at the bath door, she was the only one allowed with them after yesterday’s incident.

“Master, Mistresses. The bath is ready.” She said, opening the door for them.

“You aren’t getting in?” Alice asked, she was hoping that someone will help her take the bath. Gracie seemed like the person for the job.

“Am I allowed in?”

Gracie was right, being allowed in didn’t mean she can just barge in without being called.

“Cain, can I get her in?” Alice looked like a kid wanting to take his small duck into the bath with him.

“I don’t mind, you should check with Sofia.” Cain didn’t care as long as the girls are with him, it was bad to get in with a maid behind their back, not with them.

Alice turned toward Sofia with her eyes sparkling, “Why not?” Sigh!

Selena was nowhere to be found, she has already entered the bath so they counted her answer as yes. With that, Gracie hurried to bring what she needed.

“Sofia, I will turn my back while you take off your clothes, just don’t forget to take the jewelry off as well.” Cain’s idea was simple. The jewelry increased her charisma by 1 point so it reached 17, taking them off should return her to 16 where Cain wasn’t affected by her charm.

Until he reaches level 8 and levels his Wisdom, she shouldn’t wear them when they are naked. This was the temporary solution that Cain reached.

Cain has also brought a bottle of antidote with him, just in case anyone of them has sustained some unseen injuries.

It didn’t take him long, Starting with Selena and ending with Sofia. Cain inspected every inch of their bodies looking for any scratches.

Selena started to purr as he inspected her body, Sofia was bushing and twitching while Alice bore a happy face. Cain didn’t find anything, he did make them drink some antidote just to be sure.

Next, it was his turn, the three girls ganged upon him.

Clank! Gracie opened the door, what she saw was the weirdest of sights.

Cain was laying on the ground with his limbs spread out, The girls were checking every nook and cranny of his somewhat built body.

Cain looked toward her. She was wearing a full-body baggy swimsuit that covered her from the ankles to the neck. It looked like something a baby should wear not a full-grown woman. The swimsuit covered all of her body’s curves giving her excellent protection, Cain could make her body lines better in her regular maid outfit.

“Do you need any help?” She was asking the girls, not Cain, “No, we’re almost finished.

Surprisingly, Cain was the one they found scratches on his body! He might have gotten them while he was overwhelmed by the goblins. Alice healed them after applying the antidote, Cain drank some on his own which surprised the girls which surprised them.

“I tasted worse.” Was Cain’s only answer.

The washing didn’t take Cain that long as he was tended to by four girls. Sadly, Gracie’s presence prevented any intimate scenes from happening.

The hot tub in the mansion was powered by firewood making it pretty expensive. The mechanism was unknown to him as he had never tinkered with such a thing, he was only worked with Magic-powered baths at the elvish kingdom. Turning this might not be that hard if he found the right items for the job.

Cain Soaked his body slowly in the water, It was a bit hotter than what he liked but still acceptable.

“Cain, you already in?” after a few minutes he heard Sofia calling, she was coming alongside the others.

“NYA!” Selena dove right in, splashing hot water all over Gracie.

“Ouch!” Was the only response she got.

“Selena, try to calm down a bit,” Cain called to her, she was already swimming.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Are you alright?” [Holy Healing] Alice cast healing magic on Gracie just in case, the water was pretty hot and she didn’t want her to get burns.

The mess quickly calmed down, and they all sat together in the tub.

Finally relaxing after a long day was a blessing. Sofia melted beside Cain, she did get nervous on several occasions this day, like when she saw him and Alice turn to stone.

Gracie kept staring at them. Cain was just relaxing in the water while Sofia hugged him from the right side, Selena from the left, and Alice was sitting on his knees.

She took her time inspecting them as she started to feel out of place.

Alice’s black wings were relaxed behind her back, her tail was sneaking pokes at Cain’s abdomen from time to time, and she was a bit horny.

Sofia seemed to enjoy the sensation of sticking her body to Cain’s shoulder, It was noticeable she was rubbing her chest on him slowly.

Selena was the most relaxed of them, just lying beside Cain enjoying him playing with her tail underwater.

Surprisingly, Cain was the least horny of them all. He seemed to be as soft as he could be, it was almost unbelievable that he was like that with three available girls beside him.

She had even gone through the trouble of covering her body to not get in the way.

“Should I leave you alone?” Gracie asked.

“Why not get with us instead? Stop standing there like a doll!” Alice was the one who spoke, Gracie hoped that Sofia or Cain will tell her to leave.

Sofia gestured for her to get in. Gracie found a nice spot facing them where she sat.

It was weird, she didn’t expect it to end like this.

Even though she showed no emotions, her brain was fully functioning and acting at full power. Her thoughts were a bit abnormal though.

‘I’m the only one wearing clothes, should I take them off?’ She debated herself, ‘No, I can’t just show them my body like this!’ her mind fought back, she wasn’t able to reach an answer.

Cain just stared at her, she stared back at him.

‘She is looking at me!’ he thought, trying to make sense of her actions.

‘He is looking at me, did he notice?’ She thought, assuming he figured something.

The only one who was able to make sense of the situation was Alice, her 18 Wisdom wasn’t in vain.

After several minutes of just staring at each other. Alice was the one to call it out, “So…Lisa said you have potential, what kind of potential was she talking about?”

Gracie was surprised by Alice’s question, they did live in the same mansion, did she know something.

“Potential as a maid!” Gracie’s answer was bland, as always her expression didn’t even budge.

“Just like her? I doubt that!” Upon hearing Alice’s words, Gracie apologized and quickly left the bath.

“Alice, did you have to say that?” Cain asked, he was wondering what they were talking about.

“I will tell you an old story later, now is not the right time!” Alice said, sitting directly on Cain’s hips since Gracie has left.

As blood surged down, Cain quickly forgot what he was talking about. He was barely able to keep his thing calm by thinking about how to upgrade the bath.

“Not now, hold until we go to bed!” Sofia said, pulling Alice from her wings.

Cain interfered, Grabbing Alice from her side inspecting her body, she blushed thinking he was okay to do it here.

“You seem to be getting better quicker than I thought! You have put on a decent amount of weight.” In any other situation, hearing this will make a girl snap. Alice was extremely thin, just skin and bones from her years of suffering.

She seemed to be getting a bit better, her ribs were starting to fade. Maybe because she was a devil but her body seemed to heal quickly.

“But don’t get too fat, just a bit of weight is good!” Sofia smiled, pinching Alice’s side.

Selena was weirdly quiet, except for purring all the time. It was Cain’s right hand giving her tail a massage. Just enjoying that was enough for her that she didn’t care anymore.

“Let’s get out, after dinner, we’re heading directly to my room! Tonight I will let you all take the lead!” Cain declared.

“Are you sure?” Sofia asked, a million scenarios ran through her head.

“Of course, I want to know what you like!” Cain was determined to never move a muscle that night.

The night was going to belong!

Cain stood up, the faster they finished dinner, the faster he got to lay in their care!

After getting out and finishing dinner, Cain headed straight for his room. He was anticipating the night all day.

He was wondering which of them will be the first, what they are going to do! He couldn’t imagine Alice going faster than a turtle. Sofia likes to be quite intimate, will she be able to show that in front of the other girls? Selena had a lot of energy so she was going to suck him dry in most cases!

Cain quickly opened the door.
