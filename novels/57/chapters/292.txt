Sofia poked Cain’s side as she pushed him to the changing room.

“You seem awfully excited.” Cain stared at her jumping around.

“We haven’t been alone for quite a while now, I’m not going to waste such an opportunity.” Sofia’s face broke into a smile.

Cain quickly took his clothes off and headed to the shower room with Sofia in tow. They needed to wash the day’s sweat off before doing anything.

“Hey Cain, I can hear two hearts inside you,” Sofia asked as she put her ear on Cain’s back.

“I did have two since I evolved do you find them weird?”

“No, they are comforting!” Sofia hugged his back and stayed like that for a while.

“Let’s head to the bath, we already finished here.” Cain turned around and carried her in his arms.

“Let me down, we might slip!” Sofia gasped.

“That won’t happen…” As Cain said that, he slipped. Sofia saw the ground coming right for her face and closed her eyes.

“Did that scare you?” Cain whispered in her ears. When she opened her eyes, they were floating.

“You!” she turned around and started hitting his face with what felt like sponge punches. Cain could breathe from how much he was laughing. “I will get back at!” She growled with a pouting face.

With that, they reached the hot tub. Cain slowly lowered Sofia down into the water and sat beside her. As he stretched his arms after such a long ride, Sofia decided to ride on his lap.

She immediately jumped on top of his lap facing him, her hands grabbing his face. “It’s been such a long time…” whispering as she went in for a kiss.

“You’re getting a bit aggressive today, can’t you wait until we get to bed?” Cain whispered as their lips parted.

Sofia stared at him angrily, “No!” She started twirling her hips on him, “I got to keep you all for myself for tonight…” She tried to push him inside but Cain lifted her up instead.

“What are you doing?” she gasped.

“Getting you ready first, going straight for it will be boring!” Cain laid her on the bath edge and lifted her legs. Sofia covered her face with her hands, it felt different since it was only the two of them.

Cain went in for a big lick on that pink flower, Sofia’s body twitched her thighs locked his head in. Cain didn’t stop and went even more aggressively, even pushing two fingers in her backend and twirling them rapidly.

“Cain!” Sofia tried to push his head away, forgetting that her thighs were locking him in place. “Your tongue…please stop!” she cried.

“You said more? Got you!” Cain replied with a smile and went ballistic.

As the waves of pleasure hit her head, she broke into a smile and started grabbing his hair. No matter how tight her grip went, Cain didn’t seem to flinch.

“Ah! Ah!” Her body twisted and twirled as pushed another two fingers into her flower [Enchanting: Weak Electric discharge] It was only strong enough to feel like multiple small stings inside of her.

Sofia’s legs extender as the dam broke on Cain’s face. As her hips were still shaking and she was trying to recover. Cain went in for a second round.

Sofia wasn’t even able to talk after he started, her body was too far sensitive to allow her the leisure of thinking. She quickly reached her end the second time after a few minutes.

She was left twitching in a place like a fish gasping for air. Cain gave her a kiss and dripped a bowl of warm water on top of her lower half.

Seeing that she might need a rest, Cain tried to stand and take her to bed. The moment he got out of the water, she grabbed his ankle. “Come…here, it’s my turn!” She dragged him above her head, taking him deep into her mouth in one go.

Cain didn’t feel like doing in that position, as she was turning his stick too much it felt as if it was about to snap. He quickly pulled from her mouth and sat on the ground, she immediately turned and crawled toward him.

“Only we could notice such a difference, can you try and force it all the way?” Sofa gave him a long lick as she mentioned the length difference he had after evolving.

“Have you noticed the second change?” Cain asked with an evil grin.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Second change?” Sofia questioned, she never noticed anything different besides the size.

“I just go however you’re comfortable, it’s hard to notice when you all are sharing.” Cain smiled as he let her do her thing.

Sofia started slowly going up and down with her head, each push was deeper than the last.

Cain gently grabbed her head without putting any pressure, he was letting her go at her own pace. Yet only the feeling of his hand on her head made her want to push further and further.

Suddenly she felt him pulsating, she knew what was coming so she waited till the last moment. She grabbed his hips in a big hug and used all her strength to push him even deeper than she normally could.

She could feel wave after wave of hot liquid sunk into her throat. Each time she thought he finished, a new wave came in.

After a few seconds, Cain pulled out and she started coughing. “What…was that?” She stared at him.

“To keep with you four I did some tweaking to my abomination body. Five times the storage and fire times the refill speed. Can you deal with that alone?” Cain gave her a smug smile. It was not just that his stamina far exceeded her now.

“You bet,” she went in for a second round. Cain didn’t have any reason to stop her so he just sat there and let her do her things.

“How now?” Sofia glared at him after she took the second load deep in her throat.

“I already refilled what was used the first time, you have to be faster to keep up!” Cain combed her hair with his hand. “Get on your back.” Cain pushed her down and she happily lifted her legs.

“Which one should I go for?” Cain asked teasing her lower side, “Up or down?”

“UP!” Sofia moaned rubbing her hips on him.

Cain started slowly pushing inside when she kicked his face. “Do it in one go…please!”

Seeing her like that, Cain bit her toe which was stuck to his face, and pinned her legs down. “You asked for it.”

Cain pushed down with a considerable amount of strength. Immediately penetrating as deep as possible. Sofia had forgotten about the extra length. She was surprised when she felt a sharp pain inside her. Yet it hit a nice spot.

“Ahh! K-keep going!” Hearing her plea, Cain kept hammering her insides. Sofia held him tight in her thighs as she heard his heavy breathing on top of her. It was satisfying to hear his faint moans to the point she started taunting him to go harder.

Cain eventually looked at her in a kiss and released what he had stored deep inside her. Feeling her stomach fill like never before was addicting, her inside kept contracting as if she was trying to suck as much as possible.

After resting on top of her for a while, Cain finally stood up. She did have a happy grin on her face so he assumed that she was satisfied for now. He brought a bowl of warm water and washed her and himself clean.

Sofia slowly sat up as she felt the warm water drip on her, “Did I…” She stared at him.

“You seem to have blanked for a second or two, how are you feeling?” Cain asked her with a smile.

“Never felt better, It’s just that…” She gave him an awkward smile.

“Want more?” Cain asked with a puzzled face.

She gave him a shy smile, Cain went in and kissed her hand. “As you wish, just wait a bit until we get to bed.” Her face turned bright red as white smoke emerged from the top of her head.

She got too embarrassed that her heat evaporated the water from her hair. A thing only fire dragons could do.

As if to shake her embarrassment and change the subject. Sofia jumped up to help Cain, “Let’s this done quickly!” She smiled with her hands on her hip.
