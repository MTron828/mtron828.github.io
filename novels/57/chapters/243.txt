The Kenku tried to break free from her grip and escape her punch. He was stuck, as her grip was too tight. A shadow of death looked in front of him. He could feel it, the moment her fist connect with his head, he will splatter like a melon.

BAM! A shockwave was released the moment Zaleria’s punch reached her target. The overwhelming power of the Dragoness was unmatched.

…

Cain landed in front of the dimensional rift created by the beast god. It was a spell used to trap people, [Dimensional Prison]

‘Why did the beast god lock himself in as well? He could have just trapped his opponent and made a run for it.’ Cain started thinking as he examined the elemental energy left by their battle.

“He was on the defensive? Protecting himself, no, he was protecting someone else.’ Cain found multiple traces of defensive spells.

‘They are still fighting inside.’ Cain could feel the dimensional rift as the two monsters inside exchanged blows. A hell was sure to rise inside, Cain knew he would just die the moment he jump inside the rift.

This place was supposed to be the beast god’s house, now it’s just ghastly rubble. Cain examined the whole place in hope of finding something helpful.

In his search, he found blood traces. Doing simple detect magic revealed that the blood lacked any traces of magic. That meant that its owner was already dead.

‘Who could it be?’ Cain asked himself. Who are the people who could live here? The beast god, his wife, and his daughter.

Cain didn’t see the beast god’s wife, could this blood belong to her? No, the earth dragon could have brought some cultist with him and this is their blood.

Taken by curiosity, Cain thought that he could sense the people inside the dimensional prison by touching the dimensional rift. It was a risky move, like wanting to touch a stove to know if it was hot or not.

Cain slowly approached the rift and extended his hand. Crackle! A bolt of lightning repelled his hand.

‘Only two, the beast god and an earth dragon. I can’t feel anyone else besides them.’ A success only gave him anxiety. If they killed the beast god’s wife, that man will not stop at just one dragon. If he won this fight, he will probably go on a rampage and hunt other dragons until he dies.

‘I should go back’ Cain thought as he flew away. There was no more to see.

…

Alen slowly opened his eyes, and a flash of light blinded his vision. ‘Is this hell? Did I die?’ He thought before sensing the magic around him.

“AHH!” he jumped from the bed.

“Calm down, I just healed your wounds.” Said Alice who was sitting beside the beds.

Alen looked at her and then looked at the other beds. Hati was lying there fast asleep.

“Your William’s… do this mean that Cain is here?” He asked with a hopeful voice.

“Yes, he should be examining the battlefield now.” Replied Alice with a worried face. This man should not know about Cain’s strength to look that hopeful.

Hearing her answer, Alen fell back on the bed and sighed in relief. “I knew he was reliable the moment I saw him, the way his magic ticked gave his strength away,” Alen said with a smile.

“I doubt you know what he could do.” Sofia cut him off. She looked a bit irritated by the Guildmaster, she still hasn’t forgotten how he stopped them from killing jack at the guild.

“I might not know what spells he can use or to what extent, but what I could know is that his skill with magic far surpasses mine,” Alen said.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You just say that.” Sofia glared at him.

“Besides that, what happened to the purgatory shard? Is it still with you?” Alen asked with a passive face.

“What are you talking about?” both Sofia and Alice were confused.

“The purgatory shard that you had, the reason he picked you up,” Alen said as if it was natural.

“We have never heard of such a thing, wait for Cain and ask him directly,” Alice said. She was sure they never had a shard-thing but what could she know. It was better to leave this conversation to Cain.

“Leaving that to Cain, why did you stop us from killing jack at the guild? If he was a demon that we could kill right?” Sofia asked with a serious face.

“About that, there are two reasons,” Alen said as he lifted a finger. “One Jack was William’s son so if the public knew he was a demon. They would ask for the execution of the whole family. William was my friend and I didn’t want him to end up dead.”

Sofia thought as she heard that. ‘So he wasn’t protecting us from the law, he was protecting the lord’s family from the public wrath?’

“Secondly, and you might not believe it. I know a spell called foresight that allows me to see a minute into the future. At that moment I saw Jack transform and you were killed, I had to prevent that.” Alen said with a serious face.

“Then you could have killed him yourself.” Alice out of all people was the one to speak next.

“Family bonds are stronger than friendships in most cases. I can’t kill my friend’s son without proof that he was a demon. And look who’s talking, wasn’t he your brother?” He looked at her.

“Not after what he did,” Alice replied with a cold face.

Alen looked at her, she might look normal to other people but he can tell the massive amount of cursed energy running in her body. He decided not to ask until Cain returned, he didn’t have enough magic to fly to him anyway.

“By the way, where is Mary? She should be with you…” Alen looked around hoping to see her.

“We left her at Furberg. She looked a bit sus so we decided to leave her.” Alice said with a passive face.

“Cain as well?” Alen asked with a worried face.

“No, it was a collective decision between us, his wives. She looked too dangerous to keep around him. We can’t trust her until we confirm her true intention, which we weren’t able to do.” Said Alice with a happy face.

Alen held his hair. “I told her to try and be friendly, I told her to try and be of help. Did she misunderstand that for something else?”

They all looked at him, “Why do you want her by Cain’s side this much?”

Alen sighed.
