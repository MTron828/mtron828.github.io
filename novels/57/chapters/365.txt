The next morning, Cain woke up to find Marina asleep while the maid was wearing their uniforms. “Good morning master.” They said at the same time.

Cain yawned, “Good morning,” He needed to get up quickly as he still had a trip ahead of him. After washing and making sure he was ready, he left through the portal. On his way, he asked Olivia inside the maze to tell Sebas to send the funds to Marina.

When Cain reached the camp, he found that everyone was awake and awaiting him. “Did I make you wait?” Cain looked at them.

“Not much, the girls here got anxious when you became a minute late.” Mary giggled as she looked at Sofia specifically.

Cain smiled as Sofia, Alice, and Gracie greeted him. “Where is Selena?” He asked.

Alice pointed toward a large rock, Selena was there with Chad staring at the corpse of a giant bear. “The poor thing approached us so those two took it out,” Alice said with a sad voice.

“Ah Cain, come here and take a look. This would make an impressive coat.” Chad said as he was skinning the massive bear.

“Bear meat is tasty-nya, want some-nya?” Selena was munching on the beast’s flesh, this was her breakfast.

Sadly there wasn’t any use for the corpse to him, “I will help you out.” Cain used [Telekinesis] to hang the bear upside down so Chad would find it easier to skin.

After that was finished, they set off again. This time Zaleria wasn’t intending to stop until she reached the capital’s outskirts.-ɴ(0ᴠᴇ)ʟ.

“Hold tight, I will be going a bit faster.” Increasing her speed, her wings flapped faster and Cain could see fire sprouting from her nostrils.

By sacrificing their comfort, Zaleria managed to reach the capital’s outskirts before the night’s fall.

Mary stretched her sore back end, this trip was painful for a regular person like her.

“How should we get in? I see an inspection point at the gate.” Sofia asked as she stared toward the capital gate.

“Give them the king’s letter,” Gracie said.

“No, I want to explore the place anonymously first. We will draw a lot of attention and the guild might catch up on us.” Cain said with an exhausted face.

Mary remembered their quarrel with the guild’s investigators, Cain might be on their hit list.

“How do you intend of going in there?” Alice asked, she thought that sticking to the king’s protection is the safest way.

“We walk right through the front gate, they won’t even notice us.” Cain smiled, he has a weird plan.

As the guards yawned from the uneventful day, they saw a bunch of people approaching the gate. A white-haired guy, a tall man, and eight women. They were surprised to see one of the women with nine tails but beast people are common visitors.

“Stop right there! What is your business in the capital?” The guard yelled from atop the wall. They will never open the gate before knowing whom they were dealing with.

“I am here to invade the capital, open the gate, or I will release a dragon on you!” Cain yelled back at the guard.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The guards laughed, “A dragon? Why invade us?” They played along.

“Just wanted to see how it looks inside. May settle in if we could afford it.” Cain replied.

“Fine, get in man. It’s just the protocol.” The gate opened and inside one of the guards approached Cain and greeted him.

“Travelers? A weird assortment of people you have there but welcome, hope you like it here.” Guard smiled as he shook Cain’s hand.

Cain looked toward the big, beautiful brick building, and the people walking down the clean, bustling streets. “My wallet is already in pain, Ah!” He helps his side with a stupid face.

“That inn is cheap, relative to the others. I also don’t recommend eating close to the gates as the shops there try to scam travelers.” The guard pointed toward a distant building.

“Can you recommend some nice spots? Like the kings’ private chamber…” Cain whispered to the guards.

The guard smiled, “Yeah sure, you can find it in the castle. But on a serious note, if you wanted a tour of the castle garden just as the guards at its gate. They will give you one for a silver coin per person.” The guard then went to list some of the most popular tourist spots in the capital.

After a short chat, Cain and the girls made their way comfortably to the streets.

“Was there some sort of code? Or did you bribe him?” Alice stared at Cain.

“No, the guards here just chill. This place has never been attacked and its main source of income is tourists and travelers. A bit of sarcasm and jokes can make it seems that we’re just here to have fun.”

After dropping by the inn and renting some rooms, Cain set a portal inside to get to the maze and then went downstairs for dinner.

After a quick meal, Cain stood up and turned toward the girls. “I’m going out for a walk.”

“Can we come with you?” Sofia asked.

“No, it will be better if I went alone. Just sit here for some time.” Cain replied, he wasn’t going just for fun, he was looking for something.

Firstly Cain visited the jeweler and bought a bag full of pearls, and magnificent corals. Second, he stopped by the fish market and bought a whole shark, even though they were pricy. All of those cost him over a hundred gold coins which pained his wallet a lot.

“Sir, where do you want this delivered?” The fisherman asked looking at the massive shark. If someone had the wealth to buy a shark they are bound to be a noble or someone important.

Cain smiled, “No need, I will carry it.” With a snap of his fingers, the shark disappeared.” Since Cain had already built a permanent portal nearby, he could more easily send items to the maze.

The fisherman’s jaw dropped, this one in front of him was a skilled mage. Before he could try and strike a deal, Cain had disappeared as quickly as he appeared.

For the next hour, Cain walked through the street looking for a specific person. He quickly heard her, “A copper please, help those in need.” Across the street, from him, he could see her, the blue-haired girl.

Just as he remembers her, sticking in the dark alleys to beg for money that she never needed.

“Hello.” Cain walked toward her and smiled.

“Please a copper sir, just a copper.” She immediately grabbed his legs half crying.

Cain put his hand in his pocket pretending to be looking for a change and instead pulled a pearl. She saw her eyes immediately lock into the thing, and a drop of droll dripped from her dry lips.

“Sorry I don’t have a single copper on me, I only seem to have this pearl.” Cain started moving the pearl around and saw the girl chase it with her eyes.

“This thing is a bit pricy and you can sell it for money, I will give it to you if you followed me for a private service.”

Hearing his words the girl immediately nodded. Cain wasn’t stupid, he knew what kind of creature this girl was.

After he guided her to a dark ally where no one can see them, Cain pulled a second pearl.

“I want you to help me hunt a Kraken,” Cain asked straight away and the girl just stared at him confused. “What do you mean?” her acting skills were on the point.

Cain smiled and pulled the whole pearl bag, he could her gasp and suppress her instincts. “Sir I don’t think my body is worth all of this!” She said with a scared face.

​ “Then how about this then?” Cain pulled what corals he had as well, this time she couldn’t resist snatching them from him. “Sorry, please don’t beat me.” She cried bowing down beneath his feet.

Her acting was slowly getting up his nerves, she might need the last push.

Cain dropped the massive and heavy shark corpse directly on her, she would have been dead if she was a normal girl. Yet Cain could see her struggle to get out from underneath the shark while sneaking some licks here and there.

“Stop acting Bronze, or should I say Nemmoxon. I really need your help taking a Kraken down.” Cain said with a serious voice

At that moment, the girl’s eyes glowed green as her expression changed.

“Who are you?” She easily stood pushing the shark away and faced Cain. This girl was a full-fledged bronze dragon, she was clearly no ordinary beggar.
