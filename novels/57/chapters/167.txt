“Shall we start?” Cain said extending his hand to Sofia.

“I’m wearing all the jewelry, would it be alright?” She asked, “Of course it won’t, even without them it’s still going to be bad. We’re now just trying to make things a bit easier. That’s all.” He said scratching the back of his head. The moment he will see her with 19 charisma, it will be over.

“Don’t scare us like that.” Sofia laughed it off. “We’re going to be sore tomorrow,” Alice said sending more fear into Sofia, was it going to be that bad. She seems to have forgotten what she suffered from Cain seeing her 17 charisma and she was now trying to face him with 19.

“Gracie bring me a cup of water.” Gracie immediately poured him one, “Here.” Cain looked at the cup and took a sip from it, He then extended the cup to her face.

“If you please. A generous amount.” He said and Gracie complied, giving as much saliva as she had. Cain steered it up and handed the cup to Sofia.

“Share it with Alice, It will help you last longer.” He was being serious. Selena can handle herself, It’s better for Cain to drop quickly. But Alice and Sofia are the two who are going to suffer if they couldn’t handle it.

Sofia closed her eyes and downed half. Alice on the other hand felt her stomach turn as she held the cup. “Can’t you drink it?” He asked her, remembering how sensitive she was. “No, I can.” Closing her eyes and taking it in one big gulp, she started coughing.

“Before I level your charisma, let’s get you ready first.” It was bad having them dry when leveling her up for obvious reasons.

*******************************************************************

Cain started by placing a kiss on Sofia’s lips, his hand slithered under the blanket and tickled her downside. Her body twitched as she felt his tongue ravage the inside of her mouth.

Cain’s other hand took care of Alice The moment his finger went inside her. Her tail wrapped around his arm in excitement. “AHH!”

Selena who was by their side tilted her head to take him in her mouth. She wasn’t going as deep as Sofia could but he could feel a slight tingling from her tongue.

His body shuddered at the sensation, he immediately switched to kissing Alice. She backed her head, she seemed uncomfortable with the fact that he is coming straight from Sofia’s mouth. At that moment, his fingers knocked on her back door made her body twist and curl in surprise, and the next thing she felt was his tongue slithering into her mouth. She recognized the taste in his mouth, but with it came a second taste that she didn’t find pleasant and she knew where it came from.

“Cain, it had some…” She didn’t dare finish, this wasn’t the time for her complaints. She stepped on her heart for a moment and pushed her face toward him and snatched a second kiss. When the felt that taste again she felt like throwing up but held herself and soon she was able to ignore it.

At that stage, he started switching kisses between the two while going harder and harder with his fingers on them. He could feel something swell in his underside. Immediately wrapped his thigh around Selena’s head and pushed himself even deeper inside her throat.

It was a bit much to take but she was Selena, She hugged his waist and kept him all the way down her throat. It was painful, she couldn’t breathe, but she held it until his full load was inside her. At that time Sofia and Alice twisted as he felt a generous amount of liquid splash on his hand.

“Gracie, make sure they have enough water.” She immediately poured a cup for each of the girls. Selena used it to clear her throat while the other two just drank it because Cain said so.

He then looked at Sofia who was still sweating. “Are you ready?” He grabbed her hand from under the blanket. “Please do.” She said holding tightly to his hand.

“Then close your eyes and focus on the charisma, you should find it easy to assign the points,” Cain said in his last words, from all the people in this room, he was the one who is going to feel the change first.

It was a moment of silence, Selena felt the air around Sofia change a bit. Alice couldn’t feel anything as she had 20 wisdom and Gracie couldn’t care.

Sofia slowly opened her eyes to see Cain’s mesmerized red face. His eyes seemed to wander in a far land. Sofia then dropped the blanket from her back, revealing her tender flesh with all the jewels adorning it.

Knowing that she was going to get jumped at any moment, she took the initiative to put it in. It would be bad if he went the wrong way. Seeing that he still didn’t move even after slowly getting into her, she tried another bold move. Locking his waist with her legs, she extended her tongue to lick his lips.

At that moment she felt his face slam into her, a sharp pain rang in her nose and teeth as she was pushed toward the bed. His tongue was ravaging her mouth as she felt the heavy pounding on top of her.

They were both painful and addictive, she couldn’t differentiate between pain and pleasure. Sofia found herself pushing her tongue deeper into his mouth and still holding the tight look on his waist.

As Alice watched this she kept an eye on where the two of them were connected. She had to make sure Cain didn’t go the wrong way as Sofia couldn’t handle the pain from that. “Selena, if I gave you the signal, pull him from her immediately.” She said with a shaking voice.

Even so…Looking at them like that had made her feel hot. Her hand unconsciously clogged her front side while her tail clogged the backend. The other hand massaged her chest until it was tender. “Ah!”

Selena stayed calmer than expected, her eyes fixed on them, and one of her hands going ham on herself. Other than that she stayed still.

As the four of them moaned like wild beasts, Gracie was standing there watching. The firelight glimmered on her cheeks as she observed every move and sound. Memories she never wanted to remember flashed in her head, they gave her a slight headache.

She hadn’t felt like this in over a year but a light tingling pricked her inside. ‘If only it was him, then I would’ve…’ He felt her heart do a single big pound before calming down.

Gracie took a step ahead, ‘No, I can’t do that. Because I can’t let him see this…’

The memories kept flooding into her head, giving her more headaches.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Sofia was busy enjoying herself, as rough as it looked and as much as her voice resembled cries more than means, she was honestly wishing if this feeling could last forever. Her mind slowly started to blank out from pleasure, with each pound, a pulse of pain and pleasure made even her teeth tingly.

And then it happened.
