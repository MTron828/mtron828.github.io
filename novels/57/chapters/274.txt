Outside in the city center, Chad was enjoying some roasted meat at Evan’s inn.

“Here are the soup and drinks, please enjoy!” Evan said as he put a bowl of soup, a big mug of ale, and a massive, golden brown loaf of steaming hot bread in front of Chad.

“Thank you, can I have a glass of water as well. Also, bring me a second serving of meat.” Chad said with a charming smile.

Everyone in the inn was looking at him wolfing down the meat like no tomorrow. They could understand where he could put all of that meat.

Eventually, Chad tried the soup. It was a bit bland, just a mixture of vegetables and meat. Nothing special.

He then took a bite from the bread…Chad stayed silent for a moment and then took a second bite. The crunchy outside, the soft inside with a hint of butter. As if by magic, the bread had a faint smoky smell that resembled the roasted meat. After each bite, Chad carved some ale, and after drinking the ale, he carved more bread.

In Chad’s eyes, the bread was the main dish. “Bless your hands, madam! This is the best bread I tasted in my whole life!” Chad shouted at the elderly woman who was in the kitchen.

Mabel slowly lifted her head up. She could swear she heard those words before. When she looked outside, this hulking hunk of a man was waving his hand at her energetically.

“Thank you, I’m glad you liked it.” She replied with a blush.

Chad smiled, “I tasted enough bread in my life by this top everything easily. Saying I just liked it is an understatement for this masterpiece. What do you all think?” Chad said and then looked around him at the people eating.

“Well said!” One of the adventures yelled lifting his mug. “Everyone comes here for the bread, you will never find something like this in the whole city.” Another adventure yelled as he lifted his bread high up.

As everyone cheered, Chad raised a toast for Mabel’s health and wolfed down all the bread presented to him. He even asked for a second and a third serving.

After having a large and satisfying meal. Chad walked toward the counter to pay.

“With two servings of roasted meat, a serving of soup, three serving of bread, and counting all the ale, water is on the house. Your total bill is 2 silver coins.” Evan said with a smile.

Chad smiled, “I pay with how much I think your food is worth. Not by the price you decide.” Chad said as he slammed 2 gold coins at the counter.

“Excuse me but that is ten times your bill…” Evan tried hard to keep his calm face.

Chad put his hand on the counter, “The soup was a bit lackluster, the meat was good, but the bread was unmatched. This is how much I’m paying.”

Evan looked around him as if asking for help. Chad was serious, he really thought that the bread was worth that much.

“Even so…I can’t take all this money…” Even forced a smile, it was the first time he faced such a situation.

Chad silently walked away without looking back. “Wait, can you at least tell me your name?” Evan called him. Even if he was forced to accept the money now, he can send it back to him if he knew his name.

“My name is Chad, Chad Lisworth,” Chad replied with a charming smile.

The name instantly rang in Evan’s head, “By any chance, do you know someone named Cain?”

Chad stopped and looked back, “Cain? That has to be my son. Why do you ask?”

“No wonder you gave a similar vibe. Making a fuss about the bread and all. Cain has stayed here for a while.” Evan said. Now that he knew that Chad was Cain’s father, something felt strange. He knew Cain’s parents because they also stayed here for a while, he was sure they died in a quest.

“You don’t look similar at all,” Evan said with a worried face.

“He took after his mother more than me. Excuse me but I have to go now.” Chad immediately left the inn heading toward Cain’s mansion.

As he was walking in the street, he could feel that a group of people was tailing him. ‘Thieves? They probably saw me pay with gold coins so they are after me?’ Chad thought as he changed his direction toward a back alley.

As Chad took a step after the other, his muscle tensed up, as he got ready for a fight. They were getting closer and closer.

When he reached a nice dark spot, Chad stopped. BAN! He heard the sound of a shovel smacking into someone’s head.

“You retarded fu**ing donkeys, I’m going to shove those butter knives up your arse!” A middle-aged man was cursing as he smacked the thieves with a shovel.

“It’s that blacksmith, what is he doing here?” One of them cried.

Chad immediately jumped in to help.

“I know my work when I see it! Don’t dare fu**ing use my weapons to rob people!” It was none other than Dolrig. He was out for a late-night drink when he spotted the thieves tailing Chad with his daggers.

CLANG! Dolrig smacked another thief in the face with the shovel.

After punching two of the thieves, chad kicked another one in the face before disarming them. After a few seconds, all the thieves were beaten.

Dolrig stared at the biggest thief lying on the ground. CLANG! He gave the unconscious thief another smack on the face with the shovel. Tfu! Spitting to the side. “You trouble-making pieces of shit, just wait until I report this.”Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Dolrig was determined to get them in prison for almost hurting someone with his weapons. Usually, you will need good evidence but thanks to a white-haired friend of his, Dolrig got to know the lord’s son so he can ask him to take care of this.

“Are you alright old man?” Chad asked Dolrig.

“You stupid Buffon, why did you walk into such a place?” Dolrig lashed at Chad next.

“I was trying to take the fight away from the public. The question is why did you chase after us?” Chad asked as it was strange for someone to act like that.

“I can’t stand innocent people dying with my weapons, hurry and get to a safer place,” Dolrig said, as he was finally calming down a bit.

Chad sighed, in his eyes, Dolrig could have died with a single mistake. “I’m heading toward my son’s house to spend the night, care for a drink before?” Chad invited Dolrig to a late-night drink.

Dolrig smiled, he was drinking before so he didn’t mind continuing.

“I know a good bar, let’s head there!” Dolrig said with a smile, “Ah, but we need to drag those idiots to the guards first.” Dolrig added.

Chad and Dolrig grabbed the unconscious thieves from their arms and ankles and dragged them to the main street. Chad weaved to the guard so they rushed to see what happened.

“It’s sir Chad…what did happen?” William and Leon seem to have informed them about Chad. They won’t make the same mistake as with Cain, they have to give Chad the respect he deserved.

“And Dolrig as well, what a strange coincident.” Another guard said with an amazing face.

“Are you by a captain or something?” Dolrig asked as he stared at Chad. With how chiseled Chad’s muscles were and how he fought, it was a simple conclusion.

“No, I’m not,” Chad replied.

“Don’t you know?” One of the guards said with an excited face. “He’s the white mage’s father, don’t you know him?”

Dolrig’s face twisted a bit, “Cain’s father? How could that be? Don’t tell me!” Dolrig growled as he glared at Chad.

Something felt off, Dolrig knew something.

‘Cain’s parents died, I forged their blades and they never came back. Who is this man.’ A mix of anxiety, anger, and curiosity started to build up in the blacksmith’s head.

“It’s a long story, Let’s talk about it over a drink.” Chad said as he turned toward the guards, “Please take care of those thieves.” He said pointing with his finger.

“Let’s go, it’s getting late,” Chad said with a pained smile.

“Yeah, Let’s go,” Dolrig said with a worried face. The situation was getting awkward. He was certain that Cain’s parents died. If they were a chance a misunderstanding happened, Dolrig wanted to clear things in his head.
