The ship was shocked and lifted to the sky, Chad who was about to start beating the soldiers who tried to shoot Cain’s ship is now saving them from drowning.

As the water fell back down, it released multiple secondary waves flipping most of the ships.

“What is happening-nya?” Selena held Alice in her hand while grabbing into the deck. Sofia already released her draconic wings and was flying beside Cain. Gracie had taken the liberty to hide in Cain’s shadow.

“It should calm soon!” Sofia yelled, seeing the sea from the sky reminded her of the water’s behavior when a big thing is thrown in.

“No. There is more to it.” Cain corrected her, she can sense turbulence under the surface. The water was swirling around as it was draining into a sink.

“A whirlpool, sail away quickly!” The captain shouted almost immediately, he noticed it just as fast as Cain did.

The ship groaned as the sails forced it to make a hard turn, as the wind wasn’t enough they started using their arms and sweat, oars is all they had.

“Push harder, slack, and will drown!” The captain shouted.

“YES, Captain!” They shouted back.

“Your life depends on it, I will skin anyone who lets go of his oar!” The captain shouted again.

Selena was about to jump in to help but Cain stopped her, “With your strength, you will just cause the ship to spin in its place.” It was important to balance the power.

“Then what can be done-nya?” Selena looked at him like a scared cat, she like to swing but not in salt water, it smelled weird.

“Let me do something…” Cain used [Telekinesis] to pull in four oars and tie each two together to make two long oars. “Sit in the middle, a bit high up, and use those two. The captain will prepare a seat for you.” It was a shame not to use her strength.

Sofia started flying around and saving any soldier that fell in the water. Alice busied herself by healing the bleeding hands of the men handling the oars, they were using their full strength after all.

The ship that Chad was in, was in the opposite direction of the whirlpool center so the winds were pushing against it. “Chad, we can’t get away, the wind is against us! The goddess of the sea seems to favor your son.” Even though the situation was serious, Ariel seemed to still have some energy in her.

“Fine, if the gods won’t help, I will do it myself!” Chad rushed toward the oaring room.

“You what?” She stared at him running.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

In Chad’s mind, he had the same idea as Cain so he tied the oars together and started single-headedly empowering the ship.

When the soldiers started to wake up. For some reason, the aboleth control seemed to fade a bit. They saw chad forcing the ship to move in a straight line. No magic, no tricks, just his arms, and the oars were enough.

The soldiers also started helping, they can’t just sit and watch. A full team was dedicated to replacing Chad’s oars as they kept breaking from how much power he was putting into them.

Ariel, unable to sit still, screamed. “Ninth-tier magic, Angel power!” That was the easier way she could justify what she was going to do. With that, she shifted back to her angel form where she could use her majestic angel wings. She didn’t want people thinking she was a real angel so making it seem like a spell was a reasonable excuse.

If people knew she was a real angel, she was bound to become a target of veneration, which will displease the gods.

She then used the sail ropes to start dragging another ship out of harm’s way. Even though, for a moment she wanted to let them drown since they started praying. “Use those hands to steer the ship or use the oars, or I will let you down!” She screamed at them. Her wings flap as hard as they can, if a human can do it, she can as well.

Cain run into the deck and downed as many MP potions as he could. ‘The earlier explosion might have opened a hole into an underwater massive cave. It will stop eventually, all we have to do is hold up’

Cain flew toward the center of the whirlpool and spread his arms, “Let’s go all out for once shall we…” Cain smiled, magic was all about going against the laws of nature.

[Investiture of Wind] [Control Weather] [Control winds] [Enchanting] Cain’s eyes started to glow with bright blue light, lightning crackled from his body as the sky was engulfed in black clouds. A small tornado engulfed Cain’s body as violent winds started pushing the ships away from the whirlpool center.

Ariel looked toward Cain impressed, “Even Uriel would be amazed to see such a feat!” But just when she thought that Cain has shown his best, a massive pulse of magic blasted from his body.

[Telekinesis] [Tidal Rage] [Control Water] [Enchanting] For a moment, Ariel felt as if Cain had turned into something else, a monster that had magic dripping from its veins. Just the sight of the ridiculous combination of spells Mana made her giggle like an insane person.

The water from the whirlpool started forming tentacles and piking and soldiers that fell in it, then returning them to ships. The ships that fell behind were getting dragged and the tentacles that didn’t have anything started to disturb the whirlpool in an effort to disturb it.

“This isn’t the work of a mage…” A mage who was recruited as a soldier said in an awe-painted face.

After about a minute, Cain managed to push all the ships away from harm’s way. The death toll was minimal but the whirlpool was still standing, the ships needed to move further away.

Cain’s magic faded as his body fell toward the center of the whirlpool. Splash! Zaleria flew from the water toward him, she was carrying the unconscious Nemmoxon in her claws. “CAIN!” She shouted trying to catch him up.

At that moment, a massive tentacle emerged from the water at a blinding speed and caught Cain. The Aboleth emerged from the center, of the whirlpool. A massive Octopus-like creature with multiple red eyes like a spider and a massive gaping mouth that resembled a strange place.

“As I expected, you’re dangerous!” The Aboleth attempted to eat Cain.

Cain opened his eyes with an evil smile, “Art thou of no more brain than sardines?” Cain’s full magic emerged again catching the Aboleth off guard. Cain didn’t run out of Mana, he used himself as bait to lure the Aboleth out.

Cain used all the earlier magic to grab the Aboleth and spin him like a ball on a rope. The Aboleth growled, when did this monster get born? Why did no one know of such a terrifying mage walking the earth?

The soldier watched the white mage in terror, they knew he was powerful, but they never expected to see him bully such a massive, horrendous monster like it was a doll.

Alice stared at them, Cain wasn’t joking when said he can take the aboleth down alone if he caught him on the surface.

As Zaleria tried to get Nemmoxon to a ship so she can rest and get healed, she took a glimpse of a horrendous, massive, bone-decorated gate. That was built just under the center of the whirlpool. It was open and the water was getting sucked into it.

‘Was he the one building the Hell Gate, and under the sea floor?’ As she thought of that that, half of Cain’s ship froze as Isbert lost control of her magic.

As Cain was wrestling the Aboleth, armies of Krakens surrounded the ships forcing them back into the whirlpool.

“Prepare the cannons! That one is approaching us!” The captain yelled.

“We can’t, they are frozen!” The sailors shouted back, it was useless, the Kraken is about to sink the ship.

Sofia who was far away tried to rush but she then saw something unexpected appear from the massive waves.

BANG! BANG! BANG! Cannon shots turned the Kraken into cheese. The captain could never mistake such a hated flag. Black and with a skull as its symbol. A ship that looked both ragged and strong.

“We eat KRAKEN at dinner! Rip him apart!” The Captain steering the pirate ship shouted and his crew chanted back. An elvish woman wearing silver armor was sitting behind him glaring at Cain fighting the Kraken.

“Found him!” she mumbled.
