Izabella and Cassius reached the balcony, “Is that them in the garden? What are those little things doing?”

“They have spread their forces a bit too much around all the city, all that remained here is their royal guard and some new recruits,” Cassius replied.

“Their queen told me, she seems to be able to converse with animals so my friends here vouched for me. Let’s get down and help them.” Cassius pointed toward a group of pixies that were fighting.

“It will take us a long time to run down there,” Izabella said. She was the one slowing Cassius down.

“They will give us a ride, jump!” Cassius leaped from the balcony and one of the vultures caught him. Izabella did the same.

The two of them dropped right above the attacking believers. Izabella took the man she fell down on in a single precise stab to the neck. Cassius only knocked one down.

The vultures immediately tore the man Cassius knocked inside out. In the meantime, Izabella finished the rest as if they were nothing.

“You’re that guy Mei was talking to!” one of the pixie soldiers approached Cassius.

“Yep, I will clear this area. You take mother and eliminate the believers on the other side.”

“But how are you going to do it?” The pixie stared at Cassius.

Cassius smiled, “I can’t, but they can. ARAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” He screamed.

After a few seconds, swarms of poisonous snakes and diseased rats emerged from the sewers. The crows that were watching from outside swarmed down like pigeons on bread.

“I want everyone like this dead,” Cassius kicked the corpse of one of the believers, “Crows, you direct everyone else. The payment is all the corpses you hunted.”

Hearing his words, a third of the animal returned from where they came. They are those who refused his offer, while the rest, spread as the hunt was on.

With this small reinforcement, the pixies were able to take control back from the believers. Just as they were about to finish the fight, Cassius tadpole told him that the Aboleth was no more.

Cassius hurried to climb the castle flag and shouted at the top of his lungs, “Your master is no more, surrender!”

Hearing his words, the pixies released all the tied, possibly infected soldiers. Anyone who wasn’t a part of the cult was now safe to let go.

As expected, the cult ignored his words and kept attacking. CLANG! A spear suddenly pierced the ground with a loud noise stopping the fight.

Looking at the sky, it was the king standing on the balcony. “You’re not leaving this castle alive! I don’t care if you surrendered or not, all that awaits you is dirt!” His blood was boiling, those are the people who turned the past year of his life into hell. His daughter’s sickness, the orcs’ attacks, controlling people, and gods know how many people died due to the adventurer guild falling into their hands.

Both as a king and a father he couldn’t forgive them, this was his land, and they aren’t leaving it!

As his mind snapped, he jumped from the balcony standing. “You idiot!” The court mage leaped after him and used [Feather Fall] on him. As the king descended, the wind blew his magnificent cape and the golden crown glowed on his head.

Thud! The king grabbed his spear as soon as he landed and started walking toward the cultists.

Three of them surrounded him, “The king is weak kill him!” One of them shouted. “He never fought in years, it’s an easy win!” The other yelled.

The king slowly walked without care, his trusted spear was in his hand so it was all good. As the three approached at the same time, the king took a heavy step forward and stabbed the first one in the eyes, killing him. The second cultist swung his sword at the king who seemed to have just stabbed the first one. The king grabbed the man’s wrist and twisted it around to stab him with his own sword.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The third one jumped at the king from behind, aiming to stab his back. The king jumped back at the man before he could swing. The cultist was a bit more skilled than the other so he took the chance and grabbed the king’s neck.

“I’m going to snap your old bones!” The cultist laughed.

The king opened his mouth and bit the man’s arm, using the power of his back muscles to lift the man on what resembled a piggyback, and threw him to the ground. CRACK!

A single heavy stomp was enough to crack his skull. “This old lion still has some fight in him.” The court mage said with a smile.

“It’s war, kill them all!” As the king shouted, all the soldiers who were freed rushed in to fight.

…

After a few hours when Cain arrived. He found the city streets filled with the cultists’ corpses. Cain smiled, this is why he and the king got along in his past life. Just like him, the king likes to root the problem as soon as he sees it. They both attack as soon as they can.

Cain remembered how he first attacked the bandit cave while being under-leveled. At that time he has miss judged his own strength and almost got killed if not for Selena. The first fight with Meliliana and now this Aboleth.

The port guards were surprised to see a pirate ship sailing with the fleet and sent a guard squad to arrest them upon docking. The moment the fleet Captain saw that he yelled at them.

“Don’t you dare put a finger on them!” That pirate ship saved their lives in the battle, even if Cain wasn’t supporting them, the captain was still going to try and protect them.

Jack walked down of his small galley with a smile on his face, the wind almost blowing at the black flag behind him. “Men, we landed peacefully on land. What do you think?” He asked.

“Meat! Beer and women!” They all shouted, their bones were carved for the warmth of the land.

“Then it’s a month’s rest before we sail again, take your time, and don’t get arrested,” Jack shouted as he approached Cain, his new friend.

“Hey, want to have a drink?” Jack asked Cain.

“Sorry but I have to meet the king, I prefer to be the one reporting the details about our fight,” Cain replied.

“I don’t think we will be appreciated in the castle ground, I will just go to the tavern with the men. Tell me if you wanted to sail the sea anytime.” Jack patted Cain’s back.

“To be honest, I did want to sail toward the elvish continent. I would stay here until the coming tournament is over though.” Cain stared at Cain.

“When is the tournament?” Jack asked.

“About a month or two months ahead. Depending on how the situation develops here.” Mary replied from behind them. She seems to already know.

“We can wait. It’s not a problem.” Jack smiled.

“Then I will ask the king if he can help fix the hog in the meantime. She needs some care.” Cain looked at the roaring hog, Jack’s ship.

“Isn’t she a beauty? Let’s give her some love.” Jack smiled as he patted his ship.

Then after leaving the pirate in a nearby tavern, Cain headed with everyone to the castle.
