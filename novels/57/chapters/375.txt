Cain jumped to the side barely dodging the vase, using his magic to such a delicate job of inserting the silver shards and enchanting them precisely to a perfect job was no small task. He was exhausted, and this was the reason Emily was so obedient in helping him, her skin was crawling at what could happen if he slipped, she knew the one before was a master at his craft.

“Hold up princess, what if you injured him! You can’t allow such a talent to even receive a paper cut!” Emily jumped at Isbert and tackled her down.

“Let me go, this is an order!” Isbert growled, she was still getting tackled while in the nude which enraged her even more.

“Each cut on your body is comparable to a fifth-tier spell, you rarely find a mage able to cast one let alone tens at the same time!” Emily cried.

Cain took the chance and teleported outside the room and started running across the hallway, he was low on MP after such a procedure that he didn’t want to use [teleport] a lot.

CRASH! He suddenly pumped into something soft, “ARA, isn’t it the white mage, nobody told me you were such an adorable little kid.” Looking up, he recognized her face, she was the oldest princess clocking at a whopping 29 years old. But her age wasn’t the only big thing she has.

She stared at him sinking into her chest with a single open eye, her blue pupil seemed to have a faint glow to them.

“Sorry, I have to go!” Cain used [Teleport] randomly and was thrown into the royal kitchen. The moment he landed, he saw one of the princes munching on some nuts in the corner while hiding from the maids.

“What are you doing?” Cain asked, the prince was the same as him, what was supposed to be the epitome of man’s grace and nobility. Yet he was acting like a rat eating almond.

“White hair, could you be the white mage father mentioned?” The prince’s eyes started to glitter.

“Yes I am, give me some!” Cain snatched some and they started eating together.

“How is sister doing?” The prince asked with a calm voice.

“She kicking like a horse and yelling like a rooster, pretty healthy in my book!” Cain replied with a smile.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Thank god, to think you treated her in a day!” The prince smiled.

“That is but merely a temporary solution, healing her will take longer,” Cain replied, he still needed to get to the source of everything, hell, and the ice hero.

“But it’s no doubt you achieved what we couldn’t in a day, you’re impressive!”

After chatting for a while, the prince suddenly signaled to Cain to shut up for a moment. The head maid was looking for him and she was angry.

“Prince Cassius where are you? I promise I am not angry!” she was yelling, the slipper in her hand was saying otherwise.

“Can you do that thing again?” The prince asked with a scared face.

“Sorry but I’m almost out of MP, we have to distract her and run to the window.” Cain needed a minimal base of magic to keep Isbert, the maze, and all of his enchantments in check.

“I understand, lets’s distract her first.” Cassius gently whispered to the wall and a small mouse appeared from a tiny hole.

Cassius pushed a couple of almonds into the hole and whispered to the mouse, “Go drop that shaft. Pointing toward a small wooden pole on the opposite side of the room.

“Speak with animals, you know some magic?” Cain stared at the prince, [Speak with animals] was a low-tier spell used to primary get information from animals.

“Only this spell, found in an old tome. But I do have a lot of friends thanks to it.” Cassius replied as the mouse started its job.

The moment the shaft dropped taking the Headmaid’s attention. Cassius rushed toward the window and leaped from it, Cain followed him and jumped, thinking it was a single-floor jump. They were on the seventh story of a tower.

Cassius whistled loudly and the vultures nesting at the top of the tower looked down, recognizing the prince and diving down. One grabbed Cassius and the other grabbed Cain. They seem to already have pads on their claws, there Cassius’s pets.

After a short flight, the vultures dropped Cassius and Cain on a stack of hay in the stables. “Thanks for the ride!” Cassius waved to the vultures as they flew away immediately.

Cain barely managed to stand, falling in the hay wasn’t pleasant. His hands and legs were all scratched up. The prince seemed fine though, which meant this wasn’t his first time.

Cassius stood shaking the hay stuck on his clothes, “Not the most graceful of escapes, I’m definitely no master. Should we head toward father’s private courtyard? She shouldn’t be able to chase us there…” Before Cassius could finish, the slipper smacked his face.

Cain immediately grabbed him by the arm and they ran, she was still after them. This was the same as Sebas’s family treated William’s family. But instead of a cane, the head maid was using her slippers.

p “That aim! Did she improve?” The prince growled scratching his red nose.

“Forget her and let’s hurry, that is the best way!” Cain dragged him and rushed toward the king’s courtyard.

…

In the courtyard, Chad and Baltos were having a friendly discussion. The king was interested to know how strong Cain’s father actually was. He did wipe the floor with s-rank adventures after all.

“I am not that strong, the guild’s standards are low. They all can grow with proper guidance.” Chad smiled. The guild was being manipulated by that thing Cain found into becoming weak for the sake of becoming weak. Cain said they wanted to erase any possible threats before they could blossom.

“The guild, I must find a new guildmaster. Someone with proper strength to keep them in check.” The king looked at Chad, “Would you mind taking that place.”

“I do mind, and it will restrict my freedom. Find someone else.” Chad replied immediately, refusing a high passion and an order from the king at the same time.

“As expected, do you at least have some suggestions?” The king took a sip from his tea.

“I will think about it, a reform of the ranking might be necessary. Also a full-scope lecture about monsters, their behavior, and abilities.” Chad smiled.

“I will leave that to you then, let’s talk about something that has an even bigger impact on the future of the kingdom.” The king smiled, this conversation was going well. All he needed to do now was secure Cain and his father’s powers to his side.

“I do have about twenty unmarried daughters, how would it sound to have your son KNOW them a bit.” The king tried to tread as carefully as he could.

“Why not? You can ask him directly but I recon he will refuse. They need to KNOW his wives first, befriending them first is your best bet.” Chad replied. He knows of the situation with Mary and Hati.

“I see, I will inform them.” The king replied with a firm voice.
