ROAAAAR! Shan roared as Cain was talking with Alice and Amaterasu. Zaleria twisted her body and dodged a claw strike from Shan. He left a wide cut on her left-wing preventing her from flying again.

[We simply want you to beat the dragons, as their loss is our win…] Amaterasu was cut short by Zaleria’s roar.

“Can you make it quicker? I won’t hold for much longer.”

Cain looked down. Zaleria’s body was riddled with scars and wounds. He could even see some of her ribs, when did she take such a hit? Was she protecting them so much that missed that?

“Sorry, but we have to talk later. I don’t have enough MP so I will be sucking from you so be careful.” Cain told Alice who was inside his shadow. He could not absorb from Sylph as it will take about a minute for the Mana to start reaching him. It was like a stream of water.

[Fly] [Haste] Cain immediately flew from Zaleria’s back to circle around Shan.

The spell imprisonment was simple yet complicated as all ninth-tier spells are.

It worked by creating nine pillars of magic around the target and using its own Mana to fuel the magical prison. This comes with many benefits. The most important one was that it was self-sufficient after being cast.

The more the target struggle, the more Mana supplies the prison and the tougher it gets.

Now Cain was about to add his own twist to it. He wouldn’t be an enchanter if he didn’t enchant the spell to be extra nasty. [Enchanting] He uses enchanting to add a small formula to the spell. With that, the spell will use Shan’s Mana as it is so the prison will have the earth Element and be resistant to it. And it will be especially resistant to Shan’s magic.

However, the spell had one drawback. Cain needs Shan to stay still while he builds the nine pillars around him.

~Zaleria, please keep him in one place for a minute~

“That’s impossible, you can’t stop walking mountains!” Zaleria screamed, she wasn’t even worried about Shan hearing them like Cain. What Cain asked of her was simply impossible.

~Father, can’t you do anything?~ Cain asked, there has to be a way to keep him in one place.

~I can try and direct him but don’t count on that~ Chad replied with a calm voice.

~How about you Guildmaster~ Asked Cain.

~I have a magic item that can store water, I will pour it on top of him and have Zaleria freeze him in place~ Alen replied with a worried voice as he looked at the walking stone.

~I doubt it will work but go for it~ Cain gave them the green light to start working. Chad will distract Shan, Alen will pour water on him while Zaleria will freeze him. Alice is healing Zaleria while Gracie is keeping an eye on Shan to warn Cain if he tried to do anything.

…

Inside Cain’s maze, Sofia was focusing on her magic.

“What are you doing-nya, we can’t help them-nya,” Selena told her with a sad face. This battle was just a bad match for them.

Rieth was standing at the corner while Hati was punching the wall in anger.

Sofia ignored them and focused on a single memory that she will never forget. The moment Zaleria hit the meteor, those purple dark flames that she concentrated on her forehead.

How she saw Cain use [Firelance] in the forest.

Feeling her MP almost empty, Sofia took out several potions and downed them at once.

[Firelance] She created one in her hand.

“What are you doing-coo?” Rieth was the first to feel something odd about what she was doing.

‘This isn’t enough, put more into it just like how Zaleria did.’ Sofia condensed more Mana on the lance. Spells usually needed a certain amount of Mana, adding more will only make the spell unstable.

Sofia didn’t care and kept overcharging the lance, using her own hands as the catalyst. ‘This isn’t enough, make it spin as Cain did.’ Adding turning motion was simple. The lance started to spin above her palm.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Reith’s feather stood and he backed away from her immediately, the magic she condensed was lethal. “Are trying to kill us all, stop that!” He yelled at her.

‘Firelance isn’t enough. Add Immolation on top to increase the heat.’ [Immolation] The spear in her hand started to turn bluish-white. The two horns on her head extended slightly as her heart rate increased.

“Need more Fire.” Sofia’s voice sounded deep as flame gushed from her mouth. [Firestorm]

“Coocaa!” Rieth started to panic, that thing in Sofia’s hand was about to explode. Did the girl not know about how magic can fail and explode? Now that he thought about it, she wasn’t even using a catalyst.

“Get me outta here, this girl is crazy!” he started to freak out. Even with his skills, this room was too small. He can’t stop Sofia physically since he will only cause her to lose control quicker. And if he left her she will kill them all with that thing.

“White-haired guy-coo, get me out of here now-coo!” Rieth screamed alarming both Selena and Hati. Those two didn’t know much about complicated spells.

~Cain, open a window for me~ when Sofia was satisfied with her spell, she called Cain immediately.

~What? I’m kind of busy…~ Cain stopped as he could feel her enchanted earring shatter, he had made those, especially strong so they won’t break.

Those shattering meant that she was trying something that could kill her in the blink of an eye if failed. Cain immediately opened a window for her so she can release whatever she was doing. He was determined to give her a harsh scolding when this is all over.

The moment the window opened, Sofia grabbed the fire lance and threw it at the earth dragon. The lance flashed with bright light as it approached the massive creature. At that moment Cain knew what kind of thing Sofia created. She created a messy lump of fire magic, that was about to explode at any moment.

The power was similar to that of an eight-tier spell but concentrated on a small object. That thing was going to hurt when it hit.

The earth dragon is his arrogance and blind trust in his durability. He tried to slap the lance away.

Flash! KABOOOOOM! The lance exploded immediately in a powerful blast. Like a strong firecracker in a human hand, it tore his skin apart and broke his jade hard bones.

As the earth dragon growled in pain at the unexpected spell. Alen took this chance to pour the water on him.

Hati and Selena watched Sofia collapse in her place with severe burns to her arm. As they heard the dragon growl outside, they knew it was her doing.

Hati’s blood started to boil and she immediately jumped from the small window. She wasn’t going to let this chance go to waste.

Rieth rushed toward his bag, took a healing potion and a mana potion, and tried to force Sofia to frank them. He knew that she was deprived of Mana and that her arm was in bad condition.

Seeing Hati rush outside, Selena took it as a challenge. She couldn’t let this dog go and help Cain while she sat still. She immediately transformed into her Jaguar form and jumped outside, as well as leaving Rieth to wonder what kind of crazy bunch Cain brought with him.

Cain started to panic when he saw Selena jump at the earth dragon’s arm.

Chad and Kayden were attacking the earth dragon from the side while Zaleria and Alen tried to freeze him. Now both Selena and Hati had joined the fight after Sofia created an opening for them. The fight was about to reach its end and Cain rushed to finish the spell and get this over with.

Cain had an idea about what he wanted to do but didn’t want to think about it. He knew that he would be setting a flag if he did so.

Cain flew as fast as he could toward the location of the fourth pillar. His body flashed with blue light, he would have already died if not for his abomination body, as the stress that was on him was massive. Alice was busy keeping Zaleria in fighting condition so Cain had to make do on his own.
