Cain stood up after being healed, “Can we continue? This time hopefully in simple training.”

“You want to practice swings?” Chad was perplexed. Even if Cain couldn’t fully utilize the skill. Getting the best of it was faster and easier than learning a whole new skill.

“You have [Blade Master], practicing that might be a better solution.” Cain used [Elemental weapon] to create a stone blade.

“Fine, but are you going to use that? It’s better to use a lighter blade. Like your sword.” Chad pointed at Cain’s sword.

“I want to work on my strength as well. Isn’t that the whole point of all of this?” Cain lifted his blade high up and swung it down.

Chad smiled, his son wasn’t as lazy as he seemed at the start of the training.

“Your friend, was she a dark elf?” Chad asked as he joined Cain in swinging. Alice got a bit worried when she heard a ‘She’

“Was it that obvious? They say the great souls live in what they created.” Cain smiled. “The maidens who mastered Blade dance could bring the incarnation of the goddess to life in their flesh. I could merely bring it for a blink of an eye, my skill isn’t at their level.” Cain swung his sword harder.

Chad seemed a bit confused, “The skill can only be mastered by dark elf women right? The fact that you were able to bring the goddess incarnation is impressive.” Cain shouldn’t even be able to reach such mastery.

“It isn’t that impressive, I had the privilege of learning from a great master.”

“I still can’t understand how a blade dance master reached this place in the past twenty years. When did you have time to learn such a skill in addition to your magic?”

“It’s a long story, longer than it should be. By the way, there is a way to bypass [Blade dance] restriction. Despite it being forbidden to use, the goddess will smite me if I tried it.” Cain changed the subject.

Chad realized that Cain was dodging the subject. If he didn’t want to talk about it, Chad won’t force him.

“What is it?”

“Using [True Polymorph] to morph into the goddess’s shape, which could allow a skilled swordsman to use the skill if he had mastered it,” Cain explained. To Chad, that seemed wrong on so many levels.

Morphing into the goddess shape? That is clearly the reason for getting smitten. And why would a swordsman who mastered an unreasonable skill go to learn an unreasonable ninth-tier spell just for the fun of it?

“How do you even know how she looks? Can’t you just transform into a regular dark elf woman?” Chad asked.

“The statues of Eilistraee are actually pretty accurate. Also if I was to risk getting struck by divine lightning, I would do it for the perfection of a goddess.” A sad smile crossed Cain’s face for a moment.

“I see…so who taught you the skill in the first place?” Chad was on to something.

“She was but a woman who I met in a tavern.” Cain took a few steps and morphed his stone blade into two daggers. “How about this? I taught this one to Gracie and she was doing well.”

Cain’s body shifted with the shadows. When his right-hand attacks, his left hand defends and vice versa. Cain then leaped from shadow to shadow doing quick swings.

“Twin fang, I have seen this one. It’s quite popular with thieves and assassins. It’s shame it requires shadow magic.” Chad seemed a bit disappointed. He wanted to train Cain physically.

“Well, Mauzzkyl…” Before Cain could finish, Chad leaped and closed his mouth. “Why did you try to utter the assassin’s name? Do you want to call him here?” Chad knew about the legend. If someone said the assassin’s name out loud, he could hear them.

Cain quickly pushed Chad’s hand. “Don’t worry, there’s more to it than just calling his name. Like an offering and a target.”

Somewhat it made sense to Chad. Why would the great assassin reply to a random call?

“You might be right.” Chad sighed, what did he miss in his son’s twenty years? It kept burning in his heart. If he was only able to be with him for all those years.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After that, Chad became a bit more serious. A random dark elf woman taught him an unreasonable skill. What kind of father he would be if he lost to her?

“I will teach you both Blade master and String master. You better get ready.” Chad took a stance.

“Fine, the more the better. I’m just sad that most of the morning is going to end with me not even being able to tinker with a single spell.” Cain wasn’t just a master of magic and enchanting. He found them enjoyable. Some mages might find working on high-tier spells grueling, but to Cain, it was a fun hobby.

Chad then spent the whole morning putting Cain through repetition hell. Swing and swing again. You were off by a fingernail so repeat it again a hundred times.

When it was almost midday, Cain was almost dead. Chad on the other hand didn’t even sweat. The clear difference between their stats was obvious.

“Are we…Done swinging sticks like monkeys?” Cain panted, his hands and legs screaming in pain.

“Yeah, we’re done for today you can go rest.”

Cain fell on his face as soon as he heard that. ~Gracie, is the bath ready? I’m coming~

[Fly] With his arms and legs dangling, Cain floated slowly toward the bath. At the door, Gracie was waiting for him.

“I shall join you today, the others are busy.” Gracie bowed slightly as she opened the door for Cain.

“I told you before that there is no need for you to be formal. Let’s get in.” Cain floated inside and Gracie followed him and locked the door behind them.

After helping the exhausted Cain take off his clothes, Gracie to her clothes as well so she can join him. Today it was just her and him so she didn’t have a problem stripping.

After taking pouring a bucked of warm water on Cain to get some of the sweat off first. She molecularly rubbed him until his skin became red. “Are you trying to skin me alive?” Cain cried.

Gracie gave him a blank look and then spoke slowly, “You need to be as clean as possible.” And she went to keep pulling his skin off.

After a while, Cain has turned bright red from all the rubbing.

“The hot bath is ready, let’s go,” Gracie said as she stood and waited for Cain to float to the tub.

“I’m exhausted, Can you carry me there?” Cain joked but before he could start flying. Gracie grabbed his meat stick and started pulling really hard.

“I can’t carry you, but I can drag you.” She said trying to put on a proud face.

“Awo! Wo!” Stop, not from there!” Cain cried.

Seeing him like that Gracie stopped, “Should I drag you from here?” She grabbed his marbles.

“Okay, Okay! I understand, I will fly on my own so let me go!” Cain started floating. And Gracie slowly followed him.

“Was that informal enough?” Gracie asked.

“Is that your idea of informal? Who taught you that?” Cain cried.

“Alice…” Gracie replied.
