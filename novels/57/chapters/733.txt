Aria sat beside Cain with a smile. He looked at the girls and then back at her. "Couldn't you be gentler with them?"

"Gentler? Do you realize one of them is a dragon goddess?" Aria smiled, "They should be fine,"

Aria opened her hand and opened a status sheet and showed it to Cain.

"Aria, did you put that in?" Cain stared at Aria with a wry smile.

She puffed her chest, "This will let anyone who stands against them know that I can shun them out of the system if they attempted to harm her."

"You can just do that? Well, I guess I made it happen," Cain sighed.

"Don't worry. I got those for everyone. Even the maids," She smiled, and looked toward Lilia, "Except her. She doesn't need my help,"

Lilia looked at her with a sad face, "Come on. Can't you give me one?"

Aria shook her head, "I can, but do you really need it?" She looked at her, "You are already too strong. Having me there will just be useless,"

Lilia nodded, "You're right," She looked down, "I can add it myself," She smiled.

"What?" Aria gasped, seeing the skill appear in Lilia's status. "How did you?" She cried.

"Illusion, deceiving those who look. But I doubt anyone could look at my statues." She smiled, "I can add the real one,"

Aria shook her head, "No, you can't,"

"I can. How much would you bet?" Lilia looked at Aria with a teasing smile.

"I will do anything you want," Aria growled, crossing her arms. "Hey, idiot. Don't do it. You know how strong she is,"

Lilia smiled, "Aria, give me the skill,"

At that moment, Aria's eyes looked dead as she bowed, putting her head to the ground. "As you order," She granted the skill to Lilia.

CLICK! Lilia flicked her finger, releasing Aria, "What do you say?"

"GAH!" Aria gasped, rolling back with a sweaty face, "What did you do?" She cried.

"Mind-controlled you," Lilia replied with a passive face.

"Huh?" Aria glared at her.

"I only needed to inject the thought into your brain network and frame it as outer control. Of course, I used his head as the mole," Lilia smiled, pointing at Cain.

Cain sighed, "So you used my brain wave to send an absolute order to Aria. Still terrifying as ever."

Lilia smiled, looking at Aria, "Now, you will do as I say?"

Aria looked down, "Fine, what do you want?" she replied.

Lilia nodded and looked at Cain, "To get what I want. I need a favor from you." she said.

Cain looked at her, "A favor from me? Do you need more divine power?"

Lilia shook her head, "No, it's deeper." She looked at his face, "Can I have full access to the network's power when we face Mystra?"

"That's like taking all of our power. Why do you need that?" Cain glared at her.

"Converting Mystra's divine energy as I did with yours. She opened her palm. I don't have enough processing power with my clones. I need to convert and absorb all of Mystra's power in a reasonable time before she could fight back," Lilia explained.

"Fine," Cain sighed, "But, If I reached a level where I can refine divine energy like you. I will be the one doing it,"

Lilia smiled, "That would make my job way easier," She smiled, "But I can't see you reaching that level in a decade."

"We will see," Cain smiled, cracking his neck.

"Master!" Klara, "Don't tell me. Your neck is still stiff?" She cried.

Cain giggled, "Well, yeah," He looked away. Even with two maids standing at his back, they felt no heavier than two birds. They couldn't muster the strength to do anything.

"Come here, please lay down," Klara pulled him toward the massage bench, "We can't leave you like that,"

Cain looked at her, "What are you going to do? Climbed all on my back?" He joked.

Klara looked at the maids, "Come here. All of you," She called all the maids to climb on Cain's back. After barely fitting six on his back, they all started jumping.

Cain just laid there, looking at Aria and Lilia while feeling the gentle taps on his back, "Still nothing. They are too light,"

Klara then stared at Amaya, "You have a lot of zombies. Can't you increase your weight?"

Amaya shook her head, "I'm one with my undead-like mold. I can't collect all of my weight in one place." She then looked toward the girls piled in the bath, "Lady Sofia should be able to use her draconic weight."

Klara shook her head, "We can't ask one of the ladies to do our job,"

Lilia looked at them and smiled, "I could help," she said.

"You're one of the wives. We can work you with us," Klara replied.

"No, I meant to get her to help." Lilia pointed at GAIA, "My maids are Cain maids, isn't that right?"

Klara looked at her, "That's true. The Lord and Lady of a house usually share their servants."

Lilia looked at GAIA, "GAIA, can you massage his back?"

GAIA nodded, "As you order," She approached Cain and rested her hands on his shoulders.

CRACK! As she applied force, the stone table that Cain laid on shattered.

"Oh my! How much force did you use?" Klara gasped.

"Three hundred the weight of a normal human," GAIA replied, "But his back didn't give in," GAIA stared at her hands.

Cain stood and flicked his finger, fixing the table. "That was unexpected, right?"

GAIA stared at him, "We inevitables are usually tasked with killing the newborn gods who threaten the stability of the universe."

Cain nodded, "And you tried to kill me just now. And failed."

"Yes, I expected you to get at least a bit injured," GAIA replied.

Lilia started laughing, "Well, you failed."

GAIA looked at them, "That means you are getting closer to her," She pointed at Lilia, "A being that the world order cannot chain."

"Then tell me, what do you want of me?" Cain asked GAIA.

"We can't beat Lilia. And thus only have the option of pleasing her to keep her from rampaging." She then glared at Cain with a passive face, "What should we do to keep you in check?"

"What could you pay to get a promise from me that I won't just decide to conquer the world? Or destroy a whole plane of existence?"

GAIA nodded, and Cain smiled.
