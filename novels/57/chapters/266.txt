Selena stared at Elsie for a moment. “Selena comes here and tries carrying Cain,” Gracie called Selena.

Searing Gracie’s second Call, Selena ignored Elsie’s complaint and walked toward Cain.

Slowly pushing her hands underneath his back, she tried to lift him up. He wasn’t that heavy but she could see he almost weighted twice as much as before. Cain’s body also felt different, she could feel two hearts beating inside of him.

“What should I do with him-nya?” Selena asked with a worried face.

“let’s take him to your room, it’s a bit dark there at this time of the day,” Gracie told Selena with a passive face and then turned toward the maids.

“Elise, bring Lexi and follow us to Selena’s room.” Gracie didn’t wait for their reply and chased after Selena.

…

Selena put Cain on her bed and covered him with the blanket. When Gracie entered after her she noticed a lot of problems. Some of the wooden furniture had scratch marks on them.

There were some drops of blood and feather on the window frame, which suggest that Selena snacked on a bird there.

The room was clean otherwise, it seems that the maids did their job well but they ignored Selena’s behavior since she is one of the ladies of the house.

“Ara, Ara. Selena, how many times have I told you to not eat snacks in your room?” Elena walked from the door. Everyone turned toward her with surprise. They didn’t her hear coming.

All the maids knew by now that she was Selena’s mother, and they expected her to be just as strong as her daughter.

Elena slowly walked and sat beside Cain’s head. She put her hand on his forehead and closed her eyes.

“He doesn’t have a fever, on the opposite I feel like he is a bit cold.” She said crossing her eyebrows in a frown.

She then slowly moved her hand to his neck. Her face completely changed from a frown to a worried look.

“The veins aren’t where they should be, I also feel two heartbeats inside him.” Elena was proficient in killing prey, she could at least tell where the jugular veins are.

“Is he alright-nya?” Selena asked with a worried face.

“I don’t know, a proficient healer needs to take a look at him first. But at least I don’t think his life is in danger.” Elena replied.

It was then that Alice kicked the door open. “What happened to him?” She asked with a worried face.

“We don’t know,” Gracie replied with a passive face.

“His body is a bit abnormal…would you mind inspecting him?” Elena said with a smile.

Alice was a healer, she could know if someone sick or not.

“You two go prepare some herbal tea and restock the fire, I will check on Cain in the meantime.” Alice looked at the two maids and they immediately left.

Elena stood up and left the place to Alice. After a while of examining. Alice concluded that Cain was healthy but extremely exhausted.

The other thing she felt was that Cain wasn’t a human anymore. Even if he looked human from the outside, his inside belonged to something else.

“Two hearts, one in the chest and one in the abdomen. Besides the new heart is a nerve lump that I can only describe as a second brain. There is a masse that is currently growing beside his liver, it has the same structure so it’s a second liver. His bones are denser but softer. The nerves coming from his spine seem thicker and his breathing is faster.” Alice said as she forced her magic to move through Cain’s body.

“What scares me is that my magic is constantly being absorbed by the second heart. I guess this is what he was meaning by evolving beyond level 20.” Alice as she took her hand off.

“What?” Selena’s mother gasped, she didn’t know he was at such a level. She wasn’t that familiar with magic so she thought that all mages were like him.

“I told you-nya, he is that strong-nya.” Selena started bragging. “He could erase the whole city with a big rock-nya!”

“Let’s leave him to rest for a bit, I bet that he will wake up soon,” Alice said as she stood up.

“The maids bowed slightly and left the room, soon after both Selena and her mother left leaving only Alice and Gracie with Cain.

Alice sat beside him while Gracie sat on the nearby couch. They watched over the sleeping Cain.

…

In Williams mansion.

William was having a cup of tea with an unexpected guest. Alice did give him a letter of introduction so William was excited to know the man more.

His guest’s name was Chad Lisworth, Cain’s father.

“What a delicious tea, haven’t tasted something like this in months.” Chad smiled as he took a big sip.

“It was brought to use by traveling merchants that came from the east,” William said proudly.

“Are you the one who gave that mansion to Cain?” Chad asked.

“To be honest. I gave it to him for my daughter to live comfortably. I didn’t expect him to grow even stronger.” William smiled painfully. At the start, he thought that Cain had amazing magical skills and that’s it. But after the catastrophe, his view changed.

Cain predicted the catastrophe. Was working on stopping it from the start. And to top it he knew two ninth-tier spells. Such high-tier magic is considered a national treasure with unmeasurable value.

William wasn’t knowledgeable about spell prices but he heard that seventh-tier magic tomes can go for up to 10000 gold coins. Eight and ninth tiers are bound to be higher. And the kingdom would forbid the selling of ninth-tier magic to manipulate the power.

To put it simply, Cain was probably more valuable than the royal treasury with all of his magic knowledge. And he held enough power to snuff a city in one spell. A war could break between kingdoms for him.

“Wasn’t Cain strong from the start?” Chad asked. Cain’s power should be obvious, they must have known about it from the start.

“You might not believe it but to my knowledge. Cain was just a newbie adventure recently.” William said with a thinking face.

“But a newbie doesn’t mean weak, it means he just started. Don’t your guild have an evaluating system for new adventures?” Chad asked. He had seen the adventure guild in big cities and they all had such examination.

“Well, they check your level and all,” William said with a passive face.

Chad frowned, “Level isn’t everything. Are there no combat tests or skill tests? You can have an excellent scout that is just level 1. The level only means how many monsters you killed not your actual skills.”

“I don’t they have another example besides the level thing,” William replied.

Chad wanted to hit his head on the table. He met countless master swordsmen who were still level 1 since they don’t kill but left their opponent alive. Some monks took the path of peace. They are strong brawlers and still level 1.

“How incompetent a guild can be? Please tell me you have a monster Encyclopedia available for adventures to use.” Chad stared at William.

“There is one, the adventures only need to ask the staff for information…” Thud! Chad hit his head on the table.

“They need to let the adventure be the one to read it, I’m sure that a mage or rogue would understand more than the staff.” Chad looked exhausted.

“How many new adventures have died for the lack of information and proper guidance?” Chad mumbled.

“I heard that 2 out of 10 new adventures die in the first month,” William said with a pained face, he started to realize that the guild was incompetent.

“Who leads the guild?” Chad asked.

“It’s the guild master, Alen Emerald,” William replied.

“Oh please, I’m asking for who is really guiding it behind the scenes. Don’t try and tell me what you tell common people.” Chad growled as he knew there should be more going behind the scene.

William sighed, Chad was Cain’s father and he could be as dangerous as his son could. “Direct orders from the capital, they send a protocol each year and some inspectors to verify that it’s been followed.”

“No wonder he got sick from this city. I need to go to the guild immediately.” Chad stood up. Alen told him that he was leaving soon. Now everything made sense.

This guild needs a whole reform.
