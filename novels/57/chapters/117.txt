When they got back home, the sun have already descended behind the horizon. The guard standing at the mansion door bowed slightly as they greeted Cain and Alice.

Cain looked around, hearing the cicadas whistling from the trees. A strange sense of danger chilled his back. Something wasn’t right, he inspect the garden from where he was standing.

‘No one is here, why do I get this weird sense of danger?’ Whistle, Whistle, Whistle! Cain ignored his worries and started walking.

As they entered, Alice looked back, listening to the loud whistle.

“Come, I’m hungry!” As Cain called her, she followed him silently.

After changing into something more suitable for home, meeting with Selena and Sofia. Cain asked for a report and the girls replied negatively, they didn’t spot anything strange.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After enjoying the dinner and messing around with the maids, Cain asked for some tea for the night. He wanted to chat with the girls over it, talking about what they should do from now on, joke a little. It was important for them to cool down from time to time.

“We should make a schedule. Having the three of us go at him is bad for his health!” Alice said taking a big sip from her tea. Cain thought she looked similar to her father as she slammed the cup down.

“No way! That means I would have to wait for three days-nya!” Selena objected, “Cain has enough strength to take to at the same time-nya!” Her tea had already cooled so Gracie had to reheat it for her, “Please drink it this time.”

“Two, even I know how to count! Alice is right, we can’t be that burden on him.” Sofia said as she took a sort sip, trying to mask that it was Cain’s cup not hers.

“Master,” Gracie said and Cain pinched her side. Let Sofia her do what she wants. “Do I even have a say?” Cain asked, the girls seemed to go on about their conversation and forgot that he was there.

“No, go ahead. It’s about you after all.” Alice finally looked at him, The other two also seemed to focus on him.

“It’s true for now that I don’t have the stamina for the three of you. However, it will change shortly as I level up. By that time I will be able to handle you all.” Cain said as he was thinking deeply about how long it might take him.

“Can I say something?” Gracie asked and Cain nodded at her. Sofia pouted as she was the one who is supposed to be Gracie’s master.

“Cain is the housemaster, he should be able to act on his will.” The girls didn’t understand her for a moment before they saw Cain’s face lit up. “So you mean we keep the schedule and I can add more when I have the energy!” Gracie nodded and they simply understood.

The conversation lasted a bit longer with the girls chatting about their days and mission, eventually, even Gracie joined in when they asked her. Cain just stared at them silently admiring the change in his life compared to the past.

They eventually got back into the schedule and it was decided that they will start with Alice, then Selena then Sofia. Cain agreed and said that it needs to be a rule from now on.

Gracie has poured more tea for them and Cain wondered how much did they prepare, there was enough for at least ten people in that pot. Now that he looked at her, Cain remembered her special tea.

“By the way, Can I get a cup of your special tea? I need to confirm how it works and if it’s safe for use.” Cain asked Gracie, she looked at him and said. “I can but it might be hugely disrespectful for you.” Her reply didn’t make sense to him at the start ‘How could it be disrespectful, I asked for it.’ Then she quickly remembered what her special tea contain and nodded. “Yeah, you don’t have to worry about that. I’ve seen worse.” As Cain said that the girls looked at them, what could have he has seen.

In front of their eyes, Gracie bent her head on top of his cup. Gently combing her hair behind in a grace-full manner. Spitting directly into his cup.

“Thank you, I guess,” Cain said as he saw grace gently while her lips. The girls looked at them shocked. They know what properties her spit has but they expected some kind of refinement process before it could be useable.

Cain started steering his cup with a small spoon. “From my extensive knowledge, this isn’t optimal right?” he asked looking at Gracie.

“Applying it directly would’ve been more effective.”

She meant that having her directly use her mouth could yield better results, Cain didn’t want to know how she knew that but he could already guess. That Cubus has climbed another step in his wanted list.

As the other three girls were flabbergasted at the abnormal scene, Cain was already thinking of how he could use this unlimited source of aphrodisiac.

They could bottle it up nicely and sell it, eventually giving the business to Gracie and letting her live her life as she wants. Aphrodisiacs are rare and pricy to a point that she could sell a bottle for about a gold coin.

They could keep it for personal use but that would limit her potential, being their aphrodisiac dispenser didn’t sound that good.

There was another use, venom. It might be an aphrodisiac but Cain could swear it will level up with her. Gracie is now like a snake, the higher her level the more potent her poison (Aphrodisiac) will be. As an assassin. Coating her weapons with it might be beneficial.

For decades, the function of aphrodisiacs had been questioned multiple times. The alchemist said it would take many chemical reactions to get the mind into arousal. Yet the Cubas race seems to have mastered it. Cain was one of those who researched and found the underlying cause of it.

The Cubas aphrodisiac was a toxin, a magical poison that amplifies sexual desire by causing faint and unnoticed hallucinations. The victim might not notice it but it will keep playing in the back of his head, slowly turning him on. Cain tried it for a moment, he took a whiff from his cup and stared at Gracie. Each of her movements started to look weird, her slightly bending forward made Cain imagine her going down to do his crouch, the sound of her breathing boomed in his ear and her voice seemed like faint moaning in his ears.

There was a second effect, It was the one that allowed Cubases to absorb life force from their victims. It will force the body of males to break down their muscles and accelerate the production of sperm cells. This might seem good as it can cause a fertility spike at that time, but just using it a couple of times would cause a noticeable physical change, withering of muscles. This can lead to massive damage to the kidneys as they try to clean the blood from the dying muscles secreted, it can as well damage the testicles and causing to die of overwork. There were also problems with heart failure as the toxin increased the heart rate.

For females, it will cause a whole other list of problems including irritation and itching, and dehydration from leaking too much. Damage to the womb as it will release all the eggs at the same time, which can lead to death. Excessive bleeding if it was her first time, damage to the heart, kidneys, and even the brain from the lack of oxygen caused by shortening in breaths.

In short, it was unhealthy if used a lot or if it was potent. This was why Cain couldn’t believe she was a human at first. Probably a cup up every couple of days was the limit.

Cain sat his teacup close to his bed, it wasn’t the time to use it now. It was getting a bit later so they stopped the conversation and prepared to go to sleep. Quickly cleaning the mess as Gracie prepared Cain’s bed.

“Good night, see you tomorrow!” Sofia said as she walked out with Selena, “Good night master, I will be close so call me whenever you want.” Gracie said as she left and closed the door.

Cain turned around and walked to his bed, he stretched with yaw. “So, why are you still here?” Cain asked.

“Well…I didn’t have that much action today so…” Alice replied and Cain grabbed her head. “I thought you were the one saying I need to rest.” He stared into her eyes.

For a moment, she was scared and then replied, “I would leave if you don’t want me here…” her lips were shaking and her hands slowly grabbed his arm.

“No need for that.” Cain sighed.
