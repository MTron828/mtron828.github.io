Zaleria slowly marched through the city, and each of her steps caused the ground to shake and quiver.

“Didn’t someone just call me the groom? Why do I have to deal with all this shit?” Cain grumbled as he was using [Telekinesis] to move children and small animals that tried to approach Zaleria’s legs.

“Don’t say that, who besides you can do it?” Sofia giggled, Cain’s telekinesis is the most useful spell she saw in her life.

“Should I just forget this spell, I can’t move things from a distance anymore.” Cain cried as he lifted a five-year-old kid and threw it on a haybale to the roadside.

“Be gentler!” Alice yelled at him.

“Lets him grow to be hardy, that’s just soft hay,” Cain replied with an annoyed face.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was the hay used to feed horses and it was soft and fluffy, it could poke through clothes.

“What will you do if one got in his eye?” Alice kept pushing.

“Have my wife heal him, I sure I’ve one capable of that,” Cain replied.

“The compliment won’t save you, don’t throw them in hay again.”.

“Fine.” SPLASH! Cain threw them in the horses watering barrels, the water was ice cold so they all jumped out screaming.

Cain then felt a hand tighten on his neck, “What now?”

“They will die of cold, gently put them on the ground!” Alice wasn’t playing she was serious.

“Fine!” Cain this did as she said and put them on the ground, they immediately rushed toward Zaleria’s legs again.

“See those little buggers. Hey you irresponsible parents, don’t let your children run to the street!” Cain yelled at the top of his lungs.

Keeping the children safe wasn’t easy, there were more and more of them jumping from the homes and alleys, like ants swarming, Cain was bound to miss one and have it stopped at this rate.

Even after a while has passed, very few to no parents came to pick their children up which enraged Cain even more.

“You want to play? I will play as well then!” Cain yelled combing his finger with an evil smile. Alice instantly felt worried sensing the amount of magic he was going to use, if she didn’t know him she would have thought he was about to blast the children to the shadow realm.

[Telekinesis] [Enchanting: Extended reach] [Enchanting: Pre-registered action, Spin 100 turns before stopping in 20 seconds]

Each kid that got close to Zaleria got lifted from the ground and spun until their last meal go out, with that they shouldn’t be able to move for at least an hour.

It was then when Alice saw the city commander skirmish around with his soldiers to collect the children and yell at their parents.

“Finally some people with responsibility!” Cain finally smiled.

“See I told you that you can handle it!” Alice smiled as she patted his back.

“I can doesn’t mean I should do it, that was more stressful they most of my fights.” Cain sighed, he doesn’t want to deal with children like this anymore. If this was the elvish capital, the roads are going to be heavily guarded in such a parade.

“More than our first fight with Morena? Are you joking?” Sofia looked at him.

“Children’s lives are at stake here, it just hit differently. In Morena’s fight, I could just let my magic lose.” Cain replied.

“Throwing a fireball is easier than making sure that fireball doesn’t burn your allies,” Zaleria said with a concerned voice, Sofia should be the one to know that the most.

“I just thought that Cain was better than me at controlling his magic.” Sofia laughed it off.

“To my knowledge, telekinesis can only affect one target and has the power of a bull behind it. The fact he didn’t kill any of the children is enough to make the most expert of mages question his skills.” Zaleria said in a serious tone.

“The church is close-nya!” Selena who was sitting on Zaleria’s head yelled in an excited voice.

When Cain looked down, the whole church ground was filled with people who came to watch the engagement ceremony.

~People are placing bets on whether you will be refused or accepted by the goddess~ Zaleria used the message to talk to Cain.

~how much is there? Give me detailed numbers~

~83% refused, 17% accepted~

Cain smiled since he already knew the answer.

~Hey Kayden, can you hear me~

~Who’s barking in my head~

~Woof, woof, it’s me, Cain. I want you to run to the church and place a bet on me getting accepted. I will lend you the money so hurry, will divide the profit~

Even though Alice could hear the conversation, just Cain’s expression is enough for her to know that Cain was thinking of something bad.

[Summon fey: Mei] Cain then immediately summoned Mei.

“What is it?” Mei grumbled she was in his mansion sneaking around to eat some of the honey the maids were using to cook.

“Take this and give it to Kayden without anyone noticing. You will find him skulking around the church.” [Grater invisibility] [Soundless] Cain then used his magic to camouflage her.

Mei nodded with a grumble as she floated down.

Everyone flew down when Zaleria reached the church ground, she then quickly shifted to her human form to accompany them.

At the church gate, Chad, Seith, Sebas, and William were awaiting them. Zaleria quickly jumped to their side.

In such an event, parents were supposed to accompany their children to the goddess statue. Chad was going to accompany Cain while William accompanies Alice, Seith accompanied Selena, Zaleria accompanied Sofia as the only known relative, and Sebas accompanies Gracie as her foster parent. For Marina whose father was executed. She had Cain teleports Roberta, to act in his place.

Cain and Chad walked first toward the statue and turned around to face the girls. Chad stood still with his chin up and his chest puffed up.

CLICK! Sofia and Zaleria started approaching first. Just like Chad, Zaleria walked with her head up looking all mighty and proud. For some reason the people watching felt that seeing both Chad and Zaleria standing firm with their chins up was disrespectful to the goddess.

In those two minds, they were just proud of their children getting married. Chad couldn’t believe that he managed to stand at his son’s wedding and Zaleria never expected to act like a mother after losing her child centuries ago.

Thud! Thud! Then Selena walked toward him with Seith standing at her side, in the whole church he was the only one walking toward the goddess statue topless which only highlighted his over-jacked muscles. His tense face didn’t help at all, just making him look more agitated than a cat that her meal stolen.

CLICK! CLACK! Then Alice approached with her father in tow, the sound of her heels accompanied by her father’s cane echoed in the large church. Just like the others, William had a tense face that seemed to scream, “I won’t give my daughter to anyone.”

Gracie and Sebas approached slowly with their eyes closed. To this point, Sebas was the only one with a calm face. As they reached Cain, Sebas bowled slightly with a hand at his chest and another at his back, “Master Cain, please take Care of Gracie on my behalf, I hope you two find happiness and fulfillment that I didn’t manage to find.” Sebas seemed sincere and from the heart. It was then that Cain remembered that Sebas never married in his life.

Cain smiled, “You’re still young and strong, we can always find you a wife.” Cain winked at him. Even now, there are a ton of nobles who will get satisfied with their daughters being married to Cain’s butler just to be close to him.

Sebas laughed, “That won’t do it, but thanks for your concerns.”

Cain smiled as he saw some nobles and ladies inspecting Sebas from the back, some were young and some were old. They were all assessing him and had smiles on their faces.

It was then Marina’s turn so she approached Cain with Roberta. Unlike the others, Roberta seemed nervous as hell, the sweat drops can be seen on her forehead. Marina wasn’t less nervous, she could barely walk with the crowd eyeing her like that.

Cain smiled looking at her, she was probably the most normal-looking girl here and that made him happy.
