Cain headed with Mary toward the biggest Alchemy shop in the capital. She walked happily beside him as they passed by the market.

‘I have the heart and Aboleth heart which is stronger than that of a Kraken, I should be able to shrink it with magic and install it inside my body. The combination of a Kraken-like monster, a humanoid, and a dragon is now ready.’

Cain was intending to start his transformation as soon as possible, getting that power was the only way he could contend face to face with the might of the dragons.

“Cain, this is the place.” Mary pointed toward a large shop that was in front of them.

It was the alchemists guild, not to be confused with the adventurers’ guild or the merchant guild, thieves guild, and the assassins guild. Not like common people knew about the last two existence. But the Alchemists guild uses the other guilds to get her goods.

When Cain pushed the door open, the place was crowded with people from all across the capital. From children coming to buy mint to Alchemists fighting over rare herbs.

‘I probably should get her here as well.’ Cain thought it was unfair not to bring her here.

“Excuse me, I will be back in a moment,” Cain told Mary as he rushed outside and into a hidden alley. He there opened a portal with the last dungeon core he has to call Olivia. She was a hardworking alchemist; getting her here was like taking a kid into a playground.

When Cain went into her lab, he found her working on the potions while only in her underwear. “What are you doing?”

“Ah master Cain, it’s been a while.” She rushed toward him with a happy face. “Look at this, isn’t it beautiful?” She showed him a bottle of blood-red liquid, it has a deep crimson sparkle and smelled a little bit sweet.

“A high-grade Healing potion? No this might be even a bit better. What did you do to make it?” Cain was impressed, he didn’t expect to see such a thing here.

“I boiled the Magic water you gave me to concentrate it, add a bit of your blood, red plume flowers, deep-wood moss, and some salt. It worked perfectly.” Olivia said with a big smile.

“You used me as ingredients…Where did you get my blood anyway?” Cain asked, he never remembered his blood being taken.

“Bela has taken some when they implanted the dragon heart in you, she did split it with me in half as she used to sneak some MP potions out of the lab.” Olivia pointed toward the ingredient shelf, a ton of small bottles were filled with a red liquid.

“There is enough to fill a bucket, no wonder I lost so much blood in that operation. I will need to put her in line.” Cain growled, he wouldn’t have minded if she told him. That also meant that Zaleria was in with her, those two witches.

“Wear something decent, there is a place I want to take you,” Cain said as he stared at the half Naked Olivia, she was only wearing her bra, panties, and thigh-high stocking.

‘She even got a weird skill, how long was she staying awake for her body to adapt like this?’

“You aren’t tasting every potion you make right?” Cain asked.

“I do, why?” Olivia replied with a straight face and Cain knew what was happening. Constant exposure to unknown alchemical solutions. It advised not to drink potions if you’re already full but this was on another level. (Drinking a healing potion if your HP is full is considered to be bad, the same applies to MP and SP potions)

“Please don’t do it again, it can be bad for your health,” Cain told her. It might seem like a good skill now but, as long as Olivia was a human, she is still confined by their limits.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

After Olivia wore her clothes she followed Cain through the gate and found herself in the capital.

“Is this the capital? It’s so busy!” Olivia started at the streets full of people rushing to their businesses.

“Yep, it’s unusually crowded since we’re beside the Alchemist guild. I brought you here to register as a certified alchemist.” Cain said with a smile.

Olivia froze in place staring at him for a while, she turned around to a corner and puked what she ate yesterday. She understood what Cain wanted immediately and the anxiety turned her inside upside down. ‘I rarely talked to a human this past month and now he wants me to take an exam…I might have even forgotten how to write my name…’ she was thinking.

“Don’t worry, it’s not that hard of a test, they will just ask you to make a healing potion. That’s all.” Cain tried to assure her as he created a stream of water with [Create Water] so she can wash her mouth and tears.

After that, they both headed inside the guild where Mary was awaiting them.

“I told you, working as an assistant isn’t that bad!” An old man said with a serious tone.

“Master is right, it’s a rare job you know, and the pay is high as well. You could even learn from him and become an alchemist on your own!” The woman standing with the old man said with an annoyed face looking at Mary.

“I told you that I already have a job, I don’t care what you offer,” Mary replied with a smile.

“I’m telling you, you will regret it!” The old man growled.

“At your age, you should be worrying about regret more than me.” The old man felt as of Mary punched him in the guts, those words hurt.

“Mary, what is it?” Cain approached them while Olivia hid behind his back like a scared kitten.

“Who is this kid? Scram this isn’t a place for the likes of you!” The old man hushed Cain away.

Cain felt a vein snap in his head but he was better than this, this isn’t the adventure guild so he can punch him.

“Nothing important, let’s get to work!” Mary jumped from her chair and hugged Cain’s arm tightly.

“Well, old man, sorry for stopping your conversation. Take this as an apology.” Cain handed took a sheet of paper from his pocket and wrote some on it, handing it to the old man, “I hope you find it useful soon.” And he left.

The man looked at the paper but he didn’t recognize the address so he gave it to his assistant to read it, she was the one dealing with all mundane affairs while he was working after all.

The assistant face grew tense, she was either holding a laugh or a scream.

“What address is that?” The old man asked.

“The closest funeral parlor, and the most expensive one in the whole city.” She said with a tense face.

“That kid I’m going to kill him!” The old man looked around but Cain was nowhere to be seen.
