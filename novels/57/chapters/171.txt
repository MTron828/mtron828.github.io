[Seal of charge-less spell: Allow the casting of a spell instantly, works once per day] This works even with her breath weapon, with it she could fire it without the need of charging it. Cain gave it to her so she can catch Morena off guard.

[Seal of the reversed element: Allow the casting of a spell with the opposite element once per day.] Holy magic can become a curse for example. Zaleria can freeze things by sucking heat, Cain gave her this so she can Surprise Morena with an Ice breath similar to that of the white dragons.

[Seal of Etherealness: Has the same effect as the Seventh-tier spell [Etherealness] but is only usable once a day.]

Seventh-tier spell: [Etherealness]: You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for 10 seconds or until you dismiss the spell.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you unless a Special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so. But you can interact with them at your will.

You ignore all Objects and Effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from. Unless you wish to interact with them.

[Seal of the Shielder] Double the defensive capability for 1 minute.

[Seal of the overcharge] Allow the overcharging of a single spell to cast it at double the power.

[Seal of the Titan] Double the physical capabilities for one minute in exchange for one day of severe exhaustion afterward.

[Seal of the legendary resilience]: When HP drops to 0 HP, The seal will activate automatically and make it 1 HP. Works once per month.

[Seal of the assisted control] organizes all types of magic and makes it easier to control. This will make it easier for her to evade burning Cain and his friends with her magic.

“HA!” Cain sighed in relief, and a drop of sweat trailed down his forehead. “It’s nice to work on someone who can take your skills!” He was happy that he finally found someone that whom he can work on without holding back.

“W-what…Kind of monster…you are!” Zaleria was hardly able to breathe, her whole body covered in sweat. Her hands were shaking and her face paled, her eyes quivered as they gazed to the ceiling. The moment Cain moved his hand she flinched, “Don’t worry, we’re finished for the day.” Cain said as he could see she was at her limit.

“R-really?” Her lips quivered, It was too painful for her to endure but she kept silent to not harm her pride as a dragon. What would people say if they knew she leaked a bit because of a human?

“Yeah, this is all for your hands, next time I’m going to do your toes and after that, I will start working on your tattoos.” Cain said as he stood up and headed toward the door, “This all for today, I bet you have your own things to care off.” Cain then left them to their business.

“Take Care!” Olivia said to him as he was leaving. Zaleria stayed silent.

Cain knew it was hard on Zaleria, she wouldn’t tell him she was exhausted, her pride won’t allow her. He has to be considered because of that, otherwise, he might end up breaking her.

…

Back in the alchemy lab, Zaleria was thinking. ‘Keeping my sister at bay, that monstrous elf, his extensive arcane knowledge, and now he had managed to double my strength.’ She pondered as her head slowly drifted to sleep from exhaustion, ‘I wonder…will he consider becoming a dragon rider…’

The deaconess fell into a deep sleep.

…

Cain walked outside and headed toward the city gate alone. He wasn’t truly alone as Spindle was hiding in his shadow and he could summon Alice at any moment.

It was still snowing so the air was freezing, with each breath, Cain’s nose ached. When the guards saw him they rushed inside the barracks to inform the sergeant on command, the man immediately went to greet Cain.

“Greeting Lord Cain, the general has told us about you. Are you here for the mission?” The sergeant said while giving Cain a formal greeting. The general has given them an earful about standing in Cain’s way, especially if Alice was with him.

“Yeah, would you mind giving me a horse and two competent soldiers? I will need their help to finish the job.” The sergeant nodded, he was pleasantly surprised by how Cain managed to not reveal what mission he was doing even though he wasn’t a part of the army. Spies could be hiding anywhere, they needed to be careful.

With two soldiers in tow and a healthy warhorse, Cain raced through the city skirts to lay the traps. He needed the two solder as manual laborers to clear anything that obstructed their way.

The sitting process was simple, all he had to do was draw the magic circle with a stick and then retrace it with the potions. The last step was linking it to the dungeon core so Cain can control them at will. Each circle cost him 10 MP to set.

He intended to work at a pace of 50 circles a day while using the other half of his MP to slay monsters on their way for Exp. The two soldiers snorted at Cain’s scrawny build compared to them at first but when their attitude changed when they saw him burn a winter Giant toad for lunch.

One of the soldiers started to admire Cain’s strength while the other feared it and regarded Cain as a monster.

“Lord Cain, I heard that there is a gallant warrior named Takeshi, do you think you can take him on?” One of them asked, “Why are you asking him? Takeshi would win without a doubt.” The other soldier snorted.

“If it was a swords fight I will lose, if we used magic I will win. If we fought to the death, I will win at mid or long-range, he will win at close range.” Cain said scratching his chin, ‘I don’t have enough physical strength or speed to be able to react to Takeshi’s moves up close, he as well can’t block my magic at longer range.’Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I know it! Did you hear that lord Cain is amazing?” One of the soldiers started, “With him, there is that mage named Yamauba, Cain you match her magic?”

“She might be able to use higher-tier magic but I can close the distance to her instantly, in a death battle I can behead her in one move!” Cain said drawing his sword, he wasn’t just a mage.

“You’re boasting, there is no way you can do that. Even the fastest adventure and soldier can’t move fast enough to evade her magic!” The other soldier couldn’t keep his mouth shut.

“Look there, what a lucky find!” Cain said with a genuinely happy voice, the soldiers looked ahead expecting to see either a stunning maiden or a wealth of gold.

“Where is she?” One of the put his hand on his forehead and strained his eyes.

“Up to the north close to the trees, you can spot him easily!”

The two soldiers frowned at the word ‘Him’ cause it wasn’t a maiden. What they saw made their faces pale, it wasn’t a thing they wished to see.

What they saw was a bull covered in black iron sheets, spewing green vapor from its nostrils. Its eyes glowed red as it grazed on the dead corpse of an elk.

“A gorgon, we have to report it to the guild and the sergeant quickly.” both soldiers to a serious stance, it wasn’t the time of messing around.

“Chill, that cow is weak to one of my magic tricks.” Cain grinned at them, it was time for him to gain some respect from the soldiers directly. He couldn’t always rely on the backing of Leon or William, he has to make it clear that he is strong enough to gain their respect.

“Have you ever tasted its meat? It is a heavenly experience, it melts in your mouth!” Cain pulled his sword remembering that gorgon meat tasted like dry-aged beef.

[Elemental weapon: Lightning] Cain created a lightning sword as it was the weakness of that Iron platted gorgon.
