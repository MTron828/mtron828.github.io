Blop! Instead of blood, acid was what dripped from her neck.

Splash! Acid exploded from her body to fend off Cain as she transformed back into her draconic form.

Worrying about the girls more than himself. Cain flew immediately toward the dome that Yamauba created.

[Elemental wall: Mana] He created a glass-like barrier to protect the dome from the acid, he couldn’t afford to use prismatic was more since it wasn’t healthy to span ninth-tier spells.

A spell that can rain acid over a whole city, a spell that could create a meteor, a spell that could break that meteor, and a spell that could create an indestructible barrier over a whole city. Ninth-tier magic was on another level, using them carries immense stress even to those who have mastered them, for normal people who haven’t passed level 20, one spell a day is a limit.

Cain had already used them twice this day which was a feat not reached by many. If possible, he would prefer ending this without the need for a third cast.

As the acid wave ended, Morena had turned back to her draconic form. A headless dragon that is splashing acid and necrotic magic all over the place in a chaotic rage.

‘She is an ancient dragon. I need to get the heart and spine as well!’ Cain rushed toward Morena’s body with a stab. [Thunder step] [Enchanting] [Enchanting]

Morena’s large draconic body seemed to be moving even faster than before. She swung her claw at Cain left and right.

[Far step] teleporting to her back, [Destructive wave] Cain extended his palm and released a wave of fire magic to burn her. He wanted to heat the scales enough so they fall and give him easy access to her back.

Splash! From her skin, a wave of acid countered his flames, “So you can use the same spell? I will keep that in mind!” Cain then teleported before she could hit him with her wings.

When he appeared on the ground, her tail was swinging like a whip to his side. [Stone shape] He created a wall of stone to protect himself, CRACK! The wall cracked under the force of her tail swipe so had to teleport away again. ‘A fifth-tier spell can’t block her physical attacks? I wish I could see her stats’ since she had already evolved above the first limit, Cain couldn’t see her stats until he evolve as well.

Dodging left and right, Cain slowly awaited a chance for him to attack back. Then suddenly, something that he should have expected happened.

Drip! Blood started dripping from his nose, eyes, and ears. His head screamed in pain, and his vision blurred. ‘Did I push my body too much? Damn this weak human body.’ Even though he was healed with magic and had regained most of his stamina, mental exhaustion has taken a toll on his brain.

This bleeding was mostly because of the accumulated pressure in his head from having to process all of that magic. ‘Shit! I need a short rest…’

Cain watched as Morena’s claw closed to his body. His magic refused to activate.

CLANG! Takeshi rushed in from the side with his sword and deflected Morena’s claw. “I came to help. CHU!” Swinging his blade gracefully at a great speed, Takeshi changed a slash after the other.

Even though he was going all out, the best Takeshi could do was to deflect Morena’s attacks by a hair strand enough not to be killed.

CRACK! Selena rushed in and punched Morena on the back, ‘Yeah, those two have enough strength to contend with her.’ Cain though. Morena had her head severed off, she cannot see, hear smell or taste anything. Even her motor skills have weakened.

Cain before thought that she seemed to get faster but that wasn’t the case, he was the one that started to get slower as his brain began to overheat.

“Cain are you alright?” Alice appeared from his shadow with a worried face, she immediately started casting healing magic on him.

“I j-just need, s-some rest!” Cain replied he was finding it hard to breathe, as he could smell his own blood.

“What happened, could you tell me?” She asked.

“T-too much m-magic.” He played on her lap watching Sofia fly in like a meteor and engulf Morena with [Fire Storm]Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

‘I told her to not fight up close like that, what if she got hit?’ Cain felt his eyelids getting heavier; he might fall asleep at any moment.

“Is he alright?” Lisa came rushing in with a stamina potion, “I don’t know, said he used too much magic.” Alice replied.

“Make him drink this it might help.” Lisa handed her the potion.

“Hold up, I have an MP one.” Daraku came in as well with a potion.

Alice made Cain drink them both immediately.

“But to think he was able to do this much. How did he manage to reach such strength?” Lisa mumbled seeing the wasteland around them. Furberg city wouldn’t have stood a chance against the hordes of undead and Cain just obliterated with a single spell. Even after that, he had proceeded to wipe the ground with an elder lich king and a dragon at the same time. It wouldn’t be strange if two countries fought over him.

Just possessing a single seventh-tier spell was considered a massive feat, and eight-tier spell and city lords can fight over you. “We have to make sure we survive this, he had brought us to this point after all,” Alice said as she gathered her magic [Dusk] She dropped a beam of her decay magic on Morena’s severed neck.

“I fell like I’m going to fall asleep, let me do this at least!” Cain extended his hand toward Morena. As much as he wished to blast her with a ninth-tier spell, he couldn’t do that as his head was about to explode from the pain.

“Wait, Cain! Don’t push yourself too much!” Alice yelled at him but he didn’t listen, he gathered what remained of energy in him to make one last spell.

“Move away from her!” Cain forced the words out of his throat, [Dark Star] A small black dot appeared close to Morena’s chest.

In the next moment, an immense gravitational force pulled Morena’s chest ripping it apart and exposing her heart.

“You have my thanks!” Takeshi screamed as he took his stance “JIN!” He yelled loud enough to be heard from the city. Instead of a thrust, he pulled his arm as much as he could and then threw his sword directly at Morena’s heart.

As her body was waving around, Takeshi’s throw was about to miss. BAM! Selena punched Morena from the side while Yamauba used an earthen wall to hold her in place for the needed millisecond.

Takeshi’s blade pierced her heart directly in a big splatter of blood. Swoosh! Sofia flew right in, extending her arm inside Morena’s chest to finish her off [Fire Storm]

As the crimson flames filled her inside and burned her organs, as the last struggle. Morena released a spell that didn’t seem to have any effect. Sofia sensed that and she increased her firepower just in case.

[Fire Storm] Sofia blew Morena’s back off from the inside and quickly backed off not to be crushed by the falling body.

“Did we do it?” Lisa screamed as she saw the massive dragon fall at last.
