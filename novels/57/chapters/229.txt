“Sebas, do you have a minute?” Cain teleported right to Sebas’s office after he walked out of the arcane gate in his room.

“You got back so quickly, is there a problem?” Sebas replied with a worried face. Cain returned earlier than expected.

Cain waved his hand and shook his head, “Nothing major, I just wanted you to support Marina in ruling Ourals.”

“If I remember correctly, she is Bancroft’s daughter…Are you letting her rule the city?” Sebas didn’t expect that, he thought that Cain would assign someone from Williams strategist to the job. “I would get someone with more experience than her…”

“That’s the point, you have that experience. She will be the cover to keep the people happy. Even though I doubt that with how Bancroft treated them. What happened to him anyway, Gracie should have brought him this earlier?”

“He has been transferred to William’s prison, they are discussion his punishment at the moment,” Sebas replied calmly.

“He started a war and turned his army into zombies, what are they discussing, he should be sentenced to death,” Cain asked in surprise, as it felt weird. He expected him to be executed on the spot.

“They can’t decide between the rope, the guillotine, fire, poison, or sword. Otherwise, he would have been dead.” Sebas said. They were discussing how to kill him, as it seemed a waste to just end him.

“Then tell them to hold on. We had better execute him in Ourals plaza for the crime of tormenting his citizen and wagging war. After that, we declare our support for his daughter to take the lead with the excuse of (We just wanted to help and we aren’t interested in colonizing the city).” Cain said with an evil smile.

“And you want me to lead the city from the shadows since I did work for William?” Sebas said with a shocked face. He didn’t expect Cain to have thought about it this far.

“True, you better hurry before they kill the old fart.” Cain patted him on the back before teleporting again.

This time he headed back to his room and then to the maze. Cain lifted his hand and searched for the two rooms he had just created and locked them. ‘It will be bad if the maids wandered into them by mistake.’

The maze was an 8 by 8 by 8 cube. The inner was 2 by 2 by 2 cube are the rooms where you can see the dungeon core. It was also where you could find Olivia’s lab.

Cain clapped his hands together, ‘I do have some free time while Alice prepares for tomorrow’s trip so let’s play with the maze for a bit.’

Starting from the lower left front of the cube, the rooms are going to be given numbers so they can be tracked easily. [a(Room number horizontally), b(Vertically), c(Depth)]

With that, the core’s commas are going to be [4,4,4] [4,4,5] [4,5,4] [5,4,4][5,5,4] [5,4,5] [4,5,5] [5,5,5]’Those rooms are locked and can only be entered by Cain or someone who has the key like Olivia. This is to protect the maze’s core.

[4,4,4] is going to be Olivia’s Lab number, temporarily as Cain could decide to move it.

For the two rooms with undead and insects, they can be put on [1,1,1] [1,1,2] for ease of use. If someone tried to enter the maze without a key, they will be sent there. Of course, that means mages who try to teleport inside. If one of Marina’s maids wandered inside, she will just get teleported to a white room.

This might seem a bit complicated but to Cain who had 20 intelligence, this was like any other simple calculation that comes with making spells.

‘Let’s create a room that seems peace full but is filled with vicious murderers’ Cain smiled as he remembered a trick taught to him by Sylph. There was a less know race that people underestimated for their size and cute look. He could fill a room with as they are can be summoned like devils.

[Conjure Fey: Pixies] As Cain opened his palm, a green light emerged as he summon a fairy-like woman. She was no taller than his palm and had a plump cute face and two big butterfly-like wings. A slightly greenish skin with orange hair and gleaming red eyes. Her clothes seemed to be made of leaves and she held a wooden twig in her hand.

She looked up at Cain with a smug look on her face. “It’s rare to be summoned to such a place, I could feel a powerful dungeon core nearby. Are you an adventure by any chance?” The pixie asked in a voice that resembled that of a little girl but sharper.

“Look at my eyes, what do you see?” Cain asked her. Pixies were known to have a strong bond to nature, she should be able to sense it just by staring at him.

The pixie flew to face him and stared at his face. Her face quickly twisted into a terrifying smile, sweat dripping from her forehead.

“You’re linked with the herald, why would such a being call me here?” She could sense Sylph’s magic inside Cain. That was due to the spirit stone and his link with her. The pixies worshipped the world tree so Sylph was like a prophet to them, sensing her presence in him was not a thing she expected.

“I would like you to turn this room into a colony, I will provide you with as much Mana as you need from the dungeon core,” Cain told her.

“Are you serious?” She gasped.

“Of course, I’m offering you the chance to become the queen of your own colony. If you did well, I can ask the herald to vouch for you to become the next Titania.” The pixie lived in the fey world under the rule of the fairy queen, Titania. Cain was offering her the chance to contend with her.

“I accept, I accept. But you do expect me to fight, right?” She asked with a worried face.

“Naturally, but I will provide you with everything else you need. If you managed to build an army, you can just send them to assist me when needed.” Cain then cleared his throat and looked at her. “And you aren’t that weak, you know?”

The Pixies smiled with an evil grin, “Then give me a name, I would prefer a short one if possible.”

“Your name is Mei, the pixie’s queen Mei. Work hard and you will get rewarded.” After that Cain finished all the magical steps of the contract. Mei will then start using the Core’s Mana to summon more pixies, erect trees, and turned the entire place into a forest landscape for them.
