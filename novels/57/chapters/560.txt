Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

It was only for a moment that Cain's presence resonated across Dis as he has undone all the limitations he put on himself to protect the girls.

The first limitation he was putting on himself was the mad soul he kept hidden, alongside his chimera. All people were perceiving him as a human in the outside world, here, no one could make a mistake. All devils here could perceive him as the horrid monster he is.

The second one was the number of spells he could use. The more he used, the higher the mana density around him, and the more dangerous he was to live around. After all, absorbing too much Mana was bound to morph life, and he couldn't risk the plants turning into monsters in his garden and hurting the maids.

I took a deep breath, I'm stable. My Mana regeneration is keeping up well enough, I should be able to keep fighting as long as I don't push too hard.

I looked across the obsidian black hills, and a red haze of heat started to rise on the horizon as a flock of black things flew. The ground started rumbling, and the troops of hell were approaching.

The moment I spotted the devils in the distance, I immediately apprised them to check for any danger.

Ok, take this.

Cain spread his arms‚Ä¶Mana gathered immediately around his. Two red magic circles appeared around his arms as he start floating. The devils stopped moving, looking at the sky in despair.

'Meatballs' [Meteor Fall] [Meteor Fall]

Dis's ashen sky and dark clouds immediately dispersed revealing two massive, red-hot meteors rushing toward the devils. CRACKLE! The entire lair started rumbling as the meteors approached rubbing on each other.

KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! They landed in a massive explosion, the ultimate magic that Cain just can't use freely outside, he now can now fling it without worry.

Watching the hellish explosion, Cain took a taste of the enormous Exp he was gaining.

------------------------------------------------

Cain didn't have time to bask in his glory, it's true that all small devils perished, but the higher ones who hid in the back are now surfacing.

From the ashen ground, Exploding geysers of lava formed when he pummeled the dried rivers of obsidian. The powerful devils emerged while the weaker ones began to revive like ants crawling from the ground.

More than I expected but‚Ä¶The more, the merrier‚Ä¶let the madness begin‚Ä¶

By projecting his mad soul, the devils quickly lost their sense of self and turned into crazed, bloodthirsty forces. They will revive over and over to fight and quell their thirst, giving Cain an endless supply of Exp.

ZAP! [Thunder Step] Cain flashed toward them in the blink of an eye, Grabbing one of the pit fiends by the horns. [Telekinesis] He pulled up tearing the head up, Tentacles grew from Cain's back and swallowed the whole devil, integrating him into his body.
