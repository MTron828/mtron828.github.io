Fush! Sofia immediately ignited the worm in her hand giving it a nice seer. Her flames weren’t normal, the magic pushed the heat deep into the worm’s inside cooking it all the way through.

It didn’t take her even a second to have taken a bit of the worm. Cain didn’t even have the time to stop her. Those things are supposed to be disgusting by nature. A thing that no one will eat willingly.

Sofia’s eyes sparkled with a faint green light, for some reason, this worm tasted great to her. Her nose wasn’t mistaken, she knew just after smelling the worms that she would like them roasted.

Something inside her was craving them, the faint energy they release. “Those taste great! Cain give them a try!” She said with a big smile.

She immediately grabbed the acid gobbled and gulped it down in one go, she had the buff (She already had acid immunity due to her draconic bloodline and Cain’s buff only gave her a slight push) [Elemental Absorption: Acid] that Cain gave her.

“This is good as well, it goes well with it.” She smacked the goblet down.

No one had the will to stop her. Even Selena had grabbed one and eaten it raw, she seemed to enjoy it as well.

Cain then noticed the terrified and worried stares Sofia was getting from the devils. She was releasing a faint whiff of her draconic magic which drew their attention.

The chief smiled, “You kind of remind us of the previous ruler, Tiamat never ventured down since she loved eating this layer’s food.”

“The dragon’s goddess that was killed long ago?” Cain stared at them trying to extract any amount of useful information.

“Yeah, centuries ago, a red dragon entered Avernus and challenged her. Their fight took decades and only ended when the challenger fully ate her.” The chief said thinking about the distant past.

“We died hundreds of thousands of times as the two of them rampaged.” Another devil added.

“As you seem to enjoy your food, let me tell you all that I know. You wanted to know about the newcomer woman, the white-haired devil, the location of a sinner girl proficient in cold magic, and lastly about the resistance.” The chief said clearing his throat. Tiamat was long gone and it’s probably rude to bring her name in front of the upper rank.

If Alice was sent here to take care of the newcomer woman and regain the first circle into the devil’s rule. The chief didn’t want to show any attachment to the previous leader in front of her.

He started explaining.

A couple of weeks ago, the woman appeared in the first circle and enslaved a group of low-rank devils. After that, she came into a clash with the Abishai living in Tiamat’s abandoned fortress.

It was around this time that the first signs of the resistance emerged, they were but a group of devils who wanted to rescue their enslaved friends. But they failed miserably and got enslaved as well.

After that, she started sending the Abishai and the enslaved devils to collect food for her and bring it to the fortress.

It was here that the resistance fully took shape under Malta’s leadership.

As they weren’t able to openly oppose the newcomer woman so they started ambushing her food caravans and every once in a while take one of the Abishai down. But this was the limit of what they could achieve, even their leader Malta who was a middle-rank devil could barely deal with the weakest Abishai.

A few days ago, it was the first time that the white-haired devil appeared, he was leading the Abishai group and always looked deep in thought.

He was the first one to address the newcomer woman with something besides words like her majesty, the lady. He called her mother.

The white-haired devil was, according to his words, the newcomer woman’s son. Even though they looked nothing like each other it seems.

Unlike the Abishai and even the other devils or sinners, he was open to talk and reasoning. Having a conversation with him is surprisingly easy.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He once mentioned that he is collecting sacrifices for his mother so she could help him get rid of his sense of loneliness. He had this strange feeling that he is missing something as if a part of him was lacking.

And about the sinner girl who could use cold magic, the village chief hasn’t heard of such a girl. But, apparently, some devils got frozen to death after they ate a soul worm.

They got angry and took the worm after it resurrected and threw it in a ravine to the north. This has happened probably a month ago.

“I see,” Cain said thinking deeply about what he just heard. “Anything else?”

The village chief thought about it for a moment, “A few days ago, and right before the white devil’s appearance. A fight broke out in Tiamat’s fortress after the Abishai caught two prisoners. We tried to investigate but we were getting killed the moment we got close.”

“We couldn’t even see what killed us, a moment we were walking, and the next we were getting resurrected.” Another devil added.

Mary started looking to the side admiring the tent’s simple architecture, and the goblet’s amazing design. ‘I have nothing to do with that…’ She tried to convince herself.

“I understand, give me the direction to the fortress, the ravine, and the resistance’s current location. I will check them myself.” Cain said. This was more information than he expected, but it wasn’t enough. This woman seems to be strong, and that white-haired devil seems determined. Fighting them might be a bad idea since they can resurrect immediately, and this is without counting the Abishai protecting them.

The best course of action is going to find Bela’s daughter first, or make contact with the resistance. Leaving the woman as the last thing.

“Are we going to stay here?” Hati asked.

“No, we’re going to leave as soon as we got the information I just asked for. We didn’t come here to idle around.” Cain replied.

“Be careful when heading to the ravine, that place is filled with powerful monsters.” The village chief warned Cain as he scribbled the locations on a piece of leather (Dried sinners’ skin) and handed it to Alice.

Alice refused to touch the leather as it looked like it was made from human skin. Zaleria ended up picking it instead.

…As they reached the gate, Cain spotted a group of sinners rushing in to attack the village.

Five, titan-looking sinners and about a hundred of Lemure and Nupperibo.

“They are attacking now of all times? Get ready!” The village chief shouted.

‘They must have come to avenge their friends who we just killed, must have resurrected and told them.’ Cain thought with a smile, ‘What a great chance’

“We will deal with them, don’t let anyone out of the village,” Cain said stopping the village chief from ordering his men to charge.

“But we must protect our…”

“We will deal with them, this is an order so sit down,” Cain growled. He can’t let this Exp go to waste.
