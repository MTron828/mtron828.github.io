The chain devils stared behind them, Selena has already finished eating the devil's head. "A Rakshasa‚Ä¶" As one of them growled, SPLAT! His body got torn apart as the chain he was wearing twisted.

Cain walked toward them, leaning on his staff. "I might have killed her once, but you killed her hundreds of times." Lifting his hand, half of the remaining devils got torn apart.

"Cain, leave those here to me. Kill that one." Selena said staring in the distance across the rusty streets. On the balcony of a mansion hanging by Chains, A yellow serpentine figure glared at them once and then disappeared.

"Too much for infiltration, too much for taking the place quietly," Cain mumbled as he transformed back to his normal form. All the sinners in the cage, including Rahana, stared at him with puzzled faces.

'I can save the gold now, but there is no direct way to rule this place besides force‚Ä¶ I did wish to exchange Mammon just like Dispater but‚Ä¶' He thought.

Morena replied almost immediately. 'Don't think too much about it. This place was bound to need a cleaning. Just trample the place and then give it to Alice, she has a [Decay curse] after all.'

'I see.'

"Selena, Jorm, I leave the small ones to you. I will go skin Mammon. But first‚Ä¶" Cain charged his mana, releasing a massive wave that shook the whole city. [Enchanting‚Ä¶] Crackling Mana akin to lightning zapped across the entirety of Jangling Hitter. Seeping from the small cracks to the massive building.

CRACK! The city shook. CLACK! The chains rang as they got loose and the devils stared in terror. The city was still floating, but the chains weren't tight, this can't be real‚Ä¶

Cain took a deep breath, [‚Ä¶Fly] He was the one lifting the whole city, a feat that caused most devils to flee in fear. "Morena, Gray, I need to mix your powers with mine for a while. I will take control over your consciousness." He mumbled.

'Do as you like‚Ä¶' Gray replied.

'I'm wide open‚Ä¶' Morena was about to finish speaking but Cain cut her off.

Puff! He disappeared leaving a small shockwave. The already dark sky has gotten darker, the wind got stronger and a dreadful feeling closed on the city.

[Acid Rain]‚Ä¶A rumble boomed in the sky, forcing it to rain acid. Each drop that touched the chains caused them to rust and break.

PSHHHHH! When a single drop of acid touched one of the chain devils it started boiling, eating deep into their flesh. As they screamed, Selena, Jorm, and the sinners weren't harmed at all by it.

As the devils panicked, searching for the humongous monster from earlier, they felt a sharp wave of magic. Devil, draconic, and something else, something incomprehensible.

They all looked up, toward the highest building in the city, their eyes opened wide, and some even started begging for their existence‚Ä¶The one up there wasn't something they should make an enemy of, he looked like something you only find at the ninth layer.

A hulking purplish-brown humanoid body, too massive draconic wings, goat feet, and two horns that resembled those of black dragons yet twisted backward to resemble those of devils. Long ears and dark hair with glowing green eyes. As he started at them, his body got covered in blue runes that quickly turned green to release acid magic into the air.

"I didn't want to destroy this layer‚Ä¶You have one minute, chain devils. Surrender or I will erase all existence from this accursed place." The being growled spreading his wings.

One of the chains priests, a woman covered in chains emerged from the ground laughing. "Do you think Mammon will‚Ä¶" CRACK! A fist landed on her head, turning her head into mush instantly from the sheer force.

Just behind the devils, there was something else they should fear. Unlike Cain, there was no negotiation with her. CRACK! Selena took a step ahead, her foot cracking the ground. "I will kill you a thousand times." She wasn't even in the mood to add nya.

A Red chain devil roared, "Die!" Swinging his chains at her, but she didn't move. CRACKLE! The chain tied her.

‚Äã "All on her‚Ä¶" The devil was about to laugh but then froze. She lifted her arm as if nothing is tying her. The Chain cracked as she grabbed them in her palm. She started pulling with one arm.

The insane force caused the devil to panic, anchoring himself to the surrounding building with his remaining chains. "Somebody, help!" He cried. CRACK! Selena slowly pulled him toward her as he screamed, his feet grinding on the ground from how hard he was holding.

When drew him close enough, she bit his face off and then all of his head whilst he cried. A loud rumbling could be heard coming from Selena, She then bit the corpse's shoulder off, chains and all, and swallowed it.

"You ate her, over and over like this‚Ä¶I can't understand‚Ä¶what the fun in it‚Ä¶is." She stared at them, her eyes glowing golden as her ears bent backward, her eyebrow crossed with a deep growl and her fangs came out blood red.

A woman leaped out from behind the cage. "She's physical, leave her to us!" The blue chain devils returned after they heard the noise.

The woman crackled her chains staring at Selena, "Fall asleep, beast of the ninth." [Sleep]

A bunch ran on the ground, "Just die!" [Fireball] [Acid Burst] [Lightning]

As Selena stood there, the spells deflected from her tough skin. The devils got taken aback, she wasn't fazed. BUP! She disappeared leaving a crack in the ground where she was standing.

"Where did she‚Ä¶ii!" One of the blue devils whizzed as he got snatched from mid-air.

"Where is she?" The devils cried, unable to find Selena's location. "‚Ä¶iii!" Once again, from the dark alleys, Selena leaped snatching a life with a quick bite to the head.

"You coward! Face us directly." One of the blue devils cried as the fear started getting into his bones.

"GAW!" The last thing he saw was the giant maw ahead of his face. This time Selena dropped him to the middle of the street, ripping his body apart in front of the other devils.

"We give up! We give up!" One of the devils cried, she must stop if they surrendered. That's what that devil from earlier said, right‚Ä¶

BAM! Selena leaped claiming his life, she didn't care.
