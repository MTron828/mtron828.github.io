Cain quickly shifted his mind toward the current time, Jack was dead and his problem have ended.

“Let’s focus on buying some time to work with, as long as we don’t make a fuss about this he will have no way of retaliating,” Cain said while leaning on the couch, his side started to feel numb and his thighs burned. Just sitting for a long time on this leather couch was too much for his failing body.

“You’re right, he can’t just say ‘they killed my assassins who infiltrated their land.’ “Leon said as he took a sip from his tea. “Let’s play the waiting game, it will be to our advantage to have him make the first public move.”

Cain is starting to dream about his soft bed, this conversation must end here. Just thinking about having to make it back home is enough to ruin his mood.

“That’s right, I will then leave the rest in your hand as I need to recover. It must be clear to you I’m not in the best of my conditions.” Cain said as he stood up reliving his backside.

“Yeah, what exactly happened?” William asked as he gulped his third teacup. “It mustn’t be normal that someone could reduce you to this stat.” William pointed at Cain’s frail-looking body.

“A curse inflicted by a fiend we fought, the accursed ran before we could send him back to hell, and left me like this,” Cain growled as he pretended to be angry.

“Hmph, I hope you won’t be dragging my daughter to dangerous places like that again.” William snorted, quickly shifting his glare from Cain standing up.

“Then, let’s meet at a later date. We might even visit you in the coming days.” Leon extended his hand, and Cain quickly shook his hand firmly. At that moment Leon lifted an eyebrow and smirked as he came to a revelation.

Cain noticed the change and quickly exited the room wanting to avoid further discussion.

“Wait!” Leon called Cain as he walked into the hallway. “Wait a minute, I want to talk!”

As much as Cain didn’t want to have to explain everything to him, it was clear that he already caught up with what happened.

“Your assumption is right and I don’t want to talk about it!” Cain glared at him, and Leon laughed in response.

“To think it was Alice who did you like this, how did it even reach this point?” Leon was almost in tears. As you might expect, Alice who didn’t even intend to curse Cain didn’t hide her curse. Any competent mage who is familiar with Alice’s Mana could point out that she cursed Cain. Leon was one of the few people who could.

“Shut up, I was knocked out, otherwise she wouldn’t be able to do it,” Cain replied with an annoyed tone, to him it felt like a martial instructor who lost a tooth to his student’s punch.

“Now it makes more sense, don’t worry I won’t tell anyone. Sorry for what my sister had done to you.” Leon tried to apologize as he wiped his tears.

Cain simply walked away leaving Leon laughing on his own. Not feeling like sitting in a bumpy carriage with his sore lower half, Cain preferred to walk back home.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Goodness gracious, what happened to you my son?” On his way back Cain heard a familiar voice behind him. It was the bath-owner old lady.

“It’s a while, how is your health being?” Cain asked as he slightly bowed to the old lady.

“Hehe, don’t worry about these old bones, I’m as good as dead. What happened to you on the other hand?” The old lady inspected Cain, “Young people shouldn’t look shriveled like a shriveled eggplant.”

“I’ve just been through a lot lately.” There wasn’t any need to disclose anything to her.

“Stacking them is bad, please try to only take one at a time.” Hearing the old lady’s words of wisdom Cain had no choice but to smile.

“I will keep that in mind, stacking them on top of each other is something I haven’t tried though, thanks for the inspiration.” Cain smiled as he gave the old lady the last bow, it was regrettable they can’t chat longer but he was getting tired and wanted to get back quickly.

“Make sure you tell each of them what she needs to know. Letting them stay ignorant will only make them worse!” The old lady weaved as she watched him disappear into the distance.

“Hehe, this one is more interesting than that ignorant and ungrateful young master.” The old lady whispered as she stared at the lord’s mansion. A weird smile on her wrinkled face.

…

Cain finally reached the mansion, his legs were screaming as if he had run a marathon. From the mansion gate, he saw one of the maids tending the flower.

“Can you come here for a second?” Cain called her as loud as he could, as soon as she saw him she dropped the small shovel in her hand and rushed toward him. Her name was Jemima Gardner, she loved tending to the plants and flowers, always sneaking from work to sit in the garden and smell the flowers.

When called, her blood froze in place. She thought he caught her sneaking from work and was about to yell at her. She approached him with shaking steps, being ready to be yelled at.

“I’m exhausted, can you get me back to my room?” Cain asked as he sat on the grass, his body slowly giving up.

Jemima stood dumbfounded for a moment before getting back to her senses, “I can’t carry you there.” She replied as he was too heavy for her to carry back to his room upstairs.

“You were supposed to call help. I was going to ignore you skipping work but now that you’re that out of it, carry me on your back.” Cain said as he looked like a dried fish laying on the ground.

“No wayyyyy!” As she cried, Selena who was on the rooftop for some reason heard them and climbed down.

Sniffing him she quickly spoke, “Do you like sunbathing too-nya?” She asked.

“Are you all ganging up on me? I’m too exhausted to walk, Carry me back to my room!” Cain cried as he wiggled.

Selena who was stronger than most men comfortably lifted him like a princess and walked into the mansion where they were met by one of the maids, or rather she was sent by Gracie.

“The Headmaid says she prepared the bath for Master, please head there before.” After delivering the message the maid bowed slightly as she left without another word.

“How did she…” How did she know he was coming? “Change of plan, to the bath!” Cain said to Selena who gladly carried him to the bath.

Inside the changing room, only Gracie was standing there, wearing her weird one-piece swimsuit to cover her body. She looked like she was wearing something that belonged to a baby with how inflated it was.

“Welcome home master, let me help you today!” She said as she gave him a slight bow.

“Where are Alice and Sofia?” Cain asked as he didn’t see them around, “They went to the guild to receive a reward, they also intended to go shopping afterward.” He quickly got his answer. The reward must be Dolrig’s quest.

“Selena you’re getting in as well!” Cain said as he turned behind him, Selena had already stripped his question seemed pointless. Gracie quickly stripped him up and guided him to the shower.

Cain felt a bit weird having Gracie wash him, Alice or Sofia were normal but having her rub him from head to toe just seemed abnormal and wrong. “Sorry to have you do this.”

“I don’t mind, just call me whenever you need my help.” She replied as she rubbed his lower half with a sponge. As he was looking at the naked Selena beside them and being stroked like that he inevitably got up, Gracie seemed to pay him no heed and finished her work.

“Again sorry.” Gracie looked at him, she was expressionless which made him perceive her as oddly judgmental. “Don’t pay me any mind, I’m doing my work.” She stood up and helped walk him toward the hot tub. It was slippery so he couldn’t just move on his own.

Cain wished Selena could have been gentler with her hands, he knew she would have squashed his best parts if she washed him instead.

As he sat in the tub, Selena sat beside him, being calm for once in the tub and not swimming around. Gracie on the other hand sat on his other side. “How do you feel master?” She asked as she saw his meltdown.

“It feels great. Like my bones are being numbed up!” The heat calmed down his pain as it did on the first day.

“I’m glad you liked it, I have prepared a massage set for you afterward so look forward to it!” Gracie said as looked at him.
