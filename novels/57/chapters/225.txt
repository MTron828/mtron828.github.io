Cain quickly teleported outside as he left Marina to deal with the internal problems. This time he teleported toward the keep gate and decided to walk outside normally, everyone here should know who he is so they will not give him trouble.

As he approached the gate with Alice from the inside, one of the guards spotted them and rang the alarm.

Cain sighed, it wasn’t going to be easy after all. He just wanted to have a quiet walk and now they had to do this?

He stared at the guard who rang the alarm with a disappointed look, [Mist Step] he teleported right to his face.

“Care to stop? I don’t want to end up killing most of you.” Cain infused all of his Charisma into intimidating the man. To the guard, he looked like the pale death, growling curses at his face.

Cain blinked twice as he saw the guard faint, ‘What? Is he that coward or did I go too far?’

[Mist step] He teleported toward Alice, grabbed her, and teleported outside before they get in more trouble.

“I think it will take some time for them to get used to us, not all of them will accept this quick change,” Alice said.

“You’re right, let’s give Marina some time to get everything in order,” Cain said as he started walking down the street.

Everyone was giving them a strange look but didn’t dare to speak. Even the masses seem to know who Cain was at this point. They heard how he annihilated their army with a single spell so they didn’t dare to speak. One wrong word and he might erase Ourals from the map.

Cain wasn’t like that, he was finding it more annoying to ignore their stars than if they were to voice their complaints. “Let’s stop by some random pub, a cheap and old one is the best,” Cain said as he started getting sick of the people’s stares.

“Why is that?” Alice asked.

“If we managed to find one in the slums or an alleyway, it’s most likely to house people who won’t care about who we are,” Cain replied.

“Criminals and people who wanted to take the lord down…”Alice said with a sad face. No matter how good or bad the ruler was, there was always that group of people who hated them. Because it was impossible to please everyone.

“Let’s hurry.” Cain started rushing ahead.

“Wait, if your goal is to get information, we can ask stepmother.” She called him.

“I already knew where to find the village and how to get inside, what I want to know is if anything strange was happening lately. That information Cain takes days for Lisa to collect so I will do the job on my own.” Cain said. He was confident that he would be able to get what he wanted. He also didn’t want to get William and Lisa involved as Fenrir Village was a place forbidden to humans in the first place.

The Fenrir people are similar to dog-demi humans. They are half people and have Fenrir’s. Fenrir was a legendary wolf monster with divine powers and a legendary might.

It was described as a silver wolf with nine tails and blood-red eyes. Fenrir people were his descendant and they were now one of the strongest races of demi-humans.

They lived in a secluded village at the border between the human kingdom and the beast lands. Their village had a strict hierarchy based on the number of tails an individual was born with. The more, the better, and when someone is born with nine tails like founder Fenrir. They are given the title of beast god with the leadership of the village.

“This place seems suitable,” Cain said as he stood at the door of a rundown pub.

“It’s a bit creepy, I can’t get this weird feeling from my head,” Alice said as she felt something off. This place reeked of something familiar.

Cain counted as just the smell of alcohol and walked inside, It was filled with bad-looking faces as he expected. A nice place to gather information.

“Manager, two drinks please!” Cain called as he sat at the counter with Alice.

“Oh my, to think the white mage himself will show at my humble establishment. Are you looking for anything special?” The bartender asked as if it was natural.

Cain smiled, as this is what he wanted, “Just wanted to stay for a drink and a chat, have you heard of the Fenrir village?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The bartender thought about it for a moment before shaking his head and pouring some drinks for Cain and Alice. “Sadly I only know the name.”

Cain took a small sip from his cup, “Can’t recommend someone?”

The bartender slowly shifted his head and looked at the end of the counter, “I heard the village name from him, he asked me about it yesterday.”

Cain looked to the person the bartender was looking at, his eyes quickly twisted and he put his hand on his sword. Alice got alarmed and she started at the man with a terrifying glare.

The man also looked back at Cain, “It’s been a while, lightning one.”

“Hey, Kayden, who are they? Do you know them?” A woman was sitting behind him asked with a scarred face.

“You can talk? Well, I fought them before, they are strong.” All feeling of hostility seemed to have disappeared from him. He even looked a bit more like a human, which surprised Cain. Kayden had only two eyes and all of his demonic features were almost non-existent.

“Reverting in impossible, what are you doing here?” Cain growled at the demon.

“Having a drink, this is my hometown after all!” For a moment, Cain felt a sharp burst of cursed magic from Kayden’s body. “We can fight outside if you want!” Kayden grabbed his sword.

“No stop, we don’t need more fights. Calm down!” The woman grabbed Kayden’s shoulder and pulled his hand from the sword.

“You what he is?” Alice growled, “I know, it’s you two who are starting problems. If you know then don’t provoke him!” The woman yelled.

Click! The bartender served them bother drinks, “It’s on the house so don’t fight.”

Cain calmed himself down, even though most of the people here were criminals, some of there were innocent. Add that they were in the middle of a city where Cain was trying to get his reputation up in. The people would hate him more if he destroyed a couple of buildings in a fight.

Cain inspected Kayden to determine what happened, why did he feel more like a human this time?

‘He gained a new innate ability by leveling up?’ Cain was surprised to see the Shapeshift ability. This meant that Kayden was growing at an extraordinary speed, if not stopped, he will faze right through the level cap quickly.

“Kya!” They heard a scream outside.
