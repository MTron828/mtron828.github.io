Cain quickly pulled away at the intense sensation, the three of them were out of it as they kept chasing him. “Alice. use [Cleansing]”

Even though she was under the influence of Gracie’s aphrodisiac, she had to obey him due to the slave binding. Cain sighed in relive that she could do that, otherwise, Selena would have sucked him dry.

AS the girls looked at each other dazed, Cain took that time to finish stripping Gracie. He gently picked her up and laid her on the bed. She writhed as he tried to undo the zipper of her suit, Cain noted that her arms drew him in and didn’t push him away.

Sneaking a look at her face, it was passive. Cain paused for a second before pulling the zipper to give her time to oppose of she wanted.

“Here we go!” He pulled the zipper and dropped the suit from her shoulders. His face stiffened at what he saw, another suit. He threw a glance at her and she shifted her face away, she didn’t tell him there was another one.

He then took her suit off and stared at her, now he has to take the second one. “This is the last one, right?” Cain asked her as he was about to take it off.

Gracie shifted her face again and didn’t say a word, Cain had a bad feeling about that. ‘This is better be the last one.’ Cain then pulled the zipper and took the second suit off.

She was wearing a third one.

‘Artichoke Maid!’ Cain screamed inside his head and pulled the zipper of the third suit immediately.

His mind stopped for a moment, he could see her white back under the third suit. The pink lines of her bra passed across her back. However, Cain could over seven scars on just the small amount he revealed. He counted burn marks, slashes, and whip lashes marks.

Under his silence, Gracie trembled. Cain noticed and considered his words carefully. This was only her back and he expected her whole body to be riddled with scares. He needed to say something nice and hopeful, and most importantly it must be the truth.

Cain placed a kiss on her back, “Thank god, those can be healed by evolving.” He said and Gracie’s head turned toward him.

“I don’t see any scars inflicted by magic, those can be healed by reaching level 20 and evolving.” Cain pulled her close to him and gave her a hug.

As she froze in place thinking about what he just said, Cain took the chance to fully reveal her upper torso. The scars crossed her whole body and make her look as if she was patched from multiple parts.

She was too deep in thoughts to react to him trying to take her bra off, revealing her soft chest, She was a bit smaller than Sofia. Making her the smallest of them all.

The ranking was Selena, Alice after she recovered, Sofia, and now Gracie. He tried to grab them in his hand and they fit nicely.

Gracie finally returned to her senses and pulled herself back, panicking and covering her chest.

“Should we stop?” Cain asked her if she was reaching her limit it was better for them to stop for tonight.

“No…Just give me a moment.” She replied for the first time in a while. She took a deep breath and grabbed the suit at her waist. Her hands were shaking as if she was an old lady trying to grab an expensive wine glass.

To his surprise, instead of pulling up, she was pushing down. Her breath accelerated as she tried to take the suit herself, this was one of her biggest fears and she was trying to push it away in one go. Cain has already paved the path for her, getting her to this point.

Finally, she managed to take it off. She was only wearing thigh-high and her panties. Cain tried to approach her but she pushed him away “A moment, please…” She looked dizzy. Cain had tried to approach her to check if she was about to pass out, but now he had observed her from his seat.

‘Her blood pressure must have dropped, she did push herself this far after all!’ Cain thought as he took the time to try and remember what is the evolutionary path of the succubus bloodline.

At level 20 she could choose between half succubus or half incubus. She could also choose a half-nymph but that requires her to be a druid mage. She could also choose to increase the purity of her blood which will allow her to choose a half-cubus at level 40. It will be something like the following.

Level 20: [Half-succubus], [Half-incubus],[Half-nymph: Require druid magic], [Succubus bloodline, pure blood]

Level 40 : [Succubus: Require Half-succubus], [Incubus: Require Half-incubus], [Nymph: Require Half-nymph], [Half-cubus: Require pure bloodline]Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

…

The evolutionary path diverged after that to a point it became unpredictable. Of course, higher beings didn’t need to evolve to ascend. A dragon-like Zaleria for example has a max level of 100 she can evolve but she doesn’t have to as she is already one of the strongest races.

Gracie had calmed down when Cain looked at her, she had stopped shaking and was staring at him. At that moment, something came to his mind. ‘She has succubus bloodline so… what if I pumped her with magic?’

When a succubus absorbs magic from someone, they do it through their sperm. The succubus’s natural talent binds the liquid to the person’s magic and draws it out. It doesn’t matter which hole was used as long as it is in contact with the succubus body it will be absorbed. With Gracie only being a bloodline she shouldn’t be able to absorb his magic on her own. With that in mind, he decided to help her doing that in the hope she will awaken something.

[Enchanting: Condensed magic] Cain then condensed 10 MP into his next load and got it ready. He was fully intending to try and feed her like a succubus. He gently approached her, “Am, ugly aren’t I?” She asked, Cain, could feel the deep pain in her voice. He couldn’t read what was in her mind but he needed to encourage her somehow.

“I quite like that, ask them if you want.” He pointed toward the girls resting behind. They all looked confused, he just needed them to say yes. He wanted Gracie to feel at ease and that he doesn’t hate her look.

“Now that you mention it, I was covered in toad puke when you picked me up,” Sofia said before he could stop her.

“I was chained with blood and sweat-nya?” Selena scratched her head trying to remember what happened.

“I could safely say that a skinned zombie looked more attractive than me when we first met,” Alice added up and Cain wanted to scream. That’s a misunderstanding, He wanted to get Sofia out of the guild as they were both stinking. He freed Selena and she was the one to follow him on her own. And he couldn’t possibly let the matter of Alice being a devil unresolved.

“Master has quite, the weird taste,” Gracie mumbled. Cain was happy it at least worked in easing her mind.

Cain approached Gracie who looked calmer than she was before. “Looks don’t matter, what matters is what you can do and what you feel,” Cain assured her as he pulled her panties down, she tried to take her thigh-high off but Cain stopped her.

“Those are better left on.” He whispered in her ear. Alice giggled behind them. Lexi had told her about the order Cain placed after the incident in the kitchen.
