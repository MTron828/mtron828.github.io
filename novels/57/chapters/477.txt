‘So we all go down. Guess it won’t be that hard to protect everyone with Skoll’s help.’ Cain thought.

After slowly drifting down with everyone using [Fly], Cain stared into the darkness feeling a slight headache. ‘Did I overuse magic? No that can’t be it, it can’t be a random thing either.’

“Cain, I do feel slightly nauseous and it’s a bit hard to breathe. Could this be since we’re underground?” Mary said poking his back.

Cain’s mind had to stop for a moment as he looked around. There was only stone and dripping acid and magma. Sylph’s tiny hut should clear everything and make it feels like standing in a flower field, vanilla flowers to be specific.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Could it be a fault in the spell? No, Mary was faking her stats and that was certain. What would she gain from such a lie…Unless it’s not a lie…His mind quickly trailed toward the other girls.

At that moment, Mary coughed. As an expert Cain was in magic and had been keeping her under surveillance, his raw processing power stems from his intelligence. He wouldn’t be able to match her casting speed.

Cain had a 22 intelligence, with his experience and highly efficient spells, he could be said to have the same processing capacity as 50 intelligence. Added on top of that that he has two brains working together and you get a receipt for a monster. That is why his [Telekinesis] could damage a 50-strength dragon Karon, and that is why he could slow time to an almost halt. This is why he could hit far above his weight class.

The great enchanter from his past life didn’t fade or become weaker, he was instead locked inside a weaker body with low capacity. A sharp and well-made steel blade is still dangerous even when its wielder is at death’s door.

Mary was well aware of her own strength as well, and that she is far above Cain now. She cast a spell. Due to the spells’ simplicity, she could cast, end, and stop releasing mana before Cain’s perception could detect her. This was only possible due to Cain being slightly distracted worrying about the girls.

The spell was too weak it deal no damage, too weak it was seen as slightly less than an annoyance, not even consuming 2 MP.

Releasing small steel particles into the air so they can naturally corrode with the acid quickly. This spell resulted in a musty smell of rust that Alarmed Can and the girls.

“This is strange-nya!” Selena rubbed her nose.

“It’s rust, the acid must be corroding our armor and weapons. Can you do something?” Isbert stared at Cain as did everyone.

As Cain started modifying [Sylph’s tiny hut] Mary just stood there. A smile in her mind.

‘I got him distracted from that man’s call, to be breaking through my aura to try and reach him, he must be worth his name at least’ Silver never managed to contact Cain as Mary blocked him, some others have tried doing it several times but she made sure they never face him.

Staying near Cain, meant exactly what it meant. From the day he woke up, he’s been living surrounded by her aura and must have failed to notice it. Just as people never perceive their own body odor since they were born with it.

Cain couldn’t notice her doing anything. ‘To have such mastery over magic, you were really taught by that monster. The laughing tornado Lilia.’ Mary sat beside Cain.

After a while of troubleshooting, Cain didn’t find any fault in the spell to fix. They were perfectly protected. To save time, he wrote it as the cave’s inside corroding and stopped thinking about it. He had to focus on finding Bela’s daughter.

“This place, do you think we will find her here?” Sofia asked with a worried face. “I did burn her really bad, she won’t attack us right away.”

“Witches, or more specifically witches. They have magic flowing in their blood and soul. Here in hell, their soul worm keeps that affinity and they can go insane.” Cain explained.

“We can find her in one of three shapes. A non-responsive stat if her mind had already broken, in that stat she will be releasing her cold magic non-stop in a constant stream. An element stat is when her soul worm is consumed by her cold magic and turned into an elemental-like creature, she will look like a ball of cold wind and snow. Or a normal stat and she is just stuck.”

“What will happen to me if I was in her stats?” Sofia asked.

“What with the weird question?” Zaleria stared at her, “You’re my descendant, and hell isn’t above you so you can break that easily.” She growled.

“Don’t be arrogant, hell is designed for breaking people. I just want to know…” Sofia glared back at her.

“No, Zaleria is right. And you two Sofia, hell was designed to break people, not dragons. You surely will be fine.” He said with confidence.

“Did you hear that? We dragons are amazing.” Zaleria smiled, “But we can do that later, we have company.” Countless giant snakes with bald humanoid heads swarmed at them.

“Gross, what are they?” Both Ellie and Isbert gasped.

GRRROOOO! Then suddenly, they all heard a loud growling sound coming from behind.

Selena started slowly walking toward the worms licking her teeth, “I haven’t eaten enough meat today-nya, and Sofia seemed to enjoy those worms before so I don’t think I have a choice-gaw.” She approached them menacingly with her tails whipping around, it left a scratch on a stone it touched.

“They aren’t soul worms, and Sofia ate them grilled. I doubt the safety of you eating such a thing so don’t do it.” Cain called her from behind.

This place was too small and dangerous to use magic in, the physical fighting style is preferred and Selena was somewhat of an expert.

“I’m hungry-nya!” She yelled staring back at him.

“I will give you more meat, don’t eat them. Just use your fists. And leave four or six alive.” Cain told her.

Selena didn’t reply, she immediately got into fighting mode.

She leaped from one wall to the other, latching with her claws and avoiding the usage of too much strength. She was well aware the cave would collapse if she went all out.

‘They have human heads even though are worms,’ Selena still saw snakes as big worms. ‘As If they are begging to get bitten.’

Thud! SLASH! With a swing from her hand, she cut one of the monsters in half. She opened her jaw attempting to bite the head of another but she quickly leaped back.

‘Only use your claws, don’t bit’ she kept fighting, the more she killed, the more appeared from the walls. Like worms swarming from a dead corpse, those creepy monster never stops.

As Selena slowly started losing her patience as she felt more and more hungry, she never fought for such a long time without eating anything in the middle.

Die! Die! Die! Selena was screaming internally even though she looked calm fighting.

‘I got it.’ finally, an idea sparked her mind. Using one of her best weapons would be just perfect.
