When Cain landed outside, Selena had already killed the majority of the bandits. Cain counted seven remainings, and most of them were scared senseless.

[Arcane Gate] He absorbed the corpses into the maze and walked to Selena. The bandits stared at him approaching the ferocious beast they were fighting.

“Well done, Can you revert now?” Cain patted her on the head; she purred and quickly morphed back.

The bandits’ eyes popped at the strange sight, “What is the meaning of this?” One of them yelled.

“Now fight them hand on hand, try and hold back enough to not kill them in one strike. Controlling your strength is just as important.” Cain ignored the bandits’ screams as he instructed Selena.

She cracked her fist and took a deep breath, they were armed and she was not. Yet the difference in power should be enough to give her an advantage.

“Can I go for the heads-nya?” She asked, “No, this is training for you to learn to hold back in a fight. Sometimes we need to capture people alive.” Cain said.

“Got it-nya!”

Selena extended her fist toward the bandits. Thud! She leaped forward swinging her fist at the biggest of them. She was trying to hold back so the bandit managed to dodge, “That’s too much; try releasing a bit more power!” Cain yelled immediately.

She did not need him to say that, as she already knew what to do, Thud! She switched her stance and lifted her arm to block the bandit’s halberd. Clink! The weapon stopped at her skin, she was too tough to cut, unless the bandit has a weapon made of stronger materials or sufficient strength. Damaging her was a tall order.

Thud! She flashed a punch at the bandit’s torso cracking his bones and sending him flying. To her, he felt as light as foam.

The bandits surrounded her and swung their blades at the same time. Three were stabbing while three were slashing. Being confident in her durability, Selena took all the hits without moving.

She could feel three stings in her body; it was not deep but the stabs left small puncture holes on her skin. They were no deeper than her skin and did not even bleed.

“Stabs concentrate more power in a single point, they might be able to hurt you with that so be careful!” Cain yelled again, this time she made sure to remember what he said.

The bandits seeing that their stabs left marks tried to go for more. Pulling their blade and going for another attempt.

“GAW!” Selena swung her tail at their legs, they did not bother to dodge since it was a tail. Crack! Her tail tore through their knees and dropped three of them down without feet.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Her tail was like a metal beam flying at extreme speed. If a death knight had felt it before; humans had no chance of surviving a tail swipe.

THUD! CRACK! Selena stomped the ground as hard as she could and swung her open palm at their blades. The remaining three bandits lost their wrists from the impact.

Cain watched her with a smile; she had grown into a splendid fighter. Yet she lacked grace and martial arts, to this point she was only relying on her strength and speed.

He was not an expert at hand-to-hand combat to teach her so his best bet was to find someone with sufficient skill to train her.

As the fight ended, Cain teleported the remaining bandits to the Maze as well as their belonging.

They did not have much on them since they were just starting and Cain was a bit disappointed. “Well, it’s kind good they didn’t steal much-nya!” Selena said something that Cain did not expect.

“You’re kinda right, but they still kill and plunder. It’s better to clear them out so they count this area as dangerous.” Since the cities were not able to deal with the bandits, they took a drastic plan. Kill on sight proved the only effective method to scare them out of an area.

Selena stared at the camp disappointed; she was not able to bite into anything and her teeth started to ache for meat. Cain noticed her drooling so he pointed with his finger at the distance.

“We might find something for you to eat in that direction, let’s take a small detour!” He said. Eventually, he managed to spot a small deer, which he let Selena devour.

After that they quickly made their way to Ourals, they could still see traces of the hydra on the walls.

To prevent the guards from stalling him. Cain carried Selena and teleported directly to the keep. His goal was to meet with the lord’s daughter, enslave and leave her to manage the city. In addition, send the previous lord to William and Noel for trial.

The lord’s daughter was sitting in her room tending to her hair with two of her maids. They have all been present when that scary maid appeared and killed most of the personal guards with a stone-cold face.

“Master will come for her soon, better get ready.” Those were the last words they heard from that maid. Since that day, they have been keeping the daughter in the best shape and attire.

Most of the talented soldiers and knights have died in the war and what remained of the guards was just a bunch of cowards. After having half of them killed by a single maid they gave up on protecting their lord and his daughter.

“My lady, it’s been another day. Would you like something to drink?” The maid said with a worried face. Even though the lady was relieved her father was stopped, she couldn’t help but feel sick with anxiety waiting for an unknown man.

“N-no, I’m f-feeling a bit b-better!” The daughter said with a shaking voice.

“You don’t sound like that, you barely had any sleep.” One of the maids said, rushing back to the kitchen to bring her some soup and milk.

After a few moments.

“This seems to be her!” The daughter heard a chilling voice behind her. This was her room and no man was allowed in her entire quarter. There was only one person she can think of who could do that.

She slowly turned around with sweat dripping on her back, she was praying to god she will see a weirdo and not the rumored white-haired mage. She can ask the maids to drag a random guy out but if it was him. She had nothing to do.

The life drained from her face when she saw his pure white hair and gleaming blue eyes. A cat-woman stood beside him glaring at her with golden eyes in a menacing stare.

Her mouth opened and closed, the moment had come and he was here.

[Arcane Gate] Cain used his magic to link her room with the maze.
