509 Problems at the maze II

Cain sighed, not wanting to believe what he just heard. He stared at Mei. “Explain…”

“I did send a group of scouts to gather resources outside and I did tell them to try and recruit other pixies if they met. One of the methods of recruiting was giving them mana, to show what kind of food they can expect to find.” Mei looked hesitated.

“I still can’t see where the problem starts, when Titania comes into play?” Zaleria spoke first and glared at Mei.

“I did say that the queen was a bit addicted to mana, always looking for new flavors.” Mei stared at Cain.

“You indeed did.”

“Well, she caught wind of that and got some of our samples. Managed to guess they were diluted and managed to concentrate them back. She only had a drop of your raw mana but that was enough to get her hooked. Now she keeps sending people looking for us and our source of mana. That’s why the messenger came here last time…”

Cain thought about it for a moment and then looked at Mei, “How about you invite her?”

“She would take over the place, we still lack the military power to face her.” One of Mei’s consultants spoke. The others nodded in unison.

“They are right, I won’t let anyone sit on my throne.” Mei stared toward the grove she built.

This was how a noble feels about a king visiting him. The king always takes the noble’s seat for his stay time and can freely command his people. Not all nobles are fond of this and more saw it as an intrusion than anything else.

There was also the possibility that Titania might try to claim this place as her own which with hinder Cain’s plans.

Cain smiled, there was still a solution. “Invite her in, say that the mana source wants to talk to her in private. Just me, you, and her.”

Mei looked crossed her arms, “That would be dangerous, how do we convince her to…” Before she could finish, Cain gave her two balls of raw mana. They were nicely packed with a protective layer so the other pixies won’t feel them.

As Mei touched the balls, her eyes opened wide.

“One of five percent more concentrated than what I usually give you and the other is ten percent more concentrated. I bet those would make a nice goodwill gift as well as let her know that we have better mana if she asked nicely and respectfully.” Cain said with an evil smile.

Mei smiled as well, she understood what he wanted to do. As long as they convinced her that she will get better mana by letting them roam free, she most likely leave them alone.

“Thanks, we will carry with that plan.” Mei smiled and bowed down.

“Here, have those for you as well.” Cain gave Mei another two balls for her. He can’t let Titania have the good stuff while leaving Mei.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After finishing that conversation, Cain headed with Gracie and Zaleria toward the succubus room.

As they reached the door, he was hesitant to open it up. He knew that why lay behind is a lot to take in.

He took a deep breath and asked Zaleria and Gracie to stand away for a bit. He then slowly opened the door and glanced inside.

He saw all the succubus going at it with themselves in a massive… he closed the door and his thoughts. They are stuck as succubus now…and they have been starving for about two days. Doing that helped sat their hunger a bit but it wasn’t a solution, they will starve to death without any males.

The succubuses inside noticed him opening the door for a moment and stopped immediately. They quickly reorganized themselves and lined up to sit on the ground.

Melissa stood at their front and opened the door, “Master Cain, sorry for the unsightly sight.”

“Don’t mind it, came here to discuss the situation.” He entered with Gracie and Zaleria. He could spot the succubus rubbing themselves on the ground while doing their best to keep a calm face. It must be hard to resist their urge when a male is around, especially when they are this starved.

“You know that Lola has been captured, right?” Cain asked.

“Yeah, we were informed. As well as that she can’t break the curse she cast on us.” Melissa replied with a sad face. They were stuck as a succubus for the rest of their lives.

Cain looked toward Zaleria, “I did inspect the curse. The cure is simple, having Lola break it. But the girl can’t do that with her current skills.”

“So it’s in Lola’s hand…”Cain thought, “I will give a look later as well. For now, let’s talk about a solution for you.” He looked at them and Melissa gulped down.

“We promised to serve you if you protected us from Lola, we won’t break out promise.” She was well aware of what kind of monster will chase them had they broken that promise.

Melissa then stared at Cain’s eyes, and at his pants, “But you can’t leave us starving like this…” she started drooling and one of the succubi pinched her back.

Cain smiled lifting one of his fingers, a black throne rose from the ground behind him. He stared at the succubi and grabbed Gracie by hand. “Sit here…” He made her sit on the throne.

“For a start…she is your new queen from now on. You answer her with yes, or yes.” Cain said as Gracie sat on the throne.

The succubi stared at him and her in disbelief, they sure thought he will be the king. And they will be either his servants or slaves. “But what about…” Before Melissa could finish her line Cain stopped her.

“Hold up…where are your manner? Is that a way to talk to your queen?” Cain stared at her, “Now get on your knees, and kiss her feet.”

“Cain…why?” Gracie asked with a puzzled face, why was he going this far?

“Look at them.” Cain pointed toward the succubi, “Those things really hate half-bloods like you, they see you as lesser creatures and a target for more than just bullying.” Cain didn’t need to explain that part further as everyone knew where it ended. Gracie understood it the most with her experience with Meliliana.

Most of the succubus looked away, “See that!” Cain pointed toward them.

“Believe me, they licked more than their previous queen feet. From now they need to understand who the dominant is.” Cain then glared at Melissa as she gave him a passive stare.

“What are you waiting for? She’s your queen now, unless she gives you the green light, then no food!” Cain tapped on the throne.

“Leader…come on don’t make it hard for us. He’s right.” The succubus behind Melissa pinched her again.

“Will we get you as food if we did it?” Melissa stared at him. She could feel his magic and blood from there, he was an exquisite dish worth more than just that. If kissing Gracie’s feet meant getting him once she will do it all day.

Cain gave her a blank face, “No, I’m not on the normal menu. What you will get is a job at a local brothel in this city and in Ourals, we might even get you one in the capital.”

“Not the normal menu?” Melissa stared at him.

“Yeah, I’m married after all. Unless all the wives suggest it and agree, and I see the need to be urgent and of actual value then it’s another story.” Cain glared at them, “Do you agree?”

Melissa looked behind her and all the succubus were already at their limit, this was an obvious choice.

Gracie was their new queen.
