Cain laid Isbert on her bed. Looking upon her sleeping face he could feel that the cold magic has weakened but is quickly regaining strength.

“Whatever gave her this power, he wasn’t able to finish the process so she ended up with it being difficult to control,” Cain said looking at her.

“Is there a way to control it?” Baltos stood beside Cain.

“If it was me I would have already controlled it, but she is lacking the knowledge and experience. Imagine it like trying to ride a violent warhorse.”

“This is far ahead of what the other doctors that inspected her said.” Baltos sighed.

“What did they say?”

“A lot. Some said she was incurable, some said she was cursed, and some even said she was perfectly fine. Those who tried treating her all ended failing and some even froze to death.”

Cain thought about it for a moment, “Let me get someone here.”

As Cain was about to cast [Arcane gate] he thought ‘down to just three cores? I better farm more dungeons or I won’t be able to create permanent portals.’

As the gate opened, Bela walked in. “How heartless of you master, locking me in for a whole week!” She started poking his cheek with an angry face.

“It was your fault, I don’t need someone who isn’t obedient to a reasonable extent. Check her and see what you can understand.” Pushing Bela away, Cain pointed at the sleeping Isbert.

Baltos backed away as he sensed Bela’s necrotic magic, this was surely the lich-witch Cain spoke off. Having such a monster in the castle’s heart and close to his daughter was nerve-wracking.

Bela gently touched Isbert’s chest and forehead, “Her vitals are fine, but she is stacked, with cold magic.”

Bela then went and inspected Isbert’s nails and hair, “She seems to have an innate ability that she can’t control, but I do have a way to solve that.”

Baltos smiled, this could be the moment his daughter sprang back to life.

“If she has innate magic, why not teach her witchcraft? I am sure she will be able to control it within a month.” Bela said with a smile.

Looking at Baltos’s face, Cain had to speak up for him. “Let’s leave witchcraft as the last option, only if she asks for it. For now, tell us what that innate magic is.”

Bela sighed, “Fine, it’s hard to tell. The power is uncompleted, but I can tell its source. I did research it for years after all.”

“Just speak up.”

“The Absolute peace, a prophecy of the world end. It says that upon a time, the Ice hero Absolute zero will reincarnate himself into the world and freeze it as revenge for being abandoned in hell. But her case is a bit different.” Bela put her hand on Isbert’s forehead.

“The hero was supposed to choose a male and incarnate his consciousness first. But she is a woman and he seems to be giving her power unconditionally which is strange, or the prophecy can be meaningless.”

“I do remember reading about something similar in your room. So the solution is…” Cain looked at her, he wanted a cure, not a history lecture.

“Contact the man himself, if he was willing to give her power, he surely will reply.” Bela sat on a chair, she knew that it was a problem.

Cain stood thinking as Baltos gave anxious looks, the situation seemed grave in his eyes.

“This is a pain…” Cain sighed and Bela stared at him, she knew that face.

“Don’t tell me you know how to open a hell gate.” Bela gasped.

“Well, that…”

At that moment they heard the guards roaring in the garden, Zaleria has arrived.

~Cain come here quickly, we have a problem~RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Hearing Zaleria’s call, Cain went toward the garden immediately. The guards were terrified at the massive dragon who just landed in the garden.

Zaleria was carrying an orc male in her hand, he seemed injured but extremely energetic. As Cain approached her, she released the man and transformed into her human form.

“Tell him what you told me earlier!” Zaleria growled at him.

“Human, kidnapped, the children, offered.” The orc struggled to speak, he either can’t or was terrified.

Cain wasn’t going to wait so he grabbed the orc’s head and used [Dragons’ Modify Memory] to read the creature’s thoughts without changing them.

What Cain saw was foggy and strange, but it was clear enough for him. A bunch of adventurers raided the orcs’ camp a few years prior and kidnapped half of their population, this orc was a child at that time. They were blinded and dragged to a strange location where they were forced to breed and create sacrifices for a strange cult. One day this orc managed to escape by pretending to be dead and getting thrown into the sewers.

“I got the picture. Zaleria did you whip their nest?” Cain looked at her.

“I didn’t, this orc approached me alone trying to negotiate. I thought it was better to have you decide.” Zaleria replied.

“Kill…Them all…every last one.” The orc mumbled as he passed out from exhaustion, Zaleria wasn’t easy at him flying all the way here.

“Treat his wounds and let him rest, don’t harm the nest,” Cain said and turned toward King Baltos.

“It’s confirmed, you have a cult here. We have to root them out.” Cain was serious.

ρꪖnᦔa (nꪫꪣ)ꫀ​ꪶ​ “Are they the ones behind Isbert’s condition?” The king growled ready for war.

“I don’t think they meant it directly. They might not even know about what happened with her. But they are a problem nonetheless and probably the ones who opened a hell gate, we should stop them and we might get some answers.”

“I understand, I will inform the guards to start a full searching mission.”

“No, just let the secret force and me do the searching, we don’t want to alert them,” Cain said as he walked with Baltos inside the castle.

“Want to catch them red-handed?” Baltos looked confused.

“I don’t want them to run, I honestly don’t care if we have evidence against them or not. I will just kill everyone who is a member of the cult.” Cain said. In his book, it was stupid to leave something that was clearly evil even if they didn’t have evidence.

Seeing Baltos stare at him Cain said, “Do you intend to stop me saying they need a trial?”

“No…”

“Here you have, if even the king didn’t care then it was fine. You’re the one who dictates the law after all.”

“How about the church? They are extremely against killing without a trial.” The king said with a worried face. Both he and the church were fighting for power, such an incident can spell trouble.

“We can just give them a cursed item and they will agree, even if the cult didn’t have one I can get one myself.”

“You’re awfully confident to say in front of the king.” Baltos grinned, Cain had just admitted to having access to cursed objects.

“A King? I only see a father who is yearning for the blood of the people who hurt his daughter.” Cain smiled.

Baltos started to laugh loudly, “You seem to know me well, probably even more than my wives. Just give me a moment to get my armor.”

Suddenly a soldier came rushing in, “Your majesty! Your majesty something big happened!”

“What is it?” Baltos didn’t expect such a quick result.

“In the guild! A single man is wiping the floor with all the S-rank adventures!” The guard cried, this has never happened before.
