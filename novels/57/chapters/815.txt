Chapter 816  The Gods' night IV

Selena thrusts down as hard as she could, almost crushing Cain's flesh as she smiled, sweat dripping across her back. She could feel him pushing deeper into her insides, trying to force her to stretch out.

Selena growled, tightening her insides around Cain's flesh as she looked up. Katherin approached her from the back, licking her from the neck down to the base of her tail

Selena shivered, and Katherine slowly pushed her tongue inside her back end.

Selena gasped, bending forward onto Cain's flesh as her hips writhed.

Cain smiled, "Do you think you can keep me down?"

Selena smiled, "Move me away if you Can-nya."

"Then let's wrestle it out." Cain smiled, taking a deep breath. SWOSH! His left arm swung, grabbing Selena by the hair and pulling to the side. In the blink of an eye, he was on top of her. "I told you I can,"

Selena smiled, swinging her legs to grab his waist in a leg lock, but Cain was faster than her and did a simple move. He pulled out and shoved his flesh in her back end.

"NYAAAAAAA!" Selena gasped, splashing Cain all over his chest and stomach as her body arced back. "I know you like it," Cain pulled back and thrust again, causing her to climax again.

Katherin stared at them, "I'm the one who made her ready," she looked at Cain, "I will go next,"

Cain looked at her, "Sorry, but can you help Rahana before that?" He looked at Rahana who watched them with a red face, terrified at the thought that Cain's massive flesh would go inside her."

Katherin looked at Rahana and sighed, "Fine, as long as I get a bonus."

BAM! Klara walked behind her and smacked her head with a chop. "You're a maid, do what he says without questions." She glared at Katherin as she curled into a ball, grasping her head.

"Sorry..." Katherin cried, glaring at Klara with tears in her eyes.

"It's fine," Cain said, violently thrusting into Selena's butt. "I will do what she wants. I won't tell any of you a no,"

"NYAAAAAAAAAAAA!" Selena cried, feeling Cain's flesh expanding inside her and going deeper and deeper inside.

It only took Cain a few seconds to see her about to climax. He awaited the right moment, and emptied his load inside her at the same time, filling her inside till her stomach almost bulged.

Cain pulled out, leaving a white stream gushing out. He looked at Rahana, but she didn't seem that appetized with his flesh just coming fresh from Selena. He looked at Gracie, but that shifted his attention to Selena.

Cain grabbed Selena by the legs and turned her around, putting her face where her butt was. He then slowly shoved his flesh down her throat, where he did a few thrusts to clean it off. Selena smiled as he pulled out, giving him one last leg, as if she wanted more. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Cain turned toward Rahana and waved his palm, "Come here. It's your turn."

Rahana approached him with fearful steps, sky, and shaking as if she was walking on eggshells. She gently covered her chest with her right forearm and crotch with her left palm.

"Everyone can see you," Cain smiled, pulling her to sit on his thigh.

Thud! When Rahana sat on his leg, she felt as if she was sitting on a soft rock, a strange feeling that can't be described, being in the arms of a god.

She could feel a strange sense of peace and looked at her hands. She then looked back at the girls, knowing their strength, but all her fears has disappeared.

Amaterasu looked at her with a smile. "Universal peace. You're sitting in the hands of the strongest being alive. Nothing can harm you besides him."

"Lady Sun here is right," Lilia smiled, "Cain's arms are the safest, and most secure spot in this world. And considering how lenient he is, You can probably do what you like." She approached Cain and floated around his head, "Isn't that right? My god."

Cain sighed, "I can deny it, but there could be someone stronger than me outside."

"That can't be," Kossuth growled in the back, "I will make sure you remain the strongest."

Cain smiled, looking at Rahana, "Well then, leaving them aside, what do you want to do?"

Rahana looked down in embarrassment, but she saw Cain's flesh and quickly shifted her gaze away. "This is my first time, so can we go with something easy." She looked at Cain, "Hopefully, a less painful one than what she got." She looked at Selena.

"You don't say the Nya." Cain noticed and patted her ears.

"Nya!" Rahana gasped, and Cain giggled.

"So, if you're thinking about what you say, you don't add nya. But when surprised, or speaking naturally it comes out," He grabbed her tail with his second hand.

"That's true." She smiled.

"So what, do we have here? A virgin little cat." Cain tickled her flower, "It's too small and tight. I need to get smaller for you." He kissed her, and her body jerked, shaking as his fingers touched her.

"It feels weird," Rahana gasped as their lips moved apart, and she looked at his face with tears in her eyes.

"Don't worry, it's natural. Just relax," Cain slowly went down, kissing her cheek and then neck, and finally reached her chest, where he started sucking on her nipples.

His hands grabbed her from the armpits and lifted her up slightly as his flesh got smaller. The tip tickled her entrance, as he slowly lowered her down, increasing the pressure while making her focus on her breasts.

"Cain, it hurts," Rahana cried, grabbing onto Cain's back with her claws as her toes curled. She could feel his flesh pushing on her hymen, stretching it out/

Gracie walked toward, them, standing behind Cain and looking at Rahana in the eyes. "I can kiss you if you want the pain gone." She said.

"No, I don't want it gone." Rahana shook her head, looking at Cain with a smile. "I can take it."
