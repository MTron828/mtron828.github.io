As the time started flowing normally again, Cain’s head rolled on the ground to Alice’s Sofia’s. The bulky man lifted his finger and pointed at it, “Burn!” A flash of light scorched Cain’s head into ash.

Everyone stared in shock, what has just happened?

#RUN!# A voice rang in Ariel’s head, and Chauntea screamed. In the next moment, as Ariel was about to open a divine gate, the entire place got covered in cursed magic. All the plants started to wither and rot as Alice started walking toward the man in her Devil form.

“A devil…no…What are you?” The dragon said calmly as holy magic started seeping from Alice’s body.

“Die!” Alice lifted her hand pointing at him, her bat-like wings quickly got covered with black feathers. A purple blast flashed toward the dragon from her hand in an instant.

With a single swing from his hand, he deflected it, “A mix of holy and cursed magic? A fallen angel…didn’t your kind get extinct.” He said keeping his calm face.

“GRA!” A fiery kick landed on the dragon’s face, it wasn’t Sofia but Zaleria. “A wyrm, ah I see, you’re her daughter.” The dragon smiled.

“Then you know of this…” A blast of white flames emitted from her foot in a massive jet of fire. The dragon was sent flying backward but without a single scare, he was immune to fire.

CLANG! Farryn smacked him with her hammer as hard as she could and Ariel who was about to run with Chad attacked with her bow. “Keep him busy!” She said.

Ariel was using the majority of her fading magic to keep Chad Alive, he was technically the summoner so if he died she will be forced back to heaven.

Gracie Grabbed Cain’s body and moved it to Alice to start healing him, he was still Alice but barely hanging.

Sofia was just standing there shocked, her eyes focused on the ashes of Cain’s head…

‘Cain…dead…’ her blood started to boil, droll started dripping from her mouth, every drop boiled and ate away at the stones on the ground. Pulses of cold magic and fire magic could be felt coming from her body.

“ROAR!” Selena snapped, unleashing her berserk and rushing at the dragon with [Thunder Step]

“Don’t, he is far…” Farryn yelled, this was a Great Red, Selena can’t do any…

CRACK! Selena’s fist connected to the dragon’s face with a loud painful noise. Her extreme strength and hardness accelerated to the utmost limit with [Thunder Step] resulting in a strike that far outmatched her level, the dragon felt it more than Farryn’s hammer.

But, to all his drawback, her knuckles broke, that was the painful noise.

“I see, he had quite the collection.” The dragon said grabbing Selena’s second fist, “Go to bed cat…” Crack! A single punch from him left a gaping hole in her stomach and took her out of the fight.

“Focus on me, you bastard!” Zaleria growled sending a punch toward him.

“A lot of people would pay a lot for you, stay down for now!” The dragon suddenly appeared behind her, delivering two punches. One at her spine and the other at the back of her head. Zaleria got temporarily knocked out from the impact.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

BAM! Farryn swung her hammer at the back of his head but he easily caught it without looking. “Used to fighting us in a group? Your ‘distraction’ isn’t here.” He spun around and punched her in the chest aiming for the heart, lucky her armor deflected the blow.

BAM! Farryn swung again, and the dragon blocked with his hand. Thud! She took a step back and delivered a fort kick with all her weight behind it. “You keep talking, are you buying time?”

“He was the only one here able to wound me, now he is dead. I want to uncover who killed all of our brethren now.” He said grabbing Farryn by the leg and smacking her on the ground.

“You alone can’t do anything!” He smacked her again and again, finally throwing her away like a stick.

“Who’s left…” He looked around, “Guess this is it, I will take his body and…” He suddenly felt something swelling behind him, the feeling reminded him of the king.

“Who?” He immediately turned around to see a blazing barefoot about to smack onto his face.

Thud! He immediately dodged to the side by something grabbed his hair and he got kneecapped in the face. BOOM! The entire area around them exploded in a splash of boiling acid.

As he felt a slight stink on his face, he leaped away to discern who was it, this presence was weak yet unique. Standing them with her eyes glowing green, Sofia’s arms, neck, legs, and cheeks were covered in Black and Red scales, her wings were flapping faster than bees and the air around her was morphing from the heat.

“A king seed? No, you only have Black and Red blood.” The dragon said lifting his palm.

“Angry that your husband died? You killed my wife as well, feel free to suffer as well.” At that moment he flashed toward her and grabbed her by the face.

No matter how much she struggled, kicked him, or exploded in his face, he didn’t let go.

[Volcano] The dragon finally cast a spell, it was a ninth-tier that forced a mountain to erupt into a volcano for a day.

The mountain top near the capital exploded and lava started to flow like rivers, the sky was covered with thick dark clouds and the heat got high enough to make it hard to breathe.

“This is your grave, die as your birthright dictates!” The dragon kicked Sofia in the guts. Her ribs shattered from the force of the kick as her body fell into the molten magma.

As a tradition of the dragons, there is only one king able to use more than one element. When a king seed appears, they hunt it to death. Only those who survive have the right to challenge the current king. When those seeds die, they are buried in volcanos so they are completely erased. Even the bodies of red dragons can’t endure the crushing pressure of the earth’s heart.

The dragon flew back to the battlefield after he finished burning Sofia, eliminating a seed that might get him something from the king.

…

~Chad! ~…A woman’s voice called ~Chad!~…She called again…~Cain is about to die…~

Beside Chad’s body, Ariel was sitting there silently focusing on blasting his charred body with as much healing magic as she could. She had even created a direct link to heaven to draw from Chauntea’s divine energy to heal him.

The dragon landed, looking around, he should finish them all before heading back.

Ba-boom! Ba-bump! The dragon suddenly heard something faint in the distance.

Ba-boom! Ba-bump! Ba-boom! Ba-bump! It was getting louder and louder.

“A heartbeat?” He looked in the sound direction.

~…Stand up…you have to protect our son, don’t you?~ The voice in Chad’s head asked.

The dragon froze in place, a cold shiver ran down his spine as he had never felt in centuries. From Ariel’s direction, a wave of bloodlust was directed toward him.

Chad’s charred corpse was glaring at him with glowing golden eyes.
