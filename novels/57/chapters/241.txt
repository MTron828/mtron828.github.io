Flying above the village, Cain looked down and extended his arm. “I do remember you blowing Edward with a single breath. Would you mind doing that again?” He asked.

Zaleria looked at him in confusion, “Edward isn’t here so I can blow him.”

“Sometimes I think you lower intelligence than what your stats say. I will pour water from the maze and blow that at the city. With how strong your breath is, you should be able to give a nice spread.”

The two of them flew around the city putting the flames out. Soon enough, Alice and the girls rushed to the city to help heal the injured.

“How is it going?” Cain asked Mei who flew back to him in her small form. “I would say one in each five has died. But thanks to Alice’s holy aura the rest are holding to life. The other two are still sleeping they said.” Said Mei.

“Cain, some people are bearing their weapons. They aren’t Fenrir demi-humans.” Zaleria said. This time she warned Cain the moment she felt something.

…

“You’re a skilled one, would you mind joining us?” A man approached Alice. She didn’t even look at him and kept focusing on healing the injured.

“What did you say?” Sofia who was helping Gracie carry the injured people to Alice growled at him. Selena and Kayden were out helping the Pixies dig out the rubble and search for the remaining people.

“Our Lord has blessed up today, not only did we win against the Fenrirs, but we also met such a talented healer. Join our ranks and you will have a future brighter than gold itself.” The man said with a crazy smile on his face.

“What are you talking about? Who are you anyway?” Sofia stood between him and Alice.

The man stood still. Looked at his friend beside him. “Use that…”

“As you order…” In the second man’s palm, a glass cube started shining. CRACK! The man disappeared with a shattering noise. Alice did disappear as well.

“This was a gift from our Lord, a dimension room. My friend will take his sweet time convincing her.” He started to laugh. Sofia and Gracie looked at him with exhausted faces.

“Does your friend know who he looked himself up with?” Sofia asked with a smile. That man just now was far weaker than Alice was. He is in for a surprise.

CRACK! A small portal appeared. “He seems to have finished, as expected, she gave up easily.” The man laughed.

Tip-tap! Alice walked out of the room with a smile on her face. In her hand, she carried a human skull that was slowly turning into dust.

Locking himself with a devil didn’t seem to be a wise idea.

“That has been a nice stretch.” Alice stretched her arms and bent again to continue healing the injured. “Kill him and anyone else like him.” She added up.

Without even replying, Gracie disappeared into the shadows and appeared behind the man. Twisting her metallic wire around his neck, she cut it right off.

Sofia looked at him with a confused look, ‘Who are they? He didn’t even state his name.’

…

Up on a hill, a man was staring down at what was happening with binoculars. ‘They failed, how did that happen? That healer can do me more than being an amazing healer. That maid is skilled as well, was that the rare shadow magic?’

He handed the binoculars to the men standing behind him. “Get ready. We will attack a second time.” He ordered them.

Thud! “Commander, someone just landed behind us!” One of his men yelled in distress.

Commander rushed to see who it was. As he expected it was the man who put the flames out.

“Such a talented mage. Our lord has ancient knowledge and could give…”

“Shut up!” Cain cut him immediately. Since the dragons have killed their god. A lot of people started worshipping them as god slayers. Those idiots in front of him are a part of the dragon cult. Their lord should be the earth dragon who fought the beast god.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The commander scorned Cain’s harsh tone but proceed to continue. “See all of those devote believers of the gods? What did they gain, in the end, they will just end up in hell. On the other hand, our lord can…”

“I told you to shut up!” Cain cut him again, “I’m not here to debate your ideas. I’m here to demolish them.” [Elemental Weapon: Dual Shadow daggers] Two black daggers appeared in Cain’s hands. They were made from condensed magical darkness.

“You!” The commander growled in rage. He had never met someone who never gave them chance to speak.

[Short Invisibility] [Soundless] [Lesser Empowerment] [Swiftness]

Cain instantly disappeared and cut one of the soldiers down. When the other tried to attack him he used [Shadow Cover] to hide in the shadows and appear behind them for a quick kill.

“So you’re the one who taught that maid how to fight?” The commander growled as he pulled his mace.

Tap! He felt something tap on his shoulder, “Who is it, I’m going to fight!” When he looked back, he saw Zaleria smiling. She was readying her fingers to flick him.

With a single flick, she blasted his arm off. “We need you alive so don’t move.” She said.

“W-wait, this presence! No wonder he didn’t care about our off, he already has a lord. Why can’t we work together?” The commander cried. He seems to have recognized Zaleria as a dragon immediately.

“What are you talking about?” Zaleria asked. She did understand what nonsense this man was spitting.

“He worships the earth dragon who just fought the beast god. Now he thinks that I worship you. Now he was asking why we can’t work together, as we’re both dragon worshipers in his mind.” Cain jumped in. He seems to have already cleared all the soldiers.

“You finished?” She asked.

“Yeah, let’s do a quick interrogation shall we?” Cain said as he approached them.

…

On the other side. Selena and Kayden were helping the villagers to move the rubble away.

“Who we have here-coo!” A voice rang in the air, “A demon and a black cat-coo!” Cock-a-doodle-do…

Selena looked at the distance. Standing on a rock, a half man half rooster stared at them.

“Who are you?” Kayden growled at him. If he didn’t get an answer quick, he was ready to turn the thing into dinner.

“Even so, you seem to be helping the villagers-coo. How far did I fall-coo?” a deep sadness in his voice. Doodle-do…

“What are you talking about?” Selena stood up. She had a general idea of what this man was. Cain had mentioned them before when Gracie fought the Dark rooster. Is this man a Kenku?

“To spare my people their suffering, I shall be the one to dirty my feathers-coo. May the light of dawn shine on whoever dies today-coo!” cock-a-doodle-do!

The Kenku disappeared as the sun started to rise behind his back. Thud! He appeared right in front of Selena.

Cooocaaaa! He delivered a straight punch at Selena’s torso. She was caught by surprise so she braced for the impact.

The hit was lighter than she expected, for a moment Selena was relieved thinking that her strong muscles absorbed all the impact.

The moment she relaxed her muscles struck back. The Kenku twisted his palm and she could feel the massive impact of his strike rattle her bones. BAM! She was sent flying backward.

“For monsters like you-coo, a slowing my strike at the last moment is enough for you to let your guard down-coo!” The Kenku said as he took a stance.

Thud! Kayden appeared behind him and swung his blade. The strike was too fast for the villagers to see.

Clang! The Kenku’s head twisted and he blocked Kayden’s attack with his beak. “Human skills and the power of a devil. That’s as inefficient as it gets-coo!” The Kenku turned around and swung his fist at Kayden which was blocked.

Clang! Clang! The Kenku’s fists seemed as hard as steel as he exchanged blows with Cain’s sword. The only two who knew else were Kayden and Selena. The Kenku masterfully avoided the edge and deflected the blade by hitting its side.

[Hallucinatory Terrain] The area immediately changed into a dead wood forest with rotten trees and a strong stench of rotting corpses. [Demon Blade] [Blade flow] [Triple Slash] Being irritated at his attacks being blocked by an unarmed man. Kayden immediately went all out into slicing the walking chicken in front of him.

Cock-a-doodle-do! The Kenku’s screech immediately cleared Kayden’s [Hallucinatory Terrain] It came as a surprise that he hesitated for a moment.

“Die!” Kayden growled as he swung his blade.

Coocaa! The Kenku blocked all of Kayden’s slashes but ended up being blasted away toward Selena.

“GAW!” She swung her fist as hard as she could.

Swoosh! The Kenku twisted his body in mid-air. His feet grabbed onto her fist and used her as leverage to spin and land behind her back.

“You lack skills-coo!” The Kenku punched her in the back and flung her toward Kayden. She rolled to the ground and quickly regained her balance and growled.

The Kenku menacingly walked toward them spreading his arms as the sun shined behind him.

Cock-a-doodle-do!
