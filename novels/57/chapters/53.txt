The basilisk has entered a state of rage, forgetting its laziness as he smelled the scent of his mate’s blood.

His eight legs threw off the dust as its claws plowed the ground, the monster’s eyes were firing petrification in all directions, turning any living thing it sees into stone!

Running sideways as if it was drifting to keep an eye on his mate’s location, the basilisk tried to get in range. The monster was out for blood, even if it was the last thing he will do!

Magic:

[Petrifying gaze]

————————————–

“Run! If you got within 60 feet from it you will get petrified!” Cain screamed as he slithered his hand to Sofia and Alice necks. [Swiftness], [Swiftness].

[Swiftness], [Short invisibility], [Lesser Empowerment]. Cain quickly disappeared to avoid the basilisk gaze, engaging at close range.

As soon as Cain got close enough to strike, the basilisk suddenly took a sharp turn, swinging it’s massive tail toward Cain! As he didn’t expect the attack, Cain had to attempt blocking it with his sword. CLANG! The sound of metal clashing was heard.

‘Did he hear or smell me? I forget to use [Soundless]’

Cain had touched the basilisk which is a living thing so his invisibility broke!

‘Shit!’ [Short invisibility] Cain managed to back down before the basilisk could look at him, [Frostbite].

Grawwwwwwwwww! The basilisk growled as it backed away from Cain’s magic. It was a cold blooded creature and it hated the cold as all hell.

[Firelance] Crashed beside the basilisk, Sofia tried to snipe it from afar but missed. She wasn’t going to just sit and wait, [Firebolt], [Firebolt]! one missed and the other hit the target in the tail!

‘Sofia can only use fire magic, lets use fire magic as well than!’ Cain thought it was stupid of him to cool the basilisk with [Frostbite] just for Sofia to heat it back up. He instead choose to go with fire as well!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As the basilisk couldn’t see Cain it swung it’s tail in a circular motion to try and hit him.

Cain jumped, dodging the first swing, yet he didn’t expect it to keep swinging and he was hit with the second one, cracking his left leg.

His invisibility broke again!

‘NO!’ As he realized he was hit, the basilisk was already looking at him in the eyes. The petrification quickly started, turning Cain into motionless stone!

[Firelance] Sofia sniped the basilisk head just before it bite Cain’s petrified body.

“Get away from him!” As Sofia screamed with anger, her voice seemed to echo deep into the basilisk body, striking it with an immeasurable fear and forcing it to back away for a moment!

Sofia didn’t realize it herself but it was her charisma on the work! The effect of charisma can be transmitted through look, voice, and attitude. Her anger and fear for Cain’s well being have been transformed through her high charisma into pure intimidation power, to the basilisk she seemed like the most terrifying of them all!

[Cursed Decay: Rotting flesh] Alice teleported directly to Cain’s location and used her magic on the basilisk! She aimed to take off the sharp scales from its head, to make it easier for the predator lurking around. Alice was sadly petrified instantly after hitting the basilisk with her magic.

[Cursed Decay] worked like the exact opposite of healing magic, Instead of fixing the flesh of living being, it cause it to rot and wither away!

With blood, the sharp spike’s on the monster’s head started to fall off as the flesh rotted underneath them. SCREECH! It screamed in pain as it’s skin peeled off.

“GAW!” Selena jumped from the tall grass, her maw was wide open, taking a big bite of the monster’s skull, quickly ending it’s life!

Selena didn’t stop there, crunching down she took the monster brain off and spitted it on the ground, the reason was that she didn’t see Cain and Alice get released from the petrifaction instantly!

After just a second or two, the petrifaction on Cain and Alice broke. They both started coughing, trying to breathe.

“Are you okay-nya?” Selena lunged at them, drenching them in the basilisk blood that was on her face.

“Selena, are they safe?” Sofia also came running down the hill to check on them.

Luckily the surprise fight didn’t end with them being heavily injured, Only Cain had a broken leg from the basilisk tail swing earlier. The wound was quickly healed by Alice’s [Holy healing].

After taking short rest admiring the big monster corpse in front of them.

“Since there was two, they must have eggs somewhere, let’s look for them!” Cain said standing up. The eggs might sell well in the market as some people claimed to be able to tame basilisks, Cain knew better that it was almost an impossible task with how dumb the monster is. Dogs have an intelligence of three and that is the low end of tamable to be useful!

“What should we do with the corpses? Leave them here like we did with the toads?” Sofia asked, pooking the basilisk with her staff.

“The toads were big and smelled bad, there wasn’t a lot of monsters that will go after their corpses! We also had a lot so it didn’t matter if some got damaged. For the basilisk it’s a different matter though, we only have two corpses and I want the eyes to stay intact. We have to hide them!”

“In that case, I can help-nya!” Selena said with an exited look, she was already looking out inspecting the trees around.

“How about trees? Not a lot of monster can climb them-nya!” Selena said, searching for a tree big enough to carry the heavy male basilisk.

Cain already understood what she wanted to do but was a bit uncertain about it. They were extremely heavy. The female weight should be around 300 kg while the male is on the 500 kg! there was no way they can get them on top of a tree!

“How are we going to carry them? They look as big as a cow!” Sofia asked, wondering about what Selena wanted to do.

“This a good one-nya!” Selena seem to have found her tree, a one that was tall and had a big trunk with thick branches.

Selena than started taking off her armor, stripping back to the plain cloth she wore under the armor. She was taking any extra weight from herself to make the work easier.

“Do you need help?” Cain asked, wondering if he could do something to help.

“That power up magic, can you use it on me again-nya?” Cain quickly understood which magic she meant. Putting his hand on her back [Lesser Empowerment].

“How do you feel?” Cain asked just in case, she was going to do a demanding work after all.

“Let me heal you just in case as well!” Alice said as she used [Holy healing] on Selena.

“Better-nya!” she quickly grabbed the male basilisk, doing the hard job first when she was in her top condition. A bite to the neck was all she needed to drag the large corpse to the tree!

Selena started looking up and down, once at the tree and once at the corpse as if she was calculating something.

“Yosh-nya!” Selena bit the corpse on the neck, extending her claws as long as they get, and started climbing!

Using her claws to grab onto the tree and her powerful jaw to drag the basilisk, she dragged it up slowly.

It was just as watching a wild monster hiding it’s prey, most of the time she looks like a beautiful and innocent cat girl, but seeing her dragging the 500 kg basilisk up a tree. She looked like the real wild beast!

“It’s bending!!!” Sofia screamed as she saw the tree trunk bend slightly from the added weight.

“Don’t worry, it can hold, probably!” Cain said, being uncertain himself!

Alice on the other hand was looking with sparkling eyes, just admiring Selena’s raw strength.

After laying the big monster on the top, Selena jumped down, drenched in sweat. She laid on the ground panting heavily. Seeing her, Cain and Alice rushed to cast healing magic on her. [Lesser healing], [Holy healing]

“I just need a quick rest-nya! I haven’t done this in a long time-nya!” She said, resting her head on Cain’s lap.

Cain ruffled her hair as she took a few minutes rest.

As soon as she got her strength back, Selena proceeded to carry the female basilisk. It was considerably smaller so it won’t be that much of a problem.

Selena found a suitable tree almost immediately, and repeated the same process. Taking it up the tree.

Selena quickly jumped down, after she completed her work, stretching her body.

“I didn’t expect that having high strength will allow you to do something like this!” Sofia asked, she expected Selena to be strong but not like this!

“It isn’t just her strength, her whole body structure is different! Even with 20 strength that is an impossible feat without powerful jaw and claws.” Cain said, patting Selena on the head.

After taking a short rest with Selena, they started looking for the eggs! Cain wanted them just as much as the basilisk’s eyes!
