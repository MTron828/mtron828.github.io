“Come at me-coo.” Said the Kenku, “You two have the strength but lack the experience to use it-coo!”

[Demon Blade] [Skill Empowerment] Thud! Kayden took a deep breath and made a heavy stomp. Veins emerged on his skin as demonic flames covered his blade. “Say that again!” He growled. Kayden’s six eyes looked as if they could burst at any moment from rage. Nothing fuelled his wraith more than a chicken underestimating him.

“Increasing your physical prowess or covering your blade with demonic energy won’t do you any good if you can’t hit me. You should have grown more brains than eyes-coo!” For some reason, it did not feel insulting. The Kenku was honest. He really thought that Kayden could grow more brains since he was a demon.

Thud! Kayden didn’t bother with replying and rushed right in. [Triple Slash]

The Kenku took a step to the side and deflected Kayden’s blade. Even the spectral blades have missed their targets.

“See…Coocaa?!” Just as the Kenku was about to talk, He saw a second blade coming down at him from the other side. He ducked down at the last moment but still had some of his feathers cut off. Demonic flames then consumed all the damaged feathers.

[Eldritch Blade] Kayden had conjured a second blade made from condensed demonic flames. Now that he was wielding two swords, each blade delivered three slashes at the same time. It wasn’t triple-slash anymore, it was [Sextuple Slash]

The Kenku was taken aback by Kayden’s sudden change, in the blink of an eye, he was dishing double the attacks.

[Sextuple Slash] [Sextuple Slash] [Sextuple Slash] Kayden started chaining them one after the other. With each attack, his speed increased, [Blade flow] is preserving his momentum and accelerating his slashes.

Selena watched them clash, even though she had the same strength as Kayden, to her now he seemed faster. She didn’t know how he did it, but she presumed that the veins on his body were a spell that increased his speed.

Selena was right, Kayden used skill empowerment to increase his strength from 20 to 22 temporarily.

After a few moments of exchanging blows, Kayden managed to kick the Kenku away. That kick only connected since the Kenku preferred to take it instead of a slash.

“Just like the rumors-coo, you demons are something else-coo!” The Kenku yelled in excitement as he did a backflip. ROAR! He heard something below him before he could land.

Selena had already transformed into her Jaguar form to strengthen her senses. She was jumping to catch the flying bird.

The Kenku panicked for a moment, he had forgotten she was there. Kayden was too much of a distraction than he didn’t manage to sense her approach.

The Kenku used Selena’s head as leverage and tried to dodger her attack. ROAR! She didn’t allow him that and twisted her body. The same trick won’t work twice. She smacked him with her tail.

CRACK! The Kenku landed on his feet, “Tch!” The attack was heavier than he expected from a mere tail.

ROAR! Selena rushed at him swinging her paws and trying to go in for a bite. The Kenku was used to fighting humanoids so it was hard for him to predict her attack pattern.

Thud! Kayden rushed in as fast as he could. He knew the Kenku wasn’t someone to be taken lightly, Selena alone won’t be able to handle him.

“Finally attacking together, you seem to have more intelligence than I thought-coo!” Said the Kenku as he clocked one of Kayden’s blades with his hand and dodged Selena’s paw strike.

COOCAAA! He swung his hand at Kayden with terrifying speed. He was aiming directly at the throat. Clang! It clashed with Kayden’s blade.

Seeing his attack fail, The Kenku followed with another one at Kayden while swinging a kick at Selena.

Kayden could not understand how a single man was holding his own against him and Selena combined. Just how strong is this half chicken?

Each Time Kayden swung one of his blades. He got countered immediately. The Kenku was even keeping Selena at bay. Just how deep his stamina was, Kayden was worrying they might get exhausted first.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

One of the Fenrir villagers was watching the fight. In his eyes, the three of them were moving at a blinding speed. Kayden’s blade flashed each time it crossed with the Kenku. Selena looked like a raging monster roaring all the time.

“You seem to be having fun. Cain asked me to help you.” A familiar voice called them. Her sheer presence stopped the fight.

“Sh*t! I guess I wasn’t able to finish this before you come.” Kayden looked at her with a scornful gaze. He hated to admit it but he felt a bit of relief hearing her voice at that moment.

“What are you-coo!” The Kenku looked at her. He was feeling that something was off about her. She had this dangerous aura as if she was a monster.

“Where is Cain-nya?” Selena asked.

“We managed to put out the flames so he went to check the dimensional rift created by the beast god. I will be taking care of this so you can rest.” She jumped down and walked toward the Kenku.

“Cain told me not to kill you. There’s more to him, he said. Let me see what he meant.” Zaleria smiled, nothing intrigued her more than something that Cain said. She knew that Cain had an unknown arcane knowledge, hearing him say something like that only meant it was going to get interesting.

“Not to kill me-coo? That’s an insult, you think someone like you has what it takes to say such a thing-coo?” The Kenku asked with a faint annoyance.

“Yes, I think that, deal with it.” Zaleria just stood in front of him. She was taunting him to attack.

The Kenku knew what she was thinking. Even though he knew, he could not ignore her taunt. Judging by her body, she should be around 16 to 17 strength. She did not look that strong.

Thud! The Kenku went in for a straight punch, the moment his fist connected with Zaleria’s abdomen, his feather seemed to pale. He could feel the density of what he just hit. Her body felt like a solid rock.

“Was this all that you have? I say a mere 23 strength.” Zaleria swung her palm down at him. No techniques, and no tricks. The sheer speed of her attack made it almost inevitable.

The Kenku barely managed to escape. If he was a bit late, She would have torn his beak.

“My turn!” Zaleria said as she rushed after him.

“He can’t dare to block her attacks. He knew that if she as much as scratched him, he would die.” Kayden said as he sheathed his sword. Selena also morphed back to her normal form. Now that Zaleria was here, their victory was guaranteed.

Zaleria intentionally reduced her strength and speed to match the Kenku. Cain has asked not to kill him after all.

“You slowed down-coo. Are you getting tired so quickly-coo?” The Kenku said. He noticed the sudden drop in her speed and strength immediately.

“I was just trying not to kill you. Look in my eyes and you will know.” Zaleria said with a passive face as she casually caught the Kenku’s hand.

“Look in your eyes-coo? What are…” The moment he stared into her eyes. He could see it, The massive monster standing before him. As if it was an illusion, he could see her draconic form before him.
