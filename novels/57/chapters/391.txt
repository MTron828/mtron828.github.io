Cain woke up in the morning stretching his arms, looking down he could see both Sofia and Gracie curled up and asleep. “Wake up.” Cain poked them.

Sofia groaned and curled into a ball “Just a bit more…”

Gracie on the other hand slowly sat up, her eyes slowly blinking as looked at Cain. “Good morning.”

After taking a quick shower, they walked out of the magnificent mansion into Cain’s room. As they were used to, it was still just a bit after dawn.

Walking in the castle, only the maids seem to have been waking up, no breakfast was ready yet. “They are kind of lazy here, aren’t they?” Cain said with a disappointed face.

“This is the royal castle after all. They don’t have the need to be an early bird.” Sofia said with a smile.

As they were heading toward the kitchen, they met the rest also heading there. “Looking for something to eat-nya?” Selena asked with a cheerful face.

“Good morning, I hope you have a pleasant night.” Alice greeted them with Hati.

Mary then approached Cain with a smile, “Good morning, I did look for a new sword for you and I found something interesting with the guild’s resources. Care to check it later?”

“A new sword? Can it best my gorgon iron sword?” Cain looked excited, he hasn’t been using his sword since it could no longer handle the monster he was fighting.

“It’s just the blade though, we have to get the handle done as well,” Mary replied.

After having a quick breakfast in the kitchen, Cain found Zaleria and asked her to teach Sofia some magic while he is out for the day. She agreed as he told her he was going to look for some necessary items to create her tattoos.

Walking down the street with only Mary with him felt a bit strange, he usually feels relaxed but now he was feeling nervous. As if he was missing something, his guts kept giving him a weird feeling of security that he wasn’t used to.

“This is our first stop, He should be able to get us a nice hilt,” Mary said as she walked into an old-looking shop.

“Excuse me, is Alphonse here?” Mary called as she entered with Cain. Her eyes suddenly grew a bit worried as the shop seemed a bit weird in her eyes.

A woman that seemed in her forties, wore only trousers and a tank top, rushed from the forge in a hurry. “Customers this early, did you hit your heads in yesterday’s events?” The woman looked at them.

“We’re looking for Alphonse to make a special order, he should be awake.” Mary looked around inspecting the place.

“Alphonse? My grandfather died over thirty years ago when I was still a kid. Even his son, my father died two years ago. I own the shop now, my name is Daria.” Daria gave Mary a weird look, even though she almost forget her grandfather’s name, to think a stranger would come looking for him.

“I see, sorry for reminding you. It seems that the information we got from the guild is outdated.” Mary said with a calm face.

“That’s over thirty years old, how could they have never updated it?” Daria looked surprised, to think the capital’s guild could do such a mistake.

“Yeah they need a whole reform, the higher-ups are working on it so it will get better. Hopefully.” Cain said. He didn’t know the guild was this deep into failure. Was this really just the aboleth trying to weaken them or there is something else?

“Care to show me samples of your work then? I would like to see what you can make before giving you our order.” Mary said with a serious face.

“Feel free to look around, everything here is my work,” Daria said with a big smile as she went back into the forge.

With the sound of the hammer hitting steel in the background, Mary inspected the weapons with Cain.

‘The weapon’s quality is noticeably lower, they lack Alphonse’s touch. The fibers of steel aren’t as straight or twisted. She lacks either the arm strength or patience of Alphonse.’ Mary thought. Luckily they only wanted the hilt which she seemed to be getting comparable results to her grandfather.

After about an hour, “All of those weapons are of high quality, I bet Dolrig would be impressed.” Cain said with a satisfied smile.

“Yep, let’s have her make us the hilt,” Mary said.

“By the way, you never showed me the blade, is it that big thing you’ve been carrying?” Cain pointed at the bag in Mary’s hand.

Mary pulled the blade and handed it to Cain to see it. He grabbed it and gave a strange look. Focusing harder than usual, this blade seemed weird yet amazing at the same time.

“It’s strangely light and overly straight…” The Blade looked out of place, unlike all other blades that had small indications of being made, this had no bents, no strange marks, and twists. Even the part that is supposed to be hidden inside the hilt was polished, no blacksmith will waste time doing that.

Cain got a bit suspicious he walked to a nearby anvil and brought a hammer. BANG! BANG! He hammered the blade trying to break it but failed, on top of that, not a single dent was made.

“Where did you get this thing?” Cain asked, this clearly an abnormal blade.

“The guild, Calling myself your wife, and with what happened with your father. They happily handed me this blade.” Mary smiled.

“This might be a good fined, let’s test it out after the hilt is made.” Cain smiled this would be a clear improvement over his gorgon sword.

They Called Daria and asked her to make the hilt, with a single glance at the blade she knew it was a masterpiece like none she has ever seen before.

“I will make the best hilt I can, for that can I get your hand’s measurements?” Daria grabbed a bit of clay, gave it a cylindrical shape, and asked Cain to grip it.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“With this, I can create the most comfortable blade for you. Please return tomorrow and it will be ready.” Daria smiled, she was excited to work on such a thing.

“Also before we forget, do you make leather armor?” Mary asked.

“Yeah, but my quality isn’t the best. You’re probably better looking at a specialized tailor for that.” Daria brought a Map and showed them the location of the best tailor she knew and even wrote them a recommendation letter.

“Thank you, see you tomorrow!” Mary said as they were leaving.

Daria waved to them as she went back to the forge to work.

“Where are you going?” Mary asked as she saw Cain take a few strange detours.

“Going into an alchemist, need some oils and herbs. I have to start making the tattoos after all.” Cain replied and Mary smiled, she didn’t mind spending more time with him.

Cheerfully, she grabbed his arm and pressed herself onto him. “It’s a date, let’s walk slowly.” She said with a smile.

“Why not?” Cain replied as he slowed down, spending some time like this wasn’t a bad idea.
