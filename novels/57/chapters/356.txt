Cain intended to leave for the capital right after the feast was done. That was the plan Alice was working with when preparing for the wedding.

“This was a chore,” Said Sebas with a smile, “Now all we need is an heir, should I start preparing his room now?” Sebas asked.

“Stop joking, having a kid while we’re adventuring is just asking for problems,” Cain said as he was carrying multiple tables with [Telekinesis]

“Don’t worry about that part, I here shall make they grew to be responsible.” Sebas gripped his cane tightly, “As my grandfather, and father did to the Furberg family before.” He adds.

“I won’t mind you hitting my children, it’s a cruel world where going out for a walk might end up with you being kidnapped or eaten by a monster.” Cain said staring at the fading sun, “The girls have a different opinion though, they say to raise them carefully and safely.” Cain said with a worried face.

“Isn’t that also a good thing?” Sebas asked. He will be sad if he didn’t get to keep the tradition and use his cane but if it was in the children’s best interest he can do it.

“Children who never seen peace and children who never saw war have different values. There is a tight balance between protecting, over protecting, not raising them well, and abusing them.” Cain said with a serious face.

“Then how much do you rate your father?” Sebas asked.

“I rate him, a [Why you should never have a kid while traveling] out of ten.” Cain knew how much he suffered from the lack of his parents in his past life. But he was also aware that he would have never achieved his strength if he was raised normally.

For that Cain reached a final conclusion, everything needs to have balance, and his children must be cared for but as well shown the truth of the world..

After they finished cleaning, Cain went inside to have a short rest. He then found the girls resting as well, the women’s gusts must have exhausted them.

“How was it?” He asked them.

“They talk a lot. Like they never shut up!” Sofia screamed. From the first one to the last, each noble woman tried to strike up a conversation with the girls and they talked a lot.

“Why would we care about painting or whoever bought silk?” Alice sighed. She found each conversation long and boring.

“How did you fare then?” Cain asked Selena.

“I just told them that I don’t care-nya!” Selena said proudly. “And punched whoever said an extra word-nya, people who don’t understand with words can understand with force-nya!”

“She once said, [I don’t care, let me go] But when the noblewoman ignored her and kept talking, Selena just punched her in the guts,” Alice said with an exhausted face. People were stupid and they didn’t understand that poking a jaguar in the tail is a bad idea.

“And you?” Cain looked at Gracie.

“I just ignored them and went on with what I was doing, like I always do with Sebas,” Gracie replied as she tried to replicate Selena’s proud face.

‘I did hear something more important but let’s ignore that for now.’

“And you? I hope it wasn’t such a hard day.” If his wives who had a lot of stamina were exhausted, Marina was bound to be half dead.

“To be honest, I did have a lot of fun talking to them. It’s a great way to know what is happening in the city.” Marina smiled.

“Did you learn anything interesting?” Cain asked without a reason, he expected to hear something along the lines of [a lot of things]

“Darrigo a merchant that lives to the west of the city is sick and old, he might die soon. His five sons aren’t known for loving each other so they might fight over his property and end up selling it and splitting the profit. We might need to save some money so we can buy it cheap from them in the next year or two.

A lot of nobles are slowly losing interest in silk and are looking into demon spiders’ silk. We might need to stock up on that as well.

…”

Marina then went to list a ton of things that she heard, most of them are ways to make money or get leverage over some nobles.

Cain felt what the girls meant when they said nobles talk a lot, but he could appreciate what Marina found, they were opportunities.

That wasn’t a thing he expected from a woman whose stats looked like this.

She was a bit smarter than the average with a bit of wisdom and charisma but nothing out of the ordinary.

Those skills might have something to do with the way she was raised. That attention to detail and the ability to look at boring talks from another angle were priceless.

“Consult with Sebas to get a better understanding of the inner working of the city,” Cain suggested.

“And for those, businesses?” Marina rubbed her fingers.

“You can have access to the money you need, let us see what you can achieve. But tell me about how much you spent immediately.” Cain said with a serious face.

“So you can know how much money is available and don’t end up stuck in debt,” Marina said and Cain looked at her.

“Color me surprised, I didn’t know I married a gnome.” Cain smiled.

“Have you heard of the story of the seven gnomes and the dwarf king?” Marina said with a big smile.

“[A smart gnome knows what his neighbor’s wife likes so he can show it when she is with her husband. That way she will force him to buy it] that was my favorite part.” Cain smiled.

“And he then went on to wear red underwear and show them to his neighbor’s wife while she was with her husband. Glittergold never expected the gnome to be so stupid.” Marina finished the part, they both have read the same story.

“Selena, can you punch the two of them?” Alice said with an exhausted face.

“I understand-nya!”

But sadly both Cain and Marina went silent when they saw the jaguar approaches them.

Cain cleared his throat, “You had a full night together. Did you decide on a plan?” Cain looked at them.

“Weren’t you having fun with the maids?” Alice smiled. “Yeah, were they better than us?” he could see a small stream of fire coming from Sofia’s nose.

“They lacked stamina, which is their biggest determent,” Cain said immediately.

Both Alice and Sofia seemed to calm down, they felt a bit happy that he didn’t have as much fun as they expected.

“So does that mean I won’t be enough alone?” Marina stared at him.

“To be honest, it’s only a matter of how much you can last.” Cain looked at her, she didn’t look bad, and she was beautiful in fact.

“Isn’t that why Service maids exist? I do have two so we should be fine.” Marina replied service maids, are a way to call the maids who signed the exclusive contract to work in bed.

The reason for such a thing to ever exist is because, in nobility, most housemasters are strong individuals. Either knights, mages, warlords, generals, or kings. They most often than not have high stamina which leads them to be unsatisfied with a single wife or husband. The exclusive contract was a compromise between the nobles and the church.

“So, what about the order?” Cain asked again.

“Sofia, Selena, me, Gracie, and lastly Marina. Maids can join whenever needed.” Alice said with a smile looking at Marina.
