Chapter Ôªø491 When the Hell Gate's open

"What do you need of them?" The king asked with a worried face.

"I need Noel to lead the combined army of Furberg and Ourals, Sara will help my wife Marina in managing the resources we have," Cain explained with a straight face.

‚Äã "A full-on war?"

"Not quite right, our enemies' numbers won't be that high. It's just that the damage to the immediate area would be high. We're facing an immortal black dracolich necromancer who has been sucking power from hell."

"That's quite a long description."

"It wouldn't matter, I'm more of an experienced necromancer than she could ever hope to be." Cain smiled.

‚Ä¶ A day later, in a deserted land with no one in sight. Cain sat on a stone watching the Hell Gate he dragged all the way there. Fighting beside Furberg would prevent him from going all out.

If Mary was keeping him alive all those desperate fights they had before. Here he needs to eliminate all the hindrances and handicaps he might get.

'I still have 30 soul fragments, why the hell am holding into them?' Cain thought and immediately used them.

'A first-tier spell usually costs 4 MP

Second-tier spells usually cost 8 MP

Third-tier spells usually cost 16 MP

Fourth-tier spell usually costs 32 MP

Fifth-tier spell usually costs 64 MP

Sixth-tier spell usually costs 128 MP

Seventh-tier spell usually costs 256 MP

Eight-tier spell usually costs 512 MP

And lastly, ninth-tier spells usually cost 1024 MPFindd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

All of this is without counting enchanting to amplify or decrease the cost by modifying the spell by cutting corners.

This means that with my Active MP regeneration I can spam first-tier magic each second without running out of MP. That isn't enough to go all out against Morena who is actively double immortal.

"Cain, is it fine if we only fought?" A massive red dragon landed beside Cain. It was Sofia, carrying Alice and Selena on her back.

Selena was wearing an armless half-plate armor made of pure steel. Each of her hands carried a spiked knuckle duster that glowed with a faint arcane light.

Alice was wearing full-plate armor but without a helmet. Her two black wings spread behind her back and her leathery black tails swept around. Her body was surrounded by an aura of mixed curses and holy magic.

Alice leaped toward him, flapping her wings to slow her descent. "Sofia is right, we should use everyone's help."

"All we need is two blasters, a healer, and a de-buffer, and lastly someone to fight at the front. Having more will add to the number of people I need to be considerate about." Cain replied.

"Time is near-nya!" Selena leaped from Sofia's back as she heard a faint noise coming from the Hell Gate.

"Sofia, fly us as high as you can." Cain climbed her back as did everyone. As they took to the sky, a mound of empty MP bottles was hiding behind the rock Cain was sitting on.

CRACK! The Gate busted open an enraged woman flew at a blinding speed. BAM! In a burst of acid and necrotic magic, the massive skeletal dragon rushed toward Cain in the sky.

"Give my son back you damned monster!" She roared, her voice shaking the ground as she glared at Cain standing on Sofia's back.

A quick appraisal revealed the monster they were about to face, but she was still too high level for him to do a full appraisal quickly.

-------------------------------------------

The sky turned red, as a massive ball of flames fell from the sky at the raging dragon. [Meteor Fall]

Morena guarded with her hands a shield of acid, the meteor hit her head pushing her back to the ground.

BOOOM! As they landed, the red-hot meteor exploded tearing the ground apart in a ball of crimson flames and molten rock.

<HP: 6400/6400 => HP: 4088/6400>

Morena dug herself up from the rubble and leaped back to the sky.

"You think such a spell would take me down? Where is Gray? Give him back to me!" She was only focused on retrieving her son.

"Survived that? How about the second one?" Cain glared down at her with a passive face. From the dust-clouded sky, a second meteor appeared rushing toward her.

"You damned bastard!" Morena didn't bother blocking the meteor and instead launched a breath directly at Cain. A geyser of thick, black liquid acid mixed with necrotic energy escaped her throat.

Sofia immediately puffed her chest with white glowing flames, ROAR!

The two dragons' breaths clashed in the middle of the sky, Sofia's breath was the one to start getting pushed back, she can't compete with a Great wyrm.

Alice who was standing at Sofia's back created a golden holy blade in her hand, STAB! Only poking Sofia's back with the tip, "This should help you." She released a massive amount of holy magic into Sofia's body.

Sofia's white flames turned bright golden, burning through the necrotic essence of Morena's breath, they slowly equilibrated.

At that moment, the second meteor smacked Morena back to the ground in a massive explosion.

<HP: 4088/6400 => HP: 1776/6400>

CRACK! Morena crawled from the burning ground in her skeletal dragon form like a zombie crawling out. She glared up at Cain, "You bastard mage, just give me Gray back‚Ä¶"

"Here's the third one! I did have them already prepared." Cain said and the third meteor appeared, he wasn't playing around. He did come here to win, not to mess around.

"You piece of‚Ä¶" Morena growled as she got hit with the third meteor in a massive explosion.

<HP: 1776/6400 => HP: 0/6400>

"Cain is scary-nya," Selena looked down.

"Not as much as her, we can't pull punches against someone like her," Cain said as Sofia started flowing down.

As she landed and everyone got down, Sofia turned back to her human form.

Unlike before, she wasn't wearing her mage robe. On the other hand, she was barefoot wearing a sleeveless top and short pants, her hair was tied into a bun at the top of her head since she need to move a lot. Her arms and legs were covered in strange red markings inscribed by Cain to amplify her magic further.

CRACK!

<HP: 0/6400 => HP: 6400/6400> Morena rose from the ground naked in her humanoid form, glaring at Cain. "You can't kill me, my phylactery is hidden in the second layer of Hell with the lord of Dis, which was the price of his staff. I will just keep coming back and back until you die of exhaustion."

Knock! Cain knocked his staff on the ground, "Black witch Morena, if you think that will stop me from killing you, you're far too young."

"Look at you talking, do you realize how stupid you look pretending to be some great wizard while you still haven't passed thirty years old? Give my son back and I will just go to hell quietly, I'm sick of this useless fighting." She said approaching him.

"Your son? Couldn't care less as he is no more than an imperfect imitation of me, did you really think you can find power in my blood? But worry not, soon you will be with him." Cain pointed his staff at her, magic oozing from his eyes.

‚Ä¶Up in the sky, camouflaged with magic.

"What is this? Seeing him up close, he's a fucking hermit inside‚Ä¶" Lilia started laughing as she watched the battle unfold.
