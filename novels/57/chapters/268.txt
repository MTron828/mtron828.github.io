A fight broke between the investigators and the adventurers. The situation was looking bad. This was starting a war with the head guild.

“How many of them are here?” Edward’s mage screamed. She could count more fights than she had seen investigators in the first place. If they wanted to execute the Guildmaster, then bringing many people was obvious. But now it just seems excessive.

“Are we fighting each other?” One of the adventures yelled at the top of his lungs. He took a step ahead, kicked a tabled toward one of the investigators, and jumped on the guild desk.

He quickly sheathed his blade and drew a short bow from his back. Pew! Pew! He started shooting at the investigators that Chad and Alen were fighting.

“You lot are having fun without us?”

The fight stopped at her voice, all the adventures knew who she was by now. At the guild door, Zaleria was standing with the dragon fang and Reith.

“They seem to be fighting-coo!” Reith cracked his knuckles.

“This is more trouble than usual,” Daraku said as he pulled his sword.

“You seem to be taking a long time Chad,” Zaleria called Chad as he was not using much magic.

“I’m but a mere human, I have my limits,” Chad said with pride. He has run out of MP in the dragon fight and still hasn’t taken a good rest.

All the adventures backed down, none of them wanted to be close to the investigators now.

“Seven are remaining, do you need my help?” Zaleria asked.

“What are you waiting for? Kill them if you can!” Alen screamed.

Thud! Thud! Takeshi started walking toward the investigators so Zaleria stood to watch him.

“A-rank warrior, Takeshi if I recall correctly. You wield a weird sword but only rely on brute strength. This will easy…” Before he could finish talking, a knife stabbed his back.

“Shut up, will ya?” Daraku pushed his blade downward and left a gaping wound in the investigator’s back.

“Six left.” Takeshi declared. As he pulled his Nodashi.

“Four, we need two for interrogation.” Yamauba smiled. Two investigators fell asleep under her spell.

“You damned adventures, do you know what the head guild will do?” One of the investigators screamed as he realized they were losing.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“REI!” Takeshi screamed as he leaped toward one of the investigators. The investigators lifted his sword up to block Takeshi’s slash. Takeshi was swinging with one hand.

Cling! Takeshi’s blade slashed right through the investigator’s blade and cut his neck.

“Coocaa!” Reith rushed at the other investigator with a straight punch. The investigator lifted his dagger to block the attack. Almost instantly changing his stance to a low one, Reith turned the straight punch into a reverse swipe kick.

The investigator felt his legs shattered at the sheer force of Reith’s kick. As the investigator’s body was falling, Reith spun in place and delivered a second kick to the chest. The investigator’s body flew to the ceiling.

“At least I will take you with me!” One of the investigators pulled his duel swords and rushed at Miko. She was clearly a none fighting type, the investigator took her as a target.

“Motherclucker-coo!” The investigators stopped as he heard the menacing voice. When he looked around. Chicken people like Reith surrounded the entire place. They all stared at him menacingly and started clucking.

“That woman healed our wounded and saved our lives. Don’t think for a moment that a motherclucker like you get away with hurting her!”

The Kenku gang started beating the living hell out of that investigator. They were all skilled martial artists and their talons and beaks were deadly weapons.

“Shit, I have to report this.” The remaining investigator took a wooden stick from his pocket and snapped it in half between his fingers. His body flashed, as he was teleported away.

The investigator landed in the middle of the forest to the east, “Thank god I left this here.” He started rushing through the trees.

BAM! He heard the sound of something heavy crash in the distance. He stopped for a moment and started in the sound direction. “Probably just monsters fighting.”

He continued running for a few seconds before he saw a tree snap in front of him. A gigantic dragon stared him in the eyes with flames gushing from his nostrils.

“A mile away is still in my backyard, but I have to admit it was quite the exercise to chase you in such a short time.” Zaleria licked her teeth as she stared at him.

“Who are you?” The investigator screamed, this was the first time he saw a dragon talking.

“The woman who interrupted you at the guild, nice to meet you, dinner.” She bit his upper half off.

“You taste horrible, what were you eating in your life?” Zaleria scrapped her tongue on a tree before burning the remaining investigator’s corpse to ash.

Zaleria then leaped to the sky and flew back to Furberg at full speed. When she returned to the city, everyone was waiting for her at the guild.

“Where did you go? That was loud!” Alen rushed at her.

“I chased that one who teleported away, he thought that a mere mile was a long enough distance to be safe.” She cracked her neck as she started in the direction she just come from.

“One mile is a pretty long distance I say,” Yamauba said with an exhausted face.

“For you that is. However, for me, I can traverse such a distance in five seconds if I put my heart into flying.”

Alen giggled as he carried the unconscious Mary toward Miko to heal her. “That’s a dragon for you.”

Chad picked a table and laid on it to rest, he didn’t care that he was in the middle of the guild. He needed rest and he was going to sleep there.

Alen was about to suggest for him to sleep in the office on one of the couches but stooped when he saw the adventures swarm around him. Some women covered Chad with their cloaks and stared at him.

“By the way, that’s Cain’s father. So be careful.” Alen suddenly told them. Everyone turned toward Chad in shock.

Those two never looked alike, in fact, they looked opposite in every way.

…

Back in Cain’s mansion. Sofia woke up with a dreadful feeling, she rushed toward Selena’s room.

Inside the room, she found Cain enchased in a black cocoon with Alice sweating her life as she tried to keep her holy magic up with both of her hands inserted in the cocoon.

Hati was extending her arms up as blood dripped from her eyes and ears. “(Alice don’t you dare stop, keep the holy magic going, we will lose him if you stopped)”

“To think that his body rejected the shard, do you really think you can extract it.” Alice cried.

“What is happening?” Sofia screamed as she rushed toward Cain.

“Don’t touch him!” Gracie jumped from the shadow and stopped her, “You will get devoured if you did that.”

“Gracie, call the maids if Cain needs help!” Sofia screamed.

“We can’t, they will die with just being in the room.” Gracie looked at the corner. One of the unallocated girls’ was there.

“Amaya Bennett, she died the moment she entered the room. Selena is rushing to the guild to bring help.” Gracie explained.
