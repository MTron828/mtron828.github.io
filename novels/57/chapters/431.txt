Isbert continued tracking her target, she wasn’t aiming for the bandits but rather a monster that was reported to live around here.

Cain didn’t approach her as he has still not seen her go all out. Even when fighting those bandits she didn’t sweat, not a single drop. It was clear that has more power to spare.

‘Shall we go see her?’ The first brain thought. ‘No, if we did that, we can’t see how well she fights alone.’ The second brain added.

Isbert walked through the dark forest listening carefully to her surroundings. The monster was big but it didn’t mean she could find it easily.

After an hour of walking and slighting any small monster that came in her way, she finally found traces of her target. Massive claw marks on the ground.

She spent over and examined the traces, “The reports were right, it’s big so it means it’s a male.” She mumbled.

She stood and continued her tracking.

After she moved away a bit, Cain flew down to inspect the claw marks himself.

‘An adult male hydra, is she tracking it for a quest or just Exp?’ Cain thought. ‘Just how much power did she get?’ Cain’s second brain though.

After an hour, Cain finally spotted the hydra in the distance. It was walking around a pond in the middle of the forest and Isbert was heading straight toward it.

…

Crunch! Crunch! Isbert heard the branches snap as she walked across the forest. The birds were flying away from the direction she was heading implying a powerful monster was there.

She looked around carefully.

The trees were close together so the sun barely made it to the moist ground. The place smelled like fish and rotten eggs which were disgusting but a clear indication a hydra is living around.

Focusing, she could sense a clear shift in the Mana around her. That was strange, she never heard that a hydra could use magic so she became alert.

After a while, she spotted the monster feeding on a dead deer by the pond side. Each one of its five heads was taking a bite of the small poor animal.

‘You could gulp it down in one go, enjoying your meal?’ Isbert thought and hid behind a bush.

Pointing her hand at the Hydra, Isbert aimed at one of the heads. At the guild, she heard that the safest way to kill a hydra is to chop its five heads.

BAM! [Icicle Lance] An ice lance flew toward the hydra at an immense speed.

Swoosh! The hydra dexterously twisted its neck dodging the attack.

GRRRRR! The other four heads glared toward Isbert’s location. Quickly spotting her.

The hydra roared rushing at Isbert and biting her with two heads.

CRACK! Isbert’s body shattered into chunks of ice.

Thud! “I’m here!” Isbert leaped from the bushes behind the hydra and slashed at her tail. CLANG! Her blade bounced off the hard scales.

“Freeze!” As Isbert extended her hand to freeze the hydra’s tail, she saw the monster open two of its mouths toward her.

CRACKLE! A fire breath washed over Isbert in an instant, making it seems like the fight was over.

Soon, the hydra realized that her flames were being deflected by an ice shield. “You big monster, I said freeze!” [Icicle Lance] Isbert yelled expending her blade over her shield.

An ice spear penetrated inside of one of the hydra’s mouths and froze that head.

Thwack! The hydra didn’t take kindly to that and smacked Isbert with her tail toward the pond.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Splash! Isbert fell into the deep muddy water. She tried to swim back out but was unable to due to her heavy armor. Even freezing the water seemed useless as she was already submerged.

“You can’t just rely on raw power, especially when you have so little.” Her body got lifted from the water and up to the sky.

As she coughed the water out of her lungs, she saw Cain staring at her. “Am I dead?”

“Yes, welcome to the real world.” [Lesser Healing] “I doubt it will help but this is all I can do for you.” Cain took her helmet off.

“What brought you here?” She asked.

“I was looking for a certain princess, what are YOU doing here hunting a Hydra alone?” He stared at her.

“Levelling up?” she replied.

“Let me show you how. Don’t ever do such a thing without informing me?” She could have died if he wasn’t around.

“I’m not your wife, don’t go ordering me around.” She growled.

“I guess you’re right,” Cain said turning around.

“I understand sorry,” Isbert sighed, her father was determined to get at least one of his daughters to marry Cain. She was on board and the whole reason behind her grinding here was to be able to fight with Cain.

“What did you say?” Cain turned toward her again.

“I said sorry, please forget what I just said. I will do as you say.” She replied.

Isbert thought that Cain only valued power, seeing as most all of his wives were extremely powerful. Even the weakest of them Mary had managed to drag him out of hell. But now, she remembered another thing.

In the military, being able to follow orders is just as important as being powerful. She must need to be both obedient and strong to have weight in his eyes.

“I will kill the hydra with cold magic, watch and learn.” Cain flew down and landed a decent distance away from the enraged hydra.

The hydra immediately spotted Cain and started rushing at him in rage.

[Ice Forest] It was the same spell Isbert used to kill the bandits but Cain focused the ice spike in front of the hydra.

The hydra being too big and heavy wasn’t able to stop in time and ended up impaling herself to death. BOOM! Its body exploded due to the burnable gas that was building in its stomach.

Cain slowly got the shocked Isbert down, “See, you used this spell before. To fight big monsters you need to use your brain as much as you can.” He said pointing at the bloody mess that was the hydra a few moments ago

“I…how?” Isbert gasped.

“What do you mean? You could have done this as well, you can’t just go around Powerleveling and expect to gain actual skills.” Cain looked at her.

“But…We fight monsters, level up, get stronger and get more powerful. Right?” Isbert looked at Cain with a confused face.

“Leveling up too fast will result in you skipping the learning process and as a result, it makes you weak in comparison to your level,” Cain explained. A level 10 person who leveled normally could beat a level 15 who power level and lacked the skill. The ability to effectively use your power was equally if not more important than the level itself.

“But I trained in sword fighting!” Isbert replied.

“Against humans, from a coach that didn’t was to hurt a princess. The power you’re received won’t be enough to fight powerful monsters.” Cain said scratching his head. This wasn’t why he came here.

“But…” Isbert didn’t finish as she saw Cain glare at her, “Sorry, why did you come looking for me?”

“Let’s get to the castle first,” Cain said.
