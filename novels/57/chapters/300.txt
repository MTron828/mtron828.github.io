As Cain rushed toward the gorgons, he felt a strange aura nearby. ‘What is he doing here? Well, it will be fun if he joined as well’ Cain thought.

“Cain this stench-nya!” Selena seemed to pick his smell. Someone like his couldn’t be mistaken.

“Is it that swordsman? Is he your friend?” Even Chad seemed to notice his presence.

Cain smiled, “You can say that, as long as he won’t cause a lot of troubles.” Cain said with a wry laugh.

For a moment Chad seemed concerned and then smiled, “I guess you don’t discriminate. You wouldn’t be marrying a devil if that wasn’t the case I guess.”

It was common knowledge that anything related to devils was inherently evil. Alice was an exception, a big exception at that.

Mortal humanoids are born neutral, their environment decides whether they grow to be good or evil. That isn’t the case for the two opposite powerhouses, the devils and angels.

As to be expected, Devils are born inherently evil while angels are born inherently good. But there was a caveat, a thing that most sages in the world can’t even comprehend. Angels aren’t good in the sense mortals know.

Angels are considered good by the standards of the god that created them. If the god of murders for example created an angel, that angel will be a killing psychopath.

Since devils are the polar opposite of angels, that meant they must have such a mechanism as well. Cain is expecting Alice to be such an example of a devil that will be considered good since the standards of the god she follows are considered somewhat good in the mortal standards.

In Cain’s mind, it’s something like this.

Mortal humanoids (50% good and 50% evil chance)

Angels (95% good and 5% evil)

Devils (95% evil and 5% good)

It was then that Cain spotted the gorgons. “Father you take on the big bull, we will take care of the other three females!” Cain yelled as he jumped [Thunder Step]

Cain’s body flashed toward one of the gorgons like a lightning bolt. The sky crackled with thunder as his sword stroke the monster.

Rumble! Cain managed to injure the female neck a bit. The monster barely bled from the wound. It was then that Cain realized why there were four gorgons together.

‘It’s the mating season.’ Unlike other living beings. Female gorgons get stronger and tougher when they are pregnant or in heat. There was a simple reason, their plated armor get stronger due to the change in their diet.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just like how bears stock on fat before hibernating, Gorgons stock on iron before getting pregnant. Their armor gets stronger, and they simply refuse to die easily. Males on the other hand get more aggressive since they have to fight for females.

‘This is going to be painful…’ Cain smiled.

Thud! Chad has already reached the male bull [Crusader’s Mantle]

~Be careful, they are more aggressive~ Cain warned his father through message since sending the thought directly to his head was faster than speaking.

Thud! Chad gripped the Bull from the horns and started trying to twist its neck. The bull started stomping around and tried to push Chad backward.

Surprisingly Chad was getting pushed backward even with his 28 strength.

[Mist step] Cain immediately teleported and touched his father’s back, ~brace yourself~ Cain warned him.

[Enchanting: Overweight] It was a derivative of Gravity magic such as [Gravity sinkhole] it simply made something heavier.

Chad wasn’t getting pushed away because he was weaker, but instead because he was lighter than the bull. Weight plays a large role in leverage and power contests.

The average weight of an adult male gorgon is around 4500 pounds or 2000 kg, that almost just as much as five basilisks. To be able to contest with such a creature in raw strength, Cain had to increase Chad’s weight by more than 15 times.

The moment the bull felt the push back, He exhaled all of its petrifying gas at Chad. In the blink of an eye, Cain couldn’t see his father from the intense green vapor.

“Is this all you got?” Cain heard his father yell. [Crusader’s Mantle] was a spell that allowed him to nullify most weak status effects. And to a surprise, the gorgon petrifying gas was effective yet considered weak compared to basilisks or medusa.

Their petrifying strength is ranked like this.

[Medusa’s Petrifying visage: A-rank] The petrifying effect is so potent that the severed head of a medusa can still petrify things. The petrifying is permanent even after the creature dies and can only be lifted with magic.

[Basilisk’s Petrifying Gaze: B-rank] The petrification can’t work after the creature dies but it persists if cast with a mage (Petrifying potions). Can be lifted with alchemy.

[Gorgon’s Petrifying Breath: C-rank] The petrification isn’t permanent as it only lasts for a year. The creature’s breath can petrify after death but then the effect will only last for a minute.

[Cockatrice’s petrifying peck: D-rank] Can be resisted with enough willpower or high stats.

Chad took a step ahead and tried to lift the beast up. Cain only saw the gorgon’s hooves in the air for a moment before he heard the loud slam.

[Thunder Step] Cain flashed away as he still had to make sure the other three females won’t interfere in his father’s fight. His goal, for now, was to finish the female he injured earlier.

Selena was lurking in the bushes in her black jaguar form and waiting for an opportunity to kill one of the females in a single bite. Her fangs can easily pierce the gorgon’s plated neck.

[Enchanting: Ringing blade] Cain didn’t care if the gorgon was pregnant or trying to be. With enough power, magic, and precision. He managed to slice the creature’s neck like butter.

As he looked to the side, He saw Selena rush ahead as one of the females freaked out to see one of them got beheaded. Selena leaped with a growl and bit the gorgon’s neck. The two of them wrestled for a few seconds as the beast struggled for its life. Causing a small dust cloud. That struggle quickly ended as the gorgon took her last breaths without even being able to petrify Selena.

Thud! Thud! The last female rushed toward Chad in rage. Cain was about to lunge at her but stopped when he sensed the man coming.

Thud! The demon incarnation stood between Chad and the charging gorgon. He opened his six eyes and stared ahead.

“I was just training here!” Kayden sighed as his body got covered with a demonic aura.

Grabbing his blade with his four arms ahead of him, he lifted the sword up. The blade immediately got extended from a mere 3 feet and 4 inches to more than 6 feet.

ROAR! The gorgon released his breath toward Kayden. But the demon was unfazed, he stood still and with a calm expression.

Kayden took a deep breath and swung his blade down with all his might [Demon blade: Cleave]

The first thing that Cain noticed was that even the green gas cloud got severed in half, quickly after the gorgon’s body slowed down and got sliced clean in half with that blow. It took less than the blink of an eye but the gorgon corpse fell to the ground.

Kayden’s blade didn’t even have a drop of blood on it.
