“Selena, do you have time to go clear some dungeons?” Cain asked as he saw Selena leap from a tree to catch a bird.

“Nya?” Thud! Selena landed in front of him with a loud bang, her body seems to have gotten heavier to accommodate her growing strength. Opening her claws, the golden canary was unscathed between her sharp claws.

Cain looked at her stats, she was getting out of hand quickly.

‘Her stats have jumped again, the bird surviving her grip is only thanks to her high Dexterity and control’ Cain thought as he looked at her stats, she was quickly becoming a fast, hard, heavy-hitting fighter.

“It’s a beautiful bird, want to keep it?” Cain asked, Selena, didn’t let her prey be alive that often.

“Can’t fill a bite, he needs to fatten up a bit-nya.” Selena left the bird to fly away in peace.

“I thought you were just playing around. Are you hungry?” If she wasn’t fed well in the castle. Cain might have a country to clean.

“No, I was just looking for a snack. That bird weighs in feathers and bones more than he does in flesh. Not a worthy prey-nya.” Selena said as her eyes quickly shifted toward a flying goose, that had more meat.

“Then want to come with me to clear dungeons? You will get a lot of monster meat.” Cain said with a smile, that was the perfect hunting ground for Selena.

“Yeah, you asked me before-nya. Of course, I’m coming-nya.” Selena smiled, her eyes pulsing with a golden glow. “But can we take Hati-nya?”

“Hati and Skoll? Why do we need to take those sisters as well?” Cain looked at her with a puzzled face.

“You’ve been ignoring her a lot-nya, at this rate, we might lose her-nya,” Selena said with a passive face.

‘They are two…I guess that doesn’t matter now’ Cain thought as Selena seems to still see Hati and Skoll as a single person.

“Fine, let’s go get them. Getting more help is always welcome.” Cain smiled, with this the work might get a bit easier.

“The more the merrier-nya!” Selena said with a big smile.

‘Why do I feel that we aren’t on the same page?’ Cain thought as he heard Selena.

Cain didn’t need to search for Hati and Skoll as he could feel them from the guards’ training ground.

Hati was swinging a sword while training, and even though the ground underneath her feet said she was training for a long time, not a single drop of sweat appeared on her. Her natural stamina regeneration should be higher than what she needs to constantly swing a sword.

“Hati, care to come with us clear some dungeons?” Cain called and she turned toward him with a smile, but quickly turned to a frown.

“You didn’t take me yesterday.” She glared at him.

“Can you swim? As far as I know, you Fenrirs hate water.” Cain looked at her with a puzzled face.

Hati went silent, it’s true that she can’t swim. How did he know…

“I can swim, fly and teleport, Alice can fly and teleport to me, Sofia can fly, Gracie can teleport to me, my father can swim, Ariel can fly, and even Selena is a great swimmer. That only leaves you and Mary who can’t swim, fly or teleport.” Cain looked at her, this wasn’t the reason he left her but he might as well give a valid excuse.

“I see…I understand.” Hati looked sad for a moment and then smiled, “So where are we going?”

“Clearing dungeons, I need the cores. For the exact location, we need to ask Mary. She should have already made us a map.”

After that, they all headed toward Mary who as Cain expected, had prepared a map filled with a decent number of dungeon locations. 53 dungeons to be exact.

“They are mostly C or D rank but they should do the trick right?” Mary said with a smile.

“I see a few A-rank, there is even an unconfirmed dungeon that has just been spotted. I will go inform Baltos so you two get ready in the meantime.” Cain said with a smile as he teleported away.

…

In the meeting room at the castle top, King Baltos was holding an important meeting with all the nobles of the capital to discuss what happened yesterday and how are they going to move forward.

The room was heavily guarded by the king’s royal guards and the nobles’ personal guards. Even a fly couldn’t get in without being seen.

“I’m telling you to stop messing with us! Who could believe such a story? Let’s say a person like that existed, you need to order him to be executed for the safety of the kingdom!” One of the nobles yelled as he banged the table with his fist.

“Even if he was somewhat strong, his wives are here, right? Take them as hostages and then send him to the rope, after that you’re free to kill them as well.” Another noble snorted.

“I see…” A strange voice, “There is a slight problem though, every single one of my wives is strong enough to turn the capital into rubble.” Cain was sitting on the king’s chair armrest while sipping from his cup of tea.

The nobles’ guards sprang into action pulling their weapons immediately. Cain just smiled at them, “Are you pointing your weapons at me or at Baltos?” He instantly used [Telekinesis] to snap their weapons and then point the blade at their necks.

Baltos started laughing, he was having trouble convincing those nobles but now they can see it for themselves.

“Hey, Cain, need something,” Baltos asked with a smile, even his royal guards were at ease since they knew Cain was with them.

Cain jumped from Baltos’s armrest and smiled, “Just came to tell you I was about to clear all the dungeons around the capital. You don’t mind right?”

“With the problems at the guild, I was intending to send the royal guard to deal with them later… Are you sure you want to do the work?” Baltos looked worried.

“You needn’t worry, I just came here to tell you and not to get permission.” Cain hinted that he was going to do it whether the king accepted or declined.

“Then please be careful, you’re doing us a great service. Isn’t that right men?” Baltos looked at the royal guards in the room, they all looked relieved that they won’t have to deal with dungeons.

Cain handed one of the soldiers a fist bump, “This doesn’t mean you have a vacation, keep Baltos safe.”

The soldier returned the fist bump and smiled, “We know, there are always people who seek his life after all.” The soldier smiled, stealing a glance at the nobles.

“Well then, see you later!” Cain smiled as he teleported away.
