“What was that-nya? I could barely breath-nya!” Selena screamed her hair and tail standing.

“Was that Chauntea?” Sofia asked. She couldn’t believe how such a strong magic wave emerged from nowhere.

“Similar to Amaterasu but warm, they don’t call her the earth mother in vain,” Alice said, she still thought that Amaterasu had a more impressive presence.

“I couldn’t use my shadows…” Gracie mumbled something that surprised Cain.

“Wait you tried to use them?” Cain didn’t feel anything coming from her, was he too occupied by Chauntea?

“I felt the holy magic increase around Amaya so I tried to teleport her away but by spell failed,” Gracie replied with a passive face.

Even Chad couldn’t help but make a surprised face, Cain feeling and countering the attack was expected, but for Gracie to feel it and have time to act.

“Just how skilled you are? None of us could notice with how thick the magic was.” Sofia gasped, even with her draconic senses she couldn’t make difference.

“I could know by feeling how my Shadow magic was being erased.”

“Divine magic emits light, shadows and darkness are the absence of light. Please don’t try such a thing again, she could have smitten you as well.” Cain sighed, he should have guessed that. With how grace was, she was keeping precise track of her magic, duties, and work all the time. She would notice such a thing especially if it’s going to hurt one of the maids..

“Don’t mess with me! I left the garden and fish pond unattended to!” Suddenly Ariel screamed in rage.

Cain froze in place, what is this idiot trying to say?

“No need to scream like that, see I can open the gate.” Chad walked to her and opened a summoning gate.

“Oh? Is that right? See you later then!” Ariel immediately stretched the small gate and leaped in. She then immediately popped from another gate on the opposite side. Her face sad and twisted, Cain could see her float in with her back bent and her wings drooping.

“I was tasked with keeping an eye on you, my house is being attended to by another angel in my absence.”

As Chauntea said, Ariel was nerfed in the real world by her summoner’s level. Aka since his father was only level 21 she was capped at that level as well. But in the divine realm of Chauntea, she could exist at her max potential at level 100. Time there must flow differently. What seemed like less than a second to Cain and the other was more than an hour to her.

“So are we married now-nya?” Selena asked, in her village, this was where it ends. Sometimes there is a feast but that was rare.

“We’re engaged now, the marriage is still ahead of us,” Cain replied with a smile.

“He is right, since everything went well we will have a public engagement ceremony afternoon, a party at night, and a feast at tomorrow’s lunch and dinner,” Alice explained what she was planning.

“We already sent all the invitations out beforehand, we knew that Chauntea must accept.” Sofia smiled. She was both excited and nervous.

“Who did you give the invitations to?” Cain asked. He was hoping she didn’t invite the whole city.

“My family, Selena’s family, the druids, the Kenkus, the dragon’s fang and some other adventures, the guildmaster and Mary as well since they are still here, Kayden had gotten one as well, Dolrig, Evan, grandma Mabel is an honored guest. There is probably more that I’m forgetting.” Alice tried to list everyone she invited and quickly lost interest from everyone besides Cain.

“Did you give ones to the maids to invite their families and such?” Cain asked with a serious face.

“Of course, they are the first people to get their invitations.”

Cain stretched his hands, “Then let’s get back, we need to wear something decent for the public engagement.”

“W-wait a moment!” The priest rushed toward them sweating, he even tripped and broke his nose. With a single move, he ripped his necklace off and handed it to Amaya.

“Our lord and savor Chauntea ordered us directly to give you a holy symbol. Please accept this, it’s the finest we can offer!”

Cain could understand how the priest felt, their god has come in person and told them to give her a holy symbol. Even if the priest already felt that she was undead, the church is forced to accept her. As they aren’t following a moral code that is set in stone, but the words of Chauntea.

On their way, Alice who was confused about what she felt asked Cain about the gods and their powers, ranking, and what they are capable of.

Cain told her that such things didn’t matter as long as they are below level 100 but he can tell her anyway.

Gods are ranked into twenty ranks, and the 21st rank is a special case.

Rank 0, an immortal being with divine blood. They aren’t considered gods, they can’t grant spells or answer prayers yet they are powerful far beyond mortal reach. They are also called quasi-deities or heroic spirits.

Rank 1-5 Demigod.

Those entities are the weakest of the deities, they can offer spells to their clerics and have between a few hundred to a few thousand worshipers. But they aren’t omnipotent and can be avoided.

There isn’t many know example of them since they are less known. It’s safe to assume that most random cults could be worshipping one.

Rank 6-10 Lesser Deity

Stronger than demigods and having sharper senses, they can perform small miracles and pent reality to some extent. They can have from a few hundred to tens of thousands of worshippers.

In this rank, we can find Eilistraee at rank 7. The Dark maiden, lady of dance and songs. The dark elf queen who ascended to godhood after perfecting [Blade Dance]

At rank 10 we find Tiamat, the former chromatic dragon’s god who got killed by his/her subjects. The fife-headed dragons, Nemesis of the gods.

Rank 11-15 Intermediate Deity

They are far stronger than what lesser deities could hope to achieve. They have hundreds of thousands of devoted worshippers across the world.

In this rank we can find, Umberlee at rank 12. The unfair maiden of the sea, Queen of the depths. She had a stronger influence between sailors and pirates. Cain knew that they can’t cross the sea to the elvish kingdom without having to deal with her worshippers.

Rank 16-20 Greater deities

Those entities may have millions of mortal worshippers, and they command respect even among other deities. The most powerful of greater deities rule over other deities just as mortal sovereigns rule over commoners.

Here we can find the most powerful gods. Mystra, the mother of all magic. The lady of mysteries. She ranks 18.

Garl Gilltergold the god of gnomes also ranks at 18. The joker, the priceless gem. The watchful protector and the sparkling wit.

Moradin the soul forger, Dwarffather, All-father. Sits at rank 19. The god of dwarves and smiths.

ɴ[0)ᴠᴇʟ Corellon Larethian, the creator of elves also ranks 19, Coronal of Avandor.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Then we find Chauntea at the peak of rank 19, being worshipped by tens of millions and wielding unimaginable power. The great mother, the grain goddess, the earth-mother.

Taiia rank at 20 in a realm of her own. The watcher, the maker, the devourer, the dancer, the blinding light.

Rank 21

That entity is beyond the ken of mortals and cares nothing for worshippers, he does not grant spells not answer prayers and does not respond to queries. Only a handful of scholars and gods knew of his existence. His consent is required to become a god and stay as one.

He is Called AO as an abbreviation of his divine name, in the myth, it’s said the whole world was created and forged by him. He is to gods, what a god is to mortal babies.

Cain looked outside the window, “He is the only true god in this world, and he doesn’t care what happens to the world, he just watches.”

Cain’s words sounded so ominous that Alice felt a slight shift in the air, there is something that he isn’t telling them.
