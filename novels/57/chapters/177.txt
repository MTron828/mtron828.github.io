“I’m heading toward the pub with Alice, you stay here and wait. If any more bandits came then kill them.” Cain said as he looked toward the village center.

“Leave it to me-nya!” Selena replied energetically. “I want to come with you,” Sofia said with a sad face.

“We can’t do that, You have to stay close to Zaleria so she can keep your charisma in check and we can’t put our strongest units in one place.” He was saying that it’s better to split up into two groups, with him and Zaleria being in different groups since they were the strongest two.

Cain then headed with Alice toward the city pub, Its location was obvious as they could see it from Lexi’s house. Cain was hoping to get some prisoners to interrogate. Even though he could just send Zaleria to wipe them out, it was better to avoid killing any innocent people that they might have imprisoned.

The pub looked like a barn from the outside, it’s wooden walls were painted white while. A horse stable was built right beside it for travelers and villages to rest their horses. Cain opened the door and went inside followed by Alice.

The pub owner froze at their sight, his face turned pale and he was stealing glances at the man sitting at the desk. Cain immediately looked at the man back, there was a strange air around him that resembled someone he knew.

Cain immediately regretted apprising the man, this was a monster that shouldn’t walk on the with humans. It was the monstrosity that Jack was turning to when they fought him.

“That’s… a disgusting amount of Mana.” The man said with his deep cold voice, Slightly turning his head to gaze upon Cain with his Four black and red eyes. His long black hair dangled like a snake tale as they locked eyes. “And what is that monstrosity by your side? How could she stay in one piece?” He turned his gaze toward Alice.

‘Coming here was a mistake!’ Cain screamed internally. “Same to you, you remind of certain scumbag. You at least have grown ugly.” Cain replied while sending a faint pulse of Mana in hope that Zaleria would pick it up.

“Are you talking about Jack? I heard from the lady that you killed him before he could full transform into a demon.” Kayden replied as his eyes twisted from left to right, “The lady was truly disappointed by that failure!” He growled.

‘Wait, he knew Jack? And more he pin pointed him?’ Something was odd about this Demon. Those monster are usually the child of a human and a devil(For example, If can and Alice had a child. He have a 50% Of being a demon, 25% A human and 25% Chance to be a devil), but they could aloe be created with magical means like with Jack. Does he mean he was created like jack or Should he worries about the existence of a true devil close by.

“Meliliana Also told me about you, a monster in human skin she called you!” Kayden added.

Cain racked his brain for a second and remembered that Meliliana was the name of the Cubas they faced in the cave. “Is Meliliana the lady you’re talking about? I would say she was the monster in human flesh. What are you to her.” Cain replied as Kayden seemed chill enough to be talked with.

“Are you an idiot? The Lady I’m talking about is Morena, she is the one who granted me this power. I’m her Ourals experiment.” Kayden stood up and Cain took his stance, ‘This is bad, I might be able to hold him for about a minute max.’

“Are you looking for a fight?”

“I was here just to have a drink while the gang was hunting, I need to leave because she is coming. You better thank her for saving your life…” Kayden dispersed into mist and at that moment Zaleria burst through the door.

“What is this foul smell?” She growled, “How I didn’t pick it up until now?” Her face was both surprised and angry, an infernal wrath burned in her eyes.

“You’re late, he ran away.” Cain sighed and looked at the pub owner deathly face. He must have been terrorized by the constant existence of such a demon here.

Cain could only conclude one thing from what Kayden was saying. Morena tried to create a demon in both Furberg and Ourals. Furberg’s demon was Jack but Cain killed him before he could reach his full strength. Ourals demon was Kayden, which had enough time to mature to such a monster.

Unlike Jack, Kayden wasn’t alone. From what he said, Cain is expecting him to be accompanied by Meliliana the Cubas. Kayden looked like a Spellsword while Meliliana seemed like a brawler mage mixed with an illusionist, they compliment each other so fighting them together was a death sentence.

“I guess we have met the bandit’s leader, we shouldn’t split again!” Cain said as he as they rushed back toward Lexi’s house.
