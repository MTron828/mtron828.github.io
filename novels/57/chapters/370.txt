Cain and the king walked together down to the training ground. The king kept staring at Cain thinking he was a bit weird.

“You don’t seem to mind standing with the king, why is that?” Baltos asked.

Cain turned toward him with a puzzled face, “A king who lets civilians into his castle isn’t someone to care about formality, especially when his daughter’s life is on the line. You feel more at ease if I wasn’t sugarcoating every word I say to you, right.”

Baltos smiled, he would have thought Cain just answered his call for fear or greed had he been too polite. “You know Baltos, I was serious when I said you should pick a blade up. My father is here in the capital, and you two will get along well.”

“Your father? I would love to meet him. Ah, we’re there, look there she is.” The king said pointing toward a woman that was standing alone in the training hall.

As tall as Cain with a white hair tie adorning her black hair. Wearing a set of leather armor with a warbow on her back and a longsword in her hand, she was just like her sister Noel, dreaming to become a knight.

Looking closer, her skin was ragged, and her build was too slender. Each swing made her joints crack as the cold emitting from her reached Cain and the king.

“Constant emission of cold magic, she should have run out of MP a long time ago,” Cain said looking at her.

<Innate Magic>

[Absolute Peace]: Blood inherited from an ancient ancestor. This power isn’t native to the mortal world so it’s slowly driving it toward an absolute halt and peace. Has been activated in recent years due to a failed connection to the ancestor.

[Layers of Ice]: Absolute peace drives its power directly from the frigid wasteland of Cania. As long as the ice there stands, this power shall never fade.

[Arcane Blood]: Due to the constant exposure to ice magic from [Absolute Peace] The host’s blood have being turned inside out as the formed shards of ice tear their way in. As the blood cells have endured this and adapted, this has given the host immunity to cold magic and resistance to fire magic as well as the innate ability to shape ice.

“HA! HO!” She was swinging her blade tirelessly.

“Not again…” Cain sighed and turned toward Baltos. “You have a secret force of assassins, right? Ask them to keep an eye on the entire castle, the capital if possible, and report every strange thing to you or me.”

“Assassins? What are you talking about?” Baltos gave Cain a strange look.

“I know they are supposed to be a royal secret or whatever, but when they are this poor at hiding, it can’t be helped right?” Cain used telekinesis to pull a woman from under the sewer lid behind the wall.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Bringing her in front of the king, “See? I bet Zaleria could sense them all the way from our inn, just listen to me now.”

“Fine, what do you have in mind?” Baltos glared at Cain. Those assassins were the reason the castle was safe, they were protecting it from the shadows and making sure everything was going smoothly.

“This is just a theory but you might have a cursed item around the castle, or someone has tried to open a hell gate here. Get that thing sorted or just report to me when you find it and I will deal with the rest.” Absolute Zero was now residing in Cania, the eighth layer of hell. Only cursed items or a hell gate could allow a link to him to be attempted.

The king turned serious for a moment, “You heard him, it’s an order now so go!” the woman rushed out.

“Well now, if you excuse me, I will go play with your daughter a bit.” Cain cracked his knuckles and started walking toward Isbert who was training in the distance.

“Stranger, you’re getting too close. Keep away for your safety,” Isbert said, the area around her was freezing cold and she expect the guards to shoot anyone who approaches her, a princess.

“Said the woman who is resisting her own magic, let it loose!” Cain flew toward her at a terrifying speed.

Panicking, Isbert jumped away and fell on her face evading his strike. “What are you doing?” She yelled in anger.

“The less you use your magic and the more you resist it, the worse you become. You always thought your powers hurt others.” As Cain was speaking, his skin started cracking with flames. [Enchanting: Ember body] [Investiture of Flame] “I’m he to force you to use and tame them, come at me with all you can.”

“Do it Isbert, he should be able to withstand it!” The king shouted.

Hearing her father’s words, she was certain no one would complain if the man in front of her was hurt or died. “You asked for it,” Isbert growled.

Like someone who has been holding it for a long time, the cold magic started seeping from her body. The trees in the training ground froze sold and the king had to run away.

… At that moment, the kingdom’s court mage was in her library reading when she felt a surge of magic. She recognized the princess’s magic but the other one was unfamiliar.

“What is going on?” She said wearing her hat and leaping from the window with [Feather Fall]

As she was descending she saw two massive balls of magic, clashing in the training ground. One was the princess as she let her magic loose, this was against her advice as it may accelerate her symptoms. The other one was a young man who released enough fire magic to keep the princess in check. That feat alone meant he was almost at the court mage level and probably specialized in fire magic.

“You two stop!” She shouted, “Why did nobody stop that man?”

Cain heard her so he turned to the side, “Because they can’t!” A flick from his finger was enough to create a barrier around him and the princess.

“ARGAA!” The princess rushed at him with her sword, her swing was floppy as she never got proper training. Cain easily dodged her attack and touched her back. “Here’s a gift!” He blasted her with [Fireball] at point blank.

The princess rolled to the ground but quickly stood, she almost took no damage from that. “Oh, I guess I can use more firepower. Even if I’m not enough I can get help so keep coming at me!” Cain spread his arms.

The princess glared at him, no one had dared touch her in the past ten years. “You insolent…” As she tried to rush at him he blasted her again with [Fire burst] this time. He could finally see some damage to her skin and hair.

‘I see, it has a limited absorption speed. That’s troublesome as we might end up burning the princess to ash with Zaleria’s breath.’ Even with that thought, Cain smiled. He still needs to know her limits so he can find a suitable way to help her.

“Come at me!” Cain shouted as he engulfed the area around him with blazing flames.

It was them when the court mage noticed Cain’s precise control over his magic. No normal human could use magic like that.
