Cain quickly took a step back, “Don’t touch her directly, she is an Acid dragon!” His scream rang through the whole farm, Leyla picked her father and siblings to run away.

“You stopped Jack, rebound the girl, and broke my curse. How come a green sprout like you hold such ancient knowledge?

ROAAAAAAAAAAA! Selena leaped at her top speed, her fists clenched. Daraku appeared behind Morena with daggers coated in Base, he already did have a counter for acid. Alice’s aura engulfed the whole place as transformed back to her devil form, this wasn’t the time to care about staying hidden.

Blah! Two black wings sprouted from Morena’s back blocking Daraku’s dagger. Thwack! She caught Selena’s fist with her hand, slamming her to the ground. Cain did warn them but Selena wasn’t the type to listen, the bones in her hand were showing. Miko and Alice hurried to heal her as Cain and Takeshi jumped in to drag Morena away.

“Is she our dragon?” Takeshi screamed as he swung his half-melted Nodashi.

“She isn’t, she is the one who taught jack how to become that monster.” Cain knew the situation was bad. Morena was abnormally strong. Cain used a blade he conjured with [Elemental weapon], a thin and long sword with a blade almost 6 feet long. This was so he could keep a good distance between him and Morena.

[Fireburst] Yamauba launched her magic when only Cain and Takeshi were close to Morena. The spell exploded with a bright flash, and Cain immediately screamed.

“She teleported away!” With another glance, she was standing right behind Alice, “A new test subject!” she was euphoric at the sight of a rare devil.

Flash! A red flash flew right at them, for a moment Morena seemed shocked to the point of instinctively dodging Sofia’s kick. “Sis…Who are you?” She growled, “That magic, who taught it to you?”

Sofia didn’t care to listen and cast [Scorching rays] following it with a [Firelance]

Without even moving, Morena unleashed a wave of acid that easily overpowered Sofia’s flames. “It’s you isn’t it?” She wasn’t even looking at Sofia, her eyes only looked at Cain.

“Show me more!” Morena screamed as she flew toward Cain, with a slash of acid.

“There is no time to care about the forbidden!” Cain muttered as he stood still, his hand gently moving in the direction of Morena’s face grabbing her.

“What do you…?!” Just as she was about to comment on his actions she felt a cold terror drips inside her very soul, sucking the magic directly from her MP pool.

There were multiple ways to regenerate MP… Cain remembered his first night in Evan’s inn. It did come fast.

Morena quickly pulled back as she felt the necrotic, devilish, elvish, holy, cursed, and even her draconic magic curse through Cain’s body. Even for her who was a dragon seeing this abomination of magic made her smile without realizing it.

To a dragon, Cain was like a bug with more than one toxin. The necrotic magic belonged to Cain. The devilish magic he sucked from Spindle in his shadow. The elvish was the remnant of Sylph’s magic in the spirit stones. The holy and cursed were absorbed from Alice through the binding and her aura. In addition, the draconic was absorbed from Morena herself.

This was a forbidden technique as it might turn the user into an undead lich, Cain knew the risks but they were better than being killed or sent back to the dragons.

As Morena was sensing how much Damage Cain left on her soul, she felt a hot kick on her head. “You, it’s not just the witchcraft. You’re Mana itself smells like that of sister.” She caught Sofia’s ankle and smacked her on the ground before throwing her at Miko.

At that time, Cain had finished refueling his magic poll and Takeshi had his spare Nodashi coated with Yamauba’s barrier to protect it from acid.

[Enchanting] Reinforce the stats with necrotic magic (Using the lumps left from Alice’s curse as a base), force the Mana to circulate faster with the spirit stone, and use Alice’s link as a forced healing spell, use Spindle as a convertor to fuel Alice with MP.

Alice felt the pain tingling inside her as Cain’s body started to glow. “Is that your trump card? How wonderful!” Morena screamed as he body started to transform into her draconic form.

“GI!” Takeshi screamed swinging his Nodashi at Morena’s neck, CLANK! His sword managed to leave intent on her scales. He didn’t stop and kept swinging like a madman.

Daraku slightly moved behind and stabbed her tail with a cocktail of his poison. He took every bottle with a weird label in his bag and mixed them in a rusty bowl that was laying by the cow pen and then dipped his dagger inside.

[Fire burst], [Lightning strike] Yamauba hurled her magic at Morena’s back at the same time. Alice Launched a wave of her [Cursed Decay] in conjunction with the spell.

Sofia who just recovered enough to move extended her hand and launched a quick [Scorching rays] Selena had also joined delivering a claw strike to Morena’s wings.

[Mist step] Cain teleported right at Yamauba’s spells and enlarged them with enchanting, causing them to explode on contact. Morena tried to cut him with her claws but he disappeared again and touched her back. [Enchanting] Weakening the strength of her Scales, as they were considered dead tissue like how nails are to humans. [Enchanting] this also reinforces Daraku’s position to make It more effective.

Morena started to get angry as all dragons do, her wings flapped at incredible speed. One of the flaps Smacked Takeshi on the ground multiple times leaving him with multiple broken ribs. The ground shattered as the barn got blown away by the strong wind generated by Morena.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Daraku tried to pull Miko away and was impaled by the flying wooden fence in the process. Yamauba on the other hand was carried by the winds just to teleport back to Takeshi to grab him, Morena’s wing managed to tear one of her arms off.

Selena who was on Morena’s head was sent flying upward at high speed in the blink of an eye. Alice extended her wings and rode the current to evade any damage. Cain teleported to grab Sofia was crashing through the trees with broken arms and legs.

Cain didn’t have time to worry about Sofia, Morena was flying upward with her jaw open to bite Selena. It happened in the blink of an eye [Mist step] Cain teleported toward Alice and threw the unconscious Sofia at her, [Mist step] He teleported toward Selena and touched her [Mist step] teleporting her to the ground staying up himself.

Morena’s open jaw was directly under him, [Call lightning] Striking her in the throat but she seemed unfazed as she closed her jaw on him.

“CAIN!” Alice screamed as she was the only one looking up and seeing him be swallowed.

[Hellfire] The black flame erupted inside Morena’s mouth and was followed by a splash of acid. ZAP! Cain appeared out of thin air in front of Morena, his left arm was only bones as the acid melted his flesh.

That massive draconic body twisted mid-air swinging her scaly tail at Cain like a massive whip. [Thunder step] Cain teleported out of the attack and opened his remaining arm.

[Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt] Launching spells one after the other, Cain aimed to blind one of Morena’s eyes. He was certain they will lose and wanted to make it easy for them to run this was a losing battle.

[Enchanting: Delayed spell] Cain set it so if he lost consciousness or was about to die, Sylph would be forcefully summoned instantly. She might hate it but they have to live. Morena was only Level 21/40, she would still hold no candle to Sylph who was well above 90.

As her form of countering, Morena opened her jaw [Acid Breath] Cain instantly knew it was a full-power dragon breath. He didn’t teleport away as she would splash all that acid on his injured comrade down, he instead flew behind her to make her spew it in that direction.

It was like a never-ending river of green disgusting liquid, the smell was terrifyingly horrid that Cain would prefer to bath in the sewer than take a whiff of it! Just the vapor from the acid turned his vision red as his eyes got burned, he could hear Alice scream as she flew away with Sofia, her wings were melting.

Cain didn’t need to look behind him to know that half of the forest was melted as the animals’ growls of agony filled the air.

As the Acid vapor got into his lungs, Cain’s body started to shut off. Hardly able to breathe and in extreme pain. Cain got distracted enough to receive a direct smack sending him to the ground in an instant.

Just as he broke his legs on the hard ground, Morena had turned back to her human form and kicked him in the face sending him flying to a tree.

He couldn’t move anymore, Morena was saying something but he couldn’t hear her, his eardrums were probably busted. His body couldn’t more or circulate Mana, his enchantments were failing as he slowly lost the ability to feel pain alongside his fading heartbeats. All that was left from his to back out and Sylph would be summoned.
