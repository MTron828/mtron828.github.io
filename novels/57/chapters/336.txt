“Isn’t it a tad bit loose?” Said Cain stretching his arms in one of Sebas’s suits. It was mostly black with a white chemise, and a blue tie he salvaged from Chad’s treasures.

Sebas looked at Cain carefully and inspected the back of his suit. “I would say it’s not that obvious, I used to be more built than you in my youth.” He lightly tapped Cain’s shoulders.

“You used to be a soldier, I imagine you being quite skilled.” Cain smiled, he knew that Sebas was only level 8, compared to a b rank adventurer which was powerful by the normal standards.

“Not as much as you or the Ladies, I would say you have set a new standard.” Sebas looked out of the window toward the adventures guild. In front of its new doors, fresh adventures were swinging their blades and staffs.

“That’s some impressive eyesight.” Said Cain as he realized what Sebas was looking for. The guild was a bit far away.

“Thanks for the compliment, I used to be an archer after all.” Sebas smiled.

Knock! Knock! Both Sebas and Cain stared at the door, who it was?

“Open the door you great white mage, us mortals have come to pay you homage!” The voice was familiar, it was Daraku. Cain hasn’t met him in a while.

“It’s locked but you can get in right?” Said Cain.

CRACK! CLICK! The door opened and Daraku entered smiling. “Such a simple lock, of course, I can get in!”.

“I hope you didn’t break it, I wouldn’t like to go through the trouble of replacing it.” Sebas sighed.

“My lock picking skills are unmatched, damaging the look will only give me away. I always leave them in perfect condition!” Daraku smiled as he threw his lock picks into his pocket.

“Won’t they get in?” Cain looked at the door.

“Come in lads, do you think your second-rate hiding skills will work?” Daraku shouted.

Takeshi, Alaric, Kayden, Leon, and Even Edward were there. Cain gave them a wry smile. He didn’t sense Kayden and Alaric.

“Congratulation, this is a happy occasion!” Takeshi smiled as he stood tall. His voice never sounded as excited today, “But you have too many wives!” He added without breaking his smile.

“I have my hands full with one, you have a tough road ahead of you so stay strong,” Alaric said with a big smile. Cain imagined him in the hell hound form and wanted to pet him but refrained.

“Congratulation,” Kayden said without adding anything.

Leon lifted his hand and lightning started to crackle between his fingers, “Pray to god sister won’t ever come crying to us!” That was a clear threat, Leon still never changed.

“She won’t I promise,” Cain replied.

“So, what do I say?” Edward looked at Cain confused for a second. “Sorry about last time, and I hope you find happiness and tranquility. No matter how harsh life gets, remember that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.” Edward scratched his head.

Cain gently tabbed his chest with a fist, “Quarrels are the highlight of an adventurer’s life. You needn’t mind them. Thank you!”

“Master Cain, we need to head out as it’s almost time for the engagement,” Sebas whispered to Cain.

…

“Isn’t it a bit tight? You’re dislocating my organs!” Alice cried.

“A few twisted kidneys won’t hurt you,” Bela said as she tightened Alice’s corset.

“You did gain some weight since we first met, you look plumper!” Sofia laughed as she slid into her dress.

“I have better proportion than you!” Alice yelled back, she wasn’t going to sit on that and stay silent.

“You there have it nice and easy, look at my little kitten here!” Elena cried as she worriedly watched her daughter trying to move in her dress. CRIIT! The dress’s shoulders got ripped.

“Ah! It happened again-nya!” CRIIT! As Selena freaked out her under-chest got ripped as well.

“I never expected to say this about my daughter but she is harder than stones. There is nothing to tighten about her.” Elena said with a worried face, at this rate Selena will have to attend with her adventuring gears.

“I can help with that, leave it to me!” Mei who was relaxing at the desk approached them, “I can enlarge the dresses as much as you want!” The little pixie said with pride.

“Thank you-nya!” Selena glared at Mei scaring her.

“We’re done Headmaid!” Lexi said with a happy face.

Gracie who was only seen in maid uniform was wearing a white and purple dress, her hair tied up in a ball with long golden earrings.

Lexi jumped around Gracie with a happy face inspecting her, “A loose string! I will bring scissors right away!”

“No need,” Gracie said as she pulled a dagger from under her chest and sliced the string instantly.

Lexi fell on her back terrified at the sudden swing, “Headmaid, where was you hiding that?” She saw it come from her chest cavity.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“The shadows, I have more.” Gracie gently lifted her skirt and tens of knives and petrifying portions fell off. “I just restocked my arsenal from Olivia and Dolrig.” Shadows immediately consumed the weapons again.

Marina was shaking in the background, they told that they all surpassed level 20. ‘Isn’t level 20 the cap?’ She never felt as out of place as today, she was the only wife that was still at level 1.

ɴ[0)ᴠᴇʟ ‘I won’t be thrown for lacking strength, right?’ Marina got more anxious by the minute.

…

After having a chat with Cain, Kayden decided to go on a walk around the city since he had time. The city was lively as they celebrated the marriage of their city lord’s daughter to the hero.

“Excuse me, do you know where the Lisworth house is at?” A man with his wife and daughter were asking for direction after getting lost.

“Well, of course, we’re heading there now. You can follow us if you want!” A bunch of adventurer-looking guys replied to them.

“Thank god, we thought we were going to miss it.” The man smiled, the people of Furberg seemed nice.

They started following them in the hope to reach Cain’s house.

“Father, aren’t we going on the wrong path?” the little girls said as they were stranded away from the main street.

“We’re taking a short cut little girl, you got lost because going on the main road takes a long time.” The man replied.

After walking a bit, the little girls spotted a man with sharp eyes walking past the alleyway.

“Old man!” She rushed toward him with a happy face.

“Shit, she is running away!” One of the adventure-looking guys pulled his sword swinging at the little girl.

The man with sharp eyes turned toward them and instantly recognized the little girl. In his eyes, he saw a man swinging a wooden cane at a little puppy.

Thud! CRACK! The thug’s body flew past the little girl’s parents at crashed into the alley end.

Kayden Glared at the other thugs, his eyes quickly spinning as he hardly managed to keep his demonic aura in check. He knew that the girl’s parents aren’t going to take kindly to seeing his demonic form so he refrained from transforming.

“SCRAM!” He screamed as sent another one of them flying with a kick.

The thugs started running for their lives, “Well remember this!” One of them yelled just to have Kayden knock him out with a stone he picked up.

“You’re lucky I don’t intend to kill anyone today, Lily will get angry!” He remembered Lily growling at him for massacring some bandits the other day.
