295 ¬†Chad's Rage

Sofia woke up to severe pain in her abdomen. A pillar of ice as thick as her arm has penetrated her stomach.

"You're also a witch, where did you learn that messy witchcraft?" The girl landed by her side.

VROOOM! Sofia's body burst into flames, melting the pillar immediately. [Holy Healing] She used the magic stored in one of her rings to heal.

"Messy? Yeah, sadly I didn't have time to refine it." [Investiture of Flames] [Firelance] Flames engulfed Sofia's body and a fiery lance emerged in her hand.

Sofia spun the lance around and smacked the tip on the ground causing it to explode.

The girl protected her face with her arms as she was blasted backward. Looking back at Sofia, she saw her eyes glowing bright red as the snow around her started to melt.

"You‚Ä¶aren't human?" The witch gasped as she started to sense the weird presence Sofia had around her. [Icicle Barrage] The witch conjured multiple small blades of ice and rained them on Sofia.

Sofia flew directly toward the witch, ignoring the icicle since they melted as soon as they got close. VROOOM! A loud rumbling followed Sofia as she released more and more flames around her.

[Fire Breath] Sofia's neck and chest glowed bright red for a second. The witch went on high alert and used [Ice wall] to create a protective barrier.

ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! The draconic breath that emerged was terrifying, scorching everything that was in front of Sofia from trees to the ground. The witch's barrier half melted as it barely managed to deflect the breath enough to save her life.

"A dragon? Here?" The witch bulled a short knife and sliced a won't in her hand. Taking a step back, she splashed her blood on the ground. "Arise, snow golems!" [Snow Golem]

The snow on the ground, mixed with her red blood started to move and created five massive humanoid monsters.

Without any time wasted, the witch proceeded to cut a strand from her hair and pulled a pinch of her nail from her pocket. [Ice Formation]

Ice from in her hands engulfed what she was carrying. She then divided them into five small blades and sent them flying toward the golems. When the blades sunk deep into the golems' back, they caused a magical reaction.

The nails caused the golems to manifest large ice claws and the hair caused balls of ice magic to start homing around their heads.

This only took her a second or two, just enough for Sofia to regain her balance after such a massive breath.

When Sofia found herself surrounded, her instinct was to unleash another breath at the witch [Fire Breath]

ROOAARR! The fire breath melted two of the golems and almost killed the witch who barely dodged at the last moment. "Another one? How much Mana do you have, you monster?" The ice witch cried.

Sofia was using Cain's Mana, after all, he had more than even Zaleria.

Sofia flew directly at the witch holding an [Firelance] in her hand. BOOM!

‚Ä¶

CLANG! Chad deflected an ice spear that the mother witch sent at him. "Still moving, my spells can freeze a bear." The witch growled at him, his body should be frozen by now.

"I'm not a bear, I'm Chad!" Chad leaped at her with a quick sword slash. [Wrathful Smite] His blade glowed with golden light. Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

[Ice Pillar] A pointy ice spike emerged in front of Chad.

Thud! Chad leaped on top of the spike and sliced it in a single strike. CRACK! The spike shattered and Chad pointed a finger at the witch.

[Summon Steed] A spectral warhorse appeared behind the witch.

[Ice shield] She instinctively shielded herself when the horse tried to kick her face. The kick was so strong it sent her rolling in the snow.

Chad landed on top of his summoned steed, spreading his arms [Crusader's Mantle] a golden mantle appeared on his back. The spell's purpose was to negate status effects while it's active.

"A paladin I see, what is someone like you doing with a witch?" The witch growled, she could see from afar that Sofia was a witch like them. The crusaders' job is to hunt and burn them on a stick, isn't it?

Chad only stared at her for a moment [Dominate Person] She felt a severe headache staring at his face. "Trying to‚Ä¶" she stooped mid-sentence as she saw Chad rush at her with his blade glowing.

[Snow Burst] the snow underneath her exploded catapulting her to the sky.

[Cone of Cold] The witch pointed her hand down toward Chad and unleased a burst of Cold magic.

Stab! Chad appeared underneath her stabbing her stomach. 'He can jump this high‚Ä¶' The pain almost made her blackout.

Chad then grabbed her neck and flung her to the ground, the moment she landed on the ground, he landed with a kick at her chest.

Bluh! The witch coughed blood as her body started twitching, "Please‚Ä¶let‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶" She tried to plead but Chad stomped her face immediately.

"That's a shame." Chad her voice coming from far away. The corpse that was underneath him exploded in a burst of concentrated cold magic leaving his muscles half frozen.

When Chad looked in the distance, the witch was sitting on a tree branch tending to her nails. "Did you really think that you take an ice witch down without fire?" She turned to face him.

THUD! She suddenly felt something heavy hit the tree. CRACK! The tree trunk shattered and she started falling. She saw the horse Chad summoned standing underneath the tree.

"Such an annoying creature!" She growled, kicking the horse in the face as she was falling [Gigantic Ice Formation] from her kick, massive ice spikes impaled the horse causing it to disappear into the golden mist.

Thud! That was enough time for chad to reach her. "Die!" he swung his sword with all his might.

[Ice blade] The witch created an Ice sword and blocked Chad's strike and causing his sword to break.

"How the fuck can you keep moving in my cold?" The witch growled, even still had become brittle enough to shatter easily yet this hulking man still rushing at her like this.

"Can you feel my heart? It's still beating!" Chad swung a fist at her face CRACK! His fist hit a transparent Ice dome.

The witch backed down and extended her arm at him [Ice Aura] [Frozen Domain] she unleased to powerful freezing spells. Her goal was to freeze Chad alive.

Chad blocked the burst of Cold magic with his arms, which made them feel numb.

It was then. That Chad felt something he never wanted to feel. Cain's aura disappeared completely. Chad stood in place and looked up. The witch's father was holding Cain by the neck. Cain's body looked blue with spots of ice on his body, not a single trace of magic or life in him.

"Seems like dear won, now I only have to‚Ä¶" BAM! BAM! BAM! She felt several punches hit her shield. When her reaction caught up, she saw Chad swinging his fist at the shield.

"DIE!" Chad Growled with his eyes glowing golden, all the magic inside of him was going out of control. 'Standing here I realized, after finding my son, my purpose in life was to fulfill what I missed with him.' Chad's body, which was already at its limit, started getting pushed even further by the rage swelling inside his body.

'I failed to even hold to that, I failed him as a father‚Ä¶I failed to protect him, failed to win. NO! It's those bastards' fault, this world's fault, this fucking thing in front of me!' Chad slowly started to lose his mind.

BAM! Chad's fist connected to the shield causing a massive shock wave. Then another punch and another one.

They couldn't even count how many punches he had thrown while she blinked.

leaped directly toward where she was hiding her real body in the bushes. She turned around and 00:19

With each punch Chad threw, his muscle fibers broke and were reconstructed with the [Physical enchanting]. His veins got dislocated from their place. His body was forced to start adapting to the massive strain he was handling, he was only alive thanks to his 20 constitutions and [Flesh and Mind Synergy].

CRACK! The witch's shied cracked, She quickly used another of her [Snow clones].

In exchange for most of his Mana, Chad's body was forced to evolve on the spot to accommodate his needs.

Chad's fist tore right through the witch's Shield and her skull. As her corpse turned into snow. Chad leaped directly toward where she was hiding her real body in the bushes. She turned around and tried to run but Chad grabbed the back of her neck. Jamming his other hand into her lower back, he tore her body in half.

ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! KABOOOM! A loud Roar as a massive fire explosion bloomed in the distance. Chad jumped immediately toward Cain, even though they were tens of meters in the sky. Chad reached the father.

Chad's face was ember red with veins popping on his forehead, he wasn't there to joke or talk, he was in for blood. This man in front of him killed his son, even the gods won't save his life.

Chad swung his fist down with all of his might, it was engulfed with a golden [Wrathful Smite].

The father glared at Chad, seeing the fist of doom descend on him.

CRACK! As chad's fists connected with the father, A massive Crack appeared in the air.
