Engulfed in flames, Sofia flew toward the witch with a fiery kick. [Flame strike]

[Ice wall] The witch conjured a wall of ice to block Sofia’s attack, [Ice spike] Multiple thin spikes emerged from the wall in an attempt to impale Sofia.

VAROOM! The fire emerging from Sofia’s leg spun her around [Flame blade] Melting all the spikes. [Immolation] Sofia touched the wall with her hand, releasing her flames directly inside. KABOOM! The wall exploded and the witch backed down.

“You monster!” The witch cried as she drew her own blood. [Searing Ice] She splashed the blood around causing the temperature to drop rapidly. Sofia could see the small plants shatter for how could they get.

“This, I only need to heat the place up!” Sofia yelled as she lifted her hands up [Fire stor…] the spell failed, she was out of magic. That shouldn’t have happened, even if her own reserve has ended, she should still get some MP from Cain.

“Cain!” She looked toward Cain’s location…Her dragon eyes saw him clearly, a cold blue corpse in the father’s hand. Sofia could see Mana with her eyes. But Cain’s corpse was empty, not a single drop of Mana.

For a moment, Sofia was stunned as the thought of Cain dying seeped into her head.

The witch took that chance immediately and used her strongest spell, [Crystalline binding] Ice quickly formed around Sofia and encased her in a massive ice crystal. The temperature was lower even more than her usual magic.

Thud…Thud! Sofia’s heartbeat slowly slowed down as her body started freezing. ‘Cain is dead because he protected me, it’s my fault’

‘I should have never come, it was better if he brought Alice…’ Sizzle! Something started boiling inside of her. Regret, sorrow, disappointment, and sadness.

Thud! … Her heart went silent for a moment, it was them when her draconic blood went insane. Cain had said it before, some fire dragons explode when dying because of how much magic they have inside their bodies.

“It can always get colder, what you think is cold, is still hot enough!” Cain’s words were the last thing ringing in her head.

Sizzle! Her Draconis Fundamentum started rabidly absorbing the faint remnant of heat in the ice surrounding her, the fire magic stored in her nails.

Thud! Her heart started beating again and accelerating rapidly. THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD! THUD!

Just as she used to burst into flame when sleeping, her body got engulfed in flames once again.

The crimson flame that engulfed her quickly consumed the water around her, evaporating it and then causing it to break down even further due to the intense heat she was releasing. That water had divided into oxygen and hydrogen, which were ignited again and the circle kept repeating.

In the blink of an eye, the entire Ice crystal that the witch used to trap Sofia exploded from the built-up pressure inside.

The witch barely reacted in time to protect herself, “Didn’t she die?” the witch had realized that Sofia had some connection to dragons, but she had no idea how resilient dragons are or how hard they are to kill.

Despite the witch’s expectation, Sofia slowly walked outside of the explosion with an empty expression on her face. Her eyes were completely devoided of life, “Cain…don’t die and let alone…” Sofia mumbled in a sad, almost crying voice. Crack! The ground underneath her feet started freezing and cracking, her body was still absorbing heat from its surrounding to fuel her flames.

[Icicle Lance] The witch launched a big ice spear at her. Sofia only lifted her hand and let the spear melt upon getting close.

“Burn it down to the ground!” Sofia growled as the entire place around her burst into flames. [Firestorm] KABOOM! A massive explosion occurred!

…

Chad’s punch drew near the witch’s father as the first went into flames. CRACK! The punch seemed to hit something before connecting to the witch’s father’s head.

As if reality itself broke, a crack appeared in the sky. Chad’s punch shattered a hole big enough for his body to enter.

Inside, The witch’s father was surrounded by multiple homing ice spells and ice orbs. And facing him was Cain who was doing the same but with fire and lightning magic.

[Ice mirage] It was an eighth-tier spell that the witch’s father used. It simply isolated him and Cain from the outside world while leaving an illusion of him killing Cain outside. The purpose of the illusion was to lower the morale of Cain’s allies.

“What are you doing here?” Cain screamed, he didn’t know what kind of mess was going on outside.

“YOU!” Chad growled as his eyes fell on the witch’s father. Even if he had seen Cain and heard his voice, Chad’s brain was so focused on taking revenge that he didn’t even process that.

The black ground where Cain and the witch’s father were standing suddenly started turning red. “What?” The witch’s father flew away dispelling [Ice mirage] the entire place got eaten by Sofia’s flames.

Unlike Chad, Sofia was more sad and devastated than enraged. The moment Chad shattered the mirage and she felt Cain’s magic again, she absorbed some Mana from Cain and unleased a breath toward the mirage.

“CAIN!” Sofia flew toward them crying. Cain quickly turned toward her confused, ‘What did happen, did they face something terrifying outside?’

“Are alright?” Cain asked her but Sofia only pushed her face into his chest crying her eyes out.

Crack! Cain heard the sound of bones cracking. He turned around to see Chad kicking the witch’s father in the guts.

“Wait father, don’t kill him!” Cain screamed but Chad wasn’t listening.

Chad’s kick pushed the witch’s father to the ground and causing his guts to splatter all over the place. Chad stood above the man’s corpse with his eyes glowing with menacing golden light.

“Father!”

Cain’s words finally made it into Chad’s head. “Am I imagining things now, I should have never allowed him to follow me…” Chad was about to start crying.

“Father, why did you kill him?” Cain teleported with Sofia to his father.

For a moment, Chad had to process everything. “Cain…” Chad hardly managed to swallow his tears and keep a calm face.

“We needed to interrogate him.” Cain said with an exhausted face, “Well we at least have the wife and…” When Cain looked around he saw the wife’s torn body in the distance. There were no traces of the daughter’s body as well.

“The wife is dead…” Chad said after he finally calmed down a bit.

“I might have burned the daughter as well…” Sofia mumbled as she stared at Cain’s face with her red eyes.

“You can explain what happened to me later, for now, let’s go to the wife’s corpse.” Cain ran toward the wife’s corpse.

[Create undead] The daughter was burnt to ash so she can’t be raised. The father’s head also seems to have cracked when he hit the ground so his brain was most likely damaged.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Cain’s only option was to resurrect the wide and hope there are still some useful information in her head.

Cain had to use extra magic to fix the wife’s body and turn her into a functioning undead. He wasn’t just about to interrogate her, he will also send her to Amaya’s army.

The wife’s corpse started to move as the necrotic magic seeped into her body. As Cain expected, she was resurrected as a lich due to being a strong witch.
