‘We have to give her new memories, otherwise, she will not be able to recover.’ Cain thought as he looked down at Gracie. ‘The moment she tries to smile, her mind reacts and freezes her expression. The same way you flinch to protect your eyes, she does that to protect herself.’

After he saw her memories and completely understood what she went through, how her problem was. It was sad that there is no magic to heal her instantly, her only way out is to face her fears and stride forward. She’s a strong woman and he knows she can achieve that.

“We can stop whenever you want, if you ever wanted me to stop just say it. But I urge you to face your fears and hold in.” Cain said and waited for Gracie to nod, her face relayed no expression but Cain knew she was nervous, scared even.

To start it slow, he began by taking her shoes off. Being careful not to stab himself as they were dangerous weapons. Standing back again, he undid the straps on her back.

Now that her maid outfit was a bit loose, Cain moved to her front to undo the buttons on her neck and chest. She flinched with each button, her face remained unchanged but her body trembled.

Cain wanted to go for a quick kiss but he refrained, remembering how dangerous her saliva is. Now with Zaleria gone, he was only relying on [Sylph’s small hut] to prevent himself from jumping at Sofia. If Gracie were to kiss him, he would go wild.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Even though she was the one to start this, Sofia still felt jealous and found it hard to restrain herself. She was split between wanting to join them and wanting to give Gracie more time. Noticing her restless twisting, Alice pushed her toward Cain and Gracie.

“Cain, give her some as well!” Cain turned as heard Alice speak, he also noticed how restless she was. Without saying anything he allowed her to join, and Alice watched her with a smirk. Selena was just stretching, she seemed to be the calmer of them all.

After Sofia started using her mouth, Cain felt a shiver going up to his spine. Something was different in her. Her mouth felt hotter and tighter, he could feel it pulsing and contracting. It didn’t feel like a human mouth at all.

Cain then proceeded to finish his work on Gracie, he slowly pulled her maid uniform down up her shoulders. Make sure to watch her if she wanted to stop. After the dress was pulled down, Her whole body was covered by her suit, Alice shivered at the number of knives Gracie was carrying even to bed.

Cain’s mind was in another place, the blades weren’t important. What mattered to him was what he was seeing on her neck. The small tip of a scare was showing up, when Gracie noticed Cain staring at her scare she pulled back.

He immediately remembered what he saw in her stats before.

————————————————————————–

[Lingering Scars]: The holder’s body stills hold the scars of her abuse, always reminding her of what she has gone through and preventing her from expressing any signs of happiness. The user’s body is numb to pain and tickling, unable to feel both hunger and thirst. Gracie Gray has to consciously remember to eat and drink, always check her scarred body for wounds she might not felt. This so she wouldn’t die of hunger or infections. This also allows the user to move even when badly injured and fight until the last drop of their blood.

[Devastated emotions]: The holder unconsciously sealed his own emotions to avoid harm, after years of abuse, and after realizing that her tears only brought pleasure to her abuser. Gracie Gray gave up on both sorrow and joy. The holder experience less guilt and could make harsh decisions easily, this has given her resistance to any type of magic that relies on emotions like [Fear].

Cain immediately rushed after her to kiss the tip of the scars, she must think that her wounds are ugly. Which they are, but they weren’t a thing he minded in her or a thing she should be afraid to show. He also didn’t notice but when he moved quickly so suddenly he ended shoving himself too deep inside Sofia’s mouth making her gag.

Gracie twitched at the feeling of his soft lips on her neck. It was nothing like when that Succubus bit her, instead of the stinging pain. It was a weak tickle that she hasn’t felt in years.

Cain the went down to her legs, the suit she was wearing was almost skin tight so with just a slight pull, he was able to get her shape out. He suddenly went in for a taste and Gracie tightened her legs around his neck yet she wasn’t able to escape him. With each move of his tongue her body pulsed as if it was a wiggling snake.

After making sure she nice and tender, Cain started removing her suit when she grabbed his hand. “Should we stop?” He asked, thinking it was her limit for the day.

“Let me do like her.” She pointed at Sofia. Cain was surprised at her initiative but didn’t refuse and pulled himself from Sofia’s mouth.

As he sat back on the bed, Gracie knelt down beside Sofia to join her in. She was taking her like a mentor coping every move she does. Having the both of them licking him at the same time felt surreal so Cain naturally wondered, what if, it was four?

“Alice, Selena, Care to join the?” He asked and Alice gave him a disgusted look, ‘That’s right, she hated any contact with another woman.’

“Of course-nya!” Selena who was half asleep leaped in one go and joined the other two, With just her addition Cain felt his legs going numb. He stole another look at Alice, “You’re the only one left…” He told her.

Alice pouted, her face flush red. “Fine!” She quickly gave up, she wasn’t as disgusted by it as if it was inside them so she decided to give it a try.

Alice walked toward Cain and gently knelt in front of him. and tightly squeezed his marbles in her palm. “You will make it up for me later so get ready.” She closed her eyes and started licking with the other three.

That feeling was unbearable, four at the same time made him feel as if his heart was about to stop. Before knowing it, he was already supporting his body with hands to stay sitting.

As time passed, he felt them getting more and more aggressive, they were even taking turns to take him deep inside their mouths. It only kept getting better and better to a point he never thought was possible.

There was a single thing they didn’t account for, Gracie’s saliva was getting on Cain and they were licking it off him. Be it Alice, Sofia or Selena. At that point they were so drunk in heat they stopped caring about anything else.

Gracie’s saliva had gave them enough libido to rival her blood.
