Two hours passed, and Selena kept dodging her mother’s questions.

“Say, why do you say Nya at the end of everything?” Elena asked.

Selena quickly turned around and said. “I should go check on Cain, he must need me.” She ran away.

Elena stared at her. “What I’m going to do with that girl. Where did she learn to say that?” At that moment, her ears flinched as she picked a familiar scent in the air.

“Dear!” She yelled and jumped out the window. Running at full speed, she quickly waved through the trees.

The scent kept getting stronger and stronger the more she ran. After about a minute of running at top speed, she finally caught a glimpse of Seith.

He was fighting a horde of horse-like monsters with tentacles growing from their backs. NIHAAAAAAAAA! The monster roared like a raging horse.

Seith was injured, and a gaping hole was shot clear in his shoulder. When Elena looked around, he seem to have killed more than ten of them.

Thud! Thud! She rushed through the rain and bit the monster’s neck. The two of them rolled as she clenched her maw with enough strength to snap the monster’s neck.

“Elena, why did you come?” Seith yelled. This place was dangerous enough that he wasn’t able to retreat.

“I smelled your blood so I rushed here, what is happening?” She yelled back at him as she spat on the monster’s neck.

“They are Kelpies, the river is about to flood and they are rushing out. Run back to the village and call for help!” He seemed to scream a lot, but it wasn’t at her. He was trying to be loud and draw the monster’s attention to him so she could retreat.

Seith Leaped ahead and bit one of the kelpies on the skull, immediately killing the monster. Flash! A blue flash passing by his face.

Thud! He leaped around the dodge the beams, “Be wary, they are using water magic!” This magic impaled his shoulder earlier. A fast and powerful burst of compressed water, the blue light was the Mana generating the spell. He was using that light to predict the direction of the spells and dodge.

Elena started running on all four around the kelpies, the spells kept hitting the ground beside her. Have of the kelpies was aiming at her and the other at Seith.

BAM! One of the spells penetrated her thigh causing her to roll to the ground. “Elena!” Seith screamed, he tried to rush toward her but was stopped by the kelpie horde.

“MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!” With a single swing, his claw beheaded one of the Kelpies. “MOVE!” He kept roaring as he tore them apart. His only goal was to reach Elena.

The kelpie who managed to hit Elena walked ahead. He looked bigger than the other monsters and had a bigger mane. He was their leader.

NIIHAAAAAAAA! He started charging another spell. He seemed to be smart enough to know that she can’t hurt him from a distance so he wanted to finish her like this. Kelpies were a type of monster that had intelligence that rivaled goblins and kobolds. They had a social hierarchy, planned, and could build nests like goblins. They also had a natural ability to use water magic like how salamander can use fire magic. A single one of them was at least a B-rank monster, but such a big horde was too much for two melee fighters.

“ELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” Seith screamed as he saw the blue flash of light, the Kelpie leader was aiming straight at her chest.

CRACK! Something heavy landed in front of her with enough force to shake the ground. Selena was pissed off, this was the fourth time she was going into a frenzy. The first time was when Cain fought the succubus. The second time was against Kayden. The third time was against the death knight.

Yet this time something was different, she was smelling the blood of her mother and father. It was driving her insane.

“ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!” With a loud growl, Selena punched the jet of water away the moment it closed at them. The sheer force of the impact cause the water to dissipate immediately.

“Selena.” Her mother called her, quickly trying to check her fist. Selena’s hand was fine without a single scratch.

“ROAAAAAR!”

Elena noticed Selena’s palm twisting and being covered with black fur. Selena’s body quickly morphed into her massive black Jaguar form shocking her mother.

Thud! Selena rushed at the kelpies’ horde in frenzy, she only saw their leader ahead of her. Each of her steps left a massive imprint on the soft ground.

ROAR! ROAR! She leaped at the leader ignoring everyone else. The kelp leader backed away and started running. Even with that, Selena was faster than him and quickly grabbed a massive bite of his rear end, tearing it apart. As the monster fell to the ground, Selena gave him a second bite to the spine and tore his body apart with her powerful claws.

She was like a kitten grabbing a small ball and hitting it with her hind legs.

The other kelpies weren’t going to watch their leader die without doing anything. The entire horde charged their spells toward her.

Panicking, Seith started tearing the kelpies down to reduce the number of jets going at Selena. His efforts were almost in vain. Killing two or three between over forty monsters almost made no difference.

[Globe of Invulnerability] A multi-colored sphered covered Selena and protected her from all the jets. Cain yawned as he floated in the sky. A [Lisworth’s Resilient sphere] was protecting him from the rain.

“I just went to take a nap and look what I find. A bunch of donkeys attacking my wife and her family.” Cain stayed silent for a moment. In an instant, his magic swollen with her anger. He was angry with himself for letting his guard down. Selena could punch the beams with her knuckle-duster since they were enchanted. But she would get wounded if they hit her in any other place.

“Know your place!” He growled [Tidal Rage] His magic quickly took over the river and caused it to flood faster. As the water kept rising he immediately protected Elena and Seith with [Globe of Invulnerability]

[Gravity sinkhole] The black dot appeared in the middle of the Kelpies and started sucking the water in. Causing the water to flow in a vortex around it. The kelpies were swept in the current and weren’t able to swim away.

“Do you think this was the end of you?” Cain growled. [Control Weather: Hail Storm] Massive lumps of hail started falling from the sky and hitting the kelpies.

“Wait, there’s more!” [Control Weather: Thunder storm] The clouds became darker and lightning struck the water. [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] [Call Lightning] Cain hammered them with lightning until they were fried.

After he made sure, they were all dead. [Arcane Gate] He sucked them all into the maze. “I need some bodies for Spindle after all.” Said Cain as he landed beside Elena.

“Don’t worry, Alice will take care of your wound?” He quickly touched her head and teleported her back home.

“Selena, are you okay?” He called her. “I’m fine, just got angry a bit.” She growled while still being in her Jaguar form. Cain noticed that she was not adding nya. She must have been at the edge with her parents almost being killed.

“Selena, is that you?” Seith approached her. Selena immediately morphed back. “Yeah, it’s a spell he gave me. As you can see, he isn’t a mere mage…nya!” She finally remembered to add the nya.

Cain patted her head to calm her down. He had already realized how scared she was. “Would you mind teleporting father first-nya?” She asked with a worried face.

“He is a man. He can bear with it for a while longer.” Replied Cain. “You!” Seith growled at him and then laughed, “I could bear the pain but the bleeding will get me.” Cain smiled back at him.

“Here you go!” Cain then teleported Seith back home as well.

“Let go back as well-nya,” Selena said with a smile on her face. She was glad that everything ended well. The rain seems to be stopping since Cain tempered with the weather to the flood was stopped with the monsters.

“Not yet!” Said Cain. [Lisworth’s magnificent mansion] He opened the door to his mansion. “I want us to talk first. I already told Alice and Sofia that we will be late.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Cain then dragged Selena inside.

“What did you want to talk about-nya?” She asked while they were still at the door.

Cain smiled as he called one of the ghost servants, “Prepare the bath, of course, and the spare clothe we left her yesterday as well.” The ghost woman immediately bowed down and disappeared.

Selena’s shirt was soaked in blood from her tearing the kelpie’s leader apart. She needed a bath and a change of clothes. He wanted to ask her why she was emitting the nya, why did she run from home, and why everyone treat her as if she was weak while he found her already strong.

“M-master, the bath is ready!” The ghost whispered to them.
