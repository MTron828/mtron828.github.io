Seith was chasing a herd of Hulking bison with his wife Elena. The bison looked exactly like normal animals except for their extra bulky muscles and massive brown horns.

The herd of bison contains over one hundred animals. Their hooves rumbled as they crossed the open planes.

Seith was hiding with his wife in the bushes and targeting an injured male. The animal seems to have been wounded in a mating flight.

The plan was simple, Elena will force him to run toward Seith who will go for the kill with a bite.

After about a half-hour of stalking, they finally got a good opportunity to strike. When Elena was about to rush out, a massive shadow engulfed the planes.

Seith looked up and he didn’t like what he saw, a whole red dragon was soaring down toward them. “Return Elena, that thing must have come to hunt. It’s unfortunate but we have no hunt here today.

Elena rushed toward him so they can retreat. It was a stupid idea to fight a dragon over its meal. Moreover, even if they waited until after the dragon left, the bison would have already run away.

As they were retreating, Seith notice that the dragon’s shadow was tailing them and not the bison. “Elena, you go ahead. This thing is tailing us. I will lose it in the forest and then follow you.” Seith said with a worried face.

Elena understood what he meant. Dragons were intelligent creatures so losing them was out of the question. Seith intended to be the dragon’s meal so she can have enough time to run.

“Why are you running?” They suddenly heard a voice calling them. Elena looked up and she saw Cain waving his hand on top of the dragon’s head.

“Dear look, that’s Cain.” She said in surprise as she stopped. Seith looked and he remembered the woman that was with Cain.

Cain immediately flew toward them and Zaleria morphed back to her human form. “It’s been a while, how are doing?” Cain asked them with a cheerful face.

Now that he knew it was Cain and Zaleria. Seith’s attitude completely changed and he was getting angry about his lost prey.

“Thanks to you the bison ran away, that was our meal for the day!” Seith screamed.

“Dear, it’s not the time for that.” Elena grabbed his shoulder. Seith immediately stooped.

“You were hunting? We can help you gather a bit.” Cain said with a smile. Setting the gate will only take a few seconds so he might as well help them hunt.

“The herd has scattered, how do you intend to hunt them?” Seith exclaimed in anger. He was hunting for years and this was not the first time he was about to hunt bison.

“You have a dragon here, even if they scattered I will grab us a few,” Zaleria said as she morphed back to her dragon form. She was too massive to hide and stalk but suddenly her body blended with the environment.

“Dragons are like lizards, after all, they can change the color of their skin to camouflage,” Cain said as he stared directly at where Zaleria was.

Only her red glowing eyes appeared clear, “I don’t appreciate being called a lizard.” She growled at him. Calling a dragon a lizard was the same as calling a human a monkey.

“Sorry, sorry. Let’s go hunt some bison.” Cain said as he pulled his sword. “Where did they go?” Cain asked as an evil smile crossed his face.

Zaleria tilted her head slightly, “I can hear their footstep about nine hundred feet in that direction.” She pointed with one of her claws.

“I will be back quickly,” Cain said as he disappeared. [Teleport] He teleported into a hundred feet above the bison herd. He quickly found the biggest males and started hunting.

[Teleport] Cain appeared beside the biggest bison he could find. The beast got surprised and jumped to the side, quickly shifting its head down and rushing for a ram.

[Mist step] Cain teleported to the beast’s side and evaded the ram. Then with a single touch. [Teleport] Cain teleported the beast directly to where Seith and Elena were.

Seith was standing with Elena staring at Zaleria when a bison appeared mid-air. The beast fell on his head and broke his neck.

“What?” Seith rushed toward the bison to check from where it came.

“Is that Cain’s doing?” Elena asked Zaleria. The dragon smiled. “It’s him.”

After that bison, another five appeared the same way before Cain returned to them. Seith stared at the six massive and healthy males that Cain hunted. To be exact he teleported them and then let gravity do the killing.

“It’s my turn then,” Zaleria said as she rushed with her massive draconic body. Even with how massive her body was, she could easily wave between the trees silently.

Her wings were tucked tightly to her body while her skin constantly changed color to match that of the forest.

The bison herd was panicking. They have just lost the leading male and most of the candidates. The remaining young males and females were panicking.

One of the young males was running north and the herd just followed him, as he seemed the biggest.

The next thing the herd saw was a massive creature running beside that young male. Where did it come from? They couldn’t hear or see it.

With a single bite, Zaleria took the bison’s head and rushed toward the females. Cain took the biggest six prey in the herd so she had to bring more to keep her dragon pride.

The herd turned around to run away but then. Thud! With a single leap, Zaleria jumped over the whole herd and landed on the opposite side. A single swing from her claw took another two bison.

The herd tried to change direction but Zaleria cut them again and grabbed another two bison in her claws. Swiftly breaking their skulls with her powerful jaw.

After a couple of minutes, Cain saw Zaleria fly toward them with her Hands and hind legs filled with bison. She had hunted over fifteen of them. When counted, there were sixteen in total.

Zaleria stayed hovering in the sky. “Where should I drop them?” she asked with a wide grin. It was as if she had won something.

“Drop them in the village. I will bring the remaining six.” Said Cain. Zaleria immediately flew to the Black-jaguar village to drop the hunt. Cain used [Arcane Gate] to go to the village with Seith and Elena. He used [Teleport] to move his prey.

The village was in an uproar, twenty-two bison and a whole dragon. They were brought by the male, which Selena brought. Cain became the talk of all the females in the village.

The next rumors that spread were that those bison were a tribute to Selena’s parents to ask for their blessing. Seith and Elena couldn’t possibly eat all of those so they took the biggest one and gave the rest to the village.

“So, what brought you here? Where is Selena?” Elena asked as she used her claws to disembowel the bison and start butchering.

“I came to create a portal at your home,” Cain said.

“Portal? What is that?” Said Seith, he didn’t seem to know what a portal is.

“It’s the same magic we used earlier. It will allow you to visit Selena and allow us to come to visit at any time.” Cain said.

“But we can’t use magic,” Elena said as she casually slicked the Bison leg with her claw.

“You don’t have to know that. It will work just like any other door that you can walk through.” Cain stood and walked toward Seith and touched his hand. Cain gifted him a symbol so he can use the maze safely, Cain then gave Elena a one-two.

[Arcane Gate] Cain opened the door. “Come here for a second, I will show you how to use it,” Cain said.

Seith stood and Elena wiped her hands from the blood. They all walked through the door and into a white room. Cain told them to open any door they want as all of them will lead to Furberg’s mansion.

Seith slowly opened one of the doors. Behind was an empty room. Thud! Thud! Thud!

They heard something rushing toward the room. Selena smelled her parents. “Mom!” Selena who kicked the door rushed at her mom.

Seith made a sad face as his daughter preferred her mother.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Is this your home?” Seith asked trying to think about something else.

Cain smiled and stretched his arms. “Yeah, for the time being. I will probably settle in Ourals after a few days.”

“You’re moving?” Seith said with a puzzled face.

“Well, I intended to have the wedding soon. Of course, you’re invited.” Cain smiled.

…It took Seith a couple of seconds to process all of that information. His daughter was getting married soon…

“Ara, Ara. Congratulation my little daughter.” Elena tried to lift Selena up but she wasn’t able to. “We need to stay and help in the preparation them.” She flexed her arms and smiled.

“Selena…Selena is getting married…” Seith was drowning in his own world. He wasn’t able to believe that this day had come.

And it was with a human no less. Usually, he would have refused but Cain had proved his strength repeatedly. He couldn’t complain about a man who tamed a dragon.

“I’m going to take a bath, tell me when the dinner is ready,” Zaleria said with a smile.

“Do you prefer cooked or raw meat?” Elena asked.

“Raw meat is always better,” Zaleria replied and Elena smiled.

“Can I use that PORTAL thing again?” Elena asked Cain and he nodded. “You can use it as much as you want. Treat it like any other door at your house.” Cain replied.

“Thank you.” Elena smiled as she headed back to get ready.

“Selena is…” Seith was still out so Cain dragged him outside.
