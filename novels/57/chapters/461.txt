“You sure about that? I don’t think it will work,” Zaleria said with a questioning face.

“It has already been done once, there is no harm in doing it a second time.” Cain thought back to how Mystra nerfed the magic in ancient times by locking the max spell tire at nine.

“What do you? AWAWA!” Zaleria cried out as sharp pain stung her fingers.

“Focus, focus. I’m working here remember!” Cain grabbed her hand tightly as he modified the previous enchantments.

1-[Seal of Dexterity: +2 Dexterity] => [Seal of Dexterity: +6 Dexterity]

2-[Seal of Holy Smite] => [Seal of Lightning Smite]

3-[Seal of body attraction] => [Seal of body detonation] (Instead of the original effects, Zaleria’s severed limbs can act as bombs)

4-[Seal of charge-less spell] => [Seal of charge-less spells] (Allows for three instant casts a day instead of the original one)

5-[Seal of Etherealness] => [Seal of Etherealness] (No change except that she can use it twice a day instead of once)

6-[Seal of the Shielder] => [Seal of the Shielder] (Duration increased from one minute to two)

7-[Seal of the overcharge] => [Seal of the overcharges] (Two overcharged spells a day)

8-[Seal of the Titan] => [Seal of the Titan] (duration increased to two minutes)

9-[Seal of the legendary Resilience] => [Seal of the legendary Resilience] (Can activate one per week instead of once per month)

10-[Seal of the assisted control] (No change)

Cain cracked his fingers as he watched her pant, the procedure shouldn’t have been that painful. Even though he modified nine of her buffs, that shouldn’t hurt as much as installing a new one.

“How do you feel? Anything abnormal?”

“Just feeling like my fingertips have been smacked with a hammer, that’s all. Can’t you give me a warning?” Zaleria glared down at him.

In the background, Olivia just woke up to Zaleria’s scream and she looked horrified. Zaleria was laying naked on a floating table while a pot was boiling on the counter.

“Master, what is happening?” She asked standing up, “Is she okay?”

“Yeah, just giving her some things. Care to check the pot?”

Upon hearing that Olivia got immediately to work and rushed to the counter. She took a small sample and poured it into a glass.

“Solution is completely black, mana density should be around 100. Nature is unknown. Temperature, it is boiling.”

“Good, start stirring it while I work here,” Cain replied as he stood up. Grabbing his chair, he approached Zaleria’s feet. She still had ten slots for buffs.

“What should we add? It better be simpler ones so they won’t interfere with the tattoos.”

Zaleria slightly lifted her head to look at him, “Cost reduction or damage amplifiers are good enough.”

“Got, those won’t be that painful. But from today we’re going to start grinding levels so come to me at any time if you wanted to change anything.” Cain said as he started working.

11- [Reduced Elemental Cast Cost: Fire]

12- [Fire Manipulation]

13- [Stored Spell: Fireball] One per level

14- [Elemental absorption: Fire]

15- [Increased spell power]

16- [Heightened senses]

17- [Mana Regeneration] +30MP per minute

18- [Cooldown Reduction]

19- [Elemental immunity: Cold]

20- [Enchanted Witch Domain]

Cain has said they won’t hurt as much, which was half a lie. Zaleria’s body started twisting. Grinding her teeth to keep the pain at bay.

“How do you feel?” Cain asked standing up.

“Awful, you said it won’t hurt.” She stared at his back.

“It always hurt, it’s a matter if the person is strong enough to endure it or not. You’re almost a wyrm so you should be able to take it.” He replied as he inspected the pot. It was ready.

Cain lifted the pot with [Telekinesis] and approached Zaleria. “Blood, where do you want it to be taken?”

Zaleria just handed him her hand, “Do it as you like, if you can.”

She was almost certain that Cain would find it at least hard to cut her skin. She was a dragon, after all, he might be able to slice them with his blade but not here.

Cain immediately created a small lightning needle and poked her arm to draw the blood. “As long as I know where your scales are, I can aim under them.” Said with a smile.

“You proclaim that you can see my scales, they are tiny.” When a dragon transforms, its scales stay on its skin but shrink. The result is a humanoid-looking skin but it’s made of thousands of tiny scales.

After getting everything ready, Cain sat back up and put his hand on Zaleria’s forehead. “Three tattoos, this is all that your body can take.”

“I thought it would be more.”

“So did I, you should have been able to take ten at least. Probably since we used Aboleth ink instead of Kraken’s. The tattoos can be stronger though.”

“How about you remix it with Kraken blood to get more?”

“No, the regeneration effect you wanted is going to require something strong.”

“Ok, then I leave it to you.”

“The first tattoo is going to be the regeneration. It will be separated into two sections, each one on one of your shoulders.”

“The second tattoo is going to have a time-slowing effect, from the back of your neck to the start of your tailbone, it will slow time to 50% and last depending on how much you can handle.”

“The last one is going to all your nails from the two tattoos to allow the usage of buffs even while they are active.”

Cain opened his palm and several magical needles appeared from his fingers, “I’m going to do this subdermal, you should be able to change the color later however you want.”

After an hour, Cain finished drawing all the tattoos. To the untrained eyes, they looked like incomprehensible scribbles that held no meaning. But to those versed in magic, they could read just how meticulously he made them. Each of them was enough to qualify as a spell book on its own.

“I finished, just don’t try and use them until tomorrow noon. They need some time to settle.” After saying that, Cain headed out. His job was done.

Feeling exhausted, he remembered how long this day was. ‘If I was only a bit stronger, that fight wouldn’t have taken such a turn.’

‘What were you doing?’ Kayden’s words rang in his head, the man was right. Instead of fooling around, he should have been grinding.

As he sat on the table Klara approached him. “Master, do you want something to eat?” She asked.

“How long until dinner?” Cain asked.

“Quite some time, would you like something else to eat?” She asked with a smile.

“Yeah, just give me anything.”

As he was waiting, Cain was thinking about what he needed to do from now on.

As things are right now, he can’t hope to survive in the elvish kingdom unless Sylph holds his hands. And on top of that, that place was the same continent his master was in, and she will be a problem.

Cain can’t hope to beat her in a magic fight, she can dispatch him in the blink of an eye as he is now. ‘Kayden is right, time to grind, level goal is 60 at least,’

Cain smiled, “Time to abuse hell.”
