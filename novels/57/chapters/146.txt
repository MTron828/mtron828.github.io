With the rumbling of thunder and the sizzling of inferno, two flashes of blue and red light soared through the sky. Everyone living in the city looked toward the Lisworth mansion with exhausted faces, just that night a fire broke with a wild being in their ally, a dragon appeared at the gate, and even before that, a furious fight raged in the lord’s mansion.

“Mommy, what’s that?” A little kid asked as he tried to stop his mother from walking. She slowly turned around and said, “That blue lightning, I saw it a few nights ago. It’s probably that white-haired guy playing with his magic.” Rumors have started circulating the city like fire in the hay.

War is close. Some soldiers speculated as their training grew harsher.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Two dragons have ravaged the forest close to the Lloyd, their father was badly injured in the confrontation. Said some travelers.

The Lord’s son Leon has been seen going around with Leyla, something had to be up. Said some maids in the lord’s mansion who were keeping an eye on Leon.

Zaleria was using fire jets from her feet just like Sofia was doing, but her control was far superior. She could stay stable and hover, accelerate instantly, and take sharp turns.

Cain on the other hand was using [Fly] to fly and [Thunder step] To accelerate, close the distance, his lightning sword created by [Elemental weapon] radiated a brilliant light with each swing.

Zaleria was doing her best to not hit Cain, she needed to hold back a lot as her 30 strength would tear his body apart with the slightest hit. with her 29 constitutions, she didn’t need to worry about him even leaving a scratch on her.

CLAP! [Thunder step] Cain flashed toward Zaleria brandishing his glowing sword. With a single lightning-fast swing to the neck, She easily dodged it to the side.

Lifting one finger [Fireball] Zaleria set Cain on flame, in the worst case he would be burned to a crisp. “A straight attack would never work?” Cain muttered as he used [Blur] to avoid being burnt and retreated with [Mist step]

‘I hate using it because it doesn’t suit me but it doesn’t matter now, Even with it being flawed it would still help hold for longer’ Cain made his mind to dance [Bladedance] Gracefully swinging his blade above his head, Even though he was fly mid-air he looked as if he was stepping on solid ground.

The smug smile quickly disappeared from Zaleria’s face, she lifted her hands ready to defend herself. “Bladedance? Why did a human go through learning that? No, where did you, and when did you learn it, the dark elf kingdom is far south and they only accept females attendee.” Zaleria recognize his stance and started to question Cain’s origin, a human who lived here won’t have enough time in his life to learn such a thing.

“I learned it from a friend, She fought magnificently until her last breath and I just had to burn her techniques into my eyes.” Cain quickly charged at Zaleria with a downward swing, The moment she blocked it, the attack shifted direction to the left and aimed for her neck.

Zaleria backed down [Hellfire] She hurled an orb of black flames at Cain. Tin! she heard the ringing sound of metal, it sounded closer to a glass bell.

[Blur] [Mist step] Cain’s body refracted and appeared directly in front of her, still keeping the momentum from his previous attack, he swung at her torso.

Seeing that Zaleria happily swung her hand at him, his slash simply bounced off her chest as she charged. “Using magic? I thought blade dance can only be used by warriors, is the notion of it hindering the flow of Mana just a myth?”

Cain dodged Zaleria’s strike, he didn’t want to risk blocking it. “It isn’t a myth!” Cain said calmly as pulled on Zaleria’s hand and went for a stab. It’s true, that Blade dance will block the Mana flow if done correctly, But with Cain’s [Bladedance] being unsuitable to him, the flaws weakened both the art’s effectiveness and Mana blockage. It still resulted in lower performance and weaker spells though.

Alice, Sofia, and Selena could only watch from the ground. Cain was swinging against Zaleria with a serious face while she was smiling. “I never saw Cain fight like that,” Sofia said.

Alice looked at her with a surprised face, “I bet he fought like this against the succubus, until now all his fights have ended in a couple of moves.”

“Are you stupid-nya? He fought harder against that black lizard-nya!” Selena mentioned the fight against Morena, which was more a desperate struggle to live than a proper fight.

“What are you doing?” Sebas asked as he saw Gracie corking her hand back as if aiming. Her hand was empty so he didn’t know what she was doing.

“Following Cain’s orders.” She replied, Sebas looked at her strangely. Cain had asked them to fight him, not for her to stay in that weird pose.

Suddenly, Gracie twisted her hand and threw something into the sky, Sebas only saw a slight glow as the sunlight reflected from the fast object.

In the sky, Cain was engaged in a heated battle with Zaleria. Each swing from him got easily blocked, and each strike from her he dodged. Zaleria intentionally tried to avoid spells that could fly away as they might burn the city, Cain on the other hand threw all he could at her.

As he swung his sword, Zaleria blasted a flash of flame from her leg and flew above him. With a spin, a drop kick was falling on his head. Cain was about to use Mist stem when he felt a sharp pain in his left thigh. A raging heat flowed to his head and he was seeing Zaleria naked.

Cain used all his mental capacity to fight the weird urge and take a glance at his thigh, a butter knife was stuck there. ‘Gracie?!’ before the thought could take hold of his mind, he felt Zaleria’s feet crash into his shoulder.

Cain’s body was hurled toward the ground at a tremendous speed. BAAM! As he crashed to the ground, Zaleria flew right after him and landed with a kick at his face side. “You lost!” She said with a smug.

Even though he has just lost, Even though he might have broken a bone. Gracie’s spit was taking hold of his mind and he could only see Zaleria standing naked at his face.

[Sleep] Cain immediately put himself to sleep before he will lash out. Gracie didn’t have any bloodlust so it was his fault for not keeping an eye on her. As the other three were amazed by the fight, she was still following his order and engaged in the fight against him.

…

Cain woke up in the middle of the night in his bed, Alice was sleeping to his side naked in her devil form. He tried to sit up but his head was hurting, Gracie really got him.

“Master, are you awake?” The voice that called him was that of Gracie, she was sitting on the couch in the corner of the room. Feeling him move, Alice woke up yawning.

“Are you okay? You scared us when you passed out!” Alice immediately went into a panic. “Gracie, come here apologize, you almost got him killed!” Alice yelled.

“Hold a minute. What do you mean by that, it was me who lost track of her.” Cain pointed out that it was his fault not her. “Even so, I didn’t pass out, I put myself to sleep to endure the aphrodisiac effect. Why you three didn’t attack, I bet you could have used something?”

Cain was right, it was supposed to be them all against him. Alice could have used her aura, Sofia could have used spells and Selena could throw rocks and the like. Improvising is an important skill to master.

“What do you mean?” Alice looked at him dumbfounded.

“Gracie was right, you two should have attacked!” Cain replied as he saw Gracie walk toward the bed.

“But you almost got hurt!” Alice replied with a shaking voice, “That’s right, it was supposed to be a fight, of course, I would get hurt.” Getting hurt by a mistake in training is better than getting hurt by it in a life or death situation.

At that moment Cain felt light-headed, he didn’t know if it was exhaustion or a lingering effect from Gracie’s aphrodisiac. Cain looked down at Alice’s body and at Gracie’s face as she sat by their side, his vision slightly blurred as he felt the heat rush to his face. ‘This is bad!’ He though.
