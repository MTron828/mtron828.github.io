Soon enough, Sofia joined them in the bath and took her seat on Cain’s lap. Actively preventing both Lexi and Amaya from getting closer.

“Sofia, the water is getting hotter with you here. Can you calm down a bit?” Said Cain. She was sitting on his lap so her body heat was boiling the water around his marbles.

“What do you mean by that? I’m calm.” She replied while clinging tighter to him.

“The water was already hot, you’re a half dragon so your body is releasing heat all the time.” Cain caressed her stomach.

It was just like earlier when flames were emerging from her nose. Since the red dragons are violent by nature. They have adapted to release flames when angry. This helped them fight longer. The problem was that Sofia and Zaleria are far calmer than a red dragon should be.

For reference, Earth dragons were known to be the calmest of dragons. Zaleria is old enough to be able to control herself but Sofia was not.

“Zaleria could freeze things by sucking heat, try using that to moderate your heat output. It will also serve as good training for you.” Cain suggested.

“It’s easier said than done, I was trying to freeze things for a while but I always failed,” Sofia replied with a sad voice. Only being able to use fire magic was slowly getting to her head.

“I’m not a dragon, I never was one so I can’t give you direct advice. But would like to hear how the concept of cold magic works?” Cain asked with a smile on his face.

“If it isn’t long, we’re here to relax,” Sofia replied. Lexi tried to sneak close to Cain but immediately stopped when Sofia stared at her.

“Let’s start from fire as it’s a concept you understand. Flames are just extremely hot smoke that is released when something is burning.” Cain looked at Sofia’s face, she was focused on him so he continued the explanation.

“So in fire magic, we don’t create the burning, we just use magic to increase the air temperature to the point it glows like flames. That is usually done by concentrating a small ball of Mana to use as a heat source.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Cain lifted one of his fingers up, a small red ball appeared on top of it. “This condensed Mana. Look when I release a considerable amount of heat, the ball gets engulfed in flames.”

Cain then lifted another finger, and a small blue ball emerged “They are usually transparent. The color is just for explanation. This is a ball of condensed Mana. I will use it to absorb heat from the air.”

When Cain said that, small white particles started forming around the blue ball. “The vapor from the bath gets frozen and turns into snowflakes. This is cold magic, also known as ice magic, and white magic. They all mean the same thing.”

Amaya tried to touch the blue ball. “Don’t, it’s dangerous.” Cain immediately dispelled the cold magic. Amaya might not be harmed as she is a zombie but Lexi might attempt to touch it as well and will get frostbites.

“Ahem…What I mean to say. The Draconis Fundamentum inside your body might be acting like those balls, instead of releasing heat, try and absorb it instead.” Cain explained.

“I don’t quite understand, that thing is supposed to be an organ, not a magic ball that can be controlled,” Sofia said with a confused face.

“For that you better have Zaleria explain it. She must know more than I about this matter. When you get it done I will try and teach you cold magic.” Cain smiled. He did try teaching her cold magic at the start but she failed, she might succeed after doing it the dragon way.

BAM! Suddenly the ground shook violently. Lexi stumbled into the water and Sofia stood up.

“Calm down, this is Zaleria and father’s magic…” Cain stopped mid-sentence. “Hold up, father’s magic is fading?”

[Arcane Eye] Cain immediately created a spectral eye of magic and sent it toward the backyard. The season he saw was weird, to say the least.

Zaleria had a blue eye and her left arm is twisted in a weird way. Chad had his head drilled into the ground with blood pouring from the back of his skull.

Zaleria had 30 strengths and 29 constitutions, who did that to her? Cain couldn’t sense any strange aura around them. His father also looked badly injured.

~Zaleria what happened~ Cain used [Message] to talk to her.

~Ahh! Sorry, I didn’t mean to hit him like that…~ Zaleria apologized.

~What do you mean, what happened, who attacked you~ Cain asked, something seemed off.

~Ah! No, we’re not under attack. It was just me and your father, he is the one who left me like this~

‘If it’s safe then let’s send Alice immediately’ Cain thought ~Alice go to the backyard and heal them~

After giving Alice orders he asked Zaleria for an explanation.

Zaleria and Chad were sparring normally, but as time passed, she notice that Chad’s punches were getting heavier and heavier.

Eventually, even her arms started to feel numb from the constant beating. Thud! At that moment, Chad leaped to her side in a single step, grabbed her wrist, and in a single strike with his right forearm, he dislocated her elbow. Without losing momentum, he directed his fist toward her face and smacked her left eye.

This was more than she expected from a human, as a reaction and in the heat of the moment, she instinctively smacked Chad to the ground.

~Stop joking, he only has 20 strength. There is no way he could dislocate your elbow let alone give you a blue eye~ Cain did not seem to believe her.

~I swear I’m not lying, are you sure he just has 20 strength? His hits felt like they belonged to someone with at least 28 strength~

~No way, I’m coming right away~ Cain told her as he stood, he need to hurry and check on them.

~Alice has arrived, you don’t need to rush~ Zaleria told him as she sat on the ground. Her arm was screaming in pain, she didn’t expect to get such an injury from a barehanded human.

“First Cain and now his father, does something weird exist in their family or what?” Zaleria growled out loud.

Soon enough Cain arrived, after checking on his father he inspected him. Chad’s stats never changed, they have stayed the same. ‘We he is maxed, what did I expect’ Cain sighed but then noticed something in Chad’s body.

‘Magic? It’s similar to mine but it’s stuck to his body…’

“How is he doing?” Zaleria approached them.

Cain didn’t reply, he was too focused on his father’s magic.

‘The threads of Mana are intertwined in his muscles and bones and move directly toward the heart and lungs. There is no inscription on them at all.’

Cain immediately picked a stone from the garden and focused [Enchanting] on it.

“What are you doing?” Zaleria asked him again.

‘They have the same flow, output, and frequency… It’s just that mine only flow in the non-living matter while his flow only on his body. But his magic lack inscriptions so he isn’t activating it consciously, he was born with it?’
