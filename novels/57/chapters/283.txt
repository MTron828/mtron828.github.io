Cain headed straight to his room after dinner. He needed to think of a way to convince the church.

The god in this city is Chauntea, the goddess of life and bounty, she is also known as the deity of agriculture and plant cultivation.

In a world where most people live by farming, such a portfolio is ridiculously strong.

Cain could swear he did see Jemima wear an amulet of Chauntea the other day. But, she was a fairly caring goddess. As long as you farm, and respect the land, she will be happy to bless you with a bountiful harvest.

Furberg’s amazing harvest of wheat is partially due to her blessing as this city has many devoted followers. Cain usually hates interacting with gods since they always give mortals less than they get from them, or they usually have ulterior motives that they hide.

Amaterasu is one of the gods that Cain hates interacting with. Even though she was a good blessing to Alice, she hide the fact she wanted to use Cain to stop the dragons. He felt it was like I will save your girl so go solo the strongest race for us. That was a rip-off in his opinion.

Chauntea on the other hand did not act like that. She only cared about farming. Cain could remember a funny moment that he read about in a book.

The god of war Tempus has started a war against the god of tyranny Bane. That has led to two massive kingdoms facing each other, each one of them carrying the flag of one of the gods.

Those armies made a mistake however, they recruited farmers for the war and trampled the farmlands. Obviously, this didn’t sit well with Chauntea as she heard the prayers of her farmers dying in war. So with that, she caused a massive drought and famine in the two kingdoms.

The other two gods knew this was Chauntea’s wrath but they still waged war nonetheless. However, after about a month, the priests of the two gods suddenly lost all of their spells and holy magic. Chauntea then spoke from the alters of the two gods and told the armies that the war is over and they went silent.

What was terrifying is that The priests of Bane and Tempus lost their power for over a decade. This meant that Chauntea the goddess of agriculture has beaten the god of war and the god of tyranny so bad, that they had to recover for a decade.

So this means that Cain has to get her to make an exception for him. Which wasn’t really that hard, it’s just that church makes it seem impossible. It only required an adequate offering to the goddess, which also must help the agricultural growth in the area.

This was the second reason he was going through the trouble of building the waypoint between Ourals and Furberg. Making the transportation of goods between the two cities is sure to please the goddess. And hopefully, get all of the rings blessed.

Since the process of wedding in the church required him to present the wedding rings to the goddess alter.

On the next day, Zaleria left early in the morning to find her hut. Cain as well woke up and headed toward the market with Sebas. His goal was to buy six golden rings, one for himself, one for Alice, one for Sofia, one for Selena, one for Gracie, and one for Marina. He was hoping to find some that were adorned with rare precious gems or works of art. Otherwise, he can just ask Dolrig to make him a few simple rings by hammering a few gold coins.

“Master, the carriage is ready.” Sebas bowed slightly for Cain at the gate. He had prepared a fancy carriage for them to use.

“Since you have gone through the trouble of preparing it I guess, I did want to walk honestly,” Cain said as he saw the carriage.

“You must keep a decent picture to the people. That is your duty.” Sebas said proudly as he opened the carriage door for Cain.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Cain laughed, “What picture, I’m just a slightly strong adventure, not a noble or a royalty. What are you planning next, having me make an heir?”

Upon hearing Cain’s words, Sebas quickly averted his eyes. Cain caught up on that.

“I’m going to hang you if you tried something stupid!” Cain growled at him.

“Sorry master Cain but it isn’t me. Lord William is bugging us nonstop asking when his grandson is coming so I wanted to have a talk about it with you…” Sebas rushed to explain.

“He did say something like that…I can understand his feeling but that would be impossible in the next two years at least.” Cain said as he signaled for Sebas to get in the carriage already.

There was a problem between him and Alice. He was a high abomination and she was a devil. Cain had no idea what kind of creature their son will be. Until he can determine that, having a child was a no-go.

Soon enough they reached the market. Surprisingly, people who recognized Cain’s carriage moved out of the way. No one wanted to mess with the white mage.

“I’m saying to you old lady, the grain price has risen up. It is one silver coin per bag. Take it or leave it!” Cain hears shouting from the market.

“Yeast as well. The trade has been bad with the capital lately due to the snow piling up on the mountain road. It’s now nine silver coins per yeast bag.” The shouting continued.

Cain stopped the carriage and walked to see what was happening. Did it snow that bad?

To his surprise, he found the merchant arguing with non-other than Mabel. She had two big piles of goods to her side. They looked so heavy it made Cain question how she could carry such things.

“Grandma Mabel, how are you doing?” Cain greeted Mabel as he walked behind her. The merchant jumped backward as he saw Cain. Not a single merchant worth his salt would not recognize Cain at this point.

The merchant immediately knew that this could be either the end of his career or the day luck smiled at him.

“Isn’t it Lord Cain, what brought you here to our humble establishment?” The merchant smiled as he walked toward Cain.

Cain looked at him and smiled, “I just called Mabel grandma, were you so focused on profiting from me that you forget to apologize to her?” The merchant froze in place, blood drained from his face. He had made a grave mistake.

Sebas watched silently from behind Cain with a smile on his face. Even he had missed that Cain called Mabel his grandmother. That was a good move.

“Leave him be Cain, he has it rough as well.” Mabel tapped Cain lightly on the shoulder.

Cain smiled as he looked at her, “What were you trying to buy? I pretty sure he can give you a good deal…” Cain glared at the merchant with an evil smile.

“O-of course, you will never find a better deal elsewhere.” The merchant smiled trying to hide his shaking legs.

“Then, would you mind telling us about the problem we heard you yell about earlier?” Cain took one of the chairs and handed it to Mabel. “Please have a seat. Our conversation might take a bit of time.”

Cain wanted to know about what was happening in the mountains. He also might be able to use the merchant’s connection to get his hands on some unique rings in secret as well.
