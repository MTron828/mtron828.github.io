“What do you mean?” Nemmoxon glared at Cain with a sharp eye.

“Remember? You promised to serve me lifelong if you found that I tamed a red dragon.” Cain smiled as he rested his hand on Zaleria’s shoulder.

At that moment Nemmoxon realized the implication of what she said before. “You know, you’re still young so you should’ve been careful with your words.”

“What did you say?” Nemmoxon growled.

“Calm down, we have a common goal of killing him.” Cain smiled.

“There is no difference between a red dragon and that Aboleth-Kraken.” In Nemmoxon eyes, serving the lesser evil was just as bad as serving the greater evil.

“That’s why you’re young, reds respect power, and they aren’t evil. As long as they follow a powerful person they can serve for good. The problem lay in their immense strength that makes them hard to beat so they become tyrants.” Cain tried explaining it to her.

Nemmoxon stared at them in silence for a while before transforming back to her human shape. “Fine have it your way, what should I do?”

“Rest with the girls until I finish some busyness with the king, I do want the marine forces to help us if possible,” Cain said.

“They will die, especially if he came as well,” Nemmoxon said with a serious face, she knew how powerful the Krakens are.

“Hell no, I just want them to clean the blood afterward,” Cain said with a straight face, in his eyes, that’s the only thing the entire kingdom fleet is good for.

“I see, Krakens are talented in sinking ships down. When are we starting?”

“As I said before, you have to wait.” Cain opened an arcane gate so they can return to the inn.

After spending a calm and uneventful night in the inn, Cain headed to the castle the next morning while the rest headed toward the guild. Since all the investigators were killed, the guild had no idea of what happened besides that they never returned. The Guildmaster and Cain are the primary suspects since the guild was looking into them from the start. This means that Chad could head toward the guild with everyone else and no one will ever notice.

Cain approached the castle’s massive gate and the guards there staring at him with suspicious eyes. His look was triggering a weird reaction from them.

“What are your businesses here?” One of the guards approached him and asked politely. This was the king’s castle after all.

“I just want to have a tour inside, the guards at the gate said that I can get one,” Cain asked with a smile.

The guards’ faces seemed to ease up, “We usually only do it when we have more than ten people ready but I will make an exception.” He smiled, “I also want some time off…” He whispered to Cain. Those tours are something the guards do to get out of their boring routine.

“I will be taking this one on a tour, please keep my post guarded.”

After paying, Cain and the guard started slowly walking across the castle garden. “So…is this illegal?” Cain asked.

“No, the king has approved saying it will strengthen the relationship between him and the citizen. The place is heavily fortified and guarded so that a few people inside won’t pose a threat.” The guard replied.

“I see, it will be scary if a single man could threaten the castle,” Cain said with a faint smile.

“Look there, you came at a good time.” The guard pointed upstairs to a spot in the garden. Princess Noel was drinking tea with her mother.

“Isn’t it the princess, would she get offended if I waved at her?” Cain asked. The guard knew that each of the princesses had a lot of fans.

“She won’t, in fact, most people who come here try to call her out. She always replies with a smile.” The guard said.

“Hey!” Cain waved at her with his usual evil smile.

Noel was drinking her morning tea with her mother and talking about her trip to Furberg, they had just recently returned. “So about the…” Just Noel’s mother was about to speak they heard a voice calling.

Noel turned around slowly and with a graceful smile, she knew it has to be one of the citizens brought here by the guards. Yet when she looked her face turned pale. She immediately spat the tea in her mouth and jumped from her chair.

That white hair and sinister smile, the oppressive feeling she is getting for knowing his power. A man who could take down the castle alone has already infiltrated it.

Her mother stood in surprise, this man resemble the description of the white mage her daughter was talking about. And with her reaction she was certain, it was him.

“Prepare a seat for him, use the tea and sweets we use for his majesty.” Her mother whispered to the maid.

“Are you sure?” The maid asked, those things were reserved for the king.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You have my permission, that man is a problem. And also get someone to clean that.” She pointed toward the tea that Noel spat.

The maid bowed gently and then rushed to her work.

The guard was surprised to see the princess stumble and rush toward them like a horse. He knew she was a knight but she always kept the princess guise on the castle ground.

“What the hell did you do?” The guard looked at Cain, finally smelling the smoke under the hay.

Cain smiled, “I don’t think I ever did something bad, I might have taken care of some undead here and there but nothing more.”

“Taking care of some undead? Please stop joking!” Noel shouted as she got close. “You there, we did warn you about a white-haired man, right?”

“You said a strong, tall, and powerful white-haired man…You don’t mean it’s him?” The guard started realizing the mistake they made. They all expected Cain to be a tall buff man so they let their guard down when they saw him. They were probably expecting someone that looked similar to Cain’s father but with white hair.

“Fine, get back to your post and inform the rest. The white mage is in the castle ground so make sure not to offend him.” With her order, the guard rushed toward the gate to inform the others.

“You look stressed,” Cain said looking at Noel.

“Whose fault it is, you almost gave me a heart attack appearing out of nowhere,” Noel said.

“She is right, we could have prepared a welcome party had you informed us beforehand.” Noel’s mother approached them.

“To be honest, I hate those things, and that’s why I came here directly. I did even consider teleporting right to the king’s room.” Cain said with an exhausted face.

、 The king’s room was the most guarded place in the castle, even the queens can’t get in without the king’s direct permission and a heavy inspection by the king’s personal maids. The reason for that is that one of the queens tried to kill the king once.

If Cain was saying that he can teleport to that room he was making a threat that he can take the king down at any time.

“Please there is no need for that, let’s have a quiet talk here should we?”

With that, Cain walked upstairs with Noel and her mother in tow. Even approaching the royalty was strictly forbidden, Cain wasn’t someone they wanted to annoy or anger.
