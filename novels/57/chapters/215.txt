Morena’s body fell to the ground in a loud crash. Everyone looked at her awaiting to confirm their victory. She had kept moving after her head was severed so she might still move again.

“Did we do it?” Lisa screamed as she saw the massive dragon fall at last. And with that, something started to happen to Morena’s body. Necrotic magic started to seep from her dead body.

Cain in his last moments of consciousness had seen something horrific. The necrotic magic has started to rapidly transform her body.

Morena’s last spell didn’t fail, it was a spell meant to raise her as undead after she died. The only thing that is worse than a dragon, is an undead dragon.

He passed out before he could warn the others, the fight wasn’t over.

Morena’s body jolted with necrotic magic as the acid pulled her head and bone back in. A crackle of necrotic magic burned in her eyes as she stared at them confused.

‘What happened?’ She wondered, the last she can remember was her rushing inside the dungeon to hide from a meteor. What had happened to her?

Even though she was a zombie, her body screamed in pain signaling that her transformation is still uncompleted.

‘Do I want to keep fighting them? No, I need to get somewhere safe.’ Morena immediately flapped her wings and took to the sky. She can’t remember what happened exactly but she knew for a fact that she was killed. She had learned two ninth-level spells one was [Acid Rain] and the second was [What comes after life is death] A spell that can be cast at any time but only activate when the caster dies, turning him into an undead.

The memory loss was probably because her head was severed for some time. But there was one problem, she is lacking Mana and her transformation was incomplete.

The spell was intended to transform her into a Dracolich, but she was instead transformed into a Dracozombie.

“Why are you running?” Takeshi yelled at her, “Come back here!” Sofia flew behind her.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

SLAM! Swinging her tail, Morena sent Sofia back to the ground and flew even further. The only thought on her mind was to stay intact and finish her transformation.

Her transformation was made in a hurry so she didn’t have any MP left. No matter how she looked at it, retreating was the safest option for her.

“Don’t follow her, we didn’t beat her while she was alive so we have no chance when she is an undead!” Alice screamed at them seeing how hard Sofia crushed onto the ground.

“Don’t worry. None of us had the speed to catch her anyway.” Takeshi said kicking a rock across the battlefield in frustration; he had lost his blade with her.

Quickly after that, Dolrig and Mary arrived to warn them but found the battle to be over. The city outskirts have been turned into a wasteland from the fight.

“What had happened here? Did the fight end?” Dolrig screamed looking for them.

“I don’t see Morena, did she run away?” Mary said inspecting the battlefield on horseback.

“Found them, let’s hurry!” Dolrig finally spotted them close to a collapsed structure.

Seeing them coming, Alice quickly shifted back to her human form as she expected more people to come.

After putting Cain in Selena’s hands, she hurried to hide Spindle’s corpse with her cape, he had saved her life and she wanted to at least give him a proper burial. After that healing Sofia enough so she can walk.

Alice being the one who was acting more like an observant explained what happened there, she lied on some parts to hide her and spindle’s identity.

“There something I wanted to ask…” Mary hesitated, she feared to head the bad news. “Gracie the maid, wasn’t she with you?”

Alice smiled, “She was, Cain sent her on a mission to Ourals. He told her clear any obstacle there.”

Mary blinked twice, “What do you mean by an obstacle?”

“The remaining troops, supply line, and Ourals lord,” Alice told her with a straight face and Mary went pale.

“Don’t tell me she killed all Ourals lord’s family?”

“Don’t worry, Cain instructed her to only kill those who lifted a weapon against her and she was also told to capture the eldest daughter alive.”

“Sorry that I’ve been listening but do you think that maid could do such a thing?” Dolrig entered the chat.

Sofia looked toward him with a proud face, “It might not seem like it but, she is the strongest of us. That’s why Cain sent her alone to Ourals.” Pumping her chest up.

“I believe Cain said she was the best match against humans, not the strongest!” Alice corrected her, “The strongest was Selena if I’m right.” She looked toward Selena that was slowly walking behind them.

“I’m hungry; I want some meat-nya.” That was the only thing she was thinking about in that satiation. Her stomach growled, they didn’t eat anything decent in the last week.

All the adventurers and soldiers even some citizens were standing outside the city awaiting their arrival. Their faces grew pale when they saw Cain limp off Selena’s back. He was already weak when he was in the city so they thought he was killed.

“Ah! Don’t worry, this bastard survived!” Dolrig words sent relief, and they all cheered.

William, Leon, and some of their soldiers rushed to check on them. Miko also left her station at the church to check on the outcome.

“It’s our victory, for now, sadly nothing was left from the dungeon,” Alice said with a worried face, when she looked around, she didn’t find any drops. Even the lich’s items seem to have disappeared into thin air.

Both they and the city kind of needed money for repair, having the dungeon drop nothing means they are in big trouble. The people looked at them for a moment to guess if they might have stolen the drops.

“I guess that’s what happens when you drop a meteor on a dungeon, there was nothing that can be done with a dragon there,” Leon said clearing all the doubts from the people.

After that, everyone cheered as Cain was carried to his house, some have even started coming with titles to him and calling him things like the white slayer and the meteor lord.

In the evening, a pigeon arrived at Williams’s mansion with a letter from the capital. The summary was:

The capital has declared war on Ourals for breaking the peace treaty between the cities. The royal knights led by the king’s eldest daughter are on the way to assist Furberg.

In case of the war is won, and depending on the contrition of the parties involved, the title of Ourals lord shall be given to the biggest contributor in taking over the Ourals.

William looked at the letter and busted laughing, the king’s intentions were clear. He wanted his daughter to take this chance and size the title of the Ourals lord for herself.

Sadly, the war ended before they could even arrive, and the most contributor was none other than a maid who singles handily took over Ourals if he believed his daughter’s words. He has to wait so he can confirm if Gracie succeeded.

Cain was still unconscious in his mansion. Leon had assigned multiple men to guard and provide for them while they rest. The next day, Gracie appeared in the middle of the mansion from Sofia’s shadow bearing some news.
