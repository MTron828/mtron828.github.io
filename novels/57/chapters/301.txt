Cain stared at Kayden as the man sheathed his blade, “What has brought you here, I thought you were supposed to be resting.” Cain asked Kayden. The last time he saw him, Kayden was just cut in half.

“I already healed and rested, I was here to stretch some muscles. I wanted to join the pit fight at spring.” Kayden quickly closed four of his eyes and retracted the two arms to appear like a normal human.

“Pit fight? What are you talking about?” Cain asked.

“That old man said one is going to be held in the capital. The winner will get enough money to last him ten years That’s my chance to reopen my dog shop.” Kayden smiled with a saddened expression. The clear longing for his old life glimmered in his eyes.

“You do really like dogs.” Chad smiled as he patted Kayden on the back. When Cain looked at the Gorgon, Chad already snapped its neck. Selena has also finished slaying her prey.

“Raising puppies, feeding them. Slowly training as they grow big. Hunting dogs are trained to follow the scent of blood and resist the urge to eat prey. Guard dogs are trained to recognize faces and how to fight humans, preferably without killing them. Pit dogs on the other hand are trained to be as aggressive as they get, they also get the best food so they can grow big and strong…” Kayden went on to explain his job. Cain stopped him when he started talking about breeding, he didn’t want to hear more about dogs at the moment.

“Okay, okay we understand. Can you help us collect the gorgons?” Cain pointed at the massive pool of blood in front of Kayden.

“This one is mine, I did kill it after all.” Kayden pointed at the gorgon he just killed.

“I expected you to say that. I would be happy if you took it since I don’t have time to butcher more than three anyway.” Cain shook his head. The maids are going to kill him if he brought a whole three gorgons at dusk for them to butcher.

“Then how should I help?” Kayden stared at the corpse in front of him. Cain didn’t expect him to carry one back, right?

“I will lift them and use magic to squeeze them. I want you to slash the artery in their necks to drain the blood.” [Telekinesis] Cain lifted the four of them with ease.

Kayden immediately pulled his sword and took a stance, the goal was to stay clean.

Thud! Kayden swung his blade quickly with a single step and beheaded the gorgons one after the other.

“Ahh! I didn’t tell you to behead them, I wanted you specifically for the job since you can leave the heads…” Cain looked both sad and anxious as he saw the heads fall to the ground.

“Does it matter?” Kayden asked with a puzzled face.

“I did want to make a decoration of their full hide. That also includes the heads. Now I need to sew them nicely so they won’t appear.” Cain poked the severed heads with his finger.

“You take mine if you want,” Kayden suggested.

Cain looked at Kayden’s gorgon. The beast was sliced from head to tail.

“No thanks.” Cain tried to lift one of the heads with [Telekinesis]

“Be careful, that one should still have…” Chad yelled at Cain but it was too late. The green fume quickly engulfed Cain turning him into a stone statue.

“Cain-nya!” Selena cried as she saw Cain fall on his face.

“Don’t worry, he will get back to normal in a couple of minutes.” Chad sighed, it was probably better for Cain to learn a lesson about being careful.

CRACK! Surprisingly, as if he heard him. Cain immediately broke free from the petrification and stood up.

“I need to work on my resistance more, just a second can be lethal.” Said Cain cracking his neck.

“That was quick,” Kayden said with an unimpressed face.

“Even if I was petrified, my mind will keep working so I can use magic as I want. All I did to break free was release enough Mana inside my body to break the petrification.” Cain walked toward another head and lifted it up.

The second head also released what was left of the petrification fume inside its gland.

Cain got turned once again into stone, but this time he didn’t try to break free. Instead, he used [Fly] to start flying and [Message] talk.

Cain’s petrified body flew to the sky and started speaking directly to their minds. “I am the ancient mage…Bow to thy power. All unbent spins shall be fed to the unknown eldritch depth!” Cain talked menacingly as he did in his past life.

“You sound like some sort of evil god, I can totally imagine a cult worshipping a statue that talks like this.” Chad laughed as if he had seen such cults in the past.

“Can you even fight in that shape?” Kayden pulled his sword out. Thud! In the blink of an eye, the demon swordsman flew at Cain.

It was so sudden and unexpected that even chad failed to react. Usually, people release a bit of killing intent or willpower before attacking. It was like a carriage slowly picking up speed. But Kayden was different, his madness prevented such things to be felt by him. One second he is calm and friendly, and the next second he chose violence.

Kayden’s six eyes opened and his extra two arms grabbed his blade for extra strength. Taking a deep breath before attacking, he activated two of his powerful abilities [Demon Blade] [Triple Slash].

Kayden’s blade rumbled as it got engulfed in demonic energy, It wasn’t his best, but enough to test Cain.

[Grasping veins] Multiple plants-like veins grew from the ground and caught Kayden mid-air. Veins grabbed his arms, legs, neck, and torso in the blink of an eye. [Telekinesis] only helped Cain to restrain Kayden further.

[Conjure volley] Hundreds of small daggers appeared in the sky pointing toward the restrained Kayden. “You dare overstep your mortal authority?” Cain growled. Chad barely managed to hold his laugh, he could feel no killing intent from either Kayden or Cain. He was honestly happy to see his son potentially having a friend that isn’t a servant or a wife.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Kayden’s eyes started spinning rapidly as the demonic aura in his body swelled, “Is this all you have? A mere stone that can neither harm nor help.” Kayden said with a smile.

[Demon blade: Ashura’s dance] In addition to Kayden’s first sword, another four blades appeared in his other hands. It only took a second for him to break free and cut the veins that restrained him.

“Hoho, you can even move under my power. How about this?” Cain laughed as he flew higher [Gravity fissure] A line of dark gravitational energy emerged from the petrified Cain toward Kayden.

Thud! Kayden evaded the attack by jumping directly toward Cain at an extreme speed. His whole body was covered with black veins when he reached Cain.

[Demon Blade: Ashura’s style, twelve blades of destruction] The attack was simple yet powerful. With the help of triple slash, Kayden who has four blades was able to reach a maximum of twelve simultaneous slashes. Each one of them was infused with enough demonic energy to make it lethal.

In the face of such a powerful attack, Cain laughed.
