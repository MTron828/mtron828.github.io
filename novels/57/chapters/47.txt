It was past noon when Cain and the girls reached their new house, unsurprisingly it was somewhat run down! It’s probably been years since it was last used.

“What a waste to leave it like this!” Cain said as he looked at how big the house was!

A three-story building with a tiles roof, shaped like a rectangular donut with a hole in the middle! The walls had veins growing and the garden was a mess with overgrown grass.

The stone path leading to the main door gave an ominous feeling with the dead tree standing close to the door, It only missed dusk and crows!

In the middle of the garden, Cain can see one of the workers diligently cleaning it from dead branches and leaves! As he saw Cain and the girls the man responded with a slight bow! Cain just waved his hand as a response.

Cain slowly opened the door, ZZZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! It needs some oil!

“Didn’t I tell you to stay outside, you’re going to stain the floor!” One of the maids came shouting in anger, she looked to be a bit older than can, probably in her mid-twenties.

Her brown hair was tied in a ponytail, sand skin, and sharp black eyes. a distinct more was under her left eye which gave her a special mature look!

The moment her eyes fell on Cain she quickly closed her mouth with her hands, SLAP! She did so hard you could say she slapped her mouth!

She didn’t mean to yell at the housemaster, on top of that his two ‘wives?’ were with him, The lord’s daughter was there as well! Any sane noble will have her severely punished to keep his dignity in front of the City Lord. Even if he didn’t, she was going to get bullied by his wives now! Those are real problems that came with the maid job which made her situation severe!

The maid’s brain ran at full power thinking of a way to get out, apologizing will save her the punishment but increases the likelihood of getting bullied! Staying silent meant taking the punishment and less chance of getting bullied!

She didn’t know what punishment she would get, nor how she would be bullied! One-time extreme damage or a long-term slow burn! Those were the only choices she had!

“Ahh, sorry about that! We will take our shoes here at the door!” Sofia replied, quickly taking her shoe off, followed by the whole group.

“How about asking one of the workers to make a small step at the door! To make it more obvious that you have to take your shoes off!” Alice suggested and Cain thought it will be a good idea.

The maid looked at them dumbfounded, It wasn’t what she expected. Quickly recovering from her shock she bowed to greet them.

“Master Cain, Lady Alice, Lady Sofia, Lady Selena. Welcome home! I apologize for raising my voice at you earlier!” The mistresses don’t seem that bad, I prefer to take my chances with them than face punishment for not apologizing!

“You don’t have to worry about that, I don’t mind you raising your voice as long as it’s constructive! If I were to say, right now there is only one thing that I might snap at you for!” Cain said smiling as he faced the maid.

“Might I ask what is that thing?” The maid asked nervously, she has to listen well!

“I and the girls are going to have private rooms, If any one of you entered those rooms without direct permission from me or the room owner.” Cain’s voice changed, he was stressing his words in a manner that made the maid think he was angry!

“Don’t blame me for wiping the floor with you!” The maid’s face was pale as she wasn’t able to utter a single word.

“The lightest punishment, if you saw nothing, It’s going to be torture! To make an example of whoever did it!” Cain took a single heavy step.

“If you happened to see something you’re not supposed to… you have to choose between death or enslavement to make sure you don’t speak!”

He simply can’t let them see Alice in her devil form or Sofia practicing witchcraft in the future! He and Selena didn’t have much to hide, but he added them as well!

Cain even intended that if a Maid entered his or Selena’s room without permission he might just give them a scare!

“I will make sure to remember that, I hope to be up to you’re expectations!” The Maid replied with a deep bow, making sure she doesn’t raise her voice again in front of them just in case!

“I will go meet the head butler, you girls go with the maid and chose your rooms!” Cain said as he went inside to look for the office, there should be one somewhere!

“What you’re name? We haven’t introduced ourselves yet!” Sofia was the one to speak first!

“Excuse my rudeness, my name is Elsie Kinger. I already know your names as it is my duty!” She replied with a slight bow.

“You had a really deep roar, do you scream a lot-nya?” Selena asked, confusing Elsie about what she meant by a roar for a moment!

Immediately bowing again, “I once again apologize for raising my voice at you!” Even if Cain didn’t mind it didn’t apply to his wives! Is she angry about it! She got scared again.

Sofia was able to notice her fear, quickly giving her much-needed encouragement! “She was praising you, we won’t get angry at you for that! Have more confidence!”

“Elsie, Can you lead us to where the rooms are?” Alice asked of her gently, they were about to proceed smoothly.

SCRATCH! Selena who was walking barefoot mistakenly took her claw out and scratched the wooden floor.

“WE JUST CLEANED THAT!” Elsie screamed at Selena, scaring her off! To the point, her tail extended the limit!

“HUSHAAAAAAAAA!” Selena hissed at Elsie’s sudden scream, scaring her as well!

Quickly realizing what she had done, Elsie quickly smashed her head on the ground apologizing to Selena, “I beg for your forgiveness! I swear I didn’t mean it!”

‘This is going to be rough!’ Both Alice and Sofia thought!

…

Cain was walking in the corridor searching for the office when he spotted a maid with long black hair cleaning the painting from dust.

“Hello, did you see the butler?” Cain asked trying to sound friendly.

The maid stopped what she was doing, and turned to him with a blank face, not a single expression on it!Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Her eyes were coal-black just like her eyes, and her face was as white as the pure snow!

“Sebastian is in the office.” She said and turned back to her work.

Cain looked at her in surprise, ‘I did only where he was but…What?’

“I want to know where is the office, I need to meet him!”

The maid stopped working once again and turned back.

“Besides the counting room!” She then returned to her work again, still no expression.

“Would you mind leading me there?” Cain asked as she didn’t seem to give him a real answer!

She once again stopped working and started walking away without saying anything.

“Where are you going?” Cain was surprised to see her walk away like that.

“Leading you to the office!” She stopped to say that before continuing to walk.

Cain decided to follow her even though she was acting strange, ‘I feel like I’m talking to a golem!’

“My name is Cain, What is yours?” Cain asked trying to start a conversation.

“Gracie Gray.” she didn’t say another word, making Cain feel confused even.

‘This is going to be rough!’ He thought.
