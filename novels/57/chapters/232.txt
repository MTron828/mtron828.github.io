A large white Carriage drawn by four horses was waiting outside. Kayden and Lily stood by its side waiting. The air was freezing, winter still have not ended.

Click! Lily noticed Kayden Grabbing his sword. She stared at his face and asked, “Is there a problem?”

“Her.” Kaden pointed with his nose at the woman approaching them. When Lily looked, it was Cain and the girls. Yet, an unknown woman was walking beside them.

“Who is she?” Lily asked. She feared that the woman might hurt them. Kayden’s answer only helped to increase her anxiety as he answered. “Morena’s sister.”

Life drained from Lily’s face, she imagined Zaleria clashing against Kayden.

“Are you ready?” Said Cain with a smile. “She is coming with us, treat her well.” He added. It was better to introduce her before a misunderstanding could happen.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Is she safe?” Kayden asked.

“She is. I promise you she won’t bite.” Said Cain. Zaleria poked him as she heard that.

Kayden smiled. If Cain said she was safe, then she is safe. If she wanted to attack, she would have done it already.

“To think you’re working with this demon. You know how to gather interesting people.” Zaleria said as she patted Kayden on the head. The demon swordsman did not take a liking to that so he slashed at her hand.

Clang! His blade bounced from her bare forearm. She quickly followed with a second gentle pat. Kayden immediately pulled back and slashed again at her. She took the hit and was unscathed.

Cain looked at them smiling. Zaleria had 30 strengths. Her muscles and bones are harder than most common metals. “Stop that. I don’t fancy being patted by someone like you.” Kayden growled at her. Gripping his sword tightly, he swung again.

[Lisworth’s resilient sphere] Cain trapped him immediately. “Can you calm down? This should be enough proof for you that she won’t attack.” Said Cain. The girl looked at them with worried faces. It was always nerve-wracking when the strongest three are fighting amongst themselves.

“If you say so,” Kayden said as he sheathed his sword. “We shouldn’t waste more time fighting like this.” He quickly jumped into the carriage. Followed by the scared Lily. Cain looked at her. She was the weakest.

‘A level one, she must have been dragged into all of this.’ He though.

Cain then jumped inside and the girls followed him. A whole week’s journey was awaiting them before they could reach Selena’s village.

They traveled through the day and rested through the night. Cain conjured a Lisworth tower for Kayden and Lily to spend the night in while he spent the night in a more fancy creation.

The seventh-tier spell [Lisworth’s Magnificent Mansion] created a door that led to an extradimensional mansion. Cain created it in his past life when the elves mocked him for erecting a big long stick in the middle of their kingdom.

Cain created the spell purely to flex on them. No sane mage would waste his Mana on such a thing except him.

“You really used a seventh-tier spell for this?” Zaleria said in disgust as she saw the door appear out of nowhere. Even to a dragon. Seventh-tier magic was not supposed to be used like this.

“Yep, do you have a problem with that?” Cain replied with a stern face. Her expression reminded him of how the elves looked at him when he created this spell. He was an enchanter so creating spells was not that complicated for him. All he needed to do was link multiple spells and it was done.

“I c-can take your c-coat.” A ghastly voice spoke beside Sofia. “Ah, thank you.” She handed him her coat. Suddenly, she froze in place at the realization. To whom does this voice belong?

When she slowly turned her face to face him. The figure of a transparent woman stood by her side smiling. With a second look, the entire mansion was full of them.

“Ah, before I forget. This place has a squad of ghost servants. Please treat them well.” Cain said as if he had forgotten. He intentionally omitted that to see their reaction. Zaleria was intrigued, Alice greeted them nicely, and Selena started poking them while Sofia screamed in fear. Gracie didn’t react at all and ignored them.

“I was hoping you would be a bit more surprised. To tell you the truth, they aren’t real ghosts. They are just Mana golems created with the mansion. I made them look like ghosts as a prank.” Said Cain smiling.

Ghosts are the souls of dead people being bound to the mortal world and unable to pass on. Mana golems are just ghost-like creatures created by magic, just a hazy mist of magic that resembled a humanoid creature and could carry out basic tasks (Moving light things, lighting candles, opening doors, and wiping dust…).

After showing the girls around the mansion. Cain left them to rest and headed into his maze. His destination was Olivia’s lab.

Inside the lab, he found her still making potions. “You returned?” Said Olivia.

“I didn’t, we’re still going. I just wanted to do some experiments.” Said Cain and took one of the tables to work on.

The goal was clear. Experimenting with himself to find more about the high human and if it is possible to mix it with the abomination. Cain wanted to evolve as fast as possible.

‘I can’t take the feeling of wasting exp.’ He though. Now that he reached the max level, all the exp he would gain is wasted until he evolves.

Cain spent about an hour experimenting on his blood and reached a simple conclusion.

High humans to the human race are like the high elves to the elvish race. The same but having more affinity to magic and a longer lifespan. With how much magic was in his blood, he concluded that if he were to evolve into a high human, his life span would double. From 60~80 years to about 120~160 years.

Yet that alone was not enough to surpass the benefits of an abomination.

This had taken all the time Cain had that night so he returned to the mansion quickly. The girls were waiting for him so they can sleep.

The next six days went the same. Traveling through the day, experimenting through the night. Selena had also mentioned how they are looking more like an actual pride.

Cain was spending most of his day sitting when a monster appeared or they needed to hunt for food. He will just send the girls and do nothing.

Even though it looked as if he was lazing around. In truth, he just didn’t want to waste the monsters’ exp and left the girls to take it.

On the second day, he discovered that the high human blood came from his mother’s side and not his father’s. This was unexpected as he knew about his father being blessed but know nothing about his mother having any special abilities.

On the third day, he discovered that becoming a high human would give him innate magical powers and make him a sorcerer.

On the fourth day, he discovered that there is a possibility of mixing the abomination and high human. He decided to research that more.

On the fifth day, he discovered that becoming a high human would prevent him from having children with regular humans. His little swimmer would refuse any lowly human egg if he evolved. However, luckily for him, all the girls had some special blood in them. Alice was a devil, Selena a jaguar, Sofia a dragon, and Gracie a succubus.

On the sixth day, he discovered that his mother should have been a high human. This meant that his father’s genes were so powerful, that they concurred with the arrogant high human genes.

On the seventh day, he tried to force his flesh to evolve into that of a high human by enchanting it with magic. He was successful. In the same way a human could evolve into a demon when exposed to an extreme amount of cursed magic. Cain found a special magic wave that could force him to evolve into a high human.

With that, he should be able to evolve into a high human with magical means and then evolve naturally into an abomination. This would result in him becoming a high abomination. He decided to try that after they finished their business at Selena’s village.

They finally reached their destination. The first one to realize that was Selena when she smelled her people. “We’re in the village’s hunting ground-nya.” She said.

Unlike how she always sits at the top of the carriage. Now she jumped down to walk and started looking around. Black Jaguars were ambush predators. It won’t be strange if they attacked them.

Thud! A massive Black body fell from a tread ahead of them scaring the horses to a halt. The man stood at a bit more than 7 feet tall. His fur-coated body was wider than what Cain thought was humanly possible. The man’s head was that of a cat.

Kayden immediately pulled his sword. “Wait, don’t attack him!” Cain yelled. That man was a black Jaguar. It would be bad if Kayden killed one of Selena’s people.

Selena immediately jumped to stand at the front. The man slowly approached her with an intimidating air.
