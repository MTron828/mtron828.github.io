Klara brought Cain some bread and salad left from lunch and heated him some soup as well. He wolfed everything down in seconds and stood up.

‘Let’s return to the basic, increase intelligence by 2’

Intelligence: 26=>28

‘And now is the time to start abusing my enchanting system, this is where it all starts.’

Soul fragment: 120

[Increase Mana regeneration]: consume one soul fragment to increase PMR by 1, AMR by 2, and SMR by 3 permanently.

‘I do have 4032 MP. I can regenerate it passively in 6 hours and 43.2 min. 3 hours and 21.6 min if I tried actively and 2 hours and 14.4 min while sleeping. Now, what will happen in I used 90 soul fragments to increase my Mana regeneration?’

It will take this<(Passive Mana regeneration)PMR: 10/min><(Active Mana regeneration)AMR: 20/min><(Sleeping Mana regeneration)SMR: 30/min> to this <(Passive Mana regeneration)PMR: 100/min><(Active Mana regeneration)AMR: 200/min><(Sleeping Mana regeneration)SMR: 300/min> Ten times as much which take my regeneration time way beyond what an enchanted item could give.

‘Now I can regenerate it passively in 40 min and 19.2 seconds and 20 min and 9 seconds if I tried actively and 13 min and 26 seconds while sleeping. This is what I call power, master always hated the system being used to spy on us. But to me, let Mystra watch, I will just use it to my benefit.’ Cain stood up with a smile, he still had 30 soul fragments left.

“I’m heading to my room, don’t disturb me until dinner. If any emergency happened have the other deal with it.” Cain told Klara who slowly walked toward him.

“Is there a problem?” she could feel that something was off about Cain, he would usually look for the ladies or just find something to do.

“I’ve been wasting a lot of time lately, I’m going to create some magic in my room so it will be dangerous,” Cain replied with his usual smile.

“Won’t it be better to do it in the maze then?”

Cain was surprised to hear her say something that actually made sense from a magical perspective. He had to sit back and giggle as if his master heard her, she will be thrilled. “You’re absolutely right, but I do need to stay in this world, to keep the city under surveillance in case of a sudden attack.”

“A sudden attack? Do you think that another dragon would attack?” She gave him a face mixed with confusion and fear.

“I don’t think, I know they will. They are relentless.” Cain replied with a serious face.

And without saying another word, he left for his room and locked the door.

He took a deep breath, looking around, the room was warm and clean. Sitting on his bed, he could feel the exhaustion finally catching up to him.

“Mei, come here.” Without wasting a second, he called Mei.

Poff! She appeared out of nowhere in a puff of smoke, she stared at Cain. “What is it? You haven’t called me in while.” She pouted.

“I’m going to lay an elvish barrier around the city, need your help to lay the circles,” Cain said immediately.

“That would need me to send a lot of people around the city to draw them, what do you intend on paying me with?” She stared at him with a playful smile. Taking two deep whiffs as if smelling him.

“Don’t want to work? Fine I will ask Spindle.” Cain lifted his finger about to dismiss her.

“Ah! Please stop I will do it, I was joking, joking!” she cried. For some reason, Mana was oozing from Cain’s body, and it had an intoxicating smell to it. She just said that trying to get some of it.

“Well then, sit here and call the others. The barrier is going to be a prismatic dome that only activates when needed.” He sat cross-legged on the bed and Mei jumped on his head.

Just sitting on his head made her legs shiver, the concentration, the purity, and the flow. Cain’s mana felt like fresh honey.

“I did tell them to spread around the city, they are awaiting the orders.” She said looking down at Cain.

“I thought you would call them here?” Cain asked rising an eyebrow.

“I can’t let them get here, they will lose it.” She replied.

“Lose what?” Cain asked.

“Once before, I mistakenly gave them your mana without diluting and processing it. And it was bad, you could see some of them wriggling in the ground as if in a trance, for days they just kept begging for more.” She remembered the mess.

“Was it that bad?”

“Your mana should be illegal to pixies, they were licking the ground looking for more. Till now, some of the mana still circulate between them at high prices.”

Cain was giving them Mana through the maze, Mei is the one responsible for receiving and distributing it to the pixies to eat and use for building and training. It was like nectar to bees.

The problem is that Pixies can easily get addicted to it. Mana is slightly toxic to them. But Cain’s mana was too dense and pure, to them, it was like drugs.

“Even I need to be careful when handling it. Diluting and changing the flavor are the two things I usually do to make it usable.” Mei said with a sad face.

“I can change the nature of the mana directly before giving it to you, which should solve the problem,” Cain suggested.

“How could I get my fix then? Don’t change anything, and don’t give it to other pixies. It will be bad if the queen heard of it.” Mei cried pulling in his hair.

“The queen? Titania?”

“You know her?”

“No, just the title. Never met or talked to her before.”

“Then listen, that woman is all over mana. She uses the entire pixie society to get her hand on the most exotic and powerful types of mana. She would kill to get your mana.” Mei said menacingly.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Don’t worry, I won’t be giving random pixies my mana. For now, let’s focus on the barrier!” Cain started explaining the magic formula to Mei and she relayed it to the others.

After having tens of inscriptions scattered around the city, Cain clapped his hand. “If my mana is bad for you. Leaving now is your last chance, this is going to be several denser than what I give you.”

Mein floated from his head to the ground, “I will stay, I can’t let this…I mean help you if you need.”

Cain closed his eyes, sending multiple [Arcane Eye] to the inscription as he started getting ready.

Unlike the usual cast of [Prismatic dome], this one was a bit harder because it will be automatic and has multiple charges. It would also notify Cain if activated, alarm the whole city and zap the attacker with elemental energy.

“See…this isn’t so bad,” Mei said as she felt him cast [Arcane eye] but as soon as he started creating the [Prismatic dome] the fine hair on her body stood.

“Hold up…” she tried to run away but couldn’t, her magic didn’t want to work. Her legs started shaking as a warm sensation washed through her body. She tried to resist but her sanity slowly drained away as her mind took a dive into Cain’s mana.

She fell on the ground giggling, a massive smile on her face as she started leaking like she was punched drunk.
