Gracie smiled, "Everything," CRACK! The tentacles wrapped her body, pulling her inside the stomach.

Cain slowly glared at the two succubus maids, his face crackling with magic, seeming like an octopus to them.Upstodatee from n(0)/vùíÜ/lbIn/.(co/m

EH! The two maids gasped, throwing up the moment they sensed the pressure of his magic flowing. Thud! Cain started walking toward them, "I can't blame you, can I?" He glared at them.

[WHO IS YOUR GOD?] His voice rumbled in souls, causing their minds to shut down immediately. The two fell on their faces, seemingly dead.

Cain flicked his finger, and the two woke up. [I ASK AGAIN, WHO IS YOUR GOD?]

~You~

~You~

The two maids couldn't even open their mouths. Cain only heard the terrorized weeping inside their heads.

[YOUR LAST CHANCE! WHO IS YOUR GOD]

In the last moments, before their souls get snuffed by Cain's blazing divine existence, the last thought on their minds was a single word. ~Her~

***

Outside, the cubus of the fortress walked across the building, scrambling to prepare everything that Cain ordered.

"I should go inform him that everything will be ready soon," The succubus who first met Cain said.

"Yeah, it will be bad if got impatience." another succubus said.

"Yeah..." CRACK! Pain rushed across her bones as she fell to her knees. When she looked around, everyone was suffering the same. SPLAT! Tentacles rose from the ground and crawled from the windows, manifesting eyes that stared directed at the succubi, [WHO IS YOUR GOD?]

"What...GRWAAA!" The moment one of them tried to speak anything but answer, her eyes bled, and she fell on her face. The tentacles quickly devoured the corpse as she resurrected again, [WHO IS YOUR GOD] And they asked again.

CRACK! The entire city rumbled as Cain's tentacles covered the whole place, questioning every living being while sending the answer to their brain.

***

In the succubus kingdom in the abyss, the tentacles fell from the sky and rose from the ground, glaring at the resident. [WHO IS YOUR GOD]. But unlike the rest, they felt no pain or pressure and looked at the tentacles with smiles. They already knew the answer.

***

In the abyss wasteland, a war blazed. Demons clashed with each other, trampling everything in their wake.

CRACK! The war stopped as the tentacles emerged, tieing everyone. The moon Onis, who took the frontline, froze, glaring at the tentacles as they sensed an aura they knew.

Their priestesses faced the tentacles, [Who is your god?] They looked at the tentacles for a moment before their head priestess approached, "Klai, now begone you monster,"

[Ha,] The tentacle sighed.

[Cain! Use her till she dies! And all the priestesses here!] Kali shouted through the church walls, [You know that's bad] Cain replied.

[That's the only way they understand.] Kali growled.

Before long, all the were on the ground, praying, "Kali spoke!" they mumbled, "Oh! Our maker, please have mercy on us."

[Hey, Kali. Can't you take them back? It's getting complicated now that I have a domain to create.]

[I can't help it! They betrayed father once,]

[It's already hard enough to protect them once from a wrong answer. Either accept them, or all of them will die here.]

[Fine, but I have conditions.] Kali said, her voice shooking the priestesses, [Do as he says. And one day, I might take you back to my domain.]

The priestesses stared at each other, confused, "But when?" One of them mumbled.

[When I feel like it. It is my last order for you. Worship what Cain brought you until I feel like taking you back.]

"Is this a test?" The head priestess lifted her head, praying.

[Cain, can you lend me some of your power?]

[Fine,]

One of Cain's tentacles fell apart, appearing like a four-armed little girl with pink hair. Thud! Kali walked to the head priestess, grabbing her by the face.

"This is the last time I ask," Kali growled, "I have more pressing matters to deal with, so give me the answer I want to hear, and I will be happy with you. Give the wrong answer, and we can say goodbye."

The priestess stared at her, crying. "Why do you reject us?"

"Father would have resurrected into believed in him for another day. He died because you betrayed him to Talos," Kali growled, smashing the priestess's head in her palm.

[You didn't tell me he could have survived.]

Kali looked at Cain's tentacles, "Yeah," She sighed, glaring at the priestess's corpse, and it sprung back to life, "Who is your god?"

The priestess stared at the ground, "Fine,"

After getting the answer he desired, Cain was about to disappear when the head priestess caught one of his tentacles, "Can we have one rude request?" she looked at him with dead eyes.

[What is it?]

"Will you allow us to worship Kali for a day?"

"I won't allow it," Kali shouted in the back.

Cain sighed, [You can do it,]

"I said I won't allow it," Kali glared at him, but Cain returned the glare, "Fine, just one day." Kali looked down. She couldn't refuse if it was Cain.

The priestess finally had some light in their eyes.

[Hey, Kali,]

"What do you want?"

[You don't have an avatar, right? You also don't have enough divine energy to create your own angels.]

"Why do you care?"

[I will give you that body and enough divine energy to create a hundred angels if you accept their prayer one day a week.]

"And what do you gain?"

[Their obedience.] Cain replied, glaring at the priestesses, [I can treat you however I like when I come here, and you must completely obey my orders.]

The head priestess went on the fool, "As your order,"

Kali sighed, "Fine, I only have benefits to gain,"

Cain then disappeared.

King Baltos was in bed with the first queen, the high pope of the kingdom. Doing their business when a tentacle emerged from the ceiling, [WHO IS...OH]

Baltos turned around, swinging a punch at the tentacles. "What are you?"

[Baltos, hold a moment, It's me, Cain.]

"Doesn't matter!" Baltos grabbed the tentacles, squeezing them in his fists.

[I need to ask her a question,]

"You dare speak?" Baltos growled.

"Dear, at least hear what he has to say." The first queen sat up, covering herself with the blanket.

Baltos glared at the tentacle, "Speak,"

[Glasya has fallen. I'm here to get confirmation from everyone about the birth of a new goddess.] The tentacle explained.

The first queen smiled, "How did you know?"

[You have a daughter, remember? Glasya is the only god who doesn't require his followers' virginity to get higher in the holy ranking,]

The queen smiled, patting Baltos on the back, "Dear, sit down." She smiled, "The pope of Chauntea's church is worshipping Glasya. Did that surprise you?"

[Not at all. I bet it was proposed by Chauntea the first time.]

The queen smiled, "The kingdom faced a low birth rate problem in the past. Chauntea made a deal with Glasya to solve the problem. It was for me to become the pope," The queen laid on the bed, "Albite I perform Chantea's ritual, my belief lay with Glasya."

[Glasya is no more a god, you know that?]

"Yes, I couldn't use holy magic for a while. Are you the new god?" She smiled. "Sorry, but I only sleep with Baltos here."

[Haha! I can have fun with Sara. I'm not the new god.]

[You know her. Glasya's should have heard her name in their soul by now.]

She smiled, "I know her,"

In Furberg, Lisa was taking a bath and relaxing inside the tub, and a tentacle emerged from the hot water between her legs. [WHO IS...AW!] Before Cain could finish speaking, she stabbed the eye on the tentacle tip.

"A monster?"

[This is me, Cain.] Cain growled, removing the knife and healing his eye, [AW!] She immediately stabbed him again.

[Fine. Since you're a succubus, I came to ask you. Who is your god?]

Lisa stopped momentarily, staring at the tentacle, "Since when did you know?"

[For a while now,]

"Glasya?"

[Think again, it has changed,]

"What? Is this a divinity trial? Shouldn't I be dead or cast into hell if I'm wrong?" Lisa pulled her knife from Cain's eyes and sat on the tub.

[That's right, but I'm pulling some strings for you. Keep guessing,]

Lisa started thinking, and it quickly sparked in her head, "Gracie? Is she the new goddess?"

[That's right. Thanks, I will be going now,] The tentacle disappeared, and Lisa fell on her back. "Gracie." She sighed, looking at the ceiling, "You have changed," She smiled.

Cain opened his eyes, approaching the cocoon where Gracie was having her fun. "Sorry, Gracie. But this is going to hurt like hell."

"What did you say?"

Sofia approached him.

"I got everyone to accept her as a goddess. Now I need to transform her body into a goddess." Cain replied, "The only problem is that I can't describe the process by any words other than torture. Her body will break down into bones and get reconstructed."

"You should tell her first," Alice approached him, "Or at least use something to ease her pain,"

"There is nothing that could affect the process. It's better if Gracie didn't know of the pain to come. It will only last about a minute." Cain lifted his hands, and Eilistraee emerged from his back, "She wanted to take the role," she said with a smile before quickly disappearing.

Cain clenched his fists, and Gracie's muffled moans turned into a painful scream. After a minute, she went silent, and her aura disappeared momentarily.

The cocoon opened, but it was empty. "Where did Gracie go?" Sofia gasped.

Cain fell to the ground, exhausted, and pointed up, "She is surveying her domain."

Thud! On the highest point of the fortress, a naked woman stomped on the battlements, glaring down at Malbolge.
