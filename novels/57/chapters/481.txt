As Amaya kept going around asking for advice, she ended up in front of Olivia.

“Is that the case? Can I get some of their tails for experiments?” Olivia said with a smile. Cain had once shown her an amazing recipe, she was hoping to try it for herself.

“I did remember you talking about that before, but, I prefer to keep them healthy until Master gets back.” Amaya refused respectfully.

After asking almost everyone, She came to the conclusion that keeping them was the best idea.

…

Back in hell, Jella had finished her bath. Inside the changing room, she found the clothes left for her by Gracie.

“What am I doing?” She pondered to herself.

“Getting a freeway out of hell, not many people get this so at least look normal.” Farryn walked behind her.

“What could you know?” Jella glared at her.

Zaleria walked in “It doesn’t matter what she knows, what matter is what you are living.” Glaring at her, “Your life outside hell will be better than inside and that’s what matters.”

“Yeah sure, don’t even know what to expect from that white-haired guy beside him being strong.” Jella started wearing her clothes.

Farryn started wearing her clothes. “Neither do I know, my job was to assist him and I’m doing just that.”

“He is a good guy, stupid at times and cleaver at others. Sometimes I feel weird around him.” Zaleria said thinking.

“Weird like what? Want to make a move at your granddaughter’s husband?” Jella mocked her.

“That’s another matter. What I meant is that I sometimes feel that some of his decisions and actions don’t make sense, as if he’s a different person.” Zaleria looked worried.

Farryn giggled, “Like what? He’s being manipulated? Forget it with how robust his mental wall is, believe me, I tried.” As if out of nowhere, Farryn admitted to having tried mind-controlling Cain before.

“Like today, when he simply agreed on taking us all underground. Was that necessary? He risked Ellie and Mary, and would he really need us all with him?” Zaleria sat on the wooden bench. “It’s like a weird itch that I can’t seem to scratch. Ever since I met him, I keep getting his strange feeling.”

“Then you’re the one going crazy.” Jella stared at her.

“Maybe, but I’m most likely wrong.” She smiled.

Outside the bath, Alice was sitting with Selena and Sofia, and Mary discussing how they should tackle what is to come next. Thanks to this hell expedition, their time with Cain has taken a significant hit.

“We do have to address this problem, we are many,” Alice said, “Too many to have a comfortable time with Cain.”

“You’re right, it’s getting out of hand and we can’t exactly do what we want,” Sofia added. “Ellie isn’t a problem. But Farryn, grandmother, Nemmoxon, and Hati are. We can’t go all out with Cain with them around.”

“I won’t mind-nya, but Cain might-nya,” Selena said with a sad face.

“Where is the problem? They have been with us for a long enough time right?” Mary said with a passive face.

“What do you mean?” Alice stared at her.

“Heard of the king’s queen’s policy and how it’s constructed?” Mary looked at them and both Sofia and Alice nodded.

“Cain one talked about it, do you want to apply that to us?” Sofia said with a confused face.

“Exactly, it will help us keep things organized and work at all times. But it will create disparity among us as a side effect. We will have to take numbers and respect them.” Mary said.

“Cain wouldn’t like that, he likes to see us on equal ground,” Alice said with a worried face. She was almost certain that Cain would refuse the idea of his wives being ranked.

“I can get the idea to his head. At this point, it’s a necessity for management.” Mary said with a serious face. “Sofia, you’re the first wife and make the final decision below Cain. Follows you are Selena and then Alice. Then Gracie, Marina, and lastly me.”

“Mary is the last-nya, why would you ask us to make this then-nya?”

“See? Even Selena thinks it’s weird that you’re asking us to implement something with will give you the least benefits.” Alice glared at Mary, she could feel that something was up with her.

“That’s simply because I don’t care about my benefits, I only want this family to prosper.

“Fine, let’s say we implemented it and I’m the first. What could I do to make sure we’re all in order?” Sofia asked.

“Manage funds, nights, punish mistakes and consult with Cain. We could also cooperate to get tasks done efficiently. Simply that means you’re out the leader in the case of Cain’s absence.” Mary took a stop to breathe before finishing.

“Let’s take out the current condition, since we’re separate like this, it’s hard to come up with the collective decision of asking Cain to separate our room from Zaleria, Hati, Nemmoxon, Farryn, and now Jella. But with you as a leader, you can make the suggestion to us, and well agree and discuss it.”

The girls quickly reached a conclusion, they are going to implant the ranking temporarily until they can get Marina’s input as well.

For the time being, Sofia was the leader with the deciding word.

“I will bring it up to Cain, if he didn’t like it’s your mistake,” Sofia said glaring at Mary.

As per that, Sofia headed toward Cain’s room to inform him of the change.

After knocking on the door, Cain permitted her entry.

She found Gracie has just finished her meal and was cleaning Cain off. “Have time? I know you might be exhausted…”

Cain smiled, “No, what it is?”

Sofia went on to repeat what she has just discussed with the others. Stressing the fact it was all just experimental and temporary.

A while later.

Gracie didn’t seem to mind such a thing but Cain made a thinking face for a while.

“Go call the others as well, I do want to try something,” Cain said with a passive face.

Sofia immediately left to call the other.

“What do you want to try?” Gracie asked.

“Test if they will snap at each other, such a system can really break everything if not set correctly.” He replied stretching his arms and looking at the ceiling.

After a while, all the girls gathered. Sofia, Selena, Alice, Gracie, and Mary.

“So you want to implement such a ranking?” He asked facing them.

They all nodded in unison.

“I will give you a few questions, depending on your answers I can determine whether I let you or not,” Cain said standing up.

“First question is an important one. With that ranking, I’m the sole decision maker, not the first wife. Even if she got approval from all the wives, she would still need my approval. You fine with that?”

“Well of course that’s the case,” Alice replied and all the girls agreed with her.

“Second question. Let’s say I asked one of you to do something atrocious, who is willing to go through with it?” He glared at them.

They accepted, saying they will do anything if it doesn’t cause problems later on.

And then Cain asked the question they all hated to hear.

“In case one of you did a horrible mistake, what punishment would you implant?”
