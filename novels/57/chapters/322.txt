CRACKLE! With a flash of red flames, Zaleria transformed into her draconic form. She grabbed Chad in her mouth as fast as she could and flew away.

“Hey, let me down!” Chad kicked one of her teeth.

Zaleria only slightly opened her teeth for Chad to look toward the sky. A giant meteor was falling, and Cain was intending to kill both of them.

~It’s lucky I shifted us here. We are all trapped here for the next hour so we better wake him up before that~ Zaleria told Chad with [Message]

“What is happening to him?” Chad yelled.

~As if I would know. I did use [Planeshift] to trap him here with us but I was wrong. We’re trapped here with him, that thing isn’t Cain~

“What do you mean?”

~His magic is all jumbled up into utter chaos, he reminds of the barbarian’s berserker state but it is for magic~

Zaleria could sense Cain absorbing and releasing Mana from the air with each heartbeat, and he had three hearts. She couldn’t believe he hadn’t exploded yet.

In the last moment before the impact, Zaleria turned to face the impact location and curled into a ball. Using her wing, arms, and legs to protect her torso and head. She even added [Fire Shield]

Even Chad prepared his [Heal] in case Zaleria got badly wounded.

The meteor crushed down, and Zaleria wasn’t hurt by the extreme heat. She instead suffered from the shockwave and flying debris that left holes in her wings and arms. With Chad’s [Heal] she was back at her feet immediately.

“Let’s get him, he must need to rest after such a big attack!” Chad yelled as he opened Zaleria’s mouth to fly toward Cain. He immediately hide back in as he saw it, a second Meteor was falling down from the sky.

~The bastard is spamming ninth-tier, mages would pull their hair out if they saw this~ Zaleria spat Chad out and used one of the enchantments that Cain gave her to instantly charge her breath.

“Take this!” Zaleria roared, she needed to cripple him before he could cast a third meteor as she has noticed that Cain used the time they were running to charge the spell.

Cain stopped the preparation from the third meteor and cast a small prismatic shield on himself.

Seeing that, Zaleria took Chad in her mouth and braced herself again. She didn’t care if her mouth was as hot as an oven, Chad had to deal with it.

The second meteor impacted and just like the first time, Chad healed what injuries she got.

This time there was no third meteor falling from the sky so Chad flew directly toward Cain. “Wake up!” He went in with a straight punch, Chad didn’t want to pull his sword against Cain.

Chad’s fist stopped right before it touched Cain’s face. He was stuck in [Telekinesis] trap. “You can even stop me?” Chad growled. He did count that all the propulsion he had while mid-air was coming from the spell [Fly] and not his raw strength.

[Synaptic Static] Cain gently lifted his palm toward Chad and tried to deliver an instant kill. Chad felt his head tearing apart in pain, his entire body felt a sharp stinging pain and his vision blurred. Cain did something to his nervous system.

THUD! Zaleria blitzed toward them in her half-dragon form and cut Cain’s hand with a powerful chop.

[Destructive wave: Reverse Gravity] A gravitational wave pulsed from Cain’s body blowing both Chad and Zaleria away. Its power was extremely it didn’t seem like the destructive wave spell that Zaleria knew.

Cain’s severed hand got teleported back to him in an instant. Threads of magic reattached it back as [Lesser Healing] started slowly healing it.

Chad quickly regained his composure, a spell like that won’t keep him down for long. “You really did it! Which kind of kids hits their father like this?” Chad flew toward Cain at top speed.

“You idiot, he is dangerous don’t charge like that!” Zaleria yelled as she flew behind him.

Cain suddenly disappeared. They couldn’t even feel his presence, there is no way he got out of the plane, right? They were locked in this place for an hour.

As Zaleria thought that, she felt something grab her wings. She instantly turned with a strike as only Cain could sneak up on her like that.

As if immediately, [Psychic Scream] Cain blasted her mind with a powerful mental attack.

‘He knows that we are superior to him in physical might so he is going after our minds.’ Chad realized what Cain was doing.

Chad rushed and grabbed Cain from his hair and threw him toward the ground.

Cain immediately stabilized himself to just get kicked by his father to the ground.

Chad landed just beside Cain, walking slowly “Get up, you need a beating!” Chad growled.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Cain looked at Chad, his pupil spinning around like crazy. CRACKLE! Two shadow daggers appeared in Cain’s hands as he took a stance.

Suddenly everything went black, Chad could neither feel, see, or hear anything. That only lasted until he felt a stab to his side, Cain was going for the liver.

Chad clenched his muscles and trapped Cain’s blade in. That was only possible with the massive difference in strength between them.

SLAP! Chad slapped Cain as hard as he could, he wished that it will be enough to wake him up. The blade that was stuck suddenly disappeared and Cain conjured a second one, immediately going back into the darkness.

Chad then felt another stab at his right kidney, “Stop this!” Chad yelled as he decided to spend what little MP he has [Anti-magic Field] [Crown of Stars]

A pulse of negative magic deleted all of Cain’s darkness and seven bright orbs of light started floating on top of Chad’s head.

Each one of those stars glowed bright and flew toward Cain at lightning speed.

Cain ended with seven holes in his torso, but that didn’t last long. [Regenerate] Those holes immediately closed as if they never existed.

CRASH! Zaleria landed between Chad and Cain, quickly opening and swinging a fist at Cain.

BAM! All of her fingers exploded, Cain, detonated the enchantments he gave to her before. Zaleria felt lucky he still haven’t engraved tattoos on her body otherwise this would have been where she dies.

Gritting her teeth, Zaleria punched Cain with her finger-less fist sending him rolling. Using her tail, she picked an MP potion from her pocket and threw it at Chad.

The two of them couldn’t handle Cain alone, Calling Alice and the other would just get them killed. The only one Chad thought he could count on was Ariel.

[Summon Celestial] this time, Ariel came immediately fearing that Chad would pull her again.

Cain stopped moving the moment she appeared, his entire vision looked on her, a servant of the gods that his mad soul was striving to kill.

[Gravity fissure] A crack appeared between Chad and Ariel separating them with a shockwave.

“What? Chad’s son?” Ariel gasped as she saw Cain appearing in front of her face.

She immediately sensed the killing intent he was imitating, “an imposter?” she swung her greatsword at him.

BAM! [Blade of Disaster] a sword emerged from Cain’s hand and shattered Ariel’s sword. At that moment she was surprised, Cain grabbed her hair and smacked her to the ground. She could feel her ribs crack, Cain was using [Telekinesis] instead of his physical strength.

THUD! BAM! Cain slammed her left and right until Chad was forced to send her back before she die, seeing her agitated Cain even more.

“Y-you…Called an angel…you a god…die!” Cain growled at Chad, in an instant, a massive orb of necrotic magic was flying toward Chad, he had no way of dodging or escaping. Even Zaleria couldn’t save him as they would both end up dead.

CRACKLE! A tree grew in front of Chad, and from it, massive trunks tanked the necrotic orb.

Click! Clack! Click! Clack! An elvish woman walked from the tree with an ecstatic smile on her face.

A red flush crossed her face as her body started to wiggle and twist, “Master, it’s been such a long time!” She glared at Cain.

“Even how low level you are now you are still packing the same heavy punch, I could feel the tingling in my bones from that spell earlier.” Her finger and toes started to wiggle and contract.

Thud! [Thunder Step] Cain used an enchanted version to quickly move toward her and then he used the ninth-tier spell [Thunder Flash]

A lightning bolt stronger than what most dragons could muster exploded from the elf woman’s back. Both Chad and Zaleria got blown away by the blast, neither of them could imagine being hit with such a thing.

“Haha! Master, please more!3” the elf woman was giggling as she hugged the enraged Cain. Lighting was cursing from her body to the tree veins connected to her back and getting disposed of in the ground.
