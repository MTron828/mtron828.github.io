“Controlling will be easy if we used a control hub, I just happened to have something that might help.” Cain turned toward Sebas, “Bring me the thing.” Sebas nodded and hurried out, soon he brought the A-rank dungeon core that Ourals lord wanted.

“What do you intend to do with that?” Leon asked, “Yeah, I heard they are used as a magic source!” The general said stroking his chin.

“A dungeon core can supply the dungeon with Mana, we can use this as a control hub from which you can control all the traps laid around the city, it can only work if you’re the one to engrave them.” Cain said looking at Leon, “It’s a lot of work for you.”

“Wait, do mean I need to be the one setting all of them? We just said it will be over a thousand traps” Cain looked at him with a smile, “I can do that work for you if you don’t want to, but I will be the one in control and you have to ask me to activate them when you need!”

With this Cain was making Leon pay for the traps without giving them to him. Leon quickly caught onto that and sighed. “Fine, you can keep them. But I wouldn’t be paying you for the installation.”

“Good doing business with you, I will inform you when I’m done installing them,” Cain said drinking all of his tea in one go, with this he can spread traps without any legal problems.

“My lord he is right about the potions number!” The accountant seems to have finally finished his calculation, he was clearly out of the conversation for some time.

“Cain has told you before, you should’ve just taken his words for granted,” Alice said curling her lips into a frown. “You’re right. We have already gotten played when you were sticking your nose in that wooden piece.” Leon looked at Alice and then at the accountant. The man shrieked like a turtle pulling her head back in.

“My lord, is it alright to leave a stranger to control such a powerful weapon?” The general said, he immediately felt chills down his spins as Alice stared him down. He could feel itching all around his body, it was a strange feeling as if ants crawled on him.

“Watch your mouth, He is Alice’s husband and she is higher than me in the inheritance order. You’re setting yourself to the rope!” Leon screamed at the general, even without the inheritance problem, if Alice asked his father it will be over.

The general looked at Alice, her face was passive showing little anger or discomfort, “My word is that of Cain, if he wanted me to fight over the inheritance I will do it.” She said and the general gulped.

“No need, we’re better off leaving the work for Leon and asking him for help like today,” Cain said laying back on his seat.

“I wouldn’t mind you taking the position, where it’s me or you sister it will be all good,” Leon said. With how inheritance work, Alice who was the first wife’s daughter had a clear advantage over him, add how much their father loves her and she is almost guaranteed to win in a power struggle.

After a short chat, Leon immediately left as he still had to oversee the troops’ training and the city’s affair. It was true that William was letting him handle most of the work so he can either inherit the lord position or help Alice in the future. But if Alice kept true to her words he was the one to rule this city in the future.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Master, That was splendid work!” Sebas praised Cain as he read over the paper Leon just detailing the deal. “I need you to get ready for more, this is nothing in comparison to what awaits us!” Cain said as he left with Alice, Sebas thought about it for a moment and then returned to his work.

As they were getting out Cain could hear Sofia and Selena fighting Zaleria in the garden, Cain wanted to check on them but that would just halt their training. He instead went with Alice to the basement to check on the prisoner. Gracie had her work as a Headmaid today so he will be the one to help Alice in her training.

As soon as the woman saw him she shrunk and backed off, sweat dripping from her forehead, she looked at him with quivering eyes. “It’s a while since I saw you last time, how have you been doing?” Cain asked with an evil smile.

“She’s been obedient for most of the time, she rarely complains,” Alice said cracking her fingers. The woman shivered and she looked at Cain.

“I’m here just to watch, don’t worry about me.” Cain sat back and got comfortable to watch.

The woman handed her forearm to Alice and clenched her teeth. Alice took a sharp knife and made a large incision across it, immediately healing that wound with Holy healing.

The procedure was clearly painful but Cain wasn’t satisfied because Alice didn’t use her cure magic. “That isn’t training, at this rate you two will keep doing that for decades.” He said frowning.

“But I don’t like inflicting pain on people, even this I usually have Gracie or Sebas help me with,” Alice replied and Cain stood immediately.

“Would you like to be able to do it? It’s necessary to control your magic or what you did to me last time would just repeat itself!” Hearing those made Alice’s heart hurt, she looked at Cain remembering how almost she killed him.

“Please do,” That was the only thing she said before Cain used the binding. “Train as much as you can with her, no holding back!”

Alice looked at Cain and bowed deeply, “As you wish master.” After everything, she is still technically enslaved to him. Seeing the red glow in Alice’s eyes the woman cried.

“Sir…No master Cain. Please tell her to be gentle, I can barely bear the incision pain!” She almost cried on his legs.

Cain thought about it for a moment. “How about this? If Alice managed to control her magic well I will raise your grade from a punching bag that is locked up in this basement into a slave that can roam the house freely. Then if you managed to please and gain the approval of the maids I will raise you into one. Lastly, if you managed to please me as a maid I will release you.” Cain quickly set her on a harsh path to freedom, but the start was going to be painful.

The woman looked at Cain with quivering eyes, “truly, you will free me?” Cain looked at her with a smile. “As long as you are obedient I will fulfill my part.”

Alice immediately caught The woman’s arm. “Please at least let me take a deep breath.” Hearing the woman again Cain sighed and put his hand on her head.

“Fine, do it on her signal.” He said to Alice. The woman looked a bit relieved as she took a few deep breaths and said. “Do it!” GRAWWAAAAAAAAAAA! She immediately cried when her skin started to rot and peel off, at the same time Alice’s healing was kicking in.

‘She was saying the truth when she said that she could use them both at the same time now she reached 20 wisdom.’ Cain smiled as he help the struggling woman in the place.

“I will tell Sebas to start bringing you the best food and the comfortable bed we have so keep strong.”

They finally stopped when it was almost lunchtime. Cain grabbed Alice and left the woman to rest a bit, it wasn’t good to use her too much.

At the lunch table, everyone gathered, Alice, Cain Sofia, Selena, Zaleria, Gracie, and Mary. The lunch was served quickly and it looked delicious.

“Cheers.” Said Cain who was thinking about how the night will unfold.
