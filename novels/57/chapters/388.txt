It only took them a few minutes to reach the tavern, it was mostly a wood building with a stone base, multiple glass windows and tables spread in the street around it.

The inside of the tavern was warm and cozy, you can hear people chatting as they watched the dancing show on the stage as the bards sang.

‘The moment our trio approached, the people started glaring at us. Especially Ariel. The only women who approach the tavern at this hour are high-ranked adventures who can protect themselves ‘ Cain thought. No one was going to hide it, this place was a bit dangerous. And Ariel didn’t look that strong or built.

After that the people noticed Chad, even with his clothes on, people could see his densely built body and feel that he can pack a punch when needed.

Cain on the other hand looked like a beansprout in comparison, thin and pale looking. But even with that, they had a strange feeling about it, the same intimidating feeling they looked at a mage holding his staff. As if he can explode at any second.

A certain barbarian woman who was drinking at the corner saw Chad and spat her drink out remembering how he beat her in the guild that morning.

She tried to point a finger at him and scream but she was stopped by other adventurers, they didn’t want to start a losing fight against him. It was better to lay low and observe.

“Hey master, give them the best service you have. Especially that built man, we don’t want to trigger him in any way or shape.” One of the regular adventures warned the bartender about chad, as if they were treating a highly dangerous criminal, it was better to let them do their thing and leave.

The bartender understood that this man must be the one who rampaged in the guild, otherwise, S-rank adventurers won’t be this careful or scared around.

“Three large mugs of beer, and some snacks,” Chad ordered as soon as he reached the counter.

“Coming right up, take that table over there.” The bartender pointed at the table that was closer to the stage.

As they sat and started watching the show, a waitress brought them their order.

“I like to place a second one as well, we will finish this quickly,” Ariel said as she started gulping down her mug.

Cain gave her a doubting look, was this person in front of him really an angel?

Chad was focusing on the woman dancing on the stage, “Hey Cain, aren’t her moves similar to your blade dance?” He asked.

“Not even close, they are both a dance though. Her moves are designed to show her body while blade dance moves are designed to compile momentum.” Cain replied. That dance was wearing a skimpy outfit and doing exaggerated moves to get tipped move by the lustful watchers.

“But look closely, right now when she turned around and flexed the side of her hips and chest, most of her muscles were engaged to make the important parts more pronounced,” Chad replied with a serious face.

“Aren’t just making it seem bigger than it is?” Ariel gave Chad a doubting look.

“She is right, it’s just a dance,” Cain added.

“Just watch, I bet I could make something out of it.” Chad gulped down his mug in one go and stood. There was something that Cain forget to consider, Chad had 28 Intelligence.

Chad stood up and walked toward the stage. All the adventures grabbed their weapons while the dance looked at Chad terrified.

“Don’t mind me, please keep dancing as you were doing,” Chad told the dance as he started copying her moves. He had far superior strength and dexterity, each time he twisted his body, his joints cracked.

As Chad kept dancing, Cain finally realized it. Those moves, when performed with low strength and dexterity amount to nothing. But when performed with a body like that of his father, it’s a different story.

Each time Chad took a pose, his muscles and bones acted as a spring that has been compressed. When releasing it a massive amount of power was unleashed. The dance was like a hemp string storing no power, while Chad was a metallic spring that could snap.

After a while, Chad had memorized all of the dancer’s moves and tipped her a whole 1 gold coin. He did intend to give her more but giving her a large amount of money publically was just asking for her to get robbed. So instead of dropping them into her bowl, he decided to give them to her later at night.

As Chad descended the stage, the same barbarian woman that he beat up that morning in the guild approached him. “Those were some nice moves, didn’t expect you to ENTERTAIN people.” Cain couldn’t know if she was too excited or holding her laugh back.

The entire bar was on edge, what is that idiot doing? Leave the monster to do his things in peace.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Those moves are a rare gem, we humans have the perfect body and those just take us to the limit,” Chad replied while tilting his head slightly, his fists resting on his hips.

“Yeah, sure. Aren’t you just crazy?” She looked at him with a doubting look.

“Then why did you lose to me this morning?” Chad replied instantly.

“What did you say?” She glared back at him.

“Strong, weak, fighter or a dancer, a master or a fake. Any human who achieves something has needed to put some effort in. Be it that those efforts are physical works or an elaborate scheme, it doesn’t matter.” Chad took a step toward the barbarian woman.

“She has put no less effort into perfecting her dance than you did to become an S-rank adventure, respect people regardless of what they are or their profession.” Chad’s head was right above the barbarian woman, he was taller than her by about a foot.

Chad was angry, everyone in the tavern thought that the barbarian woman was going to die. What was she thinking insulting him?

Only Cain and the barbarian woman understood something important. Chad wasn’t angry at her insulting him, in fact, he didn’t even see her words as insults to him. What he was angry about was her belittling the dancer.

“Hey you there, sorry if my words hurt you.” The barbarian woman looked at the dance.

“Eh, what me?” The dancer was confused.

“So now, are you pleased?” The barbarian woman spread her arms questioning Chad.

‘She is either stupid or has guts of steel, let’s have a look.’ Cain looked at her stats.

————————————–

<Name: Gora Gon><Race: Human><Level: 19/20><Exp: 214325/355000>

<HP: 323/323><MP: 38/38><SP: 285/285>

<Strength: 20><Dexterity: 12><Constitution: 20>

<Intelligence: 7><Wisdom: 10><Charisma: 11>

————————————–

‘She better put the two points she will get at level 20 in her intelligence’ Cain thought, seven points were too low even for a barbarian.

“Can you show me those moves again?” The barbarian woman said with a smile.

“Fine, I will give you a light tap,” Chad said as he started compressing his shoulder, the same move the dance used to show the side of her chest. Is now helping him compress his chest muscles and store power.

“Nope, she will die!” Cain used [Telekinesis] to pull the barbarian away before his Father could send her to the grave.

“What is this? Magic, what did you do?” She growled at Cain.

“Calm down and sit to have a drink, we aren’t here to cause trouble.” Cain used his magic to force her to sit.

As she was still struggling, Cain looked at his father. “Can you calm her down?”

“Of course,” Chad patted the Gora, and her body immediately relaxed. It has been a while since he used his charisma, but it was still effective.

After that they all sat and had their drinks, none in the tavern dared approach them.

After they had their fill, Chad released the barbarian from his charisma hold and they left back to the castle. Cain headed toward his room while Chad headed with Ariel to their room.

“Hey, why is she still after us?” Gora didn’t leave even after the charisma bind was released.

“A moment please, I will kick her out,” Chad said with an exhausted face, he was hoping it wasn’t happening again as it will be a pain to resolve.
