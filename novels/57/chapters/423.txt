As the demi plan wall shattered, Farryn leaped in swinging her hammer. “Get the fuck away from him!” BAM! She smacked Karon as hard as she could. There wasn’t a reason for her to hold back anymore. Neither Cain nor the backup behind her is going to die.

Behind Farryn, Chad and Zaleria leaped in.

Chad heard that his son woke up so he chased him all the way here, instead, he found a bloodied battlefield. His blood was boiling so he punched Cain’s spell until he broke it.

Zaleria followed him since he wanted to check on Cain, she was worried about the operation results but she quickly smelled Karon the moment she went through the portal.

As easy they made it seem, Cain’s [Demi plan] was a tough spell. It was near impossible to escape from, but it could easily break from the outside if hit with the right type of magic. Cain has set the spell so only his father can break it as he thought this fight was too dangerous to let his wives be involved. He could lose one of them in the blink of an eye if they were to fight here.

Roar! Zaleria roared as she bite Karon and fell with her to the ground, those two dragons started wrestling. Even though Karon was half dead, she was pushing Zaleria away.

“What is this one? A wyrm, no even tougher but she can’t be a great wyrm!” Zaleria growled as she breathed fire at her.

~It’s useless, she is like your immune to flames. Try freezing her, I doubt her body can do fine spells like reversing her magic~ Cain told Zaleria with [Message]

~I don’t even remember turning you into a monster, care to explain later~

~Finish her first~

As she heard Cain’s words, Chad rushed in and punched Karon toward Farryn.

She quickly smashed Karon’s neck with her hammer causing blood to splatter all around.

“She is raging, just hold her for a few seconds and she will die on her own!” Farryn yelled.

~I know, leave that for me~ Cain said shifting back to his humanoid form. The golden ring of magic stayed glowing behind his back as he landed between Farryn and Karon.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

[Time Slow] as the entire time around him got slower, Cain started moving toward Karon at a seemingly blinding speed. He can’t punch her since that would make time flow naturally for her, he also can’t cast spells as that can overload his brain.

Cain lifted his fist, there was only one spell that he can keep active all the time which consumed very little brain power and could deal serious damage without touching. [Telekinesis] in its simplest form.

Cain punched Karon over and over with [Telekinesis] covering his fists. The first brain concentrated on the ninth-tier [Time Slow] while the second brain concentrated on [Telekinesis], drawing more power than the ninth-tier spell. The concept was simple: instead of applying pressure on a hundred targets simultaneously, he will punch a single target a hundred times.

This was only possible with his Abominable chimera body, otherwise, the stress will cause him to faint as his heart won’t be able to supply his brain with enough blood and oxygen.

As time started flowing, Karon’s body fell to the ground with multiple holes across all of her major veins.

“Blood loss is what kills a raging dragon, punching more holes into them will make it much faster,” Cain said looking at Karon’s twitching body, BAM! He smashed her to the ground just to be sure.

Farryn glared at him, she knew about that but didn’t think anyone here could pull it off. What surprised her was that it was information that the elves recently discovered (Around a hundred years, time is different for elves) and shouldn’t have been spread all the way here.

…

Far away in the dragon’s star mountain, a dragon woke from his slumber hearing the death cry of his wife. The itching under his scales was unbearable, and his blood boiled.

“Karon…so you died…” His voice seemed both sad and angry.

“Dakin, you have an order from the king to support his daughter. Here is a direct link…” As the dragon who entered held a crystal, the image of the dragon king appeared.

“Dakin, I need you to…” Before the king could finish talking, Dakin shouted at him in rage.

“Fuck off, I have someone to disintegrate!” Dakin walked away ignoring the dragon king and his messenger.

“Hey you, don’t be disrespectful…” the messenger shouted but the king interrupted him, “Leave him be, an angry dragon is a good dragon”

…

Back with Cain, the demi plan got dispelled and Cain lay on the ground.

“Over-exerting my body right after waking up is a bad idea!” He sighed feeling a bit dizzy.

“Cain, what was that form?” Chad was the first one to ask, not even giving him time to rest.

“Abominable Chimera, an outside monster. It’s most suited for magic while still giving me good physical capabilities and some resistance. You don’t like it?” Cain looked at his father.

Chad glared back at Cain, “No, if not for it you might have died before we catch up. I wouldn’t say I’m happy that you’re modifying your human body, but I’m happy you survived.” Chad smiled.

“So as long as it’s practical you don’t mind?” Cain asked.

“As long as it’s necessary, survival is a necessity. Changing your body to simply make something easier, or feels better, when you could have achieved that with training is simply laziness and disrespect to the heart that kept you alive since birth.” Chad had a very strict opinion. To him, humans are the best, he would have been angry if Cain transformed into the abominable chimera just for the physical power. But since it was also for magic and to save his life, he had nothing to disagree with.

As Chad sat beside Cain, Sofia, Selena and Gracie rushed at them. Zaleria and Farryn stayed a bit away as they watched.

“Cain, are all right?” Sofia asked.

“No,” Cain gasped, “I’m all left!” He said and Sofia immediately kicked him in the guts.

“Don’t scare us like that!” Sofia yelled.

“Cain-nya, this whole forest, you can have it-nya!” Selena leaped at him. He could barely understand what she said since she was purring a lot.

“Glad you see you fine,” Gracie said with a calm face, even though her expression looked a bit pale.

“We need to get back, I want to get to the capital and see what is happening there,” Cain said.

“Cain we let it until the day after tomorrow? We still have something to finish here.” Sofia said.

“Like what?” Cain asked.

“It’s a surprise.” Sofia smiled, she wanted to surprise him with Selena being crowned the alpha.

“Can we have a few words alone?” Cain opened a tower.

Only Cain, Selena, Sofia, and Gracie went in.

“Okay, I will make it quick. Gracie will be staying with me all the time from now on.” Cain said with a serious face.

“You mean?” Sofia looked at him.

“Of course so I can feed her, look how pale and thin she is. This should be the last time I need time alone so she will be with me. You don’t mind?” Cain looked especially at Sofia.

“What do you…ah, you don’t need to mind the order. You’re free to do what you want, and her case is a necessity.” Sofia replied. She had no problem with Gracie getting special treatment.

“It’s fine-nya.” Selena also agreed, from that day, Gracie will stay by Cain’s side at all times like a bodyguard. From day to night.

After discussing the detail further, Cain left with Gracie to head home while the rest remained including his father, Zaleria and Farryn.
