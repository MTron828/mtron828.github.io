In Tiamat’s fortress, Morena was looking at a massive acid pool in her lab. Under the faint light of torches and glowing magma flowing from the walls. She moved the acid around to reveal a deformed corpse.

“Another failure, guess the first one was a lucky hit.” She made a sore face. Releasing her hands, the acid consumed the corpse to open space for the next experiment.

“Time might be important, he is really an impressive specimen. His blood consumed even mine. The longer it had to stay, the more my genes are destroyed and the more unstable it gets.” She took a glass tube with a small piece of flesh in it.

“Mother, we finished harvesting everything.” A white-haired devil with glowing blue eyes, a faint aura of mixed origins emitting from his body. A hit of draconic and something unnatural, even though he was a devil, that part only meant he was born in hell.

“Gray, do you feel anything strange?” Morena asked.

“Nothing new, my acid magic is slowly weakening and my horn and scales are shrinking as usual.” He replied with a passive face.

“Just give me some time, you’re father’s blood is just too strong your mother can’t handle it. I will soon find a cure to stabilize your condition.” She said with a smile on her face.

“What if it’s the best thing if father’s blood dominated? The only stable condition I can be in.” Gray said without changing his expression much.

“You’re a smart kid, even if I had to grow quickly in this pod. I don’t know what will happen to you in that case, that is why we must stop it as soon as possible.” Morena said pouring the content of the glass tube into the tub.

“But what…” CRACKLE! As Gray was about to talk, they heard lightning in the distance. Followed by a sharp pule in mana, it was clear to Morena who was it.

“He’s here again?” Morena gasped, ‘But he must be awake to be fighting like this, and would this mean that monster is with him’ She thought with a worried face. She might not be able to get away with getting another sample from him to use.

Gray looked at the gate, “This feeling, and this pulse of magic.” Something started moving inside him, “I must go check it out!” He turned to leave.

“Stop! Don’t go now, and don’t go alone. He isn’t someone you can face just a few days after being born, and neither are the women with him.” Morena grabbed Gray’s shoulder. Her face was serious.

She knew that Gray was strong, too strong in fact for someone his age. But, Cain was another kind of monster to face. A lack of experience can get anyone killed facing him.

“Why?” Gray asked with a passive face.

“You lack spell knowledge and experience, even though you might have a higher potential due to my blood. You can’t waste your life now, just wait until you’re stable.” She replied with a serious face.

If Gray was to face Cain, he would surely die. That is without counting that steel monster that might be lurking around him.

“His blood is slowly removing yours. If we wait longer, I might turn into him which will ruin our chances.” Gray said, “We need to act fast.” He added after a short pose.

“Fine, but we wait until tomorrow. I will have you learn some spells in the meantime. For me, I will get the Abishai ready to fight as well.” She smiled.

At that moment, they felt the ground shaking as a pulse of draconic magic resonated across the fortress. “It’s that girl, did she get this strong?” Morena remembered the black-haired girl who blasted her skull with a fiery kick.

All the Abishai in the fortress suddenly stopped moving and started in the magic direction. GRRRRRRRR! Growling and groaning, their eyes lit in the dark.

“Our queen!” “She is in that direction!” “No, it feels different!” “It’s a bit weak.” “Ah! Queen, show us the way!” “That can’t be here!”

They started arguing, half convinced it was their queen Tiamat and the other half said it was not her.

Morena got confused at what had gotten into them, that girl clearly wasn’t such a thing.

“I knew you’re pretty stupid but not to this degree, she clearly isn’t her. Are you getting fooled this easily?” Morena growled at them.

“See, I was right!” “She isn’t her!” “That can’t be!” “You’re the idiots!”… They started growling at each other.

…

Sofia and Zaleria landed in front of the village with a loud thud. All the tents shook and the wall cracked as the two looked down.

“Cain, am I good?” Sofia asked.

“Yeah, they didn’t break. But if you’re talking about how you did, I won’t say that you two did well.” Cain smiled. “Making sure not to kill your allies is just as important as killing your enemy.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“But everything went fine, right?” Zaleria stared down at him.

“I knew red dragons are always extreme, but I need you two to show some restraint. You can’t always count on me to protect everyone.”

The two of them shifted back to their humanoid form. Sofia was a bit reluctant to morph back but she did anyway. Just as Cain said, her clothes weren’t damaged except for a small tear in her arms.

“Don’t do it again, fight in your humanoid form and avoid the area of effect spells.” Cain approached them.

“I will use it again, I can control my flame to not burn anyone.” Zaleria puffed her chest with pride.

Cain just lifted his hand, “That wasn’t a request. It was an order.”

At that moment, Zaleria felt a surge of pain across her whole body causing her to fall on her face. “Can’t have you hurt anyone. Red dragons tend to lose control when angry, and I know just how flimsy your control is.” Cain stared at her twisting on the ground.

“You’re mean, did anyone tell you that before?” Zaleria stood ignoring the pain, such a thing wasn’t going to stop a dragon.

“I told you before that I will use the buffs to keep you in check. Next time, at least inform me before you attempt such a thing.” Cain glared at her.

“Cain, let her go!” Sofia tried to intervene but Alice grabbed her by the shoulder.

“You as well. Before Mary saved the day and today is Hati.” Alice had a scary smile on her face. If not for Hati’s magic, Mary and Ellie would have died just from the heat.

“Forget about that-nya! You took our hunt-nya!” Selena grabbed her as well.

Cain sighed, he need to make sure those two don’t go off the handle again like this. Especially here in hell where everything is dangerous.

“Fine,” He released Zaleria with a deep sigh, “Just don’t get anyone hurt here, this place is dangerous on its own.”

“I understand, you don’t have to say it.”

And almost immediately, Cain called the girls so they can keep moving. Their goal was the ravine to find Bela’s daughter.

He chose to do that because it was the best-looking option. As they don’t know if the resistance would stay in their place or if they can contend with the newcomer woman.

“Wait…” A devil was about to call them out but the chief stopped him.

“Let them go, they are too dangerous to leave around us.” The chief said.
