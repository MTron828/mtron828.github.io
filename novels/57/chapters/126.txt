Unknowing of the danger rushing their way. Leyla had prepared rooms for Dragon’s fang while Cain decided to use his tower. Cain established his tower right outside the farm because he wanted some privacy.

At the start, he created a tower with a bath and a bedroom as usual but Alice protested. He should sleep with only one of them at a time otherwise; he is going to wreck his health. Going by her words, Cain created two bedrooms, one for him to use and the other for the rest of them.

Alice and Sofia lectured Selena before she could venture into Cain’s room. With how her stamina is she could go at it the whole night without feeling exhausted.

“Listen, one or two times is enough. Going for a third is asking too much.” Alice said asked standing firm in front of Selena. “Remember that he is still recovering, don’t go too hard on him!” Sofia said.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Cain who was changing his clothes to the side heard them. His eyes rolled as he looked at his almost recovered body, ‘I’m like 9/10 healed what they are talking about?’

“I will make sure to move slowly-nya!” Selena said, for a moment Cain thought ‘What is she talking about?’ He then remembered that she has 19 strength, a full power thrust from her could break his hipbone.

They asked Selena to not go more than two times, not Cain. They ended up going at it several times until Cain fell asleep on her. Selena technically fulfilled her promise by not asking for more than two and letting Cain do what he want. The one who thought about that was Cain, he also wanted to have more fun.

It was a wild morning after the wild night, as soon as Cain woke up he saw Selena lying by his side and immediately went for another round. Selena appreciated the gesture saying she would like him to give her attention at all times. If not as intimate as this, a quick chin rub or head pat would be enough to fill her heart.

As he went down the ladder to the other bedroom, his heart skipped a beat as he saw the other three still asleep on the same bed. If it was not for Gracie being there he would have gone after one of them.

Cain quickly woke them up, it was dawn and they needed to get ready for the day.

As they woke up, Gracie looked at them suspiciously, “Do you need to take a shower before heading out?” It was clear from the smell that they went at it multiple times. Cain grinned at Gracie who almost spilled the beans, “Want to join?”

“Sorry, I spoke out of my place!” She apologized with a yawn, Cain could feel that she wasn’t sorry.

“Enough, I could tell as much. It was me who told her to say that!” Alice said as she sat on the bed beside Gracie. “I’m just hoping you won’t hurt yourself. Please try to go at it moderately!” She said with a faint sigh, “Once you’re healthy, go at us as much as you want and I will volunteer first.” She smiled wildly.

After that, Cain clapped his hand and the upper room rumbled. “What did you do?” Sofia asked, still in her underwear.

“I changed the upper room into a bath. Let’s do a quick clean before we go out!” Cain said as he tried to pick a change of clothes from his bag. The girls quickly rose and headed after him to the bath.

In the bath when they were showering, Gracie was using a separate closed room as she didn’t want any of them to see her naked, “Listen, Gracie,” Cain called her, “I want to peek at you,”

“Don’t!” She replied with a bit higher voice than usual, probably since the water was so loud.

Cain and the other three were already going to the hot tub.

“How would you feel if I did it?”

“I would be angry,” Gracie kept replying straightforwardly.

Cain was already in the bath, he didn’t need to see Gracie as he already have three girls who are open to all his advances. Proof of that was that they weren’t reacting to his handing going crazing around them. He was instead trying to test Gracie and see how she reacts to her emotions.

“Let’s say I did do it and you’re angry, what would you do?” Cain asked.

“Nothing, I will just stand there and make sure you see every corner as you wish it.” She replied and Cain frowned.

“That’s wrong. You should show your anger. Getting physical would be understandable in that situation.” Cain replied loud enough that she could hear.

“He is right, act upon what you want and not what he wants,” Alice added up.

“That applies to every situation, if he asked you clean and you were exhausted say so!” Sofia added, “The key is, to be honest!”

“Then, I think that I might react the same way I did with the intruder. Is that allowed?” Cain remembered the intruder she stabbed in the crouch and he got cold.

“You’re allowed to hit not injure him. If you did that I will make sure to strip and tie you on the bed for us!” Alice threatened but Cain stopped her. “That’s going too far from the both of you!”

Gracie slowly walked from the shower. Her whole body was covered in flappy clothes. The only places left were her hands and feet, and her neck and up.

Cain looked at her and was like “You know what? Not seeing your body somehow making you hotter, it’s probably the mystery and anticipation.”

“I don’t think I will live up to that expectation!” She looked him in the eyes. She knew he wouldn’t be pleased seeing her naked.

Gracie slowly dipped into the water, she silently watched Cain and the girls. Strangely enough, Cain was the calmer of them as he sat still enjoying the water. The girls on the other hand were sneaking by. Selena who pretended to be sitting in front of him was secretly rubbing herself on his legs and knees. Sofia was slowly reaching with her hand to his meat with her other hand already deep between her legs. Alice on the other hand was rubbing her body on him slowly.

Gracie could clearly understand that if not for her being there he could have laid waste to them. She remembered back home before they leave. Alice and Sofia had called her to a private room to discuss something.

To Gracie’s surprise, they both bugged her to come with them on the mission. They simply wanted her to act as a block to moderate their ~intimate~ Actions. Her being quite smart and just learning to act upon her feeling, she refused. Saying that she would be a burden and could not guarantee she would not just leave if Cain asked her to. After a few attempts, they finally managed to convince her. The next problem was that Gracie would probably leave the room if Cain asked her to, to solve that problem they decided to use the slave seal Sofia holds over Gracie to force her to disobey Cain’s orders.

The orders The three of them came with were as follow:

Gracie is allowed to use force on Alice, Sofia, and Selena but not Cain.

If Cain was with more than one of them, Gracie will try to be the fourth person in the room. For example: If Cain was in a room with Alice and Sofia, Gracie will enter after them and prevent them from doing anything.

Grace is to give Sofia a report of everything they did when she gets a chance. For example, she would keep reminding Sofia of how shameless playing with herself in the bath as she touched Cain.

“Master, we still have work to do so let’s finish this bath quickly!” Gracie said as she gently pulled Selena away and pushed the other two girls from Cain.

“You’re right, I wanted to try and observe the dragon using Daraku’s binoculars,” Cain said as he stood, Gracie just nodded at him.

Even though Alice and Sofia had a disappointed look on their faces, Gracie gave them no heed as she guided Cain to the changing room, they were the ones who asked for this.

Cain quickly changed his clothes with Gracie’s help. The girls quickly dried their hair and wore their clothes. Gracie waited until they all left the bath before changing herself.

As they finished and packed everything, Cain headed up to the tower room and took the binoculars he sneaked out of Daraku’s bag. Alice questioned how did he get that and he said he borrowed it, Daraku was a rogue so he should have noticed Cain taking them.

Cain slowly scanned the mountains searching for the red dragon’s location. It was not hard to track such a large creature; the dragon was having her meal close to a cave.

“Leyla was right, we have a big female. As she is eating alone outside, we could safely assume she is single, we don’t have to worry about a male ambushing us!” Cain said a bit loudly so the girls behind him could hear him, as the wind was loud.

“How do you know she is a female?” Sofia asked and Strangely Alice replied, “I bet he can’t see a certain thing under her!” Sofia blushed at the thought. How she could have forgotten that thing.

As he was observing the dragon, something terrifying happened. She looked back at him grinning. Cain doubted that and thought it was a coincidence and waved his hand at her, the distance was too big that even an ancient dragon shouldn’t be able to notice him. Compared to humans, it was like asking someone to tell a needle’s color from two hundred feet away.

The next thing that happened made Cain panic for the first time since he reincarnated, the dragon waved her claw back at him before quickly dragging her prey to the Cave and hiding.
