Kayden started telling what he knew about the Fenrir village. The more Cain listened the more he got worried. Apparently, the beast god has a daughter that he was hiding.

The Fenrir village almost went into chaos when the news was revealed; the girl was definitely the beast god’s daughter as she had his Mana. However, unlike him, she only had a single tail which was a sign of her unclean blood.

The other Fenrir took it as a sign of him cheating on his wife with other races. Even though his wife said she gave birth to the girl, they didn’t believe her.

That had caused conflict in the village which had now become the interest of many people. From which was Meliliana wanted to use this opportunity to infiltrate the village, she said that even if Morena failed, the others won’t go down as easily as her.

Kayden confirmed that Morena was working in the interest of the dragon king, she wasn’t acting on her own whims all the time.

Cain quickly linked the dots to his previous life. After Morena killed Zaleria, she sold him to the dragons. Specifically to the dragon king’s laboratory to be experimented on. This made more sense if she was working for them from the start.

Such a thing wasn’t obvious since, like humans, not all dragons bow down to the dragon king. Zaleria was an example.

Kayden resumed his story. Meliliana said that she got a new order from the dragons. The order stated that all Cubus and Kenku are to move to the Fenrir village and help in bringing the beast god down.

Hearing that, Cain smiled thinking that now, not all Kenkus have been turned into chickens. There might be some hope to save their race from the inevitable extinction.

“Do you know anything else?” Cain asked Kayden who seemed to stop talking.

“Not, it was then when I noticed she killed Lala. I immediately went for the head but that thing managed to run away. I never expected her to charm Lily and use her as a meat shield.” Cain banged his hand on the table hard enough to cause it to crack.

Cain wasn’t the only one they managed to run from him, even Kayden seemed to have a similar problem. With how Strong Kayden is, and with how both Morena and Meliliana escaped. Cain could only reach one conclusion that he didn’t want to consider.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Why was he reincarnated? He was supposed to die that day, his magic wasn’t strong enough to grant him a second chance in life, let alone send him to the past.

There was one entity that Cain knew of and could do such a thing. It was the being he wanted to reach in the first place. It was called AO by most people who know of his existence.

What was going in Cain’s mind was if AO was interfering. Cain racked his brain trying to remember any strange events that would be an obvious interference from AO but nothing came to mind.

Another thing that came to mind was the dragon fight. A great wyrm fought three wyrms and won, that dragon had magic similar to Sofia’s. If Cain considered that the three wyrms were working for the Dragon King, they must have been seeking something that the Great wyrm dragon was hiding. Cain was unable to believe that a Great wyrm have been living with him in the same city without even noticing it.

Cain then summarised everything in his mind so he can organize his thoughts. The dragons wanted something that the Great wyrm was hiding in Furberg, for that they assigned Morena which she in turn assigned Lord Bancroft who tried to sway Jack to his side.

Now that they failed, or succeeded since Cain wasn’t sure about what actually happened. They are now aiming at the Fenrir village.

From his previous life, Cain knew that the dragons aimed to slay the gods as they did to their own god. For that, they wanted to get access to the world tree. But now that Sylph was aware of that, she should have integrated with the tree and ruined their plan.

‘Are they looking for an alternative? In addition, is AO really pulling the strings? We better move quickly’ Cain was getting anxious as he wasn’t at a level where he can compete with them. For him to fight a Great Wyrm head-on, he needs to be at least level 70 maybe 80. And that was a regular Great wyrm that did nothing but get older.

“What are you intending to do?” Cain asked Kayden.

“Follow that thing to the Fenrir village and cut her head off,” Kayden replied, he seemed to be on Meliliana’s head.

“Then you two are coming with us, it will be better for us to work together for the time being,” Cain said. He was expecting to fight more dragons and Cubus on the way, even if he hated Kayden, his skills were the real deal and they can be helpful.

“I don’t really mind, you’re strong after all,” Kayden said with a calm face. Cain had started to understand more about Kayden’s mentality, he sees everyone like dogs except the strong ones who he sees as they are.

Cain stood up and signaled for Alice that they were heading back to the keep.

Cain didn’t teleport directly to the keep but instead went through the maze since Alice seemed to want to talk. She complained about having Kayden accompany them, he was too dangerous to keep close.

Cain assured her that he can keep him under control and that even if he was to go berserk, he can imprison him in the maze.

Alice was dubious of that, from what she sensed from Kayden, he might just slash his way to the maze’s core.

“We should get back to Marina, she will not be able to handle the city on her own if the guards were as stupid as showed us. I will have Sebas help her since he has experience.” Cain said with a passive face, his mind was wandering off.

“Fine, when we’re leaving?” Alice asked.

“Tomorrow, it will be me, you, Selena, Sofia, Gracie, Zaleria, Kayden, and the girl that was with him.”

Alice smiled, “If that is the case then leave the preparation to me, you go help Sebas and Marina deal with the city for today.” She knew how hard it was to rule a city, it was better to let in Sebas and Marina’s hand as he had said before.

With that, Each of them went their separate way. Cain went to call Sebas while Alice went to call Selena and Sofia. It was almost time for them to move.
