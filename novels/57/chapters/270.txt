Cain started explaining what he think had happened. His transformation was still incomplete, probably unstable was the right word. At the start, the shard was keeping him awake as it was trying to merge inside him.

After a while, the shard didn’t find a place to settle in his body so it started trying to transform him into a Fenrir. But since he has already become an abomination, that was impossible.

Then a clash between his soul and the Fenrir shard started, which Caused Cain to feel exhausted. His body identified the shard as a foreign object and started trying to exterminate it.

Probably he shouldn’t absorb the shards in the future and instead try to find suitable holders for them. Just like Sylph with Yggdrasil seed. And now, Hati in front of him who holds the Fenrir shard.

Now for what happened at the end. Cain’s soul was going out of control so it was trying to absorb any soul that come close. Luckily the passive absorption wasn’t strong enough to harm Alice, Gracie, Selena, or even Sofia. They were all too high level to be affected without Cain actively going after them.

Sadly Amaya was just level 1, her soul got absorbed immediately. A body without a soul is a dead body.

But she wasn’t a normal person, She was marked by Cain before so his soul didn’t absorb her immediately. She was left to wander inside freely for some time until she was recognized. Cain’s soul simply needed to identify whether She was food or not. The answer at the end was that Amaya was food.

At that point, the veins tried to absorb her immediately. To save her soul and keep her somewhat alive. Cain had to use necrotic magic to bind her soul to her dead body. That had made her a zombie.

“Wait, so you are a necromancer and you turned me into a zombie?” Amaya screamed.

“Sadly I’m not a necromancer, I’m an enchanter that works with non-living objects. What do I need to say, I’m really skilled at creating undead.” Cain smiled as he saw that Amaya retained her personality and intelligence. His enchanting work on anything besides living matter, including corpses so he can infuse them with magic.

“Can’t you turn me back to a human?” She asked with a worried face. Her undead nature was making her calmer than she should.

“It’s hard to explain the relation between the soul and body. But it’s impossible to resurrect a dead human after the soul has been separated from his body.”

Cain did have a [Resurrection] spell. But that spell only works on people who died in less than 10 min, have the brain intact, and didn’t have their soul sucked out. He could have resurrected Amaya if she stabbed him or the like.

“Can’t you do anything about it?” Alice asked. She was feeling responsible as she didn’t push Amaya outside the room and instead focused on stabilizing Cain.

“I can make you look human, but that would also mean that you have to never touch an appraising orb or enter a church again,” Cain said with a pained smile. An orb would reveal her identity and she would burn if she entered a church.

“Fine, but promise me you will look into a solution in the future,” Amaya said as sat in front of Cain.

Cain smiled. “I promise you. When I end it all. Everything shall go back to normal. Now strip.”

“Wait, what?” Amaya jumped backward and hugged her chest. “What do you intend to do?” Alice gave Cain an annoyed stare.

“I’m going to cast polymorph on her, I need to watch her body closely so she won’t accidentally merge with her clothes.” Cain tried to explain himself.

“But you did it to Selena and you didn’t need to look at her naked body.” They were referring to Selena’s jaguar transformation.

“I do see Selena naked all the time, but I have never seen Amaya.” Cain cried as he hid behind Gracie.

The two girls sighed, “We give up, we have already agreed to not get offended by the maids” Alice said. They have already given up.

“What about me?” Amaya cried as she was left out of the conversation, I need to get ready first.

“You don’t have to worry, treat me as a healer or a doctor of a sort. All I would do is make you look like you did before.” Cain smiled as he took a deep breath.

He can’t use regular polymorph, he was going to use the ninth-tier [True Polymorph] he can’t be cheap on Amaya especially since he was the reason for all of this. The second reason is that he didn’t want her identity to be revealed with a simple dispel of magic.

After calming down a bit, Amaya stripped. Her body was pale purple and filled with glowing blue veins. Cain could feel how mushy her flesh was.

After laying her on [Marlin’s floating platform] so she wouldn’t have any complications, Cain put his hand on her chest and started focusing his magic. Amaya’s flushed blue, probably that was a zombie’s blushing.

Unlike polymorphs which have the limitation of similarity. True polymorph didn’t, Cain could shape her the way he want.

Let’s keep the overall shaper of her body. Return the skin tone to its original color. Make sure her body generates heat and make sure her digestive system work.

Transform all of her inside organs to that of a human and eliminate the stench of rotten flesh. Add the ability to sense pain but make it reduced. Also, give her the ability to sleep and most importantly, edit her status panel with enchanting to hide her identity.

Cain finally lifted his hand from her chest. “All done, would you mind standing up?” Cain helped her stand.

He then lifted her hair up to inspect the back of her neck and then inspected her shoulders.

“What are you doing?” Amaya asked with a shaking voice.

“Full-body inspection, I need to make sure everything is alright,” Cain replied as he opened her mouth and looked inside.

“Here is one, I forget to enchant your bones to produce blood. We need you to bleed when injured after all.” Cain said as he touched one of her teeth.

[True polymorph] Cain did not cast the spell again. He didn’t dispel it from the start.

He then started inspecting her bottom, “What is this man of yours doing?” Hati growled as she was watching from the corner.

“Let him do his thing, otherwise I won’t talk to him about your matter,” Alice growled at her.

“What matter?” Cain asked.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Just finish what you’re doing first. We will talk about that later at night.” Sofia was the one to speak with an irritated voice.

Cain decided to wait and started working on Amaya again. “This also isn’t working properly. To keep your skin nice and human locking you need to drink water. The problem getting rid of the excess water.” Cain put his hand on her lower abdomen. [True polymorph]

“The kidneys and the whole urinary system are working again as intended. With this, you seem to function mostly like a human. You can wear your clothes again.” Cain laid back on his bed.

He hadn’t used true polymorph in a while so he almost messed it up. “This time I do need to rest for real, I’m exhausted.”

Crack! The door opened and Selena rushed inside with Zaleria. “What happened?” Zaleria stopped mid-sentence when she saw Amaya bent with her back toward Cain as she tried to wear her underwear.

“Do you need me to punch him?” Zaleria asked as she covered her fist in red hot flames.
