“The damage to his central nervous system is high, when his spine got pulled up it pulled on his second brain located in his stomach knocking him out.” The queen said running her hand at Cain’s stomach. She could easily assess the damage done to his body with a single touch.

“The dragon probably used his claws, could that be the reason?” Alice asked, she wasn’t able to see the moment Cain’s head was cut off since it was in slow time. Cain wouldn’t have been fazed if it was a clean cut with a sword.

“How should we tackle this?” Mary asked.

“Simple, Alice you keep him alive with your magic. You there…” The queen looked at Miko.

“Miko the name.”

“Miko, you take care of fixing the damage dealt to his bones, muscles, and circulatory system. I will take care of fixing his nervous system and growing his head.” The queen cracked her fingers, a massive golden glyph appeared behind her back.

“Ninth tier…you can use it?” Miko asked realizing the queen was about to cast ninth-tier holy magic.

“Well, I’m the pope after all. Let’s get to work!” With a smile, she started regenerating Cain’s nervous system.

Miko started sweating from her forehead, “His veins are all jumbled up. Are those really three hearts, none of them look normal.”

“Yeah, he did some changes to his body. Necessary things to be able to survive fighting those things.” Alice pointed toward the gate with her tail.

“There is something else inside his body, a green crystal filled with spirit magic. It’s linked to both his nervous and circulatory system.” The queen said looking down at Cain.

“That was a gift from an elvish friend, it just give him some resistance,” Alice replied.

“Are you sure? This thing is constantly broadcasting his condition, I would say it’s more of a surveillance tool than just giving him resistance.” The queen replied.

“Don’t worry about it, the person is trustworthy,” Alice replied, she didn’t want to start talking about Sylph to the queen just yet.

…Out on the battlefield.

KABOOM! With an explosion, Chad’s burned body fell to the ground like a hunk of charcoal. The dragon landed away from him while keeping an eye on Kayden, Zaleria, and Farryn.

‘This man and that demon are problems, they keep coming back no matter how much I kill them. They are even saving the other two.’ as the dragon thought that, Chad’s body got engulfed in divine flames, and his flesh regenerated with a loud heartbeat.

“Do you really think that death will prevent me from killing you?” Chad said leaping at the dragon, as long as his heart was beating and he has enough divine energy to heal, Chad will keep coming back.

Thud! Chad delivered a punch to the dragon’s face, at the same time Farryn came from behind and smacked him to the sky.

As the dragon’s body flew, Zaleria kicked him back down toward Kayden who swung at him [Demon will sword]

Each strike from his six arms became five, his body disappeared as thirty slashes covered the dragon.

“I’ve seen enough, time for you to die.” The dragon roared. He might not be able to transform into his draconic body since he will be sniped by those weird steel arrows again. He could still kill them in his humanoid form.

In a moment his body disappeared and appeared in front of Kayden about to breathe fire at his face.

In that split second, Kayden was too slow to dodge, such an attack will turn him to ash in an instant. But at that moment, he saw someone run past them, slash the dragon in the throat and then disappear into the shadows.

As the dragon rolled past him, Kayden just looked in the direction that person disappeared in. “Where did I see that woman before?” He only caught a glimpse of her.

The dragon coughed blood as he started to feel his body getting hot, not in a matter of temperature but something else was on with him. The slash just now has something strange.

Enraged, he turned around swearing to blast the whole place into a hellish inferno. But something was off, his vision focused directly on Zaleria.

Kayden was blurry, Chad was blurry, and Farryn was blurry as well, he could even see Ariel in the distance. The only thing clear in his vision was Zaleria.

“Hey, what is that look?” She growled taking a flying step back, she was getting a bad feeling from him.

BAM! He flew toward her and she started running away, “Get away from me! I don’t like that look on your face!” She cried unable to understand what happened to him. Just a few moments ago, he was about to kill them and now he was chasing her ass up.

“Good, keep distracting him while we attack from the back,” Farryn said leaping up and smacking the dragon with her hammer. Chad and Kayden leaped in to attack as well.

“Just keep this weirdo away from me!” Zaleria looked back at them.

…

Inside the volcano, Sofia was slowly drowning in magma. She might be immune to flame. But that didn’t mean she can breathe it, there was no air down there.

“Hey, useless mage!” A woman’s voice called her, it was familiar. “You failed to even get his head, you’re really useless.”

When Sofia open her eyes, she could only see red magma. The voice belonged to that old lady.

“It matter not, there will be a lot of opportunities to get it. For now, I will give you mine.” The voice said.

“Who…” Sofia tried to speak but she couldn’t, the pressure there was starting to squash her.

“Now go, tear this place apart. Everything besides those who are dear belongs under your claws.” A red skull sank into Sofia’s back.

…In hell, Tiamat was sitting on a stone with hundreds of devils lined ahead of her. Beside them was a row of dead ones.

“Asmodeus, it’s Sofia’s turn.” She said.

“Are you sure? Chad was before, and now her? I don’t much about witchcraft but this Exp transferring ritual just took a massive hunk of your already-failing life.” Asmodeus replied from her throne.

“You failed to resurrect him before and almost informed all of hell of the eldritch existence, now it’s my time to try something crazy,” Tiamat growled.

“Damn it, I already sent her, he should be healed soon. Everything will be all right even if you don’t do this!” Asmodeus yelled.

“I can’t be the useless one, always only receiving help,” Tiamat replied with a sad voice.

“Listen, you aren’t a god anymore. You lost your power, and even with that you tampered with heaven and allowed her to talk to Chad. And killed all of those to give him Exp.” Asmodeus stood. “Do it again and you will die, I won’t be able to save your life.”

Tiamat smiled, “Fine, I know what I’m doing…” Tiamat looked at the devils. “Keep me alive a bit more thought!” All the devils fell dead and Tiamat fell with them on her face.

“Idiot hag, I told you I can’t keep you alive. Don’t die on me now!” Asmodeus rushed to grab Tiamat.

…Back on the battlefield, the volcano started erupting. The dragon stopped in his place staring at the peak, “This presence…”
