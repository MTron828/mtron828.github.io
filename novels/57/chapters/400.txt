Skoll stood in her place, the rocks refusing to fall on her.

[Earth Tremor]

Looking around in her own small pocket of earth, she could feel the worm slither around her in the dirt.

“You idiot, causing the whole place to crumble. This is my land now!” The worm screeched tunneling toward Skoll.

“Not in an eternity, I’ve been perfecting my earth magic by father for years!” Skoll remembered, her father was the only one who knew of her existence inside Hati.

‘Father was the only one who talked to me, taught me magic, and kept accompanying me as I was imprisoned by the shard.’ Skoll thought.

“You worm dare impersonate him, talk with his voice and drag my sister on the ground! From the earth, you came, and to the dirt, you return, this is my domain!” [Earth Bane]

As the worm was about to attack, its breath faded and her long body started to get squashed. Skoll didn’t just cause the cave to collapse for nothing, it was to rob the worm of her ability to jump.

The ground slowly opened up with a loud groaning. The worm was imprisoned in a sheet of stone, only her head was sticking out.

CLICK! CLACK! Skoll approached, her stone armor clicking on the stony ground.

“You will never survive, my wife shall…”

Stab! Skoll pierced the worm’s head with the eternal blade, “Your wife is dead. My future husband took her down!” With a cold stare, Skoll watched the worm squirm and die.

The whole dungeon started to shake. Now that both bosses were dead, it was about to close. Skoll smiled, “It’s the end.”

… After a second, the dungeon closed and the three were ejected. Cain was the first to hit the ground on his back, Selena feel sitting on his face while Skoll appeared standing beside them.

“Are you all right?” She looked at them.

“HMMHOMM” She could barely hear Cain speaking, the unconscious Selena was preventing him from breathing in such a position.

“Did you say something?” Skoll approached him with a smile.

Cain flicked his finger and Selena was gently lifted up, Skoll on the other hand got tied mid-air.

Cain gasped for air and looked at Skoll. “You almost killed us both, why did you cause the whole cave to collapse?”

Skoll gave Cain a strange look, “Would this really kill you?”

“As if I care, I might survive but what about Selena? You could have killed her!” Cain shouted, if not for him using [Lisworth’s resilient sphere] She might have been squashed.

“If I could sense her, there is no way you can’t sense and teleport to her.” Skoll spitted a fact, the world would end before Cain will let one of his wives die close to him like that.

“That doesn’t justify recklessness, being impulsive killed many great heroes. What if I came teleported to you instead?” Cain was still not convinced by Skoll’s argument.

“You come to me? Over one of your wives?” Skoll laughed, “It might sadden me but I know very well I’m not worth as her in your eyes.”

Cain sat silent, she was right. In fact, he had sensed both Hati and Selena almost dying at the same time. He chose to look for Selena and left Hati to die.

Skoll stared at him and spoke, “I would have to admit, we both were but a hindrance to you. You would have done better alone.”

“The two bosses were smart enough to identify you and Selena as weakest and that’s why they went after you and locked me away in a secluded part of the dungeon.” Cain sighed, the results might have been different if he brought his father or Zaleria.

‘Holy, her exp increased a lot since I saw her this morning. She must have gained most of it when causing the cave to collapse as that killed all the monsters in the dungeon.’ The rules of exp were simple, if the enemy greatly outnumbers you and they are powerful, you get extra exp.

Cain then looked at his own stats.

‘Oh man, I should start restraining myself if I wanted to farm exp. Using powerful magic each time is winning me time but costing me that sweet exp.’ Cain regretted his fighting style, his father’s words were true. He needs to work on his physical power instead of magic right now or at least only fight with low-tier magic to get more exp and level up quickly.

“This stupid system, I swear I’m going to punch her in the face?” Cain growled as his mind wandered to distant memories.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Skoll heard him so she got close, “Punch who?”

“Mystra…Ah nothing, I was just talking to myself.” Cain panicked for a moment, he let it slip his mouth.

“You want to punch the goddess of magic? Sorry for causing the cave to collapse, a rock seems to have hit you in the head.” Skoll laughed at him, who in their right mind would say such a thing?

“Forget it, let’s head back home.” Cain tried to change the subject and grabbed Skoll’s hand as he carried Selena with [Telekinesis]

[Teleport] they started teleporting, again and again, slowly approaching the capital. Cain was determined not to waste dungeon cores again.

The moment Cain approached the castle with them, Ariel teleported to them. “Where have you been?” She asked with a passive face.

“Clearing dungeons, where is Alice? We do need healing.” Cain said with a tired face.

Flick! With a single flick of her finger, she healed the three of them instantly. ‘As expected from an angel,’ Ariel was extremely proficient at healing magic, far more than what Alice could do.

“How do you feel?” Ariel asked with a smug face. ‘Being proud of your healing abilities when you’re an angel is like a mage being proud of being able to sense magic. That’s a given!’

“It doesn’t matter what I feel, the important thing is getting Hati and Selena into a place so they can rest.” Said Cain.

“Saying my name first won’t make me happy, I’m older than to fall for that,” Skoll said from behind him.

“Yeah, Fenrirs live five times more than humans. From your look, you must be older than the hag across the street.” Hati and Skoll looked to be in their early twenties, so that meant they are at least a hundred years old.

SMACK! Skoll smacked Cain across the garden and carried Selena, “I will be taking her to her room, your go do something else.”

Cain felt his head spinning for a moment, he didn’t know she could be triggered by such a thing. Especially since she was Skoll and not Hati.

“How insensitive you can be? Don’t mention age to a girl like that.” Ariel poked his head, swiftly casting a healing spell on him.

“Yeah, that might have been a mistake. She isn’t an elf after all.” Cain was keeping the mentality of the elves in his head. Sylph likes to brag about her age, which is because the high elves live longer, the stronger they are. Sylph is on her 2756 year and still going proud.

“A level 1 elf live the same as a human, a level 100 elf live a hundred time longer. I know of that. Those things live too much if given the chance.” Ariel looked as if she hated that fact.

‘Said the one who has been alive since humanity discovered farming and Chauntea was born. She is older than the mountain in the distance.’ Cain thought. The oldest person in their party was Ariel.
