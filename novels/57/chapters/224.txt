The two maids who just returned froze in place as they saw Cain standing in the middle of the room. CRACK! One of the dropped the bowl of soup she was carrying.

Cain gently turned around to look at the mess, “That carped would be hard to clean…” He didn’t seem that much bothered, his demeanor only served to scare them further.

“W-what would y-you like me to d-do?” Marina struggled to speak.

Cain turned toward her again, “So I will be quick since I don’t have time. You will manage the city in my stead; as long as you do a good job you can call yourself the city lord if you want. Come closer.” Cain called her toward him.

She awkwardly stood up and took slow steps like a caff learning how to walk.

To her, it happened in a moment. Cain put her under a slave seal and a chain mark appeared on her wrist. “With this, I can rest easy knowing you won’t betray me. If the city prospered enough, I will consider releasing you so work hard.”

“W-what?” She was confused. She didn’t even understand what he did. Her mouth opened and close on its own.

“I put you under a slave seal, It means I can order you around. For the time being, I can’t stay in Ourals so I will have you rule it.” Cain stared at her, she was probably too scared to process what he was saying, he appeared out of nowhere after all.

“What do you think?” Cain asked Selena as if asking for help. She immediately shook her head, “Don’t ask me-nya.”

‘I guess I have no choice.’

Cain then summon Alice, she immediately appeared from his shadow carrying a small book in her hand.

“Cain?” She gasped at the sudden call, “Did you have to call me so suddenly?” She smiled.

“Can you help me get through her? I’m not that good at this kind of talk.” Cain then briefly explained what he wanted to Alice.

“You should have at least knocked on the door. You scared them by coming so suddenly.” Alice stepped ahead of Cain to talk.

“My name is Alice, I’m the daughter of Furberg’s lord, and you?” Alice’s smile and light air helped her get a response.

“Marina, Ourals’s lord daughter…”

Hearing the response made Alice relax a bit, a conversation was still possible.

“What do you know about the situation? Do you need me to explain anything?” Alice asked while keeping an eye on Marina’s expressions.

“Father made a deal with a witch, started a war against Furberg, turned our army into the undead with that witch’s help, and lost at the end. The one who won the war was neither Furberg nor Ourals; it was a white-haired mage.” Marina stopped to take a deep breath. “A few days ago, a maid sent by the white mage came and killed most of the guards and singlehandedly captured father and threw him in an unknown place. She also said I will need to wait for the white-haired mage.”

After listening to Marina, Alice started to explain what Cain wanted to say.

“First things first. Ourals lost so Cain is taking the city, not even the princess was able to force him to back down so you have to live with that.”

Marina’s face paled, they lost the city in less than a week. She wished her father didn’t act so recklessly but she still appreciated his downfall. She had gotten sick from him five years ago when killed her little sister in one of his twisted experiments.

“I understand that part,” Marina replied reluctantly.

“Next, this is Cain, you know him as the white mage. He is the new ruler of Ourals, please greet him well.” Alice waved her hands around Cain as if trying to make him glitter, “He may seem intimidating at first but he is nice.”

Marina took a few moments to get her thoughts down and then bowed deeply, ‘He is the lord, I am no longer the lord’s daughter my worth probably lower than servants’ “Sorry for my rudeness my lord!”

“Well, no need to be that stiff. Let me tell you about the rest. I’m one of his wives, by the way, you have the nerves to not greet me!” Alice gave her a cheeky smile.

Marina stumbled to apologize but Cain poked Alice in the back, “Stop messing around with her, I want to take a look around the city so can you hurry a bit?”

“Sorry, sorry. She is just too cute not to tease.” Alice barely held her laughter and then started back at Marina. “In short, we don’t have time to stay and manage the city. Cain is wanting you to do that work, you have to rule the city for the time being.” Alice said as she lifted one finger. “Do you understand?”

“I think so. You can’t be in the city for a while so you want me to do your work?” Marina looked at Cain and he nodded.

“And so, to make sure you won’t betray him, he cast a slave seal on you, you’re his slave now. Don’t worry about it as he isn’t the kind of person to abuse his power.”

“Are you sure?” Marina asked as she looked at Cain standing with Selena.

“Let me tell you a fun fact, I’m his slave as well. He seems to have a thing for enslaving lords’ daughters.” Cain hit Alice on the head with a chop as soon as he heard that.

Seeing the interaction between the two calmed her a bit, and her shaky legs seemed to calm at last.

“So for the time being you substitute lord, rule the city until I return,” Cain said. She was a person the citizen knew and trusted well, she was better to rule than anyone else was.

“I understand, but what will happen to father?” Marina asked, she didn’t want to see her father again. If he came back, she will be the first one to suffer in his horrid experiments.

“He will be judged by the eldest princess Noel and Furberg lord William, best case he will be enslaved for life, and the worst-case he will be burned on a stick like a witch. Either way, sadly you won’t see him again.” Cain said bluntly and didn’t realize the faint smile on her face.

After that, Cain finalized the link to the maze and Called Sofia and Gracie in.

“Another thing before I forget, in this keep, you’re the most important person. But if one of my people came in, I mean the maid and my wives, they are higher than you so make sure to give them respect. If you wanted me to free you, you must make all of my 14 maids and 4 wives vouch for you.”

“So I will be free if they approved?” She asked and Cain nodded, he knew it was a tall order for her but it was enough to keep her in line for some time.

Cain then turned toward Gracie, “Take Selena and Sofia with you and drag that old fart to Furberg through the maze. Give him to Leon and then wait for me at home.”

Gracie nodded in silence, “But where are you going?” Sofia asked.

“I will take a tour in the city with Alice to gather Intel about the Fenrir village, her wisdom will be a great help,” Cain said genuinely but he got a frown from bothered Sofia and Selena.

“Next time take us, it can’t be just Alice who has fun!” Sofia said trying to get a date.

“Fine, I will take you next time,” Cain replied with a faint smile.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After watching them jump in joy, he headed toward the city where he had an unexpected meeting.
