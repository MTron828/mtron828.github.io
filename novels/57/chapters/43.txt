A dead silence fell as the girl was kneeling beside Cain, Her whole body was covered with a white sheet and they can only see the two horns sticking out of her blond hair!

“Takeshi! Takeshi!” Miko was screaming as she was forcing a Healing potion down his throat, healing magic didn’t seem to be working on him!

“Master, Can I…” Alice asked, looking at Cain and then glancing at Takeshi.

“Just call me Cain, do you know how to heal him?” Cain asked as he was surprised she could still use healing magic after becoming a devil.

“I did manage to heal you so I thought I will do the same to him!” Alice replied in a quiet voice.

“The lingering curse magic in his wound is nullifying Miko’s healing magic! You have to clean that first!” Cain told her what he knows.

“Is that it? I just poured my magic and it worked on you, I could feel two contradicting forces inside me!”Alice said, slightly feeling her chest.

“Holy and Curse, Those are the two forces inside you! I can tell who was behind this just by looking at your eyes!” Cain said as he stood up to face Jack, “I’m going to kill him, are you okay with that?”

“Make it quick, I don’t want him to suffer!” Alice said as she started walking toward Takeshi.

“NO! WAIT!” Jack screamed calling Alice, for a moment, she stopped to look at him. Her glare was something else! Her right eye was shining like the bright sun while the other took the shape of a blood-red eclipse.

At that moment Jack could feel his skin burning from the sheer amount of holy magic released by Alice.

“Stop! Leave him for me!” Cain said, getting between them. ‘Of course, I’m not gonna let you kill your brother! It’s my job now.’

“Sorry for making you do it!” Alice said as she turned back to continue her way.

Cain and Jack start clashing immediately, Jack was desperate to reach Alice, and Cain was determined to slay him.

“I will do it,” Alice said staring down at Miko and Takeshi, [Holy healing]! And Takeshi was up in a flash!

“You, those eyes are…Amaterasu?” Miko was baffled looking at Alice’s face.

“Even I don’t know!” Alice replied, “I haven’t even looked at myself in a mirror yet!”

Takeshi stood up gripping his sword, “We have to help him, he wouldn’t be able to hold any longer!”

“There is no need for that, He has us after all!” Alice said as her body disappeared into black mist.

…

Cain was exchanging blows with Jack, The match seemed almost even thanks to Daraku’s poison still acting!

“I’m feeling it, my power is growing again! Soon you won’t be able to stand in front of me!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

VAWOOSH! Jack heard the voice in the distance, he turned around and the only thing he could see is Sofia’s hand grabbing him by the face! [Burning hand]

Jack’s face was charred as he took it point-blank.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Selena came rushing in, biting Jack’s leg and dragging him to the ground! As soon as he was about to attack, She retreated to not get hit.

“Those kinds of wounds would heal immediately!” Jack screamed, he soon realized that he was mistaken, his wounds weren’t healing!

Alice slowly walked from behind Cain, [Devil Aura]

Just like how a normal devil could radiate curse magic that would damage humanoids, Alice was releasing her aura! But she was different, she could choose what type of magic to radiate, she chose to radiate Holy magic instead of Curse magic!

“Just as your curse magic prevented our wounds from healing with holy magic, your wound won’t heal with curse magic in my Holy aura!”

Smash! Selena didn’t wait and punched Jack straight in the face sending him toward Sofia.

[Scorching rays] quickly gathering her magic and giving a second burn.

Cain rushed at the staggered Jack, going for the kill!

“His core is moving up and down in his guts!” Alice said as she turned to look in the other direction.

Jack was in no shape to fight back, Cain slashed his torso open with a one-handed swing and then [Firelance], [Enchanting]. [Enchanting]. Burning his inside alongside the cursed object.

Cain could no longer feel Jack’s Magic, he was dead!

“May you rest in peace!” Alice said as looked at the night sky.

…

“ALICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” Leon came Crying, followed by his father who was watching from afar.

Her father was the first one to hug her, followed by Leon who was mostly hugging his father!

“Father stop, you embarrassing me!” she said trying to push him away.

“But my lord, doesn’t she look like a devil?” The head guard approached. He couldn’t feel it, but for a moment, he was about to get murdered by Leon.

“Look like what?” Alice asked looking at the head guard, surprisingly, there were no devilish features on her face. She looked normal! No horns, regular blue eyes, and blond hair! she was the Alice they knew but without her wounds.

“Are you that stupid?” Cain was the one to speak, “Jack’s magic made her look like that so you idiots might attack her! She was using holy magic, how could she be a devil?” Of course, that was a lie.

“Who are you…” The head guard was about to ask but was stopped by Leon, “Someone with more competence than you and me! Go take care of the cleaning with the rest of the soldiers!”

Jack’s matter was finally resolved! Cain felt a bit of relief as the first hurdle was cleared. The rest isn’t any easier but they should be doable!

“Cain, look I can run!” Alice came running toward Cain.

“Hehe! You’re still covering yourself with that blanket thing, just go inside and wear something before running like that!”

She smiled looking at him, she was finally free from her curse!

“What do you intend to do now?” William asked.

“Right now? Go back and sleep as I’m exhausted!” Cain replied yawning, it was a long night.

“Come back tomorrow, I like for us to talk!”

Cain respectfully accepted.

Without further ado, everyone returned to their homes, the hard things will be discussed tomorrow.

…

…

Cain and the two girls have returned to the Inn, as they were already exhausted to the bone, they each went to their rooms to sleep.

Cain was laying in his bed thinking, ‘Jack is out, now I can focus on the actual catastrophe, how are we going to stop all those hordes of monsters?’ He couldn’t do much thinking so he closed his eyes, about to go to sleep.

Whoosh! He felt something fall on him, he could feel legs so it was a person and he could guess who.

Alice was sitting on top of him, she was already in her devil form.

“Please don’t abuse the link, It absorbs MP from me and I’m already about to run out!” Since Alice was a devil bound to him, he could summon her at any time! Since he gave her full freedom she was teleporting to him at her will!

“I just wanted to be by your side!” Alice replied with a smile.

“Your family will be worried!”

“They always are so it doesn’t matter now!” That wasn’t the answer he was expecting.

Sigh! Cain was exhausted so didn’t have to deal with it now.

“Get off me and stand beside the bed!” As Cain said that, Alice’s body moved on its own.

“Wait, what?”

“Remember, binding meant you losing your freedom to me! You can’t disobey my order!”

Alice was nervous, “What are you going to do to me?” She asked.

Cain thought about it for a moment, “Tell me the truth, why did come to me now? Tell me straight away”

“I came because I wanted to have *** with you!” Alice’s face with beet red, she couldn’t believe she said that the binding was so strong she couldn’t even lie!

Cain has to deal with the third one, this was about to get complected.

“I don’t mind but you have to get the other two girls’ permission first!” Cain said, giving Alice her free will again.

Alice falls to her knees shaking, both from embarrassment and from finally realizing how it feels to be completely controlled.

Her breaths were getting heavy!
