Cain lifted his hand with a smile. CLANG! His sword appeared out of nowhere, flying directly to his hand.

Lolth could feel it, the insane magic building up in the sword. "No, you won't do it." She rushed at him, accelerating faster than what could be accomplished by magic.

[Time Stop] Cain bought more time by stopping it. "Spirit of Phlegethos, Inanna!" He yelled, and the sword sparked.

A great flash covered the demon web as a massive entity of inferno rose behind his back. "To think you attained divinity, how much help can my flames be?" Inanna manifested as a woman of pure flames standing behind him.

"Not much against a god, so let me give you some power." Cain smiled.

BAM! Lolth, in her humanoid form, teleported behind Cain, swinging her massive scythe. A mere divine rank five can never beat me.

That moment, it felt like decades.

"Ah! I haven't fought against such odds in a long time. I haven't fought in a place where I can wreak havoc as much as I want." His body started rumbling, and a magical eye appeared behind his head, glaring at Lolth. CLANG! A tentacle sprouted from Cain's back, holding Inanna and blocking Lolth's scythe.

"What?" Lolth growled, watching Cain's body ignite in magic.

Hundreds of dots of light emerged around Cain, and from them, tens of swords flew at Lolth. CLANG! Lolth blocked with her web and leaped back.

"That's Mammon's power, his weapons!" She growled.

"And his friend as well." Cain appeared behind her back, reaching with his hand at her back.

"You!" she quickly disappeared, swapping places with one of her Yochlol. As Cain touched the monster, his body turned into iron. "And that Dispater's power!" Lolth swung her scythe, leaping at Cain.

CLANG! CLANG! Using Inanna, Cain deflected her blows. The next moment as she blinked, Lolth saw a dark elf woman.

"Eilistraee?" CLANG! Cain sliced Lolth's arms, kicking her in the face. CLANG! CLANG! BAM! She used her web to stop her flailing body.

ZON! Cain appeared by her side, swinging his blade.

​ "Begone!" Lolth screamed, BAM! Cain's body got blasted, shattering into minced meat. This web is Lolth's domain, and she rules over it.

"No, I wasted the elder blood." She gasped.

"Hmmm!" A voice hummed behind her, "Elder blood, care to tell me about it?" Cain's body regenerated behind her, and even his clothes reformed from magic.

"What did you do?" She growled.

Cain looked at her with a smile, "Become my pet spider, and I will tell you."

"Insolent bastard!" She opened her mouth, and a wave of venom rushed out and took Cain away.

Lolth panted, "Is he done?"

"You know it won't be easy. Come on, be my pet spider." Cain patted her head from the back.

Lolth spun around, swinging her scythe, " [Divine Severance]" She screamed, cutting Cain in two.

This time she watched his corpse closely, waiting for him to resurrect. But suddenly, his corpse wasn't there.

"What are you doing?" Cain's voice boomed behind her as if there were hundreds of him. When Lolth turned around, she found hundreds of Cain staring at her.

"I see the spell [Clone] mixed with [Time Stop] [Regeneration] and maybe [Weird], a clever trick. But I saw behind it." [Divine Severance: Web of the spider queen] hundreds of threads flew around the battlefield like blades, cutting all the Cain clones simultaneously.

As the corpses fell, Lolth smiled, "You must have lost quite the power. Let's see you make more clones."

Cain immediately replied, "I never expected the spider queen to dance like this. I'm enjoying the show."

Lolth turned back to see Cain sitting on an obsidian throne with one of her Yochlol licking his feet. "What is going on?"

Cain looked at her, puzzled, "What is going on with you?" Pointing at her and then down at the Yochlol.

In the next moment, Lolth found herself licking his feet. He looked down at her, "Are you good up here?" Pointing at his head with a smile.

CLANG! Lolth swung her scythe at him and blew the throne into dust.

Thud! Cain landed away, and Lolth stood panting, "What is happening?" She mumbled.

"Did you like licking my feet?" he asked, and she smiled, "A lot!"

Something flashed in her head, and she finally noticed it. "To think you bastard did it!" She swung her hand, piercing her skull. [Spider control: Lolth's manipulation]

Cain started clapping to her, "What an achievement. Finally noticed that you're fighting the god of madness." He approached her, "Is this reality? Or are you but an insane person dreaming?"

"This is reality, and here you will die." She roared, making her scythe bigger.

Cain disappeared, "Think again."Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lolth found herself kneeling beneath the obsidian throne with Cain resting his feet on her shoulder. "You're a bit stupid, so you fell to my mind control. To get out, you must remember the first moment when I mind control you."

Cain patted her head, "This was a tip for you."

Lolth went into a rage, blasting him and the throne with her web. Relentlessly, she kept blasting, and blasting, and blasting until an hour passed. Each time she killed Cain, she found herself beneath his feet.

"This is getting pathetic," Cain sighed, "I bet Sofia would have found the answer long ago." Cain glared at Lolth with disappointment.

At that moment, he smiled, "Apparently, one of your Yochlol has found the solution. She made a deal with me to let your mind free, so make sure to than her." CLICK! Cain flicked his finger, and lolth opened her eyes.

Tentacles tied her arms and legs, spreading her body in front of the ancient god. Cthulhu glared down as the Yochlol shook Lolth's head to wake her up, "I'm awake. Since when?" Lolth growled.

The Yochlol smiled, "From the start, from the moment you gazed at the eye behind his head." The Yochlol then turned around, walking toward Cain.

"Where are you going?"

"To fulfill my Contract," she replied, standing beside Cain.

Cain stared down with his tentacle-filled face, "She now works for me. Good luck surviving." he said, sending his tentacles to tie Lolth.

"You gross monster!" Lolth screamed, slicing the tentacles left and right. "How did she get out of the illusion? How did she break what I couldn't?"

"By being nice and polite about it," Cain replied.

"When I realized that breaking out of his mind control was impossible, I stopped fighting and begged him to free me." The Yochlol replied, "He agreed to free me alone. When I asked him to free you, he asked me to give my price."

"Say Lolth, ready to give up, or should I send you to dream again?" Cain asked.

CLAP! Lolth growled [Mind Blanc] [Spider hive] [Unknow will] [Divine control] [Spider wide web of Brains]. She made sure to cast all of her mind-defending spells.

"What about now?" She yelled, swinging her sword at Cain.

"Lady Lolth, it's weird seeing you lick my feet." The Yochlol gasped. Lolth found herself licking the Yochlol's feet.

"Not again!" Lolth tried to jump, but her body refused to move, "What did you do to me?" She growled.

"Nothing. I didn't grant you the freedom to move in the dream. Welcome to the mad land. You will be free once you act on your own accord." Lolth, Proceed to lick the other foot. Resisting was futile.

"Master Cain, please don't let me in this situation." The Yochlol said, staring at Cain.

"Would prefer she lick mine or yours?" Cain asked, twirling his tentacles.

The Yochlol looked down at Lolth, "Lady Lolth, please do your best to break out of the madness."
