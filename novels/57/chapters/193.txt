Unlike what he expected, Gracie was soaking wet underneath. She had succubus blood after all and her expression was deceiving. Being in this condition was bound to get her feeling something.

Cain poked her stomach, “How do you feel?”

“I feel nothing, I can’t be tackled.” Hearing her words Cain remembered her skill, she can neither feel pain nor tickle.

That wasn’t a problem he can solve now, all he had to do is try what he can. Getting her back on her feet was a thing that only she can do, and getting over her trauma was a thing only she could do.

After making her she was ready, he slowly pushed himself inside her. As he expected there was no visible reaction coming from her. Going fast or slow won’t fix the problem so he decided to go slow.

After a while, he started to feel his inside contracting, she either is reaching her limit or her succubus blood finally started to reach. “How do you feel?” He asked her as there was no way he could tell from her expressionless face.

“Weird and hot, it’s not a bad feeling.” She said slightly touching her belly.

There was something that he could do, but he didn’t know how would she react to it. Up until now, he wasn’t going full inside her and if she could feel normally he could zap her with magic from the inside. She could either love it or find it agonizing. Sylph used to love it a lot but that woman has a strange relationship with pain.

“I have something I want to try, but you might find it painful. Do you want to try it?” Cain asked her to make sure, his goal was to at least a single reaction from her, that would be a massive jump.

“Is it, just painful?” She asked, looking at him, “I remember that feeling is bad.”

“Some like it and some hate it, you can feel either pain or pleasure.”

Gracie didn’t think of it at all, the girls behind him looked restless and she didn’t want to take more of their time. ‘I have to let the ladies in, I can’t keep master for myself all this time.’

“Please do it, master.” She said trying to relax.

Cain gently put his hand on her stomach, “Take a deep breath, one two three…” At one he pulled back, at two he charged his magic, and at three he thrust in at full force.

Gracie felt as if her insides were crushed, this was neither pain nor pleasure. It was a mixture of the two that she had never felt before in her life. Traveling like an electric shock up her spine and to her head. She could the bones inside her body tingling.

As this was a feeling she never had before, her brain reacted naturally as it didn’t count among the feeling she would hide. Her lips tightened and her eyes looked up in a daze. Drool dripped from her mouth as her face flushed red. Her arms twisted behind her head and her legs tightly locked Cain in place.

Cain stopped moving inside her to check on her expression, he was happy that she finally showed an expression besides her usual passive face. He did make sure to wipe the drool from her cheek with his hand as that thing was dangerous.

“How about now, how do you feel?” Cain asked her as she seemed to calm down a bit, “M-Master more!”

Hearing her Cain blinked twice, it was that good? He could give a second so he did so. This time he heard a loud moan escape her. Her inside twisted around him to keep him in. That was the reaction Cain expected to feel from a succubus inside.

“Master, please give me more!” She cried, Cain, didn’t know what she was thinking. It was strange for her to act like this but it was also the first time she managed to show emotions in a long time.

As per she asked, Cain started thrusting slowly, each one had the same effect. He quickly increased his pace and pounded her harder. Unlike how expected, each time he increased his speed, she would ask for more.

After some time, Cain was about to reach his limit. He decided to increase the magic he was going to pump into her from 10 to 20. Giving her more than what she has.

Gracie’s body twisted violently with that last thrust, she could feel something seep her inside and travel across her whole body. It was a pleasant feeling that she never imagined having existed from doing such a thing.

When Cain pulled out, she was already knocked out.

She had temporary +20 MP. She would lose that by the next night properly as it usually only last around one day.

Cain sat back up to take a short rest when he felt the other three grab his back. “I wanna try it as well.” Said Sofia.

“Me two.” Alice was drooling a bit, she seems to have being in a dire need of some attention.

“It’s my turn-nya!” Selena cut them off, she jumped in front of Cain and lifted her rear end. Gracie was laying between her arms.

“Move Gracie to the side so she can rest fist, Also let me catch my breath.” He said spanking that shaking dome in front of him.

After they transferred Gracie to the couch beside the bed, Cain poured a cup of water for himself and drank it before sitting in the bed. “Can we start?” Alice asked, being a bit restless and wanting him to start with Selena so she can have a go.

“I’m a bit exhausted down there, how about you and Sofia give it some care while I get ready with Selena?” Cain pulled Selena to his lap and Gave her a deep kiss.

He didn’t look that appetizing to Alice since he was just inside Gracie, but the more she thought about the less she cared. Her inside were burning and she would do anything to get him inside her as fast as she could. She knelt down to start along side Sofia.

The night wasn’t that long but Cain managed to care for them all in the end. Selena took his special care from the front and the back, both felt great for her and and she only kept asking for more. Alice and Sofia stooped her unless she would suck Cain dry and leave them alone.

After that it was Alice’s turn, She wasn’t sure if she like it or not but the change felt sweet to her. Cain asked if she would want to try it in the back but she refused. She was content with more care in the front this time.

Lastly it was Sofia and it was bad. Even she was so exited to try it, to her it was only painful. The moment Cain thrust inside her she felt a sharp pain insider her stomach as if it was getting torn apart. Seeing her pained reaction Cain immediately pulled out and she ended massaging her inside for a while.

After resting a bit, she asked Cain for a normal round as what ever he did to the rest, it didn’t work on her. She seemed to like that a lot more and Cain was relived she wasn’t hurt enough to stop everything.

When it was morning, Cain woke up to the four girls laying on top if him. It was hard to breath. “Master, are you awake?” Gracie asked him, he looked at her and she was still naked. He was starting to get used to her being in maid clothe it felt strange.

He gently ran his hand through her back and thighs, “Let’s get up, we have a lot of work awaiting us.” He said as he stood up. Alice, Sofia and Selena woke up right after that.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Cain dragged them down to the bath before It was the first time he saw Gracie being actually naked in the bath which was quite an exotic look in his eyes.

“And now we’re four, that’s quite the number don’t you think?” Sofia looked at Cain with an evil smile, he felt her gazes pricing his chest like daggers. “You charisma is leaking, please control it better!” He cried, he had made Sylph’s tiny hut resistant to seduction and not emotional damage.

“Don’t worry, I’m still a maid. You don’t need to count me as one of the wives.” Gracie said with her regular passive face.

“We can’t do that!” Alice cut her off but Gracie shook her head, “I would prefer to keep working as a maid.”

Cain was the only one understanding what she was talking about, She probably want to be like Lisa who still remained the head maid.

“Then, how about we use the king’s hierarchy?” Cain said in a calm voice.

They all looked at him wondering what he was talking about.

King’s hierarchy was the the ranking of the official wives of this country king. It was decided into.

[Lady of the house] (Up to now it only include Alice, Sofia, Selena.)

[Personal maid], [Personal servant] Both the master and the ladies have of each. (Gracie would be Sofia’s personal maid)

[Maid] (All the maids)

[Servant] (The four unallocated girls and Olivia)

Using this will allow Gracie to keep working as a Headmaid While technically being able to rank up to a lady of the house whenever Cain wished.

“So if Gracie was Sofia’s personal maid, we have to her a servant. And also get one for each of us as well!” Alice said remembering the two maids that were serving her. She remembered that her father said they were her personal maid and personal servant.

She didn’t remember the different between their work though.
