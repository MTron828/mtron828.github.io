Gray stared at Dispater, lifting his hand "I don't see acid immunity or resistance."

Dispater gasped, teleporting 120 ft away and lifting his staff. "What did you‚Ä¶" He gasped. Gray appeared behind his back, [Elemental burst: Acid]

A green goo gathered in front of Gray's hand, charging quickly into a 15 ft tall wave. THUD! Dispater turned around anchoring his foot to the ground and swinging his staff. [Force discharge.]

KABOOM! A shockwave exploded from the staff's tip blasting all the acid away. Dispater immediately swung again at Gray's head. Gray dodged and then saw a kick heading toward his face, he dodged it, and the punch that quickly followed.

Leaping from one spot to the other, Gray made a distance between himself and Dispater and then spread his arms [Symbol: Acid Trap] Hundreds of magical runes spread across the ground and then disappeared. If Dispater stepped on them, they will explode in a blast of acid.

Thud! Dispater appeared behind Gray with a smile, he can teleport freely. "Agony!" [Power Word Pain]

Gray felt his bones crack, his eyes almost pop out and his flesh burn. The pain was enough to stun him for a moment. Dispater touched his back, "What a kid, how much experience do you lack? Turn into Iron."

SHHHHH! Dispater paused, surprised that the demon ahead of him was still standing. Gray's body shifted, turning into what resembled a tanned humanoid woman, his hair grew long and two large wings sprouted from her back.

"Who dare lay a hand on my son?" She growled. Dispater noticed a thin layer of acid between his hand and her back, he didn't make the touch. BAM! She turned around grabbing him by the head, always using a layer of acid to protect herself.

"You! I lent my staff didn't I?" Dispater growled.

"You did." Morena smiled, "It totally failed and I ended up here, sorry but you have to die." She swung a fist at him.

Dispater kicked her fist away, cracking his ankle that quickly regenerated. He then swung his staff at her twice. She blocked the first attack with her arm but KABOOM! A shockwave blasted all of her acids away. The last attack was aimed at her face but she leaped away.

CLAP! Clapping her hand she spread her wings [Acid Rain] [Control weather: Storm] the already clouded sky turned even darker, acid rain covered the whole place as the ash-filled winds blew at full force. All the lesser devils who survived or have resurrected have started melting in agony.

She took a deep breath watching Dispater clench his teeth [Armor of Agathys] his body got covered in an armor of solid Ice.

[Acid Breath] opening her mouth, a mountain-sized blast of acid exploded toward Dispater who teleported behind her to avoid the attack, [Mind Read] [Copy spell: Acid Rain]

As she turned to swing her claw at him, he teleport 120 ft away and stared at her [Acid Rain: Cancel] her spell ceased to exist, he took control and then forced the magic to stop.

"You're annoying, did anyone tell you that?" She growled at him and he smiled, "You flatter me." He replied glaring at her, his eyes glowing red. [Gaze of Dispater]

"Now glare into your deepest fears!" He growled at her with a smile but suddenly found himself standing in a dark room. Cain faced him with a smile. "How about you get the fuck out of my head?" lifting his hand, he slapped Dispater back to reality.

When Dispater came back to his senses, His nose had cracked. Morena has just punched him in the face when he was out.

<HP: 3900/3900> => <HP: 3456/3900> She got him hard, but he was still regenerating each second <HP: 3456/3900> => <HP: 3476/3900>

"Who was that?" He growled lifting his hand up, [Dream]R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm

Dispater found himself in the darkroom again, facing Cain. "You never learn," Cain said with a smile swinging a slap at Dispater.

CLACK! Dispater grabbed Cain's hand, "I do have Psychic resistance‚Ä¶Who are you?" He growled.

Cain smiled, "Fuck off!" A tentacle pierced Dispater's back knocking him back to reality.

When he came to it, Morena was stepping on his face, cracking his skill.

<HP: 3516/3900> => <HP: 2946/3900> about two seconds seems to have passed when he was in the room. Morena had taken the chance and stomped his already injured head to the ground.

He teleported away and looked at her. Trying to enter her mind was a bad idea, whatever the person inside was, he was dangerous to deal with.

"GARHOOO!" Dispater yelled [Devil Word]

The ground started to crack, and hordes of devils emerged. Mostly pit fiends, the one Cain was killing, they have forcefully resurrected. "Kill her!" He roared and the devils charged at Morena.

She smiled, her body growing larger as she transformed into her draconic form. ROAAARR! Her voice cracked the ground, scaring the hordes of devils. Where did this dragon come from, they were fighting a shadow devil earlier, right?

'Husband, care to give me a hand?' Morena asked Cain.

'Who's your husband? Well, I will help you anyway‚Ä¶' he sighed. 'You're not honest‚Ä¶' she smiled.

The devils got surprised to see her smile out of nowhere‚Ä¶suddenly her scales got covered in shadows. They knew they fucked up, all started running away terrified.

[Enchantment configuration, [Lesser Empowerment] [Lesser Healing] [Swiftness] [Soundless] [Shadow Cover] [Shadow Creation] [Mist Step] [Blink] [Haste] [Passwall] [Steel wind strike] [Regenerate] [Telekinesis] [Lisworth's Enchantable sword] [Lisworth's Enchantable sword] [Enchanting] First brain responsible for physical combat using [Blade Dance] and [Twinfang]]

Two gigantic shadow swords appeared in Morena's hands, as she smiled, her eyes glowing with a shadowy yellow light. BAM! VROOOOOOOM! Her wings started rumbling, and all the devils around her got blown away, she swung one of the blades at them cutting a gaping ravine in the ground.

Dispater Teleported away immediately, how could such a massive thing move like that? BAM! Morena Teleported using the shadows to him, swinging her swords left and right like a mountain-sized blender.

BAM! BAM! Dispater teleported away, again and again. There was no way he would risk it approaching such a monster. "Since when did you have those powers?" He growled. Having no idea that he still hasn't faced the real deal.

ROOOOAAAAR! She didn't care to reply, only jumping after him as fast as she could. Dispater kept teleporting away, watching the devils he summoned get blended into a goo by this raging dragon.

"Lord Dispater! What is happening here, where this thing came from?" One of the pit fiends cried before getting turned into mush.

Morena suddenly stopped, sighting. "I give up, he's too fast at running. Husband, please take care of him." She said dropping the blades and returning to her humanoid form with a smile.

Dispater stopped, glaring at her, "Husband?" He got a bit confused, what was this dragon talking about?

He lifted his staff getting ready for her next attack, but nothing came. Her body started to morph, a young white-haired man appeared scratching his head. "Come on, you can deal with him right?" Cain said with a disappointed voice.

"It's you!" Dispater growled.

Cain looked at him, "Hello there." He smiled.
