Alice slowly opened her eyes, feeling the unbearable burn between her thighs. Desperate for satisfaction, she slithered her fingers deep into her most intimate place.

To the side of her blurry vision, she took a glance at him laying like a dead fish. The memories of last night flooded her mind. A painful and irritating sensation burned her inside, like an itch that she can’t scratch.

Without even realizing it she had already started wiggling to his side. Cain heard the sound of her wings quivering so he glanced at her.

“C-close your eyes.” She murmured, noticing how he was staring at her hands. She was pleasuring herself and was ashamed to have him peek at her.

As if understanding, Cain closed his eyes waiting for her to make the first move.

Being in heat, Alice scorned the garments he was wearing. If not for the fear of hurting him, she would have already disintegrated them with [Cursed Decay].

She pondered if what she was feeling is lust or love, her mind quickly gave up as she shoved her tongue into his mouth.

She wasn’t that familiar with kissing, so all she could do was randomly move her tongue.

Cain quickly caught to her lack of experience, supporting her as much as he could.

Alice only stopped for a moment to whisper, “Take the shirt off.” without standing up, Cain started going with her order.

Alice on the other hand slid down to take his pants off. The ever-standing tower held its place in front of her face. She couldn’t tell why but only staring at it made her drool.

Not even bothering to resist, she took it in her small mouth. She was unable to even squeeze half of it inside. The image of Sofia taking it down to the base made her feel jealous and frustrated.

As if to vent her feelings, she quickly picked up the speed. Cain was hardly able to resist the temptation to push it deeper.

He quickly reached his limits, releasing what he had inside her mouth. Alice was surprised as well as delighted, making sure to drink everything to the last drop.

She then sat on his waist, enveloping his sword between her thighs, and very awkwardly resting her feet on his face. Cain didn’t mind and instead went to lick them as that is what he thought she wants.

Being delighted at his acceptance, she tried to push it further, Slowly slithering her tail into his back end. Cain was uncomfortable yet he decided to endure, It was his promise to them.

Unable to bear it longer, she slowly pushed it inside. Taking a few moments, she finally started moving on her own, letting moan after moan.

Selena who was just pretending to be asleep woke up, she had to stay down as she didn’t know what to ask of him.

Hearing Alice’s constant moaning has set her ablaze, making her jerk back to life.

Following her instincts, Selena crawled to Cain’s face, pushing Alice’s feet away and sitting on top.

Cain being surprised at the sudden flower on his face didn’t have much of a choice besides keeping his tongue active.

Selena didn’t stop there, she instead proceeded to rub herself on his face, making it even harder for him.

Sofia finally woke up to the weird sight in front of her, She felt left out.

The frustration leading her, she caught Alice from the hips, accelerating her up and down.

“S-Sofia!? Stop, I can’t.” Alice’s thighs writhed around Cain’s abdomen as her face got buried in Selena’s chest.

The heat cursing through Sofia’s veins both blinded and enlightened her mind. Taking note of Alice’s tail, Sofia pushed two fingers inside Alice’s back door.

“Kya!” Hearing Alice’s moans, Sofia only preyed deeper and faster.

While being attacked on both sides, Alice couldn’t hold longer, Cain as well was reaching his limit.

Feeling the increasing tension inside, Cain released what he could inside her, Alice at the same twitched and wiggled as she reached her climax.

As Alice was able to move, Sofia took it upon herself to drag her away.

“NYA! Meow!” Sofia quickly turned toward Cain, Selena has already taken Alice’s place on his hips.

She was lying flat on his chest, locking her mouth to his. “Please move-nya.”

Doing as she asked, Cain grabbed her thick thighs and started thrusting at max speed.

“Sofia, please do what you did to Alice-nya.” Selena was panting for air, lost in her pleasure.

wondering what she was doing, Sofia repeated the same with Selena.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

As she was moving so violently, her section didn’t last long.

Her thighs tightened as she let off a long moan.

“Cain, Stand up, I want you at the top!” She whispered to his ears.

Cain was exhausted, yet he couldn’t just ask for a rest.

As Sofia lay on her back, spreading her legs wide open. Cain could see her dripping, she was already ready.

Unable to resist the urge, Cain entered without waiting, stopping at the deepest point.

“It’s alright, slowly with a lot of kisses.”

With her words, Cain began moving as he kissed her. With pleasure, she locked her legs firmly around his waist.

“KYA! Kya! Kya!” She was extremely vocal, scratching Cain’s back as she clings to him.

As Cain had already discharged what he had twice in a row, he was taking quite some time to get the third one ready.

As he went back and forth between her pink lips and ballooning chest, Sofia’s body hugged him tightly, enjoying the taste of his shoulders.

By the time Cain reached his thresholds, Sofia had already passed them twice.

As the two of them pressed on each other, the deed was done.

Sofia fell asleep on the spot while Cain lay on top of her, trying to catch his breath.

Cain quickly pulled out, trying to have a rest. “More-nya!” he felt shivers down his spine, Selena had far more stamina than he had, she was probably just starting.

His marbles were already empty, they took time to refill.

“Just give me a minute, I need to take something before.” Cain slides his hand under the bed, taking the stamina potion out.

He had hidden it there yesterday, in case he was about to lose to Sofia. It came in handy today against Selena.

“Do you need that-nya?”

“Of course, I’m at the end of my stamina, the difference between our levels is just that high!” Cain said, chugging down the whole bottle.

“Can we do it in the back this time?” Selena said, Sliding a finger in that hole.

Cain’s mind froze for a second, ‘How come that?’ He couldn’t comprehend how did she get to that point.

“Do you want to try it?” Cain assumed she heard about it in some places, maybe it was the maids’ handiwork, maybe Sofia just set something off in her earlier.

“You know, like the day before yesterday. I couldn’t get it off my mind since-nya.”

The question kept piling up in his mind like mounds of wet sand, weighing his mind down.

“How?”

“At that night, you went suddenly there and battered me hard-nya.” Selena’s body trembled, Her tail straighten as if was jolted.

After realizing what he did, Cain’s mind shut off for a second.

“Why didn’t you say anything? It must have hurt a lot, you aren’t injured, right?” Cain tightly grabbed her hands, his eyes were blinking like crazy, he couldn’t believe what had he done.

“I’m fine, I might not look like it but I’m tough-nya!” Selena dexterously turned her white, round, chiseled, good-looking, soft butt towards him.

“You like doing me there, don’t you? Just pound it like you did that day-nya.”

Faced with it, Cain decided to keep it to himself, sliding a finger into her.

“What are doing-nya? Hurry and put it in.” Selena shocked her rear left and right, wiggly waggly.

“I have to loosen you a bit before, otherwise it’s going to hurt.” Cain pointed out, kissing one of her marble soft eggs.

“Just go in, the pain is a part of the enjoyment.” She pushed her butt at his hips, slightly twisting the finger he was putting inside her. It hurts like hell, she didn’t realize what just transpired.

Cain took it as a punishment for himself, quickly healing his finger with magic. To him, she was like an unstoppable force. The difference in strength was obvious.

Going with her wish, he rested his stick right at the door.

“Ready?” Cain asked, gently brushing her end.

“Go, don’t stop slow down.” She pushed the tip on her own.

Cain already has given up, he grabbed her from the tail, and one hand. Using all his might and speed, he ravaged her as she wished.

Each time he tried to push in, he felt extreme pressure on his meat as if it was going to snap. Selena’s muscle mass was nothing to laugh at.

“Grwa!” She growled in pain, “This…this is it…go harder-nyaaa!”

As he was going at it, Cain could only pity the women who married a man with high Strength or Constitution. It must be rough on them.

The night was still long!
