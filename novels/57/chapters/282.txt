‘He was using magic to directly increase his physical capabilities, just [Lesser Empowerment] or my [Enchanting]’

“This can’t be right, it should be impossible as a human. That is like asking someone to increase their blood flow at will.” Cain mumbled.

“What are you talking about?” Zaleria poked his back.

“He was using magic to increase his body strength. That should be impossible for a human.” Cain replied with a serious face. The only reasonable explanation other than his father using physical enchantment is being demonized. That is an explanation he rather not think about.

“You said it’s like controlling blood flow, that isn’t impossible for humans. Just remembering an emotional scene can get your blood pumping and your heart racing.” Zaleria said.

“I meant finer control, no matter how emotional you get, you can never control your heart rate or blood pressure,” Cain argued.

“Do you really need fine control? Just pushing the limit is enough.” Zaleria said with a straight face. Cain realized that she had a point.

Cain needed the fine control to create specific effects, if all his father needed was to increase his physical power, all he needs is the most of everything.

“Master, did something happen?” Sebas approached Cain with a worried face. It was strange seeing their master’s father knocked to the ground.

“It’s all fine, take him to his room and make sure he is well cared for.” Cain stood up.

“How about you?” Cain asked Zaleria.

“I’m already healed, just a few spells from Alice and I’m ready perfectly fine,” Zaleria replied as she spun her elbow.

“Let’s get inside, I can’t think on an empty stomach,” Cain said as he turned around.

“Cain there is something I wanted to tell you,” Zaleria called him.

“What is it? I’m not angry about this.” Cain replied with a smile.

“No, I wanted to talk about something else. The druids seem to be getting lost in a forest up north. I suspect it’s my hut appearing there.” Zaleria said.

“It’s moving all the time if I remember correctly…” Cain said with a thinking face.

Zaleria instant leaped close to him, “I never told you that!” She glared at his eyes.

‘Fuck! She was really proud of her Hut defenses so having a stranger like me know something like that is a big flag.’ Cain quickly thought of an excuse, those eyes in front of him were serious.

“You see, I’m an expert in dimensional and teleport magic. I know that the easier way to keep something hidden from a dragon-like is to be on the run. If it was stationary or moving in the world you could have just flown there and tracked it with smell!” Cain desperately tried explaining himself.

Zaleria cocked her head and moved a bit backward with cautious steps. “You’re honestly scary, creepy at some times. How could you even reach such a conclusion?” Zaleria didn’t know if she should be impressed or run away. This man knew too much for a human.

“That’s what happens when you learn a lot of magic, give me your hand.” Cain grabbed Zaleria’s hand.

“What are you doing?” Zaleria asked as she felt a bit of magic seep into her.

“Nothing bit, I just injected my magic into your body. This way I can track your location and use it as a teleportation catalyst.” Cain said with a smile.

“Wait am I a dog to you?” Zaleria growled at him. She was half smiling so Cain went with the joke.

“More like a precious steed! As I said, when you reach the hut I will create a portal to it so you will never lose it again.” Cain quickly changed his words mid-sentence when he saw Zaleria’s teeth.

“That reminds me, what happened to the witch tattoos you were supposed to teach me about?” She asked him with a straight face.

“Those things need Kraken’s ink and blood. I wasn’t able to find such a thing on the market no matter how many people I asked. We can hunt one ourselves after we reach the capital.” Cain said with a thinking face. The capital was located on the ocean side and had a great harbor. They did need to cross the ocean to reach the elvish kingdom after all.

“That ugly fish? You know how big it is, and I can’t swim!” Zaleria exclaimed.

Cain found it hard to hide his smile. He didn’t know that Zaleria can’t swim.

“We can ask a bronze dragon for help, they always had beef with the krakens,” Cain replied with an evil smile.

Zaleria’s face turned serious, “Then they have a whole buffalo with us chromatic dragons. I and Sofia will get attacked on sight.”

Chromatic dragons were the ones identified by their color, they all have scales similar to that of crocodiles or other lizards but with a single dominant color. Like red dragons or blue dragons. They were generally considered evil because of their chaotic nature.

The other ones were metallic dragons, to put it simply, their scales were made of metals. Copper dragons, Iron dragons, gold dragons, silver dragons… They actually fought to protect the dragon god in the past so they have rotten blood between them and chromatic dragons.

On top of that, the one who killed the dragon god was a red dragon like Zaleria and Sofia. That meant that red dragons get more hate than blue or white just for that fact.

With all of that, it was stupid of Cain to think a Bronze dragon will help him while being accompanied by red dragons.

“Don’t worry, I know a little girl who wouldn’t give a rat arse about anything if it meant exterminating Krakens.” Cain smiled.

“Please don’t tell me it’s another thing that only you can know. With this much knowledge, I bet the dragon king will be happy to have at his side.” Zaleria said with a wry smile.

Cain laughed it off, ‘If you only knew how right you are.’

“Let’s get inside for tonight, I need some food.” Cain dragged Zaleria inside, she will leave early in the morning so it was best for her to rest.

At the dinner table, Cain stared at Elsie.

“The carrots were better raw, you made them worse…” He stared at her like a sad rabbit. She who was known for her temper tried hard not to yell at him.

“How about father? Is he awake yet?” Cain asked Sebas.

“Sadly no, he is fast asleep. The maids are guarding him so they will inform us with any change.” Sebas replied with a slight bow.

“I did punch him really good. Any other human would have turned into paste under such pressure.” Zaleria said proudly.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Cain glared at her, “I swear I will turn you into a leather bag if you gave him brain damage, I’m not joking!”

Zaleria looked to the side, “Probably we should call the head pope from the capital to have a look at him just in case…” she was sweating really hard.

“Even the head pope will not be able to heal such an injury, believe me, I know how incompetent that old fart is,” Cain growled as took a big sip from his soup.

“Yeah, talking about the church. We have a problem with them concerning the wedding.” Alice said with a concerned face.

Cain sighed, he somewhat knew what she was about to say. “They are against marrying multiple women, I know that. I have a solution for that.” Cain said with a confident face.
