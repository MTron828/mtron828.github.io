Luckily when they returned, Kayden didn’t attack Lexi’s house. As much as Cain trusted his girls’ strength, they weren’t on a level to compete with such a demon. “It’s clear that he doesn’t want to mess with you, we have to use that,” Cain said to Zaleria, The idea that such a monster was roaming unhinged made his skin crawl.

To clear things, demons weren’t inherently evil, but the majority were. Due to devils being evil, the humans who mated them must be either crazy or evil. Which that their child can grow to resemble them. But there were cases where Demons were good natures due to the goodness of one of the parents or simply because they were abandoned and raised by a different family.

Kayden was different, he wasn’t born but created by Morena. If she left something in him it was absolute evil as that woman in the incarnation of her acid. Stinky and corrode everything he comes into contact with.

“I already remembered his smell, if he comes close I will tear his body apart,” Zaleria growled, she wasn’t used to people escaping her grasp like that.

“Was that man a true one(Demon)? I could sense some magic(Curse) in him.” Alice said as they were about to sit back down. She was still unconsciously managing to keep the important words hidden so Lexi and her family won’t discover her being a devil.

“He is, He’s the kind of horror your brother failed to become(Demon). But to be fair, you should be able to grow stronger as you’re pureblood(A true devil).” Cain replied with the like, he was happy that she wasn’t slipping any word. Cain also thought Alice won’t just become stronger, she will leagues above that man as she has duality magic.

“What did you meet there?” Sofia asked, “should we have come as well-nya?” Selena added.

“No, it would have been bad to have you two lung at that man. He could kill you in just a couple of moves.” Cain was sure Selena might be able to withstand a couple of slashes but Sofia can’t.

Kayden also seemed to be able to partially hide his presence from Zaleria, which make it a bit easier for him to speak to them.

What would have happened if they fought in the pub? Kayden would have killed Alice first as she was a healer and then he would have killed Cain. After that Sylph would have been summoned and she will revive Cain before his soul passed to the afterlife, it will be too late for Alice to think. Unlike Zaleria, Cain doubts that anyone would have been able to escape Sylph’s watchful eyes if they were a 10-mile radius from her. Since her power originates from her connections to plants and the world tree, she can see and hear through any plant, tree, wood, or grass in that radius.

“Let’s go outside, I will build my tower so we can stay in it.” Cains stood up, “Zaleria, can you stay in the middle of the city and make sure that man won’t interfere?”

“You don’t have to tell me that, I’m already waiting for him to show up!” It seems that he didn’t need to worry, as long as she was keeping guard, Kayden won’t be able to get close without starting a fight with her. There was another advantage to having her guard, she can stay awake without sleep for months since dragons can sleep with only half of their brains.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I will build a wall around the village, The rest of you help the villagers if they need help.”

Everyone rushed to do their part, Lexi’s family helped introduce them to the villagers while reassuring everyone that the bandits won’t return to the village.

Cain circled the village using [Earth wall] to create a small wall and give the village some defense. The wall wasn’t anything fancy, just a ten feet tall and five feet wide wall. Every fifty feet he created a small watchtower which was just a big block of dirt twenty feet tall and ten feet wide.

“Spindle, don’t wander too far away from me,” Cain said as he felt Spindle move a bit far outside the wall. The tiny creature immediately returned, “Spindle saw something, wanted to check.” he said.

“Let it be, don’t take risks as that demon is wandering outside. You will be killed before you even know it.” Cain said staring at the forest when the bandits are going to make their move. It will be bad if Kayden wanted them to attack first as will then have to leave the village defenseless.

As it was a bit late, Cain returned to Lexi’s house where he was to raise his tower in their backyard. [Lisworth’s Tower] [Enchanting]. I have leveled up so I can safely reinforce my tower now. This was the equivalent of a fourth-tier tower, it had three floors instead of two.

Cain generated the first room as a bath as always, he was dirty from making all the walls and even the girls wanted to take a bath. The second room was a bedroom. And the last room was the magical ward, a room that acted as a decoy in case Kayden attacked at night.

It worked like this. They were sleeping on the second floor, if Kayden realized that and tried to attack them, the third room will switch place with the second immediately causing him to destroy the wardroom instead. That will be enough time for Zaleria to tear his head off. Of course, that room wasn’t from the tower original room, it was a make-shift defense mechanism that Cain slapped on the fly and as such, it was unstable and consumed a lot of MP to set.

In the bath’s changing room, Lexi looked at Cain with a worried face. “Is it alright for me to get in as well?”

Cain looked around him, “If you don’t mind seeing me naked or me seeing you naked then you join.”

“I mean…Only Headmaid Gracie was allowed…” Lexi was worried about something else, she didn’t have a problem getting naked in front of Cain as she knew what she signed from when she accepted to be his maid. What worried her was why Cain refused their service from the start.

“Ah, that. What do you say, Alice?” Cain looked toward Alice, she was the main reason Cain didn’t allow anyone to the bath with them. He also didn’t allow maids into his room since Sofia might get angry at him but she seemed to be getting used to it slowly.

“I don’t mind, she could even spend the night with us!” Alice replied with a smile, and Cain sighed. He hoped she wasn’t just putting a front, but with her wisdom, she would know better.

“Then fine, Gracie, teach her the ropes,” Cain said as he took his clothes off, All the other girls were almost all naked by that time.

After that Gracie watched over Lexi as she washed Cain’s back. Gracie herself seemed to work twice as efficiently as her. Alice, Sofia, and Selena were chatting about what they found in the village and what problems they encountered. Zaleria on the other hand stayed silent.

Cain started to feel weird after Having Lexi around him for a long time so he asked Sofia to sit in front of him. “Why do you want me to do that?” Sofia asked as she felt Cain’s hand caress her chest and stomach.

“Is it wrong for me to want to touch you?” Cain replied, not caring that Lexi was standing behind. “It’s a bit weird, but I don’t hate it. What got into you all of a sudden?” Sofia asked with a low voice.

“Well, to be honest. Lexi here looked a lot like you and it was getting to my head so I wanted clear my head with the real thing.” The blatant of his honesty made Lexi fall on her lower half gasping for air.

Sofia turned toward him with a blushed pout, “And you say it to my face?”

“Would it be better to keep a secret from you?” He replied, that in his book it was better to let them know everything they should know.

“W-wa-wa!” Lexi started gasping for air, she expected to be one day called to his bed but she didn’t expect to be compared to one of the ladies. What would happen to her if Sofia gained a grudge against her. A maid should never try to stand equal with their master ladies or she might suffer for her whole life.

“Should I remove her?” When Lexi looked up, Gracie was staring down at her with a passive face. ‘Here it comes, I’m done!’ What she feared had come, it now all fell into Sofia’s hand.

“No need for that, I don’t really care anymore. But if she did something with Cain behind my back I will make her cry.” Sofia said as she laid her back on Cain’s chest.

Cain hugged her and whispered. “So you’re okay as long as we tell you?” Cain was trying to tease her even more, he had no intention of taking Lexi when he has the three of them.

“Let me correct myself, I will make her cry either way.” She replied, a pout on her face. Cain then felt something slam into his back. When turned back it was Lexi, Selena and Alice pushed her onto his back.

Cain started laughing, “This is enough, Let’s stop teasing her.” Cain said as he saw Lexi’s beet-red face and quivering legs.

Sofia giggled, as she looked at Lexi.
