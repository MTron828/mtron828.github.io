“ROAAAAR!” Selena growled at the other women. None of them dared to approach Cain.

Selena was for the harem, she would prefer if Cain had a huge pride. To her, the more the merrier.

Yet there was a single exception, those idiots in front of her were a no-go.

“Come on Selena, weren’t you the one talking about building a pride like lions? I’m sure there is a place for a couple of us.” One of the women said. She had heard that Cain beat Seith who was considered one of the strongest and now they saw him win against the whole crowd.

“She is right, you brought someone amazing, let us have some.” Another one said.

Cain looked in their direction. Something was on his mind. ‘Where is the –nya?’ They are black Jaguars like Selena so where did it go.

“Selena, they are far weaker than you so don’t go all out,” Cain yelled. It would be bad if she started a blood bath.

The average stats for those women were.

Their levels ranged from 1 to 5.

“Aren’t they a bit weak?” Cain asked Seith who was standing beside him. “What are you talking about? They are ferocious hunters. I would say they are stronger than Selena, are you sure she will be alright?”

Something started to click in Cain’s head. They seem to have a misunderstanding. “How strong was Selena when she left?” Asked Cain.

“She was a level 2, barely able to hunt a wild boar so we were worried sick.” Said Seith. “That’s right. I should go help her quickly.” Said Elena as she walked out of the house stretching her arms.

Cain finally understood a part of the problem.

“You seem to miss something. Selena is not at a low level now. She is level 15. You must have felt it, but she is stronger than you.” Said Cain looking at Seith.

Selena slowly walked to a nearby tree, she didn’t like holding back so she wanted to demonstrate her strength in the hope the women will retreat without a fight.

Hugging the tree, Selena quickly tightened her grip. CRACK! The tree truck cracked under the massive pressure. BAM! The trunk shattered and the tree fell in the middle of the woman.

Some of them who were surprised by that ended up trapped under the fallen tree. “What was that?” One of them screamed.

“She has 20 strength, a single whack from her tail and you will be cut in half,” Cain shouted at them. “Also even if you managed to beat her, you will have to deal with me afterward.” Cain made it clear that he will fight as well.

“Shut up! You have to deal with…” One of the women said. However, before she could finish. Cain appeared in front of her.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

[Dominate Person] Cain used both the spell and his 20 charisma to unleash a powerful charm. “Sit!” She said loudly.

All women who could see and hear him fell under his charm. He only exempted Elena and Selena.

Thud! In a single motion, all of the women sat on the ground wagging their tails. “They have low wisdom so they won’t be able to resist this.” Cain touched one of them in the face. She didn’t reach which meant she was full dominated as the spell dictate.

“Do you think they will be satisfied by this?” Seith asked. He knew for a fact they will come back after the magic ended.

“This village rule is strength, right? Then they need to be stronger for them to challenge Selena. Also, I don’t want to spend a whole day fighting, we have work after all.” Said Cain.

“What are you going to do with them now?” Elena asked as she pinched her cheek. She was suspicious that Cain might have used the spell on her as well.

Cain slowly bent down to face the woman, with a charming smile. “Take those idiots away. Don’t forget to clean the place afterward.” The men dragged a lot of dust and dirt when they came. Cain didn’t want to have Elena or Seith clean it up so he asked them to do the work.

“Are you done or do you need my help?” Zaleria walked out of the house. Patting her belly as she had eaten her fill.

“Are you joking? You know I can take of this alone.” Cain replied with an exhausted face. He was sad that the charisma he hated so much was looking to be useful. It was a terrifying weapon in the hands of his enemy but a reliable one in his hand.

Drip! Drip! A few droplets of water fell from the sky on Cain’s nose. He looked up and the sky was covered with dark clouds.

“It’s going to rain, let’s get inside.” He said.

They all walked back inside.

“What is this idiot doing?” Said Cain as he saw Kayden sleeping on Lily’s lap like a child.

“He ate too much and fell asleep, he is sometimes like this,” Lily replied with a smile on her face.

Feeling like having a nap as well, Cain laid on one of the pelts. Taking an hour’s nape won’t be bad. They cannot do anything while it’s raining outside.

“You can use my lap if you want.” Said Alice. “No me…” Said Sofia. Selena quickly jumped in with Zaleria who found it fun to join.

It took them about a minute to decide whose from them will have Cain sleep on her lap. “I won!” Said Alice looking for Cain.

Cain was already sleeping on Gracie’s lap. She was gently combing her hair with her fingers.

Gracie was the only one who was available when he wanted to sleep so he took her. The others have wasted too much time deciding.

“I will go take a look at the river, the rain seems heavy,” Said Seith. There was a river passing by the village and it could flood. That wasn’t the only problem as it was filled with alligators and other monsters.

“Don’t stay too much in the rain,” Elena said to him with a gentle smile. He has done this routine for years now.

Seith rushed outside and ran all the way to the river.

Thud! Thud! Using his powerful claws, he climbed a nearby tree and hid in its leaves. This was a place where rain couldn’t reach him so he could observe the river.

The water level was rising slowly but it shouldn’t be a problem in the rain stopped within two hours. ‘I should wait for a bit, if the rain started to weaken then I will return.”

Inside Selena’s house, Cain was deep in sleep as Selena and she chatted.

Unlike Seith who was worried about his daughter’s wellbeing and accomplishments only. Elena on the other hand had a lot more to worry about. The main thing was why was Selena ending her speech with-nya-like cat girls? Moreover, why was she that focused on a lion-like pride?
