With the last slash, Gracie finished the spiders. Without even waiting for another second, she rushed deep into the dungeon. Ripping and tearing any monster she comes across.

A giant centipede, sliced in half. Another big spider, a nail to the head was all it needed. A giant cockroach, a stomp was all he needed to be squashed.

‘So it just demonized bugs? Gracie should be able to finish them quickly.’ Cain was keeping a close eye on her, he would jump to help her immediately if she needed.

Up to this, point Cain was no less than impressed by her performance. Seeing her rip them apart with her passive face was terrifying. Some of the monsters have even started running from her.

~Go deeper, we won’t get anything from those weaker monsters. Try killing the boss inside, he should be a devil.~ Cain told her. The place is filled with demonic monsters so most likely it is a devil boss.

Gracie ignored the hordes of bug monsters and rushed deeper. Not a single monster dared chase her after how she treated them.

Jumping from one hole to the other, Gracie finally reached the final room. ~He should be in the room ahead, be careful~ Cain warned her.

Gracie made sure to watch her steps as she jumped inside. The devil was sitting in the middle of the room awaiting her arrival.

“Look what he has here, did you come here alone?” a vaguely humanoid shape with two wings and a back filled with spikes. His tail looked like an extended spine. The devil extended his claws as he spoke.

Gracie just glared at him silently. She was counting the spikes and trying to guess how he will attack with them.

“I do believe I was speaking in human tongue, say something.” The devil growled at her.

Thud! Gracie jumped into the shadows and appeared behind the devil. “Naïve!” The devil immediately blocked her swing with his tail and countered with his claws.

Kaboom! She immediately blasted him in the face with a fireball and retreated to the darkness. It was the first monster to react to her attacks in this dungeon.

“Now it’s my turn.” The devil smiled putting his hands together [Limp bones]

As the devil used his curse, Gracie immediately felt a sharp pain across her entire body. Her legs and arms felt weak and they started shaking.

“My cursed magic weakens the bones of those I cast it upon. As I’m a bone devil after all. Don’t you dare move or your bones will crack like twigs!” the devil started laughing, against his magic most creatures would lose immediately.

As she felt pain for the first time in a long while, Gracie’s senses got sharper. She still had some tricks up her sleeve.

[Shadow Grasp]

The shadow underneath the devil expanded and sucked him inside. The shadow then spat the devil right in front of Gracie who was carrying the fireball wand in her hand.

Kaboom! She blasted the devil again.

“Why! Why aren’t you scared of death, don’t you feel pain?” The devil growled in anger. People usually start crying and begging him for mercy when hit with his curse.

“I was ordered by Master to kill you, not to think about fear or pain.”

The devil froze in place as he heard her answer. Her words were as cold as her stare. The fact she wasn’t emitting any killing intent meant that she considered this to be no more than cleaning.

Staring at her, he could not feel any emotions from her. His wings started shaking, ‘She is mad’ He thought.

“Fine, you will die here!” The Devil leaped at her swinging his claw.

In the last moment before he hit her. The devil felt an overwhelming aura of bloodlust rushing at him from behind her.

Thud! The devil retreated immediately. Sweat dripping from his neck. “Sorry master. I must have disappointed you!” Gracie apologized as Cain walked toward them.

When the devil gazed upon Cain. His spikes stood up in fear. ‘What is this horrendous presence? Madness, rage, bloodlust, wild magic, evil, and destruction. I can swear that I felt it before in hell, what was it?’

“You’re a problem!” The devil screamed as cast his [Limp bones] at Cain.

Cain slowly lifted his arm and swung it around. His bones were like jelly, which made his arms look like tentacles.

“What is this supposed to do?” Cain said ominously as his hands extended like actual tentacles and grabbed the devil.

“What are you?” The devil screamed as he stabbed Cain’s arms with his bones.

“True polymorph can easily turn your magic into a plus. Thanks for the idea!” Cain thanked the devil as he threw him away like a rag doll.

The devil didn’t know that Cain was an abomination. His body can function even without bones and adapt. On top of that shape-shifting magic made countering the curse extremely easy.

[Bone spears] The devil extended his tails toward Cain and started shooting spikes.

Seeing the bones flying toward him. Cain cocked his head and uttered some arcane words [Elemental wall: Stone] A wall of stone appeared in front of Cain and blocked the bones.

[Far step] Cain teleported to the devil and swung a dagger at him, the devil reacted by blocking with his bones. [Enchanting: Electric discharge] Cain zapped the devil on the spot.

“You bastard!” The devil jumped backward and swung multiple bones at Cain, “Would that girl be able to resist my curse like you?” The devil was smiling.

“You’re right. Now that I think about there is no need to keep you alive so it will not matter. Alice heals her.”

The devil didn’t understand Cain’s words at the start. He was confused if he was talking to him or someone else. But it didn’t take him long to feel it. Another horrid existence appeared behind him.

“A-an upper rank?” The devil started at the girls who appeared beside Gracie out of nowhere. In the next second, he felt both holy and cursed magic coming from her.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Wait a moment, what is an upper rank doing in such a place?” The devil growled at Cain.

“Her? She is my wife.” Cain smiled at the devil. “But this is as far as I can go, I don’t think they will care about what happens to a devil so please bear with me,” Cain said as he lifted his hand. [Telekinesis]

The devil’s body got suspended mid-air as Cain walked toward him.

“You bastard human, let me go!” the devil growled as his body didn’t move.

“A bone devil…do I need anything for such a low-rank devil? I guess you’re closer to mid-rank.” Cain said as he knocked on the devil’s chest with his knuckles.

“I’m going to rip your head apart, let me go you human!” The devil kept screaming.

“I don’t need anything, after all, just give me your curse magic if you will.” Cain grabbed the devil’s head.

[Enchanting] [Mind Break] Cain started breaking the devil’s consciousness and coping with the cursed magic within him.

As the devil growled, he remembered where he felt a presence like Cain’s. It was not even a natural thing. It happened when the devil lord was testing one of his theories.

The bone devil remembered that day as clear as yesterday, the moment the devil lord generated that presence he stopped the experiment immediately saying, “Such a thing must never come to our reality!”

As Cain was almost finished, the devil growled his last half-word, “Cuth—” The devil died as Cain slashed his head immediately before he could utter the name.

Cain stared at the devil’s corpse with murderous eyes. “As expected, devils can know more lot than they need.”
