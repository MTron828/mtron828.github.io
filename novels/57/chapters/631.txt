Kayden stared at the demon king, bent down, and held his blades to the sides. SHIIIIIIII! The air around him started to vibrate as the demon king backed away.

[Demon Moon: Cresent light dance]

[Demon Sun: Burning bones at noon]

[Demon Destruction: Abyssal charge]

Thud! In less than the blink of an eye, Kayden leaped forward, swinging his swords left and right. Threads of silver and red lights combed the night sky as he surpassed the demon king.

CLING! Kayden stopped on one leg and clanged his blades together.

As the threads sliced the demon lord to shreds, they exploded immediately and tore the whole place apart.

Flames roared as the ground got lifted to the sky. The sheer heat generated from the two contradicting magics with Kali's destruction devastated the place.

Cain's [Prismatic Dome] barely survived the explosion, and his senses told him of the demon king's death.

Thud! Kayden landed in front of the dome just a moment later, glaring down at Lily's corpse that Cain protected. "She was already dead the moment he showed her to us. Probably died well before I arrived."

Cain looked at him, will it be okay for him to suggest raising her as a lich?

[Kayden-chan, use your blood on her corpse.]

Kayden lifted his forearm and sliced it with his sword, blood dripping on Lily's corpse.

With an eldritch light, Kayden's blood flowed through the corpse, cursing it back to life. Lily's torn flesh got pulled into a single lump from where she emerged, reborn anew as a demon.

Lily's body changed drastically, she was around 5 feet 8 inches before, and now she is well around nine feet. Her skin and eyes turned blood-red, and two gray horses grew on her forehead. A long flowing pale golden hair replaced her previous short back hair, and muscles covered her whole body.

Cain didn't waste the opportunity and checked her states.

Kayden immediately took off his kimono and covered her body, "Kali! You turned my little puppy into a monster!" He screamed.

[Do you realize she was a human? Well, let me help you with that.]

As Kayden argued with Kali, Cain took the opportunity to appraise him.

Cain smiled, "This is the birth of a new demon king, no, an absolute demon lord." He laughed.

Bahamut started laughing, "He's basically an Avatar of Tia." Everyone stared at Kayden as he lifted Lily. Only Cain rushed at him.

"We need to get her treated quickly," Cain said, and Kayden handed her to him.

"Get the blond girls to check on her," Kayden looked toward Ariel and Alice. Those two are the best healers around here.

ZON! Cain didn't even bother walking. He just teleported a few meters distance and appeared beside Alice.

"She must be exhausted after transforming. Make sure she is stable." He said, and the two got to work.

~My Master, Lord Cain. I have Dwiergus alive~ Umberlee called Cain with a smile.

Cain stood up and looked around him, "I will leave you a portal to use. I have some work in the demon web." He flicked his finger, and a portal appeared.

"See you later," He disappeared.

ZON!

Cain appeared inside Umberlee's throne room. When Umberlee spotted him, she rushed to kneel in front of him.

"My Lord Cain, I brought you what you asked for." She said with a shaking voice.

"How low have you fallen, Umberlee!" Dwiergus growled from behind her. A mass of flesh, bones, and steel chained inside a prison or raging water torrents.

Umberlee paid his words no heed. She knew who was the real danger in the room.

"You can stand," Cain said, and Umberlee stood immediately like a soldier.

"Yes, Master."

Cain patted her head, "You've done well, and you can relax. See, it wasn't that hard to follow orders."

For a moment, she was confused about what she should feel. Joy, fear, hope, or happiness?

"It's you bastard, the one who ruined my Avatar!" Dwiergus growled, shaking his cage.

Cain pulled Umberlee toward him, "Look at him. This is what happens when you don't have a chance for me to forgive you."

Umberlee hugged Cain's said, staring fearfully at Dwiergus. She saw a massive jaw filled with teeth bite him whole. Munch! Munch! Cain ate him whole.

Morena appeared beside Cain and looked at Umberlee. "He deleted his soul and consumed his power, truly unfortunate." She sighed.

Umberlee stared at her with scared eyes, "Eat?"

"Cain has no reason to keep you alive. He can eat and keep you like me. Instead of just following orders, you must constantly work to please him." Morena said, kissing Cain's cheek.

"What?"
