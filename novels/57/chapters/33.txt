Right after declaring he was going to FIX Alice’s condition, Cain dragged Yamauba with him to a nearby Alchemy store! He was going to need some items to start experimenting! Takeshi and Sofia chased after them, in curiosity!

Daraku, Miko, and Selena stayed home, sipping tea as if nothing happened!

The alchemy shop looked like a shabby hut, surrounded by pots growing weird plants! The smell of herbs filled the air as they opened the door! It was like the unholy child, born to a threesome between a pharmacy, a spice shop, and a flower shop!

“Welcome. oh, isn’t it Yamauba!” The shopkeeper gasped in happiness. Even though she looked like an old woman in her forties, she wasn’t taller than 3 feet! Her slightly big hands and feet were a distinct feature of her. A halfling was a rare sight in this place!

Cain knew they love jokes and chatting, if you were depressed and wanted someone to cheer you up, just spend an hour with one! Cain just remembered an old funny moment.

“Who’s the guy? Changed the big one?” She asked jokingly, Smirking at Yamauba as if they knew each other for years!

“Please stop, we’re just here to buy something!” Yamauba replied, quickly brushing what she heard to the side.

“And you, what you’re relation with her?” The shopkeeper turned her attention toward Cain, trying to tease him instead of Yamauba.

“Sugar mommy, Give me those!” He handed her a list of items he needed.

Especially after seeing the face that Yamauba made, the shopkeeper burst to laugh.

“What are you saying!” Yamauba shouted at Cain, “I’m not paying for anything!” she seemed to get a part and miss a part.

Seeing her angry red face, Cain whispered to her, “Do you how to make potions? If not then I will teach you!” Yamauba paused for a moment, ‘Hold up! He can make potions? Wasn’t that an alchemist job?’, after thinking for a moment she replied in a whisper, “I will make you pay if you were lying!”

Seeing them whisper as that gave the shopkeeper an urge to ask, “What you two chatting about?”

“Milking some money!” Cain just didn’t stop with bad jokes, she was kind of thicc though!

Cain’s list of items wasn’t that big, just that there were expensive! Some of them had price tags of 10 gold coins and above! Yamauba ended up having to pay a total of 123 Gold coins!

“Don’t worry, they also include items to teach you how to make potions!” Cain reassured her as that was an amount that could give a regular person a heart attack!

“Come again soon!” The shopkeeper told them as they were leaving.

“Sorry, I won’t! I’m not a quick shot!” Cain just pushed one last one, he just wanted to match the shopkeeper, Maybe she could help them in the future!

Yamauba wasn’t all that amused as she found the experience embarrassing, She wasn’t used to someone like Cain fooling around.

Taking a quick detour, the two of them headed toward Dolrig’s shop to get Cain jewelry! Yamauba saw it as her chance to get revenge on him! She wanted to embarrass him in front of Dolrig.

“Yo, Bas…” As soon as Dolrig saw Yamauba he stopped, he didn’t want to curse in front of her until he knew her relationship with Cain! “Can you introduce us?”

The one to reply was Yamauba, “The name’s Yamauba, Cain here got dumped so I’m comforting him!”

Dolrig looked at her with suspicious eyes, “Yamauba? Gotta tell Takeshi you’re cheating on him!” Dolrig ran outside.

Seeing that Yamauba rushed behind him screaming, “That was a joke!!!” Luckily for her, she found that Dolrig was just standing outside.

“Takeshi always fixes his weird sword here, he never stopped talking about you!” Dolrig didn’t know Yamauba’s face yet he had heard her name from Takeshi. As they weren’t from this kingdom, her name was unique which made it easier to remember!

After grabbing the jewelry and heading back, Yamauba was the one feeling most exhausted. Takeshi and Sofia who were following them out of curiosity have heard everything, laughing at their backs.

As they passed by Dolrig, Takeshi stopped by to fix his Nodashi, it seemed to have gotten badly damaged from the clash with Cain.

Dolrig eyes opened wide, Takeshi’s sword was supposed to be one of the best he deals with, for it to be damaged this badly, he just couldn’t believe it was done with the sword he sold to Cain.

…

Taking a quiet room, while being observed by Yamauba a Miko, Cain started the experiment!

Putting two vials facing each other, Cain put some of Alice’s hair in one and some of his in the other. Adding water and some of the crushed herbs, lastly a push of Mana!

The two liquids turn red for Alice’s and Blue for Cain’s. Yamauba was looked at questioning herself, ‘How in the nine-hell does someone his Age know how to do that!’

Cain then pulled a third vial, “Let’s mix and see!” He said.

“See what?” Miko asked, Getting closer so she can have a better look, she seemed extremely interested as he was supposedly in the process of finding a cure to Alice’s condition. For the record, she before has tried to heal Alice as a request from the city lord William but failed.

Cain just explained it quickly. “The herb I just put can make a powerful poison that destroys human tissues, on the condition, there is more than one! If I mixed those two now and we got a purple Color, Alice is a devil, and if it turns transparent she is a human!”

Cain then quickly mixed the two solutions in the third vial, in just a few seconds the mixture turned transparent, Shocking Yamauba and making Miko feel some relief.

“What is the meaning of this? You told us she was a devil, didn’t you?” Yamauba wanted to know more, she was just getting more intrigued about what Cain intended to do.

“This is what I expected, she is a human after all. Her body is at least!” Cain declared smiling.

As The two women needed an explanation, he told them what he was going to do!

“If Alice’s body is that of a human and I saw her as a devil, that leaves the only one explanation, that her soul is that of a devil!”

A failed Devil summon! There are multiple ways to someone a devil to the real world but only one of them is permanent, making it a body to possess!

That process usually involves summoning the devil into a human body then transforming that body into a devil body through Devilification!

Usually, when the second part isn’t done right, the devil’s soul is sent back to hell immediately and the body will die! In Alice’s case that didn’t happen, she continued to live, either due to willpower alone or a problem in the spell itself.

Since Alice didn’t know she was a devil, Cain could suppose she (The devil) was quite young when the experiment happened!

The reason for her condition is just that, the incompatibility between her devil’s soul and the human body! For example, when the devil’s soul wants some blood to go to her horns, those things don’t exist on her human body so blood ends up just pooling under her scalp!

This caused her body to keep destroying itself, there was only one solution to her condition.

“So are you to try and get her human soul back? Is that even possible?” Miko asked and Yamauba nodded, they can’t see it possible.

They are right, Alice’s human soul is already dead! The one he is trying to save now is the devil!

“The daughter the lord loved until now was probably the devil, we’re going to save that!” Cain declared, shocking Yamauba. is he going to find a way to stabilize Alice’s body?Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I’m going to complete the failed spell and fully turn her into a devil! Binding her to me in the process so she won’t be rejected as well cut her ties with the first caster!” This was a new level of how the hell do you know how to do that! The two women could just stare in silence.

Devils aren’t supposed to exist in the real world, they would get quickly sent back to hell, that was why most devil summoning spells are temporary! To keep her in this world after fully becoming a devil, Cain needed to bind her.

The binding was just like a summoning pact, an enslavement pact, or the leash on your dog to tell people that it can’t bite you even if it wanted to!

Now the rest was just getting Alice’s consent of turning into a devil and if she was willing to be bound to Cain!

Cain could already guess as to who might be the first caster, his blood started raging! The two women could feel the primordial, unholy, infiltrated, Will to tear someone’s soul apart!

“If I found you have a hand in this Jack, I will send you to the lowest circles of hell!”

Now it was more than just betraying everyone!
