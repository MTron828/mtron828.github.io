Cain moved closer to the quivering Sofia, “Come on, it’s your turn.” Cain’s whispers made the fine hair on her body stand up. She could feel the Mana pulsing in his body radiating heat. That was a feeling strange to her, just starting to understand how to feel Mana when he was sick.

The feeling was strange, she was supposed to be the dominant one. Feeling her Mana fade in comparison to his, in her eyes, he looked as large as a mountain. No matter how much she tried to move, the surging heat inside her stopped her body.

Sofia slowly dragged her body to his, with shaking lips she approached him. Cain gently accepted her, caressing her in a bear hug. With her shaking hands, she gently pushed him down, treating him like a fragile being.

“So much compacted power is such a fragile body…” Sofia whispered sending shivers down Cain’s spine. Her hands gently moved down his collarbone caressing his withered chest. Cain could see the burning heart in her eyes, her words did cut deep as he didn’t expect her to be already able to distinguish the condition he is in.

Sofia honestly didn’t know what a dominant meant, she took a glance at Alice but she was already in another world. “Cain…What is a dominant?” Her question put a smile on his face.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Normally you lie down with me doing all the movements, I change your position however I like and you do whatever I say. That’s dominant, the roles are now reversed.”

Sofia nodded as if she understood what he meant, shifting her eyes between his and her body. Cain wasn’t going to make a single move, just lying there motionless like a dead fist.

Many things passed in her mind like a flash, all of her fantasies came rushing back making her grin from ear to ear. “You won’t judge me right?” She asked, Cain easily recognized the burning heat in her eyes.

“I will, but does that matter?” He replied that a part of him got scared of what she might do.

She hesitated for a moment before making her first move, as Cain lay on the ground she sat on top of his belly, both of her feet crocked on his thighs with her facing him. She could feel his throbbing between her cakes, she made he was standing behind her. Slowly bending over she started licking his ears.

As he quivered, she went down to his lips, making a gentle kiss on them. Cain was surprised her tongue was nowhere to be found. Her lips slowly moved down his chin to his neck while her hands carcasses his head.

“There isn’t much here.” She whispered in a sad voice as she licked his chest, mourning his lost muscles. “They will regrow eventually, did you like them?” Cain asked seeing her hands slide on his chest as if searching for his missing muscles.

“They were your selling point, not that bulky and not bones like you’re now. To me they were perfect!” She licked his non-functional mamilla. Feeling him jolt only made her more daring.

After playing with them for a while as she watched his reaction she looked at him with quivering eyes, “What?” He asked as it was clear on her face.

“Well…I was wondering if it’s alright for you to…lick…” Without the need for her to finish Cain already understood what she was wanting. He was going to take advantage of this situation.

“Turn around and sit on my face, don’t forget to do me the same.” Cain gently helped her into the position, “Don’t sit with your whole weight, I will guide you with my hands.” She had already taken him deep in her mouth while he was going wild on her flower.

Not being able to contain the heat surging through her body, she suddenly turned around and pulled her hips to his. As they touched, she rocked her lower body and rubbed herself against his hardness, frantic with desire.

Without waiting, her hips devoured him in one quick gulp. At that moment, her legs spasmed and jerked. She sat motionless for a moment as the strength washed from her hips, she desperately called to him, “Aaa…I can’t move!” Her voice mixed with a pleasure full moan.

“Neither Can I!” He replied forcing her to be the one to move, she hardly managed to lift herself, as she reached she plummeted back on him. “AHHH!” Her eyes seemed to be on the verge of rolling back, “Cain please help me!” She begged again, moving like this wasn’t her strong point.

“Well, you asked for it.” He said as he slammed both of his hands on her pure white pearls, “AGH!” She moaned as two red imprints of his palms were left on her butt, the surging pain helped her regain the feeling of her hips.

After regaining a bit of her strength and with a heart full of burning passion, she started to move violently. Cain didn’t expect that much energy to come out of her. Each time he reached her deepest part, she could feel a pulse of numbing pleasure go through her abdomen to her head. As the feeling accumulated, she found herself lying on top of him sucking on his tongue, reminding her of how he was on top of her on their first night.

Eventually, she heard a faint moan exit his mouth like a burst of heat exploded inside of her. Her toes curled and her leg shook, she could feel an intense tingling under her teeth as drool escaped her mouth, while being breathless she could feel something rush from her inside as she bit on his shoulder.

Without speaking any word her body twitched like a dying fish on top of him. Cain had just unloaded inside her and she seems to be finished. Seeing her satisfied face laying on his chest and feeling the pain from her intense bite on his shoulder, Cain wanted to tease her one last time.

He grabbed her hips and rocked inside her as fast as he could, she didn’t even have the strength to move, she just let a deep moan as she climaxed a second time before falling asleep.

Leaving her in place, Cain turned toward Alice that was taking care of herself.

“Come on, it’s your turn.” Hearing his words she happily rushed down, sucking on her tail was never enough. However, she quickly came to a stop.

“This was just inside her?” She asked, moving her head away. “It was.” He replied and she quickly washed him off with warm water before beginning her turn.

It was supposed that he will be rough with her so after confirming she was ready, the safe word was her shifting to a human.

Cain grabbed with all his might her two thin obsidian-like horns. He started slow and quickly sped up until he was thrusting in her throat like tomorrow. Alice struggled but she never tried to shift her form, to Cain it would be easy to pick up of that so she could still go.

It took him a couple of minutes of violently rocking down until he managed to conclude, he pushed her head down and pressed as she scratched his hips with her long nails.

Alice gagged as she was released, desperately trying to catch her breath.

“Are you alright?” He asked with a worried face, she glanced back at him, “Don’t mind me, and keep going!” she replied while being short of breath.

Cain thought hard about what he wanted to say, “Can you call me master while we do it?”

Hearing him and looking around, Alice remembered the first day they met in her bath. Feeling like she has been in this satiation before, it felt like a déjà vu and her will from that time rushed back out.

She bent down and gently kissed his foot, “Master please don’t leave me.”
