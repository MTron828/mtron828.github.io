The Mansion was in chaos as all the maids have woken up to severe pain. Alice looked through the window, ” The whistling has halted, Cain must’ve done something.”

“M’lady, the maids needs your care.” Sebas walked behind her with a faintly worried look.

As she looked behind her, a maid was laying on the ground growling, grabbing her stomach tightly.

“This is bad, I might ask father if we could move with him!”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I don’t know how master Cain would react to that, I doubt he will be pleased. Your father on the other hand would be pleased.” Sebas replied with great discomfort.

Alice slowly turned her head towards him, her eyes faintly glowing in the dark as her magic seeped into the maid.

“You might be right, he might get angry if I said that.”

After a couple of minutes, Cain returned with Sofia. They saw Alice healing the maids with Gracie and Sebas’s help.

“How is it going?” He asked as he bent over one of the maids, to him she looked fine.

“Just minor bruise from knocking them out, the seems to have stooped. Selena is asleep in her room, I managed to fully heal her.” Alice replied quickly as she finished healing the last of the maids, the woman stood up and bowed slightly giving Cain a weird look.

“Have something to say?” Sofia asked. Cain wanted to avoid that but she has spoken faster than he could stop her.

“Is it going to be this dangerous from now on, I doubt the other could work in such circumstances. I for one would leave immediately if that was the case.” The maid said what Cain expected, in the end, they were workers. They aren’t forced to work there by any means and it was time for them to question their job.

“I really hope it won’t happen again, I and lord William are working on capturing whoever is behind all of this!” Cain replied with a bitter smile, there was no use trying to calm the maid with lies.

The maid looked at them with a worried face, she seemed to put on a forced smile after that. “Thanks, master, sorry for my rudeness.”

“No, your concerns are in their place. This is unacceptable and needs to be fixed.” Cain said as he looked at Sofia, she immediately added.

“Two times in a row is bad, hiring more guards would be preferable.” Her words gave Cain headaches, the money for that has to come from somewhere.

“Let’s head back to our room, you are still in need of rest!” Alice stopped their conversation, as bad as the situation might seem, she isn’t going to let them keep Cain awake longer.

The next morning, Cain took the girls and headed toward the guild, It’s been a long time since he last took a quest. Mary rushed from her desk the moment she saw them walk in, she had heard he got injured so she was worried sick.

The no word has come from the William that morning meaning that the stalker didn’t speak up. Taking that time to gather some money, Cain hoped to find dragon fang and take a mission with them.

“Sorry for making you worry Mary, It was just an accident and I’m already well. Have you seen Dragon’s fang?” Cain asked, as he wanted to get things done quickly, he had already wasted some time in the morning waiting for William’s messenger. The Dragon fang might have gone on a mission already for all he knows.

“I’m glad you’re alright.” She said whipping a small tear from her eyes, “They are having a drink in the private room, would you like to wait for them?” The private room was designed to be used when a high-profile customer makes a special order, that has meant that someone has a special quest for them.

“Just tell them that Cain is outside, they will know what to do!” Cain said with a confident smile, seeing a glimpse of his teeth made Mary feel at ease. For two reasons as most adventures end up losing a tooth or two after a major injury, he seemed to be fine.

~I want to join!~

“Kya!” Yamauba gasped in surprise as she heard Cain’s whispers in her head. Takeshi had already drawn his Nodashi when she signaled to him to relax. “You’re scaring the customer, please Calm down!” Daraku pulled him down, he was disturbing the peace of his negotiation.

“Can you go get Cain in, he is waiting outside.” Yamauba looked at Miko who quickly stood up and slowly walked to the door.

“You have no problem right?” Yamauba looked at their client.

“O-of course. It will b-be my p-pleasure, to see someone that you t-trust!” The woman looked in her late twenties, stuttering her words, she quickly tried to refine her stance.

The woman was the daughter of Isaac Lloyd the owner of the biggest wheat field in all of Furberg. They might not be nobles or merchants, But they were rich enough to be treated as such. Her name was Leyla Lloyd.

Quickly combing her hair back up with her fingers, she sat straight and puffed her chest trying more confident. Her mind was busy thinking of what she will say, it was a friend of Dragon’s fang and she did know what sort of monster would emerge from that door.

“Please don’t get nervous Leyla, your father has been a great friend to us in the past years and we intend to help him with our all,” Yamauba said smiling. Leyla was clearly not used to this, she lived her whole life tending to the field and the cattle. Requesting this must be an alien experience to her, sadly, her father seems to be sick and she has to be the one to do it.

“We say that but, it’s a dragon we’re talking about!” Daraku said putting a leg on the other, “I have no intention of letting Isaac alone but it’s hard to make a decision on the fly!”

Cain had just opened the door and heard the word Dragon He immediately turned around and closed the door.

“Hold up, where do you think you’re going?” Yamauba stood calling him, Cain ignored her and hurried his steps toward the quest wall. Alice, Selena, and Sofia followed him looking at the yelling Yamauba.

“Bring him in, we might need all the help we can take!” Hearing Yamauba’s words, Takeshi quickly grabbed Cain and dragged him into the private room. The girls just followed him without saying a word, if Cain were intending to resist he would have done it.

“Listen, I heard the word Dragon I bet you know how much of a pain they are. I need money but not to the point of risking my life!” Cain said Dragons were a pain in the ass to deal with. The best word to describe them is Extreme If a dragon appeared he would prefer to change direction than to fight it.

“Come on, Winter is close and Lloyd’s farm is an important source of food. This might be an emergency if we can’t deal with it!” Yamauba said, looking at the almost crying Leyla.

“I’m with Cain, fighting it is stupid. We have to change the farm location instead!” Daraku said as he stabbed his knife on the map laid on the table. “Here, all we need to do is clear a couple of goblin dens and some wild monster to have the land useable!”

“I don’t think it’s possible to relocate the farm now, it’s already too late and winter is at the door!” Miko said as she took the knife from Daraku’s hand, “How many times have I told you to not stab the table?” He withered back as she pouted at him.

“Fighting a dragon is hard and tedious, but we have to save Isaac’s farm!” Takeshi stood up putting a hand on his sword hilt.

“Cain, what is the problem with dragons? I know they are strong but you seem, uncomfortable with them…” Sofia asked, Alice and Selena seemed to have the same question.

Cain sighed, “You will know soon.” He then looked at Yamauba, “Do we know its age and element?” Cain asked with a worried face, he wished to hear something nice.

“From her description, we can assume it was an adult red female,” Yamauba said sweating, they before hunted a Young green dragon, this was on a whole another caliber.

“FFS, How much are you paying?” Cain looked at Leyla. She jolted the moment his eyes laid on her, “A-a h-hundred gold p-pieces.” Her teeth were crackling and her knees trembled.

“Even if the pay was a hundred gold pieces and you on top, I would still say it’s not even worth scouting around an adult red! Come on, at least give us five hundred gold pieces those things can level up a city.” Cain wasn’t satisfied, his sharp voice had made Leyla tear up.

“Cain, you went too far. What is so dangerous about dragons to make them worth that high price?” Sofia stepped in to ask and Alice stopped her with a sharp glare, “Please don’t mind her Cain.”

“No she is right, let me explain!”

Dragons are…
