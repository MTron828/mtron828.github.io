Gracie’s eyes glowed purple, it was then that Cain realized what he was making. Marrying a succubus was a death wish for most men. He will be fine now because of his high MP but later when she evolves more, keeping her satisfied will sap him dry.

‘Well, it doesn’t matter, even if she fully evolved I bet she won’t be able to suck more than what her MP poll allows.’ He simply had more than she could suck, as most completely evolved creatures end up with around 4500 MP. The elvish archmage Lilia had around 7000 MP and the dragon king had about 8000 MP. Cain in his prime had over 14000 MP and could even get it to 20000 MP with enchantments and magic items.

‘Yep sucking me dry is impossible!’ Cain thought as he apprised Gracie. He had 3024 MP now while Gracie had 650, she would take at least four days for her to kill him.

“So how would you like to start? Sketchy it may be but you won so you’re going first.” Cain said as he lay on the bed like a dead fish.

Gracie stared at him with a passive face that hid a mountain of disappointment. He could have moved a bit more than that chicken she de-feathered this morning.

She then slowly turned to the side heading to the bedside table. There she grabbed a glass cup and filled it with water. She didn’t know why but she had this weird instinct to poison Cain with her venom before starting to eat.

It was then that it occurred to her, that there is no need to dilute it right?.

Quickly turning toward Cain and approaching his face. Cain immediately realized what she was after and cried. “Hold up, I know you want a kiss but you do remember your poison? It’s bad for my heart you know?”

“It will be fine, you have three.” She whispered as their lips intertwined.

Cain immediately realized this was the first time she kissed something. All she was trying to do is pushing her spit into his mouth with her tongue. But soon enough Cain started feeling less and less need to think and more desire to act, and that was exactly what a succubus wants from her victim.

Gracie opened her eyes glaring at Cain’s face, his eyes still had a spark of light in them. He was just intoxicated as much as he wanted. She knew this was a failed attempt, her instinct told her that if this was in the wild, she would have been killed.

That didn’t matter right now, she was hungry and he was willing to be her dinner.

It was here that her succubus instincts failed her, how was she supposed to eat him? She can’t imagine the normal way working. Probably she needs to only use her mouth?

Cain looked at her sitting still for a moment, her face was passive so he couldn’t guess what she was thinking. If he knew she was confused he could’ve told her all holes will work just fine.

Gracie finally made up her mind to use her mouth at first. In her mind that was the safest bet, she could’ve made.

Cain was determined to let her have her way, he knew she was still trying to understand her succubus side and wanted to give her a chance on her own.

Gracie extended her hands trying to remove his pants, as she tried to pull them down, they were stuck. The belt and something long was keeping them in place. She remembered that Elise was the one who chose Cain’s outfit for the night. That girl will have to wipe the ground alone tomorrow.

Puff! Using her shadows, Gracie sucked Cain’s pants into her shadow and threw them to the ground. As she started at his meat, a thought crossed her head. Will just using her mouth be enough or does she need to do something else? Squeezing it a bit like cow udder or something? Trying won’t hurt so she grabbed his meat and jewels and started quizzing them, when nothing came out she squeezed harder.

“Be a bit gentler if you wanted to use your hands, that’s not a cow udder.” Cain slightly lifted his head, for a moment he was thinking of taking the lead.

It was just for a passing moment but he could swear he has seen a confused face with a blush on her.

Gracie was surprised he read her mind, which only meant one thing. She didn’t intoxicate him enough. She then quickly climbed to his mouth and gave him a second dose hoping it will be enough.

Cain thought she was trying to make off for almost turning his almonds into a paste.

He was then surprised by her squeezing him even harder, what was she thinking?

As Gracie was doing her hardest to get her food, she felt Cain’s hand grab her head. “Stop it with the hands, just use your mouth for a quicker result.” If she kept squeezing him that hard she will never get a single drop out of him. “And speak, I can’t help you if I don’t know what you want.”

Gracie stared at him and then looked at the other girls on the couch as if asking for help. Sofia stayed silent while Alice smiled at her as if not wanting to help.

“Just do as Cain say-nya.” Selena was the one to reply to her, in her eyes that was the easiest way.

Gracie nodded and turned toward Cain. “How do I eat?” It was then that it got apparent to Cain that she was more interested in learning about her succubus side than anything else.

“For now use your mouth as it is what you were intending first, don’t worry about the details as they don’t matter,” Cain said as he helped her head get down with his hand without using any pressure.

As Gracie went to town with her mouth. Cain was surprised by how her mouth felt, unlike Alice and Sofia who felt more like licking, and Selena who had a rough feeling to her tongue. Gracie was more trying to swallow his meat whole.

It didn’t take her long to get him to his limit, unlike what she thought, her toxin was really effective since Cain didn’t do anything for the past three days. He could feel her sucking to the last drop, as she was forcefully forcing it out of him.

Gracie could feel the MP use used to take his pants off get recovered from that and more. Her body felt lighter and her insides started tingling. The purple light in her eyes intensified as the smell of what she just swallowed penetrated her brain. She wanted more but those feeling made her hesitant.

“Come here, I will take your outfit off.” Cain stood and turned her around. His hands started undoing the straps on her uniform with precision.

Each time his hand touched her hips a spark stings her insides. For a moment she wished he will just tear her uniform award and rush at her but that thought quickly faded. Images from her past forced her body to calm down and return to its emotionless state for a moment.

Thump! Thump! She could hear her heart slowly speeding up, with each beat the blood rushed to her head. Her body immediately started getting aroused again and then being calmed by her memories. As those feelings kept clashing inside her head, she heard a second snapping sound in her head.

“Does it really matter anymore?” Gracie mumbled and Cain heard her. He looked up at her back and felt her presence completely disappear.

Gracie looked back on her past and smiled, she was happy that was already in the past and will never come back. She had already killed that thing so she held no grudges against it anymore but instead she had become something similar.

Her shadows consumed her clothes only leaving her stocking on as she turned toward Cain with an ecstatic smile. She gently leaned over him putting a leg on the bed and a leg on the ground.

Selena was surprised to see Gracie acting like that, the rest simply smiled.

Gracie pushed Cain down and licked his lips as she went for a third kiss. Her hips already consumed his meat. “Master…give me more!” She moaned.

Alice’s thoughts best described what happened to Gracie. ‘She had come to terms with her past and accepted her future as a succubus. She is now free.’
