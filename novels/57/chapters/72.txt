It didn’t take Them that long to reach the mine, the entrance was filled with adventurers who came to test their bones. It was rare to have a chance to fight monsters while having the guild’s full force nearby. If any low-rank adventure got into trouble, all he needs to do is scream, and the whole guild would come to the rescue.

“See, we would be safe even if we got into trouble,” Cain said as he approached the entrance.

“You might have a point-nya.” Selena replied as she took a deep breath at the entrance “It smells of blood-nya!” She said as her whole body tensed up, she knew that things could get bad quickly, having the guild close didn’t mean the chances of getting killed were any lower.

“Since it’s a tight cave we need to take the same battle formation as when we fought the goblins?” Sofia asked, drawing the formation on the dusty ground with her staff.

“If we got alone I would like to fight as well, I’m sure my [Cursed Decay] can be used as an attack spell!” Alice suggested, channeling some cursed magic in her hand. Cain quickly stopped her as this was not the place to do it.

The mine entrance seemed as safe as it should be if you ignored all the injured adventurers, A warzone was inside.

ZIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! Cain slowly pushed the door open after getting the guild representative’s permission. Having the hydra slaying party joins the expedition was something they couldn’t refuse.

The old wooden door cracked as it revealed the dimly lit cave inside, all the carts and mining equipment have been cleared out to make moving easier.

“Stay alert, even if the guild has cleared the area close to the entrance, some monster could steal sneak upon us.” Cain calmly warned them that this was a dangerous area.

There were multiple things they had to keep in mind, they can’t just use [Darkvision] because the other adventurer couldn’t see them, and the last thing they want is being sniped by an arrow.

Alice as well couldn’t revert to her devil form, they might be seen and that will be a big problem. They have to take short rests every so often to help her relax.

They were given a map but that didn’t mean they are immune to getting lost, Cain needs to keep track of every step they take. He also couldn’t do cast spells as he might cause a collapse.

Selena was keeping track of the entrance smell so she can be a backup in case they got lost. Making sure to not bite a monster that shouldn’t be bitten, like an acidic slime or a venomous frog was also a concern.

Cain knew well what they must do, never sheath their weapons and be ready all the time. Slowly progressing toward the new tunnel.

“Don’t use magic in weak monsters, save you’re MP to when we find something big!” Cain told them, they have a limited MP and they use it to its full potential.

“A slime, should we kill it?” Sofia asked readying her staff to smack the thing. Cain just nodded at her, the slime was small enough for her to kill without magic.

Sofia just hit it as hard as she could with her staff destroying the core, she looked at Cain in excitement. She was happy she managed to kill a monster without magic, it was like an achievement for a mage.

“Even children could do it-nya.” Selena burned her happiness with a single sentence, and she was right, a slime of that size could easily be hunted by a kid.

On their way to the tunnel, they met a lot of wounded adventurers making their way out. large bite wounds and lost limbs, and broken bones. Their flesh looked as if it was pulled out.

“Let’s hurry, the situation on the frontline doesn’t seem that nice.” Cain urged them to quicken up. They thought he was worried about the other adventurers, he was instead worried they will take all of his Exp. Having just three months to level up made every bit of exp priceless.

They could hear the monster growl in the distance, muffled by the adventurers’ scream. The pain cry made Sofia’s bone shudder, she could feel her stomach twisting and throbbing.

“I don’t feel well, my stomach is hurting,” Sofia complained to Cain, she wasn’t ready to have her limbs torn off like those adventurers.

Cain looked at her for a moment, thinking about what to say. He knew it was just anxiety and fear, he needed a way to take her mind off those.

‘Let’s try and make her either angry or embarrassed, those should be able to make her feel better’ Cain had the rudest, embarrassing and weird thing to ask of a girl and get on her nerve easily.

“Toilet it is? Sadly there is none here, just do it in the corner there, we don’t mind!” Cain pointed to a corner that was exposed like a stage.

“He is right, we’ve already been with each other long enough to make it normal, I for one don’t mind you watching me do it!” Alice said, being controlled by Cain. For a moment, Alice’s mind freaked out as she lost control but quickly regain her composure. Seeing your body move and talk on its own wasn’t a pleasant experience.

“Y-yeah-nya!” Selena wasn’t comfortable with that but seeing both Cain and Alice agree, she steeled herself that it was the norm.

Sofia’s face turned bright red as she backed off whizzing. “No, no. no! How come that?” There was no way Cain was serious, she didn’t even need the toilet, just her tummy was hurting.

“I can use [Create water] to help you clean if that’s your concern.” Cain calmly walked to her, trying to guide her up.

“Stop, I don’t want to do that!” she screamed trying to push Cain away.

Cain could hardly stop himself from laughing at her expression, she had forgotten her fear it seems and was concentrating on him now.

“Being filled in combat is a death sentence. For your safety and life, I will make sure you do it here and now, whether you like it or not!” Cain grabbed her hand and dragged her to the corner.

[Earth wall], [Earth wall], [Earth wall] using his magic, Cain created a box for her use. “What are you waiting for? get in so I can close the last wall!” Cain said pushing her inside.

“Huh?” She looked at him in surprise as he locked her in.

Cain quickly pushed his hand through one of the walls, It was his magic and he could deform it to an extent “For water, you have to cope with my hand being with you, just tap it when you need some!” Cain told her, weirdly weaving his fingers.

Cain expected her to want to get out, but to his surprise, she used it!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Sofia didn’t feel nervous and her stomach calmed down, it was probably a combination of fear and the meat they ate earlier.

Cain did explain to her what happened later, It was best to clear the fact about Alice being controlled by him to say what she said. He did get a few pinches from the two girls.

Soon enough they reached the battlefield or a corner as they were in a tight cave, a group of adventurers was fighting cave alligators and were losing. They could see one of them get bitten in the leg and have it torn apart as the monster rolled.

The girls sprung into formation, ready to fight.

“Leave it to me, I already missed fighting those little troubles makers!” Cain said smiling, he slowly walked toward the alligators with his sword in hand.

Seeing them was like seeing a slime on the farmland, he last fought them when he was going to William’s mansion.

“Cain, Ahead of you!” Alice screamed as she saw a big one rush at him.

Smiling, Cain just weaved to the side gracefully, his sword gently slid inside the monster’s maw, effortlessly slicing its upper jaw.

“they might be strong but they are slow because of their weight and shape, Their movements are simple enough for me to read and react to without the need of magic!” Cain declared as he jumped into the fight.

The girls and the other adventurers just stood there watching him slice and dice as if it was nothing.
