After leaving Diana to her business, Cain started sneaking around the house looking for the other maids to give them keys to the lights he is installing in the whole house.

As Cain walked into the hallway, he heard the sound of someone cleaning the dishes. He slowly walked to the kitchen. On the counter stood a tall, pale maid with orange hair and slender arms washing the dishes in the light of a single candle.

‘Isn’t that Ellie? She didn’t like being around me or Sebas, butter not surprise her.’ Cain was about to call her but she then suddenly stopped moving her hands.

For a moment, Cain felt threatened as he looked at her back. He instantly apprised her but got nothing special except, [Blood deficiency] explaining her pale look.

CRACK! In a single quick step, Ellie turned around throwing a dish directly behind her.

Cain smiled at the attack, it was impressive. He was standing in the dark so she couldn’t see him yet the dish is flying directly at his throat. It may be luck but that could have saved her life was he an intruder.

[Telekinesis] was useful once again to catch the plate without breaking it. Cain lit the light with the ceramic plate floating around him. “Calm down Ellie, it’s just me. At least give me a chance to call you out.”

At that moment Ellie realized what happened and she proceeded to apologize but Cain stopped her. “Don’t worry about it, I do like girls who can handle themselves. That throw was really impressive.”

Even though the power was weak, the precision was beyond what he expected from a human let alone a maid. It could also be just luck, but that would be a lot of amazing luck..

Ellie looked at his thinking about the ladies, except Marina who was added just lately, the other four are strong. They keep hearing explosions when Sofia was training, Gracie is untouchable unless she wanted, and Selena was the biggest menace to the maids.

They once tried to teach her how to eat with a knife and fork but she ended up biting a chunk of the fork off. They also once found her sharpening her claws on iron beams of the well, that thing still has holes in it.

“What are you sneaking around for at this hour?” Ellie asked, trying to change the subject because she would have lost her job if this was Sebas.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Just installing some lights around the house, do you wear any jewelry so I can give you the ability to light them?”

Cain said looking at the gold necklace she was wearing. A simple chain with a heart dangling from it.

“Of course, just let me take it off.” Ellie was surprisingly obedient, he expected her to refuse.

After Cain finished enchanting her necklace and explaining how it works, he finally asked the question he wanted to ask. “Are you eating well? I see you have blood deficiency. You seem to have even lost some weight”

Ellie was taken aback by his words, almost reaching for another plate. “Just a diet to shave some fat, nothing to worry about.” She replied.

“I never heard of diets causing blood deficiency…just eat a bit more, you look better with a bit of meat on your bones.”

Cain stared at her slender frame, she would look far better if she got a tad bit wider.

“I will try, just don’t go around apprising girls to see if they fit your fancy.” She stared at him, she clearly hated being looked at her stats.

“I simply did it because you looked too skinny in my eyes, if you were sick, it’s better to find and heal it early,” Cain said looking at her. “Your health takes priority.”

Ellie sighed, “You’re right, I guess I shouldn’t fault you.”

Cain smiled, “Then please have a wonderful night, I shall go find the others.” He turned around to leave.

“Master…” Cain heard her call him, when he turned around she was bowing as deep as she could.

“Please forgive my earlier rudeness, I shall accept any punishment you desire.”

“Don’t mind it, just eat and get better.” Cain smiled as he left. If this was any noble beside him she might have ended up getting whipped for almost breaking his throat.

Ellie looked at Cain leaving while she thought it was a shame, she couldn’t ask him for help. It was her problem and she will get shunned if it came to light. ‘I should find something to eat already, I will be killed if I made another mistake.’ Ellie thought with a sad smile as she watched Cain’s back as he walked into the pitch dark hallway.

Cain was walking away with a smile on his face, for some reason his instincts are screaming at her. He wanted to dig into her skin and find why he was getting that feeling, ‘She has something, and I better keep an eye on her just in case.’ Arcane eye. He sent an invisible magical eye to observe her at all times.

Ellie stopped working for a moment as the eye reached her back, Cain could see her wanting to turn back and stopping at the last moment.

‘Jackpot, sensing me at least wasn’t a fluke. Or she might just have an extreme sense for men’s gaze.’ Cain thought.

As he was keeping an eye on Ellie, he walked inside the maid’s quarter, the place where their personal rooms are to look for them.

Knock! Knock! Cain knocked lightly on the first door he found. Two gentle hits are enough, if he didn’t get a reply they were asleep and he should leave them.

“Who is it?” Katherine replied from the inside, the maid who was sharing Cain in eating vegetables like a rabbit.

“It’s me, Cain, do you have a moment?” Cain asked.

“Well, of course, get in!” She replied immediately.

As soon as he opened the door he could see her. Doing push-ups in her underwear.

“What are you doing? And why did you let me in?” Cain asked, he did see the panties of two maids in a single night which was weird.

“My daily training, I shouldn’t skimp up on it even on the busy days. Also, I signed the contract, I wouldn’t mind you seeing me naked.” She replied without stopping her push-ups, Cain sat on the bed and turned the light on.

Katherine was training in the dark because of the lack of candles at this time, Cain should implant lights in the whole mansion.

Now that the lights were on, Cain could see the tan lines on Katherine’s body. He could see the traces of her maid uniform and the tans of something else.

“This is amazing!” Katherine said as she finished her push-ups and sat cross-legged. “Would you mind coming more often?” She looked at him with a smile, “Or did you come for a late-night service?”

“No, I was implanting those lights in the whole mansion since I have an empty night. Do you have any jewelry?” Cain asked.

Katherine scratched her head, “I don’t usually like to wear them as I feel they are annoying, but I do have a ring tucked out in one of the drawers.” Katherine stood and went to search for it.

“You will need it to control the light, can you wear it?” Cain asked.

“I can, and if it annoyed me I will just throw it in my pocket.” Katherine replied and after a few seconds, “Found it!” She handed Cain a simple silver ring.

Cain quickly enchanted it and handed it to her after explaining how it works.

Katherine looked amazed as she turned the lights on and off like crazy, “I’m happy you liked it, please have a good night.” Cain stood up to leave.

“A good night to you as well master!” Katherine smiled looking at Cain with her blue eyes. Her short brown hair flowed through the winds coming from the window.
