“GI!” Takeshi screamed as he swung down his Nodashi at Jack, Just the wind generated by the strike was enough to shake the trees! Jack docked to dodge the attack!

Not giving him anytime to rest, a swing after the other, each slash holing the weight of a mountain.

“Leading the bandits, thieving and deceiving the people! You have lost you integrity!” Takeshi screamed again, his hard deep voice seems to shake the ground!

Jack who was just dodging finally attacked back, a claw strike with his deformed hand. Takeshi managed to catch it, headbutting him instantly, and he gave him a second one sending him backward.

“REI!” Another shout that held enough power to make the ground rumble, Takeshi has already reached Jack.

“By committing those acts you have abandoned all your respect toward the people! A mere ungrateful criminal who disgraced the city that fed him!” Takeshi switched to gripping his Nodashi with just one hand, swinging at Jack with his other hand just like his blade.

Jack’s speed seemed to be increasing with each passing second, what was this Demonoid thing? Takeshi could only swing harder and faster.

On the other hand, Jack has drawn his second blade and started chain slashing with claw strikes. The fight between them was turning in a dance of fists and blades that no one dared to get close to.

“MEIYO!” Another sky rumbling shout, Like the violent screech of a winter storm.

Takeshi has gripped his Nodashi with two hands again, delivering a downward slash!

Jack saw the attack coming so he dodged by taking a step backward, waiting for Takeshi’s sword to get stuck on the ground to counter.

As the Nodashi touched the ground it didn’t get stuck, instead sliced right through! Continuing in a single motion, Takeshi’s spun around chaining another strike, and another one, and another one…

Jack could only keep jumping backward as he tried to run from this spinning, earth shattering plower.

“Experimenting on you own sister, you have lost all of your honor!” Jack seem to have told them the details at some point, was it when he called them? It didn’t matter now as Takeshi was pissed!

“What are you talking about? That isn’t any of you business!” Jack replied, as if he owns the world. That only fueled Takeshi’s rage.

“JIN!” As he was literally shattering the ground after Jack, Takeshi screamed again. His voice was loud enough to mute the chaos he was causing.

“You didn’t have any compassion for you own family, neither you did for your victims! How could you even call yourself a human?” Takeshi switched his form again to a one handed grip, A leg at the back and one at the front! Each time he flexed his muscle his body is launch toward Jack with a singular powerful thrust!

Jack’s power seemed to be growing, It’s source was still unknown and it’s limits were nowhere to be seen! The only person who could explain and tell it’s weakness was probably Cain. The man still laying unconscious as Miko is trying to heal him.

“Can’t you shut up for a moment? You’re annoying!” Jack managed to dodged one of the thrusts without backing down and countered with a straight kick to the face.

In the last fraction of a second before it could connect to Takeshi’s face, he moved his head slightly to the side!

Squash! Takeshi grabbed Jacks leg and screamed, “MAKOTO!” Stomping Jack to the ground as if he was a carpet. Thud! Thud! THUD!! One stomp after the other.

“Be honest and sincere in your life!” Takeshi kicked him across the court yard as if he was a ball.

“You hul…!” Before Jack could even speak he was hit with a [Fireburst], Yamauba wasn’t going to let any chance pass! If Takeshi was a safe distance from Jack she would attack.

After getting burned, Jack turned toward Yamauba with anger flashing in his eyes. “You bitch!!!” He screamed, just to be hit with Leon’s [Lightning Burst]

Jack was about to lunge at them but he felt something grabbing him from the head, “Bastard what did you call my woman?” Takeshi was already behind him.

“CHU!” If Jack wasn’t a Demonoid, Takeshi’s scream would have blown his ear drum, He could feel it shaking his bones.

Takeshi threw Jack by his hair to the ground, Swiftly yet Gracefully swinging his Nodashi without breaking his posture! The attacks seemed masterful, unlike before, he looked as if he was dancing with a woman more than fighting.

“Going against your duty as the hier, breaking your own family! Your lack of Loyalty shall never be forgiven!” Takeshi screamed as his strikes chased after the dodging Jack.

His speed kept increasing with each strike, to the point his Nodashi was making a constant painful whistling sound as it followed each of Jack’s movements.

Jack didn’t manage to get out unscathed from this and ended losing an arm!

Jack was getting sick of this, not as he wasn’t already sick of it! It just kept increasing!

His transformation was yet to be complete, The more time pass the more strength he will get! To break the final stage he needs the blood of devil, he has to reach Alice no matter what!

He has been working on this body for over 20 Years and wasn’t about give it up! Jack wanted to transform his body to that of an immortal devil yet he wasn’t ready to give his soul out!

The last, unobtainable ingredient he needed was a devil blood! He couldn’t just take the blood from a summoned devil as it will disappear when the spells ends!

He needed something more permanent! A devil that is living in this world! Yet a feat like that was almost impossible, he couldn’t find one no matter how much he searched! Until a fateful day arrived.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

When he was outside the city alongside his gang, they were attacked by a wondering witch that violated their entire group! Jack though she was definitely a devil and tried to get her blood.

Being amused by his action, she decided to play with him even more! Lastly she taught him how to summon a devil into a humans body, an unborn baby to be exact! Nonetheless, she didn’t teach him the full spell as she had already got bored from him before that!

That wondering witch, after leaving Jack with both a mental and a physical scare, she just disappeared back into the forest!

After debating with himself for months, he finally decided to do it! He performed the spell on his still unborn sister, killing both her and his mother! Yet the child was born, was it a human or a devil? only the coming years could tell!

“I’m finally this close, you ain’t stopping me!” Jack screamed as his arm regrew back, he was getting out of hand!

“YU!” This last scream seemed to silence the entire world, Takeshi has put his entire power into this charge! As unusual it might be for a warrior, he dropped his Nodashi and was going hand to hand fight.

“You lacked the courage of a warrior to face you own weakness, reaching to evil for power is a disgrace to humanity as a whole!” Swinging his fist directly at Jack’s face, a human was fighting an unknown monster with his bare hands.

A straight punch, followed with a left hook and a spinning kick. Lastly a barrage of quick and heavy jabs and a headbutt to top it off!

Takeshi was totally dominating the fight, reminding each soldier watching with how he fights! Previously in the guild, the two soldier that were with jack got terrified when they saw Takeshi interfere, It was because they saw him fight before!

There was no chance they could take him on even if the whole battalion was there!
