Cain absolutely dreaded them, whether they were considered monsters, demons, or devils, it didn’t matter. Normal people could hold to the hope of fighting one of the same genders, a male adventurer would prefer to fight an incubus for example. Cain on the other hand knew the truth, Cubuses are gender-less, they simply take the opposite gender of their target. If a Cubus was fighting a woman, it will appear as an incubus, if it was a man then a succubus.

Cain’s team contained three women and he was the only male, the possibility of the Cubus appearing as an incubus is very high. That was bad news as the girls simply don’t have what it takes to resist a 20 charisma.

He might be able to keep Alice safe by controlling her directly but the other two just can’t resist. The moment the Incubus appears, those two will go into heat instantly.

The Cubuses freely control their gender to gain an advantage in battle, this is going to go badly, and Cain could feel it in his bones.

But this was their only way out, surely past the Cubus layer, they will find an exit.

“You stay here, I will rise a tower for you to rest,” Cain told them to wait, he didn’t want to take them to such a dangerous place.

“Where are you going? Does it relate to that Cubus thing you just talked about?” Sofia asked, they are still oblivious to what he was meaning.

‘Good, this works in my favor.’ Cain got happy as he could convince them to stay put.

With a single flick of his fingers, Cain erected a tower for them. “Yes it is, the monster is quite sneaky with its magic. It will be dangerous to fight him without extensive arcane knowledge.”

Cain quickly left after that, leaving them in the tower. They were clearly worried about him going alone but they didn’t have anything to say, all they could do was trust him for the time being.

…

As Cain kept following the succubus’s magic, he started to think it was weird. The magic was abnormally weak. Cubuses are spellcasters specializing in charm and attack magic, an experienced mage could sense them for hundreds of meters.

Cain just wasn’t feeling, instead of it being hot, it felt lukewarm. The only two possibilities are tied to it starving, it’s either too young to feed, or it’s an adult that hasn’t eaten in years. It was concerning, depending on what it is, Cain could be in big trouble.

A young Cubus is easy to deal with as they still haven’t developed their charm magic, that would be a preferable outcome. On the other hand, if it was a starving adult, it could lead to a rough fight.

When Cubus feed, they suck the life force of their prey, stats. Starting from MP to HP. As it knew about stats, when your MP reaches 0 you pass out, and when your HP reaches 0 you die.

A single round absorbs about 10 MP, which means that Cain could go for 72 rounds with his absurdly high MP. In case he lost the fight.

Since they have already sensed the magic, the Succubus wasn’t far away, just a couple of minutes walk.

Cain stopped in his track, looking through a small crack in the wall. What was beyond looked nothing like the dreaded cave he was in? The walls were chiseled and carved into beautiful works of art, lit by braziers of crimson flame that glittered on the finely crafted wooden furniture.

Most importantly, the smell, the place had a pleasant lavender aroma to it. It was the Cubus’s love nest, it had it prepared marvelously.

With caution Cain quickly and silently carved his way inside, making sure to use as little magic as he can. Cubuses are sensitive to magic the same way humans are to sound, you could wake them by trying to cast a spell.

Cain walked silently, searching for the monster. He can’t hear moaning so the Cubus was most likely sleeping, those creatures are horny 20/7. If they weren’t feeding, they will play with themselves as a pass time.

‘If I could just get a sneak strike in, I will kill it in one hit.’ Cain thought, waking the Cubus will be dangerous. ‘I hope he is in his incubus or gender-less form, I doubt I could resist a 20 charisma succubus!’ Cain prayed.

On the left side, he discovered an empty prison quarter, most likely where it kept his prey. Taking a look around, It didn’t seem to have been used in ages. ‘Is it a hunter?’ Cain thought the most common for Cubuses was to kidnap someone and keep them like cattle for a couple of days, then hunt a second one…

This one seems to be an active hunter, meaning it goes outside to feed each time. Otherwise, it will be weird for it to have no prisoners.

In some parts of the world, Cubuses who integrated into society can work as prostitutes.

By doing that they could be accepted back into society, It wasn’t that weird. Being served by them was a cut above the other prostitutes, to the point it wasn’t even funny.

Fun fact, a weird trend started to emerge. Elderly people and those who have incurable illnesses and want to go pleasantly start seeking the Cubus service. It’s when you pay a Cubus to kill you, Death by snu snu. That is a thing, one of Cain’s friends who got poisoned with a deadly poison went that way. He paid 8 succubuses to take his life, yeah, that many were needed to drain him to death.

Without long, Cain spotted the Cubus. Laying on its back on a stone slab, it looked like a corpse. Pale white skin, bald head, and no distinctive features. It was only wearing a tattered piece of white rag.

Looking like a foam mannequin, It was still in its gender-less form. Cain breathed in relief, preparing the Sylph’s tiny hut spell, he didn’t cast it but just made it ready in case.

Cain silently walked toward the Cubus, brandishing his dagger. ‘I will make it quick.’ Cain stabbed the sleeping monster right in the chest.

Clang! The body was nowhere to be seen, Cain only struck the slap. Cain started to feel cold sweat running down his spine, the Cubus woke up.

“Who is it this piping hot piece of flesh.” The soothing voice of a woman could be heard booming in the chamber, Just that alone was enough to get Cain ready for action.

Tap! Cain heard the sound of something landing on the ground, he didn’t dare look behind him.

Trrrrtec! Trrrrtak! Cain was certain it has already taken the shape of a succubus, he could hear her knocking her fingers on something.

“You woke up quickly!” Cain said, trying to buy time for himself to think of something.

“I mean, I couldn’t bear your smell.” The succubus giggled, licking her lips loud enough for him to hear it. “That big, thick, and refined Mana. I could swear it doesn’t belong to a human.” She said, wiggling her hips as they started to tingle.

‘She is that sensitive? To the point of knowing my Mana quality?’ Cain was surprised, she even caught his Mana being abnormal. He was a reincarnated Enchanter, after all, comparing his Mana purity and density is like comparing refined Jade to a rock.

“I was always lucky to be born with it!” Cain replied, keeping an eye on the succubus’s shadow.

“Stop with the lies, little boy.” She smirked, “Not looking at me even in your condition is a testament to your experience.” The succubus pointed out, that even from his armor, she could smell Cain’s excitement.

“I came to kill you, I gotta at least be able to do that!” Cain replied, thinking to make her get as close as possible so he can slice it with a single strike.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I don’t think so darling, will you become my slave? I promise to treat you gently!” She was oddly talkative, Cain took it as a sign of weakness, she is buying time just like he is.

“Sorry, I have other things on my mind!” Cain replied, getting ready to strike.

“It’s a shame, I will take my time playing with you then!” She said, Thud! Cain heard her jump.

She is going to strike, Cain could see her shadow getting smaller in the blink of an eye.

[Sylph’s tiny hut] [Elemental blade: Fire] Cain didn’t have time to draw his sword so he just conjured one with magic.

Clang! Cain’s blade was stopped by her bare feet. Before Cain could get a good look at her, she kicked him in the face with an incredible amount of strength sending him flying backward.

Tap! The succubus landed gracefully, like a beautiful butterfly, she licked her fingers. “Let’s play, I can’t take it anymore!” She said. A mad smile on her face.
