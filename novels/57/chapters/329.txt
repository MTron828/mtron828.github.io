“You won’t get away with him!” Alice teleported right to Cain. Quickly snatching him from Gracie’s hands.

In the next moment, Gracie leaped into her own shadow and appeared underneath Alice’s legs. A single upward kick to the back end was enough to send Alice flying.

BANG! Alice’s head hit the ceiling as she lost Cain. Gracie leaped toward Cain to catch him.

“He’s mine-nya!” Selena leaped from the other side of the bath at an extreme speed and grabbed Cain mid-air.

It’s not like Cain can’t stop them, he knew better than anyone that they aren’t serious. He might as well let them play a bit, also he found it a bit fun being tossed around.

Thud! Thud! Sofia slowly walked from the door in her half-dragon form. Cain instantly realized that she wasn’t playing around, He might as well stop this whole thing.

Opposite to what he expected, Sofia walked toward the bath calmly and placed her hand inside the water. CRACK! The water around her palm quickly froze and she lifted an ice chunk the size of a sheep.

CRACKLE! With a burst of flame from her hand, the Ice immediately melted. She then flapped her wings as hard as she could before the water could fall splashing it all over Cain and the girls.

Gracie tried to knock Sofia into the water so she charged while using the mist as cover.

Sofia’s draconic eyes chased Gracie’s movements. Thud! Gracie’s fist ended up in Sofia’s palm, “I can see you!” Sofia then used her arms and wings to throw Gracie into the water and then fly toward Selena.

Alice quickly manifested her wings and rushed at Sofia.

“Stop!” Everything stopped moving at Cain’s words. Alice and Sofia were suspended mid-air while Gracie was stopped in the middle of using her shadow to teleport. Selena who was grabbing Cain found herself unable to move a muscle as her entire body felt numb.

Cain was floating cross-legged in the middle, “Wait until we reach the bed, keep this and we’ll have Zaleria barging in to check what is happening.”.

“What did you use?” Alice asked as she couldn’t move, she was supposed to be a devil so normal paralyze magic shouldn’t work on her.

“[Hold Monster] For Selena, Sofia, and Gracie. I used the slave link for you. And all of you are suspended mid-air with [Telekinesis] and I’m using [Fly]” Cain explained as he put the four of them down, he emitted to tell them that none of them even tried to resist his spells which surprised him.

Alice and Sofia quickly shifted back to their human form.

As let everyone down, he looked at them “Let’s get out, we have to finish dinner quickly.” He could see that he had a long night awaiting him.

Alice filled Cain in about what they had planned tomorrow as they were having dinner (She want to get it over with before they go to the bed)

Tomorrow was the day of confirming the vow, going to the church to get the engagement official before they could start the wedding with all the bells and whistles. They first need to heat to Ourals to Grab Marina and then go back to Furberg Church where the head priest will be waiting. As the church said before. They are willing to do the ritual in secret.

If Chauntea agreed to allow Cain to marry the five of them, the church will then carry out a second public ritual. If she refused they can call it off without embarrassing their reputation of trying something forbidden and having the goddess tell them down.

Everything should go smoothly as Alice had prepared for this day for over a week.

The only uncertain part was Chauntea’s approval which Cain seemed to be optimistic about. As long as he had created the waypoints. And is working in the favor of the gods against the dragons she should have no problem allowing the marriage.

“But what if she didn’t?” Alice asked with a worried face, that was still a possibility.

“Then we can get Amaterasu to do it, it’s not like it has to be Chauntea.” Said Cain as he sipped his tea, he needed that after sleeping for a whole three days.

“By the way. Where did father go?” Cain asked Sebas.

“Lord Chad went out drinking with a friend of his, it’s the blacksmith named Dolrig. He said that he will return a bit late.” Sebas took a breath and continued “Lady Zaleria is taking a nap on the rooftop.”

Cain smiled, He didn’t need to tell Sebas to keep an eye on them. “What about Hati? I didn’t see her…”

“She is already asleep in her room, she wakes a bit before dawn and falls asleep before dusk. I have never seen such a schedule in my life.” Sebas replied.

“Sebas, don’t you have papers to tend to?” Alice glared at him.

“No My lady, I always finish my work,” Sebas replied proudly, such a hardworking butler should be praised.

“No, you have work to do! I might have accidentally burned them so go take a look!” Sofia told him with a sharp glare.

“You don’t have to worry about that, I have a second copy of all the important documents.” Sebas smiled, he even got to flex his work even more.

Elise sighed and walked toward Sebas. “Why did you get out of the line?” Sebas glared at her, the maids should stay in line in case the master needed something.

“Doing my job…” Elise put her hand on his shoulder, “Listen, I will say it directly, stop talking and get to your office, you’re disturbing master Cain more than you need.”

Sebas glared at her confused, is there something that he is missing?

“Look, Lady Selena’s teeth are already out, you better get moving before she added you to her dinner.” Klara walked out of the line as well. The maids seemed to understand the ladies better than him.

And with that, Sebas headed toward his office with a sad face.

“Thank you!” Alice thanked the maids.

“Don’t mind it, it’s our work.” Elise smiled as she walked toward them, we already prepared the room for you so you can head up now.”

The girls then dragged Cain to the bedroom. They didn’t want to wait any longer.

CRACK! Alice closed and locked the door as they all went inside. She turned around and looked at Cain who was just sitting on the bed. He looked on the verge of laughing all the time with a faint smile.

Sofia stretched her arms and twisted her back a little, she was rearing to go but they still have to decide the order.

“Rock paper scissors by elimination, the last remaining one gets to go first!” Sofia said racking her knuckles.

She didn’t choose that for luck, with her enchanted draconic senses she should be able to see what they have chosen at the last moment and change her hand.

The girls all faced each other with a smile, lifting their fists. Rock! Paper! Scissor!

Alice: Paper +1-1=0

Sofia: Scissor +2-1= 1

Gracie Paper +1 -1= 0

Selena: Rock +1 -2= -1

“Nya!?” Selena got eliminated first as she is the only one who participated without trying to cheat.

“What is this-nya?” Selena cried.

“You’re going last.” Sofia looked at her with a smile.

Rock! Paper! Scissor!

Alice: Rock

Sofia: Paper

Gracie Rock

“Haha, I won again!” Sofia smiled but Gracie stared at her, “look closely.”

When Sofia looked down, the hands have changed.

Alice: Scissor

Sofia: Paper

Gracie: Scissor

“I have seen you change your hand at the last moment, if using your dragon senses is allowed then I can use illusion right?” Gracie asked with a passive face.

“Sofia eliminated!” Alice smiled.

Sofia silently went to sit on the couch beside Selena. She didn’t have anything to say as she was cheating, Cain was watching s making a fuss will only backfire.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“It’s just the two of us, let’s do the last one fair and square. By the way, won’t you allow the lady of the house to have a pass?” Alice tried her luck even if she knew the answer is going to be a no.

“I don’t mind, going in second place is already good enough for me. But we have to play the last round, I will use paper.” Gracie replied with a passive face surprising Alice. Cain was smiling in the background.

Alice tried to use her wisdom to discern if Gracie was trying to trick her but sensed nothing. For all, she could tell, Gracie was genuine in her offer.

Rock! Paper! Scissor!

Alice: Scissor!

Gracie: Rock!

Alice’s face paled as she saw the evil smile on Gracie’s face. Cain did say that her emotional problem will be solved once she evolves but Alice didn’t expect something like this. She can now understand emotions and use them to her advantage while keeping her emotionless stats so no one can guess what she is feeling or thinking.

Gracie’s eyes quickly shifted toward Cain with a passive face, “Dinner.” They started to glow purple.
