Morena watched her core shatter like a glass cup. “Sorry, I didn’t expect it to crack when pulling it out.” Gracie apologized again.

CRACKLE! Morena’s body flashed with necrotic energy as she tried to transform to her draconic form. She doesn’t have much time, she has to repair the phylactery before she dies.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Thud! Chad smacked her head to the ground, “Like I will let you do that!” [Banishing Smite] Chad only needed to use his fists.

“How could a human like you stand to a dragon?” Morena growled as she created a staff of acid and swung it at Chad.

THWACK! Chad grabbed the staff with his bare hand. “Does a father need a reason to beat those who harmed his child?” Chad stood tall in front of Morena.

Morena’s eyes opened wide, she finally realized what the problem with this man is. “I see, that doesn’t answer my question though.”

Their will started to clash. Morena was the one to start and try using her charisma on chad, she might be able to win like that.

When Chad felt her trying to seduce him, he unleashed his charisma to its utmost limit while using his wisdom to counter Morena. He didn’t forget to exclude Gracie, otherwise, Cain will kill him for sure.

Morena’s vision turned white, she could only see Chad. “Ah, is that you my god?” She called gently as Chad stabbed her heart with his fist.

Morena’s body started to disintegrate as his [Banishing Smite] started to erase her existence from the mortal world. Now that she has no phylactery she will die for real.

At the last moment, Zaleria caught up with them. She blitzed through the cave chasing Chad’s smell until she reached the room.

“So it’s already over?” Zaleria said with a sad face as she saw her sister’s body disintegrating into ash. Slowly walking to her, “I know you might not deserve it, but please rest in peace.”

“She better do, I heard for the maid that she came back to life!” Chad said with an exhausted face. From what he heard and knew about dragons. He wouldn’t care if she went to heaven as long as she will not come back.

“You know, it says a lot when even she can read the mood better.” Zaleria stared at Gracie and then glared at Chad.

“But am I wrong? You didn’t even come here to mourn her, you came to put an end to her life in case I failed.” Chad hit the spot, Zaleria was only fulfilling her role as a sister.

Zaleria sighed, “You’re right, you could say I’m just fulfilling my mother’s wish. Even though we were like this, she loved both of us equally.” Zaleria said with a sad face.

Chad stared at her in silence, “Sorry for that, may she rest in peace.”

…

Morena opened her eyes to a strange scenery. A deserted land with rocky Mountains that spread as far as her eyes could see. Lighting zapped between the high peaks and the ground was covered with puddles of lava and acid. Small weird creatures flew through the sky and looked down upon her.

“Ey yee, Ey yee! A new soul worm, let’s take it to the hatchery!” The little creature swopped down toward Morena.

‘Soul worm?’ She looked down at herself, she was in her humanoid body and could still feel her draconic form. Surprisingly she felt alive more than dead.

As the creatures landed they stared at her in surprise, “A human? What a rare sight. You cattle always end up as worms here. Gehee, anyway it doesn’t matter. Drag her to the hatchery.” The little creature laughed mocking Morena’s hideous body.

Morena knew well she had a striking body, she was certain the thing had a weird taste. “Where are we? This place doesn’t seem inviting.” Morena asked with a smile.

The creature stared at her and snorted, “I guess I could do you a favor and answer your question since you gave me a laugh. This is the first circle of hell, Avernus!” The goblin-like creature spread his arms as if asking for a hug.

“Yeah and that’s it, you better laugh now if you can. That’s such a precious thing in this world of suffering.” One of the creatures said.

Morena stared at them and smiled, “So you’re devils? Imps I say. Nice to meet you and farewell then, I will be making my own way here.” Morena stretched her body and took a deep breath of the disgusting air.

“Make your own way? That’s big words for a mere worm. And stop twisting your body it’s gross!” The creature turned its face away.

At that moment Morena’s body swelled into her draconic form in an instant. In an instant, the magic releasing from her body created a shield that protected her and the imps from hell’s deadly miasma.

“I’m new here so I need slaves and food, I feel generous today so I will let you choose what to be,” Morena growled at them.

Half of them shat themselves at her sight. Dragon’s really ended her as the gods actively work to erase their souls after death unless they went to the draconic twilight.

Morena died after she had turned into a dracolich so she ended up in hell.

All the imps bowed immediately, a dragon was a problem. Who expected such a thing to be dragged to hell? This creature should be able to contend with the upper-rank devils. If they served her well, they might be on their way to living under a future circle lord.

“So you choose service? Then how about you dig or find me a nice cave and provide ample food, otherwise, I will have to start using you as food.” Morena shifted back to her human form and covered her body with acid.

Morena remembered Chad’s face as he finished her, ‘That man was something else. Considering that his son was that mage strength seem to be in their blood. I wonder what would happen if they mated with a dragon?’ Morena had conflicted feelings. On one half she wanted to see the child of a Lisworth and a dragon and on the other hand, she feared the horror that was going to be born.

“This is the start after the end, I might have lost once, but I sure will build a new legacy here. Sister and your idiot friends, make sure to not end up here!” She steeled her resolve, she will tear any of them if they ended up in hell.

…

Back in Morena’s lair, Chad, Zaleria, and Gracie went up toward her hoard to see what she left.

“A sizeable chunk. I’m proud of you sister!” Zaleria smiled as she saw the entire cave filled with gold and gems. Spellbooks, scrolls, and magic items were in no shortage.

“Only this much? I expected more to be honest, like something exotic.” Chad said as he pushed the gold and gems to the side with his foot.

Zaleria glared at him in disappointment, “said the man who doesn’t own a tenth of this amount. You might have a hoard of the size an adult dragon would have, but us ancient had more time and power to collect wealth.” Zaleria growled at him.

Gracie was looking at herself in a golden mirror and trying to make different faces that Cain thought her.

Chad laughed, “By the way, is everything alright? Did Ariel help or was a useless buffoon?”

“Ariel? Do you mean that angel?”

Chad nodded.

Zaleria nodded, “She was of great help. How could a human summon an angel by the way?” An evil smile crossed Zaleria’s face.
