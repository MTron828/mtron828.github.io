“You’re already injured. Don’t think you can beat us!” One of the incubi leaped at Hati swinging his long sword.

Cling! Hati blocked the slash with one of her nine tails. She glared at the incubus and pushed him away immediately.

“They are hard. And did it just extend?” The incubus growled. Besides one tail, all of Hati’s other eight tails are made of magic. She can extend, harden, attack, and block with them. Their element is earth so their attacks are heavy.

Thud! Hati used two of her tails to push herself toward the incubi. “AWOOO!” Howling as she swung her arm at one of them, [Earth Claw] Her hand pierced the incubus’s chest.

“Stop her!” An incubus appeared from behind her and swung a mace at her. She didn’t detect him as he was using both invisibility and soundless.

ROAR! Selena jumped from behind the rubble and bit his skull. His head cracked like an egg in her mouth.

“I thought you’re stronger than this-GAW!” Selena growled at her. She seems to have finished her side of the battle. She came here to help Alice.

“A black Jaguar? From when you can take a beast form? (I never heard of this)” Hati asked with a passive face.

“A spell Cain gave me, it makes fighting easier.” Replied Selena. She like this form as she can go directly for the head. Her jaws were far bigger than her human form. Her claws were larger and sharper. She even had hide and fur, which gave her excellent protection.

“So you need a spell to mimic a fraction of our power, (watch this)!”

Hati’s body twisted and morphed. She took the form of a large silver wolf with nine tails.

“Let’s see who can kill more!” Hati said.

Selena had already started fighting, “Wait for me!” Hati rushed after her.

“This has turned into a mess. I still haven’t found that bi*ch yet.” Said Kayden as he walked on a mountain of corpses.

Crack! Crack!

Kayden quickly turned around and focused on his six eyes. He looked toward the rift. Someone was there.

“Free, free our lord!” The man hugging the rift cried as his body glowed brightly.

Thud! Kayden rushed toward the man to kill him before something could happen. If this all was a distraction for them to break the rift. They are in trouble.

Kayden had trust in his skills but he wasn’t ignorant enough to want a fight with an earth dragon. As Cain had said before, their best bet was to rely on the beast god.

“No, you’re not stopping his!” That red hair and pink eyes cannot be mistaken.

Meliliana Flew in and blocked Kayden’s way. “It’s been a…” Before she could finish speaking. Kayden lashed at her with his full power immediately.

[Hallucinatory Terrain] The area which was a burned-down village suddenly changed into Kayden’s dead forest. His demonic aura engulfed the whole place.

[Eldritch Blade] Kayden created his second blade and jumped into the sky.

[Skill Empowerment] Black veins covered his whole body as his physical capability increased.

[Demon Blade] [Demon Blade] Demonic flames covered both his blades. They emitted a sky blue glow like that of a blue moon.

[Blade flow] [Sextuple Slash] Kayden swung both of his blades down at a tremendous speed.

Meliliana wasn’t that surprised by his temper. The last time he chased her for a whole three days. She could only run as she couldn’t match his strength. But now was a different story.

Meliliana had gotten the care of the earth dragon. Full access to his treasure hoard. The number of potions, buffs, and equipment she had on her. And most importantly the magic she absorbed the being directly.

Thud! She jumped backward and dodged Kayden’s attack. [Necklace of foresight] “You fool, do you really think you can hit me?” She yelled at him with a wide grin.

Thud! Kayden took a heavy breath and swung as hard as he could.

[Demon will Sword] in his next attack, instead of six simultaneous slashes. It was thirty slashes as he chose Meliliana as the target for the spell each time.

“What?” She felt her arms, wings, tail, and legs being torn apart.

‘I felt no resistance, could this be?’ Kayden thought as he held his blade high ready for a second strike.

“Do you really think this is enough to kill me? Come on, exhaust yourself so I can devour you later.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s been a long while!” Gracie jumped inside Kayden’s [Hallucinatory Terrain] with her knife in hand. She stood between them and started slowly walking toward Meliliana.

“Cain’s maid? Get out of here, she is mine!” Kayden growled at her.

Gracie stopped in her place. She remembered Cain’s words. Do what you want. Say what you want. What are the lines he taught her again?

She slowly turned toward Kayden, “I only take orders from Cain and Sofia, and I’m going to do what I want.” Gracie did want to settle things with Meliliana one and for all. Cain said that if that was her will, she could follow it.

“Stay here and I will kill with her,” Kayden growled at her. He couldn’t care about what Cain said or wanted. The only thing he cared about was killing Meliliana.

“Come here, we haven’t played for a long time,” Meliliana called Gracie out.

Gracie slowly turned toward Meliliana and put her hands together. Learning what she was about to do wasn’t easy, it was the most complicated spell Cain had taught anyone.

It was the same spell she used to clear Ourals’ keep in minutes. Cain said that it was the signature spell of the legendary assassin Mauzzkyl Jaezred.

[Maddening Darkness] Gracie’s body melted into shadows as the darkness consumed Kayden’s [Hallucinatory Terrain].

It was complete darkness, seeing was impossible without true sight. Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the darkness. Kayden could swear that he was feeling multiple hands on his body.

The true power of this spell lay in her utility. No one can escape as the darkness will lead them in circles. It was pitch black so Gracie could teleport freely inside. This entire place was a big shadow so she can have access to all of her weapons. Her attacks will never miss since darkness is touching everyone and she could teleport the blade directly to the target skin.

The cost of her spells is significantly decreased. All damage done to her is also reduced if not ignored since she has turned into a shadow. Inside this domain, the only three who could face her outside of Zaleria (She can’t wound her even with a direct hit) Are Cain who can dispel this spell and Alice who is a devil. In addition, the real Mauzzkyl Jaezred who created it.

Kayden tried to swing his sword at the darnkness but he then felt his arms being tied down by a metallic wire. Multiple knifes touched his skin, “You move, you die!” Gracie whispered.

This was the Eight-tier spell that Cain drilled into her. The thing she wanted to be able to take her revenge form Meliliana.

Gracie Grey, was the one who grew the most. That was the reason Cain sent her to Ourals alone. She has talent like what Lisa said.
