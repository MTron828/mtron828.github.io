Inside the bath, Cain was resting in the hot tub when Alice approached him to discuss the matter. He simply looked at her as if he could guess what she was about to say.

“You don’t have to say it, I already guess what it’s from how she was acting and her sudden urge to fight. The answer is no.” Cain refused before she could even start explaining.

“But why?” Alice replied to him, she wasn’t wearing the link ring so he couldn’t have read her thoughts.

“Do you want the long explanation or the short one?” Cain asked as moved a bit to the side leaving a place for Sofia to sit to his right.

“The short one,” Alice said as she sat to the left of Cain.

“First of all, Our wedding is close and it will be weird to add someone just before that. There is no mutual benefit like with Marina. Also, Hati didn’t seem to like the idea.” Cain explained.

“But we agreed after hearing her story, that she is also the daughter of a lord, don’t you like that?” Alice said with a faint smile.

“Are you serious?” Cain gave Alice a sharp look, “I don’t what kind of story Skoll told you but it won’t matter. Even if I were to take her as a wife, she won’t stand in your wedding. You four had to wait over a month, risk your lives and grow stronger. It will be disrespectful to let her stand with you.”

“The more, the better-nya!” Selena said as she rested on Cain’s legs.

“I have to admit that I’m a bit uncomfortable with all of this. But especially now that she has the shard, won’t keeping her close be better?” Sofia said. As Cain expected, it was clear in her eyes that she didn’t like the idea. She was just trying to be considerate toward Cain and allow him a chance to keep the shard. She was golden.

Cain patted Sofia’s head and hugged her with his right arm, where he could find someone like her?

Gracie had already reported what Skoll to the girls to him secretly. That is why he told Mary that she had competition before. It wasn’t like Gracie was snitching, she just didn’t understand the concept of Lying or hiding information from Cain.

“If you’re worried about the shard, that’s already solved.” Cain pointed at Hati who was sitting silently in front of them. “Inside a body, there is only so much space for existence. Hati only has two, one for her soul and one for her sister Skoll. This means that either one of them has to die, or the shard will keep absorbing their strength. That’s the reason she did only have one tail until I relieved her from the shard.” Cain pointed behind Hati. She still had nine tails but one of them seem a bit shorter than the other tails.

“Now that the shard has awakened, and Skoll was freed. You won’t be able to sustain the shared for long. When your tails shrink to nothing, you will wither and die.” Cain stated as he pointed toward Hati. She quickly checked her tail.

“(So you understood that, but even I just knew about that. Our first intent was to get stronger by being with you) ” Skoll replied from inside Hati and confirmed what Cain said. She could feel the shard sucking their life at a rapid pace.

“That you’re intent, not Hati’s. Also, it’s not me that needs you because you have the shard, it’s you who need me to stay alive!” Cain gave them an evil smile.

“Cain, aren’t you going too much?” Alice interrupted him, he smiled and patted her back.

“I won’t be marrying you out of the blue just for that. I have a duty toward my wives, if you truly wanted it, you have to wait until we reach the capital.” Cain stated.

“(But we got the approval of your wives) Sister can you stop?” Skoll said and Hati interrupted her.

“Well, you didn’t get their approval. Not the majority that is.” Cain replied with a smile.

“(I’m pretty sure I did get it)” Skoll argued.

“You got Selena’s approval since she is happy with more in the PRIDE. You got Alice’s approval since she has a good heart and couldn’t leave a person in need, I bet it was something like your parent’s dying wish. (Cain did listen to the conversation she had with her parents, he was looking for some information and he heard them ask Hati and Skoll to stay close to Cain as he is strong).” Cain smiled at Hati’s angry face, that was Skoll’s expression he guessed. Which meant he hit the right spot.

“But that’s where your luck ends, I won’t take Sofia’s approval as legitimate, Gracie did neither agree nor refuse, and you totally forgot Marina. That is a three against two. Add Me and Hati and you into count, it will be five against three.” Cain stated as stared at Hati.

“(So you refuse?)” Skoll said with an angry tone.

“That’s true, you haven’t met the criteria that are necessary to not break the family. You can stay with us until you met them.” Cain replied with a smile.

“(No need for that, we will leave immediately)” Skoll said as she tried to leave.

She stood up, walked toward Cain, and sat by his side. “(Hati what are you doing, we’re leaving!)” Skoll exclaimed at Hati’s strange actions.

“We he agreed with me, I don’t mind staying by his side for longer…Also, it will be bad if we died.” Hati replied.

“(You can’t be serious, you were against it a minute earlier!)” Skoll didn’t seem to enjoy Hati’s changing attitude toward Cain.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Also I’m not leaving before I beat him. Let’s give it a try.” Hati said as she got closer to Cain. Sofia tried to kick her away but she didn’t even budge.

Cain patted Hati on the head, “You heard it Skoll, will you stay?” Cain asked.

“(Fine, But sister stops acting so comfy with him!)” Skoll yelled at Hati who was scrapping her head at Cain’s hand.

“So we need to only prepare for five?” Alice asked.

“Yep, You, Sofia, Selena, and Gracie. In addition, the fifth is Marina. Can you do it?” Cain looked at her.

“Well I can set two weddings, one here in Furberg for us and one in Ourals for Marina. Father said that it will need to be flashy to do the job.” Alice said as she was thinking. Marina’s situation was different than Hati’s. Cain was marrying to get Ourals under his rule and to eliminate any bad blood between Ourals and Furberg that might spark a second war. Her existence will also allow Cain and the girls to travel freely.

Marriage was more than something to link two people or more, it was also a powerful political tool. The girls knew from the moment they realized how strong Cain was that a lot of people will seek to tie themselves to him. Selena was looking forward to seeing the pride grow, Alice was happy as long as Cain was happy, and Sofia didn’t want to be a burden and was trying her best to fit in. Gracie on the other hand only cared about what Cain wanted.

Cain then relaxed in the bath with the girls, he had a lot of work this night and tomorrow. He better relax now that he can.
