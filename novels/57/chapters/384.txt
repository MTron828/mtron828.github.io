Cain then turned toward Zaleria and asked, “Where is the hell gate?” He wanted to check and then inspect Isbert later. He had a feeling that the ice hero absolute Zero has did something.

“That ship over there, the big one.” Zaleria pointed out immediately.

Cain didn’t want to waste any time. There was a lot on his mind right now.

Before going, he turned toward the girls and asked, “Do you have any MP potions on you? I did wake up but I’m still critically low on Mana.”

The first one to react was Farryn, throwing him a large blue bottle. “Elvish blue wine, made from the blue grapes growing under the world tree’s shadow. I heard you have a lot of Mana.”

Cain grabbed the bottle with a smile, this thing regenerated 1500 MP on average, enough to fully recover Farryn but not him. “Do you have a second one? This can barely get me close to half.”

Farryn gave him a doubting look, “You must be joking…” But as soon as she saw him gulp the thing down in one go. She could tell his Mana still haven’t reached its limit.

“I do have a couple more but they are expensive, drink something else.” She glared at him.

Then Chad went and brought a small supply box, it was expected that Cain might need MP potions after waking up so they brought some.

Farryn watched in disbelief as Cain downed a bottle after the other, his MP reserve was big enough that he needed a second bottle of the blue wine.

“This is wasteful, you could have just rested until tomorrow,” Farryn commented with a disappointed face.

“I need the MP now.” Cain said, “I want to absorb the Hell Gate before we get to shore or the nobles will cause problems for the king for letting me have it.”

“Why would you care for such a thing? And what are you going to do with the Hell Gate? It’s better to destroy it.” Farryn was a bit skeptical. For all, she knew no good was going to come out of Hell.

“It’s out of respect to the king, and the gate is going be useful later.” Cain then flew toward the Hell Gate.

‘All the soldiers here in the fleet aren’t going to oppose anything I do, they knew the consequences.’ Cain understood how the soldiers saw him. In their eyes, he was a terrifying monster.

On top of saving their lives, he beat a monster that could have destroyed them all. Cain wasn’t a person they can talk to or against. Right now it wasn’t just rumored, they saw it with their eyes.

At this point, they would rather disobey the king than Cain. Because the latter is more powerful and dangerous.

As Cain landed on the ship, all the soldiers lined up to salute him with the captain at their front. “White Mage, is there anything you need?” The Captain asked with a shaking voice.

“I’m here to secure the Hell Gate before we reach the shore. We don’t want devils spilling there do we?” Cain smiled.

The soldiers’ faces paled, and the image of the armies of hell ripping the capital apart crossed their minds.

“I don’t think the kingdom has what it takes to keep such a thing and I know none of you want to end up fighting devils. Let relive you such a dangerous thing early.” Cain smiled as he approached the gate.

“But won’t the nobles request a report of what happened?” The captain asked and all the soldiers glared at him.

“Listen, all those people here have families they want to live with in peace. Do you really trust nobles to keep such a thing in check or me? We’re going to tell them it was too unstable and we have to destroy it.” Cain wrapped his arm around the captain’s shoulders.

“Yeah that thing was dangerous, we’re glad it crumbled apart.”

“Such a relief, Hell something was it? Glad it sank to the depth of the sea where it can never return.”

The soldiers started pretending the Gate doesn’t exist anymore.

“See? This isn’t an order or duty, this is the collective will of the people. They might be soldiers but they are citizens at the end of the day, with families and children to care for. I bet you’re the same, will you enact an order that would kill your family?”

The captain shook his head, “I know. Do what you want with it, I will report it was too dangerous to bring. But I will inform the king.”

“That won’t be a problem, Baltos is far smarter than the capital’s nobles.” Cain smiled as he stood in front of the Gate.

He needed to re-configure a room in the maze and then teleport the gate there. Making the room is simple but teleporting the Gate through a Gate was the hard part that will consume a lot of his Mana.

“Can you bring me a chair? This will take some time to do.” Cain said getting ready for a few hours of hard work.

…

A few hours prior in the capital, before the Aboleth was defeated.

“Tear him apart!” Cassius said with a passive face and the vultures started ripping the Commander’s flesh away.

“But you! Aren’t you one of the thralls?” the commander growled as he was dying.

Cassius then rushed and cut the ropes tying his mother, “Why did you do that, he was controlled!” She yelled at him.

“No he wasn’t, there are three types of our enemies. The thralls who have a tadpole in their eyes, the complete thralls who have merged with the tadpole, and finally the believers, those who worship the aboleth. The commander was a believer.” Cassius explained.

“How do you know that?” His mother asked as she stood.

“Those little pixies did a really good job, they hunted every thrall and removed their tadpole. But that wasn’t a good enough job as they missed me.” Cassius left eye started moving separately from his right eye.

“Cassius, you aren’t…” His mother gasped covering her mouth.

“This little guy was starving, he missed the chance to get in my eye so he was dying. I didn’t want to let him die so I voluntarily took him in my left eye. After that, as you can see I had him consume half of my brain so he is a part of me now.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Seeing the worried face of his mother Cassius had to smile, “Don’t worry, he isn’t connected to the aboleth now. He became a rogue tadpole after being abandoned to die, thanks to him I can tell the infected on a glance, and even talk with insects which were impossible with my magic.”

After taking a moment to stomach everything, Cassius’s mother walked toward the closet and picked a hidden dagger she was keeping there. Even if the king had guards, he must have weapons stashed in case of an emergency.

“Who are the believers?” She asked.

“Everyone, all the rest have been secure by the pixies. Feel free to attack anyone holding a weapon.” Cassius assured her.

Izabella Dolly Ruris, The injury she suffers from very well hinder her job. It was a head injury that caused her hands to start shaking whenever she tries to hold them still, being unable to run at full speed without falling, and most importantly, she lost hearing in one of her ears which severely limited her tracking and detecting ability. Some even speculate that it affected her vision and that’s why she wears glasses.

Click! Clack! She started jogging through the hallway with Cassius behind her. That was as fast as she could go.

Two men appeared from the corner cladded in full plate armor, “They are believers!” Cassius shouted.

“It’s a maid, let’s kill her!” One of the said while the other started turning around to run away, he recognized her.

A vulture cut the running man’s way while Izabella leaped at the one who wanted to kill her.

She instinctively caught his hand and sliced his armpit where the armor wasn’t protecting. As he was falling, she grabbed his head and stabbed him in the eye gape multiple times until she could see some of his brain seeping out.

“This one…” She turned toward the second person to find him foaming on the ground. A small black spider walked outside from his armor.

“My new little friend, a black demon widow spider.” Cassius lifted the small spider on his finger. The spider lifted her front arm releasing a faint happy screech and Cassius patted her head. With his finger.

“Where did you get that?” his mother asked with a worried face.

“The forest, she was about to get eaten by a poisonous frog and I had the vultures save her,” Cassius replied as he patted the nail-sized spider.

This was the main reason the king restricted Cassius’s freedom, such a small creature can kill a grown man out of nowhere in the forest.

“You will be grounded after this…” Izabella said.
