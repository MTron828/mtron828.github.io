Cain woke up the next day feeling better. Thanks to Alice his neck was healed completely. But there was one thing that didn’t make him happy. His father was waiting outside in the garden for training.

Cain slowly walked out of his room and washed his face. “Master, breakfast is ready in the dining hall.” Gracie walked toward him. “Thank you, is there anything to report?”

Gracie nodded, “The prisoner that we’re been keeping in the basement is asking to be let out. What do you say?”

Cain thought about it for a moment. “Well she can’t run with you around, feel free to let her roam around. Just make sure she knows her place and works hard to support everyone.” Cain walked to the table. Gracie simply bowed down and left.

After finishing his breakfast, Cain hurried outside. His father has already started his regular routine. Swinging his sword around and practiced his moves.

“Aren’t you a bit late?” Chad asked.

“Someone almost broke my neck yesterday, I need some time to heal,” Cain replied yawning.

“I only used the equivalent of 14 strength. We have a big problem if such an attack left in bed for a night.” Pointing his sword toward Cain, “For a starter, come at me with all you got.”

“Can I use melee magic?” Cain asked.

“No, just use your skills. The point of this training is to get you to a point where you can fight without magic.” Chad replied with a serious face.

Cain yawned again, his body was feeling sluggish when he wasn’t actively using magic. You can’t get someone to be excited about doing something they don’t like.

Thud! Chad didn’t wait for Cain and charged directly with the intent to send him back to Alice’s lap.

‘Eilistraee, let’s see just how powerful is your style’ Cain thought with a smile. His body relaxed.

At that moment, Chad felt as if he saw a dark elf woman standing before him. Swoosh! Cain twisted his arm and sent an upward slash at the charging Chad.

Surprisingly, even though the attack was unexpected. Chad found it slow and easy to block with a sideway swing. Clang! As Cain’s blade was deflected, Cain used the momentum to chain a second attack at Chad’s neck.

Cain wasn’t worried about his father being hit. Chad has 28 strengths and Cain’s blade was made of steel. You can never cut someone with dough.

Chad immediately realized what Cain was doing. Even if the first attack was weak and slow, by combining the momentum of each attack after the other. Both the power and speed are going to ramp up quickly.

Each time Cain’s attack was blocked or countered, the speed and strength of his attack increased.

Chad wasn’t going to let that work. “What if I dodged?” Chad started dodging Cain’s attacks instead of taking them. To that, Cain took a step back and lifted his blade, [Blade Dance: Chase of the blue moon veil]

Again, Chad thought he saw a dark elf woman standing before him. It was a strange feeling that for a second, Chad thought that Cain was using illusion magic.

“Who taught you that?” Chad asked. It was weird, what kind of skill Cain was using?

“A friend of mine.” Cain’s gracefully rushed at Chad and swung his blade downward, Chad tried to evade but the swing seemed to follow him.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Each swing was followed by another, a never-ending combo that only seemed to get stronger and stronger. Not only that, Cain’s movements were uneven, they didn’t resemble any standard fighting style.

Each time Chad dodged one of Cain’s attacks he started to notice stuttering in Cain’s movements. ‘His back can’t take the proper shape, his legs aren’t long enough and neither are his arms.’ It was slowly becoming clear how flaws Cain’s style was.

“Aren’t you pushing yourself too much? I can hear your joints screaming.” Chad swung his blade and disarm Cain with a single strong strike. This should end the fight.

Tip! Cain stepped lightly on the ground, swinging his hand at Chad’s arm. Chad got confused at that moment, even steel can’t hope to wound his skin. What can a mere hand strike do?

[Blade Dance: Unarmed blade] As can’t nails grazed Chad’s arms they left a long scratch which shocked Chad. Cain wasn’t using an ordinary skill, even after being disarmed, the combo never stopped.

Swoosh! Cain’s sword who thrown in the air fell back and landed perfectly in Cain’s hand again. ‘Did he use magic? No, he guide me to where the blade was going to fall’

As Cain grabbed his blade again, he turned around and tried to deliver a swift strike at Chad. There was no mistaking it, even if Cain was using a simple steel blade. He could bypass Chad’s resistance and cut him.

Chad quickly understood why. Since Cain’s style was using all the momentum from his attacks, there was no force left to exert pressure on his blade. If there is no counter force at the impact his edge won’t be damaged and it can deliver the increased force of his skill.

“Such a powerful skill, what is it?” Chad laughed as he swung his blade around.

Even if it didn’t seem apparent, Cain was quickly reaching his limit. The skill was putting so much pressure on his body that it was almost grinding his joints. This skill was developed by Eilistraee to be perfect for her own body.

Since the skill was hand-tailored for Eilistraee who was a dark elf woman. The skill started to have requirements other than talents and dedication. The skill needed the body of a dark elf woman to reach its maximum potential. The dark elves who use this skill are called the maidens of the moon.

As expected, Cain was no maiden and no dark elf. His body can’t utilize the skill that well.

THUD! Chad stomped the ground and jumped to the sky, “Let me show you the real sword skills!” Chad got excited seeing that his son wasn’t a completely incompetent swordsman.

Chad fell down with a wide swing, Cain easily dodged it and chained a swing at Chad.

Chad easily punched the blade from Cain’s hand and kicked him in the guts. “You have other things besides your sword, use them if your blade is occupied!”

Cain quickly twisted his body around Chad’s kick and then sliced at him barehanded.

Chad dropped his sword and swung a punch at Cain’s face. Swoosh! Cain quickly switched his attack into a parry, he didn’t have enough speed to land the hit before getting punched.

As Cain got punched in the face his body flew backward. Crack! The moment Cain tried to land on his feet, his ankles snapped.

“Are you alright?” Chad rushed to check on him.

“Yeah, I reached my limit. Alice, can you come quickly?” Cain said and Alice immediately teleported to his side.

“What happened?” She asked with a worried face.

“I over exerted my body. My ankles have cracked, and my knees are at their limit. You can say that almost all of my joins are about to burst.” Cain explained his situation.

“So a full body healing, I understand,” Alice said as she started healing him.

“What was that skill, I have never seen one like that in my life!” Chad asked with an excited face.

“Blade dance, it doesn’t suit me right?” Cain giggled.

“Blade dance? Isn’t the skill that only dark elf could use?” Chad seemed curious.
