In a faraway land, Inside the dragons’ ancient castle.

“Morena has failed her mission to retrieve the purgatory shard. The reason was the interference of her younger sister Zaleria and a white-haired mage.” A dragon growled underneath the dragon king’s throne.

“That little girl, where is she now?” The dragon king asked with a violent growl. His voice alone almost tore the place apart.

“She had disappeared after her defeat, we know nothing of her location.” The dragon replied.

“Then what of her sister? Did she die or get injured?” The dragon king asked.

“No my lord, she had achieved the feat of blocking the ninth-tier spell meteor fall directly and suffered grave injuries. Nevertheless, she recovered quickly after.” The dragon reported.

“As expected of that thing’s child, just like her mother. The scar she left me still ach until this day.” The dragon king touched the massive scar on his neck. “Centuries have passed and I still feel the burn of her flames. Kill Zaleria before she becomes a problem like her mother.” The dragon king growled.

“For that…We did send three wyrms but they ended up getting killed by an unknown great wyrm. From what our devices detected last, that great wyrm helps the purgatory shard we were after.” The dragon spoke with caution. No one knew how the dragon king would react to such news.

“Are kidding me? How did you miss a great wyrm of all being? I believe I told you to send the most capable dragons.” The dragon king was filled with rage as he stood up shaking the whole place.

“Then what about Shan and Alvarir? Did they retrieve the world tree and the Fenrir shard?” The dragon king growled as his magic started going out of control.

“To that…” The dragon hesitated to speak. “The elvish princess Sylph killed Alvarir. Shan was sealed by the white-haired mage and Zaleria as well.” The moment the dragon finished speaking, his body turned to dust as the dragon king burned him to ash.

“You useless fools! I’m here occupied for centuries trying to perfect the mad soul. Can’t you even come with a single success?” The dragon king flapped his wings and rushed outside toward where the dragon’s army was training.

All dragons froze in place the moment they felt his presence. They all looked toward his layer entrance. Black and blue scales, six horns on his head, and four wings on his back. The dragon king glared at them.

“Send someone to free Shan the earth dragon immediately. Kill Zaleria, the daughter of the purgatory dragon. And hunt the white-haired mage.”

“My king, we have sent a great wyrm to Shan’s rescue. Shall we send him reinforcements?” One of the dragons’ generals spoke.

The dragon king killed him immediately, “I don’t need an idiot who asks such a question. Send everyone available.”

“As you order.” Another general replied to him.

“And what about the human capital?” The dragon king asked with his claws out.

“We are going to send everyone, we can’t take anything besides an overwhelming victory.” The dragon general replied.

“Good,” The dragon king seemed to calm a bit.

The dragon king slowly returned to his lair underground. “Even with multiple races, blood, and magic. Not a single soul managed to withstand the madness.” The dragon king looked at his stats on a crystal ball.

“Those shackles bestowed upon us by those arrogant bastards. They called it a blessing while it’s a curse. One day I shall break it apart.” The dragon king roared.

The dragon king sat on his massive bed and started thinking. ‘The white-haired mage, white-haired… where did he come from? I’m sure there wasn’t any useful magic in the human kingdom.’ He cracked his neck.

“Elves, dark elves, vampires, The hell, and now even the human kingdom. How many of them are going to give us trouble?” All of his perfect plans seemed to fail out of nowhere.

The elvish princess suddenly started a rebellion against her father and absorbed the world tree lemon, which was the world tree shard. Where did she hear about the shard? It took him decades and multiple experiments to find a possible way to extract the Lemon’s power but that woman did it suddenly as if she had prior knowledge?

Even after that, she did the forbidden and struck an alliance with the dark elves. They are mortal enemies, right? Who was pulling the strings… The dragon king could not wrap his head around everything.

‘If I heard about another failure, I will go myself and teach them a lesson.’ He stood up and walked toward the experiment hall. He had work to do, he must create the perfect mad soul before that day.

…

The next morning quickly came by, Cain headed with Gracie toward the city outskirts to search for dungeons. Sofia, Alice, and Selena were busy with the wedding preparation.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Should we stop by the guild?” Gracie asked as she saw Cain heading straight toward the city gate.

“No need, I already got the information about the dungeons before from Mary,” Cain replied.

Gracie remembered hearing Zaleria talk about some problems in the guild. It shouldn’t be important if she didn’t tell Cain. “Master, are we going to clear the dungeons?” Gracie asked.

“Yeah, I intended to build a waypoint between Furberg and Ourals for the public. With a single gold coin for cargo carriage and a single silver coin for people. It will be a great passive income and a good way to show goodwill to the people.” Cain said stating his plan.

“How about the wedding?”

“The waypoint will help more people to attend the wedding. So with that, we’re clearing dungeons today to get their cores.”

As they reached the city gate, the guard opened it for him immediately. They all knew Cain, Alice, Sofia, and Selena but none has heard of Gracie. They all stared at her questioning what a maid doing there.

Just outside the gate, a young man approached Cain. “Master do you need a horse, we have horses for rent.”

Cain looked at the young man. “A stable master, how much is one horse for a day?”

“It’s only one silver coin, you won’t find cheaper than us.”

Cain looked at the beautiful mare behind the young man. “We will take this one, please prepare a two-people saddle,” Cain said as he paid the young man.

Today was a bit sunny, good weather to go on a ride. From the information, he got from the guild yesterday. There was a dungeon to the north. One to the east, and two to the west.

Cain wanted to check the one to the north first since it was closer.

“Master, the horse is ready,” Gracie called Cain as she saw the young man approach with the mare.

Cain and Gracie took off toward the dungeon. “Listen, I do want to push you to the limit. Are you okay with that?” Cain asked with a serious look.

“What do you mean by limit?” Gracie asked tilting her head.

“I know what you can do stat-wise, but I want to test your reaction speed and decision-making ability.”

Gracie stared at him. “I don’t mind, what do I need to do?”

“Just fight, you will understand when we reach the dungeon,” Cain said.
