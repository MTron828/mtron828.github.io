Cain then left Sofia to rest a bit and went to Gracie, She seems to have gotten bored from waiting and is rubbing her chest on his back.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The moment he turned toward Gracie, she leaped at him with a kiss. This was the only time she lets her succubus side show up.

He lifted her toward the other side of the bed while the ghost maids carried Sofia toward the sofa and started cleaning her.

As their lips separated, Cain went slowly toward her chest. Gracie gasped quietly as she hugged his head tight. As he took his time with her bosom, his fingers were going as fast as they can inside her.

“Please, inside…” She mumbled.

“Not yet, a bit longer!” Cain replied as he put two fingers in her mouth while putting a finger on both her lower holes.

By the time Cain finished getting her ready, she had already reached her limit twice.

Cain lifted her hips slightly and pushed in, it was tight but he slid right in without any problems. Since this was Gracie, he tried to go all out from the start, full speed and power. He pounded her hard enough to shake the bed yet she kept crying for more as she licked his chest.

After a short while, they both reached their limit and Cain unloaded all he had inside of her.

But, something was off, when Cain looked at Gracie’s face she had a smile. But deep behind it, he could feel that she was unsatisfied.

“You want more?” Cain asked.

“I’m already full but…I do still feel a weird tingling inside me.” Gracie replied.

Cain understood what it was, she was carving for more due to her succubus nature, and this was her just wanting to do it.

Cain kissed her and said, “Let’s try something different, are you up for it?”

“Do whatever you want.” She replied.

Cain quickly pulled and went into her back end, he felt a bit more resistance but it slid in perfectly. The luxury of succubus blood, an unmatched adaptation in those matters.

After his match with Gracie ended, Cain went back to Sofia who had just stood to drink a cup of water. “Can you take more?”

“Buff? I can, look can we do a lot in a row?” Sofia asked, seemingly she hadn’t learned her lesson from having two at the same time earlier.

“At this rate, I might resort to spanking as that seems easier,” Cain replied jokingly, he didn’t expect her draconic nature to be showing like this. One of the main reasons that dragons were strong is their relentlessness.

“I just want to get it done with, we already finished a quarter,” Sofia replied.

As she wanted, Cain then pushed the remaining fifteen buffs into her, one by one, each time giving her a short moment to rest.

Cain considered her use of Cold magic and her potential affinity for acid due to her having black dragon traits as well so he gave her buffs according to that.

One thing was clear, Cain was about to start teaching her how to fully use witchcraft, now that he has his hand on Kraken’s ink, it was time to start the real witch training.

Sofia was half awake lying on the bed. She took all the buff without giving up and drinking Gracie’s aphrodisiac. That was an impressive feat that even he didn’t expect.

…

About a day away from the capital, an old woman was sitting alone on a stone in the wilderness watching the capital in the distance.

Swoosh! A spear came flying and pierced her back. Still sitting, she coughed blood and turned around slowly.

“We caught her, is she the one who has been murdering all the troops we sent.” Three men flew down, it was clear at a glance, that they were all dragons from the scales on their faces.

“Did no one teach you how to respect the elderly?” The bath old lady said calmly.

“Elderly? Said the woman who has been crushing all of our plans. Why do you keep protecting them, who are you, and what are you after.” One of the dragons growled.

“The same mistake should never happen again, those are his words. But I failed that and lost everything, now with the last flare of my regret and sorrow, I shall seek redemption.” She stood pulling the spear from her chest as if it was nothing.

“Impossible! That weapon was infused with the power word death!” One of the dragons gasped, no mortal should have survived his stab.

As the bath old lady’s body started to morph into her draconic form, she growled, “I the perga…No, I abandoned that name when I lost everything.”

Upon seeing her draconic form, the dragons instantly tried to run. They knew they lost the moment they saw her, no wonder the spear didn’t work.

“Run! We made a mistake!” The bath old lady tore the dragon apart before he could run.

“Call the king…” He was burned.

“Tiamat is still alive!” The last one screamed as she took a bite from his neck.

“Sadly I’m not alive…I already died.” Tiamat said with a sad voice, slowly curling into a ball and licking the wound on her chest to heal it. Even after all those years, she could still feel no heartbeat in her chest.

“If he has been a bit harsher on me, I might have not ended in this hell. Isn’t that right, AO?” She fell to sleep thinking about one of her regrets.
