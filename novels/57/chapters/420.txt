Cain relaxed back in the hot water, Marina to his right and Mary to his left. Facing him were Klara and the twin maids.

“Can one of you fill me in about what happened in the past week?” Cain asked. He wanted to know the exact details since he expected to see his wives at least waiting for him.

After giving him a brief summary, contrary to what he wanted. Mary started telling him the important problem they are facing, the nobles in the capital have done something unexpected.

“Don’t tell me they started a revolution of some kind?” Cain sighed he expected something like that since the past month was a bit calm.

“How did you know?” Marina gasped but Mary smiled as if she was proud.

“I mean, those dragons have been silent for a while. Nothing is below them so I bet they are behind this revolution.” Cain’s face looked exhausted, those dragons are a real pain.

“That isn’t a reason to think dragons are involved, they can’t be in everything.” Said Marina leaning on her back.

“No, they can, besides being extremely powerful, hard to kill. They have another quite contradictory quality. They are prideful, prideful with what they can achieve that is. A dragon would wage his tail like an obedient dog for a hundred years to get what he wants, and then kill you. Because there is nothing they hate more than the shame of not taking every possible method to get their desired result.” Cain explained.

“Wouldn’t that mean that Zaleria could betray us after getting the tattoos?” Mary asked with a smile.

“That’s possible, but I have other reasons to trust her,” Cain said with a smile, Zaleria’s goal was unachievable.

“You know what is best, I’m not one to speculate about such things.” Mary waved her hands and rested her head on Cain’s shoulder.

“Is the situation in the capital urgent? Or could it wait?” Cain asked, he was hoping it won’t interfere with the tournament. He promised to get Kayden there after all.

“I don’t think it’s urgent, they seem hesitant to attack the capital since a certain princess seems to be growing stronger rapidly,” Marina said with a smile.

“Isbert? Is she getting better at controlling her ice magic?” Cain asked, he knew that they opened the Hell Gate long enough so she can get her full control. But the know-how was something she had to get herself.

“She started going out alone to hunt monsters, rapidly killing them and raising in levels,” Marina told Cain what she heard from the messengers.

“Rumours say that she can keep fighting for the entire day, she never gets tired.” Mary smiled.

“Well if the hero silver is the one giving her power, she is bound to be strong. I mean he is the hero holding back hell alone since the ancient ages.”

“You have a point. What do we do now?” Mary asked.

Cain looked at the ceiling, “I’m itching for a fight but…” He paused for a minute, “I doubt anyone in this continent could qualify to fight me.”

“Qualify? What did you become?” Mary said jokingly, she knew Cain was trying to become stronger with the operation. But what could make him so stronger that everyone needs to qualify to face him?

“It is complicated…” Cain said pausing for a moment. Marina and the maids held their breaths while Mary smiled.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I can’t even go all out close to a city since I will end up harming everyone there. I doubt even father and Zaleria combined could stop me at full power.” Cain said in an ominous voice, he had become a monster that shouldn’t exist. An unfair force that didn’t even belong to nature, an outsider existence that is a horror to just look at.

“How bad could it be…” Mary smiled looking at his eyes, it was then she felt it. A sharp surge of pain crossed her bones just so she realize it was but fear, her instincts screamed begging her to run away, the thing standing beside her didn’t deserve the humanoid shape.

She looked at him with sweat dripping from her back, “I seem to have stayed in hot water longer than I should, can we get out?” Mary gasped.

“That won’t be a problem, let’s get out.” Cain stood up and they followed him.

“If I remember correctly it’s Marina’s day right?” Cain asked to make sure, his abdomen mind told him that he lost some loads while sleeping but couldn’t identify who. Only Alice should have been able to get in and he couldn’t imagine her out of all people using his body while he was asleep.

“Can you do us both?” Surprisingly Marina was the one to ask. Cain gave her a surprised look as she was the last one he thought was into that.

Marina’s face quickly turned red realizing what she said, “I meant separately but on the same night. Alice told me that I do lack the stamina to satisfy you and…” She went silent as her head overheated.

“Did Alice say that? I need to have a serious talk with her then, but in fact, I can keep up.” Cain scratched his head, Alice going around saying things she shouldn’t only giving him a headache this time.

‘It’s probably so I can get them quicker, with the number increasing they have to wait longer for their turns so it’s probably the reason. I will later suggest two on the same night but they can be separate. Sofia and Selena, Alice and Gracie, Mary and Marina, this would be a three days rotation.’ Cain thought.

Cain looked at them, “Fine, today will be your turn.” Cain looked at Mary and Marina. “Separate, of course, I wouldn’t force you together.” Cain smiled.

“Yes,” Marina said with a smile.

“O-of course.” Mary had to agree, she didn’t want him sensing her discomfort about his nature, and she wished to have never looked into his eyes to discern what he became. But then suddenly she felt at ease, having such a monster by her side was reassuring in its own way.

“You also join us, the more the better.” Cain looked at the twin maids and Klara.

The twin maids nodded in sync, “With pleasure.”

“You want me as well? Are you sure?” Klara gasped.

“Why not, you don’t want to? But seeing you standing naked in front of me is saying otherwise,” Cain asked with a puzzled face.

Klara looked down, they still didn’t exit the bath. “I guess so, it’s my pleasure.” She smiled, he wasn’t angry at her as she expected him to be.

“Should we do it now?” Cain asked grabbing Mary and Marina’s peaches.

“Not now!” They both rejected him, they much preferred a more suitable situation.

Cain sighed, “Fine, tonight after dinner.”

“What would you do for now?” Mary asked.

“I would make a quick trip to Selena’s village, you said Sofia, Selena and Gracie were there. Farryn as well but I’m not that excited to see her.” Cain stretched his arms.

“You don’t have much time,” Marina said, thinking about the distance and the other matters like what he intended to do.

“I will just pay them a visit, I bet they will be surprised.” Cain smiled.
