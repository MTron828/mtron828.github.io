‘Wait who?’ looked toward the ball of flames rising to the sky in confusion, there was a single individual who can try something stupid.

“What are you doing!” Cain screamed at the top of his lungs, should he fly and pull her back? No, there was no guarantee he would have enough magic to do that.

That ball of flames rapidly expanded and then bloomed into a gargantuan dragon that soared toward the meteor.

“Grandma!” Sofia screamed as loud as she could, she couldn’t understand what Zaleria was going to do.

thump thump, lub dub…DOM DAM! DOM DAM! Down in the city, they could hear Zaleria’s heartbeat quickly rise until it resembled the rumbling of a large drum. VROOOOM! As her scales turned bright red from the heat accumulating inside her, her wings flapped faster than the eye can see, sending a shock wave enough to shake the city and shatter all of its windows.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

[Seal of the Shielder], [Seal of the Titan] Cain could feel the two seals inside Zaleria activate, her intention became clear to him, she intended to take the Meteor fall head-on.

~Don’t be stupid, even a dragon-like you won’t survive that~ Cain screamed in her mind with [Message]

~My granddaughter in down there, this I won’t let this stone touch a hair from her!~ Zaleria screamed back at him as she closed the call, he wasn’t able to reach her with a Message after that.

Sofia flew toward Cain, “Can’t you stop her?” She cried Cain’s face looked sore, “I have no way to stop a determined dragon, with her skill in magic she could even resist forced teleportation.”

They had no other choice but to watch.

“That arrogance will be your downfall, you dragons never learn your place.” The lich who was standing beside Morena said watching Zaleria break the sound barrier as she flew toward the meteor.

“Don’t lump all dragons in the same pot, She was especially hard-minded.” Morena replied to him, “Well, at least now father won’t have to worry about her anymore…” She smiled.

“It’s all of you, you dragons managed to kill your god…I would say you all just as crazy as her.” The lich scorned the sight of a dragon. Morena ignored his words and looked at the sky to watch her sister’s last moments.

‘…That’s a big rock, it looks hard.’ Zaleria thought as she got closer to the meteor, her blood raging with magic. Should I try deflecting it to the side? No, I won’t have the strength, it will just push me to the side and keep falling.

‘Taking it head-on is the only way!’ [Seal of charge-less spell] [Hell Storm] Zaleria activated her ninth-tier spell Black flames start forming around her body, [Seal of the assisted control] Those flames slowly condensed on her forehead.

In the blink of an eye, Zaleria dove into the meteor head first. Their collision caused a massive shock wave and shined brighter than the eclipsed sun in the sky.

… Zaleria’s HP started to drop quickly as she felt her body shatter under the impact, this was as stupid to do as a human who tried to stop a running rhino with a headbutt.

“ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!” Even though the collision was loud enough, Cain managed to hear Zaleria’s roar from the city, his hair stood as he recognized it as the dragon’s dying cry. It was the last roar they made as they expanded all of their power in a suicidal charge.

Takeshi and the dragon’s fang have heard this cry before when they killed the young green dragon in the past, but this roar was different when it was coming from an ancient dragon. More than a pitiful death cry it sounded more like the dragon was insulting the whole world. Something boiled inside them even though they knew Zaleria’s intent, ‘How could a mere living creature challenge nature’s raw power like this?’

Everyone in the city was forced to close their eyes as the light was blinding. Morena created a filter with her acid to look at the meteor through it without being blinded. It was only for a brief moment but Zaleria seemed to be pushing against the meteor with her head before everything exploded in a giant ball of fire, dust, and derbies.

[Prismatic dome] Cain created a multicolored crystal dome around the whole city to protect it from the explosion, It would be unacceptable if the city got destroyed after such a sacrifice.

“It’s over, she should be dead, and the meteor should now fall on the city. That brat’s defense would protect him from that.” Morena looked toward the city in scorn, she still couldn’t believe that a brat like Cain was able to use ninth-tier magic prismatic dome and protect the city from Zaleria’s failed attempt.

She waited for a second, and then another second…The meteor was nowhere to be seen…

The dust could be slowly dissipating and the meteor was still nowhere to be seen.

Morena’s face turned pale, her face twisted in anger realizing that her sister’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain “Don’t tell me she actually did it?” She screamed.

“That way everyone hates fighting you, to believe one of your kin has now stopped a meteor with their life…Utterly comprehensiveness!” The lich said in a calm voice.

“That fool is dead now, I don’t want to hear about her ever again! Now get what remained of the troops out!” Morena ordered the lich boss to summon his minions from the dungeon. Now that Zaleria is dead and Cain had expanded all of his magic, killing them and looking for the anomaly shouldn’t be hard. She thought as she transformed back into her draconic form.

Sensing something, Morena looked up to the sky and snorted. “One is enough, why did you have to waste your MP?” She said to the lich.

He looked up, a second meteor was falling…”I don’t have enough magic…rather, that one isn’t heading toward the city…” The lich said, slowly panicking inside. His heart which has stayed silent for untold ages has started beating again rapidly.

His whole troops were there…He even called the minions of his two brothers as well…Since this dungeon boss was a triplet of a wraith (Control the ghosts), a death knight (Control the marching undead), and the lich (Control the undead mages)

“Run into the dungeon, the troops are doomed!” The lich screamed as he flew inside the dungeon gate to hide. Morena immediately morphed back into a human and flew behind him.

On top of the city gate, Cain was lifting one hand to the sky, it was both swollen and dripping with blood as he did his best to delay his [Meteor fall] As when he was in the middle of casting it, Sofia screamed that she saw something falling from the sky and flew to fetch it, he needed her to get back into the prismatic dome before he could slam the whole weight of his rage on the basters before him.

He knew what she flew to fetch. Since he had felt that thing activate as the meteor exploded.

“Do it Cain-nya!” Selena screamed behind him as Sofia returned with a burned body in her hands. The corpse-looking thing in her hand looked as black as charcoal, missing all of its limbs and having multiple cracks across it.

Cain immediately apprised the thing.

[Alice, keep her alive no matter what!]

Cain then looked toward the S-rank dungeon, her eyes flushed with blood. With raging scream, he put even more magic into increasing the meteor speed and weight “DIE, [ENCHANTING]!!”

With his scream, the meteor accelerated quickly and slammed directly into the S-rank dungeon gate.

A single moment of silence ensued before everything turned into hellish chaos and was engulfed in the unimaginable explosion.
