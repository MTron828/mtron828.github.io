Cain opened the door to the witch’s room, he was surprised to find it tidier than he expected. Multiple history books were laid on the desk and the bed.

“Ancient history, the great war, chronicles of the old world, Letters of remembrance: collected. Those are all rare history books. Father, can you find anything besides them?” Cain looked at Chad who was going through the books.

“The ones I can read are all history books, look at this.” Chad handed Cain a weird book.

“This is written in the Orcish tongue, it will be strange if you can read it. But it’s a history book, Tales of the ancient tribes.” Cain gave the book a quick glance.

“Then it’s weirder that you can read it.” Chad started to get suspicious of Cain.

“I’m a mage, learning a lot of languages is expected.”

“I don’t think that a mage should know Orcish language, it’s the furthest from magic as far as I know.” Chad stared at Cain with a suspicious glare.

“I just learned it to encode my spells for protection…” Cain looked away.

“I have never seen you use a spellbook, I know that it’s hard to remember spells for mages when the spells are complicated. However, that didn’t seem to be a problem that you are having.” Chad was quickly pushing Cain to a corner, all that he said was true.

“The same to you, I have never seen you carry a catalyst, are you a sorcerer or something?” Cain pointed at Chad’s empty hands.

Chad quickly pulled a broken necklace from his pocket. The necklace looked old and rusted and it had the symbol of a crown stabbed by a shield. The symbol of humanity.

“This kingdom’s flag?” Cain stared at the necklace.

“The ancient symbol of humanity, it carries the meaning of change as it symbolizes a rebellion. I like to understand it as that humanity will one day reach the top of the world and rule the world.” Chad explained.

“Are saying that this kingdom’s flag is also copying this ancient symbol?” Cain asked with a confused face. He never delved that deep into human history besides looking for great events such as the ancient devil war and the like. He always thought that symbol was just a badly designed flag.

“Yes, this necklace is my catalyst. You could say I’m closer to clerics and paladins who use a holy symbol. Now, why do you know Orcish language?”

“To make it easier for you to understand, one of my friends fought against them. I had to learn the language to help interrogate and plan for the fight.” Cain said. A sad expression crossed his face. “We won the war, but she lost her life in the battle.”

“Hold up, I never heard about an orc war happening?” Chad became confused.

Cain knew that lying was not an option. His father could pull [Zone of truth] at any moment.

“You never heard of it, yet. I hope you will never hear of it. It will all burn to nothing. Let’s go, I want to get back home as soon as possible.” Cain tried to change the subject, as he will start talking about things that are yet to happen.

Chad sensed that Cain was determined on something. He will never allow anything to stop him. “Yeah let’s get back.” Chad decided it was best to leave Cain to do his things.

After having a last glance around, Cain pulled all the books into the maze and created a small permanent portal in the room. He had farmed enough dungeons to be able to do it.

Walking outside Cain made sure it was safe to leave the hut unattended and then sealed the place shut with [Earth wall]

“Now let’s head back, I still have to deal with the wedding preparation and the like. How are you feeling after taking your revenge?” Cain stared at Chad, it was clear from the start that he wanted to avenge Cain’s dead foster parents.

“No much different, your potential death gave me enough anxiety to stay on edge all the time,” Chad replied with an exhausted face.

Cain patted him on the back, “Are you worried about me father? That flatters me a lot.” Cain smiled, “But let me tell you one thing. If I was to really die, you won’t have enough time to morn me before hell fells on earth.” Cain referred to how Sylph will appear enraged. Sylph would most likely kill everyone in the vicinity. Her philosophy is that you either were trying to kill Cain or were present and didn’t help him. Either case deserves death in her book.

“What do you mean by that?” Chad asked.

“Let’s hope you never know. That’s a situation we wish will never come.” Cain smiled. “Come on, we never got a chance to spend time like family. Care to help me prepare for the wedding?” Cain pulled Chad into the portal and teleported back to Furberg.

“Yeah, Let’s go.” Chad decided to not ask for further details, Cain was clearly avoiding any crucial information.

“Master, have you returned?” Sebas rushed toward Cain the moment he saw him.

“Is there any problem?” Cain replied with a worried face.

“No, not at all. On the contrary, it’s going smoothly. Even the church has suggested to held a secret marriage ritual for you. Apparently, they couldn’t refuse the request coming from the best healer in the city and lady Alice who can use holy healing.” Sebas explained.

“Best healer in the city?” Cain looked confused.

“That’s Miko. Hinata Miko, the healer from the dragon fang. She apparently told them that you are a blessed person who taught her healing magic and acted as a catalyst to help Alice receive the holy healing.” Sebas explained further. Cain thought about it for a second.

“So they are seeing him as a prophet in disguise? How convenient.” Chad stared at Cain as if assessing him.

“That’s right, it also helped that he predicted the Great catastrophe and the war with Ourals. Even Lord William has vouched for that.” Sebas smiled, this has lessened a lot of his work.

“Well, as long as it works,” Cain said and then looked at the window “We still have time before the day ends, Should I go and hunt some meat for the wedding?” Cain said.

“But we will have problems preserving it,” Sebas replied. He knew very well that Cain would bring more meat than they can dry.

“We can always freeze it, we have cold magic after all.” Cain has the maze, enough dungeon core, and an ice witch. He could very well build them a frozen room to preserve meat.

“If you can do it then it’s fine. But don’t bring a lot since it will be exhausting to butcher.” Sebas smiled and left them.

Cain looked at his father. “Can we go on a little hunting trip? I heard some parents here like to take their children with them to fish.”

“Fishing? You intend to hunt for meat.” Chad smiled.

“Did I hear you say hunting-nya?” Selena rushed from the window. “It’s been a while Selena, would you like to accompany us?” Cain asked her.

“Of course-nya!” She replied energetically as her tail waved around.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels
