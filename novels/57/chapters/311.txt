After making sure that they got everything necessary. Chad, Zaleria, and Mei headed toward the fallen Alseria country. Their aim is an abandoned house in its ruined capital.

As they walked just outside the city wall, Zaleria immediately shifted into her draconic form and roared. Her roar alerted the whole city. Surprisingly, people here in Furberg have already used to her presence so the children started jumping in excitement.

Zaleria shocks her body to stretch her limbs like a cat. It didn’t help that she was taller than the city walls and her scales were ember hot.

“Now that I looked closer, you’re bigger than an adult red,” Chad said as he finally realized that, the last time he saw her was in their fight against the earth dragon. He just didn’t pay her that much attention at the time.

“How rude! I’m an ancient dragon, not a mere adult!” Zaleria growled, the flames on her back slighting erupting.

“So you’re an old lady? You’re a hag after all.” Chad giggled and Zaleria clawed him to the forest edge.

“What have you done?” Mei cried as the whole guards watching froze in horror. Zaleria has just taken that man off the population count.

“This isn’t enough to scratch this idiot, look he is fine!” Zaleria pointed far away into the forest edge.

Chad slowly rose up scratching his head, ‘that was painful, was she trying to kill me?’

“Witches are called hags in some places, and I believe an old lady sounds better than an ancient lady!” Chad growled at her as he flew toward her with [Fly]

“He is fine?” One of the guards gasped. “Isn’t that the white mage’s father?” Another guard whispered.

“No wonder he could withstand that…” They started gossiping. The world quickly spread of Cain’s father being an equivalent monster to his son.

“You should have just stayed silent! Next time I’m going to bite your head off!” Zaleria growled at Chad who landed in front of her.

Chad cracked his neck and smiled, “Ok then, ancient lady…” Zaleria smacked him again but this time her claw stopped. Chad blocked her strike with his forearm.

The walls shook at the impact and the guards fell on their rear ends. Such was the power released by the gigantic dragon in front of them.

“Damn this is heavy!” Chad growled. Zaleria had 30 strengths compared to his 28 which left him at a disadvantage in a strength competition.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Humph!” Zaleria snorted at him and pulled her claw away. She felt like hitting a half-inserted nail with all her might. This wasn’t the feeling she is used to when hitting humans.

Chad looked at his forearm and then at Zaleria, “That was really heavy, haven’t you been eating a bit too…” Before he could finish Zaleria opened her jaw and started charging a full-power breath.

“STOP!” Mei flew in and splashed water in Zaleria’s mouth. “You will blow the whole city, STOP!”

As Zaleria remembered the city behind her she gulped her breath down. “Close your ears!” She yelled, and everyone in the whole city unconsciously did her bidding. Her words were infused with her charisma.

KABOOOM! A loud explosion was heard from inside her. She literally swallowed her breath and it exploded in her stomach. The sound alone was enough to make some people throw up, their eardrums scream in pain, and rattle their bones.

“Oh god! That was…” Before Chad could speak, Mei wrapped him with veins.

“You’re doing that on purpose? Stop agitating her, she almost erased the whole place.” Agitating a red dragon was a whole another level of playing with fire.

“Let’s go, if I was to kill you we better be away from civilization,” Zaleria said as she grabbed Chad with her claws. Mei sighed and sat on Zaleria’s nose. “Hot! Hot! My arse is burning!” She cried immediately.

Zaleria panicked as she saw a red flame consuming Mei’s lower half. “Wait I will blow it up!”

“Stop! You will burn me alive!” Mei cried as she saw Zaleria’s jaw get close to her. But to her surprise, the flame immediately faded and she felt cold instead.

“It’s impressive how you can see her!” Chad said with an impressed face. Mei was no taller than one foot while Zaleria was taller than the city walls. It was like a human looking upon a bed flea.

“Don’t underestimate dragon’s eyesight, I can spot ants from cloud high!” Zaleria boasted about her incredible sight.

“You eagle-eyed monsters, how are people supposed to run from you then?” Chad asked on behalf of all humanity.

“They aren’t supposed to escape. Out of all beings that are considered living. We are the best of the best.” Zaleria said proudly.

“You must be joking, there is no way dragons are the best in everything.” Chad cut her off, what she said was clearly wrong.

“You might be right so let me rephrase it. We’re the best in everything that matters. You won’t find a dragon that can farm, but every dragon can enslave thousands of farmers to work for him. We might not be able to work in most jobs, but we have the strength needed to size wealth. We might lack a god now, but we sure can thrive without him.”

Power, arrogance, and raw infiltrated might. Those were the dragons. Zaleria took pride in her race as all dragons did, embracing their high existence as forces of nature.

“You’ve been talking a lot, let’s hurry!” Mei yelled at them. They were talking a lot and she wanted to return to her grove.

ROAR! Zaleria roared as she run toward the forest. With a single powerful jump, her gigantic body flew to the sky opening her wings.

The kids standing on the walls cheered as the mighty dragon took to the sky.

Right after flying, Zaleria changed her scales color to match the sky. It will be problematic if some cities saw a dragon flying over them.

It only took her a day to traverse the whole distance, she was flying quite fast. “Is that it? It’s quite a bit ruined.”

Chad took a look, “What is that? The things moving down there.” He was seeing a few dark spots like ants going about.

“They are bandits it seems. They are chasing some people but that isn’t our problem.” Zaleria said as she kept looking around for the house Chad described. A big mansion with two massive oak trees and a star-shaped garden, a brown roof, and three chimneys.

“We need to stop them, we can’t let them terrorize what’s left of this place,” Chad said as she struggled to escape Zaleria’s grasp.

“You idiot…” Zaleria sight as she clenched her fist tighter, “I will take care of them so stay still. That will be faster.” Zaleria silently swooped down while staying camouflaged.

THUD! As the bandits were chasing the people, an immense creature fell on them. Half of them got stomped to death immediately and those who survived the initial blow saw a gigantic red dragon above them before being burned to ash with its mere presence.

Zaleria stomped them like a kid jumping on ants, she didn’t even bother looking at them. Her only concern was to get this whole thing done with.

The people who got saved only stared in awe as the incarnation of wrath descended from the heavens to smite the bandits.

Between the people, a single man smiled menacingly.
