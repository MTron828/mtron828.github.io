“This isn’t the end.” Cain looked deeper into the cave.

“Forgot about that. Are you alright?” Sofia asked, hurrying to check on Cain.

“She is right. They almost got you there!” Alice was surprised that Cain got pushed back with just numbers. He should have been able to take them all with a big spell. She didn’t think about if the cave collapsed!

“Yeah.” Cain painfully laughed at himself, thinking about how he could have fought better.

He could have used [Earth wall] to bottleneck the goblins, slay them one by one.

“It doesn’t matter-nya, we didn’t help enough-nya!” Selena spoke, clearing Cain’s mind.

“You’re right, I should have relied on you more. Let’s change our fighting strategy.” Cain suggested a change in the plan. Selena was stronger and more capable than him in CQC (Close Quarter Combat), she would be better at the front.

“Selena, let’s switch. You take the front while I will be your support!” Cain didn’t want to put any one of them in danger, yet having Selena fight was the safest bet for them all.

“How about traps?” Sofia asked, “Outside combat, I will take the lead to find and disable them all.” She quickly got her answer.

The fight wasn’t over yet, goblins are smart. There should be still a bunch of them hiding inside, waiting to ambush them.

“Alice, don’t use your aura! If the kids are still alive you might end up hurting them.” Alice could control her aura based on what she sees and know, she could exclude Cain and the others from her aura. That didn’t include the kidnapped children as she can’t see them.

“You and Sofia stay in the middle, I will take the lead disabling traps and Selena will protect the back. If we got attacked, Selena will take the lead!” Cain briefly explained how they will proceed.

They started to push ahead, there weren’t that many traps in the lower rooms. Without meeting any more goblins, they reached the deepest room.

At the corner, the two sisters were holding their beat-up brother. Sitting side by side with the brother being in the middle. Their stat was bad, the girls were filled with wounds and scratches as if someone dragged them in the gravel. The brother’s condition was worst, on top of the large wounds, his legs were twisted backward.

It was pitch black so the sibling couldn’t see what was around them.

The goblins have climbed the walls and hid behind the rocks, waiting to ambush Cain and his friend when they get close to the siblings.

A weird goblin was hiding behind

[Message]

~Selena, when I make a move, protect Sofia and Alice.~

~Sofia, At my signal, scream as loud as you can. Something along the lines of ‘Die’ will do~

~Alice, activate your aura at the max output when Sofia screams.~

After considering what he was going to do, Cain gave the signal to Sofia.

~Now!~

“DIE!” Sofia suddenly screamed at the top of her lungs, surprising all the goblins as well as the siblings.

The two sisters screamed, holding their brother ever so tightly.

Taking this chance, [Earth wall] [Earth wall][Earth wall] Cain covered the sibling to protect them.

Returning to their senses, the goblins dropped one by one, attacking all at once.

Seeing Cain make his move, Selena took her stance, waiting for the goblins to get close. She didn’t want to move too far from Alice and Sofia.

Alice quickly activated her curse, she has already seen the siblings and could exclude them.

[Firebolt] Sofia took one of the goblins down, [Firebolt] she has already started digging into her necklace reserve.

[Mist step] Cain teleported directly into the weird goblin face. He was a goblin shaman, the one leading this nest. Unlike the others, he wasn’t a fighter but more of a commander.

[Lightning Grasp] Cain fried him on the spot, sending the other goblins into confusion. Without their leader, they have lost all of their coordination ability.

Killing the remaining goblins didn’t take long after that, Selena was almost enough on her own.

[Enchanting: Light] Cain quickly made his gauntlet glow, disabling his [Earth wall] to set the siblings free.

The two siblings were shaking in her, hardly able to open their eyes as they were left in the dark for so long. They were badly injured but it didn’t seem life-threatening. What concerned Cain more was the brother.

As he approached to check, the two sisters hugged their brother tightly, they still haven’t recognized that Cain is here to help, or they were just too scared.

“We’re here to help!” Cain pushed the two of them away from the brother as he spoke, “Alice come here help me!” He checked the kid’s condition.

He was barely breathing, and his heartbeats were weak and unstable.

[Lesser Healing] [Holy Healing] With the combined effort of Cain and Alice, they managed to get him into a stable condition.

The other thing Cain worried about was poison, with how much they are wounded, it was sure they are poisoned as well.

They then healed the sisters so they can walk, he then gave them a bottle of the antidote.

The antidote tasted horrible, enough to make the stomach hurt. “Either you drink it willingly or I will force it down your throats!” Cain threatened them, he was lucky to find the brother still alive and them still untouched. He wasn’t going to have them die later.

One of the sisters managed to drink the antidote, and Cain had Selena force the other to swallow it.

Cain poured some of the antidotes on the brothers’ wounds in the hope it might take effect from there. He intended to make him drink a bottle the moment he woke up.

After Making sure all the goblins were dead and exiting the cave, Cain set it on fire and closed the entrance. A measure so the place won’t be used again as a nest.

Cain Carried the brother on his back while the two sisters walked with the girls.

…

Last night, as the goblins approached the sisters, their brother started a fight with them.

He wasn’t strong enough to win, but the goblins found beating him to be amusing as he kept standing back up each time he is knocked down. With that, the brother manages to hold for the whole night.

In the morning the goblins went outside to eat from the cattle, leaving them the way they were.

After eating, the goblins returned for the sisters, they struggled against them and before anything could happen, they heard a loud bang sound. That was Sofia’s firebolt.

They quickly escorted the children to their house. Their mother fainted the moment she saw her children beat up like that.

Their father was crying, His children survived, and that was what mattered to him most.

“Please wait, sir!” The father came rushing as he saw Cain and the girls about to leave immediately.

“Please wait, I can’t just let you leave like that. Is there anything I can do for you!” He was crying, unable to find his words.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Cain hated to deal with those kinds of situations, “Don’t pull my clothes! The quest reward is enough.”

The girls have backed up, leaving Cain to deal with him alone.

“NO, no, there must be something I can repay you with!”

Cain thought about a way to deal with the situation.

“Then, if we ever needed a place to stay, can we come to you?”

The father happily agreed, his doors were open to Cain and the girls at any time.

After finishing everything and telling the family where they can get the antidote, They returned to the guild to get their rewards for the two quests.

Between the basilisk and the goblins, It was a solid 8 gold coins. It was a bit low as Cain wanted to keep the basilisk eyes to himself.

The day was finally over, they returned home a bit before dusk. At the door, they were greeted by Sebas who was inspecting the repairs at the entrance.

As they entered, they were met by a maid that has long brown hair and black eyes. Her name was Diana Booth. Cain quickly noticed her oversized chest and wide hips. It was as if her uniform button could break at any moment!

“Ah, Master welcome home.” She said with a gentle smile.

Cain paused for a second inspecting her body before speaking, “Can you prepare the bath for us?”

“Of course!” She turned around, and as she was about to go.

FLAP! She fell flat on her chest. her panties exposed to the open air.

‘How did this happen?’ Cain questioned himself. Nonetheless, he stared at her pink, flower-decorated back end cover.

Sofia walked at her slowly, covering her up. Selena helped her stand and Alice healed her bleeding nose.

“Thank you…” Diana closed her mouth as she could feel Selena’s claws poking her side.

“Hurry and get the bath ready!” Sofia threatened her with a small flame in her hand, she made sure Cain didn’t spot the fire.

“Your full name was Diana Booth, right? I will keep that in mind!” Alice gave Diana a slight pat on the head.

Even though the girls tried to hide it, Cain noticed all that they did and he made a painful laugh.

‘It’s going to be a harsh night!’
