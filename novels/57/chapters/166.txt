As Cain’s story came to an end Zaleria stood out to get out. Something didn’t make sense to her, one year wasn’t enough for Cain to get such power and meet the elf she had seen. ‘He is hiding something, and it’s going to be big.’ She though.

“We should get out as well, we’ve been here long enough,” Alice said as the heat started to get to her head. Her body flushed red from staying in the water for too long.

As they were in the changing room, Sofia whispered to Cain. “Cain, can we talk for a bit?” Cain turned around, she was still in her underwear. All the girls were there so what she was going to say wasn’t something she wanted to keep a secret.

“What is it?” He smiled expecting her to ask something about today’s training or the like, maybe she was lacking something he didn’t know off.

“I want to raise my Charisma, I don’t want to wait longer.” She said standing still while her eyes quivered.

“Your natural charisma is 16, with that it will be 18, add your jewelry and it will reach 19. With such stats, I won’t allow you to get outside your room without covering your whole body.” Cain told her while patting her head.

“He is right, walking with such high charisma and not being able to control it is a death wish. In the best scenario, most men will pounce on you.” Zaleria stepped in, “I can control it but it took me decades of practice, you don’t even seem to have the natural talent to control it.”

After looking into her eyes, Cain sighed. “Fine, but on multiple conditions.” Cain said and Zaleria gasped at him, “What do you mean?”

“Charisma is a witch’s spellcasting ability, her magic will grow stronger once she levels it up. I have a way to keep her under control for some time.”

Zaleria curled her eyebrows and her lips twisted, she never heard of a way to contain charisma besides being born with a talent to control it like people who were born with high charisma do. Or train to control it, and that took even Zaleria multiple decades. “Does it have with how I don’t seem to affect you with my charisma?” She had tried to use her 23 charisma to seduce or scare him but he seemed unfazed.

Cain smiled, “Sadly not, putting in the simplest term, I’m used to you. For her, I will make an anti-charm potion and soak her clothe in it to give her a debuff.” Cain wanted to make Sofia’s Robe have a debuff that reduces her seduction ability. (That was a lie, he was Zaleria’s slave for a long time and he just got used to seeing her naked or being hit with her charm. For sleeping with her, it was safer to say she was the one using him every now and there to quell her needs)

“Wait, used to her?” Sofia gasped grabbing Cain by the ear, “What do you mean b that?” She was clearly upset at the thought that Cain might have laid his hand on her grandmother.

“Let me rephrase, I’m used to dragons’ charm. It was a necessity to avoid their frightful presence.” The most common dragons use their charisma to scare prey and those who are fighting, getting over it was necessary to fight them.

“When will that potion be ready?” Alice was the one to ask, she wasn’t fazed by the weird topic. “We can get it ready by tomorrow night,” Cain replied as he patted Sofia on the head.

“Tonight is your turn, right? I will let you raise your charisma on the condition to have both Alice and Selena join, Gracie as well since I might need her.” Cain said grabbing her shoulders, “And don’t blame for what might happen, under the effect of 18 charisma I would be like a drunk man.”

“He is right, I doubt he will remember anything after the first glance at you,” Zaleria said walking closer to them. “You’ve been growing stronger, I will join just in case we needed to restrain you!” She said. If the girls can endure him for the night he will be alright. If they can’t then he needs something else to vent that frustration onto, Zaleria thought she was the safest option to go with.

“Don’t underestimate me-nya,” Selena cried, “I will keep him in check-nya!” She declared, Cain looked at her and nodded. It was true that Selena had better physical abilities than him and she might be able to go for longer than him.

Zaleria sighed, “Fine I let it to you, But if by any chance I heard you struggle I will jump in immediately. I don’t want Sofia to get scarred.” Zaleria then scratched her chin, “Tell you what, Sofia go in with 19 and try to make him obey your orders!”

It was possible for those who got high charisma to make people do their bidding, it was hard to achieve but ultimately easier than just quelling the charisma.

Mary who was listening to them had her face on fire, “What-What are you talking about?” She cried, is Cain really taking four girls to his bedroom? Zaleria is also wanting to join them? What is this talk about Sofia having 18 charisma?

“Sorry but you can’t join, it’s too dangerous for you,” Cain replied immediately, Alice was a devil with 20 wisdom so she was both immune to Sofia’s charisma and could bear the heavy workload. Cain also couldn’t worry about Selena, he was sure she could be the one giving trouble instead because of how energetic she is. Sofia was still a bit better than Mary and that was the reason the other two are coming. Gracie was a special case as will be there just in case Cain got exhausted or something bad happened.

“I didn’t say I want to join!” She cried covering her face. That didn’t really matter as she was still half-naked from under her neck. Just that fact alone means she might not mind joining them as well.

Cain gave her a suspicious look, up to now Gracie was the only one acting normal and wanting to not get naked around him.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He looked around at them, Alice, Sofia, and Selena were all okay. They wouldn’t mind him making moves on them, Gracie wouldn’t resist but he know that deep down she doesn’t want to.

Zaleria was still uncertain, how would she react now that he is with her granddaughter might be different than his past life.

For Mary, he was sure she would mind vocally but not resist it.

For now, he has to be content with the three of them, It was going to be a hard night for him and he wouldn’t want more people in there.

After finishing their chat, and changing, the night quickly passed by and Cain found himself standing by his room door with Gracie to his side. “Are you getting in as well?” Cain expected her to want to stay outside and only enter when needed. “Yes.”

“Have you made any progress with your spell?” Cain asked.

“I still haven’t mastered it so I have to dance naked for you!” She stated the punishment he said in the garden.

“That was a joke, you don’t have to do that,” Cain replied, “If you get in I can’t guarantee I won’t lay a hand on you.” He warned her.

“Don’t worry about me, let’s get in.” She pushed him from the back and opened the door. Inside the room, Sofia was covering her body with a blanket while both Alice and Selena sat at her sides.

‘I don’t think I will survive this!’ He thought as sweat dripped from his forehead.
