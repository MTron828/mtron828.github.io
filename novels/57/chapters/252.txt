~Zaleria, Kayden, Selena, Rieth, and Hati are going to take the front. Guildmaster Alen and I will support you. Sofia never engages in close combat, as you cannot survive a single hit. Alice will heal the beast god while Gracie will keep an eye on her. Remember that our enemy is a level 40 dragon, a single wrong move can mean instant death~ This was the sum of Cain’s plan, just them buying time until the beast god can recover. They could also go for the kill if the earth dragon was badly injured.

The Rift cracked and emitted bright light.

“He’s coming, get ready!” Cain screamed as he got his spells ready.

Hati’s eyes opened wide when she saw a brown-skinned, topless man walk out.

The man was tall standing at almost 7 feet. His arms are covered in brown scales. Two dark brown, thick horns peeked from his head. Crocodile-like spins ran through his back and down to the tip of his thick and scaly tail.

Looking at his right hand, he was carrying the beast god’s head. The earth dragon has already won.

‘I should apprise…’ Before Cain’s thoughts could finish. Something exploded right in front of him. The shock was strong enough to send Cain flying.

“What happened?” Cain yelled. Now that he looked a second time. Zaleria was standing right where he was with her right fist bleeding. The earth dragon was standing a few meters away from her scratching his nose.

The moment the earth dragon exited the rift wondering why the shard was not with the beast god. He felt it inside Cain and attacked him immediately. Zaleria was the only one who managed to react and she punched the charging earth dragon in the face. However, he is an earth dragon. His face was hard enough that she injured her fist.

‘Shit, I need to apprise…’ The earth dragon suddenly opened his mouth and blasted Cain with a full power stone breath. His breath was like a thousand cannon shooting large boulders at the same time.

“Stop!” Zaleria screamed as she punched his lower jaw to close his mouth.

The earth dragon clocked her fist with his palm and increased the strength of his breath.

Thud! Kayden appeared behind the earth dragon and swung his two blades at the neck. CLANG! He didn’t even leave a scratch, this thing was hard.

Cain managed to dodge the breath by instantly teleporting to his maze.

“Such a monster, he didn’t even give me time to apprise him,” Cain screamed inside of the maze. “The moment I get out I need to hit him the best single-target ninth-tier spells I can use.”

Cain lifted his palm up. The odds of him winning against such a being at his level were abysmal. Nevertheless, with his knowledge and some luck, it might be possible.

[Lisworth’s Enchantable Sword] A silver glowing sword appeared in Cain’s hand. It was a blade made of pure condensed magic. It is counted as an eight-tier spell because of how much magic is condensed inside.

Cain quickly put some of the ninth-tier spells that he knew in his mind. All of them could be useful in this situation.

A mix of his Lisworth’s Enchantable sword, blade of disaster, Ravenous void, and foresight will make it easier to land a hit and wound the earth dragon.

“No, it’s stupid for me to be the one to do it. I will give the enchanted sword to Zaleria who has more physical strength than me.” Cain decided that he was still too physically weak to face an opponent such as the earth dragon.

If Cain used time slowly, he might be able to land the hit. However, in that fraction of a moment when the earth dragon is dying, he will kill Cain.

When Cain teleported outside. The first thing he saw was Kayden has a severed body. It was only a few seconds but The earth dragon has already cut Kayden across his waist.

‘Where is Zaleria…’ When he looked, he saw her rolling away with blood gushing from her face.

Just like the first time. In less than the blink of an eye after Cain appeared, the earth dragon rushed at him. Cain didn’t even have time to react.

The earth dragon’s speed and strength were simply outclassing them.

Stab! The earth dragon stabbed Cain’s chest with his bare hand and destroyed his heart. “Give me the shard!” The earth dragon growled.

Blood gushed from Cain’s mouth. He was only alive since he had two hearts. He will soon die from blood loss.

The impact from the hit and the fact that his spine shattered caused Cain to let go of the enchanted sword. The sword flew away with the shockwave and the earth dragon stared at it.

The earth dragon was most likely above level 40 since he killed the beast god. A difference of more than 19 levels wasn’t something that can be surpassed with skills or knowledge.

Dragons weren’t stupid. If someone failed. They won’t just send weak minions but they will send the best of the best.

They heard of Morena’s failure in Furberg and sent three wyrms there. Probably also heard of those three dying so they send this earth dragon here to at least win once.

Cain could feel it. If they won here, the dragon king will come himself to deal with them. This is how dragons act, always use more power than you need, just in case.

The dragons did send Morena who was an ancient dragon to deal with a mostly human city. That was overkill in and of itself. Now, there are going to just get more aggressive.

“That thing looks dangerous, I was right to go for the kill immediately even though your Mana was abnormally high.” The earth dragon said with a passive face.

The earth dragon sensed Cain’s Mana with the shard, determined that he was the most dangerous one, and went for the kill immediately. He knew better than to chat and give him time to power up or cast spells.

The rest of the girls were either blasted away from the shockwaves generated by Zaleria and the earth dragon. Or knew they will only get in Zaleria’s way so they stayed still. Kayden who was the only one crazy enough to interfere had ended up sliced in half.

Grab! The earth dragon heard someone catch the blade that flew away. Almost in the next instant, he could hear the creature’s heartbeats.

When the earth dragon looked in that way to see who it was. He was expecting another stupid man like Kayden.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

What he saw was different. A topless man, standing at six feet tall. A short and thick black beard and hair. Coal-black eyes and slightly tanned skin. The man’s body was ripped to the utmost limit.

“Ulf, I see you died protecting what you love!” The man said with a said Voice as he before the Fenrir god’s head.

When Cain stared at the man, he can never mistake him. It has been years since he last saw him even counting his past life. He didn’t know whether to hate or not as the relationship between them was complicated.

Chad has entered the fight.
