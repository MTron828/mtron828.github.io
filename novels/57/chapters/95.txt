Inside Cain’s room, things were getting hectic.

“How long has he been like this?” One of the maids asked with a worried face, her eyes flinching left and right as she inspected Cain from head to toe. His whole body was burning hot. The maid’s name was Ellie Brown, she had long flowing orange hair tied in a ponytail and a long slender build.

“The mage said he wasn’t really hot and that it was his Mana doing this,” Sofia replied in a shaking voice, as she gently touched Cain’s forehead. “He is a bit hot!” She said.

“My lady, are your hand burned? He is hotter than a cauldron!” The maid almost screamed at her, gently and respectfully pulling Sofia back.

“Let us help you.” Two other maids approached and one of them spoke, “We need to cool him down quickly, this is way beyond fever!” The other one added as she dragged a bow of cold water.

The maid quickly started taking Cain’s clothes off and cooling him with wet towels, Sofia who was there quickly started helping as well.

“Gracie, follow me to my room!” Alice said as she dragged her out.

Alice quickly moved to her room and closed the door, she quickly changed to a one-piece robe and sat on the bed. She then turned into her devil form so she could concentrate better.

“Gracie sit in front of me!” Gracie obeyed without asking any questions, her expressionless face never changed as she calmly got onto the bed.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

[Holy Healing] Alice started using healing magic on Gracie without stopping.

“My lady, this is?” Gracie finally spoke in her monotone voice.

“I’m consuming Cain’s MP so he might feel better,” Alice replied without any further explanation, Gracie just nodded and kept silent after that.

Selena who wasn’t that proficient in caring for a sick person or in magic found her way of helping, carrying any heavy load the maids needed to carry. Things like large bots of water, firewood, and anything of the like.

After about an hour of rushing and chaos, Cain’s temperature started to drop as Alice consumed more of his MP. “His face is finally clearing a bit.” A maid sighed in relief as she wiped the sweat from his neck.

Sofia who was wiping his chest smiled as she saw the maid relieved expression, “Cain are you awake?” She asked while poking his abdomen.

“At least let me pretend to be asleep.” Cain sighed as he slowly opened his eyes. “Being naked in the middle of half of our maids isn’t a feeling I wanted to experience!” He rolled his head to the side.

Sofia giggled, “I’m pretty sure that every single maid did see you naked, including the five un-assigned girls.” She pinched his cheek to turn his face back up.

“Master, It’s a part of our job so please don’t mind us. But if you felt uncomfortable then feel free to get any one of us to s-strip just like we did to you.” The maid replied with a blush, just the thought made her voice shake a bit.

“No, thank you, that would be bad for my health. Can you at least cover me with something?” Cain said as he looked down at his exposed body, the maid also followed his gaze and nodded.

“I will cover you right up.” She quickly opened the wardrobe and brought a big white thin blanket and covered him with it. “My lady, excuse my rudeness but I shall keep contact with him to make sure doesn’t start to heat up.” The maid slid her hand under the blanket and placed it on Cain’s chest.

The door suddenly opened and Alice rushed in followed by Gracie. Upon further inspection, they seemed off. Alice’s skin was pinkish-red and she seemed out of breath, sweat dripping from her forehead as her underwears were a bit visible from under the one-piece robe she was wearing.

Do Gracie’s hair and nail seem to have grown a bit? Sofia could swear that her hair wasn’t that long.

“H-how is he?” Alice asked as she took quick steps toward the bed.

“I’m alive and kicking, a bit ashamed after getting exposed to the whole cast of maids if I may complain, and other than that I’m great.” Cain was the one to reply in a joking voice, upon hearing him Alice sighed in relief, taking a quick look at the maid beside him.

“So can we start with you…”Before Alice could finish her line Cain interrupted her, “Please no, I already have enough on my mind!” Cain rejected what she going to ask the maid to do before she could even speak.

“What are you doing anyway?” Alice asked as she shifted her attention to the maid’s hand, seeing it going under the blanket was suspicious, to say the least.

“Keeping a hand on his temperature, he seems to have cooled down for now but we can never be sure.” The maid explained herself as smiled back at Alice.

“How about Sofia?” Alice asked, looking back at her who was sitting next to Cain.

“I can’t seem to feel his temperature, to me he seemed normal the whole time!” Sofia said dropping her head in shame, it was a basic thing that she failed at.

Hearing her words, Cain’s eyes flinched as he thought about what might be the cause. She doesn’t seem to have fire resistance in her stats, so she couldn’t be resistant…Or could she?

His enchanted system right now can only display stats and magical effects, there was a whole two fields of effects that he can’t see. Physical abilities, like what Takeshi used in his fight against jack or something [Heat Resistance], it’s different than the magical [Fire Resistance]. Mental abilities like him using 20 intelligence to predict and dodge attacks, which should be included as a mental skill. Or something like Gracie or Dolrig’s mental trauma that doesn’t seem to appear on the appraisal.

“Would you mind leaving us alone?” Cain asked of the maid, she frowned back at him, “Who would keep a check on your temperature then?” She asked.

“Both Gracie and Alice are capable of that. Before I forget, call Selena and the Dragon’s fang here on your way out!” Hearing Cain’s words, the maid bowed with a sad and stiff look on her face.

“As you wish Master.” She replied as she stood and left the room. Gracie quickly took her place and slid her hand under the blanket to Cain’s chest.

Now that there were alone, Cain turned toward Sofia, “Don’t be said, It’s either you have [Heat Resistance] or a great affinity with Mana to the point it can’t damage you in its raw form!” Cain looked her right in the eyes as he held her hand tightly.

“You heard him, don’t look down like that. If he ever got like that again we will need you to carry him.” Alice approached the bed and sat beside Cain.

Before long, the door opened and the maid entered and bowed slightly, I brought them. Without waiting for her to finish speaking, Selena rushed in and jumped on Cain’s bed.

Even though she landed on his legs, Cain simply patted her head and let her do her thing. Selena and without saying much rolled on his legs and started purring, Cain found that to be calming.

After getting an agreement from Alice, The maid let the dragon’s fang members in before leaving herself.

“So what’s the plan? That was a lot of maids though.” Daraku was the one to speak first as he took a seat in the room’s corner.

“Were dividing into two, Miko will stay here with me alongside Sofia, Alice, and Gracie. The three of you and Selena will go out to collect some important items for the spell.” Cain then gave them a list of a bunch of herbs and monster parts that the spell will need.

After finishing the decision they all left leaving Miko in the room with them, staring nervously at Cain.

“Let’s start right up, now turned your back to me and face the wall. Sit on the ground using your feet as a seat and close your eyes.” Miko did what Cain told her, her concentration was out of this world as sweat started forming on her forehead.

“Now just repeat after me, each time imagine a dirty thing getting cleansed. It is similar to how you learned other spells.” Cain then started chanting and Miko repeated after him, slowly memorizing the spell chant.

This was going to take a long time so he just relaxed feeling empty as Selena had left earlier with the dragon’s fang and left him without purring.

Sofia quickly left to bring him something to eat, she was sure she saw the maid brew him some herbs earlier. “I will be back, Gracie obey all of his commands without questions!” Sofia ordered Gracie before hurrying out.
