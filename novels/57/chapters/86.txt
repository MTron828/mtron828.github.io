The girls rushed at top speed, with anger and worry, each of them had her dream of tearing that succubus apart.

“Selena, slow down a bit, we can’t keep up with you!” Alice cried, she was barely able to run due to her low stamina.

“Push ahead-gaw, that thing is now abusing our Cain-gaw!” Selena could barely hide her fangs, she was drooling at the wait for the succubus’s blood.

“She is right, We need to fight together, slow down a bit!” Sofia was of Alice’s mind, Selena was just rushing ahead alone.

“I understand-gaw!” Being called by the both of them she slowed down, “If something happened to him because we were late, I will make sure to break your bones-gaw!” She wasn’t joking, they could feel the intent in her voice. The two girls quickly understood that she wasn’t like Cain, they should expect a real beating if they caused him harm.

“The succubus specializes in seduction and charm, their most powerful weapon is their 20 Charisma!” Spindle explained with uneven breaths. “Master lost consciousness, so he just had a way to avoid being charmed! Our goal is to wake him up.” Spindle explained his plane.

“Is 20 charisma that dangerous? Were girls so we should be okay, right?” Sofia asked, remembering how Cain acted with her 17 charisma, she doubted he could have resisted a 20.

“You’re half right, 20 isn’t guaranteed success against a woman. But it could still take effect!” They weren’t safe, This was even without counting the succubus’s strength.

She has managed to subdue Cain, she must be extremely powerful. “Make sure to never stare at her for too long, if any of you started to feel weird then bit your lips as hard as you can, the pain will help you stay in control!” Spindle warned them again, giving them advice on how to resist the charm.

In Selena’s mind, the Succubus wasn’t even counted as a living being, it was just a piece of meat waiting to be eaten. Her innate instinct kicked in, It didn’t matter how the thing looked, it was on her dinner’s list.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Alice was hardly able to contain her rage thinking about what might be happening to Cain, the image of him being used kept flashing in her head. Cursed magic started swelling inside her, violently burning in anticipation.

Sofia on the other hand was worried, she remembered how much pleasure she felt from having Alice lick her back end. The satisfaction of having her toes licked by Gracie. She got a feeling that she might fall for the succubus’s charm.

Sofia debated if she should speak, what those three will think of her if she said that? Will they think she was weird, the words stuck in her throat for a moment.

“I know you might find it disturbing, but I have something to say.” Sofia managed to force the words out of her throat.

The two girls looked at her, awaiting something serious.

I-I might… fall for the succubus’s charm!” Sofia admitted, her face spoke volumes about how much shame she was feeling, at that moment she wanted to kill herself.

“That’s all?” Alice understood what Sofia meant, ” Gotta admit it’s gross for me!” Hearing her sharp words, Sofia dropped her head in shame.

“Cain seemed to enjoy you watching you before-nya!” Selena was talking about when Cain asked Alice to lick Sofia from behind, she was half awake and knew everything. “If he wanted it then it’s okay-nya!” Selena gave an unexpected reply.

“Heh?” Sofia looked at her in surprise.

“It’s true that I almost vomited at that time.” Alice started, “But I will do it every day if it meant saving Cain and making him happy!” Alice stated her mind. “Even without Cain being involved, and since we’re all his. Even if it was just to satisfy you I will do it!” Alice admitted that she is determined to stand by Sofia’s side no matter what.

“You heard her-nya, you will be alright-nya!” Selena reassured her.

…

Cain woke up, his high intelligence kept him from opening his eyes. He could feel her sucking on him down there. Something long and thin was running amok in his back end, it was probably her tail.

His hands and legs were free, thankfully she didn’t tie him down. Cain did his best to keep pretending to be asleep, ‘Ah…Ahaaa!’ He emptied a load in her mouth, he could feel every drop being sucked away with some of his MP. 445/720 She only stopped moving when she was drinking, she quickly started again without even taking it from her mouth.

Cain thought of a way to get out of this situation before she kill him, beating her in a fight was impossible without looking at her. [Sylph’s tiny hut] could protect him from her charm but it didn’t move with him, the spell also took a long time to cast.

“Can you listen to me for a moment?” Pretending to be asleep wasn’t going to fix this situation. He has to bet on tricking her.

Not being surprised he was awake, She just mumbled without even taking his thing from her mouth. “Hmmm. umm!” ~What do you want? If you did anything suspicious I will bite it off~

Cain cringed at her words, but he at least confirmed his doubts. [Message] is a spell that wasn’t on her list, her stats were camouflaged.

“I want to pee, can you let me for a moment?” Cain asked, any excuse to make her let him go for even a moment.

~It’s fine, do it in my mouth, I missed the taste.~ It was confirmed, she was a freak. Cain sadly didn’t have any choice since he had already spoken, it will be suspicious if he didn’t do it.

“Would you let me go already?” Cain asked again as he thought of an excuse.

“Would look at me? I will let you rest if you fell to my charm!” She said, gently stroking his chest.

Cain focused as hard as he could, slowly moving the magic inside his body so she won’t notice. “AW!” She could feel her biting him slightly.

~Your MP dropped, Don’t even try!~ she could know he was using magic when his MP drops.

Cain had a solution in mind, It was unhealthy but better than this thing sucking down on him. Forcibly absorbing MP from the air to fuel his Magic might hurt his natural MP regeneration but was a risk worth taking.

Cain imagined what might have happened if he brought the girls if this thing has turned into an incubus. One of the girls might be laying like he is now! He tried his best to keep his rage in check.

[Sylph’s tiny hut] Cain managed to cast the spell inside his head avoiding the succubus’s notice.

“I’ll be honest with you, I want some real action. Can we do that at least?” Cain slowly opened his eyes to look at her.

Her blood-red hair dropped on her pale white shoulders, the two pink glowing eyes sparkling like gems in her splendid face. Cain felt an even deeper desire for her but it wasn’t unbearable.

~You don’t have to worry, As long as you’re obedient. I won’t kill you.~ She declared. ~Just give me another load…~ She started going at his meat even faster, slurping even louder. Her tail that was inside Cain pushed deeper, tingling him even more. Her hands that were resting on his thigh moved, one to his jewels and one to her soft parts.

Cain could feel himself reaching the edge, his hands unintentionally pulled her hair, and pushed harder into her throat.

“Ahhh!” He released all he had deeper into her, keeping his meat inside her for over half a minute.

“Pwahh! That was fantastic.” Despite her letting go of his meat, Cain still refrained from attacking. As he was emptying himself in her mouth, Her fingernails dug into his torso, each nail has got in by almost a centimeter.

“Can we keep going?” Cain asked, he kept looking for that opening to attack.
