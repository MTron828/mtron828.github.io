Cain went to take a short nap after having lunch. He chose a close couch to lay on. His plan was to just close his eyes for a short while and then head out.

As Gracie kept gently patting his head and combing his hair, Cain slowly went to sleep. That only lasted for a short while when Selena and Hati returned with a rather unique catch.

“Cain-nya, we caught something big-nya!” The half-burned Selena rushed inside scaring all the maids. The moment Cain opened his eyes and saw her he called Alice while using [Lesser Healing]

“What happened?” Cain asked with a worried face.

“It was a young dragon, that girl mauled it to death,” Hati said as he pushed the door wide open. The dragon’s corpse was lying in the garden with people staring from the street.

Cain grabbed Selena by the head and started squeezing her skull. “Didn’t I tell you to be careful and never fight dragons alone?” This time Cain was really angry. Dragons are dangerous and that wasn’t a joke.

“B-but we hunted it-nya, it’s delicious as well-nya!” Selena twisted her body trying to escape his grasp. Hati noticed that Selena wasn’t even using a shred of her strength attempting to run. She shouldn’t even feel Cain’s grasp on her head.

“Fine…What has been done is already done. There is nothing we can do beside…WARN YOU AGAIN!” Cain grabbed her head with both his hands, “You almost got fried alive!” his face was bright red, “Next time I’m going to forbid you from entering the bedroom for a week!”

After making sure Selena will never attempt such a thing again, Cain stood up and walked to see what she caught.

A healthy male young red dragon. Cause of death: Mauled by a wild beast. And all of his internal organs were in perfect shape. All in all, this was an amazing catch.

What angered Cain is that Selena had the link ring and she forget to use it to call him. That was bad on her part.

“This thing is still amazing, it would a waste to just leave it.” Cain checked the corpse.

“Wouldn’t Zaleria be a bit offended?” Gracie said slowly and sent chills in Selena and Hati.

“You don’t have to worry about that, Reds actively merk each other eggs,” Cain said as he opened an arcane gate.

“That’s right, you don’t have to worry about me. I already killed more of us than you can imagine.” Zaleria walked from the next room. The smell of her kind must have woken her up.

“What are you going to do with it?” Zaleria knew that Cain wasn’t just going to sell or use it for alchemy.

Cain stared at the corpse for a second and then smiled. It should be possible if both Zaleria and that Ice witch worked together. Alice could also help.

“Let’s get into the maze, I will tell you there,” Cain said as he sucked the dragon’s corpse into the maze.

“Selena you can rest, for now, this was a great hunt and I will reward you for it later but…You’re not getting any more praise for risking your life. I don’t care what you bring, your life and well-being are more important.” Cain said as he entered the maze with Zaleria.

Selena looked both happy and sad, she could understand why he was angry.

…

Inside the maze, Cain created three chairs. One for him, one for Zaleria, and the last one for the ice witch that was now a lich.

“I was thinking of implanting the dragon’s heart and Draconis fundamentum into my body.” Cain declared suddenly.

“I know you’re smart but that is stupid, a human’s body can’t handle the pressure of dragon organs,” Zaleria said as if she tried it before.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“That lady was able to handle it, was she one of your experiments?” The ice witch said.

“No, she is a natural born. But Bela, this will definitely work.” Cain replied.

Bela was perplexed that Cain called her name for the first time. She really expected him to use her as a footrest after all that happened.

“Grudges only prevent progression, I might hold them against you but that doesn’t mean I won’t acknowledge your skills. It will far more beneficial for me to work you to the bones than just let you live for free in humiliation.” Cain seemed to have heard her thoughts, unlike all of the other undead he created, she was receiving special treatment by being under strict surveillance.

“I understand…Thank you.” Bela bowed down deeply.

“Back to our topic, what did you mean by what you said earlier?” Zaleria cut them off.

“I did evolve into an abomination, I can withstand more than just a dragon heart. Let me explain.” Cain started explaining what he was planning.

“I do have two hearts, I would like to exchange one of them for the dragon heart. I also want the Draconis fundamentum to be stitched beside the heart.”

“That would be hard to achieve without you dying,” Bela said as she tough about all the problems that could arise.

“She is right. I can do the heart but the Draconis fundamentum is a problem, should we just stitch it?” Zaleria Stared at Cain’s chest.

“Not quite right. You need to stitch it to the big artery leading to the heart on the first end and the lungs on its rear two ends. Don’t forget to warp it in flesh or fat to protect it as well.” Said Cain.

“You make it sound easy, but you will die before we could do it. Either from bleeding out or pain.” Bela said with a worried face. If Cain died she will turn into dust.

“I’m more worried about the [Astral Projection]

igniting inside you,” Zaleria added up.

Cain smiled, he had solutions to fix all of their problems. If only those things existed in his past life at the time the dragons did some flesh experiments on him.

“I will be using [Astral Projection] to separate my soul from my body for the operation, that way I won’t feel pain and I will be able to communicate with you. For the bleeding, Alice’s holy magic will be sufficient. For the Draconis ignition, I will be using draconic magic from Sofia to keep it in check.” Cain explained calmly.

“Alice might be able to endure as she is a devil, but I suspect that Sofia will faint the moment she enters the operating room.” Zaleria protested.

“I won’t be bringing any of them, I will just suck their magic remotely and use it on my own. I’m not going to put them through this hell.” Cain smiled.

“And what about us?” Zaleria giggled, “Are fine with putting us through that hell?”

“Both of you are witches who did things like this before, I will be damned if you two can’t handle it.” Cain stared at them.

“I don’t mind, it’s my duty to follow all of your orders blindly,” Bela said with a straight face.

“Fine, I will cut you open like a fish. I did find my hut so we can use my tools. You just need to decide on the time.” Zaleria smiled bitterly.

“With such an operation, you might not wake up for a month,” Bela said with a worried face. Cain’s wives might skin her alive (Undead) if that was the case.

“Don’t worry about that part, with my body and [Astral projection] I will wake up in two to three days when my body gets used to the new organs.” Cain declared.

“Now that all and done, I wanted to ask. Why all of this?” Zaleria asked with a serious face. She wanted to know why he will need a dragon heart and Draconis fundamentum.

“A lot of things, but no particular reason. The dragon’s powerful heart will help empower my feeble body a bit. The Draconis fundamentum will give me access to draconic magic without the need of sucking it for Sofia. I could also expect some special evolution paths when I eventually reach level 40. And generally, more strength is always better.” Cain tried to explain his weird logic.

“That’s ridiculous, only we Reds think like that,” Zaleria growled.

“Ah! My lord!” Bela gasped suddenly.

“What…?” Cain stared at her with a strange look.

“Even with such powers, you still strife for more… will you mind allowing me a taste of that?” Bela bowed in front of him. Cain felt creeped out by her sudden change. But as soon as he read her thought, it seemed clearer to him.

This woman, only married her husband since he was a flesh experiment researcher. She hoped he will experiment on her body and make her stronger. But sadly his skills were lackluster at best.

Now that she was faced with Cain who had more skills and ambitions, she was getting the tingly feeling in her head.

Cain sighed, “Fine, but for the time being. Try and make my operation successful.”

“As you wish my lord!” Bela hammered her head on the ground.
