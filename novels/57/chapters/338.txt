When Cain and the girls walked out of the mansion they were surprised, the whole garden was filled with people cheering. Some they never recognized and some looked similar to the maids.

Cain could even hear a couple of bards playing their drums and flutes at the back. But even with that ruckus, the carriage was what caught his eyes the most.

Cain never knew they could so big and long, red didn’t seem like a suitable color for a wedding but it matched the carriage weirdly. And even though it was cold, the carriage seemed hot. It even came with a pair of wings to allow it to fly.

“Grandma, what are you doing?” Sofia stared at Zaleria.

Zaleria was standing in front of the gate in her draconic form, a crown of flowers and leaves tied to her horns with multi-colored strips running down her back.

“Wouldn’t it be better if I carried you? Not many people get a dragon to carry them, let alone be a wedding mount.” Zaleria slowly looked at them.

The people standing closer to her legs seemed nervous but still cheered.

“I knew people use horses or unicorns but never dragons, simply because you’re too big to walk in a city,” Cain replied with an exhausted face. What if she mistakenly stomped someone?

“I asked them and they said they are fine, isn’t that right?” Zaleria glared at the people of the city looking at her. They all nodded with scared faces..

“No one is going to say no to a city-sized dragon that could blow everything on a whim. But it doesn’t matter, I will deal with protecting them so just walk carefully.” Cain said as his eyes rumbled, every mage in the city could feel it, that man was no less than the dragon he was going to ride.

“Let’s go-nya!” Selena liked the feeling of wind blowing her hair so she instantly leaped over the gigantic dragon leaving a crack in the ground beneath her feet.

The people watching had their jaws drop, Zaleria was taller than the city walls yet Selena jumped to her head easily, could it be that it wasn’t just Cain and Zaleria?

Alice poked Cain, “You take Marina and fly there, we will flow you.” Alice poked Cain.

The people of the city respected them as the wives of the white mage, not for their individual strength. She thought it was beneficial to make a little show so people know they aren’t weak.

Cain nodded and cast [Fly] on him and Marina, masterfully controlling it so it seems like she was flying on her own. After they landed on Zaleria’s head with Selena, he looked down to see how they will catch up.

Alice smiled as she covered her body with intensive holy magic, which was just to cover the dark aura of her teleporting to Cain. CLING! She appeared right beside Cain and smiled. People never heard of a healer that can teleport which made them instantly think of how much power she must be hiding.

Gracie who was silently watching, her body vertically sunk in her shadow and appeared right beside Cain.

When Sofia looked at them and heard the crowd cheering, she wanted to blast herself with [Burning feet] in a flashy way but soon erased that thought from her head when she heard something behind her.

Cling! Cling! Jemima was sharpening the butchering knife while glaring at Sofia from the window. A cold stare in her eyes.

‘She would kill me in my sleep if I burned a single flower!’ Sofia could feel it in her bones. That maid never got over Suzan’s (The plant that Sylph used) death.

Since her dress had the upper part of her back exposed, Sofia thought it was best to just use her wings.

CRACK! Two massive draconic wings emerged from her back as the horns crowned her head. Unlike Alice who couldn’t fly well at the start, Sofia only had problems controlling her flight. She can’t hover or fly slowly, but she can flap her wings hard and blast herself ahead.

Unlike the others, Sofia ended up head-butting Zaleria’s head. “Careful there, don’t fly at such speed if you can’t control it!” Zaleria yelled as she grabbed Sofia and put her on her head.

People watching had no words to say and no more expression on their faces.

“This should give small thugs and hooligans a reason to stay out of our way in the future,” Alice said to Cain as she remembered the thugs trying to attack them in Ourals. It was sad seeing them die at Cain’s or Gracie’s hands when they could have lived. This whole show was Alice trying to give any stupid criminal who was planning on using Cain’s wives against him a second chance at life.

‘If they never attacked, they will never be killed.’

Then suddenly, Zaleria shifted her north violently with a serious glare.

Cain managed to keep everyone on their feet with [Telekinesis] but he was also surprised, “What is it? A dragon attack?” That was the only thing that can get Zaleria this worked out that Cain knew of.

“That’s what I thought but it seems I was wrong. Probably just a passing one since his presence disappeared.” It was just for the blink of a second but she felt the slight presence of a dragon.

“As you said, dragons travel all the time so it was probably just passing by,” Cain assured her, they wanted to attack they could have already done it.

“You’re right,” Zaleria replied as she slowly turned her head and started walking toward the church for the public engagement.

…

On one of the city walls towers, at the peak beside the flag. An old woman was sitting with a wound on her right forearm. She looked at her arm with a sad look on her face, “I’m running out of time, my bones crumble, and my flesh withers. But I still need to keep going…” She licked the wound and it healed instantly.

She slowly looked with her emerald green eyes toward the wedding, her eyes falling on Cain and Sofia. “Such a beautiful moment.” A teardrop fell from her eye.

The old lady quickly wiped it out, “What am I doing, I left everything when I decided to do this.” She said looking behind her. Tens of miles ahead lies the corpse of a green great wyrm.

The old woman then looked at her abandoned bath, “I build such a place just so we can meet, even went through the trouble of making the hot spring. What a shame to see it collecting dust.” The old lad stood up stretching her old bones and causing them to crack.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That lizard never holds back, how many great wyrms he had sent yet?” She looked behind her into the far distance, far beyond what both Cain and Zaleria could feel. Two great wyrms were rushing toward the city.

The old lady jumped from the tower and her body disintegrated into fire and ash.

A blue and a white great wyrm were flying as fast as they could while camouflaged. Their goal was to kill the one who sealed Shan the earth dragon.

Suddenly, the blue one’s vision darkened as his head was severed from his body. Before he could go into a rage, his whole body was consumed by a wave of blue and white flames.

The white dragons quickly stooped to see where the offense is, he was already thinking of running away and reporting this. There aren’t a lot of creatures who could kill a great wyrm that easily.

“My back hurts, my throat is sore…would you mind dropping dead on your own?” When the white dragon looked up to see who was talking.

His eyes opened wide as he looked up into the sky.

A multi-colored five-headed dragon was staring at him, that this had almost no presence to speak off yet it was clear what it was at the first glance.

“Weren’t you dead?” The dragon said his last word before being torn apart.

The five-headed dragon looked at the white dragon corpse falling. “Such a rude thing to say to an old lady.”

The five-headed dragon landed on the ground and looked at its wings, they were already tearing apart from carrying her massive weight. Her collarbone has already snapped from just flapping her wings and her hind legs have just shattered when she landed.

“I guess he was right, my body is nearing its end and crying for death. But I need to hold for longer, at least until everyone is ready!” She said as she licked her wounds to heal them.
