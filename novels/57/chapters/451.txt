Cain looked at his father, “I will take care of him. You go rest.”

Chad clenched a fist and looked down at the dragon, “No, not going anywhere until I finished this thing!” He growled.

Cain immediately flew away and Chad leaped to the side when the dragons moved.

“You haven’t even shaved a third of his HP, forgot about killing him. Most of that damage is probably done by whatever sliced his tail and punctured his chest.” Cain didn’t count blinding one of the dragon’s eyes. He knew they still had a long way to finish this thing.

“A third you say?” Chad stared at Cain in surprise, he expected it to be much more. And if what Cain said was right, the arrows send from the capital and Kayden are the only ones damaging this thing.

“Yeah, this aura, Kayden what was you this whole time?” Cain flew toward Kayden.

“Killing monsters and fighting other demons. Unlike you, I haven’t been fooling around with girls.” Kayden replied, one of his three heads looking at Cain while the other two kept Dakin (The dragon) in check.

‘Is this what Jack would have become had he lived? Glad he’s dead’ Cain thought. No wonder Kayden sliced a Great wyrm’s tail, he’s been feeding on demons and monsters all this time.

“Who’s jack?” Kayden asked. He was able to hear Cain’s thoughts.

Cain immediately lifted one of his fingers and created a mental barrier around him. It was bad to allow Kayden to listen to his thoughts.

“A demon who tried to kill us before, he was Alice’s brother. Had to kill him.” Cain replied.

“You killed him and took his sister? Nasty…”

“Don’t give me that look, you’re the last one I want to get it from. We have a dragon to kill so let’s go.” Cain lifted his blade. He had to admit, he was more comfortable fighting alongside Kayden than Farryn. He was more focused and easier to talk with.

Cain took a deep breath. ‘If time slow won’t work then I just need to use something better.’ [Time Stop] Contrary to the name, the spell didn’t actually stop time. It was just a [Time Slow] but sacrificing duration to slow time to an almost halt.

In numbers, [Time Slow] has a 60-second duration from the user perspective and slowed time to 10% of the original speed at a cost of around 1024MP if the full duration was used.

[Time Stop] on the other hand has a 6 Second duration from the user’s perspective and slowed time to a 1% of the original speed at a similar MP cost.

Cain allowed only himself and Kayden to move freely at that time. [True Polymorph] [Thunder Flash]

After taking the shape of Eilistraee, Cain charged ahead in a lightning bolt and Kayden followed him at a matching speed. One was using magic to accelerate while the other relied on his raw strength.

Dakin wasn’t taking it easy as well, even though time was slowed to an almost halt. His body glowed red as he started moving, using his flames to accelerate and match them.

Opening his Jaw, Dakin released a massive fire breath. Kayden and Cain can’t just dodge as that will waste time. Also, the capital was behind them so dodging meant that it will get wiped out. This dragon was keen on killing Cain no matter what.

Cain jumped ahead [Prismatic wall] He created the wall flying ahead of them to deflect the breath. CRACK! The wall quickly cracked, the breath was strong and the time was slowed, the wall quickly got overwhelmed. [Prismatic wall] a second Cast allowed them to reach Dakin.

A blast of raging flames erupted from his body, swinging his claw at Cain. Kayden leaped in blocking it with one of his swords and then slashing with his other five. If one sword strike wasn’t enough, then six in the same spot were able to sever the dragon’s hand.

Cain leaped on Kayden’s back using his as a platform to leap toward the dragon’s chest, he didn’t care about the flames. He needs to cut the Draconis fundamentum as quickly as possible.

Dakin twisted his body to the side and flapped his wing down at Cain to block him. The flames intensified.

Cain didn’t slow down, he was confident that [Investiture of flames] and the ring at his back will absorb the damage. As if stepping on air, he swung his blade at Dakin’s bulky chest.

Kayden leaped toward Dakin’s hind legs as he saw him about to take off to the sky. [Demon Blade: Charging Slash] With another six consecutive strikes to the same spot he severed Dakin’s hind lift leg.

At that moment, Dakin’s left claw pierced Cain’s side as he swung at him. The claw was too big that it could sever Cain in half if he didn’t do anything.

[Telekinesis] Cain moved his own body with telekinesis to mitigate the damage. Even though he was left with a hole in his internal organs, since the time was slowed, nothing spilled out yet. His body was too fragile to face a 60-strength monster.

But, [Blade Dance] wasn’t a skill that could be stopped by a mere hole to the guts. Using his leg and Dakin’s claw as a platform, he added a spinning motion to his slash as he kept flying toward Dakin’s chest.

Kayden leaped up and stabbed Dakin in the side and started cutting upward the chest. [Demon Blade: Disembowel]

Cain’s blade flew downward Dakin’s chest with a crackled of lightning, aiming at the Draconis fundamentum.

To the watcher, it happened in the blink of an eye. Two flashes of light, one white and the other black Zapped around Dakin.
