Elena and Selena moved back to their home to butcher and bring some of the bison meat.

Zaleria went to take a bath and relax a bit. She has been extremely active those last days.

Seeing how in shock Seith was, Cain took him outside for a walk. It would be best for him to relax and smell the flowers.

Cain did want to go check on the Kenku villagers that were saved by the druids and dragon fang but he decided to leave that for later. Reith would have rushed there anyway.

Seith surprised Jemima who was passing by the hallway. In the shade, he looked like a massive humanoid monster with his jaguar head. However, the sight of Cain by his side made her relax.

“Master, we’ve been awaiting your arrival. Sebas has been awaiting your arrival.” Jemima said with a smile.

Cain smiled, she seem to have finally gotten over the death of her plant Suzan. “I understand, is there anything else?” Cain asked.

“Nothing major, just don’t touch any of the new plants” Her smile was somewhat scary.

[Summon fey: Mei]: Cain summoned Mei into his palm. “How are you doing my king? Did you need me?” Mei flew to his face and started flying around his head.

“A spirit of the forest, how can such a thing be here?” Seith seemed to know them. Pixies were known as shy creatures that rarely show themselves. Add to that they only take a liking to elves and druids.

“See, this is my maid Jemima. I want to help her with her garden if possible.” Said Cain.

Mei slowly turned her head toward the shocked Jemima. She scanned her from head to toes and then gave her a dubious look. “I guess I can make it work, I never taught a human before after all,” Mei said as she crossed her legs mid-air.

“Then please do.” Cain smiled as he walked away with Seith.

Mei flew toward Jemima and hid in her clothes, “Get ready, big girl. The training going to make you want to cry!” Mei yelled with a fist up.

“Training?” Jemima was at a loss of words. They were supposed to care for the garden, not train.

…

When Cain walked outside, he saw a bunch of people that were standing at the mansion door run away. “What were they doing?” Seith asked as he saw them. Their behavior was considered strange in the Black-jaguar village.

Cain also seemed to get a bit worried, he didn’t sense any inn intent from them.

“Master. Here you are.” Sebas rushed toward Cain as he has something to talk about. For that Sebas ordered the maids to bring them some tea as they sat in the garden.

Diana brought them the tea, seeing her Cain remembered the thigh highs he ordered. Cain signaled to her to come close. “Are the things I ordered done? Did Lexi manage to get them?”

“They have been ready long ago, would you like me to distribute them?” She said nervously. “Please do, and thanks for your efforts.

Diana bowed slightly and turned around to rush toward the mansion. Her left foot hit her right one just as she was walking on the uneven grass.

[Telekinesis] Cain caught her before she could fall again. The reason for her constant falls seems to be her nervousness.

“Calm down, you don’t have to be that nervous,” Cain told her with a smile. Diana slowly left as she tried to calm down.

“So back to our subject, what did you need me for?” Cain asked with a serious face.

Ahem! Sebas cleared his throat as he pulled a paper from his pocket. “After you left, a lot of nobles came to visit and establish connections. Some even requested balls to be held in the name of the white mage.” Sebas gave the list to Cain.

When Cain read them, they were mostly girls. He looked at Sebas. “What is this?”

“The easier way for them to establish diplomatic relations shit is through marriage and service. Those are people who asked for marriage or knighthood, there are even some who are looking for work as maids or servants.” Sebas replied as he pulled a second paper.

“Those are the people who invited you to balls and parties, I did refuse most of them since you were away,” Sebas said.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Good job. To be honest I would have refused even if I was here.” Cain replied as he took a sip from his tea.

“I did expect so,” Sebas replied.

“Should I be here?” Seith asked. Even he could tell that this was some kind of political discussion.

“Yeah, there won’t be a problem. It’s like this is that important.” Cain smiled as he looked at Seith. This was his father-in-law.

“For how to act, refuse all the regular requests. If there was any strange, one then handed it over to me. I wouldn’t mind giving them a second look.” Cain tried to read the paper.

“Well there is a unique one among them, check at the middle in the N names,” Sebas said with an exhausted smile.

“Noel Skyler Ruris. What is the princess name doing here?” Cain exclaimed as he saw the princess’s name on the list. She must have left it there before leaving.

“Even the princess is coming after you.” Seith looked at the list. He then remembered Selena jumping at birds when she was little and imagined the dignified princess leading an army. Did his daughter just get an unbeatable opponent?

“Send them a letter that says, NO thank you,” Cain told Sebas and the butler nodded. Seith just stared at Cain who casually refused the hand of a princess.

“Are you sure about that?” Said Seith. Now he was worried that the princess might try and take revenge on his daughter.

“That princess is just a sweaty, meat-head knight. I don’t blame them for trying to get me to their side but they are too desperate.” Cain replied with a thinking face.

“Isn’t Selena the same?” Seith replied. From what he knew, his daughter was nothing short of a meat-head like himself. She only knew how to deal with problems with her fists, laze in the sunlight and hunt prey.

“You’re right but Selena does it well. If we compare them with strength, Selena is far superior to that wanna-be knight. In terms of beauty, Selena also wins by a landslide. Putting them side by side makes the princess look like a hulking man who slapped a few makeups on his face.” Cain said as he took a sip from his tea.

Cain then stood up, he still had a lot of things to do.

“Where are we going?” Seith asked.

“To the adventurers’ guild, I do intend on taking some quests in preparation for the wedding,” Cain said as he stretched his arms.

“But we don’t lack money, if it is some rare ingredient I can ask the merchants for you,” Sebas said as he stood as well.

Cain shook his head, what he needed can’t be found on the market.

“I need dungeon cores, a lot of them.” Cain smiled.

“Why is that?” Sebas asked. He remembered that Ourals lord was also looking for cores before.

“I want to create waypoints between Ourals and Furberg for people to travel with. Of course, people would have to pay to use it.” Said Cain as he waved his hand and created a small cube of magic.

“But what does it have to do with the marriage?” Sebas asked. Even though the idea seemed impossible for him, he knew that Cain could pull it off.

“A show of power and our intent to help people. When I marry Marina as a concubine people are bound to speak up and ask for her to be the only wife or at least an official wife. To counter them I will create that before the wedding.” Cain explained and Sebas’s eyes opened wide.

“Such a creation would be too convenient for both noble and merchants, even the commoners would find it life-saving if we make it cheap enough. And if they tasted how convenient it is, they would be afraid to lose it if they speak up.” Sebas said as he seemed to catch quickly.

“Exactly, and since I will make them pass by the maze I can keep an eye on them at all times.” Cain smiled as he walked toward the gate with Seith, they will head to the guild immediately.
