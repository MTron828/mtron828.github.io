“Kaydeeeen!” One of the cultists took her hood off and approached Kayden with a smile. Her eyes were glowing like the unstable desire inside of her. A succubus had approached him with all her charms at high gears.

“Shut up, bitch!” Kayden flashed immediately and slashed her head off. “I’m sick of the like of you!” Kayden seemed to be unaffected by her charm or to be more precise, he did not see her charming at all. With his madness, she looked like nothing but a female dog barking at him.

…

On the other side of the fight, Sofia flew at top speed and kicked one of the cultists in the face. [Burning feet] She flew toward the second one and then used [Flame blade] and stabbed him in the chest.

Selena was running in her jaguar form mauling anyone that came in her way. Gracie was silently killing any archers or long-ranged cultists. If someone pulled a bow or a throwing knife, she would appear behind them and slit their throats.

Zaleria was doing what she does best and killing as many as she can without burning the whole village. Lily and the Pixies were transporting potions and the injured out of the battlefield.

Alen had recovered by drinking a few MP potions and was trying to help with his magic. [Mass suggestion: Drop your weapons] His magic compelled a lot of cultists to open their palms dropping their weapons.

[Earth wall] Alen then created a wall of stone to protect Selena from a fireball. He was focusing on defense and crowd control. There is one reason for that, those types of spells consumed less MP than attack magic. That means the melee fighters (Selena and Zaleria who trying not to burn the whole place)

“You fire girl, you’re wasting MP!” Alen yelled as he saw Sofia charge a dragon breath and used it to kill only three cultists. With how big the spell was, he assumed the MP cost was high enough that it was inefficient to use it like that.

“This is how I fight!” Sofia yelled back at him. Cain had told her before that she was the one sucking more MP from him. Now even the Guildmaster had noticed that.

“Use your magic to group them up, melee fighters can fight longer than us mages. It is always better to support them than to act alone.” Alen said as he tried to demonstrate that. [Firebolt] [Firebolt] [Firebolt]

By just using three first-tier spells and forcing the cultists to dodge into one spot. He managed to group five people in the same place for Selena to maul down.

“Use only first-tier spells, don’t waste your MP on higher-tier magic. Also, don’t keep jumping into the middle of the enemy like a fighter!” Alen yelled at her as she flashed between four cultists and flash-burned them with [Burning body]

“Don’t order me around. I’m more comfortable fighting like this!” Sofia yelled back at him. Sofia knew that she was wasting her MP, but now they are in a fight, she can’t just change her style. She wasn’t even able to predict where the enemy would dodge so she could group them.

“I technically can, you’re an adventure in my guild!” Alen yelled. He was right he was her boss.

Alen swung his staff, concentrating a lot of magic on the tip [Bigby’s Hand] A large spectral hand appeared out of nowhere. Alen swung his staff to move and grabbed a handful of the cultists. “Here they come!” Alen yelled as he tossed them toward Zaleria. The witch quickly conjured a ray of flames and burned them to ash.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I only take orders from Cain!” Sofia yelled back at him as increased her heart. [Burning feet] [Burning body] A large burst of flame erupted from under her. The heat alone was enough to fend off all the cultists around her.

Swoosh! Her body launched like a red flash through the cultists’ ranks. The moment she reached one of the commanders, she dodged his attack to the side and grabbed him by the hair.

Swoosh! Her body spun and she flew above him. [Firestorm] She sun around at extreme speed and created a small tornado of flames. Pulling any lightweight cultist that was close toward her and burning them to ash. [Fireball] “Explode!” The entire tornado exploded killing everyone who was lucky enough to survive.

Sofia landed on the burning ember, “How many were there? I didn’t count.” Sofia said as she stared at the remaining cultists. Her face was almost invisible, only her eyes glowed red.

A sense of terror started building up in them, out of all people here she was the last one they wanted to fight. No one wanted to burn and die slowly by her flames.

“Haha, fighting like a Red even though you haven’t fully awakened. Nevertheless, the old man is right. You still don’t have enough magic to fight like that.” Zaleria laughed. Sofia fought more and more like a dragon each time she saw her. Red dragons are fiery, violent, and raging. They don’t use small tricks or rely on others. In battle, they rush forward and burn everything in their wake.

When stories are told of kingdoms laid waste, a valiant hero is sent home as charred charcoal. Armies being cooked alive, and countless maidens sacrificed. When you hear about a crazy feat that the dragons achieve, it was mostly the mighty Red dragons.

In a fact, the dragon who delivered the last blow to their god was a Red Dragon. Legend says the whole sky turned red from the heat of his claws.

“Fine, I will slow down if you said it.” Sofia agreed with Zaleria. She should slow a bit as she might be a burden when her MP runs dry.

“What was your name, Sofia? What a beautiful name.” She heard the sweet whispers of a man behind her. She slowly turned back with a smile.

“Come close, I have something fun…” The man opened his arms to call her in.

“Kill him,” Sofia said with a smile. From the shadows, Gracie jumped swinging her knife.

“What!” The man yelled as he was caught off guard, his charm didn’t work on her.

Gracie swung her blade at the thing. She could feel his presence in her bones. This thing was an incubus. But, it wasn’t Meliliana, it was another one.

She wasn’t afraid, instead, she felt nothing. The only thing in her mind was the desire to kill him. The incubus dodged her blow and countered with a kick.

[Blink] The kick fazed right through her body. Ziii! A shiny wire emerged from her wrist and wrapped around the incubus’s leg.

Tuf! She spat right in his face.

[Thunderwave] A massive shock wave emerged from the incubus’s body and repelled Gracie away. “You disrespectful…”

She was already back behind him, with no delay. She teleported to him after the Thunderwave ended. Slash! He dodged to the side but she still took off his arm.

Thud! She didn’t wait nor slow her swing, she simply redirected it toward him again in a continuous motion.

The incubus pulled a shive and blocked her slash. Stab! An iron nail pierced his crotch. GRAAA! As he cried in pain. The maid wrapped a wire around his neck and beheaded him on the spot.

“You finished?” Sofia asked as she dropped a burned corpse. She killed another incubus while Gracie was dealing with that one.

“We’re surrounded by them,” Gracie replied. They were surrounded by incubuses.

Sofia could avoid their charm with her charisma. Gracie’s mental situation made her resistant to such temptation. They were somewhat safe in that department. But what worried Sofia the most is the numbers, they were easily over ten of them. She could even see some cultist women twitching on the ground and moaning.

“This is bad.” Said Sofia.
