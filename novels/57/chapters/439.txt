Close to the Ironlake, a group of shady-looking people was rushing through the foliage. “Are you sure this is the way?” One of them cried looking at their leader.

“Are you doubting me? This business is going to make us rich!” Jack parrot replied with a smirk.

“It’s not about getting rich, we don’t like dealing with slaves.” One of them cried.

Jack stopped and turned toward him. “Listen, I will explain one last time. We’re not selling slaves, we’re just taking off the job of delivering them.” Jack waved his hands.

“We get the money, the slaves, set sail, and instead of delivering them, we set them free. Easy money.” Jack smiled.

“But we’re busted after one order!” Another man complained.

“That won’t matter, sea trips take weeks to months. I bet we can fake several sails in our month stay here.” Jack wasn’t staying without business, and his first target is scamming was Ironlake lord. He heard the man was trading in slaves to bolster the mine’s workforce.

When Jack’s group reached the Ironlake land, they found it a less impressive shape expected.

“Captain, this place is in worse shape than we expected. Are you sure they have the money to hire a pirate crew like us?” One of the men said looking at Jack with a skeptical gaze.

“Sure they have, this is the richest Lord on this ground. He controls the biggest mine in the Kingdom.” Jack said proudly with his findings.

“I don’t know captain, but this seems like a bad idea to me.” Another man said.

“Come on boys. This is my first big Job try and be supportive at least once.” Jack cried.

“We’re trying to be supportive. We can’t let our new Capitan screw his first job because it was a stupid Idea.”

“We’re already here so no backing down,” Jack said turning around to continue his way.

…

Cain was sitting on a couch in the Ironlake mansion glaring at Lord Ironlake in the eyes.

“Do you know the situation this place is in?”

Lord Ironlake looked like he was in a trance under Cain’s dominant person. “I know, it’s in shambles.” He mumbled.

“For what, I doubt you lack funds. The mine is enough for you to live in luxury with the people.” Cain said with a hit of anger in his voice.

“We were funding the armed force, by Iron and not money.”

After thinking for a moment, Cain concluded that Ironlake was supplying the other nobles with Iron for free to arm their men for the rebellion. He then had to force the miner to work harder and produce more to hide the amount he embezzled. This was how he managed to fool the king’s inspectors.

Lord Ironlake confirmed that Cain was right. It was like that.

“Now for the part, I don’t want to talk about.” Cain sighed looking at Isbert and Nemmoxon.

“How did you increase the mine’s output?” Cain asked after making sure he was calm enough not to chop the lord’s head immediately.

“Before the winter, I bought children from the families who can’t support them in the harsh cold to make them work as porters in the mine. The mines and the porters were kept in separate sections and regulated with a tight schedule so they won’t meet.”

Cain stood up and looked at Isbert, “See, this is why humans never advanced in the past centuries. Instead of hiring a decent mage with earth, teleport, or telekinetic spells to work as a porter, or rattle their heads to create a golem or a useful magic item. They just jump to the easiest solution, get slaves to do the hard work.” Cain pointed toward the lord.

“Why are you telling that to me?” She looked at him, feeling as if he was blaming her.

“So in the future, you know the right way to act in those situations.” Cain smiled.

“And that is?” Nemmoxon looked at him. She dealt with illegal slavers before and her judgment was always letting them starve to death on an isolated island.

“This!” Cain turned around punching the lord in the face. CRACK! That caused him to fall from the chair and smack his bleeding nose on the ground.

“We’re tearing the whole place down,” Cain said.

“The whole mansion?” Nemmoxon said with a worried face.

“No, the mine. We’re going there to free everyone and let the people know what this man did.”

“You intend to let the people judge him? That will cause problems.” Isbert stood, “It’s better to let the court deal with him, be it a life sentence or death penalty.” She said.

“Nobles always get it easy, I’m not that versed in law, and I’m not a politician. Do with him what you like, just get us the information about the nobles beforehand.” Cain looked at the lord.

“Then I will take him back to the capital with Nemmoxon, you will stay here to free the slaves. Are you sure you will be fine alone?” She asked.

“I’m not alone, she is here as well.” Gracie appeared from behind his shadow, “I could also call Alice, Mei, and a lot more if the need arises.” Cain grabbed his sword and walked out.

Looking back at the lord, Isbert snorted as she dragged him by the collar. The guards couldn’t do anything as this was the princess. Lord Ironlake himself confirmed that.

“Excuse me your highness, the lord, can you let him go?” A well-fitted soldier asked.

“He committed a grave crime, stand down or you will be dragged with him,” Isbert growled.

“By the contract made with the king. In case a noble is suspected of committing a crime, they are considered innocent until proven guilty by hard evidence or witness. One noble word is counted as ten commons and you need fifteen witnesses. In the unfortunate case of being proven guilty, they are to be escorted from their mansion by the royal guard to face court, and that is with a written royal decree.” The man stooped to take a deep breath.

“By that law, I ask you respectfully to let our lord free.” He said with a serious face.

Isbert could confirm, all of his words were true. And what are they doing now is breaking the law? She looked toward Cain as if asking for help.

Cain noticed her and said. “You made that contract with the king?”

“Yep, it’s a law and must be respected.” The man replied.

“Fine…” Cain scratched his head, “Give me the contract to read it, I never heard of such a thing.” Cain extended his hand to the man and started shaking his fingers as if asking for money.

“I don’t have it, it was signed by the king and…”

“Let me tell you one thing…” Cain approached the man with an intense glare, “We let him with you so you can help him escape the country, we let him here so you can cover up what he did, we let him here so you can get the other nobles time to act.” Cain started knocking on the man’s chest with his fist.

“Look outside that window, see the mine. If a found a single dead child there, this pig is dead. Hear my words, kids, if your children aren’t there, your relatives’ children are.” Cain glared at all the soldiers.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But…”

“Go out there and make sure every last one of them is safe and healthy. And prey to whomever you worship that the first queen never hears of this or you’re all dead.” Cain growled.

…

In the Capital’s church, a woman was prying in front of Chauntea’s statue. “May the blessing of the land be on…”

“Mother, can you come back for a moment? A dragon has just appeared in the courtyard and the white mage’s father took him down.” Sara said approaching her mother.

“We’re under Chauntea’s protection, he was merely a convoy of her will.” She replied.

“Mom, you might be the pope but can you stop saying that?” Sara sighed.

“I can’t, we’ve been deprived of decent rainfall this winter. It barely ever snowed around here. She is but angry at us, and I can’t hear her words to say for what.” Sara’s mother said praying again.

“It’s not like you care, you married father despite being a pope. Let’s go!” Sara pulled her mother away, Chauntea might have stopped speaking to her years ago, but she didn’t rob her cleric powers.

“Ara, Sara…let me go, you’re pulling on my dress!” The first queen cried.
