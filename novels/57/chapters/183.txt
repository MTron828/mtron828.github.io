Spindle dragged Selena away as fast as he could, he did know how strong Kayden was but an upper rank was something else. His long life in hell was engraved by the terror that ensue from their existence.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“You maggots!” Meliliana twisted her body and pushed Sofia away with a kick. [Command: Don’t move a muscle] She used the same spell that worked the last time.

[Fireball] “Heh?” Meliliana gasped as she saw Sofia unaffected, the fireball exploded in her face. The spell [Command] had a trigger, the target must hear the command for it to work, now Sofia wasn’t even listening so the spell had no effect.

“Fine by me, I will tear you apart with my hands!” Meliliana screamed as she used one of her best spells [Illusory Creation]

As shadows gathered, a spectral ghost was formed and from it, another Meliliana appeared. “Now you won’t…” Sofia’s image blurred in front of her.

“Why do you enjoy that?” Sofia’s words caused Meliliana to freeze in place.

‘Wait, what is she talking about?’ Meliliana questioned what she was saying, something inhuman was rising in the girl in front of her.

‘What led you to do such a thing?” With those words, Sofia’s body was engulfed by blue and crimson flames.

“What did you take Gracie for?” Sofia’s eyes were that of a dragon, she stared at Meliliana with pure blood lust.

The moment Meliliana stressed the slave link between Sofia and Gracie, fragments of memories flooded from Gracie to Sofia. Memories of what she has gone through and what she has suffered, Sofia felt as if she has relived those moments herself which caused her blood to boil. The dragon whose blood she inherited must be dead before she could access his power, but Zaleria was still alive. Both Zaleria and Morena at the distance recognized the magic, now that it has started to appear.

The two sisters were of different breeds of dragons, a red and a black dragon. It was clear that they only shared one of their parents if any. For someone to inherit dragon blood, a dragon must be in their family tree and that dragon must be dead.

“Mother?” Zaleria gasped as she could feel magic similar to that of her mother in the air, it was a bit different but she could tell the nostalgia. Both Zaleria and her mother had similar magic, they were mother and daughter after all. When Sofia’s magic was weak, Zaleria felt it and thought it was similar to hers, she was mistaken.

Zaleria was still alive, there was no way Sofia would inherit her blood yet. The one She was drawing her power from was Zaleria’s dead mother who was nicknamed the purgatory dragon.

“What is that?” Meliliana screamed as she saw the flames raging from Sofia’s body. “Don’t mess with me!” [Dominate person: Puppet master]

Meliliana Cast the spell on herself. ‘Exceed your limit and dance!’ [Dominate person] was a spell usually used to control other people and force them to act temporarily. It was the spell she used to fight Cain hand to hand the first time, it allowed her to exceed her physical limits.

Meliliana’s body disappeared as she used [Short invisibility].

Thud! She appeared again as she was punching Sofia in the guts, sending her rolling backward. “Heh! You’re hot, but nothing special!” She disappeared again. Thud! This time she kicked the fallen Sofia away.

…

‘What is this?’ Sofia said as her head seemed to be about to explode from the pain. Her vision was all red and orange, she could see nothing else but a small shadow closing at her.

She felt something kick her in the guts, the sharp pain immediately stopped as it mixed with a burning sensation. ‘My ears are ringing, I feel hot, my body is on fire.’ Sofia thought as she was Kicked.

‘Why can’t I see, what is this thing covering my vision?’ She wondered as she felt as if submerged in hot water it was a good feeling if she had to say.

A gentle hand Laid on Sofia’s body, and a cold feeling of relief washed over her. [Holy Healing]

AGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! AGRAAAAAAAAAAA! Meliliana was twisting on the ground wailing in agony as her skin started to boil and fall off, new skin reappeared and got burned immediately. Each time she tried to use her magic the pain prevented her from concentrating.

“You, You DEVIL!” She cried in pain.

It was simple, Alice’s cursed magic cause her skin to rot and fall, healing magic then healed that skin and the cycle repeated again and again. each time the circle repeated the effect increased in strength, like a now ball rolling off a cliff. Meliliana was looking into that torturous cycle of hell.

Just like the sinners in hell, she will neither die nor live. She will just exist and feel pain. What made it even worse was that the effect was only carried by Alice’s aura alone. This thing activated only two times until now.

The first time was when she was about to awaken as a devil and she used it to burn her brother by instinct. And now was the second time, when she decided to give a taste of the pain Gracie was feeling.

Not using this ability, and letting people she face standing in her presence without having a taste of hell was the mercy this Devil gave them.

Crackle! The dome of darkness that Kayden created broke and a lightning bolt raced across the sky. It zapped in the sky for several seconds carrying a black mass before finally crashing in front of Alice. It was Cain.

He was in a bad condition. His whole body was covered in blood, Several cuts ran across his chest, and the flesh on his left thigh was shredded to the point she could see the bone. The necrotic blue marking is covering his whole body so they were the only thing keeping him hanging to like at that point.

“Cain!” She screamed rushing to heal him, Alice had forgotten everyone else, and the only thought on her mind was to keep Cain alive. [Holy Healing] [Holy Healing]

“Thank god, it’s working!” Alice sighed in relief as she felt her magic working on Cain.

“Such a monster, leaving in this state!” The cold voice came from behind Alice, it wasn’t that of Meliliana who was still sobbing from the pain. It was the deep voice of a man she heard before.

She turned around and saw Kayden standing behind her. His torso armor was almost burned off, a deep cut ran across his two left eyes. And his whole body was covered in scars and burn marks from Cain’s lightning. It was baffling how he was still standing after suffering so much.

“How did you manage to get your Mana into my wounds? That was a clever trick to stop my regeneration.” Kayden took a deep breath, lifting his sword with an ominous aura.

“This is where you die, a talent like you would be forgotten from this world!” Kayden swung his sword at an incredible speed.

Clank! Crack! A fist punched his sword directly back into his face. Crack! Another punch lifted him off the ground. “ROAAAAAAAAAAAR!” Her roar rumbled as deep as that of Zaleria. Her fangs pierced the demon’s leg and dragged him away.

“Selena!” Alice called to her but she didn’t listen.

“My lady.” Spindle called Alice, “She won’t hear you, Spindle saw her pass out due to the demons illusion magic. Now that she has woken up and smelled Master’s blood in the air, she is overwhelmed by rage, grief, and shame. She won’t stop until that demon is torn into a million pieces!” Spindle said with confidence.

Selena went berserk at the wounded Kayden. Each of her strikes carried the will to tear him apart.

Kayden looked down at her, she was still in her top condition while he was weakened. If he didn’t do anything she might be able to finish him off. He took his stance and twisted his hips, Kicking her in the face and pulling his leg from her jaw.

“Unlike that man’s Mana infested attacks, yours are easy to heal.” He said as his leg immediately healed from her bite. It was only a matter of time before Cain dies and his magic disappear. Kayden was confident that he will win at that moment.

[Demon blade] [Blade flow] [Triple Slash] Kayden took a heavy step and slashed at the blindly charging Selena.

Stab! A sharp object pierced his back before he could slash and Selena took the opening to smash him in the face. Gracie had thrown one of her knives at him, her body was still shaking and she could barely stand but she still pushed ahead, she didn’t want to let her past stand in her way. For some reason, hearing Meliliana’s screams of pain gave her the courage to stand again.

‘Even though I’m almost double his level, that man managed to drive me this far.’ Kayden thought, ‘I can see why Lady Morena was interested in him to that extent.’

[Demon will Sword] Kayden was done playing games and his body disappeared.
