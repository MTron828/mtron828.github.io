Cain silently looked at her, was she knowledgeable about massages? She didn’t seem like the person to pick an interest in that field. “Well my back is hurting and my muscles are sore, especially my thighs as I just walked a lot, I will be counting on you,” Cain said as he leaned on Selena. Gracie is watching him relax for a bit.

After a few minutes, Gracie got out of the tub and filled a bucket with hot water, and started splashing it on the ground. “What are you doing?” Cain asked, “Heating the ground.” Her answer was straightforward as usual. Cain could deduce that he will be laying there, his chest isn’t going to be like that.

“Can I lay on Selena’s instead of the ground?” Upon hearing Cain’s joke Gracie looked back at him and replied “She isn’t flat.” A fair answer in Cain’s dictionary.

“Master, please lay on your stomach here.” She told him and he quickly complied.

Cain closed his eyes and relaxed, quickly enough he felt something strange on his back, and it was crushing his spine. CRACK! CRACK! It popped like knuckles.

“Can you give me an explanation about why are you standing on my back?” Cain asked, Gracie was standing on his back, slowly stepping on his spine and shoulders.

“Yamauba taught me this, she said Takeshi loves it after training. Its name is Ashiatsu.” She replied and Cain wasn’t buying it, “I bet it because she couldn’t muster the strength to give him a massage in any other way other than using her full body weight!” Cain’s weak body wasn’t in a shape to support Gracie’s weight and it was getting hard to breathe.

“Can you get down, you’re crushing my back!” As Cain told her she quickly stepped down, “This first try ended a failure. You won’t get punished for almost breaking my back if you nailed the rest!” Cain threatened her, his back was hurting more than before and his chest had visible marks from the ground.

“Sorry…” She apologized as she started using her hands to gently stroke his back, “This is better but do you mind leaving my back alone for some time? It just has been crushed you see…”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Gracie looked down at his thighs, he did say they were sore so she went for them next.

“Ok this is unbelievable, tonight you’re dancing to entertain me,” Cain said as felt something press on his sore back, As Gracie tried to massage his thighs she rested her knee on his back.

Even though her expression never changed, Cain could tell how much she was nervous using her sharp jolts when spoke. Luckily for her, just changing her position was enough to make her job easier.

After a while, Cain started to feel hot and dizzy, the heat got to him quicker than before as he was weaker and with a lower constitution. As she noticed that, Gracie asked Selena to carry him back to the changing room where she clothed him.

After a short trip with Selena, he was back in his room before he could even realize it, Gracie quickly entered with a tray of food.

Cain could eat alone but since Gracie started feeding him he stayed silent, he didn’t mind being fed by her as it meant he could focus more on resting. Selena on the other hand did something strange, she snuck under his blanket.

“Selena, Gracie is here you know?” Cain complained, “I don’t mind, please let her continue if it doesn’t bother you!” Gracie said to him as she looked at the bulged blanket.

Cain quickly felt something sucking on his, sadly with how exhausted he was, the hardest he could get was still soft. Selena kept going at it anyway.

Soon enough, Gracie finished feeding him and took the tray away, as they were alone in the room Cain lifted the blanket at taking a look at Selena.

“Cain you let me go already? Nothing will come out with how I’m now.” Cain told her who was going at it non-stop. Cain decided to help her, “Miko will be coming soon so…” Cain grabbed her head and pushed himself as deep as he could get, quickly giving her what she wanted.

After that Miko came with Gracie in tow. It was time for her lesson. Alice and Sofia have also returned and they were taking a bath according to Gracie.

Time flew by and it was already night and Miko still had a long way to go, Cain estimated another day or two. It was still a record if Miko managed to pull it in this short time.

Cain was well aware that this is his last day walking and moving around, tomorrow he will be too weak to even stand up from his bed. As if not to waste time he did a few loops around his room with Alice’s help. Sofia had gone with Gracie to bring them dinner.

Cain started Alice who was helping him walk around the room, feeling his body getting weaker with the minutes he thought about when he will become an old man. Alice is an ageless devil, by that time she wouldn’t have changed a bit and she will most likely help him walk just like today.

Races with ageless traits were rare and evolving into one was risky. He might end up living a few thousand years if he managed to play his cards right. That is considering he failed to achieve his ultimate goal.

‘AO, The God who created this whole world and is moving the timeline to his whims, one day I will take over your seat and hold the keys of fate.’ Cain thought back at how he was simply denied existence by him in his past life.

‘I know you’re watching, no, you’re moving the whole world.’ Cain thought as he looked around, AO being the over-god of the world wasn’t arrogant but quite expressive. He will usually reply if it isn’t something that would break the world order.

One of the candles that were seated at the table fell and got extinguished, Cain took it as an omen. If he was fated to die by this curse AO would have already lost interest in him.

Sofia and Gracie entered the room after knocking, they were followed by a bunch of maids who Carried trays full of food. They laid a small table on the bed for Cain and side tables for Alice, Sofia, Selena, and Gracie.

The maids quickly left and Gracie locked the door, Alice finally relaxed and turned back into her devil form and they started eating. The food was diverse this day as well, the maids seem to have focused on maximizing nutrition by adding a lot of fruits and meat. The main dish was the liver soup which Cain found to be extremely rich.

As they finished and cleaned everything, it was bedtime. The girls quickly took their clothes off and stayed in their underwear, they also did the same to Cain.

As they lay together in bed, they watched the rare show of Gracie dancing. Her movements were stiff and rigid.

After finishing her embarrassing display, Gracie tried to leave but was called by Alice. “Why don’t you sleep with us?” Alice was thinking that having her close will be helpful in case something happened to Cain. Sofia on the other hand didn’t understand what she was meaning and Selena didn’t care.

In the end, Gracie ended up in bed with them and Alice regretted every word she said. There was no way for her to get close to Cain under those circumstances. She wished she told Gracie to at least sleep outside the bed.

Cain spent that night hugging the four of them as he slowly lost the strength to do so. The next day, he woke up to a weird surprise.
