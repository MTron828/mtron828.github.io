After taking the bath and having a light dinner at Lexi’s house, Cain retreated with the girls to his tower. Just as always, it was hard to sleep for him. Being surrounded by six women, of which three of them were naked, kept him on the edge.

“Are you really alright? You aren’t getting exhausted are you?” Cain asked Alice as she was still in her human form due to Lexi’s presence.

“I’m alright,” Alice flexed her arm, “I can keep going for more now that I leveled up!” She smiled. Cain knew that her increased Wisdom will allow her to last longer.

Wisdom is the casting ability of clerics and druids and others who rely on religious and spiritual beliefs. Charisma is the casting ability for bards and sorceresses as they use their will to influence the world. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability of mages and artificers who use their intellect to calculate and create magic.

With the increase in her spellcasting ability, she should be able to use her shapeshift for longer.

Cain turned around to see Lexi staring at them, It was the first time her being in their bedroom. She seemed nervous as she remembered what he said before, there was something in his bedroom that if they saw, he will either kill or enslave them for seeing it. Sweat dripped on her back as she tried to keep her eyes on him as long as she can, ‘I seen him naked so he was a safe thing to look at!’ she was thinking.

Cain then looked at Zaleria, she was just sitting on the couch concentrating, she was still trying to find that demon. He walked toward her, but she didn’t notice him.

‘She is concentrating too much on the outside she isn’t feeling anything around her?’ Cain looked behind him to the girls and then turned back to Zaleria. He knew how deep in thought she was to be in this stat.

He waved his hand in front of her eyes but she didn’t see it, she must be using her blind sense to see into the ethereal world. He did give her a seal to enter such a world but seeing into it was something that all dragons can do. You can say that it’s the world where you need to see people’s aura and Magic traces. As all mages do, Cain can only feel it now.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As long as he keeps the Mana density in his arms low, Zaleria wouldn’t see it when she is looking into the ethereal world. And it will look as if she is blind to the other girls. Cain kept waving his hand in front of her but she did react.

The girls were looking at him in awe, Sofia was worried about Zaleria if she was sick. Cain smiled at them, this wasn’t the end of what he could do. It can be an important part of fighting that demon. If Cain remembered correctly, he could unleash three slashes with a single swing. His visible sword is one, which means the other two blades are existing in the ethereal world. Seeing into it will be a crucial part of fighting that thing.

There was another thing worrying can, it was the demon’s four eyes. Two of them are his normal human eyes, the other two can be either created by [Alter self] to get better eyes sight, or gained from becoming a demon which gives him the ability to see into the ethereal world.

Cain immediately tried to coat his skin with Magic similar to that of Zaleria so she can’t feel his touch while concentrating on the ethereal world.

It worked like heat, the ethereal world looked like how you could see heat with a thermal camera. So if there was someone radiating a lot of heat in the distance you can see them even if it was pitch black, or they had a wall covering them. What Cain did now is change his magic (Body temperature) to that of Zaleria so she won’t feel his touch.

Cain then backed a bit to call her, he wouldn’t want to surprise her as she might react violently and punch him. “Zaleria…” Hearing her name she turned toward him, and her eyes pulsed for a moment before she spoke. “What is it?”

“You know it’s bad to only concentrate on the ethereal world right?” He said, even though she was a dragon and an ageless witch, this was a bad habit of her. She hyper-focus on something and forgets the others.

“Why not? Things have magic, I can see everything in that world.” She did question him about knowing the ethereal world as he had already given her a seal with similar powers.

“You think so? Look at me in it then,” Cain said with confidence, she was in for a shock.

Zaleria’s eyes turned to that of a dragon and she looked at him, to her surprise, he wasn’t there. When she shifted back to her normal senses, she found his hand on her neck. She wasn’t able to feel his touch either. “See, there are some people who could do this. If you won’t be careful, that demon might behead you before you know it.” Cain said menacingly. It wasn’t that far-fetched for Daimon to be able to behead Zaleria’s human form if he catch her off guard like now. Cain apprised him and not his weapon, as he will need to touch it first.

“How did you do that?” Zaleria gasped as she was faced with a skill she never thought possible, how could this kid exert such fine control over his magic?

“Now, stop concentrating on the ethereal world. You can face that demon without that if you stayed careful. Only look at it when he is slashing at you.” Cain said as walked back to his bed and grabbed Sofia.

“Look at her and you will know.” He said.

Zaleria again did as he said and looked at Sofia in the ethereal world. “I will spend a night with Mary when we return!” Cain said in Sofia’s ear. At that moment Zaleria noticed her Aura in the ethereal world swell. “I’m joking, this is a part of the demonstration.” When he said that, her aura slowly shrieked back to normal.

“Like this, it’s a bit hard to control but anyone can do it with enough practice,” Cain said, showing Zaleria his aura swelling and shrinking like crazy.

“I didn’t know people could do such a thing, where did you learn that?” She asked in awe. She was a dragon so she didn’t need to hide her aura, she was strong enough to not worry about being detected. The best she could do was look like a human but her aura in the ethereal was always that of a dragon.

“With, you don’t have to worry about that demon that much. Just relax, for now, your mere existence will prevent him from attacking.” Cain said as he pushed Sofia onto the bed, she actively resisted his as being taken in front of Zaleria was embarrassing, to say the least.

“She doesn’t seem to be in the mood, Lexi, it’s your time as a maid to fill in for her right?” Cain immediately dragged Lexi to Sofia’s side, her heart was pounding and her lips trembled.

As Sofia noticed her he was going after the maid instead of her she got jealous and pushed Lexi away. Using both her hands to turn his face toward her, “Look at me!” Sofia said with a blushed face and tearing eyes.

“See, the maid did her job in setting your mood.” As he kissed Sofia, it was her night.

After having fun with Sofia, the night was still long so he had some with Alice and Selena. Each time he tried to go for Lexi Sofia would interrupt them and take the lead. Effectively making the maid survive the night without Cain laying a hand on her.

Gracie asked them if they needed her to spit and Cain objected saying that overusing it might be bad for their health.

After a long fun time, Cain fell asleep with the girls in his arms. Gracie and Lexi included.
