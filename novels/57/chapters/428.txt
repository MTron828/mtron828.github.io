Cain stood up stretching, the two maids have drained him more than he expected. When one of them got tired, the other immediately covered for her. Unlike the girls, those two didn’t care or mind what the other was doing.

From one sheath to the other. Cain managed to pull through thanks to the sheer difference in endurance between them.

“So, your turn?” Cain turned toward Mary who was still waiting.

“Take your time, you seemed to enjoy it a lot,” Mary said, she was unconsciously delaying the fact. The reason Cain spent too much time with the twin maids is that she kept giving him the green light.

“We should probably start,” Klara said, she has gotten bored from waiting. Her insides were tickling for a while now.

“She is right, I can keep going all night, but we need to sleep.” Said Cain. He has enough stamina, what they didn’t have was time.

Mary stood, she can’t hesitate now. ‘Monster he might be, but he is still Cain’ she thought taking a step forward.

“Finally some movements, been sitting for so long.” Klara walked behind her.

“You aren’t acting like a maid, is that all right with Master?” One of the twins looked at Klara.

“It’s fine, he likes us to act normal around him. Especially in bed, acting stiff will just make it seem we’re forced to do it.” Klara responded.

“It’s better if everyone is relaxed and having fun, don’t want it otherwise.” Cain sat on the bed.

“Then let’s start,” Mary took her clothes off and stood in front of Cain. Klara did the same and stretched like a cat.

“Need to get the lady first to have my go. It’s your first time right?” Klara touched Mary’s back feeling that her shoulders were stiff. “Don’t worry, it will just sting a bit. You did fight monsters so must have been bitten at least once. This is far easier so relax.”

“I’m not nervous, I just need to take it at my own pace.” Mary smiled. Her worries were in something else, she didn’t know how powerful Cain’s senses are. Having him inside her is risky, if he was to catch something, she could get blown right up.

“Come on, sit on my lap.” Cain dragged Mary toward and sat her on his lap, “We will start when you feel like it. You can even be the one to get in, for now just close your eyes and let me take the lead.” Cain whispered licking her lips.

Mary closed her eyes, she knew it was useless to think about the ‘what if situations’ her body slowly relaxed, and her arms wrapped around Cain’s back.

Cain went in with a deep kiss as his hands went to her lower side, he started gently tickling her.

Klara who knew it was going to take Mary some time, she went in and started sucking on Cain’s meat that was right under Mary’s lower half.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Say, Cain, what do you think of me?” Mary asked.

“Like what? There are a lot of things that I think you are.” Cain replied.

“Is annoying one of them? I did hinder you a lot in your earlier quests, even starting some problems with the other. Didn’t I lose your trust?” She asked.

~You heard this isn’t my first life here, right~ Cain asked.

Mary nodded, Alice has filled her before saying that each wife must know that. She knew this wasn’t something to tell everyone she kept quiet and left Cain to do the talking.

“Let me tell you a story, a one from a forgotten time,” Cain said.

With a smile, Mary lifted her hips up, pushed Klara’s head away, and slowly descended on top of Cain’s flesh. “That a story I would love to hear, slow and steady.”

…

At a certain time, a city got invaded by a massive group of flesh-eating barbarians who slaughtered anyone they saw. The attack came from nowhere, the birds were chirping in the morning and women cried at noon.

Blood rained as the walls fell, it was like doom’s day, and everyone ran for their lives. As the city lord fell on the front lines and the guild master’s head dangled on a spike. A woman yelled at the frontlines, “You idiots, protect the left route even if you died!”

The adventurers didn’t listen to her, one of them even called her out, “What give you the right to order us around?”

The woman smiled, calling the man by his name, naming both his pregnant wife and son who were running on the left escape route. “You are dying here to protect them!” She said.

The man silently turned around pulling his blade, “I will survive. Just watch. Where are they coming from?” The man yelled.

The woman looked at all the adventures, “I don’t need to say another word. They are coming from the north. Need someone to run as bait and the other will attack.” She said.

The adventurers looked at each other, and quickly one of them cursed as loud as he can, taking off all his armor. Throwing even his beloved scimitars.

“You bastards are going to pay for this, and you better wait in a nice room!” He glared at the woman.

Slowly turning around, he started running toward the hordes of the barbarians screaming. “Follow me, you rotten bastards.”

The hordes of barbarians slowly turned to chase after him and the other adventures started attacking them from the back.

The woman looked at them, she knew they won’t last. A few minutes at best, not enough to evacuate everyone.

“You fresh ones, follow me!” She yelled at the newbie adventurers and soldiers who were just sitting there unable to move.

“What could we possibly do?” One of the adventures who held a rusted sword asked.

“Half of you direct children and the other half carry pregnant women to the guild’s basement. Those take priority, after you get them all hide with them inside.” The woman said with a confident face.

“How about the rest? The injured, the elderly…” The adventurer asked.

“I will take care of that, no time to explain so hurry!” She yelled at them and they rushed to work.

After a few minutes, the newbie adventurers did their work splendidly. Only one woman out of eighty-five ended up miss carrying due to them carrying her and running.

“Ah, we did it.” One of them sighed.

“I wonder how the fight went, I couldn’t hear them for a while now. Do you think they won?” Another adventure smiled, their hard work must have paid off.

It was then that the woman looked at them from the basement door. “You all here? Good…” She was panting.

“Yeah, how is the…” One of the adventurers started walking toward her but she slammed the door shut and locked it. The last thing that adventure saw was one of the barbarians leaping behind the women.

The newbie adventurers rushed to open the door but they heard rubble fall on it from the outside. They were stuck there with no way out.

After three days, when rescue efforts came from another city, they managed to access the guild’s basement through a cave system that spread under the city. They just needed to do a bit of digging.

When everything calmed down they realized what happened. That woman knew that the adventures would fail to keep the barbarian at bay to save anyone so she made a plan to save as many people as possible.

At the other corner of the city, they found a spot that was dyed red with blood yet not a piece of flesh was left.

She made the newbie adventurer guild children and pregnant women to the guild’s basement while she guided the rest toward the other side of the city and used them as a second bait.

She sacrificed half of the citizens to save the rest. They only found a torn piece of her clothes that was soaked in blood. She was eaten alive alongside the people she sacrificed.

…

“Why are you telling me this story?” Mary asked.

“Some people might not agree with her, some might hate her. But no one can deny that her actions saved half of the population. It’s the same with you, it doesn’t matter if you were annoying or not, you’re Mary and that’s all that matters to me.” Cain replied.
