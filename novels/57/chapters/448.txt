“Got him! Where did you find this thing?” The blue dragon standing at the wall shouted, looking down at Mary.

“That isn’t of your concerns, there is more here. Take him down!” Mary shouted so her voice can reach the exited dragon.

“Those aren’t dragon-slaying arrows, what are they? I’m sure the elves would have paid any price for them.” The dragon grabbed another one of the arrows.

“Told you not to ask, just keep throwing them at him.” Mary turned around and run toward the planning room and locked the door.

After making sure no one was there, she cast [Message]

~Alice, is Cain with you~

~Wait? Mary, from when, can you use message~

~I can’t, just using a scroll so we don’t have time~

~Cain is with me, he is alive but beheaded. The attack pulled on his spine dealing with a lot of internal damage. It’s probably due to it happening in his slowed time spell. But he will live, a matter of minutes and he’s up~ Alice replied.

~Damn it, can’t you attach his head~

~No way, it’s been incinerated, Selena is in critical condition as well~

~Sofia and Gracie are they there~

~Gracie received massive burns but she is stable, Sofia has been thrown into the volcano, I guess you can see it from the capital~

~What, Sofia is dead~

~She’s alive, don’t know how but her link is still up and strong, feels more like she is being healed rather than dying~

~In a volcano~

~Cain gave her some new buffs a few days ago, wasn’t told the details but that might be it. Zaleria has just woken up, she should help Chad with the fight~

~Ok, Cain’s sword, is it there~

~Yeah it’s here~

~It’s has special properties, one use though. Wound Cain with it~

~It will heal him~

~No, but it will open the maze. Let everyone through~UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

~It better work~

Alice thought that they will use the maze as an escape route if they could only get back to Furberg, which will give them enough time to prepare.

Alice pulled Cain’s sword out and wounded his hand with it.

ZON! ZON! A gate opened out of nowhere, and their escape route was clear.

She stood carrying the unconscious Cain, rushing toward the newly open gate. “Where are you going?” Nemmoxon who was shielding them from the heat with her wing yelled, Alice got out to the blazing battlefield. “Just him being here turned the place into an oven.”

“The heat isn’t allowing Cain to heal fast enough, he isn’t breathing as well.” That was obvious, he had no head and was bleeding. “The maze should make his recovery a bit faster. Get those four after me if you can.” Said Alice looking at Selena, Gracie, Isbert, and the stupid lord who was somewhat still breathing.

“Won’t do the lord, let him cook slowly.” Nemmoxon had her principles, she won’t help who doesn’t deserve it.

“Fine, shame we can’t use him as an example,” Alice said running into the gate.

Thud! There, her face smacked into a bulky man’s. Both she and Cain fell to the ground.

“Who’s…” She was about to yell until she saw his face, it’s been a long time.

“Did he kick the bucket?” Kayden said looking down at them with his six eyes.

“What are you doing here?” Alice asked.

“The talisman he made me before, said he will use it to open me a gate when the pit fight starts in the capital. It has just opened, thought it was time so I walked in.” Kayden replied.

Looking at him, he looked larger than before. Wearing a purple-spotted grey kimono and carrying a Katana at his waist.

“Whoa! Rest in peace…” Daraku who rushed behind Kayden started praying beside Cain, Miko quickly pushed him away and gave him a sharp glare.

“Let’s both work on it, we can get him up faster!” Miko quickly started using her magic, she knew that Cain was barely hanging due to Alice constantly blasting him with healing magic. But such an injury needed two healers, one to keep the wounded alive, and the other to fix them.

“What is happening on the other side?” Takeshi asked taking out his nodashi. “I sense a scaly one on the other side…” Yamauba grabbed his shoulder.

“It’s a great wyrm red dragon, don’t fight it. Just drag the wounded here to the maze.” Alice replied as Nemmoxon’s hand dropped Selena into the maze.

“Fine, got to clean after him. I see he’s been taking it slow and cozy, serve him well.” Kayden said walking toward the gate.

“He’s been through a lot you know!” Alice yelled back at him.

“Not enough to get him through this, or are you the one who’s been holding him down?” Kayden looked back at her, he know Cain is strong, he know he shouldn’t have lost. In his eyes, the girls wasted Cain’s time meaninglessly when he should have been grinding monsters and training instead.

Walking outside the gate, Kayden spotted Chad, Zaleria, and a long-eared woman that he didn’t recognize fighting a single bulky man with red hair and flames coming out of his nose.

“Red hair, you’re the dragon?” Kayden asked walking slowly toward them.

Zaleria instantly turned toward him, “Kayden? Run…” Before she could finish, the dragon has already grabbed Kayden’s head. Beheading him as quick as he did Cain.

“I see, you are the dragon.” Kayden’s severed head spoke in the dragon’s hand as his body slashed at his back.

The dragon instantly let go of Kayden’s head and leaped away with a wound on his back.

“Tough, I was sure to cut you in half. Kayden walked and grabbed his head putting it back in place. The demonic aura leaving his body was overbearing.

“A demon, a powerful one at that. Who are you? With whom you work…” The dragon was asking but Chad cut him short punching him in the face. Farryn followed it with a strike with her hammer.

“Let him talk…” Kayden said looking at them rushing in.

“Stop standing there, we must take him out immediately,” Zaleria yelled in his ear.

“Fine, just been trying what Lily has been teaching me the whole time.” Lily was doing her hardest to get him off the habit of stabbing first and asking later. She was the one who wanted him to listen when someone is talking

Kayden immediately transformed into his demonic form. Six arms each holding a demonic blade, three heading looking in every direction.

He immediately leaped into the fight with them.

…Inside the maze, as Alice and Miko scrambled to heal Cain, a woman they didn’t know walked in, Mary behind her.

“Cain!” Mary rushed toward him. “Ara, he lost his head. How is he still alive…?” The woman stared down at him.

“Who are you?” Alice glared at her, it was strange of Mary to bring an outsider to the maze even though she knew Alice was in her devil form.

“She can heal him,” Mary replied.

The woman put her hand on Cain’s chest and pouted. “Even he isn’t human, fine, Isbert is marrying him after all.” A golden light started emitting from her hands.

“The first queen and the kingdom’s holy pope, if someone is expert in healing magic it has to be her,” Mary said with a serious face.

“It was risky what if she…” Alice was about to speak when Mary cut her “What if he dies?”

“She is right, I’m not about to persecute a devil who can use holy magic, let’s get him up first and we can talk later…” She smiled.
