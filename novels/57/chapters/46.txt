Cain was surprised by what he heard so he turned toward William, “Can you explain why?”

It was very simple, he wanted Cain to stay in the city. People with great talent are usually on the move, chasing their fate!

Finding a solution to his daughter’s condition in a single day, that fighting power! William remembered how the mansion was shaking just from Cain casting his spell on Alice.

Giving him the position of a knight and a house will help keep him tied and ready for use all the time! That should have been a clever play if the other person didn’t realize what was going on!

Not realizing was both bad and good! Bad meant the person was easily manipulated and deceived, greed might be their guiding motive! And a good thing since they can be used easily!

Of course, there was a more straightforward method than this, Marriage! William hated the idea of having to give his daughter up to the point he was ready to sacrifice a whole house!

“It’s a reward for your actions, Please accept it!” William said, signally for Alice to come to sit in her chair.

Alice just walked to take her seat, It was kind of weird for the lord’s daughter to stay standing in this kind of meeting.

“Giving us a full house? I’ll take it!” Cain replied It meant he won’t need to pay for an inn! Well, he had wasted a whole paid week thought!

Finally having a house! Cain was already counting what he needs to fill it. An enchanting quarter, an alchemy lab! experiment cellar! It will make planning for the Catastrophe extremely easy!

Also the servant! Are they paid by the lord? if that is the case then he got free labor for him to use!

“Father, is the house big? I hope it has a small garden at least!” Alice asked, Leon quickly picked up, unlike his father! His face turned to stone.

“Yes, it has! I made sure it was big enough to house all the servants as well!” William replied, smiling like a doting father.

“I always wanted to try gardening!”

…?…? William finally linked the dots, his heart dried more than a dessert. He could feel the cold grasp of death looming around his soul! A picture of Alice walking by Cain’s side could his thoughts.

“Kill that swine!” He screamed, standing up quicker than spring.

The nobles were speechless, what is happening? Why did the lord order for Cain to be killed suddenly like this? They all backed down as they exposed blood to stain the whole hall.

After a few moments of silence, still, not a single guard lifted his weapon or moved an inch! They were all just standing there, not a single one of them wanted to attack first.

There were several reasons they didn’t move! And they were right to stay still, it was going to become a blood bath otherwise.

Most of them have seen yesterday’s fight and want no smoke with Cain, he was far too dangerous for them to handle! Another reason was that Selena’s claws extended the moment she heard William shout, sending chills down their spines! This was also a common occurrence as the lord did it before with anyone who insulted his daughter, if they were to act each time he spoke, he would be known as murder lord!

The last thing that stopped them was the look of the person standing behind the lord, Leon’s mother Lisa, she was angry! Quickly reaching William’s head and forcing him to sit down.

“How many times did I tell you to not do that!”Lisa growled into his ears! They also didn’t want to mess with her, albeit being a maid she had more influence on William than himself.

They shouldn’t act before she says her part or they might be screwed!

They were right, and after just moments he retook back his order!

“Let’s continue the talk in private! The meeting is disbanded!” William suddenly declared, Asking them to meet in his private quarter after a short rest! In that time he headed back with Lisa to discuss something!

…

“Master Cain, do you have a moment please!” The butler approached Cain, a hand on his chest.

“What is it?” Cain wasn’t sure what the butler wanted, he could only guess!

“We will now head back to the house as it needs some cleaning, I just wanted to ask what role you want those five to fill!” The five girls who were wearing casual clothing bowed slightly, “Lord William said that you will decide what job they will take!”

Now Cain understood what he meant! The maids were responsible for cooking and cleaning, the worker responsible for repair! Those five didn’t have a distinct role to fulfill!

“Have them help the maids for the time being and don’t push them too hard! I will think of roles for them when I return!” Cain replied, dismissing them and heading to meet William again!

“Cain, are we really getting a house? This isn’t a joke, right?” Sofia couldn’t believe what she heard.

“Of course-nya! Our den-nya!” Selena was the one to reply to her in excitement!

The two girls were overjoyed at the news, jumping with each other!

They quickly got met the lord again, this time he seemed calmer. What even Lisa did it worked!

The only people in the room were Cain, Selena, Sofia, William, Lisa, Leon, and lastly Alice! Even the guards were dismissed as it was not something the Lord wanted a stranger to hear!

As all the people present already knew about Alice, she took the liberty of being in her devil form as it was her natural shape! The human for was exhausting to keep!

“I will speak first! I’m going to live with Cain!” Alice said with a serious tongue!

“But, I can’t just let you live with a man we just met!” The Lord replied with a sad face.

“I told you before, no one else will take a devil as a wife except for him!” Lisa glared at him, was that what they talked about before?

Selena was okay with it as she has already accepted Alice, Sofia on the other hand wasn’t that much comfortable! This conversation seemed to strike a nerve in her head that she didn’t know existed, yet she tried her best to keep a straight face.

‘One, two, three, breathe! One, two, three, breathe!’ Sofia repeated in her head, ‘I don’t like it, Cain having more wives!’…’ No, calm down, let it be! You will get used to it, If he wanted more then I have to support him!’

“I’m also against it, she is still too young to marry!” Leon said, knocking on the table as if he had just said an important fact!

“I’m almost in my twenties, do you want me to wait until I become a hag?” Alice was angry! Those two won’t easily let her go!

“To be exact, you will not become a hag! Devils are almost immortal so you won’t age. To look more mature you have to master your shapeshift to show the signs of aging!” Cain commented, Alice looked at him with an empty face.

The argument continued for more than an hour without concluding! The two who were getting more frustrated were Alice and Sofia!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alice, can we talk for a moment?” Sofia called.

“What is it? We can speak here right?” Alice replied as the chatting stopped!

“I will be honest, I don’t want you with us. But if can accept it, I will be with his decision!” Sofia paused for a moment, taking a deep breath!

‘She isn’t lying, frustration can be felt in her voice!’ Lisa quickly noted Sofia’s attitude and made a decision.

“Come and stay with us for a while and I will try my best to drive you off! Are you okay with that?” Sofia looked at the lords family.

‘Oh! If they accepted this then it will give me more time to convince them, nice play Sofia!’ Alice thought, smiling inside!

“Challenge accepted!” Alice said dramatically making it sound like a fight challenge, bring it on!

Cain didn’t say anything as he thought the same as Alice did, ‘Sofia would accept Alice tonight anyway!’

After quick thinking, the lord’s family accepted! William encouraged Sofia to drive Alice away while Lisa started giving Alice advice on how to make the relationship work!

After that was settled, Cain asked for some private time with Leon and his father. He needed to convince them to amass power for the catastrophe or his relationships won’t last more than three months!

Sadly, they didn’t seem to believe what he said thinking something must be wrong! At least he managed to convince them to fortify the city more, just to be safe!

‘I have to do everything alone? If they can’t believe it then I have to bring them a prof!’ Cain started thinking of what his next action will be!
