Sitting in the bath, Cain touched his chest feeling where the wound was. His heartbeat seemed normal even though his chest felt jammed. ‘I should get used to his soon.’ Stretching his legs and took a deep breath.

Alice looked at him worried, seeing his anxiously touch his chest made her heartache. “Are you alright? Do you need anything?”

“No, just a bit sore. I should be fine tomorrow morning.” Cain smiled to ease her mind. Alice could see right through his act with her 20 wisdom.

“You won’t be going on a rampage again, right?” Sofia asked what Alice was thinking about. The story that Zaleria and Chad told them wasn’t pleasing at all.

“That would be bad-nya!” Selena stared at Cain with her ears dropped.

Cain thought about it for a moment, the mad soul, or the magic berserker stat. It was the dragon’s king’s creation, he should expect the king to discover it again this time as well.

“That isn’t a power I’m supposed to use, it’s the enemy’s trump card. I should be looking for a way to destroy it.” Cain said.

Alice shifted her body back and leaned on the tub edge. “I thought you will try to control it?”

“Hell no, I might like magic and weird experiment but nothing like that! It’s too unstable, unpredictable, and rough to be considered a valid power.” Cain said as he leaned on Selena. She was softer than what her muscles made her look like.

“It’s what the dragon’s king will use against us if we pushed him to a corner, take what Zaleria and father told you as a warning. That was a dialed-down version of the monster that we might end up facing in the future.” Cain added.

“Isn’t there a way to end the fight quickly?” Gracie asked as she got closer to Cain. He noticed that the scars on her body have mostly healed, evolution must have done its thing.

“That the annoying part, every way I can think off to cheese the fight end up in smoke if he rampaged. I can neither put him to sleep, teleport him away, seal him and not even use words to sway him away!” Cain ground his teeth. If the dragon king finished his experiment. Their only chance to defeat him is pommeling him down as Sylph did to Cain. That isn’t something they could ever hope to accomplish under normal circumstances.

“So we only need to get as strong as him? Isn’t that just a matter of grinding out experience?” Sofia asked. She was really thinking of facing him head-on.

Alice looked at her, “I don’t think it’s that simple.”

“Yeah, he has all draconic elements which mean he is immune to all elements. His only weakness is his mind, which will be fixed when he rampage. Even his physical prowess is on another level, he embodies what the perfect race of dragons is actually capable of.” Cain closed his eyes. “The only god capable of creating something that rivals dragons ended up creating the failure of humans and then left.” Cain sounded as if he wanted to punch that god.

“What is his name? Amaterasu should be able to talk to him right?” Alice was thinking that a few prayers might compel the goddess to ask that god for help. The stories of god helping mortals were common and she thought she could do the same.

“That won’t work, his name is AO. Some call him the Over-God of the world. All he did is presumably create the world and the humans and then left. From what I know, he is the only god the dragons excluded from their hit list for being the true god in their eyes.”

“A true god?” Sofia looked at Cain with a questioning stare.

“They see him like that since he is the strongest, they only respect strength.” ‘This explanation should be enough, going into more details would only confuse them.’ Cain thought.

“Can we forget the hard stuff-nya?” Selena pushed her head into Cain’s side. “It’s been three days since we’re together like this-nya.”

Selena was right. Just as much as it’s Cain’s responsibility to deal with dragons, it’s also his responsibility to deal with his wives. Even more, tomorrow was the beginning of their wedding so this was definitely not the time to be thinking about such things.

Cain grabbed Selena and tried to drag her into his lap, she was too heavy for him so he used [Fly] on her.

Sofia closed her eyes concentrating for a moment, her draconic features slowly faded as her body returned to normal.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The bath was hot having four girls clinging to him made it worse. Selena sitting on his lap, Sofia grabbing his right side while Alice grabbing his left. Gracie sat outside the water keeping Cain’s head between her thighs as she tended to his burned hair.

“It’s getting stuffy, would you mind giving me some space?” Cain looked at them with a smile.

Sofia pouted as she clanged to him harder. “That isn’t a problem.” She caressed his chest with her hand, a chill ran through his body. Her hands were as cold as ice, after a moment it wasn’t just her hands, her whole body felt cold and refreshing.

“You can absorb the heat like Zaleria…” Cain said as if he just remembered.

Cain wanted to go at it right here right now but did his best to hold it in. They still have dinner, going at the four of them would just take too long.

“Can you wait just until we get to bed? I can feel you.” Cain told Alice who was already rubbing herself on his side. The only one who seemed calm was Gracie.

“No!” Alice, Sofia, and Selena said at the same time. In an instant, Selena pushed him inside her and turned to face him.

“Gracie save me!” Cain cried.

Thud! Gracie kicked Selena in the face and started trying to push her away.

“You can’t-nya!” Selena said with a grin. Sofia could feel it, she tried to kick Selena in the face and that was futile, she is too strong.

Gracie glared at her and suddenly smiled. Just that made Sofia realize that something was off, Gracie couldn’t show such emotions before.

Puff! Selena’s body got consumed by the shadows.

“What!” Alice and Sofia cried as they felt Gracie grab their heads. Puff! They were consumed as well.

Selena got dropped at the bath corner on her face while Alice got dropped in the cold tub to the side. Sofia got thrown into the locked shower room.

Puff! Gracie teleported with Cain to the corner opposite to Selena and stared at them. “This is mine!” Her eyes had a faint purple glow to them.

“KYA!” Alice leaped from the cold water and stared at her, “What do you mean yours? He is ours!”

Gracie looked down at Cain and then at Alice, “I’m hungry a bit, I need him to feed me.”

‘She is a half succubus, after all, she needs to eat as the rest of them.’ Cain thought as he tried to stand.

“No.” Gracie carried him instead and tightly gripped his meat. “Dinner, you’re not running away.”

“I know I told you to say what’s on your mind but this is just too much!” Cain cried. Just if she was feeling that he was her food (As all succubus do, and he is more delicious as he has more Mana) She didn’t need to say that out loud.
