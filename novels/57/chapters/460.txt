“If that thing blows up, even you wouldn’t survive!” He cried staring at the condensed Mana in her hand. That thing was like a bomb that can explode at any time.

Lilia licked the ball, “It tastes sweet you know? But I’m generous now, so I will give this mana back after marking it.” The blue ball floated from her hand, sparkles of pure mana crackling from her black nails. The entire village sprouted back to life in the blink of an eye.

“Magic is unfair, as long as you understand how the world work, you can use mana to command it.” Lilia clapped her hands together as she did her feet. Pure condensed mana started crackling from her limbs like flashes of lightning.

At that moment, the devil could feel the ground trembling. Waves of Mana started pulsing around him.

“All the particles around here, their mass is accelerating toward the center of the world under the effects of gravity. It also related to the distance from the core but that doesn’t matter now!” She started explaining while the devil was blasting her with all he got.

Fear started seeping into his bones, whatever she was going to do with all that mana. It will not tickle. Even his strongest and most concentrated attacks failed to leave a dent in her shield.

[Bone Curse: Crumble] He covered her with his curse, attempting to turn her bones into jello. A curse shouldn’t be blocked by a raw Mana no matter how much it was condensed.

But, the moment his curse touched her shield, it melted. The sheer current in her shield was enough to render the curse back into raw mana and absorb it. Lilia didn’t have magic nor elemental resistance, not even magic immunity, she had magic absorption. The higher version of one of the most desired resistances in the world, the ability to render magic ineffective.

“Setting a radius of 1 km, I simply need to erase that acceleration by muffling the gravity force and you have…” With a pulse from her big smile, the whole village and the hills around it levitated to the sky and got flipped like a pan.

As the sun got overshadowed and a devil fell into the crater terrified, looking up at the little monster with a massive chunk of the ground orbiting around her.

This isn’t a spell, nor something that should happen. He heard that there was a monstrous mage in the elvish kingdom. A being that everyone avoids crossing paths with.

“Lilia’s Move Mountain, my personal version of Proctive’s move mountain forgotten magic.” She said holding her laughter. Mana around her small figure was boiling, the current seemed unstable, chaotic as if it was being calculated on the fly.

“That can’t be, [Proctive’s Move Mountain] is a tenth-level spell. Those spells were banned in the old ages by Mystra, the goddess of magic!” The devil growled, he has never seen that spell before, all he knew was what the ancient devils in hell talked about. About the ancient Devil and Angel war of the old ages.

Such spells were so powerful that the gods deemed them too dangerous to allow mortals to use. And with that, Mystra the goddess of magic set limiters. Constructed a strict system where all non-divine beings can be monitored and kept in check.

“Like I care about what that bitch wants. I said it, this is magic, not a spell. Like I would let that woman learn my spells, I play with mana as I want and she can come down if she wants.” Mystra uses the system’s magic section to collect information about all the magic in the world, increasing her knowledge and power.

Lilia never added a spell to her system since she learned that, and slowly she even managed to erase spells from her list completely. Slowly she learned how to jam the signal causing the system to start failing. Mystra the goddess of magic can’t see her spells, stats, skills, race, and age.

[Enchanting magic] that Cain developed and created to modify and control the system. The power that allows him to only add the spells he needs to the system. The power allowed him to fake his mana capacity at the start so he won’t get in trouble with the guild for having too much. It was all inspired by his Master’s power.

Unlike Cain who wants to use the system in his best interest and shunt it whenever he needs it. His master Lilia said, “The system allows Mystra to steal my work, she can go fuck herself with the other gods!” And essentially deleted her system.

At that moment, the devil realized what was floating in front of him. She wasn’t a mage, nor a witch, she wasn’t even a wizard. The elvish Archmagi was the true monster walking the world.

Lilia started smacking him over and over with the village. Each time she made a rippling quake in the ground, her smile only grew bigger. She was like a kid enjoying tormenting a small bug.

Even though the devil was so powerful the elves needed to rely on her help, to her he was nothing more than a source of entertainment.

After she made sure he was dead. She lifted her hands. “Better fix this before Sylph starts giving me an earful, she is useful after all,” Lilia remembered how she could take naps in the castle and take money from Sylph as she want.

“She is helping me a lot after all!” With a single snap of her fingers, the entire Mana she was using to control her magic gathered back in her hand.

“I need her to only focus on the dragons, for the time being!” Lilia smiled as she always does.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As the mana dissipated, the entire village started getting fixed. Plants grew again, and buildings raised as they were before. Even the cattle that got squashed came back to life.

As if nothing had happened, the laughing tornado sat on the fence waving her legs and humming. Nothing beats the refreshing feeling of mana rampaging freely. It was like screaming after a stressful day, relaxing and a way to blow some steam off.

“An equivalent exchange, not a single thing or soul is lost. I only pay for the damage fee with my own Mana.” She started looking around while giggling, “That is usually covered by whomever I fight, in the end, I lose nothing. Magic is such a perfectly balanced thing. No wonder Mystra nerfed it.”

And then, without her even needing to move, it came out from the ground exactly how she needed it.

The devil she just killed was alive and well inside a small glass jar floating in front of her. An evil smile crossed her face, “Welcome to my lab, we have a lot of games to play. Don’t die quickly, or do. I can drag you out of hell into the lab again anyway.”

The elvish Archmagi flew back to the elvish castle taking her time, she needed to think of an excuse. Sylph must have sensed the earth quaking from there and she might be furious.

“What is your goal? Tenth-tier spells were banned because they break the world’s order, do you really think Mystra won’t intervene? The gods aren’t going to sit silently while you run wild.” the devil asked her but he wasn’t waiting for an answer. A monster like her wouldn’t care about his words.

“As long as Mana exists, Magic exists. Even gods won’t stand in my way!” She smiled.

…

Back at home.

“Hey Cain, you’re really skilled with magic. Enchanting and spells, even surviving decapitation. What will you do when you reach the top of the world? Create a magical empire?” Zaleria asked. As all dragons are obsessed with power and might.

“No, in fact. I will erase all magic, and turn the world back to how it should be. If not for Mana, those monsters, those wounds everyone suffers every day. The weak suffer because of it, and I will never forget those days.” Cain remembered the days when he was weak, Zombies and undead burned Furberg in front of his eyes.

If magic didn’t exist, he wouldn’t have suffered in his past life. Magic only made the strong stronger and made the weak suffer more. Even to this day, Cain and his group were fighting the dragons for their goals. The poor citizen of the capital died as collateral damage, hundreds of homes blasted, families broken, and young children with a bright future awaiting them. They all died with a random breath hitting the capital.

“With Mana…” Lilia said, “I will be happy!” She laughed.

“Without Mana…” Cain said. “Everyone will be happy!” He frowned.
