Gracie stared down at Lilia's face. It was red, her eyes darting around as she moaned. Cain's massive hunk of flesh almost turned her inside upside down. "I want to do it as well," Gracie mumbled.

Her succubus blood started boiling, and the desire for pleasure in her only grew stronger.

"After her. I can't stop in the middle." Cain replied,

Gracie stared at Cain, her flower itching harder and harder. The stronger she became, the denser her succubus blood became. Her sense has become muddled, wishing she was in the place of Lilia.

"Cain, can I enjoy myself?" she asked. Her face was red, and her breathing was unsteady.

"Do what you want," Cain replied.

Gracie slowly bent down and grabbed Lilia's face in her hands. Tuf! She spat again in her mouth, "More for you," Gracie said and stood back up, only relying on her succubus instincts.

She gently lifted her skirt and pushed her panties to the side. She stared down at Lilia and slowly sat down on her face.

Lilia wasn't waiting, and neither was bothered. Gracie's aphrodisiac already took effect and was pushing her to the edge. She immediately started licking and sucking.

Gracie's hips trembled, and her stomach pulsed. A wave of heat flowed through her body as she stared at Cain. "AH!" She moaned. Her wings and tails emerged immediately and tore her maid outfit.

Cain used a weak mid-control which both girls accepted with no signs of rejection. He made sure the three of them got a simultaneous climax. After a few seconds, all three of them jolted at the same time.

Bahamut and Mauzzkyl walked into the guest room with Sofia leading them. "Say, girl, what do you know of my sister?" Bahamut asked as he scratched his chin.

"Nothing beyond that she is the chromatic dragon goddess, and some bits." She showed them their seats, and the ghosts brought them drinks.

Mauzzkyl stared at her, "How could you not know while being a god?"

Sofia stared at him and smiled, "Tiamat died before she could properly transfer her knowledge. Of course, I don't know much." And she then glared at him, "Wouldn't it be better to show more respect to your goddess, sir shadow?"

Mauzzkyl looked at her with a smile, "We chromatic never been so religious, don't expect to be differently treated just because you're a goddess."

"You all say the same thing until you reach the twilight. The eventual doom always breaks dragons." Sofia stated, and Bahamut smiled, "So you at least know her work."

"What work?"

"The last stage of a dragon's life, the twilight." He looked down, "You could call it a downward spiral. The great wyrms who held unimaginable power started getting weaker and weaker like how humans get old."

Bahamut lifted his hand, "I'm on such a stage. My body is nearing its limit."

The dragons had multiple age stages. But leveling or getting more power can push the dragon to those stages.

Wyrmling stage: Right after hatching from the egg and the early life. 0~1000 years.

Young stage: The dragon's early life. Similar to a teenager. 1000~2000 years.

Adult: When the dragon can mate and bear children. 2000~3000 years.

Ancient: When the dragons get old, and their powers grow. 3000~4000 years.

Wyrm: When the dragons discover their innate powers and reach a level mortals can't achieve. 4000~5000 years.

Great wyrm: The pinnacle of dragon kind, the strongest age for a dragon. 5000~6000 years.

Twilight: The rapid decline as the dragon dies: 6000~????

Most dragons grow in strength naturally. Their expected lifespan is 10000 years on average.

But there have been dragons who reached twilight in 2000 years, and there are dragons who lived for over 100000 years in their Great wyrm stage. It all depends on genetics and the dragon's power.

The golden rule is that dragons who level up and train live longer than the rest.

Dragons like Mauzzkyl, Zaleria, and Mary can live for tens of thousands of years.

Bahamut had lived for over ten million years, and his twilight might last for another million years before he perish naturally.

Bahamut stared at Sofia, "Make the mistake of growing too strong. And you will outlive everyone here."

As Kayden walked back onto the ship, he suddenly stopped. [Kayden-chan. The demon lord has started moving. We should get back to]

Immediately rushing inside, Kayden punched the mansion's door open and yelled, "Cain, send me back immediately." Isbert stared at him for a moment. "What?"

"Where is Cain? Call him immediately!" Kayden yelled at her. His face filled with veins as his demonic energy seemed across the mansion. "White hair! Show up!" Kayden swung his blade, tearing a massive cut in the rooms and scaring everyone inside.

"Hey Kayden, what are you doing?" Alice rushed out, "What if you killed someone?"

Bahamut and Mauzzkyl, who were about to start talking with Sofia, rushed out to see what was happening.

"I don't care. More people are dying elsewhere," Kayden shouted.

"Calm down, kid. Even though we didn't get to meet Cain right away." Bahamut approached Kayden. "If you don't calm down, I will tie you up."

Thud! Kayden swung a back fist at Bahamut, "Na√É¬Øve!" Bahamut smiled, lifting his palm to block the strike.

BAM! As the strike connected, a sudden wave of pressure passed through Bahamut. Sheer force infused with demonic magic and topped with the divine energy of destruction.

'Ashura, no, Kali?' He could sense the goddess behind him.

He tried standing his ground, but his bones gave up and cracked. The dying metallic dragon god; got smacked across the room.

'Is this the power that drove Talos away?' Bahamut coughed blood. If he wasn't dying, he might have stood a chance.

"Get out of my way, geezer!" Kayden growled.

Silently and from the shadows behind Kayden, Mauzzkyl appeared swinging a knife. He got surprised to see an eye glaring at him from the back of Kayden's head. And then an arm holding a demonic sword emerged toward him.

CLANG! Mauzzkyl dodged and cleaved Kayden's head in one go. But as expected, Kayden regenerated almost immediately.

Kayden transformed. His three heads screamed in unison, "CAIN! SEND ME BACK NOW!"

ZON! Cain appeared from thin air, "Kayden, Calm down."

Kayden glared at him, "Send me back immediately. The demon lord is rampaging after absorbing all of his subordinates."

"Why now? Probably since you left the kingdom." Cain thought about it and flicked his finger.

The moment the portal opened up, Kayden disappeared. BAM! A shock wave exploded in the room. He leaped so fast that the ground shattered.

~Kayden, wait for me! I can help~

~I don't need your help. It's personal between me, and the bastard~

Even with what Kayden said, Cain immediately followed him, and so did all the girls.

Chad, who arrived after hearing the noise from outside, leaped into the portal last.

The moment Cain jumped out of the Gate, he saw endless forests. Kayden's aura was already a long distance away. "He's fast." [Fly] Cain flew and rushed after Kayden.

It was only after a few seconds that he realized it. Kayden was getting further away. He was faster than Cain with flying magic.

"Damn it, how could be so fast with just running?" [Enchanting] [Enchanting] he blasted after Kayden as fast as he could.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Through the thick forest, Kayden ran like a raging monster leaving a trail of destruction behind him. After a few moments, Cain could see him, a massive mass of flesh in the distance.

"Is that the demon king?" He gasped, "I expected him to look more like a human."
