Meliliana could not see anything around her. ‘Shit, most of my spells are useless.’ She loathed the face she only knew mental and illusion spells.

‘My only option is to use that ring.’ She had taken multiple magic items from the earth dragon hoard.

High detection ring. A magical item allowed her to feel everything in a 10-foot radius around her.

The moment she activated it, she could feel Gracie leaping at her with two daggers in hand. Thud! She dodged to the side at the last moment.

‘I can do…’ Meliliana’s thoughts were cut short by a sharp pain in her side. Gracie has disappeared from her front and appeared at her side.

“You!” Meliliana yelled. She swung a dagger she was holding.

Gracie disappeared again. Appearing behind Meliliana, she swung again. It didn’t matter if Meliliana was aware of Gracie’s location. She could strike her as long as she was inside her darkness.

Crack! Gracie swung both of her daggers at Meliliana’s neck. The attack was infused with her shadows so she will never miss it.

The attack connected, where here daggers were halfway through Meliliana’s neck. Gracie felt a horrid presence enter her darkness. It had the same feeling as Meliliana. It was another Cubus. Yet it felt far stronger than Meliliana.

Gracie didn’t care and pushed further, Meliliana should not survive thing. Thud! Gracie was pushed away by a powerful kick.

Feeling her daggers lose connection to Meliliana’s neck, Gracie allowed Kayden to see in her darkness and swung her dagger at the succubus that just entered.

“That hurt! Who taught you to fight like that?” The new succubus growled in pain as her sliced toes grew back.

Thud! [Shadow acceleration] using the shadow to move. Gracie accelerated her attack speed and swung again immediately.

Cling! The succubus deflected the dagger with her bare hands. “Mother!” Meliliana cried. The next thing she saw was Kayden swinging his blade at her.

“Leave her alone!” Meliliana’s mother screamed as she punched Gracie to the side and rushed at Kayden.

CRACK! The ground shattered under her feet as she swung a punch at Kayden. The man quickly lifted his blade to block. ‘Heavy!’ Kayden thought.

“The name is Melissa. What is your name, handsome boy!” She laughed, as Kayden was the first to block her attack in years. She had started to feel a little bit of tingling inside her.

[Sextuple Slash] Kayden swung his blades at her. One going for her neck. The other one was for her waist. Each of them was followed by another two spectral slashes hence the sextuple slash.

Melissa used her left forearm to block the slash at her waist and her right forearm to deflect the blow to her neck. CLANG! Kayden’s spectral blades connected to her body and a loud bang echoed.

Her body was as tuff as steel which meant she was either using mage armor or did have strength beyond 20. Either way, Kayden was going to have trouble wounding her normally.

Meliliana tried to crawl away but she soon felt multiple nails pin her body to the ground. Gracie pinned her down so she won’t run away. She wanted to kill her with her hands.

“Use those!” Gracie shouted as she gave Kayden two swords that she was hiding in her pocket shadow. They belonged to Cain, two blades that he enchanted so they can be his spare weapons.

The moment Kayden held the blades, he could feel the magic in them and he smiled. “Do they belong to him? As crazy as ever!”

Both blades had the enchantment [Ringing blade] and the [Extended edge] enchantment.

[Ringing blade] Makes the blade vibrate so it can cut better while [Extended edge] creates a magical edge to extend the weapon’s reach. What’s more, Kayden could still buff them with his [Demon blade]

Kayden let swung the two blades at Melissa. This time aiming at her neck and shoulder without [Demon Blade]. Clang! The blades managed to cut through her flesh but stooped at the bones.

BAM! She spun in her place and delivered a round kick at Kayden’s chest. The hit connected directly and pushed him backward. Kayden remained standing and holding his stance.

“I’m keeping those!” He laughed. Kayden had liked the blades.

Swoosh! Melissa dodged to the side. Gracie’s attack missed and only cut her ear. “They belong to Master. I’m giving them to you since it’s an emergency!” Gracie Shouted at Kayden.

“An assassin maid? You remind me of one of my daughters.” Melissa said as she turned around and smacked Gracie’s shoulder with a roundhouse kick.

“Do you like cutting toes?” Melissa growled as her toes grew back.

Gracie didn’t reply, she knew better than to reply to her. Cain had told her that toes are a more important part of the body than most people think.

When you run, walk or swing a blade or a punch. There is always that moment when you stand only on your toes. If they were cut, she can disturb most of the movement a humanoid can do even if they do not feel pain.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Melissa seemed to have strong regeneration and could grow them quickly. Cain expected such a situation and had also told her.

Most creatures that have regeneration can’t regenerate as fast as they move. This means that cutting her toes would prevent her from making a combo attack, or counter-attacking immediately. Can advice was, ‘If they are in your reach. And there is no risk in cutting them. Then just do it.’

There was another thing worrying Gracie more than Meliliana’s incredible regeneration. They were still in her [Maddening Darkness] spell. Kayden could only see because she was allowing him to see.

Melissa should be blind and deaf. Yet she could see and hear them, she is even talking and responding as if nothing was up.

Thud! Melissa leaped at Gracie and swung a left hook at her. Gracie ducked down and spun in place. She tried to stab her with her sole blade but Melissa jumped.

Cling! Kayden stepped in and swung his two blades at Melissa’s neck. This time he was using his [Demon blade]

Melissa twisted her body and grabbed Kayden’s head in between her thighs. By twisting her hips, she threw him away.

When she landed, blood was pouring from between her legs. She quickly regenerated. “Can you be a bit gentler with a woman’s private parts?” She growled at him.

Kayden spat what was in his mouth. “Taste like the intestine of a fish that is on the verge of spoiling. Wouldn’t even qualify as dog food.” Thud! He leaped at her swinging his blades.

Gracie also joined him and swung her daggers. Melissa blocked Gracie’s attack with her feet and deflected Kayden’s blade with her hands.

Kayden quickly dodged a kick that was aimed at his crouch and Sliced Melissa’s leg. Which almost instantly grew back. At the same time, Gracie stabbed her in the back but the dagger didn’t go that deep.

“You keep struggling but you can’t hope to defeat me with weak your attacks are!” Melissa laughed at them and leaped away.

“Let me show you what real wounds are.” She took a stance with a leg back and one at the front. An open palm and a closed fist.

Both Gracie and Kayden could feel the magic that was being condensed in her body. This stance was bad news.

“Heh?” Gracie looked behind her as she felt something immense fly toward them. It was a familiar feeling, a warm yet cold.

Like a flash of lighting. Cain flew in and hit Melissa with a flying kick to the face. [Enchanting: Weight] Cain dragged her head to the ground under his foot.

[Teleport] He then teleported her body right above him.

Melissa was confused. Who was this? Where did he come from? Why did his presence feel so horrid? He wasn’t a human, she could swear he felt more like a monster than monsters themselves.

[Destructive wave: Air blast] Cain spun around and kicked her to the sky. Melissa could feel her bone crack from how heavy his attack was.

The next thing she saw, she was in the sky. Cain appeared a few feet away from her. She could fly toward him with her wings but something was off. No matter how much she flapped them, she was stuck in her place.

Cain had used [Telekinesis] to keep her in place.

[Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball] [Teleport] [Fireball]

Cain started to teleport around her in circles and leave fireballs around.

Realizing what he was about to do, she clenched her fists together and started gathering her magic.

In the next moment, Cain released all the fireballs at her at the same time. When they hit her they exploded in a crimson flower of flames.

Cain was not done yet. [Control wind] He started feeding air to the flames and spinning them around her. His goal was to increase the heat as much as he can. If he wanted to kill her, he need to burn her faster so that she could regenerate.

“Is that Cain? He feels different.” Kayden said as he could feel that something was off about Cain.
