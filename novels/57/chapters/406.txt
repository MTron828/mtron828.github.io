“If it were a regular night you wouldn’t have called me here, what did you need?” Alice asked leaning on Cain’s chest.

“It’s about the operation’s aftermath, I do need you to care for my body for a couple of days,” Cain replied.

“That isn’t just it, what is the catch?” Alice was wiser to think it was simple. She knew there was something special about needing her.

“You’re right, the operation is just the starting point. The real work is after it and I want you to be the one doing it.” Cain said with a worried face.

“Care to explain in detail?” Alice wasn’t confident in her ability to care for him alone.

Cain started explaining with each word Alice’s worries just increased.

In the first part, after the recovery starts, my body needs to stay submerged in Magical water when you’re not working on it. I also need you to feed, administer medication, clean, and operate on it.

Cain’s body will stay unconscious like that for almost a week, the biological function won’t stop or slow down so someone has to feed and clean him.

The ‘work’ Alice needs to do to Cain’s body is the important part. It was the part when Alice started to worry even more.

First, she needs to use a knife to open his body, reach all the sealed dead flesh inside (That was left from the last time she cursed him), and link them together with a new curse.

Secondly, after sewing his body, she needs to infuse the magic water covering him with her cursed magic so his body can absorb it. In that stage, Cain would look dead with no heartbeat or breathing for almost a day.

Thirdly, his skin will start turning green and his limbs will split into tentacles from the fingers. At this stage, Alice would need to cast a spell on him. The spell is long and must not get interrupted. She can spend hours chanting on his body without stopping.

After that, in the fourth stage, she will need to start soaking his body in holy water, preferably created by her magic. Doing that will cause his body to revert to the human shape after the transformation is finished.

After spending a day in the holy water, Cain would seem to wake up. This is the first awakening stage, it’s like sleepwalking. In that state Cain won’t be able to cast magic or fight, just walk like a zombie. Alice must knock him out and put him to sleep with a sleeping pill.

As the last step, Alice would have to cast another spell on Cain. This spell is relatively short and should only take about half as much as the first one. After it with few hours, Cain will finally awaken.

“Why do we need all of this work? It seems as if I’m awakening some kind of demon.” Alice exclaimed.

“Close, let’s just say that what I need you to do isn’t something that the world should know of.” Cain smiled averting his eyes from her, Ariel would snap if she saw the ritual of creating an eldritch evil being performed out of nowhere.

“So, the operation is tomorrow, how do you expect me to learn all the spells and know how to perform what procedures you want? Wouldn’t Zaleria or Bela be a better candidate?” Alice asked, she currently isn’t up for the job at that moment.

“Since I need someone to perform curse magic and only you can do it. For learning the spells, this is the hard part.” Cain looked away.

“Learning?” Alice looked at him with a confused face.

“To be honest, we don’t need to operate tomorrow. We can wait so you can naturally learn the spells but…I do want to get it done as fast as possible just in case.” Cain said.

“Let me guess, you have either an uncomfortable or painful way to make me learn the spells and procedures before tomorrow.”

“Yeah, the spell [Borrowed knowledge] is only useful to transfer knowledge. To be able to use that knowledge you need to be skilled with your hands, for that I have to use the enslavement bind to force you to move as intended.”

“I’m still waiting to hear the bad side.” Alice smiled.

“For the entire week, you can still move freely but when the caring times come, you will be forced to come to me. The bind will cause you pain if you failed to reach it in time. You will also be controlled like a puppet in the room.” Cain explained what she has to go through, it won’t be easy and that’s just because he wants to get it done as fast as possible.

“I’m fine with that, who knows when we will need your strength? I’m also with the idea of getting it done as fast as possible.” Alice didn’t seem to mind, instead, she smiled in excitement. “This is what devils must do, performing rituals and such.”

“Believe me, it isn’t fun as it sounds. And don’t let anyone learn about it or you might end up with a crusading army chasing your neck.” Cain smiled.

“Nah, are you saying I will be sentenced to death? I’m not bragging but they can’t keep me tied even in steel. Even if I could be restrained and captured, what about the rest, no country can keep Zaleria chained down.” Alice said with a big smile as she puffed her bare bosom.

“Time can always restrain you and keep even Zaleria at bay. Make sure you never get teleported, I know the crusaders and they have a lot of those nasty teleportation crystals. They will send you to the other side of the kingdom where they can execute you while everyone else is taking the two days trip.” Cain explained.

Alice looked at the worried Cain for a moment and then apologized, “I should listen. I might have wisdom but not knowledge.”

“You don’t have to worry about it. Are you okay with everything?” Cain asked again to confirm and Alice nodded stretching her arms.

“How much time did we do it?” Alice asked.

“Five? I didn’t count…” Cain replied as he recalled what they were doing that night.

“Listen Cain…can we do it again?” Alice looked at Cain.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Of course, does that need to be a question?” Cain replied with a passive face, that was a given.

“Well…I wanted to…do some things…” Alice started fiddling with her fingers unable to bring herself to talk. “No forget it, let’s do it as usual.” She changed her mind quickly.

Cain gave her a suspicious look, what in the devil this devil was thinking of doing? “I can do anything I want to you right?” Cain asked.

“Of course, it will be my pleasure,” Alice replied immediately.

“Well then, tell me what you wanted to do. Everything. This is an order.” Cain said with a stupid face, using the slave bind to force Alice to tell what she wanted earlier.

Alice’s face turned red, her lips started parting as she used all of her strength to resist the slave bind. ‘Cain might hate me if I asked him that, I can’t say it, no matter what!’ Alice thought resisting.

“Hoho, so you can resist the spell pretty well. But it seems you can’t do that for long. Let me help you out.” Cain started tickling her to make her talk.

Alice finally spoke when her will to resist broke, the words came out of her mouth in a formal fashion that didn’t match what she was saying.

“I want you to lick me off, and then lick my feet while we do it slowly.”

As the control ended, Alice started banging her head on the bed for what she just said. If there was a hole in the ground, she would bury herself.

“This is all you were worried about?” Cain looked at her with questioning eyes. “We’re husband and wife, what we do in bed is just between us two so don’t restrain yourself in what you want.”

“GRAAA!” Alice wasn’t listening, she just kept banging her head on the bed.

Cain immediately lifted her with telekinesis and shake her a bit. “Listen lady Alice, you say what you want, I say what I want. Give and take so stop whining and let’s give you what you want.” Cain gave her a deep kiss.

This was something that he didn’t expect, she did try both of those things before and he was fine with them.

“KAY!!” Alice moaned.
