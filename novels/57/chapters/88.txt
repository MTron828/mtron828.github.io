The succubus stared at the glowing mismatching eyes in front of her in shock, a sudden surge of pain jolted through her face. She quickly pulled back, trying to get as far as possible, that sensation was familiar to her, but this isn’t the first time she saw one.

“What is a devil doing…” Swoosh…Bang! Something came flying at his seem, crushing into her side with a crimson explosion. Varoom! The thing accelerated again with another burst of flame, blasting her away. BLeh! The succubus coughed blood as her wounds reopened and her burns reignited, the kick must have shattered a rib or two.

Quickly regaining her poster, she saw another thing leaping at her neck with its jaw wide open, she didn’t even have time to comprehend if it was a human or a monster, as the bloodlust coming from it was enough to make her retreat instinctively.

[Dominate Person] The succubus used one of her trump cards to stop the thing in place, this spell assured total control of someone else’s body. This spell was used to restrain extremely strong individuals to enslave them later.

“Selena!” Alice screamed as she saw Selena freeze in place, trying her best to his the still moving succubus with [Cursed Decay]. [Firelance] Sofia supported her, they tried to act quickly as she seemed to be badly injured.

As if paralyzed, Selena’s body stood firmly in place. Her mind slowly blanked out, the only thing she can see from her blood-red vision is the succubus’s neck. His muscles contracted violently as she tried to break free, Crack! She can hear the sound of her bones cracking under the immense pressure she was exerting. A bit by bit, she could feel her sanity fading, giving up to her primal instinct, she was a beast at heart and that thing was trying to devour the fiend who laid his hands on her mate.

“ROAAAAAAAR!” Her voice rumbled as the spell started to fail, [Dominate Person] was a spell that was designed to control intelligent beings by manipulating their decision-making ability, and this didn’t apply to a monster that is acting on pure instinct.

Frenzied, Selena broke free and galloped toward the succubus with a sole purpose, rip and tear.

Still shocked that her spell failed to contain Selena for more than a couple of seconds, the succubus made certain she had no way of winning, those three must have been this guy’s friends. ‘Shit! If they are at the same level as him then I won’t stand a chance.’ She flapped her still sore wings, the pain didn’t matter because staying away from Selena was a top priority.

The room was large enough for her to fly a bit high, enough that a human can’t jump and grab her. Relieved that she was safe for the time being, the succubus turned her attention toward the second most dangerous individual in her eyes, the devil standing atop her meal.

‘How come a d…’ She felt something grab the base of her tail, sharp claws ran deep to the bone. ‘She can jump that high?’ The succubus was taken by surprise, desperately trying to break free as Selena’s weight dropped them down.

BANG! A firelance exploded at her face, Sofia wasn’t going to let her have any timeout, no matter where she flew, she will snipe her down. BANG! Another firelance hit the succubus in the abdomen, leaving burn marks on both her and Selena’s hands. Luckily neither of the girls cared about seeing Cain’s situation. This monster managed to get him to that stat so they couldn’t hold back.

Dangling violently, Selena tore apart the succubus’s tail. With a single powerful bite, the tail was off.

[Cursed Decay] [Holy Healing] Firstly making sure the succubus can’t heal, then using her magic to heal Selena’s burnt arm.

Her body was shaking from both pain and exhaustion, barely able to fight more than that, the succubus tried to run away.

Swoosh! Using burning hands, Sofia launched herself toward the succubus. Gritting her teeth as this was still something she didn’t fully accept, the succubus looked human enough to make her stomach turn at the thought. ‘No, this is something that has to be done.’ [Fireblade] Sofia was aiming for the succubus’s chest, she wasn’t going to cry about it again.

“Insolent cattle!” The succubus snapped as she sensed Sofia’s weak magic, she instantly knew that she was nowhere near Cain’s level.

Clench! Crack! The succubus grabbed Sofia’s leg and countered with a straight punch to the guts. [Command] “Don’t move a muscle!” The succubus screamed as she turned to run away, not giving a second thought to Sofia. She knew that Sofia was almost out of MP so even ordering her to kill her friends was useless, she then resorted to this nasty command.

Don’t move a muscle, if you failed to resist, you will uncontrollably stop all the muscles you can control in your body from moving. This meant that Sofia who had a relatively low intelligence stat failed to resist and is now holding her breath. She was choking.

If they fought this furiously to save Cain, they most likely get distracted by Sofia choking to death. The succubus didn’t try and use it on the other two as Selena resisted a higher-level spell, and she wasn’t sure it will even work on a devil.

[Firebolt] a flash of flame came out of nowhere, hitting the succubus directly in the face. It wasn’t that strong she just swallowed the pain and kept on running. “Spindle’s Magic is weak! Spindle is useless!” she heard the gritting voice of a small creature in the dark, quickly realizing it was another devil.

Thud! Thud! Selena leaped at her. ‘Shit!’ Using the last of her magic [Mirror image].

Selena jumped at the succubus, biting her neck with full force, easily beheading her. Without stopping, she started mauling her body in frenzy, with each bite and claw strike, Selena ripped the succubus apart.

“Selena…” She could hear the faint voice in the distance, “Running…” Unable to comprehend what was told, Selena kept mauling and devouring her prey. “She is running away!” The screams slowly flowed into her head until… Slap! She felt something smack into the back of her neck, she turned around in anger just to See Alice standing there.

“What?” Selena snapped back to her senses, the meat she was eating is nowhere to be found. “Where is she?”

“Who cares, she ran away. Hurry Sofia can’t breathe!” It was already late, the succubus ran away when Selena was distracted by the spell ‘mirror image’.

Another sense of rage-filled Selena’s mind, she was about to rush behind the succubus but was stopped by Alice dragging her toward Sofia. She gritted her teeth at the loss of her prey.

“My magic can’t fix her breathing, blow air into her mouth and I will try to wake Cain, he might have a solution!” Alice quickly blurted what was in her head, she didn’t care whether Selena agreed or wanted to chase after the succubus, Sofia’s life took priority.

Selena agreed with her action, quickly rushing toward the trembling Sofia, blowing directly into her mouth.

“It’s getting out of her nose!” Selena reported, not knowing what to do. “Close it then!” Alice yelled the obvious answer.

‘Come on…Wake up!’ Alice cast [Holy Healing] over and over on Cain, biting his arm and slapping his face. She wanted him to wake as soon as possible otherwise Sofia might die. Desperate, she tried some drastic measures.

Pushing two fingers in his mouth (Holding his tongue in place so he won’t swallow it) and another is holding his lower half [Cursed Decay] Alice jolted him with her curse, the muscles in his body decomposed in one go, waking him up from the sharp pain. As he woke up in shock, he bit Alice’s fingers that were inserted into his mouth.

Alice cared less for her finger and screamed “Sofia is choking from the Succubus’s magic. Do something!”

Thanks to his high intelligence, Cain quickly sprang into action [Dispel Magic] Saving Sofia’s life. Cough! Agrahh! She woke up trying to breathe.

The fight was over, the succubus ran away leaving her severed tail behind. Cain sat on the ground trying to gather his thoughts. Why are they here, did they follow him? The Cubus would need more than an hour to reverse back into his original form and transform into an incubus, the girls most likely are safe.

“No one of you got attacked, right?” Cain asked, Alice understood what he meant by ‘Attacked’ She quickly clung to his arm crying.

“Idiot, what about you? You’re the one who got messed up in all of this!” She was right, the only one who suffered.

Smack! Selena punched him in the face, and Cain’s weak body rolled around like a ragdoll. “Why didn’t you take us with you? Look how you’re now-nyaAAA!” Selena screamed her discontent and anger, Both Alice and Sofia agreed with what she said.

“You! If I brought you with me, it would have turned into an Incubus, I not letting any of fall in the fiend’s hand!” Cain screamed, no sane man would allow his girls to go through what he went through.

They could understand what he wanted to do, but even so, they felt the same. None of them wanted him to go through that, just as he feared for them they feared for him.

After a couple of minutes of silence, Cain realized he was naked and stood looking for his clothes and armor. The girls calmed as well but settled their minds to make him learn his lesson.
