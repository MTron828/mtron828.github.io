The head priest was awaiting them in front of Chauntea’s statue praying.

“Is the ritual ready?” Cain asked.

“Not yet, I might need an hour to get a response.” The priest whispered quickly to not disturb his prayer. Cain could notice that he was serious, they need to wait.

“Let’s sit and wait,” Cain said as he took a seat. The girls did the same. Only Chad remained standing, his eyes glaring at the goddess statue.

Thud! Thud! He slowly walked toward the statue, “Why the wait? Why won’t she reply, it’s not like people are not praying to her.”

Even though he got a bit offended, the priest spoke in a calm voice. “Precisely, a lot are praying to her at the same time. She needs to give each of them the love and care they deserve so she needs time.”

Chad looked at him and smiled, “A fair answer if we talked about a mortal. But she is a god!” Chad turned toward the statue and started releasing his divine magic.

“I see, a paladin. That explains your attitude. But sadly it seems you’re not one of our goddess soldiers so she won’t respond.” The priest smiled. He could understand Chad better now.

Gods usually respond immediately to their paladin’s calls. That is why Chad was surprised she took the time to respond..

“So she only responds to her paladins? Then so be it, I know someone.” Chad lifted his hand and Cain had an exhausted look on his face.

[Summon Celestial] Ariel was an angel of Chauntea. She must be able to call her quicker.

The priest and the nuns froze in place when they saw an angel descend from the golden portal.

“Why did you call me?” Ariel looked around to make sure no Dracolich was around. “What is this? A church of her divinity Chauntea?”

“Yeah, you work for her right? We need her to bless a marriage for us.” Chad replied.

“Bless a marriage? I could do that if you want.” Ariel replied that she preferred to do it and not have to disturb Chauntea.

“No you might mess something up, just call the real deal,” Chad replied with a passive face.

“For your knowledge, we angel usually deal with such things.” Ariel pouted as she flew in the gate.

“You can call an angel? Are you a prophet? A pope or a divinely blessed paladin?” The priest cried.

Chad looked at him, “Nothing like that, I’m just here to see that my son gets married properly.” Chad didn’t care what was in front of him. He wanted to get his son married and doesn’t want to wait.

The priest looked at Cain, he remembered what Leon told him before. Cain was a hero blessed by the gods. Now even that hero’s father was able to summon an angel.

The priest smiled, this was a blessed day. “Do not worry sir, we will see to it that your son gets married to them all.”

The priest decided that the church will support Cain from that day on, it was clear as day that he mustn’t be ignored. Even if he could sense a horrendous aura coming from the maid standing at the back which kept him on edge. The priest was looking at Amaya.

Chad walked toward Cain to grab the rings, “A moment, I will get them blessed quickly.”

“We could have waited, you just poked a god in the back.” Cain wasn’t worried, even if this could become a problem later on.

Chad grabbed the rings and placed them on Chauntea’s alter. There was a total of six.

It only took a few seconds for everyone to feel a gust of holy wind and pollen. That refreshing and warm feeling was an indicator that the land mother Chauntea was looking upon them. The only one who felt sick was Amaya but she was quickly protected by Cain’s magic.

“Please, stand before the statue.” The priest signaled for Cain and his wives to approach.

Cain stood up and walked toward the statue, the girls slowly trailing behind him. “I Cain Lisworth, am here to marry Sofia Lawrence, Selena Atlanta, Alice Furberg, Gracie Gray, and Marina Ourals and take them as my wives.” Cain bowed slightly.

What was supposed to happen now is that the rings will glow with golden light if the goddess approved. Her divine presence will disappear if she refused.

Yet something unexpected happened.

“YOU EXPECT ME TO BLESS THE RINGS WHILE BLOCKING MY INFLUENCE?” A divine voice spoke up from the statue.

Cain giggled, “Aren’t you the one who tried to smite my maid out of nowhere? I’m just taking precautions now.”

“I SEE, THE ONES FROM THE EAST WERE SPOT ON ABOUT YOU. A MAN UNCHAINED FROM FATE, I CAN’T SEEM TO SEE YOUR FATE.”

“Thanks for the compliment, I hope you can bless those rings,” Cain said with a smile. If she wasn’t aggressive, she is pleased.

“I WILL DO, BUT FIRST, WHO IS THAT STANDING BEHIND YOU? WHY CAN HE SUMMON MY ANGELS?”

ɴ[0)ᴠᴇʟ Cain looked behind him, Chad was staring at the statue. Chauntea was right, Chad being able to summon her angels is weird.

Chauntea was divine rank 19, to be able to summon her angels you must be either a paladin of hers or a god that is higher than her in rank. Since Chad wasn’t her paladin, that meant he belonged to a higher-ranked god. The confusing part is that there is a single god higher than her at Rank 20 Taiia the goddess of the sun, which is not to be confused with Amaterasu the goddess of dusk and down which is a part of Taiia herself.

To put it in simpler terms, Taiia is the collective consciousness and divine power of Amaterasu the goddess of dusk and dawn, Ashura the god of destruction, and Selune also known as Tsukuyomi the goddess of the moon.

Chauntea couldn’t sense any of their presence in Chad, she could not sense the presence of any god she know in Chad. Yet he summoning her angels meant that there is a god out there with a divine rank higher than her that she doesn’t know.

“His father Chad,” Chad said.

“WHO’S THE GOD YOU SERVE?”

“None, this is my own power,” Chad replied honestly, if a god was supporting him, it’s one that even he doesn’t know.

Chauntea went silent for a moment, Cain could guess what she was thinking.

‘Either a newborn monster of a god, or the creator of all AO. I doubt it’s as he never contacts the mortal world so that means there is a new go out there.’Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“I ALREADY BLESSED THE RINGS, MAY YOUR LIFE BE FRUITFUL. ALSO SINCE AM I HERE, PRIEST GIVES THAT MAID A HOLY SYMBOL. AND YOU THERE, SERVANT OF THE UNKNOWN GOD, YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE AS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL BETWEEN US.” As Chauntea said that, a golden portal appeared and Ariel fell on her face.

“At least give me a useful one.” Chad looked down On Ariel who had her legs pointing up.

“SHE IS LIMITED BY YOUR POWER, NOT MINE.”

As she said that, they could feel her divine presence disappearing. Then suddenly it returned, “I LIKE THOSE WAYPOINTS, BUILD MORE AND I CAN HELP YOU WHEN YOU CALL.”

“I do intend to build more so look forward to it,” Cain replied as he grabbed the rings.

Chauntea’s presence disappeared. As Cain expected, the earth mother was one of the gentler gods, and a blessing to have her at rank 19.

When Cain and Chad looked around, everyone but Alice had pale looks on their faces. ‘I guess even with me protecting them, the presence of a divine rank 19 is too much.’
