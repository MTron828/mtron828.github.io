“Brother stop, he is here to help!” Alice screamed as loud as she could then started coughing.

Leon didn’t seem that amused by what was happening yet replied to Alice in a calm tone, never dropping his guard.

“Here to help? How and why he is hiding!” The spell Leon was preparing is [Lightning burst] a fourth-tier spell. He was intending to blast the whole window alongside Cain!

The window was closed but not locked, Cain entered to face Leon. “Calm down for a moment will you?” Cain said, trying not to shout! [Lightning burst] is indeed a strong spell, getting hit directly will be fatal!

Cain could counter it with other spells but he chose not to, he wasn’t here to have a deathmatch with Leon anyway!

“I told you to stop, Idiot! Just listen to me!” After hearing Alice barely able to scream he finally showed signs of calming down. He did put his wand down but the Mana concentration around him never dropped, he could still unleash the spell in the blink of an eye!

Since things seemed to have calmed down, Alice signaled to Cain with her hand to come closer. ‘She isn’t speaking? Don’t tell me!’ Cain rushed toward her, [Lesser healing]

She had damaged her throat from screaming too much, luckily Cain was there to heal her quickly so she could speak again!

“A cleric? Why would someone from the church be lurking like a burglar in other people’s houses?” Leon was as far away from trusting Cain as he could. The tension between them was like that of a Lion and Tiger staring at each other!

“I will be the one explaining, you two just listen!” Alice said, even if it was taxing at her body as she was the only one to do it!

After hearing Alice’s short explanation, Leon was left with a lot of questions! How did Cain know about that? Isn’t he lying? You can’t just turn my little sister into a devil!

With all those thoughts, he wasn’t going to trust Cain out of the blue! He could only tolerate his existence as it was Alice’s wish.

Leon pulled a chair and sat on it beside Alice’s bed, “Speak, Why would you need to call me here then?”

“The basement’s keys, the cursed object used in the original spell is there! We need it to complete the spell and give Alice a body that can withstand her soul!” Cain said with confidence, intentionally avoiding calling it a devil as Leon was easily triggered by that!

Leon finally agreed to help, even though he will go with Cain to the basement! As he felt the commotion, Daraku decided to stay away for some time!

Leon had gone and grabbed the key from his father’s office. That basement was locked just a few weeks after Alice’s birth, it seemed strange that the cursed object would be hidden there!

That fact alone suggested that the one responsible for Alice’s condition was someone from the family that had access to the basement! The suspects are him, his mother, his father William and lastly his older brother Jack!

“You’re behind me, right? I’m going to open it!” Leon said, swiftly glancing behind him. Cain was already standing there.

Clack! Clack! Leon opened the locks one after the other and then slowly pushed the door open. Ziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! It wasn’t oiled that well!

The basement was filled with dust and cobwebs, cracked wooden boxes everywhere. The smell wasn’t pleasing either, it smelled of dust and rot!

That’s what you would expect from a humid basement that was locked for almost 20 years!

As soon as he had the chance, Cain started following the magic again, trying to locate the cursed object! It didn’t take him long to reach a closed wooden box That seemed to not have been damaged.

Crack! Cain smashed the lid open without waiting, revealing what seemed like a small statue of a man. Made of bronze and almost one foot tall!

Even as simple the status looked, barely showing any detail besides the limbs. The curse rising from it was almost nausea-inducing!

“This is our cursed object! A devil figure!” Cain said with a grin on his face. Devil figures were rare, those magical items were created to teach people how to summon devils! An item only used by evil cults and some weird devil worshipers!

Those were happy news, They meant that for the last 20 years, whoever one cast the curse on Alice, hadn’t passed the first grade in that type of magic! They were facing a novice spell user, hopefully! As he might have passed that level and had just given up on Alice.

Upon touching the cursed object, Cain could feel a type of Mana he recognized well, It was Jack’s!

Twenty years before he was just 20 years old right? Did he perform this experiment on Alice as she was born, is that even possible?? Cain had a lot of questions on his mind and needed someone to answer them.

“Would you mind touching it yourself, I believe you will find an interesting type of Mana in it!” Cain asked Leon since he was a mage and should be able to discern that!

Leon’s expression changed as soon as he sensed Jack’s Mana in the cursed object. “That bastard, I will kill him myself!” Leon was furious, with that it was obvious that Jack was the one who caused Alice to be like that!

Cain can’t just let Leon rush toward Jack blindly, that might disturb their plans! “Calm down, Let’s focus on saving Alice first, killing Jack comes after that!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

There wasn’t anything wrong with what Cain said, Leon’s priorities should be Alice’s well-being, then killing Jack! “By the way, I hope this will clear any misunderstanding between us!” Cain took his mask off, this was the best opportunity to justify them attacking? Jack this morning in the guild!

Leon seemed surprised for a moment as he saw Cain’s face for the first time yet he instantly accepted it! “We were already getting sick of Jack’s weird actions, we thought you beating him was a lesson he might take to redeem himself but now…” Leon paused for a moment “I guess I can’t get angry at you for that, killing the lord’s son in daylight will be a problem!”

“Can I kill him now?” Cain asked jokingly, the tension between them seems to be fading away slowly.

“Not publicly, we have to find a place so we can kill him without anyone noticing! Hurting my cute Alice is a sin punishable by death!” Leon was serious, he seemed to be serious about ending his brother’s life!

“He was the one leading the bandit group outside the city, I was the one who cleared that cave so they shouldn’t be a problem at this time!” Cain was pushing even further, now that he had Leon ready to kill Jack, he only needed one last motive!

“Hold up? Are you saying that Jack was the bastard leading the Bandits all those years?” Leon had a stupid face as if he had just heard a bad joke.

Cain just crossed his arms and nodded, “Sadly yes, we should be able to find evidence of their content at some point!” Cain said suggesting they search Jack’s room after all of this is done!

“I will inform my father, he will be extremely pleased to talk with Jack!” The look on Leon’s face was menacing, he was out for blood! And from the look of it, his father would also go after Jack!

It was going to be a long night!
