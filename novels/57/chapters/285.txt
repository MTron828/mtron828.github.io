After having a short walk in the city, Cain visited William. He simply wanted to ask for a spot outside the city to use. To his surprise, Alice has already arranged that with Leon. She seems to have asked him a day before to provide her with a 30-square plot of land for building.

“I didn’t expect this…” Cain said with a smile as Leon handed him the papers.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I was really excited when she told me about the teleportation. It will be beneficial for the city to have such a device. Those papers usually take about a month to get finished but for this occasion, I can break some rules. The plot is you’re and I will deal with the annoying work later.” Leon pointed at a pile of paper on the desk.

“Thanks for that, but what happened to William? I haven’t seen him yet.” Cain asked.

“Father is having a short vacation with mother. They have headed to the Lloyd farm.” Leon said with a stern face.

After glaring at him for a moment, Cain finally catches up. “Don’t tell me…”

“Sadly, he didn’t make it. Isaac have passed away last week. We even wanted to get everything done as quickly as possible…” Leon looked down with an ashen sad face.

“Get it done quickly?” Cain asked.

“Well, you know that my father is old and wants to retire…” Leon said.

“That I know. When does the Lloyd family come into play?”

“I and Leyla seemed to get along pretty well, she was smart and responsible, gentle, and most importantly didn’t have the greed other noble women have here, since she was a commoner. After a long discussion with her, we decided to…”

“Get married?” Cain finished the sentence, as Leon seemed to hesitate to say it.

“True, but seeing that Isaac’s condition was getting worse and worse, we did a quick ceremony there for starters and were preparing to get the wedding done. But right now, sadly he passed away before seeing his daughter in her wedding dress.” Leon smashed his fist on the table, and a wave of clear anger and frustration burned in his eyes.

“So you’re halting the wedding for the time being?” Cain asked. It would be hard for the bride to enjoy her wedding right after her father’s death.

“We’re not. Isaac’s final wish was for the wedding to continue.” Leon looked down.

“I’ve held you back for long enough, get married and live your life. Those were his last words to Leyla. We can’t stop after hearing that.” Leon growled.

“I genuinely don’t know what to say, let me think for a moment.” Cain stopped to think of what to say.

~Hey father, can I have your advice~ Cain decided to try to contact his father through [Message] he then explained the situation briefly and got an answer.

“A father is neither an anchor to hold us back, nor a sail to take us there, but a guiding light whose love shows us the way. Now you’re her light so smile proudly.” Cain tried to say it as best as he could.

Leon stared at him silently for a second before standing up, “C-can you excuse me for now? I have some things to take care of.” Leon said as he turned around quickly.

“Well then, see you later.” Cain left immediately to give Leon some time alone.

~How was it?~ Chad asked.

~It seems to have worked well, I didn’t know you had some words~ Cain replied to his father with a smile.

~Those were not mine. They are Ulf’s words~ Chad referred to the beast god.

~Well then, see you back home~ Cain cut the conversation as he used [Fly] he wanted to go check the plot of land that Leon prepared.

“Damn the air is cold!” Cain gasped as the cold wind burned his nose.

The plot of land that Leon referred to was located just outside the gate. Close enough to be protected while being outside the wall to prevent unwanted entry.

Cain cracked his fingers. He should cast the magic when he has time.

Cain drew his sword and started drawing a circle on the ground. Each of his steps was calculated to the point he ended up with a perfect circle.

Inside the circle, he inscribed the magic spell with a mixture of his personal magic language and Sylph’s language. Magic language refers to the coding method used in the magic configuration. By doing that, the letter written on the circle were impossible to decipher without him.

He mixed [Arcane Gate] with [Teleportation Circle] and [Teleport] all linked to a dungeon core inside of [Lisworth’s Infinite Maze]

Now all that was needed was to have someone from Leon’s side build a nice room or decoration around the circle. Cain knew that if he was the one to build it he will just make a bland cube of stone. It was best to leave such a thing to someone with a more artistic touch.

The magic will activate when a button is pressed inside. The first stage is teleporting everything to a secluded room in Cain’s maze. The second stage is scanning everything to make sure nothing dangerous is transported, like detecting necrotic or cursed magic. The third stage was to teleport them from the maze to the second teleportation circle in Ourals. This process can be carried in both directions and consume magic from the maze.

Cain then opened an [Arcane Gate] and went to Ourals to keep through the maze.

The moment he walked into Marina’s room through the gate, he found her naked as she was changing her clothes.

“Hello.” He greeted her casually.

Marina quickly jumped to the bed and covered her body with the blanket. “W-what brought you so suddenly?” She was shaking.

“Sorry for scaring you, I’m here to install a waypoint. Can I have you prepare a plot of land outside the city in the next few days?” Cain asked with a smile.

Marina stared at him for a second before opening her mouth, “L-lady Alice has asked me to prepare beforehand, do you want it right now?” Marina stuttered as she was talking.

Cain blanket, “She informed you? I have to thank her later.” Cain didn’t expect this as well. Alice really got his back, she took care of anything he needed.

“L-lady Alice did help me a lot, she always seemed to know what I might need as well,” Marina said with a faint smile.

Alice was taking care of everything as Cain wanted it to be. Her wisdom seems to be helping her a lot.

“Would you mind giving me a map then, I would like to check it immediately if it’s ready. Also, send some people to decorate it after I finish.” Cain said as sat on a chair.

“Ludic!” Marina called to her maid that was standing outside. Ludic’s face paled immediately as she saw Cain inside. “My lady, how can I help you?”

“Ludic, Please lead him to my study room and hand him the paper I keep in the drawer. Remember to be respectful.” Marina said with a forced smile.

“As you wish.” Ludic then slowly led Cain to the study room. Unlike the people in Furberg who saw Cain as a hero or a champion, here in Ourals they saw him as an overpowered monster who can erase the whole city if offended.

Ludic could feel her knees stiffening as she heard Cain walk behind her. The silence was killing her with anxiety. Cain didn’t say a word or smile in a minute.

She was quickly getting worried about her walking, was she walking too slow for his liking? ‘I was just wiping the floor, I don’t smell bad right?’

‘Is he offended by having me guide him instead of Lady Marina?’ Ludic’s head kept creating stories, she even imagined herself being killed the moment she opens her mouth to speak.

She gathered her courage and finally turned toward Cain and spoke, “We’re getting close, it’s just behind this corner…” She froze the moment she saw Cain glaring at her intensely. At that moment she felt as if her soul left her body from fear.

Cain on the other hand was intrigued with something on her, the frills on her maid outfit looked amazing. He was thinking of a way to ask her where did she get those so he can order some for his maids.
