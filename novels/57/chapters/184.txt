[Demon will sword] Kayden’s most powerful spell, allows him to strike five targets simultaneously. With his [Triple slash] martial skill he can send three slashes at each target.

He was aiming three at Selena, Three at Cain, three at Alice, Three at Sofia, and three at Gracie. ‘It’s over, even if some of them survived, I will surely kill the white-haired one.’ Kayden thought as he swung his blade down.

[Counter spell] in a single moment, Kayden’s body appeared before his sword could gain speed. Two glowing blue eyes stared at him from underneath Alice’s hands.

‘He was still conscious?’ Kayden tightened the grip on his sword, swinging ever so faster. Even if his spell was canceled he still had his one strike, it was far from over.

“You die here!” He growled [Triple slash].

Alice jumped in and took the hit instead of Cain, three gaping wounds crossed her torso, and she was a hair strand from having her organs spill. Slap! Swallowing the pain, she grabbed Kayden’s face in her palm. “This hurts.” She growled.

Alice’s sense of pain was off, with how much she faced in her life. A wound like this should have knocked a normal person unconscious, it was just as painful as whiplash but not enough to take her down. Her [Holy Healing] and devil’s body kept her HP from hitting 0.

[Holy Healing……………………………..]

A stream of holy magic rushed from her hand and directly into Kayden’s body, A trick she had learned from Cain. When they first met in her bath, he showered her body with consecutive healing spells to mend her wounds.

But unlike his, she doesn’t have the intelligence to cast spells like that. She had one solution, keep the first spell active and let it flows like a stream. It was the solution her wisdom could come up with.

Kayden’s body screamed in pain as the holy magic broke him from the inside. His wounds that were in the middle of healing have started to open back up. ‘I should run, this devil is a problem.’

With a single step, he kicked Alice away. “Demon…” Bam! A punch landed on his face, He staggered to the left and then swung his sword at Selena.

Selena quickly left her arm and blocked his sword directly, he wasn’t able to cut her arm. He was getting weaker and Selena noticed it. “GAW!” Sent another punch toward his, he ducked down and dodged the attack. [Blade flow] using his momentum to send a slash at her knee, aiming to cut her leg off.

Noticing that, Selena used her feet claws to grip the ground and pull her knee down. Taking the blade with her rectus femoris, his blade stopped a nail deep in her flesh.

‘Too dense to slash?’

Swoosh! A black, whip-like thing smacked his face leaving a red mark. He quickly tried to regain his stance, that tail attack seems to have broken some of his teeth. With what was her body made, every spot on her body was just a mass of muscles, bones, and thick hide-like skin.

To Gracie who was observing their fights, they seemed to move faster and faster with each move. It wasn’t Kayden who was getting weaker or slower. It was Selena who was getting faster.

Each time she was wounded, she was getting angrier and more violent. With each strike, she stood less on two legs and was instead on four. She reached a point where she wasn’t bothering to block Kayden’s slashes, she just tanked them and punched back.

[Fire breath] a flash of fire came out of nowhere, Kayden looked at it was coming from Sofia’s direction, she had regained her composure and used the last bit of her Mana to attack.

“Such an obvious…” Selena was in a frenzy so punched him immediately, it was a mistake to take his eyes from her for even a millisecond. The fire breath hit both of them.

Kayden staggered down, those bunch of girls had wiped the floor with him. If it wasn’t for that dammed white-haired guy if he just didn’t make him waste so much MP. This fight would have been an easy win.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Selena was almost out as exhaustion was getting to her, she was already pushing her body to its limit.

“I will kill you, even if it was only you!” Kayden growled rushing toward the fallen Cain, those remaining two eyes of him gushed with blood from rage.

Swoosh! A maid jumped from the shadow beside Cain swinging her two daggers at Kayden’s neck. Tuf! A white mass of saliva was already flying toward his face.

He swung his blade nonetheless, if she wanted to die with him so let be it! He will slice the both of them.

Before the two of them could clash, Meliliana flew in and grabbed Kayden. Without wasting a second. Even though Gracie had cut her tail instead of Kayden’s neck, Meliliana flew away with him.

“Let me go, we have to kill him!” He growled, “I will rip you apart!” He yelled trying to stab her with his blade.

“We have to run, she is coming!” Meliliana cried in terror, and Kayden looked behind to see the red dragon flying toward them. Zaleria’s maw was already open and it was gathering flames.

Meliliana kept cursing as she flapped her bloodied wings as fast as she could, she could sense the terror Zaleria was about to unleash. She didn’t feel such concentrated magic from Morena even once, if they took that breath head-on, they would evaporate.

“Fly faster!” Kayden screamed.

“You own me one if we survived!” She cried. If she could beg that dragon to not fire she would do it.

A brilliant light flashed from Zaleria’s maw as she unleashed a full power breath, A massive cone of deep crimson flames stained the sky red. The mountain shook as the firelight faded. Meliliana and Kayden were nowhere to be seen.

Zaleria transformed back into a human and landed standing a few feet away from the girls. They felt strange as they couldn’t feel the heat from her breath earlier she must have controlled it so they will stay safe.

“We talk later, Call the villagers, we need medical help!” Zaleria shouted and Gracie rushed back toward the village as she was the only one able to run beside Zaleria. To her surprise, Lexi was already running toward them with the necessary items.

Gracie felt proud of her, she had realized that the fight was over and started preparing early. Gracie immediately turned back to guide Lexi and the other toward the rest.

As Gracie went to bring help, Zaleria went toward Alice to do something that might seem cruel. Alice was unconscious from her wounds, the sole reason why Meliliana could move and take Kayden and run.

“Wake up, you have to change back to human form.” Zaleria shake her but she didn’t wake up.

“I guess I have no choice…” Zaleria grabbed Alice’s finger and broke one of them to wake her up. Her hands had a lot of nerves so the pain was just enough. “Switchback…”

Zaleria managed to get Alice into her human form before the medics could arrive. The fight was over or was it…nobody knew.
