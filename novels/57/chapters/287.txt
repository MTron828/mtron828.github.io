“So if you all understand I must take my leave, I still have a lot of work after all. Not like you.” Cain smiled as he teleported away.

The nobles looked at each other in terror and then glared at Marina in disgust.

“This all your fault for being…” The noble suddenly disappeared after he started yelling.

“You thought I teleported away? I just used invisibility.” Cain appeared from nowhere. “Listen, I won’t bother you as long as you do your work. In addition, most importantly, respect her. I don’t blame you for supporting the previous lord in turning thousands of soldiers into undead and causing a full-on war, I don’t even need you to redeem yourselves.” Cain walked toward the nobles.

“By this kingdom’s law, Bancroft has been sentenced to death. That sentence carries over to all the people involved and their families up to the third degree. That means, Bancroft and his father, grandfather, children, and grandchildren of age. You nobles and your parents, grandparents, children, and grandchildren of age. I believe you all know the law related to the use of necromancy.”

Cain explained, “That’s…” One of the nobles gasped with a pale face.

“The kingdom stooped with just killing him since am taking over the city. Do you understand?” Cain growled at them.

“Lord Cain, would you allow us to swear our diligence?” One of the nobles that looked fairly old approached Cain. “You are?” Cain asked.

“The guard general, I’m responsible for the city defense and law enforcement.” The old man replied.

“Don’t swear your allegiance to me but to her. Your duts to keep order so follow her rule.” Cain pointed at Marina. The old man bowed to her deeply.

After that, the nobles swore allegiance to Marina one after the other. Cain left after he was happy with the result.

‘Let see, this is the place.’ Cain landed where Marina’s map led him. The location was already cleared and flattened for him.

He then quickly repeated the same process he did at Furberg and created the magic circle. ‘This should be enough for now, let’s head back home.’

Cain quickly returned home using the maze. He looked outside his room window. It was afternoon. Time flies by.

Cain stretched his arms, it was unexpected to have that quick confrontation with Ourals nobles but it was better for them to fear him for the time being.

“Cain, did you return?” Suddenly Alice knocked on the door, “Who else could it be? If you felt me then it’s me, that obvious right?” Cain opened the door for her.

“I was just asking, did you finish what you had to do?”

“Yeah, faced some slight troubles but nothing a blade can’t fix.” Cain cracked his neck.

“A monster?”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“No, just some annoying nobles from Ourals. They were sabotaging the city by refusing to follow Marina’s orders or help her with the work.”

“Don’t tell me you killed them? We need them you know that?” Alice glared at him sharply.

“Of course not, I just killed one…probably two,” Cain mumbled as he averted his eyes.

Alice quickly grabbed him by the ear, “Violence doesn’t solve everything!” She yelled at him.

“If it didn’t work, that only meant I wasn’t using enough. Just look at yourself using violence against me!” Cain cried.

Alice quickly released his ear and clenched her hand, “Sorry, I didn’t mean it…”

Cain burst laughing, “Don’t mind it, don’t mind it. Let’s go have something to drink.” Cain patted her shoulder.

“But it’s…” Alice tried to speak but Cain glared at her.

“Listen, I don’t care about those noble ethics and the other things. In fact, none of us cares. Who cares if you grabbed my ear, it’s between me and you and no one else.” Cain carried her, “I will carry you downstairs.” Cain used [Telekinesis] to open the door.

Alice tried her hardest to escape his grasp but failed, for some reason she seemed to get weak in his arms. “Cain let me down,” She cried.

The maid glared at them and started giggling, Alice started dying from embarrassment.

“Cain let me go, I’m dying here!” She cried with her face beet red. Cain could feel her arms shaking.

“Dying in my hand? After the world ends.” Cain jumped down the steps to the dining hall when he found Gracie talking with Elsie.

“Elsie, do we have some tea ready?” Cain asked.

“We do have some tea for you and the princess.” Elsie smiled as she rushed toward the kitchen.

Cain sat Alice on one of the couches. and Gracie sat beside them.

“Where are Sofia and Selena?” Cain asked Gracie.

“I’m here. I was just playing with my magic in my room.” Sofia walked down the stairs with a gentle smile. “I still can’t use cold magic though.” She quickly jumped to Cain’s side.

“Ara, ara. Back so quickly?” Cain heard the voice of a woman call him from the kitchen. When he looked, it was Elena, Selena’s mother.

“Well, I’m not a hunter…” Cain smiled.

“Selena is taking a quick bath, she was helping me butcher a deer earlier.” Elena smiled as she glared at Cain with a big knife in her hand.

“Butcher a deer, did Father-in-law Seith hunt it?” Cain smiled at her.

“Ara, father-in-law already. Then I’m your mother-in-law. That’s true, he caught it early this morning.” Elena giggled, it was fascinating to see a mature version of Selena smile.

“Tea is ready, snacks as well.” Elise returned with the tea. Selena quickly got out of the bath, she seemed to have smelled Cain so she finished quickly.

“Cain-nya!” She immediately jumped at him, “OHH!” Cain gasped as he felt her claws sink deep into his thighs.

“Selena! Your claws!” Sofia yelled at her.

[Holy Healing]

Selena quickly backed down with her ears down, “Sorry, I was just using the jaguar form-nya…” Selena apologized.

“Swimming with it in the bath? Should I build you a swimming pool?” Cain suggested.

“Aren’t you angry-nya?” Selena looked at him.

“This is but a scratch, I told Alice earlier but you need more than this to anger me. But please don’t try it again as your claws can cut through my bones!”

“Swimming pool?” Gracie stared at Cain, she had never heard about such a thing.

“Just a big hole filled with water, It can be a lot of fun,” Cain replied with a gentle smile.

“Let’s have a drink and then we can go check it out.” Cain grabbed his teacup and started sipping.

“Check it out?” Sofia stared at him.

“Well, it’s not built yet so let’s get done quickly.” Cain lifted his palm and a gentle wave of magic emerged [Summon Fey: Mei]

Mei appeared sitting on his palm, “Lord Cain, How did the wand work?” Mei quickly flew toward Cain’s face and started poking his nose.

Cain grabbed her by her legs and pulled her down, “It’s bad to breathe fairy dust so don’t fly that close to my nose without warning.”

“Tch, you’re no fun.” Mei sat on the table and put a leg on the other, “So why did you call me?”

“Well, I wanted you to build us a swimming pool in the maze as quickly as you can. I will open a new room and provide you with warm water and everything else.”

“Swimming pool? You mean a pond?” Mei stared at Cain.

“Yes, do you think you can do it?” Cain stared at her.

Mei puffed her chest and stood, “It will only take a couple of minutes!”

“Ah before you leave, take her with you.” Cain pointed toward Amaya who was cleaning in the background.

Mei stared at Amaya, “She smells weird…”

“Me?” Amaya stared at Cain in confusion as she saw them staring at her.

“Yeah, it will be a great experience so have fun until we arrive.” Cain waved his hand at Amaya.

“Let’s go then!” Mei yelled in excitement as she zapped toward Amaya like a bee. Poof, they both disappeared immediately as soon as they touched.

“Will she be alright?” Alice asked with a worried face.

“Yep, Let’s finish so we can follow them.” Cain replied and then turned toward Selena, “You will have enough space to swim as you like,” He could see her tail swinging left and right.

Sofia took a big sip from her cup, the day was going slowly for her as she trained with magic until Cain returned. He always managed to break what they thought was normal.

“How could you have such precise control over magic…” Sofia mumbled as she thought about the day Cain first taught her magic.

“Practice makes perfect,” Cain replied immediately with a wide smile.
