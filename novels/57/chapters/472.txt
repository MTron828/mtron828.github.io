Cain quickly averaged the sinner’s stats and numbers, 108 small fries and five big ones. He should be able to take them out quickly.

‘Let’s try it.’ His first brain thought, ‘But it will consume a significant amount of MP.’ the second brain objected.

The decision was quickly made ‘Let’s use it only on the big five as they should offer a good amount of Exp.’

Cain pulled his sword and started walking toward the horde, “Where are you going alone?” Farryn grabbed his shoulder.

“Test some magic, this is hell after all.” Cain pushed her hand away and disappeared.

“Let him be, those things aren’t enough to pose a threat to him,” Zaleria told her.

Nonetheless, Farryn pulled her hammer and sat on the wall watching, ready to attack in an emergency.

The girls lined up to watch the show while the village chief was confused and about to panic. “Does he intend to face all of those alone? We must help him.” He gasped.

“Listen…” Alice said turning toward the village chief. “You call me an upper rank but…do you know how strong he is?”

“What do you mean?”

“Even at my best, I won’t reach his knees. Amongst everyone here, he is the most dangerous, as here, he is unhinged.” Alice said.

Here in hell, Cain didn’t need to worry about collateral damage, lasting destruction, and the people lively hood. There is no forest to burn, no corpses to preserve, no cities to care for nor an eye to watch him. He can use all his magic, the beautiful and the nasty alike.

‘Opening the Draconis fundamentum…’ the first brain started, ‘Opening finished, sync with the Chimera finished, enchanting is possible.’ [Fire]=> [Necrotic]

Cain changed the type of magic that his Draconis generate from fire to necrotic. Simply put, the fire he can output was too weak to use, considering he took the Draconis from a young dragon.

But upon shifting it to necrotic, he can use a necrotic breath instead of fire. But there was a catch, the necrotic breath deals no damage at all. Instead, it turns those who fail to resist the magic into undead. And since it’s him casting the magic, the chance of those weaklings resisting it is almost non-existent.

Thud! As he appeared in front of the sinners, Cain opened his mouth and a black come of necrotic magic blasted forward.

In an instant, he washed the mob with it, turning the Lemure and Nupperibo into zombies leaving only the five giants.

Seeing him appear out of nowhere like that, the giants immediately tried to stomp him down.

A single glare from him stooped them in their place. [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster]

‘Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death,’

Almost flying their brains, Cain overloaded them with a single order to the point they started bleeding from the inside. The veins in their feeble minds burst and their nerves were unable to handle the extreme abuse.

[Enchanting: Ringing blade] [Elemental weapon: Lightning blade] Cain extended his sword with lightning and leaped forward with [Thunder step]

CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! CLAP! With ten lightning-fast swings. A cross-shaped cut, one across the chest cutting the heart and a downward one cutting the brain and spine, the five giants all have been sliced into four pieces. With a lightning clap!

Almost instantly, from the pools of lava around, five giant skeletons emerged with a loud creek. Organs filled their inside as flesh covered their steaming bones.

GROWAAA! With a scream of agony, skin covered their flesh.

As soon as they opened their eyes, Cain was the first thing they saw.

[Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster] [Dominate Monster]

‘Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death, Resurrect immediately after death,’ Their brains spiked again as Cain wasn’t going to let them rest, he neither cared about them to feel pity.

CLAP!

And again, and again, and again, and again.

He once again spiked them when they resurrected, but this time he didn’t kill them immediately but instead stared at the horde of undead he created.

“Need some Mana, don’t forget to resurrect immediately.” He instantly destroyed and absorbed the undead he created and turned them into necrotic magic which got refined by his Draconis fundamentum back into mana.

MP: 1569/4176 => MP: 2022/4176

‘We’re in hell, I should keep half of my mana in case of an emergency, can’t just use everything.’ Cain teleported back to the girls.

The giants were writhing in agony on a pile of their own corpses, drowning the Lemure and Nupperibo in a pool of their blood.

The devils in the village backed down seeing Cain approach, ‘Is this how the devils of the lower layers fight?’ they thought. If they had made a single mistake. If one of them said one wrong word. If one of them had looked at Cain or the girls the wrong way, they might have ended up like those sinners.

That thought alone was enough to cause some of the devils to faint. Death had been a normal occurrence to them, and now their fear of it has been rejuvenated.

Cain wouldn’t let them live or die, but instead, keep them hanging in the middle suffering in agony.

“They are yours now, go…” Cain said to the girls pointing behind him.

“That’s savage, couldn’t you be a bit more civilized?” Zaleria stared at him.

“Said the woman who ate a giant’s liver in front of his eyes,” Cain replied.

“When did I ever do that?” She stared at him confused even more.

“Just go get some Exp, all of you.” Hearing his words, all the girls rushed in to kill the giants except Farryn whom he held down. “You are already high enough, don’t waste their chance.”

The giants were disabled due to Cain’s [Dominate Monster] and should resurrect one last time. The small ones were stuck in the blood. Killing them should be easy.

After that, it will be up to them if they want to resurrect immediately or not. Considering what they went through, those giants would choose to fully use their downtime.

Cain sat on the wall with Mary, Ellie, and Farryn at his sides.

Mary was faking a worried face. Farryn had a passive face. And Ellie was terrified with her knees shaking, she never knew her master had such power.
