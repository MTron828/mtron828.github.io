CRACK! Zaleria punched Morena’s ribcage as hard as she could. The bones cracked but got instantly repaired by the almost limitless necrotic magic in Morena’s body.

“Useless, Just like how humans can never best zombies barehanded. You have no chance beating a dracolich!” Morena growled as she swung a left-handed claw at Zaleria’s head.

THUD! The earth shattered as Zaleria grabbed Morena’s hand and flipped backward. Morena’s body was pulled with a massive force, she felt as if her arm was about to be ripped apart.

Seeing such a massive creature left some people standing in awe just to be killed by the shock wave of Zaleria landing.

CRACK! Just as if by magic, Zaleria twisted her body and sent a kick from her hind legs at Morena’s face. A move that was considered almost impossible for dragons to perform due to their weird anatomy.

Morena was taken by surprise and her jaw ended up being shattered. “You’re crazy!” Morena growled as she saw Zaleria grab her with a bear hug.

FISCHH! A jet of flames emerged from Zaleria’s hind legs lifting both her and her sister to the sky. VROOOM! Zaleria turned upside down and flapped her wings as hard as she could, flying straight to the ground.

CRACK! Smacking Morena’s head to the ground caused a massive shock wave that was followed by a crimson explosion.

Zaleria flew away and landed with her eyes on the explosion. ROAR! She didn’t even bother talking, prowling around like a starving cat. Flames gushed from her mouth and nostrils as her scales glowed red.

From the flames, Morena walked as if she was never hurt. Her bones regenerated and she was dripping with necrotic magic.

“Fighting you like this made me realize. You’re talented, just like our mother. No matter how much I struggled in life I will never have the chance of reaching you.” Morena growled. “But now is a different matter, I have transcended life and death so you will not stand in my face again.”

Zaleria didn’t even bother listening anymore and shot a breath at Morena. With a massive blast, Morena deflected the breath with a claw strike.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“So you won’t even listen, then die!” Morena yelled as she used her magic to call the finest of her undead. Having a couple of death knights and lichs will quicken the process.

After waiting for a second, she was enraged as her servants didn’t appear so she turned her head toward them. She only saw a trail of ash before Zaleria took the chance and pounced at her.

“When did you have the time to burn them?” Morena growled as she conjured a lance of necrotic magic and stabbed Zaleria’s left shoulder.

Zaleria grinned at her, “I wonder when I did!”

Morena spotted a single knight rushing toward Zaleria’s tail on horseback. The knight was topless beside a golden cap that flapped behind his back. In his hand was a golden glowing halberd that screamed with holy magic.

Chad rushed with his horse and rode Zaleria’s tail. Racing on her back and leaping to the sky using her head as a stepping stone.

“You bastard!” A lich flew from behind Morena toward Chad with a necrotic spell glowing in his staff.

Chad swung his halberd and sliced the lich in half. [Banishing Smite] BAM! The lichs body turned to dust upon impact, and Chad’s banished the lich’s soul back to its phylactery.

Chad’s halberd disintegrated with the attack.

Morena immediately opened her mouth to breathe at him. HOP! Chad leaped from his horse to avoid the breath.

Zaleria wasn’t counting on him dodging so she pushed her arm and punched Morena’s jaw closed. The breath failed to release.

Seeing Chad falling toward her head with a punch Morena grinned. “What could a human do? The best you could reach is temporarily shutting my underline!” Morena growled but she suddenly saw Chad’s fist glowing.

[Banishing Smite] Just Chad’s fist connected, the spell shocked the link between the phylactery and Morena’s skeletal body. The unexpected strength behind his punch coupled with the spell effect caused his punch to drill Morena’s head into the ground with a massive BOOM!

Even Zaleria had her jaw open, no wonder he snapped her arm the other day.

Thud! Chad landed beside Morena’s head and hit her with a back Kick [Banishing Smite] BOOM! Her massive body went rolling.

Chad was panting, his body dripping with sweat as he fought the urge to collapse. “I can’t keep the spell up longer!” Mei stared up from his pocket. She was using magic to increase his weight and help with the recoil.

Chad stared at his shaking hand, he was almost out of MP. He didn’t have time to carry MP potions and is now almost passing out. ‘I miscalculated how much magic I can spam,” He forgets that his Mana decreased after evolving into a high human.

“Guess I have no choice.” Chad lifted his palm up, the trump Card he was hiding since it might strike a nerve in Cain. This was their only hope.

[Summon Celestial] A small golden portal the size of an apple appeared on top of Chad’s palm. It was trying to expand but being stopped by his lack of Mana.

“Sorry, the hole is too small for me to pass through. Try later!” The bewildering voice of a woman came from the other side.

Being visibly annoyed, Chad jammed his hand in the hole and grabbed the woman by her ankle. “Get your arse here!” He tried to pull her body through the apple-sized hole.

Feeling her body almost turning into mush she used her own Mana to expand the portal.

A golden-haired pale woman got dragged from the portal. She was wearing full plate armor and carrying a greatsword and warbow on her back. She glared at Chad with her green eyes.

“What was that for you…” Before she could finish yelling Chad grabbed her head. “Behind you, we need to take that thing down.”

She closed her mouth immediately, she couldn’t distinguish if he was intimidating or charming. In her head, she knew he was using his Charisma on her but she yielded on her own. For some reason, he seemed different than the last time she saw him.

She slowly turned around and looked at Morena standing up. Her eyes opened wide, “What is a dracolich doing here?” She turned and started shaking Chad.

“Hell I care, we need to kill it and that’s it!” Chad replied with an exhausted face.

“I know that we don’t get well with the undead, but calling me for a dracolich. Are you crazy?” The woman cried.

“I felt her phylactery link shake when I hit her with banishing smite. You should be able to handle it.” Chad replied as he pushed the woman toward Morena.

“An angel? How an ant like you is able to summon one?” Morena growled, “Was it a magic item?”

“Huh?” The angel’s face twisted as she heard Morena’s words. “Bitch the hell did you call him?”

The angel pulled her warbow and charged a shot, [Homing Holy Shot] BAM! She released a massive golden arrow that resembled a spear.

Morena instantly recognized it as holy magic and flew upward. The arrow immediately changed its direction and followed her.

“What?” Morena gasped and suddenly another arrow hit the back of her head. And in that moment of distraction, the first arrow caught up to her and exploded.

“GRWAAA” Morena growled. Unlike Zaleria’s attack that could heal with necrotic magic, the holy magic in the angel’s attacks prevented her from regenerating.

“Die!” Charging her breath in an attempt to blast everything. She was cut short when a golden chain wrapped around her neck and pulled her head toward her tail.

Up in the sky, Morena saw the angel falling from the sky with her Greatsword glowing with holy magic.

As Zaleria was watching, she took the time to use her jaw and pull the necrotic spear shoved into her shoulder. Her heart was beating faster and faster, nothing was more dangerous than an injured dragon.

Even if dragons could survive with their head chopped off, their bodies would still react violently to major wounds. If something was strong enough to injure a dragon it could probably kill it.

Zaleria anchored herself to the ground with her claws and started sucking the heat from the surrounding area. The temperature quickly dropped as the acid rain turned into hail. Zaleria’s body glowed red and then blue, after a while her chest was ashen white from the heat collecting inside.

In that short time, one of Mei’s soldiers brought MP potions to Chad. The man stood back up after being juiced up.

Chad took a running stance and took a deep breath, He could sense the location of Morena’s phylactery as he punched her with [Banishing Smite]

“Let’s put an end to this!” Chad smiled as he started running.
