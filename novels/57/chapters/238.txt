They finished the bath right when Selena finished telling her story. “What happened to Rahana?” Asked Cain. He has not seen any cat girl in the bandit camp.

Selena waved her tail, “I don’t know, haven’t seen or smelled her since we were separated.” Her ears dropped.

“They must have sold her before I came. We might be able to meet her again in the future.” Said Cain. He did not know that he already killed her in the camp.

Selena stood up, “Let’s head back, they might be getting worried.” She said. Cain stared at her back. “Yeah, we best get back.” He sounded a bit sad.

After changing clothes, they got out.

The rain had stopped outside and the sun was shining down. “Come closer, I will teleport us back to the village.” Said Cain.

Selena hugged his side tightly. She disliked the feeling of getting teleported.

Cain and Selena appeared directly in front of her house. Her father was sitting at the door waiting for them. “What took you so long?” He asked.

“Well…” Selena struggled to find an answer.

“She was covered in blood so I had her take a bath. It will be bad if she caught a cold.” Cain replied without hesitation.

“It was raining. On top of that, how can you let her take a bath in the middle of the forest?” Seith asked.

“In the middle of the forest? No, I took her to one of my houses.” Replied Cain with a confused look.

“House? I never heard of you owning a house around here.” Seith was suspicious. He knew that Cain was strong but he surely cannot pull a house from his pocket. Seith was suspicious that they were doing SOMETHING and wanted to be sure.

“It will be easier if I show you, come here.” [Lisworth’s magnificent mansion] Cain opened a door and invited Seith inside.

Selena went to check on her mother’s health.

After about an hour, Seith rushed back to Elena and Selena. “I’ve seen something amazing!” He looked as if he had seen heaven.

“What?” Elena gasped. She had never seen that look on his face.

“It was big and had hot water coming from it. I have never seen something like that in my life.” He yelled with excitement in his eyes.

“What did you do to him-nya?” Selena asked Cain who entered after Seith. She had already explained the Nya story to her mother.

“I just let use the hot bath. He was curious about it wasn’t he?” Cain had a grin on his face. The jaguar people here were used to swimming but usually, it was the cold river. They rarely got the chance to swim in hot water.

“Hot bath? You will need to boil a lot of water…”Elena said. They usually only boiled a little water and used it to wash. That process took a long time.

“Cain, Cain I ask you to create it once again-nya?” Selena asked. She wanted her mother to try it as well.

“I have an idea. You take her and the rest and use the mansion. I, your father, and Kayden will use the tower.” Cain said with a thinking face. There was not much for them to do here besides play around. The kelpies got eradicated quickly after all.

“Why not? That seems more fun than just lazing around.” Zaleria said as she was standing at the door.

[Create water] Cain splashed her in the face.

“W-what…BLeh! St-stop!” She struggled to breathe as Cain kept a steady stream on her face.

“You should have heard the kelpies before they appeared, why didn’t you say anything?” Cain asked her as he increased the stream power.

“I-I said…BLeh! Stop it!” She used her flames to counter Cain’s water. “I was about to intervene, I certainly didn’t think they weren’t a threat.” Zaleria gasped for air.

“Next time tell me when you spot something,” Cain said as stood up. When he looked around, Both Elena and Seith were a bit scared.

It was the first time they saw a red dragon, and more, a human was treating her like that. They feared she might snap and blow everything up.

“Cain is right-nya. You have the strongest senses of us so use them-nya!” Even Selena joined him.

“Selena, go call the other girls. I will go with your father to find Kayden.

Kayden was sleeping merrily on Lily’s lap, the moment he sensed Cain’s magic he woke up. “What is it?” Kayden asked.

“We’re taking a bath, Care to join?” Cain asked.

“No thanks,” Kayden replied instantly and went back to sleep. “Hehe, I don’t think he will be moving anytime soon. He hates to wake up when he finds a comfortable spot.” Lily said with a wry smile.

“Fine by me, I expected that and just wanted to invite him,” Cain replied as he left the room with Seith, Sadly Kayden wasn’t joining them. Lily also won’t be joining the girls as she is busy being Kayden’s pillow.

…After a while, in the woman’s bath…

“One, two, three, four, five with Selena?” Elena said as she looked around and counted the girls. Gracie was standing out in her baggy clothes.

“Don’t count me in. I’m just Sofia’s grandma.” Zaleria waved her hand as she dipped herself in hot water. “It’s a bit cold…” She mumbled.

“You’re a dragon so…is she a one as well?” Elena started at Sofia. “No…I’m still a human. Even though I intended to push my strength further.” Sofia replied as she sat beside Zaleria. She had already learned from Cain that she could evolve into a half-dragon, a Dragonborn, or a Dragonoid when reaching level 20.

When Elena looked at Alice, she spoke immediately. “I’m just a human healer. We’ve been in Selena’s care a lot…” Alice managed to dodge any possible question that could lead to revealing that she was a devil. Even if it was Selena’s mother, it was unwise to reveal that she is a devil.

“And I’m Gracie. I work as their maid.” Gracie spoke after Alice stared at her. They have already done the introductions before and Elena was just trying to find a topic they can talk about.

“You look exactly like Selena, except that she is a bit taller and wider,” Sofia said. Now that she looked at them, Selena resembled her mother a lot. They share a similar face, and eyes. They even have the same mole on their chests.

“You might not believe it, but she was smaller than me before she left. I was surprised when I saw how big she grew in a few months.” Elena said as she pinched Selena’s arm.

“What were you feeding her to make her this big?” Elena asked with a puzzled face.

“It was you who told me to eat meat to put on more meat-nya!” Selena exclaimed, she thought it was obvious as they mostly eat only meat.

What Selena didn’t know was that her stats have changed dramatically since the last time she was at home.

She was then a merely level 2 at the time with those stats.

———————————————-

———————————————-

Her physical body reflected her stats and that is why she looks bigger now. Her bones have grown denser and her muscles have grown harder and stronger. She might have become an inch or two taller as well.

With her current stats, Selena was a contender, if not the stronger black Jaguar in the village.

“If you call her brawny then look at me!” Zaleria said as she flexed her body. She was built differently, her human form barely managed to copy the outer shell of a human. Now that she flexed her muscles in front of them, her draconic anatomy was as clear as the day.

She didn’t have a six-pack, a four-pack and or an eight-pack. She had an 18-pack. A 3 by 6 formation on her stomach with no belly button as she was born from an egg. Under her chest, she had a second row of muscles that were there to power her draconic wings. Even her arms and legs looked weird with how the muscles tied around them.

She had the anatomy of a dragon with 30 strength, a true monster. Comparing Zaleria with Selena was like comparing a seasoned bodybuilder with a child. Even though Selena was muscular enough when flexing.

“Grandma, you’re a dragon after all. Don’t compare yourself to us, humans.” Sofia said with an exhausted face.

Zaleria quickly relaxed her muscles and started to look like a beauty again.

“Soon enough you will be like me, just wait.” Said Zaleria with a pout that didn’t match her age.

After the bath, and per Cain’s advice. Selena spent the night with her family since they were going to leave in the morning. It might be a couple of weeks before they can see each other.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

As it seems, the S-rank dungeon core can only support two doors at max now. That was the reason Morena only linked Furberg’s outskirt with Ourals and didn’t create a third door to flank them. If Cain wanted to be able to open more doors to his maze, he needs to start feeding the maze more dungeon cores and enchanting the full structure.

…

The next morning, and after saying goodbye. They headed straight to the Fenrir village to discover what was going on.
