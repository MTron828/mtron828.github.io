From behind the door, two maids emerged. “My lady, we’re ready if you are.” They said at the same time.

Marina rushed at them with a panicked face. “I told you to not get permission from me but him.” Marina tried her hardest not to yell. If Cain was the house master then them getting permission from her was an insult.

The two maids looked at Cain and said with a straight face, “He’s smiling, we bet he doesn’t care.” They said the same line at the same time.

“They are right so calm down a bit.” Cain touched her shoulder.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“But even so, they need to show some respect to you. I might have chosen the wrong support maids.” She said with a sad face.

“No, they are probably the best you could get. They know the first rule of such moments.” Cain looked at them.

“You mustn’t have anything on your mind, worrying about unnecessary things would just dampen the mood further.” The maids said at the same time which started to scare Cain a bit.

“Why do you keep talking together like that?” Cain asked them.

“We used to hang out together since we were children, we grew up, studied, and worked together. After over twenty years we became to know each other well so we almost have the same mindset.” They said at the same time again.

“It would have been perfect if you were a twin, but this proves that being raised the same can make people similar,” Cain said with a thinking face.

“We don’t know that. We were taken as little girls after our orphanage went in flames.” They took a short pause before continuing.

“So you’re saying that the environment decides how the person will be when they grow?” The maids stared at him.

“Pretty much, but not all the time. I see you two didn’t grow the same.” Cain thought about how Alice who had the soul of a devil grew into a human..

The two maids looked at each other and realized what Cain was talking about. One of them had a bigger chest than the other.

“Should we start master? You seem eager.” The maids said and Marina’s face flushed red.

Cain smiled as he clapped his hands, “This should isolate the room, no one will hear, see or feel us now.” Cain used a combination of [Soundless] [Invisibility] and [Sylph’s Private Sanctum]

Cain then magically locked the door and headed toward the bed, “How should we go about it?” He didn’t want to rush Marina as this was probably her first time.

Marina seemed just as confused as him, it was then when the maids approached.

“Master, please allow us to take the lead at the start, it’s our job to make sure everything happens smoothly.” The two maids said at the same time.

“Well then. Do what you see fit.” Cain sat on the bed.

The two maids bowed to him and then bowed to Marina, “My lady, we’re starting.” One of them approached Cain while the other approached Marina.

The two maids stripped both of them quickly.

As the maid took Cain’s pants off she gasped, “It’s this big?”

“I can make it smaller if you want.” Cain looked at her. That was possible with a bit of magic.

“No that’s not what I meant, please ignore my earlier comment.” As she turned toward Marina, the maid said, “My lady, please come here.”

Hearing that, the other maid dragged Marina toward Cain. “Can you put it in your mouth?” the maid asked. “We want you to be first.” They said.

“I don’t think I can,” Marina said what she thought. Sofia said that she could take it all in her mouth, which was inhuman.

The maid grabbed Marina’s head, “Sorry my lady, it’s your order to force even if you hesitated.” She started pushing her toward Cain.

“Fine, fine, I will do it on my own.” But just before Marina could start, Cain grabbed her shoulder and pulled her up to his face.

“You started with this.” He said going for a deep kiss. Marina struggled for a moment before giving up, she knew beforehand as Alice told her but she forgot.

When Cain released her, she rushed back at him with a kiss of her own. She awaited him for so long and now he was there with her.

The maids smiled as they saw Marina pull back from her courageous attempt.

Marina then slowly went down and started, the head was all she could take.

“Master, are we allowed to…” The two maids stared at Cain.

“Of course,” He gave each of them a strong kiss, as long as they were after Marina, it was allowed.

As the maids saw Marina struggle, they started acting right away.

One of them pulled her away, “My lady, let this to us, we need to get you ready or it will hurt.” One of the maids pushed a finger inside Marina, started twirling it, and grabbed her chest with the other hand.

The other maid took Cain in her mouth and started going at it. Unlike Marina, she was able to take half of it in. Feeling a bit frustrated with herself, the maid grabbed Cain’s hips and used her arms to force him inside her mouth to the base.

That didn’t last as she started coughing, “Sorry master, it seems it’s beyond my limits.” She said with a sad face but Cain patted her head. “It’s fine.”

“The lady is ready, please come close.” The maid forced Marina’s shaking legs apart. “Please calm down my lady.” The maid told her.

“They are shaking on their own!” Marina replied with a shaking voice, she was having a weird feeling that she wasn’t sure of.

“It may sting a bit so hold tight, it will get better quickly.” The other maid said as she aligned Cain to the entrance.

Cain started pushing in slowly, it went in rather easily. That was probably thanks to the maid loosening Marina earlier.

“That’s a bit much, Master would you mind pulling out?” The other maid said as she saw a bit too much blood. She rushed and brought the towel and water they prepared earlier.

One of the maids started cleaning Marina while the other cleaned Cain. After making everything clean, the maid looked at Cain, “Please start slowly, she needs some time to adjust.”

Cain grabbed Marina’s hands as he gave her a second kiss, slowly moving inside, she quickly locked her legs around him.

The maid watched them until Cain emptied the first load.

Marina looked exhausted with the sweat dripping from her forehead, her legs were shaking as her stomach contracted.

The maids immediately noticed that Cain didn’t have a drop of sweat on him, this far below what he could take. Marina alone clearly could not satisfy him.

One of the maids started cleaning Marina with a towel while the other tended to Cain. She didn’t even bother cleaning him and took him into her mouth immediately, she needed to strike the iron while it was still hot. ‘Our chances are low if he wasn’t satisfied.’ She thought in her heart.

The maid quickly took off her uniform while she was servicing Cain, no matter how hard she went, she could not feel him getting exhausted.

‘My mouth isn’t enough’ She laid on her back and spread her legs apart. “Master, please fill me in!”

Hearing her words, Cain went in immediately, Marina needed to rest after all.

Unlike Marina who was trying to not moan loudly, the maid was wheezing. She suddenly started licking Cain’s chest and said “Please go harder.” As per her request, he went a bit harder but not all out.

As Cain emptied a load in her, Marina was still out so he went to the second maid who happily took him in as well.

Marina woke up again as Cain was about to finish with the second maid and got her second round. As expected, this was her limit, after taking a second load she lifted the white flag, her insides were already hurting.

Cain lay on the bed with Marina on his arm, the maids sat at his feet staring at each other and exchanging signs. Then one of them spoke.

“Master, Can we say something?”

Cain looked at her, “You can say as much as you want.”

“We will do anything, just hear this request from us.” The other maid said with a worried face.

“I’m listening,” Cain said with a smile.

The two maids looked at each other’s and bowed immediately, “Master, My lady, we beg of you to order the ruined orphanage to be built again.” Straight to the point.

“Ruined orphanage? The one you lived in twenty years ago?” Marina asked with a puzzled face.

“Yes, we know it’s not our place to speak in such things, but please.” The maid looked at Cain and Marina.

“Why not? I don’t think it will be that hard, what do you think?” Cain looked at Marina.

“That was a large building, and I want to save money for the spring…” Marina said with a sad face.

The maids’ faces were about to break when Cain smiled, “I will provide the funds. Order it to be built.”

“As you say then,” Marina smiled.

As if the sun blessed the maids’ faces, the glittering in their faces was unimaginable.

“Thank you, master, please accepted our gratitude and…”

“Please stop, we needed to build one anyway before the next winter.” Cain said with a smile, “Turn the lights off, we’re sleeping.” The maids happily complied with his orders and jumped to the bed with them.

Unlike Marina who was already too sore, the maids kept rubbing themselves on him so he gave them another round.

With that, the morning quickly came.
