“Would you two mind backing down? He might be weak, but there is no telling what master might do in his condition.” Sylph said with a sweet voice as she kept Cain locked in her embrace.

“Who are you? What do you think you’re doing to my son?” Chad yelled rushing at her, this time he pulled his sword.

“Trying to help him regain his sanity, you should stay back Chad!” Sylph replied. She wasn’t going to act rudely toward Cain’s father. With a snap of her fingers, Chad got locked in a cage of ancient wood.

“What is this?”

“Roots from the world tree, you can’t break it easily!” Sylph smiled.

Zaleria remembered Sylph, she was the elf woman she saw when she touched Cain’s slave link. She could tell that Sylph wasn’t something they hoped to defeat. Zaleria could tell, that Sylph stood leagues above the earth dragon they faced.

“Who are you?” Zaleria asked, this was a chance to gather information since she seemed willing to speak.

“Sylph Zylphyra, Master Cain’s first slave and last standing ally. Oops, he is about to explode!” Sylph suddenly threw Cain away with a passive face and locked Zaleria in a cage just like Chad.

[Dark Star] [Dark Star] [Dark Star] [Dark Star]…Multiple small black holes appeared around Cain.

“I see three hearts and two brains. You’re an abomination after all. The mad soul is jumping between the brains, each time using one of them to control the body and magic.” Sylph licked her fingers, “If I destroyed the brain the mad soul was using several times I can force it to shut down temporarily. I would say that would give Master enough time to wake up”

GRWAAAA! Cain screamed as he launched all of the black holes at her. Sylph gently lifted her hand wooden vines extended from her forearm, and created a wooden sword in her hand.

Thud! With a single swing, her blade seemed to jerk to life like a snake, quickly striking the black holes down. “You need to put more magic in it if you want to hit me.” Sylph smiled as she disappeared.

“This is one!” Sylph appeared behind Cain and pierced his torso with her arm. His body flew away and landed on a stone in the distance.

Cain’s mad soul was using the lower brain at the moment of Sylph’s attack so it was damaged from her hit. The damage wasn’t from the physical attack but because of the sudden shutdown, it had been due to brain damage.

CRACKLE! Cain’s body quickly regenerated with [Regenerate] and he stood back up. GRWAAAAAAAAAAA!

Sylph held her blade forward with a relaxed stance.

Cain teleported right to her side and blasted her with an [Elemental burst]

As Sylph was sent flying, Cain swung his arm, and a spear formed from the ground. [Enchant explosion] the spear flew quickly behind Sylph.

“You can do such a thing at your low level?” Sylph smiled as she conjured a massive tree to block the spear [Tree over growth]

CLICK! Landing back on her feet, Sylph pointed her blade toward Cain [Flower garden]

The ground around Cain got covered in flowers that exhaled a sleeping toxin at him.

[Sylph’s tiny hut] Cain neutralized the magical effect of the poison immediately.

“Using my magic against me, how rude!” Sylph smiled and the tiny hut that Cain conjured exploded at him. She was the one who created that spell and destroying it was simple enough in her eyes.

Sylph quickly flew toward him flourishing her blade, she was keeping an eye on the pulsation of strange magic coming from him. That pulsation was coming directly from the mad soul, it’s the dragon’s trump card against the gods. It did not affect mortals but it severely weakens gods by cutting their connection to the portfolio.

A portfolio is what a god is known with. the god of death has the portfolio of death for example. He gains sustenance from the death of mortals. That magic will prevent him from gaining sustenance or using his death-controlling abilities effectively.

Sylph was using those waves to determine the exact location of the mad soul and strike with precision. If she made a single mistake and hit the wrong brain, she will cripple Cain instead.

Cain wasn’t making it easy as he started masking the waves with his magic. Slowly but surely he was getting better and better at mimicking the waves.

Sylph found herself smiling, even though his base stats were abysmally low. Even though he was partially insane, his skills and expertise with magic and enchanting were still as sharp as in his prime. The moment he touches her blade, he will enchant it with [Elf bane] it is a special magic that is lethal to elves and she had to resist it.

“This is it Master, harder, stronger, quicker! Don’t stop, don’t slow down. You’re slowly getting back to your prime!” Sylph found an opportunity and smashed Cain’s head.

Cain’s body fell twitching, “Come on, I know this isn’t enough to kill you!” Sylph smiled with her body shivering.

[Regeneration] Cain regrew his head and opened his mouth, a red flash came gushing out and engulfed Sylph. A red dragon breathes.

“You can use it already? I didn’t expect to see that!” Sylph coughed smoke as the wood she used to protect herself burned. “But it’s still weak, I say barely as strong as an adult red.”

Sylph suddenly stabbed Cain’s torso. “And another Chance, how many times do I need to stab you before you shut down? I pretty much prefer him stabbing me.” Sylph smiled.

Rumble! She heard an ominous voice coming from the sky, when she looked up, two meteors were falling side by side.

“That’s bad…If it was real. You won’t fool me, you never charged a ninth-tier spell.” Sylph stabbed Cain’s head again and the meteors disappeared. They were but an illusion created by Cain to trick her to move away from him.

“Magic indeed relies on intelligence, but using high-tier spells requires a strong body with an especially high constitution to concentrate and tank the recoil of the casting. With how low your constitution is, it’s basically impossible for you to cast two ninth-tier offensive spells at the same time.” Sylph quickly remembered Cain’s notes from his past life.

10~20 1 ninth-tier spell

20~30 2 ninth-tier spell

30~40 3 ninth-tier spell

40~50 4 ninth-tier spell

50~60 5 ninth-tier spell

60~70 6 ninth-tier spell

70~80 7 ninth-tier spell

80~90 8 ninth-tier spell

90~100 9 ninth-tier spell

100 allow you to cast 10 spells, all of which are per brain that an organism can use.

Sylph was quite lucky since the mad soul seemed to only be able to occupy a single brain. The dragon king optimized for dragons he didn’t count on them having more than one.

…

“She is toying with him, I can barely see her movements, and it’s hard to predict the movements of those trees she conjures,” Chad said as he observed the fight.

“I know, you don’t have dragon’s eyes and true sight so you can’t tell. But that woman is holding back, a lot. Just under her skin, there is an endless well of magic and power that shouldn’t be possessed by a mere mortal.” Zaleria said.

“What do you mean?” Chad stared at her.

“Yggdrasil, the world tree. The first planet to ever sprout and the last living being that will stay in the multiverse. Older than the gods and bigger than the world. The myth said that it was planted by the hands of a primordial being who wanted to kick start life.” Zaleria recited what she read in her father’s library, most were from ancient books that speculated the origin of the world. Considering that dragons live for thousands of years, an ancient book in their words might have existed for over a million years.

“Do you really expect me to believe that?” Chad snorted.

“No, what I’m saying is that the world tree was collecting power from the start of the world. Until this day, her roots keep collecting magic from every plane of existence, and that woman there has access to that. She is the world tree herald!” Zaleria pointed toward Sylph.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The fight only lasted for a couple of minutes before Cain finally stopped moving, the mad soul finally shut down so Cain could slowly regain control.

Sitting on a throne of flowers and leaves, Sylph sat with Cain on her sleeping on her lap.
