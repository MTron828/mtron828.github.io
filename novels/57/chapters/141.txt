“Sorry I almost burnt the whole place.” Sofia apologized out of nowhere, Cain who was taking his shirt off turned to face her.

“Don’t worry about it, Zaleria is skilled enough to protect the whole city from flames.” Cain stated what he know trying to reassure her, “She is a witch and a fire dragon of great age, you will learn a lot from her.”

Sofia bore a sad face, “She said she was my relative, ancestor. Is my magic related to her?” Sofia lifted her hand and triggered a weak [Bonfire] and causing a small flicker of flame in her hand.

“It’s most likely. Sorcerers or witches as they are known, are naturally imbued with magic. You’re witch’s power is a result of what remnant characteristic you inherited from her.” Cain gently guided her toward the mirror, “Look, you two look similar.”

Sofia gently touched her cheek and slid her hand down to her chest to sense her heartbeats, they were fast considering she was half-naked. Cain caressed her shoulders and whispered in her ear “You can burn as many houses as you want, I will replace them later.”

Sofia’s body twitched at the feel of his warm breath, she could sense a different type of heat building up in her abdomen, “You also never use a catalyst, are you a sorcerer as well?”

She could feel his warm arms hug her from behind, “You could say I’m something similar, I use my soul as a catalyst so I can do things like this.” Lifting his finger in front of her face, a small stream of blue fire flashed the size of a candle fire.

As she saw him bring it closer to her chest, she instinctively tried to move back. Her body was stopped by his and she could feel his other hand grab her in place. “Trust me, don’t move.” He whispered again, her body shuddered at his words.

Sofia closed her eyes awaiting to feel the burning sensation on her chest, to her surprise she instead felt it sting, not burn. “See this, not even a red mark. Your affinity with fire is almost akin to that of her.” Cain whispered again as he flicked the flames out.

“The fire…so it was really me who erupted those flames?” Sofia asked with a stuttering voice, Cain felt she was pained by that and was on the verge of crying.

“Yesterday’s fire was a natural occurrence, it didn’t hurt anyone and never will.” He replied trying to reassure her. Remembering how she reacted to him killing the adventurers in the mine he expected that her main concern was not hurting others.

“No…not that. My parents…” Sofia didn’t finish and instead looked at Cain’s reflection in the mirror. His head was resting on her bare shoulder with his glowing blue eyes looking at her straight from the mirror.

Cain pieced out what she wanted to say and tried to confirm his suspicions, speaking without base might increase her worries instead. “What happened, would mind telling me?” His hands gently caressed her body and dragged her to the bed when he sat her on his lap, “I’m listening, go ahead.” His gentle whispers in her ears helped her relax a bit and talk to him.

A couple of years ago, on a fateful night. Sofia woke up in the middle of the night to a raging flame, her whole house was on fire. She couldn’t remember much of what happened after she woke up as she immediately passed out as the smoke suffocated her.

Later when she woke up at the nearby church she discovered that she was the sole survivor. Her mother died when a burning wooden beam fell on her. Her father survived the initial flame and managed to get her half-burned little sister out and dove right back in to get Sofia but he didn’t survive that time. She was later rescued by a mage who managed to put the flame out with water magic.

When she thought that her little sister might have survived, the news came in that she had just passed away due to her burns.

“Was it me who started that fire?” She asked with tearing eyes.

Cain had a lot more questions to ask but keeping her calm and assuring her it was not her fault takes priority. “There is no way it was you, you can’t suddenly start ejecting flames in your sleep when you can’t even cast spells. I bet it was something else.” Cain smiled and hugged her tightly. He was lying, she still has told him when or how did she learn the [Fireball] spell, it was most likely that she did indeed start that fire.

“Are you…” She looked at him with wistful eyes. Cain immediately wanted to change the subject, it wasn’t something pleasant to talk about and anything else would be better. He immediately stopped her mid-sentence with a deep kiss.

Her body shivered at his sudden advance. feeling a new heat build inside her already burning body. “Your body is really warm, your smell is driving me crazy!” He whispered in her ear and bite it. Her thighs twitched as she let out a soft moan, she could feel his hand slowly sliding inside her underwear and delicately tickling her.

“Ahh! Cain that’s…” She tried to grab his hand that slid inside her but she didn’t have enough strength to pull it out. “Relax, relax, take your hands off…” Feeling his grip tighten around her like a cozy blanket she slowly relaxed her hands. She could feel his hardness throbbing under her.

Cain turned her face to the side and started licking her lips, “I told you to relax, slowly relax your legs.” She slowly surrendered her body to the pleasure. Cain’s hand was going mental under her to the point she reached the point of no return.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“AHH!” She moaned quietly as her body twitched, “You’re quite sensitive, look at how much mess did you make.” Cain took out his wet finger and laid her on the bed. Gently and with all his care, he took what remained of her clothes off and took his own as well.

Sofia looked longingly at him when they heard knocking at the door, “Master, I brought what you requested!” It was Gracie calling from outside the door.

“Leave it out…” Sofia was about to respond when Cain interrupted her. “Come in.”

At Cain’s words, Gracie opened the door and entered immediately with a tray holding three cups, two filled with tea and the last one empty.

“Cain but!” Sofia gasped at him with her face beet-red, in his eyes her embarrassed face looked kinda cute.

“Come on, you have to get used to her.” Cain smiled at Sofia and pulled her toward him. “I’m quite dry, would mind getting me prepared first?” He told Sofia who was still panicking.

“Gracie, if you finished them leave quickly!” Sofia cried, quickly getting her face away from Cain’s meat.

“Don’t to? What about you?” Cain looked at Gracie who was looking at them, She immediately played along kneeling on the ground.

“Anywhere and anytime you wish!” Hearing Gracie reply Sofia panicked and quickly jumped between her and Cain putting his meat in her mouth.

“Sorry, she seems to have found her courage.” Cain apologized to Gracie, “It was probably for the best to not have you do it, with your drool, I would probably end up pushing you down immediately anyway. We don’t want that right?”

Gracie just nodded and walked toward the try, “Can I fill it up now?” She asked holding the empty cup. “Go ahead,” Cain told her as he kept his hands firm on Sofia’s head, feeling her throat twitch.

Gracie slowly filled the cup with drool and put it back down. “Lady Sofia, please treat me like the other two, don’t mind my existence.” Sofia didn’t quite understand what Gracie said as she was busy dealing with what was in her mouth.

“This is all, you can leave now.” Per Cain’s words, Gracie left with a bow. He then looked down at Sofia.

“Alice is comfortable with Gracie and Selena doesn’t care, can you try getting used to her as well?” Cain patted Sofia’s head and she gently bit him.

“But it’s embarrassing!” She said as she stopped. Looking at her face, “Lay on the bed.” Cain asked her and she complied immediately spreading her legs.

“Please be gentle with me…”
