Cain looked in front of him. Zaleria’s back wasn’t that big. It looked quite fragile and tender, with no sign of it belonging to an ancient monster who could ravage the whole city.

“Who’s next!” Cain immediately stopped the girl chapter as it was starting to get to his head. He wasn’t able to handle listening to them talk like this any longer. As Zaleria stood, Sofia came in her place, then Alice, then Selena, and Lastly Mary. Of course, Gracie didn’t join, she wasn’t going to show her back.

‘I can swear I only have 15 charisma, why do I’m resembling him more?’ Cain sighed, a visible frown on his face.

“Are you alright?” Alice asked as she immediately picked up on his worry. “You could always talk to us, we promised to listen to you after all.” She added.

“She is right, we can always give a hand if you need one.” Sofia said and then Selena followed her “They are right-nya!”

Zaleria only shifted her face toward him, she was worried that her charisma might have gotten a bit out of control. It was true that he was somehow able to resist it, but that didn’t mean he can resist it all the time. She might have caused this sudden shift in his mode.

“I was just thinking I’m resembling my father more, It’s not something I’m happy about.” He said, Sofia’s eyes twisted in worry.

“Your parents? I wonder what kind of people gave birth to someone like you, would you mind telling us about them?” Zaleria jumped immediately, Cain’s skills and magic were abnormal to the point she was interested in what kind of people were his parents.

“Don’t ask like that!” Sofia screamed. “She is right!” Alice added.

Mary’s face twisted into a frown, she had heard of Cain’s parents before. They should be…

“It will be a long story,” Cain said, looking at them. He didn’t mind sharing that story.

“We’re relaxing, we have all the time,” Zaleria said.

Cain started telling the story he knew, making sure to keep it as short as possible.

It all started when a man was born to a traveling merchant. The baby was named Chad, and he was weird. Both his eyes and Hair were darker than coal with almond skin and a deep voice.

The kid walked at half a year old and spoke at one. His body steadily grew stronger and stronger as he aged. People were weirdly attracted to him, strangers will ask to hold him and women will fight to get a kiss on his cheek. His parent thought that their kid was just that cute, he was like a year and a half at that time.

At the age of four, his beard started to grow. His parent panicked and took him to the church for inspection, when the priest asked him if he felt anything wrong the kid replied. “I feel like I won’t get anything from you.” And left without elaborating further.

It was later revealed that the church there was scamming people by pretending to be able to heal what it can’t. After hearing that, and since they had already accepted that their kid has a beard at four years they took him to the adventure guild to check his stats. If he managed to sniff out the scam at the church he might have high wisdom or Intelligence which can help him inherit his father’s trade.

When they saw his stats, everything made sense. They were honestly absurd that the guild even considered that their orb was broken.

By the time the guild brought their second orb, Chad has already got out of the guild leaving his parent there. Later that year, He asked his parents if he could travel the world. Of course they said no, so he replied. “Well, It’s shame.” Quickly giving up.

When he reached the age of fourteen he finally joined the adventure guild by sweet talking one of the receptionist into making him a guild card. “She was such a sweet girl.” was how he described her.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

At that time he was finally able to fulfill his dream of exploring the world. He picked up a sword and took the path of a warrior saying that men should fight with their arms.

With how great his talent were he quickly realized the horrific implication of his stats. Using his high charisma to persuade female adventure to guide him through the dangerous life, he quickly leveled up. When he was satisfied with his strength at level 8 he dropped from the guild and bought a horse riding into the distance.

With how high his charisma was, at each town he stopped at he had a least a woman fall for him. From that day on that mans life has turned into a long journey where he enjoyed traveling and being a tourist in general.

After several years, that man’s travel have led him to a city named Furberg as he heard they had the finest bread in the whole kingdom. In that city, and as he does always, instead of staying in a normal inn, he spend his whole nights in brothels. It was a measure since his charisma can go out of control when he was sleeping so it was better to be in such a place where he wouldn’t a regular woman involved. He sometimes woke up to a woman in his bed when he spent night in inns.

After staying for about a weak he quickly left, what that man didn’t know about that one of the woman he met in the city has gotten pregnant from a night they spent it together. That woman had pure long white hair and sky blue eyes, even though her body was weak and frail she always had that sharp look in her eyes.

When her kid was born she quickly went to the guild to apprise him, she had her suspicions that she forgot to use [Cleansing] that night but she wasn’t sure. That was the nature of her like of work.

Cain was that man’s child, and his mother found herself in trouble. Now that she has to retire after having a kid. And the father was nowhere to be found, he was a traveler after all.

She quickly found a job as a waitress in the city bath. The Owner lady there had even allowed her to reside in her home. Things seemed to progress well for about a year but she quickly started to get sick.

She was aware of her weak body and working in such a an environment made her condition worse. She was slowly finding it hard to breath, since the bath was hot and the outside was cold. She other got cold which only made her health spiral down.

When Cain was about a year and half, she found herself on on her death bed. For some reason her body seemed to not be able to resist diseases that well.

At the end, she managed to entrust her only child to two adventures who she knew well. They were regulars at the bath and the guy a regular at her old job when he was younger. She wanted to used that to persuade him to accept, to her surprise, the mans wife made the initiative to offer taking care of Cain after her passing.

A few weeks later she stopped breathing in the middle of the night and was dead when they found her at the morning. Cain was taken by those two adventures.

Past forward seventeen year later. Those two adventures went on a quest too far above their skill and died together leaving Cain who was just shy of nineteen year old. After spending a year honing his skills (In reality he was just swinging his sword blindly but Cain made it seems as if he was learning magic so it would make more sense) Cain joined the adventure guild and became who they know now.

“So I’m worried that I will resemble my father.” Cain said, with a sad look on his face.

“But he didn’t know right?” Alice asked trying to consult Cain. “I still don’t understand-nya. In what way do you resemble him-nay?” Selena interfered.

“Mother wasn’t the only woman, that man had multiple women scattered across the whole continent, I might have a hundred sibling and not know it. Seeing that I’m surrounded by you lot I fear that one day I might leave like my father did to mother. I fear to become someone like him.” Cain closed his eyes. He had met his father in his past like and the man did seem to care. What scarred him more is that his father hardly managed to remember his mother from how many women he got with.

“I don’t think you resemble him a bit, unlike him, you’re holding tight to them.” Zaleria said looking at Sofia, Alice and Selena. “If you dare leave my granddaughter in the future I will personally hammer you into shape!”

“Grandmother is right, you don’t have to worry about that!” Sofia said, “Right Gracie, you have a striker mind so tell us what do you think!” Since Gracie only talked with what she think is right, her words carried a strange weight as she will speak facts even if they were unpleasant.

“You do resemble him with how much woman are around you,” Gracie stopped to take a breath and Cain’s face tensed up. “But you took them all, that what makes you different than him!”

Cain looked around him, All the girls smiled at him. That had warmed his heart.
