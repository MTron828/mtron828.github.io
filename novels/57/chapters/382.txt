“Don’t get carried away human!” The aboleth growled as he used his tentacles to grab into the water and pull himself away from Cain. [Psychic blast] The aboleth generated a white ball of energy, it was made from a reversed wave to Cain’s telekinesis. His goal was to have Cain attract it like a magnet.

Cain quickly swung a fit at the ball deflecting it as if it was nothing, “Just the reverse? Aren’t you making it a bit simple?”

Hearing Cain’s words the Aboleth growled and started firing more spells, Flames spears, lightning bolts, and even Gravity sinkholes. But Cain is familiar with all those spells, he faced them countless times and studied them for endless hours. Deflecting or dodging them was as easy as dodging a pebble thrown by a kid.

The Aboleth quickly realized that he can’t beat win in a magic fight, Cain was simply a far more experienced mage than him. It was better to resort to physical attacks instead.

“Come down here!” The Aboleth Grabbed Cain from his leg and tried to drag him into the water.

THUD! THUD! The aboleth felt something on one of his tentacles. It was moving too fast. When He looked, it was a cat girl running on them with her claws.

Selena swam toward one of the tentacles even though she hated salt water, she then grabbed into them and is using her feet claws to run without falling.

The aboleth pulled his tentacle, violently swinging it around but Selena kept running. She was like an ant that will never fall off no matter how much you shake it.

“GAW!” She swung a claw at one of his eyes the moment she reached it. The same trick they used for the earth dragon, she kept note for it. If it’s big, go for the eyes.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Cain took the chance and sliced one of Aboleth’s tentacles. He was fighting but that won’t last long, he will run off Mana soon as he used a lot today.

Swoosh! Sofia flew above the monster and breathed down at it. As the red light flash, some could mistake her for an actual dragon from the sheer power she was emitting. Even Zaleria couldn’t deny it, Sofia is slowly approaching the level of an Adult dragon.

The aboleth quickly splashed water on his body, the fire burned most of his upper skin. Yet there was another problem, he was having some weird stomach pain as if he had swallowed something sharp.

Gracie used the shadows to teleport inside the monster’s stomach and started cutting, slowly butchering the monster from the inside.

In the background, a small boat with Mary and Hati entered the whirlpool and was being dragged toward the center.

“Excuse me!” Alice wasn’t able to use her devil wings to fly since all the soldiers were watching. She teleported to Cain’s back and latched to him. Piggyback, that was her only solution.

“You’re kind of heavy!” Cain growled, but when looked behind, she was pouting while wearing full-plate armor.

“It’s the armor!” She cried. “Why the hell did you wear it?” And Cain cried back, he didn’t care about her weight. What annoyed his is that a metal plate was drilling into his back. It wasn’t the most comfortable thing to carry someone wearing plate armor on your back.

“Some pirates showed up and we thought they wanted to attack us, but they instead started attacking the Krakens,” Alice replied.

Cain looked toward the pirate ship and quickly recognized her, “What is she doing there?” He growled.

At that moment, he felt his Mana fade…Sofia started absorbing his Mana and she was using it a lot.

“Sofia…” As he was about to yell, the Mana he was preserving ended and his conciseness started to fade. As an abomination, he should be able to resist with two brains, but he had exhausted himself a lot with the earlier spells that he wasn’t able to hold.

The Aboleth took the chance to smack them toward the Hell Gate at the whirlpool center.

Feeling that Cain’s magic disappeared and seeing him fall toward the Hell Gate. Chad, Ariel, Farryn, and Hati all leaped as fast as they could to grab him. Chad, Farryn, and Hati all failed because they lacked enough ground support from their ships. Ariel also failed as she wasn’t able to approach the Hell Gate and got repelled.

In the end, the only one who was able to grab Cain and Alice before they fell into the Hell Gate, was Mary who drove the small boat into the gate without being noticed.

The three of them got sucked into Hell.

The gate was still open so they should be able to walk out easily.

…

Cain could severe headache, “I gave it to her, and soon I won’t be able to hold him off so train her well…” Cain heard the voice of a man ringing inside his head.

“Lady Morena, we found the girl.” A bunch of imps said as they dragged the unconscious Alice and threw her in a cell.

“Now leave and guard the door, I will take care of him,” Morena said as rode the unconscious Cain. “Such excellent blood, both you and your father. I wonder what makes you that way!” She smiled, but then soon after the gigantic steel door started opening.

“I told you to stand guard at the door!” Morena screamed. Those imps dared disobey her orders… But what entered was no imp, it was Mary.

“Finally found them!” Mary smiled.

“Who are you? Where are the guards?” Morena growled this was Hell, how could this human woman just stand there? She thought humans get turned into worms here.

Mary didn’t bother to reply as she approached Morena and Cain…”I do need to keep him safe and healthy, mind to move away?” Mary smiled again.

…

After about an hour after falling inside the Hell Gate, Mary walked out with the unconscious Cain and Alice at her shoulders.

The pirate ship quickly approached the Gate and reeled them in, Mary’s feet were all burned up with fire and acid from hell. The pirates were surprised she was just tearing up and not wailing in pain.

“How did you get out?” Farryn asked with a piercing glare, how a human girl could survive hell for an hour.

“We fell down a hill and I had to climb up with them…” Mary cried, “What was that place…I felt my stomach turn and I could barely stand!” Mary finally broke down crying and wailing in pain. Even Farryn thought it wasn’t the time to ask her for details. They must have fallen into an abandoned place in hell so they weren’t attacked by devils, and she didn’t turn into a worm because she went through the gate and didn’t die.

The other seems to have killed the Aboleth, as soon as Chad and Farryn got to him, they cut him to shreds.

“Just calm down, let me heal you.” Farryn cast [Cure wounds] on Mary’s feet. “You did my job so this is the least I can do, just rest for now.”

Farryn had been ordered to save and protect Cain with her life by Sylph. Now, this weak human girl had done her job, and not even that, she dragged Cain out of hell alone. This feat alone was enough to earn her the respect of this highly proud elf.

In the background, the Pirates fired a grill and started cooking the Aboleth’s meat on the ship. Even the soldiers have joined them.

“Jack! Steer the ship toward the fleet and let head to shore.” Farryn yelled.

Jack smiled and leaped toward the wheel. “Don’t order the captain around, He already knew what to do,” Jack replied, even though he was the ship’s Captain.

The fleet captain looked at Jack sailing the pirate ship with them and then looked at the cooked Kraken and Aboleth meat. “That’s gotta be the best pirate I’ve ever seen.”
