Cain sighed, this was unacceptable, is what the girls should think not just send him in.

“Fine let’s go, but I will blast anyone who tries anything funny,” Cain said with an exhausted face, this is his marriage night and he is spending a bath with other women.

“I’ll go then and tell the others!” Klara said with a smile as she rushed toward the bath.

“I-I’ll go and fetch my clothes.” Diana tried to rush as well but she tripped again, this time she was lucky Cain caught her with [Telekinesis]

“Can you calm down a bit? You’re always in a hurry.” Said Cain as he helped her back up.

“Sorry…”

“Don’t apologize, just walk with confidence. Tripping twice a day is abnormal.” He glared at her.

Diana was too clumsy, the moment something was on her mind, she forget herself and end up tripping on her own legs.

Seeing Cain being serious only helped to increase her anxiety, but since she couldn’t do anything, she walked slowly to her room fully concentrating on her steps.

For once, she didn’t trip under stress which made her happy. From that day on she will try to focus on doing one thing at a time..

After a while, Cain opened the bath door with Diana beside him. The changing room was empty, the maids must be all inside.

Cain took a second to install a light in the ceiling, he was getting sick of candles and lanterns. They were thematic and add a great ambiance to a busy night but they were bad for lighting.

After Cain finished setting the light Diana approached him. “Let me help you undress.”

“No, this thing is pretty hard to wash up. Only my clothes are enough of a hassle to clean later, we don’t want your uniform as well.” Cain told as he leaped away from her hands.

“Fine, I will take my uniform first,” Diana said.

“That will take too long,” Cain said as he was about to start stripping on his own.

“We’re trained to be fast at…” As she started taking her uniform off, Diana tried convincing Cain to wait just for him to cut her off.

“What were you saying?” Cain said, being already naked. He teleported outside of his clothes for instant removal.

“…Wearing and taking our uniform quickly so we can get to work as fast as possible.” Diana finished her line before starting to think about what had just happened.

“Come here, I will help you.” Cain touched her forehead with his finger [Teleport] he instantly teleported her outside her clothes.

“You do that?” She stared at him.

“Well, it’s a seventh-tier spell. Most mages won’t use it for such a thing unless their robe is on fire, which happens a lot with people going crazy over fireball.” Cain looked as if he was going through a deep trauma.

‘Did someone sit him ablaze before?’ Diana though.

After that, the two of them walked toward the shower room.

Now that Cain was walking behind Diana he could see clearly, how wide she was. That thing put even Selena to shame, and he could even swear it wasn’t just fat, that thing looked to have some resistance.

“I can respect that,” Cain said.

“What are you talking about?” Diana asked. What great thing got respect from him?

“Minimizing on the upper part to maximize the lower half. I like both but I can appreciate seeing a perfected lower half.”

Diana’s face turned bright red when she realized what Cain was talking about. Didn’t he have anything else to focus on? “Please stop!” She cried.

Cain started washing the soot and ash from his body with just water first while Diana dropped a bucket full of water at her head.

“Let me help you get it out of your hair.” Seeing him struggle a bit she reached over to him.

“Thank you.” Cain thanked her she started combing his hair with her fingers and cleaning the black soot.

After a few seconds. Cain said in a sad voice. “But it’s sad, this lacking feeling.”

Diana thought he was missing the presence of his wives, or there is a problem with magic that she couldn’t feel.

“I would prefer to wash your hair instead of you washing mine,” Cain said calmly.

Diana instantly thought she was doing a bad job, “Please do tell me where the problem is.” She asked trying to keep a calm tone.

“There is nothing touching my back, I would at least touch something if you were in front of me. You ass-sets are at the back after all.” Said Cain in a serious tone.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Diana didn’t care, she grabbed the wooden bucket to her side and smacked him on the head as hard as she could. “Chose a side, weren’t you just worried about it being your marriage night?”

“Ouch! Don’t hit your master like this.” Cain cried as he turned toward her.

CRACK! She smacked him again, “And can you stoop appraising me with such a serious face.”

When Cain and Diana finally joined the other maids, He had three large bumps on his head.

The entire maid squad was there staring at him, this was the second time they saw their master naked. Most of them expected to be in his bed on their first day of work but here they are after almost two months. He had laid his hand on none of them except Gracie who was now with his wives.

When Cain looked around.

Klara was sitting in the water relaxing.]

Ellie was sitting at the edge of the water covering her neck and chest with her towel.

Amara was playing in the water and she started rushing toward Cain the moment she saw him.

Everly was sitting beside Klara with her eyes closed, she was probably sleepy from reading too much.

Elsie stared at Cain immediately, her sharp glare almost scared him. ‘Damn those legs, they are as thick as tree trunks!’

“No wonder she has the force of a cow…” Cain mumbled.

Jemima was sitting at the water edge, her build was the reverse of Diana. That chest was bigger than what could fit in his hands.

“Cain!” Katherine jumped at his back with a tight grip. She was small in all sizes. Pretty humble if he had to say, probably since she workout enough to burn fat but not enough to put on muscles like Selena.

With Kathrine and Amara tackling him from both sides, Cain fell on his back with a loud. Thud!

“What if you brought the wrath of the ladies?” Cain told the two maids.

“Well, they are the only two who asked to sign the exclusive contract as a condition to work here,” Lexi said as she stood above Cain’s head.

“I can see everything, also what do you mean?” Cain asked as he looked up.

“Then let me get a bit closer.” Lexi sat beside Cain’s head, “Those two were excited to join your bed on the first night, but sadly you never touched any of them.”

Cain looked down at Katherine and Amara who were sticking to him like glue.

“Stand up!” suddenly Hati walked in and lifted them both.

She then stared at Cain, “You really have dedication” She stared at how limp he was. Even being surrounded by all those women didn’t affect him at all despite everything.
