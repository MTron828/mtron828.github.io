Since they were expecting a lot of guests, the feast started early in the morning as soon as the city returned to life. Sebas ordered tables to be lined in the garden and the street close to the mansion.

To avoid problems and make everything as smooth as possible, Sebas asked Cain if he could open the ballroom again so they can use it as a special room for women. As per Sebas’s words, both commoners and nobles didn’t appreciate the mixing on such occasions.

Cain had to agree as it didn’t matter to him, it could also make planning easier as he can sit outside to greet the men while his wives could greet the women in the ballroom.

Cain stretched his arms as he saw the old wooden chair that Sebas gave him to sit on. “Please sit at the door and greet the guests, we want everyone to know who the groom is and how he looks.” Said Sebas with an excited face.

After Sebas left, Cain looked at the chair and sighed. In an instant, he opened an [Arcane Gate] and threw the chair inside. Flicking his fingers, he used [Creation] to make a black obsidian Chair that contrasted his hair color.

Cain knocked on the chair, “It will hold for the day at least.” The spell needed a lot of Mana so Cain was using the maze as a source of power. At this rate, he might need to start hunting dungeons monthly.

As Cain waited patiently to greet the first guest of the day, he quickly spotted him. And it was none other than Kayden and Lily, she had him dressed nicely for once. By nicely Cain meant that his armor was well cleaned and his hair was brushed and tended to.

Cain noticed another thing, Kayden still carried his sword with him. He needs to take that off so the other guests can feel at ease..

As Cain stood to greet Kayden, he was surprised to receive a pat on the head. “Such a good boy,” Kayden said as he walked inside.

Lily was about to call Kayden but she was surprised by Cain screaming.

“Hey! Want me to skin you alive?” Cain shouted at him.

Kayden slowly turned around, “The guard dog can speak…No, where did you come from Cain? And where is that white husky?”

“Did you hit your head? I was always here at least treat me a human!” Cain yelled back.

‘Did he perceive me as a dog? His madness was that he perceived most people as dogs, presumably by strength. Does this mean that he is equal to me in strength? Or is it just levels?’ Cain’s two brains were running ballistic trying to understand the inner workings of Kayden’s madness.

“Demons usually kill humans, should I do that?” Kayden smiled.

“No thank you, I already died and I know it’s not fun!” Cain replied both sarcastically and with a hint of truth. “What were you up to anyway?”

“He had some money on him so I rented a small house, he has been hunting monsters daily for both money and training.” Lily was the one to reply.

“So you’ve been taking care of him, Should we expect another marriage soon?” Cain tried to tease her but she shook her head.

“He still sees me as a dog, to him I’m just his overly smart and unique dog that can speak.” Lily sighed. Kayden needs to get over his madness otherwise having relation with someone weaker than him will be impossible.

“I shall look for a cure or at least something to stabilize him enough. Otherwise, I can only recommend that you pick a sword and start getting stronger.” Cain replied with a thinking face.

“She isn’t trained to bite.” Kayden suddenly said with a straight face.

‘Are all of his senses messed up?’ Cain thought.

“I can train her to use magic, would mind that?” Lily was thin and didn’t seem to have a talent for physical combat. But she might hold herself with magic.

“You can train dogs to use magic? You’re really a great mage.” Kayden looked at Cain surprised, imagining Lily holding a magic sword in her mouth and leaping around.

“Yes, yes I can. Would you mind her coming here for an hour or two a day?” Cain asked, with how overprotective Kayden was. He might go on a rampage if one of his dogs went missing.

“I don’t know if she can leave the house alone, I might need to buy her a collar and a leash and find someone to walk her to here,” Kayden replied with a serious thinking face.

Lily looked at Cain with a smile as of saying, ‘Did you hear that shit?’

“Fine, then how about I just give her a spellbook she can read at home? I do have a lot of them.” Cain was talking about the crap load of books he got from Morena’s hoard and his father’s treasure. He can also find some in Zaleria’s hoard if she took him to her hut.

“A spellbook, aren’t they expensive?” Kayden looked at Cain, he has heard about ridiculous the prices are.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“I would give them to her for free, they are just first-tier spells after all.” Cain pulled a spellbook from the maze and gave it to Lily.

“Firebolt, a stable between novice mages and an easy spell to start with. People with no prior knowledge of magic usually take a week to comprehend the spell and another one to be able to cast reliably.” Cain said.

“Would I be talented if I learned it in a shorter time?” Lily looked at Cain with excited, light glimmering eyes.

“Yeah, you would be talented.” Cain smiled, hiding the fact that Sofia learned multiple first tier-spells in a single afternoon. That is what he considers terrifying talent.

“You don’t look that excited, did you by any chance met someone who is extremely talented, or is it perhaps you?” Lily quickly caught up.

“Let’s just say that I know someone who could learn multiple first-tier spells in a single afternoon.” Cain smiled bitterly, it took him almost a year to learn his first spell. Sofia might end up as a powerful witch.

“Is that so?” Lily gave him a dubious glare before smiling again with a light bow.

“Anyway, thank you for the generous offer.” She said.

“Don’t mind it, get in and enjoy.” Cain led them inside.

When Lily tried to head toward the women’s area, Kayden grabbed her. “Where do you think you’re going? Cain, do you have a place for dogs?” Kayden was thinking it was improper to let a dog run free at someone’s marriage party.

“How about I get a private room for you both? That would be better right?” Cain glared at him, yet there was nothing to do about it.

Cain instantly sent an order to the ghosts to prepare a room in [Lisworth’s Magnificent Mansion]. He then linked it to the maze and opened a gate for Kayden and Lily.

“It’s not much but I hope you find it comfortable.” Cain smiled.

“Not much? Said the man who just wasted more than a seventh-tier spell worth of Mana. You’re really a great mage.” Kayden smiled as the two of them went inside.

The feast quickly started and quickly reached its end with Cain greeting everyone. As he expected, Cain felt Evan’s pain. Most people were talking about how Mabel has innovated a new bread and forget they were at his marriage.
