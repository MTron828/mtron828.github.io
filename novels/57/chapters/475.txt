Cain stood on top of a rock staring down at the deep valley. Boiling magma and rivers of acid poured down the endless abyss.

They had been walking and killing monsters for almost a day, and all they faced were some weakling sinners.

That was a bit disappointing. The sinners seem to have started avoiding Cain and his group after what they did to the Giants’ group.

If Cain was to move alone, he could force them out or explore dangerous areas. those places are too dangerous that he can’t possibly take all the girls with him.

Cracks in the ground like this probably mean what the hell residents call a snake pit–a dark, enclosed space filled with starving, bloodthirsty monsters.

It’s Hell’s version of dungeons, but here they are open all the time. If Bela’s daughter were down there, he wouldn’t know how she survives.

Well, survival here is a subjective term. Cain meant that she still didn’t lose her sanity and clinging to her magic.

‘If she can use cold magic, then probably…’ Cain had an idea in his head.

“Is this the ravine they talked about-nya?” Selena stood beside him, staring down the massive crack.

“I do sense some cold magic from down there, it isn’t much, but it’s something.” Isbert tried to sound like an expert. In reality, she felt nothing.

“Should we fly you down there?” Sofia asked with an excited smile on her face. Finally, she might be able to give Cain a ride.

“Do we have to jump down there? Can’t we take a short rest before?” Ellie sat on a rock, and her back end got seared. GYA! She cried in pain, and Cain splashed her with [Create Water]

“Didn’t I tell you not to touch anything without telling me?” He stared at her.

“You just said it, touch, not sit! And how can you sit comfortably?”

“We all here have a great resistance beside you and Mary. Make sure not to imitate us all the time.”

“How does that make sense?”

Cain quickly started getting exhausted talking to her.

“What do you say? Wait for me here, or come along?” Cain looked behind at the girls.

“We all go down, can’t just let you go alone,” Alice said with a smile.

“The place might be dangerous for Ellie and Mary. Someone needs to stay here to protect them.”

“Then what do you suggest?” Hati stared at him. She was hoping he would take her with him. The pace was underground, after all; she had her sister, who was an expert in earth magic.

Cain thought for a moment, “Isbert, we two go down. The rest stays.” He flicked his finger, creating a door to a [Lisworth’s Magnificent Mansion]

“This is a new one that I just created. Rest there, take a bath or relax while we explore.” Cain said with a passive face.

“A new one?” Sofia questioned.

Cain briefly explained that this mansion and the one they used in the other world are different because he can’t teleport directly to the outer world where the original is.

Cain cast [Fly] on Isbert and leapt with her to the cavern’s depth.

“Wouldn’t it be better if you brought Sofia or Zaleria? The girl we’re looking for is a witch like them, right?” Isbert asked.

“It’s a bit complicated, but witches aren’t as simple as a different type of mages.” Cain looked at her.

“Like what? I never had the pleasure of talking to one.”

“Witches, or more specific, sorcerers. They are people of magic, Mana flow through their blood and soul from birth. Casting magic is their birthright.” Cain explained.

“And why that matters?”

“Be patient. Let me finish explaining. Here in Hell, people are already dead. They are but souls.” Cain took a deep breath, “It would be a different matter if they were a powerful race, but humans, their souls aren’t supposed to contain such power.”

“Are you saying she will be a monster?”

“Not exactly. They start as all people sinners do in Hell, as soul worms. The problem starts when they die here for the first time. A human sorcerer’s soul is like a sponge soaked in Mana. When they die, it absorbs hell essence, corroding their minds and slowly driving them to insanity.”

“That doesn’t sound fun, don’t tell me she is going to be a mindless rampaging monster.” Isbert sighed. She wanted a simple retrieve and secure mission.

“What if I told you that I’m basically an insane sorcerer? I do use my soul as a catalyst.”

“I noticed that you didn’t carry a staff or a wand. I just thought you tucked it somewhere.” Isbert said as she finally landed on solid rock.

“Insane doesn’t mean losing your mind. It means not being confined by what is conventional. If mages shoot fireballs from their hands, an insane mage will shoot it from his mouth to distract his enemy while trying to cast a second spell.”

“Isn’t that just improvising?”

“Sofia is a witch, like a mage. She should fight from a distance. Why is she kicking everyone? Why could I stand up to a wyrm even though I’m far behind his level? Why are you growing so fast?”

“What do you mean?”

“Would a princess go running around alone, killing bandits and monsters just to become strong? Just so her father can push her to marry a random mage, does that sound normal to you?” Cain smiled at her.

“That isn’t normal…wait…that’s me.” Isbert finally started to realise what Cain meant.

“Damn, I never heard such words in a long time,” A voice rang in the caravan, causing both Cain and Isbert to freeze in place. A chilly presence ran through their bones. A higher being was glaring up at them.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Who are you?” Cain yelled, releasing a wave of Mana, trying to detect the signal’s origin.

“Cain Lisworth, Isbert Silver Ruris, no need to be scared. I merely wish to have a word. You can call me Silver. I believe I’m known as the Ice hero outside.” The voice stated with a hearty laugh.

“Cain, I hear things! Is this the witch?” Isbert was getting spooked by him.

“Don’t buy it. Absolute Zero wouldn’t just call us like this. How did you even get my signal? How do you know our names.” Cain growled.

“Got it from little girl Asmodeus. Sorry, but she tried to kill me. Had to give her a good beating.”

“Asmodeus is a man. Stop pretending. Who are you?” Cain growled.

“If you’re talking about that old man, he is imprisoned in a deep cell on the ninth layer. I just wanted to give you a warning, that girl Mary, keep away from her.”

Cain stopped trying to jam his signal for a moment, “Hold…”

“I only could contact you now since you moved away from her. Your only allies are your father, Sylph, and Isbert. If you seek his attention, avoid all those who follow the ignorant fakers above.”

Cain couldn’t care less, “Told you I’m not buying it. Who are you?” He was almost sure this wasn’t Silver. Such a being would have a more oppressive presence.

“In their hands, you’re merely a tool. Dancing on their palms like a doll on a stage, I’ve seen slaves with more freedom than you. Why are you sitting like an idiot while the others are growing strong? Do you remember Kayden, the demon following Ashura? How stronger did he get? Can you compare to him?”

“What do you mean? Get to the point. If you want it to say something.” Cain yelled. He was already doing his best to cut the signal, but it was of no use.

“Do you really believe that a god can’t heal a cursed girl? Do you think that a witch would be randomly sitting in a guild? What would a rare Jaguar be doing in the heart of the human kingdom? Why do problems keep popping up around you?” Silver sounded as if he was about to start shouting.

“They are stalling you down until it’s too late. Keep it like this, and you will only find Sylph’s corpse waiting. At that time, the soul inside you will finally snap, and you will become their obedient weapon.”

As his voice was slowly fading, “This is my advice, take it or leave it. The decision is yours, Great Enchanter Cain Lisworth of the elvish kingdom.”
