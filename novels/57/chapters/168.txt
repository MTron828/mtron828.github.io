From how violent he was moving, it had eventually slipped the wrong way. The sharp pain snapped Sofia back to reality, her pleasure was cut short.

‘That’s true, what I was thinking about. I should be trying to take control, with whom else I could find such an opportunity.’ Sofia though. Even If Zaleria taught her how to control her charisma, she still needs practice. Cain was the only person she could let her charisma loose on and be fine with the consequences.

Even though the pain was almost bringing her to tears she clenched her teeth and tried to calm down. She should be able to control him now that he is like that.

Cain intentionally didn’t even try resisting her charisma, he intentionally let himself fall under her will. It was true that even if he resisted she would eventually control him, but he could still find time to cover her again.

At that moment, Selena pulled Cain away. It was but a second but for Sofia, it felt like ages. Selena immediately turned him toward herself, she intended to take Sofia’s place and give her time to catch her breath.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The moment she let Cain so he could get at her, he instead jumped back on Sofia, completely ignoring Selena and Alice. “What-nya!” Selena jumped to pull him out again, he was like a possessed monster, his eyes only Saw Sofia.

“This isn’t like last time.” Alice hurried to cover Sofia, if she did that they might be able to get some control over him. But the moment she tried to move her body felt heavy. A sharp pain coursed through her body as her limbs moved in the opposite direction of what she wanted. She found herself hugging Selena and keeping her away from Cain and Sofia.

‘The binding? His will is leaking out?’ Now that Cain was out of control, her slave binding was forcing her to act in what benefited him the most.

“Let me go-nya!” Selena cried as she did her best to push Alice away without hurting her.

“O-On him!” Sofia cried and Gracie’s body moved on its own, she grabbed Cain’s neck from behind, wrapping her arms around his shoulder and her legs around his thighs.

“Hold him tight…I will try something.” Sofia gasped for air as she massaged her back end, he almost ripped her apart.

She stood on the bed in front of him. “Don’t move!” She yelled an order but it fell on deaf ears.

“Are you alright-nya!” Selena asked her as she was still dealing with Alice. “I’m fine but I don’t think I want him inside me any time soon,” Sofia replied, now that she cooled down bother her holes were aching in pain.

The important question now was how in the hell he is going to get him under control? He didn’t seem to listen to her words. Gracie won’t be able to restrain him forever.

Sofia racked her mind looking for an answer, Alice was unable to speak due to the binding, and Selena couldn’t possibly have a solution. At this rate, he will escape Gracie’s grab and end up on top of her again.

“Take the initiative.” Deep words Came from the corner, When Sofia looked Zaleria was standing there.

“Charisma follows your actions, unless you take the dominant role he will have it,” Zaleria added up as she took a seat.

“What do you mean?” Sofia asked, she completely forgot to ask what brought Zaleria to their room.

“I telling you to be the one to go at him, I will do it if you can’t. Right now I’m the only one besides you that he will pay attention to, I have 23 charisma after all.” Zaleria said as she put one leg on top of the other. The flames at the fireplace ignited so brightly that they made the room as bright as daylight.

Sofia understood what she has to do but she hesitated under Zaleria’s watchful eye. “Would you mind leaving the room?”

Hearing those words Zaleria sighed, what should she do with this girl. Slowly standing she took her clothes off in one go and walked toward the bed.

“I told you to get out!” Sofia yelled but Zaleria only smiled at her. “I’m going to show you firsthand how Charisma should be controlled.”

Sofia immediately stood between her and Cain, she could feel something strange from her.

“He calmed down?” Gracie said as she noticed Cain going limp in her hand. Sofia immediately turned around to check what had just happened.

“Rule number one, those with higher charisma score can dominate the control of those of lower score,” Zaleria said. Even if it was Sofia who started it, now that Zaleria was there she could size the control from her since she has more charisma. The concept was that if someone is already controlled they won’t have any will to resist.

Zaleria then walked toward Alice, staring at her in the eyes. Alice was able to move again since Cain had calmed down thanks to Zaleria. “Rule number two, the higher someone’s wisdom is the harder it is to control them. She is to me just like how 10 wisdom is to 13 charisma so I can’t control her.”(Zaleria’s 23 Charisma to Alice’s 20 wisdom)

Besides Alice, Selena was showing her belly and purring. Zaleria scratched her belly and Selena meowed “Controlling with the charisma seduction doesn’t always mean doing something sexy, affection, care, love, submission they all fall under the same seduction.” Zaleria said and she turned again toward Gracie.

“She has the same wisdom as you and Selena but I can’t control her, I don’t know why but ask her later, you might learn a thing or two.” Zaleria lifted an eyebrow as she saw Gracie staring back at her without even flinching. She has been under the charisma of a Cubas for so long that she almost gained immunity.

“What are you saying? We can talk about those later, now leave!” Sofia was getting irritated, for some reason, Zaleria was getting on her nerves and she felt her blood boil.

Zaleria grinned, “Now for the last lesson. You should take its burns.”

“Prostrate yourself!” Zaleria’s words seemed to echo in Sofia’s ears.

“What do you…” Before she could finish, Sofia felt the heat rise inside her. Her vision tunneled toward the ground in front of Zaleria. The next thing Sofia knew she was on her knee with her head on the ground at Zaleria’s feet.

“Speak with confidence and state your will loud and clear, a dominant can’t feel shame or concern.” Zaleria looked down at Sofia.

‘What I’m doing? Why I’m on the ground? I can’t move.’ Sofia thought as she tried to understand what was happening.

“This is how you should act with charisma, now go show how him it’s done,” Zaleria said as she released her.

“How could you do that?” Sofia yelled again.

Zaleria turned toward her with an exhausted face and extended her hand toward her face. “Kiss it.” Sofia immediately kissed Zaleria’s hand.

“Like this, state what you want with confidence. The same way you ordered that maid earlier.” Zaleria gave Sofia a slight tap on the cheek and walked toward the couch to sit and watch.

This time Sofia kept her mouth shut, she realized that all of them, except Gracie, were already in her palm. Zaleria has come here to help so she better listen.

Sofia returned to face Cain who was sitting in place without moving, Zaleria didn’t free him from Sofia’s charisma so he was still technically unconscious.

Sofia took a deep breath.
