Alice watched as Gracie had her way with Cain. In those few minutes, she had shown more emotion than the entire time they knew her. Unlike her who stayed unchanged, the other girls have all evolved.

Seeing Gracie move up and down with that giant smile on her face felt weird as no matter how much Alice focused, she could never sense her. It was a strange feeling that Cain and Sofia are feeling as well.

Gracie’s emotionless self hasn’t disappeared, it was instead integrated into her magic. Right now as she was releasing waves and waves of magic, they were so subtle feeling them was almost impossible.

Cain wasn’t having it easy, doing it with Gracie felt like a dream. His mind was barely able to distinguish dreams from reality. It was strange, her inside was just as tight as he wanted it. If he wanted it tighter, it becomes tighter, if he wanted it looser, it becomes looser.

Gracie helped herself to a kiss after the other. The man under here, she could never get enough of him. Each time he penetrated to her deepest crevices the underneath of her teeth tingled and her toes twisted.

The moment she felt it seeping to her inside, she pressed herself as hard as she could on him.

That wasn’t enough, she still wanted more. He? Cain was still fine, he could still go.

“That’s enough for you!” Alice grabbed her shoulder, “You’ve had enough!”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Gracie stared at Alice with glowing purple eyes, for a moment Sofia thought they were about to fight. “Sorry, I seem to have gone a bit far.” Gracie got out of bed and bowed to Alice.

ɴ[0)ᴠᴇʟ Alice smiled. This was still Gracie, even if she showed a strange side of her, she could always get back to her regular demeanor..

It was Alice’s turn now. The only reason she wanted to go first is that she didn’t like doing it with a used one. And right now, the mood wasn’t suitable for her to go and fetch some clothes and clean water to clean him.

‘I might have to just go for it this time…’ Alice smiled as headed toward Cain.

In a single glance, Cain realized what Alice was thinking about. Unlike Gracie, she was far easier to read when not actively trying to hide it.

“Alice, can you give me five minutes to rest?” Cain asked with a smile.

“O-of course,” Alice replied with a surprised face.

Cain then turned toward Gracie, “I want a cup of water, also can you bring me a clean towel and some warm water? I want to clean a bit as well.” If he knew what Alice want, he will give it to her.

Gracie walked toward the door and knocked on it, “What do you need Headmaid?” Amaya replied.

“The cleaning kit, as fast as you could.” Said Gracie.

Since Gracie told her to be fast, Amaya didn’t even bother replying and rushed to bring the kit. Her footsteps were a sufficient reply.

Alice had already given Cain a cup of water from the desk, after gulping it down he laid on his back.

Cain was enjoying pretty much anything and four times over. For that, he racked his two brains for a way to give the girls the best experience they could hope for.

For Gracie, it was giving her freedom and allowing her to do what she wants. It would be bad if he told her ~no~ as she was trying to be expressive for the first time.

But for now, it was Alice, after a few seconds he reached a certain memory in his head. When Sofia was training to control her charisma, he remembers waking to Alice sitting on his face but she quickly ran away.

He didn’t have a problem licking her so that was a possibility. “Alice, can you come here for a minute?” Cain called.

“Of course.”

As soon as he heard her reply, he pointed a finger at her with a passive face and said in a deep voice [Telekinesis]

“KYA!” Alice cried as his body, leg spread wide apart, floated toward Cain’s face. “W-what are you doing.” A faint cry escaped her lips.

“Having a taste,” Cain replied as he started liking her. She kept struggling and writhing around but Cain knew best. If she wanted him to stop she could just stand and moved away. This meant that he could keep going.

As Cain tried his best, Gracie had already gotten her cleaning kit and started cleaning him. All whilst Sofia and Selena were patiently waiting on the couch for their turn.

“Master, I’m finished.” Said Gracie.

Cain then lifted the twitching Alice with [Telekinesis] seeing as she was already dripping on his face he knew she was ready.

Alice’s body twitched as her hips refused to stop shaking, she couldn’t endure the embarrassment of sitting on his face. He was the man who saved her life, end
