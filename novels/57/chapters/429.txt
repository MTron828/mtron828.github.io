“I see, you only care about results?” Mary said.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“No, I care about intentions. Everybody makes mistakes so don’t worry about anything.” Cain lifted and laid her on the bed.

She glared at his eyes, the eldritch glow in them was inhuman. He cares about intentions, as long as they aligned with his. ‘As long as I do my job without crossing his goals, I should be fine.’ She thought.

Feeling Cain going faster and faster inside her, she smiled. Her thin hands grabbed the back of his head and pulled him to her chest.

She didn’t say anything, just held him there for a while. Cain took the chance to play a bit with her bosom, he couldn’t let it slip from his hands.

“Cain…” She whispered.

“Am I going a bit too fast?” Cain asked with a hit of worry.

“No, I just wanted to say that you can count on me. If not in fighting, just feel free to empty your heart on me.”

“Believe me, I’m not a sweet talker. Neither do I like ranting about problems to other people.” Cain replied, even if she asked, he rarely had anything personal to say.

“Not talk, things like this…do whatever you like.” She gently licked his ear. “Go faster.” She whispered.

Cain had no choice but to answer her request. Even so, he had to stay mindful of her human body, he can’t get as rough as he usually does with the other girls. The force he usually uses with Selena should be enough to break Mary’s hips in a single thrust.

After a while, Mary noticed Klara getting restless behind them. She was waiting for a long time and she was left for last.

‘Probably we should finish this, if I at this rate we can keep this up the whole night.’ The amount of force Cain was using on her was almost none existing in her eyes.

Just a few seconds after that, Mary seemed to reach her limit. She hugged Cain tightly and tried to squeeze every last drop out of him.

When Cain pulled out, Mary was already half asleep.

Klara carried her to the couch and used a towel to clean her up a bit. “Leave this to us, you go ahead.” The twin approached her. She took care of Marina while they were having fun so they felt obligated to help.

Klara leaped happily toward Cain with a big smile on her face. “Master, it’s finally my turn!” She leaped at him.

“Calm down, even I need a short rest.” Cain pushed her to the side.

She gave him a disappointed look, “Why?!”

“Five minutes rest.” Cain lay on the bed.

“Fine, but I will start on my own.” Klara laid on top of Cain and started scratching herself at him.

She was making it a bit hard for Cain to breathe but he said nothing. He just didn’t want to stop her.

Before he could know it, she had managed to get him up again.

“Can we start?” She said with a happy smile.

“Fine, turn around.” Cain helped her lay on her stomach.

Slowly, he started pushing between the mountains just for her to feel him putting some pressure on her back end.

“That’s the wrong one.” She said.

“This, or wait three minutes,” Cain said hoping she will let him rest a bit more.

“Fine, go for it.” She replied.

“Three minutes it’s them.” Cain moved away to rest but she grabbed him.

“I meant to put it in, I’m not waiting any longer!” She pouted.

Cain gave up, he slowly pushed inside her back end. “Aw, it hurts!” She gasped.

“That wasn’t even the tip, should I stop?” Cain asked.

She turned toward him with a disappointed face. “You never get the hints, do you?” She approached his ear and whispered something.

Cain sighed upon hearing what she said, “You remind me of a certain someone. Fine, have it your way.” This maid was really a handful to take care of.

Cain made her stand on all fours and present her bottom side to him. He didn’t know how much strength she can take so he started slowly taping her mountains harder and harder until she tapped the bed giving him a signal to stop.

She could only take about 13 strengths. [Telekinesis] Cain used the spell to put restraints on himself and only limit his strength to that amount for safety.

“Now, you sure?” He asked again and she bundled her hair and handed him the tip. “Just go for it.”

Cain grabbed her hair and stopped at the back door, taking a deep breath he pushed to the base in one go causing Klara’s body to jolt and a loud moan to escape her. He kept track and she didn’t tap out meaning she was fine.

Cain started thrusting the same strength while pulling on her hair, each time she tried to pull her peach away he will just slap it back to place.

As the wild night continued, Mary watched Cain and Klara get at it while half asleep.

‘We’re late, should we try and force him to get the rest in.’ she thought, her mind wandering toward Hati, Skoll, Isbert, Nemmoxon, Farryn, and a lot of others. ‘No, we might end up ruining it again. It’s best to convince us.’

Slowly, she decided to talk about it with the girls. If possible she wanted to make sure everyone stays linked to Cain.

…

The morning quickly came and Cain woke up to all the girls sleeping on top of him.

The first ones to wake up to him moving were the twin maids. The moment he moved an inch they jerked back to life.

“Master, you’re awake?” One of them asks, and the other nodded.

“No, I’m asleep. And you? Never had the time to ask but is the orphanage doing well?” Cain grabbed one in each arm.

“Thanks to you, it has already started working. All the kids have gotten a place to call home.” The twins kissed Cain on the cheek.

“Good to hear,” Cain smiled as he tried to stand up but the twins stopped him.

“There is still some time. Let us sleep like this for a whole.” The twins said at the same time and Cain relaxed.

Looking out of the window, the birds have just woken up so they still had a few minutes to spare.

“Wanted to talk about anything?” Cain felt that those two maids won’t do something like this without a reason. He looked at them and thought about what question to ask.

“Now that you mentioned it, there is something about Lady Marina.” One of the twins said tilting her head.

“She is getting restless all the time.” The other one confirmed.

“How is that? Is it the stress of work?” Cain asked, he might need to assign a special helper since Sebas is already having a lot on his hands.

“No, she has been trying to learn magic and swordsmanship but failing.” One of them said.

“She almost burned her room when she failed a first-tier spell.” The other added.

“Failing is a natural step in learning? Why was she practicing magic in her room?” Cain asked what he tough was important.

“She is embarrassed.” The twin said at the same time.
