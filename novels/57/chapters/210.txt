While Selena and the death knight were clashing, Sofia and Yamauba had their own battle against the lich. He was an extremely powerful spell caster that surpassed both of them yet he was being careful just because they were close to the man who just cast two ninth-tier spells in a row.

When the two of them looked at him, they knew he was an extraordinary mage. They can’t tell the details but the air around him is that of an extremely knowledgeable mage.

‘What, how rare it to see someone who have mustered seventh-tier magic.’ The lich smiled inside, For a moments the memories of him teaching at the magic academy crossed his mind.

He then tried to apprise Yamauba but he failed and felt a sharp headache.

“You…Mental fortress and a god’s blessing?” The lich growled and Yamauba’s face tensed up, she held her staff forward and growled back at him.

“Trying to peek into a woman’s mind, you fiend!” [Fireball] She charged the spell on the tip of her staff.

The Lich pointed him finger toward her [Counter spell] The fireball immediately disappeared into thin air. “Silence!” The lich screamed, in the next moment he instantly launched a spell at her. [Milf’s Acid Arrow]

Swoosh! Sofia flew in at high speed with [Burning feet] and swung her hands at the arrow [Burning hands] Evaporating the arrow instantly. As the lich started at her wondering how could she do that, he missed Yamauba teleporting from behind her.

[Lightning strike] Yamauba who appeared a few feet behind him released her spell. The lightning hit his back with a thundering boom, flashing brightly on the battlefield.

Yamauba inspected the smoke in front of her, trying to see if the lich survived. Crack! From the dust, a staff came swinging and crashed on her shoulder [Thunderwave] BOOM A massive shock wave exploded and Yamauba got sent rolling with shoulder bone shattered.

The lich looked toward Sofia as he felt her magic swell, [Firebreath]. Seeing impressive come of flames the lich pointed his finger toward her “Huh? A weakened cone spell, you tricks are pathetic!” [Counter spell]

The fire didn’t fade, and the lich took the hit directly. Sofia’s fire breath wasn’t a weakened cone spell as he though, it was derived from her draconic blood, and original spell that she pulled off. To counter a spell you need to be knowledgeable with it’s basic formula.

The lich’s attention started to shift from Yamauba to Sofia, that girls was the real threat. ‘I better kill her quickly’ The lich though, [Finger of…] At that moment, a flash of light hit him from the side, burning his flesh and bones.

[Globe of Invulnerability] A crystalline sphere appeared around the lich and deflected the light that Yamauba cast at him. “You can use Dawn? Aren’t you a mage or does it have anything to do what the blessing I felt inside of you?” The lich laughed as his flesh regenerated, “Let me see your stats!” He screamed with enthusiasm.

“Shut up you pile of bones!” Sofia screamed trying to get her charisma to affect the lich, unfortunately, he was immune to such effects and felt no fear.

[Burning feet] She flashed toward him in an instant, [Counter spell] he failed again and Sofia managed to land a solid kick on the crystalline sphere.

‘Is she immune to counter spell? Was it that kid’s doing?’

[Burning body] Sofia’s body burst into flames and she spun around rapidly. The lich tried again [Counter spell] He yet failed, ‘She is immune, trying more is just a waste of Mana’ [Burning feet] after gathering momentum Sofia kicked the crystalline sphere again cracking it.

The lich spun his staff and canceled the crystalline sphere, taking one step ahead, he swung his staff at her [Thunderwave]

Seeing the strike coming toward her, Sofia swung her palm at him [Flame strike]

BOOM! As her hand clashed with his staff, a massive explosion occurred. It was the result of the burst of flame strike met the shockwave of thunderwave.

Sofia didn’t wait and swung again, the lich couldn’t believe she was going for second attack, that was a fifth-tier magic she just used. wasn’t she worried about running out of MP?

A strike after the other, they exchanged blows causing a shockwave after the other.

“You insolent little girl!” He screamed reaching with his hand at her, [Freezing Touch]

A flash of flames emerged from her body, [Investiture of flames] The lich’s hand burned immediately, “Hurry up and die!” Sofia screamed at him.

[Dimension door] The lich quickly backed away from her by jumping into his portal and traveling a fair distance.

When he appeared on the other side, he was surprised to find Sofia right beside him, Yamauba was a master of teleportation magic so she got her there as quick as the lich.

“Who tough you this!” the lich screamed an eldritch flames burning in his eyes. [Finger of Death]

As the necrotic magic approached Sofia, she as well unleashed the trump card Cain burned into her bones. [Fire Storm]

In an instant, winds started rushing toward her as flames fell from the sky like rains. The flames circulated around her at an immense speed to the point it looked as of she was engulfed a small flame tornado.

The clash between the two was so intense that Yamuba couldn’t get close. One wrong move and she will either get burned by Sofia or be killed with the lich’s necrotic magic and turned into an undead.

“Purgatory witch…I guess this is hell, only made with fire and death!” Yamauba described the seance in front of her.
