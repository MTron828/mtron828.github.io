“Well then…” Lord Ironlake was struggling for his life as Cain looked around.

“What do you want?” Lord Ironlake growled.

“What do I wants? First, I don’t want this to become a mess. Need you to go down, tell your men to stand down.” Cain said standing.

“Then get fucked, those men are going to bust the two women open.” Lord Ironlake growled trying to spit on Cain but a Telekinetic barrier blocked everything.

“Who said you have a choice? I usually respect low levels but how could a landlord stay at level one? You need strength to back up your words.” [Dominate Person] Cain used magic to control the Lord.

“You as well, go wear something.” Cain turned toward the lord’s scared wife. [Dominate Person]

As Cain released both of them, he sensed something off. A group of people has just run out of Cain’s detection range. “You have people on standby that’s supposed to do something in this kind of situation?” Cain glared at the lord.

“Murky, an assassin group, trained to deliver letters to the capital’s nobles about us being taken down…” Lord Ironlake said as if in a trance.

“Can you take care of them or should I go?” Cain said looking behind him.

Emerging from his shadow with wilding dual daggers, a shadowy aura around her. “Master needn’t worry, I shall hunt them down.” Gracie bowed slightly as she disappeared.

Running through the forest, the assassins didn’t look behind. Being attacked means being attacked. They have to deliver the news by hand no matter what.

“We need to split up, and make sure you reach the destination alive.”

Rushing between the trees, it was a road they memorized through years of training. Splitting up happened smoothly.

One of them leaped on a tree to scout the area for monsters, they can’t afford to slip up.

STAB! Gracie emerged from the shadows behind him stabbing him in the heart. His head slowly turned around to glare at his killer, all he could see from his blurred vision was a shadowy figure with glowing purple eyes. “Raven…queen…” His life faded and Gracie pulled the blade swinging it to take the blood off.

“One…” Gracie started counting, she has spotted 13 assassins in total. She has to make sure they will not escape the forest alive.

She immediately leaped into the shadows, swimming around in the darkness, leaping from one shadow to another, she kept tracking them by their shadows. They were splitting up, but since they are all heading in the same general direction, they stayed relatively close to each other.

‘We didn’t get the monsters’ report yet, is everything all right?’ One of the assassins thought. ‘The area must be so safe he is…’ CLANG! Gracie suddenly appeared from behind a tree swinging her dagger, the hit instantly cut the man’s throat open. His body spun around splashing blood everywhere as his eyes looked onto Gracie.

As death loamed around his body, his consciousness was slowly fading, the last thing he could see was a shadowy figure with purple eyes glaring at him.

‘Ah…the night…’ That was his last thought, yet he couldn’t speak it up.

“Two…” Gracie made sure the man was past tense before rushing toward the rest.

Gracie rushed from one tree to the other, the last time she went on a killing spree like this was when Cain had her take over Ourals. She can’t say she is feeling anything killing them beside the need to do it. To her, killing humans when Cain asks her to do it is like getting asked to kill the rats roaming the kitchen. Not an enjoyable job but one that has to be done, and she isn’t stopping no matter how much they squeal.

Soon she saw another one leap from a rock in front of her. She quickly teleported to the shadows on a tree ahead of him and pulled out her steel wire.

The moment the assassin passed by, his neck got caught and she hanged him on the tree. For a brief moment, “Demon…” He growled looking up at Gracie on the tree, he couldn’t see her face, just a shadowy figure with purple eyes.

Sadly, the wire was so thin that the assassin’s weight was enough to decapitate him before he could say anything else.

“Three…” Gracie continued her hunt.

Her next target was running between the trees when she emerged from a shadow in the ground aiming a strike at his neck.

CLANG! This was a bit more skilled, he managed to block Gracie’s initial attack. “From…GRA!” He immediately screamed as a nail stabbed his crotch.

Gracie instantly teleported behind him stabbing him in the heart and then teleporting back in front of him slicing his throat.

“Four…” She didn’t even wait, he was already dead.

Next, she found three of them running together, they must have gotten alerted due to losing contact with their friends.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

This time Gracie decided to strike from the back, they must know they are being hunted.

She teleported behind them preparing to stab two at the same time when they turned around. “We’ve been waiting!” One of them swung his dagger.

“No wonder we had no signals, how did you get here?” The other one swung his sword. The third was getting ready to throw a dagger at her.

Gracie didn’t flinch, she might have lost the element of surprise. But they weren’t her match.

Tuf! She immediately spat on the face of the one about to throw a dagger while deflecting the two strikes with her daggers.

ZIP! The steel wire emerging from her wrist wrapped around the assassin’s hand and she swung him at his friend. He managed to hold up well so they didn’t hit each other but he took the dagger to the back.

“Come here!” the other one screamed rushing at Gracie with a sword swing.

Gracie spun around smacking him with a back kick to the neck. The hidden blade on her sole tore his arteries open and she finished him with multiple chest stabs.

“Got you!” Even though he was stabbed, the other assassin managed to hit Slash Gracie on her back just for him to feel something unexpected. The feeling of hitting steel. Her back was covered with throwing knives that acted like armor.

Immediately, Gracie used the shadows to teleport right to the man’s face and slashed his eyes out. She got freaked out for a moment because he might have seen her back but she soon remembered the knives and released the man from his misery with a heart stab.

The last one was twisting and twirling on the ground in his own dreamland. Her spit was too much for him to take that he wasn’t even able to stand. A sweet smell was coming from him but Gracie killed him without hesitation.

“Need to ask Master for food tonight… Those are seven.” She rushed away searching for the rest.

“Eight.”

“Nine.”

“Ten, Eleven.”

“Twelve.”

Quickly falling like flies, it soon became the last one turn to die.

Rushing out of the forest and seeing the capital’s walls in the distance, he smiled. “I made it…guess not.” He giggled feeling the horrid presence behind him. He turned around to see Gracie walking toward him with her daggers in hand.

“To think we were killed by a maid…no that’s not right. The reaper of souls and memories that came for my life, you’re her right?” The assassin said lifting his dagger.

Gracie didn’t reply, she was here just to kill him, no question asked. Leaping at him, he blocked. She immediately teleported behind him and stabbed him in the heart.

“Hehe…I blocked a strike from the goddess of death…” His soul left his body as he stared at Gracie’s shadowy face. He could her maid outfit but her face was a dark shadow with glowing purple eyes.

After making sure he was dead, Gracie jumped back into her shadow to return to Cain. Not giving a shred of care about the assassin’s words.

“Master, I eliminated them all.” Gracie appeared behind Cain who was sitting in the Ironlake’s lord office room with Nemmoxon and Isbert.

Both girls got surprised by her sudden appearance, especially Nemmoxon since she could barely sense her presence (Since it was muffled by Cain’s aura)

“Good job, how did it go?” Cain turned toward her immediately assessing her HP, she was at max meaning she didn’t sustain any injuries.

“Smooth…they were simple to take out,” Gracie replied.
