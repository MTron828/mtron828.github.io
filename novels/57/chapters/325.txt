“That was a blast, I never laughed like this. If you needed us half-bloods to calm you then how low you have fallen, graceful elves!” Lilia grinned.

Sylph sat on her chair as they got released, inside this room. Eilistraee was the strongest melee fighter, Varis was the strongest at the range, and Lilia was the strongest mage. Sylph had the largest amount of raw power. The unique tree magic that she was granted by the world tree gave her great options in every fighting style.

In their past life, While Cain was still Sylph’s slave, Lilia was the one helping her extract what information they can from him about the dragons. She could say it was Lilia’s mistake that Cain managed to enslave Sylph, it was because she kept using magic in front of him thinking that it was impossible to copy her magic easily.

“Fine, we’ll leave the traitor’s matter to another time. For now, let’s discuss the dragon’s movements.” Sylph said with an exhausted face.

“They are aiming to size the world tree, that for sure. Do you know why?” Varis stared at Sylph.

“They intend to use the tree’s roots to reach the outer planes!” Sylph declared. Keeping that a secret could complicate things in the future as it did in the past.

“The roots, you mean the pathways the tree uses to absorb magic from the outer planes. If that is what they plan, why shouldn’t I just go and flatten the star dragon mountain?” Lilia said with a thinking face while floating upside down.

“They won’t give you enough time, and even if you did, who will stop the dragon king? I’m not facing that thing for you!” Eilistraee finally spoke.

Sylph remembered Cain faking the twin meteor to scare her. She wasn’t surprised because this little monster exist. She had upgraded [Meteor Fall] into [Meteor Shower] She can drop up to ten meteors at the same time. She was a level 100 mage who dabbled in witchcraft, necromancy, and even psionic magic. She was what magic addicts, the kind of people who get enjoyment from using the big spells.

Sylph was a level 100 tree-bound druid.

Varis was a level 100 ranger and beast tamer.

Eilistraee was a level 100 swordsman and dancer.

…

Back at home, Cain slowly opened his eyes to feel something heavy on top of him. Selena was sleeping on him. The moment he moved slightly she opened her eyes.

“Nya!” She started sniffing his face, trying to see if he was still bleeding.

“I-am awake…get off me.” Cain rolled to the side, it was hard for him to breathe and Selena’s weight on top of him didn’t help. She was heavy, she probably weights as he, Alice, and Sofia combined. A ball of raw muscles and bones, even though it isn’t apparent from the outside.

High human traits

Grant a +2 to intelligence and Wisdom.

[Arcane Mind]: The user’s mind is attuned to magic and allows easier control over Mana.

[Great mental Resistance]: Allow easier control over emotions such as Sadness, fear, desire, pain, lust, and emotional damage.

[Human’s best]: Other humans seek high humans instinctively. Other humans naturally consider your mere existence sacred.

Abomination trait

Grant a +1 to Strength, dexterity, and constitution.

[Mouldable body]: The ability to move your organs freely inside your body. An abomination naturally has two hearts and two brains. The two extra organs are located in the abdomen cavity.

[Evolving physic]: You can surgically add organs or remove them. The abomination’s body will adapt to them in three days. Survival is possible with at least one of each organ.

[Unnatural life]: Since your body can’t follow the natural rules of living things it is considered an aberration to the world. Enchanting magic work on your body.

[Extreme digestion]: Your stomach can process all types of food that can be eaten by all standard creatures. It allows you to digest meat, bones, grass, some weak poisons, rotten meat, and magic-infused food (Such as Mana potions). And even dirt.

[Dragon Heart]: The heart can work as a pump for both blood and magic, reducing the casting time for spells, accelerating healing, and increasing endurance. The heart is less likely to stop from fatal injury than a normal one, which increases survivability

[Draconis fundamentum]: Allow the use of draconic magic and their breath weapon, the organ will explode if the host died with more than 100 MP left.

“Are you okay-nya? Everyone has been worried-nya!” Selena jumped back on him, her claws pierced his shoulders.

“I’m fine, see!” Cain spread his arms, “Where are the others”

“Resting, you almost gave them a heart attack!” Zaleria replied, she flew in from the window.

“Did I have any complication?” Cain stared at her, to his knowledge, he only had a bad dream. But to him, that wasn’t strange when his heart was pulled out.

“Sylph send you her regards, is that enough explanation?” Zaleria glared at him.

Cain turned serious, his eyes glowed with ancient magic as he tried to discern what happened.

“Care to tell me what happened?” Cain stared at her, something bad must have happened.

Zaleria recited to him everything in great detail, and Cain’s face grew stiffer. “So that wasn’t just a dream. Did activate because of the dragon heart or the Draconis fundamentum? That was unexpected so I should put measure against it.” Cain’s eyes glowed blue and Selena jumped away as she sensed weird magic swelling inside of him.

Cain enchanted the lumps of dead flesh inside of him (The ones left from when Alice cursed him) to track and destroy the brain in which the mad soul will reside. If the mad soul was to be released again this will be enough to knock him out instantly.

“I explained what happens to you, now do you care about explaining your part?” Zaleria glared at him, “I even sent your father to hunt us something big, figured he will do something drastic.”

Cain stared at her before smiling, “It will be a long story, even for a dragon. I also doubt you will even believe it. You better call everyone here, including father.” Cain stared at her as he stood to change his clothes. From the bustling he can hear downstairs, the wedding preparation is done.

It only took about half an hour for everyone to gather up. That included Sofia, Selena, Alice, Gracie, Zaleria, and Chad who she flew in and grabbed.

Cain stared at them sitting around him, “From where should I start? The end should be better. To put it simply, this is my second time living this life. I once died and restarted on my first day in the guild.”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Cain then started telling his story, a tale of suffering and growth. He started as a low-level adventure, slowly consuming every misfortune that he encountered and turning them into strength. Sofia and Selena were surprised they never appeared in Cain’s story, Alice smiled as she learned of her original fate.

Zaleria couldn’t believe half of what Cain was saying, even though her instincts told her he was telling the truth.

“Morena killing me? You must be crazy to think I will believe such a thing!” Zaleria growled. “But she almost did if not for us?” Chad glared at her.

Cain stared at them “Almost did? Did something happens that you didn’t tell me about?” Cain glared at them.

“Morena, Chad killed her,” Gracie said with a quiet voice sipping her tea. You could say it was her who did it since she broke her phylactery.

Cain sighed, that was a bit part they emitted. “I hope she ends up in heaven.” Cain prayed for her.

“That unexpected, I don’t think she did anything to deserve that from you?” Zaleria glared at Cain.

“It’s more convenient if she ended in heaven instead of hell,” Cain replied.

“Why is that? From what I know, hell is where bad people end up.” Zaleria stared at him.

“People, not dragons. Hell is designed for humanoids, not your kind. I will explain it later.” Cain stretched his arms and rested his head on the pillow. He decided to skip most of the dark times he spent with the dragons and elves to ease the storytelling on his wives. It’s better to know Sylph as the woman who saved Cain from the dragons rather than the one who enslaved him to extract information with that laughing-short hag.
