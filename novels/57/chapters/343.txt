ZOON! ZOON! Cain jumped through a portal and appeared beside Bela. “What is it? I do want to attend my wedding party.” Said Cain.

When Bela looked at him, he was still munching on the snack he was eating in the ballroom.

“Sorry Lord Cain, but we have to deal with this one here.” Bela pointed at the half-unconscious cleric.

“Killing him will be a problem sooner or later, I don’t want anything suspicious around my wedding,” Cain said as she squatted down close to the cleric.

The man was fairly young, probably in his early twenties. There are multiple ways that he could do this but first…Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Tell me how exactly it happened,” Cain asked.

Bela recited what happened as accurately as she can, and in the end, Cain smiled. “Let’s go with this.”

[Sleep] was enough to send the cleric into a deep sleep, Cain then waved his hand above the man’s skull and chanted something that Bela didn’t understand.

[Dragon’s Modify Memory] “Let’s make it that you slapped him so hard for touching you that he was knocked out.” Cain used the man’s memories until the moment he touched Bela.

“Bela, Cain you slap behind you? Turn around and pretend that you’re slapping him.” Cain ordered her..

As Cain saw her, he copied that memory and injected it into the priest, making it a bit foggy so it won’t be that weird. He then deleted all the memories of what happened after the slap so the man will only remember that.

After a few minutes, the man woke up in the street outside Cain’s mansion. His head was throbbing in pain as if he was hit with a club.

He remembered chasing a woman because he got a strange feeling from her and ended up being slapped.

“You’re a pretty lucky brat, touching lady Bela and keeping your life.” The cleric heard a voice behind him, it was one of the guards that William employed.

“Yeah, how did you get the idea to touch her? Lord Cain was about to burn your whole family for harassing his adviser.” The second guard spat on the ground.

The cleric pieced the events that he got slapped so hard he passed out.

“But…I could swear I felt necrotic magic from her!” The cleric growled.

“Of course, you would!” The guard kicked him in the guts, “She is spending most of her time researching undead to prepare in case a second invasion happens and idiots like you thank her sacrifices with harassment!” The guard’s face was red with rage.

It clicked in the cleric’s head, people usually retain some lingering necrotic magic on them for hours after interacting with the undead. That was a fact that he knew, yet he still assumed she was an undead before thinking of that. This was a mistake that even a newbie cleric shouldn’t make.

“Where is she? I should apologize!” The cleric jumped just to be punched by the second guard.

“Scram if you value your life, it took all her power to keep Lord Cain from killing you, and now you want to get in again? What you did can’t be forgiven and will never be, just go and never show your face to them again!”

The cleric walked away with a sad face, he was lucky the incident was never made public.

Cain stretched his arms before opening a gate.

“That was spectacular, would you teach me how to do it one day?” Bela asked but Cain glared at her.

“You stink, learn how to handle your magic, or I will skin you!” Cain grabbed her head with a tight grip.

“AH! Don’t be so rough, I’m just not used to my body!” She wiggled like a worm.

“You better learn quickly,” Cain growled as he let her go, she gave him a sad face as if not satisfied.

“What do you…” Cain was about to ask but as soon as he saw the weird face she was making he changed his mind. “Never mind, I have a wedding to attend.” And he immediately ran away.

Doing everything took him less than half an hour but a good chunk of his magic. Cain could feel the exhaustion building up in him but he could steel go, probably he was just annoyed at the sudden event.

When he returned, he found the girls have already eaten and were chatting with the guests. Sofia immediately ran toward Cain with a scared face.

“What is it?”

“How could it be? Those people are asking me if I could marry my son to them!” She cried at the bizarre questions she was getting.

“I told her that some nobles get married even before birth, just for political power and things, especially when the families are in dire need of strength.” Alice explained, “Don’t worry, I made sure we refused everything.” Marina walked from behind Alice.

‘Those two seem to be getting along well, probably since both of them are of nobility’ Cain thought.

“Yeah, such a decision can’t be made without the head of the house,” Alice added.

Cain stared at her, “No, such a decision should never be made without the involved people’s approval. If my father got me married before I was born, my first move will be to kill him to take his wealth.”

“I guess that’s right,” Marina added.

“How about Selena, she didn’t promise anyone right?” Cain asked, Alice, Marina, and Gracie are too smart to say yes and Sofia would see it as strange. Selena was the only unpredictable one.

Marina looked at Alice as if asking for help, “Selena punched the first person to ask her and broke her teeth.” Marina pointed at an unconscious woman in the corner.

“My children will choose with their strength and not by my words, she said,” Alice repeated what Selena said.

Cain sighed in relief, it would have been a bit bad if she promised anything.

After a few seconds a man approached Cain with an angry face, he was the unconscious woman’s husband.

“How could your wife do this?” The man growled, throwing his glove at Cain. At that moment everyone gave them space, that was a challenge to a duel.

“Was that a question worth punching her for?” The man added in rage.

Cain thought about it for a second, you can’t treat Selena as human, she is a jaguar at heart. If her instincts said punch, she would punch.

“I don’t seem to be wearing gloves, let me borrow som,” Cain said with a calm tone. “Sebas, can you lend your gloves?”

“As you wish master.” Sebas rushed and handed him his gloves.

Cain slowly wore them and looked at the man, “You know it’s wrong to force children into marriage.” Cain said what the church of this city say, the act of bounding children like that was forbidden, “Yet you side with your wife in her deed.” Cain smiled.

“What are you saying?” The man got even angrier.

“I also know my wife has gone too far, but just like you, I will support her.” Cain flung the glove at the man.

Thwack! The glove impacted the man with an incredible force producing a massive shockwave. The man’s body rag-dolled to the wall bleeding. [Enchanting: Shockwave Impact]

“I do accept…” Cain stared at the man and smiled, “Not even worth a glove throw?”

Cain then turned toward the other guests, “Well now, how come the children’s question came only when I left?” His eyes glowing blue. They clearly tried to use his wives to gain an advantage over him.

“Calm down, it’s but a woman talk and that’s it!” Chad chopped Cain on the head. “Who cares about what they say? Those noble women always like to spew nonsense.”

William was grabbing his head as he watched them, a man who chose violence and his father who doesn’t care.

“Cain, can you please let me handle this?” Marina approached Cain and grabbed his arm.

Cain’s face immediately broke into a smile, “Of course!”
