Cain flew between the hordes of pit fiends like a fly, swinging his two black swords in a single move. SLICE. Two pit fiends got sliced in half across the torso, their heavy bodies slammed to the hard ground cracking it. CRACK!

Thud! Cain landed on them like a dancing shadow, his body phasing out of reality as he was suspended in between the shadows and reality.

"Is the monster the Lord created? Dispater has lost to a human lately, does this mean he is getting changed?" the pit fiend growled watching Cain stands on the corpse mountain.

Cain looked down toward him, "Dispater? Yeah, where is that idiot?" He started walking down, multiple lightning balls forming behind his body, "I bet he is worth more than you ants."

The pit fiend gulped, clenching his hand on his flail and rising a fireball on his palm. "You might have been sent by Asmodeus oh'great Diablo, but to us, Dispater is still the current lord of this layer." Thwack! He leaped toward Cain with a powerful swing of his flail. Cain dodged by using [Misty step] [Shadow cover]

The pit fiend pointed his palm at Cain and yelled GRWAA! The fireball exploded in Cain's face sending him flying backward, "I got a hit on him!" The pit fiend roared in victory, his head fell off.

"Since when you devils went against Asmodeus? Are you getting mad?" Cain smiled flying past him toward the other Pit fiends.

PEW! PEW! Iron spears fell from the sky as rain, and Cain had to fly backward dodging them. The lower devil army seems to have resurrected at last. Cain swung his arm up, lifting a hill size wall of solidified magma to protect himself. BAM! BAM!

As the devils glared at his directing, they started feeling the mana twist and crumble, he was building something big.

Cain pointed his palm in their direction, A massive magic circle manifested as he smiled, "Who said it has to fall from the sky?" With a vile smile, he conjured the meteor just in front of him. [Meteor Fall] he sent it plowing through the ground of Dis till it reached the other side.

KABOOM! It exploded at the end in a great flare, lighting the entire layer with a bright flash.

[Exp +1985400]

He turned toward the side, [Meteor Fall] sending another one in the other direction killing what got in its wake.

[Exp +1342700]

'Not as much? I wonder if I could get more if I went to the third layer. The gate in the middle of Dis city.' Cain looked toward the city on the horizon.

Primordial hearts:

[Primordial Hearts: 12 Hearts]

------------------------------------------------

'I should stop eating them, I don't think my body can take more without having serious problems.' Cain looked at how his stats increased. His intelligence was steadily increasing as he devoured the devils.

He has four brains, each with a separate intelligence score. When casting a spell using them, that individual score is what determines power. His displayed intelligence is that of the smartest brain.

The twelve primordial hearts have spread across his body, six of them dormant awaiting for him to transform into his true form while the other six powers his body.

A primordial heart was different than normal, being no larger than an egg but with the strength of ten normal hearts. Cain had them move across his body to make targeting them almost near impossible. This has caused both his strength and constitution to rise.

Gray has gotten stronger as well, now that Cain's blood wasn't rejecting him and that he has access to devil blood and magic, he had begun growing on his own.

'Gray, want to take over?' Cain asked himself, 'Can I?' Gray replied.

'I do want to test it if one of the girls received a deadly blow. Will I be able to give them a new body?' Cain replied.

'You're not giving me a body‚Ä¶'

'My body should be able to morph to suit you, rampage for a bit, and then will release Morena as well.'

'Listen to him, Gray. This experiment should be fun.' Morena added and Cain stood taking a deep breath. He was still in control but he could let Gray have it for a short white.

The darkness engulfing Cain's body disappeared for a moment, and the devils resurrected feeling an immense cursed presence. CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!

From the darkness, Gray walked out in a monstrous form a four-armed, mutely horned abomination. A mixture between dragons, undeath, and devils. As he stood there on top of the hill, a single devil approached him.

"You're finally out, took you quite a while to show yourself," Gray said with a cracking voice, his magic slowly building up to a boil.

The ash-skinned, two-horned slim devil stared at him with a smile. "Do you think you can take me on? Asmodeus was long sealed, who sent you to replace me after I lost? That bitch?" Dispater growled.

"So it's true that Asmodeus was sealed," Cain's thoughts escaped Gray's mouth, he was clearly not fully in control. Cain was just lending him the wheel.

"Who are you? I have never seen a devil like you. Are you an evolved shadow devil?" Dispater asked with a smile, "Shadows can never best iron."

"Said the devil who lost to a human, grandfather really damaged your brain," Gray said with a passive voice.

Dispater's bulk power was in his ability to turn things into iron and then rust them with his staff. The staff he lent to Morena was destroyed and Cain can't be turned into iron as he is an eldritch monster. To him, Dispater was but another really powerful devil.
