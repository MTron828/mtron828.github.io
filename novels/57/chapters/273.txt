After discussing everything, Cain relaxed his body in the hot water.

Hati and Skoll were there so he sadly couldn’t do anything but sit with the girls. It was also great to have time like this.

Cain did have enough time to enjoy looking at the girls. He noticed that Sofia’s horns have grown a bit longer. Unlike those of normal fire dragons, they were curving forward in a weird way.

Cain asked Sofia to sit on his lap as he examined her head. She could feel something poking at her back so was nervous all the time.

The horns seem to resemble those of black dragons but have the same marking as red dragons. It wasn’t very clear as they were smaller than half an inch long but it seem strange.

From what Cain remembers, Sofia was Zaleria’s descendent. As strange as it may seem, Zaleria’s father was a black dragon while her mother was a red dragon. That way Zaleria and Morena are sisters even though they are two different kinds of dragons.

Zaleria’s father is a tactician that excels in a calculated fight and creating plans. Her mother on the other hand was a brute force type dragon. It was then that Cain remembered a sentence that Zaleria said in his past life.

“Mother was a calm, kind, and caring woman, but when angered, she was like an erupting volcano.”

Now that Cain knew that Zaleria was a dragon and so did her mother. The sentence that he tough meant that Zaleria’s mother was a bit violent when angered turned into a literal fact. Her mother could have acted like an active volcano and burned everything.

Sofia seems to have taken her blood from Zaleria’s mother, but now after seeing her horn’s up close. She might have taken some from her father as well.

Now that he finished inspecting her horns, he looked at her back and the two big pimple-like things on her back. They were the early form of her draconic wings, slowly growing the stronger her blood became.

Cain then slowly lowered his hand to just above her rear end. He gently felt her tailbone, it was growing longer since she would soon have a draconic tail as well to help in flight.

“Cain, where do you think you touching.” Sofia cried, Hati was right in front of them after all.

“Just checking your tailbone, to see the progress of your draconic features.” That seemed like a legitimate explanation as everyone could see the small horns on her head.

“Kay!” Sofia felt a finger slide into her rear end. Was it because she complained, “Cain…” She turned toward and he smiled.

“Is there a problem?” He asked as he sneaked a second finger in.

Sofia flinched as he tried to stand up, Cain was forced to let go at that point.

“Alice, you come here now, I want to check with you as well.” Cain dragged Alice to his lap. Unlike Alice who gave him her back, Alice sat facing him directly. As her wing will get in the way if she gave him her back.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Alice stuck close to Cain as he started inspecting her head, she could feel something hard bush against her belly. It was a given with the current situation.

As Cain was inspecting her horns, he noticed a scar mark that linked her horns. The scar was so well hidden it was almost impossible to notice without inspecting her scalp.

It only took Cain a few moments to remember where this scar was. It was probably from when he transformed her into a devil. The scar was left when he took some of the ritual Mana to use Misty step and teleport Jack away.

“This scar is from that time…” Cain said as he ran his finger across the scar.

“It doesn’t matter. I did hurt you more than that.” Alice said with a faint smile.

Cain then flipped Alice over and inspected her wings and tail. They were both healthy and in good shape.

Cain then Called Selena to sit on his lap. She immediately jumped in and almost broke his meat stick. “That hurt, be a little bit gentler,” Cain said with a smile as he pushed her away from the chest. Did she grow bigger?

Cain snuck a touch in, to see. He already touched them a lot so he was kind of an expert. Selena didn’t get bigger ones, her chest muscles were the ones growing bigger under the soft part.

For Selena, Cain inspected her teeth for cracks. It would be disastrous if she shattered a fang while biting something. Luckily, her white fangs were as sturdy and as healthy as they can get. Cain even wounded his finger when he accidentally scrapped it on her sharp fang. He then inspected her ears and tails, they were as fluffy as he expected.

Cain then looked at Hati who was giving him a weird look. “Would you mind showing me the base of your tail? I want to see if there is any problem with them.”

“No way, as those girls if you wanted to inspect someone,” Hati replied.

Cain laughed, “Well that’s to be expected. But on a more serious note, come here since I would prefer to know at which rate your tails are disappearing.” Cain talked in a serious tone.

Since the shard was sucking her power and the only showing symptom was her tail shrinking.

After giving him, a sharp glare. Hati stood up and approached him. She sat and gave him her back. Cain slowly inspected her tails and realized that they didn’t have a set speed. The shard consumed more when Hati was active and less when she was resting. Now at the bath, the absorption was too slow.

“What did you find,” Hati asked.

“The shrinking is too slow to tell right now, but they are soft and fluffy, I give you that,” Cain replied.

Hati immediately stood up and smacked him with one head tails on his head. She clearly didn’t put any effort into the hit as it felt like a soft pillow.

Cain was happy that she wasn’t actually angry, she even sat in front of him again. She didn’t seem to mind being naked around him but she was bothered by him touching her.

Cain then dragged all the girls toward him and rested. Enjoying their soft bodies while he had time.

After a while they got out of the bath and had dinner, it was a bit refreshing to eat something that was cooked by the maids again.

Gracie seemed to enter the bath after them, she most likely wasn’t comfortable being naked in front of Hati. Cain asked her how did things go with Amaya. Gracie said that was able to get a basic idea of things to her.

Cain smiled as he gave Gracie a small kiss on the cheek, she has done a great job despite her condition. “That’s an achievement, I’m proud of you.”

Gracie got a strange feeling when she heard his words, ‘was that happiness?’ She thought.

It quickly became time to go to bed, Cain was etching for a good night’s rest and so did the girls. He opened the room door and looked at the window. It was open.

A chilling break was getting in from it so had to close it. They were still in the middle of the winter after all. Sofia walked toward the fireplace and started feeding the flame some logs with her hand.

Cain had already noticed that her horns have grown a tad bit taller earlier in the bath. Seeing her now unfazed with putting her hand inside the flames was impressive. She wasn’t carrying the ember though so she wasn’t immune to fire, she was probably just resistant.

A quick appraisal confirmed that. [Heat Resistance] was a bit special. It allowed her to resist heat. Both low and high. Her being a fire dragon meant that high temperatures and flame can’t hurt her. That also meant she could use her flame to heat herself and resist cold as well.

As Cain was exhausted, he refrained from thinking further and slammed himself on the bed. After a few seconds Selena jumped after him, she didn’t take that long to get in her one-piece nightgown.

Alice stretched her back and released her wings, she needed to stretch them a bit before bed.

Gracie slowly took her maid outfit out, It was always impressive seeing the sheer number of knives she had under her uniform. “Lady Alice, please don’t play with the flames for too long, the smell will stick to you.” Gracie walked toward Sofia.

“I’m not playing. I am trying to make it burn better. That will reduce the smoke.” Sofia replied.

“There is a reason for the chimney to exist,” Gracie said as she turned toward Cain. “Please say something.” She asked Cain.

“Sofia, you’re already starting to have a faint smell of sulfur and pumice just like Zaleria. I don’t want you smelling of charred wood now.” Cain said with a smile.

“I don’t smell like that!” Sofia jumped immediately. She was perplexed at the fact that Cain even mentioned that.

“You just can’t pick up on your own body smell. I promise you that any ranger or druid worth his salt would be able to tell you from other people.” Cain replied as he slighting lifted his head up.

“You forget brimstone-nya, mother even asked me if we were to a volcano and she was extremely worried-nya,” Selena added.

“I also can pick a faint smell,” Alice said with an apologetic face. Gracie was the only one who couldn’t pick the smell up. It wasn’t because she had a bad sense of smell, it’s just that the other three have strong senses.

“But we were just in the bath…”Sofia said with a worried face.

“You don’t have to think about too much, it’s basically what your body smell of now that you’re getting closer to fire dragons.” Cain signaled for her to come to the bed.

“That smell isn’t bad, it just symbolizes your strength.” Cain hugged Sofia and wrestled her to the bed.

Alice and Gracie quickly got in the bed with them. Despite Sofia’s smell, she was warm and soft. “Such an exquisite pillow, never felt something so soft and comfortable,” Cain said with a happy face.

“Take your head from my belly, I’m not a pillow,” Sofia yelled as she started to realize that everyone was using her as a warm pillow.

Since Sofia had refused to let him rest his head on her belly, Cain decided to let it rest a bit down there.

“Take your head from between my legs.” Sofia cried and she tried to crawl back but Cain caught her from her knees and dragged her back.

“You’re not running away, I would have my fun!”
