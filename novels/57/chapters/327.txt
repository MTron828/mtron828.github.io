It wasn’t the same as a true dragon but it was close. The magic escaping Sofia’s body was the closed thing to dragons while not being one that Cain felt. That meant she was higher than drakes and wyverns, she was a half-dragon.

The red scales belonged to red dragons, but the horns on her head said other things. The two big horns pointing forward belonged to black dragons as did her deep green eyes and scattered black scales. That didn’t mean she didn’t have features of red dragons as well, the two thin horns pointing backward as well as the red scales covering her arms and hands.

“What happened to you?” Cain asked as he started smelling his burned hair.

“I let it slip, guess whose mistake it is?” Sofia glared at him, he could see her eyes pulse as if she was about to pounce at him.

“Calm a bit, you’re running his hair.” Alice grabbed her hand with a smile.

Sofia looked at her for a moment before pulling her hand away, “You’re right, I even did it before the time.”

“As you can see-nya, we leveled up a bit-nya!” Selena said with a happy face, Cain could see a smugness on her face.

“After Morena died, someone had to take care of all the remaining undead. We took care of them so we can level up a bit.” Gracie said as fixed Cain’s hair. Burn marks were still apparent so he needed either healing or a haircut.

Cain quickly inspected them all, his eyes opened wide. They caught up to him as he was asleep.

[Hell’s Spawn Resilience: Constitution +2]

[Bewildering Evil: Charisma +3]

‘Alice stayed as a devil, that to be expected as that is already a high race that is compared to dragons and angels. But she seems to have gotten a big bump to her stats.’

Succubus skills:

[Seducing existence] Charisma can’t be lower than 20

‘Even though Gracie is only a half-succubus she still got the 20 charisma…don’t tell me she is controlling that on her own?’ Cain’s thoughts quickly changed, ‘Charisma act with the wielder intention. With how emotionless Gracie is, her charisma will probably help her fade from the people’s eyes, just like an emotionless stone, no one will notice her unless she wants otherwise. That would help her a lot since she fights like an assassin.

Rakshasa’s traits:

[Nimbleness of the Feline: Dexterity +2]

‘Hold up, those aren’t the stats of a Rakshasa. Those creatures are supposed to be nimble, smart, and charismatic with an immense love for wealth. I guess they were also supposed to be tigers but Selena is a black jaguar.’ He never expected Selena to end up as a Rakshasi (Female Rakshasa)

Then Cain turned toward the person with the biggest change. Sofia was glaring at him as if she was about to transform into a dragon and maul him to death.

Half-dragon traits:

[Draconic resilience Red: + 2 constitutions]

[Draconic resilience Black: + 2 constitutions]

[Draconic might Red: +3 strength]

[Draconic might Black: +1 strength

[Red immunity: Fire immunity and Cold resistance]

[Black immunity: Acid immunity and poison Resistance]

‘Why? When, how?’ Cain couldn’t understand where the black came from. Sofia was a descendant of Zaleria who had a black father and a red mother. But Sofia took over Zaleria’s dead red mother. Yet now she also showed black traits, could she be taking over both of Zaleria’s parents? Does this mean that Zaleria’s father died? Cain was sure she said her father was still around and Cain never heard of a half-dragon inheriting two traits.

After thinking for a bit, Cain decided to conclude that Sofia’s black side was weaker than the red since it provided a weaker strength bonus. Even though Sofia is supposed to only get the red bonus.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Why are you staring at me?” Sofia said as she felt Cain’s eyes scan her whole body.

“What choices did you get at level 20?” Cain asked.

“I don’t know, we were supposed to see them together. But thanks to you I ended up like this!” Sofia replied which sparked a new question in Cain’s head. Did she just evolve, right here right now? With such a dramatic change she is supposed to spend at least a few hours asleep.

Alice didn’t evolve and Selena and Gracie only got the equivalent of a stat bump so he can understand an immediate evolution.

Dragons might be crazy but something off was going on here and Cain wanted to investigate it. The problem is that he couldn’t get himself to take Sofia to a lab or experiment on her. ‘I should ask her later if I could take a sample of her blood to track what other things dwell in her blood. Going just by the look and counting on her being a draconic blood sorceress (Witch) is a bit lacking in her case.’

“Let’s get to the bath, otherwise the dinner will get cold,” Alice said as she tried to drag Cain to the bath.

“Won’t they start heating it when we start wearing our clothes? Give a minute, I haven’t given Lexi reliable feedback.” Cain said as he turned toward Lexi.

A vein popped in Alice’s head, “I wasn’t asking!” She grabbed Cain by the hair and started dragging him, since he was a bit heavy on her she got Sofia to help her.

They knew it was alright for Cain to go after the maids so that wasn’t what triggered them. The thing triggering them was how careless Cain was, he says what they expected a sane person to say and then go to do the exact opposite.

‘If you said it’s bad to force her to show her pants and thighs then don’t go staring at her two minutes later. Did something scramble his mind?’ Alice thought.

Soon enough they entered the changing room and Alice dropped Cain to the ground. He looked up at her, “That was painful.” He said with a passive face.

“Don’t worry, we know you’re tougher than you look!” Sofia stared at him as she started taking her clothes off.

Cain’s body floated to orient himself standing. Gracie stared at him “Wasting magic?” she immediately said what was on her mind. [Fly] was a third-tier spell so using it to just stand up was a waste.

“Fly usually consume about 16 MP for a ten minutes duration. I keep the formula up all the time so instead of casting the spell, I can only use what I need. Right now I spent less than 1 MP to stand up which has already been regenerated by my natural MP regeneration.”

“Is that even possible?” Sofia asked, she was interested in any way to make herself stronger.

“Only possible since I have two brains, I use one for magic and one for being myself. I only knew a single person besides me who could do it.” Cain said as he remembered something unpleasant.

“Is it that elf woman Sylph?” Alice asked.

“No, it’s a little half-elf brat-hag. Her name is Lilia and she is a problem.” Cain cringed as he remembered her.

“A brat?” Sofia asked. Cain’s expression didn’t seem to match what he was saying. How could a brat give him such anxiety?

“Yeah, I’m confident in my magic enough to challenge any mage to a duel and win. But not against her, she is a monster!” Cain’s expression made it clear. He hated facing her as much as he hate facing dragons or more.

“If she is a kid then I can kick her across the town-nya,” Selena said as she kicked the air. For a moment Cain imagined Selena kicking Lilia in the face like a ball.

“I would like to see that…but I’m sure we’ll both end up dead before you could touch her.” Cain said with a pained smile.

“Is she really that strong?” Sofia asked.

“A druid tribe once insulted her, calling her a child and a brat. She laughed with them at herself and agreed that she indeed look like a little girl. She then tore the entire village from the ground and flipped it killing the majority! She then turned the survivors into frogs and fed them to her snakes!”

Cain had a pale expression on his face.
