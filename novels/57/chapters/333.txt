“See? Lack of sleep and nutrition, No wonder she is like a toothpick.” Cain bent over Marina and started gently tapping her cheek trying to wake her.

“I’m going to bring some vinegar and garlic, please excuse me!” The maid serving the marina rushed outside.

“Let me handle this, you two sit there and wait,” Alice asked Chad and Cain to move away, from how fast Chad was tapping her, she thought he might start slapping for real.

Alice immediately started using holy healing on Marina even though it might be useless. “Gracie, how do you wake her up?”

Gracie is a maid so she should know how to act. “As that maid did, we usually use vinegar, garlic, or anything with a strong smell. Sometimes just a sprinkle of water can work, and in other times time itself is the only solution.”

“Those won’t work as efficiently, she passed out from stress,” Cain said as he was sitting on Marina’s desk. “Her brain is a bit jumbled up, is the simplest way I can explain it.”

Alice stared at him, “If you know how to act then why haven’t you done so?”

“Needed some time to be sure what happened to her. I was confused between stress and fear. It’s best to use [Dominate Person] to wake her up, as the spell can help stabilize the brain.” Cain said as he waved his hands as if he was about to cast a spell..

“Is that how they work?” Chad stared at him, he knew of the spell’s existence but though it merely controlled people.

“The spell allows you to control a person by giving him orders, to follow those orders he needs to think of his own. Dominate person clear that person’s mind and allow you to control him.” [Dominate Person] Cain cast the spell on Marina and she stood up immediately, “And dispel.” Cain flicked his finger and her body flinched.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“W-wa…” She stared around dumbfounded.

“Are you alright? You suddenly passed out!” Cain waved his hand in front of her face.

Marina was having a slight headache so she sat on her bed and rubbed her eyes. The last thing she remembers is her looking at Chad.

It was then when the maid rushed in with the vinegar and garlic. “My lady you’re awake.”

“Did she have breakfast? Go bring something to eat, meat and eggs are a good start for the day.” Said Chad as he glared at the maid. “Hurry, you can’t leave your lady famished like this!”

The moment the maid structured, Chad used his charisma to get her to move. “I said hurry!” His words rang in her ears as if they were a divine revelation, her body moved on its own.

“It’s fine, I did eat my full this earlier…” Marina said as she received a cup of water from Gracie. Even though she tried to act calm, she was panicking in her head. She had started to realize she passed out in front of Cain, ‘I messed up, what need does he have with a wife like me.’

Marina knew that Cain needed her to rule Ourals in his stead. With what happened today he was mostly going to look for another person.

“No, you need to eat!” Chad glared at her. He has seen Cain’s other wives and none of them was this weak and timid. He fears the wind might blow her up.

“Father, can you let her be for a bit?” Cain finally interfered, “She can’t eat over what is used to immediately. You need time to change her diet.”

“I know, but she needs to take the first step. It’s not like people can’t change, they refuse to start changing. If you ever thought of something to be hard then just start doing it and it will get easier.” Chad looked up as he remembered an old friend.

“I knew of a merchant, a friend of mine that traded potions. That job was lucrative so he gained a lot of weight over the years. When we met his wife ridiculed him, she compared him to me who stayed the same. From that day he started working out, started by lifting bottles of water, and then buckets of sand, walking instead of riding carriages, and helping his workers carry the cargo. After two years he had returned to his former self.”

Chad looked up at Marina. “Even if it’s only an extra bite today, with time it will show effect. Never give up, that is the strength of humans.”

“Such words of wisdom and a touching story, but she is full and we don’t have time. She can start eating at lunch.” Cain said as he helped Marina stand.

ɴ[0)ᴠᴇʟ “Fine, just feed her well,” Chad replied.

Cain looked around, everyone seemed ready. Let’s head out then. Cain opened an arcane gate and they went back to Ourals. The maids in the keeping ended up eating the extra meal that was prepared.

…

In Cain’s mansion, Sofia and Gracie were waiting in their casual clothes. This was the first time in a while they weren’t going to fight. Amaya was with them as well because she wanted to tag along.

This was the first time Marina walked into Cain’s house, the first time she ever used the arcane gate in fact. Each step she took inside made her heart race and her back sweat.

“It’s wonderful!” Marina gasped as they passed through the arcane gate and into Cain’s mansion.

“Master, Sebas wanted me to tell you that the carriage is waiting in front of the gate.” The woman wearing a maid outfit froze in place as she saw Marina’s face.

Even Marina stared at her, “Roberta? I heard you died in a mission.” Marina gasped. She was one of the soldiers that used to guard her.

“Ro…Yeah that’s me, Roberta, I didn’t die but was captured here. Since I didn’t return they assumed I died.” Roberta replied.

“So you used to guard her? That’s a part I didn’t know about.” Cain glared at Marina.

“Well…The lady was restricted by her father so I wasn’t guarding her, I was keeping her in place.” Roberta replied.

Cain made a thinking face for a moment, what is the best use for Roberta? “Keep following Sebas’s orders for today. From tomorrow I am giving you armor and a weapon. Your job will be the personal guard for Marina, and you know what will happen if she lost a hair strand.” Cain glared at Roberta.

“No, no! I would dare let that happen, please count on me.” Roberta bowed deeply. She knew the extent of Cain’s strength and she wasn’t intending on displeasing him.

Marina’s eyes lit up, even though Roberta was her jailer. She often helped her sneak into the garden and smuggled sweets to her.

After everyone has gathered they rode the carriage toward the church where they found a nun awaiting them.

The nun gave the carriage a strange look, a cat girl was sitting at the top while a large man was driving it with the hero. She suspected the remaining are inside the carriage.

When she saw Cain standing with his five wives she couldn’t help but give him a weird look. Especially to a person like her, this was blasphemy beyond belief.

“May the land’s mother blesses you, please follow me.”

The nun said with a smile.
