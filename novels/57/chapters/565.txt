Cain flew into the sky, glaring at the vast city of Dis. Now a quarter of it has been demolished by his last [Meteor Fall]

Iron walls as long as the eye can see, thousands upon thousands of devils hiding in the copper-colored building of red-hot iron. The streets seemed to move as if they were alive, the molten metal they are built on still bubbled. In the middle of the large metropolis, the Iron fortress of Dispater stood tall, with its shadow cast upon the ceiling like dusty clouds, hordes of fiends walked out of its front gate ready to rampage.

Cain quickly landed in front of the city gate, making sure to protect his feet from the glowing iron he is standing on. "Who are you? Stop right there!" A devil shouted and approached Cain, he was one of the gate guards.

"It's me, Dispater," Cain replied as naturally as he could.

The devil guard wasn't buying it at all, he pulled his spear thrusting at Cain immediately. Thud! Cain grabbed the devil by the head [Touch of Dispater]

The devil's body immediately turned into an iron statue falling on the ground. Cain glared at the other guards with a scornful gaze, "You pathetic devils, brainwashed so easily. Can none of you remember me, shall I turn the whole city into rusted iron?" He growled and the devils took a step back.

He looked so different yet that ability belongs to Dispater, the devils thought about it when one of them spoke rushing toward Cain.

"I do, I do my lord‚Ä¶how we could forget you." He smiled rubbing his hands together with a forced smile, Cain could sense his fear. This devil certainly didn't remember him, he was just playing the role, thinking he is the strange one.

Cain glared at him, and grabbed him by the head, "You dare lie to my face, and speak the truth!" All the devils shook, it was Dispater's mind-reading ability, this was definitely him.

"I do not remember you. Please spare me, my lord." The devil cried in fear.

"Tell me how do I look to you? What do you remember me as?" Cain growled.

The devil went to vaguely describe Dispater, then describe Cain who was standing before him.

"I see, I do look vastly different." Cain let the devil go and looked at the one he turned into an iron statue. With a single touch, he turned him back.

"I did change a bit, and you were under the great magic of our invader. As Tiamat was absent lately, they managed to slip through." Cain opened his arms, "But fear not, I eliminated the threat and got the dragon queen on her throne. None shall disturb us." He declared.

The two devils looked up at him, as did all the rest‚Ä¶Cain walked toward the gate and they immediately opened her for him.

Groaning like a lion's roar, the unoiled doors cracked open slowly and Cain walked into the iron city of Dis with all the devils terrified of him. He wanted to hurry toward the iron fortress as the gate to the third layer in underneath it but‚Ä¶

He has never been to this place before, only knowing about it from books and Scrying spells. He should at least walk to the fortress and experience walking inside a burning forge.

Devils walked in and out of the iron building, trading in flesh and slaves. Saying that but it was mostly slaves, as those were sinners whom devils used for food. They cried, and growled in agony as their feet, knees, and faces got fried on the ground, none of the devils batted an eye as if they were but cow mooing.

As he walked, one of the slaves broke free rushing toward him. She screamed, "It's you! The one at the cave‚Ä¶"She fell face first on the red-hot ground scorching her chest and cheeks.

When Cain stared closely at her‚Ä¶he can bet he saw her in someplace before‚Ä¶after running through his memories for a moment he remembered. She is the rogue who tried to deceive them at Ourals mine. 'How did she end up here?' Cain wandered, he didn't know she would end up this low.

'She tasted bad, I threw her down here with a lot of other sinners. Humans, demi-humans, cubus, and even some halflings.' Morena replied with a proud voice. 'That was a mistake, the lower you get, the more suffering you will suffer.'

Cain lifted the rogue with [Telekinesis] he want to heal her but he can't do that with [Lesser Healing] in front of all the devils.

Speaking about them, the slaver freaked out seeing one of his slaves reach to the one and only Dispater, she was going to get him ironed. "You little! Forgive me, my lord, I will make sure she never‚Ä¶" He rushed toward Cain.

"No, where did you get all those slaves?" Cain growled.

"Of course. They are the ones who dropped from the Avernus. The lower devils still find their flesh pleasing so I was selling them as they resurrect." The slaver replied.

Cooked alive, butchered, and then eaten, and repeat in an endless cycle. This is hell, sinners beware.

"They seem useful as alchemical ingredients, I will be taking them all." Cain flicked his finger and all of the sinners started floating.

"But, lord Dis‚Ä¶" Cain turned the slave merchant into an iron statue immediately, this was hell and he didn't care. This is the only way the people here will respect you.

With how hell works, a lot of the people here are willing to take risks and bet. They will always resurrect and they are suffering anyway, death in fact gives them a moment of joy, a moment of relief. But in the middle of all of that, Dispater's ability come into play.

"I should throw you in the molten river, there you should learn how to speak," Cain growled. The statues are still alive, they can see, hear and feel everything as if they were perfectly fine. They could still feel the pain of being burned.

As Cain was about to kick the man to the molten river, a woman devil approached him with a terrified face. "Please do spare him." She only said those words bowing down.

Cain glared at her, he doesn't know her. The way she was acting was a bit strange.

"Do I know you?" He stared at her, she flinched, her knees shaking.

"Yes my lord, we've met once before." She said with a slow voice.

"Why should I let him go?" Cain asked keeping an eye on her.

"Because he is feeding half of the lower-devil slums, we need him." She replied.

"And I need a torture toy, from your voice I say you scream well. Care to come with me?" Cain asked seeing how she will react.

She bowed deeply, "Do as you please, it will be my pleasure." He sensed some shadow magic coming from her body, she was a shadow devil.
