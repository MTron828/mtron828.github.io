Mary searched her head for an answer, she know that she wasn’t supposed to see what she saw. But why didn’t the maid stop her, she was sure that it was okay for her to join.

“Zaleria said that she was getting in so I followed her,” Mary said quickly shifting the blame to the woman who got with her. “Even if that was true, why would a woman join a man’s bath? It’s weird no matter how I look at it.” Cain wasn’t buying her excuses.

“I agree with you that’s weird, but we do have a mixed bath in this city, it’s not that uncommon. I was just trying to blend in the party.” Mary said almost crying, Cain wasn’t taking her words seriously. Saying she wanted to blend with the party was as good as a lie to him.

“You brought her here grandma? Who even let you in so you can bring her with you?” Sofia growled looking at Zaleria, this was a grave problem as they might have to kill Mary so she won’t spread the words of Alice being a devil.

“Hey you say something, why didn’t you stop us?” Zaleria looked back at Gracie who just entered behind them. “Master didn’t oppose so I didn’t say anything.” The blame quickly returned to Cain, was this really his mistake.

‘Killing Mary would be bad, I need her alive, and hiding her death would be a nightmare.’ Cain turned toward Zaleria, “You can use slave bind, right? Bind her to not speak a word of what she saw or heard today. Make sure to put it so the information can’t leak in any form or shape.”

“Sorry but you seem to be mistaken, I know nothing of slavery magic.” Zaleria shook her hand, her expression was genuine.

Cain gave her a look of doubt, he knew for sure she can. In fact, she was a master at it. The reason he asked for a specific type of bind spell is that she can do it.

“I don’t have any more empty spots neither do them, you’re the only one who could do it,” Cain said and Zaleria gave him a strange look.

She can see a black and golden link between him and Alice. But there was a second link coming from his body, it was white and green and extended into the distance. There was a different taste of magic in it. Zaleria reached with her hand to touch the link.

Cain noticed her intent and screamed, “Don’t…!” Zaleria didn’t listen and took the thread in her hand.

It was just for a moment but the link that was only between Cain and Sylph now extended to Zaleria. She felt like her body was swept by a violent cold current. The violent surge of Mana rushing from the other side blinded her vision and she woke up in an empty black land.

“Who dares to touch the link between Master and me?” Hearing the booming voice Zaleria turned around.

CRACKLE! The earth shattered and thick wooden veins rushed out, extending in the blink of an eye like a volcano erupting. Taking the form of a titanic tree with an unlimited number of branches. A single elf woman was sitting on a throne on the tree trunk and she looked down.

putting a leg on to of the other, resting her head on her arm. She gazed down at Zaleria with a pity stare. The branches emitted bright light as Sylph’s red eyes gazed down.

Even though Zaleria wanted to speak, she wasn’t able to do so. This wasn’t a place she had freedom in, neither Cain nor Sylph had consented for her to get in after all.

“An intruder, I see. This is your last chance.” With Sylph’s words, Zaleria found herself back in the bath and Cain was still in the middle of screaming “…touch it”

Zaleria took a step backward to assess the situation, She was a master of Slavery magic and she know this phenomenon. It’s called bind pull, It’s when two slavers fight over the dominion of a single slave, it’s usually used to free slaves from unwanted or illegal slavery.

What scared her the more is that was easily bested, who was that elf woman. Zaleria could swear that Cain was the owner of the bind, so why was she contested with elf woman, she was clearly the slave. Did she enslave herself to him?

Another thing that boggled her mind. That tree she saw was no ordinary tree. The world tree Yggdrasil was easily recognizable. Zaleria looked at Cain with a shocked face, why does he have such a monster enslaved? If that thing was unleashed, even if she teamed out with her sister they wouldn’t be able to lay a hand on her.

“Who is she?” Zaleria mumbled and Cain gave her a sharp glare. ~I will explain later, for now, don’t mention her~

“Yeah, she works for the guild. We can’t have her go. I will take care of it immediately.” Zaleria immediately waved her hand and bright light engulfed the bath.

“Did you finish?” Cain asked, Zaleria nodded, “You can let her go now.”

As Cain and the girls left Mary to go, she fell to her knees in shock. She got herself into a big predicament. “Cover yourself, Alice picked up the towel and gave it to her.” Mary silently took it, staring at Cain with twitching eyes.

“You too!” Sofia threw a towel to Zaleria, she immediately threw it back. “I don’t want it!”

“Leave her alone, Zaleria is a special case. With her strength, she can do what she wants.” Cain said as he splashed back into the water, his mood has been muddied.

Zaleria gave him a pained laugh, “As if I will, you’re much scarier than I thought!” She jumped back into the water. She knew that she can do nothing to him as long as that mysterious elf girl was bounded to him, if she tried to push him too far she will intervene and it will become a blood bath.

“Can I say something?” Mary gathered her courage to speak, The girls glared at her as if they wanted her life but Cain sighed. “Can you all do me a favor and calm for now?” He looked at them, “If you say so-nya!” Selena immediately shifted gears and returned to her laid-back attitude.

“Well, of course, you don’t even need to ask.” Alice as well-rested her head on Cain’s shoulder.

Sofia on the other hand gave Cain a pained look for a moment before putting on a smile. “Fine, It’s just that I can’t seem to take it well.” Cain thought it was reasonable as one was her grandmother.

“Speak.” He looked at Mary, “You had something to say…”

Mary looked at him in silence for a moment before opening her mouth, “I’m really sorry for this shameful display, I was just trying to deepen our relationship. Please forgive my actions.”

“I don’t really care, you instead need to be apologizing to them.” Cain patted Alice and Sofia on the head. Selena didn’t mind other girls butting in but those two might.

“I say it’s more an offense to them than me, I might even dare say, thanks for the treat…OW!” Sofia and Alice pinched his sides, and they both gave him a scary grin.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“See, clear the misunderstanding with them, I will excuse myself out now.” Cain stood out with Selena in tow, It was her turn after all.

“I guess I will get out as well…” Zaleria tried to stand by Sofia dragged her back in, “We have a long talk as well, Grandma.” Her eyes were scary, a shiver ran down Zaleria’s spine.

Cain stopped mid-way. “You come as well, I have a long talk with you.” Gracie stood out and followed after Cain as per his order.

After a short while, the three of them were in Cain’s room, Cain and Selena setting on the bed while Gracie stood there waiting.
