Chapter 485 Tears of Steel II

“I don’t expect that she is evil, with such power she could just mind-controlled us. She wants something and I want to know it first.” Cain said sitting on the bed.

“Hiding her stat doesn’t necessarily mean she is an expert at mind control, Lilia always said that powerful abilities don’t make a master,” Farryn said.

“Not everyone can master every school of magic like her, the shorty is a mage, a witch, a necromancer, an abjurer, a blaster, a diviner, a curse user, and even has cleric and paladin magic. Don’t compare us to her.” Cain sighed.

“You’re pretty much like her, but lack the firepower and the ridicule over-the-top spells.”

“Let’s stop talking about her and focus on Mary.”

“I’m still with the idea of beating the truth out of her, I doubt she can match us all combined,” Zaleria growled.

“Hold up grandma. What if all of this is just a mistake? You can’t just go beat her like that.” Sofia interrupted her.

“Sofia is right, it would probably be better if we found a way to solve it peacefully. Can’t we confront her directly?” Alice said.

“Don’t think that will work, otherwise those three won’t be discussing it like this,” Hati said staring at them. “(There is a reason why you called us here.)” Skoll added, using Hati’s head to glare at Cain.

“We need to get Jella back to the mortal world first, after that we will get back here and start a slaughter festival. In that, I will force Mary into a situation where she will surely die.” Cain said.

“And since she isn’t normal, she will find a way out of the situation. You will use that to try and guess her skill.” Farryn said.

“And then create counter spells and measures to confront her. Sound nice to me.” Zaleria said smiling.

“Then why did you call us three here? You could have just called Farryn and Zaleria.” Alice asked.

“That would be strange, and there is another thing I wanted to ask you specifically to do.” Cain looked at Alice.

“What is it? You could have just had me do it.” Alice smiled.

“I want you to start trying to influence Mary and see her reaction,” Cain said with a grin.

“Want her to do what devils do best, create problems.” Farryn smiled as well.

“Your goal is to get me to divorce everyone except you and her, this is sure to throw whatever she is aiming for in a loop,” Cain said with a smile.

“Tonight was your plan to break Sofia by bringing her grandmother to the bedroom. Convinced me to leave Selena out, and you’re the reason Gracie is acting again.” Cain then looked at Sofia.

“I want to start acting a bit annoyed and angry, make visible that you’re unsatisfied with the current situation. Also try and abuse your power as the first wife, especially against Mary.”

“I understand, but you need to inform Gracie and Selena first.” Sofia smiled.

“Then why did you call me?” Hati looked at him with a puzzled face.

“If it came to it and we had to fight Mary, I doubt we can take her on with my regular sword. At that time I want you to hand me the Eternal sword. So you have to stay at my side all the time.”

Hati pouted hearing his words, “You want the sword for free?”

“Want me to pay?” Cain gave her a weird look. “The sixth place is mine, I won’t compromise.” She glared at him.

Upon looking at Sofia and Alice. The two nodded, “We’ve already discussed such a thing before. Gracie didn’t care, Selena was with the idea and Marina said that as long as you accept she is fine.” Alice said with a smile.

“She’s right, the same goes for Isbert. And about Farryn…we don’t know.” Sofia looked at Farryn.

Farryn blinked two when being asked, why her name was brought. “I usually hate humans, but if Lady Sylph said that she likes you, I won’t say I oppose anything.”

“So when you earlier said you don’t want to do it…”

“That was to keep a front as he was doing. Did you really expect me to come here determined to become his slave and then refuse a night?” Farryn gave them a puzzled look.

“I’m also genuine here, I have a feeling that I would have already made a move if Sofia wasn’t already with you.” Zaleria gave them a smug look.

“Grandma…”

“What? Just look at him…he’s just too cute, like a white fluffy rabbit.” Zaleria stared at her.

Cain gave her a wry smile. Remembering the days he spent with her in his past life.

He was her slave so she had her way with him, not that he minded. Each day, each night, in the morning and evening. She was that active.

Cain sat on the bed sighing, “Now that we finished discussing, do any of you have an idea before we go to sleep?” Cain looked around.

“Can we do it before?” Hati glared at him.

“No, want Zaleria and Farryn to just sit and watch?” Cain stared at her.

“Why not?” She replied, “(You’re going too much, slow down Hati)”

“Why don’t you just let them join?” Alice said with a passive face.

“What are you saying?” Sofia turned toward her.

“I mean, Farryn is his slave just like me. Zaleria is also someone we can trust a lot. To be honest, I feel better about Zaleria doing it with Cain than Hati.” She smiled at Sofia.

“This isn’t the time to start trying to break everything, save that for Mary. Zaleria is my grandmother.” Sofia growled.

“Technically she isn’t, there are hundreds of years between you. And since you got her mother’s magic, we can’t even know if you can be related at all.” Alice stated.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“We do look alike,” Sofia said with an exhausted face, having to state the obvious.

“Let’s ignore that, it’s just coincidence. Don’t you think so?” She stared at Zaleria.

“No, we definitely look a lot alike,” Zaleria replied immediately.

“Cain, say something?” Alice looked at him.

“Why me? I’m busy here.” Cain was busy trying to fend Hati off.

“Come on you two. Didn’t Cain already ride Zaleria?” She said and Sofia froze in her place.

“What do you mean by ride?”

“I read in a book in our library that riding a dragon was a sign of acceptance. The relationship between a dragon and his rider is always marriage, and the dragon is always submissive.” Alice stated what she read and Zaleria almost punched her.

As she dodged, Alice kept talking, “She allowed him to ride her, which means she doesn’t intend on opposing him in any way. In a sense, she already opened herself to him long ago.”

Thud! Zaleria caught the smiling Alice, “Care to shut up?” Glaring at her.

“Come on admit it!”

“Hey Cain, did you have to tell her to start acting like a devil? Could I smack her?”

“You will kill her, so no,” Cain replied. Zaleria immediately dropped Alice.

“See?” Alice said with a smile.

Zaleria stopped in her place, about to snap at her but Sofia managed to catch her. “Grandma, calm down!”

Alice giggled, “Is this good Cain?” She looked at him.

“As expected from a devil, you can really get under someone’s skin.” Cain smiled.

“All of this was an act?” Zaleria gasped.

“Yeah, and I seem to have done well.” Alice smiled.

Zaleria snapped, “But you little…let’s see if you can follow with your words.” She growled.
