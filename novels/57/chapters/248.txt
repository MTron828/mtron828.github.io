“They are going at it, those two shouldn’t have a problem. Well, Sofia might run out of MP so I need to keep an eye on her.” Said Alice who was standing beside Alen.

“You’re awfully calm. She might be dead in the blink of an eye if that happened.” Alen said.

“Zaleria would tear the place apart if a single knife got close to wounding her. I’m more worried about Selena, she is taking some hits.” Alice said as she extended her hand toward Selena and used her aura to heal her from afar.

“Long rang healing? You’re William’s daughter right, where did you learn that?” Alen asked.

“That a trade secret, not even father knows so I won’t be telling you as well.” She replied with a smile. She cannot tell him she was a true devil. The most Alen know is that she was sick with a powerful cure and that Cain healed her.

“Beware!” Alen screamed as he saw a man fly toward them with a pair of black wings. “An incubus, those disgusting monsters,” Alen growled as he extended his staff.

[Magic Missile] Multiple dots of pure white magic flew from the tip of his staff toward the incubus. The monster dodged them all and drew his sword aiming at Alen’s head.

“Kid, know your place!” Alen yelled with a smile.

[Telekinesis] Alen suspended the incubus mid-air and squeezed his body with an invisible force. “You, this…” The incubus growled. But before he could finish, Alen smacked him on the ground multiple times.

“Sweeetyyy!” A woman hugged Alen from behind. A succubus had managed to sneak up on him. His mind started to slowly blank from her charm, he collected the last of his will in an attempt to blast her away with a spell.

[Thunder…] He slowly started to lose the will to fight.

“Can you leave him alone?” This time the succubus felt a hand grab her hair. The moment she looked behind, two eyes were looking at her. A bright red one and a golden one.

“Die!” The succubus quickly spun around and slashed with her dagger.

Alice quickly twisted her body and dodged the slash effortlessly. It was as if she knew the attack was coming. Cain has told her before to watch her opponent’s movements and respond accordingly.

[Sacred flames] Alice’s touch caused the succubus’s body to burst into golden flames. ‘It’s annoying to have to touch people to be able to deliver some spells at full force. This should be enough to kill her.’ Even though the sacred flame was just a first-tier spell, Alice was confident it was enough. Since she added some spice to it.

“Do you think such a thing will kill me!” The succubus growled as the fire quickly faded.

“Rest in peace!” Alice waved at her with a smile.

The succubus pulled a throwing knife and tried to shoot it at Alice. When she swung her arm, nothing came.

Surprised, the succubus looked at her right arm. She was missing her hand. Her flesh looked blue and her blood was dark. The succubus’s vision blacked as her body fell apart.

“A bad apple spoils the bunch, is the say right?” Alice had used the spell [Sacred flames] as camouflage to infect the succubus’s Mana with her cursed magic. That small amount will absorb the succubus’s MP, inflate and quickly destroy her body from the inside in moments.

Quick, painless as it destroys the nerves first, and most importantly, she can blame it on the fiends being weak to holy magic.

Alice looked around her to face the remaining Cubuses. She was starting to get worried that she might need to transform to be able to deal with them. She was a level 13 devil, she was far stronger than a bunch of 8~12 level Cubus. That was a rough estimate given by her wisdom. She has a hunch. She could tell that they were weaker than her.

She could easily read their movement by using her devil instinct and wisdom. Their strongest weapon, charm, is useless against her as well.

Yet she had multiple limitations to her power now. When she is in her human form, she can’t deliver a large amount of cursed magic from a distance, since it will be obvious. Her human shell hindered her power and flexibility.

For example, in her devil form, she can deliver up to 8 cursed magic damage per second and heal for the same amount. But in her human form, she can only go up to a max of 3 damage per second before the cursed aura around her will give her identity. Holy magic wasn’t a problem though.

I need to be careful to not use too much-cursed magic. “What is that girl’s problem? Our charm does not affect her and anyone she touched has died immediately.” One of the incubi screamed as he saw his friend fall apart.

“Even though she is wearing armor she doesn’t seem that strong physically. It has to be some kind of magic, be careful. Hit her from long range and don’t get close.” Another screamed as he charged a fireball, and another one charged a lightning strike.

Alice braced herself, without her wings she doesn’t have the speed to dodge. Alen was out so he can’t use magic to protect her, she had to take the hit and heal quickly.

Alice quickly condensed her aura around her skin to protect herself as much as she could. That had made her body glow with a faint golden light.

“Whatever you’re doing, there is no escape from this!” One of the incubi screamed as he saw her.

The two spells flew toward Alice at a tremendous speed, the two lights flashed as they approached her.

Thwack! Suddenly, something smacked the fireball and sent it back at the incubus, the lightning strike got dissipated with a single hit.

“You don’t seem to learn a lesson, when you only focus on charm your other spells become weak!” When Alice looked in front of her, she saw that silver fur.

“Don’t Hati, you haven’t fully recovered,” Alice yelled at her.

“That doesn’t matter (That doesn’t matter)!” Both Hati and Skoll spoke at the same time, which made them sound creepy.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Those fools have helped the dragon who killed mother (I can’t wait to tear them apart)!” Hati walked toward them with her body faintly glowing. It was almost impossible to distinguish who said what.

“You’re the beast god’s daughter!” One of the incubi yelled.

“I never knew you lot think with your heads (I’m sick of their smell so let’s tear them apart immediately)” Skoll and Hati were about to start fighting.

Hati stood in front of Alice. She only had one tail. Then instantly another eight popped from her back.

“That skinny mage did help us after all (I don’t care he stole it)!” Their voice grew louder. Skoll was nourishing the shard inside Hati, which caused the twin to lose a lot of power and stability. That was the main reason Hati only had one tail.

She could force herself to manifest them all but she will get exhausted quickly. Now that the shard’s burden was lifted, she has gained the power of her sister as well.

The twin in a single body could manifest all of the nine tails at once without much effort.

Her nine tails twisted, and each of them pointed at one of the fiends.

“I will vent some steam on you fools (It’s my turn now)!” Hati stood in her place.
