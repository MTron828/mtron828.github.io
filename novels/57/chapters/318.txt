Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Morena did a backward flip landing on her feet [Acid Burst] from her hand a wave of acid pushed forward.

Thud! The angel took the front swinging her blade down. [Divine Slash] Splitting the wave in half.

“It’s a wave!” Morena smiled as the two sides of the wave fell down [Acid control] in an instant, the acid started moving like water in a sink.

When Zaleria looked around, death knights were swimming toward them. She could only hope that everyone could withstand the acid like her but having those death knights is another problem.

Flash! Carrying Alice in her back, Sofia blitzed toward Morena. Alice was fast on her wings, but not as a max-speed Sofia.

[Dawn] [Dusk] Alice hammered Morena with two of her strongest spells at the same time. A pillar of light and a cloud of dark fume engulfed her.

Zaleria too that chance to blast all the acid away with a [Destructive wave] as the acid was pushed away, it appeared that the angel protected everyone else with a holy barrier.

“Hold up, did you leave them?” Zaleria growled as she realized that the angel purposely didn’t protect Alice and Sofia who were carrying her.

“I did protect them but that devil melted the shield with her curse.” The angel yelled as she flew toward Morena.

“It’s the rain, you dragon can you blow the cloud away? (Her name is Zaleria you dumbass, at least try remembering the names of those who saved your skin)” Hati yelled and Skoll mocked her.

“I can!” Zaleria shifted back to her dragon form and flew to the sky. Hati was right, the acid rain empowered the undead including Morena. The reason all the death knights and lichs around them were so weak in that Morena was sucking all of their power to herself.

“I won’t let you!” Morena pushed everyone and flew behind Zaleria with a roar. Transforming into her large draconic form will just make her a bigger target for that angel but it was worth the risk to stop Zaleria.

As she tried to transform she failed, something was latching to her leg. When she looked down, a black jaguar was munching on her legs.

“Get away from me!” Morena yelled as she kicked Selena down.

Swoosh! Sofia flew as fast as she could and cut Morena’s way just before she could transform. “Get down!” Sofia kicked her with [Fire storm]

Alice looked up toward the falling Morena. She seems to have wounded Sofia’s leg but sadly that was less important. ‘We can’t keep pushing him more than this. Our MP alone isn’t enough to handle all of this spamming.’ That was right, up to this point they were using Cain’s Mana. Even if he was unconscious, the power he still provided his wives was more than anyone could ask for.

[Hallow] [Divine Word: Stabilize] Alice tried to combine both her decay curse magic and holy magic into one blast. The decay will weaken Morena and the holy magic will burn her bones. That was the plan.

Thud! The angel landed beside her, “Your body won’t be able to withstand such pressure alone. I will handle the holy part so only provide curse.”

“Only I can combine them!” Alice yelled as she kept pushing her plan ahead.

“Listen, I participated in the ancient devil and angel war, I’ve seen such a thing happens over and over. Let’s finish this now!” the angel yelled as she branded her sword, she could provide better and more stable holy magic than Alice could ever hope to achieve at her level.

Alice wasn’t stupid to keep pushing her own ideals and started cooperating with the angel.

As Alice slowly shifted to only using curse magic, her body felt relaxed. Her magic flowed faster and quicker, using both at the same time was really hindering her output.

Both holy magic and curse magic flowed together but never mixed. Just like water and oil, they never mix but can be forced together temporarily with a bit of shacking.

The spell wasn’t as complicated as it seems, Alice was using an overcharged [Dusk] spell while the angel used [Dawn] the spell [Hallow] was to send the mix flying toward Morena while [Divine Word: Stabilize] was so the holy magic won’t try and devour the curse magic.

For a weird reason, holy magic was actively going after curse magic trying to erase it, while curse magic only fled from it. No human was going to compline since that meant erasing curses was easier with holy magic.

As Alice realized that and with her knowledge that holy magic can harm just like a curse by reversing the healing process or hastening it, a blasphemous idea crossed her mind. ‘Is curse magic a derivative of holy magic? What is the relation between devils and angels then?’

BAAM! Zaleria blasted the sky with her breath causing the acidic clouds to fade away. At that moment Alice and the angel blasted Morena’s body with their magic.

‘Fine, I will give you this hit.’ Morena thought as her bones started to disintegrate. She wasn’t worried as she still had enough magic in her phylactery for another body. She would spawn there and run away.

As she opened her eyes back into the depth where her lair, she found herself laying on the ground. “I should have put the phylactery on a pedestal or something…”She scratched her head, it was then that a kick landed on her face.

Looking up Morena saw the underskirt of a maid, it was impressive how many knives were tucked around her garter belts.

“That you, this cave is just a big dark maze and I would have never crossed it in time if not for your help.” Chad thanked Gracie who helped him teleport through the dark cave with her shadow magic and avoid all the traps and monsters.

“Who-who are you?” Morena growled, she has never seen this girl before.

“Gracie, master Cain’s personal Headmaid. I didn’t get the chance to fight you last time it seems.” Gracie moved her foot from Morena’s face and gave a graceful bow. At that moment her body melted into shadows.

Before Morena could even react, Gracie teleported her hand directly inside Morena’s chest and grabbed the Phylactery pulling it out. The entire cave was dark so it was the shadow’s free real estate.

“You bitch!” Morena growled, she didn’t expect such a harmless-looking maid to be able of such a thing. She was right, Gracie didn’t have the speed or reaction time to contend with Morena, she only managed that with the element of surprise and the broken nature of her magic.

Morena rushed toward Gracie who was unable to react. THUD! Chad grabbed Morena’s hand and stared at her, “What did you call my son’s wife you bitch?” He slapped her lower jaw off.

Morena stared at him for the blink of an eye, how could a man exhibit such strength? His raw strength is closer to that of Zaleria yet felt more intimidating.

BAM! BAM! Chad swung her body around and smacked her on the wall a couple of times. As Morena realised that this man was possibly more dangerous than Zaleria since he had more coordination in his attacks. She decided to eat it and try blowing the whole place out with a breath. Even if the whole cave collapsed, she could still dig herself out in a couple of weeks.

A massive acidic breath started charging in her throat. Chad realized that so he grabbed her neck and smashed it in his palm.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Dropping her body to the ground, Chad lifted his foot. [Banishing Smite] He stomped her chest down preventing the breath from even forming.

CRACK! They heard a weird sound and both looked toward Gracie. She had a stupid look on her face as she held Morena’s smashed phylactery in her hand.

“Sorry, I didn’t expect it to break…” Gracie apologized.
