Klara dimmed the light by turning the magical lights down, leaving on the faint light emitted by the fireplace. She then took a seat close to Mary and put one leg on top of the other.

“What?” Mary looked at her.

“Nothing, I just want to enjoy the show,” Klara replied.

“I see…Why?” Mary glared at her, she only wanted a conversation to keep her busy.

…

Cain started slowly stripping Marina, to his surprise, he stopped halfway confused at what she was wearing. He saw some overly complicated noble clothes but this was on another level.

“How do you take this off?” Cain asked looking at the twin maids.

“Well, you first unlock half the knots at the back, which will release the belt going to her garter belt, that thing is linked with a strap all the way over her shoulders and connected to the underside of her bra to lift it up.” One of the twins explained.

“Sister you forget to mention that he needs to undo the knot on her left to be able to access the garter belt.” The other twins corrected her.

Cain glared at them, “I see. Who’s the smart one who thought this was a nice thing to wear?”

“It was her,” Both maids pointed at Marina.

“I thought you might like it…” She looked sad.

“Believe me, you don’t need to do this much to impress me. A simple and clean one-piece dress, clean skin with not much makeup, and tidy hair are all you need.” Cain said.

“You don’t like noble clothes?” Marina asked.

“Well, they make women look like artichokes, no matter how much you peel, there is always an underlayer.” Cain looked really concerned.

The twin maids giggled, “Which type of clothes do master like?” They asked at the same time.

Cain stopped to think about it for a moment, all the girls opened their ears, this was premium knowledge. Especially Mary which wanted to get the information for Hati.

“My preferred clothes…that must be the maid’s uniform,” Cain said surprising everyone. In their eyes, that uniform wasn’t that special. Noble hated it in fact since it’s meant for labor and work.

“What do you like about it?” Marina asked. She was genuinely curious. This might help her get the Taylors to make her the perfect dress.

Cain casually pulled Klara from her seat with telekinesis toward him.

“Hey, what are you doing?” She asked staring at him.

“Can I use you to show them?” Cain asked.

“You already pulled me off, what did you expect me to say no?” Klara growled since Cain already started showing her uniform off.

“Let’s start with the colors, it’s simple white and black. Nothing to exercise or overbearing.” Cain explained waving his hand on Klara’s shoulders.

“It also might look simple but upon closer look, the skirt is filled with pockets for carrying bits and pieces which make it practical.” Cain grabbed Klara’s hips with his hands.

With a quick move, he flipped her to the side to show what was under her skirt. She clearly didn’t like that and grabbed him by the face.

“See the garter belt underneath complementing the thigh-high stoking and the panties like a platinum crown.” Cain kept explaining anyway which caused Klara to tighter her grip until he let her down.

“You need to pay me back for that!” she growled at him.

Cain kissed her on the forehead, “I will make sure to do it, just set your number.” Cain whispered in her ear.

“No…this is enough.” She said in a quiet voice, the sudden kiss was all she asked for. There was already a river passing under hear. Cain had 20 charisma after all. Even if he was restraining it, it still had a slight effect.

She silently walked away and sat where she was before.

“We’re getting sidetracked, let’s get down to it.” Cain kissed Marina while he grabbed her clothes. A simple spell was enough to teleport all of her clothes to the corner of the room except the thigh-high stocking. He preferred them on.

Cain started riling Marina up with his fingers while having one of the twins use their mouths on his meat.

After a short moment, suddenly, Cain emptied his first load in one of the twins’ mouths. He pushed as deep as he can into her throat multiple times until he was satisfied.

This was also meant to help Marina over her shy nature so Cain chose the position wisely.

He laid on the bed and sat her on top of him with her back facing his face. He kept her legs apart showing everything to Mary and Klara.

Marina tried to curl into a ball but the maids stopped her immediately. Cain grabbed her bosom with both his hands and started going to town. Thrusting as hard as he could keeping her in mind, she couldn’t help but quickly forget the onlooker and started moaning.

After a while, she fell limp after her stamina ran out. This was her third round and she managed to keep strong.

Cain spends a few moments getting her on the couch with telekinesis. He then turned toward the twin maids. They weren’t getting off easy.

Seeing that he was aiming at them, the twin looked at each other for a moment trying to decide who was to go first. None of them was willing to back down.

“Rock paper scissors!” After an intense yet short round, the winner was decided. It was a draw, those twins kept pulling the same hand each time so they decided that they both go at the same time.

The twin maid took their uniform and looked at each other. ‘They both looked fine’ each of them nodded to the other as if confirming that everything was okay.

They sat side by side on the bed, spreading their legs causing their right and left legs to intertwine in the middle. They both looked at Cain, “Which one.” They both said at the same time.

The fire was flickering as Cain started solving the problem. Left or right? Either choice was fine but he couldn’t help but think it was an important decision.

‘Left or right?’ the first brain started collecting data, ‘both of them are right-handed so we better start from the right.’ The second brain suggested. ‘Even if something went wrong, we can just say the choice felt natural.’

As he reached his final decision, Cain approached the right maid. Gently lifting the left one’s foot and giving her a light kiss, “Please wait a moment.” As he slowly bent over the right one.

As he gave her a deep kiss, she quickly entangled her legs around his waist and started pushing herself onto him as if begging for it.

Cain started gently pushing inside just for her to tighten her legs and force him inside all in one go.

“Ah! That it, deeper.” That was an exaggeration, he was already filling her to the brim.

Cain didn’t interrupt that right and he said, “As you wish.” Immediately using magic to get longer.

She immediately jumped as she felt him almost crush her inside, “Please stop, it’s already enough.” She took a deep breath.
