Cain and Zaleria landed right outside the Fenrir village gate. The place was a mess. Whatever happened here, it looked like how Cain remembered the destruction in Furberg after the catastrophe in his past life.

“This magic is…” Cain said as he touched the ground.

“A wyrm earth dragon. It must have been the one to enrage the beast god.” Said Zaleria as she took a deep breath. “He isn’t here, those things can’t fly so we should have seen it.” She said with a worried face. A wyrm dragon is supposed to be stronger than her as she was ancient.

Cain nodded. “Don’t worry, even in the same age category. Dragons have vastly different strengths. It is highly possible that you can face him off.” Cain was referring to how dragons in the same age category have different strengths. Both Morena and Zaleria were ancient even Zaleria outclassed her big sister with a landslide.

“You seem to be missing something. Wyrms are annoying to kill. I don’t have what it takes to burn an earth dragon, those things are like bedrock.”

Earth dragons did not have wings. They were heavy and hard. Some even described them as walking mountains.

“Who are you? What brought you at such a time?” An injured man yelled at them. He barely managed to grab his sword with how burned his shoulder was.

“Friends of Alen the mage, we came here to help,” Cain replied. Alen was with the beast god’s daughter, he must be friendly with them.

“Then what are you doing here? He had been blasted north with that accursed girl, if it was not for her, those monsters won’t come here for us.” The man threw his blade in rage.

Cain looked around, the entire place was on fire. People were screaming everywhere. The place looked like an ant nest that has been stepped on.

“Don’t worry about them, Our healer is taking care of them,” Cain said as he used Fly to take a better look. He can’t use [Control Weather] as it will consume too much magic that will stop his evolution. He needs to think of a better way to put out the fire

Zaleria can suck up the heat of fire…No, she might freeze the people trapped under the rubble.

Should he just force Alen to wake up, and have him use magic? No that won’t work, he might not know a useful spell.

‘Wait, I can use the maze.’ Something clicked inside Cain’s head.

“Is there a lake nearby?” Cain yelled his question from the sky.

“There is one up north, why do you ask? We can’t bring water from there, our only option is the village’s well!” The man yelled from the ground. To that Cain smiled.

“Those are your limits, not mine.” He then lifted his palm in front of his face. “Mei!”

In a second, a pixie appeared on his palm. “You stingy, you can at least use your magic to summon me.” She complained, Cain didn’t summon her, he called her and she teleported herself to him. It was like ringing someone’s phone to have them call you back with their credit instead of yours.

“Look down,” Cain said with an exhausted face.

When Mei looked down and spotted the entire place on fire, her face turned pale. “Did you start the end of the world?” She cried.

“No, call the other and go help them. I need to go and bring a large amount of water from a nearby lake. Try to minimize the damage as much as you can.” Cain said as he turned to try and spot the lack.

“So that’s why you were saving your MP, fine. You have to pay us later though.” She said with an evil smile on her face as she fell down.

“Come on, it’s time to work!” She yelled as her body flashed with golden lightning. [Enlarge] With green light flashing from her eyes, she enlarged her body to be the size of a human. She needed the size to be able to move rubble.

The other pixies followed her steps and enlarged themselves. Before that Fenrir man, over thirty leaf-wearing women fell from the sky. He stood there stunned at the bizarre sight.

The pixies quickly spread through the village and started using [Create water] and their innate [Magical Grab].

Magical Grab was innate magic that Pixies have, it’s a simple spell that allows them to change the weight of anything they touch to make it Pixie sized. For example, a human will weigh the same as a pixie in their hand. It only works for a short time but it was coupled with Enlarge. It will make it seem like they have extreme strength.

[Magical Haul] is the second innate ability they used to move rubble away.

Using all of their abilities, they started searching for the badly injured and moving them away first. The Fenrir villagers were baffled as to why the servants of the world tree has appeared and started helping them. It was a known fact that the Pixies and fairies are shy creatures that only act upon the will of greater powers.

Seeing them there only meant that being of equal power to the beast god was ordering them around. Their anxiety started to rise. It didn’t help that the Pixies told them they were sent by a great king. Mei did know that Cain was tied to the world tree herald so she called him a king.

…

Cain landed at the lakeshore. [Dimension door] Cain used the fourth-tier spell to open a small portal to his maze. He could not use fifth-tier magic, as it will hinder his transformation. [Control Water] He then started to force the water inside with magic.

‘My limit is two fourth-tier spells at the same time…this is going to be rough.’ If he tried to use another spell, he could feel the magic pushing his evolution further flutter.

“Are you done yet?” Zaleria asked from behind him.

Cain turned and glared at her, “I just started, how do you expect me to finish?”

“You always seemed to find a way to break through my expectation so I asked to know beforehand.” She said with a smile.

“Sadly this time I’m limited, I’m in the middle of breaking through the level cap so I can’t use higher-tier magic.” Said Cain.

“Does that mean you’re vulnerable now?” She asked with a grin.

“That’s not true, I can stop the evolution at any time I want. But then I would need to restart all over again which will take a day.” Cain replied as he tried to focus on filling the maze.

“People are dying in the village, some of them could have been saved if you stopped your evolution and used [Control Weather] to cause it to rain.” She asked.

“I will only stop it when there is an immediate risk to me or those close to me. The villagers aren’t among them. If you’re talking about saving everyone, sorry I’m not a hero.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“That’s not why I meant. Why are you trying to evolve now of all times?” She asked with a worried face. This was clearly a bad time to be hindered and she knew that Cain know that.

“Did you see the beast god? If he was struggling then we need every drop of power available. The sooner I evolve the better.” Saying that Cain smiled. “Let’s go.” He said.

Zaleria quickly flew behind him anticipating what he was going to do. She could not imagine him flying all over the village and putting every single fire out individually.
