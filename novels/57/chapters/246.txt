“Since the day we were born, someone had to nourish Fenrir’s fang. Sister never knew better and I shall not let her feel guilty about this. You shall die here!” Skoll growled as stone spears flew toward Cain at an immense speed.

Cain dodged immediately. He never expected his conciseness to be pulled here. This was bad for Skoll. If she touched him, she will be able to feel his mad soul.

The last one to see his soul was the lich. Even he wasn’t able to handle it. Skoll will just see something that she is better not seeing. Just as he had touched something mustn’t be touched, the shard inside them. She will get pulled down to his soul instead if she touched him.

“Stop! If you touched me this whole world will crumble.” Cain yelled at her. It wasn’t like his soul had any magical properties. It was that this world was made of Skoll’s consciousness. It will get torn apart if her mind touched the madness in Cain.

“This is my world, you have no place to run to!” Skoll screamed as her chains flew at Cain. He tried to dodge them but his body felt heavy, Skoll did something he didn’t see.

The chains wrapped around his body. “I caught you…” At that moment, Skoll’s vision turned black

“Where am I?” She looked at her hands, she wasn’t chained anymore which was strange. She should be always tied to the shard.

Drip! She heard the sound of a drop of water hitting the ground. She quickly turned back. Behind her, Cain was chained up to the ground. Using his body to cover a fragile plant. Around him stood five lit torches. One of them seemed far bigger than the other four.

“Hey, you. What is this place?” Skoll yelled. “Speak up, why are you silent?” She yelled.

Drip! Another droplet, she looked up to see where the water was coming from. The sky was pitch black and she could see nothing.

Skoll glared at the sleeping Cain in anger. Did he steal the shard? She was supposed to be protecting it.

Drip! Another drop of water dripped on her shoulder, she was starting to get annoyed.

“Where is this water coming from?” She screamed staring at the sky. This time it wasn’t pitch black, the sky was filled with eyes staring down at her, what dropped earlier was their tears.

“MaSter LisWorTh!” the sky growled in pain. Skoll started back in terror

…

BAM! A wave of magic repelled Hati away from Cain. The girl rolled and hit the wall like a rag doll. Cain fell on his face unconscious.

GHAA! Haki growled. “What was that for(You bastard what did you do?)?” Two voices came at the same time from her.

“Hati stop, that magic wave was to protect you. Something else was about to consume you!” Alen screamed as stood between her and Cain. She was about to lunge immediately.

“Alen move away! (Get from my way old man!)” Hati yelled.

“Wait who said that? (Am I outside?)” The realization started to hit the twin sharing the same body.

“Listen, I’m not an expert in the subject but I noticed something. Just a bit of knowledge that I learned from my sister in the past.” Zaleria walked toward them after she checked on Cain.

“When two souls collide, the strongest one consumes the weakest. His soul was about to devour you. You better not touch him right now or he might end up gobbling you.” Zaleria was serious. Both Hati and Skoll didn’t get to see the mess that happened after Cain touched Hati.

No one was getting close to Cain besides Zaleria. They all must have gotten the same warning.

“(But he took the shard!)” Skoll screamed.

“I don’t what you’re talking about, if he ate something, you better be grateful it wasn’t you,” Zaleria growled at her.

When Hati’s soul touched Cain’s, his mad soul started absorbing her. As a last effort to protect Hati and Skoll’s life, Cain absorbed the shard instead and repelled Hati away from him.

Right now, a horrid transformation was happening inside him. His evolution was speeding up as his body and soul devoured the Fenrir shard.

Alice could feel her connection with Cain get hotter, the volatile magic raging inside him was unbelievable.

…

On the other side of the world, Sylph was walking down the hallway aiming for the throne room. She had a meeting with elvish nobles in about an hour.

Suddenly she was struck by a cold feeling, the two Spirit gems she left with Cain were about to crack. She instantly knew, his life wasn’t in danger, but he was undergoing a massive process.

It felt similar to when she absorbed the world tree lemon. But Cain’s was more primal, instead of the citrus and leave smells. It smelled of blood, steel, and bones.

“Cancel everything for today. I am going back to my room. I will kill anyone who follows me.” Sylph yelled at the strategist that was walking by her side and rushed back to her room. The man was left baffled at the sudden shift in her attitude.

Sylph was powerless to help Cain. If she wanted to do anything, she would have to teleport to him. Instead, she decided to trust in him and watch. She wouldn’t be able to work while being worried about him.

“If things started going south, I will teleport immediately.” She sat on her bed with all her weapons, scrolls, and artifacts at hand.

…

Now that the shard was absorbed by Cain. The outer shell of the Dimension rift created by the beast god has started to weaken. The dragon cultists noticed the cracks. They rushed to take the chance.

They acted quickly and surrounded the rift. The villagers who noticed them engaged in combat immediately.

“Kill those bastards!” One of the villagers screamed swinging a halberd.

The cultists had more numbers and more experienced fighters. They were specially trained for such fights. Unlike the villages which mostly farmed and hunted small monsters.

“Don’t underestimate them, the Fenrir-demi humans are naturally strong. Fight them with all you got!” One of the cultists’ commanders yelled.

“Mage squad, prepare to blast the rift with your magic! It’s only been an hour but we must release our lord!” The commander kept yelling.

The cultist mages divided into five small squads and started preparing to break the rift from the outside.

The logic was simple. The stronger the dimension is from the inside, the easier it is to break it from the outside. Now add the fact that it cracked, all they need was to force more magic into it.

Cling! One of the commanders instantly lost his head to a man that appeared behind him. “Weak!” Said Kayden. He looked around, where are they? He was wondering where are all the Cubuses, Meliliana said there were a lot of them coming.

He started to get a bad feeling as he saw the girls rush into battle.

Between the cultists, a man lifted his hood and smiled.
