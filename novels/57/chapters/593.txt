Cain lifted his sword. 'Jella will be fine. She can resurrect in hell. Summoning her again isn't a problem.'

"He hurt you, didn't he? Those invaders killed Umberlee's avatar, didn't they?" Abel said, standing up.

'With father's past. I expected to have some siblings but not like this.' Cain slowly lifted his lightning blades and stared at Able closely, 'Can we talk it out, no…can I fix this situation without resorting to murder?'

BAM! He disappeared. In one step, he reached Cain and swung his sword.

'He's fast!' Cain lifted his swords, blocking the attack. CLING! CLANG!

He couldn't fully block it. Able slashed a wound across his arm.

[HP: 9395/9455] => [HP: 9320/9455]

"Hehe…not bad. You blocked my attack. Even though; I wanted to behead you." Able slowly turned to face Cain. "You're really a strong one, aren't you?"

Cain stared at him, shocked. 'You could have at least let apprise you fully.'

'This is bad. Run away.' Morena growled. This was the first time they faced someone like this. She got the same feeling when she faced Cain.

"Can we talk this over?" Cain asked. It wasn't about him killing Able or not. It was about his father's reaction to the fact.

"My girls did everything they could. With what little strength they had." Able started scratching his head. It was then that Cain noticed that he was blind. He wore a bandage on his eyes to cover them. It was clear since he wasn't looking directly at Cain but at an angle.

"You even killed Umberlee's avatar. That's unforgivable." Hearing his words, Cain went on the defensive. The bloodlust Able released was strong enough to reach him. "I'll massacre everyone who had the nerve to bully them."

Able lifted his arm, swinging his blade sideways. FUSH! A massive crescent blade of compressed water rushed at Cain. [Water Blade of Umberlee: Crescent Wave]

Cain lifted his lightning swords, [Lisworth's Resilient Sphere] CRACK! BANG! The attack sliced right through. Cain immediately tried to block it. But exploded on his face and sent him flying.

[HP: 9320/9455] => [HP: 8925/9455] as he spat blood, he felt Able rush at him.

[Fly] Cain twisted his body mid-air. He then saw three Crescent waves rush at him. "He can use more of that thing?" [Earth Wall] [Earth Wall] [Earth Wall] [Earth Wall] [Earth Wall] Cain created five massive barriers to protect himself.

They were useless, only blocking two waves. The third wave approached rapidly. [Teleport] Cain teleported away. "He is a monster."

"Got you." Able appeared behind his back. [Water Blade of Umberlee: Crescent Wave] Cain swung around rapidly, "Inanna." His staff turned into a sword. BAM! A wave of fire exploded.

When the Crescent wave met Inanna, it evaporated immediately, resulting in an explosion.

Thud! Cain landed on the ground. Engulfed in a ball of crimson flames so hot, the stones around him began to melt.

Thud! Able landed, staring at Cain. "Fire." He said, lifting his blade. The seawater flew toward him, "I can always put you out."

SWOSH! In an instant, Able swung his sword rapidly. Sending multiple small Crescent waves.

CLING! CLANG! Cain struck them down. They were heavier than before.

'He compressed the water?' Cain thought.

BAM! Able rushed at Cain with a neck swing. CLANG! Cain deflected it. [Blade Dance]

"That style, it doesn't suit you," Able said, swinging again and again.

CLANG! CLANG! BAM! The two ran across the whole western side of the island. Blasting holes in the ground from their fight. The explosion from the Inanna, and Able's compressed water, has dominated the place.

The tooth and liver's witch retreated to the back, trying to avoid being killed.

As the fight heated up, Cain was getting pushed back. He lacked the sword skill and physical power to compete.

CLING! BAM! Able managed to get an opening. His blade rushed at Cain's throat with a stab.

SWOCH! BAM! Zaleria rushed in. Deflecting the sword with her left forearm. She held her severed head by the hair in her right hand.

Able gasped. "You're still alive?" He thought he killed her, BOOM! Fire exploded beneath her feet. With a gut kick, she sent Able flying.

Cain rushed to attack her head back. [Lesser Healing] And he sucked some of Alice's magic.

CRACK! BAM! At that moment, Sofia emerged from the ground dragging the unconscious witch. With a smile, she looked at Cain, "I caught." It was then that she realized Zaleria's severed head.

She froze in place, slowly turning her head toward Able. With a passive face, she spoke, "It was you?"

Able could feel a strange pressure from her. She only released bloodlust. She wasn't as soft as the dragon. He couldn't sense hesitation from her. He quickly lifted his sword, prioritizing her over Cain.

[Thunder Flash] Sofia mimicked Cain's spell. She saw him use it tens of times. It was easy for her to pick up. In the blink of an eye, Able saw Sofia's foot approach his face.

CRACKLE! He tried to block the kick. But the force and speed behind it were too great. Sofia kept flying with him across the air. Pushing with her foot at the blade of his sword.

"I can't cut her. Who is she?" Able couldn't believe that her barefoot was this hard.

As she was still carrying around the island in a lightning bolt. [Burning Feet] [Fire Burst] Her foot ignited, and a blast of flame burst from her back.

Her speed increased even more, and the flame slowly burned Able.

THWACK! KABOOM! She finally reached his face, kicking him down to the ground in a massive blast.

[HP: 6435/6435] => [HP: 4995/6435] She almost broke his neck. It didn't matter how strong he was.

CRACK! As he crashed into the ground, he could see Sofia falling at him with a second kick. "Who are you?" He swung his blade, sending multiple Crescent blades at her.

CLANG! CLANG! Sofia didn't care. She plunged straight down.

Water damage? She was immune to any element that the chromatic dragons had. Cyan Dragons had the water element. She can only be struck down with blades, and Able's sword is too dull to cut the dragon goddess.

THWACK! BOOM! She fell on his guts with a kick, exploding him in flames.
