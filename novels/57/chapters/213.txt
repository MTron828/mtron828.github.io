Evolution path:

[High human]: Suggested by the inherited blood

[Lich]: Suggested by the necrotic magic residing in the body

[Abomination]: Suggested by the memories types of magic dwelling in the body

Other evolution paths will open by achieving their requirements.

Cain looked up and down around him. A dragon was breathing above him while legions of undead were rushing from the ground. “Did I come at a bad time?” He asked, not awaiting an answer.

Even if you reached the level to use ninth-tier spells, usually you can only cast one a day without backlash because of how powerful those spells are. Add to that the enormous amount of MP they consume and they can be a once-in-a-week trump card.

He had already used two in a row and received the backlash, but that was because he was under-leveled. The backlash of a ninth-tier spell was the overheating of one’s body from the enormous amount of Mana passing by it.

Cain’s body was a Mana enchanted. That meant that he already has a ton of Mana coursing through his body.

“Let’s put an end to this, I really want to have a nap!” Cain lifted his left hand, [Arcane Gate] [Enchanting: Size] A circular-blue gate appeared above him and start to increase in size until it was just wide enough to suck the breath in, teleporting it into an empty location to the east.

He as well pointed with his sword downward [Mighty fortress] Dirt rose from the earth and formed walls around the dome Yamauba created. Eventually forming into what resembled the outer walls of a castle with all the battlements, enchasing the dome inside a keep in the middle.

[Detect thoughts]

Cain felt the lich trying to read his thoughts so he started back at him, “You know, it’s for your own good to not try and peak at my soul.” Smiling at him.

“Tch! You can resist it!” The lich wanted to get some information on him but he failed.

“I’m not trying to resist it, I just blocked you the first time to give you a warning, look at your own risk.” Cain turned toward Morena, as she was the biggest problem.

[Detect thoughts] The lich tried again, the moment he peeked inside, everything turned black around him.

“He, Who, He, Who.” He heard a whispering, “Survived!” The endless darkness inside Cain’s head suddenly expanded. The lich found himself standing in a prison. Faced by a Snake-man, a Yuan-Ti, or as other people call them, Lamia.

“Hey Cain, how long do you think we will stay here?” The Yuan-Ti asked in a sad voice.

The scenery quickly shifted and the Lich found himself holding a dying dark elf woman.

“Don’t try and avenge me, I took enough of them with me.” The dark elf woman said. When the lich looked around, Mountains of orc corpses surrounded them. The dark elf body quickly disappeared.

The reality shattered around the lich and he started feeling an extreme headache. Each time he looked around, he felt nauseous even though he was undead. His thoughts started to shift left and right, he was unable to remember what he was doing.

“GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” The lich screamed and all the troops he summoned disappeared.

Cain turned down to him, “I told you to do it at your own risks, you can look at my memories but the moment you touch my soul. You will start getting eaten by the madness inside.”

Lifting a finger toward the confused Morena, [Elemental burst: Lightning] A flash of light gathered around him, and a cone of white lightning raced toward Morena.

Morena dodged to the side, even though her draconic body was so massive she was still able to dodge the fast spell. “Don’t underestimate my speed!” She screamed.

“No, I guess I would underestimate it as much as I want,” Cain said from the side of her head. He was grabbing one of her horns with his hand.

“How did you…”

[Earthquake] Cain cast the spell before she could finish speaking. This eight-tier spell was simple; it simulated an earthquake by causing extreme vibrations in the ground. Now that Cain was grabbing her horn, the extreme vibration caused it to shatter.

“GRAAAAAAAA” Morena cried in agony as she flew away, “You! You bastard!” She screamed.

“Hello, the bastard is here!” He said as he appeared again by her head and grabbed the other horn. [Earthquake]

[Finger of Death] Xalari flew toward Morena to help her and cast his spell directly at Cain. “You were teleporting weren’t you?”

[Antimagic Field] Cain immediately erased all the magic below him. Erasing the lich’s spell and causing his to start falling.

“What did you do?” The lich screamed as he was falling.

“A normal Antimagic field, can’t you feel it?” Cain replied to him, [Dawn] A beam of light fell from the sky and started burning the lich.

“This is a trick I learned from one of my wives, do you like it?” Cain smiled.

“GRA!” Morena swung her claws left and right, he just used [Far Step] to dodge the attacks. “Stay still!” Morena screamed.

“No way, you stay still!” Cain replied with a mocking voice. Even so, he knew that he might day if she managed to land a solid hit on him.

Cain quickly teleported behind Morena and pointed a finger at her [Power Word Pain] She seemed to flinch for a moment but she immediately turned toward him with a claw attack.

“Do you think that’s enough to stop me?” She growled.

“Fine, I will do more!” Cain replied causing a gasp to escape her mouth.

[Power Word Pain] [Enchanting][Enchanting] Using enchanting Cain increased the spell power even more.

“GRWAAAAA!” Morena growled in pain, “There is more where that came from.

[Power Word Pain] [Enchanting][Enchanting]

[Power Word Pain] [Enchanting][Enchanting]

[Power Word Pain] [Enchanting][Enchanting]

[Power Word Pain] [Enchanting][Enchanting]

Morena cried in agony, the extreme pain paralyzed her wings and caused her to fall to the ground. Cain wasn’t being cruel for anything, he simply didn’t have a spell strong enough to knock Morena down that wasn’t a ninth-tier spell and could hurt his wives.

Morena’s body slowly shifted into a human and she tried to fly away, a small body would help her hide better.

[Power Word Stun] Xalari came rushing in to give her a chance to run; He wasn’t too arrogant to not realize what kind of monster they were facing.

[Mind Blank] Cain resisted the power word and teleported directly behind the lich.

“Power word Stun is an annoying spell so I did learn mind blank especially to deal with it. It’s a spell that gives mental immunity for a short time by deleting you all the thoughts in that time.” In simpler terms. Power word stun overloads the brain and stuns the target, mind black shut off the brain for a moment and causes the caster to blank out for a moment.

[Dominate Monster] [Enchanting]

For a moment, the lich seemed to stand still in front of Cain.

“Do you really think this will work on me?” The lich screamed as he flew toward Morena, [Power word Stun] He paralyzed her in place for a moment.

[Control Undead] Morena stared at him. “What are you doing idiot!” She yelled.

“I guess it will work, look.” Cain opened his hand and the lich gasped.

“Return that immediately!” Xalari screamed seeing his phylactery in Cain’s hand; did he pull it out as he touched him earlier?

“You did ask nicely so no, thanks for the meal.” Cain immediately sucked the Lich’s soul from inside the phylactery causing Xalari’s body to disintegrate leaving only what he was wearing.

Cain then teleported to Morena, “Let’s put more salt on your wounds. I still can’t beat your little sister.” He smiled mocking her. She was only level 21 compared to Zaleria who was 28. Add with how fast and mentally resilient Zaleria was, she could kill Cain before he has time to cast any spells.

“Don’t underestimate me!” She screamed swinging her fist at him.

Cain dodged by teleporting behind her, “Whoa there, I still can’t take a direct him.” Cain said as he touched her back [Elemental burst: Lightning]

With a flash of lightning, Morena rolled away like a rag doll. Thud! She regained her stance and was about to breathe acid on him.

[Thunder Step] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting]VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Cain flashed toward her like a lightning bolt, cutting her head in a single swing, and quickly turned to face her still standing body.

“You’re a dragon; after all, this isn’t enough to kill you, right?” Cain kept his guard up.

A young dragon would only have his brain to command the body. An adult dragon would have his brain extended to the tip of his tail so beheading cannot kill him, just like cockroaches.

After becoming an ancient, a lump of nerves is formed near the heart and will function as another extension of the dragon’s brain. This means that to kill an ancient dragon you have to destroy the head, spine, and heart.

A wyrm will have another lump formed at his Draconis fundamentum and at the great wyrm stage his whole nervous system. You have to disintegrate the whole body to kill them.

Morena was an ancient dragon.
