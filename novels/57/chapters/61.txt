Alice opened her eyes to the sight of Cain violently pounding on Selena. Her face was ecstatic, drooling with lust.

She silently watched, playing with herself in the meantime as she enjoyed the show.

With one powerful thrust, Cain stooped in his tracks. “Relax, loosen up.” Cain gently flipped Selena on her back, lifting both her legs. While staying inside, he pushed two fingers down her flower, shaking it as hard as he could. The more she moaned, the harder he moved.

Leaning down at her chest, he started moving again, pushing ever deeper inside. Taking his fill of her chest, and mouth. Alice could see Selena’s claw digging into his back, she was probably not aware of what she was doing.

[Holy Healing]

It was getting a bit messy, Alice feared that Selena will suck all of Cain’s stamina, leaving nothing for her and Sofia.

‘Probably taking on all three of us at the same time was a bad idea, he might not be able to bear it.’

She was right, two to three times was all a man had, Cain now was only moving thanks to the stamina potion.

After a few moments, the two finally reached their thresholds. Cain felt the climax but nothing got out of him, he was out of the baby batter, it wasn’t going to magically regenerate in minutes.

They finally got separated from each other. Cain fell flat on his back, sweating all over his body, his marbles were throbbing like never before.

Alice slowly crawled to his side, seeing her coming he already guessed what she wanted.

“I’m already empty and in pain. Unless you can fix that, I can’t go for another round.” He told her bluntly, he felt as if his nuts were about to burst.

“Would healing magic work? Do you know of a solution?” She had no idea where to start.

Cain could feel the determination in her eyes. She was nonetheless horny.

“I don’t know myself, try messaging them, I doubt Healing would work but you can still try.”

Hearing his words, Alice started by trying to heal him.

“Another thing, I might not be able to get up again this night so don’t let me go limp. Otherwise, your efforts might end up in vain.” It was true, he was still up now, but there was no telling if he will be able to raise again.

“How do I do that? Put it in right now?” Alice asked in confusion, what should she do? Probably waking Sofia for help was the only option.

“Keep it in your mouth while you massage, if you did that it might hold!” Cain paused for a moment, “Then even if you failed to quell my pain, I will try to give you the last try.” Cain promised that by her doing that, he will endure the pain and give her what she want.

“But…It’s still fresh out off Selena’s…” Alice didn’t continue, she wanted a second one that wasn’t going to stop her.

Alice, with a shaking hand and a turning heart, attempted to put it in her mouth. Just the idea of it being inside another girl’s back end was making her sick, cleaning it wasn’t going to solve that problem for her.

After thinking for a short moment, Alice found the only solution.

“Cain, use the binding on me!” Alice explained further after seeing Cain’s puzzled face, “Force me to suck it while massaging you, It’s the only way.” Cain just didn’t have the energy to argue with her, lifting his hands as he obeyed.

“I will also use you a bit, you don’t mind?” Alice nodded at his words.

“Do it, and put your butt and feet by my side.” The order came and her body moved on its own. She turned to her butt towards Cain as she slid the thing into her mouth.

Even though she had no problem with it before, now it was revolting in her mouth. She was as if she was about to throw up, yet she couldn’t. As if that wasn’t enough, she was forcing it to the base, before she could only fit about half. Now she was in pain, choking, disgusted, yet she didn’t hate it. That was mostly due to the feeling rising on her end.

Faced with her bare rear, Cain quickly slides her toes in his mouth, thinking she likes it due to her prior actions.

Next, using both his hands, Cain started fingering both her holes, making sure to give her the utmost pleasure.

Surprisingly, his pain slowly fade away, and as soon as he was ready, he ordered her to stop.

“This might be the last time you have it tonight, how do you want it?” Hearing his question, Alice didn’t need to think about it, she just got on all four.

She couldn’t get Selena’s picture from her head so she just said it.

“Do me like Selena, with passion. Just use this.” Alice opened her flower with two fingers.

A weird thought came to Cain’s mind.

“Can I grab onto your horns?” He asked, gently stroking her butt.

“Just go for it, I don’t mind that much.” She was already pushing him over his limits, that was a small giveback in her eyes.

Before starting, Cain gave her flower a gentle, kiss.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Tightly grabbing her horns, Cain started slow, giving her enough time to relax before picking up the speed.

Alice found the feeling to be superb, for some reason, her horns, tail, and wings were extremely sensitive. She also realized that the feeling of being under the binding gave her a weird tingling.

‘Next time I will ask him to do me under the spell, it feels…’ her thoughts were cut short, “Kya, Kya! That’s it, more, more!” She moaned from the pleasure, only lighting Cain even more.

Due to the loud moaning coming from the two, Sofia woke up with fire in her belly.

The first thing she saw was Alice’s twisted pleasure face.

She didn’t wait and kissed Cain, joining in the fun.

“Ah! Sofia, I’m already sore, I can’t do you after her.” He tried to convince her, he could feel the veins almost popping in his marbles.

“Please!” She begged, “Just this time!”

He couldn’t say no to her eyes, especially after He gave the other two a second go, feeling it was his responsibility to be fair between them, he nodded.

Soon enough, he was done with Alice. She fell flat on her face asleep.

Cain was sore, his meat burnt, and his jewels throbbed in pain, getting Sofia was going to be a nightmare.

“Master, drink this, it will help with the pain!”

Cain unconsciously took the cup from Gracie, drinking it in one go.

“Thanks, it will…the F you’re here!?!” He turned towards her with his eyes open, he didn’t hear her enter.

“You seemed to take quite a bit of time so I brewed this for you.” She was standing outside the door, as a guard, listening to everything inside. As she got the feeling Cain was feeling well she made that herbal tea for him.

“Go bring me a belt and turn around.” He was joking. It was true that what she did was a no in his book. She was still enslaved by Sofia so she is harmless. His intention was just to show his discomfort with her actions.

“I did expect that,” Gracie pulled a leather belt from behind her, turning around and giving Cain her rear and belt. “Please, do it from above the clothes as I don’t want to show my skin.”

Sofia was dying of shame, being caught by Gracie wiggling her butt.

“I was joking, what were you thinking?” Cain was already exhausted.

“I will do it if you won’t!” Sofia growled as she grabbed the belt.

“Heh?” Cain looked at her in surprise.

“Strip and put your but towards me, I’m going to whip you until you can’t even sit!” Sofia was seriously angry, making a face that Cain saw before.

At that moment, Cain noticed the first bit of emotions in Gracie, her hands were shaking as she was untying her maid uniform.

“Sofia, STOP! Don’t force her to strip!” Cain shouted as he grabbed Sofia from the shoulder.

“Stop!” Sofia quickly took her order back. Something was off about Cain’s cry.

Cain’s mind was going full speed, she was shaking, that was a feat only achievable when the slave is revolting with instinct. He has only seen it on slaves that have been ordered to commit suicide.

“Forgive her this time for me, just don’t ever force her to strip.” Cain gently dragged Sofia onto his lap, sliding inside her.

Sofia was a bit mad at Cain for doing that in front of Gracie but she decided to let it slide, he will surely have an explanation later.

However, she wasn’t going to let the humiliation slide. Gracie was to pay for it one way or the other.

“On your knees, lick them!” Sofia gave her order, stretching her leg towards Gracie.

“Thanks for your mercy.” Gracie got on her knees, with any change to her face, she started licking Sofia’s feet.

Cain gave her a weird look.

“What? she entered without permission and saw me in that humiliating form. She isn’t going without tasting the same.”

Gracie didn’t seem to mind this, and he didn’t want to complicate things further. He started moving.

Having Cain move inside her while fondling her chest, and Gracie licking her feet. Sofia moaned as if she was in heaven.

“Aaah! Aaah! It feels good…”
