Alice kept straining herself, no matter how much power she put in, the holy magic was too unstable to form a blade. For a moment, she thought she couldn’t conjure an angel weapon, which was exclusive to them. This will only prove that Ariel was right and holy magic and curse magic are different by implying that the holy magic Alice is using is defective or unrefined.

“Fine, if holy magic won’t do…” Alice growled, her whole holy magic disappeared and only the curse magic.

Ariel leaped away as she felt the pulse of cursed magic, the fine hair on her skin stood. That sight reminded her of the old war, she instinctively took a fighting stance.

A dark lump of cursed magic was slowly forming in Alice’s palm. The more cursed magic that Alice released, the more worried Ariel got. She didn’t expect Alice to reach that point, she genuinely didn’t expect to pull that.

As Ariel was about to stop Alice, a pulse of divine magic fell on Alice. It was the god’s approval of a paladin, Amaterasu didn’t converse with them but she was willing to make Alice a paladin that easily.

BAM! With a loud explosion, a dark blade formed in Alice’s left hand, it was slowly releasing arcs of overcharged curse magic.

“A cursed blade, the one those fallen used!” Ariel growled. She could hardly quell the engraved hatred for such weapons that she had.

“Hehe!” Alice giggled, “I see, it needs to be pure. In that case, I should be able to…” after taking a deep breath. Trying to stand firm with her shaking legs. A blast of holy magic came from her right hand, and as the two contradicting types of magic rejected each other’s they released enough force to keep Ariel at bay.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

BAM! With another explosion, a holy blade formed in Alice’s right hand.

Ariel couldn’t believe what she was seeing, this was the first time she saw someone hold both a holy and a cursed blade.

As holy magic seeped from Alice’s golden eye and cursed magic from her red eye. Her devil wings started radiating cursed magic to keep the cursed blade stable. On the other hand, the highly compacted holy magic in her body found nowhere to escape from but her eye, slowly it started colliding with the cursed magic and caused the holy blade to explode in her hand.

Alice’s body rolled backward and she lay unconscious from the impact, she was bleeding from her scalp. Ariel rushed to heal her but was zapped with cursed magic instead. “Just disappear, you’re a nuisance!” Ariel pointed her finger at the cursed blade in Alice’s hand and erased it with a powerful holy blast. As strong as Alice’s cursed magic, Ariel could still overpower her with the sheer amount of power she had.

After that Ariel healed Alice waiting for her to wake up. “I should have told you, creating a blade with compacted magic requires a large amount of said magic. Which means your body will be filled with pressurized magic and you need to vent it off when the blade is consuming none.”

Alice’s red eye and devil wings act as release valves to her cursed magic while her golden eye was alone trying to keep the holy magic in check. Add to that the holy magic and cursed magic colliding inside her body caused more stress and led to the failure.

Ariel then Carried the unconscious Alice back out toward her room where they met Cain walking in with Gracie.

“What happened to her?” Cain asked even though he can see traces of holy magic and cursed magic going high wire in her body.

Ariel explained what happened to Cain, he didn’t seem pleased.

“Creating an elemental blade is one thing, but holy blades are equivalent to the ninth-tier spell [Blade of Disaster]. Did you let her force two out?” Cain yelled.

“Don’t yell, she is fine!” Ariel said, being right as this wasn’t enough to kill a devil.

“If anything were to go a bit more wrong, her eyes would have exploded instead of the holy blade! If her body had a simple imperfection she might…” Cain then noticed the bleeding from her scalp.

He leaped in to examine it in a panic, the scar that got left on her body when he took a few Mana from the ritual to use [Mist step] against jack, it got opened. That small crack, an imperfection in her devil body almost caused her whole head to explode.

Cain’s mind instantly went to the worst-case scenario so he cast [Marlin’s floating platform] and started inspecting her head. Luckily she had no brain damage, the scar probably opened due to the impact and not due to holy magic escaping from it.

Cain sighed in relief, “I might need to work on her body again.”

“What do you mean?” Ariel asked, she wasn’t going to be pleased with what she was going to hear.

“Make her devil body stronger by recreating it again,” Cain said.

Ariel immediately pulled her holy blade and pointed it at Cain, “You create devils?” She growled.

“Only their bodies to be exact, I hate meddling with souls,” Cain replied with an uncaring face.

“It doesn’t matter, that is…” Ariel was about to speak when Cain lifted his hand.

“Take this thing away from my face.” A single flick from his finger caused her holy blade to vanish into glowing dust.

Ariel immediately leaped away, what did he do? “That was a blade formed from Chauntea’s divine magic, what did you do?” She growled.

“Can you shut up for a moment? I will call father if you don’t!” Upon hearing Cain’s warning she had to try and calm herself.

“The point is that it’s Chauntea’s divine magic, not yours, I can simply erase it by temporarily blocking the link between you and her,” Cain explained.

“Is that even possible?” She growled.

“Had enough time to experiment,” Cain replied with a smile.

After carrying Alice to her room, Cain went down to the dinner table where he met Marina and Mary who were waiting for his return.

“Anything major happen?” Mary asked with a smile.

Cain slowly explained what happened with the dragons, how they took her down, and everything.

After that he briefly touched on Gracie’s case, to keep her from starving, she can have Cain whenever she needs which will give her significantly more time with him. Necessary it may be, but it was still unfairness to his wives.

Both Marina and Mary smiled, Cain was lucky to have such an understanding wife. They both said they don’t mind, but they had a single condition. If any of them wanted extra care once in a while, he has to agree.

After dinner, Cain walked toward Alice’s room to check on her. She was awake and eating her food with the help of Lexi.

“How are you doing?” Cain asked.

“Better than the last time I saw you. I just overused my magic…” Alice giggled scratching her cheek.

“You’re our healer, what if you injured yourself?” Cain smiled.

“Your right, I need to be more careful.” Alice smiled.
