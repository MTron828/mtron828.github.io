Chapter 495 Who's the true monster? II

GAWGAWGAW! Selena roared rushing at Morena as fast as she could.

Morena took a stance and blocked Selena’s punch, “What are those knuckles?” She growled looking at the knuckle dusters Selena was using. They were extremely hard and held a ton of compressed magic. As they were made to deal as much damage as possible.

“GAW!” She delivered another punch “GAW!” and another one. Selena wasn’t stopping or listening to Morena, all she need to do is punch and punch, buying time for Cain.

Morena deflected all those punches and when she tried to counter, Sofia flew all the way to her with a kick.

“You as well?” She dodged to the side.

Cling! Alice appeared from behind her dual wielding a holy sword and a cursed sword. A dual slash clashed with Morena’s back leaving a cross-shaped wound.

BAM! Selena punched her at the same time and Sofia breathed fire at her.

In the background, the Abishai army was keeping the sinner army at bay while Cain recovered his MP for a big attack.

“Get away from me, you’re not the one I’m after!” Morena growled as she transformed into her draconic body in an explosion of Acid.

Selena and Alice had to jump away lest they get burned.

Sofia on the other hand transformed as well.

ROAR! Sofia grabbed Morena’s head with her claws and tried to breathe flame at her. Crushing the ground with her hind kick, Morena punched Sofia’s lower jaw deflecting them away.

“I’m a Great Wyrm now! How could you stand after taking a punch from me?” Morena growled, she couldn’t fathom if those girls have become stronger or she had become weaker.

ROAR! Sofia roared, her scales turning bright red as flames rose inside her body. [Fire Storm] BOOM! The flame engulfed Sofia and then exploded shattering the ground around her.

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! She kept exploding over and over. Which made approaching her without getting scorched seemed like an impossible task.

Morena leaped away to avoid getting burned and stared at the walking fireball.

BAM! In an instant, Sofia used [Burning feet] and leaped to the sky with a boom. [Stored Spell: Ice spear] Ten ice spears appeared beside She and got launched toward Morena at the same time.

Morena started dodging from side to side cracking the ground. Alice flew to her side swinging a slash at her neck while Selena punched her hind legs to drop her.

~Away from her~

An order reached all of them from Cain, his attack was about to launch and they should run less to get caught.

As they leaped away leaving Morena alone, she could see Cain standing in the distance with twelve [Dark stars] behind him.

He pointed his staff at her launching all of them in an instant.

‘All of those? How could he control them?’ Morena wandered.

Thud! She leaped away dodging all of them.

Cain smiled, and the dark stars turned toward her again. ‘I’m manually moving all of them as I like, they will keep attacking until they hit you.’

Morena started jumping around and twisting her body to avoid all attacks. It was a sight to behold seeing such a massive creature dance like that.

‘I should transform back.’ Morena shifted back to her half-dragon form to make dodging easier.

Cain flew toward her with [Thunder Step]

“I’m here!” He faced her directly.

Morena swung a fist at him immediately but he teleported to her back swinging his staff.

“You won’t get me twice.” She turned and swung a kick at his head. Making sure he won’t bite her again.

Her kick stopped right before his face unable to touch his skin.

‘What is this? A layer of force? Telekinesis?’ Morena thought and swung a fist toward his face.

Cain took a step back and grabbed her with Telekinesis. She wasn’t able to move that well.

All the dark stares flew toward her with an eerie whistle and Cain covered his hand with a lightning blade and tried to stab her guts.

“You think this will tie me?” She opened her jaw releasing a blast of acid and necrotic magic. Cain had to leap away for a moment and she took the chance to transform back to her draconic form and flap her wings as fast as she could.

Taking off to the sky, Morena decided to try an extreme strategy. Suicide. She can overcharge her Draconis fundamentum and explode like they do after they die.

Her body got swollen like a balloon.

Cain used telekinesis to pull all the girls toward him and lifted his staff up. [Prismatic dome] He protected everyone with multiple layers.

Morena exploded in a massive Acid wave that was strong enough to melt the outer layer of his shield.

“Is she crazy?” Sofia gasped.

“No, she’s smart. Behind us!” Alice yelled as she saw Morena about to explode again right after reviving.

“Cain, what should we do-nya?” Selena cried.

Cain was making an evil smile, “Abusing her immortality, I was thinking of doing the same with her… I can handle another two explosions, let her do it.”

Cain looked at his soul fragments with an evil smile, he was intending on abusing her like this before killing her.

‘This idiot give me 1000 soul fragments, I wish I was able to keep her alive in a cage and kill her infinitely.’ Cain then looked at his stats and the enchanting system now that Morena had died twice.

Cain immediately put everything into Mana’s regeneration to break everything.

<(Passive Mana regeneration)PMR: 2130/min><(Active Mana regeneration)AMR: 4260/min><(Sleeping Mana regeneration)SMR: 6390/min>

In such a short while, he became able to regenerate his whole MP in less than two minutes.

Smiling, Cain let Morena explode two more times. He was at a mental limit on how much he can keep the ninth-tier [Prismatic dome] his only restraint was his intelligence stats.

‘Now that she died another two times…I have another two thousand soul fragments.’ But instead of putting them into MP Regeneration, he decided to increase his MP, HP, and SP. 500 points for HP, 500 for SP, and 1000 For MP.

‘Now those stats are more befitting of my massive Chimera body and I should be able to fight more freely in it.’ Cain thought, ‘I should also be able to supply the girls with more MP to fight with.’Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Cain’s body exploded in a flash of magnificent light, and the girls found themselves covered with tentacles. Cain transformed above them and was ready to finish Morena.

Lilia who had just returned from watching the fight in hell saw Cain transform and got confused, “The hell? He’s an even bigger monster than last time. His mana tripled!”

She inspected him even further, “But, it’s registered in the system. Such a waste, even, I need to know how he got so much power in such a short time. Better talk to him.” She decided to go meet him.

Lilia had confidence she can get what she want, after all, this mage still hasn’t become even close to being a threat to her.

“And I thought I’d seen vicious monsters, this is a true one.” She laughed flying down.
