Gracie stared at Aria, "Wait? AO, he's around?" She took a step back.

Aria looked around and then at her palm, "Notice: I don't know. All I know is that he named me." Her eyes then flashed, [Notice: the system had finished.]

Gracie looked at her, "Is the system ready?" She tilted her head.

Aria stared at her with glowing blue eyes. [Notice: To all system users, I'm Aria, the collective consciousness of the system. The creation of Cthulhu, the world idol."

Gracie looked at her hands, inspecting her stats

[Name: Gracie Gray][Race: Succubus Goddess (Fallen Cupid)][Class: Rogue]

[Level: 100/120][Exp: 536490/12619000][Sub-class: Arcane-Assassin (Shadow)]

[Strength: 30] [Agility: 55] [Constitution: 50]

[Magic: 35] [Intelligence: 35] [Wisdom: 60]

[HP: 3200] [MP: 2650] [SP: 3450]

Succubus skills:

[Seducing existence] As a succubus and a fallen cupid, Gracie's seduction is far beyond mortals. Her mere existence is enough to stop a mortal's heart.

[Aphrodisiac bodily fluids] Gracie's bodily fluids carry a powerful toxin that stimulates sexual desire. As her sweat evaporates, it creates an intoxicating area around her that span for a hundred feet at minimum. Gracie can seduce any mortal in that area at will.

[Respite] Regenerate stamina by 50/second.

[Desired Existence] People who can be seduced by Gracie but aren't at the moment. They can't be offended by her actions.

[Emotionless]: Unless she wishes otherwise. Gracie's emotions are sealed. No one can tell what she is thinking or feeling from her blank expressions.

[Shadow Born] Due to her excessive use of shadow magic, Gracie's body has integrated with her shadow. She can move through shadows at will, instead of using magic.

[Shadow Heart] Gracie's heart and organs aren't inside her body but are kept safe in a separate shadow pocket. She can't be killed by normal means.

[Enchanted body] Due to the Aphrodisiac, Gracie's bodily fluids are filled with mana which makes them valuable chemical ingredients.

[Succubus goddess Immunity] Gracie can't be charmed, seduced, controlled, or pleased by anything unless she consents.

[Shadow Senses] Gracie can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste everything connected to shadows in a 100ft radius. Unless she wishes otherwise.

[Indefinite Magic Immunity] Gracie is immune to spells that attempt to charm, control her mind, or change her shape in any form or way. She cannot be damaged with shadow spells and cannot be teleported against her will.

<Martial Skills><Retract>

[Hidden blade]

[Twin Fang]

[Knives throwing]

[Metallic Wire Arts]

[Shadow Maze] Using her power over the shadows, Gracie can force her enemy to wander the dark world by sucking him into her shadow. All of her hits are grantees to hit him inside the maze.

[Shadow Garden] Gracie expand her shadow for 100ft, causing the whole area to be consumed by darkness. Incubi and Succubi wander the shadows, following Gracie's orders.

[Dance of the pole] Gracie is an expert in using pole-shaped weapons like spears and polearms. Her fighting style seduces those who see it while still being deadly.

[Cupid whispers] Gracie's words, voice, and glare are dangerous to mortals. A single word is enough to wash a man's mind, and clear a woman's heart. Even the foulest words coming out of her mouth are always accepted with joyful tears.

[Bed Cry] Gracie can choose to scream, sending a high-pitched cry that causes anyone who hears it to die. The death reason is a heart attack due to a sudden increase in libido.

[Shadow Dance] Gracie can leap and weave between shadows as she fights, giving her an edge in dodging and attacking.

[Seductress dance] Gracie's dance is an art unmatched by anyone besides Eilistraee, the goddess of dance and songs. It's both seductive and deadly.

Gracie looked back at Aria, "I see. My stats changed a little bit." She blinked twice, "Where is my charisma?"√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

"Notice: Cain never liked that stat in the first place. Seduction now works like magic instead of being innate with charisma." Aria replied.

Gracie nodded, "But I can still feel it," She said.

"Notice: It's magic now. It isn't an innate ability that needs to be tamed, but a skill to be learned." Aria looked at Gracie, her hair flailing with the wind.

Gracie looked at the ground and then approached Aria, "One last question. Do you know who is behind everything?"

"Notice: The one planning everything from the back is Cain's last wife. The craziest of them all." Aria replied, looking at her hands.

"Who is she?" Gracie glared at her.

"Notice: I don't know. She has already deleted her existence from the system." Aria closed, "I can only see her empty place. She seems to be someone that Cain met when he was imprisoned by the dragons, and she stayed with him even after reincarnation. Do you know her?"

Gracie shook her head, "From what Mary and Sofia said, Cain was alone when reincarnating. Could it be Sylph?"

"Notice: No, she's still in the system. This one seems to have never left Cain's side. Even a moment ago, she was there," Aria pointed at Cain, "Notice: From the system traces, she was sitting on him."

Gracie looked at her, confused, "Isn't there a problem in the system itself? No one was there," She approached Cain and looked around him, "Could she be in another dimension?"

"Notice: That is possible, but I should have detected her if that was the case. The problem is that she had access to me and erased her existence," Aria said, approaching Cain.

"Notice: Wake up," Aria poked Cain, "Notice: Wake up,"

Cain slowly opened his eyes, exhausted, "AH! My head hurts," He growled, sitting up.

"Notice: The system has successfully launched," Aria said with a smile.

Cain looked at her and Gracie, and he then stared at his hands.

[Open system]

Aria bowed down, "Notice: As you wish,"

Cain's system page opened like an explosion. Hundreds of words flew from his palm like a violent storm. "Too many stats. Keep it down. Only the necessary things" Cain said.

"That's a lot of soul fragments," Cain gasped.

"Notice: Collected from the abyss war and all the believers. As a god, you're rapidly growing in power with each moment." Aria replied.

Cain giggled, "OK, let's spend ten thousand points on HP, MP, and SP." Cain said, looking at his stats.

Cain stood, "I will save them," He then looked at Gracie, "You're stats look nice,"

Gracie stared at him, "Your look better,"

Cain smiled, "I might have the highest stats in the system,"

Aria stared at him, "Notice: Sadly, you don't. Even by a long shot."

Cain slowly looked at her, "Who?"

"Notice: May I be frank?" Aria looked at Cain.

"You're a part of me so speak as you wish," Cain replied.

"Ahem," Aria cleared her throat, removing the 'Notice entirely,' She looked at Cain, "Lilia Bodhimicah...That monster."
