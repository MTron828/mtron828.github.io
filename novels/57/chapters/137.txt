“Your Majesty, your majesty, a greatwyrm blue is challenging us!” An elvish woman clad in obsidian black armor came and respectfully kicked the throne room’s door open. She took a few heavy steps before bowing down before the newly crowned queen, “It’s asking for a lemon seed at all costs!” The elvish knight exclaimed and all the councilors gasped in fear.

“A dragon has come? What do the avatars of chaos and madness have to do with our refined kingdom?” One of the councilors yelled at the news.

“They are made, taking advantage of the unfortunate state we’re in!” Another one was added.

All the councilors started mumbling to each other as sweat started dripping from their foreheads.

“Silence!” An elvish knight screamed bearing his brilliant silver sword, “You’re in front of her highness, whether be it a dragon or a devil, we the silver knights are going to erase anyone who dares sully our land!” Multiple knights agreed with him pointing their swords to the sky and shouting.

Knock! The sharp sound of a gavel banging on a plate stopped their screams. Looking toward the throne, the servant beside the elvish queen had been the one to knock the hammer.

“Thank you Farryn,” Sylph gently patted the girl beside her, “To think Farryn has to be calmest of you, this is why father never lasted on his throne!” Sylph stood from her throne and sat Farryn in her place. The elvish throne was a sacred artifact that only the elvish royal was given the right to sit on, Sylph didn’t care about that and wanted the most competent person to handle her role.

“I assign Farryn as a substitute ruler in my absence time, an insult to her is an insult to me and will be punished by life-long torture. I will take off the dragon so follow her rule in the meantime!” After saying her words she turned toward Farryn, “This might take as little as a couple of minutes to over a week, just as you saw me do those last days.” Sylph said patting the little girl on the head. Even though she looked as fine a woman as anyone else, to Sylph who was more than a hundred years older than her she was still a little kid.

Click-clank! Sylph strode through the throne room ignoring all the knights who tried to call her, she only ever trusted or talked for a long time with those who are slaves to her.

As soon as she reached the balcony she could feel the dragon’s aura engulfing the whole city, It was indeed a blue dragon but still not that strong of a one.

Taking a deep breath of the cold southern air, an evil smile ran across her face. “Master, we seem to have gotten everything moving a bit faster. The dragons shouldn’t have come after us elves until fifty years in the future.” She said cracking her back and looking behind to the maid that was standing behind the door terrified.

“I swear I didn’t hear anything!” She said being on the verge of crying, she well knew what fate awaited those who got on Sylph’s bad side.

“I will see you tonight in my room with the full enslavement set and a nice warm meal, if it was to my liking you might avoid the punishment!” Sylph said as she flew into the distance.

It wasn’t like Sylph didn’t know the maid was there or was oblivious to her presence. In fact, it was the second she made that maid listen to her like this, and she confirmed how tight-lipped she was. Sylph wanted to recruit her and those two events were just tests for her. She only wanted two things, a tight-lipped and a beautiful elvish woman, the more perfect they were the better.

~Oh’s great tree of Yggdrasil, thy hier is asking for a drop of your eons-old power~

Sylph’s eyes flashed deep red as the forest rumbled, every elf alive could feel the world tree screaming. It was a sight to see as every tree close to the royal capital seemed to bear a screaming face that got locked on the dragon flying in the sky.

RUMBLE! The blue dragon felt the sudden shift in the winds and got alerted, both his heart and wings operated at full power. [Thunder Step] That massive draconic body suddenly disappeared with an earth-shattering thunderclap, every single window in the capital burst leaving hundreds of elves injured.

The dragon’s aim was the single mass of condensed Mana flying toward him at an incredible speed. “So you have chosen death!” He growled bearing his claws ready to strike. [Chain Lightning] His claws rumbled faster than any creature could ever hope to be, a strike so fast it looked like a flash of brilliant white light.

Thwack! Crack! He felt something small and pointy at his forehead, at that moment he saw it. An elvish woman in with golden hair and blood-red eyes was stepping on his with her pointy heels.

“Get on the ground, Lizard!” She said a massive shock wave burst from underneath her foot sending the gargantuan dragon toward the ground.

The citizen screamed as they saw the dragon about to fall on their houses. An elderly elvish woman was sitting on a bench in the city garden where the dragon was about to fall and her grandson was dragging her to flee. “Grandma run, the monster is falling!” He screamed pulling her away.

“The princess might have a bad personality but she is still a proud elf!” The old lady said calmly, she had lived in that city for over a thousand years in that city and she wasn’t intending to flee.

One of the trees in the garden suddenly grew larger, evening its trunk and writhing like a crazed snake. Thwack! The tree smacked the dragon just before it could fall on the old lady and her grandson. The dragon was sent flaying outside the city as a leaving a trail of blood in its way.

Click! Sylph landed in front of the old lady, “Why didn’t you run?” Sylph didn’t yell her voice was instead gentle and soothing.

“Hehe! Last time you didn’t have change so you didn’t pay for the food, consider this as your debt being paid, your highness!” The old lady patted Sylph on the shoulder and her grandson’s face went pale as he got on his knees to apologize for her grandmother’s rudeness.

Sylph sighed, “Please don’t scare me like that, your dairy products are the finest on the whole continent. For a moment I thought I was about to lose a thousand-year experience in cheese making!” Sylph quickly strode behind the old lady and her eyes flashed red, “Now, please go back, that thing won’t die easily!” As sylph said that the old lady grabbed her grandson’s hand and was about to rush out.

“Wait grandma, you know the princess, I mean the queen?” The old lady’s grandson asked with a trembling voice, This wasn’t something that he could have ever imagined as most elves can’t digest dairy products, they were mostly used to feed babies or slaves.

“Well she is a regular at our shop, even I was surprised when she showed up the first time!” The old lady smiled as they rushed toward their home.

…

Outside the city, the dragon smashed to the ground at a terrifying speed wondering what happened to him. ‘I got his twice by that bitch?’ He couldn’t believe what happened to him, it was unfathomable for a dragon to suffer such humiliation.

Crack! He heard the tree branches crackle around him before turning into massive veins. He quickly got entangled in a tight grasp that prevented even his wings from flapping.

“You wretched woman, have you eaten the sacred lemon?” The dragon growled as he opened his jaw like a crocodile about to bite on a deer. The His chest flashed with binding light before his pale white lightning breath was released.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The breath flashed as if it was about to start a whole world, Lightning roared with a thunderous boom as Sylph crashed down from the sky to block it from hitting the town.

[Under the world’s tree groove] The massive veins of the world tree emerged from the ground like snakes and covered the whole elvish capital in a dome of wood and branches.

The lightning struck the dome head-on, and Sylph’s eyes burnt red as she drew more of the world tree power. “This is actually putting a fight against the world tree?” From her past life with Cain, she had faced countless dragons and saw how strong they were. But it all seemed like a dream that she didn’t want to believe, Dragons were the epitome of living beings with might enough to shake ancient beings like the world tree. That reality didn’t seem believable to her at the start but she now got more certain that they are a problem and she felt better about throwing her father into prison for trying to serve such monsters.

Thud! Covering her body with the world tree’s bark she launched herself straight through the dragon’s lightning. “Impossible, how could this be?” The dragon gasped as he saw the elvish woman zapping through his lightning-like arrow passing through the air.

“I didn’t just eat a lemon, I bathed in the whole harvest!” [World tree armor] [World tree’s great Gladius] As a wooden sword appeared in her hand, a single slash sent the dragon’s head flying.

Click! Sylph landed gracefully as the dragon’s blood rained around her. She turned around and started walking away. ‘I don’t sense its pulse through the tree roots. This thing must be dead!’ Her body was soaked in blood so she wished to get back quickly and have the servants clean her in a lavender bath.

Thump thump!

Just as she felt that she was about to turn around and slice the dragon’s body in half when she was faced with its claw. Thwack! Swoosh! Sylph was sent flying and crashed at the city wall with blood dripping from her forehead.

The dragon’s headless body rushed toward her with lightning crackling from its limbs in a bloody rampage. “I guess I need a master’s punishment, how did I forget this is an ancient dragon. I have to destroy their spine and heart as well!” Sylph said as the elvish guards jumped from the wall and formed a battalion to protect her.

“It’s almost dead, protect the queen!”
