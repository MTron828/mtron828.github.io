This is an extra chapter that shows Sylph’s perspective when the reincarnation happened.

——————————————–

On the other side of the world. On the same day that Cain woke up in the guild. In the Elvish Kingdom, the Royal capital, the high-king Castle.

An elvish woman that looked in her late twenties was striding through the gold-engraved hallway, followed by two armored figures.

Wearing what looked like a glorified roman dress that was a bit more revealing than it need to be. Her long golden hair was arranged into two braids, some stands that dripped over her ruby eyes.

The armored knights called to her, “Your highness, please slow down. The auction won’t open until dusk.” From their high-pitched voices to the design of their armors, It was clear that they are women.

Their calls were met with closed ears, the woman paid them less attention than the birds chirping outside.

Soon she reached the exit, looking down at the whole Elvish capital. Just looking down from the balcony was enough to make someone sick.

Up in the distance, the woman glanced at a large majestic tree. “Yggdrasil, I haven’t heard your call in decades, why now?” Whoosh! She started to float with the breeze, before picking up speed and flying into the distance.

“Damn it!” One of the two knights shouted, “She won’t even listen, how are we supposed to protect her?” Slamming her hand on the wall.

“She only listens to those stronger than her, Her highness Sylph only steps on those weaker than her.” The other said, her words held weight as she served Sylph longer.

“Were the royal knights, how come the princess we’re supposed to protect is stronger than us?”

“We have to prove our strength, otherwise she won’t even glance at us.”

They quickly trod back to report the princess’s actions, not as if they can stop her.

Sylph Land at the base of the Yggdrasil like a boulder falling from the sky, leaving a small crater in the ground. Walking around for some time, sensing the magic lurking there.

“I could swear I felt a call, what was that feeling I got earlier?” She was confused, she had felt the world tree call her, yet when she arrived there was nothing. Usually, she finds some scoundrels trying to cut some of the tree’s bark or drain its sap.

This time she found nothing, no matter how long she searched, the tree was safe. Was it a mistake? no, Yggdrasil is always right. Then was I the one who misunderstood?

After making sure not a soul was close to the tree, she flew back to the capital, landing directly in the plaza. There was still some time to the auction, she could spend it looking around.

After about an hour, she was discovered by the guards sitting under a tree, enjoying some food.

“Your majesty, you need to return to the castle. Your father is worried.” The armored man said, extending a hand to help her stand.

Taking his gesture, she seemed to grab his hand gently. Suddenly clenching her fist, It didn’t matter if was wearing an armored gauntlet or not, under her grip, his hand turned into minced meat.

“Graaaaaaaaa!” He growled in pain, falling flat on his face, “My hand, My hand!” She couldn’t see his face because of the helmet, but she knew what kind of face he was making.

“Ara, Ara! Your bones are surprisingly fragile, you need some milk!” She rested her feet on his head, “See, I’m not stupid like you, I always finish my meals.” She continues eating, seemingly enjoying the man’s whining.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Each time he seemed to stop, she stomps on his hand so he will start screaming again. Her nickname, The sadistic princess had its truth.

After she finished eating, she stood and flew away, leaving the man on the ground. Just then the other knights dare to go check on him, one wrong move and they might have ended up like him.

They quickly used magic to take off his gauntlet, It was dripping with blood.

As they got his hand out they were surprised, It was fine. His hand was as healthy as it could be. “It’s always like this! Damn it!” One of the knights slammed his sword on the ground, looking at the princess flying in the distance.

‘I can’t just go around breaking my toys, I gotta fix the afterward.’ She healed the knight’s hand before she left, so she can torment him on another day.

Sylph headed directly toward the auction, It was almost time. She wanted to be there early so she can check the merchandise beforehand, she was looking for a strong slave she could fight to the death.

I wonder If I would find something amusing.

Clank! She landed gently in front of a large building, only the sound of her hear heels can be heard.

Click-clack, click-clack, click-clack, She walked in without care, treating the guards as if they were statues. They were already used to her being her to the point they learned to never stand in her way.

Restricted area? Private section? Dangerous monster cages? The auction treasury? Just open the door for her, if you didn’t she would walk right through it.

Sylph just walked to the auction hall and picked a seat at the front, After sitting there for a few moments. An old elf with a beard reaching to his knees came rushing.

“Your highness, how I might serve you?” He said, gently squeezing his hands together.

“The usual, the strongest one!” She comes here each week to buy the strongest slave available, give him a month’s rest and feed him well. After making sure he is in top condition, she fights him to the death.

If they win or at least amuse her, she sets them free with enough money to last them a year. If they didn’t, they are dead. Their survival rate is 6/10, most of the time she was just amused by their screams and to let them free.

She doesn’t buy those who don’t want to fight her.

As she was sitting there, she felt a slight headache. Thinking about it, she didn’t feel pain in decades, to her that was a happy occasion.

She stood up and walked to the slave quarter, The old elf was there as well.

“Your highness, you didn’t need to trouble yourself!” He gasped at her sight, her being there was a problem, she might end up killing someone.

“Don’t mind me, I’m just looking around!” she walked happily between the cells, casually opening them and checking the slaves on her own.

The slaves have already heard her name, they knew her face as their hands. If she told you to stand you stand, It was just fear from her chaotic behaviors.

After having fun playing around, she walked back to her seat, closing her eyes.

A surge of pain ran through her veins, causing her body to spasm and twist uncontrollably, sending tremors in the ground. The whole building was shocked as if it was an earthquake.

The manager thought she was rampaging again, crying about how much he is going to pay for repairs.

In her head, memories of another life flashed. A white-haired slave that she has bought, torturing him day and night. The second flipped around, her being enslaved by him. The world tree flashing, The armies of dragons raging, and a longing for his hand.

She stood breathing heavily, sweating all over her body. She remembered who she was going to be, who is her master. Checking herself, the enslavement seal was engraved on her soul!

“Master Cain Lisworth, we have survived!” She laughed, “I shall carry your will so I can earn my punis…reward.” she mumbled to herself, remembering the pleasing days.

Sylph left immediately for the elvish castle, forgetting all about buying slaves or fighting the strong. Her only thought was getting the throne so she can await her master’s orders.
