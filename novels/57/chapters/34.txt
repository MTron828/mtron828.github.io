After declaring that he was going to do it, Cain spent some time teaching Yamauba how to make healing potions. With that, it was well past noon so they stopped to eat lunch.

Yamauba did spend a lot of money that day because of Cain, Yet she still felt like she made a profit! The method of making healing potions was kept a secret by the alchemists. Now that she had learned it, their adventuring costs will significantly decrease!

After finishing their lunch, Cain called Sofia as he wanted to give her the jewelry.

The full set was quite stacked! Two sets of earrings, five rings, a chiseled collar, a necklace shaped like a spade, a set of ankle and wrists guards, and bracelets! Dolrig seems to have gone all out as they were all masterfully crafted. It’s been just a day, ‘I might need to buy him a drink, he must have spent the whole night working on them!’ Cain thought.

Cain had already prepared a needle to pierce Sofia’s ears and was hiding it behind him. He intended to make her wear all those at the same time!

The reason was simple, the mysterious material that was in the sword is Elvish Silver, a metal known for its high magic compatibility.

Yep, he wanted to enchant all of those and turn Sofia into a monster, there was a reason why sorceresses (Witches) are extremely strong that you might need a whole adventuring party just to kill one!

The moment Sofia saw all of the jewelry her eyes opened wide, a large smile on her face. “You brought us gifts? I will call Selena right away!” She rushed outside without giving Cain time to call her back.

He was stuck, ‘What I’m going to do now!’ he had intended to use everything on Sofia alone to make her as strong as possible. When catastrophe will happen, she was going to be their main damage dealer as an AOE spell caster, because That was the most efficient way to clear out large hordes of Undead and Ghosts!

It only took the girls a minute to come back, apparently, Selena was training with Takeshi when Sofia called her! She found them exchanging punches and thought they got into a real fight. Miko was also there to heal their bruises.

“Did you bring those for us-nya?” Her tail was wiggling like a fan, the sparkle in her eyes was just adorable.

“Yep he did, look there are so many!” Sofia said flipping the jewelry in her hands.

Seeing them act like that, Cain couldn’t speak. He isn’t going to ruin the moment by trying min-max Sofia!

In the end, they divided them between themselves. Selena seemed to be only interested in the ankle and wrist guards and the collar, she also took one of the five rings to put it as an engagement ring on her left hand.

Cain asked her if she wanted to take one of the earring sets but she refused. Her ears are sensitive and she uses them a lot! For her, it was just as uncomfortable to put earrings as it was for a human to put earrings on their eyelids!

Sofia took the rest, four rings, Ankle, and wrist bracelets, the two sets of earrings, and lastly the necklace!

“Can you put them on the table? I will add the last touch!” Cain told the girls to put the jewelry on the table for him to enchant it! His plan for the op Sofia has gone down the drain until he finds more Elvish silver but he could still make do with this!

Let’s start with Selena’s. ‘I would like to boot her strength, speed, and agility but that wouldn’t be safe in the fight!’

The collar was first, Jaguars are naturally good swimmers, to push on that further Cain enchanted the collar with [Holdbreath]. With that, she could hold her breath for up to 10 minutes at maximum output compared to about just one minute without the enchantment! The spell might have seemed niche but having more oxygen to work with, will also help her stamina!

A left foot ankle guard was enchanted with [Balance]. This enchantment will her greatly with her balance. She should now be able to balance herself on a thin rope, on her hands, and might even be able to dodge attacks without losing balance.

The right foot ankle guard was enchanted with [Mending] a weak repairing enchantment that could at least help her claws to stay sharp! As they weren’t exactly a living matter so healing magic couldn’t repair them!

The right-hand wrist guard was enchanted with the unique [Voice amplifier]. Selena’s roar was already loud enough, making it even louder so it can be used as a taunt and a way to scare weaker monsters!

The left-hand wrist guard was enchanted with [Tracking] Allowing Cain to detect her location and her basic stats. Of course, Selena didn’t mind being tracked as it will help Cain reach her in an emergency!

Lastly, the ring was enchanted with a [Lesser healing] that can be used once a day, allowing Selena to use it on herself.

…

As for Sofia’s Cain a whole other build on his mind!

“Sorry but it might be painful for you again, It’s just got like that when you try to tinker with the Mana circulation in living being!” Cain said apologetically.

“I don’t mind at this point, I will make sure to make you cry one day for it!” Sofia said, pinching Cain’s arm.

The enchanted the four rings with [Mana regeneration]. With each one providing a 1 MP per minute, Sofia had an increased regeneration of 4 MP per minute! It doesn’t seem like much but that meant she could refill her MP within 5 minutes of rest!

Of course, since most fights are a quick exchange that usually lasts less than a minute, those enchantments are meant to prepare her for a second fight!

The necklace was enchanted with [Mana bank], storing a total of 40 MP for Sofia to use! Sadly it could only refill with Cain’s MP as he was the one to create the enchantment. Sofia had to ask Cain to refill it each time!

The right ankle bracelet was enchanted with [Magic resistance] Allowing Sofia to take less damage from spells. This was effective since she could end up unable to dodge large AOE magic.

The left ankle was enchanted with [Impactless] greatly lessening the impact damage she would take. That was going to be useful if she was intending to fight like she did today!

The right-hand bracelet was enchanted with [Tracking] Just as Selena. With this, he could also detect her. With this, the situation with the Cobra won’t happen again!

The left-hand bracelet was enchanted with [Lesser healing] Allowing Sofia to heal herself once a day just like Selena.

Lastly the earrings, there were two sets and Cain enchanted them all with [Magic stability], making it easier for Sofia to control her spells!

As much as Sofia hated it, Cain managed to restrain and pierce her ears so she can put the earrings, a total of four holes!RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Selena easily put her jewelry on, happily admiring them!

Sofia on the other hand, most of her enchantment interfere directly with her Mana circulatory system. Especially the rings and earrings!

With each piece she put she could feel a sting in her body, it wasn’t as painful as she thought. Probably she felt more pain from piercing her ears!

For the rings, Sofia did put one as an engagement ring, one in her other hand, and the other two in her feet.

When she asked Cain why she has to put two rings on her feet he just replied, “Personal preference!”

Now that was done Cain was about to start preparing for the night, he had go back to Alice and find a clue about who did that to her.

It was then when Cain’s eyes fell on Sofia in weird angle, scanning her from the tips of her toes to her gleaming eyes. For some reason he couldn’t avert his eyes.

“Nya?” Selena had just entered his view as well, she as well was giving him this weird feeling.

His heart started racing as he barely managed to keep his breath steady! ‘Calm down! Calm down!”

He did know what was wrong with him, he could see it in the girls status! their charisma have increased as they put on the jewelry. Selena was still manageable but Sofia now had a 17! She was getting closer to the irresistible territory.

‘No, stop! It’s still day! Even tonight It’s Selena’s turn!’ he thought, ‘Were still in the dragon’s fang house as well! Only his 20 Intelligence is keeping him in place.

“Cain, are you okay?” Sofia asked as she noticed him staring at her.
