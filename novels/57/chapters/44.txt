“They must be asleep now, try to convince them tomorrow!” Cain said as he lay back on his bed. Alice was just there staring at him.

“It’s a one-way, I can’t return now!” Alice couldn’t go back even if she wanted! The ling is a one-way that teleported her to Cain’s location, she can’t teleport back. Add the fact she never left the mansion, she didn’t know the way back either!

‘Are we stuck? I don’t want to walk her to the mansion, it’s too far away!’ Cain thought. He took another look at Alice.

Her black wings were extending from her back even though she is wearing clothes, her tail was out as well. ‘Can’t she fly there?’

“How about you fly there? Those wings have a purpose!” He asked pointing at her wings.

Alice did try to fly inside her room but wasn’t able to do it, her wings were strong enough to carry her but she lacked control and practice! It also was exhausting, even if she had become a devil, her weak body stayed the same!

For now, she needed to focus on eating and exercising. She needs to get herself back in shape!

“I can’t, I’m not used to flying with them! The guards are still cleaning so they might spot me as well!” Alice said It seems as if her only option was to stay with Cain.

Cain thought about it for a moment, It was bad to stay with a girl without telling the other two! He needed to make sure the trust between them stays as solid as it is!

“Let’s go wake the other two, I don’t think they will be pleased so prepare yourself!” Cain said as he stood up. Upon hearing his words she steeled herself as waking them at this hour was a bad impression!

———————————-

[Devil’s Aura: Holy/Curse]

[Shapeshift: Human/Devil]

[Devil’s Eyes: Blazing Sun/Eminence Eclipse]

Amaterasu’s blessing: Sun.

[Holy Healing]

Amaterasu’s blessing: Eclipse.

[Cursed Decay]

———————————-

‘Holy…What in the hell did Amaterasu did this? A contradiction devil?’ Cain was surprised to see Alice’s stats for the first time, he should probably get used to apprising anyone he see from now on!

As he thought before, she had both Holy and Curse magic, those two shouldn’t exist in one person, especially since gods don’t get well with devils to grant them holy magic!

What Amaterasu did was probably the first time in history a god had granted a devil his blessing. Thinking about this Cain remembered that Amaterasu was the goddess of the sun, some saw her as a good god while other counted her as evil!

‘This is interesting, What is she planning? Dose she have anything to do with the catastrophe or she is on something even bigger?’ Cain had a nasty smile on his face, He hadn’t felt this exited in years!

“Are you okay?” Alice asked, a bit worried.

“Yeah, Let’s go meet the others!” Cain said opening the door, Alice had to make the best of this chance.

The first one they checked on was Selena, she seems to have smelled Alice as soon as she appeared and woke up.

“Hehe, I was about to check on you-nya!” Selena said as Cain and Alice found her awake.

Alice was nervous, she didn’t know where to start! After seeing how Selena fight’s, angering her wasn’t an option!

Out of nowhere, Selena started sniffing Alice, confusing her even further!

“What?…Emm… What I wanted to say is…” Alice wasn’t able to find the right words to convey her intention.

“From the end, she want to join the pride and wants to hear what you think!” Cain was the one to speak, making it as easy for Selena to understand.

For a moment, Alice didn’t understand what he meant by pride but she quickly linked the dots and figured it out. Blushing, she hid her hid her face.

“I don’t mind-nya. On the other hand, the bigger the pride the strongest is the male-nya! Its a source of ‘Pride’ to be a part in a bigger pride-nya!”

“That mean yes, in face she was encouraging you to join!” Cain translated what Selena meant to Alice who was still covering her face.

“By the way, how did she get here-nya? Can she fly-nya?”

Cain quickly explained what Alice can do. Selena was listening carefully.

“Can you use the same spell on me? I also want to get quick to you-nya!” Selena seemed to fully ignore the no-freedom part and focus on teleportation!

“Sadly I can’t, It’s complicated but I can’t just cast it on anyone!” Cain said, lying! He could cast the enslavement seal on anyone and making them summon-able was just as simple as binding a spell to the enslavement seal.

He just didn’t want to have to deal with more than two! Alice and the elf princess he enslaved in his past life!

‘Let’s check just to make sure both links are there!’

————————–

————————–

‘Good it seems that they both are linked! I was worried that one of them might malfunction.

The enslavement magic Cain used on both Sylph and Alice were unique as it was engraved on the soul! For Alice it didn’t that much, but for Sylph, It was a different matter!

Even after Cain reincarnated, she still held to the seal! That meant her memories as well! Sylph on the other side knows who Cain is and remembers everything from her past life! She must be searching for him right now!

‘I could just summon her now but I won’t have a way to send her back to the elvish palace!’ Cain didn’t to cause trouble and she was probably busy at this time! Unlike him she was hundreds of years old and is already at her peak right now, she would make a great trump card to use in case of emergencies.

…

Now it was time to meet Sofia, Cain was the one nervous for this as he didn’t know how he will react to seeing her! He should be able to resist but it was still hard!

Cain knocked on the door, “Sofia, It’s me can I get in?”

Sofia had just fell asleep so she replied in a tired voice, “Ah? Yeah, get in!”

The room was dark and Cain couldn’t see anything, Alice on the other hand was able to see as she is a devil. Her face said she saw something amazing as she started blushing!

Cain closed the door and lit the Candles, what he saw was breath taking to say the least!

Sofia who was only wearing her semi-transparent night gown on top of her underwear, she still had all the jewelry on so it was a double hit!

‘I didn’t expect this!’ Cain screamed internally as he fought the urge to let loss, even reaching point of biting the underside of his mouth.

Sofia quickly noticed Cain’s excitement, “Heh? Now?”

“Alice, Cover her up!” Cain said, he was ordering and not asking!

Alice’s body moved on it’s own, quickly covering Sofia’s body in the blanket! It took Cain a few moments to calm down, in that time he ignored all of what the two girls were saying!

“Thats better!” he said, finally sitting down.

“What is it? I don’t problem if you want to do it!” Sofia said, making Alice who just heard her blush as she thought about what they were about to do!

“You’re exhausted, you won’t be able to bear it!” Cain said, quickly starting to explain.

What having 17 Charisma meant, and why Alice who had 18 Wisdom wasn’t effected by it!

“Is it that effective?” Sofia can’t believe what she heard, she though Cain was joking.

“You will see it tomorrow when it’s your turn. I don’t think I will be able to hold back with you having 17 charisma! Honestly, I think it’s better to have another person you can switch with!” Cain was implying that Sofia alone won’t be able to take on him alone because of how high her charisma is!

“What? Are saying I will get exhausted before you?” Sofia was pouting, displeased by his implication.

“Can I talk?” Alice stopped them, she still hadn’t settled her matter.

They quickly explained to Sofia what they wanted to talk about, as well that Selena already accepted!

Sofia had a troubled look at her face, she didn’t hate Alice, and if nothing she wouldn’t mind. Yet she still had her concerns.

What if Cain started to care about them less when he will have three? Will accepting this make him bring more and more girls? Selena already accepted so refusing might cause problem between them!

She wanted to accept but was hesitating!

“How about this? If you’re unable to decide why not make it a bet?” Cain suggested, It was probably the best way to solve this problem!

“What do you mean?” The two girls asked in unison.

“Tomorrow is Sofia’s turn and I bet she wouldn’t be able to bear it alone! Selena would also fall to her charm as it above 15 charisma! This means the only one she could switch with is Alice who has 18 wisdom!” Cain told them what he wanted to do.

“Good! I will add a bet on my own then! If I tapped out, feel free to not stop! On the other hand if I won, I will have you obey my orders for a day!” Sofia added.

“I hope you stay true to your words!” Cain said.

Alice was just sitting there, confused!
