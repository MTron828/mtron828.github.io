Cain teleported to the girls using his [Mist step] He landed on one foot and smiled, “How was it?” He said with a smug smile.

“What do you mean by -how was it- When did you get that strong?” Sofia asked being surprised at how different he fought from the last time. When she met him at the start he was mostly using fire and his sword, later on, when he unlocked third-tier magic he focused on lightning-based magic and now he seemed to use a mixture between the two. ‘Where does he even learn all those spells?’

“I already know them, to be honest, and you might not believe me, I know spells from up to the Ninth-tier. Just like how you knew fireball before even reaching a level when you can use it.” Cain heard her thoughts and he answered them immediately. Sofia’s face flushed bright red as took a step back.

‘He can hear my thoughts? He did say that in the bath…does he know I was looking at his eyes all this time?’ She thought, she was afraid he noticed her admiring his glowing blue eyes.

“I now did, thank you. Your green eyes are stunning as well, like refined emerald!” Cain replied. He had no problem praising her eyes as she does with his eyes.

‘Mean’ Alice thought, ‘But now that I look at him, his eyes are beautiful!’

“I heard that as well. Your mismatched eyes have their charm, looking at them can be addictive at times.” Cain quickly turned to Alice who was by Sofia’s side. She as well had her face turn bright red.

Cain then turned toward Selena, her tail was wagging around like crazy. He didn’t need to hear her thoughts to guess. “I like how your eyes glow golden in the dark, they resemble the refined glittering of gold.”

Hearing that She quickly leaped toward him, he started patting her head as he looked toward Gracie. ‘Her eyes are as black as coal and as dead that lights can’t reflect from them, to be honest staring at them is like staring at the depth of the abyss’ Cain thought, he was lucky they can’t hear him as he does to them.

“You as well Gracie, your eyes have the same majestic glow of black diamond. They resemble endless darkness.” Hearing Cain’s praise, Gracie gently touched her eyelid. ‘But they resemble those of dead fish, he has a weird taste.’ Cain decided to pretend he hasn’t heard her think that, they had to start moving after all.

“Let’s go, we’re making good progress!” Cain said even though an hour hadn’t passed yet.

He started flying with Alice and Sofia while Selena jumped from one tree to the other. They moved for about half an hour before Cain signaled for them to stop, something was lurking around, a monster they met before.

“This smell-nya, It’s another snake-nya!” As Selena pointed out, a Crimson cobra was lurking around the area.

“At this point, we will end up bringing their extinction.” Cain sighed as they were about to fight the A-rank monster for the third time in less than a month. Which one he should send, Selena or Sofia? They both fought the crimson Cobra before…

“Sofia, you take care of it.” Cain suddenly said and Sofia stared at him pointing a finger at her face. “Me?”

“There isn’t another Sofia here, last time you ended at death door. This time I want you to kill that thing.” He pointed at the Crimson Cobra as it showed her head.

Cold sweat dripped from Sofia’s neck, she was still at the fourth level. She had heard from Mary that she needed to be at least tenth level to be able to fight A-rank monsters one on one. Even Selena who was at the ninth level found this monster hard to deal with, how could she possibly win.

Cain could hear her thoughts as well as understand her feeling. “I don’t want to repeat the same speech with Alice. You can do it, just concentrate and stay calm.”

Sofia quickly shook her head, “You’re right, I will believe in myself.” She took a deep breath and let her magic circulate over her whole body. In a single blink, her eyes had turned to that of a dragon, glowing bright red as she stared directly at the Crimson Cobra.

The crimson Cobra immediately looked up toward Sofia, she sensed the heat that was building up inside the girl’s body.

Seeing the world through her dragon eyes gave her a sense of supremacy as she looked down at the massive Cobra. She quickly erased that feeling from her head remembering how strong the Cobra was.

Cain heard Sofia’s thoughts as she looked down at the Cobra. To him, such a feeling was normal for someone like her who had dragon’s blood. All dragons were arrogant and proud, Zaleria might have seemed nice but she is a weirdo between dragons for treating human-like she does. It’s like a human who developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to their pet.

Sofia jumped down from the tree directly at the Cobra’s head, the monster naturally opened its mouth to catch her. At that moment Cain heard a lot of thoughts running through Sofia’s head and he smiled, she won’t need his help it seems.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

[Fireball] Just a moment before she could be bitten by the Cobra, A fireball emerged from her feet and flew directly into the Cobra’s mouth. In the next moment, [Burning feet] Sofia flew toward the back of the cobra so She could burn its eyes.

SWOOOT! The Cobra’s swung its tail toward Sofia at an incredible speed. [Burning hands] Sofia pushed herself toward the Cobra’s head and avoided the strike. “I can see everything!” Selena’s eyes can see both heat and the ethereal world. When the cobra is about to attack, Sofia can see its lukewarm blood move to whatever part she was attacking with.

“Lay, DOWN” Glared at the Cobra’s eyes and screamed, the wild monster froze from terror for a second. Sofia’s 19 charisma was no joke when it comes to things like this. [Burning feet] Using this spell to spin at high speed and then using [Fireblade] [Fireblade] to create a fire blade at each of her open palms, Sofia struck at the cobra’s head.

The first swing Cut the cobra’s eyes and left a small wound across its skull. The second strike came a few milliseconds later just deepened the wounds exposing the monster’s skull. With How fast Sofia spun, she had delivered at least ten slashes with her fire blades before they vanish. Cutting right through the monster’s skull.

[Burning feet] Sofia then stabilized herself mid-air and watched the Cobra fall, ‘It’s dead, right?” She then flew directly toward Cain with a big smile on her face. She remembered how she could launch fire bolts from her feet and what Selena told her about Cain defeating the cobra with a giant fireball to the throat and slicing it with his blade. She could then launch a [Fireball] from her feet toward the Cobra’s mouth.

Using her charisma was something Cain taught her at the goblin fight, she couldn’t possibly miss the chance to use it now that she increased her charisma.

For the slicing part, she had to get a bit creative. Remembering how Cain used his lightning sword to cut things and how Zaleria taught her to fly with her flames, she came with that spinning slash to compensate for her lack of strength.

“How did I do?” She asked Cain with a cute smile, her hands behind her back. Cain hugged her to his chest, “I’m proud of you, one day you will be as strong as your grandma.” He patted her back.

Alice and Selena looked at Sofia with a bit of jealousy, They also wanted to get a hug. Gracie on the other hand awaited her turn, seeing them fight had made her want to test her skills as well.

‘Master, might allow me to feel yesterday’s feeling again!’ She thought. Cain who was hugging Sofia heard her and he forced himself to not laugh. ‘she could just ask.’ he thought.
