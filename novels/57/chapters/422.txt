~Can you understand me now~ a voice rang in her head.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Who are you? No…What are you?” The dragon screamed at the top of her lungs, so flames emerged from her throat.

~You already know who I am, but what I might be is none of your concerns~ Cain replied with [Message] Even though Karon had a high intelligence score, she lacked the ability to interpret telepathic links to the point that Cain had to modify the spell to be able to talk to her.

“You’re right, white mage. My job is to bring your head back to the king.” Flames started erupting from under her skin cracking it.

~It’s useless, you can’t…I guess I’m facing a dragon, anything is possible~ Cain sighed sensing the massive amount of magic being released from her.

BAM! Using her incredible strength and a massive explosion under her she propelled herself toward Cain at high speed. BAM! BAM! Multiple secondary explosions kept her speed up till she reached Cain’s head.

ZON! Cain’s titanic body teleported behind her and then smacked her toward the ground. It was almost unfathomable how such a massive creature could move so fast.

Blugh! The dragon coughed blood as her vision got blurred from the impact. A smile crossed her face, “You taste awful, extremely salty.” She spat a big chunk of Cain’s flesh.

Cain glared at his hand, she had taken a bite from it in that short moment.

‘This body’s main power is amplifying magic’ Cain’s first brain thought. ‘If the target is strong enough to resist madness, it’s like a human fighting a bee’ the second brain thought.

The golden ring of the magic behind Cain started to glow and his wounds healed. ‘I will control the body’ the first brain started, ‘I will control the magic’ the second one added.

Karon leaped back up spitting the blood from her mouth, “Come let’s dance?” She looked up but the monster has disappeared.

“Looking for me?” A voice came from behind her.

Scared, Karon turned around with a punch at her full strength. It was a mistake to fight the white mage alone, she needed at least a couple more dragons to secure victory.

Clap! Cain easily deflected her 47 strength punch, this has thrown her mind in a loop. She was sure Cain had no more strength than 20 by his look alone.

“You monster?” She screamed opening her mouth, and a fire breath exploded.

Cain’s hand easily passed through her flames and forced her jaw shut. “You hurt my feeling, even I know I am already a monster. You don’t need to bring it up, do you?” Cain punched her away as hard as she could.

‘The enchantment is stable’ the first brain said, ‘Usage is stable, everything is normal’ the second brain confirmed.

Cain could before enchant his body with elemental magic, now he did something a bit different. He enchanted his body with [Telekinesis]

“From when does something like you have feelings? Say what is your goal? Why are you interfering with us dragons?” She growled standing back up with a smile, no one beside her husband had punched her this hard.

“My goal is simple, to prove both you and the elves wrong. Your king is taking it to the extreme while the elves just sit and watch, that isn’t the solution!” Cain stood still.

“Then die, I shall grind your bones on the ground!” Karon rushed at him with all of her might.

“You might need to rethink your wording. If you wanted to survive, you better prove to me that you’re better than a fat, juicy piece of meat.” Cain only saw her as 10 soul fragments, to his she was another random dragon that he killed hundreds of in his past life.

Cain pulled out his [Blade of Disaster] [Thunder Step] a single swing was enough to behead her.

Thwack! Her headless body twisted, kicking Cain in the side. As Cain flew backward, he could read her mind through [Message] she couldn’t respond to the telepathic link but he could forcefully read her.

~I won’t die, he is waiting for me~ she was screaming internally.

Her body blasted toward him in a ball of pure flames, BAN! She punched Cain over and over, and each time her fists connected with his telekinetic shield her rage increased.

“You’re truly a wyrm, let’s see you survive this!” Cain leaped back and [Thunder step] He delivered a single punch with all of his might to her heart. His fist blasted through her chest turning her heart and spine to shreds.

As her body flew away with a rain of blood, Cain was waiting to get his soul fragments. Those attacks seemed simple but he was putting too much Mana behind them, more than he did to eight-tier spells.

~Dakin, I won’t submit to another…~ He heard her thoughts as her body rolled on the ground.

‘Thinking of her mate? A nice though for a…’ Cain realized that he still didn’t get the soul fragments.

~…Only you~

Her muscles started twitching, there was no heart to pump her blood nor a nervous system to carry more of her thoughts. Only what remained was the regret engraved in her soul…Her Draconis fundamentum pulsed.

What tiny nerves remained scattered across her body bound to gather to form a signal. Her muscles started contracting to force the blood across her body. Since her lungs were so damaged, her thick draconic blood started absorbing oxygen directly from her open wounds.

~My love…This monster shall never exist in the same world as you~ her body exploded into flames.

This only took a fragment of a second, faster than Cain could react, a dragon’s last fight for survival. From the flames, her massive dragon claw emerged smacking Cain across the deserted plan.

As the entire demi-plan started to quake, Cain flew away with a massive wound across his chest. “Fuck, she was but a wyrm. Did she grow just to kill me?” This wasn’t something that a wyrm like her should be able to do, or there was something more to her.

ROAR! The headless dragon chased Cain immediately, Karon was much faster than before, and each wing flap caused a massive explosion of flames around her body.

Cain started flying backward while keeping an eye on her. [Dark Star] [Elemental burst: Ice] [Elemental burst: Lightning].

No matter what he threw at her, she burned right through them, as if she wasn’t reacting to pain or injury. She didn’t expect to live after this so she was fighting to die.

‘I can’t force her into a humanoid shape as she seems to have lost her mind, she is a mindless killing machine that can only see me’ Cain thought transforming into his Abominable chimera form and smacking her with his fist.

As his hand started to burn, he teleported away dropping a meteor on her and teleported to safety. She quickly flew behind him using her flames as a propellant.

Cain was getting ready to blast her with the whole place as she approached his neck.

CRACK! The air behind his massive head cracked.

Three people leaped in to help him.
