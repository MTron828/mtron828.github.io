Cain slowly opened the door to the room located on the left side of the second floor, Olivia gasped at the exotic sight of weirdly proportioned glassware and vials. Zaleria on the other hand walked straight to the desk and examined the equipment.

“It’s kind of creepy the layout looks similar to my lab, where did you learn such a thing?” Zaleria looked at him lifting an eyebrow. Cain shrugged slightly at the sharp glare of his former master.

“I just thought this layout was efficient, It’s simpler to separate the magic alchemy from the traditional alchemy.” Zaleria still had her doubts after hearing his explanation but she decided to ignore it as it wasn’t important.

Traditional alchemy was the process of browsing concoctions without the use of magical water. Both making acid and tea are considered traditional alchemy. The ingredients are dissolved in water or other non-magical solutions.

Magical alchemy on the other hand uses magical water, the same thing as holy water but this was embedded with Mana instead of holy magic. That magical water had the property of being able to dissolve magical effects from ingredients.

Let’s take the succubus’s tail that Cain got from the mine’s Cubas as an example. If you boiled in normal water you will get a horrendous succubus’s tail soup. But if you used magical water with the right amount of heat and care, you can get a charm-repellent concoction.

“Let’s start right away, first I will teach you how to make a petrifying concoction.” Cain pulled a jar from the drawer. The jar was holding a gross-greenish liquid with a menacing eye floating in it.

Seeing that strange horror, Olivia rushed to puke in the nearby bucket. Cain looked at her with a tense face. “And I was thinking of having you do fresh extracting, get a hold of yourself.” He said as opened the jar and pulled the eye out with his bare hands. “See, it won’t bite.”

“No, you’re the strange one. Even the most experienced Alchemists would be worried about picking something like that with their bare hands.” It was Zaleria who spoke up with a disgusted face.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Cain gave her a face of disbelief, ‘I call hypocrisy. I saw you gouge organs and taste them while they were still screaming! I will never forget that poor giant who you gouged his liver while he was still alive, even so, you made a potion of giant strength from it and drank it in front of his dying body.’

At that time Zaleria was pretending to be a human in front of Cain so the scene was more terrifying. Cain’s manner-less behavior and weird sense of disgust came from being taught by her.

“Oh please, how come someone like you is talking about stupid things like this?” Cain looked down at Olivia. “Have you calmed down?” he handed her a cup of water.

She slowly stood up after cleaning her mouth. “I will do it, I’m not going to give up this easily.”

After nodding at her determination, Cain taught her how to make the petrifying potion. “You don’t need to understand anything, just memorize what I’m doing and repeat the same thing.” It took him about an hour to get her to memorize everything, he even wrote each step for her on a sheet of paper.

“Like this?” She asked and Cain smiled at her, “Good, I will now start working with her since she seems to be getting sleepy. If you forget anything feels free to ask me.” Hearing his words Olivia energetically turned to resume her work. Cain on the other hand turned toward Zaleria and Said.

“Get on the bed, it will be painful so brace yourself.” Zaleria snorted at his words, She had 29 constitutions. Pain is a feeling she had forgotten long ago. She threw herself on the bed and handed him her hand with a confident face.

“Ready?” Cain looked at her as he held her pinky finger. “Wait, where are your equipment and…AGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!” Zaleria wailed in pain as a tearing sensation rushed from her nail down to her eyes. She had not felt pain in over 200 years that it felt alien. She quickly pulled her hand and jumped from the bed at a terrifying speed and stuck to the corners sweating.

Cain looked at her with an indifferent face and said bluntly, “First one succeeded, come here I still have over thirty.” He weirdly wiggled his fingers calling her back to the bed. Those inscriptions have been created by her in his past life. When he was to enchant her nails back then, Zaleria tied herself to the bench and gave him an order to not stop until they were all implanted. For her at that time, it was a whole week of torture that had even left her with a mental scare. Each time she saw Cain after it she will flinch.

“What did you do?” She said being surprised at what he just did presumably out of thin air.

“Greater rune, it increased your Dexterity by 2. It will kill normal people though.” Humanoids were simply not able to endure such pain, their hearts will just give up on life with that kind of pain. A person in Cain’s past described it as if all your bone were teeth and they all got pulled at the same time.

“That’s amazing but hell no, I’m not going to be your test subject anymore.” Zaleria looked at him with a fearful face.

“Are you a little coward lizard whose only talent is to squeal like a dog getting kicked? Are you mentally weak that you can this easily get back on your words?” Cain mocked her intentionally. Dragons were prideful creatures and they would never accept such a thing as cowardliness or being called dishonest.

Being a bit enraged, Zaleria walked back to the bed and handed her hand to Cain. “Do them, there is nothing that I can’t take.” She said with pride, but as soon as she saw Cain’s hand get closer she whispered, “Try to be gentle though.”

Cain didn’t want her to have any mental scars so he stopped after the third nail saying it was his limit. Having her hate or be scared of him will be a problem, yet just with those three, he should have given her a nasty edge against her sister.

Zaleria was naturally stronger than Morena but the latter used undead to boost her strength as a necromancer. Morena will never fight Zaleria to the death, face to face. She would always have a couple of death knights fighting by her side.

For that Cain only used higher buffs that could kill a human-like Sofia, the one he used on Zaleria were.

[Seal of Dexterity: +2 Dexterity] Zaleria only had 10 Dexterity which was pathetic, with she can at least do some acrobatic skills.

[Seal of Holy smite: Give Holy attribute to a single attack once per day] Her fire breath against the hordes of undead crawling in the catastrophe, how much work she will save him.

[Seal of body attraction: Body parts get attracted to the main frame] If any of her body parts got chopped off, they will fly back to her immediately so she can heal them if possible.

“Those!” Zaleria looked at her hands in shock, “What do you think? Pretty nasty aren’t they?” Looking at his evil smile Zaleria understood what kind of eldritch horror he was making her. Being a dragon she knew well how strong she was yet those buffs made her even stronger without giving her any more raw strength.

“Master, I came to report in.” Gracie knocked at the door. Cain remembered that he has to train her as well.
