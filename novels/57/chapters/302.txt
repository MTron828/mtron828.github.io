[Teleport] Cain instantly teleported a few feet behind Kayden effectively dodging all the slashes.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Such attack has no meaning if they can’t reach me!” Cain laughed as he floated behind Kayden.

“Think twice, my blade always chases its prey,” Kayden growled as a crack appeared on Cain’s leg.

CRACK! Other cracks appeared on Cain’s arms and torso. Kayden’s attacks might not have wounded Cain but they sure landed.

As Kayden was falling, he stared at Cain and took a deep breath. Tightly gripping his sword, his muscles tensed. [Limited Teleportation] By teleporting multiple times in a row, Kayden reached Cain almost immediately.

“Let’s have another serious match!” [Blade flow: Ashura’s dance] Kayden has returned to using a single sword. His attacks flowed like homing magic following Cain.

Crack! Cain was forced to free himself from the petrification to keep up. Kayden’s attacks were too fast and precise to be dodged just with the clunky teleportation.

There was another thing that impressed Cain about Kayden besides his fighting skills. Even though the man can’t fly. Kayden was using [Limited teleportation] to follow Cain.

‘Such efficient use of magic, combined with his sword skills and demonic innate aggressiveness. If this man reached level 100, he might even be able to entertain Eilistraee’ Cain found himself comparing Kayden’s relentless slashes to that of the dark elf queen. [Blade Flow] and [Blade Dance] seemed similar enough as they both focus on using the momentum to keep the attacks going.

What made Kayden’s [Blade Flow] appear even more similar to [Blade Dance] was his constant teleportation after Cain like a relentless hound.

Eilistraee didn’t use any teleportation or magic, just her skills and speed alone gave the impression of her constantly teleporting to her opponent back.

[Thunder Step] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Elemental Blade: Holy sword] As Cain used thunder step to rush at Kayden like a raging thunderbolt, he absorbed an enormous amount of holy magic from Alice and compressed it into a blade.

He absorbed so much that Alice back home felt weak, she instantly knew that he drained some of her magic. ‘Is this how Cain feels when Sofia keeps sucking his magic? Should I go to him, he didn’t call me?’ Alice thought as she stared out of the window.

Cain’s holy sword clashed with Kayden’s demonic blade causing a massive shock wave. “What is this-nya!” Selena barely managed to hold herself down with her claws. She was like a leave trying not to get swooped by the wind.

“Such immense prowess!” Chad exclaimed as he stood unfazed (His weight was still increased from Cain’s enchantment so that was holding him to the ground)

CLANK! As the blades clashed, a shockwave was released after the other. [Fireball] [Fireball] [Fireball] Cain released their fireballs at Kayden in the hope to stall him down.

Kayden took a deep breath and swung his sword, [Triple Slash] he sliced all the fireballs at once.

Cain smiled, “Bingo!” It was intentional. Cain knew fireballs are nothing to Kayden so he sent him exactly three as a trap.

CRACK! From the core of each fireball, a shard of Ice appeared. Kayden immediately realized it was a trap. [Ice storm] [Ice Storm] [Ice storm] Each shard exploded into a massive whirlwind of snow, violent wind, and sharp shards of compressed Ice.

Cain floated back to see how Kayden will react, it wasn’t easy to defend against such a large-scale spell. It didn’t take him enough to find out.

Kayden quickly pulled his other three swords and teleported right to Cain’s face. “I told you before, it doesn’t matter if it didn’t hit me!” [Hallucinatory Terrain] [Fear] A massive sphere of darkness engulfed the both of them, as Cain looked around, multiple red eyes stared at him.

Kayden rushed at Cain and swung his four blades, “Simple!” Cain glared at Kayden with a bored expression. It was then that Kayden realized that using magic against Cain was useless.

Cain immediately erased Kayden’s [Hallucinatory Terrain] and [Fear] with a powerful [Dispel Magic]

“This is how magic should be used!” Cain teleported behind Kayden and created his own version of [Hallucinatory Terrain] and [Fear]

In the next moment, Kayden found himself above an endless green ocean. His teleportation failed to work so he fell into the water.

“What is this?” Kayden thought that [Hallucinatory Terrain] created a mere illusion that helped him hide, use sneak attacks, and hide his location while still confusing the enemy.

Cain’s Hallucinatory Terrain felt too real, Kayden could feel the cold water around him. Smell its foul smell and has even lost his ability to use [Limited Teleportation]

As Kayden stared at the depth, two massive blue eyes glared back at him. “You die here, fool!” Kayden could feel himself getting sucked toward the gigantic monster’s maw.

Outside the [Hallucinatory Terrain] Cain was staring at Kayden’s body teleporting around.

Cain’s [Hallucinatory Terrain] worked a bit differently, it followed Kayden around so it made it seem like he can’t use teleportation. Cain also used enchanting with fear to give Kayden a sensory feeling of the illusion.

Suddenly, Cain saw a black slash fly toward him. [Teleportation] Cain managed to dodge it at the last second. [Demon Blade: Demonic slashes storm] Kayden was sending flying slashes of compressed demonic energy in all directions.

‘Tch! At this rate, he might hit Father or Selena.’ Cain immediately dispelled his [Hallucinatory Terrain]

“So it worked, it was but an illusion after all!” Kayden gave Cain a smug smile. He realized that Cain must have been hiding somewhere he started attacking randomly in the hope to hit him.

“Hey, that was dangerous! I will kill you if you injured any of them!” Cain yelled at Kayden pointing toward Selena and Chad.

“Then don’t trap like that, it’s your problem.” Kayden teleported right to Cain’s face with a slash. [Demon Blade: Blade of Doom] [Blade flow: Beheading]

[Blade of Disaster] Cain used one of his ninth-level spells to create a blade of compressed magical power. Everything that touches the blade gets overwhelmed and rendered onto ash. [Telekinesis] Cain used it to control the blade while adding, [Blade Dance: Mid-night dance under the moon] It was the first time Cain tried to force one of [Blade Dance] skills.

Cain’s blade spun around toward Kayden’s chest, this was the first time in this fight they clashed seriously.

Thud! Both Kayden and Cain felt something heavy fall on the back of their necks. The next thing they knew was the feeling of dirt under their faces.

Kayden slowly lifted his face up to see what happen. Chad was standing beside them, “Chill down a bit!” Chad stared at them.

“W-what did you do?” Kayden growled.

Chad looked at him and smiled, “Charisma to stop you for a fraction of a second and then used both of my hands to smack the both of you to the ground.” Replied Chad as he put his hands on his waist. Neither of them had the qualification to withstand Chad’s Charisma or raw strength.

“Let’s team up on this…”Kayden looked at Cain for help but was disappointed. Cain was knocked out cold. He lacked the physical stats to withstand a direct hit from Chad.

“Such a…” Kayden’s body finally gave up and he fell unconscious from both exhaustion and Chad’s hit. The fight ended in Chad’s victory.
