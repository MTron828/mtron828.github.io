They finally reached an empty counter, Cain faced the receptionist there and smiled. “Can I get a list paper? I do want to buy some things.”

“Here you go, some ingredients might be pricey so mind the quantity you order.” The woman handed Cain a sheet of paper and a pen to write with, he quickly went and wrote all that he needed.

The moment he handed her the paper she gave it a quick read and her eyes went wide, “This will be at least 50 gold coins, are you sure you want me to register the order.” She asked.

50 Gold coins were more than what a normal person could pay in their entire life. Her asking him is a reasonable thing.

“Of course, here.” Cain showed her a bag filled with about 80 gold coins to put her mind at ease, he was going to pay.

“I see, then I will put the order right away. Please wait patiently.” The woman grabbed the paper and went into the stock house in the back. After a few minutes, she came back followed by three big men carrying the heavy bags.

“Sir, the total price is 49 gold coins and 1 silver coin.” The woman gave Cain the paper where she had rote the detailed pricing. As the purchase was big, she seems to have used all the available discounts to get Cain the best deal. The original price was 58 gold coins and 5 silver but she managed to bring it down.

“Please do come back.” The woman smiled at Cain.

The reason was simple, if someone made such a purchase, they are most likely sent by a big alchemist so giving them the best treatment is profitable for the guild in the long term.

“Yeah, would you register her as an alchemist?” Cain pushed Olivia ahead. She quickly shrunk back and hid behind him.

“Of course, but she needs to pass the test first.” The receptionist replied with a big smile.

“How much is the test?” Cain asked as he knew it wasn’t free.

“Two silver coins, just the price of the ingredients they are going to use.” The woman smiled as she brought a paper for Cain with all the ingredients for the test.

“So they need to make either, a healing, an MP, or an SP potion?” Cain asked looking at the ingredients.

“That’s right, she will be registered as a novice alchemist if she managed to mix a weak healing potion. You can bring your own ingredients and then you will only need to pay 5 copper coins for the test.”

“No need, we will use the guild’s ingredients.” Sadly Cain doesn’t have enough dungeon cores to go back, he should ask Mary to give him a list of dungeons in the area.

“Please then do wait for a moment, the test will be ready soon.” The woman smiled as she went upstairs. Cain chose a bench and sat on it with Mary and Olivia.

“Are you sure I can succeed?” Olivia asked with a worried face, her hands were already shaking.

“Nervous, I can help then.” Cain touched her forehead with his finger and used a weaker version of [Hallucinatory Terrain] that only worked on her. As the spell took effect, all the people in the guilds seemed to resemble dolls, and vegetables and even disappear.

“Just imagine that you’re working alone in your lab as usual. Feel free to make the people here look however you find comfortable.

Olivia smiled, she wasn’t that good with people so this could really help. After concentrating for a moment she made everyone look like Cain. He was the person she was most comfortable around after all.

“The test is ready, please follow us upstairs.” The woman called Cain and the girls. They quickly stood and followed her.

Upstairs in what seemed like a well-organized lab. A single messy woman was half asleep on her desk. The woman’s eyes had black spots under them, her hair was messy and her clothes were stained with alchemical concoctions. The Cain and the other girls entered, and she opened one eye to look at them.

“They fail, get them out!” The woman yawned as she closed her eye to sleep.

The receptionist’s face grew tense, she turned toward Cain with a smile. “Please excuse me for a second, I will deal with this quickly.” She walked toward the half-asleep woman, grabbed her by the hair, and lifted her head up. BANG! She then smacked her head on the table.

“Wake up guild master, this isn’t the time for your stupid ideas!” The receptionist growled in anger, “Look at them, they are…” the guild master tried to speak but. BANG! BANG! BANG! The receptionist wasn’t listening to her.

Cain glared at the guild master to apprise her, and see what kind of woman she was.

‘Oh, she is what Olivia will become if I left her alone for a long time. Her max HP is even reduced due to her senses being physically damaged’

“Fine, fine, let them start mixing.” The guild master growled, she didn’t want the receptionist to beat her anymore.

After taking a deep breath, Olivia went to the nearest table and started mixing the potion with the herbs the guild provided.

“Olivia, Can you create something better?” Cain asked as he looked at her.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“I can’t with the ingredient here,” Olivia replied.

“What do you need?” Cain asked.

“The Mana water they have here is bad and the troll blood isn’t that potent. I would prefer to have your water and blood.” Olivia said while mixing.

“Ok, those can be easily accessible.” Cain walked toward the counter and used [Create water] to fill one of the cups with a Mana dense water. And then took the knife Olivia used to chop the herbs to draw some blood for her.

“Are you sure? Human blood lacks any alchemical value and it might even ruin your potion.” The receptionist warned them. Her words were true if Cain was a regular human. But now he is an abomination, a magical monster in the shape of a human.

“Let them be…Yawn…I don’t know about his blood but…Hey young man, I can sell you this woman for a barrel of that water.” The guild master pushed the receptionist toward Cain.

“Guild master?” The receptionist glared at her with an angry face.

“Sorry, he has enough women. It’s better to pay yourself.” Mary interrupted them.

“What do you mean?” the guild master looked at her.

“I will convince him to give you a steady supply of water in exchange for a steady supply of equally valued ingredients or services from the guild,” Mary explained, this was a good time to strike a deal.

“Is that so…Fine you can have it your way.” The guild master surprisingly agreed.

“I finished, this is the potion.” Olivia suddenly called out. She finished faster than usual. Probably since she only had a single potion to work on.

The receptionist brought the potion to the guild master, “It’s unusually red, seems like a high-quality product but it lacks the yellow dust they usually have.”

The guild master cracked the bottle open and down it all at once. At that moment she felt her body heating up, her stomach twist, and her back shivering.

She gripped the bottle tightly and banged her aching head on the table repeatedly. Cain smiled, ‘It worked perfectly.’

“Guild master, are you all right?” The receptionist rushed toward her with a worried face. She has never seen her react like this to drinking any potion.

The guild master slowly lifted her head glaring at Cain and Olivia and then slowly turned toward the receptionist. “Bring me an appraisal orb.” She said with a shaking voice.
