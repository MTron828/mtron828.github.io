Cain woke up the next morning with his hips hurting, stretching his back like a cat he heard a greeting coming from the side. “Good morning master.” It was Gracie, she seems to have woken a bit earlier and was preparing to wake them up.

[Sylph’s tiny hut] Cain recast the spell as it has ended when he fell asleep. He wanted to be able to look at Sofia without going Crazy for once and he got what he wished for.

The girls were sleeping peacefully beside him, he slowly took the cover of them to have a look and Sofia was stunning. It was as if her body glimmered under the sunlight and the smell rising from her was sweet, even with the spell he still have a big urge to give it another round.

“Master, I have something to ask.” Gracie’s words interrupted his thought and he was grateful. He wanted to go set the traps and find some way to level up even quicker, he also had to give Olivia another recipe and discuss some things with the druids.

“What is it?” Cain replied to her, “Do you need something?”

“You didn’t punish me yesterday, I still can’t cast the spell.” Cain rolled his eyes, was she still stuck on that part? He had told her before to try and avoid things like this but all his plans are failing.

“Come closer.” He ordered her to stand in front of him, “I won’t punish you as I said before, instead I want you to stay home today and keep an eye on Sofia. Don’t let her out of this room no matter what, and never let any man see her.”

Gracie nodded in agreement, from the start she wished to never have to strip in front of him. ‘Is he aiming for something else from me?’ She thought, Can was clearly after something else, any other noble would have had her at his bed several times by now, not was weird that he hasn’t laid a hand on a single maid.

“Cain are you awake?” Sofia grumbled as the sunlight blinded her sleepy eyes, Cain’s heart pounded like a drum but he managed to keep cool thanks to the spell.

“What do I look to you?” She giggled at his response. Their voices seem to have woken the other two as they stretched in place.

“I almost forgot, would you mind handing me your left foot?” Cain asked her with a charming smile, she only suspected that he still had some desires to take care so she complied. “What I’m going to do with you?” She said with a grin.

FISSHHHH! That smile quickly disappeared from her face as the burning pain caused her to spasm out like a dying fish. “AGRAAA! What the hell…”She quickly pulled her leg from his hand and checked it she could swear he must have pulled one of her toes out.

“Sorry, It’s just the buff for the fourth level. I decided on this after seeing you fight yesterday but I know it’s too painful for you to accept so…” He looked to the side.

“Even so, don’t just hit me with it like that! I would let you do it even if I know it will cause me to wallow in pain for a second. What does even do?” She gasped and kicked him in the guts, yet she was thankful it ended without her knowing.

“Why are you noisy?” Alice yawned as she crawled toward Cain, “Nya!” Selena curled up to his leg and fell back to sleep.

“This one will cause magic to course through your body and make it more durable, it gives you one point in the constitution.” It was a weakened down version of what he used on Zaleria, in her case he increased her dexterity by 2. It’s a buff that increases stats but with each point the pain triple and it could kill.

Cain smiled at her as stood up, he had work to do so she stood as well. “No, you are staying here, I can’t have you wander around with 19 charisma. You might have controlled it a bit yesterday but it’s still dangerous.” Cain stopped her immediately, “I know, I just wanted to wear something.” She replied.

After checking that everything was alright, Cain wore his clothes with Gracie’s help and headed downstairs to the kitchen to find something to eat. Gracie will bring food for Sofia once she has changed her clothes.

“Is there something to eat?” Cain asked the maid who was absorbed in her work steering a large pot. “KYA!” She gasped and dropped the ladle inside.

“Master, when did you get here?” Her face was red, and her breathing was heavy. ‘I must have scared her a lot’ He thought as he gave her a slight bow, “Sorry I didn’t mean to scare you.”

Being perplexed at her master suddenly bowing to her, she had no choice but to stop him apologizing, “Please stop master, it wasn’t your fault. Did you need me for something?”

“I was looking for something to eat, some milk and bread in enough.” He said looking toward an old pot that had traces of milk on it.

“At once. I will get you…Kya!” she fell on her face, This time she was wearing pink panties with some white garter belt-style thigh highs.

“This is the second time you know?” Cain said as he stared at her exposed backside, it was wider than what the girls had.

At that moment Lexi walked in, seeing that sight her face flushed red as she hurried to help Diana.

“What are you doing!” Lexi yelled and Diana just replied with a sob.

“Let’s help her up,” Cain said giving Lexi a hand in helping Diana stand.

“Sorry, she usually gets nervous easily and ends up acting like this.” Lexi apologized on Diana’s behalf, “It’s not a problem, let me see her face.” [Lesser Healing] Cain healed Diana’s red nose, she must have smacked him hard.

“By the way…” Cain called Lexi and whispered something to her ear, her face flushed red but soon bowed to him. “I will ask the others and get some ready for the ladies, I hope it will be to your liking.” She quickly rushed out.

After eating his breakfast he hurried up to the Alchemy room where he found Olivia working with Zaleria lazing around. “Master, good morning!” Olivia stopped what she was doing and greeted him.

“Did you have a fun night?” Zaleria grinned at him, “Thanks for your help, It would have taken them several tries if not for you.”

“Don’t say that, Sofia found the solution on her own, I just set her on the track.” Zaleria waved her hand.

Cain then proceeded to write a new recipe, an anti-charm potion utilizing the succubus tail. The tail was chopped into small cubs and stored in jars under the large desk. Olivia gagged at the horrid smell when she opened one of them.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Fun fact, to me it smells wonderful, like freshly roasted meant. It only smells horrid to women since we took it from a Succubus.” It will have been the exact opposite if they took it from an incubus. It all depends on what form the Cubas was taking when the part was taken.

Cain took a piece of clothing and enchanted it with the Vanilla smell he liked too much. “Use this, it smells wonderful.” He gave it to Olivia to use as a face mask.

“What is this, I never smelled something like it!” Olivia took a deep whiff, she couldn’t believe this was the same rug laying in the drawer.

“It’s a rare herb called Vanilla, It’s amazing isn’t it!” He was happy to find someone else to share the Vanilla love with them, They even made Zaleria try and she liked it. After that, he gave her another two recipes, it was Healing potions and Mana potions.

He only needed one of the anti-charm for Sofia in a week, on the other days he wanted Olivia to work on that they might need a lot and it was those two.

After that he turned his attention to Zaleria, She still had 17 fingers left to enchant and he cracked his knuckles. “As a thank you for your help yesterday, I will do seven for you!”

Zaleria backed down with sweat running down her face, she gulped and said. “Three are enough, maybe just two? I don’t mind!” She was terrified remembering how badly it hurt last time.

“Be obedient and lay on the bed, this is for your own good!” Even though she was a dragon, the evil smile on his face sent chills down her spine. She eventually gave up when he called her a coward lizard.

“Fine, let me have it!” She lay on the bed and gave him her hand.

After that, Olivia found it hard to work with Zaleria groaning in pain behind her. At the end, he had given her another seven Seals.
