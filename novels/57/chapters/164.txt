Sofia slowly opened her eyes and looked around, a maid was sitting by her side reading a book. She sat up in the bed, faint light entered through the half-closed window with the chilly breeze. It was almost sunset and she found her stomach growling.

“My lady. how do you feel, did you have a good rest?” The maid asked putting the book aside, a smile broke on her face.

Sofia looked confused for a moment before replying, “Did I pass out?”

“Yes Ma lady, Master said you ran out of MP,” Lexi replied, “He said to let you sleep until you recover.”

“I’m fine now, where is he?” Sofia asked clenching her fist and feeling the Mana flowing inside her body, she was getting used to it to the point it felt like water flowing inside of her.

Lexi stood up and brought a change of clothes for her, “Let’s get you out of that pajama first.”

After changing and having her hair done by Lexi she finally went downstairs to look for Cain. He seemed to be sitting in the living room with Zaleria.

“Cain,” She called him and he smiled back, “We were just talking about you, come here!” Hearing his words she rushed toward him with quickened steps.

“What were those spells you used? I don’t remember teaching you them?” Cain asked and Sofia looked nervous.

“I did just come with them at the spot, I just wanted to make my fire hotter.” Sofia then explained to them in detail how she did it, to Cain’s surprise, the spells were something he never heard of.

He checked her stats and they were nowhere to be found which meant they still don’t exist, they were new. “As expected of someone from my blood, an unrivaled talent!” Zaleria said after she heard the spell’s description.

“How about you try and give them a name? Just think of something.” Cain asked her while keeping an eye on her stats.

Sofia thought hard about it and then said. “Burning body, fire breath, I bet those are suitable!” She said and Cain’s eyes opened wide.

[Burning body] Second-tier magic

[Fire Breath] Third-tier magic

The two spells have been added to her stats, On top of that, they were second and third tier. “You must have talent, your horrific learning speed wasn’t coming from nothing!” Cain gasped remembering how many spells she learned in one day before and comparing her to Gracie who was struggling with one spell.

“Master, dinner is ready, do you wish to eat now?” A maid approached them and asked.

“Yeah, the other are hungry as well so let’s eat.” Cain declared as he stood up, “Let’s finish talking later.” He said looking at Zaleria.

After finishing eating they all headed toward the bath, this time Cain made sure to keep his eyes out. Mary and Zaleria joined this time as well.

“So did you make any progress?” Cain asked Gracie who was helping him take his clothes off, “I’m almost there, do you have any tips?”

Cain thought about it for a moment, spells that absorb the whole body into something were tricky as you need to be away from everything you’re wearing and its shape. “This might seem weird but how about you try naked? Your clothes might be getting in the way, after that you can try again with them on.” Cain replied.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Gracie just nodded, she might have a short time after the bath where she could train in her room.

By that time the girls were already washing inside, Cain quickly followed and left Gracie to change her clothes. Inside the washing room, Alice, Sofia, Selena, Zaleria, and Mary were all lined up. It was a sigh that Cain couldn’t imagine seeing.

“Ah, Cain. Would you mind washing my back?” Zaleria asked him after a while, this wasn’t the first time he did that. In his past life, he was with her all day so helping her with that was something he was used to.

“Why not? Just sit there, also don’t complain since you were the one to ask me.” He said bringing a bar of soap with him.

Cain knew a lot of things about her, in the past, he had discovered that it was hard to clean her skin so he started using magic and rubbed as hard as he could. Now that made sense to him with her being a dragon, she had 29 constitutions, even the dead skin on her body would be hard to get off.

Cain started washing her back as he did in his past life, “AHH!” A gentle moan escaped her, “Wait, how could a human do this?” She was confused at the sudden feeling, she could barely do anything when Gracie washed her back last time but now Cain’s hands felt like dragon claws going down her back.

“I just infused magic into my hands, It helps me bypass some of your draconic stupid durability,” Cain told her and she signaled for him to stop, it was a too strange feeling for her to get from a human.

As she tried to stand up Cain held her by the shoulder and pushed her back down, “Sit, you’re not getting anywhere!”

“No way, stop.” She cried but each time she complained a sharp pain passed through her back and to her lower body.

“I told you to not complain, even though you carry the same stats, your human body is easier to get into as your skin isn’t that thick!” Cain was talking about the difference between her dragon scales and human skin. If she was to just half transform she would be able to resist his magic but he wasn’t going to tell her that.

From the side. Alice, Sofia, and Selena were looking at them with sharp glares. A strange sense of jealousy raged in their hearts. They immediately sat beside her, “Do us next!” Sofia spoke on behalf of them all.

“Fine, just wait a moment!” Cain said and then turned toward Mary who was going to the hot bath. “You don’t want me to wash you back?” Cain meant this as a joke, he was almost certain she didn’t even want to be in the same bath as him after what happened last time.

Mary stopped in her track, she turned toward him with a red face. “I…I guess it wouldn’t hurt.” She silently walked back and sat beside the girls. Cain blinked multiple times and looked at her, he then looked back at Sofia but she wasn’t showing any reaction.

‘I thought she wasn’t reacting to me and Zaleria because she was her grandmother and didn’t see her as a potential rival, but now she is even allowing Mary around me?’ Cain was visibly confused, Sofia would usually at least say something. To his knowledge, she was the one refusing to see more girls around him.

“You’re oddly quiet, I expected you to say something the moment I spoke.” He directly asked Sofia, if it wasn’t healthy for their relationship to stay silent.

“And you dare ask me? For god sake, I already gave up. I’m finally getting used to you having more girls around.” Sofia replied and Zaleria was the first one to start laughing. Mary’s face became even redder.

“You count me as well? Do you think I will lay a hand on my granddaughter’s husband?” Zaleria couldn’t contain her amusement.

“The problem is with him and not you, he is a women magnet!” Sofia complained about an exhausted face.

“It’s true-nya. If we go to my village I bet every girl will wag her tail to him-nya!” Selena exclaimed, wagging her tail violently from left to right.

“Most of the maids here have asked for a contract (Gracie just went with the flow) that would allow him to make moves on them, I bet they are hoping to end in his bed. Even the maids at my father’s house seemed to talk about him a lot, the two who were my attendance have even sent me a letter asking if they could come here. I refused them of course, we don’t need more than we have!” Alice said pushing her hair back, water dripping from her neck downward.

“He was…popular at the guild… The least I can say is that he had a unique look that stood out.” Mary stuttered to speak, “Most of the staff asked about him when he didn’t appear for a day.” She added.

“What are you talking about?” Gracie who came from behind asked.

“About Cain and how much he attracts women, what do you think is the reason?” Alice asked, She was interested in what the emotionless Gracie had to say.

“Attract women?” Gracie seemed to think about it for a moment “Because he doesn’t care about what you are, he just tries to help when he can.”

‘Even when I was a useless mage covered in toad puke…’ Sofia thought.

‘A wild beast oozing with bloodlust in a cage…’ Selena thought.

‘A cursed devil that resembled an eldritch horror…’ Alice thought.

‘Even though I always complained and tried to push the guild’s rule to him…’ Mary thought.

‘A mere human standing in front of my sister…’ Zaleria though.

‘A broken maid who couldn’t even smile back at him…’ Gracie thought.

At that time Cain’s head was burning, he had a lot of things raging in his mind to the point he started sweating. ‘What are they talking about?’ He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

‘Like father, like son.’ Cain thought.
