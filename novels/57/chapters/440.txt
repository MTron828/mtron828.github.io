Cain walked toward the mine’s entrance with a worried mind. He might find something horrid inside, surviving the winter in his past life was hard enough. He couldn’t imagine what being put to work in a mine on top of that would be.

Walking inside the mine’s entrance he could hear the axes still pecking inside. It was still working hours and by the lord’s words, the kids would work as porters outside of that time. The reason is that some of them are children of the mines themselves that they were forced to sell to be able to survive the winter.

He looked around, the entrance was wide, a large wooden door with a steel mesh as a window. Beside the rocky wall was an olive tree that seem to have grown a bit too big. A few buckets of water, crates filled with rock, dirt, and ores were lined up beside it.

To the left is thick foliage of trees and bushes, greenery that screamed spring, winter has passed.

The door suddenly opened when Cain approached, a miner was leaving for a break. “Ha, a knight?” He panicked for a moment. “Did the lord send you with new orders?” He quickly acted calm and looked Cain in the eyes.

“Not exactly, he has been taken by the royal guard to the capital. I came here to inform you that work is on hold for the day.” Cain said.

The man was taken aback, it’s been a month since they got a day off it felt weird to hear it now. “You sure? Just yesterday we received that big order, nine whole crates of Iron.” The man pointed toward the crates lined beside the olive tree.

“Ever told you why?” Cain asked.

“Not our business, we asked. He said we better work and shut up.” The miner waved his hands.

“That’s a bit disrespectful of him, he could have put it nicer. Thanks for your cooperation, could you just inform the other mines that the work is on hold for the day?” Cain said with a smile. It was better to clear them out before inspecting the mines to avoid trouble. “And do please make it quick if possible.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Will do right away, won’t say no to spending the evening on my wife’s lap.” The miner smiled.

“I get that…” Cain giggled.

“Hey, you! Who are you, what brought you here?” The mine guard approached them with an angry face. He has been told to keep all the suspicious individuals away from the mine even by force.

“The king’s messenger, you must have been informed of my arrival. To help him tell the miners that the work is on hold.” [Dominate Person] As if Cain had time or patience to argue, a little spell and it was done.

“Ah, yeah right. Didn’t expect you to come this soon, must have run all the way here. I will get the miners out right away.” The guard saluted Cain as he rushed toward the mine.

For about half an hour, Cain waited under the olive tree for all the miners to get out

Cain stood up when it was done, “Time to search,”

~Spindle, search the whole mine with the squad of devils looking for humanoid children, make sure they won’t spot you~ Spindle was a devil, he could have brought Cain a rat child if he didn’t specify.

~Spindle on it, already smelling them~ Spindle replied with a grunt.

~What is it~ Cain asked.

~Smells of piss and rot, this might be bad you have to come and see~ Spindle replied.

Cain rushed inside toward where Spindle was. [Fly] Even though the mine was cramped, Cain’s flight skills made him able to glide through easily.

“Here, Master Cain.” Spindle called. He was standing in front of an elevator jumping like an excited little monkey.

“Where?” Cain asked.

“This thing has five levels labeled, the smell coming from a sixth level.” Spindle pointed at the wooded elevator.

The thing was old and rooted, made of wood and ropes, and operate manually. Simply put, it was a large wooden body tied with ropes over a hole in the ground.

“Stand away, not riding this shabby-looking thing. Have a long life ahead of me and it’s sad to lose it here.” Cain lifted his hand [Telekinesis] the old wood cracked as Cain squashed the whole thing into a ball.

[Marlin’s Foaling Platform] [Fly] with a single twist of his fingers a deep blue platform appeared foaling above the empty hole. Cain walked over it and Spindle followed.

“Down we go,” Cain said and the platform started descending slowly.

“Master’s magic is amazing, creating something like this on the fly.” Spindle touched the platform with his hand as if inspecting a jewel.

“You must have noticed but I reached my initial goal, all I need is raw stats,” Cain said and Spindle went silent for a moment.

“May I have a word master?” Spindle said, his voice for once sounding deep and serious.

“Go on,” Cain replied.

“What horror have you become? I have never felt such a thing even from the upper ranks. Alas, but once coming from the depth of hell. The Devil lord Asmodeus himself was experimenting at the time.” Spindle stared at Cain.

“Asmodeus himself? Have you seen him?” Cain asked.

“Never, we lower rank devils only hear the term devil lord. Never seen him in person. But we do sense the immense aura he releases from time to time.”

“Well, I became an eldritch horror, a primordial being. This humanoid shape is but a fake appearance now. I bet you I could give even Asmodeus a scare now.” Cain smiled.

“In but a few weeks. Could master reach the leagues of Asmodeus,” Spindle asked with a hint of pride in his voice?

“I definitely will, what about you? Want to become a pit fiend?” Cain asked and Spindle’s eyes lit for a moment.

“We low ranks are bound to remain low ranks.” Spindle replied with a sad voice.

“That’s just as right as there are multiple gods out there. Don’t ever take what the higher being say at face value, always a large pinch of salt is needed.” Cain replied.

“What do you mean?” Spindle stared at him confused.

“It’s full of gorgon shit is what it means, I’m going to turn you into a pit fiend. Want someone capable in hell.” Cain said with a glow in his eyes.

“What about Lady Alice?” Spindle asked. She was a high-rank devil. All Low rank and mid-rank devils will bow to her if she walked into hell.

“Hell isn’t a nice place to be in, want someone with tougher skin… Ah, we reached it.” Cain looked as they reached the low floor.

Almost immediately, the stench blasted his nose to pieces. It was like old socks marinated in rotten eggs with milk and vinegar, for a day or a few weeks. If Cain wasn’t used to working with the undead, he would have puked.

“That old fat is dead, I would burn him on a stick if the first queen doesn’t.” Cain lifted his hand. [Control winds] [Control winds] [Control winds] Cain used his magic to start drawing fresh air all the way from the mine entrance and ejecting the horrid smell.

Cain instantly spread multiple small orbs of light around and saw what he didn’t want to see.

“I take it back, I’m skinning him alive,” Cain growled.
