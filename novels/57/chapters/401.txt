Cain wasn’t that exhausted so he went to see what Sofia was doing, she should be training with Zaleria. He could sense both of them in the castle’s back garden.

As Cain approached he started to hear the spells exploding, magic was probably used to keep the noise down.

As Cain expected, he could see the court mage standing with her staff and a few MP potions to her side. She looked exhausted from the constant work.

“Let me do it instead, you take a rest.” Cain used [Soundless] instead of her. He had two brains so concentrating on the spell was easy.

The court mage looked at him with a shocked face, how could he still move, talk and look perfectly normal while concentrating on a spell with such a wide range?

“They are amazing, aren’t they?” Cain said looking at Sofia and Zaleria’s fight.

Baltos who has come down to watch approached Cain, “I believe you said only Zaleria was a dragon. What is up with your wife trading blows with her?”

“You can say she is her grandmother, Sofia is a half-dragon,” Cain said with a proud face as he stared at Sofia deflecting a massive fireball thrown by Zaleria.

Both of them were in their half-dragon forms and fighting in a firestorm.

‘Did she get beefier since the last time I saw her stats? I guess she has been killing a lot of monsters, not to mention she just blasted the sea floor…’ Cain thought, Zaleria was still a monster.

“AGRAAA!” He then heard Sofia shout as she flew toward Zaleria with a blazing kick.

Zaleria dodged to the side with a swift flap of her wings just to be hit with an Ice spear in the head. A wave of her flames was enough to melt the chunk of ice but Sofia didn’t give her any time as she followed with another kick.

Zaleria blocked with her wrist and returned the kick. BAM! Sofia shielded herself with a firewall but the kick landed directly in her stomach.

For a moment, it seemed that Sofia was about to vomit but instead a massive blast of fire rushed from her mouth and directly hitting Zaleria in the face.

Just as she was covered in flames, Zaleria started unleashing her own breath and pushing Sofia’s firebreath away.

‘She is doing pretty well considering the gap in strength and experience.’

“Sofia! Zaleria, how did the training go?” Cain shouted and both of them stopped.

“Cain!” Sofia smiled as she noticed Cain and flew toward him. CRACK! She landed in front of him standing, her feet left a clear imprint on the ground and caused the guards to shudder as a shockwave shock the trees around them.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Didn’t some noble say they wanted to imprison his wives?” One of the guards whispered to his friends.

“Good luck with that. They are going to need it.” One replied.

“I’m taking my vacation the day I hear that a stupid noble made a move like that. They can deal with that on their own.” Another guard smiled, he could imagine one of the nobles trying it.

…

“How are you Cain, did the clearing go well?” Sofia asked with a smile.

“We had some troubles at the last dungeon but nothing too major, how about you?” Cain asked.

“She’s been doing great, focusing on kicks a bit too much but it’s still passable.” Zaleria landed behind Sofia in the same manner. Those two were really related, or probably Sofia was mimicking Zaleria?

“Well then, the day is almost over so let’s head inside,” Cain said with a smile.

About an hour later, Cain had opened the portal in his room to take them back to Furberg. The reason for that is that he wanted to install the aboleth heart so being in a familiar place was safer.

“Should we get the bath ready?” Gracie asked, she remembered that Cain like to take those.

“Well of course, if we have time then why not?” Cain replied with a smile.

As Cain walked onto the bath, Zaleria followed him with Bela. “We want to talk about the procedure if you will,” Bela asked with a smile.

“I don’t feel safe around you, to be honest. Zaleria, keep me safe!” Cain hid behind the naked Zaleria in the changing room.

“What are you doing?” Gracie appeared behind him, “You didn’t even wait for me.” She said dragging him into the shower room.

Inside the bath, Cain discussed the operation steps with Bela and Zaleria. All the time while Gracie sitting on his lap which made concentrating extremely hard.

The steps were simple yet hard to follow, this operation would be much harder than first one.

First, shrink the heart with Mei’s magic and then seal it so the spell won’t come undone easily. It would be bad if any wandering magic could dispell the shrinking magic with [Dispel Magic]

Second, Remove Cain’s third heart and install the aboleth heart making sure it doesn’t interfere with the lungs and the other organs. It’s simply that Cain’s body isn’t big enough to contain more than three hearts without compromising on health.

Third, Link the arteries leading to the abdomen and brain with the aboleth heart and make Cain’s original heart only feed his normal brain. Each of the hearts needs to on a single main job to optimize efficiency.

Fourth, switch the blood vessels coming from the dragon’s heart so they focus on supplying the rest of the body with blood. Since this heart is the strongest of the three hearts that Cain has.

Fifth, Sew Cain’s body close and dip him into a bath of Liquid Mana (The liquid inside Mana potions) while using a tube to allow him to breathe.

Sixth, lock Cain in a dark room inside the maze and don’t disturb him until he wakes up on his own.

Twice each day, Alice will be the one to enter the room to change the Liquid Mana and clean. No one else besides her is to set a foot into the room. Cain made sure to stress this part, only Alice, no one else.

When Zaleria asked him why her specifically he just answered, “Because she is a devil and can withstand my condensed magic.” But in reality, Cain didn’t want anyone to see what he was becoming. Alice was the only one beside Sylph that he could directly trust because she is enslaved to him.

Right after the bath, Cain went to his room with Selena, Alice, and Katherine as an addition. The operation was decided to be done early the next morning.

As to be expected, Selena wasn’t able to wait and she dragged Cain toward the bed as the other two girls watched.

As if to give her a treat, Cain slowly stripped her from top to bottom. From a kiss to sucking on her bosom. After giving her belly a gentle kiss he went down to her flower, nectar was already overflowing like rivers so he didn’t stall.

Slowly dragging her panties off, Cain gave her feet a gentle kiss as he spread her legs apart.

Cain then gently slid in, it was still a tight fit but that’s probably thanks to Selena’s growing muscle power. One day she might snap him in half by mistake.

Locking their mouths in a kiss, Cain quickly picked up the speed as this was Selena. Going slow or easy on her was not what she wanted or liked. This night Cain wanted to give Selena all the love she wanted because of her stunning achievement.

Some might ask what that was. Beating the boss? No, was thinking about how funny it was that Selena had more strength in her berserker state than Zaleria herself. If she didn’t get what she wanted for that then when?

After a rough few minutes, Cain finally reached his limits and had to empty what he had inside her. Selena’s body twitched slightly, she was almost there. Seeing her like that, he hated to leave her hanging so he pushed over his limit and started moving immediately.

‘This might be harder than clearing dungeons.’ Cain thought.
