Umberlee was the evil sea goddess of this world, most often worshiped by sailors, pirates, or people traveling by sea, out of fear of her destructive powers. She was known as a particularly malicious, petty, greedy, and vain deity who controlled the harshness of the sea while reveling in her own power and was not hesitant to drown people if she was so pleased.

The Bitch Queen's seldomly seen avatar was a giant woman with a body colored like the sea, of blues and greens. Her hands had talons. Her elbows had fins and green hair of seaweed and kelp. Her white eyes were reminiscent of pearls, and her voice sounded like the fiercest sea storm, booming with breaking waves. The goddess appeared in that form to scare and impress the mortals on board of dying ships. The towering avatar wore jewelry made out of seashells, carried a trident, and was dressed in a flowing cape made out of countless pale-purple jellyfish. Umberlee's avatar laughed with malicious glee as she toyed with the doomed vessel.

The most common manifestations of the Bitch Queen were waves and winds of the seas. Sailors knew that when storms hit their ships, and the winds or waves carried sinister cold laughter or hissing words, they were facing the cruel goddess herself.

Another common manifestation of the Great Queen of the Sea was the shape of an aquatic monster of terrible size. She took on many shapes, including monstrous-sized sharks, krakens, and aquatic undead and undead lake-dwelling monsters.

Cain kept thinking about it as they left, with how he is evolving, Umberlee is bound to see him as a threat. Level 60 might not be enough, he needs to farm more.

"What are you thinking about?" Zaleria punched Cain's shoulder giving him a smile.

"Umberlee, we're bound to face her," Cain replied.

"A goddess wouldn't bother herself with us." Zaleria smiled, "And if she did, I will just blast her away."

"It won't be that easy, fighting the goddess of the sea is like trying to fight the ocean itself. Will be in her domain and that is the dangerous thing." Cain was thinking about it seriously. She can control water primarily, wind and lightning secondarily. She will most likely start a thunderstorm and then use the waves to flip their ship, lastly either send her avatar or monster to deal with them.

"You're overthinking it, why would she even attack us? We're just another passer-by." Zaleria looked at him.

"The problem is me, the thing I'm evolving to be supposed to be one ruling the ocean, not her. She will see me as a threat." He added.

Zaleria remembered Cain's chimera, it really looked like a sea-type monster with all the tentacles‚Ä¶but to a degree, she didn't think of it as something from the sea as well‚Ä¶it was a bit strange.

"As you can see, the chimera you fought is still uncompleted. I do miss my lower torso, eyes, ears, and some organs and I'm still as skinny as a stick." He looked up, "I'm going to hell now." Immediately making up his mind.

"Hold up, now?" Alice who was behind stared at him, "Mary has finally found a silver dragon to lead the guild and wants you to meet him‚Ä¶"

Cain waved his head, "Not this time, we're facing a goddess." He said with a serious face. "You lot stay in Avernus and train there, I will delve deeper into hell alone." He made up his mind.

"No, we're going with you." Alice caught him.

"The lower layers are dangerous even for you, I will go alone. Make sure that all of you are at least level 60 before we embark on the journey. Otherwise, we will suffer deaths." He said staring at her with a serious glare.

"Why Avernus, can't you let them go to dis at least?" Zaleria asked, she was the only one trying to understand what Cain was talking about. "Avernus is under Sofia's rule, even if you died there, you can resurrect without getting bound to hell."

"And what about you?" Zaleria glared at him, "Am a monster, hell can't bind what it doesn't understand."

With those words, Cain went back to hell. On his way, he passed by Sofia's fortress to see if Abornazine has got the books he asked about.

"Lord Cain, here are they. Tales of the hell beasts and chronicles of the fallen lord." Abornazine smiled handing two thick books to Cain.

Cain smiled and took him from his hands, [Shadow pocket] he hid them inside and cracked his neck, "Time to work."

"Where is your lordship going? Her majesty Tiamat shall be here soon." Abornazine asked with a worried face.

"I need to go to Dis, please watch over this place for me for a while." Cain smiled.

"Alone? I Abornazine can't allow that. Dis... is a dangerous place‚Ä¶" Abornazine was right and wrong. Yes, Dis is dangerous, but Chad already managed to punch Dispater the Lord of Dis so‚Ä¶

But Cain also understood that his father was special, having divine energy was special Ariel was strong as well and on top of that Kayden was there. Those doing it weren't a surprise.

"I won't be gone for long, two, three days at most. My goal is to reach level 80 before anything. Going from 80 to 100 is what going to take months or years." Cain smiled.

Abornazine banged his cane on the ground, "Can't you wait for a day or two? We can get reinforcement to go with you and‚Ä¶"

"That won't do‚Ä¶I was supposed to delve deep the moment I stepped here. There isn't a reason for me to wait. I bet that if I stayed, other things will pop out to do and I will never get to go down." Cain was feeling that something was off.

"Cain!" Mary rushed toward him from the chambers, "I did get a silver dragon but there is a problem, he is‚Ä¶"

"You can deal with him, I trust you‚Ä¶" Cain disappeared into thin air‚Ä¶She stopped glaring around, he there wasn't a single trace of him‚Ä¶how did‚Ä¶she quickly realized it, that wasn't Cain.

"He has already left, that was but a magical creation of his. "Ninth-tier [Weird] and Eighth-tier [Clone] linked with a [Teleport] spell‚Ä¶" She sighed, ~Father, he has delved deep into hell. Should I follow him?~

~No‚Ä¶told you to let him be, he knows what to do. Now you must protect the other girls if the chromatic were to attack, and don't forget to help your aunt's successor become stronger~ Bahamut said with a healthier voice than before.

~The stronger she gets, the healthier you get. The balance restored it is. But seriously, did you have to send that silver idiot? Just send me a gold one~

Bahamut started laughing‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

Cain stood on the flat, barren land of Dis. He could only see stagnant black rivers of magma and molten iron. He took a deep breath, focusing on his magic and stats, it was time to farm the monsters.
