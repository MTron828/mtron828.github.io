Cain wore his armor and headed toward Selena’s village after the bath, he just wanted to check on them to see how they were doing.

ZON! ZON! He walked out of the gate into Selena’s house to see Elena swiping the dust with a broom.

“Mother Elena, how are you doing?” He greeted her with a smile.

“Ara, you call me mother now? Did the operation mess with your head?” She smiled, she was his mother-in-law after all.

“Have you seen Selena? I’ve been looking for her and the others.” Cain asked.

“She went a few days ago on a hunt. Sofia, Gracie, and the long-eared woman followed her yesterday. I don’t exactly know which direction they went…” Elena said with a sad face but she wasn’t worried, some hunts take days to a week.

“Fine, I could just find them.” Cain laughed as his body disappeared with a beep.

…

“Don’t fight, leave him to me!” Farryn yelled as Selena got smacked across the field with the dragon’s tail.

“Damn! IT!” She leaped ahead and deflected the dragon’s breath with a powerful strike from her hammer. ‘Damn it, damn it! Those things will of course use their own people as bait, they sent another one!’ Farryn though.

It wasn’t just a lone dragon, they sent two. An ancient to act as a bait and a wyrm to be the fighting force. They put acid marks everywhere to bait them, and they succeeded. Their master plan seems to be either sneakily approaching Cain with plan A or dealing some damage with plan B.

Farryn could face the dragon alone but she was hindered by protecting the girls and the village, this dragon was smart as it used them as hostages. Even if she killed it, this red dragon would explode, wiping everyone.

“Get out of my way, take everyone away!” Farryn screamed.

“It’s useless, the barrier it put is keeping us in place. We can’t run!” The dragon has used a special ninth-tier spell to seal the whole place. The whole badger village was encased in the seal.

Jiba was trying to find a way to get the people out while Sofia did her best to erase the dragon’s flames before it could burn the whole place.

Selena was trying to help Farryn fight the dragon but she was failing miserably, her claws couldn’t even scratch its scales.

“It’s no use, go help them find a way out. His scales are harder than steel!” Farryn yelled at the top of her lungs.

Gracie, on the other hand, was keeping a bunch of cultists at bay alone, it seems that the red dragon had some badgers and lions worship him in the village they are the ones who helped the dragons blend in.

‘All of this because we acted without him, we should have retreated the moment we knew a dragon appeared. Cain would have most likely predicted this scenario’ Sofia thought, she couldn’t understand why the dragons were so calm before and now they are everywhere. Unknown to her, Tiamat has been keeping them at bay and now she is gone to heal.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Outside, a maid has been smacking her knife at the barrier. ‘This spell is abnormal, it shunts anyone who isn’t a worshipper of the dragon king out. Even my shadows can’t get in.’

She leaped backward and delivered a hit as hard as she could but the barrier was unscathed. ‘If only Tiamat was here, she could break such a thing with a single tap, why didn’t he teach me single target massive spells.’ Her own regret and her weakness started to hit her again. She has a million arrows but can’t take down a wall.

It was then she felt, that comforting horrid presence approaching, “He’s here!” She immediately ran away into her shadow so they won’t meet. It was bad to get in contact with him now.

“You useless elf, protecting those ants is getting you nowhere.” The dragon roared, ready to start attacking again.

“Shut up! It’s my job to protect him and his comrades, can’t you just let me work in peace?” She growled.

“Then die as you…”

BAM!

The barrier shattered and the dragon’s flames faded, standing in the sky Cain glared at them. Three veins popped into his head.

Everyone stooped moving as they saw him.

Each of his eyes moving separately he finally decided what to do. ZON! He appeared between Gracie and the cultists.

[Blade of Disaster] he conjured a white sword in his hand, Farryn could hold the dragon he had to clear those cultists first.

SMUSH! Suddenly all the cultists got flattened on the ground by [Telekinesis]

‘I was about to cut them down?’ Cain’s first brain thought, ‘But we use [Telekinesis] as it’s more efficient’ His second brain thought. ‘Right, I shouldn’t let rage take over me, let’s use the dragon as a lab rat’ Cain’s first brain thought and his second brain agreed.

“Don’t worry, it’s all over.” Cain smiled looking at Gracie. She fell to the ground panting, it was slowly getting hard to breathe from the dragon’s flames and she hadn’t eaten in two days. This fight was exhausting her.

ZON! Cain appeared in front of the dragon with a smile.

‘Nice, ten whole soul fragments. If I remember correctly it’s 1 for an ancient, 10 for a wyrm, and 100 for a great wyrm. Those souls are fat and juicy after all.’ Cain smiled.

“You’re the white-haired mage, Haha I found you!” The dragon roared opening his mouth to blast a breath.

Farryn tried to rush to save Cain but she found herself stuck in place by an invisible force. ‘Telekinesis?’ she thought

“Let’s take this somewhere else.” Cain flicked his finger and disappeared along the massive dragon.

GRA! The dragon fell on her face in her humanoid form, she was a woman after all. It was hard to tell from their draconic form as their reproductive organs get hidden under thick scales for protection.

Looking around, she was in a deserted land with dark clouds blocking out the sun. This cold feel and dense magic, a demi-plan spell.

“Fine, I will just break it!” She roared, trying to morph back to her draconic body but failed.

Confused, fear started creeping into her mind. What exactly was this place, why did she shift into her humanoid form, and why she couldn’t transform? She tried to use magic but failed as well, it was then that she realized, this demi-plan forbids Mana from moving.

“Fine, Come out you mage!” She screamed, if Cain was a mage she could just beat him to death.

CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!

She heard a strange clicking sound coming from the clouds.

CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!

She turned around to see what it was, her body froze in place.

“Hehe, hehehehe…” She started laughing, what she is seeing can’t be real. What is that thing, is she hallucinating?

A titanic semi-humanoid creature, with tentacles sprouting from his shoulders and in place of his legs. Long hands and a single glowing green left eye. Two wasp-like wings and a golden ring of pure magic behind his back.

“Who are you?” She creamed!

CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! The creature didn’t respond.
