“Listen, we have to talk about something,” Mary said to Sofia.

Sofia slowly turned toward her as she was changing, they needed to get ready before following Cain.

“What is it?”

“It’s about Cain, don’t absorb too much of him MP unless needed,” Mary said with a serious face.

“Really, want to rub more salt? I’m not doing it, in fact, I started understanding the magic the old lady left.” Sofia smiled looking at the paper on the table. They were filled with scribbles that even Cain didn’t care about understanding but she kept reading them.

“Which spell?” Mary grabbed the paper and took a look at them…

“I bet I could fire one only with my MP.” Sofia smiled creating a small flame in her palm.

“Don’t you dare cast this thing? Forget sucking Cain’s magic, you will wipe us all out.” Mary glared at the papers with a pale face.

“You can understand them?” Sofia gave her a strange look. How could Mary, who was but a receptionist understand Magic than even Cain couldn’t?Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Condensing a lot of heat and pressure will cause matter to break down into a massive explosion. The theory was written in some ancient tomes in the guild. Mere speculation but don’t use the magic until we determine its result.” Mary glared at Sofia. She wasn’t going to tell her everything. She could recognize the spell as Tiamat’s signature mass destruction spell, [Hellish Detonation] a ninth-tier spell that rivaled [Meteor Fall]

“Are you sure? Won’t it be useful to use on a dragon?” Sofia was thinking of trying her new magic anyway, the spell might be strong but just how much. It couldn’t be so bad.

“Don’t use it, at least until Cain gives you the green light. Or do you want to cause him more trouble?” Mary glared at Sofia as if she was about to yell.

“Come on-nya, stop it-nya!” Selena jumped in and separated them, “She is right, don’t fight over it.” Alice said in a calm tone.

“We weren’t.” They both said at the same time.

“You were about to start. Cain was right in saying that you two might find it hard to get along.” Alice approached them with a smile.

“From Cain himself. ‘I won’t tolerate inner fighting, if you disagree bring it to me ‘ is what he said word by word. If you want to argue, do it in front of him.”

“Well, of course, I’m not here to cause trouble.” Mary sat on the chair.

Knock! Knock! “Are you ready? Chad already waiting at the gate.” Zaleria called.

“Yeah, coming,” Alice replied.

Sebas had already sent the potions to the king. Chad, Ariel, Zaleria, Farryn, Alice, Sofia, Selena, Mary, and Amaya were on their way to the capital as well. The goal was simple, they all just wanted to stick by Cain’s side except for Chad who was going to help stop the disease.

They all met the king right after going to the capital, he was waiting for them. “Glad you came, I asked the Alchemist guild for potions and prepared some from the army stock. Need help transporting them as quickly as possible.” He looked at Zaleria.

Instead of using the slow Carriage, Zaleria could get them there in a matter of seconds. “Of course, tie the crates with sturdy ropes and set them in the garden. Will take them right up.” Zaleria cracked her shoulder, not that the crates were heavy to her.

“Already prepared them, had to even higher new maids from the training school.” He pointed out to the sweat-drenched maids who worked on filling and cleaning the potions. The alchemist guild sent them in barrels for some reason.

Chad looked at them, “New maids, hired just today?”

“Well yeah, they should still be in training but I called them anyway. They didn’t refuse an early work offer at the castle.” The king smiled as all the new maids bowed.

Chad approached the maids scanning them with his eyes, “New…” He mumbled.

“What? Finally giving in?” Ariel smirked, “Can you transfer some to work for us?” She then turned toward the king.

“Well, if Chad fancied any of them, he just needs to get her approval,” Baltos said.

Chad approached one of the maids and glared at her brown eyes and flowing black hair. She was a bit shorter than him with a sturdy build.

“What are you?” Chad glared at her eyes, their noses almost touching.

She backed down with a shy smile. “But a humble maid from the far south. Wouldn’t mind working for a man approved by the king.” She looked at Chad with a charming smile, her eyes closed to give an innocent look.

SMACK! Chad slapped her so hard that her body flew through the window. Everyone was in shock until they heard Chad’s words.

“Don’t you dare to mimic us humans you monster!”

The maid’s body flew through the air, blood splattering from her face. CRACK! In an instant, she flashed with blue lightning, her body swollen and her true form appeared.

A massive blue reptile creature with a single horn on its head, golden dots scattered across its scales giving them a magnificent glitter. “I guess the information was right, this mission is filled with exciting events!” She growled.

“Ancient Blue?! How did it slip behind me?” Farryn pulled her hammer ready to smash something.

“Yeah, you right there? How did you find me, I was morphed into a human for three years straight till now. I should have felt like a normal human girl with all the tuning I did.” She said stretching her wings.

“I didn’t need to suppress my Charisma with you, any human girl would have fainted out from how much I released on you.” Chad leaped from the window and landed in front of the dragon. “I always check how much people can tolerate around me.”

The dragon lowered her head to look Chad right in the eyes. “And I didn’t feel a thing, in fact, I never expect a human to pack as much charisma as you. Wouldn’t you consider me?” She smiled.

“How many of you are around here? You didn’t come alone did you?” Chad asked.

“Why should I answer, you didn’t my question yet. How do I look to you?” She glared at him.

Thwack! Chad gave her an uppercut as hard as he could. The punch was strong enough to flip her away and crack her jaw.

“Ah! She has done it.” Ariel sighed, “Chad hates women who act like that, just answer his question…”

“Just answer his question?” Alice looked at Ariel.

“She had a better chance by being obedient than like this. He already hated dragons for the problems they have with Cain.” Ariel looked down the window at the dragon standing back up.

The guards rushed in but they immediately retreated upon seeing a dragon. They would just get in the way.

“One at each noble house wanted to secure everything…” She shifted back to her human form. After re-aligning her jaw. “And now, do you see me appealing?” She approached Chad.

“Not a bit,” Chad replied immediately.

“Then let’s settle it the traditional way, by force!” She swung her fist at Chad. BAM! The ground shook and the walls cracked. Her fist carried an astounding amount of strength.

“A respectable 29 strength.” Chad took the punch straight in the face, not even flinching when his nose started bleeding.

CRACK! In the blink of an eye, his fist moved faster than she could see, drilling her head to the ground in a massive shockwave.
