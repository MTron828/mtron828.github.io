'What is this?' a bandit wondered while shaking, 'What is happening?'

He couldn't see her figure, only the corpses of his comrade remained stagnant. The gap was just too great.

Lube the bandit rushed in with great zeal, aiming his blade at the shadow in the hope to score a hit on the beast. "Stop moving!" He screamed. CLING! His blade shattered the moment he swung it, shards flew everywhere piercing his cheek and the other thugs around him.

Almost two feet taller than him, Selena stopped glaring down at the hopeless bandit. She opened her arms, the man lifted his arms to protect his head.

Her paws closed at a devastating speed, BAM! SPLAT!

<HP:32/32> => <HP: 0/32> Lube's head and arms got turned into mush under the force generated by her powerful paws, even the steel of his gauntlet have flattened.

DRIP! DRIP! Blood rained down as Selena stood still.

"Got You!" a bandit yelled from behind her.

Jack leaped with a war cry swinging his blade at Selena's thick neck. He was a little smarter than Lube and tried to sneak her, but he was as little wise as his friend and screamed. In his defense, it wouldn't have mattered anyway.

Thwack! Selena's tail whipped to the side at lightning speed, hitting Jack in the torso. CRACK! His body got immediately split in half like a blade of grass being smacked with a thin twig. It didn't matter how much armor he wore or how strong he was, he couldn't stand a chance.

<HP:45/45> => <HP: 0/45> The shock wave following her tail sent his upper half flying, he crashed into another bandit killing him as well.

<HP:28/28> => <HP: 0/28>

Selena looked around, there are still a lot of men around here. She opened her arms, "Let's end this." She spun her body, taking only one swift, violent turn, which at the end of it she transformed fully into her jaguar form. The wing from her spin snuffed all the torches and the candles leaving the bandits only with a quick, slight glimpse of her Jaguar form‚Ä¶

The bandits started crying and screaming in the dark. Only hearing their own voices mixed with the crunch of bones and cracking of steel. "Where is she?"

"Kill‚Ä¶ Crunch!" ‚Ä¶

AGRAAA! HFFAA! KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! SPLAT!

As silence fell, the door to the interrogation chamber cracked, and long opal white claws sliced through as if it was made of butter.

As Selena entered, the five guards protecting the two women stood in her face. Pointing barrels like those of Jack at her. "Stop! Where are the rest?"

"Monster!" They only saw a massive black jaguar glaring at them.

BANG! One of the fired his shot.

Ding! The bullet deflected from Selena's skin like a pebble hitting a steel plate. But just like that, a small scratch appeared on her fur with a single drop of blood. She slowly turned her head and glared at the small, insignificant wound‚Ä¶what is that thing that managed to wound her skin? She glared back at them.

The shadows before her danced, and Gracie emerged with Hati in tow.

"(This place is a bit cramped, let's expand it a bit)" Skoll spoke opening her arms, CRACK! The stone walls cracked, widening the room to several times its original size.

At the same time, the succubi, Mei, Titania, Alva, and the pixies emerged from the shadows. Zaleria, Alice Farryn and everyone else besides Sofia appeared and surrounded the two women and their guards.

Cain then walked in from a Blue hazy portal with a smile on his face, "Ok, what are you doing to my ride?" He asked pointing his staff at the two women. This entire operation started sensibly when they lacked information and time was of value, now they found Jack tied by two women no higher than level 20, it was overkill.

Cain approached them with a large smile, his steps clearly heard across the room as Jack smiled. Those women never knew what kind of monster supported him. "I see, two pirates. The hag is a traditional one while the girl is a spellsword."

The two women looked around, they were surrounded. Their five guards won't be of much help, this could be their end.

Charlotte sighed, starting to kneel, "We give up, just promise‚Ä¶" [Haste] in the blink of an eye, she zapped toward Cain drawing her scimitar.

The moment she approached him, his visage started blurring, after images of his body dancing as they slid to the side.

'To my right!' She turned around and saw Cain running at her swinging his blade down. CLANG! She blocked it.

-------------------------------------------

Surprisingly, if Cain only used [Haste] and swung with his arm strength alone, he and Charlotte were comparable as they have the same strength‚Ä¶but, Cling! Charlotte twisted her wrist and changed her blade direction, from a block to a swing at Cain's neck. She was a bit more dexterous.

Cain smiled, He can abuse his fast MP regeneration.

[Lesser Empowerment] [Swiftness] [Lightning Grasp]

In a moment, Cain's body moved stronger and faster, deflecting her blade and causing her to feel an electric shock across her body.

She took a step back and immediately swung back at him [Scimitar Arts: Throat strike] [Booming Blade] with a compressed gust of wing around the edge, her sword boomed BABAM! Her mother Agatha rushed in and swung her blade at him as well. [Scimitar Arts: Beheading]

As the two strikes approached Cain, he stood still for a moment, 'It's been a long time since I played like this' he thought.

[Enchanting: Electric discharge] [Blade dance: Dual fang dance] [Twinfang: Dual counter]

Cain dropped his sword, he didn't need that with [Blade dance: Dual fang dance] he needed two short swords for that [Elemental Weapon: Dual Shadow dagger] [Shadow cover] [Shadow creation] [Shadow read] [Shadow mark] [Shadow pocket] [Short invisibility] [Soundless] [Mist step] [Blink]

He is the one who taught Gracie how to fight, even with low-level spells, chaining them like this will be powerful. Cain's body started becoming transparent, shrouded in shadows, he seemed to morph and twist as if he was made of mist. Those around him started to see flashes of darkness, a dreadful silence filled the room and only broke with the sound of him slicing the two scimitars in a single move.

CLANG! The two blades feel to the ground the two women stared at him in disbelief.
