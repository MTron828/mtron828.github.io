“They were wiped out by the forest shy residents, I guess that’s a wrong way to call them,” Morena growled as she sensed her servants die one after the other. Yet for a moment, her skeletal body seems to smile a bit.

‘My spell only detected my sister. That man beside her didn’t seem that strong either. And neither are those little annoyances.’ Morena was optimistic about her strength and ability to win this fight. The only one she saw as a real threat now was Cain, the only person that she didn’t know where his limit lays.

“Arise, my servants, it’s time to rumble!” She cracked her old bones and stood up. Her gigantic, skeletal, draconic body was engulfed in acidic mist and shrunk to a human shape.

Covered in acid, veins and muscles covered her libs, organs build up inside her torso as brown skin covered her body.

Morena looked down upon her body, she caressed every inch gently and frowned. “Still imperfect, no matter how much I try and perfect it, this body will never resemble my own.

“Grwaaa!” Undead growled around her so she stared at them. “I just raised you, you’re that eager for blood?” She smiled. “Sorry, but you have to while, I won’t fight without forcing them into a corner, and I know just the spell for that.”

Morena used one of the bigger undead as a stepping stone and leaped to the cave ceiling and crawled up toward the outside. Standing naked on the snow she stared down at Alseria, “There will be no tomorrow!” It only took her a few other jumps to reach the top of the mountain.

Up there Morena stood with her legs firmly stuck to the ground, her hands pointing to the sky. This time there was no Cain to interfere, and she has learned to only release the spell when it’s fully done.

‘This spell was my specialty yet he erased it like it was nothing. That won’t happen ever again, I even added more effects to spice things up.’, “Ah, Cain Lisworth, would you show what you could do in the face of this?” Morena grinned with an evil smile, her body twisting and writhing like an exited worm.

[Acid Rain: Necrotic Apocalypse] The spell instantly activated, in the blink of an eye, the sky turned black and started to rain green droplets of acid. Each person who died from the acid will turn into a worm-infested zombie under Morena’s control. On top of all of this, as long as the rain was falling on them, the undead created by it will their power increased and their flesh regenerate.

Inside her spell area, Morena receives the same buff and regenerative ability as her undead since she was a dracolich.

“And lastly, you need to go away!” Morena pushed her hand into her throat and took a red Crystal orb from it. It was her phylactery, her major weak point. With a single snap of her fingers, she teleported the phylactery to a secured room deep in the mountain that only she knows about.

That was a necessary measure to ensure her survival. Only the most expert of mages could track it down.

…

Inside Chad’s house, Zaleria was getting ready to interrogate one of the prisoners with Chad when she felt. KABOOM! She immediately flew from the house leaving a gaping hole in the ceiling.

Like a crimson fireball, Zaleria flew to the sky and transformed into her draconic form in a massive fiery explosion. “MORENA!” Zaleria roared in rage as the sky above her started to rain acid.

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Her heart started to race up as she spread her wings as wide as she could to protect the city. She has already felt that the spell would turn people into undead. The flames on her back consumed all the acid without letting a drop escape.

“You’re paying for the ceiling!” Chad yelled as he followed her outside.

“You’re paying for me saving your life!” Zaleria growled back at him, her chest glowing bright red. ROAR! She breathed a blast of fire in the direction of a certain mountain.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Chad screamed as he saw two people in the street get grilled alive from the sheer heat.

“Tch!” Zaleria clicked her tongue as she saw her breath get deflected toward the sky. “I should have used more power!” She was already holding too much, if what she was feeling from Morena was legit, they are in big trouble.

“Hey, I’m talking to you!” Chad leaped to punch her, she simply glared at him. “Take Mei and run, I will hold her back.” In Zaleria’s eyes, this fight wasn’t something that humans should be dragged into.

“What do you mean…” It was then when Chad noticed the rain she was blocking with her wings and felt Morena’s magic in the distance.

“What is that monster?” Chad asked as he prepared for a fight.

“My sister, she seems to have gone down a dark path. Run, this isn’t a fight you could survive!” Zaleria growled shaking her neck and dropping him to the ground.

In the distance, a massive skeletal dragon approached them with an army of the undead.

“Are you ready? Let’s go!” Morena yelled opening her jaw, her breath which used to be pure green acid is now mixed with purplish energy.

Zaleria immediately sensed the condensed necrotic energy on her breath. That breath will spell death even for an adult dragon.

Zaleria didn’t have time to care about protecting the citizen, if she left that breath alone it will kill them all anyway. The best decision was to fight. She might end up stomping some people but that was better the all of the city dying to acid.

“Run! Only your legs can save your lives!” Zaleria roared at the top of her lungs. Cain was nowhere around to protect them [Prismatic dome] or shut Morena’s magic from the start. It was all their bad luck, the people of Furberg were lucky he was there but Alseria’s didn’t.

All the people who heard her started unconsciously running in the other direction, both her charisma and the fact a dragon was telling them to get the hell away caused their legs to start sprinting.

Zaleria rushed directly at Morena’s breath and swung her fire-engulfed claw upward. [Firewall] A two-hundred-foot tall wall of crimson red flames soared from the ground. Morena’s breath splashed at it with a loud boom.

“Blocked it? Did you get stronger?” Morena growled as her little sister blocked such a powerful breath. “I did intend for that to only leave your bones?” She was really impressed, she clearly underestimated her sister.

From the wall of fire, Zaleria rushed ahead with a roar and swung a claw at Morena.

The skeletal dragon deflected the attack easily with her bony wings. The strike was strong enough that the ground shattered underneath Morena’s hind legs.

Morena opened her jaw and breathed again at Zaleria at point blank. “You can shoot another one?” It was clearly a thing that she didn’t expect.

Dodging the breath wasn’t an option so Zaleria engulfed her wing with fire and angled it to deflect the breath. KABOOM! Zaleria’s body was getting pushed even though she was using all her strength and deflecting the breath.

“Sister, come die as I did!” Morena rushed at Zaleria with a bite.

Zaleria dodged to the side and delivered a left claw strike, Morena didn’t even flinch and wacked Zaleria’s back with her bone tail.

Each hit from those two dragons caused the earth to shake, they have already wrecked half of the city. Between the fire and acid rain, it has turned into hell.

As the people were running, they got surprised when Zaleria’s body rolled beside them at a blinding speed and crashed into a nearby mountain. They felt like ants when two lions clash on top of their hill.

“What are you after? What drives you?” Zaleria roared as she breathed at Morena.

Morena replied with her breath, “I was after the purgatory shard but now I don’t care. I only want to take revenge on the people who killed me!” Morena rushed directly and Zaleria and swung her claw.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You, those idiots, and especially that mage Cain! I won’t rest until all of you are dead, and this is my chance to finish you off while he isn’t here!” Morena’s skeletal face seemed to smile.

As all the humans were running for their lives, a single man rode his horse with a gold spear in hand. A golden cape adorned his back.

“Look who’s that?” One of the people running asked as he saw the golden paladin rush toward the raging dragons.

Chad heard the dragon mention his son so he was out for blood.
