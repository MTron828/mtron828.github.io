After a long argument, it was decided that Farryn will inspect the dragon’s remains on her own.

Upon looking at the remains, there wasn’t much left to examine.

“Can you tell anything?” Jiba smiled behind Farryn, he wanted to see what she could learn from a pile of minced dragon meat.

“Well, it’s a male. Here grab this!” She threw a chunk of meat toward him.

“What is this, it smells weird.” Jiba took a sniff and he didn’t like the smell.

“A part of the testicles, that’s how I knew he was a male,” Farryn said as she turned around to keep examining the corpse. Jiba immediately threw the chunk of flesh to the side disgusted.

“For age, I say it’s ancient. See this grey lump here? The nervous note grew around the dragon’s heart when they became ancient. It allows them to survive beheading and still move with massive spinal injuries.” She quickly found out. She was honestly impressed that Selena killed such a thing alone. Tearing the organs out was a smart move, minus forgetting the explosion.

“What do you think?” Sofia asked with a worried face.

“It was most likely sent by the dragon king, I would have preferred to catch him alive…but considering how outdated this country is, that is impossible,” Farryn replied.

“What do you suggest we do?” Gracie asked.

“Only I could face dragons without a problem, Cain should be able to do it as well. I suggest we have him rule over this place for the time being.” Farryn suggested. If Cain was the king, he could issue a reform project to train and get the people a bit more capable of defending themselves.

“This is a free land, that’s isn’t a reasonable solution,” Sofia complained.

“Who cares about reason? Those people will bend their knees to anyone a bit stronger than usual. Cain is a good candidate.” Farryn stated.

“I don’t know who this Cain is but we will only follow her, Selena was her name, right? She can be the alpha male…” Jiba started thinking about what he said, he lacked words. “The alpha female…” sounded strange as it was a novelty that he never heard of happening before.

“Yes, that’s right, it’s a queen. Our queen, that sounds better.” Jiba smiled, “If someone were to guild us, it will be the queen who knows the way.” He pretty much only cared that the ruler is from the beast people, an excellent hunter, and a powerful being.

“Cain is her husband, mine and her too…” Sofia pointed toward Gracie.

“I see, let’s talk about that when she wakes up then,” Jiba said, deep in his heart, he didn’t care who the alpha is as long as it was not him.

…

Back in Furberg, Chad went to check on Dolrig. He haven’t seen him in a while so he wanted to at least say hello.

Walking down the street, he noticed that many people seemed to recognize and greet him. This wasn’t something he was used to.

Now that he thought about it, he has been calm lately. He who has been unable to stay still, always chasing adventures and women from one city to another, has finally calmed down. Maybe the unstoppable desire he had in the past was just a yearning, a wish he never thought of.

Having a family, a child, and living a simple life. Probably all he wanted was to be happy.

“Hey, how long will it take?” The voice of a woman rang from behind him. It was Ariel tagging alone.

Chad slowly turned toward her, he shacked all the women from his hands except this one. Even the barbarian from last time, he simply kicked out without even listening to her.

“Until we reach his shop!” Chad replied with an accurate answer yet with no meaning.

“I see, are you messing with me?” Ariel glared at him.

“Yes, is there a problem?” Chad smiled.

“Yep, you’re making the problem…” She glared at him, and quickly both of them started laughing remembering the old days.

When they first met, Ariel was sealed in a devilish seal by a cult. They wanted to sacrifice her for power. Chad walked into the cult’s main base respectfully asking for directions.

The cult then summoned an army of succubuses, about thirty of them to suck Chad dry to death. Well…they died first.

After it was set and done, Ariel saw Chad about to leave so she asked him to free her in exchange for her angelic prestige body. Chad agreed to free her but refused her body calling her a half-feathered harpy.

Ariel snapped and kicked Chad in the face for calling her that. He then turned and slapped her as hard as he could. They fought for a while before each of them went their separate way.

But when Ariel tried to open a portal to heaven, she noticed that she lack divine energy. Chauntea couldn’t reply to her due to the seal effects so she was stuck in the mortal realm. It was then she realized it, Chad’s magic was divine, and one that could take any shape he wanted.

She then chased Chad wherever he went, begging him to grant her a slither of his divine power so she can return home but he kept refusing. He reasoned that he won’t help a woman who kicked him.

Eventually, after months of chasing him around, Ariel managed to receive some divine energy through her divine link. She was happy until she realized that the power she got was from Chad and not Chauntea.

The divine link was the belief thread that ties a person with their god, It meant one thing. Ariel’s link to Chauntea was cut due to the seal so in the end, she ended up forming a link to chad whom she sought his power.

At that point, Ariel realized that she had become a heretic who worshipped a human for months. Luckily for her, she didn’t fall as Chauntea seemed to be understanding and took her back to heaven.

But to this day, Ariel’s link to Chad still stood strong. Even now that she can only get a limited amount of divine energy from Chauntea, she is getting most of her power from Chad.

The reason Chad could pull her from heaven forcefully, order her around, and the reason that Chauntea even gave her to him. [Gods never give their angels away] was because Ariel was as much an angel to Chad as she was to Chauntea.

Ariel stared at Chad’s back as he walked in front of her. She has been living with him for a while now, and even though they sometimes argued, she always found herself sticking to him. She could depend on him, he could depend on her.

Ariel leaped a few steps ahead to walk beside him with a happy face, she could put return to the heavens, for now, this here was also her heaven.

“YOU FRUCKING BASTARD! WHO TOLD YOUR ARSE TO CHANGE THE HILT!” Ariel heard the loud voice of a man cursing, quickly after a few newbie adventurers rushed outside almost crying.

“Those…death…idiots…” Dolrig walked behind them mumbling curses.

“You seem energetic my friend.” Chad smiled calling Dolrig.

“Ah! Isn’t it Chad…and the madam as well? Please do get in and I will have tear ready on the forge!” Dolrig smiled, he hasn’t seen them in a while.
