Cain opened the door to his room, He saw Sofia sitting at the desk while Gracie is tending to her hair. “Did wait for too long?”

“No, we just arrived as well,” Sofia replied.

“We need to start, I’m hungry.” Gracie glared at Cain.

“Hold up for a second, there is something I wanted to do,” Cain said looking at Alice.

“What is it?” Sofia asked with a worried face, what she did this day crossed her mind so she started expecting a heavy punishment.

“The buff, the enchantment I’ve implanted in your nails. They are useless right now so I want to remove them and install new ones.” Cain started explaining.

“How many do you have now, Seven? You could hold up to twenty so will be installing them all today.”

“That reminds me, why didn’t you give me all the buffs before?” Sofia asked.

“After we trained in the forest, you grew exponentially in a short period. Which called the need for stronger enchantments, and as you know, strong buffs are painful. With how hectic the time was, I just didn’t want to put you through what is essentially torture.” Cain explained.

“So if I understand it right, now is the time to torture me?” She looked at him with a weird face.

“Yep, I was thinking of a punishment for you about what happened today but I don’t like unproductive things like simple spankings or kicking you out of the bed for some days. Instead, those enchantments can directly help reduce your MP consumption while giving more MP, higher damage, and better control.” Cain told her with a big smile on his face.

“So since she hasn’t fixed her habit, she now has to fix it with pain,” Gracie said staring at Cain, Sofia’s medicine was more than just bitter.

“Do you really think I can take it?” Sofia asked him with a scared face.

“I will stop when you pass out, it’s just pain after all. The buffs aren’t doing any real damage to your health after all.” Cain replied.

“What about my mental health!” Sofia cried, rightfully so as she remember how much lower enchantments hurt.

“You will be fine, half-dragons are tough. In the worst case, you will have a bad mood after.” On top of that, Cain didn’t tell her that dragons can’t get mentally scarred since their brain lacks the necessary structure for that. That’s why they fight after their head is severed and won’t have mental trauma afterward. Simply put, their mind is as tough as their bodies.

“Stop whining around, I’m hungry!” Gracie told Sofia.

“Let’s start then, first let’s go into the magnificent mansion.” Cain opened a portal, He didn’t want Sofia’s screams to be heard across the castle. He is expecting her to give up after ten enchantments, that’s how much he thinks she will endure.

They entered through the door and the ghosts greeted them, “Welcome, hooome!”

“I’m going to use the full mansion so get all the ghost maids ready and dismiss the rest,” Cain told the ghost.

“Order delivered. Ladies follow me…” The ghost woman guided Sofia and Gracie to the bedroom while Cain started tinkering with the mansion spell to add some effects.

As Gracie and Sofia waited only a bit, Cain entered the bedroom with a large glass cup in his hand. “Please fill it to the brim.” He handed the cup to Gracie to fill with her spit.

“Why all of that?” Sofia asked with a worried face.

“People feel less pain while being horny, you’re going to drink it before we start,” Cain replied with a smile.

“You must be kidding!” Sofia gasped, it was disgusting to think she is going to drink that much of Gracie’s spit.

“I’m not going to force you or anything, I will even give it a nice flavor with magic. The cup will be waiting, drink it if you felt that the pain was too much and you didn’t want to give up yet.” Cain replied. He didn’t tell her that he increased the Mana density in the mansion from the maze to prevent her from passing out.

“Fine, as long as I’m not going to need it,” Sofia replied.

“Well then, let’s start with your mouths.” Cain took his clothes off and approached them. Both Gracie and Sofia stripped and went on their knees. A stroke in Sofia’s mouth and the next in Gracie’s, Cain’s goal was simple. To even a little bit of Gracie’s aphrodisiac into Sofia’s system, it was a bad idea for her to go in directly.

At the end of that, Sofia was disappointed that Cain gave the load to Gracie instead of her. In his mind, he gave it to Gracie since she actually needed it for nourishment, unlike Sofia.

Cain gently grabbed Sofia by her shoulder and laid her on the bed, quickly putting two fingers inside of her to see if she was already wet enough, and as he expected, she was ready.

Cain went inside immediately and grabbed her hands, while moving, he removed the old enchantments from her hands and then grabbed her feet, also removing the enchantments in a single weave from his fingers.

The first Buff he wanted to give her is [Reduced Elemental Cast Cost: Fire] A very powerful buff that reduced the casting cost of fire spells but didn’t affect the other elements.

Now Cain was facing a hurdle, would it be better to warn her, or is it better for him to just do it without warning? After all, she would be in pain for just two or three seconds. In the end, he decided to do one as a surprise since she never warn him before sucking his MP.

Cain grabbed her feet and started thrusting faster, then suddenly she felt as if a hammer crushed her right big toe. Sofia howled in pain as she tried to pull away from Cain but she couldn’t.

With tearing eyes, she looked at her foot to see a faint red glimmer around her toe. This was the first enchantment.

“How do you feel?” Cain asked seeing her legs shake.

“The…the pain already faded away. It was like a sharp passing hit, couldn’t you have warned me?” She glared at him.

“I pondered about it for a moment but then decided not to tell you,” Cain replied as he kissed her.

“Fine, do as you wish. I just prefer to have a warning beforehand.” Sofia pouted. She didn’t even bother asking what buff it was as she trusted Cain’s decision.

Cain quickly flipped her around and started thrusting again, his goal was to get her to a point where he cast the second buff without her stressing too much.

“AGRA!” Sofia cried as Cain suddenly cast the second buff.

[Fire Manipulation] Allow the manipulation of flames to form different shapes and colors.

“How are you feeling?” Cain asked as he saw her panting a bit too much.

“Don’t mind me, just keep going I’m getting used to it,” Sofia replied with an almost crying face.

“Should I put the third one right here and now?” Cain looked at her.

“Do it!” Sofia replied, in her mind, the faster she went through them the quicker she can rest. About three seconds each, with twenty it’s just one minute of pain, it can’t be that bad.

[Stored Spell: Fireball] Sofia’s body twisted as she felt the third hit. She was wrong, it wasn’t getting any easier.

Seeing that she was hurt a bit, Cain stopped to let her rest a bit. But she instead kept him locked in with her legs.

“Please don’t stop, at least until we reach five,” Sofia said.

“Are you sure?” Cain glared at her, he feared she might actually hurt herself.

“Yes, in fact. Do two at the same time. Then one might seem less painful.” Sofia tried to put on a smile.

“Fine, just don’t puke at me,” Cain replied as he counted from three to one and then created two buffs at the safe. Sofia’s body jolted, her eyes turned red, and her body emitted a large heat wave.

[Elemental Absorption: Fire] This buff worked a bit differently depending on the target’s specific elemental resistance level. If the target had no resistance, the buff will be a [Resistance], if the target already had resistance it will become [Immunity], and now in Sofia’s case, she has immunity so it’s an [Absorption].

[Mana Regeneration] +30MP per minute. Cain has tried to crank this as high as he can just so she won’t be sucking more of his MP.

It was better to give her some time to rest and then tend to Gracie, it wasn’t good of him to be unfair.
