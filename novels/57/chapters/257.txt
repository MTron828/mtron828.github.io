Shan the earth dragon Roared as he cast a spell, [Spike growth]. Multiple human-sized stone spikes extended from his flesh in an attempt to pierce Selena and Hati who were running in their beast form on his shoulder.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jumping from left to right, Selena used her sharp senses to detect and dodge the spikes. Her aim was the earth dragon eye.

Hati rushed directly through the spikes, using her nine tails to smash them into pieces.

“That fool’s daughter, have you come so I send you to him?” Shan Roared as he recognized Hati.

Selena increased her speed and extended her claws further, they helped her grip on the dragon’s shaking shoulder. Taking the chance of the dragon being distracted by Hati, Selena leaped at his head.

“GAW!” She growled swinging her claw at his remaining eye.

CLANG! A second membrane protected the dragon’s eye just before she could hit it. The pupil quickly turned and focused on her, the iris shrunk as the dragon stared at her.

“Fool!”

Multiple spikes launched at her from around the eye, Selena jumped back she was late, and the spikes were about to hit her.

Thud! Chad jumped in and pulled her by the tail, twisting his body mid-air, he sliced all the spikes easily.

Selena wasn’t done, she used Chad as a platform and leaped back at the eye. This time she grabbed the membrane with her front paws and started kicking the dragon’s face with her hind legs.

The dragon growled in pain as she was slowly pulling the membrane off. More spikes rushed at her, more than what Chad could protect her from with his strength.

Crack! Kayden leaped in and swing his four swords at the same time. Twelve of the spikes were sliced in half as he laughed.

The earth dragon loathed the fact that his massive body prevented him from reaching his face with his claws. He needed to use them to support his weight.

Pierce, the earth dragon felt something pierce his neck. With his Blindsight since he saw someone he thought wasn’t there. A maid was pushing a shadow spear into his neck with a passive face. When he tried to pierce her with his spikes, she disappeared as if she was never there.

That small fraction of a second was enough for Selena to tear the membrane out and push her whole arm into the dragon’s iris.

To her surprise it felt like sand, his iris was dry and tough. No like his skin bit more than normal.

Hati quickly rushed toward the growling dragon ear and pushed one of her tails inside. As long as it was softer than his skin, it was okay to attack.

Shan has gotten enough, a fire dragon brawling with him. Multiple pests swarming his face and an insolent mage that was pouring water on his back for some reason. [Mountain Rumble] The massive dragon suddenly jumped, when he landed back. Two of the mountains around them started rapidly moving toward him.

Zaleria immediately recognized it as the dragon’s ninth-tier spell. He wanted to crush them between the two mountains. He would survive it since he is the caster and an earth dragon but they would not.

“A spell that takes time always requires concentration, we can stop the mountain if we hurt him enough,” Chad yelled as she swung his blade at the dragon’s face.

“Cain do him as you did me!” Zaleria roared.

Cain who just finished laying the seventh pillar looked at her and remembered what she was talking about. The nail enchantments were painful enough to make her cry so they should work.

Cain sucked more MP from Alice and teleported directly toward the dragon’s hind legs and grabbed two of his claws.

[Enchanting: Hell resistance] an enchantment that allowed the creature to breathe in hell. It was useless to the dragon now yet it produced a lot of pain to set.

[Enchanting: Universal tongue] This enchantment allowed the dragon to understand all spoken languages that the caster knew. Cain knew a lot so the enchantment produced a lot of pain to set.

As if a nail was driven directly into his bones, the pain surged from his claws, up his spine, and to his teeth and head. His body twitched as he was forced to bend his knees in pain.

As if to add salt to injury, Hati’s tail pierced his eardrum at the same time causing him to lose focus and lose control over the ninth-tier spell.

At that time Cain had started setting the eight pillars.

Alen signaled to everyone to back away as he had soaked the whole dragon in water. “I got this toad wet as it should be!” Alen yelled and everyone jumped away from Shan.

Zaleria punched the earth dragon in the face before backing down and opening her jaw. The earth dragon tried to rush her she went in for a second punch.

Quickly she started sucking the heat and causing the mud underneath the dragon started to freeze locking him in place. Such a thing will only hold him for a couple of seconds but that was enough. Cain just finished the ninth pillar.

Cain immediately teleported to the sky and clenched his fists. A ray of light linked the nine pillars as the spell started. Golden chains rushed toward the earth dragon and tied him to the ground with a magical binding. The dragon struggled and bit the chain but he could not break them. He tried to breathe at Cain but the breath never came. He was feeling too weak to do anything, those chains were sucking any bit of power he had.

“For the last touch, let’s bury you alive,” Cain said with an evil smile. The pillars sunk into the ground and pulled the growling dragon with them.

“Remember this abomination, when I come out I will…” He was completely sucked into the ground.

“See you in a hundred years, frog dragon.” Cain flew toward Zaleria and landed in front of her. Alice and Gracie jumped from his shadow like it was nothing.

Zaleria’s body quickly morphed back to her human form, She had a blackened eye and a twisted nose. Multiple bruises on her skin made Alice panic to heal her.

“You look as if you just got into a fist fight,” Cain commented and Zaleria laughed it off.

“Well, I kind of did. That dragon was no joke. Are you sure he is stuck for good?” She asked with a worried face.

“The stronger he is the more effective the spell will be, we won’t see him anytime soon.” Cain patted her shoulder.

Cain remembered that he still needed to talk with Amaterasu, “Alice, is Amaterasu still there?” He asked.

Alice shook her head, “She said that her time was about to end and left, we probably won’t hear from her soon.” She said with a sorry face.

Cain scratched his head, “let’s head back to the village, I will explain everything there.”

He was too exhausted and wanted to lay down. His Abomination body helped but not that much. When Cain looked around, his father was laying on the ground.

“Are you okay?”

“Just exhausted and wanted to lay a bit,” Chad answered.

Hearing that, Cain smiled as he and his father thought the same.

The reason Chad was laying on the ground was not just exhaustion. Overusing his foresight had caused him to feel nauseous so he was trying to rest a bit.

Cain opened and downed an MP potion that Gracie handed to him and used [Lisworth’s magnificent Mansion] For everyone to get in.

Inside, Lyla who was waiting for them rushed at Kayden. She didn’t even realize he had an extra two arms.

Cain carried his sick father inside as Chad didn’t want to move.

[Arcane Gate] Cain opened a door to the maze inside so Rieth and Sofia could get into the mansion. Reith carried the unconscious Sofia and lay her on one of the beds.

The fight was finally over.
