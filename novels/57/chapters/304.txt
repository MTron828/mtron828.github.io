Smack! Zaleria flew in and kicked the crimson cobra on the head. A flash of red fire bloomed as the monster’s head got blown into multiple small pieces.

“I was about to kill that.” Chad walked to her. “You can’t just take other’s hunt like this.”

“Chad? No wonder I felt Cain’s magic around here. What are you doing here?” Zaleria asked as she burned the blood on her feet. For some reason, the pulsating of her magic seemed sharper.

“Hunting for meat. What brought you here?” Chad asked as he took careful steps toward her. The last time they met he ended up being knocked out cold.

“Same as you, I was hunting for food before I get back home.” Even though Zaleria looked like a human, she was still a dragon and the about of food humans consume can’t keep her alive.

Zaleria’s body twisted and turned around as she turned into her massive draconic form. Edward grabbed the mage and ran away. He knew Zaleria wasn’t intending to kill them but having such a massive being stomping around was scary.

SLURP! Zaleria slurped the Crimson Cobra like a noodle. “Taste bad!” She cleaned her tongue on a tree before turning back to her humanoid form.

“Can I eat the second one as well?” Zaleria asked with a drooling face.

“It’s their hunt, let them have it!” Chad replied as he looked at Edward and the rest of his party. They were shaking. Unlike Chad who was known to be strong, Zaleria was seen as a disaster-level being. Blocking a meteor and surviving meant she was just as dangerous as one. Also seeing her slurp the massive crimson cobra was enough to establish her standing.

“She can have it if she wants, we don’t mind!” Edward replied with a shaking voice. If a monster like her was hungry, it was better to feed her monster before she start eating humans.

“Forget it, I can find other things to eat.” Zaleria waved her hand as she looked in the direction of Cain. She was excited to tell him what she found.

“Want to see Cain?” Chad asked with a smile.

“Well, of course, it’s strange in the first place for a dragon to be this far from its rider,” Zaleria said nonchalantly, she didn’t realize what kind of bombshell she dropped on them.

Chad might have found it easier to digest but to Edward, it was a clear shock. Dragons were prideful creatures and they rarely allowed someone on their back, if they didn’t kill them right away. The entire city was speculating about the relationship between Cain and Zaleria.

Dragon riders were as strange and rare as lion riders. That meant that Cain who tamed such a monster was on a whole another level.

“Let’s head back then,” Chad said with a smile. He still did want to hunt more but he decided against it.

Chad and Zaleria immediately started running toward Cain leaving the shocked Edward with his party staring dumbfounded.

“Hurry, cut the cobra’s eyes, fangs, and poison gland. We need to get back and tell everyone about this!” Edward yelled. A lot of people were wishing to get closer to Zaleria after seeing her strength. They needed to know that she belonged to Cain so they won’t get themselves killed.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

…

“What were you doing?” Chad asked.

“I did find my hut, for now, I wanted to tell Cain about that,” Zaleria replied.

“Found it?” Chad seemed to not understand, how a dragon could forget the location of their home.

“It keeps moving, I just managed to track it down,” Zaleria replied as she saw Cain in the distance.

Thud! When stopped. They found Cain sleeping on Selena’s back

Selena glared at them as they approached, “You returned quickly, we thought it was going to take you several days-nya.”

“I’m pretty quick, can you wake Cain up for me?” Zaleria asked as she poked Cain.

“I thought he would have already woken up, it’s been several minutes now,” Chad said with a disappointed face.

“What happened?” Zaleria asked.

After a few minutes of explaining what happened, Zaleria nodded and pulled two red potions from her pocket. “A simple healing potion, it should help him recover quickly.”

After making both Cain and Kayden drink, the three waited for a while before Cain slowly opened his eyes.

“My head is hurting. You really knocked me out.” Cain stared back at his father.

Chad snorted, “You’re the one who is squishy, and I didn’t even put half my strength into the strike!” Chad declared. It was true that he only used about 14 strengths to strike Cain. And he used 24 strength to strike Kayden.

“I’m a mage so I’m supposed to be a bit squishy. I didn’t expect to be hit by you.” Cain argued.

Chad stared at Zaleria and Selena, he then looked up to the sky and started thinking. It was true that Cain is making it extremely difficult to attack him while he is focused on you. But he ends up weak when taken by surprise.

“That won’t do, you need to at least be able to withstand a 20-strength attack. Otherwise, you won’t survive the dangerous encounters you might face.” Chad said as he looked at Cain.

Cain stayed silent, he knew his father was right. That was one of the reasons he went with the abomination evolution since he could improve his physical capabilities by modifying his body.

“I’m with him as well, it would be better if you could hold your own without magic.” Zaleria stared at Cain with a sharp glare. Cain wanted to ask her about what happened in her hut but he thought this wasn’t the time.

For a moment, Selena’s mind seemed to wander to a faraway land and then returned. “It will be better if you were stronger-nya!” Her eyes were sparkling which scared Cain.

“Fine,” Cain gave up quickly. There was no way he was going to convince them otherwise while both Chad and Zaleria were insisting.

“But it’s too late for today, we need to get the gorgons back home quickly!” Cain stood up and stretched his arms.

[Telekinesis] quickly moving the gorgons into the maze alongside the still unconscious Kayden.

[Arcane Gate] Cain walked toward the gate, “My upper back is hurting, let’s return home.”

Cain wasn’t worried that his spine might have been damaged since he was an abomination. He could always heal with enough time and healing magic. His goal now was Alice as she could help him ease the pain.

He should probably train a bit tomorrow morning with his father. Cain did know both [Blade Dance] and [Twin fangs] he should probably spec more in [Twin fangs] and incorporate it in his fighting style.

A dual dagger spell caster. Probably add in some summons for back up and he will be set.

After thinking about it for a while, if his father was the one to teach him. He would probably teach him [Blade Master] or [String Master]

“Cain!” Alice rushed toward him as she saw him walk out of the arcane gate. She didn’t feel that he was in danger before but now that she saw him. She immediately realized he was injured.

“I-I’m fine, just need to rest a bit!” Cain fell on the couch and exhaled.
