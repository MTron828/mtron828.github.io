Cain opened his eyes in the middle of darkness. To his side, a girl lay unconscious. He recognized the girl as Amaya Bennett, one of the girls that work for him.

‘What is she doing here? What is this place anyway.’ Cain only took one second to realize this was a sort of dream. The inner realm of his mad soul.

“If she is here then it means that I absorbed her soul, she is dead outside,” Cain said as he brushed her hair. She slowly opened her eyes.

“Master Cain.” She looked at him with a hopeful face but that soon turned into a pale frown. She realized on her own that she was no longer alive.

“Did you die as well?” Amaya said with a sad face.

“This is the inside of my soul. I’m still alive and would probably be fine. Sadly I can’t say the same for you…” Cain stared at the ground with a guilty face. He wasn’t the kind of person to just take it. His mind was busy thinking of a way to revive her if possible.

The more Cain focused on his thoughts, the more the world crumbled around them.

Feeling the shaking, Amaya looked up. A gigantic crystal-like object was cracking. She immediately tried to shake Cain and get him to look up but he did not respond.

“Master, we have to run. That this is about to fall on us!” She tried to pull him away but he didn’t budge. When Amaya looked down, Cain’s legs were slowly drowning in the ground as if he was on quicksand.

Soon enough black chains constrained his body as his eyes gazed into the void.

“Move! Move!” Amaya used all her strength to pull Cain while screaming. Even if she was a mere soul, her hands started bleeding of how much strength she was using.

CRACK! The crystal shattered and started falling on them. “Master!” Amaya screamed.

Thud! Thud! Thud! A shadowy figure ran in and sliced the chains restraining Cain. That shadow carried both of them and jumped to a safe spot. As Amaya watched the Crystal crash.

When Amaya looked closer at the shadow, she could see Ourals mark on his armor. “Who are you?” she asked.

The shadow glared at her and rumpled in a slow voice. “I don’t remember, all I know is that I will perish if that man died. It’s the same with us all.” As the shadow fell silent, Hundreds of shadows emerged from the ground holding their weapons high.

They were the souls of the Ourals army that Cain absorbed. Cain locked them there to be his food when his MP run dry. He was keeping them as a last resort to save his life, a trump card that is not Sylph.

“Do you know of an exit?” Amaya asked with a shaking voice, she held Cain tightly in her arms.

The shadow looked at her with an intrigued face. He slowly lifted his disintegrating hand. “You can touch the master safely, you’re different than us.”

“What do you mean?” Amaya shouted by the shadow didn’t reply as his entire body disintegrated into ash and got absorbed by Cain.

“We will get eaten if we touched the master, but you aren’t. We can lead you to the center of this place but we know of no exit.” A woman in full-plate armor approached them.

“Can we exit from there?” Amaya asked.

“We don’t know, but that place is where the master usually is sitting.”

The shadows started running, and Amaya was forced to carry Cain on her back and run after them. As they were rushing ahead, something terrifying happened.

The form of a giant devil and a titanic wolf appeared in the sky, they both reached down to grab the crystal-like object that was pulsating like a heart.

“Who are those?” Amaya screamed as she looked up. “That devil usually appears to eat the master’s energy, that wolf is new to us. If they caught you then you will die!” The woman in full-plate armor yelled.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The two gigantic monsters grabbed the crystal object and started lifting it up to the sky, Amaya gasped as she felt a sharp pain in her chest. Cain’s body was starting to sting her back.

“It’s there, that black throne. Just put him on it!” The shadow woman screamed as the army of shadows behind her drew their weapons toward the two monsters in the sky. They waited but no attack came.

The two monsters seemed to focus only on the crystal object. The moment Amaya threw Cain on the throne. The pain in her chest only increased.

Cain was slowly absorbing the darkness of the world. BAM! Two black veins burst from his body.

One tied Amaya and the other tied The giant wolf.

The giant wolf immediately snapped the vein with a bite as the devil released the crystal. That wolf disappeared alongside the crystal and soon did the devil.

“Master, stop!” Amaya cried in pain as the vein slowly crushed her body. She could feel it sucking something from her inside, is Cain’s soul trying to eat her.

After about a minute, Cain opened his eyes to see Amaya withering, her face already paled as necrotic energy flooded from her.

“Shit, did you touch my soul?” Cain immediately slammed his hands together. She was already done for, resurrecting her was impossible now. But the only thing he can do for her. Was something that she might hate him for it.

“Sorry but this is all I can do, I can dispel it later if you wanted.” [Create Undead] [Enchanting: Physical power] [Enchanting: Magical power]= [Create Higher Undead]

Everything went black in Amaya’s eyes from then.

After a while, Amaya opened her eyes to see Cain sleeping on the bed with a towel hiding his eyes. A devil was sitting by his side with Sofia, Gracie, and the new girl. The devil was wearing Alice’s clothes and his body was soaked in sweat.

In a split second, Gracie pulled her dagger and stabbed Amaya in the chest. “Undead?” Gracie mumbled as she looked down at Amaya. She acted on instinct the moment she felt necrotic magic but now she pulled her dagger out.

Amaya did not feel any pain. She only realized that Gracie stabbed her when she saw her pull the dagger out.

The devil slowly shifted his eyes at her.

“You can’t kill her, she is linked with Cain. I did feel the magic leave his body.”

They all stared at the confused Amaya. Her face now was pale white with blue veins across her whole body. The necrotic magic oozing from her was almost unbearable.

“This feeling, is she an undead?” Sofia said as she felt a similar vibe from her to that lich.

At that moment, Cain slowly rose up and took the towel from his face. He scratched his eyes and looked around, Everyone was looking at him as if waiting for an explanation.

He was just as confused as them, He knew that his body has stabilized now. Moreover, that she shard was no longer inside him. Those things are tied by race so only true Fenrir people can host the shard without their bodies rejecting it.

He also knew that he turned Amaya into an Undead to prevent her soul from getting devoured.

Cain looked at Amaya. And scratched his eyes again, “So you became a level 1 Zombie,” Cain sighed. He could do nothing about that since she was low-level, to begin with.
