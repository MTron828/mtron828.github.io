As his vision started to blur again Cain wiggled from left to right, Alice quickly caught him. “Gracie…Bring me a cup of normal tea, some water as well.” He said checking the wound on his thigh. ‘It’s more effective when delivered directly to the bloodstream.” Cain noted in his mind.

Gracie quickly left the room as Cain tried to rest his head on the pillow. “How do you feel?” Alice asked him with a worried face. “You did fall really hard, if you are feeling any pain please tell me so I can try healing it.”

“Sorry, it’s not the fall.” Looking at her naked body, Cain’s mind screamed one thing. Alice was able to see it burning in his eyes so she embraced him tightly.

Alice did invite him in warmly yet he refrained, going with will only increase the aphrodisiac’s effect. Cain could feel his heart beating inside his chest, his legs felt weak and his hands were trembling like an old man. Breathing was getting harder for him and his body started sweating heavily.

Alice gently tingled his body with her tail, gazing at his face. Cain quickly sat up to take a deep breath, “Please wait a moment, I need to drink something first. It’s Gracie’s aphrodisiac, it’s taking a hold of me.”

Alice didn’t push on him any further as he looked quite serious. “Is it that effective? Don’t you have any magic to nullify it?” Alice asked with a curious face, Cain quickly realized that he had been counting too much on her [Holy Healing] She as a healer could do more and he hadn’t checked her stats in a while.

Her holy healing is as strong as second tier magic and cost less MP to use so he didn’t fell like teaching her first and second tier healing magic were necessary as they will be useless. But what had slipped his mind was the need to teach her detoxification magic, it was a second-tier so Cain though it will be a while before she levels up, but look at that, she is level 3.

“Say, want to learn detoxification magic?” Cain asked, putting his fingers together as if he was about to strike a deal. “It will help us a lot to deal with poisons and the like.” He smiled trying to sound formal. His action was just a way for him to try and resist the urge released by the aphrodisiac, it will be weird to ask while humping her back after all.

“Why now of all times? I will we could PLAY, a bit instead. Leave the study for the day.” Alice replied as she lay her head on his lap, that move was enough to make him clench his fist on the blanket. Her hair tickling his lower side was just unbearable.

“That spell will help me get over this aphrodisiac faster, that would mean we could got at it for longer.” His meat had started to hurt. Probably going to sleep right after getting the aphrodisiac was a bad idea as Cain was feeling worse than he expected.

“Fine, as long as it won’t take the whole night and isn’t that complicated.” Alice finally agreed as his beating meat was poking her head.

Cain started slowly teaching her the ins and outs, the spell wasn’t that hard nor that long. Alice felt it was similer to her holy healing in nature but a bit more light. It wasn’t made to fix but to destroy, a spell that damages any substance foreign to the body it cast on. That includes poisons, drugs, for a reason unknown to Alice it included diseases and allergies, and even extremely small insects.

OF course the magic had it’s limitation as it couldn’t cure all cases, magical poisons and diseases were out of the question, effects inflicted by the body owner were also excluded. ‘So I can’t heal someone who poisoned himself?’

And without taking longer, Alice’s finished learning the spell from Cain just as Gracie entered the room. Unlike Sofia who quickly lost her temper, Alice called Gracie to the bed without any problem. “Come here help make him drink those, I will try a spell on.”

Hearing Alice words, Gracie hurried toward Cain with the tray and slowly helped him drink. The cold water going down his throat felt refreshing with how hot his body was getting, the tea as well helped him calm down and regain his composure.

They then quickly laid him flat on his back and Alice got ready to cast her spell, His head was resting on Gracie’s lap staring up at her face. Her chest was getting in the way but Cain appreciated the obstruction.

Alice slowly put her hand on his chest and started focusing, at the same time Gracie combed his hair with her fingers as she watched the golden glow emerge from Alice’s hand.

It only took a moments before Alice stopped, her face turned pale as she stared at Cain’s face. Her hands were shaking uncontrollably and her lips opened and closed like a fish disparate for air.

“My curse…it’s inside you?” She asked fearful for his answer, Cain immediately knew what she was referring to. The dead tissue inside his body still held a fraction of her curse, she must be feeling that.

“It’s complicated.” Cain replied as he tried to think of a bluff.

“I can feel it clearly, my curse is resting perfectly on the wounds inside your body. That could only mean it was me who cursed you that day.” For some reason Alice seemed to calm down a bit after her initial reaction. Cain thought of her stat for a moment and concluded that her 18 wisdom and being a devil played a big role in helping her control her emotions.

“You did save Sofia’s life that day by doing that, I didn’t tell you so you will do it again if the need arises. I have better chances to survive a deadly curse than to risk your lives.” Alice understood his as putting their lives before himself, at that time he concluded that Sofia’s life was more precious than his.

Alice took a deep breath, closing her eyes and lifting her head up. “You know, you could have just told me. If I acted crazy there is the binding to calm me down.” She said with a slow voice.

“I don’t like using the slave binding to enforce or suppress emotions, it can cause people to go crazy sometimes.” Cain said, reaching with his hand to her back.

Alice slowly lifted her hand up and dropped it on Cain’s stomach, He immediately jolted back up. Her punch wasn’t strong but his stomach was relaxed so it knocked the air out of him.

“Sorry, I just had to vent up some feeling. I felt like I was going to start crying if I didn’t do that.” Alice as she hugged Cain’s head, he giggled a bit and tightly clenched his fist on her lower side.

“You know, only devils can vent up their guilt by hitting someone.” What she just did was a trait unique to devils, when they make a mistake they immediately resort to violence to calm down.

“Cain…Cain you do me a favor?” Alice asked as she rubbed her lower side on him, “What is it.” Cain replied as he started kissing her cheek.

“I don’t think I will feel right without…” She whispered the last words in his ear, just hearing them got Cain riled up for some action, totally forgetting that Gracie was sitting on the same bed.
