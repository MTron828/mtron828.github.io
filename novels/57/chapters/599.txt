The next day.

"Cain, are you awake?" Farryn knocked on Cain's room. The room seemed quiet for a bit. "Coming‚Ä¶" Cain replied.

ZIII! The door slowly opened, and Cain stared at her, "Did father get anything from Able?"

Farryn pointed with her thumb to the main door. "The pirates' got words from the bartender." She then snuck a look inside the room. She could see Zaleria, Bela, and Gracie there‚Ä¶

Cain cut her vision, "And? What did they say?"

She took a step back, "Ah, yeah. They said that the meeting is going to be held on the mountain's summit at dusk, and only a person is allowed."

Cain looked at her, scratching his head. "So, I have the full day empty?"

"Yes!"

"Give me something to do. I can't sit all day long," Cain asked with an empty face. He usually trains with his father or experiments with magic. Chad was busy in the maze trying to sort Able's situation out. He said the maze was a room without ears.

Alice, who was in the other room, approached them. "In that case, mind sparing with me?" She asked, and Cain gave her a puzzled face.

"Sparing with you? Fighting?"

"Yes. Sword, fists, and bows. I was training with Ariel, but she is occupied with Chad. You will do for a replacement." She smiled, and Cain laughed.

"Let's go then."Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

‚Ä¶

After he got ready, he headed to the maze. In the middle of the empty white room, he saw Alice standing alone. Staring at him with her blue eyes and a blank face. "Shall we start?" She said.

Both of her borrowed heavy armor and long sword have seen a lot of fight, as indicated by their countless scratches and dents. From the engraving, Cain could tell they were from the capital's royal guard. She most likely took them from either Isbert or Noel.

"Can you fight in those?" Cain asked, staring at her, "I bet the armor is squashing your chest like dough."

Alice smiled. "Well, Noel doesn't have much to her chest. But don't worry. It's tight but not suffocating." She answered, banging on her chest plate.

Cain smiled. "It will exhaust you faster. If you can't breathe well, then your stamina goes puff."

"This place is a bit cramped. I doubt we will use it. But it's better to have more space." Cain said as he created a demi-plane.

"I didn't intend on using magic. That's why I brought a sword with me." Alice said, walking toward Cain slowly but steadily.

<Strength: 26><Dexterity: 18><Constitution: 20>

<Intelligence: 12><Wisdom: 38><Charisma: 32>

<Devil's innate abilities>

[Undying Devil] Due to her slave bound with the mage Cain Lisworth, Alice will resurrect in hell upon death and can travel back to him immediately. But, due to her absurd regeneration and nature, she can't be killed unless all of her stats drop to 0, and the mage Cain MP also drops to 0.

[Unholy Regeneration] Due to her body being soaked with holy and curse magic, Alice passively regenerates 50HP/second. And can boost it with her magic for up to 200HP/second.

[Hell's Spawn Resilience: Constitution +8] A devil's skin is tough and ragged from its life in the harsh nine hells.

[Bewildering Evil: Charisma +10] Devils are manipulators, deceivers, and seducers. They sway people with sweet words and great benefits just to laugh at their demise.

[Unlocked limiter: Strength +10] Due to her incredible regeneration, Alice can exert force beyond the natural limits of her body. Albeit she takes damage doing so.

[Wisdom of the contradiction: Wisdom +8] Due to her understanding of opposite forces. Alice can see situations in different lights and understand how they act together.

[Devil's Aura: Holy/Curse] Unless she chose otherwise. Alice is always surrounded by an aura of curse and holy magic. It rots the flesh and then heals it in a never-ending cycle of agony.

[Shapeshift: Human/Devil] Alice can freely swap between her devil form and human form. Albeit, she is weaker in the humanoid form than the devil form.

[Devil's Eyes: Blazing Sun/Eminence Eclipse] The blazing sun sees all injuries and illnesses. And burn undead who glare upon it. The eminence eclipse sees death and curses. And rot mortals who glare upon it. The eyes also grant dark vision up to Alice's natural sight, even in magical darkness.

Amaterasu's blessing: Sun.

[Holy Healing] The ability to control healing magic without the need for named spells. Albeit, the cost-effectiveness is lowered without a solid frame to work with.

[Holy Creation] The ability to create objects from condensate holy magic. Like holy weapons.

Amaterasu's blessing: Eclipse.

[Archery] The competence with bows.

Cain vastly surpasses her in everything but wisdom. All he needs to do is to be an adequate training partner for her. That is what he thought, and he was mistaken.

Cain approached Alice to start the fight. As he stood about five feet away from her, he smiled. "Go ahead, you start."

Alice nodded, immediately swinging her sword at Cain. CLANG! He deflected the blade to the side easily. CRACK! Alice's steel boot smashed into his jewels, Thwack! And she immediately followed with a punch to his face.

Cain stumbled back, his nose bleeding. "AGRAA! What's wrong with you?" He asked, feeling a bit dizzy.

Alice rushed toward him, "What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? You could have dodged those, right?" She stared at him.

"Yeah, I could. I just didn't expect you to go for that. Look at your gauntlet and boots." Cain pointed at her armor. It was dented and deformed.

Alice punched him with her full 26-strength. Her armor is made of steel, so it couldn't handle clashing with Cain's 35-strength body. (Steel limit is 20-strength)

"How should we fight then? Naked?" She asked, and Cain gave her a weird look.

"You either have to control your strength. Or I will cast a temporary enchantment on your armor." Cain said. "I suggest the latter, as we will get adequate armor soon."

Alice agreed, and Cain immediately waved his hand on her armor. He simply coated it with telekinesis through enchanting to make it more durable temporarily.

Their fight continued, Alice swung the sword down, and Cain deflected it. She retaliated with a kick, but he punched her in the guts.

As she stood, she saw his sword approach her side. CLANG! She blocked the attack. "GRAA!" She screamed, pushing Cain's sword away. Swoosh! She swung at his neck, but Cain leaped away.

"Can I join?" Selena entered the demi-plane behind them.
