The next room Cain knocked on seemed to be very well lit. He could see the faint light glimmering under the door.

“Who is it? I told you to not annoy me at this time!” Cain was surprised to be yelled at all of a sudden. He knew this sharp and piercing voice, it was Elsie, the maid who yelled at him on day one.

“Sorry, but I will annoy you to my heart’s content!” Cain yelled back, he wasn’t angry, just fooling around. It takes more than a few words to bring his wrath.

Thud! He heard the sound of something falling on the ground, this time he could tell it was a person and not books.

CRACK! Elsie blasted the door open and dropped her head to the ground, “Sorry for yelling at you again Master!”

“Don’t worry about it, I was just joking. Do you have a minute to spare?” Cain helped her to stand, there was a red bump on her forehead.

“Of course, please do whatever you please!” Elise said as she quickly brought him a chair.

“What were you doing?” Cain asked as he saw sewing equipment’s in the desk and five oil lanterns spread around the room. One on each corner and one at the desk..

“Nothing important, I saw the frills sent from Ourals and I thought I could make something similar,” Elise replied with a guilty smile.

“That’s amazing, I didn’t know we had someone who could sew clothes.” Cain stared at the desk. Why he was spending money on clothing shops when he could have Elsie do it and pay her instead? Giving a couple of gold coins to a maid is better than giving that money to an outsider.

“Would you mind doing repairs? I would pay more than clothing shops or whatever they are called.” Cain asked immediately.

“That sounds like an amazing offer, but sadly I lack both skills and equipment to work like that. Time would also be a problem as I have my maid work.” Elise replied with a sad face.

“I could buy you all the equipment you need, let’s have some clothes you can train in them to learn more about sewing, and for the maid work, let’s incorporate them together, sewing is a part of your maid work,” Cain said with an excited face. She will have the same amount of work, but with an extra payment depending on how much sewing she did.

“If that was the case, I don’t see a problem. But don’t expect flawless socks right away.”

Cain smiled, “It doesn’t matter, just learn at the start.”

“Is this why you came looking for me? How did you know I was sewing?” Elise stared at him, she was sure she never told him.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Well, I wasn’t coming here for that, I wanted to install a light in your room. This thing!” Cain created the magical light and lit it in an instant. The light was far brighter than those lanterns and didn’t leave any weird smell.

Elise looked at her desk in surprise, this bright light will make her work fair easier. Her main problem was that she couldn’t sew at day because of her work. With this light, there won’t be a difference between day and night.

“It’s amazing, I can even see the thin threads with ease! Wasn’t such a light only possible in your door’s room?” Elise looked at him.

Cain thought for a moment about what she meant by the door’s room and concluded that she meant the maze. They always get to it with magical doors.

“I can create it everywhere. Do you have any jewelry that I can use to make you able to control it?” Cain asked looking at her.

“I do have a pair of earrings and a bracelet, would they do?” Elsie showed Cain her ears and the bracelet she had tucked in her desk’s drawer.

“The best case. Give them to me for a moment. I can give you even more than just control over light.” Cain said with a big smile on his face. He knew two useless enchantments that will be perfect for her.

Cain enchanted one earring pair to control the light as he did with the others while enchanting the second pair with [Enchantment: Magnify] It makes anything look bigger as long as it is within two feet from the eye, a failed sniper enchantment. The second enchantment was [Enchantment: Steady hand] which eliminated the shaking of hands when doing refined movements, no fighter needed it when swinging his blade.

Those two enchantments were perfect to give Elise an edge in learning how to sew.

After explaining how to activate the enchantments, Cain helped Elise to sit on her chair and handed her what she was sewing. “Now, please try using [Magnify] as I taught you.”

After focusing for a second, Elise activated the enchantment just to be surprised with the piece of cloth in her hand growing bigger. That scared her so much that she fell off her chair.

Cain started laughing as he saw her in the same position as Diana did before. She was just wearing red panties with frills that seemed similar to what she was making.

“Don’t worry, it didn’t grow bigger. You just saw it bigger.” Cain managed to speak.

Being both embarrassed and confused, coupled with her anger problem. Elise swung a kick at Cain expecting him to easily catch it or dodge it.

To her surprise, Cain was as frail as a normal man, especially since he was defenseless being with one of his maids. The kick connected to his stomach with full force, racking his second brain and heart.

Cain fell on his face with his head spinning, “That was…a cow kick…” Cain felt as if an animal kicked him, he was on the verge of vomiting.

Elise’s face turned pale, she has done it. At this point being fired was the best outcome, she might end up locked in the torture room for weeks.

[Lesser healing] With the combination of some magic and his dragon heart beating, he was able to swallow the pain and discomfort and stand.

“That was, like a cow kick I swear.” Cain looked at her. Even with this, he wasn’t angry or even annoyed. Because his father will call him a wimpy bag of bones and blood if he knew about this. A maid almost taking him out with a kick was something unexpected.

At that moment Cain noticed the terror in Elise’s eyes, her smile from being excited to learn was nowhere to be seen.

“Calm down, I’m not angry, I swear.” Cain grabbed her in a hug, “You will need more than a kick to enrage me. Well, you should keep this from the girls. I could swear that one of them will have you whipped at least.”

It took him several minutes to calm the shaking Elise.

“How do you feel?” Cain asked with a worried face.

“No much better…would you mind kicking me back?” She said with a shaking voice, in her heart she wasn’t believing that he could leave her scot-free.

Cain stared at her and thought about it for a moment, “How about you make me a sandwich instead? I do feel a bit hungry right now.” Cain smiled as he helped her stand, this was just to help ease her guild. It didn’t need to be anything extreme just something she can do as compensation.

After gathering her courage, Elise went to the kitchen and made Cain an egg and meat sandwich for his troubles. Making the sandwich gave her enough time to calm down.

“Better?” Cain asked her as she brought the sandwich, “Better.” She replied with a smile.
