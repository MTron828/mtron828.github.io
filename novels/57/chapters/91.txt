The tower was made just like before with a bath and a bedroom. Cain and the girls yearned for a relaxing bath.

The hot bath worked nicely to soothe Cain’s aching muscles, giving him a much-needed rest. The girls refrained from making a move at him when they saw him relaxing in the bath with his eyes closed.

Unknown to them, Cain’s body that didn’t stop hurting since he was woken up by Alice had finally calmed down. He had finally got a moment’s rest.

After spending more than he should in the bath, Cain finally followed the girls to the upper room.

In their undergarment, they have gotten ready to sleep. Cain could feel his eyelid double in weight as he glared and the white bed sheet and plump pillows.

“Are you alright?” Asked Alice, checking Cain’s temperature. “You’re a bit hot!” Alice said with a surprised face. “I just got from the bath, it’s nothing,” Cain replied with a yawn.

He knew it wasn’t the bath, he did have a fever as his body was freaking out with all the dead tissues inside him. The [Animate dead] allowed him to keep them in check and not treat or remove them. Alice’s [Cursed decay] caused the flesh to rot away, he doesn’t need a healer to tell him that having parts of your organs rot while you’re alive.

Having a fever was the best-case scenario for him.

“You don’t seem that well to me, let me heal you again just in case.” [Holy Healing] as Cain expected, his body’s high MP and magic resistance combined with cursed magic in his wounds negated the healing magic.

“How do you feel?” Alice asked while checking his temperature once again, it didn’t drop at all.

He will need a high-level healing spell to heal his wound, probably at least seventh-tier magic. ‘I should probably ask Miko for help, she might be able to do it!’

“Sofia, come here and check his temperature with me, I might be feeling it off!” Alice called Sofia for help. Cain knew they wouldn’t be able to make a change to his condition.

As he was already tried and didn’t want them to keep him away from the bed longer, Cain silently sneaked behind them and hugged Selena who was laying on the bed, using her as a body pillow.

“Nya?” She meowed, gasping for breath as Cain suddenly squeezed her body. “What gotten into you-nya?” she brushed his hair, hugging his as well.

Cain who was starting to feel comfortable being supported by her elastic chest got slowly turned on, soothing his pain. It was the same as the hot bath, the pain slowly faded.

“He did go for her…” Sofia said with a wry smile, “He seems to be fine, I guess.” Alice added up as she walked toward the bed as well.

Cain slowly reached to Selena’s mouth, sucking on her lips. She quickly realized that he was already half asleep, hugging him even tighter and taking the initiative. She slowly peeled her undergarment caressing his body with her own. Reacting to his slight twitches, she pushed her tongue into his mouth as she slowly plugged him in.

Cain couldn’t have felt better, now that the pain started to slowly fade the exhaustion took over, pushing him to the edge of the dreamland. As he didn’t differentiate between dream and reality, Cain helped himself to slowly play with Selena.

Selena wasn’t a fan of slow play but she still enjoyed him slowly teasing her and ended up purring most of the time as she played with herself for added stimulation.

After he was done with her, the half-asleep Cain pulled on Alice’s hair as if wanted to draw her near him. As she felt the weak puller on her hair, she bent over following his lead.

Alice saw him dragging her face down as he slowly pulled her from Selena’s inside, her stomach turned to wonder why it was always her. The steaming hot flesh was pushed inside her mouth nonetheless, she silently allowed him to do whatever he wanted.

As if he was just using her mouth to clean, he quickly pulled out after a couple of thrusts. Lifting one of her legs revealing her dripping parts, Cain quickly pushed himself inside her. Unlike how he was with Selena (Who was now watching in jealousy), he seemed much more energetic with Alice, even getting a bit violent.

She started to feel slight pain as he spread her legs a bit over their limit, with each thrust being more violent than the first. As his left hand held her ankle up to keep her spread out, the other hand grimed her bosom hard enough to leave marks.

“He’s half asleep, why?” Alice couldn’t tell what Cain’s problem was.

At one point, with a thrust that forced her hips more than they could handle, Cain got deeper than what she could call pleasant. Her body jolted from the sudden painful act, she pulled back instinctively.

Cain quickly followed her, pushing even further before being stopped by Selena and Sofia, he quickly woke up realizing what he was doing.

“At least tell me first!” Alice cried, gently massaging her fine hips.

After hearing what they had to say, Cain could quickly understand what had happened to him. It was something that he saw the mermaids do a lot, half-sleep. The concept was simple, turning off half of his brain while leaving the other active, It was a rare case and Cain didn’t have accurate knowledge about the subject to say for sure. It was probably due to him trying to keep [Animate dead] active while he was asleep that his brain didn’t shut off as it should.

After apologizing to Alice, she turned back on all four spreading herself for more. “I can take it as long as you’re aware of what you’re doing.” Alice meant he could stop if she told him to, probably doing it with his in that stat wasn’t the best idea.

“Are you sure?” Cain asked, remembering how they talked about him almost hurting her. She silently stared at him with a pouting face, her answer was obvious.

Cain took the opportunity to pound her to his heart’s content, leaving her twitching after the deed was done.

When Sofia approached for her turn, Cain had already fallen asleep on top of Alice leaving her with a deep feeling of emptiness, both in her heart and belly.

…

The morning quickly came and Cain woke up feeling sore, his whole body was hurting like hell to the point he found it hard to get out of the bed. His only solution was a quick dip in the hot water to get his body relaxed enough to move.

As the pain seemed more abnormal than yesterday, Cain quickly checked his state.

[Active curse of rotting]: The body is slowly rotting from the inside out. Curse applier [Alice Forberg]

‘Oh no…’ Cain could feel his head hurting, this was a pain to deal with. To think that Alice cursed him without even knowing it, if she didn’t mean it that means she wouldn’t be able to take it off. ‘Yeah, there is no point in telling as she wouldn’t be able to help.’ Cain decided to keep the fact that Alice is the one who cursed him a secret and blames it on the succubus.

The curse seems to be weakening him over time, threatening his life. His strength and constitution have dropped by one in a day, meaning he didn’t have much time left.

If his strength reached 0 he would enter a coma and if his constitution reached 0 his body will give up on life.

With the current curse speed, it will take 34 days to drop his HP to 0 and kill him but that wasn’t the problem as it will only take 11 days for him to die from his Constitution dropping to 0 and only 10 days for him to enter a coma. There were other problems as well.

At 5 strength he wouldn’t be able to walk, at 3 he would find it hard to speak and breathe, at 2 he wouldn’t be able to swallow food and at 1 he would be completely paralyzed.

At 5 constitution his body will become so weak that even sitting can leave him with bruises. It will only worsen from down there to the point that his teeth would fall out on their own at 2 constitutions.

Cain slowly put his clothes out and followed the girls outside, Alice got him in a tight spot. Her curse was something else, she should learn how to use it. Cain wasn’t angry at her, he wasn’t even worried about his health. As long as they can find a healer that could use seventh-tier healing magic he would be okay. He already had his mind on Miko, doubt she could use it so all he needs is to teach her the hard way.

‘I only have 5 days to find and teach her seventh-tier healing magic before I’m completely bedridden.” If only I could use it on my own without finishing myself off.

Cain resolved himself to face the rough days awaiting him.
