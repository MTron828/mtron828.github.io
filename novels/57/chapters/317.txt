“Perish!” The angel swung her sword down at Morena’s skeletal neck.

CRACK! The chains shattered and Morena twisted her head backward to fire a breath at the angel.

Seeing the acid breath about to explode at her, the angel’s wings shed bright light. The muscles in her arms popped out as golden veins covered her neck and arm. [Divine Slash] A crescent projectile of pure holy magic fired from her sword. Morena’s breath got split in half.

Just as the angel was about to pull her warbow and shoot. Morena smacked her to the ground with a tail swipe.

The angel didn’t even stutter and landed on her feet, with a serious glare on her face. “You accursed monster, breaking the natural rules of the world!” She growled.

Morena prowled slowly, violet flame erupting in her empty eye sockets. “Isn’t you being here also breaking the rules? Stop being such a hypocrite!” Morena growled.

“We only come when being like you emerge, if you died normally I would have never come here. Who wants to leave heaven and come down to this dumpster?” The angel started floating.

“Do you have dumpsters up there? Nice to know, Devil kin!” Morena mocked her.

Hearing those words enraged the angel, “Don’t lump us with them, worm!” In the blink of an eye, the angel appeared beside Morena and sliced one of her wings off.

Morena leaped backward and grinned, “Did I hit a nerve? Devil kin!”

Finally, a smile ran across the angel’s face, “Guess my job is done.” The angel smiled as she ran away.

“What do…” At that moment Morena felt it, all of this was just a distraction to give the most dangerous person here time to prepare.

The ground around Zaleria has melted into boiling lava, in an instant, a white light flashed engulfing Morena. No explosion and no loud noise besides Zaleria’s roar. The breath simply erased everything in its way leaving a red hot trail of destruction.

This wasn’t the first time something like this happened. Sofia had achieved something similar in the earth dragon fight when she compressed her magic to increase the power of her fire lance. Zaleria could do it at a much larger scale to the point the heat of her breath simply melt anything that have lower heat tolerance than steel instantly.

“As crazy as the scripture say, I’ve only seen such heat achieved by the disintegrate spell.” The angel admired the raw power of Zaleria’s fully charged breath.

“I don’t think I will be able to use my breath soon,” Zaleria growled.

“For how long?” The angel asked with a smile.

“A few minutes at…” At that moment they saw Morena’s disintegrated body regenerate in an instant.

“I even felt pain from that, respect to you sister. I bet that would even tear a hole in the king’s wings. You’re almost as crazy as mother was.” Morena growled.

The angel immediately readied her sword while Zaleria braced herself for a second round.

As Morena started charging her breath, a weird creature leaped toward her face. “COOCAAA!” Rieth screamed as he punched her skull. “I hate nothing more than dragons but I might make an exception for a bone dragon!”RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Morena looked toward him, “A Kenku?”

Mei rushed toward Zaleria and the angel, “I called reinforcement through the maze, even if Lord Cain can’t be here that doesn’t mean we are powerless.” Mei smiled as she looked toward Morena.

Thud! Thud! Hati and Selena punched Morena’s front legs and caused her to fall.

Just before Morena’s head could hit the ground, Sofia flew right in through her eye socket and used [Fire storm] inside her skull. With a red flash, Morena’s head exploded.

Before she could realise it, a staring contest has started. The angel was staring at Alice who stared back at her.

“Why do I sense holy magic in you?” The angel growled.

“Back at you, why do we smell alike?” Alice replied with a calm growl.

“You two, this isn’t the place to fight.” Zaleria shifted back to her human form. “Care to heal my throat?”

At the same time, both Alice and the angel extended their hands toward Zaleria’s head and cast [Holy Healing]

“I guess we have to leave the argument for later, don’t be the one to ask for violence first.” Alice smiled as she stared at the angel.

“Hatred between you is just like that of worms and plants, even if some end up eating the harvest, some also end up breaking the dirt and blessing the land. Those were goddess Chauntea’s words.” The angel said with a serious face.

“Calling us worms is a bit harsh don’t you think?” Alice smiled as she extended her wings releasing her full devilish powers.

“You two, let’s get take care of Morena first can we?” Zaleria grabbed both of their heads.

They both sighed, “Fine”

Mei found a hole in the ground to hide in. A dragon, a devil, and an angel have teamed up to slay a dracolich. She could only hope that all people have evacuated the place. Those who stayed are going to witness true hell.

Evil, Good, and Chaos. Those are Devils, angels, and Dragons. The three races who stood at the top.

Alice could finally spread her wings freely, there was no one to call her out on letting all of her curse magic run wild.

Alice flew at her top speed toward Morena, extending her hands [Cursed Decay]. Morena’s bones started to crack as they got weaker and weaker. Even bones will rot eventually.

Morena flew to the sky to run away, it didn’t seem like a fight that she could win.

“Get back here!” The angel screamed as she caught Morena with her golden chains.

Rushing ahead, Hati and Selena climbed the chains with their claws and latched to Morena’s wings. With enough effort, they managed to snap her weakened bones in half. Since the wings held the magic that allowed her to fly, her body quickly slammed onto the ground.

Seeing that she was being taken down, Morena shifted back to her humanoid form. She appeared naked just like how she used to be in life. She didn’t have enough time to shut down the illusion magic that gave her that shape.

Thud! She landed and stared at them with death dripping from her eyes. “GRAAAAAAAAAAAA!” She yelled and leaped toward Zaleria.

Zaleria easily dodged the straight punch by taking a step back, CRACK! Since her body was already dead, Morena snapped her back to extend her punch and landed a hit on her.

As she stumbled backward she saw acid drip from every crevice in Morena’s body.

Thud both the angel and Reith leaped ahead and tried to hit Morena. Reith came with a back kick while the angel swung her greatsword.

“GRAAR!” With a roar, Morena kicked the tip of the angel’s Greatsword causing it to get stuck in her bones. In a single leap, she kicked Rieth away and grabbed the angel’s head between her thighs.

Morena tried to twist the angel’s head but got surprised by how resilient she was.

ROAR! Selena leaped and pit Morena’s face off while Hati tore a chunk of her thighs releasing the angel.

Instead of blood, acid gushed from Morena’s wounds and formed wings on her back. As she stared at them with her ripped face she smiled. [Create Undead]

As necrotic energy rushed from her body, Hundreds of undead rose from the ground.

“The fight has just started, hold until he reaches it.” Zaleria punched Morena away. She could sense where Chad was heading. Right now, only he might be able to put an end to this fight.
