Chapter ﻿492 Who's the true monster? I

"Come out!" Morena yelled at the top of her lungs. A loud cracking noise boomed from the Hell Gate.

With the ground shaking, devils and undead sinners started flooding from the gate. Their numbers were in the thousands, painting the entire place black.

Those reinforcements were mainly composed of an elite group of Abishai, a huge amount sinners and undead sinners, and some devils.

"Abishai, lead the rest and kill those girls. I will deal with the white-haired mage." She growled with an angry grin.

The Abishai stared at the girls in silence, their eyes locked onto Sofia. They could sense her presence, none of them wanted to be the first to move or speak.

Thud! Thud! Sofia started walking toward them, crimson flames dripping from her green eyes as her feet left the ground scorched.

"What are you doing? I told you to attack!" Morena screamed and the Abishais jolted.

"She doesn't even look like her!" One of the screamed to gather his courage, leaping at Sofia with a poisonous blade.

ROOAR! Sofia opened her mouth roaring a burst of crimson flames. Her breath scorched the Abishai who attacked her as well as all of those behind him.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Seeing that she killed them without hesitation, the feel of her flames. It was her, no doubt about it. All those who died and were resurrected became certain.

"Lady Tiamat, we're…" BRAAAA! Sofia burned them with another before they could speak.

"Sofia, stop."

As she heard Cain's words she stopped, "They will listen to you, command them to attack the undead sinners."

Sofia glared at them and was about to speak.

"No need for words lady Tiamat will get it done!" All of them rushed to attack the undead sinners.

On the other side of the battle, Alice was sitting on a stone watching the battlefield. Hundreds of rotten corpses spread around her.

"Rest in peace, you shall never resurrect under my curse." She said with a smile.

On this whole battlefield, under her was the only place they could find peace. The soldiers of hell who wanted some peace, are done with suffering rushed to her praying and begging.

"Oh, upper-rank. Please grant us mercy and peace!" they chanted.

…

Selena rushed between the sinners and devils ripping and tearing, each strike of her took a life. She mowed them down charging toward Morena in a feral rage.

GRRAAAWAWA! Seeing Selena's fist accelerate toward her, Morena answered with one of her own. The two fists clashed.

Selena remembered the first time they fought Morena, the strength difference was just too much. And even now, she couldn't hope to match her.

CRACK!

But, with [Berserker] and the knuckle duster made by Mary and enchanted by Cain, the story was different.

CRACK! Morena's knuckle cracked, and Selena's fist twisted her hand and went straight for the face, sending her directly toward Cain.

Feeling dizzy from the unexpectedly powerful punch, she opened her eyes. Drawing necrotic magic on her, she healed her wounds and swung an acid claw at Cain.

Cain lifted his staff up [Reverse Gravity] pulling Morena up in a flash.

She spread her wings, flying directly at him. Roar! She unleashed a breath of pure necrotic.

As the breath reached Cain, he didn't bother to dodge and instead opened his mouth [Ravenous Void]

Cain sucked the whole breath as if it was nothing stunning Morena. "I also have a Draconis fundamentum, two of them if I counted the unmatured one inside Gray. And, people like you should be asking me to teach them necromancy."

Cain's body started to glow with purple lines, "I haven't done this since the cave in Ourals. Necromancers call it the right to name yourself a master of the dead. You have to become one…"

Undead were simply corpses controlled by a mana circuit that act like a nervous system and a muscular system at the same time. That is why undead eyes glow with necrotic magic and the reason skeletons could even move without muscles.

Cain enchanted his body with the same mana circuit. Creating a second nervous system and enchanting his strength with necrotic magic.

"Standing between life and Lichdom, impressive but what could accomplish? Adding the mere strength of a zombie to your body will give nothing!" Morena rushed at him with a kick to the face.

BAM! Her foot passed by Cain's head like a cannonball and blood splattered everywhere.

… "Huh?!" Morena noticed that she lost two of her toes and that her foot was feeling numb. Thud! She leaped away to regenerate her wound while staring at Cain with a confused face.

"Your taste horrible, was that kick filled with dirt?" Cain had blood dripping from his mouth, he had lost some of his teeth but they were immediately regenerated by the magic he was absorbing from Alice.

"What did you…" Morena gasped.

"All I need is to keep this state and I'm adaptable with the undead. I'm going to eat you like I did Gray…TO EVERY LAST BIT!" As his voice grew harsher, his body expanded into a necrotic explosion.

In the next moment, Morena saw the chimera's massive jaw open in front of her face.

BAM! She immediately leaped away to avoid being eaten. Cain's tentacles followed her at almost the same speed.

"The monster who ate my son, I was wondering when it will get out!" Morena transformed into her draconic body and bit Cain's tentacles away like they were sausages.

[Elemental burst: Ground burst] As Cain cast the spell, the earth beneath Morena exploded with sharp stone spikes everywhere. They weren't able to skewer her tough draconic body but they did their job of guiding her toward Sofia.

At that moment, Morena felt something approaching from behind her. As she turned around, Sofia's stomped her down in her draconic form.

"Get away from me!" Morena growled. ROAR! Unleashing an acid breath at point blank.

CRACK! The acid immediately started to freeze upon contacting Sofia, she was sucking all the heat from around her.

Morena pushed her away and shifted to her humanoid form and tried to make a distance between them less she freeze.

[Thunder Flash]

STAB! To her surprise, Cain stabbed her with his staff from the back.

"You!" She yelled swinging a fist at him.

[Teleport] he dodged and stabbed her stomach with his bare hands pulling a chunk of flesh.

"GAW!" Selena jumped and punched her toward Sofia.

Sofia flew in and stomped Morena's face with a fiery kick. She then opened her mouth gathering a ball of flames.

[Prismatic dome] Cain locked both Sofia and Morena since the thing coming next was something that only Sofia could survive a direct hit from.

[Hellish Detonation] The inside of the doom turned pure white with a menacing rumbling.

"Will Sofia be fine?" Selena asked glaring at the dome.

"You forget to add nya," Cain replied.

"Nya, nya, nay!" Selena yelled back.

"Of course, she will be fine, I can't hurt her after all," Cain replied.

When the light faded, Cain opened the dome and Sofia leaped toward him. "Cain that was scary." She cried.

"See, I told you that you can survive it thanks to your resistance and that shard inside you," Cain replied.

"You girl, that mark on your body!" Morena resurrected and glared at them. Bluh! She puked blood. "What, I just resurrected," Morena growled.

"Ah, you're missing this!" Cain showed her the chunk of flesh he took earlier, it was her liver. "I did cut it from you and preserved it, even if you resurrected, hell won't create a second one as long as it exists."

Cain's hand turned into a tentacle and swallowed the liver.

It was then that Morena noticed that her Toes haven't regenerated as well…Cain was eating her bit by bit so she won't resurrect ever again.
