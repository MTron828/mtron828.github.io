“Be wary, he is a…” One of the kidnappers screamed as he saw Kayden’s demon form. CRANG! In the blink of an eye, Kayden sliced all of them and grabbed the bag.

Looking down at his Katana, it was shattered. Kayden sighed, “I forgot it has no back edge, I need to get used to that.” Kayden did a reverse cut with the katana’s back edge against an armed kidnapper, which was a bad move.

Kayden then released Lily and started inspecting her body, “What are you doing?” She cried.

“Those dogs were sick, I want to see if they scratched or bite you,” Kayden replied, he was worried she might catch dog madness. He intended to have her take the medicine anyway but he was too worried not to check.

“They didn’t, let me go!” She cried again, all they did was drag her into the house, tie her, close her mouth and threw her in the bag.

TROK! TROK! TROCK! “What a strange one…”

Suddenly a man walked into Kayden’s illusory terrain. The presence around him was different from normal humans, Kayden instantly knew, this was a demon.

Kayden turned around, the man was a bit short standing at around 5 feet tall. He has short black hair and red fly-like eyes. Even though he was decently built, the muscles on his arms and legs were apparent with him only wearing shorts.

“A demon? What do you want?” Kayden asked with a serious tone.

“You can call me Raptor, I patrol the borders of his domain. Each new demon that wants to pass needs to offer loyalty.” Raptor said with a smile.

“His?” Kayden started at Raptor.

“He doesn’t wish his name to be spoken. If I must say, his lordship, the demon lord.” Raptor smiled. The demon lord had told him a smile can increase his chance of success in recruiting.

“Fine, do you know where I can find him then?” Kayden replied with a straight face. They were going to fight the demon lord, knowing his location will make the job much easier.

“Sorry, but I can’t say, even though a lot of demons ask that question. You can’t give your loyalty directly to the demon king at first, you need to swear it here first, and then you can go to meet him.” Raptor tried his hardest to keep a smile. That order from the demon lord was strange, but he couldn’t go against him.

“I see…” Thud! Kayden immediately conjured a demon blade and rushed at Raptor. He aimed at the demon’s exposed neck.

CLANG! Raptor deflected Kayden’s strike with his forearm in one swift move and countered with a powerful kick. The attack did almost no damaged besides sending Kayden backward a few feet.

“What a reaction, your abdomen muscles absorbed the entire impact. Your talent will only be wasted at this rate, join us.” Raptor extended a hand.

Kayden looked at his demon blade, something was off. That demon’s head should be flying. He also didn’t try and absorb the kick, it was simply weak.

He quickly conjured five other swords and rushed at Raptor with a barrage of strikes.

Raptor blocked most of them, even the hits that managed to land simply bounced from his skin.

“What are you doing? Fighting will only get you closer to death!” Raptor yelled.

It was then that Kayden realized the problem, he was using a demon blade to try and kill a demon. Of course, that won’t work.

CRACK! As Kayden heard the faint sound, he looked beyond his illusion. The building around them has cracked from the previous exchange and people are starting to gather. Daraku and Yamauba have been nagging about how he shouldn’t show his demonic body to other humans.

Slowly, Kayden shifted back to his human form. Even his eyes have returned to just two.

“This is enough for you.” Kayden walked toward one of the kidnappers and picked his katana. “I can feel them out there.” He said dispelling the illusion.

MEIYO! Takeshi leaped from behind Kayden with an earth-shattering scream. The downward slash was so strong that Raptor could hear the windows rattle from the wind pressure.

Raptor leaped back, there was no way he is going to block that attack. ZWAN! The swing cut right through the stone ground and went back up, Kayden was plowing the ground as he kept swinging behind the running Raptor.

Since the illusion shattered, the people in the street were shocked to see Takeshi rampaging like that against a demon.

Thud! Raptor leaped over a stall and to the main street. Takeshi gave little care as he tore right through the thing, a demon was more dangerous to leave alive than to care for a stall.

“You don’t care about property damage do you?” Raptor said with an annoyed glare.

“Those who see evil and don’t act to eliminate it, they lack honor!” Takeshi screamed back.

Raptor smiled, he had his answer. Leaping to the side he grabbed a little girl by the hair.

“Then let’s see you plow right through this.” Raptor tried to throw the girl at Takeshi but he didn’t feel her weight.

“Leave the pups alone.” Kayden sliced Raptor’s hand before he could exert the smallest of pressure on the girl’s hair. He had found it, demons are resistant to demon magic. Before he could find a suitable way to fight them, his best bet was to fight in his human form and with mundane weapons.

CHU! Takeshi’s scream caused the crowd to jump in surprise, how a man could be so loud? Seeing the little girl almost being harmed enraged him even further.

Takeshi’s moves changed, gracefully swinging his blade without a sound. With a quick step, he reached Raptor and grabbed him by the hair.

“You…” Raptor gasped.

Takeshi changed his posture and twisted his body, throwing Raptor across the street into a less crowded spot.

“Protecting the people is our duty as samurais, you dare lay your hand on what we hold dear?” With the most smooth moves and leaps, his sword already reached Raptor.

“Like I care!” Raptor screamed as his hair turned white. Swoosh! Punching the air caused a shock wave to hit Takeshi in the guts and blasted him away.

Just from behind Takeshi, Kayden rushed ahead.

Raptor released another blast.

CLING! With an upward swing, Kayden sliced the air blast in half which surprised Raptor, he didn’t think such a thing was possible. But as the horrid sound implied, the katana shattered again, this wasn’t a fight where simple steel could hold.

“Now you are unarmed swordsman, let’s see you…GRA!” Kayden punched the Raptor in the face.

Raptor didn’t take fondly to that and quickly swung back at Kayden with a kick. Kayden ducked under the attack and punched Raptor in the jewels hard enough to send him flying.

Raptor quickly changed his direction mid-air with a blast and landed feet first on a building wall, “Is this all?” He smiled, leaping back at Kayden with a flying kick.

Kayden grabbed the kick with his hand and slammed Raptor to the ground causing a massive shockwave.

As Kayden was still holding his foot, Raptor took the chance to kick Kayden in the face sending his fly toward the other side of the street.

Kayden immediately regained his balance and leaped back in the fight, he wasn’t at his best in his human form but he could still pack a punch.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Takeshi leaped in with another roar, YU! He had dropped his Nodashi and went in bare-handed. He grabbed Raptor from the back of his head and smacked him to the ground.

Kayden took the chance to kick Raptor away like a ball.

“Fine, the fun time ended. I will kill the both of you!” Raptor screamed as he fully transformed into his demon form. Black serpent-like scales covered his body and his eyes turned yellow. Two antennae emerged from his forehead and his jaw sprung open with a row of sharp teeth. His hair turned purple as the presence he was emitting changed.

“I give up, Acting nice won’t get us anywhere!” Raptor said as he faced Takeshi and Kayden. “Raptor, the demon blessed by Beelzebub. Ranked seven among the seven great demons. It either join us or the whole city dies.” Raptor walked toward them with confidence.

There are only seven demons that got blessed by devils to be the strongest. It doesn’t matter what kind of demon Kayden was, there was no way he could overpower a blessed demon.
