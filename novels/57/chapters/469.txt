Chapter 470 The devil unleashed

The left one turned to ash while the right one’s flesh melted off his bones. As Sofia and Alice landed beside Cain, the remaining nupperibos took a step back to avoid the flames and cursed magic.

Cain looked at Alice with a smile, ‘Sofia was always strong, but sadly Alice was constrained to a healer due to the nature of her magic. But right here in hell, nobody will complain about her being a devil, she can become a blaster.’

“Hold up, we never knew an upper rank was with you! We will…” One of the nupperibos rushed to speak.

“Silence, I was wrong about you!” Alice lifted her hands and golden light crackled from her eye. It was then that the nupperibos noticed something strange, she feels like an upper rank, but why there are black feathers on her wings?

A golden wide blade appeared in her right hand while a jet black one on her left, just standing close to her was causing the nupperibos skin to start burning. Her wings were radiating a deadly mixture of holy and cursed magic, especially here in hell against the sinners, both of them were extremely dangerous.

“Run!” They turned around to rush away, but their fat and sluggish bodies only failed them. Alice’s speed and instincts as an upper-rank devil made her able to fly between them like a bat dodging stalagmite.

A left side swing followed but a downward right cut, she flew between all of the nupperibos cutting them.

Those who opened their stomach to eat her got surprised by their bodies getting squashed instant to the ground. Cain was watching and he wasn’t going to let Alice get hit.

CLINK! CLANG! TIN! Alice landed after she killed them all. She turned toward Cain with a smile on her face, blood evaporating from her face (Sinner blood is getting burned off by the holy magic)

“How do you feel?” Cain asked.

“I can finally go all out, I don’t even need to stay in my human form.” She replied with a smile. Both Cain and Sofia smiled in return, she was probably the most unused power in their team until now.

Zaleria and the rest walked down the hill to check on them, “Will they revive soon?” Farryn asked looking at the rotten corpses.

“Hell is made for suffering, the stronger of a sinner you are, the quicker you will revive to suffer more. Those will probably take a couple of days to get back up. Keep in mind that they can choose to revive immediately, but most don’t do that since death is the only rest time they have.” Cain replied.

“Can’t they kill themselves?” Zaleria asked.

“In that case, they will get revived immediately into a pit of flame or acid, whichever would hurt them more but not kill them.”

“This place is brutal,” Nemmoxon said.

“This is hell, it’s supposed to be brutal,” Hati said looking around.

“Where do we go now, did you get any information?” Zaleria asked.

“Didn’t need to, I already scouted the area with Spindle before. Just wanted to see if they will react as expected, which they did.” Cain looked toward Ellie and Mary. “You two stay close to me, let’s head to the closed Devil settlement.

Everyone started walking behind Cain chatting. Zaleria was telling Sofia that she used a bit more firepower than she needed, if an attack incinerated someone, she probably wasted mana.

Nemmoxon was walking with Selena, talking about if it’s possible to eat sinners’ flesh. To Nemmoxon as a good dragon, she usually refuses to eat any intelligent creature, since they all have the ability to repent. But here, they can’t and she was thinking if she could take a bit. Selena on the other hand was worried that Cain might get angry if she started eating them, this was the reason she didn’t attack earlier.

Farryn was telling Alice that it might be a good idea to hide her holy magic here since this was hell, the land of cursed magic. Alice replied by saying, “We can just kill them, which is something they like after all.”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Alice’s thought train was simple in notion yet complicated in reality. She hit her cursed magic so they won’t have to fight innocent humans who come to kill her. But here they are, sinners, so killing them is acceptable. To add to that, they rest only when dead, so it’s a mercy to murder them over and over.

Ellie was walking with Mary and Gracie behind Cain, she was scared to the bones. This was the first time she saw them fighting close on.

Cain had just blasted the monster’s torso in the blink of an eye, which could have been her if had she bitten him. What shocked her more is the ladies.

Alice is a calm, gentle, and occasionally passive-aggressive mistress. She always gets on to them when they make the food a bit more salty than she likes or fails to brew the tea just right. She remembered mistakenly walking into the room while she was whipping Klara after the problem she caused, Ellie ended up sharing the punishment as well.

If Cain was a relaxed master who gave them all the opening they need, Alice was the strict one making sure they stay in line. As a mistress, she resampled Lisa when making sure the maids had both the stick and carrot available at all times.

Seeing that she was a devil, and could fight such scary monsters with ease. Everything was making sense.

Mary was looking for any chance to sneak out and take care of Morena before they could get to her. But she could feel Cain keeping her under strict surveillance with his magic.

“Cain…” Mary patted Cain on the shoulder.

“What?”

“I need to take care of something, you know what. Just wait for me for a couple of minutes.” She whispered in his ear.

Cain gave her a short dubious look before replying, a normal person wouldn’t have noticed the shift in his expression so she didn’t comment on it.

“We can go back and use the gate, you then do it at home.”

“No need for that, I will just go behind some rocks quickly.” She whispered back.

“Ok, I will make a room for you with some water.” He lifted his hand and created a square room with [Earth Wall], coated the whole thing with [Sylph’s tiny hut] (So the water won’t disappear), and then made water inside with [Create water]

After thanking him. Mary went inside with a different intention.

Mary wanted to get an opening to go and seal Morena in a steel box (Take her about ten minutes) and throw her into the second layer if she had time (Another ten minutes)

With such a time frame, she couldn’t possibly trick Cain with a twenty-minute toilet break. She needs to do it separately and seal Morena now, and find an opportunity to get rid of her later.

When she was inside, she was unable to leave for a single reason. Cain didn’t drop his surveillance, if fact he increased it.

Watching her from six directions (Up and down, left and right, back and front) with an invisible [Arcane eye] listening from every corner with the whole room being enchanted to do that and detect her magic on top.

‘I’m in a toilet, can’t you look away for a moment?’ She thought, ‘Can’t blame him though if he left one direction unmonitored, I would have used it to slip away.’

Mary gave up, she need to find another opportunity.

She was taking the guise of a normal human guild girl, she wouldn’t have noticed his monitoring in that was true. To keep the front, she has to do it in front of Cain’s surveillance and pretend nothing happened.

‘What did trigger him? I must find out.’ Taking care of her business, she started thinking about what could have been the reason to make Cain monitor her like this.

Even going through all of her memories, she shouldn’t have done anything to draw his attention like this. Was he just keeping everyone under surveillance like this in hell? No, they were monitored but not like her.

…

“Did you finish?” Cain asked as she got out and approached him.

“Yes, thanks for your patience.” She replied with a smile while a storm was going through her head, ‘Asking the obvious question, you were watching everything.’
