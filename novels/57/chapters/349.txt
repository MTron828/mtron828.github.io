After making sure everything was alright with Elise, Cain headed toward the next room. But no matter how much he knocked, he got no answer. He couldn’t feel any presence inside so they must have left.

The next was the same, as did the next and the next. All the remaining maids were nowhere to be seen. It was then that Cain remembered seeing Diana downstairs so he decided to look for her.

On his way, he made sure to install lights in every corner and ceiling that has a chandelier or a torch. Efficiency was of importance as he wanted to have some sleep that night.

As he scouted the house, he could see a dim light coming from the kitchen. Someone must have lit a fire there.

“Someone here?” Cain asked with a quiet voice, he didn’t want to scare them.

“Master? Did you come to set a light here as well?” Diana was there heating a bit pot of water.

“That’s one thing, but what are you doing at this hour?” Cain wasn’t sure how to think of her cooking in such a big pot in the middle of the night. They didn’t need it for tomorrow’s feast, do they?

“The other maids are taking a bath and the water for them needs to clean before tomorrow’s big day,” Diana replied with a smile just to be surprised by Cain frowning.

“Then why aren’t you using the heater? I believe you know how to operate it.”

“I do know but, the thing is…” Diana hesitated, “The heater wastes a lot of water and precious firewood, and we can’t just use it for everyone.”

“And we’ve been using it whenever we fancied a bath? You should have told me before.” Cain stared at her..

“Please don’t misunderstand my words master, the bath is no waste on you. It was designed to be only used by the master and his wives. It isn’t made for us maids to use since we’re too numerous.” Diana tried to explain it.

“So the problems are water and fuel. Fine, let’s head down there and see what I can do.” Cain ordered Diana to follow him with the repair equipment that the workers use to fix the heater.

As they reached the basement, Cain took a closer look at the machine. It was simple, a hand pump pushes the water through steel pipes that pass by the inside of a furnace. The flames heat the water as it travels through.

The hand pump needs to be operated by someone while another person feeds the furnace.

Cain took his shirt off and opened the furnace door, the thing was cold as it wasn’t lit lately.

“Master it’s dirty!” Diana screamed as she saw him plunge into the ash and scoot. That thing was dirtier than an old chimney.

“I did stick myself inside the stinking stomach of an Ogre and swam in the lizardfolk’s swamps. This thing is as clean as I would hope it will be.” Cain didn’t seem to care.

He quickly grabbed the pipes inside and called Diana. “Hit the pump a few times if you can.”

Diana tried to push the pump but she couldn’t do it, “I can’t master, it’s too hard for me. Katherine usually does it, should I call her?”

Cain thought about it for a second, “Touch my legs if you can, skin to skin contact is required to transfer the spell.”

Hearing his words, Diana lifted his pants up a bit touching his ankles. [Lesser Empowerment] She could feel a surge of power in her body, it resembled surging heat that radiated from her heart.

When she tried to use the pump, it was far easier than before.

It was then that Cain managed to feel where all the pipes are and how the water was flowing. All that remained is for him to start inscribing magic.

Cain first used [Earth wall] to block all the pipes and then used [Enchanting] [Create water] to make the stones that he just created inside of them secrete water in the bath’s direction.

After that Cain used [Enchanting][Fireball] to bind the spell to the furnace inside and prevent it from exploding. This will act as the heater core.

After that Cain slid from inside the furnace like a walking coal block. CLAP! He then used [Arcane Gate] to create a minuscule portal inside the furnace to act as a link to the maze, he will use that to power it from the maze’s Mana instead of his or the maids’ Mana.

[Enchanting] The remaining part was as simple as linking all of the spells to a single enchanted panel that display two buttons and two sliders.

“Come here and have a look. This button here controls the water, when it’s blue, the water is flowing and it’s off when it’s red. The slider underneath it is how much water is flowing. This button here is for the fire, on and off like the water, and the slider underneath controls the intensity of the heat.”

Cain quickly lost Diana’s attention as she zoned out thinking about the weird floating paper thing.

“And here is the best thing.” Cain grabbed her hand and passed it underneath the panel. “You can take it anywhere inside the mansion as long as you have an item enchanted by me!”

The panel was floating above her hand like magic, it was magic after all.

“Does it really work?” Diana asked, she couldn’t believe that such a problem was solved in a few minutes of work by him.

Cain pushed both buttons and turned the heat slider to mid-heat and the water to mid-flow. “They should be getting water, in the bath.”

Cain then started to walk toward the bath with Diana, he might need to wash up in the kitchen from all the scoot.

“Diana what do you think you’re doing?” a maid half wearing her uniform rushed down toward them.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The moment she saw the black figure beside her she grabbed an iron pike from the kitchen fireplace and threw it at him. “An intruder? Go call master!” Klara yelled.

“Wait that’s master!” Diana rushed to tell her as Cain easily grabbed the pike with [Telekinesis] that he wasn’t going to be killed by the maids twice in a single day.

Klara immediately recognized Cain when she saw him up close, “Did you play in a fireplace?” she asked him.

“No, I played in the bath heater, did the hot water reach you?” Cain asked.

“It did, why are you wasting precious resources on us?” Klara glared at him.

“I’m not wasting it, and this time it’s made with my magic.” Cain then explained everything to her.

“If that was the case, would you mind joining us at the bath? Even those who were at their rooms have gone in. beside Gracie of course.”

“Do you want the ladies to kill you?” Cain stared at her.

“Then ask them, it’s but a bath.” Klara was half right, Cain was supposed to have more contact with the maids, a simple bath wasn’t something that was out of the question.

“What worries me is that this is our marriage night, they are going to kill you.” Cain was serious, Selena might not mind but Sofia would boil the maids alive.

“Just ask them, you will be surprised,” Klara said with a smile.

~Alice, can you hear me~

~I can what is it~

~Klara is wanting me to take a bath with the maids, what do you all say~

~Did she already reach up to you? Today or tomorrow is, all the same, we five won’t mind even going a bit further~

~Hold up did you hit your head? Explain what you mean~

Cain couldn’t believe what he was hearing, he wanted to rush toward them to confirm.

~As simple as I can explain it, Marina is too shy to have us on her first night so you will be doing it with her and two of her maids as support. It won’t do to have maids from Ourals reach you before your own maids~

~You must be joking. Hey Sofia, Gracie, Selena, Marina what do you all say~ Cain immediately extended the call to the other girls to confirm Alice’s words.

~Can’t have outsiders before Lexi and the others~ Sofia said.

~The more the better, go for it-nya~ said, Selena.

~Leave some for me, I want snacks~ Gracie added.

~Sorry it’s my fault, please take it on me~ Marina cried.

~It’s not your fault Marina, it can’t be helped~ Cain replied to Marina less she start blaming herself.

~You heard them, enjoy~ Alice closed the call.

“What did they say?” Klara stared at him with an evil smile.

“This is ridiculous,” Cain said with an exhausted face.
