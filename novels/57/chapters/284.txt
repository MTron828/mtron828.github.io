“Snow has been piling up in the western mountain range. It caused multiple avalanches and many casualties. Due to that, we lot an important trade route which made us seek other longer routes, which made transporting goods more expensive.” The merchant explained and showed Cain a map.

“What did the Lord say about this?” Cain asked with a serious face. The western mountain range is not a place he wanted to set foot on for many reasons.

“He is the one who suggested changing the route until winter ends. He said that sending soldiers to such a place would only end up in them dying needlessly. We did ask the guild but not a single adventurer wanted to take the quest.” The merchant complained.

“I guess that referred to the silent snow quest disaster. I can understand why no one wants to take the risk. The circumstances are oddly similar, winter, snow, many monsters, and a blocked road.” Cain said as he clicked his tongue. Should he go alone to check the place, he would not want to take the girls to such a place.

“Master Cain, please don’t ever think of going alone. There is nothing more dangerous than the unknown.” Sebas cut them off. He gave Cain a sharp glare.

“I can just drop a meteor on the place. That has to clear it out.” Cain joked but Sebas took him seriously.

“There is a village at the mountain’s foot, you will bury them alive in a landslide.” Said Sebas.

“I was just joking. You take Mabel to her home with the carriage while I have a chat with our friend here.” Cain told Sebas.

“As you wish, I will return soon,” Sebas replied.

“Hey lads, give her what she asked for with a bonus. Don’t mind the payment just let her take them.” The merchant called his workers. He was more concerned about getting Cain to clear the problem than caring about momentary profit.

The silent snow quest. It’s probably the second big disaster in Furberg history other than the catastrophe itself.

The A-rank quest looked simple enough at the start. The road on the western mountain range is blocked by snow and monsters are terrorizing the roadside around the blockage. Exterminate the monsters and clear the road.

Seeing as the quest might take a lot of manual labor, multiple B-rank and A-rank parties were dispatched. Many of the adventurers took it as a vacation of sorts since they did not have to fear monsters with their numbers.

Then days went by without a single word from the expedition, as the guild grew worried and the city impatient about opening the road again. Then guild send a second search party to see how the expedition was going, hoping it might be just some heavy snowfall that delayed them.

What they found was horrendous. They found them encased in layer upon layer of ice and snow. Nothing much to say, frozen and wiped out. That sent the guild on high alert and they restricted the zone for that whole winter.

That is the main reason you cannot see other A-rank adventurers here besides dragon fang, they all were wiped out in that incident. Sadly, Cain’s foster parents were a part of that expedition.

Cain did want to investigate the place but he put it off to deal with the catastrophe, and then the urgent case of Fenrir village came in, and now the wedding. He really couldn’t find enough time to go check the place out.

“I understand the situation and I will try and find a solution in the near future, for now, I’m looking for something specific.” Cain changed the subject. The merchant’s eyes sparkled.

“What is it that I can help with?” Said the merchant.

“So to start with, I want to keep our conversation confidential. You know what will happen if it leaked out?” Cain glared at the merchant.

“Of course, what is said here stays here. Isn’t that the norm when dealing with nobles?” The merchant smiled. Nobles usually like their deals to stay in secret for many reasons. So other nobles won’t find out what they are up to, as well protect their privacy.

“Then let’s start with this, I want six gold rings with precious gems. If you couldn’t find that, I want gold and gems, I know a blacksmith who can make them for me.” Cain said with a serious face.

The merchant smiled, “I see, that’s a happy occasion. No wonder you want it to stay a secret. If people knew they will try and take the opportunity to take your favor.”

“That’s pretty much it, I want it to stay a secret until the last moment. It will be annoying to deal with all the people wanting to attend or bring unnecessary gifts.” Cain said with an exhausted smile remembering the list of wedding requests. If they knew he was going to marry, they are going to get even more desperate.

“Then I will get those ready right up, it will take a few days so are alright with that?” The merchant asked.

“I can wait a week or two, I’m not pressed on time that much,” Cain replied. He still had to deal with the waypoints and the church.

KNOCK! KNOCK! They suddenly heard a loud banging on the door, Cain immediately recognized who was outside.

“Fifty arms of rope, camping equipment, and travel rations. Wool clothes for me and…” The man who entered immediately stooped as he saw Cain sitting inside.

“I didn’t feel you?” Chad asked.

“What are you doing here father, is your head already healed?” Cain asked with an exhausted face.

The merchant froze in place, he didn’t expect that one in his life he could meet both the white mage and his father at the same time. Nobles would pay money for such an opportunity.

“I’m fine. I just wanted some travel equipment,” Chad replied as he sat on the counter.

“Are you leaving already, didn’t you want to stay until the wedding at least?” Cain asked with a hint of sadness.

“I’m not leaving. I just wanted to investigate the western mountains.” Chad replied immediately.

“Who told you about it? I’m not letting you go there.” Cain stood immediately, only that place was a no-go.

“I just going to have a walk,” Chad replied with a smile.

“If you want to go there then you must know what happened right? Whatever annihilated all of those A-rank adventurers is bound to be strong. Since it’s only attacked when intruding on its territory in winter, it’s probably for the best to leave it alone.” Cain said with a serious face.

“I know that we might have attacked its home, but you what I think about that?” Chad stared at Cain with a serious face.

“What?” Cain said carefully, he knew that his father had 20 intelligence so he should have a great reason in mind.

“Who cares? That thing killed your foster parents, the people who carried my responsibility when I was away. I don’t care about right or wrong, all I want is to bury that thing as he buried them.”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Upon hearing those words, it was then that Cain felt the bloodlust gushing from his father for the first time. His rage was different from other people. It was controlled. Most people bloodlust felt like a blazing flame or a raging river.

Chad’s rage felt like a deep ocean. It swallows everything silently, without discrimination about good or evil. Cain was grateful that it was him standing there and not someone else, using his own Mana he was able to hide his father’s blood lust. If the merchant had felt it, he won’t be able to breathe. Just like when the wind is knocked out of you after a fall.

“I will come with you then, you don’t mind right?” Cain asked with a worried face.

“I have no right to stop you, if you want to follow me then do so. I’m leaving tomorrow at dawn.” Chad stood up and glared at the merchant.

“Get everything I asked for ready, quickly.”

Cain sighed, now he had another chore in his hands. Luckily the western mountain wasn’t that far away for him.

“Please get me the same things, my butler will give you the details later.” Cain stood up and stretched his arms.

‘I should go through cold magic and how to counter it, this is going to be tough. I just hope it’s a monster that we’re dealing with.’ Cain walked outside thinking.
