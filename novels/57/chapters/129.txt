Sylph did like trees a lot, to her they were sacred as the offspring of the world tree Yggdrasil. Cain thought that her seeing the forced being defiled by Morena’s breath, seeing him at death door, the pain from the forced summoning, how the plans at the elvish kingdom could fail, and how long she will need to get back. Cain could easily imagine her going into a rage and going on a dragon-killing spree.

Alice quickly teleported toward Cain with Sofia to heal his wounds, Cain’s wounds were more severe than anyone else so she had to let Sofia wait.

As he was blacking out, he could feel familiar magic by his side other than Alice’s magic, it wasn’t that of Sylph, it felt similar to Sofia’s in some way. Sofia was unconscious and probably out of MP so it couldn’t be her Hot and crispy, like a sensation chili pepper.

Alice who suddenly felt the same presence froze in place. As she saw Morena’s crazed face race toward them, she thought they were dead. A pure white foot with curved red hot claws immediately connected to Morena’s face with a loud BANG!

“It’s been years, how come you’re still not dead?” Alice looked up to see who spoke, her eyes opened wide. Long flowing black hair and glowing green eyes, a pure white skin with small patches of scales. A rack bigger than her stepmother’s and thighs thicker than Selena’s. Wearing a black robe, she looked like the spitting image of an older Sofia with a more terrifying presence.

As Morena’s body went flying through the forest breaking one tree after the other, The woman turned toward Alice, Sofia, and Cain with a questioning face and enough heat that Alice found it hard to breathe.

Her gaze was fixed on Sofia for a second before quickly turning toward Alice and bearing her claws, “Heal her before I tear your neck off!” She spoke, even though her voice was similar to that of Sofia to a shocking degree.

Alice gathered all her courage to speak, “I can’t. His wounds are more severe, she Can hold up.” Hearing her response the woman frowned as she swung her claw down at Alice’s arm, Clap! She immediately stooped as Sofia caught her hand.

Sofia’s arm was broken and she was unconscious a moment ago, yet she still moved. The woman smirked at her, “I thought our smell was similar, but to think you could draw this much power when I’m still alive.” She stood up and looked at Alice, “Heal him quick and tend to her afterward, I would deal with my not-too-proud-off big sister.”

Cain who was just healed could see in front of him and he did apprise the woman who just appeared.

It was the Zaleria. The witch who enslaved him in his past life, was a dragon as well? Cain thought about it for a moment, Morena who is supposed to be Zaleria’s sister is a black dragon. They aren’t from the same race…That is leaving a lot of questions in his mind, especially since in his past life he was enslaved by a dragon witch and not a human. He had never suspected she was a dragon.

Now that he could see a portion of her stats, she is supposed to be the little sister, right? How come she is a complete seven levels above Morena and why does she looks this similar to Sofia? He did think they looked alike but thought it was just a small resemblance, now that they are side by side. Zaleria looks like an older Sofia with draconic claws and scales.

KABOOM! Lightly tapping the ground with her soles, Zaleria was blasted forward with a flame jet on her feet and with her draconic wings spread out. Leaving an ear-bursting creek in the air and a trail of fire.

“Kicking your older sister in the face, where are your manner?” Morena shouted with a smug face as she flew toward Zaleria with an acid slash.

Sizzle! The acid evaporated immediately as it encountered Zaleria’s flames. Thud! Morena took a step ahead and threw a round kick, Zaleria stepped back for a moment before grabbing the kick and smacking her sister to the ground. Each his caused the earth to shake, even though they looked human, each of them held the weight and power of her draconic body.

Morena grabbed Zaleria from the hair and swung her around at high speed, She was quickly faced by a fire explosion and kicked in the face.

As Alice scrambled to get Cain and Sofia out of the way, Selena came rushing to help her. They didn’t dare get close to the sister’s fight, the two were monsters. Selena looked behind, the two sisters were moving too fast for her to track. She didn’t have Cain’s appraisal but could guess their strength was well above 20 for them to move like that. If their body could handle such strain, her bite would only break her teeth.

Then the worst happened, Morena being pushed back had transformed to her draconic form. Zaleria has also followed her and they were two massive dragons brawling on the farm.

ROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! As the two massive monsters roared, Selena could feel her eardrum burst. She wasn’t alone as she could see blood coming from Alice, Cain, and Sofia’s ears as well.

For some time, it was just a fistfight with the earth shaking and cracking. It was as if two adults fought on a thin wooden floor and broke it. Then, even Selena who couldn’t feel magic could feel the intensity of what was about to clash.

Morena was charging her breath and Zaleria was doing the same, there wasn’t a 30 meter between their faces and they were going to use their strongest attack.

Cain tightly held Alice’s hand, and then grabbed Selena and Sofia with what little strength he had. Both Alice and Selena felt a sharp pain as Cain sucked their MP, [Mist Step] [Mist Step] [Mist Step] [Mist Step] [Mist Step] [Mist Step] [Mist Step] Cain teleported them as far as he could and by that time both Alice and Selena were in tears from having their MP drained. It felt like someone poking a needle through their bones.

It was the only way as Cain’s body was already beyond his limit and dry of MP, Sofia didn’t have that much either and the Mana in the air was being burned by the two fighting dragons.

As Alice and Selena looked back through their tear-filled eyes, they saw the forest being blown away by the clashing breathes.

Across from them on one hill, Dragon’s fang members were staring in terror at the dancing dragons. Yamauba seems to have managed to teleport them away. Isaac’s wife was with Leyla and some of the children’s starring as well from another location.

Seeing The massive red dragon punch the other massive black dragon from the sky to earth, and then dive headfirst after him. Chunks of ground and trees are flung over the mountain from the two monsters running around. The ground shook and trees crackled from the rumbling of their wings.

The black dragon has just grabbed the red one from its tail with a bite and slammed him on the ground causing a crack. The red dragon seemed unfazed as it punched the black one across the forest.

Everyone watching remembered Cain noping at the idea of facing a dragon at the guild. How he described dragons as being extreme and how they are the last thing he would fight. It was now clear how mad they are, a pure and infiltrated raw power and violence.

The dragon’s fang already made their mind to never take a quest with the word Dragon on it ever again. Selena and Alice have made a note to never question it when Cain tells them to not fight.

They just noticed that the red dragon fighting was the one they were supposed to chase away, Alice giggled. “Now I know why Cain freaked out, this morning.”

“Me too, I just expected them to be big flying lizards who could spit fire-nya!”

The two dragons kept fighting for a while until the forest was stomped to the ground.

The fight ended with the black dragon flying away, the red one seemed to stand in place victorious. Suddenly it turned and glared at Alice and Selena.
