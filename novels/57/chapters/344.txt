Marina looked at all the people in the ballroom, considering Cain’s strength, the only way they can face him is by winning his wife’s favor or getting a promise that can hurt him politically once broken.

In this world, there is only one thing that laws and politics have to uphold or they will suffer. It’s Chauntea’s decree and words, no king wants their kingdom to starve of a bad harvest.

‘I didn’t look that much into the guests’ background but I’m pretty sure most of them are nobles who own farmlands. “Alice, you’re a cleric so heal that man, please. I will speak in your stead to them.” Marina said as she glared at the guests.

“Pre-birth marriage and engagements are strictly forbidden in the words of our lord and savor Chauntea. I would expect all of you to pay compensation for the potential damage caused to our land because of such conversation.” Marina smiled. Cain didn’t have farms but she did, Alice’s family did as well, it wasn’t impossible that Chauntea will give them a bad harvest for such a conversation, she was extremely active after all.

“Hold up, that is unfair. You broke one of her rules just this morning!” One of the nobles yelled.

“We went to her church and asked her directly, we didn’t sneak around trying to hide it from her or talk it behind anyone’s back. If our lord and savor permitted Lord Cain to break one of her rules, what make you think she won’t take offense in this?” Marina said as she looked toward the honor guests’ room, in which there were two special people.

“She is right, what blasphemy is this? When did nobility fall from grace?” A man with a long white beard walked out..

“Wasn’t I just telling you, brother? We might have a drought this year!” Another man followed him.

The head priest of Ourals and the head priest of Furberg were both presents. In this world, the church held massive political power especially when the gods are active. Furberg priest has shared what happened in the secret engagement ritual with Ourals head priest as now both Churches see Cain and Chad as close to profits as they can.

William stared at Marina, ‘This girl knows how to use the power in her hand, she just married Cain and she is using his name to their advantage.’

“I do take my hand from anyone who started such conversations. I have people to care for and I don’t want them to starve.” William sighed as he walked toward the priests.

“A wise decision, my her Lordship washes all the sins from your just as much.” Furberg priest said with a smile.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“I was hoping this situation never gets this far, it’s not a good thing for anyone of our lord Chauntea got angry. Can I count on you in that matter?” Marina walked toward the Ourals priest with a smile.

“A generous donation to the farmers or a decrease in their taxes will do. Anything that helps the people work the land is bound to bring us a fortune. Lord Cain has already offered an amazing device, those waypoints will grant him our lord’s favor for years to come.” The priest said before starting to pray.

“You heard him, you don’t need to give us any compensation. Instead, direct those funds toward the farmer, your goal should be to avoid a bad harvest this year.” Marina said with a big smile. To the nobles, she sounded as if she was thinking about a way to help them. She didn’t ask them for a penny after all.

Only William could see behind her words, she was technically the lord of Ourals (Acting instead of Cain) any profit made from a great harvest is both Ourals and Furberg is bound to give Cain some benefit either through Alice or her.

William walked in clapping his hands, “This is enough, and less talk is always better. Make your action speak for themselves, for now, let’s continue the party.”

“Preferably without any forbidden topics this time.” Furberg’s priest said with a smile as he sat back to chat with a special guest. “Excuse me for cutting our conversation short earlier, young Miss Mabel. Let’s continue where we left…”

“Young miss, I told you I’m over seventy years old!” Mabel replied with a confused face.

Both Ourals’ priest and William looked at him with disappointed eyes.

Seeing as the situation has calmed down, Cain retreated with his wive
