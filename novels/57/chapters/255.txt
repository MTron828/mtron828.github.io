Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Shan suddenly found himself outside the village, he was certain it was not teleportation. Those spells had their unique feeling.

At that moment, the only thing he cared about was the red dragon standing in front of him.

“I let you go since we’re both dragons, do you never learn,” Shan growled at Zaleria. The stones on his back rumbled, this time he was getting ready to kill her if necessary.

Zaleria twisted her long neck, fire dripped from her nostrils as her scales glow red. Cain could hear her heart racing, a death threat was the biggest insult a dragon can receive and she was not taking it lightly.

“Flightless fat frog dragon like you dare speak like that to a red, even if we were levels apart. Do you really think I will go down without taking you with me?” Crimson flames burst from her scales yet Cain and the others were safe.

‘She is still calm.’ Cain thought, if she was really about to go crazy then they would have already burned to ash.

The earth dragon Shan burst laughing, “I haven’t heard such a word in a thousand years!” He then started stomping the ground.

“Shatter!” He suddenly yelled in anger.

Stone spikes rose from the ground underneath Zaleria and headed straight for her heart. Cain was about to cast [Prismatic dome] around her for protection when he noticed her heat rising.

A strong burst of flames emerged from her body and melted the spikes before they could reach her. “I have faced tougher stones, those are but mere wood.”

“Hold tight!” Cain screamed at Chad and Alen. Zaleria was about to charge at the earth dragon. For some reason, he could hear her thoughts and will. He know this kind of bond which surprised him. Even if it was probably just for that fight, she was considering him as her rider.

Zaleria’s wings flapped faster than that of a dragonfly, her titanic body moved at a speed that seemed impossible for her side. Jets of flames that came from her hind legs were what gave her that insane acceleration.

Seeing her charge at him, Shan turned and swung his club-like tail at her head. Zaleria quickly shifted her massive body, leaped above his swing, and flew to the sky.

Zaleria charged her breath and unleased it downward in a burst of hell, turning the whole mountain range into a furnace.

‘We have drawn so much attention from the dragons if I’m stuck in this kind of fight in less than three months from starting over.’ Cain thought as he started preparing his magic. When he looked at Alen, the old man was zoning out in shock.

Cain slapped Alen’s back, “Wake up, we’re still in the middle of a fight.” Alen quickly jumped.

Cain was used to seeing such hellish scenes but Alen was not. Even though Alen was the guild master and an S-rank adventure, he was still only level 21 and barely gazed at the monsters that live in the world.

Humans, dwarves, and Halflings created the adventure guild. Its purpose was to train people to fight the strong monster and protect their society. The whole concept of adventuring was those three races trying to discover the unknown world around them.

A lot of scholars have researched the reasons why strong races such as high elves, dragons, and even the titans didn’t bully humans, dwarves, and halflings like they did to other races.

High elves were known to be avid slavers. Dragons used other races as test subjects while titans only saw the lower races as potential food. Yet they never directly laid a hand on those three races. The reason was simple.

Dwarves were masters of their craft and their weapons and creation were priceless. That reputation made the whole world see them as a race that must be kept in peace so they can work.

Halflings were excellent alchemists so their existence was important.

Humans on the other hand were a bit special. They had the amazing ability to bear children with all other races. They were kept for the sake of preserving the other races.

For those reasons, they have never been pulled into the bigger conflicts of the world. Alen now was seeing the truth of the world for the first time. He who had thought that he was strong, is now seeing two real monsters clash.

Suddenly Cain noticed his father jumping from Zaleria’s back as if he was diving.

Shan who has just blocked Zaleria’s breath was trying to shake the charred dust from his head. He shook his head from left, to right and then back to left. Slash! [Destructive wave: Fire blast] Chad who was just falling slashed Shan’s soft eye and charred the inside.

Shan growled in agony, he didn’t see Chad coming and had paid the price. Cain was amazed by his father’s performance. That ability to see a little bit into the future was making him able to hit at crucial times.

Shan swung his claw at still-falling Chad. Thud! Zaleria caught the strike and Cain flew in and grabbed his father.

“W-what were you thinking about!” Alen yelled at Cain’s father. Chad completely ignored him.

“Nicely done, that was amazing!” Cain yelled. He was honestly impressed by his father’s performance even though he was just level 20.

“We need to move, I heard her bone crack,” Chad said menacingly. Zaleria won’t hold for much longer.

Cain immediately stood up and rushed toward her head. “He is already hot from your breath. Cool him quickly so his shell will crack.” Cain whispered in her ear.

“Alice keeps on healing her,” Cain told Alice who was in his shadow. ~I’m already doing that~

He was running low on MP and wanted to use what remained in him to cast [Imprisonment]

Zaleria smiled as she understood what Cain meant, not many people knew those fire dragons could freeze things. They hide a trump card.

It was now all up to luck if the earth dragon had fought other red dragons or not. Zaleria was ready to give it a try.

She opened her jaw wide and was about to suck all the heat from him when he growled.

“Trying to freeze me? In your dreams!” The earth dragon Shan screamed. He knew about that trick and was about to counter with his breath.

Flash! A jet-black orb flew toward the earth dragon’s face. [Demon Blade: Ashura’s Rampage] Kayden who now had a total of four arms, each holding a blade, swung at the earth dragon. Twelve simultaneous strikes were enough to leave a scare at the dragon’s nose.

[Sorry for being late, I had to ask a friend for help.] Alice heard a voice that she did hear for a long time. Cain was also able to hear her voice. He looked at the sky and it was in an eclipse.

“What are you, what do you want and why did you appear now of all times.” Unlike Alice who was awestruck by her goddess. Cain was on fire, “If you could have helped you should have done so from the start. And why did you go silent after jack’s incident?”

[Mortal know…]Amaterasu was about to speak.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Stop the bullshit! I know that you gods don’t even care about that. What is going on up there?” Cain yelled at her. ~Cain, be respectful, she is a goddess~ Alice told him with a scared voice.

Amaterasu started laughing, [But you already know, do you really need me to spell it for you?]

Cain tried to rack his brain, he was occupied by preparing the [Imprisonment] spell that he couldn’t think properly.

“Just say it!” Cain didn’t care anymore.

[Those things have already killed their god. They are aiming for us next and we know they have a chance of doing it.] Amaterasu said. The gods were scared of the dragons’ potential.
