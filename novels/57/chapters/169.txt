Sofia looked at Cain for a moment, what was she going to say. Zaleria had told her to be clear in her will and order which she could barely get the hang of. ‘I have to sound confident, will yelling my order be enough?’

“I will return him to your control when you’re ready, don’t take too long,” Zaleria said, as she sat to watch.

“Release him,” Sofia said as she had thought about what she had to say, She should be able to handle it just fine.

“Here…you…GO!” Zaleria released him. Cain now being again under the effect of Sofia’s charisma, has returned to his rampaging state. Unlike Zaleria who could calm him down with just her presence, Sofia was still amateur so even controlling him with verbal orders was uncertain.

Seeing him rush at her, she flinched backward. “SIT!” She screamed but it was ineffective, she was still scared by him rushing at her that her words were trembling.

Sofia was immediately pinned down by him, she couldn’t understand why he wasn’t listening. “Calm down!” Alice and Sofia grabbed him from the shoulders and pulled him away. Cain’s will seemed to have stopped affecting Alice thanks to Zaleria being there.

“Doesn’t stop, you jump him!” Alice told her. “We’re holding him down so start now, do it as best as you can!”

Sofia looked at them and then at Cain, “What?”

“Tell him to stop, ride him or anything. Take the initiative!” Alice seemed to be on something. charisma does follow the person’s will, so someone who acts dominant will dominate and who acts submissive will be subdued.

“I will show her-nya, Let me have a go-nya!” Alice moved away from Cain as she heard Selena’s words.

At that moment. Selena grabbed Cain from his ankles and twisted him around, pinning him on the bed. “You can’t beat me-nya!” She was right, Selena was in a whole other league in strength than Cain. Without the use of weapons or magic, he can’t even scratch her.

She grabbed both his wrists in one hand and sat on top of his hip. His legs started to thrash around so she used her other hand to pin his knees in one place. At that time she was sitting sideways on him.

“This an awkward position-nya! But it doesn’t matter anyway-nya!” She immediately took him inside her and started moving rapidly, “Do you like this-nya!” She moaned and looked at his face.

Cain’s eyes were still fixed on Sofia, Even though Selena was riding him, he didn’t care about her and kept struggling. A line formed on Selena’s forehead as her ears tilted backward. “Where are you looking-shaa!”

Her tail swung rapidly and wrapped around his knees to hold them in place and free her hand. she turned to face him and used both her hands to pin his arms. one arm on each side. And lastly using both of her feet she fixed his face toward her, “Look at me-nya!”

“Don’t move! Calm down! Look at her!…” Sofia then took her time trying to yell orders at him while Selena had her fun but there was no result. It was as if he was immune to her words.

Zaleria sighed, Sofia was on the right way but she didn’t seem to believe what she was saying. Even though she yelled at Cain to obey her, deep in her heart she couldn’t imagine herself ordering him. When she noticed that Selena had finished a round, Zaleria walked to them again.

“Listen, You have to mean it. If you hesitated, it won’t work.” She slapped Sofia on her back, it made a loud painful sound. Sofia twisted, a red mark was left burning on her back. She groaned, catching her breath.

“AAAhhhhh!” Sofia took a deep breath to calm herself down, it wasn’t time to complain about Zaleria hitting her back. Cain was still struggling under Selena, his leg accidentally slammed into Sofia’s thigh as she was trying to collect her thoughts.

“Can you please give me a moment?” She unconsciously said to him and he stopped. Selena Though she might have squeezed him a bit too hard, “Alice, Heal him-nya!” She cried immediately.

Zaleria smiled seeing that, ‘I might be able to use sheer force to charm him but to think even in those conditions he only responded when asked nicely, is it his will or he is just different?’

“He responded, look!” Zaleria poked Sofia on the shoulder and showed her Cain laying calm.

Sofia quickly turned her head to look at him, she poked his stomach “This isn’t your doing right?”

“No, this is you’re. I seem to have been mistaken, try to nicely ask to do something.”

Sofia looked at him and thought about what to say, “Would you mind sitting up?”

Hearing her Cain quickly sat in front of her. Zaleria was able to forcibly control him since she has 23 charisma. But for Sofia, he was more accepting of her so he will respond as long as she ask nicely.

“Remember to release quickly, keeping his under the charm for too long will harm can harm his mind.” Zaleria walked to the couch and started wearing her clothes, her job was done the moment Sofia managed to show some control over her charisma.

“Congratulation my lady, you seem to have succeeded.” Gracie congratulated her.

After Zaleria left. Sofia, Alice, Selena, and Gracie were left with Cain to play. Alice’s eyes sparkled as she thought about Cain being under their control even for a short while. “Sofia, Sofia, Can we order him as well?” She grabbed her shoulder with pleading eyes.

“His face looks weird-nya!” Selena said as she inspected Cain’s face, his face was relaxed as if he was sleepwalking.

“Please lay down,” Sofia ordered him and he did so, She was screaming inside from joy to the point she didn’t know where to start.

Alice quickly started doing her things, sitting on his face like it was nothing. “Ask him to lick me!” She said with sparkling eyes.

That wasn’t something that she has ever thought of doing, sitting on his face seemed too disrespectful for her to accept.

“Cain please wake up.” Sofia was thrilled at the chance of having Cain do her bidding but she wasn’t ready to face what he has to say if she allowed Alice to sit on his face like this. She expected to be quite furious at such a degenerate act.

Cain slowly opened his eyes feeling something wet on his nose, [Sylph’s tiny hut] He immediately cast the spell to protect him from Sofia’s charm. He can’t see Sofia yet but she must be close so he wanted to give them a chance to talk.

‘Now what is this thing on my face? Why I’m thinking, I know it’s a bum. Even though it’s right on my face I’m not charmed so it doesn’t belong to Sofia, it’s soft so it doesn’t belong to Selena either.’

“Alice, Why are you sitting on my face?” He asked, it was almost immediate that Alice was just trying to jump away from his face.

“Stop!” His order made her freeze in place, she was under his bidding after all so she couldn’t run.

Cain lifted her slightly and looked ahead to see Sofia’s worried face. “Care to explain what happened?” His voice didn’t seem angry but considering the mess they have made, it was normal for him to be angry. Sofia recited what happened to him, while she was doing so, he was licking Alice, with each stroke from his tongue her body writhed and wiggled.

“So Zaleria had to come? She didn’t do anything to me, right?” No, she didn’t even touch you, she only used her charm on you.

Cain sighed in relief, It was nice that Zaleria didn’t put him under some weird spell. He knows she could have taken this chance to do something.

He then pushed Alice away and laid her on the bed. “You two also come to her side.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Sofia and Selena then lay by her side, keeping a shoulder to a shoulder. “Are alright-nya?” Selena finally spoke, she didn’t want to interrupt Sofia’s complicated explanation earlier.

“I’m fine, Albeit a bit exhausted. Gracie, bring me a cup of water and added the usual, be generous.” Hearing his words the girls flushed red, what was awaiting them if he had asked for that.

Gracie immediately brought him a cup of water with a generous amount of her saliva. “How did you feel watching them?” Cain asked her.

“I don’t know, I remembered some things I wished to forget. It was unpleasant but I somehow found it interesting.” Her reply was what he hoped for, she at least felt something. “Is that so? Next time when feeling such a thing ask if you can leave, that will help you feel better. You said it yourself, it was unpleasant and you shouldn’t let yourself feel such a feeling.”

“I understand.”

Cain waited for her to as him if she can leave but she stayed silent. “Do you want to leave? We’re going to start again.” He told her in case she didn’t catch up.

“I want to watch, I’m not allowed that?” She replied shocking Cain. He couldn’t comprehend the train of her thoughts.

“Fine, you can watch.” He said turning toward the girls. The evil grin on his face sent chill down their spins.

“I’m sorry…” Said Alice regretting what she dared to do.

“Please be gentle.” Said Sofia moving her blushed face, each time she saw his face she remembered how hard he was going at her earlier.

“Bring it on-nya!” Selena was lifting her legs and inviting him in, “Don’t hold back-nya!” She was hoping to have him crazy at her like he did Sofia earlier.

The night after that was long, The girls barely found time to rest.
