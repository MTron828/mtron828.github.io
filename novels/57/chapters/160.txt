Alice looked at Cain, her eyes glowing. The maids behind him froze. They felt her looking at their souls. “I was mistaken all this time. I don’t need to mix them as they are already the same thing!” She said with a distant look in her eyes. ‘Her curse and holy magic?’ He though.

“What do you mean by they are the same?” Cain asked to confirm what she was thinking.

Alice took a sip from her tea, “I was unconsciously treating them as different types of magic while they are the same to me. You can wound people by healing them and Can heal people by wounding them, it all boils down to how I use it.”

“Then let’s see how well you do in training later. If you can use both at the same time I will start teaching you a lot of spells in both types.” Cain said, quickly noticing Sofia’s sparkling eyes. She was anticipating her leveling up as well, sadly she can’t right now.

“Sorry but raising your Charisma even higher will be bad for everyone, especially since you can’t control as well as Zaleria.”

Sofia frowned a line crossing her forehead, “But I want it…”

“Don’t worry, I will try to find a solution quickly. We might need Zaleria to teach you how to use your charisma since it’s her specialty.” Cain looked at the door where Sebas has just entered, “Master, Lord Leon is outside requesting to see you.”

“It seems that we’re out of time, congratulation on leveling up. I will see you after I finished discussing some things with him.” Cain stood patting each one of them on the head.

“Hold up, It’s better to have me at your side,” Alice said standing up, “I’m just going to talk with Leon over some things, there is no need for you to neglect your training for it,” Cain said with a gentle smile, she must be excited to use her new idea and he didn’t want to hold her back.

“It might seem strange but I think it’s better to have more people when negotiating. I can’t imagine my brother giving you trouble when I’m sitting by your side.” Alice walked to his side, Cain kept looking at her, she had a different air around her.

“Fine, If it doesn’t bother you. Sofia you wait for Zaleria and train with her on your charisma, and you join them for some combat training. Gracie has her regular work, so don’t bother her too much.” After giving his instruction, he turned toward Mary. “If you can register us at the guild with the levels you just heard, I think you know why we won’t use an appraisal orb.” Hearing his words she nodded, now that she knew Alice was a devil, asking her to use an appraisal orb was like starting a war with the whole country. If she was a mere Demon or an Oni it wouldn’t be a problem but a Devil is more problematic with the church.

‘Now that I think of it, wasn’t Alice a healer? She did get into the church normally didn’t she?’ Upon this realization a cold sweat dripped from her back, Alice was more than just a devil, she was something greater.

Mary watched the two of them exit after Sebas, what has she gotten herself into. “I wanna go home!” She cried and Sofia got surprised, “What’s wrong with you?” She asked the shriveling Mary. “I just wanted to do my job as a representative perfectly and I ended in this mess, I want to go home!”

…

They did the meeting in Sebas’s office, the old butler prepared a large table in the middle of the room which can hold up to six people. Cain, Alice, and Sebas sat on one side while Leon, The city’s armed force general, and the lord’s accountant sat facing them.

Sebas was nervous seeing the two people Leon brought with him, he intended to make a deal and has brought the experts.

“Shall we start? Where is the product I heard about from you?” Leon looked at Sebas, “They are here,” Sebas stood to bring the potions but he suddenly heard Alice. “Sit down, let’s talk first.” She stopped him in track, her eyes looked up at her brother.

“It’s been a while since we haven’t seen each other, let’s chat a bit.” She said with a gentle and innocent smile.

‘Not letting them take the lead, nice.’ Cain was glad he she wanted to come, now that they have both 20 wisdom and 20 intelligence It will be near impossible for Leon to get one on them.

“She is right, this is my house. It won’t do if I don’t show some hospitality first.” Cain said signaling for Sebas to bring them tea and some snacks.

“Then how you’ve been? Father has been worried about you those past days.” Leon asked, trying to sound as friendly as he could. Even if she was his beloved sister this stole a big deal. If Sebas was telling him the truth about the petrifying potions then it will be a game-changer in the coming war.

“I’ve been as healthy as you see,” Alice pumped her arm to show off her non-existing muscles, “But yesterday I was feeling a bit off, I might have caught a cold.” Cain knew nothing of what she was talking about, he might need to refrain from opening his mouth for a while.

“Is that right? Should I ask for medicine to be prepared?” Leon returned to his usual overprotective self the moment Alice’s health was brought up.

“No need, I seem to be getting better slowly. Staying at the gate yesterday has gotten to me a bit.” She shook her head as if regretting something.

“Gate?” Leon looked at her with a sharp eye, “The city gate, the guards stopped at the morning and we had to wait for a while. I hope they could recognize me better.” Leon immediately gave a sharp glare at the armed force general.

“Tell, your, troops, to recognize her better!” A small vein popped on his forehead, Alice hid a faint smile and Cain laughed slightly. The armed force general shrugged at being under the lord’s son’s anger so suddenly.

‘She is breaking them apart, as expected from a devil. With her reaching 20 wisdom she is now aware of her ability to manipulate people with their emotions.’ Intelligence will help you argue with benefits and logic, Charisma will help you intimidate and Wisdom will help you manipulate people’s emotions and toy with their hearts.

“Please brother, it’s in the past now. I got over it easily after some rest.” She quickly turned the conversation to Cain. “Cain also seems to be recovering well, It’s just a bit bothering that we can’t get quests.”

“She is right, we kinda need to work to pay the day-to-day expenses. Why did William prevent us from taking quests?” Cain took the chance to talk about it. Alice has set him nicely.

“I don’t really know, my father said that you two need to rest and recover. He knew that you might act reckless and take on quests so he asked the guild not to let you take quests.”

Sebas came back with the tea just as they were about to start talking about the deal.
