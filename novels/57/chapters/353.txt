Back at Cain’s magnificent mansion. The maid wore their uniforms at his orders. They looked better in it he said.

“Then please allow me to go first,” Lexi approached Cain with nervousness, they had agreed before that she was going to be the first.

As she didn’t know where to start, she decided to copy what she saw Sofia does last time. Cain had said that she resembled her before.

Yet as soon as she got close it was clear to her, how could Sofia keep this thing in her mouth? Lexi tried to push her limit but she wasn’t able to even reach the middle.

Cain was a bit disappointed, to be honest, he had been spoiled with Sofia’s inhuman skills to the point something like this we’re no more than mild in his eyes. Yet he tried his best not to show it, as if was for him, they were in it too.

Surprisingly, even though they were told to wait. Elise and Diana were quick to catch on to Lexi’s struggle and joined her. In a moment Cain had three mouths on him.

The three maids quickly cached to their only strength against him, numbers. Without much hesitation, they started going to their limits.

Lexi pushes as deep as she could, and when she gets tired she sends it to Diana, Who then gives it to Elise who returns it to Lexi and repeats it..

This rotating combo was slowly getting to him, as he finally reached his limit. Cain grabbed Lexi’s head and emptied what he has in her mouth, even if that was too much for her to take so she spat it to the bedside.

“Sorry…” Cain tried to apologize but Lexi stopped him. She quickly pushed the two at him while she was to take a rest.

As the two girls stared at Cain waiting for him to pick one, he quickly grabbed Diana and laid her on her stomach.

As he caressed her backside, he slowly revealed it by lifting her skirt. It looked even bigger up close. Cain then quickly removed her underwear and started going crazy with his fingers.

Her mountains were too large they could almost hide his whole hand, or she was simply that soft, it didn’t matter to Cain what the difference was because she quickly started dripping.

Cain started slowly pushing inside her, she groaned as the appearance was deceiving, she didn’t have that much space inside.

“Are alright?” Cain asked.

“I am fine, please go deeper…” She groaned.

Cain could feel that he was stuck, the only way he could push deeper was to grab her hips and use his strength to force it inside.

“AHH! That’s it…just…give me a moment!” Diana said as he wanted to take a deep breath, she was feeling like something was tickling the inside of her ear. Cain could see her shudders on her own.

As she was taking her time to get used to him, Cain was staring at her pink back end, it was a shame not to be used as well. With that in mind, he ran two fingers inside and started twirling them causing her body to twitch at it reached a sudden climax.

“Please starts to move, slowly…” Diana moaned as she swallowed the surging feelings.

Cain started moving as both Lexi and Elise approached him for kisses. His hands quickly found rest inside their underwear squeezing the peaches.

Soon enough, and without neither him nor Diana realizing, he was going as fast as he could. It didn’t take long for Cain to finish inside her, by that time had completely forgotten about wanting to use the second hole and went straight for Lexi.

Unlike Diana, Lexi grabbed Cain with a big hug as her legs pushed him inside her. Cain couldn’t even pull out easily because of that.

“Can you…” Before he could finish speaking, Lexi went for a kiss that she never intended to end. All Cain could do from that point was slowly grind her inside while keeping their lips locked.

By the time Cain was done with her, she was twitching in her place with a big smile on her face.

It was then Elise’s turn, she has already taken her uniform out and was on all four.

Cain didn’t go straight for her, he still had some business with those cow legs of her. Her legs were long and boasted a medium thickness that complimented them. If Diana has spent everything on her rear end, Elise did spend everything on her legs.

Cain grabbed her tights tightly and she started pushing against him. He immediately went and was surprised by the pressure those thighs could produce. They were nothing compared to what Selena could provide but in all fairness, she will snap his meat in half just without trying.

Elsie suddenly tried to stand and grabbed Cain’s hands putting them on her chest. “Go harder.” She whispered.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Going by her will, Cain increased his speed a bit, he was already going pretty fast.

After a few seconds, Cain noticed that Elise was swinging her his as well to increase the speed. With her legs, she was able to achieve a power comparable to Cain’s thrusts.

“Harder! Harder!” She kept moaning, Cain was confused if she wanted him to go harder or if she was just saying it.

Eventually, Cain gave up and pounded her until she got tender and melted.

Still feeling energetic, Cain looked toward Lexi for the second round but she was still out. That was the case for Diana as well.

It was then when Cain noticed their biggest shortcoming, they had low stamina compared to him, and there was no way they could satisfy him as his wives do.

Sighing in disappointment, Cain walked out of the room toward the bath and brought a bowl of water and a clean towel. He used it to clean both himself and the girls, they were too exhausted to move after all.

‘I shouldn’t do it with just maids again, it’s a bit lacking.’ Cain thought, he needed one of his wives to be present since they are the only ones who could take him fully.

It was already a bit late, Cain grabbed a blanket and covered the girls, cuddled between them, and went to sleep.

Cain woke in the middle of the night to Elise kicking his side in her sleep. Even that hit was somewhat painful, ‘It’s just a one-time thing’ he thought and went back to sleep.

The next thing, he woke up unable to breathe, a big soft thing was suffocating him. Exhausted, Cain quickly pushed Diana’s massive rear end from his face and went back to sleep hugging Lexi like a pillow.

The morning came and Cain woke them up to Lexi using her mouth on him like it was normal.

“What are you doing?” Cain asked, even Sofia didn’t do that this early in the morning.

“It was big so I thought it needed some care,” Lexi replied.

“They call it morning wood, and it’s not for use.” Cain quickly pulled out from her mouth and stretched his arms. The windows were indicating it was morning since they were glowing brightly, which meant they might be a bit late.

“Already going up?” Diana asked scratching her eyes.

“Yeah, it’s already morning,” Cain replied.

It wasn’t the amazing night he expected but it was enough.
