Leon and Cain each went their separate ways! Leon was to inform his father about what Jack did and Cain was to start working on Alice.

“You, come here!” Leon called one of the maids that were still awake and gave her a pendant of his.

The maid looked at him in confusion, staring at Cain who was just standing behind him.

“Listen, Follow whatever he says, and assist him in every way you can! when you meet other maids tell them to follow the same order! Here is my necklace to prove the order!” Leon ordered her to obey Cain’s orders, his face was serious unlike when he was joking in front of Alice!

“But Young master…”

“No buts!! Just follow the order!” Leon’s scream scared the hell out of her, her face turned pale looking at his crackling eyes. She quickly bowed slightly and replied, “As you order!”

Leon left immediately to tell his father leaving Cain and the maid alone.

The maid’s legs were shaking, Cain obviously couldn’t know but this was the first time Leon yelled seriously at one of the maids, he usually respects them a lot!

“You know, he isn’t angry at you so don’t be scared!” It was going to be a problem if she was terrified all the time so Cain tried to comfort her a bit! “Simply putting it, Jack did something really bad and I’m here to help Leon and Lord William deal with the situation!” Cain gave her a vague explanation.

“So…How should I call you?” She was a bit scared of Cain, there was a rumor going around that lord William had a group of assassins working for him to clear rival nobles. Cain perfectly fits the description.

Cain thought about it for a moment, probably he shouldn’t use his real name? No, he had already taken his mask so it was pointless! There wasn’t anyone beside him with white hair in this whole city!

“Just Cain is enough, let’s hurry toward Alice’s room!” Cain started rushing toward Alice’s room and the maid followed behind him, each time someone sees them she just shows Leon’s pendant and says “We’re at work, please excuse us!”

Daraku who was still hiding in the shadow was asking himself, ‘Things escalated quickly! What happened to the cool stealth mission?’ Eventually, he decided to stay in hiding and keep an eye on Jack. The moment he shows up, Daraku will attack him!

Alice’s two maids were waiting at the door as always when they saw Cain come rushing with the maid behind him. “Stop, this room is off-limit for anyone besides Young master Leon and Master William!” The maid shouted.

Cain’s maid just showed them the pendant, “We’re here on Young Master Leon’s orders! Let us in!” Seeing the pendant they hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“Let us get the Young lady’s permission first!” One of them entered the room, she quickly got back out with a weird look on her face.

“She said to follow the white-haired guy’s orders!” Letting the door open for them, “Please get in, she is waiting for you!”

Inside Cain was happy the mission was going well, even though this whole Commotion was never accounted for, It least meant he was building a good relationship with the lords family as well! This will be a good way to get them to prepare early for the catastrophe!

Cain quickly entered the room, Asking the maids to wait outside for him! They didn’t seem very keen on that so he allowed them in.

“Don’t interfere! This is a direct order!” Alice gave her order, making the maids sit and watch!

“I’m going to start, are you okay with this?” Cain asked, taking Alice’s consent for the procedure one last time! The Change was permanent and he didn’t want her to regret it one day!

After getting the confirmation Cain immediately started working, Jack is bound to feel the spell activate again as he was the first caster! The moment Cain starts working on Alice, Jack will start moving and he won’t be happy at all!

Cain pulled the two bottles that contain the pain killer and the sedative he put them on the small table beside Alice.

[Second-tier Magic: [Marlin’s floating platform] Have been added to the system]

With a single flicker of his hands, a floating rectangular platform, 7 feet in length and 4 in width appeared beside Alice’s bed!

The maids were both confused and in awe as this was the first time they saw magic like that! It looked majestic, at least more than anyone else they saw!

Cain then proceeded to lift Alice’s bedsheet, she was naked under it so you can say he stripped her! The maids were furious lashing at him the moment they saw him touch Alice’s body.

“Stay put! Don’t you dare interfere!” Alice shouted at the top of her lungs, This was what she asked for, and they aren’t going to stop it!

Cain who didn’t seem to care about the maid’s reaction healed Alice with a [Lesser healing] as she seems to have damaged her throat again.

“I don’t care about what you say about me, but if you made her scream again…” Cain’s sharp glare and bloodlust were enough to scare the maids into submission, It was understandable as they weren’t fighters who could resist their fear! To them looking in Cain’s eyes and staying calm was like asking a person not to freak out when a wild beast appear in front of them!

Cain then put Alice slowly on the platform he just created, Since Alice’s body was going to transform it would be better to not put her on regular material as she might mix with them! Shortly, the bedsheet for example might end up sinking into her back as she transforms!

“Let’s start! Tell me if you felt pain or not!” Cain slightly pinched one of Alice’s wounds.

“It hurts.” She replied with just what Cain needed, she didn’t want to complicate things so she decided to just speak with what he asked her.

Cain took one of the bottles he brought with him, The painkiller one! “Sorry but since it needs to be absorbed quickly I have to get it in the other way!”

Alice seemed to understand what meant and she just replied “Do however you see fit!”

Simply, It usually takes a full day for the body to absorb the painkiller, at that time the patient will experience a slow pain decrease until he felt non! Cain firstly intended to make her drink the pain killer today and do the transformation tomorrow. Now that they were hurried up before the clash with Jack he had to do it the other way around as it will be absorbed immediately!

Hearing her response, Cain lifted one of her legs to get access to her back end, he emptied the whole bottle inside before checking that she wasn’t leaking it back!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Seeing what he was doing the maids had this urge to intervene but couldn’t move a muscle as Cain was releasing his killing intent toward them! If they moved they would die!

To explain what killing intent is! It’s just a form of naturally released Mana! If a human was a stove, the killing intent was the heat he released and magic was the flames! Since Cain had an absurdly high reserve of Mana, he was like a flame thrower and the maids were like candles! Just the heat released by him is enough to melt them!

Cain then put Alice on her back again. how do you feel? She replied with a bit of a sad voice. “I won’t lie, it felt creepy and cold!” Hearing her Cain giggled a bit.

In the meantime, as he waited for the painkiller to take effect, Cain prepared the cursed object. What he did was simple, cut Jack’s Magic and make it his own! That task was almost impossible for anyone beside him! In his past life, he was known as the greatest enchanter in history so taking care of the magic enchanted on it was easy.

As he finished that, he proceeded to pinch Alice again!

“I don’t feel anything…” Alice suddenly started crying, for the first time in more than 15 years, she finally wasn’t in pain!

Cain gently wiped her tears, “Get ready, It’s the second potion to put you to sleep!” Time was priceless, Jack should already be on his way here!

“Would you need to shove…” Cain stopped her before she could finish.

“No, you just need to drink it! It’s quicker to take effect!” Cain helped her drink the bottle. It tasted horrible to the point Alice almost puked it up!

Slowly but surely, she fell asleep holding Cain’s hands.

Cain’s signal that she was fully sedated came quickly, he used the bedsheet to wipe her clean!

Cain then used his Dagger to slash his fingers and paint something on Alice’s body, which was the first step to the biding spell, some of the caster’s blood!

Taking a deep breath Cain resolved himself. This was going to hurt him.

“Wait! Take this!” Daraku appeared in the window and threw two MP potions at Cain.

Cain didn’t expect that but it was an appreciated help! With it, he could heal himself when he will get the backlash!

“Thanks, make sure to protect us well!” Cain told him as he started.

[Seventh-tier Magic [Devil Calling] is being used, a severe backlash will be given due to the weak body!]

The tremendous amount of Mana discharged by Cain was enough to make the maids faint and even alert every single mage in the whole city!

His shirt got easily disintegrated as multiple magic circles covered the room! The eldritch glow seeped from his fingertips and directly onto Alice’s body!

It was starting!
