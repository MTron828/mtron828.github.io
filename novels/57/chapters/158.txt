“So, why didn’t you stop them?” Cain started, “I believe you know how bad it will be.” He leaned back on his arms, giving her a slight unhappy gaze.

“You didn’t oppose at the moment.” She replied without waiting, she had nothing else to say. If they were about to enter and Cain didn’t stop them then she had no place butting in.

“Fine, from now on. Things like this need my verbal approval. I don’t care if they are a random person or the king, you tell them to wait outside.” Cain thought about it for a moment looking at the flames flickering behind them. ‘With the way, Gracie thinks that might be bad, it will be best to avoid unwanted conflicts. “Avoid fights when you do so.”

“I understand, what about people who got in before?” She asked tilting her head slightly to the side. Selena was getting a bit restless beside Cain and she was curling around his waist.

“Unless they have been with us for some time, don’t allow it. I would much prefer a maid than a stranger for example.” Cain pat Selena on the head to calm her down.

“I understand,” Gracie replied standing up, she was trying to give the two of them some space.

“Wait,” Cain called her and she stopped in place. “Do you think you deserve punishment?”

Gracie turned slowly to face him, “I do.” She replied without much of a reaction.

“Why do you think that?” He asked. It was best to use this situation to assess her emotional improvement.

“I was ordered to not let anyone in, and I did.” Cain gave her a look of concern. It was strange for her to not try and shift the blame to him, any normal person would say that they are innocent and don’t deserve punishment.

“That wasn’t the answer I expected. We two are exhausted so your punishment is to give us both a massage.” Cain sighed before contention, “Next time you make a big mistake I want you to think of a way to avoid punishment,” Cain want her to show some character and act as a normal person would do.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Cain, can we start-nya!” Selena was clearly on her limit, she can hold it pretty well normally but when in the bed she seems to get a bit restless. She was already in heat which seemed to be a trait special to beast people. Unlike humans who can get in the mood with the slightest stimulation, beast people need special conditions and for Selena, it’s been in the bed with Cain or him making an advancement at her. That would explain her calm attitude in the bath before.

That night Gracie had to spend it with them, giving them a massage between each session. Each time Cain stole a glance at Gracie to see if her expression changed, being with them doing it must have made her feel something at least but she seemed to not move an inch when not asked. ‘Come on, get angry or horny. Show something, even asking to leave would be an improvement.’ Cain was getting more concerned about her emotions, he had no idea what was going on in her mind and if there was an actual improvement.

“Hey, can I ask how you feel?” Cain said after laying Selena on the bed, she had a satisfied look on her face and glanced at them in a daze.

“What do you mean?” Gracie asked.

“The only time I saw your show emotions was on our first day when Sofia asked you to strip. I just wanted to know how you feel and if there is an improvement?” Cain knew he was going extremely soft on her compared to the experiments the dragons did, he wondered if this teasing was enough stimulation to even make her feel something.

The experiments of the dragons on madness consisted of multiple inhuman methods meant to extract the deepest of humans’ physiological structure. Such things included names like:

Timed death: Telling the subject of when they will die and how to see how they will act.

Mental trauma: If someone has a fear of spiders, for example, they will throw him in a room full of them. For Gracie, they might throw her in a room full of incubuses.

Changed memory nightmare: Making a person relive the happiest part of their life in a dream and then change it into a torturous scene to see if they will snap.

Happy mad nightmare. Having someone fall into a weird nightmare while injecting them with weird hormones and drugs to see what happened.

The goal of that all was to find a way to create custom-made madness, the dragons wanted to make their strongest go mad with power. That was the only way for them to perfect their unbeatable existence and avoid the influence of gods. It was just like hyper-focusing themselves on one thing.

Now the problem was that Gracie was already fragile and Cain didn’t have the tools or heart to put her under the test. The first thing the dragons did to him was, force him to face his trauma over and over and them erasing his memory of that to see if he will stay sane and get some data on him. For him, it was reliving the catastrophe over and over.

‘You’re soul is bigger than mine.” Morena’s words rang back in his head, That was right, he was the only lab rat who survived and succeeded in reaching what the dragons sought. A stable mad soul that has transcended time and space, The reason Sylph’s enslavement spell got reflected on her is that she touched the chaotic madness inside his soul. He got all the benefits of being mad without the side effects.

When Cain thought about it, Zaleria was lucky to have linked with Sylph instead of him or she might have not recovered from what she will see. He was also refraining from straining his link with Alice to not let her touch his soul.

The enchantment had two meanings, the first is granting magical properties to an object and the second was mentally twisting something with magic.

“I don’t particularly feel anything, I’m just watching you like how I watch the other maids work.” Hearing her answer Cain gave her a pained look, “Then we better level you up quickly to level 20, that might be the only way to safely make you smile naturally.”

Gracie nodded, “If you think anything will help you then do it.” Cain told her as he saw the nonchalantly nod from her. For a moment she looked at the ceiling and then walked to the bed and lay beside Selena. “Probably I need to be closer?” Gracie said but Selena immediately pushed her out of the bed, “It’s my night-nya.”

Seeing Selena act like that Cain switched his attention to her after seeing Gracie just sit closer. It was funny that even though he was starting to feel numb in his hips, Selena still didn’t show a shred of exhaustion, she was just shaking her lower end while wiggling her tail inviting him in for more.

Cain looked down at the horny cat and the maid staring at them with a passive face, ‘Well it doesn’t matter now, I thought that staying here might trigger a reaction from her but it didn’t.’ Cain sighed, “You can leave now.” Cain told her, there was no point in making her watch them like this now.

“Can I stay?” Gracie surprised Cain with her sudden question. “Wait, why do you want to stay?” Cain asked, wishing she finally felt something.

“No particular reason, I just think it’s better for me to stay for a bit longer.” It wasn’t what he expected but this was an improvement, she had succubus blood after all.
