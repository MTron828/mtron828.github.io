In a small shed close to Ourals city, a Woman was lying naked in her bathtub. As the warm water engulfed every spot on her body, she sighed. “AHHH! Hot baths are really amazing!” Crack! She cracked and twisted her neck, “But it does lack a punch, let’s change that!” With a faint trace of magic, the water turned green with a horrid acidic smell. The bathtub started Cracking but it was soon reinforced with magic.

“This is what I’m talking about!” she said loudly, stretching her limbs and taking a large gulp of said liquid. “Nothing is as refreshing as potent acid!” The moonlight coming from the window quickly washed over her full-of-freckles face.

She lowly scratched her cheek, her other hand scratched her lower cheek. She moved her gaze toward the open window and them toward the open door. “I was carving a late-night snack, I will give them an honest chance to pleasure me and I will let anyone who succeeds live!” The woman talked to herself as if she was used to it, she quickly smiled at her own words. “Humans are stupid after all!”

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” She moaned loudly enough to be heard from several meters.

“What the fu*k was that? Did you hear a woman’s voice?” A man’s voice called.

“Aren’t you crazy or did you have too many drinks?” Another man laughed.

The woman heard them and she got interested. Were they drunk? If that’s the case they might take her up on her offer. This abandoned shed was supposed to be quite hidden so they should be comfortable having their way. “I’m here taking a bath, In the most left room!” She called the stranger to her without any hint of worry.

“Did you hear that? I told you I heard something!”

“AHHHHHHHHHHH! I’m here!” She called again, “Hurry I can’t wait!” Her voice was dragging them as the flame does with flies.

“For real?” They gasped as they followed her tempting voice.

“Damn, my eyes are burning! What the fu*k is this smell!” They all covered their nose and eyes as they walked into the bath. Their eyes quickly fell on the woman lying naked in the Acid tub. She gently waved at them. “Care to join?” spreading her legs apart slowly in front of their eyes.

Even though they were bandits, they were not stupid. There isn’t a sane woman who will do this, add the liquid she was bathing in disgusted them to the point they couldn’t notice her beauty. This woman was clearly crazy and dangerous so one of them rushed toward her drawing his sword. “Die. You bitch!” She smiled flashing her white sharp teeth, she licked her lips.

Whoosh! His sword quickly melted to the ground, “I really don’t like those things, they ruin the taste!” The woman breathed a green mist at the bandit as she opened her arms for him. The bandit’s clothes melted instantly as his eyes rolled backward. His dead body fell into her embrace. “To think my meal will come to me on his own!” The bandit’s body melted into a green goo that she sucked instantly with a loud slurp.

As the other bandits started to tremble in fear, the woman rose from the bathtub and opened her arms wide for them. “Who wants a hug? Anyone who manages to please will live!” She said caressing her body.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Run!” One of the bandits screamed, “AHH! A monster!” They screamed as every single one of them ran away. The door was too small for them all to fit in at once so they were stuck. She joyfully looked at them scrambling like scarred chickens. The woman slowly walked toward them. She slowly hugged one of them from behind, sniffing his neck while her hand grabbed his lower half tightly.

“How boring…” She said with a sad face as the man showed no reaction to her and kept trying to run away. Suddenly a wave of acid emerged from her body engulfing and melting them away. “Thanks for the meal!” She said as she slurped everything and gently tapped her belly.

She licked her teeth as she combed her black hair with her fingers, “I accidentally swallowed some of their clothes! Ugh,” The woman spat what was in her mouth loudly. As she was trying to walk away, she got a sudden feeling.

“Someone broke the curse? It’s the same one, I see!” She laughed in amusement. “That brat jack was a fun experiment, I wonder if this one would be just as fun!” She quickly adsorbed every droplet of acid in the shed.

“There is still some time until the dungeon is ready to break, it’s time to have fun, to have fun!” She hummed searching for where she hid her clothes.

She quickly found them and started sliding them on her brown skin, “I better get to him before little sister, before little sister!” The clothes were simple, a pair of black underwear, a long grey robe, and some old jewelry.

The woman quickly finished wearing her clothes and headed outside. At the side of the shed was a carriage holding five kidnapped merchants. A man, two women, and a small boy and a girl. She cheerfully hummed as she approached the carriage.

The woman tapped the cage bars with her fingers and gave a faint grin.

“Want me to free you?” She asked with a wicked smile, the man nodded as the two women hid behind him. They were his wife and sister. The two kids were his. “Who are you, where are the bandits?”

She smiled at him, “Dead, I ate them!” She said naturally, “I will let them go if you tasted decent!” she looked at the two women behind him as she licked her lips.

The man nodded again and the woman instantly melted the metal cage they were locked inside. “AGRAAAAAAAAAA!” Some of the acids dripped on his wife and sister, they both screamed in agony as their skin melted exposing patches of flesh on their arms.

“I did mean to do that, thank me for sparing the children!” She said smiling in joy.

“Thanks for sparring the kids.” The man growled trying to muffle his anger to not provoke her.

“Hurry, talk it off as I don’t have time!” she said slamming the man on his shoulder with one hand.

“Take the children and run as fast as you could, don’t look behind no matter what.” The man said Calmly as the woman watched. Both his sister and wife started crying, screaming that they don’t want to leave him behind.

The man quickly noticed the woman behind him getting irritated; he knew that if they continued like this they were all going to die. He made the hard decision to forcefully shut both his wife and sister with a hard slap, “Take the children and get OUT of here!” His scream and the pain quickly snapped them back to reality and they run away with the children, the woman behind him smiled.

“Come on, you wanted a meal right?” He said looking at her in the eyes.

“Aren’t you afraid of death?” she smiled, “You’re going to be melted alive, I heard it hurt like hell!” She said grinning.

“It’s a well-deserved fate for a man who just slapped his wife and sister, Come on, monster!” He swung his fist at her face as hard as he could. He was met with a sharp stinging pain as she melted his arm, followed by his whole body.

“Hmmm! Disgusting. What did I expect from someone like you?” She spat what was left in her mouth, “Now for the dessert. She quickly extended her acid between the trees and caught the women and children who just ran away, devouring everything.

“Oops, I almost forgot, I have to hurry!” She said as her body grotesquely morphed. A gigantic scaly body, four limbs, two massive wings, a single long tail that ends in a stinger. Two black horns that point forward extended from her head.

She flew away toward the north.
