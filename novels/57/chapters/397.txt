Cain appeared again beside Selena and Hati, “Are you ready?”

“Yeah, let’s head out,” Hati replied with a smile, she was ready for her first mission with Cain. Selena was telling her that this was her chance to shine. When Selena said the more the merrier before she meant the more wives the merrier, the number was a source of pride, to the pride’s member.

Since they were going around a lot of small dungeons, Cain used a mix of [Fly] and [Teleport] to quickly run between the dungeons.

As expected, they breezed through the lower dungeons like they were nothing. Not a single monster in them was strong enough to pose a challenge.

Both Selena and Hati gained but a meager amount of exp. But Selena was about to level up and that was exciting. At level 24 she will get another two stat points.

Cain then looked at his own stats and cringed, Farryn’s complaint might be real, he was beating most of the bosses so he was hogging a lot of exp.

“This wasn’t even worth calling an exercise. What do we have next?” Hati asked as she cleaned the dust from her shoulders.

“We still have the unidentified dungeon, it might be a bit interesting,” Cain replied.

“What is that-nya?” Selena seemed to have just finished eating her snack, a crocodile that they hunted in the last A-rank dungeon.

“A dungeon that just appeared. We don’t know its rank or the type of monsters within. Usually, a scouting party needs to go first to determine how the dungeon work but we can just clear it like we did the others.” Cain replied with a confident voice.

“What if it was an S-rank?” Hati asked the important question.

“That’s a one in a thousand chance, and another one in a thousand chance it’s a dungeon that we can’t just power through. In total it’s a one in a million chance that it’s going to give us troubles.” Cain replied. It was unlikely that they will have problems.

They both nodded approaching the gate with Cain. The gate seemed to be constructed from white stone and had a golden glimmer to it and was standing in the middle of a mountain range close to the orc’s nest.

As Cain was passing through the gate he got a weird feeling, ‘I didn’t jinx it right, I don’t have that bad of luck but even…I just need to be careful’ Cain thought, he finally realized how much he disliked dealing with things he know nothing about.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The inside of the dungeon looked rather nice. A straight stone hallway that is well lit up with torches. A gust of refreshing cold wind passed through that eased the mind.

“Isn’t beautiful?” Hati smiled, “I have a bad feeling-nya!” Selena was glaring at the torches, their flicker annoyed her.

“You’re right, in most cases, there is no sentient being in a dungeon with enough time to tend to the torches.” Cain sighed.

“You mean?” Hati asked, “(This is an illusion)” Skoll was the one to reply to her.

“She is right.” Cain flicked his finger and all the torches disappeared, what seemed like refreshing air is now a dry hot gust of wind that smelled foul. The beautiful white walls became all stained with dirt and blood.

“What?” Hati covered her nose, this place was disgusting.

“I smell blood-nya!” Selena growled as she stood in front of Cain.

She was awaiting for a monster to appear but nothing happened. “Cain, it seems to have left…Nya?” As she turned around, both Cain and Hati have disappeared.

CRACK! A hole opened under her.

“GAW!” Using her claws she latched to the edge saving herself at the last moment. “This was dangerous, I have to find Cain-nya!” Selena shifted into her Jaguar form and started sniffing around until she picked Cain’s smell.

“He’s ahead-nya!” She rushed into the darkness following the smell.

…

Hati opened her eyes to a lit large room that she didn’t recognize. ‘What happened? I was with Cain and Selena a moment ago, we sensed a monster, and then suddenly everything went dark.’ She couldn’t recall how she ended up here.

“You failure of a daughter, Just if you weren’t born…” From the room’s shadow, Hati’s father emerged with a disappointed look on his face.

Hati glared at him, “I see, illusion.” Thud! In an instant, she rushed and beheaded him in a single move with her normal sword.

“Such a cruel being, this is the first one someone killed their loved one as fast as you.” The corpse talked standing up.

“That’s creepy, Cain you stop and fight me directly?” Hati glared at him with disgust, what kind of monster is this thing?

“Creepy? More reasons to fight you like this!” The corpse moved at an extreme speed and kicked Hati in the guts.

It took her a moment to realize it, her first hit landed easily since the monster wanted her to kit him.

Thud! Hati landed on the wall and leaped back at her father’s corpse with a second slash. CLING! The normal sword Shattered as the corpse blocked it.

‘(Use the eternal blade. That might work)’ Skoll gave her sister some advice. Hati didn’t wait and pulled the blade out of her hand.

By that time, her father has re-attached his head and is smiling. “That sword seems interesting, give it to me!” Her father rushed ahead as they Clashed.

…

When Cain opened his eyes, he was in the elvish royal castle standing in front of a prostrating Sylph. “Please Master Cain, you can have your way with the entire castle.”

Cain stared at her, “Stand up.” As per his word, Sylph slowly stood.

“Sorry but I’m not into dream larva.” Cain smiled.

Sylph instantly tried to jump back but he grabbed her by the neck.

She started struggling and growling.

Cain kept his smile, “Come on…your acting is getting worse. Sylph would mind being treated like this.” An evil smile crossed Cain’s face as he used [Telekinesis] to start twisting her neck.

The room around them started to shift and morph, from a pristine building into a whirlpool of multicolor light. Sylph who was struggling in Cain’s hand quickly turned into a giant, disgusting black worm with a massive red mouth.

[Dream land]: the larva can create an illusion that a fragment of its, or the target’s dreams. A creature who falls for the illusion is slowly weakened until the larva can consume them.

Cain started laughing, “Where is your mother? I prefer to deal with her more than you.” Cain growled as he snapped the worm in half.

~Selena? Hati~

‘I can’t reach them, did those worms separate us this quickly? No there must be a trick to it’ Cain looked around but he wasn’t about to find the answer.

‘The fastest way is finding their mother,’ Cain sighed, the dream Larva’s mother is probably the dungeon’s boss and it won’t be easy to beat solo. It would have been nice if Ariel was here, she can be super effective against those monsters.

Cain rushed ahead as he had no time to waste. He might be able to beat the worms, but both Selena and Hati can’t since they probably won’t be able to escape the dream illusion.

Selena kept running in the darkness until she saw a light that lead her outside the dungeon.

“Where am I-nya?” As she looked behind she saw the dungeon’s gate.
