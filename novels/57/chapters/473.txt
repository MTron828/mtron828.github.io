“They really can’t even react!” Zaleria yelled as she flew toward one of the giants in a single leap. Her right hand morphed into a dragon’s claws as she swung at the giant’s head.

CRACK! The giant’s skull burst like a melon being hit with a metal bat, even though he had a high strength score, Zaleria still had more.

FLAP! With only a few flaps of her wings, Alice stabbed one of the giants in the chest with her cursed sword. “Rest in peace!” She pushed the blade even deeper to pierce the heart.

As Decay magic circulated through the giant’s body, it wreaked havoc causing the flesh to rot away. In a second, the giant was no more than a crumbling pile of bones.

Alice’s cursed magic can be sensed even from the village, an oppressive sense of the unavoidable end washed over everyone.

‘If she used this in outside hell, I bet every cleric and paladin in five miles radius would get alarmed by her existence.’ Cain thought with a smile on his face.

Thud! Thud! Selena climbed one of the giants in her human form with her powerful arms and claws. She didn’t even need to use her legs. Carrying her body weight was that easy for her.

STAB! She jammed her claws into the giant’s cheekbones and to his collar bone with her foot claws.

CRACK! With a single powerful swing from her claws and the giant’s head spun around, his neck cracked as easily as a stick. That was especially easy since the giants could not think to resist Selena’s strength.

Hati rushed toward a giant as well, Skoll created multiple stone platforms for her to jump to his head.

TING! Hati pulled the eternal blade and stabbed the giant’s forehead. “([Rock Burst])” From the tip of the blade, multiple stone spikes emerged causing the giant’s skull to explode.

Swoosh! Sofia flew toward the last giant with a burst of flames from her legs. Since almost everyone aimed at the head, she did the same. Attempting to take the giant down with a single hit.

As her kick landed on his forehead, she could feel her leg almost cracking. Her 20 strength was barely enough to break the giant’s bones.

“AGRRROOOAAAR!” Sofia growled as flames engulfed her whole body. Zaleria had told her that she only need to keep her clothes in mind when transforming and they should be fine.

Her body started swelling into her draconic form. VROOOM! The flame started bursting from the back of her massive wings and she crushed the giant to the ground with her hind legs. His skull got pushed down to his bladder in a single, explosive burst of flames from Sofia’s claws.

As her draconic aura engulfed the whole area, the devils froze in place staring at her. They weren’t surprised that she was a dragon just as much they were with how her aura felt, that girl had the same oppressive feeling as the previous tyrant ruler of Avernus, Tiamat.

It was so much similar that if they weren’t seeing her, they would assume that Tiamat had returned.

As Sofia landed in a storm of her flames, the five giants started resurrecting immediately behind her. Cain did set them to revive one last time.

Nemmoxon took that opportunity to unleash a lightning breath at the Nupperibo and Lemure swimming in the pool of blood. As the shock dissipated it killed all the Lemure immediately and left the Nupperibo severely burned and paralyzed.

Gracie quickly finished them from the shadows without a second thought. Those won’t revive again.

The giants got revived. The first thought on their minds when seeing Cain glaring at them in the distance. ‘RUN!’

Cain wasn’t something they want to face, remembering what they have just gone through was enough to make their bones shudder.

They turned around and started running as fast as their stubby legs could carry them.

CRACK! Suddenly, their legs got frozen to the bone. Looking behind them, a knight was pointing her sword at them from atop a rock. “I still haven’t gotten any kill! I never knew those girls could move so fast!” Isbert shouted. She was the slowest of all the girls so they beat her to the battlefield.

From behind Isbert, a scene from the dooms day took place. Both Zaleria and Sofia had their jaws open charging their breaths.

Looking back, Isbert forgets about getting a kill, not when those two are here. She immediately ran behind them to avoid getting turned into roasted meat.

All devils hid behind the city wall, two dragons were about to unleash a breath at the same time. If one is a disaster, two aren’t going to end well at all.

Hati lifted her hands up, “Sister!” At that moment, Skoll took over and Hati’s nine tails got covered with a sheet of stones and pierced the ground.

“Cain, support me with this one!” Skoll yelled clamping her hands together [Move Earth]

The other girls quickly rushed behind her to hide before the two breathes release. Nothing guarantees that those two have enough control to not burn them. And even if Zaleria did, Sofia sure didn’t.

The ground in front of her started rising rapidly, forming a massive, thirty-foot-high wall that surrounded the village.

Cain lifted one of his fingers, [Enchanting: Mold earth] “You don’t need my help, just change the shape to deflect the flames instead of taking it head-on.” He said bending her wall to an angle.

Sofia and Zaleria released their breaths at the same time. The two jets of compressed flames scattered the moment they clashed into the giants’ hard skin. As expected, residents of this layer were quite resistant to fire and acid since they lived here for so long.

Yet, even with that, the fire quickly burned through and reached their bones in a fiery explosion. As the crimson flame rose to the sky, its petals crashed into the stone wall cracking it.

“It feels hard, are those really flames?” Skoll growled as she felt the impact.

~It’s just the shockwave, their breath exploded. If you had your wall standing straight, it wouldn’t have mattered how much strength you used. It will just get pulled from the ground~ Cain replied with [Message] as he didn’t expect her to hear him in this mess.

“Is this the power of red dragons?” Nemmoxon growled as she covered Cain and the girls with her wings.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

~Well it’s two of them. And they both are witches who can increase the power of their flame with witchcraft. I expect them to be a bit stronger than a dragon in their age category~ Cain replied.

“At what age they are?” Nemmoxon asked.

~Zaleria is about to become a wyrm, and Sofia is already at the scale of an ancient dragon~

Zaleria was only living close to him which is slowly pushing her toward the wyrm stage at an incredible rate, probably unprecedented by other dragons.

But, Sofia was more than that, she has been closer to him than anyone else. On top of that, her abnormal consumption of his mana fuels her flames. Her body and draconic blood quickly recognized Cain as the norm and adapted to him.

….

Asgorath (dragons), alongside Adam (Humans) and the world tree Yggdrasil (The elves) were designed by AO to survive at the chaotic start of the world when powerful abomination and primordial monster rampaged the world.

Wisdom and intelligence ran in the humans’ veins, no matter the impossible the feat seemed to be, Adam always managed to grasp it and so did the humans, surviving to this day.

“My children, live on. Till the day my father calls me back.” It was Adam’s last words before he died.

Everlasting radiance and growth, a wellspring of magic that never goes dry. An unmatched elegance that hides a vicious love for domination. Symbolic of how Yggdrasil has grown to every corner of the multiverse, dominating while still keeping its mesmerizing emerald-green glow.

“Today, I ascend to godhood and take a step further to reach father. Protect the tree till the day its roots are needed again.” It was Corellon Larethian’s last words before he ascended.

Power and adaptability run in the dragons’ veins, their power springs from their perfect bodies and genius biology. As they proudly flung their power, showing the great power of AO who created them.

“Stand tall and proud, we’re father’s marvelous creation. Not a single creature shall stand above your claws. Aim high and show the world your power, Rip and tear until it’s done.” This is what Asgorath said before splitting his power between Tiamat and Bahamut, his two children.

As the two dragons stood proudly over the ashes of their enemies, roaring, Cain smiled.

“Tiamat knows about the dragons’ nature, that’s why she decided to live in hell where the environment could push her to keep growing stronger,” Cain said with a big smile on his face.
