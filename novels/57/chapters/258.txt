After resting for a bit, Cain and the others returned to the ruined Fenrir village. Most of the houses have been stopped to the ground, more than three-fourths of the population died when the earth dragon transformed.

Waiting for Their return stood a group of Fenrir people. “What happened to that monster?” One of them rushed to ask.

“He won’t be coming back. You can rest at ease for the time being.” Cain replied. It was better not to tell them that he sealed the earth dragon a short distance away from their village.

The villagers’ stiff expressions faded out, they never expected such a monster to be defeated so quickly.

“There is another thing we need to talk about…” One of the elders walked toward Cain, he seemed to be one who worked with Ulf (The beast god) before.

“What is it?” Cain asked. “It’s you old man?” Chad didn’t seem to be happy to see him. Cain immediately took note of his father’s reaction and became careful talking with the old man.

“In the time you have been fighting, the villager came to a decision.” The old man said stroking his long white beard.

This time Cain felt a faint blood lust from Alen. Two people dislike this old man, which was strange.

“Did you talk to the whole village?” Cain asked with a puzzled face.

“No, it was a decision made by the elder council.” The old man said as he looked at a bunch of elderly behind him. Cain understood that they are the adviser that worked under Ulf. In the same way, the noble in Furberg is William’s advisor.

“Ulf’s action brought this disaster upon us, him disgracing our race with his actions was unforgivable. But, he already died. So to qualm the beast god Fenrir rage we want you to hand Hati over to us.” Cain’s face twisted as he listen to him.

“Say what?” Cain felt as if he understood what they were meaning. If that was the case then he might end up killing them all right here.

“We want to sacrifice her in the name of the beast god Fenrir to calm his anger. I hope you can understand.” The old man pretended to bow slightly.

Hati stared at Cain, what was he going to say. She could only see his back but she was able to feel the boing anger in him.

“Old man!” Alen screamed, he was about to kill him with a fireball. The fireball didn’t appear.

“So why do you want to do that, to what goal?” Chad asked as he walked between Cain and the old man.

“Don’t interfere human, we only want the best for our race.” The old man growled. They did know that Chad was a friend of Ulf so they didn’t want him here.

The air around them suddenly turned red and Chad smiled. “So that was a lie!” He had already cast [Zone of Truth]

“I knew it was strange, Fenrisúlfr is a proud wolf who loves his people. It’s out of character for him to ask for a sacrifice.” Cain said as he stood by his father’s side.

“Don’t pretend to know our God better than us humans. Hand over that girl quietly!” The old man screamed in anger.

Cain looked at Hati. She lost both her parents today so she must be having a lot of things in her head. Is it right to let her decide or is it better to take her with them for the time being?

Cain had seen a lot of decisions made in such situations. They never ended nicely. The number of people who just decided to give up after losing everything isn’t small.

Hati just stared at them with an angry face, Cain didn’t know what was going on in her head.

“No, I’m not handing her over,” Cain said with a stern face. Then a thought crossed his head and he wanted to try it.

“Was it you the ones who guided the earth dragon inside? Otherwise, I can’t see Ulf or Alen missing his presence.” Cain asked a question as he lifted his palm and started condensing a fireball.

“You must be joking. We would never do such an outrageous thing.” The area around them turned red again. They were lying again.

“Sorry, I just cast it again.” Chad smiled. No one is allowed to lie in front of him.

Alen’s face turned red. The entire turmoil that happened in the last month was their doing.

“Tch!” The old man twisted and pulled a weird wand from his wrist. Cain felt that it had summoning magic engraved in it, a summoning wand for calling someone.

Thud! Kayden immediately sliced the old man in half from head to groin and grabbed the small wand. He then snapped it in half with his teeth.

“Feral dogs must be put out immediately,” Kayden growled as his six eyes scanned the remaining elder. They all pulled their weapons but were immediately knocked out by Cain and Chad. Even Alen went in and smacked one of them with his staff.

“They are like the corrupt nobles of Furberg and Ourals. We must let them be judged publically.” Cain said as they shouldn’t kill them here.

“It’s fine, let them be. I will be going on my own journey.” Hati said as she saw Cain tying them up.

“I do have something to show you. We don’t have much time so can you come with me now?” Cain said as he left the work to his father and the girls.

“I told you that you don’t have to do anything.” He could see Hati giving up as life was draining from her eyes. She was heated earlier because of the fight and all. But now that she was calming down, the emotional turmoil was about to hit her.

“Skoll, give me a hand and bring her after me,” Cain said as he started walking toward the village center. Hati’s body moved on his own as Skoll followed Cain’s order.

“Sister, what are you doing?” Hati called her sister.

“(Trust me, you better trust him. I’ve seen it first hand, that man can make wonders)” Skoll told Hati as she forced her to follow Cain.

After a while, Cain looked around, “This seems like a good place.” He then clapped both his hands together.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

For a moment, Hati felt necrotic magic rising from Cain’s body but it suddenly turned into normal magic. [Commune: With the dead]

As small orbs of golden light gathered around him, Cain only grabbed two of them and walked toward Hati.

“I can only keep this for a short while so make the most of it.” Cain let the two orbs of light float toward Hati. “I will be leaving now, come see me after you finish.” Cain turned around and walked away.

“Wait, what do you mean?” Hati called him. It was then that she saw two familiar figures standing in front of her.

“Can you hear us?” One of the ghosts called her.

The spell Cain used was one that made speaking with the dead possible. As souls were just an accumulation of magic. He could use said magic to contact them when they are present.

The spell had a lot of limitations, like that it can only work on people that died less than a day ago. The souls must agree to speak, they also must risk themselves being absorbed by the caster as well.

Cain had used that spell to Call Hati’s parents. The mother was hard to reach but he managed to do it. They both saw Cain’s horrid soul and felt his ability to eat both of them yet they risked it just to have a chance to talk with their daughter.

With how much mastery Cain had over the spell, he could give them about five minutes to talk. It was best to let them have a private conversation.

…

After a while, Hati came toward Cain her eyes blood red. Cain just stared at her in silence.
