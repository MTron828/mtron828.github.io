Cain’s mind stopped for a second asking the how and why, He quickly pulled his leg away but was caught by her. “Master, don’t run away!” She didn’t want to leave his foot alone.

Cain realized that the only way out was to dive in, trying to be as gentle as possible while still using enough force to pull her away, Cain flipped her around.

“Ah! Master be gentler!” She shook her lower half, taunting him to get faster. Cain easily took the bait trying to go faster and faster, quickly depleting what little remained of his stamina.

Alice smiled, her tail writhed left and right in excitement. Cain was supposed to be dominant but she was quickly flipping the table on him. After a while, she realized the water draining from his face, he was being exhausted quickly.

After just a few moments she could feel him getting softer and softer, his eyes daze into the distance. Alarmed, Alice quickly switched back to her human form and escaped his grasp. “Cain?!”

Cain was short of breath and his mind was wandering off, with her face flashing with a faint yellow tone, it was clear that something was off about him. [Holy Healing] She quickly healed but it was to no avail.

Alice racked her brain to think of what he was going through if her healing didn’t work it isn’t an injury. Hoping it was just exhaustion she sat him on the ground, splashing some cold water on his face.

A burning desire still raged between her legs but she couldn’t ask more from him. ‘We never learn. We should have let him rest!’ Taking a small bowl of warm water, she washed him and herself before going to the bath door and Calling Gracie who was standing outside to come and help her.

“Do I need to carry him naked?” Gracie asked as she followed Alice, “Until we dress him in the changing room, yes. After that call the other and carry him to his room.” Alice quickly dismissed Gracie’s words.

Gracie quickly sprang into action, but she didn’t want to carry him. As he said before she will follow her first thought and it was refusal. She tried to understand her emotions and this was the best opportunity to test them.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wake up!” Gracie poked Selena who quickly sprung up. “What happened-nya?” She gasped.

“Cain couldn’t take the heat, carry him to the changing room!” Gracie said. Selena looked toward him, her eyes opened wide as she remembered that he was still recovering. “We overdid it-nya!” With a worried face, she quickly carried him to the changing room where Alice and Gracie dried and covered him with the garment the maids prepared for him.

“I will call the other maids, please wait for a moment!” Gracie raced out and Alice took that time to put something on herself, Selena got back in to drag Sofia out.

“Listen, from today on it’s forbidden that we three go at him at the same time. One at a time and a single time a day max!” Alice stated in frustration, “But tomorrow is my turn, any objections?” Selena who got surprised by Alice’s quick temper change quickly nodded and Sofia was still dazed to understand.

…

Cain opened his eyes later in his bed. Looking around, the room was empty except for a maid who was sitting on a chair close to his head.

“What happened?” Cain asked, the maid looked at him with a gentle smile.

“You passed out in the bath, please rest for now!” Cain could vaguely remember the last moments when he was behind Alice.

“Where are they?” If he passed out, they must be worried. The maid looked at him with an exhausted face.

“Lady Alice alongside ma’am Headmaid are at the basement with Sebas, they are training with the prisoner.” Her face turned a bit pale, “Lady Sofia is in the kitchen with the maids and Lady Selena has gone out on a walk!”

They all seemed to be safe except Selena, Cain didn’t have a good experience with her walks, especially now that someone is targeting them.

Cain tried to stand up but the maid quickly pushed him down on the bed, “I got an order from the three ladies to keep you in the bed resting until dinner time, please don’t make it hard for me.” Hearing her words Cain gave a suspicious look, “You know I’m the master.”

The maid shocked her head, “So are the ladies, especially lady Alice. When it concerns your health they are in charge.” Now that he was weak his authority was transferred to the girls, the maids won’t listen to him when it Can hurt his health but instead will follow the girls? Cain thought hard about but the only conclusion he reached was it’s a mechanism to prevent the housemaster from hurting himself.

“What if I punished you afterward?” Cain asked, even if he can’t do anything now that didn’t mean he can’t later.

The maid frowned at his words before quickly breaking into a smile, “Please start with the ladies first then.”

Noticing her demeanor Cain started laughing, “Sorry I was joking. I know you only want the best for me!” He replied, quickly keeping his image in her eyes. He wasn’t joking earlier but after quickly thinking it through he changed his mind.

She sighed in relief, “For a moment you scared me there, I thought that we have run out of luck with you.” The maids’ last master was William who didn’t get that close to them. Always keeping their relationship professional, He only seemed to get close with the older maids but always got struck down by Lisa, he never bat an eye toward them who were a younger generation.

Their current master, Cain was closer to their age and seemed to have taken an interest in Gracie, which was the first red flag they got. One of the reasons they quickly accepted her as Headmaid was for her to be like Lisa and keep him focused on her, she didn’t seem to mind so they thought why not.

Now hearing that he might get violent with them was worrying, luckily, it seems he was joking.

The maid sitting beside him was named Lexi Wright. Her piercing black eyes gazed upon Cain’s body and she finally flicked her twin-tail hair back. She seemed to have something in mind but kept silent not to agitate him further.

“Want to say something?” Cain was quick to read her face. Her eyes blinked as his voice surprised her.

She nervously looked around to check the room, no one was there besides the two of them. She looked at him with quivering eyes, hesitating to speak.

“Just say what you have, I promise I wouldn’t get mad,” Cain reassured her.

“This morning when I went shopping for lunch I was approached by a stranger who asked about your health, I got suspicious of him but replied that you were getting well… Was that a mistake?” Cain quickly turned serious as he heard her words, a visible frown covered his face and Lexi covered her face.

“The swine!” Lexi surprisingly didn’t feel any pressure coming from him, she glance at him with a single eye. He looked Calm as if his anger was a lie.

“This is an emergency, tell the maids they are forbidden from going outside as they might get attacked.” Cain calmly stated.

He was followed and now his maids, this was more serious as they might try and take one of them as a hostage.

“Call Sebas, tell him that this is an emergency!” Lexi quickly rushed out.

Cain stayed in bed thinking about how should they act, this must be the doing of someone living in the city. Most likely, a noble that is influenced by Ourals lord. Dealing with them is going to be hard.

At that moment he heard a thud outside his window, it was still daylight outside! Slowly lifting his hand toward the window, he prepared to attack.

His eyes opened wide when he saw it was Selena, she was dragging a body with her.

“I caught this man sneaking around the house, do you know him-nya?”
