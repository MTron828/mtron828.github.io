Cain wasn’t able to walk, he was also reeking of olive oil. Meeting the guards normally seemed out of the question. He has to find a way to meet them and buy time until Leon comes.

“Gracie, call Sebas. I need to borrow his office.” His words were firm, and Gracie rushed out to look for Sebas While Cain took that time to think of what he should say, ‘ I have to buy at least an hour.’

“He said it will be ready soon, let me help you change into something more befitting of noble.” Cain looked down at himself finally realizing the delicate choice of clothes Gracie picked for him before.

“I see, this is way too soft and smooth to be official wear.” What he was wearing had the same look as an exotic garment but it was made of silk and cotton. Gracie mostly picked it up after seeing he could easily get scarred by sitting for too long.

“I will have something more formal ready soon, I will also add padding inside to make it more comfortable. Albeit it will be considerably hotter, can you handle that master?” It was almost winter and it was getting cold outside, having a few thick clothes didn’t hurt.

Gracie quickly prepared them for him, elegant and tight trousers decorated with golden threads. A pure white chemise that was stolen from Sebas’s drawers. His underwear were things he didn’t recognize.

“What are these?” Inspecting the pick short-pants. And an elegant white tank top.

“You better off not knowing,” Gracie replied. Cain just stared at her for a moment. They were comfortable so he was okay to not know.

“How are you going to move? We can carry you there if you want.” Gracie seemed concerned even though her expressions were as uninterested and black as they could.

“I would appreciate that, just seat me on the chair and strap me to it. Soft padding would also help greatly.” Cain already knew how he is going to move his hands, it will help him greatly that the guards should already hear rumors about him fighting in the lords’ mansion.

With the help of some maids, he was quickly moved there and strapped with a thin strap on his stomach so it won’t be visible. Gracie looked at Cain to see how he will move his hands, he was pretty limp when they carried him here.

[Animate Dead] With faint blue lines, his arms started to move. ‘I better use one of the spirit stones to cancel the necrotic magic with spirit magic, just like trying to remove a foul smell from something!’

Now that he had the two-spirit stones inside him they can be used as units to increase his magic scale and quality by using them as separate processing units. Those two can be set like this, one for controlling Mana output and the other to refine it to specific types.

(This analogy is to give more clarity to how he works. If he was a computer, his body would be the motherboard and his soul is the CPU. Up to this point, he was relying on the integrated graphic of his CPU [Assuming he was team blue]. Now that he has those two stones, one of them will act as a graphic card and the other as a power control unit that protects his system from getting fried) I hope this is making sense.

“How do I look?” Cain asked as he waved his hands around, checking if they looked natural.

“You look pale!” Gracie replied, “I meant my movements.” He added after being hit with her reply.

“They look natural, the only problem is the dim blue light emitting from them. Why don’t you move your whole body if you can?” She asked, being right to assume something is wrong.

“I’m low on MP, remember that keeping my MP so I won’t overheat?” Cain replied as if it was obvious. It was time and he has to face the guards.

The maids quickly called the guards, Gracie stood by Cain’s side as she held her knife ready under her sleeves. Cain could sense her tension, there wasn’t much bloodlust as she didn’t have a lot of MP.

“Relax, everything will go smoothly, I hope,” Cain assured her as the two guards entered the room, a maid quickly followed them with a tray carrying tea.

“Please, have a seat!” Cain told them trying to be as gentle as he could.

“No need, we sat as much. The three women you’re hiding have committed a severe crime, I ask of you to hand them nicely!” One of the guards shouted, at that moment Gracie could feel Cain’s rage just from the look on his face.

Cain lighted slightly, “I hear you shot my wife, are you tired of living?” His tone changed completely, a sudden sharp burst of bloodlust engulfed the room. Gracie could feel her legs shudder. It wasn’t that strong nor that big. It was just too sharp. Instead of a big sword, it felt like a thin sharp thread wrapping around her neck.

“Y-you’re talking with the head guard of Forberg’s scout team. You better watch your mouth if you don’t want your whole family arrested!” One of them yelled, banging his hand on the table.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Ho…The women you’re wanting to arrest, do you know who they are? I bet you still missing a name, I advise you to leave now and never speak of what happened again. Otherwise, you will face execution!” Cain smiled at them, he was sure they didn’t know who Alice was, they were chased away but Selena was alone after all.

“Listen, you ignorant bastard. Those women injured over forty soldiers. That is leaving the town defenses weakened and is a state crime on its own. Hand them over quietly or will have to resort to force.”

“Ha…Fine!” Cain lowered his head, and the guards’ faces lit up. “He is here so you’re already finished!”

“What?” As they gasped the door behind them was kicked open, from it a pissed-off old man stormed in with a red face.

William quickly punched the head guard straight in the face, “You bastard!” As the other guard tried to help he was struck by lightning. “Drag them to prison, I will handle their punishment personally!” Leon said as he walked in with his hair crackling with lightning.

The guards who came with William and Leon dragged them out immediately. “To think they dared attack my daughter, I need to discipline them from scratch!” Cain wore a wry smile, he already knows that those two will choose violence over anything when it comes to Alice.

Inside the room, Cain, William, Leon, and Gracie were the only ones remaining. Sebas seems to have told them that Alice, Sofia, and Selena were attacked by the guards and that Selena had to beat them up. That was misleading as Selena was the only one who got attacked, Cain doubted they will attack if they saw Alice.

In all sense, it worked in his favor, “Do you want to drink something?” Cain asked as he looked at the two of them panting, they have rushed here as soon as they heard the news.

“Water please, my throat has dried!” William snorted as he tried to clear his dried throat. “I would like that as well, a cup of tea would be appreciated!” Leon said as he melted on the couch, “My heart almost stopped!” He whispered.

Gracie hurried outside to bring them what they asked.

Cain laughed, he was barely able to sit. “It seems that this whole thing might be a misunderstanding between the guild and the guards, would you mind looking into that?” Cain asked as he looked at Leon.

Leon tried to sit straight and cleared his throat. “Mother should have already started investigating, we will inform you of any new developments.”

William’s face twisted, “I doubt this is a misunderstanding, quests taken by the guild are always reported to the guards. Someone must have a hand in this!” He growled.

“So you’re saying it was intended?” Cain asked.

“Not necessarily, we need to investigate further first!” Leon added as he looked at Gracie enter with the tray.

After having a calm drink and meeting the girls. William kept shaking Selena’s hand over and over, “Thank you for protecting my daughter, next time please feel free to kill any swindling bastard that dare come close to her.” He was genuine.

After they left, Gracie carried Cain back to his room and laid him on the bed. She sighed in relief as she heard the silence in the room. Alice, Selena, and Sofia quickly got in to check on him.

“Call Miko, I want her to try using the spell!” Cain suddenly said, brightening the girls’ faces. It was finally the time for them to try and heal him.

Cain on the other hand kept focusing on his system, it was time for him to add the final touches.

‘In my past life I was too strong to need this, I only wanted it for conveniences. But now I need that extra edge, to make sure something like this never happened again. Let’s utilize the system for its full potential

A gentle flow of Mana filled the air, Alice and Sofia almost panicked as they sensed the change around Cain.
