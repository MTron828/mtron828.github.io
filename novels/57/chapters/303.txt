Selena started poking Cain who was still laying unconscious alongside Kayden.

“Don’t worry about him, he is my son after all.” Chad comforted her.

SHAAA! SHAAA! Selena hissed at Chad as he approached. Covering Cain with her body she transformed into her jaguar form.

Chad slowly backed away even though he knew she couldn’t hurt him.

“I will go and find something to hunt, he will wake up soon,” Chad said as he walked away.

As soon as he got far enough, Chad started running through the trees. Thud! Thud! He started to quickly accelerate. Looking for any monster to hunt.

Clang! He suddenly heard the sound of metal clashing in the distance.

‘Probably some adventures fighting, should I check on them?’ Chad thought it will be bad to steal their hunt. Even though Chad just wanted to have a quick look.

…

“Reform, I will draw its attention!” Edward rushed ahead toward the massive Crimson Cobra with his blade up.

The woman who was wearing the robe of a mage behind him ran back and started drinking a blue potion.

“Newbie, Make sure to yell as loud as you can. It’s our job to protect the rear support!” Edward yelled at the young man beside him.

“Don’t ask the impossible, that thing is too big for me to block! I didn’t leave the guards to die here.” The young man yelled holding his shield.

“Believe me, they can get even bigger!” Edward jumped toward the Cobra swinging his sword.

The cobra hissed and slithered away immediately, “Sit I missed!” Edward growled.

“Did it run?” The young man gasped.

“Stay on your guard, those things are smarter than they look!” Edward yelled.

“But…” As the young man was about to talk, the cobra emerged from behind the mage and the rouge. It aimed to take out the weak mage first.

SHIIIIIIIIIIIII! The Cobra hissed deeply as her massive jaw opened. The mage gave up as her life flashed in front of her eyes.

Thud! Something heavy dropped between her and the cobra. When the mage opened her tearing eyes. She saw the back of a man holding the Cobra’s jaw pen with his bare hands.

“You are…” She tried to speak but then shut up as Chad glared at her.

“Run.”

The mage quickly stood up and started running. As if she was in a trance, she couldn’t even imagine not listening to him.

Clang! Edward leaped ahead and slashed at the Cobra’s eye. The cobra waved her body and retreated into the bushes.

“Thanks for saving her!” Edward thanked Chad. He remembered seeing him fight alongside the guild master so he must be strong.

“You’re that guy from the guild, what is your name?” Chad smiled at him.

“Edward, and you are…”

“Chad Lisworth, nice to meet you, young lad.” To Chad who was in his forties, both Cain and Edward were still kids. Edward didn’t mind being called a young lad at all, on the contrary, he was happy that someone as strong as the guild master has even asked for his name.

Yet there was one thing that clicked in Edward’s head, this man’s last name seemed to be similar to that menace of a newbie.

“Sir Chad, do you by any chance know anyone named Cain?” Edward asked with a worried face.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Cain? That would be my son. Are you two friends by any chance?” Chad smiled. Each day he seemed to find more and more about his son. At the start, Chad got worried as Cain didn’t seem to know any male friends. But then he found out about Kayden but he was a demon.

At that point, Cain claims to be a friend of Rieth while the man himself said they never met before. Chad started to get worried that Cain might only be befriending dangerous creatures.

But now he started to feel at ease. Edward here was a human and a pretty normal one at that. Even though Chad never talked before with Edward he has seen a lot of people in his life so he can tell at a glance what Edward is really like as a friend and as a person.

In Chad’s eyes. Edward was like salt. If he was present he will raise your blood pressure but if he wasn’t present life seems to lose its taste. He was a good man but an annoying one.

Edward lowered his head with a sight. No wonder Cain was a menace when his father could block the crimson cobra’s bite.

“So you’re his father…” Edward was about to talk when the tree beside them snapped. The cobra’s tail rushed toward Chad.

SHIIII! The cobra hissed, with her size and weight. A tail swipe was enough to kill a regular man without risking her vulnerable eyes.

Chad bushed Edward away. Thud! Readjusting his stance, Chad blocked the cobra’s tail swipe with his forearm.

“Is this all you go?” Chad growled as he grabbed the cobra’s tail in a bear hug.

“Here we go!” Thud! Chad stomped the ground and at the same tried to lift the Cobra up.

CRACK! Due to the cobra’s massive weight, it ended up with a broken tail rather than being lifted up. [Summon steed] Chad immediately mounted his horse and rode on top of the cobra’s back.

Edward glared in awe. Where did the golden horse come from? And did Chad just block a Crimson cobra tail swipe with his bare hands?

The Cobra immediately twisted its body in an attempt to catch Chad. It almost succeeded as the horse was big enough.

Suddenly the horse disappeared and Chad avoided her grasp and then summoned his steed again. After casting the spell, he could call or send the horse back as much as he want for the spell duration.

The cobra aimed for the shiny horse as it seemed bigger and more of a threat. At that time all of Edward’s party was trying to attack its sides but failing.

Chad pulled his sword and leaped into the air, [Thunderous Smite] His blade rumbled with lighting as it dropped down.

Chad’s attack left no chance for the distracted Cobra. Its head flew like a ball in the air. Thud! Seeing the man stand proudly on top of the crimson cobra’s corpse, Edward realized that he was watching a legend.

The crimson Cobra was an A-rank monster, which meant it needed a whole A-rank partly to be killed safely. With how low efforts Chad needed it was apparent. The ability to dispatch an A-rank monster solo. That only belonged to S-rank adventurers.

“Sir Chad, are you alright?” Edward rushed toward Chad with a big smile.

Chad on the other hand had a concerned look on his face. “The one who tried to bite the girl was a female, this here is a male…” Chad quickly turned around.

Upon hearing that, Edward’s face tensed up. He realized what was happening. The female was still chasing her prey.

SHIIII! The other crimson cobra appeared from the woods and leaped at the mage with a poisonous bite. Edward immediately screamed, “Behind you!” Throwing his blade at the monster.

Flash! A red light engulfed the place.
