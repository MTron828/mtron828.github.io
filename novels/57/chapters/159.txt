Cain woke up in the morning to find both Selena and Gracie sleeping by his side, She might have snuck in after he fell asleep. Usually, a situation like this might cause him a problem but he knew better, “Wake up.” The moment he poked her cheeks Gracie woke up and stared at him, if her hair wasn’t messy he would have thought she just laid there.

“What it-nya!” Selena meowed gently and stretched her legs, “It’s morning.” Cain said and she turned slightly turned to the right and saw Gracie. “Well, it doesn’t matter-nya!” They immediately woke up, Gracie hurried ahead to bring them a bowl of hot water and some towels.

Cain quickly washed his face and changed up while Gracie stayed to take care of the messy Selena. Her hair needed some work as did her claws, they had some blood in them from Cain’s back…He didn’t mind since the wounds could be healed easily with [Lesser Healing]

On his way down he met Olivia, she was still yawning with a cup of hot tea in her hand. “Morning, hope you had a restful sleep master.” She greeted him, “How about, don’t tell me you spent the whole night working?” Cain was worried as he could see the dark spots forming under her eye.

“Well, I kind of got absorbed in work and forgot about time. Before I realized it it was already dawn.” She laughed it off. The cold breeze sipped through the slightly opened windows.

“So how much did you make?” Even if she worked till down Cain could only expect ten to fifteen vials to be made. there was a set time for the chemical reaction.

“I made about forty, would you like to check them?” Cain linked a few times before gasping, “How?” Olivia looked at him not knowing how to answer. “I meant how did you make that much in such a short time?”

“Ah, that. It was boring to watch the experiment take place without doing anything so I checked the lab. There was enough equipment to carry out three experiments at the same time so I used them.”

Cain was shocked and disappointed in himself at the same time. Olivia’s efforts were admirable and his mistake of not making an extensive list of all the lad equipment shamed his pride as an enchanter.

“I guess I was right leaving everything for you, congratulation on becoming an alchemist.”

“No, no, I’m not. I was just imitating what you taught me, I understand nothing of the principles and how they work. I’m looking forward to learning from you in the future.” Olivia ended the conversation with a slight bow as she wanted to return to the lab as soon as possible.

Cain, then walked to Sebas’s office to as him to send a letter to Leon. “Say that I have a new weapon for him to deploy if he can pay high enough.” Sebas’s face tensed up as he heard Cain’s words. He had seen his master fight with Zaleria before so when he mentioned a weapon it was sure to be deadly.

“Can I as what it is?” Sebas asked with a drop of sweat on his forehead.

“Permanent petrifying potions, I had Olivia make them.” Even the basic, HP, MP, and SP potions were expensive. Let alone the rare effects which could be sold for an extremely high price. That was in part because the alchemists tend to keep their recipes a secret.

“I will send for him right away, I will make an urgent matter as well. Now if you excuse me!” Sebas rushed through the door, this was an important matter without a doubt.

After that Cain headed to the kitchen to have breakfast, sadly for him. His dinner was already waiting in the dining room. Sebas has instructed the maids to try and Have Cain behave like a noble by getting things prepared in advance for him. “All I wanted was to eat beside the fire,” Cain mumbled.

Shortly after Selena, Alice, Sofia, and Mary joined him. Seeing as they acted normally Cain decided to bury what happened yesterday under the dirt. They have concluded and he wanted nothing more than for them to be happy.

Zaleria was nowhere to be seen so he asked about her and it seem she got out early to discuss something with the druids, “She had told me that I wouldn’t understand even if she explained so…”

“Probably some magic stuff, don’t worry about it.”

Sofia understood what Cain meant by magic stuff, it was probably witchcraft or something. Cain can’t say directly as the maids are standing around. “By the way, Leon is coming soon, would you like to sit with us?” Cain asked Alice who was quietly eating.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“I was thinking of training a bit today, I would leave such a thing to you.” She replied, Cain hoped she had discovered something yesterday so he looked at all of them with his appraisal.

His eyes opened wide, all of them have leveled up, even Selena had risen to level nine. The plan have worked and What exited Cain more was Alice and Sofia. They have stat points to spend. The usual way is to go to the guild and spend them using their appraisal orb, but Cain is here, he will help them.

“I’m kinda surprised you all leveled up.” At that moment they turned toward him at the same time, Selena even dropped her spoon. “Don’t tell me you didn’t know…”

“How could we, were trying our best to stay alive so we might have missed the power surge.” Sofia said trying to feel her hands, she felt nothing different.

“Do you mean I finally got to level nine-nya?” Selena pushed her face toward him, “Yeah you did, all of you have risen by a level. Sofia and Alice are now at fourth level and have two stat points each and Selena you’re at level nine. Gracie is level three which is a massive jump, was she carrying you the whole time?” Cain said trying to look after Selena, Mary and Gracie who were silently eating from behind.

“Lady Alice was reluctant to fight and Lady Sofia seemed to get tired quickly.” Gracie immediately spoke. Alice tried to close her mouth but Cain laughed.

“Alice is a healer so it’s best for her to avoid fights, I don’t think Sofia was tired but lacking in MP. That’s natural for a mage fighting alone.” He said, noticing that Mary wanted to say something he asked. “Have something to say?”

“Ah, nothing.” She said dropping her head. “Don’t worry about it, there are a lot of common senses that don’t apply to us so you can say what in your mind.”

Mary hesitate for a moment and spoke. “Would you need me to prepare an appraisal orb to level Alice and Sofia? You said they have stat points.”

“I thought you would ask how I know they leveled up?” Cain lifted and eyebrow. “I learned to not do it, questioning your abilities might get me in trouble.” She replied.

“Fair enough, even they didn’t ask me how I do it.” As Mary heard his words she felt relived she did ask. “Answering your question, we won’t need that orb, I can level them without it.” Cain smiled as he extended his hand toward Alice.

“Sofia is a bit tricky so let’s start with you, I want you to put all of your points into wisdom, what do you say?” Cain asked Alice and she smiled, “I will leave the decision to you.” She said.

“Very well, touch my hand and close your eyes. when you see your own stats focus on the wisdom to level it up!” Cain said as Alice held his hand. As he was also looking at her stats he saw her Wisdom raise from 18 to 20.

Suddenly her eyes burst open, she gazed into the distance as if she had just gotten enlightenment. Her right eye glowed golden while the other glowed red, “They are the same, two faces for the same coin. I see now, we live to serve, and granting mercy was our goal!” Alice’s words Came strange to everyone except Cain, what she just said was the devil’s creation purpose, she seen to have realized the true meaning of devil’s life.
