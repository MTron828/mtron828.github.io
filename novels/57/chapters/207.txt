Cain glared at the hordes of undead and ghosts rushing toward the city, last time he was here he had to evacuate with the citizens. This time he had the power to fight back, he could feel a strange feeling of warmth in his chest.

He looked down toward the other side of the war and he saw Selena tearing the hordes of zombies like they were nothing. Enchanting her knuckle dusters with Alice’s holy magic was the right decision. Her punches cause weaker undead to disintegrate while the others get staggered.

He wasn’t able to get her to learn any magic but he was satisfied with her raw strength and endurance.

[Tell Takeshi and the other’s to retreat, I’m going to blast everything.]

[Wait, now-nya? Hold on for a moment we have to run away-nya!]

He could hear her panic, he can’t blame her because she knew what he was going to throw.

[Gracie, have you passed through?]

[Yes, Master. I’m at I managed to used the dungeon to safely move toward Ourals, what is my next move?]

[Secure the lord and his immediate household, If you can try and find solid evidence for the lord’s deals with Morena.]

[Understood.]

[Far step] Cain then teleported to the top of the city gate, he lifted his hands to the sky preparing to force two ninth-tier spells. He could feel his bones screaming that this was a bad idea, there will be a harsh backlash even if he used [Enchanting] to mimic the effect.

Sofia, Selena and Zaleria lined in front of the gate to protect it.

Opening her mouth wide, Sofia gathered all the Mana she could in her chest and released [Fire breath] VROOOOOOO! The guards at the wall had to cover their faces from the sheer heat, Edward who was there gasped, the useless mage he knew last month became unrecognizable to him.

The flames spread across a 100 feet long 50 feet wide, tearing everything in their way. All the zombies from Ourals army got turned into burned charcoal.

“Hey Cain, what was you feeding her this last weak? That was fairly close to an adult dragon breath!” Zaleria couldn’t help but ask him with how strong Sofia’s breath was.

“Nothing special, she is just that strong now.” Cain replied hiding the fact she was using his MP, this kind of breath would be impossible with how little MP she has.

[Sofia, cut down on the big moves. My healing won’t be able to keep up with you and the undead turning at the same time.] Sofia heard a warring from Alice.

Alice was no where to be seen, or to be clear, she was hiding. Even though it was a deadly war, Cain wanted to keep her identity a secret to prevent any future problems. Right now she was hiding in his shadow in the same way Spindle can.

[Fine, I just wanted to get this done with quickly.] Sofia replied, her was getting impatient since they spend a whole week doing nothing but fight monsters in death battles under Cain’s surveillance. The start of that week was fairly easy compared to what came after that, in her send fight she got one of her arms broken and at the third day at death door in a fight with demonic gorilla. It seemed that the deeper they went inside the forest the stronger the monster’s became.

The only one of them that seemed to have a slightly better time not having sent to death door was Alice. Her devilish body seemed to reduce the amount of pain she felt as well give her ridiculous regeneration and reaction speed. She felt more of a monster that a person like them.

…

After a while everyone returned to the gate. Takeshi, Yamauba, Daraku, Miko, Edward and his party, Lisa and some of her men, Leon who came to provide his support along side some knights, Sofia, Selena and Zaleria were already there.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Don’t let anything get close to the city until I finish!” Cain shouted at them from the top of the gate.

Zaleria slowly walked the the front cracking her neck, she had already gotten sick of waiting and wanted to let loss for a bit.

Takeshi immediately felt her magic swelling so he grabbed Yamauba and rushed inside the city. Seeing him run like that everyone panicked and made a run for it. She was about to do something stupid.

Her body swelled as she morphed back to her dragon form, her gargantuan body was several times taller than the wall. She spread her wings and used her claws to hold onto the ground.

Cain who was standing on top of the gate stared her hind legs, ~You know, do you mind getting you arse away from my face?~ He used message to talk to her since her head was too far away from him.

~Deal with it. I will be wiping everything in front of me, is that okay?~ She replied to him.

~Yeah, All the wild life in the mountain should be dead by now. It’s better to clear the undead and ghosts before they can reach us. Don’t forget to use [Seal of Holy smite]~

~You don’t have to tell med that~

Cain could see her chest shine with a bright red light as the flames gathered inside her, that light quickly turned into golden light as she used the seal. Normal people would just think that the light color has changed but Cain know that the very essence of her flames changed. From regular flames to Holy flames. It was the same concept with water with holy magic give you holy water.

As Zaleria opened her maw and Released her breath, the entire city shook to the ground, GRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! It wa accompanied with her ear shattering roar.

She aimed for the right and swiped with her breath to the left as if it was flame thrower. Clearing all the undead and turning the area a waste land of burned dirt and ash, surprisingly nothing exploded which show her great control even over such a powerful ability.

In the distance, only the dungeon Gate remained standing, “It didn’t break after all.” She snorted before turning back into her human form.

When Cain looked around him, some of the guards and adventure had shat themselves seeing the area around their city get cleared in the blink if an eye.

“Good now it’s my turn, everyone back down into the city!” Cain screamed as he was about to unleash his spell.

Everyone ran inside, even Zaleria didn’t want to take her chances with Cain’s magic.

Seeing them all inside, Cain took a deep breath. ‘Meteor Fall first, since it will give me some tome before the meteor can reach the ground I will follow it with prismatic dome to protect the city.

[Metero…]

A massive burning red rock appeared in the sky, It was headed straight for the city. Cain started sweating…His mind start to panic as this wasn’t his doing. His panic was enough to reach the girls making them shake, ‘Prismatic dome can protect from the blast but not a direct impact.’

When he looked to the dungeon gate at the distance, Morena was standing with a lich.

Morena started laughing, “Now you can’t dispels this can you?”

‘What should I do, what should i do… Meteor fall is a spell that create a massive rock, in the sky and accelerate it’s fall. Which mean that spell had already ended and I don’t have anything to dispel, it’s natural disaster at this point.’

‘Should I take the girls and teleport away? At least we will survive with that, there is no way we can save the city from this…’ Cain started to prepared his teleportation magic when he saw a red flash fly to the sky.
