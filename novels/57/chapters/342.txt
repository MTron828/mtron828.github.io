Sofia and Selena were watching Alice and Cain dance with interest. Neither of them could dance and they wanted to at least learn a bit. Otherwise, Cain might end up with fewer toes than he started with.

They quickly realized that Alice as well was just being guided by him. Thinking about it, she never had the chance to learn dancing. Most of her knowledge is a few words from Lisa earlier.

As soon as Cain released Alice’s hand, she spun to her standing place. The one who replaced her wasn’t the hesitant Sofia or Selena, it was Gracie.

Thud! Her movements looked sharp yet fluid, the moment her feet stepped onto the ground, her back bends slightly with Cain’s movements.

“You’re surprisingly good at this,” Cain told her with a smile.

“I’m a maid so I have to be the master’s training partner in dancing. We’re also expected to be able to dance as a form of entertainment for our master so there is a course we took.” Gracie replied with a lengthy answer which made Cain happy.

“I should have you dance for me later.” Cain smiled.

“As you wish, I was supposed to do that before when I failed my training.”

Cain remembered what she was talking about, He might have missed a great show.

“Well then, since you know how to dance.” Cain started moving with quick steps. What seemed like bold moves earlier as he was accommodating Alice’s lack of skills, is now a graceful and refined dance as he pushed Gracie’s skills to the limit. He learned dancing from the graceful elves, from the person he hated the most there. Surprisingly she was also a maid, her name was Farryn Caiqirelle..

“Master, aren’t you moving a bit too fast?” Gracie cried, her thighs felt sore quickly.

“You’re putting too much weight on your back and thighs, you will never match me like that. Step on your toes instead of soles.” Cain gave her quick advice.

Cain finally released her after a few minutes when she was about to drop from exhaustion.

On the other hand, since Chad and Ariel were dancing for a bit too long. A woman approached them dancing, she tried to switch mid-dance with Ariel.

To the woman’s surprise. Ariel chained a back kick into the dance and pushed the woman away with enough force to send her rolling.

“He’s mine!” Ariel growled at her.

“No, you’re not!” Chad replied to her instantly.

“Yes, you are, at least for this dance. The whole goal is to net let any hoes near you.” Ariel replied with a stern face.

Chad sighed, this was the reason he rarely summoned her. This angel can barely hold on to insulting other people. She once insulted a king calling him a big roast dripping with fat.

“Can you not insult people? That will get me and Cain in trouble.”

“Then keep dancing, the night is still long,” Ariel said as she grabbed Chad’s arm and started moving quicker.

After Gracie, it was Sofia’s turn. She was even more floppy than Alice. When Cain wanted her to move left, she goes right. Always going in the opposite direction.

Cain tried to adjust to her but failed each time, her moves were much unpredictable. The two of them had to end it soon when Sofia had already stepped in Cain several times.

Then it was Selena’s turn, she walked toward Cain with fearful steps. If those two did badly, she might end up being a disaster.

Each hair strand on her body stood up as she focused her hardest to avoid stepping on Cain. He could see her tail jolting up like it never did before.

“Let’s do this-gaw!” As if she was about to beat Cain.

THUD! THUD! Even Cain was surprised by her reflexes and coordination skills, she might lack grace and proper dancing technique, but she make for it with her brute speed and instinct.

Selena was avoiding Cain’s legs as the plague, the moment she sees him moving, she use all of her strength and speed to avoid him. To an inexperienced dancer, it will seem like Selena was the one having trouble slowing down to Cain’s speed.

“To think you did this well with just reflexes, you’re talented.” Cain patted her head which made her blush with a smile.

She then returned to the girls with a smug face. “Take that smug cat face out, we don’t need more salt on our wounds,” Sofia growled at her.

Marina slowly approached Cain as this was her turn, she suspects that her skills will be to her liking but she did practice dancing when she was a little girl.

The first thing that surprised Cain was that she was the one to start moving, her moves were fluid and quickly forced Cain to move and match her. He was slowly being consumed by her rhythm, it was then that Cain realized, she was a better dancer than him.

Marina was bringing her best game trying to impress Cain while he was sweating to keep up with her. Each time he tried to make a move and get to his rhythm, she pull a feint twist and abolish his plans. She wasn’t just skilled, it was as if she knew what he was doing and wanted to do.

“Who taught you to dance?” Cain asked, if she was this skilled, her teacher must have been a dancing monster.

“I don’t remember her name, I was young when she taught me. All I remember is that she was fairly tall with black flowing hair.”

Sadly no useful information, he wanted to get her to teach him so he can incorporate it into his skills.

After the dance, Cain needed a short rest it was taxing to tend to five women in a row. His hips felt sore and his head was spinning.

“Here, this might help!” When Cain looked up, it was Bela the ice witch.

“You didn’t put anything weird in it?” Cain asked as he looked at the green liquid. It looked similar to green tea but smelled different.

“Ice rabbit fang’s extract, harpy’s tears, and mint, I add some troll blood as well.” Bela listed what she thought was a normal list of ingredients.

“Potion of troll endurance? You’re skilled to be able to make this.” Cain smiled as he gulped the liquid down. Zaleria had made him drink worse in his past life and this potion was really effective. He instantly felt alive again and his muscle soreness disappeared.

“It wasn’t me, it was your weird Alchemist, I just gave her the recipe and she went and made a barrel full,” Bela said with a weird smile.

“Alchemist? You mean Olivia?” Cain asked, why did she need to call her weird?

“Her name is Olivia? She is a weird lass, obsessed with alchemy even. I found her mixing potions while in her underwear! When I stalked her, I found she starts working from the moment she wakes up to the moment she falls asleep, with a big smile on her face.”

Cain became concerned. “She must be overworking herself, I better order her to rest!”

“I wish I someone as hard working as her doing my alchemy tests, she is also skilled with her hands so you better treat her well,” Bela said with a smile.

Bela then stood and was trying to leave the ballroom. “Excuse me, my fair lady, would you care for a dance?” A young man approached her when she entered the empty hallway.

Looking at the hand he was extending to her, she could feel a bit of holy magic in it. He must be a cleric who felt that she was undead and is trying to confirm his suspicions. The moment she touches his hand, he will know she is a lich.

“Sorry boy, but I don’t fancy young men, besides Lord Cain.” Bela turned around and kept walking.

The young cleric wasn’t going to give up, he tried to sneak a touch onto her back and succeeded. The moment he felt that she was a Lich, Bela jumped with him inside the maze.

Thud! The young priest hit his face on the ground. “What happen…” It was then that he felt something stepping on his head.

“I hate curios rats, they always end up killed after spoiling the cheese.” Bela was looking at him with an evil grin. Her identity being exposed will cause so many troubles for Cain.

“What is a lich doing here,” The young cleric growled.

“Touching a lady without her consent is sexual harassment, is that a thing that a cleric should be doing,” Bela said as the cleric felt his body slowly cool down.

“I was investigating a potential threat, you’re not even human.” He growled.

“A potential threat? What a kid like you can do in a room filled with heroes? What made you think that a threat existed that lord Cain was just allowing around?” Bela knocked the cleric out.

“Lord Cain, this old lady has attracted unwanted attention. Would you please meet me quickly in the maze?” Bela called Cain immediately to see what they can do.
