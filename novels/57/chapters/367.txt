Both Cain and Nemmoxon appeared in the middle of the room, Zaleria was sitting on the bed having her hair brushed by Sofia. Alice was clipping her nails at the corner while Selena was relaxing in front of the fire. Mary and Hati were chatting over a cup of tea while Gracie was folding Cain’s clothes.

At that moment. Nemmoxon’s draconic instincts told her what they all were.

Both Zaleria and Sofia had the smell of a red dragon. Zaleria felt like a massive mountain while Sofia was a jagged massive boulder.

Just staring at Alice hurt her nose, the rotten foul smell emitting from her was a clear indication of her devilish origin.

She could almost sense nothing from the maid yet the cat girl at the fire was emitting so much blood lust the moment Nemmoxon put her guard up while still being carefree. As if she was telling her that she will kill her before she could make a wrong move.

Nemmoxon could sense two Fenrirs even though there was only one there. And the human girl next to her seemed weirdly normal, compared to the rest she looked too bland to be true.

Nemmoxon who just recently became an adult bronze dragon was terrified at the situation. The weird mage wasn’t lying, there was truly a red dragon in front of her. Their kinds only knew bloodshed, even if Nemmoxon didn’t attack, the red dragon will.

“A bronze, and a small one at that. What does she do?” Zaleria asked with a growl, this was the first time the girls saw two dragons interacting with each other.

“I need her to chase the Krakens out of the water, Bronze dragons are talented swimmers so she can help us greatly,” Cain said with a big smile.

“Chase them out? I can hold my breath for an hour while using my full power, with some of your magic and I can kill the Krakens at the sea bottom.” Zaleria growled, she was getting a bit protective. In her eyes, another dragon approaching Cain, especially a metallic dragon was a dangerous individual who could steal her spot as his partner.

“Your breath weapon isn’t suited for underwater fights and you won’t be able to use your full strength in there. She on the other hand has lungs that can breathe in the water, webbed feet, and claws, a powerful tail, and high-pressure resistance. Her breath is also lightning that is effective underwater.” Cain listed most of the common Bronze dragons’ traits.

“I see…” Zaleria stared at him as if not convinced.

“She can also transform into a dolphin and sneak up as the Kraken’s favorite food,” Cain said what he was hiding. He didn’t just want her to drag the Krakens out of the water, she was also acting as living bait.

CRACKLE! The stress was too much for Nemmoxon she started releasing electricity like an electric eel.

Cain immediately teleported her to the maze before he could burn anything, as soon as they were in a larger room, she turned back to her draconic form terrified. Sticking to a corner and hissed at Cain and the girls behind him.

“Even though she should be an adult dragon, she is scared like a cat,” Cain said with an exhausted face. She will be a handful to care for.

“Let me handle her for now, keep away for now.” Zaleria approached her.

“Don’t hurt her too much,” Cain told Zaleria before protecting everyone with a prismatic dome spell.

“You reds are always up to no good, what foul sorcery do you wish to accomplish?” Nemmoxon growled at Zaleria.

“Foul sorcery? Not just power, we reds only respect pure, unfiltered raw power.” Zaleria smiled as she transformed to her draconic form, she was almost twice as big as Nemmoxon.

Just at a glance, it was clear who was stronger. Cain smiled as he realized that even though she was just throwing guesses at the wall. The point of killing the Kraken was to create witch tattoos, which are in fact considered foul sorcery.

“Your kind is only a bane of ruin on this world, a foul creature of destruction who used the power gifted to them by god to stab him in the back.” Nemmoxon referred to how the dragon who killed the chromatic dragon god was a red dragon.

“She was our god and you have no business in that, we reds won’t take a god that we can kill, she was never a god, as a god will never be weaker than his kin. Look at his glorious red flames, the blood of the god slayers runs in my veins.”

Nemmoxon slowly changed from scared to enraged, Metallic dragons never liked the chromatic dragon god but they gave him respect. “Lord Bahamut will never let such an evil deed slide, a foul being she might have been but she was still a god. Justice will never strike those who disturb the balance of the world.” Nemmoxon leaped toward Zaleria at a blinding speed.

Opening her wings at the last moment she changed her direction and went toward the side. Opening her mouth, a powerful lightning breath flashed toward Zaleria.

THUD! Seeing Zaleria’s massive body twist and weave around the lightning bolt was nothing less of a spectacular show.

Puff! Zaleria breathed a weakened breath at the Nemmoxon, she was trying not to hurt her as Cain said.

“Weak, are your size just for show?” Nemmoxon growled, “ROAR!” A shockwave breath blasted Zaleria’s flames back at her.

BAM! BAM! BAM! Leaping from one side to the other, Nemmoxon rushed at Zaleria with a claw strike.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Thud! Zaleria grabbed Nemmoxon’s hand and then gently pushed her from the chest. “Come on, hit harder, faster, and infuse your claws with lightning. Your draconic element isn’t just for a breath, it’s to be used by your whole body.” Zaleria growled as red flames started emerging from under her scales.

Swoosh! In an instant, Zaleria’s massive body got propelled toward Nemmoxon with a powerful jet of flames. Flames started exploding from Zaleria’s body a blast after the other, making her like a flying, exploding bomb.

Nemmoxon could do nothing but run, Zaleria would just tank her breath as she was bigger and stronger, and approaching her to dang near impossible in that stat.

​ “Zaleria, stop doing that as you might damage the maze. If you can’t fight calmly then I will do it myself.” Cain called her suddenly.

“You fighting her?” Zaleria stopped and stared at him, she knew that Cain was strong but he surely didn’t want to hurt her, right? “Then how about you let Sofia deal with her?”

Sofia gasped as her name was brought up suddenly, she wasn’t confident in her ability to fight Nemmoxon alone.

“I can’t do that, she might be weakened now on land but she is still a bronze dragon. I don’t want to risk Sofia’s well-being.” Cain said as he walked out of the prismatic dome.

“Sofia isn’t so weak that she will get killed,” Zaleria growled.

“I don’t want her to get a single scar, is that a problem?” Cain glared at Zaleria.

Turning back to her human form, Zaleria smiled. “Fair enough, deal with her on your own then.”

Cain smiled, “I want you to follow my orders, understood?”

Hearing Cain’s words Zaleria didn’t understand what he wanted but she was willing to play along.

“Well then, you promised to serve me if I tamed a red dragon right? Miss justice-loving bronze dragon that will never break an oath or a promise.”

Cain had his usual evil smile, he was about to use Nemmoxon’s own ideals against her. At first, he just intended to bribe her with food but this is good as well.
