The family stared in awe as they saw the bandits run away from the strange man. The father instantly knew they were dealing with a high-rank adventurer, no normal person could send a man flying like that. Yet there was something familiar about this man, he felt that he has seen him before.

Kayden stared back at them with a keen eye. He knew who she was. “What brought you here? Stray wolves are usually the ones to get killed easily.”

The father rushed toward him and bowed lightly, “Thank you for saving us, we never knew they were thugs.”

Kayden knew that it was better to leave. They didn’t recognize him since he wasn’t transformed but that will be different soon.

“Well then, see you later.” He turned and started walking away.

“We were looking for the Lisworth mansion, by any chance do you know where we can find it? We heard it’s quite famous.” The mother called him back.

“She is right, we were invited to a wedding but seem to have lost our way.” The father added up.

The little girl knew there should be bad blood between Cain and Kayden so she was hesitant to support her parents. “Father, I doubt he knows about it. Let’s ask someone else.” She told her father with pleading eyes..

Kayden stared at them, “I’m heading there, please follow me.”

“That’s the same things those thugs said.” The mother commented.

“If I wanted to rob you, I would have already done it. You don’t have to be wary of me, at least for now.” Kayden said with a slight sadness in his voice. He could see the cute puppies they were, but he would have to kill them if they started to bite.

After a while, Kayden had walked them to Cain’s mansion.

“Is this the place? It’s big.” The father said looking around, the mansion alone was several times bigger than their house. He was a farmer and could tell, that those plants in the garden had a caring hand tended to them.

“HEY! TWIN-TAIL!” Kayden yelled from the door, he didn’t remember the maid’s name only her hairstyle. In his eyes, she was a dog with two tails that looked unique and memorable.

“Sister’s name in Lexi, don’t you remember it?” The little girls gave him a disappointed look.

“Who is there?” Sebas poked his head from the window and saw Kayden, “Isn’t it sir Kayden, what do you need?”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“The maid named Lexi, I found her family lost in the city so I brought them.” Kayden patted the little puppy by his side.

“I see, I’m coming right away!” Sebas rushed in to call Lexi and prepare a place for her family. As per Cain’s orders, all the maids’ families that attend are to be given a room and have all their needs tended to. No one is to be neglected.

After about a second, Lexi poked her head from the window and her face paled upon seeing Kayden stand beside her family. Gracie has told her everything and she knew he was the demon from her village. He might have turned the resemblance of a new page but still, his standing with her family was nerve-wracking.

“I’m coming right away, Lady could…” Lexi turned toward Alice but she was already giving her the green light, “You don’t need to ask for my permission, go.” Alice smiled at her.

Lexi then rushed downstairs.

Cain had warned them before, that Kayden is somewhat safe but is unstable. There was no way to tell what was going on in his head and triggering him by mistake was more like than none.

When Lexi walked outside, she saw her little sister hanging from Kayden’s arm and laughing while he had a confused look on his face. Her parents were just giggling in the background.

“Tina what are you doing!” Lexi cried as she rushed to grab her little sister from Kayden. What she was doing is poking the tiger’s tail and not knowing it. Lexi also didn’t know that Tina knew about Cain’s true self.

“Tina stop bothering him!” Lexi yelled at her, “Sir Kayden, Master Cain should be waiting for you in the men’s room.” The safest bet was to throw him at Cain. She wouldn’t be surprised if Cain yelled at her later for it but keeping her family safe was her priority.

“I see, please take care and don’t let them wander around the city unattended, it’s dangerous,” Kayden said as he started walking away, feeling relieved the little puppy wasn’t hanging to his arm anymore.

“Sir Kayden, thank you again for saving us!” Lexi’s father bowed again. God knows what might have happened if he didn’t save them back then.

…

CRIIIK! Kayden slowly opened the door just to be surprised by a bottle flying toward his face.

After effortlessly catching the bottle, he recognized it to be an ale bottle. “Are you drinking in the middle of the day?” Kayden asked what should normally be asked.

Chad and Takeshi were having a drinking competition while Daraku and Cain were trying to stop them. Takeshi was too much for Daraku to handle and even Cain wasn’t able to force Chad to budge.

“Kayden, help Daraku take the ale from Takeshi. I will be able to handle father on my own then!” Cain cried.

Chad seemed fine, downing a bottle after the other but Takeshi was already getting pretty wasted.

“That’s a big boy, Leave him to me!” Kayden was seeing Takeshi as a burly pitbull with Daraku being a slender dachshund trying to pull him away by the tail.

The moment Kayden started getting serious, Pitbulls are a dangerous and powerful breed. He transformed immediately, his six eyes emerged, and as much surprising it was to Cain, Kayden had grown an additional pair of arms.

Six eyes and six arms, the spitting image of the demon god Ashura, also known as the harbinger of destruction and Chaos. Cain could remember that Amaterasu said something about Ashura in the fight against the earth dragon.

Thud! With a single pull, Kayden carried the massive Takeshi up with only two arms and started walking away. When he struggled, Kayden used his remaining two arms to block. “Calm down or you won’t get any treats!” Kayden said.

Takeshi lifted his arms, and with hiccups, he said gently “GI!” In that instant, Kayden felt a massive pressure above him, THWACK! In a swift move, Takeshi Kicked Kayden away.

“Caught you-maaaa!” Kayden found himself laying on top of a big woolly sheep. It was Alaric who was watching, they were lucky that Edward already left to catch some ladies with Reith.

[Sleep] Takeshi instantly fell on his face asleep and a woman opened the door.

“Thank god you came Yamauba, please take your muscle-bound idiot with you!” Daraku said with an exhausted face.

[Sleep] “You as well, Miko have been worried sick you might cause troubles.” Yamauba said with a playful smile.

Kayden immediately shifted back and stared at them.

“Well this is the men’s room, didn’t expect to see you here?” Cain said as Chad sat still.

“I was to tell you that the carriage is ready, get out sir groom!” Yamauba smiled.
