“It’s gone, even though high-tier potions failed to get rid of it.” The guild master Annabel gasped, quickly shifting her gaze toward Cain and Olivia.

Cain wanted to laugh, he looked at his resistance as the answer was clear there.

—————————–

<Resistances><Retract>

[Magic resistance] Granted by the high MP capacity.

[Illusion resistance] Granted by the 20 Intelligence.

[Spirit resistance] Granted by the spirit stones.

[Disease Immunity] Granted by the abomination body

[Mental resistance] Granted by the high human mind

—————————–

The [Magic resistance] can carry over to potions since my blood is dense with Mana, also the [Disease Immunity] will be carried over through blood albeit temporarily. Some sages say that immunity is carried through small carriers in blood.

‘The combination of those two has erased and healed the sickness affecting her senses. But I do wonder why [Intoxicated body] remained’ Cain though, as Annabel was glaring at him, he was holding his chin with his hand and staring back at her.

“You two, this potion…was it the Magic water or his blood?” Annabel asked with a worried voice. If it was the magic water that mean she has made a good deal, and if it was Cain’s blood that means he wasn’t normal. Should she really let someone like him walk out normally?

“Probably a bit of both, and a sparkle of her skills.” Cain pushed Olivia ahead, “I doubt anyone could replicate what she made.” His original goal was to just get her into the guild but at this rate, she might become a rising new alchemist.

“T-that isn’t true, you can do it too.” Olivia stared at Cain and he looked at her.

‘Can’t you stay silent for a moment? I’m trying to make you sound like a rare gem.’

“Who taught you alchemy? I did see your work and your hands moved as if they mixed that potion hundreds if not thousands of times.” Annabel asked.

Sadly Olivia didn’t catch Cain’s signs for her to shut up and ended up giving unneeded information.

“Master here is the one who taught me, he is far more skilled than me,” Olivia answered and Mary was about to smack her down.

“Then would you mind joining…” Annabel looked at Cain and was about to ask him when they heard knocking on the door.

“Guildmaster Annabel, I’m the kings’ messenger on behalf of the marine, I request entry immediately. I need the papers regarding the transfer of potions signed as soon as possible.” A strong voice spoke steadily from outside the door, he clearly stated his identity and purpose and sounded as serious as soldiers can get.

“Fine, get in quickly I’m busy with a more important matter,” Annabel replied. She wanted to just sign the papers and get done with them quickly, Cain was more important in her eyes right now.

“Who is this stupid thing that is more important than an order from his majesty?” The soldier pushed the door open and looked around the room trying to see what the important thing she was dealing with is.

As soon as his eyes fell on Cain, he started sweating. “Please excuse me, Lord Cain, I will wait outside.” Bang! Closed the door.

His heart was about to leap from his chest, the last thing he expected was to see Cain and Mary there. After seeing Cain fight, he was certain the man was more dangerous than a whole army. And Mary despite being a normal girl, she jumped into hell and dragged two people from it. The last he wanted was to mess with those two monsters.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Why did the king’s arrogant messenger run as soon as he saw you?” Annabel stared at Cain, she started to catch up, and something was off about this man. The first thought in her mind is that he may be an illegitimate prince who was hidden due to his unique blood and only the higher up in the military knew of his existence.

“Ask him yourself, he should be able to explain it better than me,” Cain told the guild master, she might not believe him if he was the one to say it.

“Call him back,” Annabel ordered the receptionist to bring the soldier inside.

After he stood before her. “So, care to explain to me who he is? He said you could do it better.” The guild master glared at the poor soldier.

The soldier looked at the smiling Cain, “Don’t worry, I just want her to hear it from your mouth.”

The soldier took a deep breath and looked at the guild master, “He is someone whom we cannot offend, a person who can lift the whole castle and swing it around.”

‘I see, he exchanged the aboleth for the castle but I would have to disagree. The castle is too heavy, I might be able to lift the main keep alone though…’ Cain thought.

“He is Cain Lisworth, The white mage who saved Furberg and is able to use ninth-tier magic. And has solved the crisis of the last day.”

The guild master started sweating, she heard about him but didn’t expect to see him this close so it slipped her mind. “What is someone of your caliber doing here?” She stared at Cain.

“As I said before, I’m trying to register her as an Alchemist because she is talented,” Cain replied with a smile, once again pushing Olivia ahead.

“Get her papers done quickly, make sure to register her as a special case, and give her all the privileges our guild can provide. Make all her transaction through us anonymous as well.” Annabel instantly gave her instruction to the receptionist who rushed immediately to get them done.

From that point on, Annabel was considering her words carefully. The man in front of her was a monster, if even his blood had such a potent effect, she could deduce that his claimed strength was real.

Cain sat on the chair as Mary and Olivia went down with the receptionist to register. “Hand her your papers, she should be able to get them done.” Cain said with a smile, “Is it for the injured soldiers?” He asked.

“The foot soldiers, we Marine are fine since we had our stock filled. It’s a part of the relief efforts the king was mustering for the injured of yesterday.” The soldier explained as he handed the papers to Annabel.

The guild master quickly signed the papers and handed them to the soldier, “They should be done.”

“This might be rude of me to ask but. How strong is Lord Cain?” Annabel asked with a serious face, hearing that he can throw the castle didn’t seem like a reasonable fact.

The soldier looked at Cain and he got a nod, he was allowed to speak his mind. “At the base strength, at least we marine won’t fight him. It’s not an order or anything, it’s just that every soldier who saw his strength will know it’s an impossible fight.”

“What I wanted to know is a quantified description of his strength.” Annabel started at the soldier, she still couldn’t imagine Cain in a fight.

“You tread dangerous territory, no army will march into a tornado. He is just like, an unstoppable force of nature. Don’t tickle the dragon’s tail unless you get burned!” The soldier said as he turned around and left before he could say anything that would anger Cain. He wasn’t going to risk everyone’s safety to amuse the curiosity of a single woman.
