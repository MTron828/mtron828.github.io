A maid’s main job is cleaning, cooking, and giving medical care when needed. Those of them who signed the contract to work in bed have that job as well. A personal maid’s job is to never move from the side of her master and take care of anything related to her job.

A servant’s main job is carrying, working, and supporting when needed. Those of them who signed the contract to work in bed have that job as well. A personal maid’s job is to never move from the side of her master and take care of anything related to her job.

Let’s say a noble is trying to write letters of invitation to meet. He would ask his personal maid to bring them tea while he and the personal servant write the letters. When he goes to the bath, the personal maid will get in with him while the servant will go pick his clothes up before going in as well. If a noblewoman was giving birth, Her personal maid will be helping her deliver the baby while the personal servant will be heating the water and bring the towels.

It was accepted that the housemaster can lay his hands on both his personal maid and servant as well as his wives’ personal maids and servants. If the housemaster was to sleep alone, Both his Personal maid and servant would be sleeping in the same room.

Besides being a luxury job with ridiculous pay, it was always sought off because of how close it can get someone to powerful people. This country’s high queen was just a farm girl three years before attaining her position.

The king has met her on one of his expeditions on the road. He was inspecting the farms when she approached him with a towel and a bucket of water. His guards would usually kill anyone who approached him without warning but with the king’s orders they backed down. She asked if she could clean his boots in exchange for a small price and he accepted.

She had asked for 10 gold coins which was a ridiculous price. The guards yelled at her that she should be grateful with a single silver coin. Yet after she finished, the king paid her a hundred gold coins and asked her to never do something like this again.

As he was leaving, he asked her if she wanted to get in the carriage and she accepted and asked him to wait for some time. The guards got furious again, with her brazen attitude toward the king.

The king yelled at the guard telling them to respect anyone that he hasn’t gotten angry at yet. She rushed back toward her home, dropped the money with them, and left.

She quickly raised in ranks from a mere servant to a maid, to a personal maid, and lastly to a queen in just three years. Her whole family was given the rank of Barons with their own land and in the fourth year, she was expecting the king hier.

That had made the maids who work in the royal palace hold immense power to the point that it became a costume for the noble to bow to them. They could be speaking to the next year’s queen and not even know it.

For short, If a royal maid was to come here, she have the legal power to sit on William’s seat. Normally the messenger would stand in front of the city lord, but the lord would have to be the one standing if the messenger was a royal maid.

Cain is intending to take over Ourals after this mess so he might as well be a king in his own domain. By that time, and depending on how much influence he might have, these maids working for him are going to have a lot of power. That’s without counting Sylph and the elvish kingdom that is the strongest in the world.

Right now, with how Sylph regards him. He is the elvish king, despite being a human. If that truth was revealed to the world. With the human being from the weakest of races. Lexi, one of Cain’s maids, could very well have the current king bow to her.

Politics are complicated.

Cain looked back at the girls in front of him. Gracie didn’t know how much strength she had. Imagining her growing stronger and stronger, Cain got the idea to create a special force that resembles what William did. With what he knows, he can get her to a level where she can compete with the shadow assassin Mauzzkyl Jaezred.

Cain stretched his arms and stood up, “Let’s hurry, we have a rough time ahead of us.”

“What are we going to do exactly?” Alice asked.

Cain then explained to them what they intended to do, what monsters there should be in the area, and how he intended to make his way to Furberg.

“To reach Furberg by foot will take us about two days, with how slow we will be moving, it will take us about four without rest,” Cain explained.

“Wait, four days without rest? You mean we will fight from when we wake up until we sleep?” Sofia asked with a worried face.

“We won’t be sleeping, If we wanted to reach Furberg in time and stop the catastrophe,” Cain said with a straight face.

“That would be impossible!” Alice cried. “I can do that-nya!” And Selena seemed to not mind.

“I’m not going to lie to you, this is going to be painful and draining. You will cry a lot, but we don’t have time to slowly level up and get stronger.” Cain said as guided them to the changing room. Without asking for permission, he started going through Sofia’s Items.

“What are you doing?” She grabbed his head as she saw him pulling her underwear out. “Sorry, but I had to find those!” He showed her what was in his hand, her four rings.

“My Mana regeneration rings? Why do you need them?” She asked with a puzzled face.

“There are four rings, and four of you. It matches perfectly!” He said, “Do you mind if I got them back, I want to change the enchantment and divide them between you.” Cain asked.

“Well I don’t mind, I already let Alice test them once so I don’t mind sharing. What is the enchantment you want to use?” Sofia asked, both Alice and Selena nodding after her.

“As you might have guessed, I have a ridiculous amount of MP. My main Ability is granting magical properties to non-alive objects. You might not believe it, But my main ability is not magic and I’m not supposed to be fighting in the front, I’m a supporter, an Enchanter!” Cain explained what he is, as this was important to the way they will fight from now on.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It’s hard to believe, you’re far stronger than other people,” Sofia said shaking her head.

“She is right, You said that demon was level 16? You fought him as an equal at level 7.” Alice said she had seen how Kayden ended up fighting Cain. She had no doubt about how strange he was.

“Then to make it short,” Cain gripped the rings in his hand and they emitted a bight glow.

[Enchanting: Link] Create a magical link between the enchantment caster and the ring holder.

“With those, you can share my MP. When you’re own MP is about to run, you will automatically start sucking from mine.” Cain took a deep breath, “You don’t have to worry, I have enough to last you weeks!” Cain said with confidence but that was a lie.

There are three ways to regenerate MP. Drinking blood, swallowing souls, or directly absorbing it from the air. If the last one was used a lot, you might lose your natural Mana regeneration. That was huge as it not only meant you will not be able to recover MP naturally. It also meant that if you reached 0 MP and passed out, you will never wake up until someone forced you to drink an MP potion. In a lot of battles, it’s a death sentence.

‘We don’t have time so I have to do it.’ Cain thought, ‘I will forcefully regenerate my MP for them to use, then I will be the only one to suffer the consequences later.’

“Even if we had all the MP in the world, we will need to rest-nya!” Selena asked, being the only one to not need MP.

“Don’t worry, having an abundant of MP makes you need less rest, you will be able to hold no problem!” He assured them, and that was a lie. All the exhaustion from them will be transferred to him, he will then dump it onto Sylph. In simpler terms, he will try sucking her SP and distributing it to them. She wouldn’t like that, and Cain knew she will be furious. Even though she was his slave and she like pain a lot, he wasn’t keen on torturing her like this but this was an emergency.

“With this, we will have those links set up!”

[Sofia]-[Cain] one link

[Alice]=[Cain] two links

[Selena]-[Cain] one link

[Gracie]-[Cain] one link

“I will also be absorbing Alice’s holy magic through the binding link to distribute it.”

“Hold up, it’s getting a bit complicated for us, Can you explain it better for us?” Sofia interrupted him, he didn’t need to explain to them in detail. He just needed to tell them what to do and they will be happy.

“Each one of you will wear a ring, they will ease your exhaustion, give you access to my MP, and as well allow you to heal with Alice’s holy magic. You can also talk through me but it will have the negative effect of Allowing me to hear your thoughts.” Cain handed them the rings.

[It’s shiny-nya!] Selena’s thoughts flowed through his head.

[I finally got one, it’s that was from Sofia thought.] Alice’s thoughts came quickly. ‘Sorry but we just didn’t find the elvish silver early. Dolrig is making some for you right now!’ Cain thought as he heard her thoughts.

[I hope everyone is safe back at home.] Sofia’t thought was gentler than he thought.

[…Master will get cold if he stayed half-naked like this…] Gracie’s thoughts were a bit muddled but they were nice. Cain quickly started wearing his clothes.

“The rest, I will explain on the way.”
