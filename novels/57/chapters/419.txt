Cain walked into the bath with Klara behind him, he needed someone to wash his back but he couldn’t feel any of his wives in the mansion. “Where did they go?” He asked taking his shirt off.

“Lady Selena went back to her village a few days ago, Lady Sofia and Headmaid Gracie just followed her yesterday. Lady Alice has gone back to her home just an hour ago, Lord Leon seems to have called her.” Klara explained the situation to him as short as he could.

“Why did he call her?” Cain asked.

“He seems to have hit his leg with a hoe, tried to work with Leyla Lloyd to show off but failed.” Klara sighed, everyone knew that Leon was a mage what was he expecting to happen?

“That must be painful, then what about Marina and Mary?” Cain opened his arms to let her undo the buttons on his shirt. He failed to open them.

“Those are actually available, I asked Sebas to call them from Ourals keep. They will join us soon.” She replied, struggling with Cain’s buttons. “Where in the hell did Alice get those from?” She growled. The holes were too small for the buttons, making it a nightmare to take them off.

Giving up, Klara used her teeth to tear the buttons open. They could always get them fixed and made easier to take off. “Ah! You smell like a newborn baby!” Klara gasped as her nose was close to Cain’s chest.

“I did get that comment from Lexi, do you smell babies?” Cain asked with a worried face.

“Lady Lisa was the one to supervise our training, she said to always smell the baby to check if it has bled. Sometimes when the birth is hard the baby gets stuck and his shoulders might snap, we smell and inspect for any irregularities.” Klara explained.

Cain gave her a dubious look, he was sure you should be able to tell those by just looking or touching. He wouldn’t judge as he knew nothing about helping a woman give birth.

As Cain lost all of his clothes, he helped Klara take hers as well, this was the second time he saw her naked but only now he realised.

She was taller than him, thin, with green eyes and a long flowing hair that resembled that of Alice. She also was in the habit of always painting her nails black.

“Is blond hair common around here?” He asked, suspecting something to be on.

“What do you mean?” She looked at him with a questioning gaze.

“You hair and overall look is similar to Alice.”

“We both grew together after all, I was the daughter to a traveling merchant who was passing by the city. Lord William offered me the job of a maid when I was just three years old.” She explained.

“Is he working children now?” Cain wanted to kick that man in the face.

“No, it wasn’t a real job. All I had to do was live with my parents in the mansion and play with Lady Alice, a thing that I would without it even being a job.” She explained, she got paid to do what children do, play and have fun all the time.

“Where are you parents?” Cain asked. A bit worried about the answer.

“They are our neighbours, I can get home just by jumping over the fence!” She smiled, scrubbing Cain’s back as hard as she could.

“Tell Sebas to open a door for them then, they are welcome here anytime they want.” Cain said with a smile, He wasn’t going to shunt his maid’s family.

“I will do, I’m sure sister will be pleased to play in a bigger garden.” Klara smiled.

“Little sister? Just tell her not to harm the plants, Jemima will tie her to a tree if she did that.” Cain giggled.

“I’m done, let’s get to the hot tub!” Klara said.

“No, sit there I will help you wash as well,” Cain said giving his chair to Klara.

“No, please don’t mind me.” She gasped but Cain grabbed her shoulder and pushed her down to sit. “You can’t get in the hot tub without washing so sit down!” He started scrubbing her back. When he was done, her pale white skin have turned bright red from how much force he put in.

“I think I’m cleaner than the soap itself, couldn’t you been a bit gentler?” She sighed.

“Sorry, I was used to the girls so I miss calculated the force I needed.” He replied.

He then slowly walked with her to the hot tub and relaxed there, she was sitting beside him with her arms on the tub edge.

CRACK! The door opened, and Mary, Marina, and her twin maids entered the bath and looked around. “Cain, having fun?” Mary waved to him.

“Heating my bones a bit before having a massage, how are you?” Cain felt a bit sad, they didn’t seem that surprised to see him well. Guess they expected him to be fine, it was both comforting and sad.

As the girls started washing, Cain stood and lay on the ground, “You can do it,” He told Klara.

“Of course, I would start immediately.” She stood up.

…Cain suddenly felt her stepping on his back with quite a bit of force causing his shoulder to crack. “I feel like this isn’t the first time, who taught you maids to step on me?” Gracie did the same before when he asked her for a massage the first time.

“It was Miko, said she learned it on their way here and Daraku seemed to like it,” Klara said with a smile.

“Well I’m not him, use your hands,” Cain replied immediately.

“That won’t do, I will do it like this.” She surprisingly refused.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Fine, as long as it has an effect.” Cain honestly didn’t care as long as it relieved the stress on his shoulders.

After a while, the girls finished washing and walked to the hot tub.

“How long do you intend to be stepped on by a maid?” Mary asked with a small vein on her forehead.

“I don’t know, she is the expert so ask her.” He pointed toward Klara, all he could tell is that her technique is working so he didn’t intend to stop her. He is a man who would take extreme action to achieve his goals so no matter how strange the method is he won’t question it as long as it’s effective.

“She should be done soon.” Marina who was quiet for a while said.

“You know?” Mary glared at her.

“Yes, I used to have the maid do it to me a lot. It relieves stress well. Those two are experts.” She pointed at the twins.

“Can we help?”…”Should we help?” The twin asked squatting in front of Cain and staring at his shoulders.

“Don’t squat close to my face!” Cain growled lifting the two maids with [Telekinesis], “You help Klara if it will get things done faster.” He drooped them beside him.

“What was that?”… “We flew!” The twin maids looked at each other with a surprised faces.

“The simplest of his magic, be careful as if you displeased him, the whole city will get blown off!” Mary warned them, they were stepping on a monster and she could feel it, this wasn’t the same Cain from before.

“We will be careful!”… “We will get it done quickly!” Twin jumped in to Help Klara.

‘My strength and dexterity increased a lot in the evolution so my muscles and joints are sore…this might help relieve the pain but it’s hard to breathe with then stomping my back.’ Cain thought realizing the catch. They were using their legs since they lack the strength in their hands to match his muscles.
