Energize and Prepare

They stopped just a little after dusk, preparing to camp by the roadside.

Due to the constant movement of merchants and adventurers, monsters started to rarely show up by the roadside. That had made the road considerably safer by night.

As Dolrig pulled the leash to stop the horses, Cain quickly jumped out followed by Selena. Before they start setting up the tent, they needed to scout the surrounding area for any monsters that may be lurking around.

“Bring some firewood with you, it’s getting a bit cold,” Sofia said as she saw them about to leave. She quickly began the preparation for dinner, taking the griffon’s leg and cutting it into small pieces.

Alice on the other hand helped Dolrig feed the horses.

After about half an hour the two of them returned loaded with firewood, to the point where Dolrig questioned whether they were scouting or not.

Lighting the fire was easy, Sofia just used [Bonfire] a spell that she never got to use before.

After roasting the meat, it was as chewy and gamy, enough for Dolrig to compare it to old leather.

As to be expected, they were exhausted from the trip and wanted to sleep right away. Cain will stand as a guard for the first half of the night and Selena after him since they are the only two with decent senses.

Dolrig was to sleep alone in a small tent while leaving the wagon to the girls, It could fit the three of them sleeping side by side.

“Sofia, stay up with me for a while. we have something to talk about!” Sofia’s thoughts went wild as she heard that, looking at the glimmering flames.

“I don’t mind, what’s on your mind?” She asked, sitting closer to him. Awaiting for him to make a move.

“You have leveled up, do you want to get the third enchantment today?” He asked, completely erasing her fantasies. Cain was thinking about what enchantment he should give her, more MP storage is tempting just as cost reduction and limiters.

Now that she has a fast MP regeneration thanks to her enchanted rings, going for an MP storage seems the most reasonable for him. More MP, more magic, more damage, meaning better.

She is now a Level 3, which means that the next time she levels up she is going to get 2 stat points. As much as it is bad for his health and sanity, Cain intends to have her put them in Charisma. With that, a limiter would make sense, lowering the passive effects of her charisma.

Also, unlike Cain who is waiting for Level 5 to use third-tier magic, she should be able to use it at level 4. He might have to teach her before he could use it himself.

Cost reduction is redundant with low-level spells, It only shows reasonable effects above sixth-tier spells.

There were still a lot of other enchantments, Right now he is going to focus on making her stronger.

“Do we have to do it here? Can’t we just wait until we reach Ourals?” She asked, not wanting to scream in the middle of nowhere as she might wake them.

“Don’t worry, The one I have in mind this time doesn’t hurt that much!” Cain then explained to her how does the MP storage buff work.

The enchantment gives her an extra 10 MP storage per level, she is level 3 so she will get 30 MP. Each day she has to refill it from her MP, this buff isn’t useful if you have low MP regeneration. Now that she has the ring’s enchantment, she could refill the buff in a bit over 7 minutes. regularly it might even take the whole day.

Sofia agreed to take the buff here, it didn’t make sense to wait if it doesn’t hurt.

The buff location is the middle toe of her right foot, spreading the enchantments so she won’t lose them all at once in a fight.

The right-hand middle finger: decreases spell level requirements buff.

The left-hand middle finger: Store first-tier spell [Firebolt] now has 3 charges.

The right-foot middle toe: MP storage now has 30 MP.

Sofia recalled her buffs, in just well over a week she has gotten several times stronger than she was. It was all thanks to Cain pushing her again and again.

Sofia looked up at him and was about to speak when he put his hand on her head. “Go rest, we have a long day tomorrow.” His words made her reluctant to speak. After staring at him for a moment she replied. “Yeah…” Silently going inside the carriage to sleep, keeping her words for a more suitable time.

Cain was left alone, sitting beside the fire, polishing his sword.

Time quickly passed by and it was time to wake Selena up. Cain slowly entered the wagon to find the girls stacked on top of each other like sardines.

“Is it time-nya?” Selena woke up as she sensed movement inside the wagon, surprising Cain as he was trying to be quiet.

“It is, but do you mind not sitting on Alice’s face?” He said, pointing at how her lower half was almost choking Alice. She quickly stood up as she heard him.

After waiting for her to wash her face and wake up completely, Cain lay beside the other two girls and fell asleep.

Selena spent the rest of the night prowling around the camp, taking down anything that moves.

The morning quickly came by, Selena was the one to start waking them at dawn. The threads of light have just started sparkling on the horizon making a breathtaking scene.

It was a beautiful scene if not for the smell of blood covering the whole place. Cain wasn’t worried as he could see Selena’s sparkling eyes as she guided him toward the campfire.

There lay two dead deers and three rabbits, Selena has hunted them around the camp in her shift.

Dolrig was surprised when he saw that, wondering how they got there. He had assumed that they were killed by a monster due to the fang marks on their necks, he was surprised to know it was Selena.

“We can’t sell them like this, they would assume that they were killed by monsters. We have to skin them first, take the part that has the fangs holes.” Dolrig suggested. He was right people won’t buy any carcass with bite marks on them.

Even if they were told it was Selena, who would buy a piece of meat that someone else took a bite from?

Cain and Dolrig quickly started butchering them, when the girls woke up they started to help as well. Before long they had a heavy breakfast full of meat.

After feeding the horses and cleaning up, Cain put out the fire with [Create water]

They resumed their trip, quickly spotting Ourals in the distance resting at the side of a mountain. Just like Forberg, It was fully enclosed by walls. With fields as wide as the eyes could see.

As they admired the city, Cain spotted some dust rising close to the gates.

“Dolrig, what is that?” Cain asked, he could see it well as it was far away.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Probably some reparation.” He replied, that it wasn’t clear to him either.

A few minutes passed by, and the dust cloud didn’t seem to fade, they were closer so Cain noticed it was moving.

“Maybe it’s a fire, It happens quite often.” Dolrig probably had worse eyesight than Cain due to being in the smoky hot forge all day for years.

Cain just brushed the thought from his head, It was as Dolrig said, probably just fire, they will put it out soon.

Slowly, Selena could hear screams in the distance so she informed Cain. That dust cloud wasn’t fire, but most likely adventurers fighting some monster. It was weird, they are taking too long.

Could the situation be dangerous? If a strong monster was attacking the city it was best to stay away for some time.

“Cain, are they fighting a monster? Should we help?” Sofia asked, worried that some might die with how long that fight is taking.

“If it takes that long, the monster is probably strong. I don’t intend to risk your safety for people I don’t know.” Cain declared that his girls well being took priority.

Sofia looked at Alice as if asking what should they do. Selena didn’t care that much, she was just sitting at the top.

“Cain come here for a minute, Selena you as well!” Alice called them inside the carriage for a short talk.

Alice and Sofia want to help, Cain didn’t want to, and Selena didn’t care. In the end, the decision was a 2 one 1 in favor of helping.

Cain simply scratched his head, thinking about what they should do. He still could tell them ‘No, is No!’ and they won’t argue further. That was probably the best decision to keep them safe.

“I’m going to get back at you for this.” Cain patted their heads as he changed his mind, they were going to help.

“Dolrig, Speed up!” Cain shouted.

“Understood, but I will keep my wagon a safe distance away.” Dolrig whipped the horses with the leash, they are going at full speed.
