Cain followed Zaleria while Alen stayed in the guild to pack his things. Cain did tell him to stay for the wedding but Alen only nodded and replied that he will try to attend.

Cain jumped from the window and used [Fly] to his surprise, Zaleria was also flying with her flames.

“Let’s hurry. I want you to see it as soon as possible.” Zaleria said as she flew toward the bath and Cain followed her.

After a while, they landed in front of the bath. “Wait, this is the local bath. What did you find in here?” Cain asked.

“I don’t want to sway your judgment, It would be better to see for yourself.” She knew that Cain was smart and calculated but she didn’t want to tell him what she felt. She might be wrong and end up misleading him.

After taking only a few steps inside. Zaleria suddenly felt a sharp burst of magic coming from Cain’s body. It was as if he prepared a ninth-tier spell for a moment and then stopped. That burst of magic had made her scales shiver.

“Calm down. He isn’t here anymore.” Zaleria said as she patted Cain’s back.

“I know now, feeling its magic scared me for a second. Damn, I was about to suck everyone into the maze.” Cain said as he created a small portal in his hand.

Zaleria looked at him in shock. The shiver she just felt was from him trying to suck her into the maze. That means that everyone must have felt it.

“Cain!” Alice emerged from his shadow, she had already transformed into her devil form. She was leaking both holy and cursed magic.

“Master!” Gracie quickly jumped from his shadow as well. She was holding her two daggers and glaring around for any movements.

“Return immediately and tell the other to calm down, this was a false alarm.” It wasn’t just Zaleria and those two who felt Cain’s magic. Everyone else who had his mark felt it. The maids and Sebas included, everyone, got the same chilly feeling.

“Are you sure?” Alice asked as she slowly looked around. To her mind, it was unthinkable that Cain would freak out like that without a reason.

“It’s nothing, the monster already left so you can rest easy. Now hurry and head back.” Cain sent the two of them away and glared at Zaleria.

“Next time tell me beforehand. Suddenly feeling a great wyrm presence out of nowhere is no joke.” Cain quickly turned around and felt the magic again. It was weak and fading but it clearly belonged to a great wyrm dragon.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I didn’t expect you to react like that. I did imagine you smirking at the great wyrm and then snuffing it out with a single spell.” Zaleria laughed as she remembered the wyrm earth dragon that Cain sealed with a single spell.

“Are you joking? With dragons, each age category is a bigger boost than the first.” Cain scratched his head. He wasn’t overreacting, he had fought a great wyrm before in his past life.

In that fight, Cain had fought a fire dragon. That monster kept moving in [Time Slow] as if it was nothing. Cain also tried to seal him with [Imprisonment] but the fire dragon burned the seal before it can be completed. He only managed to win with the help of Sylph and the elvish army.

Cain and Zaleria then walked toward the basement and checked the room.

“It’s the same one that blasted the mountain top. It was living here after all.” Cain said as he inspected the lock with detect magic. It was the same creepy feeling, this dragon’s magic was awfully similar to that of Sofia.

Cain wanted to hit his head on the wall. There was no way this magic belonged to Sofia. Comparing them was like comparing jalapeno to a concentrated hot sauce. They both are spicy but not on the same level.

After that Zaleria showed Cain the journal she saw found. She pointed at it from afar and warned Cain that the thing was fragile.

Cain looked and read what was written on it.

“It’s been 50 years. I finally met him again.” Cain scratched his chin.

“The dragon might not have been waiting here, as this only specified time. Whoever it met, it couldn’t be good. I bet it was one of the dragons it killed at the mountain top.

“Are you sure about that?” Zaleria asked.

“Of course not, I’m not that dragon to tell. This might even be written by someone else.” Cain replied with an annoyed face.

“You’ve been living here for longer than I. Do you have any idea who the dragon might have been?”

“I can only think of the bath owner. That old lady was living here alone. But I’ve seen her countless times and never felt anything strange.” Cain said and then stopped.

‘Hold up, if it is a great wyrm then it might be able to hide its magic to an extent…No, those were advanced skills, he only knew of two people who could hide such a strong aura. He and Sylph who he taught.

They then spent another hour inside looking around but found nothing more. The dragon had burned everything nicely.

After making sure they forgot nothing, Cain and Zaleria left the place. Cain was getting mentally exhausted as he still hadn’t rested. His new abomination body might not need that much rest but his mind still does.

When Cain got back home, his eyes were already itching. When he entered, Klara saw him and she approached him. “Master are you alright?” She asked him while staring closely at his eyes.

“I’m just a bit exhausted. I will take a short nap in my room.” Cain yawned.

“Sorry but we were just cleaning it, you can use any other room if you wanted.” Klara bowed slightly. Alice had told them to fix Cain’s room so they were working on it. She tried to guide Cain to one of the girls’ rooms but he fell asleep on one of the couches.

Seeing him like that Klara tried to lift him up but she wasn’t able to. Feeling that she needed help, she rushed to get Gracie and the other maids, they had to carry him upstairs to a suitable bed.

When Gracie arrived she started at Cain then at Klara. “You could have just carried him,” Gracie said with a cold tone, Cain wasn’t that heavy so two maids should be able to carry him with no problem.

“You don’t expect me to carry him alone, also I wanted to get your opinion on where to put him,” Klara growled at Gracie, she didn’t seem to care about who is the Headmaid and who is not.

Gracie tried to lift Cain, it was then that she felt something strange. He was heavy, too heavy from what she remembers.

“Selena, I need your help,” Gracie called Selena for help. Something was going on with Cain’s body again.

Selena jumped from the window using her claws, “What are you doing my lady!” Elsie who was watching to the side cried as she saw the prestigious window frame be scratched.

“Nya?” Selena turned toward her with a confused face.
