Time quickly passed by as they ate and drank, quickly it reached midnight and Cain retired home with Selena followed by the other girls. He did have more important things to take care of.

“Master, the bath is ready,” Gracie said after being informed by one of the maids. Cain smiled and looked at the other three, Shall we take one? “What I’ve been waiting for.” Alice stretched her arms, her sleeves were soaked in blood as she healed people even after the feast.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“My legs are hurting, a hot bath would be nice.” Sofia quickly jumped toward the bath, Cain looked at her with a smile as Selena patted his shoulder. “I too need one-nya.” She was right as both she and Cain were soaking in sweat, they have exercised too much.

As Gracie walked by their side they quickly walked inside, Cain didn’t notice the two figures walking behind them. Gracie did but since Cain didn’t seem to care she ignored them following as well.

Since they were all inside Cain quickly tossed his clothes out and Helped Gracie strip the girls as they did seem to take a bit of time, Cain was thankful that Sofia took her jewelry first otherwise it would have been near impossible for him to start at her.

“Let’s hurry-nya!” Selena dragged them to the showers as she wanted to get rid of the sweat smell as quickly as possible, her nose was starting to itch.

“You two, get in quick,” Gracie said to the other two, She wanted to change quickly as well and get inside. “I was keeping my body heat in check, boiling your master would be bad, isn’t it?” One of them replied and Gracie nodded. “A boiled master would be bad.”

“You don’t say, I’m thinking twice about getting in. I wonder if it will seem weird if I got in as well.” The other said grabbing a towel to hide her body.

“Whatever you decide, Make it quick!” Gracie replied as she pushed the two inside and closed the changing room door, her under-suit was soaking in sweat from moving too much.

Inside the shower, Cain and the girls quickly scrubbed themselves, He and Selena cleaned each other while Alice and Sofia did the same. Alice noticed that Cain had regained his muscles quickly, his slender body now had more tone to it.

“You seem to be recovering well,” She said caressing his chest. “You as well seem to be putting on some weight.” Cain sneaked his hand to her shoulder.

“I’m not getting fat!” She grumbled. Cain laughed and pushed a hand to her chest and another to her thighs. “Let me correct, not weight. You’re getting some mass and I like it, Being too skinny isn’t that good!” In Cain’s eyes, Alice was slowly getting thicc and he very much liked it.

“Cain, it’s my day-nya!” Selena quickly pushed Alice away and jumped at Cain scrapping her chest on his. “You’re a different kind, look at you!” Cain cried as he tickled Her belly, and an eight-pack immediately appeared as she tightened up.

Sofia who was watching them smiled as she grabbed Cain’s hand and put it on her chest. “Let’s get in the hot water first and then you can talk!” She winked at them.

At the hot tub Cain sat stretching his arms up, today was an exhausting one and he had gained a lot of exp. Sofia sat on his right and Alice on his left while Selena was on his lap. Cain immediately relaxed as he grabbed the two girls at his side from their thighs.

The girls closed their eyes as well, taking only the physical sensation felt great. Alice and Sofia quickly found themselves resting their heads on Cain’s shoulders. Selena on the other hand rubbed her lower side on him. It was a moment of bliss that didn’t last long.

“The water is a bit cold, don’t you think so?” A strange voice asked, “No it’s good!” Cain mumbled. “Heh!?” A woman gasped, the voice was familiar so Cain didn’t get alarmed immediately as he was enjoying his rest.

“What, never seen one before?” The other voice replied to her and Cain could hear her trembling. He slowly opened his eyes. Directly in front of him was a face that seemed familiar, ‘I thought Sofia was to my side.’ Cain’s exhausted mind functioned slower than he could have ever done. “Move a bit, let me see.” He pushed his foot in between the mountains and dragged the woman to the side, she did move without resistance but then just stood to the side looking at him but Cain did not bate her an eye.

The woman trembling in front of him while failing to hide her body with a towel looked familiar enough. It was then that Cain’s mind slowly started to work again, he had relaxed too much and now a slow panic was building inside his head.

The woman standing in front of him was non-other than Mary, what in the hell brought her here? He then noticed that her eyes were fixed on the girl at his side, It was Alice in her devil form…

“Kya!” Mary screamed as she felt a zap of electricity shock her from her feet up. She immediately dropped her tower and staggered backward. At her neck, she found a Fireblade, and Cain was nowhere to be seen. The girls immediately got Alarmed by the sudden surge in Mana released by Cain and they immediately attacked.

Mary who had just seen something horrific found herself in a worse situation. Cain was holding her hands behind her back while keeping a blade to her neck. The devil she just Saw was now grabbing her forehead while Selena has her claws poking at her throat. Sofia was standing to her side with a ball of flame in her hand while Gracie poked her with a dagger in her side.

Mary’s body shivered even more and she was about to leak when she noticed the situation she got herself in. The lord’s daughter was a devil? Sofia clearly wasn’t using a catalyst so she was a witch? And those fangs and claws clearly don’t belong to cat people. She looked toward the woman who entered with her as if asking for help.

“Don’t look at me, I don’t know what going on” The woman replied and Cain finally looked in her direction, he sighed at the fact he didn’t notice her. It was Zaleria, no wonder her back end looked familiar.

“Can you half transform?” Cain asked, the girls quickly noticed Zaleria and they were in shock at how familiar Cain talked with her in contrast to his reaction to Mary.

“Does your disrespect have no bound?” She growled remembering how he pushed his foot between her legs. “It’s your fault for getting in without permission.” Cain was already used to seeing her naked, so he didn’t really feel anything from her.

Zaleria scratched her head as she half transformed, Two thick black horns rose from her head, and a pair of red leathery wings emerged from her back as a thick scaly tail adorned her lower end. Patches of red and black scales spread across her body like moles and her nails grow into curvy black claws. Her eyes changed to that of a dragon and a barf of flame escaped her mouth.

“What brought you here?” Cain asked tightening the grip on her hands. She trembled and looked at Zaleria, that body didn’t belong to a human, it was that of a Dragonoid just as described in the guild’s documents.

Mary felt the strength drain from her legs as her mouth opened and closed like a fish gasping for air.
