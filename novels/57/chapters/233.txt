“What brought you back?” The big man spoke with a deep voice. It was more akin to a roar than human speech.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“It’s been a while. I brought my husband to visit.” Selena said with a proud smile. Cain, Kayden, and Zaleria were the only ones who could tell that her body was ready to attack at any moment.

“The black-haired one? He smells foul but I can give you that he is strong.” The man growled.

Selena frowned. “The white-haired one at the back is my husband! Don’t go making assumptions!” She was not happy being put together with Kayden. The veins started to pop up in her arms.

“That bean sprout? He wouldn’t even qualify as launch.” The man growled as he looked at Cain. He was right that compared to him and Kayden, Cain was too thin. That was to be expected as he is a mage and not a fighter.

“Her muscles and blood flow are rising. If that man did a single wrong move, she will kill him on the spot.” Zaleria said with an intrigued smile.

“She has grown stronger than last time we fought, what did you do to her?” Kayden commented.

Cain looked at the man. I should apprise him. As he thought of that, something happened.

Thud! The man disappeared. His black body flashed toward Cain before anyone could react. However, in truth, two were already aiming for the man’s life.

When his claws were closing on Cain. He could see Kayden’s blade slowly approach his neck. From behind Cain, Zaleria was already opening her mouth with a burst of flames.

Selena was rushing from behind to stop him. She looked both enraged and worried.

[Lisworth’s resilient Sphere] Cain blocked the four of them in place. Killing one of the Black jaguars was bad. “Calm down. We’re not here to fight.” Cain said as he glared at Zaleria and Kayden.

“You do seem to have some tricks.” The man growled.

Crack! Zaleria just poked the sphere from the inside to break it. She had 30 strength so such a feat was easy for her.

Kayden swung his blade flawlessly and Sliced the speed Cain put in immediately. “This can be annoying.” He mumbled.

Selena and the man seemed to be finding it a bit hard to Crack their spheres.

Crack! The man broke free first and he lunged backward doing a couple of flips. It was a spectacular sight. Seeing his massive body move like that.

“It’s time for the second round. This time…” As the man was taking his stance to lunge again. A woman that looked similar to Selena but a bit older landed behind him.

“Dear, I told you to wait for me!” She growled at him. She grabbed his head with her claws.

He looked flustered for a second. “I-I did wait, it’s just that you were slow.” He growled.

The stare in her eyes grew cold. She started tightening her grip and a drop of blood trailed down the man’s forehead.

“Ara! Ara! Are you by any chance referring to me?” She growled back at him.

“No, you just misheard me.” The man quickly stood and freed himself from her hand. It was clear that she was a bit angry with him, but she was not keen on hurting him.

“I will just teach that bean sprout a lesson!” He looked at Cain. Suddenly his vision darkened and he fell on his face.

[Sleep] Cain pointed a finger at him. [Telekinesis] The man’s body started to float. “I will carry him. Nice to meet you, I’m Cain Lisworth a mage.” Cain flew from the carriage using [Fly]

The woman smiled, “I am Selena’s mother Elena Bowen. This meat head is her father Seith Atlanta.” The woman smiled.

Selena finally broke free. She was waiting for Cain to release her while he thought she would just break the spell on her own. “Mother, why didn’t you stop him?” Selena rushed toward them flustered.

“You know I’m not as strong as him, he was out before I could notice,” Elena said putting on hand on her cheek. She stole a glance at the asleep Seith. His tongue was dangling as Cain lifted him into the sky with Telekinesis. A smile crossed her face.

“Let’s talk back at home. This isn’t the place for a conversation like this.” She smiled and turned back. Cain noticed that she was about to run on four but then settled to walk on two legs. She was thinking of her look in front of her daughter’s husband.

Cain then looked at Seith.

Surprisingly, they are both weaker than Selena. Even though the father looked stronger, he will lose in terms of stats.

After that, they followed Elena to the village. The moment they got close.

“What happened to Seith?” A man jumped from the guard hut and yelled. He was surprised to see his friend float unconscious in the sky.

“Selena had returned. He picked a fight with her husband and ended like that.” Elena replied to him. It was just them when the man looked at Selena.

“Now that you said it. Is that Selena?” He seemed surprised to see her. Was her appearance a bit different? Cain wondered.

“She is. She had grown a lot didn’t she?” Elena smiled.

The man then started toward Kayden with a worried look. “That man seems dangerous. His smell is foul!” He growled.

“Ara! How rude, look at the woman behind them.” Elena said. The man’s gaze slowly turned into his eyes met with Zaleria. He needed to look at her for a moment before smelling it. She smelled of sulfur and pumice, ash, and smoke. The fine fur on his back stood when he realized the creature standing behind them.

“A-a red one?” He gasped. If Kayden was dangerous, she was the danger. A natural disaster that should not be provoked.

“I hope Seith was just as smart as you, he would have been turned into ash if Selena’s husband didn’t save him,” Elena said.

Earlier, Zaleria was intending to kill Seith for attacking Cain. She only stopped since Cain stopped her.

Elena sighed as she walked toward their home. The village looked more like a tribe than a human settlement. They lived in wooden huts that have been built just to ward off the rain. They spent most of their day hunting or working outside.

Elena laid pelts for them to rest on. As they rested, Cain laid Seith down and woke him up.

Seith jumped up in fighting mode, “Where am I?” He gasped.

“Home,” Elena replied.
