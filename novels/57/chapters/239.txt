It was a whole other week for them to reach the outskirts of the Fenrir village. Cain spent those days looking for the best way to mix the high human with the abomination.

The conclusion is that he needs to evolve into a high human first by absorbing a lot of Mana. And just before his evolution to a high human could end, he need to initiate his evolution into an abomination.

This was a dangerous process to take when doing an investigation so Cain started it in the middle of their way toward the Fenrir village.

He started slowly compressing Mana inside his body using the lumps of dead tissue left in his body by Alice’s curse. He coupled that with the constant consumption of Mana potions. This had kept pushing his Mana over the limit.

His body had started to naturally adapt and evolve. In the same way, he went from a human to a Mana enchanted human. He was now slowly going to become a high human.

Yet there was one problem, this process will stop if he went below his max MP. This means that he needs to refrain from using high-tier magic.

“I sense three. This is going to be bad,” Zaleria said as she jumped from the carriage. She quickly looked around with a worried face.

“Ice, fire, and lightning. But I can’t tell their age.” Cain said as he tried to feel the same magic Zaleria was feeling.

“Don’t be naïve, those aren’t dragons. It’s the Beast god’s tails, three of them are raging!” Zaleria yelled. “The reason you can’t tell the age is that they don’t have it. The situation might be worse than anything we expected.” Zaleria yelled again.

The earth suddenly started to shake violently, AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! A loud howl boomed in the sky as a massive-nine-tailed silver wolf emerged.

“The rage of the eternal Ysgard shall fall upon your existence. Fang by fang and blood by blood!” The wolf howled as his massive body pulsed with enough arcane magic to make Lily want to puke.

[Earth wall] Cain created a small wall to prevent their carriage from being blown away, this was the worse time for him to be evolving.

“Is that the beast God?” Kayden asked as he pulled his sword. “Their magic match, but I never knew he could take this form. They don’t even share the same name.” Cain ask he tried his hardest to appraise the beast raging in the distance.

“That is the real beast god Fenrir, not the man who was his vessel!” Zaleria said as she transformed into her half-dragon form and used her fire magic to create a shield around the carriage.

Alice, Sofia, and Selena held tightly to the wooden frame to not be blown away by the strong winds.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Shit! Are we late then?” Said Cain in frustration, he should have rushed here immediately after clearing the catastrophe. It has already been too long since the Guildmaster told them that there was trouble in the Fenrir village.

‘I will need about a day to fully evolve, should I stop the transformation and fly to him now. Even if I did that, Can I stop such a monster?’ Cain thought in frustration. When he was about to stop his transformation, two bodies came flying and crashed nearby.

“What was that?” Alice yelled as they surprised her. For a moment, she thought it was an attack.

“No wait, Guildmaster?” Cain yelled as he recognized one of them. That old man was unconscious and bleeding from his nose and mouth.

The other body was someone that Cain didn’t recognize, it was a silver-haired woman that belonged to the Fenrir tribe. What was strange about her was that she only possessed one tail instead of nine.

Unlike the Guildmaster who was unconscious, she was still awake and painfully stood. “One, One more time…” She growled as another eight tails were slowly trying to grow from her back. They then immediately faded as she fell on her face exhausted.

“Zaleria, bring them to the carriage!” Cain screamed so she can hear him. [Earth wall] He created a cover for her to move.

“I can hear you without screaming.” Even though it was a mess with all the violent wind and Fenrir howling, she was still Zaleria and had her incredible hearing. “Abut thanks for the cover, which will give them more protection.” She flew to grab them immediately.

AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! With another loud howl, the beast god Fenrir disappeared as if he was never there. Cain could feel the dimension magic he left behind.

“Heal them. The fight isn’t over, the beast god had moved whoever he was fighting to another dimension like my maze.” Cain said as he checked on the Guildmaster.

“Mana depletion? What was he trying to do there? It’s rare for a mage of his experience to reach such a point.” Cain said with a puzzled face. The first rule mages learn is to make sure they never run out of MP. Someone of the scale of the Guildmaster should know that. The fact that he ran out shows just what kind of crazy battle they were having there.

“Is she alive? Her presence seems weird.” Kayden asked. He had already transformed into his demon form and was ready to fight. “She has the same smell as the blond devil.” He added.

Cain looked at her. He can see the ‘?’ mark the system is giving. That meant that there was additional information that only his appraisal could show since they were deliberately obscured. In Alice’s case, it was the nature of her existence that case the information to be obscured.

This time it was different. Cain had a strong feeling it was the beast god.

‘No wonder she only had one tail, there are two souls living in her body. The beast god had even named them both.’ Cain thought. For further information, he had to wait for them to wake up.

[Lisworth’s magnificent Mansion] “Take them inside to rest. I will go with Zaleria to check on the Fenrir village. Kayden you guard them here.”

“I won’t. I’m here to chase that accursed Cubus, I will not sit still.” Kayden replied as he started walking away.

“Just wait here, I will lock them in the pit and send them to you. They will run the moment they sense your presence so you will never catch them.” Cain told him.

“I can hide my presence,” Kayden replied.

“Not from Meliliana, she knows you well!” Kayden stopped in his track upon hearing that.

“Very well, but her head is mine. Don’t you dare kill her!” He growled. Gracie was staring at them from behind, the entire abyss was gleaming in her eyes.

“Good. Zaleria, let’s go!” Cain flew away and Zaleria chased him.
