As the night approached, the ballroom grew quitter as the guests left one after the other. The maids asked Cain if they can start cleaning the place, it was a long day.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Cain smiled, “No, you can go and rest. This ballroom is located inside the maze so I can use them.” Cain lifted his hands to cast a spell. He was to simply override the ballroom with [Lisworth’s Magnificent Mansion] so he can utilize the ghost servants to clean the place.

The place got quickly filled with growling ghosts, the maids called them spectral servants as they thought they were just a part of Cain’s magic. Unknown to them, those were actual ghosts, undead.

As the maids left to rest, Cain ordered the ghosts to wipe the place clean. Collect any item that didn’t belong to Cain in a box and take note of all the items that were lacking. All of that information where to be reported to Cain or Alice in the morning.

After that, Cain’s work wasn’t done yet. He dismissed the maids to rest so he had to find a way to prepare for tomorrow’s feast. Since Cain didn’t know much about cooking besides grilling meat, he asked a group of ghosts to visit the frozen room and prepare the gorgons for cooking.

As he saw everything sitting in place, Cain felt a bit proud of himself. He got married, is far stronger than in his past life at this time and the future is looking bright. It was then that he remembered, that bad and good always came together.

‘I should be careful, everything is going too well. Even the dragons are awfully quiet. Should they have at least sent a scout?’ Cain’s anxiety started rising. Those dragons might have already made their move.

Cain shook his head, Zaleria should have already sensed them if anyone got too close. They might have changed their plans to focus on the elves more than him.

Cain then walked out of the maze and headed toward his room, he wasn’t exhausted but a bit sleepy..

As soon as he reached the door, he could hear the girls chatting and laughing. It was rare for the five of them to spend a night together like this and he didn’t want to ruin their time.

~Alice, should I leave you alone this night~ Cain asked her with [Message], he knew they will not tell him off if he just walked in. ~If you like to have a girl’s talk or something~ Cain added.

Alice who was surprised to hear his voice thought a bit before replying.

~If it doesn’t displease you, we want to chat a bit with Marina and teach her the ropes. She is still a bit nervous around you so we want her to calm down~ Alice replied

~Then I will leave you to it, I will spend the night with father or somewhere else. Just make sure she doesn’t kick me in the face when shove comes to push~

Alice giggled, ~calling it to shove comes to push. Don’t worry about that part, she is more worried about you leaving her in favor of someone else~ she said.

~Self-esteem problem or guilt? I believe it was clear that she isn’t responsible for any of her father’s deeds and I’m sure I never called her on her look~

~I find it amazing how you’re considerate yet don’t understand girls~ Alice smiled, ~she is comparing herself to us, thinking that you value strength more than anything else. With how weak she is, she thinks you might leave for a burly maid as per her words~ she explained.

~I do value strength but not to that extent, how is she thinking that~

~That’s what we want to understand this night and find a solution for. Since we want to get down the night after~

~Then I will leave you to it, make sure the five of you get along~ Cain smiled as he cut the conversation.

Cain started walking down the stairs in the dark, his eyes glowing as he was testing some spells. Magic was his hobby after all and Enchanting was the ability he has to play it. At the moment he was tinkering with [Darkvision] in the hope to increase its range or make color distinguishable.

Diana saw him walking down and she froze in place, the stair was dark and she could only see two glowing blue eyes. She tried to back down but she tripped and fell on her back.

When Cain approached her, she was on her back with her knees at her face. Her lower side is fully
