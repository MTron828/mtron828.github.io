Cain left the maze as it was, he wanted to make a quick trip to Dolrig’s shop to pick some things and come back. The last time he was at his shop, Cain put an order for a new batch of jewelry, which can go well in making the girls even stronger.

Cain did think he needed to enchant himself as well and not just them. As right now that he has reached the max level, he could not get stronger before evolving. In addition, he did not want to do that before investigating all his options. That high human seemed interesting and he was thinking if it was possible to mix him with the abomination.

Cain walked out of the arcane door thinking about what he wanted to create. He then created a ball of Mana in his hand and stared at it for a while, now that he has access to ninth-tier magic, he was finally feeling the power he used to wield.

Knock! Knock! He heard someone knock on his door; Cain was feeling a weak presence at the door and was certain it was not one of his wives. Alice, Sofia, Selena, and Gracie, now had an immense presence that is easily discerned from other people.

“Who is it?” Cain asked.

“It’s me, Olivia. I wanted to inform you that I run out of ingredients to make healing potions.” She replied.

Cain had to take a moment to think, he ordered many ingredients. For them to end in just over a week was ridiculous.

“He quickly opened the door and followed her to the lab to check on her progress.

He was stunned as he saw boxes over boxes full of healing potions. She seems to have run out of the Mana water he prepared.

“Tell me you were sleeping those past days, how in the hell did you make all of this?” Cain was stunned by how much he made, he could even doubt himself making such a large amount in a short time.

“I was sleeping at least eight hours a day. It was just fun making them and I started to zone out when working.

Cain inspected the potions; they were not of the highest grade but were decent, each one of them could heal 20 HP at least. The one he could create could heal up to 50 HP, which shows the difference in skill between him and Olivia. What she had over him was quantity, and speed of production.

“We have to move the lab to a better place, would you mind following me?” Cain said as he cast [Arcane Gate]

Olivia silently followed him into the hazy white door. The next thing she knew, she was standing with him in a completely white room.

“Where are we?” She asked in awe.

“A newly created ninth-tier spell, I call it Lisworth’s Infinite maze,” Cain said nonchalantly.

“Newly created? Did you make it? Is it safe?” Olivia asked as she could remember how destructive the last ninth-tier spell he used was.

“I don’t think it will blow up, probably,” Cain said with uncertainty, he was keeping an S-rank dungeon core in it after all. If that thing overheated, it could blow the entire city up.

“Nop, get me out of here!” She rushed toward the door, standing inside a ticking bomb was the last thing she wanted to do.

When she walked through the door, she found herself facing Cain again. “You can’t get out without me, stay and listen.” After running a few rounds, she finally decided to sit down and listen.

“This thing won’t blow up, that will require extreme circumstances. For now, chose any room you like and I will make it into an alchemy lab for you. There are a total of 512 rooms in here!” Cain spread his arms, this spell was still uncompleted, and he cannot call it a proper ninth-tier spell until the rooms are filled with monsters to defend the structure.

“You say chose, but they all look the same.” She looked around. All the rooms were white and looked similar.

“Then how about directly underneath the core, I can have that thing drip Mana water into a barrel for you to use.” Cain looked at her with an excited face. If she accepted to work here, it will mean that he can have easy access to her creation at any time.

“As long as it doesn’t blow up, I’m finding it relaxing to play in the lab so I wouldn’t mind a constant supply of Mana water.” She said agreeing to his idea.

As Cain guided her to the dungeon core, he was thinking of all the uses he could use this place could have. Storage, a trap, an escape route, a supply line, a prison, a training ground, an experiment lab…It was limitless, as long as he keep feeding the dungeon core.

When they reached the room, Cain asked Olivia to let her see the back of her hand. [Symbol] The spell stung her a bit but it was not that painful. It left a red mark on her hand that seemed like a serpent.

“With this, you can freely get in and out as you like. Feel free to have the other maids or workers carry the equipment here, and if you needed something, just ask Sebas to buy it.” Cain said. He wanted to hurry and go check on Dolrig, Olivia can use the rest of the day to move her stuff.

Cain immediately left Olivia inside and teleported out, quickly changing his clothes and leaving the house.

On his way to Dolrig’s shop he noticed something, all the people recognized him. In their eyes, he saw fear, awe, admiration, disgust, and pride in all things. He could understand all of their feelings. Fearing his power, awe-struck by his achievement, admiring his quick growth, disgusted at what he could do if so he wished and felt pride over living close to him.

Many maidens tried to make their moves on him but he gracefully dodged their leaps. Cain was baffled at their actions even though it was known he had at least three girls by his side.

Soon enough, he found himself close to Dolrig’s shop. Surprisingly, he found a long line of people waiting which seemed odd.

Cain respectfully stood at the end of the line to wait his turn and poked the last person. “Hey, do you know what is going on?”

“Who is it, don’t poke my back like…Whoa!” The moment the man saw Cain’s face, he stumbled backward falling on his arse. A hint of fear in his eyes, “T-the white mage?!” he cried.

The entire line turned around and they stared at Cain, what had brought someone like him here? And then they remembered the reason they were standing in line. They saw Dolrig deliver a sword to Cain right before the final fight, and they wanted something like that, a weapon that can stand up to a dragon.

In short, since the white mage used it, it must be good. That mentality started to arise.

It was then that Cain started to realize how far down the town went. There was even children and adult who started to copy his haircut and clothes. Now that he looked even closer, the women have started to copy the girls as well.

“I just came to take my order, don’t mind me,” Cain said with a smile, trying to seem as friendly as possible.

“No, no. no. Please go ahead, we can’t let you stand in the sun for an hour.” It wasn’t just that man, the entire line moved and allowed Cain to go to Dolrig first. Some of them were even thing of what disaster could happen if Cain got a heat stroke and then flattened the city by mistake. His skin was pale after all.

Seeing that he was only able to go with the flow, Cain walked straight to Dolrig’s workshop.

“Cain? What brought you here, I thought it was the bushy beard old man’s turn next?” Dolrig asked with a smile on his face.

“Don’t pretend you don’t know. The moment they saw me, they wanted me to go first.” Cain complained.

“Is it bad? You saved the city, after all, not a single sane person in this city would underestimate your strength after what you did.” Dolrig went to his storage room to bring a bag full of metal objects.

“What you ordered, plus some extra’s on the shop for saving the city.” The bag Dolrig handed Cain was heavy, “This thing weighs more than me!” Cain cried in surprise, his back wasn’t ready for such a load.

Dolrig started to laugh, “Is it too much for the great white mage? Should we call Selena to carry them for you?”

Cain dropped the bag to the ground and took a deep breath, “No need, I have some tricks.” Cain said as he quickly made the bag disappear into a shadowy mist.

As Dolrig’s eye widened, Cain smiled and said, “See you later, peace!” He then opened [Arcane Gate] and teleported into the maze.

People who were standing at the door just stared with their jaws dropped. He has just disappeared with the heavy bag in front of their eyes.
