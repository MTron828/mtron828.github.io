After making sure Alice was all right by giving her a quick check-up, Cain told her to sleep the night inside his magnificent mansion.

“Why, don’t want to reserve that for the night?” She poked his side. It was obvious that he preferred to use it for privacy at night.

“Your health takes priority, rest up there so you can relax. Don’t stress it and sleep as much as you need. As the ghosts for anything you need and they will get it done.” Cain flicked his finger opening a door, Lexi stood to go with Alice but Cain stopped her.

“Call Amaya, she spends the night with her.”

“As you wish.” Lexi bowed leaving the room to call Amaya.

Hearing her footsteps move away, Cain looked at Alice. “Rest in your devil form, Amaya shouldn’t be hurt by it, she is a zombie after all.”

“I know, she is a good storyteller so it will be fun.” Alice smiled.

“Girls’ night? I might join in.” Cain poked Alice.

Alice giggled, “You don’t know what a girl’s night is. This is just me wanting to hear some stories. But to be honest, you have more girls than you need tonight, I will bring Amaya in my turn.” Knock! Alice turned toward the door that she heard someone knock on.

After a slight delay, “Can I get in?”

“Of course,” Cain replied, it was Amaya.

‘Hold up, I thought there was only about a thousand undead at best. We weren’t killing that much’ Cain couldn’t believe that the level 1 Amaya had an undead army under her skirt enough to stomp a whole city.

“Where did all those undead come from?” Cain asked with a surprised face.

“I don’t know, their number just kept growing,” Amaya replied.

“Bela has been actively hunting monsters to bolster the army, I also asked father and Marina if they had any TRASH left by their cleaner and wanted a dumpster. Stepmom Lisa was thrilled by the idea, saying she could finally get rid of all the dead fishes.” Alice smiled, her evil smile slowly resembling a mixture of Cain’s evil smile and her father’s pissed grin.

‘I guess the Witch lich is Bela, I wonder how fast Cain they react. Better ask her.’ Cain flicked his finger and Bela appeared in front of him, she was naked and wet.

“Hey what’s your problem, I was in the shower! Unless…” The moment she tried to approach him with a strange grin, Cain tied her with [Telekinesis].

“Stop that, I just wanted to ask. How will the undead reach Amaya being attacked.” He glared at her.

“I won’t say I sate this type of play but…CRACK!” The moment Bela started wiggling her body like a worm, Cain snapped her neck with [Telekinesis] The fact she was with the ones who killed his foster parents stayed at the back of his head. He gave her no slack nor mercy.

“Speak, you’re undead so this won’t hurt you,” Cain growled. Such a wound to an undead was like a slap on the wrist for a human. Nothing to cry about.

“Fine, fine. I have a couple of pre-set scenarios.” Bela said as she started explaining. Cain gently snapped her neck back in place she can do it a bit easier.

First scenario: In a non-hostile city, a hostile individual, Amaya’s undead nature must be kept secret. A single humanoid undead with enough strength will spawn in a hidden place between the offender and Amaya if possible, close if not.

Second scenario: A hostile city, a hostile group, there is no reason to keep Amaya’s nature a secret. All undead will instantly spawn from under Amaya’s shadow, their order is to rip and tear until everyone is either dead or undead.

“I like the first one but the second is a bit more extreme, keep working on them.”

“Well then, I’ve been working really hard, maybe I deserve a bit of…” The moment Cain saw her extending her lips toward him, he teleported her away.

“Can’t you be a bit gentler toward her?” Alice asked.

“That’s her decision, she needs to calm down if she wanted me to be gentle.”

“Well then, I’m off to sleep. You also have a long night ahead of you.” Alice smiled as she walked through the gate.

Cain turned around and walked toward his room. His first brain was thinking of a way to separate Marina and Mary as Marina doesn’t like doing it with people she isn’t used to being present.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

His second brain was busy at work creating various plans to use to fight the rebellion at the capital based on his past life knowledge about the capital. He only came with a threatening and extreme show of force which he disliked.

The moment Cain opened his room’s door he saw Marina and Mary talking with each other. The twin maids were sitting on the couch with Klara having a quiet conversation.

“Cain, you finally came.” Mary smiled looking at him.

“Yeah, had to check on Alice, she is doing fine,” Cain said stretching his arms.

Klara rushed to take his shirt off him. “Thank you.” Cain then walked toward the bed and laid flat on his back and took a deep breath. For a few seconds, he processed everything that happened that day and opened his eyes.

“Marina’s first right?” He asked.

Marina and Mary looked at each other with worried faces. “Well…” Marina scratched her cheek.

“Yeah about that, it’s a bit complicated,” Mary added.

“The lady is worried you might leave her if she kept her shy side, she wants to do it at least once with the other ladies present.” One of the twin maids said.

“She is going out of her comfort zone so please don’t mind her grumbles. She’s been nagging us since the last time to make sure she gets this done.” The other maids added.

“I see, I will try and be gentle with her then,” Cain responded.

“Please don’t be, give her the usual treatment. Otherwise, she will nag on us later for not supporting her.” The twin maids responded at the same time.

“I understand, do you agree?” Cain looked at Marina and she nodded.

He then turned toward Mary who gave him a smile, “For me, it’s a bit embarrassing to say it by I’m scared. I want to do it but I can’t help but…” Mary showed Cain her shaking hand, “I might be a little bit too nervous”

“You don’t have to worry, I will be gentle. If you aren’t sure we can postpone it, at your own pace.” Cain gave her the option.

Mary was genuinely scared, not from doing it, but from knowing whom she was doing it with. She felt his true nature and the horror was still circulating in her head.

“No, I will do it. Just need a bit of support. And someone to do it before so I can get some courage.” She smiled looking at Marina.

“Well then, I will start with Marina and the twins, Klara can also join in if she wanted.” Cain said with a serious face.
