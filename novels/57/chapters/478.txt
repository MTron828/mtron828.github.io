Thud! Selena started rushing between the monster’s swinging her claws left and right. She was using her ultimate weapon, her powerful nose.

‘I can smell it, the big one sitting behind.’ She glared at a hole in the wall.

Twisting her torso and running on all four ignoring the monsters. Selena leaped into the hole and followed it to the end.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Upon getting out, she saw the massive titanic cobra-like monster with a woman’s upper torso.

~I can’t appraise it from here but the magic close to you belongs to an Echidna. Be wary, she has high dexterity and strength and should be ranging in the 25-realm.~ Cain called Selena to warn her.

“How do I kill her-nya,” Selena asked.

The Echidna moved slightly.

~Use message at least. Anyway, she should die like a normal human or a snake, go for the head and heart. But if you needed help, Gracie is there and she could finish it off easily.~

The cave was dark, they were only able to see thanks’ to Cain’s magic or their other senses. And if the cave was dark, it was Gracie’s playground.

~Let her try if she can-nya.~ Selena replied with a confident look, she was sure Gracie wouldn’t be able to take this monster on alone.

“I already did, you two kept talking.” Gracie emerged from behind Selena. Thud! The Echidna’s body fell to the ground and blood started splashing everywhere.

“You killed her-nya?” Selena looked toward Gracie.

“It tried to attack while you were talking, don’t let your guard down like this,” Gracie replied with a passive face.

The two of them returned to Cain after that, the small worms have already run away.

As they kept walking, Cain could feel the cold magic intensify, Bela’s daughter was close.

“Let’s hurry. She is close.” Cain said and started to walk faster.

Slowly, they started to notice the acid around them being frozen. There was no magma in sight. Cain wore a worried face.

“She might have become an elemental. Talking to her is going to be hard.” He said stopping in his place.

“We can always beat some sense to her. Don’t worry.” Zaleria said with a smile.

Farryn glared at her “We won’t do that, it will only make things worse.”

“No, Zaleria is right. Even if she had gotten some mental trauma from living here. That can easily be fixed with a [Dominate Person] spell. I can even use a harsher procedure with [Synaptic Static] but that would kill her. After that, she should be fine.”

[Dominate Person] clear the target mind so they can be easily controlled. Cain intended on stopping halfway. When in a clear mind status, the target should find it easy to face his fears.

It’s the reason that dominated people don’t display fear, self-preservation, or shame.

It’s like someone who fears heights, dancing on a pole after drinking too much.

The second option was more of a drastic procedure. Synaptic static can fry the nerve connection in the brain-destroying the delicate tissue. Cain will simply fry the parts holding the memory of the trauma; hopefully, after she resurrects, those memories wouldn’t come back.

But in reality, they come back but stay hidden deep into the target’s head were remembering them Cain be harder than usual.

The dragons had their version of this procedure called [Dragon’s modify memory] But that could leave a lasting impact on intelligence if used incorrectly. And Cain doesn’t want to use it on someone he knew, because he knew how bad it can be.

“Your girl, she is ahead,” Zaleria said.

“I know, I can feel her.” He replied.

After walking for a while, Cain lit the cave with [Enchanting: Light]

Far into the corner, surrounded by spikes of frozen acid and cold gusts of wind. A naked girl was curled into a ball and sitting there grabbing her knees.

Her dark gray hair was already falling, and her skin looked blue from frostbite.

Cain apprised her immediately.

“Can you hear me?” Cain approached her.

She slightly lifted her head and glared into his eyes. “Go away!” And looked back down.

“I came here to take you out, it’s good fortune you haven’t lost your mind yet.” He said squatting ahead of her to be at the same eye level as her.

“Go away, I will not lose my mind yet.” She said without even looking at him.

After thinking about it for a moment, he couldn’t be bothered to listen to her. Let’s just take her back to Bela and she will deal with her.

“Come here.” Cain extended his hand to her.

CRACK! His fingers froze and fell apart. The girls wanted to charge at her but Zaleria stopped them. Cain himself didn’t seem that bothered.

“Why don’t you want to get out?” He asked again. She didn’t reply, ignoring him completely.

“Speak! Speak! Speak!” Cain kept bugging her until she lifted her head again.

“You’re rather annoying for another hallucination, DIE!” At that moment, a wave of cold magic rushed at Cain.

“GAW!” Selena leaped in, grabbing Cain by the neck and throwing his away. BAM! The wave of cold magic hit her.

Holding her forearms in a boxer guard, fur started growing on them as they took a bestial shape. CRACK! Swinging her arms she deflected the cold wave.

Rakshasa’s fur wasn’t just normal fur, it was highly praised for its magical value, cold resistance, and slash resistance. Add to that Selena’s extremely active metabolism. Her body could easily resist being frozen with brute force.

Jella looked at her confused, this reminded her of a man that once faced her mother and killed her. She can vaguely remember the events as she had died at the same time.

Selena walked direly and Grabbed Jella by the hair lifting her up, “Cain told you to stand-gaw!”

BAM! BAM! Jella blasted Selena with cold magic over and over but it was of no use. Selena’s body just kept getting covered in fur as she kept partially transforming.

In the end, she resembled her father more than she did her mother. A jaguar head, a large body covered in black fur, and powerful bulky limbs. The middle ground between her jaguar form and human form.

“Selena, let her go!” Cain called her.

“You sure-gaw?” Selena asked.

“Yeah, I’m more interested to know since when you can partially transform like this.” He stood up.

“What do you mean?” She looked at him confused, “I was doing my hardest not to transform-gaw.”

“I understand, just let her go for now. I will deal with her.” Cain said approaching them. Selena let go of Jella who fell to the ground.

“Next time you hurt him-gaw, you’re my prey-gaw.” Selena retreated back to the girls where Zaleria kept staring at her confused. Selena’s magic felt slightly different than before.

“Now back to our conversation.” Cain sat beside the coughing Jella, “I’m here to take you back to your mother, and I’m not an illusion.”

“I can see that illusions don’t usually hurt like this.” She glared at him. And he glared back at her, he wasn’t able to understand why she was coughing, Selena had grabbed her hair, right?

“So first off…let’s get you something to wear,” Cain said with a smile.
