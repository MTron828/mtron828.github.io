After finishing with Noel, Cain felt something strange swirling by. The air became dry, and his head felt foggy. He could feel his eyes wanting to close. He smiled.

"So, my time has come," Cain mumbled, falling on his back motionless.

Noel and Sara looked at him for a moment with puzzled faces. "Cain?"

As they were about to panic, they felt a sharp headache.

[Notice: A new God has been born,] A strange voice that seemingly belongs to a woman boomed in their heads, spreading to every living being. The people at Furburg, the devils in hell, angels in heaven, demons in the abyss, and even the dragons scattered across the world, everyone heard it and stared at the sky.

[Notice: Today is a fateful day. And all of you shall bear witness.]

People started panicking. Wizards and mages who tried to use divination spells to investigate the situation failed. Spells refused to work.

[Notice: My name is Aria, the first true archon born from Cthulhu essence and the one responsible for the future.]

"What is this voice?" People started shouting, "Who's Cthulhu?" They screamed at the sky. Only those who lived in Furberg or Ourals knew. They smiled. Those who knew of Cain and got in his favor knew this was the awaited day.

[Notice: The current system is crumbling due to the disappearance of its creator. Cthulhu has stepped forward to create a new system and keep the balance.]

"Hold up, what?" A random adventurer in a guild cried, rushing to the counter and snatching an appraisal orb.

"My stats, they disappeared." He gasped.

Another adventurer was in the middle of a fight with a troll when his spells and skills stopped working. He lept back and curled into a ball, but even the troll stopped moving, looking up.

"What?" The man gasped.

[Notice: All fights and bloodshed shall stop for the configuration.]

Cain's body started smoking. Puff it burned into ask as his soul teleported back into the brain network he made.

[Notice: Cthulhu agreed to grant every race access to the system. Rejoice, mortals.]

The adventurer from before rechecked his stat.

[Notice: Calibrating everything might take a few moments. Please stand by.]

BAM! The girls opened the door and rushed into the room where Noel and Sara sat, "Where is Cain?" Sofia asked.

"I don't know. He disappeared." Sara replied.

ZON! Lilia appeared out of nowhere, "It's time," she said with a smile.

"Is this the new system? Where is Cain?" Alice approached her.

"Of course. AO's system finally collapsed. For Cain, I guess he's in the abyss with all the brains he collected." Lilia replied, shaking her head and humming.

"Who is this Aria?" Farryn who was listening asked.

"Cain never made Archons. I guess she is the system's consciousness. You can see it as Cain's daughter or a mere part of him. She is the same way Serin is to Chauntea," she pointed at Serin the angel sent by Chauntea.

"Archon? So we have the same strength?" Alice asked, looking at her hands.

"I doubt it. Aria would be as strong as Cain. You can't match her." Lilia replied, "She's Cain, after all,"

The girls looked at each other, worried. "Don't worry, smile, be happy." Lilia laughed, "This is a new beginning, a new life."

Sofia shook her head, "We can't help but feel worried. What if she did turn on Cain like Lolth?"

Lilia shook her head, sitting mid-air with magic. "Hold up. You can use magic?" Mary stared at her.

Lilia smiled, "Ah! I left the old system long ago. I can use magic on my own." She lifted her hand, "Right now, I'm the only mortal in the world with access to magic."

The girls sat on the bed, the couch, and the ground, awaiting Cain's return. "Will he be Okay?" Sara asked, looking at Sofia.

"He will be fine," Sofia replied, looking at Zaleria, "Isn't that right?"

Zaleria nodded, "Cain is strong, and this system is a part of him. I say he will be more okay than before." She smiled, "If Aria was Cain's daughter, who do you think is her mother?"

Nemmoxon stared at Zaleria, "I believe that Lilia didn't mean Aria is Cain's blood daughter. She said she was an Archon,"

"An Archon that came from Cain, his daughter." Zaleria smiled.

Nemmoxon stared at Serin, "You're an angel,"

"No, we aren't the children of the gods. To them, we're like swords to blacksmiths." Serin replied with a sigh, leaning her back on the bed.

The girls rested for a while before realizing, "Where is Gracie?"

***

In the Abyss, a young woman with long silver hair and blue eyes sat in the middle of a fleshy abomination. She looked at Cain's sleeping face with a smile.

Thud! Something approached.

The woman slowly turned her head, her eyes leaving a blue train, "Notice: How did you get here?"

"As a Maid, I must stay by Master's side," Gracie replied. "Are you Aria?"

"Notice: Magic shouldn't work. Getting here is impossible." Aria replied, lifting her hand.

"I jumped when I felt a change in Cain's shadow." Gracie replied, "I guess, I'm stuck here till the magic starts working again."

Aria stared at Gracie with her eyes glowing. The flesh around them started to rumble, "Notice: No one is supposed to get in here besides me and Cain." She then looked at Cain, "Notice: Don't move. The place is sensitive,"

Gracie looked at Aria with a blankly face.

[Notice: More annoyance.] Aria lifted her head, looking into the distance where a giant golem appeared. Everyone in the world heard her.

"What is that?" Gracie rushed toward Cain as Aria started floating.

"Notice: Who sent you?" Aria said with a passive face, approaching the golem. "Notice: they removed all traces, only gave you the ability to rampage."

"Don't get too close. He might attack you!" Gracie said from behind Cain, waving her hand to Aria.

"Notice: I already disabled him." Aria closed her fist and the golem disappeared, "Notice: I registered him into the system and then erased all of his strength. Right now, I have him stored for future use." Aria approached the ground, floating just a foot above the ground. She then slowly floated back toward Gracie.

"Can't you walk?" Gracie asked.

"Notice: I don't know how to do that. I was just created. The best I can do is stand or float," Aria replied.

"How long will Cain remain here?" Gracie asked.

"Notice: All the brains creating this domain are working hard to crunch through the stats of all people. The old system broke before the expected time, and it did suddenly. I would love to have double the brain power." Aria replied.

Gracie stared at her for a while, "You remind me of Cain," She said, drolling. As a succubus, her nose told her that Aria and Cain are extremely similar. If her eyes were closed, she could swear the one before her was Cain himself.

Aria stared at her, "Notice: Cain didn't have time to remodel my body, so he used himself as a base. It isn't strange that I resemble him." Aria replied.

"Two Cains," Gracie looked up, drolling, "Can I..."

"Notice: No," Aria replied immediately. "Notice: Right now I'm working on the system. Keep it for later,"

Gracie wiped her drool, "Sorry, I just thought about it." She looked at Aria with a smile, "But there is something else bothering me."

"Notice: What is it?"

Gracie looked at her, "If he didn't have the time to make you a body, who named you then?"

"Notice: AO did,"
