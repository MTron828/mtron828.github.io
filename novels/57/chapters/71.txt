‘This isn’t what I meant by getting back at them.’ Cain thought, looking down at the two girls in front of him.

“You want to get your punishment right here? Come closer to me.” Cain said with a slick tone, gently grabbing their hands.

The two girls nervously got a bit closer to him. Sofia clenched her eyes shut While Alice slowly crept behind her. Selena who was watching took a seat behind Cain.

With the idea finally sparking in his head, Cain gently grabbed their backs, his hands slowly crept downward.

“You understand what kind of punishment you’re getting, right?” Cain asked, tightening his grasp. “Let’s wait until we’re back home, this isn’t a nice place to do it, we also don’t have access to [Cleansing magic] here.”

The walls were thin and made of timber, the sound would travel down to the dining hall if they did something, [Cleansing magic] was also necessary contraception.

Both Alice and Sofia blushed, they finally understood what he meant. Cain wasn’t angry, he just wanted to have fun later, their punishment is to comply with his demands.

Giving each of them a long kiss Cain urged both of them to stand and forgot about this punishment until they are back home, Selena who was getting a bit jealous stole a kiss as well, It was starting to a bit stuffy in that room.

“Are you sure that’s all you want?” Sofia asked, having a worried look on her face.

“She is right, you almost died,” Alice add, she didn’t know that Sylph would be there before Cain could kick the bucket, there was no way he will die like that.

Before his son could get out of his pants, “Don’t worry about it, I’m not that easily killed!” Cain assured them before leaving the room.

Trying to calm himself down, Cain found a couch downstairs where he lay down. Little did he know, A little girl was watching him from afar thinking he was sick.

Slap! after taking a short nap, Cain woke up to a cold thing slamming on his face. Being taken by surprise his natural reflex was teleporting away with [Mist step].

“He disappeared! Mommy he disappeared!” Cain the voice of a little girl shouting in surprise, looking again it was Memi, the Innkeeper’s daughter, and her mother.

“You were a bit so we were taking trying to cool down your fever!” The mother said, Cain could see the wet towel she put on his head, a bowl of water was beside where he slept.

“Sorry for making you worry, It’s just exhaustion from this morning’s fight.” Cain walked back to the couch. It was normal to have a fever after sustaining too much damage in a fight. No matter how strong the healing magic is, the body will always react getting damaged severely.

After clearing the misunderstanding, Cain walked down to check if the meat was ready, he felt that he slept for quite some time. He was right and the meat was almost ready. Sneaking an early bite before going to call the girls down to have a nice meal.

After having a nice rich lunch, Cain left with Dolrig to check on the mine leaving the girls in the Inn.

The street was bustling unlike the dead silence of the morning, with people running left and right, and shops selling all types of goods.

“Was alright to not bring the girls along?” Dolrig asked, seeing that Cain was zoning out.

“It’s okay, I just wanted a have a look.” Cain wasn’t intending to enter the mines nor fight the monsters inside, jumping in might be dangerous. “A cave and monsters, even if it wasn’t a dungeon we need to treat it as such. Going in blindly will only lead us to death.”

Dolrig felt a deep sadness in Cain’s voice as if he was listening to an old retired adventurer pondering about his past.

Eventually, they reached the mine, It was in the rear end of the city, to the mountainside. The place resembled a war zone with all the tents and injured adventurers laying down in pain.

They carefully walked to not step on anyone. Soon they could see Dolrig’s wagon being parked in the distance.

As was expected, Cain wanted an explanation he headed directly to the guild camp to get information about the situation.

The situation was direr than Cain expected.

The break happened a couple of days ago in a newly discovered tunnel, monsters started spilling the moment it was open. The monsters are mostly subterranean types and general types of monsters like Slimes, cave alligators, cave spiders, dart worms, giant ants, and giant moles they have even seen traces of umber hulks and purple worms down there.

Clearing the mine is now counted as an S-rank mission and keeping the monsters from spilling out into the city is an A-rank quest.

Cain was thinking about how should they act, the guild put the clearing quest as an S-rank since they don’t have full details of what happened down there and are counting for the worst-case scenarios.

From the types of monsters, Cain could guess it might be an A-rank dungeon that broke down there. The real problem was the dungeon boss until they knew what he was the guild couldn’t just set an accurate difficulty.

With how big the death toll is so far, the guild just went with an S-rank.

“Let’s go, I want to buy a new sword,” Cain said, walking outside.

“Hold up, do you intend to go in?” Dolrig asked in distress.

‘This might be an opportunity to score an S-rank quest clear for us!” With the possibility of the mission being easier than stated, the risk seemed to be worth it this time. There was also the crazy amount of Exp he can get.

“I don’t think that’s a good idea, we don’t know what kind of horrors is lurking down there!” Dolrig almost yelled, he knew very well how quickly the situation can get out of hand.

After grabbing a new sword, Cain walked back to the inn to grab the girls, it was time to work.

“Are you sure-nya?” Selena asked, hearing it was an S-rank quest made her hesitate.

“We can’t, It’s just too dangerous. Do you have any strategy on how we could clear it?” Sofia asked calmly, “She is right, we knew how fights in caves can go wrong!” Alice added up remembering the fight with the goblins.

‘They are right, It’s dangerous.’ Cain thought. Yet the quest seemed more enticing than it should be. He might be able to level up with how many monsters were lurking down there.

“It’s a good chance for you to level up. We can always retreat if it seemed dangerous.” Cain tried to convince them. The girls weren’t buying it.

Selena slid her arm around his neck, “Calm down-nya! It’s risky, we can’t just go there-nya!” Seeing how clingy she was, Sofia and Alice did the same.

“She is right, we don’t need to finish this quest so let’s get back home!” Sofia said pressing her chest on Cain’s arm.

“Even if we got in the cave, we might still run into other adventurers so I won’t be able to stay in my devil form,” Alice added up hugging Cain from the front.

This was a tad bit too much stimulation for him. “Can you let me out for a moment?” Hearing him they let go.

“What if I said I’m going in there, what would you do?” Cain said he was determined to go in and farm Exp at least, “We will stand at the entrance, and kill the small monsters that try to get out. We will not go too deep and just stand in a safe place.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After a quick thought, the girls gave up and agreed on the condition of retreating in case anything dangerous appear.
