As morning came, Zaleria and Bela got ready for the operation, even Mei was called to prepare. Cain on the other hand took a bath and stretched his arms. It was time to get the power he needed to face the dragons.

“Cain, everything is ready.” Alice approached him as he just finished his breakfast.

“Time to go then, remember to be careful.” Cain flicked his finger and a light flashed in her eyes.

The operation started, Zaleria, Bela and Mei were the surgeons. “You know, it’s really helpful to have someone with small hands in here,” Zaleria said looking at Mei who was perfect to work on delicate veins and tissues.

“Don’t look at me like that, I’m almost passing out from the density of his Mana. Getting inside his body is a new experience.” Mei was barely able to hold her drool out. His Mana smelled sweeter than honey in her nose to the point she couldn’t smell the blood.

“I know, it’s ridiculous, isn’t it? The Mana in his body is denser than a high-grade MP potion.” Bela added as she froze a blood vessel to stop small bleeding.

CRACK! Zaleria used her claws to cleanly see Cain’s rib cage and get access to the heart. “Not just the density, the variety of magic he can generate is insane.” She added, sensing the draconic, demonic, fire, cold magic, and more flowing in his veins.

“Ok, Mei gets us the heart,” Zaleria said as she gently pulled Cain’s regular heart out.

“Coming right up.” Mei flew toward the massive heart and used her magic to shrink it to the desired size. Bela then cast a seal on the heart to lock the magic in place.

…

As the operation was taking place, Gracie went out hunting with Selena. The reason for that is Selena scratched all of her room so it was getting repaired. They were also running low on meat and hunting was cheaper, giving them fresh rare meat if they found it, and Exp.

“Can I eat one fresh-nya?” Selena asked drooling, they have already entered the forest near Selena’s village and her stomach was rumbling. They simply can’t just hunt gorgons around Furberg or they will push them to extinction.

Selena’s father, Seith was with them as a guide.

“Are you going to eat a whole bison?” He replied chopping her on the head and then feeling his hand hurt. Her head was harder than stones.

“She can eat it whole, unlike her look, she is the reason we’re so short on meat,” Gracie added as she looked around for anything that moves.

“What did you say-nya? I only eat the meals you give me-nya!” Selena’s tail spiked up.

“We give you half a cow a day, and you sneak into the store room to eat the other half. We’re keeping track of everything.” Gracie replied. She was the head maid and she knew almost anything that happens in the house.

“Nya! Something moved-nya!” Selena suddenly jumped into the bushes. Her movements were so quick her feet left an imprint on the ground.

After a second, she came out with a white rabbit in her mouth. “Snacks-nya!”

Gracie looked at her with a passive face, the rabbit reminded her of Cain so she found the scene a bit uncomfortable.

After a few minutes of searching and tracking, Seith finally found them a herd of bison but there was a problem. They aren’t the only group hunting, a group of lion demi-humans was hunting there as well.

“We should probably look for another herd, if we both attack the hunt will fail for us both,” Selena’s father said. Hunting from a herd isn’t simple. It usually involves tactics and planning that can’t be done on the spot.

The lions’ group did spot Seith and his group and they just ignored them. It was usually the strongest group that gets to hunt and the tigers were ten in contrast to three at our side.

“That one looks fatty-nya!” Selena said with her eyes sparkling, “And that one, as well that!” As a kid staring at Candy she observed the bison herd, this was her hunt and she cared less about lions.

“The fatty ones taste better…” Grace pulled her dagger, her eyes looked on the herd. Those two girls were about to charge in regardless.

“Listen, you can’t hunt…” Before he could finish, Selena rushed toward the herd scaring it.

Her father sighed, now she has done it. He started regretting not teaching her about hunting.

As Selena was running, her step suddenly became louder, her body turned black as she transformed into her jaguar form increasing her speed.

At that point her father realized something, Selena’s jaguar body was massive. She was a bit bigger than the bison and even faster. She quickly overrun them and started mauling the ones she liked. It didn’t matter if they were running, clustered together, or alone. She just jumps in, kills the one she likes with a head bite, and then leaps to another.

Just as the Lion and Seith were watching the massacre, Gracie had to join in. She was more terrifying than Selena in a different way. She used her shadows to teleport to the bison’s shadow, slit their throat with a single swing and let them roll around. They were just falling dead like flies.

When the hunt ended, they had scored over seventy kills. Gracie looked at them and said. “With Selena, Zaleria, and Nemmoxon, this will last us about a month.” The number might seem high but considering that just Selena could finish one a day. Zaleria and Nemmoxon are going to eat more. They do go hunt on their own but that is just since Cain feeds two dragons.

The lions approached the group slowly and carefully, unlike Seith who couldn’t tell since she was his daughter. Selena was a terrifying monster, they could tell just by looking at her.

“Seith of the Black Jaguar, could we have a word?” The lion leading the group of lionesses approached.

“Sorry for stealing your hunt Gadanfar.” He greeted him with a pained smile.

“No, no, it’s not a problem but…Who is…” He looked at Selena’s massive Jaguar body as she was snacking on a whole bison. She was just munching, bones and all.

“This is my daughter Selena, you should know her.”

“Selena? That little girl, the last time I saw her was getting beaten by a goat.”

Selena shifted her head toward the lion recognizing his face, he was an old friend who used to help the jaguar village in long hunts.

“Sir Gadanfar, it’s been a while-gaw!” Selena growled. She wasn’t angry or anything, it’s just that her Jaguar body sounded like that.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Selena shifted back to her Humanoid form and landed beside her father with a heavy Thud!

“You have grown big haven’t you?” Gadanfar smiled.

“We do have plenty, so you can take some-nya!” Selena said with a proud face, this time she could give them instead of taking them.

“Those are for the house and Cain, hunt them more.” Gracie interrupted her, she had already moved half of the hunt back to the village in her shadow.

“You don’t need to worry about us, we’re not pressed on food,” Gadanfar replied. “The bison herd has run away, look they are far and alert.” One of the lionesses said. The bison were almost at the horizon, it would take far too long to run to them.

“What you mean-nya? They are close enough-nya!” Selena said as she shifted back to her Jaguar form and started running at top speed.

And then [Thunder Step] Selena’s massive body flashed in a golden lightning bolt. In the next moment, she zapped all the way to the bison herd.

Selena swung her claw taking a bison down, as they tried to run again, she swung her tail and killed another one. This was her hunting ground, now that she has both strength and speed, she was unmatched in this forest.

“Could she be the new Alpha predator of the forest?” Gadanfar said with a smile.

“Above the lion king?” Seith asked.

“No, even if he was our king I won’t say he is the strongest now. That title belongs to the tiger chieftain.” Gadanfar laughed.

“She might be…” Seith pondered.

“Is she taken?” Gadanfar asked immediately.

“She is,” Seith replied immediately.

“Who’s the lucky bastard?”
