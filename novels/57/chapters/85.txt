Cain managed to regain his balance, [Firelance] Without even attempting to look at her, The crimson flame raged toward her.

Bang! The succubus deflected the fire lance with her bare hand, Smiling as she inspected Cain’s flow of Mana. “How refined, how superb!” Her body jolted as if it was struck by lightning, “How long have I slept, probably I shouldn’t have tried that half-blooded brat!”

Without even looking at her face, Cain could tell what kind of twisted expression she was making.

‘Holy…Charm and Illusion magic, up to the Sixth tire?!’ Cain was thrown aback by the monster standing in front of him. Still not looking at her. The passive pain a 20 charisma was enough, now it was this mass of madness.

‘I thought her magic was weakening, are you telling me there is still more after this?’ Cain simply couldn’t believe what he leaned, she was beyond broken.

“Little boy…this way!” She called him, walking a step at a time, gently swinging her hips as they itched.

‘That strength earlier’ Cain focused at the pain in his bleeding nose, her kick and reaction time were higher than her stats. She must be using her Illusion to hide her stats.

That was a problem, to his knowledge. he was the only one who could apprise people on the fly, her hiding her stats meant that she knew someone else who could that.

“Sorry, I already have a wife so begone!” Cain growled at her, holding his sword tightly.

She stopped after hearing his words, a smile filler her face from ear to ear. “Why didn’t you bring her with you? That way I can play with the both of you…” She started laughing, Cain could hear her stomping the ground with her bare feet.

656/720 Cain still had ample MP to use, that was his only advantage. ‘Her MP is still maxed, what ever magic is hiding her true power must have been used before she got to sleep. Cain got relieved as she didn’t seem to have done it because of him.

[Fireball] Without warning, he sent a giant ball of crimson flames at her direction, even if she dodged she will get caught in the explosion. 640/720

“Haha! I like fiery ones, show me more!” she laughed maniacally at the giant fire ball coming toward her face. BAAANG! The explosion shock the entire place, Cain listened to see if he managed to hit her.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Nice an swollen, I wonder how they taste.” Cain felt a soft hand on his marbles, a cold shiver ran down his spine. [Thunder Step] he quickly ran away. 624/720

‘That was a close call, how did she get behind me that quickly?’ Cain wanted to look for her so badly but he refrained, It will be a game over if he fell for her charm.

“Just a single taste, I promise to let you enjoy it, don’t run away!” Her voice was hunting his mind like a ghost, It sounded innocent yet evil, the effect of her high charisma were transmuted through her voice as well.

“Obey!” Her voice boomed through the room, Cain felt his body stiffen for a moment, It was magic. ‘Nice try, [Command] won’t work that easily on a 20 intelligence’ Cain laughed internally.

It was the first time he got to fight another spell caster, it being a succubus was a bummer as all her spells were nasty.

“How about you be the one to bark and wag her tail like an obedient bitch!” Cain replied, 620/720 Cain could easily feel his spell failing to take control of her, she had high resistances.

“Woof Woof, It will be my pleasure master-woof!” She could even hear her panting like a dog.

‘This…!’ Cain wasn’t falling for that, his spell failed. She was just trying to bait him out, her calm and manipulative response showed how experienced she was.

“Welp, I tried to be nice so don’t blame after ward!” As soon as she said that, Cain could feel her hand grabbing his head, her nail digging into his scalp through his leather hood.

‘Shit, Good thing I got this ready.’ [Sylph’s Tiny hut] to eliminate any charm magic she might be using, [Haste], [Lesser Empowerment] 588/720. Cain violently struggled to get out of her grasp, grabbing her hand and sending an elbow at her.

Swoosh! She dodged gracefully. SLAP! Slapping him in the face, Thwack! Her tail whipped his side in a flash, giving him a sharp throbbing pain.

‘Definitely rigged, her stats are camouflaged like hell!’ Cain was certain, other wise she would be able to do him like this. [Lightning Strike] Cain sent a thunder bolt in her direction.

“Iyaaa!” …’That was a moan, did I hit her or not?’ Cain expected either silence or a scream, the sound she made was neither of them and it gave him the creep.

SLAP! Cain felt her cheek scream if pain as she slammed her hands at his face. Violently turning his face toward hers. She used her finger to force his eyes open.

“Look at me!” Her glowing pink eyes started were starring at his, her red flushed nose touched his as threads of her fire red hair dangled in between. The sharp smell coming from her body burned deeply into Cain’s nose.

SLURP! She licked him from the chin to the forehead.

Unable to bear the sensation on top of her 20 Charisma charm, Cain passed out.

…

Back in the tower, The girls were focusing on their training as Cain has told them. They only hoped for him to return quickly.

Alice suddenly felt a shiver down her spine, her hair stood up and an abnormal anger swelled from her inside. An unbearable itching ran in her stomach, sending jolts through her entire skeleton.

“AGRAAAAA!” She screamed in rage, trying to vent her anger. She quickly alarmed the other two. Selena came rushing toward her to see what happened, Slap! Alice unintentionally hit her, returning to her senses.

“Selena, Sorry I didn’t mean it!” Alice quickly checked on the unfazed Selena.

“Never mind that, It was weak-nya. What happened to you-nya?” Selena took the slap as if it was nothing, gotta give it to her solid mentality.

“Are you alright?” Sofia finally reached them, seeing Alice slap Selena from afar she thought they were fighting, ” Don’t fight like that, Cain will be mad!” She tried to stop a fight that never started.

“No you got it wrong! Selena, sorry for that.” Alice apologized first before explaining what she gone through. “I just got this sudden anger and pain, I felt as if my link with Cain was on fire!” Her words sounded alien to them, they never felt a link so they just imagined it as a stomach pain.

“NOOOOOOOOOOO!” They suddenly heard Spindle squeal like a cat that had her tail stomped, Seeing him quickly rush toward them from the distance.

“What is it, you two have stomach pain?” Sofia asked, thinking it was the monster meat they ate this morning.

“No, No! Spindle felt it, Master in trouble!” He squealed, “He has been captured by a wicked one!” He was distressed, sweating as if he was in a sauna.

The girls eyes seemed to ask for further explanation, Selena already had her claws out while a menacing flow of Cursed magic is beating from Alice’s breath.

“A wicked one, a succubus has captured Master. She will suck him dry!” Sofia and Selena had no idea what a succubus meant, Alice on the other hand had read on them in some old books. She knew exactly what Spindle meant by sucking him dry.

Her anger seemed to be refueled, this time she understood what she felt like that! “I will..” Spindle quickly grappled her hand before she could continue. “Don’t, you will make it worse!” She was intending to teleport directly to Cain, her rage blinded her thoughts.

“If master lost, you have no chance alone! We need to go all together!” Spindle was the only one of them thinking straight. Hearing his words, Alice’s wisdom managed to calm her down in time.

Alice explained the other two what the Succubus was doing to Cain. Hearing that, Selena released too much bloodlust that Spindle’s hair stood up.

“Did he learn nothing from the goblins fight?” Sofia complained, “Cain he even hold out?”

“With master’s high MP it will take her hours to suck him dry, we Can make it if we hurried!” Spindle explained, the girls didn’t seem to know how High is Cain’s MP but they took spindle’s word for it.

Taking only the necessary things, they rushed with spindle leading the way.
