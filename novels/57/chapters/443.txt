Colorful Balloons Take Flight

With a lightning flash and a loud bang. The dragon’s front claws got sliced off. Feeling that, the dragon forgot all about Nemmoxon and Isbert, even his mission. At that moment his first and last goal was survival.

Blood splattered and the ground quaked as the humanoid monster landed, his armor smoking, his blade glowing bright red from the heat unleashing from all the lightning he was emitting.

The green dragon immediately opened his jaw to unleash his breath at the maximum output. Every bone in his body screamed this is a monster.

From his almost non-existing shadow, Cain forcefully pulled both Gracie and Alice toward him.

Alice immediately noticed the dragon and transformed to her true form, this wasn’t an opponent they could hold against.

“Take care of them, this lizard in mine,” Cain growled, from the first time Alice felt that he wasn’t messing around. Both she and Gracie had no choice but to obey, changing their goal to securing Isbert and Nemmoxon.

Almost losing consciousness, Nemmoxon looked at Cain’s back. His image reminded her of her father, a bronze dragon with unmatched skills in lightning magic.

[Telekinesis] Cain forced the dragon to swallow its own breath. The force was enough the crack the dragon’s teeth, and rattle its jaw.

The wyrm green dragon’s heart started racing, it didn’t matter how strong he was or how long he lived. Looking at this humanoid monster only gave him the image of death. Was this the monster that was eating his comrades all this past month?

“Hold up! The king on want to…” The dragon tried to speak but Cain wasn’t going to listen. Green dragons are known for their trickery and manipulation.

[Time Slow] Another ninth-tier spell, as everything moved as slow as it might’ve been static. Cain started casting another spell, a forbidden move that he once almost showed to his father in their training.

The only one who can harness the true potential of [Blade Dance] was the dark elf goddess Eilistraee. Because the skill was optimized to work with her body the best. That’s why the closer you get to the goddess shape, the strong the skill gets. Hence, female dark elves can use it better than males. Dark elves are better than high elves and elves are better than humans.

[True Polymorph] Cain’s body started to grow taller, and his hair grew longer. He had once gazed upon the goddess’s body, this is why he can pull such a thing off.

His skin grew into a shade of dark grey and his eyes glowed with a shade of purple. Eilistraee will smite anyone who tries to impersonate her, but that won’t be a problem if no one saw him in slowed time.

After taking on the shape of the maiden of the night, the dancer is under the moonlight. [Blade of Disaster] conjuring the ninth-tier spell on top of the sword he got from Mary, the sword elongated into a thin blade resembling the one Eilistraee used in her prime.

[Thunder Flash] Cain wasn’t done, if he wanted to save everyone, he has to erase this dragon from existence before it explode and poison the whole capital.

Taking a step forward, Cain’s sword gave a faint ringing sound as thunder slowly cursed through its steel. Taking on the shape of Eilistraee has perfected his skill. [Blade Dance]

The length of his arms, the strength of his hips, and the weight of his back. Even the slight friction caused by his long hair flapping in the wind. Everything connected into one content move that gathered the momentum of his whole body.

His blade that was overcharged with two ninth-tier spells, using a skill at the mastery of Eilistraee, ripped through the dragon’s flesh and bones burning everything it passed across with lightning.

CLING! CRACKLE! BAM! To Nemmoxon, it all happened in the blink of an eye. For a moment she was glaring at Cain’s back, and in the next moment, she was glaring at his chest as a storm of burned dragon meat was exploding behind his back.

“You killed a wyrm?” Nemmoxon growled unable to believe her eyes, in her mind, the power gape has been just too great. Even though she knew Cain was stronger than her, she didn’t expect him to be this far away.

“I wasted too much MP, worth it though for eliminating the risk of him exploding. On the other hand, you held him off pretty well, good job.” Cain patted her head. In his eyes, her feat of ripping a wyrm’s wing was more impressive.

“Don’t move, and shift back to your human for if you can? It will make my work easier.” Alice growled from behind Nemmoxon.

Spreading her arms apart, she was doing her best to heal both Isbert and Nemmoxon.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Alice, take care of them.” Cain turned around.

“Where are you going?” Gracie asked leaping into his shadow.

“Now that I’m this close to the capital I can sense it.” Cain said looking into the distance, he quickly pulled a mana potion from his pocket and chugged it down in one go.

“Sense what?” Gracie asked getting ready, she could feel it. Troubles are just starting.

“Father, Farryn and Zaleria, I can sense them fighting in the capital.” Cain had a serious face.

…

Back in the capital…A heated blood bath was taking place just outside the wall.

ROAR! A black dragon roared as it tried to run away, Chad was grabbing it by the tail and holding it to the wall. CRACK! The dragon’s tailbone shattered and Chad didn’t loosen his grip on him.

“HORA!” Farryn leaped with her hammer and cracked the dragon’s skull open. Swoosh! Switching her grip, she launched a fireball with her hand inside the dragon’s open neck igniting the inside of its chest.

“It shouldn’t explode!” Farryn cried.

“Why all of them are ancient!” Chad yelled as he leaped from the wall and summoned his horse.

…

Just a few moments after they defeated the maid, all the dragons plotting with the nobles attacked out of nowhere. A fifth of the capital got obliterated by their initial hit.

There was a total of fourteen dragons attacking at the same time. There were five ancient and nine adults. The initial hit was the five Wyrms using their breath weapons. Zaleria deflected an acid breath with her fire breath and a fire breath with a flap of her wings. Sofia alone managed to counter an Ice breath with her fire breath which caused some guards to shit themselves. They never expected such a massive cone of fire to come out of an innocent-looking girl like her.

The fourth breath was a lightning breath that seemed to miss the city and struck the sea. It was strange as the breath suddenly changed direction.

And the last one was a fire breath as the second one and it ravaged the city.

“Not all of them, don’t make it worse than it seems! Keeping them away from the city is all I can do so start killing!” Zaleria shouted in her dragon form.

“Aren’t you approaching the wyrm stage?” Farryn asked throwing her hammer at one of the adult dragons.

“I don’t know, I’m just doing what I can!” Zaleria’s flames and extreme senses allowed her to track all the dragons’ attacks and fend them before they could even approach the city.

“DIE-Gaw!” Selena have already climbed a blue adult dragon and was biting its skull, no matter how much he struggled. She didn’t let go.
