Cain looked down at Dakin’s corpse burning, he was still ready to strike back if he woke up and then suddenly.

<Soul fragments: 20 => 120>

It was confirmed, Dakin has died rather quietly. Cain expected at least a struggle or an explosion. Red dragons weren’t known to accept death this easily.

‘Was he just looking to die and go to his wife? No, dragons don’t think like that. Someone must have finished him off, was it the king?’ Cain started overthinking it. He might have done something to him, probably wanted to tie some loose ends but what ends?

At that moment, the stinging pain on his side caught him off guard. Cain fell on his knees, “He must have punctured my liver or something, good thing my brains had their own circulatory system or I might have passed out. He used [Telekinesis] to pop a healing potion and drink it.

At least the bleeding stopped so he stood up, Kayden was glaring at him. “You dying?”

“Sadly, not yet,” Cain replied.

“I can help you with that, slice all of your hearts and brains simultaneously should give you a quick death.” Kayden pulled his sword out.

“Sadly the maze that you came from would collapse on itself, with no one to manage it, every gate will release an explosion with the strength of a ninth-tier spell,” Cain replied as he took a few deep breaths.

“Rigged the whole kingdom, slippery bastard.” Kayden smiled.

“Not intentionally…haha…agrah!” Cain laughed but the pain cut him off.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Cain, are you all right?” Sofia sat beside him, her draconic form wasn’t something Cain expected to see.

“Back to you, those things seem painful. Should I help you take them off?” He asked.

“Won’t they bleed?” She asked.

“Not much, dragon wings are like human ears, you can pierce them but they won’t bleed much.” He replied.

“You’re grown fat, what did you eat?” Cain used an [Earth wall] to elevate himself and pat her nose.

“It’s that old lady, heard her voice. But let’s talk about her later…I don’t know how to revert back.” Sofia said with a worried voice.

Cain smiled, “It’s better you don’t, stay in that form until I make a gate big enough for you to enter the maze.”

“Why? Is it dangerous?” She asked.

~You should be naked if you transformed without prior knowledge of the process you won’t consider keeping your clothes intact. Your body transformed and they were torn apart. ~

~What? But Grandma keeps doing it all the time~

~As I said, she is consciously keeping her clothes intact with magic. Polymorph spells are made of two stages, the transformation and the preservation of equipment. Natural polymorph like yours doesn’t have the preservation part so you have to add it with magic. You don’t know how to do that, so your clothes are gone.~ Cain explained.

~Wait, so the pieces of jewelry you gave me are…~ Sofia exclaimed.

~They are gone, don’t give it too much thought.~ Cain patted her nose again.

~By the way, why are we talking like this?~

~Kayden is here, don’t want him hearing us talking about how you are naked.~ Cain smiled.

“But I can still hear you,” Kayden said from behind, a disappointed look on his face.

While Kayden and Cain started arguing, Sofia pulled the massive arrows stuck in her wing. Slowly, she preferred to do such a thing on her own. Unlike what she expected, it didn’t hurt that much.

“How?! I blocked my mind with [Mind Blank]” Cain turned toward him.

“Blocked your mind not her, I can still hear the conversation going in her head. I’m sure he didn’t puncture your stomach brain, are you all right?” Kayden sheathed his blade and sat on a stone.

BAM! Zaleria, and Chad landed beside them as everyone rushed in. Alice headed toward Cain as fast as she could.

“You got wounded again?” She started healing his wound.

“Sadly he didn’t get cut in half, which would have been more fun.” Kayden laughed.

“Shut up!” Alice pointed her hand at him, and a blast of Holy magic mixed with rot magic flew toward him.

Kayden stopped the attack with his hand, the flesh started melting off his bones but it regenerated even faster.

“Bypassing resistance, but it lacks power. It stings, concentrate it more.” Kayden said assessing Alice’s attack.

“Alice just let him be, he is just fooling around.” Cain sat on the stone he just made and lifted his hands up, “Need to make a gate for Sofia. Tell me, how are the rest?” As Cain started constructing the massive gate, Alice started telling him the condition of the rest.

“Selena and Gracie are doing fine, they should be up soon. Isbert has passed out from the heat and the remaining effects of the toxin, but she is stable now. Nemmoxon, Farryn, Zaleria, and your father are fine as you can see. Ariel is…What happened to your hand?!” Alice just realized that Ariel was missing a forearm.

“Nothing major, just punched that lizard a bit too hard. Wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t limited to this blockhead level.” She punched Chad in the side.

“Come here, I will heal you,” Alice called her but Ariel shook her head.

“My body needs to be reconstructed from Chauntea’s essence, it will regrow in a few hours,” Ariel replied.

After a few minutes have passed, Cain finished constructing the big gate. There is nothing fancy about it, just a massive blue veil of rippling magic.

“This leads to a separate room, get in so I can teach you how to revert back,” Cain said standing up.

“I’m coming as well,” Zaleria said.

“Ask Sofia, not me.” Cain looked at her.

“Let her come, she is more experienced after all,” Sofia said.

“There is nothing big about it, but fine.” Cain walked into the big gate with Sofia and Zaleria. Two massive red dragons have faded from sight in a moment.

With a snap of his fingers, Cain closed the big gate.

“Now, to revert back, you must relax. Imagine that your body is melting.” Cain said looking at Sofia.

“How do I do that?” Sofia said with a confused face, she was more nervous than she thought.

“Just imagine the same feeling you get when laying on a soft bed, that relaxation.” Zaleria shifted back to her humanoid form.

“Or the feeling you get when getting into a hot tub, just let all your muscles relax,” Cain added.

“I understood,” Sofia closed her eyes, feeling the strength leave her body.

In a few seconds, her body shrunk down to her humanoid self. FLOP! As she was standing while fully relaxed, she fell straight on her face.

“You fine?” Cain and Zaleria glared down at the naked Sofia lying on her stomach.

Sofia slowly lifted a thumb up, “Now that I reverted, my muscles are all sore. I don’t think I can move on my own.” She said with a faint smile.

Cain carried her with [Telekinesis] and opened a gate to his room in Furberg mansion. As soon as he got there, he called Lexi and asked her to fetch some clothes for Sofia.
