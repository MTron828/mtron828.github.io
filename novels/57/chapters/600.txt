Cain looked behind. It was Selena. "You forget the nya." He smiled.

Selena giggled. "Nya-nya. I was bound to miss one-nya."

"Want to join us?" He asked.

Selena nodded. "I'm not alone. The other two are coming as well-nya." From behind her, Gracie and Sofia walked in.

"Well, all four of you might be a bit much. Let's go with no magic at the start for you. But I will magic to enchant my physical abilities to keep up." Cain said, looking at them.

They all nodded.

BAM! Selena leaped ahead, shattering the ground where she stood. From the dust cloud, she emerged swinging a fist. KA-BAM! Cain covered his arms with a compressed [Lisworth's resilient sphere]

Cain immediately bounced away and stood back up. The spell [Lisworth's resilient sphere] is a fourth-tier spell. But the spell worked with Selena. No, Selena broke it, and Sofia just smacked him right after.

Few! A bunch of knives flew toward him from the back. He immediately turned and struck them down.

"AY!" In that brief moment, Gracie reached him and swung her knife at him. Cain turned quickly and grabbed her hand, trying to pin her to the ground. "Tuf!" immediately, and without hesitation, she spat on his face.

"Hey, that's disrespectful." His vision blurred, and he felt extremely hot. Before his body could break down the toxin, Gracie wrapped her tight around his head and smacked his face to the ground.

Thud! Alice rushed at him, followed by Selena and Sofia. Cain dodged Alice's sword and blocked Sofia and Selena with magic. At the same time, Gracie grabbed him with a chokehold.

BAM! He leaped up into the sky and spun around, trying to smack Gracie on the ground. Thud! To his surprise, she landed on her feet, lifting him instead.

"You wanted this," Cain said, pointing his elbow to her stomach [Telekinesis] A wave of force blasted her away. But at the same time, she grabbed his hand. Twisting her torso, she sent a kick at his face.

Cain ducked to dodge the hit. He then saw Alice approach him with an upward swing. [Blade dance] CLANG! He deflected her strike.

Thwack! Almost immediately, Sofia kicked his back end, and Selena kicked his face before he could hit the ground. Sending him up.

Sofia had already leaped up to receive him, and she swung her fist to punch him down. Thud! He grabbed her hand, "Surprise." BAM! With [Telekinesis] He threw her down instead.

CRACK! She landed on her feet, and Cain did the same.

"How about you start using magic? But don't transform into a dragon or a jaguar," Cain said, looking at the girls. He wanted them to get used to fighting in humanoid form.

"Will you be fine?" Alice asked.

"I will be fine. let's just do it," Cain said, smiling. Slowly he lifted his hands showing his nails to the girls.

[Enchanting] All of his nails turned black, with magic runes burning into them.

"Be careful, he buffed‚Ä¶" Before Sofia could finish, Cain grabbed her face. "Don't panic." He said [Elemental Burst: Windblast] A shock wave rushed from Cain's hand.

BAAAAMMM! Sofia held her place against the magic and grabbed Cain's hand. "I'm not immune to wind." [Burning feet] She kicked him away.

"Cain could cast magic without a catalyst, which only meant one thing. He is also a sorcerer on top of being a mage. Be careful, he has buffed his hand nails." Sofia yelled.

"What buffs?" Alice asked.

"I don't know, but at least it's only his hands." She replied.

Cain stood, "Nah, I enchanted my feet as well. It was really painful." He flew at them at high speed.

Selena blocked his path, grabbing him by the torso. Thud! Sofia flew in with a fiery kick. Alice flew in her devil form with two swords a holy one and a cursed one. Gracie appeared from Cain's shadow swinging her dagger at him.

Cain smiled. [Dispel magic] He grabbed Sofia's foot, extinguishing her flames with his right hand. And Caught Gracie's hand with his left hand, pulling her out of the shadow. As Alice swing at him, his right foot turned into a tentacle and smacked her on the chest.

CRACKLE! A flash emanated from Sofia's foot. Her flames ignited and got covered in lightning. BAM! She smacked him on the face, sending his body rolling away.

[BLAST] Alice smacked her swords together, causing them to explode sending a blast toward Cain.

Selena rushed toward Cain [Thunder Step] she reached him before Alice's blast. Punching him on the ground and then pinning him down so he won't dodge.Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

Gracie appeared from the ground and tied them with her steel wire. [Teleport] Cain disappeared with Gracie.

After a few seconds, he appeared carrying her. She was unconscious.

"Is she all right?" Alice asked.

"Yeah, I teleported her into a room full of my tentacles. That was enough distraction to be able to put her to sleep with magic." Cain replied with a worried face.

Sofia sighed, "Yeah, she likes them a lot. I bet that opening you got was just her waiting for the tentacles to caress her."

‚Ä¶The fight continued for a while.
