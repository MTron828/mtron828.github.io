CLAP! As Selena’s right foot ankle guard flashed with golden light, her body zapped toward the worm with a thunderclap. [Thunder Step]

The worm only saw Selena’s figure approaching in slow motion but couldn’t dodge. Selena was way faster than what the worm’s body could react to.

BAM! Selena’s right fist connected with the worm’s face and dragged her body across the air in a lightning bolt. Her left foot ankle guard flashed next, [Haste] increasing her speed further. The ridiculous acceleration was causing the worm to start losing consciousness.

ZAN! Selena’s right-hand wrist guard flashed causing a shock wave to shake the worm’s head, [Lesser empowerment] even the slight increase in strength was amplified by the high speed.

Cain who was running around searching for the girls suddenly felt the enchanted items he gave to Selena overheating. They were about to break from the way they were forced to run.

CRACK! The wall beside him cracked and Selena flashed in a lightning bolt dragging the worm with her.

“GRAWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!”

The entire dungeon shook as Selena smacked the worm to the wall, Cain had to use [Lisworth’s resilient sphere] to protect himself from the flying debris.

THUD! The moment Selena landed on the ground, her ankle guards shattered, and her right-hand guard cracked into dust as she smashed her fist to the ground.

Selena’s eyes were bloodshot and her hair standing. Her ears turned back and her tail swung from left to right.

“GRRRR!” A low growl can be heard escaping her drooling fangs.

CRACKLE! With a lightning spark, fur started covering her body, and her muscles swelled quickly. Even though the collar that allowed her to transform into a jaguar shattered, she still transformed on her own. She did it long enough that her body simply remembers the feeling.

CRACKLE! Golden lightning started sparking from her eyes and the small golden dots on her black fur.

As Cain glared at her, it was obvious.

“ROAR!” Selena roared as she started running toward the worm with heavy steps.

The worm slithered across the wall and tried to escape through a small crack in the ceiling.

Thud! Thud! Thud! CLAP! With each step Selena took, her speed increased until she flashed toward the worm with [Thunder Step]

CRACK! Selena smacked her head into the crack biting the tip of the worm’s tail and pulling her out with a splatter of blood.

She then jumped with her back to the ground and started swinging her around like a cat playing with a small snake.

The worm’s body got torn to shreds and its head flew away from the violent swinging. The fight seemed to be over but Cain flashed toward the severed worm head.

[Thunder Step] [Enchanting] [Elemental weapon: Lightning Blade] [Haste]

“You think you can run?” Cain smiled as he sliced the head in half and then burned it with a [Fireball] He has seen the worm’s stats and knew she would try and use that opportunity to fake death and escape.

After Selena tore the worm’s body into shreds, the duration of her [Berserker] ended and she fell asleep. Her body shifted back onto her humanoid form as Cain approached her.

An uneasy feeling was creeping behind Cain’s head, that worm was strong and should be the boss. Why isn’t the dungeon closing?

…

“So this is all you’re worth? But another prey to our gaze.” Hati’s father (The other worm) said as he turned around to walk away from the bloodied and unconscious Hati. She has been struck by his death glare and has been sucked into her death dream.

As moved away a bit, dry wind blew at his back. Weird magic was pulsating from the woman he had just presumably killed.

“(So knocking her out completely allows me to fully control the body, what a fool are you to let me out)” Hati stood up, this time it was Skoll controlling the body while Hati was unconscious.

The man turned around and looked at her standing. As she looked at him, the ground started to vibrate.

“Who are you?” He asked.

Thud! Thud! Skoll started slowly walking toward him as the eternal blade emerged from her hand. “I do not wish for dominion over my sister, but I the one who should have been the first, the one who feeds the eternal glory of the Fenrirs. A mere worm is nothing but food to us!”

Skoll’s nine tails extended to cover her whole body for an instant, when she emerged again her body was covered in an armor of solid stone.

[Eternal Bedrock]

BAM! The man that is already failing to resemble her father leaped ahead to slash at her. CLING! She coughed his blade with her hand, he could never cut through the stones covering her palm.

“Bedrock can never be broken, this is for the sin of tormenting my sister!” Hati shouted as a stone pillar punched him to the other side of the room.

[Bones of the Earth]

The moment he tried to stand, the earth beneath him opened and swallowed him whole.

[Ground Break]

‘It’s crushing me, I must escape’ He growled using all his strength to dig himself out and then jump into the air.

“There is no escape, the land eternal and whoever flew has fallen back to her.” Skoll swung the eternal blade and caused a massive blade of stone to emerge from the ground

[Ground Blade]

Thwack! He tried to block the attack since he had no way to dodge mid-air but ended up being smacked on the wall.

“You touched the stones, become a part of them!” Skoll growled as the walk turned onto me and swallowed the man and quickly reverted to stone. [Meld into Stone]

CRACK! The man broke the stone and leaped toward Skoll at a blinding speed. He needs to kill her as fast as possible. The inside of a cave is her best environment being an earth mage.

[Earthquake] The entire cave collapsed.
