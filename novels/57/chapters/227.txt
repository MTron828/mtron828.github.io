After Kayden left the maze, Cain looked back at the scattered corpses. ‘They can’t be raised like this.’ He thought.

To raise an undead, their head needs to be intact and their bodies mostly whole. Who needs a zombie torso without any limbs?

Cain looked at them in disappointment when an idea came to his mind. ‘Now that I think about it, the dragons used to have a torture chamber like this.’ [Giant insect: Cockroach] [Giant insect: Cockroach] [Giant insect: Cockroach]…He filled the room with them.

[Hallucinatory Terrain] He made the room look like an abandoned stone room with no doors.

“This will be a suitable place to send some people, swimming neck deem in cockroaches.”

Cain then immediately left.

Kayden was waiting for him outside with Alice and Lily. “It took you some time to get out, I was getting worried.” Alice rushed at Cain.

“I just had to clean the mess, did you wait for a long time?” Cain looked at her smiling. He could understand what she was worried about.

How could he trust Kayden, the answer was that he didn’t. ~I used magic that would teleport him to the maze if he tried anything funny, don’t worry.’

Alice gave a suspicious look, she could feel the cure oozing from Kayden. She suspected that Cain’s maze could contain such a monster.

“Let’s go to the Iron gate inn, I don’t think that returning to the pub is a good idea,” Cain said. He was worried about Wagner and his daughter, even though he met them for a short while, he wanted to make sure they are fine at least.

Alice slowly walked behind him, she remembered when Kayden cut her with his sword in Lexi’s village fight. Should she bring that up? Cain should know…She quickly shook the thought from her head. ‘We must play along until we get the information we need, stepmother’s work is annoying.’

When they reached the inn, a platoon of guards was surrounding the place and dragging Wagner out. “I told you to let me go, I am a victim here!” Wagner screamed, he seemed to not even have the time to tend to his wounds.

Unable to believe what he was seeing, Cain just walked between them and snapped Wagner’s cuffs. “It’s been a long time, how have you been doing?” Cain asked Wagner with a smile.

Wagner just stared at him, unable to utter a word.

“Wait for you!” One of the guards screamed and pulled his sword. “The white mage, arrest him at once!” Another screamed. They immediately surrounded Cain like flies.

“I don’t have time to deal with you idiots. You there, you are the leader, take you men and scram before I feed you to cockroaches.” Cain growled at the bulky man hiding behind the guards.

He had seen them before, they saw Wagner getting beater but didn’t interfere and now they were dragging him out. That had meant one thing. They worked with the thugs.

“We’re trying to keep order here. He was dealing with the local criminal organizations and now he has you at his side, this is a clear felony!” The bulky man growled with a smile on his face.

Cain gave the man a disappointed look, “You know? I don’t have time to deal with idiots like you, to the cockroach room you go.” Cain flicked his finger and the man disappeared.

[Arcane Eye] [Mirage Arcane] “Now watch your leader get eaten alive by cockroaches, sorry but I can’t get you to hear him screaming.” Cain created a small screen for the soldier to watch the horrid fate of their leader.

Cain then helped Wagner stand, “Marina will decide what to do with you, get back to the keep when you’re done watching.” Cain walked inside the inn with Kayden, Lily, Alice, and Wagner. He left the guards standing there, half of them puking and the other half staring in terror.

‘Second room out of 512 is done!’ Cain smiled inside, even in his days at the dragons’ test lab, only a few survived such room without dying or going mad.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Alice quickly tended to Wagner’s wounds, his wife was terrified as it was the thugs and then the guards. This has surpassed the definition of a bad day.

Memi on the other hand quickly switched gears and returned to playing around. It was better since she was still a kid.

“Marina is now the city lord, I will ask her to protect the inn so you don’t need to worry,” Cain said with a smile on his face.

“You really came back?” Wagner looked at Cain with a hopeful face. He then explained how the previous lord had been abusing his power against the people and the guild. Raising taxes, prohibiting some trades, and using for to recruit soldiers. Even the adventures were getting sick of him and this city, even the last Hydra attack, those adventures might have done to get back at the lord for something.

Wagner’s business was going down due to the high taxes (70%), and then thugs pursued him as well. When he turned to the guards, they offered to help in exchange for another 20%. When Wagner asked around, he knew it was the same situation across the city.

“I used to have a dog shop, training guard dogs, hunting dogs, scout dogs, and even fighting dogs. It sadly closed because of that and now the entire world is filled with dogs, can that be his doing as well?” Kayden asked. That rang a bell in Cain’s head.

Kayden’s madness must have started before he became a demon. He most likely started going mad when his business was destroyed and Morena only pushed on that to make him a demon.

“Most likely, it should be fine from now on since that lord has been taken down,” Cain said.

Kayden looked at Wagner, “The world is still filled with dogs.” He mumbled.

“It will take some time to revert back so don’t worry.”

After assuring Kayden and patting Wagner on the back, Cain chose one of the tables to sit on.

“Cain you bring us something to drink? We’re going to have a long talk.” Cain asked Wagner’s wife to bring them something, he wanted to have a conversation about the Fenrir Village with Kayden.

Cain hoping that dragons aren’t involved, ‘Please just say the Beast god is sick or about to die of old age.” Cain hoped it was a normal problem that he can solve quickly.

“So to start, the dragons…” Kayden started to talk but Cain slammed his cup on the table.

“For f**k sake. I’m sick of dealing with them…” Alice knew clearly what he was feeling, after seeing how strong Zaleria and Morena are, she couldn’t imagine facing more of them.

“Are you okay?” Lily asked starting at Cain’s twisted face.

“Yeah, sorry for that. Please continue…” Cain smiled and looked at Kayden.

Kayden thought about what Cain said for a moment and decided to keep the dragons part for last.

“The Cubus tried to…” Bang! Cain slammed his cup again. Kayden only started at him, “Are you okay?” He asked.

Cain slammed his head on the table, “Dragons, 20 charisma, what next? Kenku?”

He then noticed Kayden’s eyes slowly shifting to the side.

‘Damn it!’ Cain screamed internally, this was going to get complicated.
