“Why haven’t you told us before?” Alice stared at Cain with a sharp glare, “We could have helped, you know?” Sofia sat beside him.

“I prefer it this way-nya, Cain’s decision is always better-nya!” Selena crawled beside him and curled into a ball.

“Master is master, it doesn’t matter what he is or where he comes from.” Seeing as the other three said something, Gracie thought it was best if she talked so she thought a bit and said what she had.

Cain looked at them, ‘So it’s half and half.’ This was a better outcome than he ever expected.

“I’m going to skin that lizard!” Chad growled, directing his anger toward the dragon king. A golden light glimmered in his eyes with divine energy.

“Are you stupid? There is no way someone like you can stand in the face of the dragon king. He is a monster above all, just his mere presence is enough to turn humans into dust.” Zaleria hit Chad in the head. His head sounded like a chunk of steel as he stared back at him.

“By the way father, I never asked you but which god are you getting your powers from? You’re a paladin right?” Cain asked. His father was using holy magic, smite, and even summoned an angel. He has to be a paladin.

Cain was expecting him to say Chauntea but what he heard was something unexpected.

“I don’t know, do paladins need a god to get their power?” Chad looked at Cain with a passive face.

“Paladins are the holy knights who serve a god, they are the ones who lead crusades in their god’s name. How can you be a paladin without a god?” Cain stared at him, it just didn’t make sense. Was there even a god who didn’t mention his name to his paladins?

“I never heard of such a thing, I was born with those powers and they are mine alone. I didn’t spend forty years perfecting them for a god to say that he gave them to me.” Chad put his fists on his hips, and Cain finally noticed something strange. Both holy and divine magic hummed from in his body.

Holy was the magic gods gave to clerics and divine is what they gave to paladins. Holy is more of a supportive element with spells like [Holy Healing] and [Cleansing] while divine takes more of an offensive approach with [Smite] and [Summon Celestial]

Chad might be right about the power being his, Cain never heard of a god strong enough to grant the same person the powers of a cleric and a paladin at the same time.

The only possible one was AO, but that thing never interacts with gods let alone mortals. The last thing he did was create humans in ancient times and then disappeared. ‘I wouldn’t be going through all these troubles if he was willing to interact with people.’ Cain sighed.

“Yeah, I guess the only explanation is that they are yours.” Cain looked at his father with a smile. Powers are powers, as long as he can use them freely it didn’t matter where they originated from.

Chad smiled with pride, “Humans are the best race to ever exist, and those powers are the proof of that.”

Cain yawned, telling them the story of his past life took a long time and he was feeling sleepy.

“You’ve just been asleep for more than two days already, get up from the bed if you can. Dinner is ready.” Alice helped Cain up.

Stretching his arms, Cain felt a warm gush of blood course through his limbs. His whole boy was stiff and numb.

“I did ask the maids to prepare a bath, would you mind taking one while they warm up the food?” Gracie walked toward him, Cain patted her head and smiled.

“Thank you, I actually needed one. Let’s go!” Cain walked toward the bath and the girls followed him.

Chad went outside to have a drink with Dolrig, those two seemed to be getting pretty well.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Zaleria jumped from the window and flew toward the rooftop, she like to relax there under the night sky.

“Master, Cain you wait for a moment?” Gracie stopped them right in front of the bath door.

“What is it?” Cain looked at her.

Gracie turned around and called Lexi who was just leaving the bath after arranging their clothes in the changing room.

Lexi hurried toward Gracie if the head maid called her while Cain and all the ladies were present. Something important must be up.

Gracie smoothly walked behind Lexi and with a single swift move, she lifted her skirt up. “Those garter belts, I had all the maids use them!” Gracie said trying to put on a proud face.

Kya! Lexi screamed as she swung her arms down and immediately pushed her skirt back down. “W-what are you doing!” Lexi cried as she grabbed Gracie by the collar.

“Showing master what we’ve been preparing,” Gracie replied.

“You can’t just go and pull my skirt up like that!” Lexi yelled at her.

“I can, it’s not like you mind?” Gracie replied with an empty stare.

“Gracie, they care. She is right that you can’t do that.” Cain said with a weird smile, he was hoping Lexi won’t get offended in a big way.

“But she agreed to show it to you.” Gracie stared at Lexi, “But!” Lexi cried.

“I bet she meant that she will do it and not you, what you would do if I suddenly did that to you?” Cain asked Gracie, she seems to be misunderstanding some things here.

“I would be worried if someone beside us and Alice, Sofia, and Selena were there,” Gracie replied.

“That’s it, think of it as her being in the same situation. Don’t do such a thing for people even if they asked for it, mostly they have other time, place, and emotional limitation that you don’t know off.” Cain tried to explain it in a way that Gracie would understand, he can’t just say something it’s improper or they don’t like it because she would fail to understand the bigger picture.

“He is right, I’m fine now so please don’t try again!” Lexi said as she relaxed her arms, she didn’t even mind Cain seeing her naked but the surprise took her.

“You’re fine now?” The cogs in Gracie’s head started spinning in a bad way, even with that explanation she seemed to get it wrong.

“Look, we even added the frills sent by the maids in Ourals keep here!” Gracie pulled Lexi’s skirt up again and pointed at the top of her thigh-high stocking.

Lexi sighed, “I don’t care anymore. As you can see we received everything, all the maids have gotten new uniforms with the frills and those belts except this one here.” She pointed at Gracie. “Her uniform will take more time to prepare it seems as Lady Lisa will see to it personally.”

Cain nodded as he tried to take a closer look, they weren’t as good as he expected but they were nice.

Thud! He felt a hand with claws grip his head. It felt a bit weird, it wasn’t like Selena’s hand. This one looked harsher and tougher, it was also hot. It reminded him of Zaleria’s claws.

When Cain turned around he saw two glowing draconic eyes stare at him. Two massive leathery red wings with black spots on them. Four black horns, two thick ones pointing forward while two thin ones pointing backward. Red and black Scales ran up to her shoulders with flame gushing from her nose.

“Sofia? What happened to you?”
