As the guards reached the scene, they were shocked to see the destroyed street. The walls were smashed, the road plowed, the stalls wrecked, and the people cheering from afar.

Upon closer inspection, BAM! BAM! They could see two humans exchanging blows with a demon.

Kayden Grabbed Raptor by the leg and swung toward Takeshi who punched him in the face.

The sound of that punch resonated across the street and quaked the windows. “HAZZZZZZZI!” Raptor screeched as he turned around and bite Kayden’s arm.

Kayden wasn’t fazed, he couldn’t even feel the pain and his body will regenerate quickly. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Three sold punches cracked Raptor’s ribcage as if it was made of brittle wood.

Swoosh! A whirlwind engulfed Raptor and blasted Kayden and Takeshi away like leaves. BAM! BAM! Raptor started stepping in the air and leaping around. The combination of his wind magic and his physical power allowed him to use air as a platform.

“You die!” With his last leap, he rushed toward Lily who was in the alleyway. A quick and powerful stab with his hand was rushing toward the running woman. He didn’t want to kill her, his plan was to mortally injure her so Kayden and Takeshi would need to stop fighting to treat her and give him a chance to run or counterattack.

In the last moment, before the attack connect, Raptor felt an insane pressure behind him.

Takeshi grabbed his sword and stomped the ground as hard as he could with a loud roar. The shock and dust forced the watches to blink for a moment, which was all that Kayden needed.

Kayden now didn’t need to hold back in fear of destroying the houses as all people have gotten out to see what was happening, he didn’t have to try and be calm to not draw attention, he can go all out since all people can’t see for the blink of an eye.

Three punches landed on Raptor’s back, behind him, a three-headed, six-armed demon was raging. CRACK! CRACK! He could feel his spine crack from the extreme pressure, his legs felt weak as he took all that damage.

‘This body is done for, I have to retreat and find another.’ Raptor relaxed his body and let Kayden’s attack send him all the way across the alleyway.

When Kayden rushed to finish him off, he found Raptor dead, his body was lifeless.

Realizing that, Kayden shifted back to his human form before anyone could see him.

One day later, a man woke up from sleep in a faraway land at midnight. His naked wife was asleep beside him so he covered her up with the blanket.

Slowly, he walked outside to the backyard, standing beside the fence he glared at a fly that landed there. His eyes quickly flashed red as veins emerged on his face.

“What is the meaning of this?” The man growled with rage.

“A new demon appeared, this one is different-buzz!” the fly replied with a shaking voice.

“Raptor, I don’t care what you faced, I only seek results.” The man growled lifting his palm, if the answer didn’t please him, he will smash the fly.

“They asked for your location, they must be aiming to take your life-buzz. That demon despite being strong is afraid of showing his form to humans so we can kill him with more than two demons-buzz.”

The man seemed to calm down, “Fine, there is a woman in that house. Take her body and let’s head out. I must change the location before it’s discovered.”

Raptor flew inside the house and found the woman fast asleep, he quickly went into her nose. After a minute her eyes opened up.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She stood up and stretched her arms, “Finally a body!” As she was standing there naked. A little girl opened the door, it was her daughter which was in her room.

“Let’s go, our destination is northwest!” That voice and aura, it was the same man from earlier, he took over the little girl’s body.

“As you wish, our Lord.” Raptor replied as wore his clothes, strapped the little girls to his back and they headed out immediately.

Back in Furberg, three days have passed and Alice exited Cain’s recovery room exhausted, he was a handful to deal with.

On her way she met Gracie who was cleaning, the girl’s face was pale and her eyes looked sleepy. “Gracie are you all right?” Alice asked with a worried face.

“Nothing, it’s just that…I’m a bit hungry.” Gracie replied with a low voice.

“You didn’t eat?” Alice asked with a puzzled face.

“No, it’s the other type of food. Three days and I’m feeling it.” Gracie was clearly not well, not having Cain for that time has taken a toll on her body.

“Why didn’t you ask Cain to leave you some? Look how did you end up.” Alice took the broom from her hand and glared at her.

“I didn’t know I would get this exhausted, even Cain didn’t expect this as I’m not a full one,” Gracie replied.

“I see, stop working and go rest until I find a solution. Make sure not to exert yourself too much.” Alice glared at her. Now, this was a pickle, Gracie is left starving.

Even though she was exhausted, Alice went to Olivia’s lab and took a few vials from there.

“Why do you need them?” Olivia asked.

“Need them to administer some medicine to Cain, I will get you new ones later,” Alice replied as she went back to Cain’s recovery room.

“This is your mistake for not making adequate preparation.” Alice sighed, there was only one place in the world she could get food for Gracie and that was him.

After about an hour, Alice opened the door to Gracie’s room and found her asleep in her bed. “Are you awake?” She asked.

“Yes,” Gracie replied with a passive face.

“Then take those, I did get them fresh.” Alice handed Gracie the vials filled with the white thick liquid.

“Isn’t he sick, is it all right to do this?” Gracie asked.

“I’m sure he wouldn’t mind, it will be a bigger problem if you starved to death.” Alice smiled as she left to rest.

As Gracie gulped the vials down, she felt a weird tingling in her stomach, even the taste felt a bit different. She thought that was because she had been starving for three days.

Even so, she quickly felt refreshed. She needs to be more aware of her succubus side and make sure she has a source of food ready at all times. This meant that she can’t leave Cain’s side for more than two days without having him leave some food.

Back in the forest, Selena has been running for a while searching for her targets. It would have been probably a good idea to ask for their location before running like this.

She stopped under a tree to inspect a trail of blood. ‘They are moving, each time I think I caught up I find they already left the location. Those two are moving hunters who rarely stop in one place.’

As she was chasing them, she found a strange scene. A part of the forest was melted with acid with massive claw marks everywhere. She instantly realized it, the smell was similar but it was also different.

“This is bad.” She said.
