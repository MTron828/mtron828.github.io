Popping out from the shadow, Gracie quickly fixed her maid uniform before standing to greet Sofia. “I have returned, Lady Sofia. Is master around?”

Sofia shook her head, Cain still hasn’t woken up. Alice said that he was fine and just recovering but it still bothered her.

“He is in his room fast asleep, the exhaustion of the fight seems to have gotten to him. Can you tell me how it went and what did you find?” Sofia said with a sad face.

Gracie nodded, “Ourals lord, Bancroft has been dealing with Morena for over a decade. The reason that all his children have died except the eldest daughter is that he used them in undead experiments.”

Sofia frowned, Cain had expected Morena to have forced him but he seems to be a problem himself.

“So what did you do?”

“Tied him in a basement, his daughter is locked in her quarter and the city’s militia have surrendered after seeing the Dungeon’s gate collapse.” The S-rank dungeon had two gates, one close to Ourals and one in Furberg’s forest. Lord Bancroft used it to move his troops.

“Did you have any difficulties?”

“I never got in a fight so I was fine,” Gracie replied. She first killed the commander-in-chief responsible for moving the troops into the dungeon without getting out of the shadows.

She then made her way toward the Lord keep amid chaos and checked his office and room for information.

Gracie then handed Sofia a stack of papers, “This should be enough to prove him guilty.”

“What did his daughter say?”

“She was thrilled to see her father finally captured, as she was in line for his experiments.”

After giving Sofia a brief explanation of other smaller details, Gracie excused herself to her room so she can rest.

Cain woke up that night feeling sore all over his body. “Damn I feel like I have a terrible hangover!” He shook his head and looked around him. It was pitch black, so he slowly walked toward the window and opened it.

It was snowing and the sky was covered with could, Cain had wanted to check the sky but it was midnight. [Enchanting light] He enchanted a candle so it becomes a glowing stick.

His Mana didn’t regenerate beyond what he had, his natural ability to regenerate Mana is nowhere to be found.

‘I should start working on the tattoos quickly; I reached level 20 so I should start creating the enchantment base.’

Cain clenched his fist. It felt heavy and tired. He still hasn’t recovered fully. ‘I need to start working on evolution as well.’

———————————————————–

Evolution path:

[High human]: Suggested by the inherited blood

[Lich]: Suggested by the necrotic magic residing in the bodyÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

[Abomination]: Suggested by the numerous types of magic dwelling in the body

Other evolution paths will open by achieving their requirements.

———————————————————–

‘I know what a lich is and what an abomination is, but what is this [High human]? Is it like a high elf or something?’

The system said it was from his inherited blood, which meant he was born with it. What puzzled him is that it was nowhere to be seen in his past life.

‘I should do some experiments to find what it is before evolving. Otherwise, I will just go with an abomination instead.’

Abomination was a type of creature rather than a race, it meant being closer to a chimera that a normal living being. That meant that he could use magic to make modifications to his body and gain new powers while still keeping the outer shell of a human.

An abomination for example can have a human brain, a dragon heart, and the eyes of a basilisk…

The child of a half-dragon and a succubus would have the traits of humans, dragons, and succubus and will be classified as an abomination.

“Spindle, can you come out for a moment?”

… Spindle didn’t reply. “Spindle?”

Cain quickly checked his link with the little creature. It was severed.

“So…He died.” Cain looked outside, “Let’s summon him again, his soul should have returned to hell.”

[Summon lesser Demon]

The spell failed due to Spindle having lost his body, Cain had to think for a moment but he was soon able to find an easy solution.

‘Let’s some meat tomorrow so I can create him a new body with [Create Homunculus]’

After making sure he was alone, Cain twisted his wrist and opened [Sylph’s secret chest]. From it, he took the S-rank dungeon core, as he had hidden it there.

After that he looked inside, all of the lich’s jewelry was there.

‘This thing still has a lot of Mana inside it.’ Cain quickly used the dungeon core to recover his Mana and then proceeded to start working on his magic.

[Demi Plane]

As he cast that spell, a small door appeared in front of him. Opening it leads him to an empty 30 by 30 feet.

[Enchanting] Clap! Clapping his hands, the color of the walls turned white. Clap! A door appeared on each wall.

[Enchanting: Link]

After he finished that, Cain walked to one of the doors and opened it. He could see himself ahead. Each door led to the door opposite to it, this was a locked circuit.

[Maze] With this spell the rooms seemed to repeat an infinite amount of times but they were just 8 in total stacked in a cube shape. Each one teleport to the other and make you walk in circles.

[Enchanting: Know the way, Alice, Sofia, Selena, Gracie, and Zaleria] This was a maze designed to confuse unwanted people. He wanted the girls to be able to move freely inside.

‘With this, I can link this mansion with Ourals without fear that someone else would use the teleportation way.’ Cain quickly got back to his room and used the other spell [Arcane Gate]

The door to the maze opened again, and Cain smiled in satisfaction.

“You should get back to sleep!” Cain heard a voice at the door when he looked. Alice was standing there.

“How did you know I was awake?” Cain asked, he was sure he had kept quiet.

“Do you think I can’t feel you spamming such magic? Everyone else had woken up as well.” She replied. Cain knew she meant Sofia, Gracie, and Selena.

“Come and check this, I was just making a teleportation hub for us,” Cain said with a smile.

“This is what you do when you get nervous, you said that when we were in the forest. Is there something on your mind?” She asked him with a serious face.

The smile quickly faded from Cain’s face, “Yeah, I have reached level 20 and was thinking about how I should evolve. I also need to revive the spindle, by the way, Edward had seen him so I have to deal with that as well. Even without seeing her, I can feel that Zaleria’s magic is weaker than a level 4 Sofia…” Cain went on listing all the problems that were coursing through his mind.

“Let’s go to sleep, we can think about that tomorrow!” Alice pushed him toward the bed. He may have just woken up but it didn’t mean he should start spamming eight-tier magic right away.

Doing that was like sprinting right after having a cardiac arrest.

The night quickly passed by and the next morning came with some news.
