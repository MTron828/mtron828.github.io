Alice simply complied the binding magic gave her a weird tingling feeling that didn’t seem to calm down. She hated going anywhere near Sofia’s back-end yet she enjoyed the feeling of not being able to resist.

Without even realizing it, she was slowly getting addicted to the feeling of being tied up by that magic.

Cain was living on another planet, to him, Sofia felt like a fuzzy cloud of cotton, gentle and soft. Holding back slowly slipped from his mind as he craved that pleasant feeling. Without realizing it he had grabbed her from the hair, violently jolting in and out.

Sofia’s body twitched as she felt Alice’s tongue going in, that wasn’t a place she ever expected to have someone stick their tongue in, let alone another woman. As her hands reached down to her flower, a strong thirst tingled her throat, she wanted Cain to go even deeper.

Selena who was half asleep in the bathtub just watched them silently, to her she felt as if it was a dream.

Suddenly Cain got even bigger, to a point where she found it harder to breathe.

Sofia tried to push his hips away but to no avail, he was slowly going out of control. She could feel him getting more restless, quickly figuring out that the only way out was going even further beyond, mustering all the strength she has to move more violently than he did.

The fight between them didn’t last long and it ended with Cain’s loss. Sofia took pride in her victory.

Forgetting his exhaustion, Cain aimed for Sofia’s lower part immediately.

“Can you please stop for a moment?” Sofia’s sudden plea snapped him back to reality. “Is there any better place to do this, the cold and solid ground is digging into my knees?” Sofia had started to feel sore from kneeling for too long.

The upper room should have a nice bed, let’s go there.” Cain said, turning toward Selena.

Alice was feeling a bit grumpy from what she had to do, getting even more frustrated as she still didn’t get any action with Cain.

“How are you feeling?” Cain asked as soon as he noticed her expression.

“It was gross, I will do it again but with something in return.” Alice walked up to Sofia, “You better be ready!”

“Wait, it was him who wanted that, don’t take it out on me.” Sofia backed out, pushing Cain to the front.

“Calm down, for now, let’s head up so we can continue,” Cain said confidently.

At this stage, they helped Selena out, dried themselves up, and gave their bloodied clothes a rinse.

“So…how to do who up? Where are the stairs?.” Alice asked as she was getting a bit restless.

Hearing her, Cain walked to one of the changing room’s corners. From the ceiling, he managed to drop a rope ladder. “We climb this to get there, the tiles up there can be opened.” Cain climbed the ladder first, and the girls quickly followed after him.

The second floor was just one big bedroom, with a bed large enough to hold five people, a big table, and a decently sized couch. the floor was made of wood and the walls were made of marbled stone. A long red curtain with weird marks surrounded the bed giving it a unique look.

” It’s a bed-nya!” Selena rushed in to take a nap.

Sofia looked around and thought the place looked amazing. It was time for them to continue so she pushed a finger back there.

With what Cain asked of Alice earlier, she could guess he wanted to use it, ‘I wonder if it will even fit.’ She thought as she turned to look at Cain and Alice.

“Master, ah…master…I love you…” She was faced with them passionately kissing each other. Alice’s thighs were rubbing against each other. Cain quickly pushed Alice down on the bed where they continued.

Even though they fell right beside Selena, she didn’t seem to mind their existence and stayed asleep.

Upon seeing that, Sofia cooled down. Alice has taken her turn when she was occupied by the beautiful room.

Cain showered her with kisses, Alice’s body slightly twisted at the sensation. Going back and forth from her mouth to her chest.

“Come on, say it…” Cain gently squeezed her on the bed, “I wouldn’t go until you say it on your own.”

Alice quickly shut off her mind and released her primal instincts. Her slender pale legs wrapped around Cain’s hip with her tongue sticking out.

“Master…please ravage me!” Alice has found her new favorite things. Cain left her with the freedom to speak and move but took her ability to resist. She felt as if she was tied up, making her heart race faster and faster.

Cain wasn’t going too fast cause he was exhausted. Slowly going inside her, the both of them let out a faint moan.

Sofia had to wait patiently for her turn, the two were taking their time going as slowly as could.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Selena who was laying beside them showed no sign of interest, she was fast asleep.

…The two finally finished, Alice lay there with a satisfied face, exhaustion finally catching her she fell asleep.

Cain signaled for Sofia to come closer, It was her turn. She quickly made her way to him. “How should we do it?” She asked, hoping it was what she thought it was.

“Get her.” Cain showed her to the bed, making her stand on all four with her back slightly arced. Cain slowly pushed two fingers into her, trying to loosen her a bit.

To Cain’s surprise, she had already loose, at least more than he expected. She was playing with herself all this time. Cain slightly lifted her head to sneak a kiss on her mouth. She could feel him throbbing behind her.

“Tell me if it hurts, I will stop immediately!” Cain whispered in her ear with a slight lick at the end. Sofia could feel the thing pushing inside, it hurts a lot.

“Ahh!” She cried, Cain immediately stooped to check on her, “Does it hurt a lot?”

“Just a bit, go faster!” She felt an oddly satisfying feeling, she didn’t want to resemble it as a natural process so she kept her mouth shut for the time being.

Hearing her give him the grin light, Cain decided to push his luck even further. Combing her hair back into a twintail with his fingers, Cain grabbed into them like reins.

Sofia sneaked a look at him, seeing her face, he almost let go, “I mind, but go, I will have something for it later.” She was willing to compromise, which gave Cain the permission he needed. He didn’t want to force them into something painful, they weren’t Sylph after all, to his knowledge she was the only one who only sought pain.

Cain quickly picked up speed, drilling deeper and deeper into Sofia’s second cave.

“Ah! Ah! Ah!” The voices were mixed between the two, each time Cain pushed deeper into her she made a loud moan, when he pulled back she gasped for air. With each stroke, Cain could feel her inside contracting on him, with each pulse he let out a faint moan, slowly getting rougher to seek that feeling more.

Close to the end, Sofia had already burst several times, she had never expected it to feel this good. But by this time she was already numb back there, they have been going at it for some time and she was getting exhausted.

Cain who was at his limit grabbed Sofia even tighter. He did hear her gasp at the feeling but didn’t stop, it was just for a few seconds, she wouldn’t mind.

Grabbing her hair with one hand and arcing her body with the other hand, Cain hugged her body as he violently moved. Quickly releasing all he got inside her and letting go.

She fell flat on her face, dripping like a waterfall.

Cain next turned to the sleeping Selena, looking at her like that gave him another urge. ‘I remember she said it was okay before…’ Cain remembered their first night.

Cain looked for something to clean himself before moving to Selena, he didn’t find anything but the spare bedsheet close to the bed. This was made from magic so it will be rest the next time he summons the building, it was alright to make it dirty.

After licking Selena’s flower to his heart’s content, he slowly pushed in to not wake her up. Unknown to him, she woke up the moment he touched her but pretended to stay asleep.

It didn’t take him long to get absorbed and forget about being gentle and not waking her. He kept going until he got exhausted and fell asleep on top of her.

The night quickly passed by, and Cain and the girls enjoyed themselves more than they should be inside a cave.
