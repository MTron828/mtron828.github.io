Gracie greeted them as soon as they entered through the door, “Welcome home, do you want to take a bath or have dinner first?”

“Prepare the bath first, I don’t like bathing on a full stomach.” Cain replied as he took off his boots, “I will have dinner first then, I hope it has a lot of meat.” Zaleria said as she followed Cain inside, Elise guided her to the kitchen while Gracie showed Cain to the bath.

Gracie opened the bath door for Cain and entered after him, “I will help you take the armor off.” Cain could take the armor on his own but those back straps were annoying to deal with.

“Where are the rest?” Cain asked as he lifted his arms so Gracie can undo the straps.

“Lady Sofia is with the maids decorating her new room. Lady Selena and Lady Alice are down in the basement training on the prisoner.” Gracie replied.

“I thought Alice will take some time to get used to that,” Cain said with a surprised face but Gracie quickly explained, “She has only been using healing magic on her, the one wounding the prisoner is lady Selena and sometimes Sebas or me.”

Cain sighed, not realizing that Gracie had just dropped his pants down. “I wish she could use her curse instead, it’s really dangerous for her to not be able to fully control it.” Cain looked down, “When did you?” He was shocked to find that Gracie had already stripped him up.

“You were talking so you didn’t notice.” She replied standing up, “Please go ahead, I will follow you in a few moments.” She said waiting for him to get inside so she can change into her suit.

Cain got inside to the shower for a quick wash, after just a few moments, not even enough for him to get completely wet, Gracie followed him in.

“That was quick,” Cain said as he looked at her.

“I did train for it. Now please let me help you.” She took a bucket of hot water and poured it on his head, took a block of soap, and started washing his back.

“Tomorrow I will start your training with the rest so get ready,” Cain told her and he felt her hands stopping.

“And my job?” She asked as if unable to follow.

“You won’t be doing any maid work, tomorrow your job is to train,” Cain replied to her as he relaxed a bit. She was going to train the [Twinfangs] [Shadow magic] as well as the usage of her drool as a poison.

“I will keep that in mind.” She replied blandly and kept washing him silently. Cain was slowly getting used to her being with him like this.

After finishing the short shower, Gracie guided him inside to the hot tub where he slowly got inside, “The hot water always feels good!” He stretched his arms, and Gracie gently sat beside him.

“Would you like a massage or something else?” She asked laying her hand on his shoulder.

“If you please, my shoulder is a bit stiff even though I didn’t do that much moving today.”

Gracie quickly got behind him and started massaging his shoulder, “You have gotten better than last time. Ahh, that’s the spot!” He could feel her snap something in his upper neck and it felt amazing.

“Say, would you mind preparing three types of your special tea?” Cain asked as he looked toward the ceiling, Gracie quickly pushed his head down as he was getting in the way of her work.

“Three types?” She asked without stopping her hands.

“A light one, a medium one, and lastly just a sample of your droll. I want to test their effectiveness and utility as a poison.” Cain replied.

“Then I will have them ready as soon as you want.”

“Then bring them to my room tonight.”

After Gracie finished massaging his back she sat beside him again. Cain stole quick glances at her before asking. “Say, Lisa was the one to teach you the hidden blade, right? How did she find your talent in the first place?”

Gracie looked at him before opening her mouth, “She just ordered me to start training to be an assassin and I didn’t refuse.” Gracie’s reply was expected, with her condition it was less likely that she would care about reasons.

“Can you tell me about how you feel being a slave to Sofia?”

“I don’t feel any difference, it’s rare for her to give me orders,” Gracie replied without even moving her eyes.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“She gave you orders? Like what?” Cain asked out of curiosity.

“She asked me with Lady Alice to intervene whenever you’re with more than one of them. Lady Sofia had Also forbidden me from entering the room with she is with you and she had me convince the maids to let her cook in the kitchen.”

“Wow, this was the longest sentence I heard from you, I’m just happy non of her orders are bothering you.” Cain smiled as he stood up. “Let’s get out, I was getting a bit hungry.”

After they got out, Gracie quickly dried and clothed him in the changing room. “I will now and let you change, don’t forget the tea!” He said as he opened the door and headed toward the kitchen.

Zaleria seems to have finished eating a long ago but the girls have waited for Cain. As the maids have prepared them a special dinner for their recovery, Cain and the rest have eaten full of what was served to them.

After the dinner as they rested in the living room, The maids brought them tea as they watched the fire flicker.

Selena curled up in front of the fireplace to bathe in the heat while both Alice and Sofia sat at his sides. Gracie was preparing what Cain asked of her while Zaleria had just entered and sat beside Sofia examining her nails.

“You have done an amazing job with her, would mind doing me too?” Zaleria asked as she continued examining Sofia’s nails.

Cain looked at her and took a glance at Sofia’s face. “You’re a dragon and are already strong and durable. How about you let me try the hard ones on you?” Cain asked as he played with Sofia’s hand. Sofia looked at him wondering ‘What are you doing?’

“Hard ones?” Zaleria looked at him and Cain replied. “You know the buffs, right? I want to try the most painful ones on you before I get them on Sofia.”

Zaleria looked at him with a surprised face, breaking into a wide smile, “There are more than twenty painful buffs, are you saying you want to use me multiple times?”

Cain replied quickly as he already know what he want, “Yeah. You’re the only one who can endure that.” Zaleria sighed and said, “It can’t be helped, I will help with that!”

After thanking her, Cain felt it was time to head to bed so he stood up and helped Sofia stand with him. “It’s time to sleep, see you tomorrow!” He said as he walked Sofia by his side, she seems have already known what he want and had started blushing.

After taking a few steps Cain stopped and looked behind. “Why are you following us, your room is on the other side.” He looked at Zaleria who was following them.

“I want to spend the night with Sofia.” She said as if it was normal.

“No, you will be sleeping in your room tonight.” He pointed to her room and kept walking with Sofia. With a sad face, Zaleria slowly walked to her room.

As they entered his room, Cain gently closed the door.
