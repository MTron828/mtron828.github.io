Cain entered with Selena and Chad into the kitchen to have a quick meal. This time Elise ignored him when she saw him crunching on the raw vegetables. Selena on the other hand ate a raw piece of meat while Chad heated some leftover soup for himself.

Elise sighed, “There is some cheese in the store room that you can eat from it if you want.” she pointed out to a large goat cheese wheel that was in the next room.

“You seem more tolerant than the last time, did something happen?” Cain asked her.

“It’s bad for a maid to have a lot of friction between her and the master. Trying to get on your or the ladies’ bad side is just a ticket for the street.” Elsie sighed. She wasn’t in a position where she can talk up to him. Surprisingly, even Gracie who could talk back to Cain had chosen to follow his orders blindly. Probably that was the reason she rose to the position of Headmaid.

Cain stared at her as if he was thinking, “Well, I’m a mage. There is a clear difference between nobles and us. So for ethics, you find a whole lot in me. And that’s a good thing!” Cain smiled.

“In which way is it a good thing? You should act the part right?” Elsie replied.

“Remember the first day you yelled at me at the door? If I had any noble ethics I would have you whipped for that. Jamima as well for her constant nagging about Suzan the plant. A normal noble would have already dragged Ellie to his bedroom for her attitude against me and Sebas.” Cain said while smiling.

Elise’s face went pale, it was true that they all have stepped over the line a few times. If he wasn’t lenient with them, they could have been dismissed long ago. “That…”

“Did you realize it just now? Even our conversation now is technically out of the line for a maid to have with her master. Being this lenient is good for both me and you.” Cain explained as he finished his meal.

“I get to act freely and do what I want and you maids get to work with ease of mind. A win-win for both of us.” Cain patted Elsie on her head.

“That’s a good mindset,” Chad said with a smile.

“Master…It’s just…” Elise seemed to have something to say but couldn’t get it out. “Don’t worry, feel free to act as you want, and I will act as I want. As long as your actions don’t bring harm to the family, no one will bite you on it.” Cain stretched his arms. It was time to hunt.

After that the three of them left the kitchen, Elsie smiled. “He is different isn’t he?” Alice said as she entered through the door.

“Lady Alice…You have been listening to us all this time?” Elise looked at her in surprise.

“I heard a bit. This is probably the reason we all love him. Just let him do his things.” Alice replied with a blush on her face.

“Here, drink this!” Cain pulled an MP potion from his pocket and handed it to his father. “You might need…What happened to your stats?” Cain gasped, this was the first time he had a close look at his father’s stats since he evolved.

“What do you mean?” Chad replied with a confused face.

“All of your stats are 28 except charisma which is 30? Your maximum MP seems to have taken a major hit. It’s resting at only 135. And most importantly, how the hell did you evolve into a high human?” Cain tried to explain what he was seeing as simply and quickly as he can.

“You can see stats? And stop joking, I didn’t evolve, I’m still a human!” Chad denied everything, he seem sincere.

“I’m not joking, you have evolved. Did you do anything strange?” Cain was serious.

“I only remember pushing over my limit when I saw you dead.” Chad mumbled, “Is there a way to reverse the evolution?”

‘Even Zaleria have noticed a difference in him, this evolution didn’t have in one go. His anger at that time was probably just the trigger. His body was already crying to evolve.’ Cain thought.

“Not that I know of, but I will look for one if you want. But if you take my advice, a High human is just a better human. A human who is more human than the rest of humans. You should accept evolution as a natural process just how people grow old.” Cain explained his points of view.

“High humans are more human humans-nya? That doesn’t seem right-nya.” Selena seemed confused at what Cain was saying.

“It doesn’t matter. Father, you should try high human for the time being.” Cain suggested and Chad agreed, not like he have a choice.

“A man will never cry about what has already been set in stone, we live with it and keep moving forward. Let’s move!” Chad stood tall, a distant look on his face.

“You’re right, we don’t have much time so have this!” Cain touched both his father and Selena on their backs. They both suddenly started floating [Fly]

“What is this-nya?” Selena cried, she was finding it hard to stand straight. In a few seconds, she was stuck upside down. Chad on the other hand didn’t seem bothered, just impressed.

“Just like you did with the horse?” Chad asked.

“That’s right! You can fly on your own right?” Cain replied.

“Of course, I’m more worried about her.” Chad pointed at Selena who was already giving up. Her eyes were spinning.

“I will control her spell, Let’s head out quickly, I do want to give the maids some time to butcher what we’re going to bring.” Cain started flying and Selena followed him. “I’m moving-nya?” Selena gasped as she saw the ground move further away.

“I’m controlling your flight so don’t worry, we will reach the forest quickly,” Cain said with a smile.

After about a minute, they reached the edge of the forest. As soon as they landed, Cain used [Detect creature] his aim was a certain delicious monster.

Gorgon’s mead tasted like dry-aged beef, which was something to behold.

“We’re going to hunt Gorgons, those iron bull monsters. I already detected a group of four in the forest so get ready.” Cain said as he cracked his fingers.

“Gorgon? They can petrify people. Are you two going to be alright?” Chad stared at Cain.

“I’m quite used to fighting them. And I challenge them to try and petrify Selena while she is in her beast form. They need to knock her out of the transformation first.” Cain said proudly. His spells were more durable and refined than the beast’s inborn magic.

Hearing that, Selena immediately transformed into her Black jaguar form. “I can smell them from here-gaw!” Selena growled.

“You picked the gorgon smell?” Cain was a bit confused.

“I remember the smell of their meat from the last time we had them-gaw. I can’t wait to have a bite-gaw!” Selena licked her fangs. To her, they were just moving buffet.

“Then let’s head out, all the gorgons are hanging together so it should be easy to take them down,” Cain said with confidence.

It is time to hunt.
