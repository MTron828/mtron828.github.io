Cain woke up to see Sofia standing by his head, “You seem to have had a good night’s sleep.”

“Alice told you yesterday that I woke up?” He asked, seeing her pouting face gave him the chills.

“We have felt your magic. We decided that she would spend the night with you since she can heal.”

They didn’t want to jump at him all at once since he could still be hurt so they decided to go with Alice which was the safest option.

It was snowing outside so he decided to spend the day at home and rest, otherwise, the girls would have eaten him alive for overworking himself.

…

Sebas approached him at the breakfast table to relay some important news. It was about the sighting of the royal army in the distance, they should be here in the evening.

“Man, Gracie still hasn’t reported to me yet.” Cain sighed. All he wanted to do was enjoy his breakfast without having to worry about such things.

“He is right Sebas, leave it until we finish eating.” Alice followed up.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“But it’s the royal army…The eldest princess is coming as well, we have to prepare.” Sebas knew that if they came, their first target would be Cain who managed to push the undead army. As the butler, it was his duty to get his master in a respectable shape so he will not embarrass himself.

“If you’re worried about her, you’re just wasting your time. The eldest princess isn’t leading the knights with feathers and roses.” Cain said as he sipped the tea.

“What do you mean?” Sofia asked and Cain looked at her, “She is more of a smelly knight than a princess, she will look down on us if we looked prestigious.” Cain replied as he remembered what the princess looked like. He only saw her a couple of times in his past life. She was leading the relief force after the catastrophe.

“Then…we should welcome her like knights-nya?” Said Selena as she munched on a piece of raw meat, the maids have started to get used to always leaving an uncooked portion for her.

“Not necessarily, we should just be ourselves.”

“Sebas…” Alice stared at the butler, “See, don’t deliver us new like this at the table.” Alice didn’t like it when Cain was talking and not eating. She noticed him leaving about a third of his platter as he started thinking.

“And you Cain, please finish your food first.” She gave him a scary smile. The other might have not noticed it, but Cain got a bit thinner over the last week, it was an indication that he was overworking himself. The least she can do is make sure he is eating well.

With Alice’s sharp glares, they continued to eat in silence. After that Cain called them to his room. After listening to Gracie’s report he decided to tell them what he intended to do.

“We will follow the Guildmaster to the Fenrir village, I’m worried something might have happened to the beast god,” Cain said with a worried face.

“A god is living there-nya?” Selena seemed confused, she never heard of that.

“Well, he isn’t a real god. That is just a title. You can call him their village chief.” Cain explained. Gods can’t walk in the mortal plane. This means that if anyone approached you claiming to be one, they are a fraud.

“And what about the dungeon? It was a remnant of Amaterasu’s power you know?” Alice added surprising the other two.

“I know, I could guess that just by looking at the sky. This is one of the reasons she is considered an evil god in some places. But…Something else is worrying me.”

“What is it?” Sofia asked.

“I can understand if it was just Ourals lord, but why would Morena bother with this city of all places.”

Cain stared toward the window, racking his brain for an answer.

CRACKLE! A red light flashed in the distance and soon was followed by an explosion big enough to tear the top of a mountain. Cain and the girls fell to the ground as the earth shook violently.

[Teleport] Cain immediately teleported toward the location of the explosion leaving the girls back in the mansion.

Even though it was just a few moments ago, he found no one there. The top of the mountain was blown off and still red hot, the traces of magic here were going wild indicating that no ordinary people did that.

After inspecting the area, Cain’s face tensed up. He found traces of the magic of dragons, three wyrms. A lightning one, a poison one, and an ice one. But, they were all dead, their magic was already fading. What worried Cain is the magic of the being who just killed them, it was almost identical to that of Sofia, just several hundred times denser, similar to that of a great wyrm.

He started getting confused, It can’t be Sofia, she was with him and she didn’t have this kind of power. It also can’t be Zaleria’s mother since Sofia had already awoken her blood meaning that she was dead.

Who could it be? Where are they?

Cain inspected the place and found nothing else; The evidence was burned to ash.

Alice was trying to teleport to him with her link but he was blocking her. If a great wyrm was around it isn’t safe for them to be close.

After about half an hour of fruitless efforts, he decided to return to the city and ask if anyone has seen anything. [Teleport]

No matter how much he asked, they all only saw a red flash of light. The only strange thing he found was that the city bath was closed. The people living beside it said that the old lady working there has went missing after the siege.

He returned empty-handed to find his mansion in chaos, everyone was freaking out and he had to calm them down. The girls gave him an earful for rushing out like that and the maids looked worried if another catastrophe was about to happen.

After explaining what he found, excluding the fact about Sofia’s magic being there. He blamed it on a territorial struggle between dragons.

It was true that if that great wyrm wanted to do harm to the city, he would have already done it instead of killing the other three dragons.

It didn’t take long before Leon can in freaking out as well and Cain had to explain what happened a second time and told him to stay on the lookout.

The royal knights didn’t arrive until the next day as they took a detour to inspect the blown-off mountain, their faces were tense seeing the destruction that happened in the blink of an eye.

The princess was certain that if she and the knight faced the thing, they would have been erased immediately.

Cain waited at his house, refusing to go meet them at the gate no matter how much Sebas bugged him over it. Cain even joked about dropping a meteor on them if they asked him to move to the capital which infuriated Sebas.

After a while, The knights were at Cain’s door. They have come to meet him before William as they have already met Leon at the gate.
