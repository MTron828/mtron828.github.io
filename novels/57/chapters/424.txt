They didn’t see his transformation, He should probably show it to them when the time is suitable. Cain leaped from one tree to the other with Gracie.

After a while he stopped looking around, they were almost in the middle between Selena’s home and the badger village they had just been in.

“Let’s stop here, this seems far enough.” Cain flicked his fingers lifting a chunk of dirt with [Telekinesis]

“You use that spell a lot,” Gracie commented.

“Wells it’s useful as I said before. It’s simple but effective. It applies a force to a target, depending on the direction and surface I choose, it can be a punch or a shovel, I can even use it to fly instead of the spell [Fly] but that would consume more MP” Cain explained as he opened a gate to [Lisworth’s magnificent mansion] in the hole. He wanted to hide the entrance after they get in since this was a wild forest.

“You exhausted, we made you fight right after waking…” Gracie looked sad, feeling it was her fault since she couldn’t finish all the cultists in time. She was just hungry, fighting while starving, she couldn’t do more.

“I’m exhausted, but most importantly is you. Aren’t you hungry?” Cain asked looking at her.

She glared at him, “Not that much, I’ve had Alice bring me some supplies.” Gracie replied she was sure Cain didn’t know about what Alice did.

“That isn’t a problem, in fact, it’s my mistake for not leaving you some. People like you with succubus blood only get extra energy from that, to my knowledge only full succubus can starve without it.” Cain explained.

“So do I have a problem?” Gracie asked.

“I don’t think so, it only means you have stronger succubus blood. I never experiment with Cubus that much to tell the exact problem. If I have to guess I would say a close one of your ancestors was a succubus, mostly likely a mother or grandmother and she must have breastfed you or something.” Cain explained while thinking, all of this was just speculation based on what general knowledge he has.

“So what do we do now?” Gracie asked looking at the door.

“Well, of course, feed you and then head back. The girls won’t mind me meddling in the order.” Cain said, he asked Sofia and Selena but didn’t ask Alice, Mary, and Marina. But he was sure they won’t mind.

Cain and Gracie walked into the magnificent mansion and he buried the entrance after that.

Stretching his arms inside, Cain could hear the beating of his three hearts inside his torso. A little tingling pain was scratching the back of his head, he seems to have overworked his body by transforming this early.

I need to calm down, “The ghosts should have already prepared a bath for us so let’s take a quick shower.” Cain touched his hair, there were still some stains of blood from the dragon fight.

‘Should I create a self-cleansing spell’ Cain’s first brain thought. ‘Water, wind, and a bit of telekinesis. With some tweaks, it can be done’ His second brain already mapped a plan.

‘No, we have an excuse to take bathes a lot often. Let’s delay it.’ Both brains then agreed not to do it upon seeing Gracie taking her clothes off. Cain’s third brain was the one to convince them.

“Where are you looking?” Gracie asked as she noticed Cain glare at her.

“Did you get a bit wider?” Cain asked, Gracie’s hips seems a bit wider than before. It was a small amount but enough for him to notice.

“I’ve been running a lot the past days, which might be the reason,” Gracie replied and then averted her eyes, “I lied, I’ve been eating a lot to compensate and it didn’t work.” She tried to lie but couldn’t.

Cain started laughing, “You don’t have to worry about anything, I quite like it this way. But keep it reasonable, get it?” Cain put his arm around her shoulder and grabbed her lower side.

…

Back in the mansion, Alice returned from her father’s house. Her Brother Leon’s condition seems to have stabilized. The idiot almost chopped his toes with a hoe.

Walking inside the mansion, Alice looked at her hand thinking about her own magic. ‘Destruction and regeneration, Rot and heal. I can effectively use them now.’

In Leon’s condition, she used the rot to eat away the damaged flesh and then regenerate it with healing magic. That yielded a better result and a more perfect recovery which was strange.

Who would have guessed that Holy magic and Devil magic would resonate this well together? The more she used them, the more they seemed similar on a deeper level.

“Do you have a minute?” Alice asked Ariel who have been lazing around.

“What?” Ariel stared at her, she was about to take a nap.

“Do you know why devil magic is so similar to holy magic?” She asked directly.

Ariel gave her a strange look, “They aren’t, calling the most conflicting types of magic similar is just wrong.” Ariel snorted, angels hated even the existence of curse magic that the devils use.

“I can feel that curse magic is just degraded holy magic that went wrong, who are devils?” Alice asked.

“That’s not for me to answer, ask your god if you want. The only thing that I can say is never bringing that to angel ever again.” Ariel replied with a sigh. “Can you get us a room in the maze?” Ariel asked.

“Yeah, Cain keeps a lot of empty rooms. He wouldn’t mind us using one.” Alice replied.

Inside the room Ariel was able to spread her wings and relax, it was hard staying in her humanoid form. Alice did the same and transformed into her Devil body.

Ariel took a deep breath and opened her hand, a golden blade of light appeared in her palm. “A holy weapon, most angels can conjure a few of them. I can do a longsword and a warbow.” Ariel swung her blade around. “They are devastating weapons, try making one.”

“I’m a devil, I can’t do that. Or is it a spell?” Alice gave her a disappointed look. She expected a lesson about holy magic but ended with this.

“Just try it,” Ariel smiled, it shouldn’t be that hard to do for Alice who can already reach such a high level of control.

Alice closed her eyes and started focusing on her hand, gathering holy magic and trying to form it in the shape of a blade. Each time she failed as the holy magic will just fall apart like sand.

“It’s impossible, I can’t maintain it.” Alice fell to her knees, her forehead dripping with sweat.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“You don’t need to maintain it if you compressed enough holy magic to force it to harden. Try again and this time uses more force.” Ariel said conjuring her blade over and over with a faint giggle.

“Don’t compare the experience you have to what I have, it’s easier for you who’s been doing it for a long time!” Alice yelled at her mocking laugh.

“Say what you want but I can just give you the answer, try harder is the best I can say!” Ariel said with a big smile. It was quite a bit amusing to see a devil struggle to conjure a holy blade. In fact, Ariel asked Alice to do that to prove to her how much holy magic is different from devils’ curse magic.

To conjure the blade, she at least need to stop all the curse magic circulating in her body or she will fail.
