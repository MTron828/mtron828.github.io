Colorful Balloons Take Flight

After making sure the boar was dead, Cain asked the girls to stay in the trees as he was sensing something big approaching. It was just then when Selena finally picked up the foul smell.

“The boar’s rotting corpse smell covered it for a moment but I smell a horrid stench-nya!” Selena yelled as she unleashed her claws.

“No, they are my prey!” [Fly] Cain flew away from the tree toward the incoming monsters and left the girls to watch.

[They smelled the rotten flesh so they came to feed, those ugly monstrosities!] His voice reached them through the link.

“My ladies, Behind the trees!” Gracie said pointing deep into the forest, Alice and Sofia’s faces went pale.

Three two-headed giants, almost 50 feet tall each. Growling with their cheek-less maws. Their eyes glowed green and they held tree trunks as clubs. Their lower side was only covered by their thick hair, they looked as foul as a pig that rolled in his waste.

“Three at once, won’t that be tough for you-nya?” Selena asked Cain who had already moved a fair distance away from them. He didn’t want them getting caught in the fight, those things can one-shot everyone beside him and Selena.

[That’s the point, I will get much higher exp taking them at all at once. Just sit and watch, and run if they started moving toward you.]

Cain landed on the ground, not even pulling his sword. He had reached level Seven long ago which meant he had access to fourth-tier magic. Taking those things should be easy with that.

“You, ugly Ettins. Look down here!” He yelled to get their attention, they slowly turned their faces from the rotten Giant boar to Cain.

Cain looked as small as a finger in comparison to their massive bodies. They were real titans standing ahead of him.

Silence fell for a second as Cain apprised their skills, they were strong, so much that they could probably give a B-rank party a run for their money.

GROAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! One of the Ettins screamed, both heads at the same time. BAM!, With its left foot he stomped the ground and with the other, he tried to kick Cain.

‘Idiot!’ Cain smirked as he lifted his hand.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

[Fourth-tier Magic [Stone Shape] Have been added to the system.] Dirt rose from the ground and solidified into the shape of a giant stone blade that was stuck to the ground. The ettin who was trying to kick Cain ended up kicking the giant blade and split his foot in half.

GRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! His powerful and painful scream shook the whole forest, as the monster lifted his foot in agony, blood splatted toward Cain.

[Mist step] Cain teleported to be in the same height level as the ettin head, evading all the blood. “Hay, and farewell!” [Fourth-tier Magic [Fireburst] Have been added to the system.] Cain released the spell directly into the screaming ettin’s left mouth causing that head to explode.

The other head being enraged and in pain, he took control of the body now that his brother was half dead and swung the tree trunk at Cain. The mere wind generated by that swing caused the girls to hold on the tree so they won’t fall off.

[Mist step] Cain teleported behind the ettin evading the attack as if it was nothing. “Come on, you can do better!” Cain said as he pointed two fingers at the ettin. [Fireball] [Lightning strike]

A lightning bolt launched from Cain’s left finger and and struck the ettin’s head, shortly after the fireball that launched from his right finger exploded in the in the same spot. Leaving a burnt gaping hole in the ettin’s second head. The gigantic monster started falling when Cain heart a loud stomping noise.

Thud! Thud! The other two ettin’s appeared at Cain’s sides swinging their tree trunks. ‘From left and right? Well they can’t think after all.’ [Mist step] Cain teleported up and evaded the attack.

The tree trunks smashed into each other and shattered into small pieces. Cain who was looking at them while being upside down point a finger at the middle of them.’ I would have forgotten this spell existed if I didn’t see it on that demon. All I have to do is make a focus point other than me and then…

[Gravity sinkhole] A small black dot appeared where the tree trucks smashed. An immense gravitational force pulled the two ettins together so much that they cracked their skulls at each other. The wood fragments that were in the process of falling have flown up and pierced the two ettins in the stomach and chest.

“I really do need a spell with high piercing power that can be used at range, let’s test this shall we?” Cain combed his fingers, [Firelance] [Enchanting: Size] [Enchanting: Spinning]

A Fire lance appeared on top of Cain’s head, with a fiery explosion its size doubled and it than started spinning wildly, Swoosh! The firelance launched when Cain pointed with his finger toward one of the ettins.

The firelance exploded at contact rendering the giant half bald head into a full bald skull with little skin. ‘It doesn’t have the durability to pierce through bones?’

Seeing his first attempt fail Cain immediately prepared another spell [Firelance] [Enchanting: Rigidity] [Enchanting: Spinning]

The firelance appeared again but this time it stayed the at the same size, it just got harder and started spinning like it did before. The two ettins have moved from each other in pain so Cain aimed at the one he already hit to finish him off if possible.

Swoosh! The firelance flew at a tremendous speed and pierced the ettins two heads and exploded on the ground with a loud boom. ‘Success! I should have played with lower tier spells more often before.’

Seeing the evil smile on Cain’s face, and seeing both his two brother dead, the last ettin decided to run away. He wasn’t ready to meet their same fate.

“Surprise!” Cain immediately teleported in front of the running ettin smiling, “Why are you running?”

Cain gently touched one of the ettins forehead. [Enchanting: Electric discharge] [Enchanting: Electric discharge] [Enchanting: Electric discharge] [Enchanting: Electric discharge] Combining all form of the to discharge a massive amount of electricity directly into the ettins head frying it’s brain and paralyzing the other head.

[Stone shape] As the ettin body was falling, Cain created a pointy stone pillar underneath him. The ettins second head fell directly on the pillar and had his brain pierced. Cain looked at the three massive corpses admiring his handy work, ‘It’s nicely done for only using up to fourth-tier magic, if I say so myself.’

“Now for the last step!” Cain lifted a finger and a small flame appeared on it, [Fireburst] Cain then burned the corpses to ash so they won’t spread any disease.

All the girls had to do was stare with their mouths open, No wonder Cain held his own against that demon.
