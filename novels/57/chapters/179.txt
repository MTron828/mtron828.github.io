Deep into the forest, a demon was making his way toward the bandits’ camp. ‘So that’s the one Morena talked about, I felt nothing special from him besides that absurd amount of MP, how could he have tamed Zaleria.’ Kayden thought.

He ran across the forest at an incredible speed while keeping his presence hidden. Being careful was not enough when facing Morena’s sister, her senses were off the chart.

Awoooooooooooo! His way was suddenly cut by dire wolves, ‘This what I get for hiding my presence, those insects think I’m a mere human’ Kayden slowly pulled his sword out and took his stance. He needs to finish this fight without using any magic or Zaleria might pick up on him.

Awoo! A wolf leaped at him from behind, and Kayden’s four eyes shifted back immediately with his sword. His blade whistled with the wind and the wolf was cut diagonally into four pieces.

“Feral dogs…” Kayden said it didn’t take him over a minute to finish the whole pack. He then proceeded to hurry toward the camp.

‘This feeling, the Lady is back.’ He finally relaxed and let his aura out, it was safe since he could sense Morena around.

“Ah, it’s the leader!” One of the bandits cheered as he saw Kayden at the camp entrance. “You lot, the leader is back, start the feast!” They started screaming and cheering, to them Kayden was the epitome of what they strive to become. A free man who can take what he wants with his strength alone, an unparalleled swordsman.

“Hey leader, come check what we got!” a tall lean man with a face that resembled a rat more than a human called to Kayden, a burning passion sparkled in his eyes.

Kayden did want to go meet Morena as fast as he could, but taking care of the gang was also important. He wasn’t able to care for them as he did before becoming a demon, but he still remembered what he has to do. People he once considered brothers in arms, now meant nothing to him.

Kayden respected those he remembers respecting before becoming a demon, he pretended to still care about those who he cared for before. This man calling him was such one, he remembers fighting by his side for years. They shared blood, bread, and sweat.

“What is it?” Kayden replied hoping the matter was quick, he didn’t have time now.

“Just look in the tent, we thought you should take the first taste!” The man smirked and entered the large tent.

‘Human women, did they catch prisoners?’ It wasn’t an uncommon occurrence, ‘Did they get some food for the winter?’ Kayden slowly walked into the tent. Inside were two women tied with hemp ropes. Their mouths were gagged with bandages. Kayden looked at them, “What is this?” He said with a passive voice, they weren’t food so what was the need to keep them here? That was a dilemma he couldn’t comprehend after becoming a demon.

“What do you mean what they are? We captured them as they were traveling the road and thought it was only right to let you enjoy them first.” The man sighed, he was happy that Kayden became stronger but he was sad that he became denser.

“Ah, that. I see, I almost forget about it.” After he became a demon, humans looked like animals to him. Sexual attraction wasn’t something he felt toward them, but he had to act the part as his past self did.

Cling! A faint sound boomed in the room, the two women were freed immediately as Kayden slashed their binds. “Whoah! Careful there. Don’t injure them.” The man gasped as he took a step backward.

Kayden scratched one of the women on her chin and nose as of he was playing with a cat. He was desperately trying to remember what he has to do in that situation. The woman wasn’t trying to lick his finger like how a dog will act so it was confusing him. ‘Yeah did she has a name? I better name it then!’

“What’s your name?” Kayden asked. The woman was terrified, this four-eyed horror was staring at her face directly. She gasped, her mouth opened and closed like a dying fish. In Kayden’s eyes, she looked like a dog panting. ‘She wants a name?’ He wondered.

“Your name is Lily, the other one is Lala.” Kayden said as he patted the other woman on her head, “W-who are you?” The second woman(Named Lala by Kayden) spoke and surprised him. His four eyes widened as he didn’t expect them to be able to speak, but how did he expect them to reply earlier when he asked for their names? Something was conflicting in his mind.

“My name is Kayden, your new owner.” He smiled at her, “Is it just the two of you?” Kayden scratched the woman’s cheek and ears. She was confused at his action but decided to act the part, she didn’t have the courage to tell him to stop.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“We were three, but…” The other one spoke but didn’t finish, Kayden immediately looked at her. “What did you say?” Kayden was still interested in them talking so he wanted to hear them speak more.

“We were three, but they killed her,” She looked at the man standing behind Kayden. “We also had two guards and they were both killed.” She added as she saw Kayden’s eyes twist left and right.

“Yeah, about that… She was a feisty one indeed, stabbed John in the guts with a knife.” The man scratched his head. “So we ended up killing her, the man almost died because of her!”

Kayden looked at him with a passive face, he then looked back at the two women. He then looked back at the man and then back at the women again, and again and again.

Kayden then started patting the woman on their back, belly, hair, chest, and hands. They didn’t move a muscle and let him do what he wants…’Is he lying?’ Kayden’s thoughts were getting wild, they aren’t as feisty as the man behind him claimed.

Kayden stood and walked toward the man that was his best friend before becoming a demon. “What is it leader, do you want us to leave you…” Splat. Kayden punched the man in the face sending him flying outside the tent, he smashed into a tree and cracked his skull dying immediately.

“Wait, leader!” Before the other two men in the tent could do anything, Kayden sliced them both. He then turned toward the terrified women and patted their heads.

“No one will hurt you now.” He said in a gentle voice. At that moment other gang members rushed in. “Leader, what is this?” They couldn’t believe the sight in front of them.

“They killed one of my pets, I don’t need dogs like that,” Kayden said as he stood, he then searched through a box and took two leashes.

“N-no, we can follow you without those?” One of the women said. Kayden immediately turned toward her with a sharp gaze and shoved one two his fingers in her mouth. The woman understood what he was doing, this monster in front of her was mad, crazy. It was thinking they were pet dogs and was treating them as such, he was now testing to see if they would bite. He did just kill three of his gang members for them, for the time being, they should amuse his madness.

Kayden then took them to his tent where he left them with some food. His words were simple, don’t get out of the tent and eat your food. None of the bandits dared to go inside as they saw what Kayden did to his best friend over them.

After that, He headed toward a cave that was a bit to the north. The entrance was hidden by the trees and shrubs, an ominous aura spilled from the inside like a vicious stench. To Kayden however, it smelled like sweat, a smell that he found more pleasant than that of humans. The cave terrain quickly changed inside into what resembled a hallway, with a large room inside.

The room was made of stone and lit up by torches. In the middle lay a single large bed with a naked, brown-skinned woman with a face full of freckles sitting at the bedside. The woman was Morena, she had come to check on Kayden’s progress. In front of her, another woman with red hair and pink eyes was sitting on her knees. Her whole body was covered by burn marks from the acid. The woman was Meliliana the succubus. She was busy Licking Morena’s toes, as she might get killed if she didn’t do so.

“Who is this? You didn’t tell me you had such a toy.” Morena frowned as she kicked Meliliana in the face, “I believe I told you to act alone, didn’t I?” Her eyes shifted back to a dragon.

A Cubas was dangerous to have around him, this might wreck her whole plan. “Would you mind explaining why this thing,” She stood and Kicked Meliliana again in the face “Tried to seduce me,” Morena Kicked her again,

“The moment I entered through the door!” Even though she was just kicked in the face multiple times, Meliliana Scrambled to lick Morena’s feet again.

“I bet she thought you were just a regular woman, can’t you forgive her?” Kayden said with a passive voice. Slowly approaching Morena.

Morena looked at them and thought how strange things were going. She did in fact know who Meliliana was. It was her who guided the Cubas to settle close to Furberg in the hope she will interact with the lord’s Second wife. But that experiment failed and she now found that Cubas with another one of her experiments.

“So… have something to report?” Morena asked sitting back on the bed.

Seeing that Meliliana didn’t stop her work, Kayden stepped between them. “Would you mind letting her go?” He said with an ominous voice.

Seeing his serious face, Morena burst laughing and pulled Meliliana to the bed by the hair. “You better that I will do worse if I was truly angry.” Morena squeezed Meliliana’s neck in her hand.

“Teach her to behave in front of me next time unless you want me to skin her alive,” Morena growled, this was a serious threat that sent a shiver down Kayden’s back.

“Leave the report for later, Let’s have some fun with her shall we?” Morena’s attitude immediately changed.
