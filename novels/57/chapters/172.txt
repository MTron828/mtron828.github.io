Cain quickly jumped from his horse and started running toward the gorgon. ‘Its skin is made of hard iron, I can’t slice it in one go as I did with the Cobra. My wrist would snap if I tried’ Thinking of the best way to kill the gorgon.

‘I can’t just hit it with lightning from afar as I will end up burning its delicious meat, I have to kill it carefully’ Cain at that time was dual-wielding swords, one was his regular sword and the second was the one he conjured with [Elemental weapon]

“Hold up, it’s dangerous to go alone!” One of the soldiers chased after Cain to assist him in the battle. The other one sighed as he pulled his bow and started aiming. “I don’t think that my arrows would help but I will try.”

the gorgon mooed loudly as it saw them getting closer, a green fume started rising from his nostrils as he gouged the ground with his hooves. Its voice echoed through the forest where another two emerged, the gorgon wasn’t alone, there were three of them.

The soldier that was running with Cain stopped immediately, “Another two? No way, we have to…” [Thunder step] Cain launched himself before the soldier could finish. The next moment he was swinging his sword by the gorgon’s side, ‘I won’t harm such a precious cut of meat.’ Cain’s sword slashed at the gorgon’s skull, as he expected, his sword didn’t penetrate.

Mo..oo! The gorgon immediately fell to the ground unconscious, the electricity from Cain’s sword had passed by his brain and knocked him out. MOOOOOOOOO! The other two gorgons breathed their stinky green fume, and Cain got immediately alarmed by the large amount they exhaled.

[Thunder step] Clap! Cain flew to the sky in one go to evade all the fume. ‘What will look better? Fly or Marlin’s floating platform. Fly will look better, I will use the platform to move them later.

[Fly] Cain stopped mid-air. Even though fly was a third-tier spell, it was complicated enough to prevent the most caster from using magic with it, as they can lose concentration and fall.

“Fly away, we’re retreating!” One of the soldiers shouted when a mage used [Fly] in combat it meant that they are going to retreat. The soldier knew that so he wanted to cover up for Cain and ask him to retreat, he admired Cain but his friend was sure to spread words about Cain being a coward if he ran now.

Cain sheathed his swords and looked down at the gorgons, lifting both his hands. The ground underneath the two monsters started to shake and then four stone walls locked one of them in a tight enclosure. [Earth wall]

The other one immediately noticed that they were still under attack and tried to run away. “Why are you running?” Cain said as he created another stone wall between the gorgon’s legs, causing him to trip.

[Earth wall] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] Cain only increased the speed and power at which the wall emerged and summoned directly underneath the fallen gorgon. The monster went flying just about three feet above the wall and fell headfirst.

As all the monsters were knocked out Cain meditate and teleported to the ground with [Mist step], “Where did I but my dagger?” Cain pulled the dagger he was hiding behind the sheath of his sword and gouged the gorgons’ necks so they can bleed to death. As their necks were also covered with iron plates, he had to get the angle right and end them.

“Lord Cain, that was amazing!” One of the soldiers came rushing in after he saw that the battle has ended. “A monster as they said, how could someone who just became an adventure a few weeks ago get such strength?” The other one said under his breath.

“It’s simple, they were strong before they joined the guild. Never underestimate someone because they are new.” Cain replied to him and the soldier snorted.

Cain looked toward the sky, they should get back before sunset as he wanted to give the maids enough time to cook the meat. Even though gorgons were common monsters they were tough to hunt because of their iron skin. their meat was a delicacy that only nobles and royalty had the money to buy, Cain intended to take one for him, give one to William, and one to the dragon’s fang as a gift.

[Marlin’s floating platform], [Marlin’s floating platform], [Marlin’s floating platform]. Cain created three platforms a used [Earth wall] to roll the gorgons on them. The platforms were easy to push as they floated in the air which made moving the gorgons easier.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A lot of merchants who saw Cain and the solder dragging the gorgons approached them. “Hey lad, I will give a whole gold coin for one of the carcasses. Will you sell them all to me with 3 gold coins?”

“Don’t listen to him, he is trying to scam you! I will pay you 2 gold coins per carcass!”

“No, I will give you 2 gold coins and five silvers!”

Cain sighed inside, as long as the one approaching him was a merchant, it was a guarantee that he was trying to scam him. Why would a merchant want to buy something from you if not to sell it at a higher price? Cain preferred to enjoy the meat as he wasn’t in need of money with Leon’s backing now.

“Lord Cain, they are offering some extravagant prices, won’t sell them one at least?” Cain turned his head toward the soldier, one of the merchants was telling him to ask Cain to sell one carcass for 8 gold coins.

“Gorgon’s meat goes for 7 silver coins per pound, those things here have at least 500 pounds each. That is without counting the Iron skin and bones, I’m not an idiot to sell it cheaper than a regular cow.” Cain kept moving and ignored all the merchants.

‘If they want one then they have to hunt it themselves if they can. The gorgons are tough to hunt so most adventures will reject the quest.’ Even though can thought like that, what he wanted was to see Selena’s face when she taste such a lump of rare meat, their tribe who only hunted with claws and fangs must have never had such a hunt.

It is also a treat for his maids, gifts for the city lord and the dragon fang. And most importantly, He could ask Dolrig to make them weapons from the gorgon iron skin. He could even get a fancy weapon for Selena, and Takeshi could use it to repair his Nodashi after Morena melted its edge.

When can returned home he asked Sebas to get a carriage and deliver one gorgon to the lord and one to the dragon’s fang house. He also wrote a letter for Dolrig asking him to prepare for the work tomorrow.

As soon as she saw the gorgons, Zaleria volunteered to skin them as she had the strength to do so while the maids hurried to prepare dinner. Selena such a few chunks of meat to eat them raw, while Sofia went back to Evans inn with Cain to buy some of Mabel’s bread.

The night quickly fell and Cain refrained from telling Selena that she was getting a new Armor set. He also wanted Alice to try on some heavier armor, she had reached 20 in her wisdom so she now could invest in another stat. ‘Probably having her invest in constitution or strength will be good, like a paladin.’ Cain thought imaging her in shining armor.
