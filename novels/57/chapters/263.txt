Walking in the City with Seith, Cain drew a lot of attention. It was natural that most people knew him. However, the man standing by his side also intrigued them.

Cain could hear people whispering around them but none dared approach them.

After walking for a while, they reached the guild and Cain slowly pushed the door open. Everyone inside turned toward him at the same time.

“It’s him.”

“We thought he disappeared.”

“Who is that man beside him, don’t tell me it’s another monster.” He could hear the adventure whispering. It was true that each person that Cain walked with inside the guild had turned to be a monster. Sofia, Selena, and Zaleria.

Cain walked toward the counter and asked the representative.

“Have you seen Mary?” Cain asked with a charming smile.

The woman blushed as she fixed her tie, “Mary is upstairs with the Guildmaster.”

Cain smiled, “Can you call her for a moment?”

“The Guildmaster said to send you up to them if you arrived, I will lead you to them.” The woman then looked behind Cain and noticed Seith looking around.

“Who’s the…man?” She seemed a bit confused, with Seith having the head of a Black Jaguar and his size, he looked less human and more like a monster.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Seith is his name. He is Selena’s father, please treat him well.” Cain replied with a gentle smile.

Some of the adventures spat their drink and looked at Seith. Seeing his muscular body made it clear where Selena got her strength.

“Master Seith, are you an adventure by any chance?” The guild representative asked with her usual smile. Cain could sense that she was trying to recruit Seith due to his daughter’s achievements.

“No, I’m a hunter,” Seith replied.

“A hunter? Do you use bows? That is a bit unexpected.” The guild representative replied with a confused face.

“No, I use my claws and fangs. I never use weapons.” Seith lifted his hand and flashed his claws. They extended from his fingertips as the veins of his arm popped up.

The claws were sharp and a bit curved. He didn’t need to show her his fangs as the muscles on his neck were enough to show the sheer force he can output.

Cain stared at Seith. He was comparable to Selena when he first met her. The only difference was that his appearance gave the wild nature of his strength. Just by looking at him, everyone knew that he could bite his or her heads off.

“Would you care to join the guild?” The woman was about to start talking when Seith cut her off. “No. I only kill for food. I don’t intend to live the human life.”

The guild representative was a bit confused at what he meant. He is living the human life, right. Working as a hunter, selling the hunt. It is almost the same as adventure life.

Cain knew the difference. Seith didn’t sell his prey, he only hunted for food. They ate each game he captured. He also isn’t an avid hunter that hunts for fun or excessively, usually a single hunt can last them days so he rarely hunts. Add to that, he always hunts with his wife so he probably won’t be interested in group work with someone else.

“Let’s go, we shouldn’t keep the Guildmaster waiting,” Cain said as he pulled Seith with him.

Upstairs in the Guildmaster’s office, Alen was going through the papers with Mary. He seemed to be searching for something.

It was then that they heard knocking on the door. Alen could feel an unfamiliar presence that was quite strong but that is it.

“Come in!” Alen shouted and held a small wand in his hand.

The door opened and Cain walked in and Seith behind him. Alen’s eyes opened wide as he couldn’t sense Cain’s magic or presence.

“Cain, I didn’t expect to see you here so quickly,” Alen said with a smile.

“It seems to be working if even you couldn’t sense my magic.” Cain smiled. His abomination body allowed him to enchantment better, and with that, he was able to alter his presence to that of a fly.

To explain what presence is, it is the opposite of killing intent. If killing intent was the heat emitting from a flame, the presence is the smoke emitted.

The bigger and stronger the creature, the more inefficiently he burned Mana and the more smoke he emitted. Cain was simply using his Mana efficiently enough he emitted as little smoke as a fly.

“I was looking for you Mary, I need that list of dungeons,” Cain said as he sat on one of the chairs.

“First explain why did you leave me behind?” Mary rushed to him.

“Ask the girls not me. But even if you came you wouldn’t be able to help anyway.” Cain said as he poked his ear. In Cain’s past life, Mary went with an adventuring party as a guild when the Catastrophe happened. That party was forced to leave her behind since she was dragging them down. In the end, Mary was found dead in a goblin nest later.

“She is right, I believe I told you to bring her with you in my letter. That to you not bringing her I had to come back here.” Alen growled.

“You were planning to run away weren’t you?” Cain smiled.

“Of course, I can’t study magic here so I’m moving away. I would probably settle in the elvish kingdom at the end.” Alen said he was a half-elf after all. Yet this didn’t explain why he wanted Cain to bring him, Mary.

“And why did you want me to bring you, Mary, you could have run alone,” Cain asked as he poured some water for himself. He still hasn’t rested so his throat was drying up.

“Which father would run and leave his only daughter?” Alen growled and Cain spat the water he was drinking.

“Say that again?”

… On Alice’s side, she was rushing around with Lexi to count what they needed for the wedding.

She needed to give special attention to two major parts. The ceremonial wedding with Marina in Ourals and her own Marriage at Furberg since her father will throw a tantrum if it wasn’t done right.

When Alice discussed the matter with the other girls she got weird answers. Sofia was happy as long as it was a decent wedding and Selena didn’t care at all.

“It doesn’t need to be flashy, as long as we get married that’s all that matter.” Was what Sofia said with a blushing face.

“I’m already Cain’s mate, we slept together and hunted together. Throwing a party is just extra work-nya.” That was what Selena said as she was heading to take a nap in Cain’s room. The sun seemed to hit his window in the evening so she wanted to sleep in it.

Alice also asked Gracie and she got this reply. “We should carry yours first, I come later if we had the time.” It was now up to Alice to make this a decent marriage.

For that, she had to think of a good way to pull it off and ended up planning for two marriages. One for her, Sofia, Selena, and Gracie. This party will be held first at Furberg. They then will hold a second party at Ourals for Marina.

This was going to be a lot of work.
