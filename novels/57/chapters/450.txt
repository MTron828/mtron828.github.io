Majestic Desert Splendor

As they looked up at the volcano, a massive draconic hand emerged from the molten peak. Followed by two gargantuan wings, a draconic figure the size of Zaleria emerged, fire bursting from her scales.

A massive crimson dragon with two back horns pointing forward and two thin ones pointing backward, it looked like someone strapped black dragon horns onto a red dragon.

As it glared down on the battlefield, the volcano erupted behind her releasing a massive could of black volcanic ash. The violent wind quickly started to blow around the peak as green acidic rain flooded the place.

Walking down a path of boiling acid and Magma, she only saw the one bastard who beheaded Cain.

KABOOM! Flame erupted from under her claws. Her massive body instantly accelerated in a burst of flames. Even though she is in a draconic form, she still didn’t use her wings to fly, but to steer toward her target.

The volcano side cracked and an avalanche of fire and brimstone swooped down.

The dragon transformed immediately to block her charge, even with this, she shouldn’t top his physical strength. No one in the world should in fact.

He was almost twice as big as her and holding his arms up, he was ready to tackle her down.

BAM! The moment she got close, an explosion bloomed under her hind feet propelling her massive body upward, she leaped over the dragon opening her jaw toward him.

What came out wasn’t flame, but a flood of boiling acid.

The dragon growled as he turned his head toward her, “This presence, you’re not the same purgatory witch. Are you her daughter?” The dragon was thrilled to see her.

The last purgatory witch, Zaleria’s mother. She was a fire dragon who married a black dragon. In her lifetime, she learned acid magic from her husband while perfecting her fire magic. One day the dragon king was looking for mates, he was aiming to make a powerful son, and she who wielded a massive amount of power was a premium pick.

As expected, she refused. But in the dragon’s world, it doesn’t end with just refusing. As the king wanted to take her by force, her husband bailed out as he wanted no problems with the king. In the end, she had to fight the king alone to defend herself.

Everyone expected the fight to be quick, just a few hits and she will surrender. But that isn’t how it went. She wiped the floor with the king, no matter what he tried, she just pummelled him down.

Fire? She was immune. Acid? She just deflected it with magic. Cold and Ice? She could just melt it with her fire. Toxin? She just burned it, and even the little that got in her system was quickly neutralized by her high body temperature. Lightning? She just tanked it like it was nothing.

The king found himself at a massive disadvantage as he lacked her skills in witchcraft and battle experience. She even gave the king a nasty scar on his neck that never healed, a testament to the day he almost died to an angry housewife.

But since that day, their family shattered. She picked up her things and left. Zaleria and Morena who were still small stayed with their father for a few decades before Zaleria decided to run away from home to search for her mother.

“Show me, the power that beat the king!” The dragon growled ignoring the pain of the acid burning his back, and opened his jaw to breathe fire at her.

BAM! Chad leaped in and punched his jaw closed. “You still haven’t dealt with me.” [Thunderous Smite]

Roar! Zaleria also rushed in biting the dragon on his tail and pulling him away. The dragon raged, turning toward her with a claw strike.

From Zaleria’s back, Farryn leaped in and smacked his claws away, deflecting the hit. At that moment, a massive black slash passed through, Kayden was standing on the side sweating after delivering a downward swing, and the dragon’s tail fell to the ground.

Farryn looked down in shock, ‘Did that demon just slice a great wyrm tail like that?’ it was almost unheard of unless done by a high-ranking general in the elvish army or the top of dark elves sword maidens.

The dragon’s body burst into an infernal rage, forcing everyone to back away beside Zaleria and Sofia who could endure the heat. Even Chad didn’t risk it. He knew that if his heart got burned he won’t be healing back.

Sofia opened her jaw again, splashing with another acid breath putting his flames out. Zaleria took the chance and swung a punch at his face.

The dragon easily caught her hand and snapped her elbow, you lack strength.

Swiii! Another two steel arrows came flying in, this time the dragon was awaiting it so he managed to catch it with his hand. “You take this!” He threw them at Sofia.

Sofia took the hit with her right wing, swooping down with a fiery stop.

“Not at that size!” Zaleria tried to warn her, she was in a draconic form. Using moves that were designed for a humanoid body can cause her to injure herself. That possibility is further increased by the addition of her fire jets.

Sofia could care less, there was always healing magic. If it was just pain, it would stop her from turning this bastard’s head into ash.

[Burning feet] She kicked the dragon’s head to the ground. BAM! BAM! She didn’t stop and stomped him again and again until he forcefully stood back up.

[Burning Hands] She started punching, Zaleria quickly joined her as she had no better idea.

Chad, Kayden, and Farryn couldn’t find a good time to leap back into the fight without breaking Sofia and Zaleria’s focus. Those are finally getting in some good hits and the dragon should be getting exhausted by now.

They can’t let their guard down, a great wyrm won’t die until you completely destroy his body. They might be able to keep him at bay but they are far away from killing him. They don’t have sufficient firepower to finish him.

And then, the dragon swung his claw at Zaleria’s neck, She had failed to dodge in time. ‘This is fine, I will survive and take off his eyes’ Zaleria was ready to sacrifice her head to blind him.

CRACK! The dragon’s claw stopped at a semi-transparent prismatic wall, at that moment, silence fell for a second. Not many defensive spells could block a strike from a great wyrm.

A wave of strange aura started coming from behind the maze gate, it wasn’t blood lust and not an oppressive presence. It was creepy, scary, and sharp, like the feeling you get when walking alone in the dark. The feeling of an unknown monster glaring at your back and following you.

“Move away from him!” Cain growled as he walked out of the gate, two veins almost bursting on his brand-new head. He had seen the condition Selena and Gracie ended up in, he remembered how his father was charred.

“You survived?” The dragon growled.

“We won’t retreat, we need to work together and…” Zaleria tried to argue but Cain gave her a sharp glare.

Sofia had already retreated the moment Cain spoke, “Grandma, do as he says!”

“Everyone, let Cain deal with him. Come here to get healed!” Alice called them from the gate.

“Like I would let you run away!” The dragon suddenly released his breath toward the gate trying to burn Alice who just called.

Cain suddenly appeared between them lifting his hand up. A golden circle appeared behind his back that quickly turned into a flaming circle, two short wings of flame appeared on his shoulder blades and his legs and forearms got covered with an armor of flames. [Investiture of flames] [Enchanting] [Enchanting] [Enchanting]

The dragon’s breath splashed around like a water stream hitting solid rock.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

BAM! Chad leaped in and punched the dragon in the back of the head, “You already killed him once!” Chad growled.

CRACKLE! [Thunder Flash] Cain took the chance to flash directly and slash the dragon taking off its eyes. He tried to behead him but the dragon dodged immediately. ‘Guess having sixty strength make you this hard and fast.’

“You’re alive?” Chad stared at Cain.

“Guess we’re both hard to kill,” Cain replied.
