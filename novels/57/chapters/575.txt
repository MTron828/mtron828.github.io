Cain glared down as the rain fell behind his back, 'What is his deal‚Ä¶' He thought about why Mammon got considerably weaker than before. Yet after just a few moments, he realized it. the magic of the layer is slowly going to Alice.

"Hell Layers give power to those who share its characteristics the most." Avernus has a lot of elements rampaging, those it is ruled by Tiamat the multi-colored dragon. The Second layer is filled with molten Iron this was ruled by Dispater who can command Iron.

Alice stared at Cain talking to himself with a surprised face. "Cain, are you okay?" She asked with a worried face. Gently patting his back.

"Yeah. I'm fine." Cain replied with a smile and shifted back to his human form. He looked down toward Mammon and then looked at Alice. "See this whole layer? What do you feel?"

Alice looked around her, sensing the flow of curses in the layer. "It is, filled with rot, poison, and vile pollution."

Cain then smiled, "How do you think it goes with your curse? Cain, you handle it?"

Alice stared at him surprised, unable to understand what he meant. "I won't live in that rotten forest down there. We won't be moving here no matter what‚Ä¶"

Cain laughed, patting her head. "We're not moving here. I was just asking if you could fuel your curse directly from this layer. If that was the case then it is possible for you to rule it as Sofia does to Avernus."

CRACK! Mammon leaped from the ground, his bloodied body still holding vigor unmatched by humans. "I can hear you bastards, this is my layer. Get out‚Ä¶" He shouted swinging his staff at Cain.

ZON! Cain instantly teleported away with Alice in his arms. "Hey worm, I'm with my family here. Show some respect!" Cain yelled at him.

Mammon smiled, [Power word Death] Aiming down toward the city, As Cain followed his finger, he saw what he was aiming for. Selena‚Ä¶

Cain snapped, releasing all of his mana at once. Accelerating to incredible speed in the hope to reach Selena before she could hear the word. She didn't have high intelligence or wisdom to resist a ninth-tier spell.

Selena looked up, seeing two white wings blot the sky. "GRWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" Chad screamed his lungs out from Ariel's side, muffling the spell.

Thud! Chad took a step ahead glaring at Mammon in the sky, Cain who was mid-way, and Alice at the back. Ariel sighed in relief that they were safe.

Chad took a deep breath and then exhaled it. "Alice suddenly disappeared in the middle of her training with Ariel. I immediately thought that something bad must have happened‚Ä¶"He glared at Cain and Alice with a relieved face. He then glared back at Mammon with anger.

"A human‚Ä¶no, what is an angel doing here?" Mammon stared down confused.

"Cain, Alice, sit away. I will clean this one." Chad said opening his palm toward Ariel. She sighed and then conjured a holy longsword for him.

"This is lord of the third, he isn't like Dispater‚Ä¶" Cain yelled. Last time he sent his father to fight Dispater because he knew his father has the advantage, even with that he sent Kayden with him as well.

Cain shouted, "Mammon doesn't understand magic, all of his spells come from countless gems embedded in his body. We can't know what kind of magic he can use." Immediately flying toward Mammon.

Thud! Chad leaped up as well. The two quickly surrounded the devil of the third. "Tch!" Mammon opened his arms, [Shockwave] trying to blast them away.

Cain lifted his finger [Dispel magic] Immediately Cancelling the spell and Chad went in with a swing of his sword. Slash! Mammon dodged, but only the tip of his tail got sliced.

<HP: 2654/5450><HP: 2567/5450>

Cain swung his body, sending a kick toward Mammon's head. [Shockwave] BAM! The hit landed as it was timed perfectly but Mammon wasn't fazed that much.

<HP: 2567/5450><HP: 2523/5450> Mammon immediately twisted his head, Grabbing Cain by the foot and throwing him at Chad.

Chad caught Cain with his left hand and swung the sword in his right at Mammon who blasted himself away with [Wind Blast]

As Chad was holding him, Cain waved his staff [Teleport] immediately getting them right behind Mammon. Chad swung a kick [Divine Smite]

Mammon turned around, it was a bit too late for him to completely dodge. CRACK!

<HP: 2523/5450><HP: 2006/5450> He spitted blood [Wind Gust] The wind blew the blood back at Cain and Chad.

Chad was about to charge immediately when Cain raised a barrier between him and the blood. "The blood is dangerous‚Ä¶" Only those words were enough for Chad to understand. He threw Cain away and grabbed the sword with two hands.

BAM! As if his muscles cracked, the explosive speed generated by his strength was godly. CRACK! The divine blade cracked from the sheer force causing Ariel to stare baffled. The shattered blade flew toward Mammon and stabbed his shoulder before disappearing.

<HP: 2006/5450><HP: 1785/5450>

Chad stared at the disappearing handle in his hands, "Such a flimsy blade, those are better." He dropped the hand. BAM! And he disappeared.

Mammon who was still recovering from the holy magic tearing his body wasn't able to follow Chad's movement. Thwack! A punch landed on his face, he tried to leap away but Chad grabbed him by the face. [Golden Shield of Mammon]

"ORA!" A single punch to the chest. He felt it. Mammon's golden scales were hard, they took most of the hit.

<HP: 1785/5450><HP: 1710/5450>

"You can't harm me without your sword, Human!" Mammon growled.

Chad lifted his fist, his eyes glowing golden "Who said that?" CRACK!
