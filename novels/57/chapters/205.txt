Edward rushed as fast as he could, slashing the zombies left and right. “There is no end to them!” He screamed as he started picking up speed, “Layla, support me with fire magic.” He called one of the mages he knew, she snorted back at him and pointed her staff in his direction.

“You know I have bad control, don’t blame me if you get burned!” She screamed warning him. It was hard for them to hear each other due to the loud growling of the undead. “Damn it, I almost see non of Ourals army. I never thought I would be so worried about not finding my enemy!” She added with a worried face.

“Unless we burn them, they will just turn into zombies. Instead of helping that idiot fight, burn the corpses that he leaves behind!” An archer screamed beside her as he released his arrow and took a zombie that was behind Edward.

Edward turned and finished the zombie by beheading him, an arrow wasn’t enough to kill such a monstrosity.

“A greater zombie is approaching from the west and a zombie knight is approaching from the east. Edward’s team please be careful!” A woman that looked to be no taller than four feet yelled in front atop the wall, “And they stink!” she added laughing.

“This better not be another of your sick jokes! Damn it, call for a tanker for us!” Edward replied to the halfling rogue immediately.

The rogue jumped inside the town to find someone beefy enough to tank, all the adventurers who were willing to participate had their own fight at the time.

The halfling rogue was about to rush back to the guild when she was stopped by a young soldier followed by two men holding tower shields.

“We heard you say, Sir Edward needed some to tank for him. Can we help?” The young soldier said holding his shield with determination in his eyes.

“Bean sprout? Follow me!” She did have time to be picky, as long as they were alive and had some weight to them they would be able to do something. Even though she was discouraged by seeing his leg shake and that is why she called him bean sprout.

They rushed back to the wall where she screamed again to get Edward’s attention. “Edward, I got you three idiots who want to help!”

When Edward looked back and saw the three soldiers use a rope to accent the wall his face grew pale. If they can’t take the fall how in the hell they can tank for him?

“You shorty, do you want them to die?” He screamed at her, “Look, they are shaking more than the pub dancer!” He added.

The rogue burst laughing, “I never thought of that, I will make sure to use it one day!”

“Sir Edward, please let us help!” The three soldiers surrounded him with their tower shields. They slowly pushed the zombies away and made sure Edward only face one at a time. They were also keeping an eye on the greater zombie and zombie knight approaching.

Edward recognized one of the soldiers as the scared one he saved earlier, “You are tired of living?”

“I’m tired of hiding, I can’t always hope to only fight humans.” The soldier said and stabbed one of the zombies with his sword from behind the shield.

“That’s the spirit, If only all soldiers were as crazy as you we wouldn’t be in this situation!” Soldiers were trained to face humans, not zombies and monsters. For the zombies, stabbing them won’t work and they won’t back down when wounded as humans do. And you can’t kill them if you don’t have the strength and precision to behead them.

[Firelance] The mage sent a firelance at the horde of zombies. “Don’t lose focus, we’re still in the middle of a battle!” She had to warn them as they were getting sidetracked by the conversation.

The zombie knight had gotten close, he was moving faster than the other, “Prepare to intercept him, I will take his head off!” Edward screamed clearing the two zombies in front of him.

With quick steps, the zombie knight rushed at Edward and thrust his spear. “Leave this to me!” The soldier jumped in holding his tower shield at an angle and deflected the blow.

“Nice!” Edward climbed on the soldier’s back and jumped behind the zombie knight and grabbed the rear end of his spear. “You’re mine!” swinging his scimitar at the undead’s neck.

“GRAA!” The zombie knight growled letting go of his spear and evading Edward’s strike. Thud he then followed it with a straight kick.

Edward took a step back while still keeping the spear in his hand, it was a bit hard to hold into it as he was also carrying his second scimitar. The zombie knight then pulled a throwing knife from his side pocket and threw it at Edward taking him by surprise.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Edward had to roll to the side to avoid the knife but he ended up dropping the spear, the zombie knight prepared to throw a second knife but he was stopped by an arrow to the neck followed by a firebolt to the head.

“Tanker what are you doing? Get in the zone!” The mage screamed at the soldier.

“Calm down, he is fast enough!” The archer seemed to be annoyed by her constant screaming, even though it was hard to hear each other while a battle is raging around them.

“Don’t worry it was just a minor slip, we will take this thing down quickly before the greater zombie arrives!” Edward yelled so they can hear him, the soldier had taken his position in front of him to provide cover.

BAM! They could feel the ground shake violently as the sound of something heavy smashed at the ground. Everyone looked in that direction even the zombie knight couldn’t help but stare.

“Wha…What is that!” Edward cried as he saw the massive disgusting monstrosity get formed from the zombie corpses, a titanic mass of rotten flesh and guts it stood almost 30 feet tall and groaned.

“A flesh golem, an undead monstrosity!” The halfling rogue screamed what she heard a mage beside her mumble

Thud! They saw Takeshi leap at the horrific without a shred of fear. “CHU!” They could hear him yell at the top of his lungs. In the next moment, his big Nodashi moved faster than the eye could perceive.

CRACK! BAM! The flesh golem got sliced into eight small pieces as Takeshi passed by him. Yamauba flew immediately after him with [Fireburst] burning the thing into ash so it won’t raise again.

“That quick?” The soldier couldn’t believe his eyes, those two took that monster so quick it wasn’t even funny.

“Why can’t you be like that?” The mage called out to Edward.

“Why YOU, can’t be like her?” He replied immediately to the mage.

As they were bickering like children, more of those flesh golems started to rise. The situation started to look hopeless.

…

At the back Morena was giggling, it seemed like she didn’t need the S-rank dungeon to take the city. Her cute creations are going to be enough. “That white-haired kid is nowhere to be found, my sister can’t interfere or I will blast the whole city with acid.”

An evil smile ran across her face, “I already won so, let’s blast it anyway…” She lifted her hands to the sky to prepare her magic.

Her magic pulsed but she tried to keep it hidden from Zaleria. If she felt her preparing ninth-tier magic she would fight back even at the cost of some lives. The spell she was preparing had an extremely wide range and a dangerous effect that was hard to protect from.

It’s a spell that rains acid on a wide area, the range, and potency of acid depend on the caster’s MP and skill. With Morena being an acid dragon, her acid potency is already at the Ninth-tier, for range she only needed to put enough MP into the spell to cover the whole city.

She grinned in excitement thinking about how much exp she will get by killing a whole city.

Suddenly the sky was getting covered with a disgusting green cloud that Zaleria immediately recognized. She immediately panicked and flew to the sky with her flames in her human form.

‘Where is she, where is she?’ She looked for Morena’s location, the only way to stop this spell now was to interpret the caster. If it was released then Zaleria has no way of blocking all the acid with how big the city was.

“I can’t sense her, that bit*h!” Zaleria yelled. She then took a deep breath and screamed at the top of her lungs.

“Hide underground! NOW!” Screamed in the hope her voice will reach the whole city, the only safe place was a few meters under the ground.

On the other side, Morena smiled at her victory.

“Ninth-tier Magic [Acid Rain]!” She screamed as the massive amount of MP left her body.

The clouds cracked with green lightning as they were to spill out what was inside them. At that moment, BAM!

The whole cloud covering the city got dissipated in a single powerful Mana burst. Morena and Zaleria looked at the clear sky with their mouths open.

There was a single, shirtless, white-haired guy standing in the middle of the sky. Staring down at the battlefield with his blue eyes.
