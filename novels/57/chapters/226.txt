“Kya!” The scream boomed outside, Alice stood and glanced at the door. “Cain, what…” When she tried to talk with him, he was not there. Kayden has disappeared as well.

…

“Listen well, you’re two weeks late on the payment. How do you expect us to keep protecting your business like this?” A thug kicked the scrawny man in the guts.

He coughed blood as his daughter jumped in to help him, “Memi you go home, I will be back later!” He pushed her away, this wasn’t a situation where she should be.

Wagner clenched his fist, they caught him when he was out shopping with his daughter. The magical lock he installed on his inn’s door only kept them away for a short time.

‘Damn those useless guards, why there those kinds of people inside the city.’ He couldn’t shake his anger at the guards who ignored his situation. He could swear that a patrol have passed by the alleyway and ignored them beating him.

“The little girl is staying with us until you bring us the full payment!” The man extended his hand to grab Memi.

[Blade flow] A blade sliced the thug’s arm from his knuckles and up to his shoulder.

[Teleport] A hand Grabbed the man before he could scream, erasing him from existence in front of the other thugs.

“Don’t attack out of nowhere like that, a kid is here!” Cain yelled at Kayden.

“You mean the little puppy? She will become fierce before you know it!” Kayden replied. He was seeing Memi as a scared little puppy with her father being an injured dog.

“What are you talking about? Did you have too many drinks?” Cain wanted to punch him in the face.

“Training dogs is my job, I know what I’m saying. Look, wild wolves like to bully guard dogs.” Kayden pointed his sword toward the thugs; their faces twisted in front of him and resembled wolves.

Kayden lifted an eyebrow, “Are they standing on two legs? Werewolves?” He mumbled.

Cain looked at the thugs, they did not look nice but they are humans. He had no idea what Kayden is talking about. “Be them, humans, wolves, or dogs, don’t just go around killing them!” Cain was worried Kayden will Cause a massacre in front of the little Memi.

“I told you it will be alright, just watch.” Kayden’s body throbbed, and extra two pairs of eyes appeared on his facing making him have a total of six. His arms were covered in black veins and his demonic aura swelled instantly.

“Take her and run away, we will deal with this!” Cain yelled at Wagner to carry Memi and run.

The man grabbed his daughter and raced away.

Cain looked at Kayden. The last time he saw him, he only had four eyes. Now they were six. His demonic aura seemed to be deeper and darker, yet it was cleaner. To be more exact. Demons’ aura resembles a mud. Kayden’s aura resembles Tar.

To compare it with Alice’s aura that felt like a mix of crude oil and honey.

He was stronger than before, more than what a single level would make him.

[Demon Will sword] [Triple Slash] The next moment, Both Kayden and Cain disappeared without a sound.

Slash! Five of the thugs were cut into four pieces each and Kayden appeared standing in between them. His blade was as clean as when he pulled it out, [Teleport] Cain quickly sucked the small pieces into his maze before they could cause a mess.

The remaining thugs started to run away upon seeing the horrid sight.

[Arcane Gate] [Hallucinatory Terrain] Cain covered the Alley end with his Gates and covered them with illusion. The thugs wandered right in like mice.

“Where did they go?” Kayden said as he looked around him, “Hallucinatory Terrain?” He seemed to sense Cain’s magic, which was expected, as he know the same spell.

“Let’s go, do you want to fight them?” Cain opened an Arcane gate for Kayden. He wanted to see him fight more so he can learn his abilities. Moreover, if he is deemed a threat, he can imprison in the maze.

“Hoho! What a neat skill, did you prepare a pit for us to watch a fight?” Kayden happily walked in, he seemed to see it like a dogfighting pit.

Inside the maze, Kayden found himself standing in a white room while being surrounded by confused wolves (Thugs). ‘Did I fall in the pit?’ he thought as he expected to see the wolves fight.

When the thugs noticed him, they looked around and decided it was better for them to fight him all at once.

They surrounded him with their blades brandished. “Give up, let us out of here and we might let you live!” One of the thugs growled.

“Kill them; I will help you if you want!” Kayden heard a voice from the top left corner of the room. Cain was sitting on a black throne watching them.

“From when humans did fight dogs in a pit?” Kayden growled at Cain, his eyes twirled around as if they belonged to a chameleon.

“Easy, easy now. You are a swordsman, you can kill them, right? This is what you were about to do earlier, I just prepared a nice place for you to do it.” Cain said he had started to test how he can interact with Kayden and if there was a way for him to be useable.

‘Each demon has his madness. This man has been mentioning dogs, puppies, and pits all the time. That must be a leader.’ Cain thought as he looked down at Kayden.

Kayden looked at his sword; in his eyes, it looked like the stick he used to whack violent dogs and wolves. A wooden stick.

The more he looked at it, the more it started to look like a sword again. Kayden didn’t feel that the change was strange, it somehow felt natural to him. ‘Yeah, my stick is a sword.’ Like A man stuck in a dream. He believes in all the strange things that happen around him.

“Attacking puppies is punished with death for wolves!” Just like how farmers would kill the monster and wolves that attack their sheep, Kayden will kill the wolves that attack the puppies he is training.

Thud! His body disappeared. Whack! He kicked one of the thugs in the head, blowing his skull to pieces. Kayden then twirled his blade as if drawing a circle with the tip [Gravity sinkhole]

The small black dot pulled all the thugs at the same time and Kayden swung his blade. He released the spell just when his blade connected; causing all the thugs, he missed to be sent backward.

[Gravity sinkhole] He pulled them again and swung his blade taking another group of them.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He couldn’t do this again, it was inefficient whit what little of them stayed. “DIE!” One of the thugs screamed swinging his mace at Kayden’s head.

[Gaseous Form] Kayden’s body turned into black mist and the hit passed right through him, “A backstab, as expected of a wolf!” Kayden said with a passive voice.

Slice, he sliced the thug in half from head to groin. Thud! He disappeared again.

Cain knew that movement was different. Before he was using his innate skill [Limited Teleportation] But now he just ran, he accelerated fast enough that the eyes couldn’t follow him up close.

Of course, Cain could see him since he was sitting at the corner watching. Before they could know it, all of them were dead.

Clap! Clap! Cain jumped from his throne clapping, “Nicely done, you cleared them well.”

“They were mere wolves, anyone could kill them,” Kayden said as he sheathed his sword in the blink of an eye. As a swordsman, he was leagues ahead of Cain who mostly focused on enchanting and magic.

Cain was happy that he got to observe Kayden’s fight, he now felt that he could find a way to kill him safely. “By the way, what happened to Morena?” Cain asked while keeping his magic ready.

“Never seen her since the last time we met, I ran away with that accursed woman.” This sentence wasn’t something Cain expected to hear.

“What do you mean?”

“Since our last fight, I ran away with Meliliana and never reported back. We took the two puppies with us but she killed one of them, we fought and she ran away missing a leg!” Kayden growled in anger, his six eyes seemed to be about to pop out.

“That accursed bi*ch turned into a man and consumed one of the puppies so I tried to kill her. She used the other one as a shield and hit me with her illusion magic. I thought I cut her head while it was her leg.” Kayden’s demonic aura swelled quickly as his rage increased. It then quickly disappeared, “But one of the puppies survived, that’s all that matter right now!” He calmed in an instant.

‘I think I understood half of what he was talking about, let’s get back now since I have gotten any information about the Fenrir village from him yet.’ Cain thought as he opened a gate for them to exit the maze.

[Enchanting] Cain marked Kayden before they could leave the maze as a safety measure.
