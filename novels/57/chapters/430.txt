Cain walked out of his room thinking. Right now he is now ruling a whole city, in a position to stand with the king and have a solid voice.

‘Probably I should declare lordship publically and assist the king against the rebels’ His first brain thought. ‘Doing this will start a direct conflict with the nobles, I might be safe but I can’t guarantee the safety of those around me like Dolrig.’ The second brain made notice. All of Cain’s actions need to be calculated to avoid any lethal mistake.

“Master, can we have a word?” Sebas called Cain as soon as he saw him.

“What is it? Let’s talk it over tea.” The two of them walked toward the dinner table.

…

“Here, look at this.” Sebas handed a letter with the king’s seal on it.

Dear Cain Lisworth….

Cain started reading the long letter slowly, with each word he seemed to get more exhausted.

“What do you think? Should we comply?” Sebas said. In short, the letter was asking for Cain to assist in blocking an elvish attack in the sea while the king deals with the rebellion on his own.

Cain snorted, “This letter’s fake, where did you get it?”Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Fake? It was delivered by the marine, the king’s trusted force.” Sebas replied. He has received the letter in secret two days ago when he was going around with Mary to bring Cain’s sword.

“The elves will never attack us, even the dark elf won’t do it. The king is stubborn, he won’t ask for help before giving it a try himself. And most importantly, the marine will never deliver such a letter.” Cain stood.

“Where are you going?” Sebas asked.

“To the capital, I know one or two people who could help there.” Cain smiled.

“Then master, before you go, please take this with you.” Sebas walked toward a wooden box that was in the corner. From it, he pulled a sword.

The steel sword had a slight glimmer to it, magic seemed to flow in it flawlessly.

“What a beautiful sword, as if it’s alive.” Cain held it in his hand and it felt like a part of his body. That sword could act as a staff as well.

“Isn’t it? The sword’s handles seem to have turned out splendid. You and Lady Mary have chosen a great blacksmith for the job.” Sebas smiled.

“Well then, I will be going now.” Cain walked toward the portal leading to the royal castle.

…

After walking just a bit in the castle, Cain met Sara the eldest daughter who survived.

“Lord Cain?” She hurried toward him the moment her eyes laid on him.

“How are you doing? Any headache remaining?” Cain asked. She had her whole brain consumed and replaced by the tadpole. Right now she is keeping herself thanks to the aboleth being dead and the tadpole going into slumber.

“I’m fine, still can’t feel the difference, to be honest.” She smiled.

“Don’t think too hard about it. Just tell me if something seemed off.” Cain smiled.

“I will do, but what brought you here today?” She asked with a smile.

Cain walked toward her, “Have you seen Isbert? I can’t sense her in the castle and I wanted to have a word.”

“Sister Isbert should be going around the city exterminating monsters. She seemed to enjoy playing with her magic.” Sara said looking a bit worried.

“Is something off about her?” Cain asked.

“No, it’s just that she is…more willing to take risks…” Sara looked as if thinking, she couldn’t find the right words to describe Isbert’s behavior. “She started rushing to fight alone, swinging her blade without care and having a smile on her face. Even the way she swung her blade seemed different.

“I understand, I will take a look at her and tell you what I think.” Cain teleported to the sky to search a wider area for Isbert. He quickly sensed her a short walk from the walls.

[Teleport] Cain teleported close to her but not too close that she could notice him. He even used [Invisibility] and [Soundless]

He could see it, Isbert was walking alone in her full-plate armor, only her eyes were visible. On her back was a custom-made long sword that seemed to be a bit different than what is conventional. It wasn’t big or short, it just had a weird design in his eyes.

‘Let’s see how she fares in the fight’ Cain’s first brain thought. ‘Since we can’t apprise her from this distance.’

A group of bandits was waiting for her, “It’s the princess she really appeared!” One of them laughed.

“Told you our information was right, the client is a big shot after all.” Another said as they surrounded her.

“You idiots remember, don’t injure her. She is a fragile product after all.” A woman of them said pulling a rope.

Stopping in her place, Isbert pulled her sword and stared at them. “Have you seen any monsters nearby? I heard a big one was lurking around here.” Isbert asked as if she didn’t hear them.

“Your highness, don’t play dumb and throw your weapon away. I promise those goons won’t lay a finger on you.” The woman approached her with the rope in her hands.

“In those past days, I killed enough bandits that I know you aren’t worth much Exp. I’m not here to enforce the law so be gone.” Isbert said as she started walking again.

“She is wearing armor, I knock her to the ground so you tie her.” A massive bandit rushed toward Isbert.

The moment he touched her shoulder, he stopped moving. CRACK! A crack spread across his arms as white vapor emitted from Isbert.

The bandit’s body froze full in the blink of an eye, Isbert gently pushed him to the side with her hand so his corps fell and shattered. “You can’t touch me, not even monsters can.” Saying that she rushed toward the woman with a wide swing.

“Got you!” A bandit threw a rope at Isbert and managed to catch her, “Now get her down.” He yelled.

“I told you it’s useless.” The rope cracked, Isbert’s body was just too cold.

“Charge at her!” The bandit’s leader who was hiding in the back yelled, he could justify a scar or two. Nothing that healing magic couldn’t fix.

All the bandits rushed at her at the same time, “This is for Arnold!” The bandits yelled the name of their dead comrade.

“Born on ice, from the frigid lands of Cania. [Ice forest]!” AS Isbert screamed, tens of Ice spikes emerged from the ground piercing the majority of the bandits. All those whom she pierced froze into chunks of ice.

“Shoot!” The bandit leader pulled his crossbow and ordered the rest to shoot as well.

As tens of bolts and arrows flew toward her, Isbert lifted her left arm [Ice Shield] a tower shield made of ice appeared in her hand. She used it to rush throw the projectiles and head straight for the bandit leader.

“How the princess could be this strong, die bitch. We’ve been had this isn’t the princess.” He pulled his sword and rushed at her.

Clang their swords clashed, and he could feel an incredible weight behind her swing.

“Who are you?” He yelled.

Isbert didn’t bother replying and just knocked him to the ground with her shield.

“You bit…” Isbert stomped on his face, CRACK! His head froze immediately and shattered under her steel boot.

As if nothing happened, Isbert kept walking with a goal glimmering in her eyes.
