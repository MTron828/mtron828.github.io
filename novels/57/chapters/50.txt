Now that Cain was going at it the normal way, Sofia started to enjoy it.

Alice had a disappointed look on her face looking at them. She had finally thought Sofia was about break.

Suddenly, Cain stopped moving for a second. lifting Sofia’s other leg to give him a better grab force.

As Cain went deeper into her, Sofia twitched as she reached the top again.

Alice who was getting impatient watching has tried her, sticking her tail into Sofia’s mouth. To her surprise, Sofia started vigorously sucking it, giving Her waves of pleasure.

Cain opened her legs wide as he leaned toward her chest. And as if calling him in, Sofia hugged him.

twitching once again, she had started to feel the exhaustion.

Cain once again switched the position, dragging Sofia to the bedside and stepping on her face with his right foot. Without stopping his movements.

As if she was in a trance, Sofia started sucking on his toes. Alice was getting more and more frustrated at this situation.

Out of nowhere, Cain did a couple of overpowered thrusts at all his might, discharging for another time. Sofia twitched once more.

After her last high moment, Sofia had stopped feeling pleasure, having only the unpleasant experience of being drilled into.

Cain on the other hand showed no signs of stopping as flipped her around to a doggy style.

Alice could see the pain in Sofia’s face so she started teasing her, pinching on sticking her tail where it shouldn’t be.

All of her actions helped increase Sofia’s discomfort, pushing her to the edge of giving up.

After a few minutes, Sofia finally tapped out.

“Alice, Alice…move him away from me. Please!” She cried, asking for help as she wasn’t able to bear it anymore.

The wide smile on Alice’s face was priceless, approaching to move Cain away! She had won!

… Oh, She didn’t have enough strength to push him away! Cain seemed too focused on Sofia to notice Alice beside him.

“I can’t pull him away! He is stuck to your back!” Alice said, using all her power to try and drag Cain Away.

“Do something!” Sofia cried, it was starting to get more than uncomfortable!

[Curse magic] Alice tried to use her magic, hurting him might make him pull away! It was no use as he was too much into it!

The danger of high charisma started to appear more and more, it was like mind control, explaining why being like a succubus is far more dreaded by men than evil dragons!

Clank! The door burst open and a maid rushed in, armed with a pole in her hand, no it was a broom! Jumping on top of Cain, using it to grapple him from the neck.

The maid didn’t speak any word, her face was as expressionless as it could be, quickly shifting Cain’s weight toward The confused Alice.

Taking this chance Sofia covered herself in the blanket and rolled away.

The maid quickly closed the door and stood by it watching as Cain went ham on Alice.

“Thanks, what’s your name?” Sofia was less worried about being seen doing it and more relieved it got over.

“Gracie Gray.” She replied, not saying any other word.

“Why did you help us? Were you listening by the door?” Sofia was suspicious, Gracie being there was bad, Cain isn’t going to be amused by her seeing Alice’s devil form.

“It’s an awful experience!” These were the only words she said, continuing to watch.

“Since you already got in, you’re not allowed to leave until Cain snaps back!” Sofia said, quickly getting ready for a fight, Alice’s being a devil something that mustn’t leak.

“I know the punishment, I won’t run!” She replied. Somewhat Gracie Gray, the quietest of the maid managed to get herself in a pickle on the first day.

Alice got the same treatment as Sofia, starting with a deep kiss. Cain went directly into the action with her as he was already on. She started by feeling pleasure at first, went even to sticking her tail down his back end to agitate him more.

Just like Sofia, Cain was still going strong and Alice was the first to stop enjoying it.

“Cain it hurts! But don’t stop, I felt worse so just keep going!” Alice said hugging him even closer.

Sofia wasn’t going to let her suffer like that, quickly switching again! The two girls took turns sucking Cain’s stamina down, eventually taking him down.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He was too energetic, it didn’t seem like the stamina potion was needed.

After a few hours of sleep, Cain woke up to his jewels hurting, they were busted! beside him were both Alice and Sofia sleeping like they had a fun night.

“I hope you got closer, I don’t remember much since I fell under Sofia’s charm but judging by the pain, you endured well!” Cain said, ruffling their hair.

As he lifted his eyes, they opened wide in surprise. Gracie was standing at the door, staring at him with an empty look.

Why is she here? Alice was in her devil form, she must have seen her! Cain’s mind went into full power.

‘I have to ask them later.’ Cain though, signaling with his hands to Gracie.

“In front of the bed, on your knees!” He ordered and Gracie compiled without a word.

“What did you see?” He asked, trying to sound intimidating.

“Everything!” She replied with a single word, reminding Cain of how she was.

“I hope you become cooperative, answer all my questions even if they are uncomfortable for you!” Cain growled.

“Yes!” She still didn’t show any expression, just accepting everything.

“Why did come?” Cain asked, he wanted to know more about what happened.

“I didn’t want them to go through what I endured before!” She replied.

A lot of questions sprout in Cain’s head as he heard her. ‘What and how!’

“What happened in your past? The full story!” Cain asked, he wasn’t ready to hear no!

… She stayed silent, not uttering a word.

“Chose, speak on your own or after being enslaved! Speaking now might earn you a pass!” Cain that if she was willing to speak, he might let her go this time!

After a few minutes of silence, she finally started speaking.

“I like to be enslaved first!” she said, just as Sofia and Alice woke up.

Cain was now in a pickle, she was too silent he genuinely had the will to let her go with just a scolding! What is with her now wanting to be enslaved?

Cain didn’t have enough power to have a third slave, if he wanted to do he will need to enchant his soul even more. A thing that he can’t do without a good setup!

“Cain, do you need to do that? is it necessary?” Sofia asked, jumping from the bed covered in the blanket so she would start another round.

“Unless we want to end with Alice persecuted by the people, it’s necessary As long as she refuses to be cooperative!” Cain said, putting his hand on Gracie’s head.

“I will register it for you, I can’t take more than Alice!” Cain admitted that he Can’t take more slaves than he has now, keeping the other one a secret.

“Are you okay with this?” Sofia asked Gracie.

“Yes, It’s the only way I can speak!” She surprisingly said more words than before.

The pact was made quickly, Making Gracie a slave to Sofia.

As he was making the pact, Cain felt dreadful magic running in Gracie’s heart, a broken charm spell! Cain knew who used those spells and his first thought was ‘O hell no!’ Just the thought that one of those f***ers is close was enough to send a shiver down his spine.

“Answer all of Cain’s questions!” Sofia ordered Gracie.

“Did you meet a succubus?” Cain asked straightforwardly.

“No, It was an incubus!”

Cain had guessed it! Was it the Gracie is like this, it couldn’t be said for true.

“I know you might be uncomfortable with it but I want to hear the details, When and where!”

An incubus was a dangerous monster, demon? devil? Classifying them was surely hard.

Firstly, not like how other people, don’t have genders! The demon changes its gender depending on his target! If it was a woman he will appear as an incubus, if it was a male then it will appear as a succubus.

They live very long lives so the one who Gracie met should still be around!

Other than being extremely dangerous, another use for them was rarely known! The incubus/succubus blood can be used to create charm warding magic items, lust potions, and more!

He could use it, to make to lessen the effects of Sofia’s 17 charisma charm!

But before that, he needed to know more about the maid in front of him!
