Cain looked up to see Hati standing beside him. “I thought only maids were here?”

“Who said that? They are here as well.” She pointed toward the other side of the bath. Amaya, Scarlett, Lucy, Lia, and Olivia. Even Roberta was sitting with them.

“I’ve been played, is this all women except Cain’s wives gathering? I’m out!” He immediately tried to teleport outside but Hati grabbed him by the hand.

“Can’t run from me!”

‘My teleportation isn’t working, the shard is interfering with his magic?’ No, it was Skoll using the shard’s power to stop him.

Cain’s eyes glowed blue, he needs to get out. His wives are informed that he was with the maids, which didn’t include Hati and Roberta. Details were important is what Sylph told him one day.

“Help me!” Hati called and a cold hand grabbed Cain.

“It’s me!” Bela grabbed him in a tight embrace, she immediately pinned him to the ground.

Cain glared at her, where did she come from? He didn’t sense her at all.

“Come on maids, I’ve pinned him for you. You’ve been waiting for over a month right?” Bela called the maids.

Suddenly a foot emerged from Cain’s chest and Kicked Bela in the face. The kick had a surprising amount of power behind it.

“I believe we only allowed the maids?” It was none other than Alice. Her face was beet-red, “That doesn’t include you two!” She growled at Hati and Bela.

Bela was barely able to move in Alice’s holy demonic aura, the maids felt nothing but Bela’s body was screaming in pain. She only held her screams since she was undead.

“Bela…” Hati tried to rush to save her but was surprised by a knife at her throat. “Move and you’re dead.” Gracie wasn’t playing around..

“All of you, Stop!” Hearing Cain’s sharp words, everything halted.

“Don’t fight like this?” Cain walked slowly toward them, “Are alright?” Alice asked him.

“Do you really think they could hold me down?” Cain replied. He was right, even if both Hati and Bela ganged on him, he could have pinned them to the ground with [Anti-magic field] and [Dominate person] or [Dominate monster]

“The one who was playing all of this…” Cain stared toward the maids with a piercing gaze. “You!” his eyes landed on Klara.

“You were in the bath and are the one who talked with them about this, why didn’t you mention Hati and Bela’s existence to them?”

“Well…I forgot.” Klara smiled.

After a second and before Cain could say anything, Alice spoke. “It’s stepmother’s idea right?” Alice looked at her with a sharp glare.

“Who knows? She might have asked me to test if Cain would cheat on you, and she may not. The results are favorable anyway.” She looked down at the limp Cain.

Alice sighed, “And I was thinking where you went this morning, fine let me handle this from now on.”

“Cain please let me handle this, I should be able to make sure nothing like this happens ever again,” Alice asked and Cain nodded.

“Is it really Lisa or it’s just your father’s bullshit?” Cain looked at Alice.

“Father isn’t smart enough to do something like this, it should be her idea at least,” Alice replied.

“What now?” Gracie asked.

“Leave them be, we hate if it was done behind our backs. Now that we know it’s fine, right?” Alice said with a smile.

Gracie nodded and let Hati free.

“Would mind releasing me as well?” Bela asked.

Alice stared at her with dead eyes, “Weren’t you married?”

“He’s dead.”

“You’re dangerous to be around Cain if that’s your answer, take her away,” Alice growled.

“G-get back!” Amaya lifted her hand and Bela was forcefully teleported back to the maze. The maids looked at her with shocked eyes. Cain gave her control of all of the undead he made, which includes Bela the lich witch.

“That was me, it’s the same as the spells I gave you,” Cain told the maids. They were told before that Bela was a summoned creature just like Mei.

As the tension fell apart, Gracie looked at Cain down there. “Are you alright?” She asked with a hint of worry.

“Don’t worry, I can control it at will.” Cain instantly rose up as he said that, he then got limp again. He increased his output before but now he could even control how and when to go.

“Before we go back, one last word of warning. Anyone who tries to force herself on him, we will kill her.” Alice said with a smile that seemed terrifying.

With those words of warning, Alice and Gracie returned to the other three. Cain was left alone in the bath with what remained.

The maids immediately started talking with Klara about why she did that, “It was Lisa’s orders, I expected Lady Alice to catch earlier when I talked with her but I think she missed the hints.”

“That’s right, I won’t question you if Alice didn’t. Well, deal with Lisa later, for now, let’s just relax.” Cain replied as he sat in the hot water beside Lexi.

Klara looked at Cain with a guilty face before approaching him to whisper in his ear. “Lisa and William looked to your father’s past. This was them checking to see if you two were the same or not.”

Cain sighed, he then whispered back to her, “I might slap them both when we meet next time, and this is going too far.” Cain was serious.

“Be careful then, I always get this bewildering feeling around her when I’m reporting.”

…

Everything finally calmed down. And Cain relaxed, his eyes kept shifting between the maids, each one of them was unique.

‘I should probably do something with at least two of them tonight, probably three. Alice said that there will be two maids with Marina.’

Cain looked around trying to choose, Lexi was a must-go as she was the one spent the most time with. The other two were a hard choice.

At one point he wanted to take Amaya but she didn’t look that fond of doing it. She was keeping her distance from him.

“What are you thinking about?” Klara who was beside him asked.

“I wanted to take three of you to bed tonight, I was trying to choose.” There was no point hiding it, the maids were like his concubines now that his wives approved of them.

“ME!” Katherine rushed at him. “No me!” Amara pushed her away. Those were the most eager to do it, Cain didn’t know their reasons which caused him to hesitate.

“Olivia, would you mind joining?” Cain asked the other one beside Lexi who had more contact.

“Sorry, I have work scheduled tonight. Probably next time if you don’t mind.” She looked sorry.

“Don’t worry about it, just don’t overwork yourself,” Cain replied.

Cain looked around, his eyes fell on Ellie. ‘Alice said that she hates men and like women, probably it’s better to leave her alone for now.’ Cain thought as she looked at her. It was a bit weird of her to cover her neck and chest but leave her lower side exposed. ‘To each his own, she will open up with time.’

“Diana, would mind standing up?” Cain asked and Diana stood immediately. After staring at her for a few seconds Cain asked, “How about you?” If he was to choose based on look it has to be her, what she had behind was something spectacular.

“I-it will be my pleasure.” Diana bowed down. This was the second one.

The last one was a hard choice between Elise, Klara, and Jemima. Katherine and Amara were out since they are a bit sus.

“Jemima, Elise, Klara. Choose one of you to be the last one to join me tonight. It’s completely fine if none of you want to join.” Cain said leaving the choice to them.

The three looked at each other as if wanting help. “I’m dropping this time, I do need to water my plants.” Jemima pulled out immediately.

“I don’t think it’s acceptable of me to take such privilege after what I have done. Sorry, but I will wait until the ladies aren’t angry at me anymore. Unless you want me.” Klara said smiling.

“It will be my pleasure then.” Elise took her chance, she didn’t this chaotic bath after what happened in her room.

“So tonight is Lexi, Diana, and Elise,” Cain said.

Lexi’s neck quickly turned as she looked at him, when did her name get even mentioned?

“Hold up me?” Lexi said with a surprised face.

“You were waiting from last time unless you don’t want to do it.” Cain looked at her. She shook her head, “No, I want to do it.” She wasn’t going to miss this chance.

Cain relaxed. With the girls he chose sitting around him, he was most excited for Diana.

“I will have to get out, I’m sure lady Alice is waiting for me.” Klara stood. “Have a fun night.” And she walked out of the bath.

“Where are we going to do it?” Lexi asked. His room was occupied by the girls.

Cain had a simple solution, “We do it in my other house. It has plenty of rooms.”

He then stood up, “Better go since it’s getting pretty late, just grab your clothes from the changing room. I will create a portal there.” Cain said with a smile.

This might have seemed simple, but it was a big step for the maids. Those who managed to get in a relationship with him are considered to be his concubines for the time being.

This for one gives them the title of nobility as well as their families. Those maids can use his family name, or their family name at will.

With Cain ruling over Ourals and being on equal ground with the king since the latter left him to have the city out of fear of his power. After this night, Lexi, Diana, and Elise will have a similar political weight to the king’s concubines.

With time, they could raise in rank if they managed to get Cain to marry them, which will turn them into official wives, which will in turn sit them on equal ground with the queens.

Cain can realize that Katherine and Amara are after that power. He didn’t choose them since he wanted to confirm their intention beforehand.

After the four of them passed through the portal Cain set in the changing room, they found themselves in [Lisworth’s Magnificent Mansion]

Cain stretched his arms, they have this whole place to play with.

“I will be heading toward the bedroom, feel free to explore the place before if you wish,” Cain said as he walked downstairs.

Lexi, Elise, and Diana looked at each other, they were still naked and carrying their clothes in their hands.

“Please wait for us!” They rushed after him immediately.
