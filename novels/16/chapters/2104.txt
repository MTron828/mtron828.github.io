The distance between the territory of the Suiard family and that of the Omann's wasn't small. It was easily thousands of kilometers. In addition to this, Leonel hadn't expected to need to take action himself as he felt that the measures he had handed to James and the others were more than enough.

While he was fighting against Amery, he had sent Xavnik's army to "attack" the Spirituals Religion. Due to this, Syriah had believed that she was being attacked by a joint force of Leonel, Xavnik, and the Pyius family on top of that. Due to this, she didn't even have the presence of mind to consider the fact that Amery might also be in trouble.

On top of that, because Amery saw that Leonel was the only threat before him, he hadn't cared to report this matter to Syriah either. Like this, the two supposed allies were separated like this.

Because Xavnik never showed up personally, Syriah kept waiting for the other foot to drop, not knowing that the black-green armored army was nothing more than a fa√É¬ßade to keep her pinned down.

While all of this was happening, Leonel had sent the others to deal with the Omann family. In his opinion, the Skies family and Oryx with the help of the Cloud Race was an undefeatable force.

It had to be remembered just how powerful Maia was. It wasn't an exaggeration to say that she was the most powerful existence in these Heir Wars. Maybe only if Leonel broke through to the Seventh Dimension and then teamed up with Aina could they defeat Maia with any sort of confidence.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

This wasn't because Maia was so talented, but rather because she had used the special ability of the Cloud Race, exchanging her "stored up" years for immediate strength and power. As a result, while she had only experienced about 20 or so years of life, she had the strength of an absolute genius of the Cloud Race that had practiced hard for decades longer than that.

If Leonel had been willing to put her out in front, he might have won this war on day one before anyone could do a thing to stop him. The reason he hadn't was that, as he had said, this wasn't his end goal. As he saw it, the Heir Wars were only the beginning, and its purpose wasn't just for him to win either.

The Heir Wars was the stage for him to show off his abilities, for the Human Domain to become aware of who Leonel Morales was and the kind of strength he held. That way, when he conquered them in the future, they would have a deep-seated respect for him in their hearts already. He couldn't do that if he just let Maia run amok from the very beginning.

In addition to this, Maia was a trump card he didn't want to reveal too soon. He wouldn't have even traded for her in the first place and brought her into the Heir Wars if it wasn't for the sake of wanting to make sure the Cloud Race stayed in line and followed his orders.

The talent of the Cloud Race when it came to controlling the mind and related matters was too high. Leonel wanted a fool-proof plan to control them, so placing seeds into their minds wasn't enough. He thus took control of Maia's sons and then used Maia's prestige to keep the others in line.

This was all to say that with Maia present, it should have been impossible for the Omann family to turn the tides.

According to Leonel's orders, Maia should have only acted if it was strictly necessary. But, should things go left, he gave her permission to display her true strength. This was why he had been so confident. But what he hadn't expected was for the Omann family to be so shameless, though he should have.

Rather than calling these the Heir Wars, it was more like a battle between Leonel and the most powerful families of the Human Domain. It was absolutely ridiculous.

The Heir Wars were meant to test the connections of the younger generation and their abilities; it wasn't a place for powerful families to flaunt their resources. Everyone already knew that they were powerful, but they didn't seem to care about this.

Leonel had caught a glimpse of this shamelessness with the Lio family. He knew for a fact that Conon and Gunter hadn't raised those beasts themselves, but they still brought them forward as though they had.

And now, the Omann family had placed their full effort behind Kron Omann, the supposed best Force Crafter of the younger generation.

This time, it wasn't just a small hoard of beasts at the end of their lives. The Omann family had provided the "Heirs" of the Omann family with all the resources they needed to build a Tier 2 Star Ship!

It had to be remembered that when Leonel stole a Tier 2 Star Ship from Shield Cross Stars, Cross Elder Avan had been enraged to the point of throwing a tantrum. That kind of wealth was astronomical, it was enough for even an organization of that size to feel the pinch. They even sent an Eighth Dimensional Ancestor after Leonel to try and get it back.

Leonel had used a Tier 2 Star Ship to destroy not just one but four of the Great Families, each of which had had several experts that could have fought the likes of Maia. The strength of such a vessel shouldn't have appeared in the Heir Wars, and the rules had made it so as well.

Everyone knew that Leonel had stolen a Tier 2 Star Ship from Shield Cross Stars, so there was a limit on the kind of vessels and war weapons that could be traded for. If Leonel could just hand over 10,000 points and activate his flagship, the war would have been over.

The Morales had agreed to these stipulations. In years past, they hadn't needed such a rule because no one in the younger generation had the resources to build such a vessel, but they felt that it was a good rule to add as well since it would no longer be just the Morales participating now.

But obviously, the Omann family had taken advantage of a loophole themselves.

Rather than trading for such a vessel, they built it from the ground up!

The more Leonel thought about it, the colder his expression became. He activated his Starry Light Domain, and his body began to leap through hundreds of kilometers at a time, flickering and vanishing with a speed that put the wind to shame.

Only several minutes later, he saw the battle over the distance.

The ocean seemed to have been extended by several kilometers, large swaths of flooding waters filling the once grassy plains. Bodies, or rather what remained of them, floated in the water.

The large Rain Beasts collapsed one after another. Every time they did, a large flood of water would be expelled, drowning out the formations of Leonel's army that were stuck on the ground.

Up in the sky, a looming flagship floated. It was much smaller than Leonel's flagship, which could match a moon in size and couldn't possibly fit on a small planet like this one, but Leonel was certain that Aina wouldn't make such a stupid mistake. Somehow, despite its much smaller size, this was no weaker than a Tier 2 Star Ship. In fact, it was even better than one.

It was faster, more agile, and had more concentrated strength. Not only could it destroy a planet, but it could fight a relatively smaller scale battle like this one without destroying everything around it.

Laying eyes on it, Leonel was even more infuriated. That was because this wasn't just an example of the Omann family spitting in the face of the core of what the Heir Wars was meant to be by providing juniors with so many resources, but Leonel was also certain that there was no one in the younger generation with the skill to blueprint such a monstrous flagship.

There was no doubt. This was a self-created product by none other than the Scorned Queen Beauty, and the Omann family was actually shameless enough to use it in the Heir Wars.

The more enraged Leonel was, the calmer his gaze seemed to become. The smoldering crimson of his eyes flickered in and out as he continued to move.

BANG!A light that split the skies shot out from a cannon on the flagship.

Leonel's expression changed as he rushed over. This light wasn't aimed toward him at all.

Aina's roar filled the skies as her manifestation appeared once again, this time easily tens of times more powerful than what she had used against Xavnik.

She swung her ax down with a mighty force, resisting against the blast.

To the astonishment of those watching, she actually managed to hold it back for a brief moment. But not even a split moment later, she and her manifestation were enveloped.

Aina catapulted backward, her body flying like a broken arrow. She couldn't seem to gather up her power again as the laser blasted by her obstruction, swiftly catching up to her body and seeking to destroy her entirely.

Standing on the bow of the flagship, Kron stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his arrogance towering.

These Heir Wars were over.

Sword Deity? Bow Deity? The Morales? The Suiard? The Spiritual Religion?All of them were worthless in the face of the greatest crafting family of the Human Domain.
