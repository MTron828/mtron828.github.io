Leonel's spear flew like a jet stream, leaving blurs in the air as he pierced through head after head. His lethality only increased, and yet his speed seemed to only become slower. 

It wasn't a surprise that Leonel had only taken ten pierces to reach the level of the primitive woman. After all, his Ability Index was perfect for this and this was ultimately just a Black Grade weapon. But, he still basked in the feeling. 

He could sense it, there was a level beyond. There was a level that represented why this woman's spear would be in the Spear Domain. This wasn't enough to gain the acknowledgment of the spear, there was something he was still missing. 

Three Sparrows shot toward Leonel, each of them just four feet tall. But, because they were all flying low to the ground, their heights were no less than that of Leonel. 

Two wielded short swords and the last was an archer who lagged behind. These three were most definitely more powerful than the ones Leonel had been fighting until this point, each of them in the latter third of the Fifth Dimension, beyond even Leonel's Tier 6 level. 

However, Leonel didn't flinch, his pale violet irises twinkling with a hidden light as the Auspicious Air around him thickened. 

His spear shot outward, releasing six streaks in quick succession. The wooden polearm bent and wove through the air like an elegant thread, matching the trajectory Leonel could see being projected onto the real world in real time. 

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

The two swordsmen defended for their lives, their wings flapping hard as they were pushed back. 

An arrow flew between their head, aiming for Leonel's head before he could follow up. But, with just as much ease, Leonel tilted to the side, his spear tilting upward from a low trajectory, piercing toward the chin of one of the Sparrows. 

Leonel's eyes suddenly widened, his blood rushing through his veins. 

That was it, that felt so good. 

He was washed with a feeling of euphoria even before his stinger blade shot through the lower jaw of the Sparrow, exiting out the back of his skull. 

It was almost like Leonel had felt the success before it landed, like it was a perfect move the skies had blessed him with. It was a sort of emotion Leonel had never experienced before and it left him on cloud nine. 

He pulled his spear back, his attacks suddenly becoming less predictable and more erratic. His rhythm shifted and moved like an elegant dance to music that jumped and warped. Sometimes it was fierce, at other times calm, and at yet other times it was ignited with a fiery passion that almost made Leonel loins burn with the same heat. 

He could remember the seduction of the primitive woman, how scantily clad she was, how much grace and beauty she carried through with her every movement. 

Her pores oozed with charm, her steps fusing with her moving and leaving her enemies in a trance. 

It was suddenly so obvious to Leonel. How was it that the primitive woman could make a spear that could do nothing but pierce so powerful?

It sounded quite ridiculous. Without any sort of variation, how could it be difficult to contend with her? 

But now, it was before Leonel as bright as day. There were many ways to vary one's attacks without using a different attack at all. You could change your cadence, your rhythm, you could even shift how much power you used, pushing and pulling at the instincts of an enemy until you lured them to a cliff and blew them a soft kiss as they fell off. 

Leonel's expression turned weird, breaking out of his trance. 

He shot a hand away from his spear, snatching at the air and grabbing an arrow out of the wind before it could pierce his brows. 

He laughed to himself, his laugh becoming louder and louder until the castle itself began to rock as the Earth Force that made up its foundation threatened to quake to the point the entire structure would come crumbling down. 

Leonel had immersed himself in the thoughts of the primitive woman to the point that he truly almost blew out a kiss mid battle. 

Suddenly, Aina let out a whistle to his back. 

"Why did you stop, I was enjoying the show!"

Leonel looked back to find Aina's face red from laughter as severed corpses fell around her. She was wheezing to the point Leonel thought snot might fly from her nose at any moment now, yet she still somehow managed to remain gorgeous. 

"Show me more of what those swaying hips can do!"

Leonel's lip twitched. It seemed that he had immersed himself more than he thought. But soon, a sly grin spread across his face. 

"If you want to see what my hips can do, you only needed to ask."

"Sure, sure." Aina laughed. "Do you want me to be top or bottom?"UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"Funny. We'll see if you're still laughing in the end or if you'll be looking at me with those puppy dog eyes again."

Aina coughed through her laughter before jumping over the side of the castle wall. 

"You'll never get to see either of them if you can't keep up!" She shouted out as she fell. 

Leonel flicked his wrist, sending the arrow he had caught through the brows of the Pixie that had shot it at him before rushing after Aina. 

A smile was plastered all over his face, this was far more fun than he had had in a while. 

Since Aina had already seen him in such an embarrassing state, he might as well also show her the flexibility technique he learned from Valiant Heart Mountain. Even though he hadn't used it in a while, he thought it would be a useful way to get that smug smile on her face to turn into a lustful scream. 

Leonel's body flashed, a streak of gold being left in his wake, his spear's light severing everything in its path.
