1829 Casual Breakthrough Leonel felt very lucky that he had invested so heavily into his vitality. If not for this, there was a chance that he really might not be able to keep up with Aina at all. Luckily, he went from potentially suffering loss after loss, to being quite undefeatable. Though, considering Aina's own talents, her recovery was off the charts and almost any little thing he did seemed to "trigger" her.

As far as Leonel was concerned, though, these were good problems to have. If there was anyone in his life that he wanted to please, this future wife of his was near the top of a very, very short list.

About a day or so later, Leonel sat in a state of meditation.

It was very easy to become complacent without the pressure of the Void Palace constantly barraging him from all sides. If there were any problems with the fact he had been booted prematurely, it was this.

He understood his own personality quite well, there was a subtle sort of lazy undertone to everything he did that came from a place of complacency, a place that made it feel like he was constantly looking down on the whole world.

But Leonel also knew better than anyone else that he hadn't earned such a complacency yet. Unless he actively suppressed it, he could spend weeks or even months at a time rolling around in bed with Aina without even the slightest worry in the world.

Luckily, he had become hyper aware of this flaw of his for multiple reasons.

First, there was Aina by his side. No matter what, she didn't have such complacency. Although she hadn't said anything after learning about Leonel's destruction of the Brazinger family, Leonel knew quite well that this was because they had entered a sort of second honeymoon period of their relationship.ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

Aina probably still felt like what they had was fragile and she wanted to protect it, so rather than complaining about something she likely had a great right to complain about, she suppressed those feelings and directly ignored them.

However, it was clear by how much harder she was working everyday that it bothered her.

Leonel wasn't clueless. In fact, he was hyper aware of everything around him, and this hyper awareness only became sharper after he unbound his soul and unleashed his true King's Might Lineage Factor. He understood the ins and outs of Aina's thoughts, maybe more than even she herself did.

Back then, while it was true that Aina had been fatigued from helping him bring his body back to 100%, her hatred of the Brazinger family was deep enough that this wouldn't have mattered to her. Logic and emotion were two different things, but one wasn't necessarily more important than the other to most people not named Leonel Morales.

The second reason was because of his King's Might and the evolution of his Dream Force which had allowed him to enter Tier 3.

Leonel's increase to his Dream Force allowed him to be hyper aware of his own thoughts and the process by which they formed. He had a deeper understanding of why he was the way he was and what reasons there might be at the root of it all.

Ultimately, he knew that if he didn't force himself to work, or external pressure didn't force him, he could easily become complacent.

So rather than allowing himself to dictate things, he set a Dream Counter ability to trigger instead.

And now, thanks to that, he was currently in blissful meditation. His mind compared and contrasted the improvements he had made in Dream Force versus the lack of improvement in everything else. He then referenced this with the shifts to his Emulation Spatial Force and slowly noted down several comprehensions.

Thaela had made a great deal of improvement back when she was still in possession of this Innate Node. As such, there were many runes already formed.

The formation of her runes were actually much weaker than the formation Leonel had made on his two Scarlet Star Force Innate Nodes. However, Leonel didn't feel like he could take much credit for this at all considering the circumstances that had led to things being this way in the first place.

But what he did realize was that there were subtle shifts in her Innate Node that weren't in his own. Some parts of the rune were far thicker and denser than other parts that looked to be drawn lighter and more illusory. These seemed to represent parts that she was more familiar with versus parts she had less comprehension about.

This was intriguing to Leonel because he had never formed this way. Even for his Dream Force or his Vital Star Force, they either formed, or didn't, there was no inbetween like this.

The question was if the reason was due to his approach, or if it was just a matter of mindset. Leonel did seem like the type of person to not be satisfied with moving on unless he comprehended something entirely, only then would he use it. This was how things had always been with his weapon Forces.

This time, however, Leonel didn't feel like he was to blame. There was something deeper going on here.

'If I'm correct it's a matter of whether this world can sustain it or not. I have a feeling that if I was in an Eighth Dimensional world, forming partial runes like this would be very much possible. In lesser worlds, though, without a perfect comprehension, runes can't form at all.ÔøΩÔøΩ

Essentially, the reason why Thaela could form partial runes and increase her Force Manipulation in this way was because her environment could help her to do so.

'That hypothesis should have about a 97.2% chance of being correct, give or take."

Leonel calmly nodded and moved on in his deductions, seemingly not realizing just how groundbreaking this discovery was.

If one had an all or nothing approach to Force Manipulation, moving forward would be impossible with sudden enlightenment, like what Leonel had experienced a few weeks ago, or without a reference, like the complete Innate Node in Leonel's kidney.

This would be an inherent weakness of "imperfect" worlds, or in other words... Worlds beneath the Ninth Dimension.

What was even more groundbreaking, though, was the fact that Leonel felt that he could create a work around based on this. And if he was correct, Force Manipulation improvement would come as natural to his people as it did for the geniuses of that Zone.
