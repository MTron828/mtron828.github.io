Leonel stood somewhat weakly before the upside Richard; The latter was still frothing at the mouth and obediently answering Leonel's questions; but it was unfortunate that this fool had no useful information; It was more likely that one of the foot soldiers that had come with him would know more about the inner workings of the Chaotic Water Sector than this supposed prince would; 

After a while, Leonel shook his head and directly killed him, turning him to ashes; He didn't have the patience to keep this person around, and he also felt that it was unfair if this incompetent prince got to survive after so many of his subjects died due to this very incompetence; 

"Are you finally done? Come and eat, then; You look like death," Aina said; 

Leonel wanted to resist after Aina grabbed his hand, but he found himself too weak to do anything; The world spun and he ended up on her back, speechless; 

"Can't you carry me in a more comfortable position? I'm finding it hard to believe that you're actually worried about me."

Leonel dangled like a sack of potatoes; nursing grievances; 

"Oh? You know about comfortable positions too?" Aina replied with a more sinister edge to her voice; 

"Hehe…" Leonel laughed and then coughed; "What did you want me to do? You were gripping the sheets so hard that I couldn't move you even if I wanted to;"

"What did you say? Why don't you speak a little louder?"

Leonel coughed; feeling Aina's shoulder digging into his gut; "What was that? The wind just now was really loud;"

"Hmph."

Aina's face flushed red; She knew that her display was really embarrassing back then, but she couldn't help it; Men had bodies that gave them a break once they hit one climax, but women's bodies didn't work exactly the same; Her body in particular had a really high rate of recovery even in comparison to other women and Leonel knew how to use his Dream World to take advantage of her; 

She couldn't even remember what happened after a certain point, her mind had been entirely fried; The novel stimulation was too much; 

Just thinking about it; Aina's face only became redder before she grit her teeth; If it wasn't for the current state of Leonel's body; she would definitely get her revenge immediately; As for any soreness; her body had recovered a long time ago; 

Leonel finally couldn't hold it in and burst into a fit of laughter; he laughed so hard he could feel what remained of the fragile fibers of his muscles shredding into pieces; but even so; he couldn't stop; 

… 

Aina plopped Leonel down on a dining room chair and gave him a glare before scurrying off into the kitchen; Even now, this man refused to stop laughing; He was very lucky that he was so injured right; 

After a while; Leonel finally managed to stop wheezing; 

At the moment, the two of them had entered the Segmented Cube. 

With its current level; the Segmented Cube was still separated into Lab Setting and Abode Setting; However; the change was that the latter was now separated into an Estate Setting and a World Setting; The former carried the typical home; rooms and board that Leonel and Aina were used to; while the latter was as its name denoted; feeling a lot more like a small planet; 

The World Setting was primed to grow a large amount of resources. it only needed Leonel's guidance. Although Leonel hadn't experienced it. the Segmented Cube had experienced a very long period of time and. as such. had a ton of accumulated energy ready to be released. 

　　　

　　

　　　　　　

　　

　 　

As for the Estate Setting. it was probably more luxurious than any home Leonel had ever seen. This was just one of the many kitchens. but it felt as high tech as the flagship that was waiting on them outside. 

Leonel smiled lightly as watched Aina bring out a large amount of ingredients. It was only ten minutes in before he began to smell an intoxicating fragrance. 

"Yip! Yip!"

With a flash, Little Blackstar appeared in a swirling ball of darkness, landing on a chair by Leonel and hanging out his little pink tongue. 

It had been too long since the little guy tasted Aina's cooking, so the moment he smelt something, he came immediately, unwilling to waste even a single moment. 

Leonel laughed and rubbed the little mink's head before his head suddenly turned in a certain direction. 

"What are you two hiding for? You might as well come. I don't mind sharing a bit of my wife's cooking with you all."

Leonel's words had hardly come out when a ladle streaked over like an arrow and rebounded against his head. 

Vice and Candle, who had been peeking in from the outside, were stunned for a moment before looking toward one another. Candle covered her mouth, stifling a hint of a laugh. As for Vice, his face was just as much of a brick wall as it was always, but Leonel could see the twitch in his lip. 

Leonel rubbed forehead with one hand before beckoning with the other. His attempt to remain dignified and kingly completely fell through with the growing lump on his forehead.  Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

"Don't mind her, her temper is fiery, but her cooking is excellent."

Leonel ducked after finishing these words, just barely making it out of the way of another flying spoon. 

With a grin he pushed out two chairs for Vice and Candle even as Aina came out with the first dish. 

"I don't see a wedding ring, who's your wife?" Aina asked with a glare before putting down the food before Vice and Candle as though Leonel didn't exist. 

"Yip! Yip!"

"Yes, yes, Blackstar, I have some good food for you too," Aina smiled. 

"I just have to find your old man first," Leonel beamed. 

Hearing this, AIna looked away from Blackstar and gave Leonel a weird look. Last time he and her "old man" had met, Leonel cracked more than just a couple ribs. 

"What's with that look? His love language is just his fists, it'll be fine."

Aina sputtered with laughter beside herself.
