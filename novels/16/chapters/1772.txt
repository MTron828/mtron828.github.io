Not long later; Leonel left with his brothers; leaving a few words for the Etching Metal organization; He saw no reason not to trust Raylion and the others; While he placed his Emperor's Mark on Jemsy and the other three heads; there was no way he would do the same to the four founding heads; 

"It seems we didn't waste our time," Aphestus said after a long while; He had a wild grin on his face; 

He remembered the first time he met Leonel he could have beaten him any time he wanted; But just months later, he was already incapable of lasting a few blows, and now, decades later, to say that Leonel could defeat him with a single strike wasn't giving Leonel enough credit; 

Raylion didn't say anything to this. but he felt Sael's small hand slip into his own; 

While Raylion didn't show any sort of emotion. Sael understood him the best. There was no one here who wanted this result more than Raylion himself. 

Even as they all surpassed Raylion one after another, Sael knew that Raylion had never given up on becoming a powerful expert; Unfortunately, his talent was just lacking in comparison to the others; He had gone from the head disciple of Valiant Heart Mountain to ultimately being an administrative leader of the organization; 

Raylion knew that if he wanted to achieve his dreams; Leonel was his only hope; But his pride was far too deep; He refused to hold his hands out; hoping that Leonel would just do him a favor; 

He had no relationship with Leonel; and they had even once been enemies; And even if they had been friends; Raylion would never feel comfortable asking for something when he could give nothing in return; 

During these over 20 years he had put his blood; sweat and tears into this organization; doing everything he could so that he could look Leonel in the eyes and exchange not for his charity; but for what he deserved; He had spent every waking moment thinking and dreaming on this day; 

His effort would finally pay off. 

Raylion squeezed Sael's hand lightly and his gaze turned toward Tiny; 

"Tiny," he said lightly. 

Tiny; whose expression was ugly after being essentially branded like cattle by Leonel; suddenly snapped awake; When he met Raylion's gaze; for some reason; he felt his heart skip a beat; He had always subconsciously feared this man; but he never truly understood why; 

"What did they promise you. Tiny?"

Tiny froze before quickly recovering; "What are you talking about, Raylion?"

"The four families, what did they promise you?" Raylion replied just as calmly, his eyes even being half closed; 

Hearing this; Tiny turned entirely pale; He wanted to refuse it; but when he remembered the Emperor's Mark hovering in his Ethereal Glabella; he knew that there was no longer any point; Raylion must have been sitting on this information for a long time waiting for the perfect opportunity; but since Leonel had appeared; he didn't have to be subtle and sly with everything anymore; This was the difference between scheming and true strength; 

Tiny could do nothing in the face of Leonel's overwhelming means; 

Tiny grit his teeth. "I will give you all the information and benefits I received."

"Good," Raylion replied lightly. "You have three days. I assume with this that we will see a 150% boost in revenue and the effectiveness of our network. Since we won't be shooting ourselves in the foot anymore, I expect us to be in peak form within the week in time for Leonel's return."

Raylion stood to his feet, holding onto Sael's hand. 

"Our goal is beyond this. Very soon we will be on the world stage. As the founder of the Etching Metal Organization, I officially announce that our first growth phase has come to an end. Our goal of becoming the best information network of the Human Domain has been successful. Our next goal is as follows… 

"To make Leonel Morales the official Heir of the Morales family."

**

The teleportation formation flashed and a group of nine appeared. 

Leonel looked around and sighed. 

"What's wrong, cap?" Drake asked. 

Leonel rubbed his forehead. "I didn't have time to make us any cool uniforms."

Leonel's eight brothers looked toward one another speechlessly for a moment before bursting into a fit of laughter. 

Raj wrapped his arm around Leonel's shoulder and trudged forward with big strides. 

"Cap, if you can make me a uniform that makes the ladies realize that this is the true peak masculine form, I'll get Milan to give you a foot rub."

Raj's big belly rolled with his laughter. As far as he was concerned, clothing designers were the real people screwing him over. 

The group walked out laughing, seemingly not realizing that they had a tall task ahead of them. 

They appeared on a barren moon to stare down at a planet, or at the very least, it was what should have been a planet, but was instead a temple the size of one. This place was none other than the headquarters of the Zoltene Faith. 

According to reports, this faith had recently been making an aggressive push in Earth's territory, forcefully seizing offerings and spreading their shrines even in areas where there was no consent on the part of the inhabitants. 

Leonel could see the various clergymen of the Zoltene Faith walking around. They all wore robes that flickered with holographic images that changed depending on the angle you saw them at. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the flickering colors, although there was probably some mysterious ranking system associated with it. 

Still, the most prominent part were the large glass orbs they wore like head ornaments. It seemed to be blown with different colored pieces of glass, flickering with a rainbow-like assortment of colors. More than their odd robes, this was the true marker of a worshipper of the Zoltene God. 

"Let's go," Leonel said after observing for a while. 

With a leap, he shot forward on his black surfboard, streaking through the skies with his brothers to his back with their own flying treasures. 

"Halt!"

"This is the territory of the Glorious Zoltene, halt!"

"Stop!"

The nine brothers didn't seem to hear any of this in the slightest as they directly barged in, their speed even faster than usual.
