Motes of light quickly revolved around Leonel, their speed increasing with every passing instant. He seemed to have already lost himself in the movements, completely uncaring of the kind of stamina he was blowing through every moment. 

There had probably been very few in the history of the Void Palace who had completely assimilated all of the knowledge that was here, and probably none who would do so in a mere two visits like Leonel, and the difficulty easily spoke to that. 

However, even so, the experience was incredibly rewarding. 

After Leonel had assimilated all of the Fourth Dimensional information in the Void Library, he had finally gone from an ignorant boy to someone who could be considered to have trul firmly stepped into the Dimensional Verse. Although there were still some simple matters that he didn't quite grasp, they were so insignificant that they didn't mean much on a large scale. 

Now, however, Leonel was quickly not only becoming well informed, but he was even becoming more informed than most. It was like the difference between an individual finishing grade school and someone who had worked their way up to a doctorate, but the main distinction here was that rather than having this doctorate in just one field, Leone was quickly gaining them in everything. 

Studies and research papers on Spatial Force were just the tip of the iceberg. In fact, it could be said that they were among the rarest research conducted purely because of how rare Spatial Force was. There were more research papers on niche Elemental Forces than there was for Spatial Force on the whole. 

When entire elemental chains were taken into consideration, the difference was even more jarring, but the findings were equally as fascinating although it was impossible that they would all be as useful as the Lotus research paper Leonel had read before that allowed him to form his Lotus Domain. However, there were still quite a few that were interesting. 

For example, when it came to Fire Force, there were quite a few papers on chain reactions and using them to make your Fire Force not only more powerful and sustained, but also more erratic and unpredictable. 

There were numerous applications just for this one path of study, everything from long ranged attacks to sudden burst movements to even increasing the power of a strike in random intervals to catch an enemy off guard. 

But that was just Fire Force and it was just a single potential path of growth. 

On the other side, there was Water Force. One of its interesting paths was actually very much related to resonance and its usage. 

There was a research paper that focused on using Water Force like a wine glass and any attack like a sound wave. Once this was achieved, you could either choose to continue to trap the attack, then truly go the full extent and allow your Water Force to "shatter", repelling the strength and even using it against an enemy. 

The number of paths was too numerous to count, and the number of research papers was even greater. 

It made a reality set in for Leonel. Weren't all these things just different forms of Force Manipulation? Then what was truly the difference here?

Was it that the people of the Zone started honing in on these matters much earlier? Was it that this path was simply incorrect? Or was it something that he was missing?

Leonel couldn't help but wonder about these things, comparing and contrasting the research papers here to what he had seen in the Zone. After doing this, it wasn't long before he came to a fundamental difference. 

Although these research papers were great and could even increase the strength of a Force while it was in use, it was ultimately not fundamentally changing anything, the foundation of the Force was still the very same foundation. 

If Leonel had to make a comparison, it was akin to a person who was weak of body being incredibly skilled in martial arts. Yet, they would be able to display great strength, but how much of it would be maximized if they were also malnourished or half dead? 

However, Leonel still felt that this comparison wasn't quite perfect. 

The people of the Zone didn't use all of these weird Force application methods. For example, that youth with a high spatial affinity Leonel had met before Thaela was completely caught off guard by the use of his lotus. 

It felt like there were two completely different paths, one of which was clearly more powerful than the other, at least on the surface. 

'Is it that it's more powerful? Or is that this method of Force Manipulation is still in its fledgling state. Just look at how many research papers there are here, and how many of them test the very same thing just in slightly different ways. 

'The history of the Void Palace is about half a million years from my understanding, but just from a casual look through the Oliidark family's library I was able to see that the history of that Zone is easily a hundred times that, and that's just from the perspective of one of its weaker families, who knows how much those much stronger families and organizations can see back?

'If you look at things like this, the Human Domain just hasn't had enough time to truly flesh out this method of Force Manipulation. But…'

Leonel was a bit hesitant to just accept this with open arms, the reason was that it was too difficult to tell what the end of the road had for this path. 

While it could potentially match the road the Zone had taken in the future, there was no guarantee. 

However, on the other hand, it wasn't as though Leonel had a sure fire method waiting for him on the other side either. Even if he started down this more "vetted" path, there was nothing to assure him that he was even taking the right steps.  RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
