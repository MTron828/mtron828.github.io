Leonel's arm went numb for a moment and he was pushed back into the skies somewhat; However; at the same time; the big bellied man nearly fell to his knees; his body growing far too weak to handle the impact; 

Leonel's gaze flashed and he activated his Bronze Aura immediately; He hadn't done so before because he was reliant on his Emperor's Gaze to finish this in one move, but he made a mental note that he would have to be more careful in the future before he urged his surfboard forward again and struck out once more with a fiercer momentum; 

BANG!

This time, the big bellied man's retort was even weaker than before and he was forced to his knees, his body shuddering as crimson blood so thick it almost looked black fell from the hole in his neck; 

A ripple of force dissipated along Leonel's Bronze Aura as he descended once more, swiftly cutting the big bellied man's head from his neck; 

Leonel caught the head in his free palm, his gaze somewhat serious; 

To think that the difficulty in dealing with a man on his last legs would be so great; Of course. it was probably also true that this man was quite powerful amongst Conventional Path Seventh Dimensional existences. but even so. he was still losing a large amount of his strength for every breath he took. and yet he still managed to repel Leonel; 

'These soul protection treasures are so well hidden and their auras are so restrained; I'll need to find and analyze the one this man used so I can not only create some in the future. but so that I can also know ahead of time whether a target of mind has such protection or not; If I make that mistake in the future. it'll be more than a little troublesome;'

It wasn't that Leonel was helpless against soul protection treasures. but if he wanted to bypass them it would also take more preparation; There were tiers within the abilities of Emperor's Might. especially for an ability as fundamental as Emperor's Gaze; It was just that the lowest level was the quickest to deploy in a pinch;

Leonel hesitated for a moment before tossing the corpse and the head into a snowglobe and rushing toward Emna who was most definitely on her last legs; 

Emna couldn't see straight and she had no idea that she had been saved; The gap between the Fifth and Seventh Dimension was simply far too vast; But she was lucky that she had Leonel by her side; 

Leonel pressed his hands together and a large amount of Vital Star Force and Life Force began to emit from him; Even if he didn't do anything else; just being in the proximity of these Sixth Dimensional Forces would be able to bring Emna back from the brink of death; but even so; Leonel still began to draw a Force Art; 

This Force Art was based on the style of Camelot's Magic System and it was quite crude since Leonel was formulating it on the spot; but to save a Fifth Dimensional existence; it was more than good enough; 

As Leonel's spell descended; Emna; who was barely conscious; could feel her bones mending and her organs healing at a visible pace; In just a few seconds; her vision had cleared enough to see Leonel standing over; and in just a few more seconds; she felt better than she ever had in her entire life; 

It was almost like she had been reborn; 

Instinctually. Emna scurried to her feet; Realizing that she wasn't dressed very appropriately as the strike had destroyed a lot of her clothing. she crossed an arm over her chest and looked toward Leonel; Although she was wary. she still wanted to say her thanks as it was obvious this person had saved her; But just as she was going to. she froze; 

"It's you?!"

Leonel smiled lightly; "It seems that you remember me. that's good;"

"How could I not, you're the reason…"

Emna trailed off, seemingly realizing that she was about to say something embarrassing. 

"Hm?" Leonel raised an eyebrow; "I'm the reason?"

Emna fidgeted before gritting her teeth and speaking. "You're the reason we've all been working so hard."

Leonel blinked, feeling quite speechless. He had a small amount of charm, but it definitely wasn't to the point that a woman he had only spoken to once would dedicate the next 20 years of her life to him just off the back of a single conversation, right? 

And also, who was this "we"? 

Seeing that Leonel was confused, Emna felt her heart sink slightly. Although she knew that it was a small chance, she had hoped that Leonel would remember them. 

There was a bit of strife in their organization and many of the malcontent came from the fact that many didn't believe they should be working so hard for a man they hadn't seen in decades, some even said he wouldn't even appreciate their efforts and that they should just be working for themselves. 

Of course, although these hit a sore spot, Emna knew the words were bullshit. Those people just wanted to move the organization toward a more selfish place, forgetting the reason they were established in the first place. 

However, seeing Leonel's reaction now, it was hard for her to not feel a small hint of resentment and even feel that maybe those people had some merit to their words… 

Suddenly, Leonel's gaze flashed. 

"Who is your leader?" Leonel suddenly asked. 

Emna sighed. Although she was disappointed, Leonel had still saved her life. 

"Is it Raylion and Aphestus?"

Hearing this, Emna's head snapped up to meet Leonel's gaze, a hint of expectation within them. 

Seeing her face was all Leonel needed, it seemed that he had been correct. 

Back then, after Valiant Heart Mountain was attacked by the other organizations of their Quadrant, they had been forced to disband. In fact, the only reason their disciples survived and were able to escape was because Leonel came back and held the line for them as they did so. As such, the former top disciple of Valiant Heart Mountain, Raylion, wanted to do something to pay Leonel back. But in his pride, he wasn't willing to join Leonel without anything to give. 

He wasn't more powerful than Leonel, so he couldn't protect the latter. He wasn't richer that Leonel nor did he have a stronger background than Leonel, so he couldn't support the latter. But he had still been determined to do something. 

Before they left, Leonel remembered saying some casual words that he hadn't thought about even once since then. 

"I need information…"

Leonel mumbled the same words that he had said back then. 

"… And I need a lot of it."

Raylion hadn't stopped after hearing his words back then, but Leonel could still sense the blazing fire of his will. 

Leonel suddenly smiled. He couldn't be blamed for not seeing through this immediately. From the beginning, Emna wasn't even a member of Valiant Heart Mountain, she was from a rival organization. How could he draw the connection so easily? 

Emna's eyes glistened like stars. Those words, they were the motto of their organization. 

"How interesting… In that case, what was your mission here? Why did you kill this man?"

Leonel asked a question that had him feeling curious. Even he couldn't quite deduce what was happening here.
