The weight of Nazag's words were exceptionally heavy, so heavy, in fact, that those who truly understood what the ramifications of such a thing would be were left frozen in silence. 

A war between the Morales and Constellation Bow Alliance wouldn't just throw the Human Domain into turmoil, it would be a near extinction level event. 

With two powerhouses on that level fighting it out, the idea of protecting the rest of the human race would become nothing more than a joke. By before the dust even settled, maybe half the Human Domain would be embroiled in this war while the other half would simply be too weak to have participated in the first place. 

The fact that Nazag could spear these words, though, meant a few things. 

Firstly, there was no doubt that his standing was high, exceptionally so. Even if it was just a guess on his part based on the importance of the bow to the Alliance, there were certain things that people without a certain amount of power wouldn't dare to say. 

If Nazag held no power, it would be like a homeless man of Ancient America declaring that they would lay siege to Ancient Russia. It might be true depending on the context, but what place did a homeless man have to speak of such things? If anyone was going to make the decision, it would be the President or someone of high military rank. 

And that led to the second thing. This bow… Was far more important than Leonel knew. It could be said that his mother had dropped a hot potato in his lap. 

Truthfully, though, Alienor hadn't been expecting Leonel to gain acknowledgment of the bow. She had only heard from her father that her Little Lion was a bowman so she snatched the best bow she could find, expecting Leonel to grow into it eventually. She could have never expected that there wouldn't even be a barrier of entry. 

Like this, Nazag's assumption was quite cogent from his perspective. Leonel, indeed, wasn't the only genius to have ever existed and while his Scarlet Star Force was impressive, none of that was related to bowmanship. 

None of these people here had any way of knowing how early on Leonel had grasped Bow Force, and they were even more in the dark about the fact Leonel would have grasped Enlightened Bow Force even faster if he had been aware that there were higher levels to strive for. 

It had to be remembered that Leonel originally refused to ask the dictionary about progressing his spearmanship because he wanted to organically progress and improve, he didn't want his decisions to be jaded or influenced by those that came before him. 

Ultimately, this method had worked out excellently for Leonel as he finally managed to find a method to fuse his intuition with his analytical ability in combat. But, the downside was that he was left in the dark about many things until it was later than one might expect. 

In the end, Leonel had actually ended up only learning of Natural Spear Force and Enlightened Bow Force after entering the Fifth Dimension, the latter coming later than the former because it was the catalyst that made Leonel realize there was something beyond. 

With things laid out like this, it was hard to see exactly how Leonel separated himself from other geniuses. Or, more accurately, exactly how he was supposedly a better fit for the White Lion Bow than anyone else that had tried to gain its favor. 

In Nazag's mind, with the information he had on hand, the most likely series of events was that Leonel's father, known for his extraordinary abilities as a Force Crafter, tampered with the bow to allow Leonel to use it. 

To those of Nazag's ilk, this was worse than a slap in the face. If Velasco had done such a thing, he might as well have pulled his pants down and pissed into their mouths. It was that foul of a mark on their history. 

Now, Leonel had suddenly ended up in the middle of not just one, but two sweeping storms. On one side there was the Constellation Bow Alliance and on the other, there was the Suaird family. In the middle, there was the Morales family and much of its current problems seemed to be Leonel's fault. 

It was then, amidst all the tension, that Leonel suddenly chuckled. 

His head turned back and looked toward Aina. 

"It seems I'm being underestimated again."

Aina shook her head. "Blame yourself, who asked you to try and act cool?"

"About that baby making appointment…"

"Can you be serious?!"

Leonel laughed, his hand reaching for the box and opening the lid. With a thought, he reached in and pulled out the egg, placing it back down where it had been and giving it a small pat. 

Just sitting there, the little guy was even taller than him. Leonel believed he even felt a little kick just now, causing his lips to curl into a smile. 

"Stay in this egg for a little while longer, your race is much cuter like this."

Leonel suddenly felt a hit to his waist. 

"How could you say that to a baby!"

"Did you want to serve this baby up on a platter a few hours ago?"

"So did you!"

Leonel cleared his throat. "Don't worry, even if our baby is ugly, I'll still love them just the same."𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Watching the two banter as though there was no one around at all, many weren't very certain of how they should be feeling. Did he just ignore the threat? What was happening here, exactly? 

"You all," Leonel looked up, having had his fill of teasing Aina, "I'll be leaving this egg here, but that also isn't license to take it. I'm going to begin drawing a teleportation formation out of here now. If you'd like to live, then you should probably forget your greed."

Leonel spoke these words and then began to do as he said, his mind already becoming focused enough to forget everything else.
