Leonel ignored everything else around him, the pressure suddenly becoming stifling for reasons most couldn't understand. 

In recent times, Leonel had mostly learned how to control the leaking of his aura when he focused thanks to fully awakening his King's Might Lineage Factor, but he couldn't be bothered to do so this time. The level of focus he needed was much deeper now than maybe it had ever been. 

Trying to draw a teleportation array fit for a Seventh Dimensional world was already beyond much of what Leonel should have been able to do. To try and draw one while also surrounded by dense Anarchic Force was another massive hassle. 

To make matters worse, even though they were technically surrounded by a large amount of energy currently, energy that could most definitely be used to fuel such a thing, this energy was in the form of Life Force and not Spatial Force, making the task even more difficult. 

This meant that Leonel not only needed a focused form of mass teleportation, he also needed it to be able to convert Force toward another use case. 

In the Dimensional Verse, using one form of energy as another was nigh impossible. Like Wise Star Order had said, these Forces, especially at these high levels, practically had personalities of their own. To try and fit them into a box they weren't meant to fit in was basically impossible. 

However, there was good news too. 

For one, this was Life Force, not something unruly like Leonel's Scarlet Star Force. In addition, it was designed to be absorbed by babies. 

Granted, the Rapax weren't exactly coddling of their young, not in the normal sense, anyway. But, a baby was a baby, was a baby, simply put. Compared to other Seventh Dimensional Forces Leonel could try to take control of, this would be the simplest. 

And that led to the second advantage Leonel had, <Dimensional Cleanse>'s Visualization. 

It had to be remembered that the Fifth Dimension was all about unchaining the mind and removing mental limits on the body to unleash its true and full potential. In order to do this, techniques used Visualizations and certain Artistic Conceptions as exercises of the mind, helping those that used it to strengthen and fortify their minds, thus facilitating its unshackling. 

Despite this being the case, Leonel had hardly relied on <Dimensional Cleanse> at all during his breakthroughs. This was because he had another method of releasing the shackles of his mind, and that was his True State Innate Node. 

Visualizing and comprehending his Scarlet Star Force was not only just as good, but in Leonel's use case, it was even better than relying on any other technique. This was because his Innate Node was perfectly tailored to him, more perfectly tailored than any other technique could possibly be. 

However, despite this being the case, this didn't mean that Leonel had ever stopped comprehending the third stage of <Dimensional Cleanse> because only by comprehending it fully like he had done with the second stage could he pass it on to those around him. 

It was a difficult and long drawn out process. Even with his computing powers, closing in those final gaps for Leonel was almost too difficult. But, he luckily had three breakthroughs. 

The first was his Ability Index suddenly gaining a huge boost thanks to something his father had apparently done. The second was his Luxnix family Lineage Factor reaching perfection and allowing his mind to enter the Sixth Dimension. And, the final breakthrough was him entering Tier 6. 

Leonel had still yet to fully comprehend this third stage, but he had gained a small inkling that had inspired him. 

How was it that the formation of his Stars could cause so much atmospheric Scarlet Star Force to surge toward him? 

It could be said that if not for this benefit, this battle would have been far harder on Leonel. Of course, it only lasted a small time and eventually ran out, but if Leonel could trigger this more often without having to form a star, wouldn't he essentially gain the ability to use his Scarlet Star Force without any of the drawbacks? 

Leonel was certain that if he hadn't run out of Scarlet Star Force, his spear would have been enough to beat Amery. Of course, that would have not been much different from using his Bow anyway, but the point still stood. 

This aside, Leonel's thoughts were simple. He couldn't catalyze such a large surge of Force without much input like <Dimensional Cleanse> seemed to be able to do. But, what he could do was use a large amount of Force as a Catalyst to bring in the Force he wanted. 

Just like that, he could exchange all this Seventh Dimensional Life Force around them for Seventh Dimensional Spatial Force! Then, he could reverse engineer the teleportation path they took to get here to send them all back in the proper direction. 

Easy? Easy. 

Leonel's body flickered around the cavern, the Force Art beneath him growing more and more complex as he wielded the half that remained of his spear. 

It took several hours and he even had to pause several times, but he was soon close to finishing. 

Unfortunately, it was exactly at that time that the cavern rumbled. 

Leonel's gaze shot up, his jaw steeling. 

"Aina."

Aina appeared to his side without hesitation. 

Leonel swept a gaze around. "If you all want to live, I would advise that you hurry up. If you don't, feel free to stay here and die."

The sudden rumbling seemed to cause the prideful geniuses to forget themselves for a moment. One tried to take advantage of the commotion to swipe the egg, but they ended up with an arrow between the eye before Leonel could even do anything. 

Nazag lowered his bow in silence, not bothering to look in Leonel's direction. 

As for Leonel, he didn't have time to guess at or understand Nazag's motives. Maybe it was just his way of saying he didn't owe Leonel any favors anymore, regardless, he didn't care. 

Leonel finished the final stroke as the youths of the Void Palace surged in. 

A wild green glow overwhelmed everything, blinding most. 

Leonel squinted, his brows furrowed tightly. He had created this array on the fly using a Force Art system he wasn't even used to. He hadn't been able to optimize things the way he would like. It was still possible for them to be stopped. 

If that happened, things would get more than just a little troublesome. 

70%... 80%... 90%... 

At that moment, the ceiling was crashed through once again, a horde of Rapax appearing. 

The lights had grown so bright that Leonel could hardly see what was happening beyond the bounds of the formation anymore. But, he could just barely make out a Runed Rapax cocking their arm back. 

'Shit.'

Leonel's jaw steeled. Anything thrown by a Seventh Dimensional existence was bound to be endlessly powerful. If it landed on the formation lines, or had enough Force to disrupt the natural flow, they were screwed. 

The latter was far less likely since the vastness and quantity of Force Leonel had used was too much. But, as for the former…

97%... 98%... 99%...

A beam of light that looked like black lightning shot through the skies. It was so dense in its blackness that all the light around it seemed to vanish. 

The beam swerved, shooting up until it was right above Leonel's head and then barrelling downward with an impossible to track speed.

100%

BOOM!

A roar of pain resounded. 

"Leonel?!"

Aina, despite her head and vision swimming, rushed to Leonel's side. 

At that moment, Leonel was pinned to the ground, an odd rod lying horizontally across his palm and shattering the grey land around him. 

Leonel's entire body was driven into the ground. His shoulder was dislocated, his knee was shattered, and every bone in his hand had been grinded to dust.
