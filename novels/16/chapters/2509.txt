Chapter 2510 [Bonus] Enough

[Bonus chapter courtesy of Firemonster <3 1/6]

Clarence rose to the skies and entered the realm of the Dream Pavilion again. He casually threw Khelgis and Adru to the side. Quite frankly, he doubted it would matter whether he killed these two now or not, but in the territory of the Dream Pavilion, they wouldn't be able to do much of anything.

The Dream Force here was so dense that it was practically a debuff for anyone who stepped onto these clouds. If you couldn't protect your mind, you could even end up dying. It seemed that these two youngsters knew that well, or at the very least, they had figured it out. Because the moment they sensed the assault of Dream Force, they forgot everything else and entered a state of deep meditation.

For most people, unless you had a Life State Force or another method of protecting your mind, stepping into the Dream Pavilion was as good as being forced into a permanent unconsciousness for the rest of your life.

This was part of the reason that Clarence had acted without hesitation.

Of course, the odds that Urlgan had a Life State Force was probably quite high. But this passive Dream Force was just the least of what the Dream Pavilion had to protect itself.

If not for the fact that most people who stepped in here would turn into vegetables, the Dream Pavilion would be the perfect place to host what remained of the Human Race.

'Now, it seems that waiting is all we have left to do...' Clarence stood before a small floating cloud that had countless dots spread across it. These dots were the teleportation platforms he had spread, or more accurately, activated.

These teleportation platforms had been around for a very long time and could be said to be a hallmark of the former glory of the Human Race.

They had been shut down many generations ago because the number of Dream Force experts, and the number of people who could protect themselves from the Dream Pavilion's Domain, had dwindled to the point that they no longer mattered. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Now, however, he had activated this system once again. All that was left was to wait.

There would no doubt be many who sent themselves to death because of his words, but he couldn't spare the sympathy for these people. At best, he could respect them for the attempt, even if it was made in ignorance.

He closed his eyes and fell into his thoughts. These next few days to weeks would feel like an eternity to him.

...

"Explain it to me!" Anselma roared. Blood ran down the corner of her mouth due to the exertion, but she didn't seem to notice it at all. She didn't care how agitated her inner organs became; she just wanted a damn answer.

But she didn't receive one.

The three remaining members of the Four Great Families that had acted with her, including Ymesmai, didn't say a word. Even when it seemed like she might truly go berserk, they couldn't bring themselves to care at all.

Toward this reaction, Anselma laughed, almost a little too heartily. It didn't sound like a dark laughter at all, but it was rather a deep belly laugh.

"Come, come. Look down on me more. Show me more of your true faces."

"Anselma." The man of the Adurna family barked, his blue hair and eyes shimmering. "That's enough."

Anselma sneered. "When King was alive, you three wouldn't even dare to look me in the eyes. But now you've grown a pair of balls, huh? Gavinus?!"

Gavinus sneered. "I suggest you say less; you're embarrassing yourself."

"That's what you said when I insisted on stepping out to go and confirm if that child was dead, and how did it end? That strike could have killed any one of you. You're lucky the Sun Demon dealt with it, or else you would have gone to the afterlife feeling nothing but regret for having called me crazy."

Gavinus' jaw clenched and the others fell into silence. But soon, he seemed to recover as his sneer deepened.

"Have you had enough, now?"

Anselma's crimson gaze flared up again, but she managed to control herself when she felt that the gazes of the three surrounding her were truly all the same.

Now that she thought about it, all four that had gone at that time should be just as heavily injured as her, but she was the only one running around while sporting all these injuries. The other three had focused on recuperating, even sending these three as representatives of them.

In this situation, she was at a clear disadvantage.

She had always seen the Four Great Families as one unit, which was why she didn't really have her guard up. Although there was a lot of infighting, especially between the Brazingers and the Adurnas, it never crossed that line.

But there was something about the expressions of these three that made her feel like this might be in the past.

"Are you three trying to gang up on me?"

"No."

This time, it was Ymesmai who spoke. Clearly, she wanted to cut the Adurna man off before he made the situation worse.

"However, Anselma, we need to make something clear. A lot of the ongoings have been pulled along by you and King. We do not care who you sleep with, and I can understand if Adam Renier's-"

"Don't you dare say that name in front of me!" Anselma snapped. The dangerous light in her eyes had returned and she was truly like a caged animal by this point.

"-if his betrayal led you into a tailspin. However, enough time has passed and it's time for you to let go."

"Are you all crazy? You think any of this still has to do with him?!"

"Of course it does. Would you have fallen so deeply for King if not because of these matters? You let a Dream Force expert manipulate you so thoroughly, so much so that you forgot what our four families exist for in the first place."
