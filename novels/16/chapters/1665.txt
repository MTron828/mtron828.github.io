Leonel had no idea what was going on outside, nor did he particularly care. If he had known about Conon's thoughts, he would have done nothing more than laugh. 

Back then, he was aware of Conon's true thoughts. If Conon had been the one born with a Scarlet Star Force Innate Node, he would have had all the confidence in himself in the world. In such a situation, he wouldn't be talking about "humans" and "Spirituals" and their gaps. It was only because he felt that Leonel was unworthy that he had said such things. 

However, didn't Leonel have just as much confidence in himself? Conon could just sit tightly and watch. 

Leonel sent a gaze toward the weapon racks that manifested around him. He remembered what happened the last time he was here. His arm was broken so he had no choice but to rely on throwing weapons and shields. 

For the first time, though, he was completely healthy and he chose… nothing. 

Under the astonished gazes of the spectators, Leonel didn't choose any weapon whatsoever and directly allowed the sequence to begin. His vision spun and when he appeared once more, he realized that he had stepped into what could only be called the land of the dead. 

Leonel recognized this place almost immediately. It was because of this region that Aina hadn't been able to continue past the 12th floor during her original run. Because these enemies had no Blood Force to use, she ended up dying in the end. Now it seemed that it would be Leonel's first batch of nine floors. 

The ground splintered and bony hands reached up. However, Leonel only sent a casual glance through the surroundings. 

People had forgotten his name. It was probably time that they remember. 

He lightly raised a foot and stamped downward. In that moment, a surge of radiant Earth Force compressed the ground, forcing it into submission.  Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Silence fell over the spectators on the outside of the Void Tower. Usually, the surroundings would be filled with lively discussion no different from a sporting event on Earth. After all, all of these people had paid good money to witness the events of this day, but they hadn't thought that they would see such a thing. 

Usually, when records were set, they would only appear on the "First Time" rankings. It had to be remembered that there were two batches of rankings, each with two categories of their own. 

There were current rankings and all-time rankings. In addition, both of these categories were separated into first entries and cumulative rankings. 

Normally, the cumulative rankings were hardly ever touched… This was because those monstrous Domain Ranked disciples with Seventh Dimensional strength also entered the tower and their speed would be far beyond what those of the Sixth Dimension could compare to. As a result, most only hoped to earn a name on the first entry rankings. 

Who would have thought, though, that in one sweep, not even taking half a minute, Leonel would lay claim to nine of these rankings all at once? 

The ignorant might say that he had gotten floors that he could easily counter. But how often did such a thing happen? Why didn't' others also capitalize like he had? 

In addition, controlling Earth Force in higher Dimensional worlds was among the hardest things to do. And yet Leonel had just casually stomped a foot and compressed the earth in a radius of almost a hundred meters to the point of being able to crush Sixth Dimensional skeletons known for their hardness to death… 

Just what kind of feat was this?!

The three of the Cataclysm Generation fell into silence, their casual expression becoming solemn. 

… 

Leonel's vision swam as he entered the tenth floor. He remembered this floor all too well. The last time he came to this floor, he lost consciousness, and when he woke up, the Spear Domain Heirloom was in disarray and the Segmented Cube was gone. 

But at the same time, his Mage Core had undergone earth shattering changes and his Starry Tailed Fox Lineage Factor had reached completion. Even now he didn't quite know whether to see it as a blessing or a curse. 

Regardless of which it was, though, this particular boss floor wasn't the same as what Leonel had experienced in the past. At the very least, it wasn't a member of the Spirituals Race, but was instead a member of the Rapax. 

'Oh? So is this how it works? You face a member of the powerful races every ten floors? That could be interesting.'

Leonel smiled lightly and threw out a fist. 

It seemed all too casual, and yet all the sounds of the world seemed to be sucked away, leaving behind nothing more than the image of a flying fist. 

BANG!

Leonel's fist stopped in the air, a full 20 meters away from the Rapax, and yet it sounded as though it had collided with it perfectly. The air had compressed before his fist to the extent that when it came to a stop, it felt like he had collided against solid steel. 

In the distance, the Rapax exploded on impact, a shower of greenish-violet blood drizzling down in a fine, misty rain as Leonel stepped into the 11th floor. 

…

<Eleventh Floor Cleared – New Record Set – Leonel Morales 00:00:02>

This time, Leonel didn't beat the all-time record, but the impact of his win was still no less horrifying. 

Everyone knew that the Morales family didn't specialize in fist techniques and neither did Leonel, that much they knew. This meant that Leonel had only casually decided to use a fist this time, and yet the result was the death of a Rapax at his level from over 20 meters away. 

Just what was going on here, exactly? 

…

Leonel stepped in the Eleventh Floor to find a familiar challenge. It was the Heavy Gravity floors. Ironically, this had also been his Eleventh Floor challenge back then, but he hadn't been conscious to experience it. 

This time, however, he would be. 

His lips curled into a smile.
