Leonel's gaze was frighteningly sharp, a suffocating coldness rolling off of his body in waves. 

After he crossed the 10 kilometer mark, the difficulty shot up with every increment coming in sets of 10 kilometers. 

The truth was that when one was on a planet, assuming a flat surface, 10 kilometers was already far enough for a target to disappear over the curvature of a normally sized planet. As such, even if you could aim further, it was useless unless you had methods to stand in the air. 

Obviously, this trial wasn't set on a planet's surface and neither did the Void Palace have the curvature of a planet either. However, even so, the Void Palace had other limitations such as Anarchic Force that didn't allow targeting from so far away. 

This was all to say that even the expert archers of the Void Palace didn't have practice aiming at targets that were so far away, even if it was a still target, let alone a target that was moving at five kilometers an hour. 

Seeing Leonel skip right to five kilometers, and then immediately to 10 kilometers, left Mallael, Cras and Kysen absolutely tongue tied. Usually in this trial, making it to the five kilometer mark was already an excellent result, but he actually directly skipped over it. 

And… it didn't even look like he was finished. 

Leonel adjusted the arc of his bow, moving from a straight line and raising it into the air. With a TWANG, he released another arrow, allowing it to beautifully arc through the air. 

BANG!

The 20-kilometer target shattered. 

Leonel's gaze blazed. At that moment, the bowstring of his bow construct became thicker as he pulled it back once again and raised his bow even higher. 

A gorgeous arc flew through the air once again, shattering the 30 kilometer target. 

Without fail, Leonel's arrow passed through the center of the target. At such a distance, the three archers by his side couldn't even see the targets clearly, but the sound was undeniable and the motes of light were blinding. 

Leonel strengthened his bowstring again, his forearm and back rippling as he pulled back and struck again, and then again. 

The 50-kilometer target shattered. 

Leonel's eyes narrowed. There was no 60-kilometer target. Up ahead, an extra 50 kilometers further, a 100 kilometer target lay. Even with Leonel's vision amplified by his Starry Tailed Fox Lineage Factor he still couldn't see it clearly. 

At that moment, Leonel's irises glowed with a blinding white-gold light. He could use his Internal Sight to cover the distance, but he didn't feel that it was necessary. 

His pupils dilated, a hint of a bestial aura rippling off of his body in a concentrated steam. His vision was instantly magnified, the blurry target in the distance suddenly felt as though it was right in front of him. 

Leonel squeezed his bow construct, crushing it into motes of light. 

With a flip of his palm, a shimmering bow appeared in his hands, causing the eyes of the three youths to open wide. 

"White Lion Bow! It's you!"

Leonel didn't seem to hear them at all, his expression calm as he drew, inhaled, released, and exhaled. His movements were smooth and seemed to fuse into nature itself, the painting of a beautiful scenery causing the thoughts of the three young men to come to a grinding halt albeit for just a moment. 

BANG!

In the distance, a radiant pillar of light shot into the skies causing the trials to ripple wildly in all directions. 

Leonel lowered his bow and cast a glance at it for a moment. He hadn't used the White Lion Bow in a very long time, but it felt heavier now than it had in the past, which was odd. The bow should have gotten much lighter, not heavier. 

'Interesting. You don't like the path I've taken?' Leonel chuckled. 'How stubborn.'

The White Lion Bow had acknowledged him the moment he touched it all those years ago, and now it seemed to be dissatisfied. But since it wasn't a true Life Grade Bow and was only Quasi Life Grade, it couldn't make any sweeping changes after already accepting him once. If it was truly a Life Grade weapon, its dissatisfaction would probably mean that Leonel wouldn't be able to use it at all. 

Leonel found the phenomenon to be interesting. After all, compared to his past self, his skill was on a completely different level. Although he didn't form Seventh Dimensional Bow Force, he could whenever he wanted. The only reason he didn't was because he felt that his Bow Force had far more potential to unleash at its current stage. 

To think the White Lion Bow wouldn't be happy with him. 

Leonel chuckled. "Are you mad that I used a system designed for the spear with you? It's the same difference, don't you think? Is there a need for this tantrum?"

The bow vibrated, seemingly understanding what Leonel was saying. 

"Be obedient," Leonel said lightly, his smile fading. "This is just the beginning regardless. If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind. By then, you won't have the luxury of showing your dissatisfaction at all."Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The bow vibrated again, clearly unhappy. But in the end, it still obediently became lighter in the end. 

With a flip of his palm, the White Lion Bow vanished. 

This wasn't the first time Leonel had felt the dissatisfaction of his Weapon Forces. Back then, when he first formed Enlightened Bow Force, his Spear Domain Lineage Factor had tried to stop it from happening before it failed. However, with the two clashing like this, it was inevitable the head butting would end in them being weaker than they could be. 

If one reason Leonel hadn't truly stepped onto Sovereignty with either one was because of the oddity of his King's Might Lineage Factor, then another reason was this. 

However, Leonel had no intention of giving up either one. So if they couldn't learn to be obedient the nice way, he would force them. 

At that moment, the pillar of light in the distance descended before Leonel, forming the image of a complex network of Force Arts.
