Xavnik's heart jumped. When he heard mention of the Cloud Race, the odd light in his eyes couldn't be hidden in the slightest. If he had any doubt, it was hard to retain it now. The existence of the Cloud Race was too easy to hide. Leonel could have easily hidden them amidst his people without a word and Xavnik would never know.

The appearance of the Cloud Race wasn't a small matter. Although there were, of course, weaker and stronger members of every race. Usually, the strength of other races was far more consistent than that of humans. Having the Cloud Race on one's side was like having a guaranteed floor of strength on your side.

The weakest humans were absolutely no match for the weakest of Cloud Race members. This was a well known fact. But the true hidden danger here was whether or not Leonel had managed to get his hands on any powerful members.

The likelihood in Xavnik's opinion was very low. However, he had some information on hand that made him not place the probability at 0%, and that was the information he had on Leonel's very first interaction with the Cloud Race. He had been able to easily point them out when others hadn't been able to, that was definitely an eyebrow raising matter.

Considering Leonel had dominion over Earth, Xavnik didn't believe that there were no Cloud Race members targeting the only Eighth Dimensional potential world in the Human Domain. In that case, it might even be true that Leonel had gained the ability to see through Cloud Race members by first observing Cloud Race members that had been exposed on Earth itself.

In that case, the odds that Leonel might have an extremely powerful member of the Cloud Race on his side wasn't 0%, nor was it too low, it might even be as high as 30% or even 40%. The more Xavnik thought about it, the more serious he became, but Leonel's smile was just the same. He looked na√É¬Øve and innocent, but could a na√É¬Øve and innocent individual control the Cloud Race under his charge? Could they become the greatest example of a dark horse in Heir Wars history? Could they be the one to defeat the enemy that Third Nova thought he would have to struggle the most against?

In Xavnik's opinion, Sixth Nova had been too young, Fifth Nova was a wild card and a potential pitfall, but if he took caution, things would be fine. Fourth Nova was a playboy who had taken far too long to take things seriously, and even then he had only begun to take things seriously because he had accidentally gotten his long-time fling pregnant, leading to a whole host of pressure, especially because they were both still within the Void Palace when it happened.

As for Second Nova, he had never taken him seriously because although he was clever, he was too used to being a lone wolf. He didn't know how to rely on others, and even when it came to his wide information network, he micro-managed everything he could. One of the most important characteristics of a leader was knowing when to release the reins, and Second Nova thought he could do everything on his own.

Knowing all of this, Xavnik had slotted First Nova in as his greatest enemy. He both had great combat prowess and was extremely intelligent, not to mention extremely charismatic as a leader. But somehow, before he even got the chance to lift a finger, this supposed top tier enemy of his had been eliminated by someone else, and he wasn't even sure how it had happened.

Now Seventh Nova, the one that he had given the least regard to, was smiling an unreadable expression toward him, leaving him without the words to respond.

After a long while, Xavnik slowly nodded. "Little Nova, you've truly been too honest; it feels a little burdensome."I think you should take a look at

Leonel's smile didn't fade. "If I am too on guard against you, how can we work together properly? We don't have much time, how about you tell me what you have in mind?"

"Right. Little Nova's numbers are smaller than expected, so I assume that you've used your mind to achieve the standards you have today. I wouldn't be surprised if you have many ideas far better than my own. I'll tell you my plans and you tell me how you feel about them, how about it?"

"No problem," Leonel nodded.

Xavnik smiled. "As I see things, our greatest threat is the Omann family. They have been focused on Crafting for several weeks now, and it's hard to tell what their plans are because as more time passes, they spend less and less time clashing with others. At the same time, the biggest wildcard is likely to be the Spiritual Faith.N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

"Even with all of this being the case, I don't believe that attacking either one of them directly is a smart idea. I believe it's best that we act to take out the Suiard family first.

"You and Amery have quite the history. After seeing you, I think this plan will work far better with you than it would have with First Nova. If you challenge him to a one-on-one battle, I don't believe that he wouldn't accept, if for no other reason than to regain his lost pride.

"I have a treasure here that I've gained from a Heir Grade Dungeon. It's able to release a Force-eating poison. If it's released at an opportune moment, then whether it's his Sword Force or other Forces, Amery will find them all to be useless. He will either be forced to use his badge to escape or die."

Leonel raised an eyebrow. "Interesting. Why haven't you used this yourself just yet?"

"Well, for one, aside from what I've said about it likely working best with you, I only have one such treasure, and I've had to be cautious with it. In addition, while you're doing this, there'll be a great opportunity."
