Chapter 2460 [Bonus] Blissful Ignorance

[Bonus chappy thanks to Mr. Ham <3 (5/6)]

"Nice of you to join us."

These words seemed to carry a great weight of pettiness with them. If not for the fact Miel had said something, they would have ignored Cidra's appearance completely. It was clear that there were quite a number that were unhappy with this woman.

Still, this unhappiness didn't spill over into anything more toxic than this pettiness.

Without saying another word, Cidra took a seat by Miel and continued to listen to the arguments about nothing.

Eamon's words had stirred something in her, which caused her to come in the first place. But she knew that the reality was that there would be nothing of importance discussed here, just the same, circle-jerking nonsense.

The Slayer Legion. Such a bold and imposing name, and yet it had been clipped of its wings long ago and it was nothing but a bunch of bastards floating in the ether. Its only saving grace was that though these guys were assholes, they were still dedicated to the cause, or else they wouldn't be here. The odds that any one of them was a traitor was about as likely as the sun suddenly falling from the skies.

The reason for this was quite simple. All of them were defectors, people who had left the most powerful organizations of the human alliance after learning of the truth behind the scenes.

How could everyone be content with the status quo? Content with knowing that most of the knowledge of the world was under lock and key in a vain attempt to stop the rise of others?

Ultimately, most would fall in line and accept it. The tide was already so great in the other direction, how could they possibly choose to fight back against it.

Those here were those stupid enough to try and say no to that status quo.

Quite valiant, no?

In practice, yes.

In real life, well...

"-Bullshit! The evidence is right here, Vivak Godlen roared out the words Leonel Morales. It was loud enough that even if you weren't trying to spy on the situation, you would have heard it."

Miel, who was in the same sort of lull as Cidra, suddenly shot up violently, his palms slamming into the table. The burst of pressure was so great that the two men who were practically prepared to launch themselves across the table were forced back into their seats.

Everyone was caught off guard. Miel was entirely too calm and collected to have any sort of outburst like this. He was so calm most often that many almost forgot that he was there if not for his obvious power.

"Speak," Miel commanded.

The man adjusted himself, and eventually frowned. He didn't like being commanded like this, but since Miel had spoken and rarely acted like this, he chose to let it slide.

"I said the words Leonel Morales were said. That's no expert we know of, and we have intel that this was a name used among the participants of the selection of those bastards pushed ahead by so much."

Miel slowly sat back down, his brows furrowed into a tight frown. He was unhappy.

Cidra hesitated amidst the sudden silence and looked toward Miel.

"You know him, Miel?"

"I..." Miel seemed to have something lodged in his throat. "... He's my daughter's ex-boyfriend."

The group of men and women were speechless. All this commotion about such a thing? Other than Cidra whose gaze dimmed when she heard this, the others didn't really know how to react.

Miel shook his head, feeling a bit annoyed that he had to explain these things at all.

First, he was annoyed by the change of events. For some reason, the selection took place far earlier than it should have; there should have been several iterations left before they took this step, and yet everything was accelerated.

Now hearing the name of the kid he wanted to smack the ass of even in his dreams, he was doubly annoyed.

That fist he had given Leonel really wasn't enough. Truthfully, he had only held back as much as he did because of his daughter. Hopefully, by now she was over him so he could really teach him a lesson.

As for Aina, he wasn't worried. He had put in place his own contingency plans. So long as Yuri was by her side, due to her Soul Clairvoyance, Aina should get mistaken as a Spiritual as well and removed from the selection. That was right. Part of the reason the demons were able to almost expose the human race for using higher-level races was because of the planning of their Slayer Legion. Although Cidra was quite jaded, it wasn't all bad.

So long as his plans went well, Aina would end up in the World of Spirituals and it would be a long while before anyone sensed anything wrong.

As for how he knew exactly what Ability Indexes and Lineages Factors Aina had, didn't he also have a Bronze Tablet?

Though... he was not a Wise Star Order...

Of course, Miel could have never guessed that Leonel would have a treasure like the Segmented Cube that the human alliance couldn't scan into at all. Nor could he have guessed that his daughter would have actually died long before his plan could kick in.

As for where Yuri was now, it was impossible to tell as well.

This father was in blissful ignorance, only thinking about kicking a certain kid's ass.

'How dare you make my daughter cry...'

Miel was stewing so much that it was difficult for anyone to even think properly, let alone continue the meeting.

It seemed that this would be another fruitless get-together.

Leonel roared, and Emulation Spatial Force came off of him in waves. His thoughts seemed to manifest, and a dream-like world took shape, all sorts of fanciful thoughts and memories falling into a glob of abstract art.

On his arm, Little Tolly glowed just as furiously.

Emulation Force... silver and gold...

Little Tolly... silver and gold...

It felt so superficial, and yet it was this that made Leonel connect dots he hadn't before.

Emulation Spatial Force... Was it just the far inferior version of Infinity Force?

To be anything, to forge anything...

To create anything.

Emulation Spatial Force would never be Infinity Force. It was akin to trying to make a normal Fire Force into Scarlet Star Force.

However...
