The third individual was a hulking man, standing at three meters tall and dwarfing even Wymlan. He was the genius of the Taur family, Armand Taur. 

Just like this, three geniuses of the Cataclysm Generation had appeared one another, each exuding an aura that seemed to make the skies tremble and the earth crack. However, they were surprised to find that the organized region they had become used to was not only in disarray, but Conon even found that several members of the Lion Pride Faction were actually bleeding out on the ground. 

At that moment, Conon's good mood vanished into thin air. 

"WHO DARES?!"

His words came out in a lion-like roar, wisps of golden Force shooting out from his lips like a sonic attack. But it didn't even seem like he had done this consciously, it was more like his power had become a part of the very fabric of his being. 

Conon's gaze almost turned bloodshot, his eyes sweeping over the surroundings until he locked onto Valor and the others who had been approaching the tower to watch. At that moment, Conon's gaze locked onto Valor, the aggression in his expression increasing manifold. 

In his mind, Valor was the only one with the balls to do such a thing, and he was probably the only one with the power to dare to do so as well. 

"You did this?!" Conon growled. 

The truth was that Conon's speculations weren't exactly poor. After all, Valor had indeed entered without paying what others did. If someone had been foolish enough to stop him, then this was a very possible outcome. The difference was, though, that no one would dare to act against Valor. 

However, Conon hadn't been here to see this, so there was nothing particularly wrong about his assumption. And, Valor, who was a man of few words to begin with, couldn't even care to explain himself. Even if he did have the mind to explain, he still wouldn't for the mere fact that it would seem as though he was trying to avoid Conon's fury. 

He, Valor Morales, did not fear the likes of Conon Lio. If the latter wanted to act, he was free to do so. 

At the same time, Wymlan, Quonor, and the others were already dissatisfied with Valor for obstructing and oppressing them earlier, so why would they be in a hurry to help him clear his name? 

Conon's steps slowed as he walked forward, but the heaviness behind them only grew with every oppressive push of his gait. 

The surroundings quaked and even the Anarchic Force in the air seemed to be showing signs of swaying out of the way as Conon's fury rose like a tempest. 

It had been very long since anyone dared to provoke him like this. Did his Lion's Pride Faction look like something just anyone could trample upon as they pleased? 

However, just as Conon was about to take action, Simona released a light hum. 

"Hm?"

Her delicate brows rose as she looked up. Right then, two large projections manifested themselves, one showing the form of Leonel outfitted in a familiar skintight black suit, and another showing Aina wearing the very same thing. 

"Him?"

Conon's voice was tinged with surprise. Leonel hadn't returned even after so long so many who knew of his existence thought he had died. Of course, nothing would be confirmed until the spatial storm phenomena came to an end, but to think that he would truly be among the last batch. 

Many thought that Conon would be enraged that someone had actually dared to take his spot, but in reality, after being surprised, Conon suddenly began to laugh again, his voice booming across the horizon. 

This was perfect, simply too perfect. 

Back when the influx of geniuses forced the Void Tower to change its rules and reshuffle things around to better optimize their growth, everyone of the Cataclysm Generation had entered one after another. But this wasn't the most important point. 

What made Conon laugh like he was laughing now was that they had also all entered at Tier 1 of the Sixth Dimension. 

If Leonel had just returned like Conon believed he did, this would mean that it had been only a year since he had met Conon, at least from Leonel's perspective. In such a case, Leonel would also, at most, be in Tier 1 of the Sixth Dimension. 

This would be an absolutely perfect one to one comparison. 

Conon himself, on that day, had managed to climb to the 42nd floor in one go, a feat that was enough to shock the whole of the Void Palace. For context, the strength of the Seventh Dimension began at the 50th floor, making his accomplishment at the mere first Tier absolutely ridiculous. 

Of course, Conon hadn't performed the best, but he also claimed that it was because he was unlucky in the floors he was given, something he stood by even to this day. 

Regardless, if Leonel couldn't at least make it that high then he was nothing but trash. In that situation, he would no longer have to hold back. Once Leonel came out, he wouldn't have to worry about whining about him having a 20 year advantage because he would have already proven himself to be superior to Leonel.  RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Conon remembered what happened that day in the Rapax Nest all too well, not to mention those arrogant words that Leonel had spoken. Back then, Conon had claimed that humans couldn't coexist with powerful Innate Nodes and that Leonel would eventually be swallowed up by his own talent in the future. However, in response, he only received Leonel's sneers and derision. In his entire life, Conon had never experienced such humiliation, especially not for an individual of his own generations. 

… "… Don't assign limits you do to yourself to me…" …

Those words and Leonel's brazen smirk were branded into his mind. 

When he came out, Conon would be sure to grind all of his bones to dust.
