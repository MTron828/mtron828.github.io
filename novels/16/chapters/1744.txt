Leonel stood in the skies for a long while; seemingly not even noticing the number of Brazinger family members slowly encircling him; Let alone that; he didn't seem to have taken care to mind the sheer number of them that had surrounded his flagship; 

By this point, they had given up on trying to make it on board and had settled for the next best thing: waiting for Leonel; 

As Leonel stood in the skies in silence, a ship just as silently approached, stopping just about a hundred or so meters from him; Given the unique rules of space travel and warfare, this distance was actually very close and was about as close as most dared to come without having to worry about other variables; At that distance, it might as well have been the equivalent of someone standing nose to nose with Leonel on the ground; 

Leonel had slowly calmed from his initial rage induced state; There were certain things that he had to be rational about; 

He didn't actually believe that his grandfather was so useless; This old man was someone even his father spoke of with respect; Although this might be in part due to the influence of his mother; knowing his father's personality; so long as Alienor wasn't within earshot; if he couldn't be bothered to care about Emperor Fawkes; he would say as much; 

In addition. even if he was wrong about all of this and his grandfather really was useless. just a few days ago his mother had threatened Shield Cross Stars into scramming out of their territory with just a single sentence; If the Brazinger family was as fragile as they seemed on the surface. they would have long since been weeded out. if not by his mother. then most definitely by his father; 

These were the thoughts that kept Leonel rational on the surface and helped him to have a modicum of patience. At the very least. his body wasn't in as poor a state as it was previously. so his fuse was just a bit longer. 

However, that didn't mean that he would explode any moment now; 

The spaceship came to a stop; With its size being just about five or six meters long. it wasn't very large at all; It reminded him a lot of a small yacht. just barely having enough space for some minor luxuries; 

At that moment, a man stepped out and looked toward Leonel; 

"You are in the air space of the Brazinger family; Who you are doesn't matter; Under the laws set by the Brazinger Clan. you will be detained and your assets will be seized;"

The man clasped his hands behind his back, exuding a strong and mighty aura; 

For the first time; Leonel looked toward him; Indeed; there was something odd about the Brazinger family; The momentum of this man wasn't any lesser than a disciple of the Void Palace; In fact; his aura was slightly more robust than even Conon of the Lio family; and that was despite seemingly being only at Tier 7;  Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Of course. this mattered little to the present Leonel who had defeated Conon with hardly any effort; But it might matter for a future version of himself. especially considering the fact this man was tasked by the Brazinger family to basically be a glorified guard dog; 

Something wasn't exactly adding up; 

Leonel wasn't unfamiliar with the Brazinger family; In fact; he had a deep fued with one of their members; a spectacled young man by the name of Simeon; 

In truth, the two of them had met three times. One ended in a sort of pyrrhic victory for Leonel where he lost Aina for a span of several months, but boh the second and third time, Leonel had directly suppressed him both times. 

From Leonel's understanding of the situation, Simeon had quite a high status amongst the Brazingers and his Ability Index was extremely powerful as well. 

Even beyond that, there was a time where Leonel had met three other young men of similar status to Simeon as well and he had still been able to suppress them all. 

These matters happened back when Leonel had little understanding of his own personal strength and how to properly implement them. Although he couldn't be said to be perfect now, he was definitely far beyond anything he had been before. 

Even if his strength regressed back to the point it was back then, so long as he retained his current knowledge, to say that he would easily be at least ten times stronger was actually a gross underestimation. 

This was all to say that… Simeon hadn't been impressive at all. 

Of course, his Ability Index had a great amount of potential, and Leonel had even had thoughts of stealing it using the Silver Tablet and Little Blackstar as it would be far better in his hands. But the ultimate truth was that Simeon wasn't all that impressive. 

So the question was, how could someone so clearly unimpressive have such a high status in a family that seemed so mysterious and could apparently afford to use such a talent as a patrol officer? 

There were only two possibilities. The first was that Simeon's status within the Brazinger family wasn't anywhere near as high as Leonel had previously assumed. The second possibility was that for one reason or another, Simeon was unable to display his true abilities. 

The second possibility wasn't impossible. It had to be remembered that Leonel's mother was similar in a lot of ways. 

She had spent a very long time in the Sixth Dimension, more than someone of her talent should, and this was all because Earth's evolutionary status had been a limiter for her. But the moment Earth broke free of the shackles of the Third Dimension, her potential exploded forth all at once and she became the legend she was today. 

So has something similar happened with the Brazinger family? But weren't they from Earth as well, so why was the effect so lagging? 

As Leonel was lost in his thoughts, the man before him seemed to finally realize that he was being overlooked. 

However, rather than being enraged, he simply raised a hand and pointed it forward. He would just take Leonel down first.
