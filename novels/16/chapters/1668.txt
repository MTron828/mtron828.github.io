Leonel's battle intent blazed. Everything within the surrounding several kilometer range seemed to be in the palm of his hands. Even the water was completely incapable of impeding his forward progress.  Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was an all out slaughter. The moment Leonel grew the least bit serious, nothing seemed capable of withstanding even a single strike. 

He stood tall and straight, the speed of his aiming and drawing reaching an unconscious level. Those that were watching had already felt that his spearmanship was near untouchable compared to his peers, but it was only now that they came to understand that compared to his archery, all other things fell by the wayside. 

It was like Leonel's spear was nothing more than scrap paper he used to test out and refine the ideas he had for his bow. All of his abilities seemed to be amplified by a factor of tenfold at a minimum in the presence of his bow. If it wasn't for the fact his Emulation Bow Force wasn't quite as good at emulating bowstrings, his lethality would be on a completely different level. 

Even with this being the case, with every pluck of his bowstring, Leonel found another flaw and tweaked it. What those on the outside couldn't see was that only a small part of his attention was placed on aiming and firing, with a much larger portion being focused on refining his control over his Emulation Spatial Force. 

Leonel knew that he was still greatly lacking in comparison to Thaela despite his far superior Dream Force affinity. 

He was able to mask a lot of his deficiencies because the illusion abilities of his Emulation Spatial Force were so powerful thanks to this affinity of his. However, when it came to manipulating the underlying Spatial Force, he still needed a lot of work. 

When creating something like a spear which was in line with the inherent rigidity of Emulation Spatial Force, it was relatively easier. But it was difficult to emulate the tension and flexibility of a bowstring, he even struggled quite a bit with the bow's body as well. 

While others saw a bow that looked perfect in form, only Leonel who was actually using the bow knew that it was actually handicapping his abilities. He would face the same problems if he needed to form a more flexible spear as well. 

It was possible to circumvent this entirely by using his Aurora Domain, but he felt no need to go so far just for a mere Void Tower. 

While Leonel planned on absolutely crushing the records of those in his generation, he had no plans of going so far as to expose the true depths of his strength. He had also told Aina to hold back as well. 

There were definitely individuals watching them from the dark right this moment, but they would never be able to guess at the true depth of strength they possessed, and they would be even more hard pressed to guess at what kind of strength he and Aina could display when they fought together. 

That said, Leonel really wanted to experience just what kind of power someone of the Seventh Dimension. Or, more accurately, he wanted to know what someone who had entered the Seventh Dimension with the God Path could do. 

BANG!

The ocean churned and roared. For a moment, it looked as though the entirety of its volume was rushing into the air. 

Leonel stood indifferently amidst it all, a heavy rain falling from above. But at a glance, it was hard to differentiate the drops of blue from the drops of violet, making it impossible to tell the difference between the ocean's waters and the rain of oceanic beast blood. 

Leonel took a step forward, leaving the depths of the 49th floor and entering the 50th. 

<Forty-Ninth Floor Cleared – New Record Set – Leonel Morales 00:17:23> 

…

The outside of the Void Tower was still shrouded by a deathly silence. 

Valor watched with the same cold expression. It was difficult to tell exactly what was going on in his mind. However, when it came to Conon, his heart was always worn on his sleeve. The latter's expression was so dark and gloomy that even his golden aura seemed to dim into a dark gold. 

There was simply no excuse. The Oceanic Warbeast floors were among the most dangerous for those without Water Force affinity. In fact, although it wasn't classified as one of the "drawing dead" floors, it was very close to that for many. 

And yet, Leonel had made it look easy. Even if he had a Water Force affinity, he clearly didn't rely on it, never mind the fact that most assumed that his greatest reliance was his Earth Force due to his identity as a Morales. For those of the Morales, this was the absolute worst floor to be given. 

But… he had actually set a new record. 

Quoron's own expression was quite ugly. If making it to the 40th floor meant that Leonel had earned the right to stand on the same level as them, entering the 50th meant that he had left the likes of her and the others far behind. If it was added that he was only at Tier 1, then only the likes of the Cataclysm Generation and the few monsters like Valor even had the right to meet his gaze. 

However, when Quoron saw what opponent Leonel received on the 50th floor, her heart trembled before a bit of the solemness in her heart faded. If it wasn't for the fact that she didn't want to come off as narrow minded and worried for her image, she would have started laughing uproariously. 

That said, Cornelius who was hidden high in the skies reacted much differently. 

"Oh no, please not again."

He hesitated, wondering if he should forcibly put a stop to things. 

… 

Leonel appeared in a familiar world of white, facing off against a young man who was too handsome for words. It was as though a Goddess had personally refined each and every one of features. But he only seemed to have eyes for the tree by his side and the singular golden apple that hung from it. 

After a brief moment of surprise, Leonel suddenly grinned wildly.
