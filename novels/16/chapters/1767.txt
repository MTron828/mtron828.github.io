Cross Elder Avan's expression wasn't good being questioned by a junior so rudely; He didn't expect to be placed in this situation to begin with; According to his original intentions; he would have already been on the flagship by now; teaching Leonel a lesson; He would have conveniently taken the opportunity to capture Leonel back; but now… 

"Your Imperial Highness, this man should be Cross Elder Avan of Shield Cross Stars; His status is very high; He is an Eighth Dimensional expert and he can almost make unilateral decisions in regards to the movements of Shield Cross Stars;"

At that moment, Simeon's soul construct suddenly spoke, causing Leonel's gaze to narrow even further; As he had expected, Cross Elder Avan was a true powerhouse; 

The Human Domain didn't have any Eighth Dimensional worlds; As such; any Eighth Dimensional experts usually had to use methods of restricting their own strength just to be able to stay in their homes; In addition; just crossing the barrier to the Eighth Dimension to begin with was a huge test in and of itself because it required leaving the Human Domain to succeed; 

The fact that Cross Elder Avan had succeeded not only gave him exceptionally high status among Shield Cross Stars; but also among humans in general; The human race truly didn't have many experts of this caliber; the number was less than a hundred in comparison to their population of trillions upon trillions; 

Leonel didn't bother to care about why Simeon knew of this for now, he would deal with one problem at a time. Dealing with such an expert would require his full attention. 

The first time Leonel met a Seventh Dimensional expert as a Fifth Dimensional expert himself was during his interaction with Wise Star Order; Back then; he had been entirely outclassed; Although Cross Elder Avan was restricted; there was no telling what kind of abilities he had; If not for the flagship; Leonel would have already been in his clutches; 

"Brat, I would advise you hand over the flagship and obediently hand yourself in;"

"Cap; this old man's more annoying than coach; Look at the mustache; is it a rite of passage for you legion of stick up the ass old men to all have rats on your lips?" Raj scoffed; "At least coach isn't bald; no wonder this old man's so jaded;"

Raj had no idea what had happened; nor did he understand the context; but he didn't care; Even in the worst case that Leonel was in the wrong; he would just turn a blind eye; The moment he saw that mustache; he was already having flashbacks to running sprints under the beaming sun and he lashed out; 

Leonel, who was trying to be serious, couldn't help but smile; 

Cross Elder Avan's expression turn malevolent; He couldn't' remember the last time someone had dared to talk to him like this; 

Just as he was about to say something. a swirling portal of green-gold appeared in the skies. 

Leonel's eyes widened; 

At that moment, a middle-aged man wearing robes embroidered with coiling five-clawed dragons stepped out; His hands were clasped behind his back, his expression indifferent and unmoved as he appeared before Cross Elder Avan; 

Now that Leonel thought about it. this was the first time he had ever seen his grandfather upright. let alone moving. Every time they had met. he was either sitting in meditation or seated on a throne. and the difference… it was striking. 

Emperor Fawkes' every movement seemed to cause the laws of the world to shimmer and bend, even the dragons on his imperial robes seeming far more alive. 

Without a word, Emperor Fawkes stood just a single meter from Cross Elder Avan. The difference in their height was striking with Avan being a full head shorter, although much stockier. 

Emperor Fawkes' head suddenly turned and he looked toward Earth that loomed in the nearby distance. It seemed that he was checking if he wasn't crazy. Indeed, his Imperial Palace was within sight, and yet this person had still come here, in his territory, to stir trouble. 

Emperor Fawkes' head turned back toward Cross Elder Avan. 

"Leave." Emperor Fawkes said lightly. 

His robes fluttered as he looked down toward Avan, the lack of wind seemingly not mattering in the slightest. 

"You…" Avan's eyes widened with fury. 

However, before he could speak, a blinding gold light appeared to Emperor Fawkes' back as a scroll slowly unfurled. 

"I said, leave."

The entirety of Earth's territory trembled and Leonel's eyes opened wide. In the blink of an eye, Cross Elder Avan's vanished to places seemingly unknown… And yet Leonel was absolutely certain that he was exported out of Earth's territory entire with a single spoken word.  Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

His grandfather's range of control was so large?! 

Emperor Fawkes casually turned back toward Leonel, his expression indifferent. 

"Don't you have a job to do? Get to it."

Emperor Fawkes didn't seem to care to mention the massacre of the Brazingers that had occurred just moments ago. With a step, he vanished. 

Leonel fell into silence, his expression serious. 

So Shield Cross Stars could find him if he used the flagship to kill, but that didn't change much. Somehow, the Chaotic Water Sector was able to do the same thing. The real problem was that they had methods of weakening his flagship's power output and its defenses. If they really wanted to cause issues, just handing such methods to those causing trouble in Earth's territory would make the situation far more dangerous. 

… 

Cross Elder Avan's flashed out of the void, his body sliding back in the depths of space until he came to a grinding halt. His clothing was disordered and his mustache bristled, a hint of shock in the depths of his eyes. He still couldn't quite wrap his head around what had just happened. 

This was supposed to be easy, just what had happened? 

Fury built up within his chest with nowhere to be vented. 

"Good… Good… Good… Then don't blame me, then."
