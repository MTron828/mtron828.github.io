Chapter 1257 Are You Sure?

The click of Leonel's hotel room door sounded as it closed once more. Aina's lingering fragrance still hung by his bedside.

He had already lost count of the number of times she had fed him over these last few weeks. Though he was baffled that it was taking him this long to heal, he was even more baffled by her persistence. The two hadn't even exchanged a single word in all this time, she didn't try to speak with him about anything, and it felt as though she had said all the words she wanted to say that day.

She wasn't asking for anything, so Leonel didn't even have something to reject. And, he was stuck in bed like this and hardly had the strength to lift a single finger, and clearly his mother and grandmother had some sort of tacit understanding to avoid this room at all costs. It should have been them nursing him back to health, but here he was in this awkward situation his advancement in brain power seemed to be no help solving.

"Why haven't you fucked her already? What a waste of heaven's treasures."

Leonel choked on air, some of his saliva going down the wrong pipe.

This old man only ever spoke when he initiated conversation, this was the first time he had spoken of his own accord and it completely disrupted Leonel's flow of thoughts, and he actually decided to say something like that.

Leonel didn't even participate in these sorts of conversations with his brothers. Though James had quite the vulgar mouth and never held back when explaining the dirty deeds he got up to, James and he had always had a tacit understanding that Aina was a taboo. Leonel had never tolerated anyone sexualizing the woman he had once loved more than he could describe in words.

'Once…'

Leonel winced, his migraine coming back due to his sudden jolt and coughing spree.

"… Can't you act your age for once? You're just a soul, why do you even have a libido?"

"What do you know, brat? The greatest intimacy you can have is with the soul. Sex with fleshly bodies pales in comparison to the sex I've had with some Spirituals beauties. Your scope is too limited."

"As if they would have sex with human trash like you." Leonel chortled. "Wet dreams don't count no matter how vivid they are, old man."

"Die. All I'm saying is that you're missing out. A Domain would probably only have a handful of seedlings like her. Every generation would be capped at three or four at best."

"Oh? Is she that talented?"

"What talent? I'm talking about beauty, dammit."

Leonel was speechless. Was this really a man who had lived for thousands of years? Where was the maturity? Where was the level headedness?

"I really don't know what to say…"

"Don't say anything, just do. Actually, you don't have to do anything, just lie there, she'll probably be willing to do everything. I don't know how an idiot like you could get so lucky, but I'm going to have an aneurysm if you let her walk in here without saying anything again. You don't even have to marry her, just claim the land as yours. What's wrong with you, are you even a man?"F

Leonel felt a headache coming on. He made a mental note that if he ever was with a woman in the future, he would definitely throw this old man somewhere under lock and key. This old pervert would definitely watch if he had the chance.

"I'm ignoring you."

"What do you know? It makes sense for a man like your dad to gain your mother, but what are you exactly? You need to claim her while she hasn't seen the rest of the world yet."

Leonel coughed. "Why do you keep talking about my dad like you're in love with him? There's nothing good about that old prankster."

If Leonel could see Wise Star Order's face right now, it would be bright red. It seemed he had struck another nerve, but his head was throbbing too much to notice.

"Stop changing the subject, I am being serious. How are you going to lay claim to the Dimensional Verse if you don't have a woman of that caliber by your side?"

Leonel really wanted to roll his eyes, but just opening their lids flooded him with too much sunlight. And, there wasn't much of a point if they were closed to begin with.

First this old man called his dream ridiculous, now he was talking about something completely unrelated to it.

"You're just saying stuff now. Go back to calling me an idiot."

Wise Star Order shook his head. He had been mostly joking around in the beginning, but seeing that Leonel was really so ignorant about these matters, he became more serious.

"It seems you're still too immature, brat. You're not bad at reading a person one on one, but you're lacking the ability to see things on a grand scale."

Leonel raised an eyebrow. He had the whole of Valiant Heart Mountain dancing on his palm years ago. He was just fine at manipulating emotions on a large scale, their entire organization had almost collapsed because of him.

"A beautiful woman, especially one on the level of a Generational Goddess, is more than what she appears on the surface. She's a status symbol. When men see you with her, they respect you. When women see you with her, they want to be her.

"There's no Empire created in history that wasn't built off the back of a Royal FAMILY. The people won't have trust in the Empire unless it has a lineage and a future generation. You can't build anything on that scale by yourself, you'd be naïve to think that you could."Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Leonel blinked. The old man did have a point, but that was only something to worry about after the Empire was actually built. Plus…

"Are you sure about that? Whenever men see me with her, they actually want to kill me and take her for themselves."
