The Slayer Legion units were in shock. The gorilla directly ignoring them and jumping after the boy they saw as nothing other than a scout who overestimated himself and infuriated Captain Sela was completely out of their expectations.

"Rookie!"

Gerolt and Malt's shrill cries reached Leonel, but they were simply too far away to do anything to help. Leonel was on his own.

At that very moment, Aitken and his injured squad members were taking advantage of the gorilla being distracted to retreat as quickly as they could. It became obvious that they had no intention of stepping into those muddied waters again. Even Captain Sela's life and death was unknown at this point, why would they risk themselves for a boy who was just being so arrogant mere moments ago.

To the units of the six Captains, Leonel was essentially finished. Still, the only ones who felt even the slightest shred of remorse was Captain Zhang who brought Leonel into his unit and the four squad members he had spent the last two weeks with.

Still, none of them could do anything even if they wanted to.

However, Leonel, the person in question, watched on with a cold expression.

Timing his escape perfectly, he darted forward, leaping just out of the range of the gorilla's descending hammer fists. He pulled on his chains hard, taking advantage of the heavy chariot and his own strength to sweep the chain across the gorilla's ankles and knocking it off its feet.

Leonel jumped toward the gorilla's back as it fell, wrapping the chain that bound his wrists across its neck. He pressed his knees down on either side of the beast's spine, pulling his arms back hard.

The veins of his arms bulged and the pain of the chains pressing against his wrists was excruciating. But Leonel continued to pull, wanting to break the gorilla's neck in one move.

"ROOOOOAAARRRRR!!!!"

The gorilla bellowed, trying to lash out toward Leonel's hands. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But, Leonel shifted once more. His legs moved, sliding his knees from the gorilla's back and placing the soles of his feet flush against the beast's triceps.

He stamped down hard, pulling up with his arms as though he was trying to stand up, but the chains across the gorilla's neck were stopping him from doing so.

It seemed that the gorilla was finished. The control Leonel had over its neck was commanding. If it wasn't for its sturdy body, it would have already lost its head. But, the beast hadn't given up.

With another roar that made Leonel's ears ring, a familiar silver light coated the beast's body. In that moment, the soft flesh of the gorilla's neck became harder than steel. Leonel knew immediately that it had become impossible to break its neck anymore.

'There must be a short duration for this ability, or else it wouldn't be turning it on and off like this. We'll see how long you can last!'

Unfortunately, the gorilla didn't give Leonel the time. The moment it got the slightest bit of reprieve, it rolled to its back, trying to crush Leonel with his heavy weight.

Without a choice, Leonel could only leap away. A normal gorilla wasn't even 400 pounds, so Leonel was confident in outlasting the beast. However… He knew quite well that this wasn't a normal gorilla.

After being freed, the gorilla felt a deep sense of humiliation that fueled its rage. In those moments, it had felt the call of death. It had really almost died at the hands of a puny human boy.

It rose up, lashing out with its fists toward Leonel, but the cold glint it found on the latter's face left it shivering.

Leonel yanked the chain around his wrists again. In all its rage, the gorilla failed to realize that when it had rolled to get Leonel off its back like that, it had inadvertently wrapped the chain around itself loosely. This time when Leonel pulled, it was no longer as simple as tripping it. This time, its legs were tightly bound together, causing it to fall over once more.

Leonel took hold of the opportunity, dashing to the side and picking up the two meter long broadsword Captain Sela had lost control of when the chariot went flying. It was impossible for him to use a spear properly, but it was easier to use a two-handed weapon with his hands bound like this.

By the time he brandished it, the gorilla had stood once more. Its eyes focused on Leonel with a crimson red, its snarls throwing hot air and flying spittle from its sharp canines. Its teeth glistened beneath the high sun almost like the tusks of a wild boar.

Their gazes clashed in the air before they dashed forward in unison.

Leonel didn't know how to use a sword. But, he hadn't known how to use an ax back then either. However, what he did know were two things.

First, the gorilla's attack pattern was too simple. And, secondly, its shield ability couldn't be abused. Better yet, this shield ability had just been used.

Leonel's figure was nimble. The faint shadow of the succubus spearwoman could be seen in his movements.

He flitted around like a ghost, ducking out of the range of the gorilla's fist.

Appearing to its side, his broad sword flashed forward, leaving afterimages in the air as it aimed for the gorilla's arm.

CLANG!

It chipped and rebounded off of the silver light, but Leonel's movements didn't pause. He madly circled the gorilla, dodging and striking whenever he got the chance.

The haggard breaths and enraged roars of the gorilla rang over the battlefield.

Suddenly, the silver energy shield flickered and Leonel's cold, calculating gaze blazed to life as he stepped forward like lightning.

The broad sword pierced forward completely unlike a sword. Despite the weapon in his hands being as clear as day, for just a moment, to those observing, it felt that it wasn't a sword in his hands at all… but rather, a spear.

PCHUUU

The sword shot through the gorilla's neck. It had such a wide blade that the gorilla's collarbone and forehead were pierced in unison.

Thud.

With a dull sound, the gorilla fell, leaving Leonel standing over it expressionlessly.

His unkempt dirty blond hair was kicked up by the wind caused due to the beast's fall, waving about like a flowing river. His breathing was steady and unhurried. It was almost impossible to tell he had just been through a battle if not for the dead gorilla lying before him.

The battlefield was so silent the drop of a pin could be heard. They had all watched it from start to finish, but even having witnessed it themselves, they couldn't believe it. Even Aitken felt his knees trembling. Just what had he provoked?

However, it was then that something unexpected occurred.

The gorilla began to shrink. Soon, there was nothing left but a naked man who died with his eyes wide open.
