Leonel appeared beneath the pagoda to find quite a group. In a space where no one wanted to waste even a single moment, it seemed to be completely the opposite in this region. Not only were they lingering, no one seemed to be in a rush to do anything. 

Seeing such a scene, Leonel had a feeling that he would see a repeat of what happened around the Void Tower again, but this time, it was even sadder than before. 

It could be said that the group around the Void Tower were mostly the lowest rung of the Void Tower. But anyone who could scrounge up the Void Points and Merits needed to enter this region was most definitely above average. And yet, here they were, idly wasting their time. 

Leonel shook his head and stepped forward. 

"You can wait here, I'm not sure how long it'll take, but it probably won't be too long."

Aina smiled and nodded. She didn't mind waiting. Although she wasn't a bowwoman, this was one weapon that she wasn't familiar with that she had some curiosity toward. Her instincts told her that it wasn't quite yet time to try out the bow, but there was no harm in taking a peek at something here. 

Many looked toward Leonel and Aina at this time, mostly because it was quite rare to see a woman like AIna. However, after Leonel began to walk forward, their reasons drastically changed. 

"Stop."

A commanding voice called out, but Leonel's attention was entirely focused on the pagoda ahead, a light smile on his face as he looked almost straight up. He was really curious about the illusion of this pagoda and what secrets were inside. His trigger finger was itching. 

"I said stop!"

The voice of a woman boomed, but Leonel had already made it to the entrance. Due to the fact that no one had dared approach the pagoda, Leonel faced no obstruction to this point. But when the woman saw that Leonel truly had no intention of stopping, her palm shook to reveal a crystalline bow, a pinch of fury furrowing her brows. 

She pulled her bow string and released a streak aiming right for the back of Leonel's knee. Such an injury would leave him crippled for at least a few months without extraordinarily expensive treatment methods or rare healing Lineage Factors. 

However, just when the arrow was about to cripple Leonel's mobility, the Bow Force around it vanished when it entered a certain radius. 

CLANG! 

The arrow hit against the back of Leonel's knee, rebounding into the hair without even the slightest result to show for it. 

Leonel's steps paused and he looked back, his gaze locking onto the woman who had pulled the bowstring. Considering they were all in a fairly confined area, the young woman was no more than 30 or so meters away from Leonel. At this distance, even Leonel himself would have trouble dodging the arrow of an expert archer in his base form. 

Of course, he could have dodged by calculating the trajectory of the arrow before she released it. By then, it would be a different matter entirely. However, he didn't do so as he didn't feel that there was a need to. 

The young woman was shocked. 

All archers had sharp eyes, it was one of the main prerequisites to reach their level. They all saw what happened almost too clearly, from the dispersal of the Bow Force to the fact that Leonel didn't even make a move to attempt to block. His innate defenses were more than enough to deal with the remaining momentum of the arrow. 

The young woman's heart couldn't help but beat wildly. Was that the Force Negation Ability Index? 

Usually, there weren't dividing ranks of Ability Indexes outside of the Tiers within them. By and large, two abilities at Tier 3 would both have about the same amount of usefulness. 

However, there were still some Ability Indexes that were far more sought after than others. While many might abandon their Ability Indexes in favor of their Legacy Factors or other innate abilities, there were some Ability Indexes which would be honed no matter how high your birth was. 

Force Negation was definitely one of these abilities. Fighting such a person made it feel like you were doing so with one hand tied behind your back. 

Still, after her initial shock, the young woman's expression became dark. 

"The Bow Pagoda is not an option to outsiders right now. The Bow Deity Party is currently inside, wait until they are finished."

Leonel looked the young woman up and down before turning around and entering the so-called Bow Pagoda. 

His actions left everyone absolutely stunned. Did he not know what the Bow Deity Party was and what power they held?Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Wait, it's actually him…"

The heart of the young man by the young woman pulsated. 

The young woman frowned, looking over toward him. 

"You know him?" She asked. 

"I… No, I don't know him, but I saw him in the Void Senate just yesterday. He was the one who heavily injured Treanna and Joey before somehow escaping punishment from Majority Leader Suaird."

The young woman, a member of the Tarius family who went by Lyrra, felt her heart skip a beat when she heard this. Treanna? Joey? Regardless of which of them it was, both were strong enough to crush her with a single finger, but he had heavily injured them both? 

News of what had happened in the Void Senate also flowed out in a very slow and controlled fashion, but the members of the Bow Deity Party were hyper aware of what had happened since it involved a member of their own faction. 

Now this person had actually come to their Archery Faction so boldly and openly?

A flash of rage flashed within the young woman's eyes. 

"Report this. We need to report this now."

Aina was easily able to hear all of these conversations, inwardly shaking her head. Leonel was truly very good at getting into trouble. In this aspect, he was truly unmatched.
