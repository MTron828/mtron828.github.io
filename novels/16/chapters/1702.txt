The sudden change to the list, despite the fact it was rarely paid attention on the whole, was enough for all of the Domain Ranked disciples to look at once. In that instant, the Void Library went from a quiet ambience to suddenly being forced to withstand a rushing wind. 

Their gazes sharpened, focusing on the name. When they saw the name Morales, their brows couldn't help but shoot up. 

There were four other Morales family members on the list, but this wasn't too surprising. The Morales family was the only Crafting power capable of competing against the Force Crafting Guild in terms of quality of materials output, although they had no way of keeping up with quantity. 

With the design of the Void Library, those with greater mental properties would perform better. As such, it wasn't too surprising that the Morales family would have such a showing. 

However, what shocked them was that they didn't recognize this Leonel Morales' name.  RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If the disciples below were detached from Leonel's legend, at least in the beginning, then the Domain Ranked disciples were even more so. They were disconnected from the world and only really paid attention to their improvement. 

If there was anyone or any group that they did know about, it was most definitely the Seventh Dimensional individuals of the Void Palace as they were the only ones with a chance to one day become Domain Ranked disciples. 

But what was shocking was that they didn't know this young man, so logically this could only mean that… 

Leonel wasn't in the Seventh Dimension. 

Such a realization made their hearts skip a beat. This had to be a rare genius, but to think that this would actually happen twice. That was because right now the second ranked individual on the list was another great anomaly 

Second Place – Yuri Brazinger – 81.87

Not only were the two top places women, but both happened to be two women who hated Leonel's guts. The first wasn't his fault as that could only be blamed on his father's crimes. But as the saying went… Like father, like son. 

Leonel had crimes of his own, cries that Yuri was very much aware of. 

When Yuri appeared on the scene to enter the Void Library, it was said that she managed to reach such a level of completion after just a single visit. But after this first visit, she turned around and left, never to return again. 

Others might be unaware of why this was, but the Domain Ranked disciples weren't so ignorant. 

It was said that this Yuri wasn't human, as such it was tacitly agreed that she wouldn't assimilate the knowledge of the Void Library fully and it had just been a simple exercise on her part. 

As for what the details of this were, it was completely unknown. But what was clear was that there was actually a second individual who would cause the list to change in such a short period of time. Was it that youth who had just come up before? But that was impossible, he was just in Tier 1, was such a thing even possible? 

Wait, how long had even passed since then? Even if he was a hundred times more powerful, had enough time passed? 

As they were lost in thought, the numbers by Leonel's name only continued to shoot upward. While it was only a hundredth of a percent every few seconds to minutes, a slow speed for practically anything else, for the Void Library he might as well have been moving at light speed. 

The Domain Ranked disciples watched in a stunned silence as Leonel crossed the 22% mark and increased toward 23% and surpassed 24%. 

It took hours just to complete this, and yet the gazes of the Domain Ranked disciples never moved away as though they would never tire of watching this. 

The concept of time, or more accurately, how experts experienced time once they reached a certain stage was astronomically different from others. During their practice, they gained patience that most couldn't fathom. To them, this was nothing. Even if it took days, they would be willing and able… And that it did. 

Their hearts shuddered with every step forward Leonel took. At some point, they began to look between the doors of the Void Library back to the leaderboard, seemingly waiting for Leonel to finally come stumbling out. Even for them, it took a great deal of effort just to last a few hours, so why did this Sixth Dimensional junior not seem to have such limitations? 

From a Hundredth Place to Ninetieth. From Ninetieth to Eightieth. From Eightieth to Seventieth. 

Every step forward was egregiously slow, but they were steady and unmoved by the monotony. 

Within the Void Library, Leonel had no idea what was happening outside, but what he did know was that he was inching closer with every moment. As his horizons broadened, how he saw things also began to evolve. 

However, there was a very important key missing here. 

No matter how difficult it was to assimilate the information of the Void Library, when you were given practically infinite time like the Domain Ranked disciples, why was it that even the best had only reached 83%? Could it be that those that had reached 100% left the list? Or was there something else at play here?

Unfortunately, Leonel hadn't paid much attention to the leaderboard in the first place, or else he would have long since noticed Yuri's name. As such, he wasn't in a state of mind where he even cared about such things. He was entirely focused on reaching his goals. 

So when he finally did it, surpassing first place and rocketing upward to completion, he didn't give it a second thought until, red-eyed, he stepped out of the Void Library to find several eyes locked onto him. 

Leonel stood in silence, the fatigue making his brain foggy. 

He looked around with a raised brow, but no one seemed to have an answer for him. It wasn't long, though, before he spotted the leaderboard and his brows raised.
