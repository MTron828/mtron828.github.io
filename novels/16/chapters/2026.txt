Rychard sneered. Even the unmodified Rain Beasts, at this size, were practically immune to Water Force. Let alone Water Force, because they could expel so much water at once, their defenses were nigh impenetrable. Punching them quite literally felt like punch a large ball of cotton, it wasn't just a look, it was a feature. 

There was a reason the Rain Galaxy didn't allow them to get this large. Although they were generally harmless, when they grew to a certain size they were almost undefeatable. The only real way to handle them was to take them away from a source of water and allow them to run out of water to use and manipulate, then they would become no less docile than any other domesticated creature. However, Leonel didn't even have this option. 

Just judging by the closing green pads, Leonel was obviously trying to protect this city. If he wasn't, he would be too foolish. 

If there was no one here, snatching the city core wouldn't even take any effort at all. Knowing this, how could Leonel lead the Rain Beasts away from a water source? The entire terrain was the water source. The shore was literally hundreds of kilometers away. 

Although Leonel had thought about placing the Water Lotus closer to the shore, he would be giving up its greatest ability in doing this, that being the debuff of fresh water. However, even that was ironically useless in this situation. 

It had actually taken so much effort just to rip Water Force from the tsunami wave just now. Leonel couldn't even imagine what it would take to strip them of the water inside their bodies, especially since there were thousands of them, easily. 

'There are only two explanations for this. Either these beasts have a massive weakness that I haven't spotted yet, or they were trying to be secretive.'

Leonel couldn't see how these three had only made this much progress with this kind of trump card. If Leonel had had these Rain Beasts, not only would he had not needed to expose several trump cards, he would have already claimed the entire ocean for him and would probably be making a move onto the night side continent right this moment. 

Suddenly, Leonel's gaze flickered. 'I see…'

He had found the "weakness". Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as ground breaking as he hoped. This weakness was simply that it took the Rain Beasts a great deal of time to reach this state. 

In this state, these Rain Beasts were easily worth 10 000 points each. It was likely that Orinik and Rychard had chosen to exploit the same loophole that the Lio family had and imported them with just 1 point. Due to this, they had to grow these beasts themselves, causing them to waste a lot of time. 

If this time was removed, the fastest to form a Gold-Grade territory wouldn't be Leonel, it would, in fact, be these three. If Leonel hadn't ruined their plans, they would also have been the "first" to form an Heir-Grade territory. If they had been allowed to grow undisturbed, the likelihood that they would have claimed victory in these Heir Wars would likely have been won by them. 

Leonel's lip curled, his sneer seemingly entirely displaced given the situation. 

He didn't feel "lucky", nor did he sigh in relief. He hadn't been lucky. The reason he had chosen to push forward with claiming all the seas for himself was precisely to avoid a situation like this one. This was the benefit of being proactive and knowing when to push and when to be conservative. 

As far as Leonel was concerned, he didn't feel like he was backed into a corner. In fact, he felt that there was no better time to deal with this threat. 

Leonel held out his spear just as Rychard and Orinik began to feel a bubbling rage caused by his reaction. They couldn't believe that even now, Leonel dared to look down on them. But it was then that his aura suddenly pierced into the skies. 

"[Star Fusion… King's Might]."I think you should take a look at

BANG!

A wild whirlpool formed beneath Leonel's feet. The crowding clouds above seemed to be under the same spinning force, a vortex taking shape both above and below him.  RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Leonel held out his spear and at that moment his body trembled, forming a clone, then a second, then a tenth, and a hundredth. Soon, the number of Leonels seemed to dwarf even the large army before him and they all surged forward at once. 

Orinik's gaze narrowed. "Target that location!"

He had seen this ability from Leonel before, or so he thought. The technique he had seen was one Leonel had picked up from Valiant Heart Mountain, it was nothing more than an illusion of the light. But this one…? 

A wall of water suddenly appeared where "Leonel" had stood. 

However, even after it landed, nothing seemed to happened. The other clones continued forward without dispersing, appearing around the army and attacking all at once. 

Right then, several Leonel's appeared before Orinik and the others, his spear slicing down. 

"Kill!" Rychard ordered. 

They stood upon the largest of the Rain Beasts. It was almost 20 kilometers across. Even through Leonel had "appeared" before them, he was still easily ten kilometers away. It was almost impossible to even create an attack of that scale, let alone reach them. 

The water beneath the Rain Beast shifted and surged toward the oncoming Leonels. The three didn't feel like they even had to move an inch, but what happened next left them without words. 

"[Emperor's Edict]…"

In the blink of an eye, the Rain Beast that had been almost 20 kilometers in diameter suddenly vanished. 

Those spectating blinked. But when they looked closer, they realized that it hadn't vanished. No, it had shrunk back down to the size of a palm. And as for the waters it had taken several days to absorb… 

It was hovering behind Leonel as though a miniature planet. 

Wielding it like a weapon, Leonel's slash continued, his gaze filled with a menacing light.
