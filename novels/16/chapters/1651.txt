Leonel didn't look at anyone else, an ill intent blazing in his eyes as he looked toward Treanna. 

By this point, Treanna had recovered, only to realize that her neck was already under the control of a junior. First she felt shocked, then humiliated, before a towering fury erupted forth from her in a torrent. 

She didn't seem to care that Leonel had control of her neck. As though she would rather die than not dare to struggle, her Force rose like a tempest, a violent pressure blasting against Leonel's body. 

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

The sounds of Treanna's Force rebounding against Leonel's body sounded no different from metal clashing with metal and he was even forced to slide back a measure. At the same time, the grip he had had on Treanna's throat was forced open, causing his eyes to narrow. 

Leonel had never seen anyone expelling Force from their neck like that. Could it be a method that had already existed in the Human Domain? Or was it something that she had picked up from the Zone? 

Treanna released a shrill shriek, her rage forming several green vines of Force that lashed out toward Leonel like a whip. By the time they crossed the small distance between the two, they had gone from barely formed, to a shimmering emerald. It looked as though flexible gems were lashing out toward him, each of them carrying a lethal intent. 

Leonel's gaze was frighteningly cold. 

He didn't have any intention to kill. If he had, how could Treanna have escaped from his grip so quickly? If you gained control of an opponent's neck in real combat, the battle was over. But Treanna had clearly taken advantage of his state of mind to escape. 

It only took Leonel an instant to see through this, his intent only growing colder. 

Just when it seemed that Treanna's vines would shred him to pieces, his Absolute Spear Domain suddenly manifested, a golden vortex of sharp blades rotating around him and ripping Treanna's attack to shreds. 

Leonel pressed two fingers together and pierced them forward. 

In that instant, it felt like everything in the world had come to a chilling pause. The silence was deafening. 

From a large commotion that had caught the attention of most in the building, it felt like they had suddenly entered the vacuum of space. There were no sounds of sharpening blades, no trembling walls and floors, not even the whistling wind of Leonel slicing the air in two could be heard. 

Treanna's eyes only had time to widen before her chest was pierced through. 

There wasn't a single drop of blood for several moments as she fell backward, her eyes wide. It was only after she fell to the floor that her body jolted and a pool of blood quickly formed, drenching her green dress in a tide of crimson. 

"YOU–!"

From their shocked state, the first individual rose up roaring. This man was none other than the very man who had come from Treanna's Party, a man with a bow strapped to his back. 

It wasn't at all convenient to use a bow in an enclosed space like this, but the young man was so confident in his abilities and control that he didn't even hesitate to pull out his own. All he could see was red, believing that Leonel had just killed Treanna. 

From the roar to the release of the bowstring, there wasn't even a span of half a second. There was no doubt that the drawing skills of the young man were exceptional, and it only became more clear after his Sixth Dimensional Bow Force shot a streaking light through the Void Senate hallway aimed right for Leonel's head. 

Leonel frowned, his cold gaze shifting in the direction of the young man. He had already locked eyes on him before his bow even left his back and watched the entire process of loading and firing. The young man might have thought that his speed was fast, but could it be faster than Leonel's senses? 

The arrow appeared between Leonel's brows in an instant. It almost looked as though it had teleported there from the bow it had just been released from, prepared to take Leonel's life. 

However, Leonel didn't even move. 

CLANG!

The arrow rebounded upward, rapidly spinning through the air as its Bow Force tried to continue forward without it. But the moment the Bow Force tried to harm Leonel, it was as though it had vanished into the wind. 

With the very same two fingers he had used to pierce toward Treanna, Leonel drew an arc through the air, snatching the spinning arrow out of its motion with even quicker movements. Then, in one swift motion, his back flexed and he took a small step forward. 

BANG!

The arrow rocketed out from his throw like a ball out of a canon, moving with so much speed that it didn't even arc through the air. Rather, it drew a line through the hallways, appearing before the young man in an instant. 

The arrow shot through the raised bow which was prepared to shoot a second arrow, snapped the bow string in two, before burying itself into the chest of the young man. 

The Party member coughed out a mouthful of blood in astonishment, still not quite believing what he had just seen. Had his arrow really been so casually dealt with? How was that even possible? 

Right that moment, the door to Rosen's office opened and he stepped out with a stern expression, his armless sleeve whipping in the wind beneath his aura. 

Feeling the presence of a Seventh Dimensional expert, no one dared to move even a single inch as Rosen scanned the surroundings. To think that someone would actually dare to make such commotion right outside of his office, weren't these people a bit too brazen?

When Rosen saw not just one, but two students with bloody wounds through their chests, his expression became even colder.  Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

His gaze snapped toward Leonel, an ill concealed distaste flashing in his eyes.
