"I knew it was that bastard Vanuzi. He's the only one of those pricks who thinks himself to be a scholar despite having the IQ of a pile of shit from a donkey's ass."

Adawarth's lip twitched. The world hadn't seen his father's foul mouth in too long, so they had clearly forgotten. But he and his mother were all too well aware, they could only allow the man to rant. So, Adawarth did so until Alejandro seemed to have finally run out of breath.

"We're going to have to do it anyway, dad."

Alejandro looked toward his son with bloodshot eyes as though he could swallow him whole. For a second, he saw a reflection of himself 40 years ago, back when he still had the patience to remain calm.

The apple didn't fall too far from the tree, so Alejandro knew all too well that his son had a temper no less fiery than his own. It was just that the two had bothered to learn how to control it unlike many of the others.

Even so, he felt like he wanted to take a bite out of his son's head right now even though he knew that he was correct. There were certain things that had to be done in the name of keeping the peace. If a family only knew how to move forward and never took a step back, things could easily reach a point of no return.

However, the goal of these people was too infuriating. Holding the Heir Wars no was for no other purpose than to suppress Leonel. Even Sixth Nova, Valor, had now stepped into the Seventh Dimension after so long at the peak of the Sixth. The youths of the Cataclysm Generation were also taking that step one after another.

The only one at a decidedly cruel disadvantage was Leonel.

This was infuriating on multiple fronts. For one, the Morales family had no desire to suppress one of their own. And secondly, these actions were like the world saying that his own son was inferior!

Even if he was inferior to Velasco, did his son not get a chance to at least prove himself before the world decided that he couldn't match up to the former's son? This enraged Alejandro just as much as anything else.

But even a step beyond this, it was clear that the greatest goal here, especially with the Constellation Families insisting on taking part...

Was to kill Leonel.

Even in the case that they didn't kill him, it was to at least knock him down a peg, to crush his confidence, maybe even to do him harm that he couldn't heal from, to cripple him.

This was the underlying motivation of all of this, and they were asking Alejandro to sanction it. To them, if so many families were participating at once, it would be impossible for Velasco to target all of them, not to mention the fact that it would only be the juniors participating to begin with.

Leonel's life wasn't what was truly important here, it was his connection with Earth. If a Prince of Earth became the Patriarch of the Morales family, what that meant and represented was on a completely different level than the current status quo. The Morales family would have every right to move in and monopolize the whole of Earth.

This was something the other families could not allow, and as such, Leonel couldn't be allowed to continue pressing forward and growing at his own leisurely pace.

With everything laid out like this, there was little the others could do. If the Morales family was firm in rejecting this, then the one to suffer the most would be Leonel. Those families had taken this approach for the sake of maintaining a faint veil of cordiality. If the Morales rejected, then it was just another step toward shedding all pretenses and they would have to be ready to war with the whole of the Human Domain.

"That doesn't mean we have to roll over either," Adawarth said with a smile.

Alejandro, who was already annoyed, just rolled his eyes.

"Just get to the point, you're so long winded. I swear you get it from your moÔøΩÔøΩ" Alejandro immediately stopped and cleared his throat. His eyes darted around and he only breathed a sigh of relief after he realized his wife wasn't here. He had almost forgotten himself as he lost his temper, that could have ended very badly.

Adawarth raised an eyebrow but just chuckled in the end.

"Since they want to participate, let them participate. But not as supporters, but as Heirs themselves. Since they like to think themselves capable of suppressing our family, I'd like to see what they can do when they're forced to be on a stage with us."

Alejandro slammed his palms on the table. "Excellent."

Firstly, this could be packaged as an event separate from the Heirs Wars although it would functionally still be the Heir Wars. Due to this, the hit the Morales family took to their reputation would be minimized.

Secondly, it would give the Morales family Heirs a chance to completely suppress the Heirs of the other families and crush them one by one, thus mitigating the blow to their reputation even further. In fact, there was even an opportunity to gain reputation.

And thirdly, maybe the best part of all, due to the fact these participating Heirs would have to gather up their own cohorts and supporters now, it would delay the matter for some time.

It would take them a while before they were confident enough to match up their own cohorts with that of the Morales family Heirs.

Of course, this might leave room for the Heirs to be backstabbed, so there was some risk involved. If the Morales Heirs' people weren't trustworthy enough and had ties to other powerful families, it would be easier to suddenly find yourself without any support in the end at all.FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This was a double edged sword that had to be baked into this event, or else the other families would never agree. If the Morales Heirs had all the advantages, wouldn't the rest only be appearing to be humiliated?

It seemed that during his reign, the world had forgotten to fear the Morales. In that case, Alejandro would let the juniors remind them first before the old fogies like himself stepped in.
