Chapter 2645 [Bonus] Minds

[Thanks to Ian <3 (2/6)]

Leonel wasn't ready to make an enemy out of so many monsters. Maybe if he was able to return to the Seventh Dimension, he would be willing to take such an outrageous gamble. But at least for now, he wanted to take the smarter approach if he could.

It was all in the hands of the little boy that was just a little bit too big for his age.

When El'Rion looked into Leonel's eyes, he understood much more of what he was seeing now. It felt like Leonel wasn't asking him anything. Instead... he was giving him a choice.

A choice to let Existence stay in peace for a little while longer, or if he would let chaos reign.

It didn't make sense to him again. But it also didn't make sense for Leonel to survive against that Shadow Tail. It also didn't make sense for him to survive in the True Dream World. And it also didn't make sense for him to have planned for his appearance either.

Nothing this man did seemed to make any sense whatsoever.

"What do you expect from me?"

Leonel shrugged. "That would be up to you."

El'Rion's gaze narrowed.

"... Following the Gathering of Kingdoms, an exchange of martial arts, there is the Gathering of Minds. This is a historical event and one that hasn't been held since the collapse of the Minerva Race as there hasn't been anyone else worthy of it..."

Leonel's eyes sharpened. He understood what El'Rion meant immediately.

The Gathering of Kingdoms had been commandeered as a "culling" event. Its original purpose had long since been lost, so the Gathering of Minds that usually followed after it was likewise forgotten and ignored.

After the fall of the God Beasts of Creation, the command of the Gathering of Minds had been taken over by the Minerva Race. This continued for many Generations until they, too, fell...

There were many rumours about the reason for the Minerva Race's downfall, and Leonel felt that Anastasia might very well know more about it than she let on. But what was most important here was the Gathering of Minds itself.

"... It has been a very long time since a new Creation Grade Crafter was born, and the sudden activation of the Gathering Stele to gift your wife with an opportunity is also a decent chance as well... If you would like, I can use some of my authority to trigger the start of this event for you. However, I'm not sure if it will end the way you want it to."

El'Rion didn't want to underestimate Leonel anymore, as he felt that he had done enough of that and had suffered enough mental anguish as a direct result.

However, it was impossible for someone as weak as Leonel to thrive in such an event, especially since unlike the Gathering of Kingdoms where only Mortal Races participated, the Gathering of Minds had a different precedent.

It had to be understood that the only reason the Gathering of Kingdoms only allowed Mortal Races to participate now was as a front for the culling. However, in the past, all Races of all kinds participated. Including the Gods.

If he started up the Gathering of Minds again at Leonel's request, he wouldn't have the same excuse to stop higher level existences from participating. At best, he could limit it to the younger generation.

Leonel's lip curled. "Didn't you say that no new Creation Grade Crafters have been born in a long while?"

"I did..." El'Rion replied slowly.

"Then what's the problem?"

El'Rion shook his head and Aina, who had been mostly silent all this while, couldn't help but giggle. Leonel was usually confident enough about most things, especially battle. But when it came to Crafting, his arrogance was on another level.

He had never tried to compete with anyone in Crafting, at least not normally or in any sort of formal setting before. However, his actions told Aina all she needed to know.

Right now, her husband had access to a mountain of wealth. He could have used any number of resources to trade for an outfit for her. But instead of trading for a treasure that might very well have been made at the hands of a Demi-God, Leonel preferred to Craft her military uniform himself.

This was Leonel's subtlest form of arrogance, and yet when one thought about it... it was also the one that shone the fiercest.

"..."

El'Rion's lips parted, but his words stopped again. This man was really too much.

"Also, since you're kind enough to do such a thing, I have a different suggestion.

"You can start the Gathering of Minds, request for the Owlan Race to be the host. Separate it into two portions, one that is a healthy exchange of thoughts and ideas, the second of which is a challenge section where one can challenge another when two treasures of equal value are put on the line.

"Is that alright?"

El'Rion took a breath. Leonel explained it simply, but his thoughts were layered in complexity.

For one, requesting the Owlans to host basically cut off the idea of any God participating. What God would join an event hosted by a mere Demi-God? And El'Rion nor Leonel would have to ban them in so many words.

Second, the Owlans hosting would make the Pluto Race's neutrality shine through.

What happened here today couldn't be hidden. People would soon find out that El'Rion had taken action for the Human Race.

However, if soon afterward, he announced the Gathering of Minds hosted by the Owlan Race that clearly had a grudge with Leonel, it would be the perfect balancing act.

Third, the challenge section would make the Owlans all too eager. Wasn't this their chance to make Leonel put Anastasia on the line so that they could finally get the treasure of the Minerva Race back?

Fourth, the healthy exchange that would start the Gathering of Minds would be akin to a soothing massage after the death and destruction of the Gathering of Kingdoms.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
