"Ah. right!"

Emna looked around but couldn't find the body; After a while, she shook her head, it didn't matter much; The root of the mission wasn't the body at all, rather it was twofold; One aspect was for the sake of an offensive maneuver with defensive underpinnings; The second aspect was for the information that was likely here; 

"This place is a station of Shield Cross Stars;"UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This was a simple sentence. but the instant Leonel heard them. his expression turned serious; This wasn't just because of the words themselves. but it was rather because Emna was so forthright with this information to begin with; He could imagine the amount of effort it would have taken to get this sort of information. and while it seemed that Emna had a good impression of him likely stemming from their first meeting and her interactions with Raylion and Aphestus. the fact she could give him such an important piece of information without blinking just went to show how high his place in her heart was; 

It was an odd feeling; Leonel had gotten very used to running into enemies wherever he went; There was even a point in time where he felt that maybe he had overestimated his charisma in the past; Why else could he not seem to make any friends in the Dimensional Verse? 

However; Leonel made a mistake a lot of successful people; or just people in general; really; He focused a lot on the bad and didn't spend a lot of time looking toward his back-view; While there was a trail of devastation in his wake; there was also a lot of good that he had done; 

He hadn't seen the light of hope in the eyes of Earth's Ministers just a few days ago when he returned; He hadn't seen the joy in the eyes of the citizens of the Ascension Empire when they had heard of his return; He hadn't experienced the relief they felt when he massacred the Brazinger family members in the skies; 

And these were just the people of Earth; 

There were still the remaining members of Valiant Heart Mountain whose lives he had saved; and there was still Emna who had seen him single handedly take on the Milky Way Guild that day; 

There were still the Cataclysm Generation geniuses of the Void Palace who appreciated his helping them escape the Rapax Nest; There was still Simona who cried when he returned to her beast partner; And there would still come a day where the disciples of the Void Palace learned that it was under his actions that their lives had been saved; 

There would always be people who didn't appreciate his efforts; but not every person could ignore their conscience so easily; There was bad in the world; but there was often good to be found as well; even if the latter was on a smaller scale; 

Emna had no idea that her simple words had made Leonel smile from the depths of his heart for the first time in a long while. 

Emna was so caught off guard by the genuine smile that she froze, forgetting the next words that she was going to speak; It took her a long time to recover, and by the time she realized that she had made such a mistake, she could only blush down to her chest; 

If the others of their organization could see Emna now; they would probably be stunned speechless; This cold beauty actually knew how to blush? 

Emna didn't really know what was happening at the moment either; it was just that she felt this sort of overwhelming magnetism coming from Leonel; one that even she could resist; For a moment; she even thought that it would be worthwhile to die for this man; 

What was the most shocking; though; was that unlike other charm techniques; not only was Emna hyper aware of this feeling; she didn't even feel any rejection toward it; Despite being aware that there had to be something odd going on; she still didn't feel fear or disgust; It was an incredibly odd feeling; 

This was what the four Great Families feared the most. It wasn't Emperor's Aura. nor was it Emperor's Gaze. nor was it any of the Emperor's Commandments. 

It was Emperor's Charm. 

Emperor's Charm wasn't a technique of Emperor's Might. Rather. it was a passive skill that took root as the soul of the wielder of Emperor's Might was continuously cleansed and refined beneath the Emperor Runes. The more clear and refined the soul became. the more influence the emotions of the Emperor would have on the world around them. 

When the Emperor smiled the stars would sing. When the Emperor was furious the skies would sunder. 

Just now, Leonel felt genuinely happy, a happiness that originated from the depths of his soul. Because of his genuineness, the clarity of his soul influenced Emna. 

If Emperor's Charm was in the hands of a scheming individual who hid their thoughts or never allowed themselves to feel genuine emotion, it wasn't too big of a deal. However, if it was in the hands of someone with true charisma, someone who truly cared for the lives of those around him to the point that he would find happiness in just a simple action… 

That would be the true Emperor's Might, that was what the four Great Families feared the most. 

Most of the time, Leonel's true thoughts hid behind a veil of logic and reasoning. But when they shone through, they shone fiercer than most. 

When he was enraged, nothing else mattered. 

When he was happy, he would smile, grin and joke. 

And often, because he only rarely allowed himself to feel such things, when they did occur, they were far more potent than the emotions of others. 

It could be said without a doubt that in the hands of Leonel, Emperor's Charm would unleash an astonishing might. And, after he had already assimilated one of the three supreme skills of Emperor's Might, the clarity of Leonel's soul was unprecedented.
