'What the fuck is this…?'

Leonel stood in the Palace's library; speechlessly going through star charts and not having any idea what to make of them; How could these even be called maps? They might as well have been scribbles; 

Leonel took a breath and exhaled; 'This is still alright, I'll just have to merge the knowledge I got from the Void Library with this, it won't be perfect but…'

Leonel shook his head and began to reconstruct the star charts in his Dream World; He was fast and the process only took a few seconds; Although his body looked frail currently, his soul was like a blazing star at its core; His mind was even faster than it had been before, so much so that it didn't even make sense for him to count his number of split minds any longer, and his stamina felt endless; 

It was certain that this was a product of the cleansing brought through the Emperor's Might Tablet, the largest changes occurring after he assimilated [Emperor's Command: Arise]; 

'Definitely not perfect, I'd say that this is probably only about 60-70% accurate…'

Leonel's brow furrowed. 

The Void Library definitely wasn't the best place to get up to date maps; a much better place would probably be the Shield Cross Star's main branch; Although the Void Palace did have some basic information on Sectors and Galaxies; they tended to be quite out of date; lagging years behind;  UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

By now. the problem was obvious; The information the Void Palace had was from back when Earth was still in the Third Dimension; Since then. Earth had Metamorphosized four times. and the surrounding territory had changed with it; 

Although the planets would mostly be in the same positions and such. it was hard to tell exactly which planets had shown the greatest potential and were as such targets of larger populations. as they wouldn't necessarily be the planets that had started off as the most powerful. 

Back when Earth entered the Fifth Dimension. a whole host of new planets with great potential popped up; The ones with the greatest potential were classified as such and became priority locations to defend during the war; 

Since then, Earth had undergone two evolutions and while Earth itself still had by far the greatest potential, there were countless other locations that were of great importance and were likely being fought over constantly; 

Without knowing exactly where these conflicts were, it would make it more difficult for Leonel to decide how to set up the network and make things run more smoothly; 

After a moment of thought. Leonel's gaze flashed and he thought of a solution; 

He flipped over his palm and his police badge appeared. flashing and vibrating all the while; With a thought. he sunk his mind into it and as expected. he found a log of all the calls that had been made since the creation of the badge; 

He quickly sorted the calls by frequency and then by location; Afterward. he drew circles in his created spots across locations that could be considered hotbeds and ones that were cooler in area; When he was done. he had a systematic representation of where teleportation spots were most needed; 

Now he just needed exact locations; He had to choose locations for these teleportation spots that would be hard to find, or else if others wanted to cause trouble and destroy them before he could make use of them, that would be too troublesome; 

Luckily, the number of abandoned planets and moons far outstripped the number that was in active use; It was all too easy for Leonel to find such locations and even set up measures to protect them; 

'Mm; that should be enough; It's been a while since I've gone all out in crafting; this should be fun;'

　 　

In reality; it had only been a few weeks since Leonel constructed his new Divine Armors; It could only be said that he was quite addicted to Crafting if these were still his thoughts; 

After leaving the library, Leonel looted the vaults of the Ascension Empire, taking far more than he needed without batting an eye. Then, he found a random place and entered the Segmented Cube. 

"Is everything okay?"

Leonel had only just entered when Aina's voice drifted to his ears. She had, of course, been there as Leonel was slowly losing his temper. She too was enraged, after all, Earth was also her home, so she was worried about it. 

"It should be fine, but that old man suddenly gave us a ton of work the moment we got back."

Aina raised an eyebrow. "Us?"

Leonel turned toward Aina and grinned, scooping up her small waist in a single arm. 

"Of course, us. Haven't you ever heard of "in sickness and in health"."

Aina rolled her eyes, pushing Leonel away. "I still don't see a wedding ring, you've gotten too comfortable taking advantage of me."

Leonel blinked innocently. "Don't you like it when I take advantage of you?"

Aina's head snapped up but by then, she only felt a light gust of wind as Leonel disappeared to the Lab Setting, the echo of his laughter leaving her quite helpless to do anything. 

… 

Leonel worked fast, feeling the time crunch. Every time he sensed the badge buzz, he felt an added sense of urgency. 

He became mechanical in his movements, repeating the same actions again and again, but while his soul was exceptionally robust, the weakness of his body was lowering his Finger Designation and his limbs were having a hard time keeping up. 

He pressed through it, trying to push past the plateau. Although he doubted that there was anyone who was being brazen enough to start massacres, the situation would only deteriorate from here. If he couldn't rein it in now, things would only become more troublesome in the future. 

Several hours in, Leonel was already exhausted and reaching his limits.

"What are you doing?" Anastasia's voice sounded. 

"Crafting," Leonel replied, too tired to be as annoyed as he should be by the stupid question. 

"Are you an idiot?" Anastasia answered.
