Leonel exhaled a breath. He tested the range of his elevation height again, just to see if he was locked into he same rules and quickly found out that the answer was yes. 

That much was still fine. The point of the shield he was riding on wasn't to escape, the only purpose it served was to allow Leonel to maneuver and throw at the same time. It was easier to do it like this than it would be with his wings because it could counterbalance his downward force with upward thrust. 

'The air pressure shifted, the atmosphere is different, the Anarchic Force concentration has raised…'

Leonel's mind began to calculate once more, adjusting his effective range, his throwing speed, and the output of Force that would minimize his stamina drain while maximizing lethality. 

It was all completed in the blink of an eye. Leonel zipped forward in the next, his left hand reaching for his body once against and pulling out six long needles, nestling two a piece to three gaps between his fingers. 

His gaze turned cold and the world seemed to be covered in numbers. 

His arm whipped forward, releasing all six needles at once. But through the air, it truly looked as though there were only three. They flew so close together and so perfectly that they might as well have been flying as one. However, in a blink, one had surpassed the other, zooming forward with a burst of acceleration the other simply didn't have. 

Even with this change, it looked just the same. Three streaks through the skies, each just as blinding and powerful as the other. 

They arcs through the air as one, curving through the air until they hit their targeted three different flying serpents, each right beneath the jaw. 

PENG! PENG! PENG!

The needles collided with their targets and then sprung away as though meeting steel walls. Leonel's Bow Force might as well have been a splash of water to them. However, just as quickly as this occurred. 

PCHU! PCHU! PCHU!

The second line of three needles landed in the exact same spot, skewering the flying serpents. 

However, Leonel only shook his head. With his sharp eyes, he could see that the needles had only penetrated a part of the way through, taking advantage of what had been a micro tear. But, the flying serpents were only knocked back for a moment and hardly felt the attack, let alone dying from it. 

The was part of the reason despite his skill in throwing, Leonel always gravitated back toward a bow. The effort to power output of a bow was simply on an entirely different level. He had gone all out with that throw just now, but had barely pierced skin. 

To make matters worse, in order to maximize his control of these shields and these throwing objects, he had chosen the former to be at the Fourth Dimension and the latter to be at the Fifth. Leonel obviously didn't have telekinetic abilities, he was using his Earth Variant Affinity to control these metals to do his bidding. 

If he could only throw weapons, but not retrieve them, he would very quickly run out. And, holding all of these weapons wasn't nearly as good as having a single spatial treasure that only held arrows like he had seen this damned tower provide. 

So, because his weapons were only at the Fifth Dimension, they had an even harder time piercing skin. 

Of course, the Void Tower didn't allow you to just choose weapons of whatever Dimension you wanted. But, here, the Sixth Dimension was considered 'standard'. Leonel had to purposely demote himself to maximize his chances. 

The Rapax had really done a good job of screwing him this time around. Leonel could only sigh. 

'… There's only one way… I guess I have to stop worrying about stamina and resource consumption...'

Leonel swerved out of the way of a projectile of acid, his gaze glowing. Runes began to appear within his irises one after another. First one, then two, then four, then eight. 

The space around him trembled. 

Leonel's fingers flicked backward, causing the three needles that had been knocked off course to rush back to his hands. He snagged them out of the air and threw them back with even more force than before. 

This time, however, they left a trail of crimson in their wake, a burning inferno threatening to melt everything in its path erupting. 

The three needles landed exactly where they had originally, driving into the butt of their stuck counterparts. 

There was nothing the flying serpents could do to dodge this. 

"SKKREEEE!"

BANG!

An enormous hole was ripped through their throats and out the back of their skulls. 

Leonel exhaled a light breath, steam pushing out through his teeth and lips, red flickering within his irises. He had already pushed himself to the limit once today and managed to use <Instantaneous Recovery> to get back on his feet. But, since then, he had fought a battle with Amery, then used several hours to draw an array back to the Human Domain. 

With the current state of his mind, sustaining eight Destruction Runes was a tall order. And, it only made it worse that once he used it, the object he had used it on would be finished and vanish for good. 

Leonel had a few hundred throwing knives and objects, but facing beast hordes, he didn't know if it would last even three more floors, and he still wasn't sure exactly how far he had yet to travel. 

But facing this opportunity, there was only one real path to take. He had to go all out. 

Leonel's chest heaved, the daggers he plucked away from his hip already glowing a fiendish shade of red before he even finished imbuing them with his mark.  Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

'You annoying spitting snakes put me in this situation, come die then.'

Leonel unleashed a barrage of relentless assaults, razing everything to the ground. There was nothing elegant and beautiful about his efficiency any longer. He saw a target, and he destroyed it from the inside out. Nothing more, nothing less.
