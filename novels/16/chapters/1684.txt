Leonel felt like he currently saw the world like a row of dominoes. He could spot a change in one location and watch the chain of results that would end in a completely random location, one that could be hundreds of meters away from the original location, or even end in the same exact spot it started.  Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The feeling was novel. It almost felt as though he was reading a book filled with tropes, so much so that each ending was so obvious that he could predict it so long as he read a page or two. 

The entire world had suddenly become like the pages of a book, a feeling that ironically took the third-dimensional vision he had just gained and concentrated it back into the two-dimensional. But this time, rather than flattening the image, it just made his sight transcend to a different level entirely, a level that made reading the chains of cause and effect feel no different from reading the lines of a novel. 

Everything stacked together into one, layers of images being stitched together into a beautiful tapestry that read no different from a timeline of events. Every time Leonel reached the end of this timeline, his heart would hitch as though what would happen next was lingering on the tip of his tongue, as though he was just a measure away from peering into the secrets of a timeline that was beyond what he had and was experiencing… transcending into a timeline that he had yet to experience. 

Leonel stood in silence for a long time. It was obvious to him at this point where this was going. In fact, if this was the core of the Bow Domain Lineage Factor, it was no wonder that his talent with the bow was so high. 

When it came to reading events and predicting the most likely outcomes, there were very few in existence that could match him in this regard at the same strength level. There might be some old monsters out there with a Dimensional Tier far beyond his own that had far greater control over such things, but Leonel was quite certain with all things being equal, there were probably very few people that could match him in this regard. 

If the evolution path of the Bow Domain Lineage Factor was like this, then a lot of things made more sense. When it was fused with Leonel's Ability Index, it made it feel like he was reading the mind of the universe, watching its pages slowly turn. 

Leonel had a feeling that if his sight could encompass the whole of the universe, there would be nothing that he couldn't see through. But this was just a fleeting thought. Even someone of the Ninth Dimension wouldn't be able to do such a thing. The expanse of the universe was far too large. Even covering just a single solar system all at once was probably impossible, let alone a galaxy, and most definitely not a Sector, Domain or entire universe. 

Still, this made Leonel wonder. Just how many people had made it this far? How many of them had the eyes he had right this moment? Or, more importantly, how many had awakened the Bow Domain Lineage Factor from birth? 

Leonel's gaze couldn't help but flicker. 

This Lineage Factor in the hand of a true talent would be extremely fearsome. It taught him one very important thing… There were still things in the Dimensional Verse that he shouldn't dare to underestimate. 

It would be foolish of him to believe that he was the only one to have ever benefited from this pagoda. There were definitely others, and there might be many of them. 

He had come here blindly, but there were those who might have already benefited from understanding inklings about it ahead of time. There might even be some techniques that can replicate a portion of the abilities of his partial Bow Domain Lineage Factor. 

Thinking to this point, Leonel smiled and relaxed. 

He was a victim of something very human just now: anxiousness and greed. He worried about others benefiting from something he would have liked to monopolize, but what good was that selfishness right now? 

For Leonel, this feeling was a bit new as well. He could feel himself changing ever since he made that choice to take Aina over the world. 

It wasn't just that, but it was a subtle difference that also resulted from the Emperor's Might Tablet. That said, between the two, it was obvious that the former was more important while the latter was merely supplemental. In fact, Leonel had a feeling that had he not made that choice, he wouldn't have been able to command the tablet to come to him…

Whether these changes were good or not, he didn't know. But what he did know was that he would make this choice again no matter what happened from here on. 

Almost nothing was worth Aina in his eyes. 

'Now that I know your secrets, do you think you can stop my steps?'

A grin spread across Leonel's face. He hadn't let the weight of the world stop him once before, so how could a measly tower others had already climbed stop him? 

He stepped into the eighth floor, raising his bow, his eyes flashing with a glass-like light. 

From the eighth floor to the twelfth, he didn't pause a single moment, his bowstring constantly vibrating. 

The twang of his bowstring and the resonating cry of his bow echoed again and again, stacking atop of one another without pause or rest. 

The youths on the outside could only watch as the Bow Pagoda slowly grew from the eighth floor, to the ninth… and then the tenth… and then the eleventh… 

The pagoda trembled wildly, a resplendent pulsing light shooting up into the skies. 

This was a scene that happened all too rarely, a scene that hadn't been seen in just over a decade, a scene that happened a rare few times every century. 

But this time, it was very different… This time, it wasn't a member of the Bow Constellation Alliance, but rather… a member of the Morales family.
