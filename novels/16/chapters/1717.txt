As good as his body felt, Leonel felt as though his mind had entered a state of absolute peace. It was beyond just the feelings, but rather the tacit acceptance that had brought him to this moment. 

He had been by Aina's side for so long and he had already lost count of the number of opportunities they had had. However, because he was in his own head about so many things, it was always easy to find an excuse, and to also find contentment in what he had without trying to seek more. 

After he had made his decision that day, he no longer had any inhibitions. He had already known that when next the two of them had this chance, neither of them would be willing to miss it again. 

It wasn't a moment of ravenous passion, nor was it emblazoned with emotions like it had almost been so many times before. Rather, it was calm and intimate. They listened to the sound of each other's breathing, they enjoyed the warmth of each other's embrace, and they were both very much present. 

It could only be really explained in one word: comfortable. 

There wasn't any pressure on their shoulders, any obligation to act, any fear dictating their actions, or any ulterior motives tainting their thoughts. It couldn't have been any purer. 

They smiled, they kissed, they even laughed, neither feeling any tension or oppression. Both just seemed to understand how beautiful the moment was. 

It wasn't perfect. They didn't have fireworks in their air, they were currently on the run as fugitives and there were probably no small number of individuals who wanted them dead, and yet it all didn't seem to matter in the slightest. 

… 

In his state of bliss, Leonel suddenly felt his knees go weak. 

At first, he thought the worst. In reality, by this point, it had only been a few minutes. Within his abilities, he knew exactly how long. 183 seconds, not a second more, not a second less. Three minutes and three seconds. 

If he collapsed now, he wouldn't ever hear the end of it. Considering his dense vitality, he would be up and at it immediately, but he knew what kind of woman he was dealing with. She wouldn't actually take it to heart, but that didn't mean that she wouldn't be sure to make fun of him to the ends of the earth. 

Leonel found it all to be ridiculous. Sure, it felt like his cock was in a vice grip of warm and moist clouds as though he was being caressed by the hands of an angel, but he also had a Tier 4 Control Ability Index that gave him perfect control over his body. So long as he wanted to, he should have been able to go on for months if that was what he wanted. 

But what the fuck was this?

This scare had only lasted for a fraction of a fraction of a second before Leonel realized that this wasn't actually what was happening and that he wasn't a quick shot. But it was already enough for him to be covered in a cold sweat. 

"Leonel?"

It was only a small moment, but considering how close they were, how could Aina miss any changes to Leonel? Those gorgeous cherry lips of hers were already curled into a smile as she whispered a hot breath into his ear, the vice grip her moist walls pulsating around him. 

Leonel knew that she was doing it on purpose. He and Aina had a tacit sort of agreement. They were still stuck in the beauty of the moment, but very soon, it would likely devolve into an all out war of conquest for bragging rights. 

Aina lightly bit at Leonel's earlobe, running her hands up and down his defined back as she locked her legs around him. Her voice seemed tinged with "concern", but in reality she was coercing him like the little vixen she was.  Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

'Dammit…' 

Leonel couldn't even counter because of the weakness in his legs, his arms were the only things stopping him from flopping on top of her like a dead fish, and Aina seemed to have noticed this. 

Leonel didn't even know how to explain that what she thought was happening wasn't actually what was happening. It felt like that time she walked in on him moaning all over again, he would never live this down. 

Another squeeze came and Leonel sucked in a cold breath. He couldn't quite focus on exactly what was happening with her, tempting him at every opportunity. He had already locked away most of his mind to man to planetary warship, so he didn't have much focus left to give given the situation, which only made him even slower in understanding what was happening. 

Aina's hips wiggled, pulling back and sinking herself into the bed before rebounding upward. She didn't seem to want to let Leonel off at all as she used her own methods to force them into another rhythmic trance. 

Her light moans tickled at Leonel's ears as an odd feeling spread through his body. Leonel couldn't describe it as anything other than weakness. He lost control of himself piece by piece as though he was being forcefully separated from something, or maybe it was the exact opposite. 

From his feet, up his legs, through his knees, then his back, and eventually even his hands. By that point, the only things propping him up collapsed. 

Aina laughed lightly, still a bit oblivious to what was happening. 

Red in the face, her overwhelming strength easily flipped Leonel beneath her. Her thighs trembled as she rose in a squat, a feeling of euphoria coursing through both of their bodies as she slowly moved up and down. 

At the same moment, the feeling rose to Leonel's head and he felt a pop. 

Right then, the sound of a chain snapping resonated through the universe and Leonel entirely lost control of his body. 

Aina trembled, feeling a strong pulse within her. She leaned forward, pressing her cheek to Leonel's broad chest with a light smile on her face and a sheen of sweat on her brows.
