"I'll give you one chance; Leave now or I'll kill every last one of you;"

Leonel suddenly spoke for the first time and a sudden vacuum seemed to form beneath his presence; Every single Brazinger family member suddenly felt that they had been locked onto as Leonel slowly took out his bow; 

He didn't seem to be in a hurry at all as he knocked a single arrow; closing his eyes as he hovered in the skies; 

The current state of Leonel's archery was greater than it ever had been before, and it was more than just because of his fragmented Bow Domain Lineage Factor or even the improvements to his Bow Force; It was entirely due to the fact that he was one against using real arrows instead of Force forged arrows; 

In the past, Leonel couldn't justify spending hours to even days Crafting arrows; At best, if he really cared, he might Craft one or two that could be used in a pinch as an ultimate sort of trump card, but otherwise, it was better to use bows that had an auxiliary effect of forming Bow Force arrows; 

This ultimately weakened his bowmanship somewhat; Many would assume that the bow was the more important part of an archer's arsenal, but there were many schools of thought that treated the arrow as an asset that was just as important; 

Leonel was of the belief that this was nonsense; but that didn't mean that he didn't understand the kind of deterrence and boost powerful arrows could have; It wasn't just a small boost either; His power as a bowman would easily double; 

It could only be said that the Brazinger family members who were still readying their charge had no idea what they were getting into; They didn't heed Leonel's words and they would suffer for it; 

The current Leonel didn't have to painstakingly Craft every single arrow; He only had to forge a single one; and now; even while he wasn't paying any attention to it; the Segmented Cube was mass producing arrows of top tier quality at a rate he simply couldn't match; 

As Leonel raised his White Lion Bow; a resplendent white gold arrow trembled in his fingers; swirling with powerful strands of Sixth Dimensional Bow Force; 

At that moment; the head patrol officer who had come to deal with Leonel felt his heart skip a beat; 

Let alone taking Leonel's words seriously; he hadn't even hesitated to move forward with the charge; The backline of spaceships were gearing up their canons in case they were needed while the frontline spaceships all opened; a flood of patrol officers strapped with flying treasures soaring toward Leonel; 

However, the moment the head patrol officer met Leonel's cold gaze, a deep sense of regret gripped his heart. 

TWANG!

The arrow appeared before his forehead in the blink of an eye; accelerating not just once; but three times through the air; Every blast left devastating in its wake; sending shockwaves in all directions and even causing several patrol officers who got too close to its tail wind to explode into a rain of blood; gore and metallic pieces; 

PCHU!

The head of the head patrol officer was pierced through by a hole so tiny and small that it wasn't noticeable at first glance; In fact, for the long while of silence that followed it, it didn't even bleed as though it wasn't there at all; 

But then… 

BANG!

The head patrol's officer's skull seemed to implode; In his final moments; his shock was etched onto his face; but he was entirely incapable of reacting; Just like that; a genius that could have made a name for himself in the Void Palace vanished from the world with a single arrow; 

By the time all of this had happened; though; Leonel had already nocked another arrow; then another; 

To say that it was a massacre was an understatement; Leonel didn't even move a single step nor did he seem to strain or struggle; Every arrow he released; no matter how hard their targets tried to dodge; seemed to end up right at the center of all of their forehead; 

"Charge the canons! Prepare to fire!"

The command structure of the Brazinger's didn't collapse and another stepped in right away, relaying orders and barking out with their Force to protect it. 

But as soon as they spoke, Leonel's arrow split their head open as well. 

Leonel flipped his palm and a radiant crimson arrow appeared, etched with ancient and oppressive runes. Even before it was nocked, the temperature of the surroundings seemed to skyrocket, almost as though the sun had suddenly moved an entire half the solar system closer. 

"Die," he said lightly. 

Leonel nocked and released. 

The arrow appeared before a spaceship ready to fire in the blink of an eye. It tore through its hull as though it was made of aluminum and then exploded.  Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The skies about Earth and the Moon turned blinded as a chain network of fireworks was set off one after another. 

Leonel didn't show the slightest hint of mercy. In fact, he destroyed their spaceships so thoroughly that even the bits and pieces that survived would burn to ash long before it could fall through Earth's atmosphere and hit the surface. 

Compared to the boy who struggled to kill a single young girl just six years ago, the current Leonel didn't even feel his heart fluctuate. His singular warning was all he cared to give them. Since they didn't listen once, he would send a very clear message. 

His grandfather had other worries that didn't allow him to act, but he, Leonel Morales, didn't have such scruples. He was already kicked out of the frontier of humanity, he was already a Tier Two Fugitive of the Human Domain, he was already out of patience. 

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 

The flames reflected in Leonel's irises as he watched with a hint of coldness within his gaze. 

He didn't know how the Brazinger family would react to this, but he hoped it would be foolish. That would give him more than enough reason to slaughter more of them. The debt of his mother-in-law had to be paid somehow.
