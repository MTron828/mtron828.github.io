Leonel and his brothers looked up all at once. their expressions turning cold all at once. 

Leonel was immediately infuriated; His brothers had just come back to him, and yet instead of having some time to catch up, some fool who didn't know better was already threatening them; There didn't seem to be even a single moment of rest for him; 

The six brothers' gazes met and they all shot toward the outside of the flagship all at once, nothing really caring about their clothing; Even the most clothed among them, Leonel, was practically naked given the ragged state of his clothing; None of this, though, was able to slow their steps; 

When they made it outside. Leonel's pupils constricted; 

The Force barrier protecting the flagship was already in a heavily damaged state; seemingly just an attack or two away from collapsing entirely; In the skies; an old man with a fluttering mustache; Just seeing him; Leonel felt his heart palpitate; This man was the strongest existence he had ever been so close to; The difference was so large that it felt as though an oppressive mountain was weighing down on his shoulders; 

However. even while Leonel was thinking this. the expression of Cross Elder Avan was incredibly ugly. It should have taken him only a single strike to pierce through the barrier. but he had already attacked twice and yet it was still up. what the hell was going on? 

Of course. in order to enter Earth's territory. Avan had to suffer a suppression of his strength. after all. he wasn't an Earthling. nor was he born in any of the territories it had recently swallowed up; However. Shield Cross Stars had failsafe measures to deal with situations like this; 

The badge on his hip currently was designed to directly shut down the flagship and strip its control away from Leonel; With this badge. it should have only taken him a single strike to pierce through its defenses and the attacks of the flagship would be useless against him. and yet things had clearly not worked out properly; 

Cross Elder Avan realized at that moment that if the badge didn't work on the Force barrier, then didn't that mean that it wouldn't work in protecting him against the flagship's attacks as well?  Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Leonel's gaze narrowed. his fragmented Bow Domain Lineage Factor immediately activating as he locked eyes with the badge; He noticed its oddities almost immediately; 

Leonel had seen through a lot of the counter measures of Shield Cross Stars and he had undone them all, or so he thought; The fact a single Seventh Dimensional existence could crack the Force barrier like this must mean that his counter measures weren't as perfect as he thought; 

'The energy core!' 

Leonel immediately deduced the issue; He had turned the entire flagship on its head and he had a perfect replica of each one of its individual parts down to the small bolt; There was only one location where such a counter measure could possibly be hidden, the nuclear fusion core!

Toward this, Leonel was helpless to do anything; Modifying that region was too dangerous; 

'There a chance that this old man has more strength than what he's showing as well. and if that's true…'

Leonel's expression turned cold and he waved a hand; In that moment. the number of clones he had in the flagship more than tripled; In an instant. the canons aimed in the skies and pulsed. prepare to fire; 

"Fuck!" 

Cross Elder Avan's eyes widened. 

When he heard that Leonel was able to precision aim the canons of the flagship to target individuals on a one person scale, he had found it ridiculous; The flagship was designed to aim at other warships, asteroids and planets, the margin for error was too large to think of aiming for a single person; Doing so was like trying to use a blow dart to kill a fly from a hundred kilometers away; 

Such a level of precision was simply impossible, especially not when the target could move. 

So why did Avan suddenly feel the scent of death? 

BOOM!

The canons unleashed and Cross Elder Avan roared, slapping his palms together and allowing a tsunami of Force to envelop him from all sides. 

Leonel's gaze narrowed. This was the same Ability Index that Milan had, the Energy Shield Ability Index. But at this level, it was a completely different monster. 

BOOM!

The man was swallowed whole by the beams of blinding light as the starry skies illuminated. 

Leonel's eyes narrowed. 'The power is only 10% of what it should be. As expected, the core of it all is in the nuclear fusion core, it's been compromised. Somehow, the energy that comes from it is being mutated, disallowing it from harming those with that badge. If not for the modifications I made, it wouldn't have even have 10% left.'

As the beam cleared, Cross Elder Avan appeared, shielded behind a mighty Force barrier that almost looked corporeal. It floated with Runes dancing across its surface. It truly seemed as though it was alive. 

Cross Elder Avan's fiery temper threatened to spill over, plumes of fire flickering within the depths of his eyes. 

His barrier quaked slightly, but there wasn't a single crack on it. It was clear that he had weathered its strength without much issue. If not for him being caught off guard by the rumors being true, he wouldn't have been flustered in the first place. 

However, in the time it took him to form his defenses, the cracked barriers of the flagship had recovered. 

Leonel stood with a cold expression, his mind churning. He didn't actually believe that his father's threat would give him some omnipresent and omnidirectional protection, however he was still somewhat shocked that someone would dare to attack him so openly like this, and especially while he was so close to Earth. In addition, this person seemed to be from Shield Cross Stars, how bold. 

'Something's changed, there must be something this person is relying on. If not, why not just use the Patriarch of the Chaotic Water Sector to find my location and use that badge to take me out much earlier, why wait until now? Unless…'

"Who the hell are you?" Leonel asked coldly.
