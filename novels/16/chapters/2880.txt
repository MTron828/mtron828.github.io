Chapter 2881 Impulsive

Leonel's smile almost felt like the smile of a devil in their eyes. It felt like they were staring into the maw of the abyss, his presence making their hearts unwittingly palpitate.

Staring into his eyes, it felt that from the very start, he had their hopes and dreams in the palms of his hand.

It didn't make sense for him to be so calm and unhurried, for him to carelessly come into the location they were the absolute strongest in just to snub their noses. And yet, feeling his confidence, they realized without taking action that there was little they could do to change things, even if they wanted to.

They realized that this boy had already grasped onto their weakness, and the situation was entirely under their control.

"What do you want?"

This time, it wasn't Lady Emberheart who spoke. It was the old lady of the two Ancestors.

There were many things about this that they didn't understand, especially since they were hardly the only Spiritual Race Bubble.

Even if they didn't go to the Moonstone Bubble because of the dead prince, wouldn't it be easier to help one of the weaker Spiritual Bubbles to rise up?

The Emberheart and Moonstone families were the two strongest of the Spiritual Race. They were likewise the most difficult to control as a result.

If Leonel had gone to a Spiritual Bubble with only one or two Creation State experts, with such a technique in hand, couldn't he help them to rise up quickly and hold all the cards in his hands at the same time?

By the time anyone realized what was happening, the situation would already be far too late to change.

Of course, they had no idea that Leonel was the one to kill the Moonstone Prince, even to this day. They didn't even know that Leonel was the one who helped the Dwarven Race impersonate the Emberheart little Princess.

At most, they had some guesses that they couldn't confirm.

Even so, the rest was still a problem.

Was Leonel really so confident in keeping them in line?

When they remembered the power he had been about to display earlier, they couldn't help but shudder. Was that really so farfetched?

"What do I want? You may call yourselves Spirituals, but you are Humans. Isn't it only natural all Humans be under a single banner?"

"Led by you?"

"And who else?" Leonel smiled.

Looking at Leonel, they couldn't find it in them to refute. Indeed... who else?

A child of not even 30 years old was already capable of having a Creation State Force. This was practically unheard of.

Not only that, but he had defeated their best without displaying his strongest strength.

However...

He was arrogant, impulsive, and was bound to get them into trouble they might never be able to extricate themselves from.

The old lady slowly shook her head.

"If the cost of the technique is to fly beneath your banner, the Spirituals will have to refuse. You will lead us to ruin."

She spoke candidly, as only a person uninterested in the remainder of her life might. She had lived a long time and seen many things...

Also, it wasn't like this was all the Spiritual Race had. Didn't they also have several Gods?

Of course, these Gods weren't able to interfere in their matters and could objectively be considered to be an external power now, but so what?

Was a Bubble that had produced many Gods supposed to submit to a child?Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

And even if they did, with Leonel's talent, how long would he be able to stay here? Even if by some miracle he changed his ways, was no longer as impulsive, and led them to victory after victory, so what?

When he left, wouldn't they be right back to square one? And by that point, how many people would he have offended?

Even if one said that the technique would be able to bridge that gap, what about the unrest? There were no Races in all of Existence that truly flew under a single barrier. There would always be naysayers and opposers.

How would the Ma'at Bubble react to suddenly knowing that Leonel was their leader?

Would this impulsive boy have any propriety when it came to this? Or would he just start killing anyone who ignored his words and authority?

And even if Leonel really did change, once again, how would cooperation work? Once they got their hands on the technique, if Leonel could only lead them from the shadows, what reason would he have to trust them?

They certainly wouldn't trust someone else in this way, and they knew Leonel was smart enough not to, either.

No matter how you spun and flipped this matter, it didn't make sense from any angle. It was as though Leonel was just messing around once again.

Plus... they had their own reasons for hiding their identity as humans, reasons that ran deeper than just wanting to avoid the ire of the world.

How could it be that no one knew that the Spirituals had such a past? What had it taken to obscure such a thing? And in the case of those who knew, how was it that they had kept them silent?

This matter wasn't as simple as it seemed on the surface, and it only made them think that Leonel was all the more ignorant and na√É¬Øve to suggest such a thing.

He was ultimately too young and too impulsive... just as the old Ancestor had said.

However, Leonel only gave her a glance.

"Impulsive?"

Leonel stretched out a hand and they all froze, thinking that something bad was about to happen. They were already used to Leonel lashing out.

But what happened instead made their eyes open wide.

A tablet, radiating with pink, violet and sky blue diamonds, appeared, exuding an ancient aura that played on their hearts.

Leonel didn't need to say another word.

The appearance of the Life Tablet spoke volumes.
