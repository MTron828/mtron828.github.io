Leonel met the Spiritual's gaze silently for a long while. 

The distance was simply too far away, he couldn't tell anything about the latter's strength or power, but his intuition told him everything he needed to know. This young Spiritual was powerful, probably far more powerful than anything the current Leonel could properly fathom. 

Leonel sent another gaze toward the ring on the Spiritual's finger before waving a hand, allowing the image to vanish. At the same time, he felt the gaze of the Spiritual also vanish.  𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Before this, Leonel wasn't very obsessed with the Bow Domain Ring. The greatest use the Spear Domain Ring had to him was providing weapons and teaching him the way of the spear. But currently, he felt that his own bow was already good enough and would be for a long while. As for teaching him the way of the bow, he was too confident in his own abilities to care much about it. After all, he could form Seventh Dimensional Bow Force whenever he wanted. 

But this experience piqued his curiosity. He was very much interested in getting his hands on that ring now. Unfortunately, it seemed that it would take quite some time and effort to reach that point. There wasn't much he could do about it. 

For now, though, he was content. The pieces of the Bow Domain Lineage Factor were very useful to him, it almost made him consider the Spear Domain Lineage Factor to be quite useless. Truthfully though, the Bow Domain Lineage Factor just matched better with him. 

The Spear Domain Lineage Factor did help Leonel a bit. It gave him a stronger and more robust body. It also allowed his Spear Force to be a measure stronger than if he didn't have it. After all, there was a reason his Spear Force was gold instead of the normal colorless to white Spear Force others had. 

However, compared to the synergy he had with the Bow Domain Lineage Factor, it was akin to night and day. 

In the hands of someone else, the Bow Domain Lineage Factor would be quite lackluster. Ultimately, it just helped you see further, see more, and witness fast events at a slower rate. If you lacked the ability to process these things and react fast enough, what use was it? In fact, to most people, the Bow Domain Lineage Factor was just a somewhat weaker and more limited form of Internal Sight. 

Only when it was in the hands of someone like Leonel or an extremely talented archer would it display its true strength. 

Still, Leonel slotted this matter in the back of his mind. He wanted to see if there was anything he had missed with his Spear Domain Lineage Factor. 

If Leonel was correct, while the Bow Domain Lineage Factor relied on the eyes to display its strength, the true strength of Spear Domain Lineage Factor was found in two words… 

Controlled Range. 

It was only upon understanding these two words so long ago that Leonel's Spear Force was able to break through its shackles, and it was also because of these two words that his Absolute Spear Domain formed as a layer of protection for him in battle. 

The key to the bow was in its effective range, but the key to the spear was in dominating a sphere of influence on a battlefield. 

'Interesting… Maybe if I enter the Spear Pagoda it'll be more obvious. The Bow Domain Lineage Factor is so clear to me now precisely because I understand the bits and pieces that form its foundation, but I was immediately given the Spear Domain Lineage Factor… I'll consider it.'

Leonel stepped outside of the Bow Pagoda, feeling the brightness of the artificial sun on his skin. Standing there, the glassy look hidden deep within his irises sparkled like a white crystal, radiating a rainbow of colors. 

With a thought, Leonel's vision adjusted and his focus returned, finding an enormous crowd of individuals standing before him. Among them, there was a familiar trio in Mallael, Craes and Kysen. 

Those around them had respectful expressions. Clearly, they were among the few who were just beneath those right under the Cataclysm Generation. This was apparently enough for them to garner a ton of respect although they could hardly make it to the fourth floor. 

Of course, this wasn't necessarily true. Because of Leonel, the target of the Bow Pagoda changed and the difficulty increased to coincide with the minimum requirements for distribution of the Lineage Factor. As such, they suffered defeat far earlier than they usually did. 

Unfortunately, that truth did nothing to help them feel better. 

Leonel directly ignored them and scanned the crowd until he found Aina who was seemingly enjoying the show. He could only shake his head, he definitely had to teach this beauty a lesson later. Where was her sense of protection for her future husband? 

Leonel's took a step and flickered and vanished, catching the crowd off guard. They had originally wanted to see how he dared to walk out of here, but when they caught sight of him again, he had already flashed by them all, appearing by Aina's side. 

"Come on, there's nothing fun here anymore."

Aina smiled and shook her head. How was leaving here going to be so easy? 

At that moment, a looming aura appeared to Leonel's back. He was a very skinny man, but he was still over a head taller than even Leonel. 

Across his chest there was a bow that was maybe the longest Leonel had ever seen, standing at least three and a half meters from tip to tip across its curve. 

The young man was pale but there was a deep darkness around his eye sockets, almost to the point it looked as though he had drawn around his eyes with a dark black marker. 

These sunken eyes of his, though, were incredibly sharp, sharp to the point that most shuddered just looking into them. 

This young man was one they all knew quite well, Erlan Tarius, the younger brother of Nazag.
