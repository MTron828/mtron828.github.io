Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Leonel's body swayed and suddenly vanished into a stream of mist. He looked like an image dashed away by rushing waters, floating away and into the wind as though his body had lost all of its form. He didn't even bother to respond to Anya's words, the response she received was a danger sign tingling up the length of her spine.

Anya's expression became unprecedentedly serious, a familiar twin pair of horns appearing on her forehead. There was no doubt that this was the Death Pulse Deer, the highest Lineage Factor provided by the Silver Tablet of the Dark Side of the Northern Star Lineage Factors. However, Leonel had already seen it once before... He was entirely unmoved.

BANG!

A scythe appeared in Anya's hands, barely blocking Leonel's fist. Even so, she took a strong step backward, her wrists trembling. She felt as though her arms might collapse beneath the strain at any moment, but just when she wanted to use Force to stabilize herself, it vanished into thin air, Leonel's fist stripping it from her scythe's body.

Her body lost control of itself and she was sent flying back. The expressions of the Scholars that had formed a circle froze. Anya was the greatest genius of their Three Finger Cult, they had never expected for such a thing to happen in just a single exchange.

Leonel appeared above Anya, his gaze as cold as an abyssal hell. He didn't seem to see the gorgeous features revealed under her fluttering veil. If he couldn't crush this woman, what right did he have to think about helping his father? He felt that she should just die.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

BANG!

Leonel's fist descended. Anya tried to block again, but it was entirely worthless. Leonel's arm deformed, countless arms growing out from the right side of his body in a truly grotesque sight. But regardless of how impure and gut-turning it was, what it was most definitely was effective. He didn't care about looking pretty, he only cared about destroying this woman before him.

Anya's scythe couldn't even begin to block them all. Her body was barraged by a rain of fists, each one more powerful than the last. Her body's clothing was torn to pieces, her bones breaking and her limbs shattering. Before she even hit the ground, she was beaten to a bloody pulp.

Leonel flexed his fists and they vanished one by one until just a single arm was left. Wasting his Dream Force on creating elaborate, reality-warping phenomena was just a waste of stamina. Since he could bend reality with his Dream Force now, he would use it in a way that fool Lionel had never considered.

He stepped through the void, his body appearing above the beaten and broken Anya. He rose even higher, his fist raising above his head and multiplying to several times its original size. It wasn't just a cosmetic change, but rather a multiplicative effect, one that twisted space and dispersed Anarchic Force.

"Die."

His fist descended, falling like a meteor from the skies. Sparks of flames flew, a cocoon of wind forming around it as it shot downward. Anya could barely see straight, but in the final moments, her finger barely twitched, two more figures appearing from within her ring. One moved quickly, appearing before Leonel's fist and crossing his arms.

BANG!

Leonel's arm trembled for a moment before it suddenly exploded. His bones shattered to pieces, his blood and flesh falling like rain from the skies above. The destruction was so devastating that in one moment, his fist seemed to cover the skies, and in the next, he was left with nothing more than a shoulder stump overflowing with rivers of crimson blood.

Even so, Leonel's gaze didn't shift in the slightest. One might have thought that it wasn't his arm that had just been torn to pieces. The second figure that Anya had manifested pressed her hands together and cast a light over Anya before quickly disappearing. It was clear that she didn't trust herself to remain safe, so after healing Anya, she vanished, not staying behind for even one moment later.

Leonel only took note of this as Anya stood. Without any more hesitation, he took out his bow as his arm grew back under a mysterious force. He didn't have the time to waste. He drew his bow and fired.

Anya's expression changed, but the arrow she thought was aimed for her suddenly vanished. She sighed a slight breath of relief. To her, Leonel was clearly targeting the defensive Savant that had just protected her, but if he thought it was so easy to deal with him, he would be sorely mistaken. This Savant was the oldest in her possession, and also the one with the highest survivability if Lionel was ignored. The irony that Lionel had long since died to Leonel's hands didn't settle in until it was far too late.

Anya's expression, which had just settled, shook once again as she looked down at her ring in horror. But there was nothing she could do.

CRACK!

The ring on her finger, a protective item that carried her greatest trump cards, cracked and then shattered into pieces.

It was then that it dawned on Anya. Leonel's arrow wasn't aimed at her or the defensive Savant. Somehow, he had breached the boundaries of reality, peeling back the layer of space that her spatial ring called home and attacking its structure directly. In that moment, it wasn't just one Savant that perished; it was all of them.

Anya didn't have time to recover before the defensive Savant, standing before her in a protective stance, froze. He stood there for a moment, seemingly at peace, before...

BANG!

His head shattered like a watermelon. This time, in too stunned a state, Anya was splattered from head to toe in blood, her pristine image, already shattered by Leonel's fists, falling even further.

Leonel took a step forward, his fist piercing forward. It ripped through Anya's chest as she stood frozen, her body shivering as she looked down at the hole going through her chest.

"What right do you have to speak to me about morality, what place does trash have to pass judgment on my actions?"
