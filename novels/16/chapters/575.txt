Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Leonel couldn't put his fury into words. Even seeing Raynred's pathetic display did nothing to make him feel better.

Just months ago, he had been with these young men and women, fighting to keep their lives, growing friendships, talking about life. Yet, no amount of anger would bring them back. Nothing he did to Raynred would appease him.

Leonel was so agitated that he began to cough violently, the injuries that had yet to heal from his battle with the Puppet Master flaring up.

Soot and char covered air surged out from his mouth. His coughing became so violent that blood began to appear once again, sending his body into complete disarray.

"Leonel!"

Aina worriedly placed a palm against Leonel's chest, her expression warping.

The headpiece that had been in possession of the Puppet Master was burnt to ash by Leonel. He knew well that Aina wouldn't want to have anything to do with a treasure tainted by that thing, nor did Leonel need it. It might have been a Quasi Bronze treasure, but it simply had no ability to boost the strength of Leonel's mind which already had a Fifth Dimensional foundation.

Though it seemed as though the Puppet Master's mental strength was beyond Leonel's due to the range of its ability, this was a misconception. Leonel was well aware that the Puppet Master used a few tricks to accomplish such a feat. Plus, the current Leonel could create such treasures on a whim as long as he had the ores necessary.

This aside, Aina's birthday present more than covered for her weaknesses. It allowed her to see the true state of Leonel's body and the reality made her expression warp.

To say that Leonel was injured was an understatement. And, maybe the worst part about it all was that most of it was self inflicted.

Leonel purposely made use of his Scarlet Star Force in those final moments. Without it, it would have been impossible to burn such a powerful existence to ash.

Unfortunately, even in such a measured and controlled fashion, the use had practically turned Leonel's insides into a charred mess. Not a single one of his inner organs were spared.

If it wasn't for the insane amount of vitality the complete Metal Body provided, along with the fact Leonel's body had entered the Fourth Dimension, he probably would have formed a second pile of cremated remains beside the Puppet Master.

Leonel's body had already been in a terrible state, but he had practically pushed himself over the edge.

The overbearing nature of Scarlet Star Force wasn't just a legend.

Seeing Leonel's state, many began to realize something was wrong, especially with how his murderous aura seemed to have deflated.

Having regained much of the control of his body, Raynred suddenly realized that his previous actions weren't as valiant as he had thought. His temper flared once more, but this time he wasn't foolish enough to voice it again. He had already embarrassed himself enough today. Now... he just wanted to vent.

Leonel looked up from his coughing, his eyes completely red.

He somehow felt that he should have been there, but it was simply impossible for him to be everywhere at once. He didn't even know the Slayer Legion was taking part in this battle. It was an irrational guilt that weighed even heavier on his consciousness than before.

This wasn't the first time Leonel had felt survivor's guilt, but this time still hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest.

Leonel's red eyes locked onto Raynred as though projecting the gaze of a wounded beast. It made one feel that no matter how injured he was, he would still find a way to take Raynred down with him, even if it meant having to rip the latter's throat out with his teeth.

The murderous aura came back like an endless tide. This time, it was tens of times stronger, Leonel's irises reddening entirely.

Flickers of flames licked across his body as though prepared to erupt at any moment.

"I'll kill you."

The words dripped with venom, frying the nerves and fraying one's senses.

However, before Leonel could move, Aina gripped his wrist hard.

"Stay." She said sternly, meeting Leonel's reddened gaze as though she couldn't sense his murderous intent. Even at this moment, she seemed to be the only one completely unaffected.

Aina leapt from the surfboard, her hand reaching out into empty space only for a golden red ax to shoot into her palms.

Raynred felt as though he was swimming in a quagmire, hardly able to budge an inch. But, seeing that it was Aina who actually dared to attack him like this, he roared, trying to expand his chest until his fear dissipated.

However, the Aina he knew before was completely unlike the one now.

Before Raynred could react, Aina had descended onto the building, her ax slashing downward.

An arm flung into the skies, followed by a shrill cry.

However, that wasn't the end of it. The mere blade wind of Aina's ax traveled through the building beneath their feet, splitting it in two.

Raynred fell to his knees, grasping at his empty shoulder socket.

"You ugly bit --!"

Raynred's cry was cut off by yet another arm flying, taking with it yet another slice of the collapsed building.

Just as Aina was about to finally land, her leg angled forward, the sole of her feet slamming Raynred's face into the steel and concrete below.

The entire building collapsed as Aina and Raynred followed it to the ground. But, unlike Aina who stood on Raynred's head, the latter had his face buried into the rubble.

BANG!

The distant armies watched this scene in apprehension. Was this the strength someone should have in the Fourth Dimension?

The only thing they had to comfort themselves was that though Earth had evolved, their buildings were still in the Third Dimension. They wouldn't have been part of the strengthened.

Aina could have crushed Raynred's head to a pulp. But, instead, she wrenched his head up from the ground by his long black hair, fury coloring her face.

Aina slammed her ax into the ground, running her free palm across its blade.

Her blood trickled like gorgeous rubies. Beautiful seemed like the last word you'd use to describe such a thing, yet her life's liquid truly reflected like the most pristine gems.

Raynred's face was completely destroyed. His nose was so bent it had gone flat, his teeth shattered like glass, and even his jaw seemed to have been dislocated.

He wanted to cry out in pain, but he couldn't even make a sound without feeling even more pain.

His moans came out in whimpers, his body trembling.

But, this was just the beginning of his torture.

Aina yanked his broken jaw open, half ripping it from its hinges completely.

Her blood fell down what remained of his throat, causing him to shudder.

She released her grip, letting him fall to the ground and watching on coldly.

Soon, Raynred began to writhe, his body violently convulsing.

Even without his jaw and much of his tongue, he finally found the strength to cry out.. However, his cries were distorted, reaching up into the skies as though he was a dying beast.
