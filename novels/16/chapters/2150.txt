The flying Ancestors looked like laser beams streaking across the skies. They moved so fast that the air combusted and space trembled.

As Leonel had expected, they had gathered together, forming a pack. Although they could cause more devastation to the humans by separating and attacking all nine cities at once, this would put their lives in danger. They had already come to understand that Leonel could somehow use the corpses of Ancestors to strengthen himself in these few hours, they couldn't risk any more accidents.

When they saw that Leonel was waiting ahead of them, their faces almost lit on fire for more reasons than just the combusting air around them. They wished that they could eat this child alive.

Not a single one of the Races had experienced losses less than a billion. For the largest of them, this was at least a 5% loss on their numbers, for the smallest it was already as much as 10%. To lose so much in just a few hours was completely unacceptable.

This boy needed to die. They didn't care if he was relying on someone else to do all of this, they didn't care if he was just a figurehead used in an attempt to humiliate them, both things they believed in their hearts to be the truth. All they cared about right this moment was crushing Leonel and forcing whoever was at his back to come out so they could crush them as well with their full force.

That was right. They had come all together like this not only out of caution toward what other tricks Leonel might have up his sleeves, but also because they felt that once they targeted Leonel like this, they might accidentally trigger the final stages of the battle. In such a situation, they would crush the Ancestors of the Human Race with all their might.

However, even after they closed the distance to just a few dozen kilometers, nothing more than a few seconds to the likes of them, there was still only Leonel, standing in the skies with his spear pointed toward the ground. He seemed to be completely focused.

He didn't manifest his Divine Armor because he knew it couldn't withstand the kind of strength coursing through his body at the moment. But the rush of Force didn't stop.

His hair fluttered in the wind, his bare torso exposed to the world, covered in sweat, his pants simple and soft, rolled to his calves. He looked like he was in the middle of a training session rather than about to face off against a legion of dozens of Ancestors as a boy of the Sixth Dimension.

Suddenly, when the distance was less than ten kilometers, his eyes opened. His smile was gone and all that was left was an endless abyss of cold. The sharpness of his blade seemed able to cut the hardest of gems, the howl of his Spear Force shredding the air around him to pieces.Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

He took a step forward and eight flashes manifested around him. All eight Ancestors had returned, their auras blazing along with Leonel's. A pride shone within their eyes, as though they felt there was nothing they could do in their lives better than fighting on the same battlefield as Leonel.

Leonel's spear trembled and a crisscrossing, hazardous wasteland of spear blades shot through the air.

The Ancestors who had been charging forward with all the momentum in the world suddenly found themselves having to stop to defend themselves. The strength of this attack was beyond their expectations.

"Seven minutes," Leonel said lightly, his voice emotionless.

The Ancestors didn't know what this meant, but Leonel had already moved, his squad of Ancestors following to his back. They shot across the skies, intertwining around each other with a tacit understanding.

The Majestic Vulture took the helm, its wings spreading so far and wide that all eight behind him had been perfectly obscured. Before the Ancestors could rely on their Internal Sight to find the true locations, an orb of darkness, within Leonel as the starting point, suddenly erupted.

In the skies, an orb of darkness as large as a small moon appeared. Not even a few seconds after it had formed, a body flew out like a flying meteor. It landed on the ground heavily, and the Nomad Race Ancestor who owned it coughed up several mouthfuls of blood. However, just when it seemed that he would be fine, his chest exploded with countless crisscrossing blades.

Just like that, his body was shredded to pieces, the only thing barely remaining intact being his head and his eyes opened wide to the world.

One after another, Ancestors were thrown out like ragdolls, the shocking devastation that Leonel had left in his wake leaving the Human Domain in silence once again. But while in the past it had been due to Leonel's potential, they now realized just how na√É¬Øve they were.

This wasn't just a future monster, this was a monster. This wasn't a young man that was a devastation to the younger generation, he was a devastation to anyone that dared to slight him.

The orb of darkness suddenly burst. Leonel appeared drenched in blood, his left arm gone from the shoulder down and his right leg vanquished from the knee down. All around him, the shattered corpses of his eight Ancestors were struggling to pull themselves together again, but he simply didn't have enough Dream Force left.

Even so, the wild, surging Spear Force around him didn't seem intent on stopping.

Below his feet, a gorgeous Force Art had taken shape. In direct contrast to the darkness that floated around him, it was bright and untouched by imperfection. It seemed like that star of the world, a sun of worlds, a radiance of the universe, untouchable by even the Regulator itself.

With his singular arm, he raised his spear, the intent in his eyes as lofty as the skies above.

The Ancestors couldn't support him at the moment, but it was their momentum that had allowed him to complete his Force Art. This strength was beyond just eight Ancestors.

"Seven minutes," Leonel said lightly.

The tip of his spear trembled and the radiance beneath his feet took over the world, swallowing everything in its path.

Without hesitation, the Ancestors that remained turned, running for their lives.
