When Simona lost her puppy it was akin to her losing almost 90% of her talent and cutting off the future hope of the Godlen family. No matter how great their conviction, how could a population of people be willing to stay in seclusion forever?

At the same time, how could Simona be willing to never reach her full potential? There was simply no replacement for her beast companion, it had quite literally been born with her. It was like an extension of her limb.

This is why she had shed tears when Leonel returned it. After 20 years of despair, hearing the praises of people while knowing that she could be so much better, she finally saw the light of hope that she had prayed for for so long.

What she was even more thankful for was Leonel's restraint.

That puppy wasn't just a benign little creature, it was also an endless bundle of energy. It had carried over 90% of her energy until this moment. Every time she took one step forward, it would take almost ten. On top of this, it was the purest form of absorbable Force as well.

There was a reason that the Godlen family had been forced into seclusion long ago, a story that had been wiped from the annals of Human Domain history.

Their beast companions were just extensions of their Lineage Factors and were more valuable than even Pure Force Crystals. Their beast companions could quite literally be used as resource wells. To put this matter into proper perspective, the immature beast companion of back then, the very one Simona had lost, could be used to produce dozens of Conventional Path Seventh Dimensional existences. It could even be used at a crucial point to push one to the Eighth Dimension of the Conventional Path, something that was extraordinarily rare.

She didn't believe that Leonel could sense this, but she also wasn't surprised.

Leonel was a man who had turned down the Shadow Sovereign Lineage Factor because he could stand to kill an unborn Rapax. Many would see such Rapax as nothing more than enemies of another race, unable to humanize them in any way because they simply looked too foreign.

But not him.

Simona didn't know Leonel very intimately, but she knew enough about him to be willing to follow him wholeheartedly. It was just a shame that at the final moment, she wasn't able to be as useful as she had initially hoped to be.

~Grrrr

A little puppy growled by Simona's feet, causing her furrowed brows to unwrinkle into the hint of a smile. By now, the little puppy had finally begun to show some signs of growth and was about 20% larger than Leonel remembered.

Although she had lost 20 years, because she was so much more powerful now, Simona could help the little one to grow a lot faster. Before, it had taken over 20 years for it to reach the stage of being able to walk around on its own. But now, after only just a year or so of having returned to her size, it had grown by 20%.

At this pace, it would reach maturity in just another decade or so. Given the fact the more talented she was, the more time it would take, this speed was actually exceptional. Originally, her companion wouldn't have reached maturity until she became an Ancestor level character, and even then it wasn't entirely certain.

It seemed that being forced to find a path without this little guy for so long had definitely helped her in many ways.

"Come on, little guy. Although we aren't allowed to display too much of our strength, I don't believe that we can't make a dent in this army."

The little puppy barked with a menacing glare in its eyes, but Simona only laughed more heartily. The little guy didn't sound very menacing at all.I think you should take a look at

Those who knew Simona would truly be shocked right now, how could they have ever seen this ice beauty laugh like this?

Simona turned and strolled forward. The more she walked, the more her laughing expression faded. By the time she walked out from the hall, her expression was icy, her purple hair dancing in the wind.

A powerful voice came from the side. A young man standing atop a black line with flickering black flames for a mane appeared. The beast seemed to be both illusory and corporeal. Despite the fact the rumbling of the ground had already reached this point and the buildings were quaking, whether it was the beast or the young man, both were entirely indifferent.

"With the current state of things, we will lose," the young man said indifferently.

They were limited in the strength they were allowed to display. In this regard, they were a lot like the Umbra family. So, the moment they saw the state of this, they knew there was nothing they could do.

The question was whether or not Simona wanted them to continue to fight to put up a fa√É¬ßade, or to retreat right this moment.

"We will fight," Simona said lightly.

The young man didn't show any dissatisfaction or pleasure, he only nodded once. "Yes, Young Miss."

...

The rumbling came to a stop just half a kilometer from the gates of the Pyius family territory. Seated in the middle of the army, Xavnik watched on with silence as Ysemsan took a step forward.

"We will give you all a choice out of respect for the Pyius family. Heiress Simona may choose to crush her badge now and we will make no attempts to stop her. If you refuse, we will attack with full force!"

Ysemsan had hardly finished when the thunderous roar of countless beasts echoed.

Simona's gaze flickered as another army came into view from the distance.

Seated in the middle of his army, Xavnik's gaze couldn't help but narrow. It couldn't be?

At that moment, Leonel rode over from the distance with his arms still wrapped around Aina's waist. He didn't seem to be taking this very seriously at all.

"Ah, Third Nova," Leonel said with surprise. "I didn't expect that you and I would actually have the same idea, what a small world."
