1830 One Condition Leonel felt that his deduction simply ran smoother now with the improvement to his Dream Force. He saw the world with more clarity and could simulate with much greater speed and accuracy. It was as though he had his own personal vast world in his mind, just waiting to be experimented on.

He made large leaps with every passing second and in just a few hours, he had created dozens of potential prototypes for a treasure that could help with this. His favorite iteration was the simplest configuration, relying only on Pure Force Crystals, the Mantras he retrieved from the Zone, and a Life Force type Jade.

The only bottleneck would be Anastasia and her progress in dissecting and deducing the Mantras. But outside of that, the gadget was so simple that Leonel could allow the Segmented Cube to mass produce them once the blueprint was set.

Of course, the result wouldn't be as perfect as a true Ninth Dimensional world would be, but it didn't need to be. Even Leonel was much too far away from needing a Ninth Dimensional structure to help him along, let alone his brothers and the others.

There was something curious about these deductions, though.

Logically, even without a Ninth Dimensional world, lower level worlds should at least be able to sustain partial comprehensions on equally as low leveled runes. But for some reason they could not.

There was a deeper sort of... imperfection here. But for some reason, even the current Leonel couldn't grasp what it was.

Leonel opened his eyes and exhaled.

That was enough for now, Anastasia could handle the rest. By the time he was finished with the other things he had to do, the first would be finished and he should be able to use it immediately with his Vital Star Force. Like that, his speed of comprehension should skyrocket immediately.

'It's been three weeks,' Leonel thought with a cold flash in his eyes.

He had given the Oryx enough time. Now the two choices before them were all too obvious.

Leonel could feel that his tribulation was coming and he didn't know how long he would vanish for. He had to be certain that everything was perfectly lined up before he left because there was no telling what variables might appear in his absence.

So, he was entirely serious about eradicating the Oryx if they didn't comply. He would do everything he could to leave Earth in an absolute state of peace before he vanished.

But first, he would pay a little visit to the Thrusting Skies Sector.

He gave Aina who was meditating not far from him a kiss on the forehead before he left the Segmented Cube and manned the flagship to soar across Earth's territory.

*k Aleck had been sitting on pins and needles for the last several weeks.

While the Sectors were in chaos and everyone was ducking, hoping to not be the next ones to be destroyed and wondering how all of this was happening, he was all too clear who was responsible.

The young man never raised a single finger. He fought just a single battle and casually strode away after he was done. Right now, he was probably reclining with a woman in his arms, watching the world collapse around him.

The Thrusting Skies Sector had taken a small blow after losing so many Sixth Dimensional experts, but the Viola family lost several elite Seventh Dimensional experts in their sudden ambush attempt and my more promising Sixth Dimensional experts. Even setting aside this, the Chaotic Water Sector got it the worst because not a single aspect of their Empire remained, they were wiped out by Shield Cross Stars in just a single day!

Seeing these things happen one after another, Aleck couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep, he even found it difficult for him to breathe properly from day to day.

He was tired of people asking him what was wrong so he just sent away all of his attendants and he sat completely alone in a dining room capable of seating and serving over 300

people at once, and yet he didn't touch any of the food before him at all.

Suddenly, Aleck stood violently to his feet, snapping his own head around with such force that he quite nearly almost ended his own life.

When he saw the young man casually seated on the host's chair behind him, a table placed in an elevated position like the medieval dining rooms of old, his face paled completely. He seemed to have entirely forgotten that Leonel was a "mere" Sixth Dimensional existence and that he should have no need to fear him in a one on one battle.

Leonel smiled lightly and didn't say anything immediately, only faintly greeting Aleck. But to his surprise, the Patriarch immediately fell to his knees and slammed his forehead against the ground with such force that the entire room trembled.

"I am willing to place the entire strength of the Skies family behind you, Imperial Prince! Whether that be for the coming Heir Wars or anything else you might need us to do. I swear I will do my utmost, I only ask for a path to survival."

Leonel blinked a few times. Was he really that scary? He hadn't really been all that cruel in his estimation, he could have made things far worse for the three parties, but in the end he decided to just eradicate the Chaotic Water Sector. As far as he saw it, he had actually been quite nice.

Seeing that Leonel didn't answer, Aleck didn't dare to look up, he was absolutely subservient to Leonel, his heart having been subdued entirely.

Truthfully, this was the best outcome for Leonel. The Thrusting Skies Sector was about as powerful as the Chaotic Water Sector, or at the very least, the Chaotic Water Sector's display to the outside world. They were a Seventh Dimensional Sector not quite as good as the Constellation families, but not too far away either.

Essentially, they were around the upper portions of the middle of the pack when it came to the Seventh Dimension. They would probably immediately become Leonel's strongest support in terms of raw power.

In past years, Seventh Dimensional existences couldn'tÔøΩÔøΩ participate in the Heir Wars, but this was obviously thrown out the window considering the Heirs themselves were in the Seventh Dimension now.

Once Leonel entered the Seventh Dimension as well, the Heirs Wars would begin and there would be no escaping such things.

Leonel nodded to himself. By the time he entered the Seventh Dimension, the use of the Umbra, Florer, Midas and Radix families would probably be far more useful to him, but regardless, the Skies family would be a decent smokescreen.T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

Plus, they would be a good sword to use in taking down the Viola family for good.

"Alright, I accept," Leonel said lightly. Before Aleck could be overjoyed, though, Leonel spoke again. "On one condition. Open up everything to me. I want to know even the deepest held secrets of your family. If you choose to hide anything from me, I will leave and not look back. When we meet again, it'll be during the destruction of your Sector."
