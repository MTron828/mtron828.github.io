He had decided to return. As far as he was concerned, whether he had this form or not, even if he forgot everything about entering it, it wouldn't make a difference. One way or another, these people would pay in blood, and that was especially so for the Spirituals. But before that, there were several of the Human Domain that he would make suffer for their inaction.

The only difference to him was a matter of time. Using this form would take much less effort, but there was no one in this world a match for him given time. They would all suffer one way or another.

When he made this decision, Leonel shifted his attention. He moved from thoughts of violence to thoughts of how to maximize his time in this form. Of course, his greatest reliance was his mind.

The first thing he did was analyze this new Lineage Factor. His Lineage Factor had undergone two changes since he last entered this form. The first was his fusion of it with the Silver Empire's portions, and the second was the Constellation event.

'I see. There's two main changes, and probably several dozen mid-level changes. Let's focus on...'

Leonel pressed a hand to his chest and closed. He drew five deep lines across his chest, but quickly, out of the center of his chest, three kernels of light appeared. Without much thought, Leonel squeezed a hand and shattered them.

These three were none other than his three Divine Armors. It was a shame; he didn't even get the chance to use his third, outside of the massacre of the Omann family, but it didn't matter much to him. In his eyes, these products were far too inferior. He could make them thousands of times better, but what he could do now was worthless.

He had to create a new design that was both far better, but also within the ability of his suppressed self to comprehend, or else it would be all useless. After not even a split moment of thought, his hand began to draw in the skies and three blueprints formed one after another. He hesitated for a moment, but didn't choose to form the fourth. It was better if his suppressed self did it; it would be a good opportunity to improve his Dream Force further, and that would give him a greater chance of remembering the things he had thought of in this state.

If one looked closely at these blueprints, it would be possible to see that the armor wasn't the only part present. In fact... it wasn't just one extra part either. There was not only a spear to pair with, but a bow as well!

Leonel waved a hand and the blueprints vanished.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He immediately began to draw another blueprint. Those that were sharp would be able to see that it was actually a Starship, but it wasn't just any Starship; it was one based on the creation of the Omann family. Leonel was actually creating a blueprint of modifications that would make it far more efficient.

He planned to destroy the Omann family soon enough, and he believed that they had definitely already created a fleet of these Starships. Obviously, when things were said and done, those Starships would be his own to have.

This blueprint was like killing two birds with a single stone. It would inform his suppressed self about all the obvious deficiencies that could be taken advantage of, while also strengthening himself a great deal the moment those Starships landed in his possession.

It took him no more than a few seconds to finish, and he put this blueprint away as well.

After he finished this, he pressed two hands to either side of his hips, right over his flaming kidneys. With a thought, they were suppressed and sealed. Soon, the flames flickered out, and they returned to their original states.

Everything flowed smoothly, but to Leonel, this was simply too easy. Because he was keeping the level of his suppressed self in mind, he didn't need a lot of time to do things to a standard that his suppressed self would understand. These things were as easy as breathing.

He turned his attention to his Ethereal Glabella. Within, the glorious Mage Core stood tall and proud, almost entirely unused by his suppressed self. It was astonishing how dense he could be sometimes, but there wasn't much he could do about it. Instead, he turned toward his Ten Stars and waved a hand.

They began to tremble and quake, solidifying and becoming purer and purer.

His Vital Stars, the only a minimal number of runes, began to quickly catch up with the others. His Void Star Force also began to swiftly gain nodes.

Soon, they came to a stop. If he did too much, it would have the reverse effect. This was at a level his suppressed self could easily comprehend, thus making things flow far more smoothly.

Leonel turned his attention to his body and shook his head. More stupidity.

His blood churned and he shattered the barriers holding back his Northern Star Lineage Factor just like he had done in the past.

Before, when Leonel lost consciousness, he had suddenly awakened with the Starry Tailed Fox Lineage Factor. You would have thought that he would have taken the hint, but apparently he was truly too stupid. While it was true that a Lineage Factor could suffer without having the appropriate paired techniques, the gap between a Seventh Dimensional Lineage Factor and a Peak Eighth Dimensional one was so large that it didn't matter, especially when two Peak Eighth Dimensional ones could interact and benefit one another greatly.

Unfortunately, he didn't have any golden tablets to reach the true pinnacle of these two halves of the Northern Star Lineage Factor, but this would have to be enough.

The roar of a majestic tiger and the proud shadow of a deer with fur as dark as night and eyes as bright as the starry skies appeared.

The tiger had gorgeous white fur and stripes of the brightest gold. Just a single one of its roars seemed capable of collapsing the bounds of reality itself.

The Golden Tiger and the Death Pulse Deer had appeared.

[Author's Note: Leonel and Aina are slipping further and further away from first place in the event *tears*. I was going to wait until later to say this, but if we can make it to first place overall by the end of the event, I was going to upload four chapters a day again for a 5 day period, so essentially five bonus chapters. Anyhoo, let's just try our best]
