Chapter 2550 [Bonus] Enough?

[Bonus chapter courtesy of Mr. Mostert <3 5/6]

A tiny fist appeared before Leonel's chest in a flash, and he didn't even seem capable of reacting in time.

The fist collided, that slender form packing the strength of a meteor's explosion. It didn't even seem certain that Seraphina's strong suit was the fist, but it didn't seem to matter...

Until she realized that Leonel hadn't moved.

"Don't use Dream Force like that," Leonel said lightly, "you'll only embarrass yourself."

Seraphina blinked and then suddenly smiled a beautiful smile. "You're saying such harsh words to a beauty, don't you feel bad?"

"You're not nearly as beautiful as my wife. You'd be better off being a vulture with those wings of yours."

Seraphina was stunned into silence. She had never heard anyone talk to her like that before; she didn't even know how to react...

Until the rage came.

Her white-gold arcs gained a tinge of pink as her anger flared up. She stopped using Dream Force like Fist Force; she hadn't even comprehended Fist Force in the past, she just thought that it would be more than enough to deal with Leonel.

Her wings spread out. As though embroidered in golden leaf metals, they shimmered, slashing down with menace and murderous intent.

Leonel's spear, still aimed toward the ground, suddenly flickered.

BANG! BANG!

Seraphina's two wings were deflected as a Shield suddenly appeared on Leonel's left arm. It swung down with its own undisguised menace, bashing against Seraphina's head and distorting her beautiful face into an assortment of flying teeth, blood, and a severely broken nose.

She shot backward, barely stabilizing herself after 20 or so meters due to her flapping wings.

Leonel stood in the same place, his irises still flickering like flames.

He raised his spear, pointing it at the three women.

"There's no one else coming. I've already killed them all. It'll probably be best if the three of you acted together."

Seraphina's eyes blazed with rage, and the beauty actually snarled.

"Seraphina."

The voice was like an ice-cold plunge. Seraphina felt her soul rip out of her body, only to be deposited right back.

She took a shuddering breath and looked back toward Minerva, her eyes flickering with a hint of fear.

Minerva smiled. "Your use of Dream Force is not bad. Successfully attacking the mind of an Owlan without her even noticing is without a doubt a feat to be proud of."

Another condescending statement rolled off her tongue as though it was nothing. She was truly an annoyance. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

"But there is also no need to lie. How can any wife of yours be more beautiful than an Owlan? Those of my Race would never marry a human; our bloodlines have unfortunately been too diluted already to take the risk."

She sighed, her tone light and full of air along with even a hint of cheer.

Leonel didn't respond immediately, looking at the woman. It was a dense sort of silence, only somewhat buffeted by the rolling winds and heavy breathing of Seraphina.

"Is that long enough?" Leonel suddenly said.

Minerva's eyes narrowed only for a moment before they went back to normal, her cheery self returning.

"I just wanted to make sure you know that I was going to shred you to pieces now not because your Dream Force is something impressive, but because there are just some things you don't say."

Leonel's spear remained steady, pointing right at Minerva's perfect nose.

"The Minerva Race was made up of nothing but hacks and wackjobs with delusions of grandeur and God Complexes. It seems that while you didn't gain their strength, you certainly gained their unwarranted arrogance.

"Oh, and I meant what I said. My wife is much more beautiful than you."

Leonel vanished, appearing before Seraphina so fast that she accidentally inhaled some of the blood that was pooling into her mouth.

Her wings flapped hard, doing double duty, both helping her escape and slowing Leonel's approach.

But under Leonel's control, the Dream Force separated and became his speed instead. He closed the distance even faster, his spear appearing before her throat.

Seraphina's eyes widened, not understanding how this could be happening. She had entered Tier Nine as well, so why was it that she felt so outmatched right now?

Unfortunately for her, her Ninth Dimensional strength was meaningless here. The only thing that mattered was her Dream Force.

In the past, Leonel had been lagging quite far behind. But now, he had not only affirmed his Sovereignty, but he was in the Life State as well.

Even if Seraphina had a Middle Life State Dream Force, she was absolutely no match for him without a Sovereignty of her own.

If she tried to use Dream Force as another Force, it would be stripped of her control entirely. If she tried to use Dream Force as Dream Force, she would be outmatched in terms of both ingenuity and raw power.

Leonel's spear flickered, drawing a line of silver across the air and swiping at Seraphina's throat.

Just when he was about to succeed, he sensed danger. The violet dress-wearing Owlan, Octavia, appeared on his right side, the side opposite to his shield. He had to admit that it was a clever choice...

Though a predictable one.

A Dream Net appeared, and a Tier Nine creature's strength was unleashed like the roar of a dragon.

Leonel didn't even look at her, his spear flicking upward and taking Seraphina's head.

The momentum of his body carried him forward, and as though he wasn't satisfied, a blooming Dream Force took shape as he shield-bashed Seraphina's body, blowing it to pieces.

At the same time, Octavia was forced to wrap her body in her wings, pushing forth with a large amount of Dream Force to protect herself, but that didn't stop her from being sent flying into the distance, covering several kilometers before she could finally stop.

Leonel landed on the ground, his battle intent still flaring.

He hardly paused for a moment before he exploded toward Minerva.
