"Oh?"

Leonel's expression went from serious to a light smile. 

Not only was this Ronan character prepared, he was also very close to Leonel's real location. He was barely half a kilometer away. At that distance, even if he didn't have the Bow Domain Lineage Factor, it would have been too easy to spot him. 

Even if he was beaten to death Leonel wouldn't believe that this was a coincidence. There were only two possibilities and only one of them truly made sense considering this man's last name was Sith. The current Leonel was well aware that the Sith represented the assassination units of Shield Cross Stars. 

This was no coincidence. Even if Leonel hadn't exposed his location, it was likely that Ronan had been monitoring him all the while. The moment he tried to hide, the latter would have taken action. 

Ronan was already in the Seventh Dimension, a worthy power level for a man who ruled over one of the most important Factions of the Void Palace. However, Leonel still looked at him as though he was staring at prey. 

In the skies above, DiVincenzo slowly regained his composure. Although things had already gotten out of hand, there was already no turning back. They had come here with the intent to sacrifice for the sake of maintaining order. Shield Cross Stars wouldn't bow in the face of power and prestige, or else how would they continue to be the protectors of the Human Domain? 

"I will give you one more chance to hand yourself in. If you do not comply, not only will you become a Tier 1 Fugitive, but your sentencing will be far harsher."

Leonel suddenly yawned beside himself, he was truly a bit tired. It took quite a lot out of him to fully assimilate the Void Tower and he hadn't had time to rest then. However, it could be said that his timing was quite horrible. He was maybe one of the only few men in existence who still had time to be tired in the face of such a fleet of planetary warships. 

After a moment, Leonel looked away from Ronan and his gaze pierced the veil and landed on Cornelius. 

"Hey old man, there's still a chance here. If the Void Palace does what it's supposed to do and protects its disciples from nonsense, I won't mind being a bit more obedient. But if you don't, well… Beneath the Seventh Dimension, I doubt there's anyone here who can survive my blade, and I most certainly won't be showing any mercy. 

"So what will it be?"

Cornelius' expression twitched. This brat, couldn't he lay down his pride for a second and say it nicely? Does he know that these old fogies care about their faces the most? 

Almost as soon as he finished this thought, Cornelius felt three auras appear in the skies. Had Leonel been there when Rosen reported his matters to the Void Elders, he would have recognized them as Void Elder Wimarc, Void Elder Galienne and Void Elder Lizbeth. 

Gallienne, the female drill sergeant lookalike among them peered down from the skies with hints of fury in her gaze. However, when Leonel's eyes panned over, he didn't seem to notice her anger at all as though he was still waiting for an answer and expected it out of one of these three since Cornelius couldn't speak. 

This was truly the last chance that Leonel was giving. 

No matter how powerful Shield Cross Stars was, could they compare to the geniuses of the Void Palace? Only their Star Rank Path officers would, but even if there were others in hiding while only DiVincenzo stepped out, they would be in the Sixth Dimension and only equivalent to Void Palace geniuses. 

If that was the case, what did Leonel have to fear from them, exactly? They'd have to bring out the heavy machinery to deal with them, but by that point, they would also risk killing the disciple of the Void Palace. 

This was all to say that if there was anyone with a chance of threatening him, it would come from the disciples of the Void Palace themselves, and if they came for him in an attempt to help Shield Cross Stars bring him in, well… 

Like he had said, his blade wouldn't show mercy. This could be considered the only chance at mercy he would give.  Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Void Elder Lizbeth wanted to speak, but before she could, she could only smile bitterly as Galienne finally snapped. The latter had been waiting for Leonel to speak first, but who would have thought that Leonel wouldn't be in a hurry at all? 

"You are just like your father. Unruly, completely ignorant of propriety and the greater good. Why should the Void Palace protect a disciple like you, one that is so selfish and conceited. I do not know whether Shield Cross Stars speaks the truth or not, but what I do know is that an organization that has given their all to protecting the peace of the Human Domain would not speak without reason, and I have also seen your character first hand. 

"What about you deserves the benefit of my doubt?"

Leonel suddenly yawned again, this one lasting so long that his eyes watered. 

Reaching a hand upward, he wiped his eyes and blinked, trying to stave off his fatigue. 

As real and unabashed as his actions were, they only made Galienne more infuriated. Each maybe of this family was worse than the last. The father had been unruly and even attacked and killed. The uncle entered and exited as he pleased although he had long since been expelled and banished. And now the son and nephew was doing as he pleased as well. 

But the difference between them was that the father and uncle had the capital to be so arrogant. What did this pup have, exactly?! 

"Alright," Leonel said, lightly stretching. 

At that moment, his body began to slowly emit a white-gold light that only became more blinding with every passing second. 

"I hope you don't regret it."
