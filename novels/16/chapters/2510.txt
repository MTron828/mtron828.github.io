Chapter 2511 [Bonus] Prophecies

[Bonus chapter courtesy of Firemonster <3 2/6]

Anselma was finding it harder and harder to control her emotions. They were quickly spiraling out of control.

She knew at this point that it was her bloodline influencing her the most. The madness of the Brazinger family was something that was well documented, and she knew well of the trouble it could bring. But these people were making it very hard.

"Our three families are very unhappy with you, is the bottom line, Anselma. Because of you, we threw away our own experts-"

"How was I supposed to know that he was so powerful?! Did I not go and risk myself as well?!"

"And that's the only reason we haven't turned on you. It's obvious to us all that you were manipulated. At worst, that man was a variable we all had to take into account, but the only person he truly threatened was King. What's the difference between one King or one Velasco ruling over our heads? Is it not the same?

"It's only because your man feared for his life that he sent us down to deal with him, and look at the result.

"Four of our best experts are heavily injured and we lost two of the best protectors humanity had on top of that when we could have made due with just the loss of one."

"That's enough!" Anselma snapped.

"No. It's not." Ymesmai continued just as calmly. "I will remind you why our families exist. It's not to be the pawns of the humans, or whatever demons might be lurking behind them and pulling their puppet strings. Our one goal has been and will always be to survive. That it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Even if it means sacrificing the rest of the Human Race to do so, we must survive.

"Now this entire situation is spiraling out of control and you're at the center of it.

"None of us know why that young man is so powerful, but what we do know is that you've made him our enemy not because of a logical decision, but because you shared a bed with the wrong person. You put us in this compromised position, and you need to remember that before you go around trying to show off your strength everywhere you go."

Anselma's chest rose and fell, but she didn't have a rebuttal.

Survive.

That was the very same directive they had all been given. They were the last hope of the Human Race, and one day this investment would come in handy.

As for what they were waiting for, none of them knew. But they knew the importance of waiting. It was a prophecy even more important than any before it. Of which, there were six, each one written on a different tablet, and of which, two were intimately familiar to Leonel.

... The Violet winds rise North ...... A Union of Light and Darkness will reveal the Twelve-Pointed Star ...

This prophecy, though, was more important than all of them. That was because it didn't come from a Bronze Tablet or the unknown Tablet the first came from... it came from a Tablet locked in a Holy ground shared by the Four Great Families together...

A Tablet that radiated a rainbow of colors and looked to be carved of diamond.

The only Life Grade Tablet in existence.

The only thing that could force Anselma to come off her high horse and listen to the words of these three... three people she felt were wholly beneath her.

"The Godlens have begun making moves we don't understand. The Dream Pavilion has suddenly unleashed something that is beyond our comprehension. It's time the Four Great Families make a move of their own. This cannot continue like this."

...

Urlgan was a man of few words. He only spent his time doing three things.

Fucking women. Training. And eating.

He had no patience for anything else; of these three endeavors, he spent the most time on the middle pursuit.

Except for his son.

Who was a man without an Heir? Even though he was the hand that held up the skies for both the Sun and Moon Demons, every man was aware of their mortality. Unless he could one day reach that legendary level, he would one day perish one way or another. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"Where is Xagu?" Urlgan said calmly.

This question didn't seem to make sense given he had just been given a report of what happened. But the Sun and Moon Demons looked toward one another.

"He has begun to gather," one said slowly.

"How many years?" Urlgan asked again.

"At this pace, if Your Majesty is unwilling to help him, it will take about 200 years before he is resurrected."

"Wastrel," Urlgan said coldly. "Give his Essence to a worthy Eighth Dimensional expert."

The Sun and Moon Demons shuddered. This was essentially cosigning Xagu to a true death, but did they dare to levy a rebuttal?

It had to be remembered that upon reaching the Ninth Dimension, True Death could only be prematurely triggered by an act of a Regulator or one surpassing a Regulator.

Clarence had clearly not done either, which meant that given enough time, Xagu would come back to life.

But Urlgan said that the second most powerful expert of the Sun Demons was a wastrel, so much so that he would rather give his Essence to someone who couldn't break into the Ninth Dimension on their own than allow the man to resurrect.

If it took Xagu over 200 years to come back, he would be beyond his prime and progressing would be incredibly difficult, but he would still have a chance. He was already so close to the Life State to begin with.

Plus, weren't Xagu and Urlgan childhood friends? How could he be so callous?

In the end, the mighty Xagu, who could rule a cardinal direction in his prime, lost his last chance at life just like this. Maybe even in his death, he could have never imagined that it would be his closest friend who would toss him to the side like trash.
