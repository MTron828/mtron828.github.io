Leonel took out a stone. It was only as large as his palm, but its heft almost caused the back of his hand to hit the ground. This might not be too surprising if it was others, but Leonel's raw strength now had almost caught up with Aina's before she broke into the Seventh Dimension. His future wife was practically a dinosaur in the body of a lovely woman, so this metric alone was enough to paint just how powerful Leonel was.

The fact this stone was so heavy, though, only surprised Leonel further, that was because he could somewhat already guess what it could do.

This stone was designed to train Weapon Forces. One would sink their Weapon Force into the stone and in return, it would be shattered. This process would be fed back to the individual using the stone and the weaknesses of one's Weapon Force would be reflected to them.

This was a truly magical thing. If Leonel had seen such an item back in the Cataclysm Zone, he would have definitely taken it for himself even at the cost of giving up the other things that he had exchanged for.

Leonel didn't know how useful it would be for him since he had already formed a Sovereign Spear Force, but if he was correct, this sort of stone should be one of the best that the Suiard had access to. Depending on the talent of the person that was using it, helping them to form True Sovereign Weapon Force wasn't impossible.

The Suiard family simply called it the Whetstone, an apt name for its function.

Leonel hesitated. While he was curious to see if he could lower the required strikes to display Fourth Layered Spear Force, he didn't act immediately. After his recent increase in Dream Force, he had gone from needing almost a thousand strikes to only 333. If he used this stone, he might be able to lower it further.

If he could lower the requirement to just a hundred, he could probably use it for longer periods of time in battle. But... there was also the chance that the stone would be useless on him.

After analyzing the stone on its own, Leonel realized that there was actually a small introduction to the treasure. This made sense, the Morales would obviously force the families pressuring them to teach them how to use their treasures as well. After all, many of these were top secret and very few outside the top echelon of the families would know everything about them.

'I see...'

According to the introduction, this Whetstone was able to do one of two things depending on the focus of the user. The first was to allow one to comprehend Universal Weapon Force, the second was to increase the base power of one's Weapon Force itself.

There were various grades of Whetstones just like there were various grades of Morales pools as well. However, this was the highest Transcendent Whetstone, so there was no need to consider anything else.

The only requirement to use the stone was that you had already formed your Weapon Force. After that, the result was based on one's talent.

That said, according to the introduction, even those with the weakest of affinities, assuming they started with Third Dimensional Weapon Force, could increase their Weapon Force to the Fifth Dimension at worst.

Of course, the benefit would be lesser depending on where one began, but so long as you were below the Fifth Dimension, you would be guaranteed to form a Weapon Force two Dimensions above. If you had a Fifth Dimensional Weapon Force, however, you wouldn't be guaranteed anything if you had poor talent.√öpTodated ùíèovùíÜls on ùíèo(v)ùíÜl()bin(.)cùíêm

This logic was the same for Universal Weapon Force. Someone in the Four Seasons Realm could instantly comprehend the Heavenly Body Realm, but anything above wasn't guaranteed.

These effects seemed lackluster compared to the Morales pool allowing one to enter the Seventh Dimension of the Conventional Path instantly, but this wasn't the case. This was almost akin to increasing one's affinity for a Force instantaneously, it was much more complex than just increasing the strength of one's body.

Even so, Leonel frowned. After a long while, he made a decision.

"Emna."

Leonel's voice echoed and it drifted to one particular beauty. At the moment, Emna, even while seated in silence, felt like an unsheathed blade. But her aura was far too obvious.

Emna was the only one of Leonel's subordinates that Leonel felt stood firmly shoulder to shoulder with him and Aina. Her talent was that extraordinary. If not for wanting to keep her as a trump card as well, she would have displayed far more strength during the Heir Wars. Leonel couldn't imagine what would happen to her strength if she managed to become a True Blade Sovereign.

Leonel had wanted to give her the Sword Domain Ring, but then he realized that he was too na√É¬Øve. The sword and the blade were two wholly different disciplines. It wouldn't help Emna, it would hinder her.

So, instead he would give her this opportunity instead. If there was a Blade Domain Ring out there, she would definitely be the one to receive it.

Emna appeared before Leonel in a streak of sharp light, even leaving a faint white mark on the solid surface. Caught off guard, she caught the stone Leonel thrust at her.

Leonel explained things simply and concisely. Then, he began to describe Force Manipulation to her and gave her a few pointers on what to focus on while using the stone, then he let her go.

Whether she could become a True Blade Sovereign or not would be up to her. Leonel had succeeded in becoming a True Bow Sovereign without a Domain Ring, so he was certain that it was possible.

He turned his attention toward his other rewards. He didn't regret not being able to use the Whetstone. In fact, even if he didn't have fate with any of these treasures, he would still grin ear to ear, because that would mean he had given each one of his subordinates a huge boost.
