At that moment, Aina exited the tower, followed a few moments later by Amery. 

Aina had climbed to the 12th floor before running into some bad luck of her own. Well, she had technically run into said bad luck on the 11th floor where she was faced with a skeleton graveyard. 

Without any Blood Force to take advantage of, strength at Tier 2 of the Sixth Dimension, stacked with God Path comprehension, was beyond what she could contend with.

In order to cross the 11th floor, she essentially drained herself of all her Life Force, knowing that it was a simulation. But, facing even more undead on the 12th floor, there was really nothing that she could do to contend, leading to her loss. 

As for Amery, he climbed to the 10th, clearing it before he directly stopped. It was clear he knew things that Leonel and Aina didn't, so he hadn't even tried to go beyond. 

Stepping out, he rose his head to the leaderboards, giving them a once over. 

When he saw that Leonel was still inside, and facing a Spiritual at that, his gaze narrowed, an expression that only became darker when he realized that Leonel actually hadn't died. 

Aina's attention had been on Leonel from the very beginning. When she realized the race Leonel was up against, her brows, too, shot up. 

"Beauty! Beauty! How about you join my Morning Dew Faction! We'll give you a 100 Void Point daily spending quota and this big brother here will be your personal bodyguard!"

"Fuck off, 100 Void Points? Are you trying to entice a beauty? Or call up a common street whore? Piss off! Beauty! My Twin Rope Faction will give you a 10 000 Void Point monthly spending limit!" 

The shouts instantly drowned out all the quiet, flooding the area with the bustling sounds of bids as though Aina was merchandise to be bought. No one bothered to try to entice Amery, knowing full well exactly who he'd join, there was simply no point. However, Aina was a different matter entirely and her performance had been simply outstanding. 

"Shut up, all of you!"

An overwhelming pressure crushed the growing noise, the delicate voice that called out still somehow seeming like a clap of thunder. 

Most almost immediately shut their mouths, moving out of the way as a beauty sauntered over. 

They all recognized this woman quite well. There was no man of the Void Palace that wouldn't. Number three on the Queen Beauty rankings, Vega Quarius. 

However, this identity of hers was most definitely the weakest, because she also happened to be the Faction Leader of the Limpid Touch Faction… Not just any Faction, but a Gold Grade Faction! 

The Limpid Touch Faction was most definitely a front runner to soon become a Legacy Faction as it was  well known that Vega would soon meet the requirements to become the part of a Party. As such, the current Limpid Touch Faction was in a sort of contentious time as Vega waited to choose her successor and the soon to be second Leader of the Limpid Touch Faction. 

The trouble was that while the Faction was filled with talents, none were so greatly superior over the other that there would be no pushback toward her choice. Knowing all of this, Vega's purpose here was all too obvious. 

Although Aina had only just appeared, the talent she displayed was unlike anything they had seen in a very long time. That along with the fact she was a beauty that lost out to Vega in no way, made Aina quite literally the perfect candidate. 

Vega would have to slow her plans down a bit and push some things back so that she could groom Aina, but it would most definitely be worth it. It was like this present had fallen right into her lap. 

The prestige of a Legacy Faction was something she had wanted for a very long time. Only by making the Limpid Touch Faction a Legacy Faction could it gain the foundation and strength to become a Party. Once that happened, she could return as its leader, making her a Party Head with some real weight and authority. 

Such a thing, though, couldn't be accomplished with just a single astounding talent. There were many talents in her Faction, but the number on Vega's level was zero. If Aina was added, that number would tick up to one. 

One pillar was shaky, but two pillars were a different matter entirely. 

"Little sis, my name is Vega. If you join my Limpid Touch Faction, I'm willing to give you a million Void Point and ten Void Merit allowance a month. We'll also give you a free pass to any of our stores and libraries. Also—"

Vega's offers had already caused the crowd to suck in a cold breath. Many who had made offers previously could only blush in embarrassment, falling into hushed silence and scurrying into the crowd to escape from the jeers.

However, Vega still came to a pause, realizing that Aina wasn't actually paying attention to her at all. 

Vega's cherry lips closed, her expression not faltering at all. 

She was truly worthy of her title of Queen Beauty. Her blue dress, embroidered by gorgeous green and gold patterns, clung to her every curve. Her hair was a radiant and almost fairy tale like blue, her eyes shimmering a deep and vast emerald. 

Even being ignored, her expression was calm and her small hands clasped to her front, following Aina's gaze to the screen above. 

"Ah…" Aina looked back, seemingly feeling that someone was talking to her. "… I'm sorry, a moment please."

Then, she turned back to the screen, focusing her entire attention on it. 

Vega had only rushed here after receiving a report from her subordinates and had only paid attention to Aina's screen from the very beginning. Her Faction only had women in it to begin with, and she also didn't have time to spend on juniors. If not for the insistence of some of her Faction, she wouldn't have come at all, and she was glad she had. 

But, now finally paying attention to Leonel's screen, her gaze couldn't help but narrow. 

Drawing dead?
