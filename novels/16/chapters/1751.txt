Leonel seemed to realize what happened and retracted his aura; allowing Emna to finally breathe a sigh of relief; If that feeling was persistent; she had no idea how she would even speak with Leonel for an extended period of time; her heart might beat out of her chest before she could finish a single sentence; 

"Right…" Emna shook her head, not daring to look into Leonel's eyes; "… this station is under the jurisdiction of Shield Cross Stars; As an organization, they're capable of gathering up a large amount of information and it's difficult to pin them down on anything; Even after they retreated from Earth's territory, their hooks are still deeply embedded;

"The goal of this mission was to catch them off guard and maybe see if we can find any clues about finding other stations like this one; After our merger with the former Milky Way Guild. we gained a lot of the information they had on hand and benefited from it; Amongst that information were some of the stations they had been able to unearth over several centuries. but even so. there were only three;"

Leonel's gaze flickered. 

For a long while; the Milky Way Guild had had a monopoly on Earth's home galaxy; but due to this; it was also a convenient target for outside influences; 

Due to this. Heira's father found himself constantly dealing with power struggles; However. it was also due to this that the former Guild Head had gained a great amount of opportunities as well; 

The last time Leonel had seen Guild Head Ovilteen. the latter had just broken into the Sixth Dimension and turned the tables on the Radix. Midas. Rain. Florer and Umbra families. But it seemed that his schemes ran deeper than even this considering he knew of a station that existed so far away from the Milky Way Galaxy.  Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"I see, but isn't Shield Cross Stars the police force of the Human Domain, why do you want to target their influence?"

If the higher ups of Shield Cross Stars knew that Leonel had actually spoken such words. they might truly cough up blood in fury; Since when did Leonel have respect for Shield Cross Stars and its work? He actually had the cheek to say such a thing while one of their stolen ships loomed over his head; 

Emna seemed to know that Leonel just wanted to hear her answer; After all. they had already gotten news that Shield Cross Stars was being kicked out of Earth's territory. so how could they be unaware of the events leading up to it? It could only be said that this organization a few words of Leonel's had helped to form wasn't nothing short of impressive; 

"They've been abusing their power for a long time. but it's never been a systemic issue; It was mostly just a few corrupt officers here and there. taking advantage of their station; However. in just the last few days. things have gone from a few bad apples to becoming something far more sinister;"

Leonel's gaze narrowed. 

"According to our intel. of ten incidents creeping up in our territory. at least eight of them are as a direct result of SCS's interference; Although none of it is obvious. their fingerprints are all over the place and we were able to find out using these three unearthed stations as observation points; 

"After we realized what was happening. there was some discussion about which steps to take next. but we were undecided on what to do; With only three observation points. there were too many other potential variables and even our "eight out of ten" assessment was just an extrapolation without solid evidence; 

"So…"

Emna felt a bit embarrassed when she got to this point in the story; The reality was that she didn't have authorization to come here; Although the idea of her coming had been floated, most had decided that it was far too dangerous; 

The most powerful individual of their organization was still Guild Head Ovilteen, but even after 20 years, he was still in the Sixth Dimension and there was simply no way for him to against a Seventh Dimensional existence head on; 

Emna, with her abilities, probably had the best chance; But, once again, it was far too dangerous; In fact, if not for Leonel's sudden appearance, she would have already lost her life; Just the residual shockwave from a weakened Seventh Dimensional expert's infuriated strike had left her in a half dead state and not far from the jaws of death; 

It was even more accurate to say that she really had died as she had suffered fatal damage. Just a few more seconds and she wouldn't have been able to hold on any longer. 

This was all to say that Emna had actually acted on her own, not liking the stalemate they had reached. The internal strife and voices of dissension were getting louder everyday and the original members needed a way to solidify their prestige once again, and the best method to do so would be to prove that Emna could assassinate even a Seventh Dimensional existence. 

If she had succeeded, how many would still dare to talk so much?

Even without Emna saying it out loud, just by her demeanor, Leonel could guess most of it. 

"Either way, now that we've succeeded, this is a good opportunity. We can scan the base and see if we can find any information that might help with finding out more news."

Leonel nodded. He was on a time crunch right now as there were at least three separate incidents that needed to be shut down as soon as possible, but this matter was vey important as well. Without Shield Cross Star's backing, there would be much fewer flare ups. 

"Let's take a look, then."

Leonel and Emna made their way and began to search the convenience station. However, even after several minutes and the use of his Starry Spirit Domain, Leonel couldn't seem to find anything.
