The young man wasn't a person that Leonel had interacted with before. He had an unassuming build, but his gaze was extraordinarily sharp, sharper than any Leonel had ever seen before. 

Among the youths here, he was one of the very few who didn't have a single scratch on him despite the sheer violence and carnage of the previous battle. There was no doubt that this person was highly skilled, extraordinarily so. 

From what Leonel could tell, this young man was also a person of very few words. The stronger his King's Might and Dream Force became, not to mention his soul, the better he was at reading people. For this young man to come out and say something, it was definitely something that was very important, at least to him. 

"That bow," the young man repeated, seemingly not perturbed by Leonel's silence, "how is it in your possession?"

Leonel observed this young man for a while longer. The silence didn't seem to make either man very awkward at all. Leonel continued to stare and the young man continued to remain silent, waiting for the response he wanted. 

"My mother gave it to me," Leonel finally said. 

The shock of Leonel's victory against Amery was still hanging thickly in the air. Many didn't quite know what to do moving forward, their minds stuck in limbo. 

On one hand, the prize they had all rushed forward for was now already in Leonel's hands, and he had also more than proved his strength. On the other, there wasn't an easy way to leave this place and many still didn't know how to wrap their heads around exactly what had just happened before them. 

For those who knew Amery, they understood him to be a real Deity within their generation. If they wanted a chance to catch up to him, they needed to step into the Sixth Dimension because it was the only way to bridge the advantage given by the Sword Domain Heirloom. 

Simply put, Amery gained a head start on his God Path, touching upon it much earlier than one should thanks to the insights granted by the Sword Domain. 

There was no use in getting jealous over it. After all, to be able to earn that Sword Domain Heirloom in that family of monsters to begin with was a feat all to itself. 

However, to see that legend in their eyes fall, and so easily at that. They found it difficult to wrap their heads around. 

But this young man seemed to have shocked them awake. That was right… The bow… That bow was at least of the Quasi Life Grade! In fact, it felt stronger than even others of that caliber they had seen. The fact that Leonel even had it in his possession was shocking enough, but the fact he could actually wield it…

The young man's gaze narrowed when he heard Leonel's answer. 

"That bow… shouldn't be in the hands of a Morales family member. In fact, it shouldn't be in the hands of anyone not of our families. But, somehow, it has acknowledged you… This… does not make sense."

The young man knew how finicky this bow was. Most couldn't even lift it up, let alone pull its bowstring. It was like the bow had made the conscious decision to lower itself to Leonel's level, just so that it could help him. It didn't make any sense at all. 

In fact, it would cause a major uproar if these matters were known about to the Void Palace. No… It would cause a major uproar when these matters were found out… 

"So, what do you want me to do about this, exactly?" Leonel asked. 

He wanted to understand what this young man's goal was exactly.  Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

"My name is Nazag Tarius. I tell you this so you know I am not a coward, but also for you to understand that I'm also far more reasonable than most. If a member of my alliance were to see you with this bow, their first assumption won't be that you claimed it for yourself, their first assumption would be your father has something to do with it. 

"You aren't the first genius bowman in the Void Palace's history, and you aren't the only one of this generation either."

Nazag's aura flourished, the piercing howl of Enlightened Bow Force roaring through the surroundings. 

Leonel's gaze narrowed, but he didn't say a word, waiting for Nazag to finish. 

"If I find out that your father has tampered with the White Lion Bow and suppressed its will just so that you can use it to bully those of your own generation, not only I, but the whole of the Constellation Bow Alliance will declare war on the Morales family."

"WIFE! YOUR HUBBY HAS RETURNED!"

Velasco's voice boomed across the Void Palace, causing its mountains to quake and the youths to his back to cover their ears. 

Somewhere deep within the Void Palace, there was one gorgeous woman who rolled her eyes, but outside of her, there were several others that began to scramble. The arrival of Velasco Morales wasn't something any of them took lightly. 

"You kiddos stay here, I have something to take care of."

Velasco flashed a smiled and his figure vanished, leaving the youths who were still in a daze from their near death experience alone. 

When he appeared once more, he was already on the highest peak, his hands in his pockets and his feet suspended in the air. One would have thought that he was the perfect picture of Leonel if not for the fact that unlike his son, Velasco was enamored with dressing as immaculately as possible. Everything on him was prim, proper and trimmed, down to even his individual hair strands. 

"Rosen, why don't you come out here for a chat?"

By this point, the Head of the Unfettered Blade Party had already stepped out. His head tilted up into the skies, his jaw steeled. 

"Velasco, don't do any—!"

Val pointed a finger down and as though commanded by a Diety, Rosen's right arm began to crumble to ash, vanishing into the wind piece by piece. 

Just like that, before the eyes of everyone, a mighty swordsman was crippled. 

"You family should think a bit more before they act this time. Luckily for you, this failure and your arm are enough to calm me for now."

Velasco looked away from Rosen whose forehead was pulsing with veins and face was dripping with sweat. 

"Aiya, I've used too much power with this avatar, it's already about to fade away. WIFE, WAIT FOR ME, I'M COMING!"

With a step, he vanished.
