Leonel stood in silence for a moment before he looked around with a smile; The weight in his chest seemed to have been lowered somewhat; 

He didn't even care to consider what had happened in the last few days; he just felt content at the moment; His only regret was that his brothers had actually gone through so much growing without him; In this time; they had actually gone ahead and stepped into the Seventh Dimension well before him; 

This wasn't too surprising, though; Given the talent of the people of Earth, not to mention the sheer number of resources Earth and its surrounding planets were spewing out constantly, it wasn't too shocking that they could reach such a stage relying on the Conventional Path; 

Although it was slightly regretful that they hadn't taken the God Path; Leonel could tell that they didn't have much of a choice in the matter; When Leonel last met them; they were only at the lower Tiers of the Fifth Dimension; Between then and now; Earth had faced several existential crises; It wasn't as though they could take their time to grow in such a situation; Emna was definitely far luckier in this regard; 

Even so; as Leonel had learned long ago; taking the Conventional Path didn't guarantee one's weakness; If they reforged their foundations with the help of the demon corpses as well; their chances at squeezing out their full potential would skyrocket; 

Plus. the root of talent that separated the people of Earth from others came not from their base Dimension. but rather their Ability Indexes. and from what Leonel could tell from their casual jokes from earlier. his brothers had refined their Ability Indexes to a shocking degree. 

Leonel's expression flickered for a moment and he vanished for a moment; When he reappeared. there were three more young men standing with him. all three of whom carried confused expressions until their eyes suddenly widened; 

Joel. Arnold and Allan weren't as wild with their reactions as the others would be. but even so. it took everything in them not to scream out "ghost!" as well. 

"Ah!" Raj charged over and swept the three into a bear hug before they could react; 

The three couldn't even react. their minds still ringing; Was this an illusion? Had they slipped into such a thing? It wasn't impossible. but hadn't they been in human territory? Unless that was an illusion too? 

It wasn't until they felt Raj's members swinging against their legs that they snapped out of it; 

"Dammit, Raj! Put on some damn clothes!" Joel suddenly roared, pushing away and taking three hurried steps back. 

Raj burst into laughter. his stomach jiggling; His hips gyrated as he rushed after Joel. his entire body seemed to roll in a circular pattern. the sickening slapping noise of skin echoing through the flagship;  Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Don't run Joel. you're hurting my feelings. don't you love me?"

"Fuck!"

Joel turned and booked it; Ever since he and Leonel got caught sleeping in each other's arms and got themselves printed onto a t-shirt. he had been trying his best to avoid moments like this; All his usual composure flew out of the window; And yet. even as he ran. his eyes turned red as a wild grin spread across his face;

It took a while, but the brothers finally sat together once more, circling around a table with smiles on their faces; 

"Really though, cap, when'd you become a god? I'm kinda scared," Franco asked; 

"Ah…" Leonel scratched his head; Honestly, he was only 20% sure that his method would work; The greatest limitation he had thought the silver tablet had was that its resurrection ability would only work on the Zone, but he had never thought that he would gain the ability to manipulate souls which allowed him to circumvent that method; The only limitation he had to contend with now was the Seventh Dimension; 

It was a bit unfortunate that so many lives were permanently lost to give his brothers a chance to live again, but Leonel knew he would make the same choice again even if it was presented to him once more. It was no longer that difficult of a choice to him. 

Leonel didn't really know how to explain it, so he just laid out everything honestly. 

After his brothers heard the truth, they looked toward one another. Didn't that mean that so long as they had enough energy to exchange and their souls didn't disperse, they would be basically immortal until they died of natural causes? 

Of course, Leonel would have to stay alive since he was the only one who could manipulate souls, but this was definitely a game changer. And, they couldn't enter the Eighth Dimension or else the silver tablet wouldn't be able to withstand their resurrection process. 

But this… 

"It feels different from that as well," Drake suddenly said. He was the most conscientious of them all, so he noticed almost immediately. "After I entered the Seventh Dimension, I felt like my progress had slowed to a crawl, but now it feels like all sorts of bottlenecks were suddenly opened up."

Leonel's eyes flickered. 

This wasn't too surprising. The other ability of the silver tablet was clearing bottlenecks and allowing faster progression. After it rebuilt their bodies, it seemed that it had given them a path forward to progress faster as well. 

They were all in Tier 1 of the Seventh Dimension, in fact even after many years, Joel, Arnold and Allan were only in Tier 2. But now, it seemed that there was another chance for them. 

"Unfortunately, we don't have much time to tease out the details of right now. You guys must know that Earth is in a bit of trouble right now, some of which may or may not have been caused by me," Leonel rubbed his nose. 

The nine brothers looked toward one another before bursting into a fit of laughter. "May"? A lot of it was definitely caused by Leonel, but did it matter? They were in this together.
