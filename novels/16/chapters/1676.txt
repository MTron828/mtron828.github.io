Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

Leonel did really want to enter the Archery Faction to see what they had to offer. Mostly, he wanted to see what the highest echelon of bowmen in the Human Domain could do. 

Although it was a bit embarrassing now that he thought about it, Leonel's greatest reference for top tier archery until now was from the "genius" of a family small even in comparison to the Luxnix. It was he who taught Leonel that Bow Force could be used cleverly to change the direction of an arrow mid-flight. 

Outside of this, Leonel had been on his own. This just went to show the sheer amount of talent Leonel had in the bow. Even seemingly without much effort, Leonel had been able to form Enlightened Bow Force. In fact, now, after applying his grandfather's path of the spear to his bow as well, the current level of his Bow Force was on a level most couldn't fathom. 

At this point, it was hard to tell if Ryu would gain anything from the Archery Faction, but he still wanted to see for himself. 

Still, there was a big hurdle he faced. He had been able to enter the Spear Faction for just a one time payment. Apparently this had spread since he was still in debt. However, he obviously wouldn't be able to do the same thing with the Archery Faction. 

In the end, he had to do something that most would rather die than do: exchange Void Merits for Void Points. 

Although such an exchange existed, hardly anyone ever used it due to how difficult it was to gather Void Merits. However, Leonel couldn't be bothered to care very much, and though he was using Aina's Void Merits to accomplish it, she didn't seem to care very much either. 

Unlike others, the two felt that they had almost too many Void Merits. It would be hard to spend them all if they didn't use them like this. 

Once they had waded through the weird looks of the Senate Branch overseer, they began to make the journey toward the Archery Faction. 

This region of the Void Palace wasn't one that Leonel had been in before. It made him realize just how much of this place he hadn't had the opportunity to see. Being the size of several planets put together, there was no doubting the vastness of the Void Palace. 

As Leonel and Aina moved at a leisurely pace, news of what happened just hours ago spread with the swiftness of the wind, but even so, it could only move about so quickly, especially after it was quickly monopolized by the information Factions of the Void Palace. 

Once these powerful Factions in the dark got their hands on such a thing, it was immediately placed at the top of their priority list and classified as top shelf information. This state wouldn't last long, but they didn't need it to. They only needed to suppress it for a few days and rake in the profits. Once the time period passed, it would no longer be as valuable. 

This led to a weird situation where the information spread swiftly for the first few minutes, but was quickly stifled soon after.  𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It seemed quite clear that the job of gathering information was only part of the duties of this information network. Just as important was the job of controlling the flow of information as well. Unless they could maximize their own benefits, what good was it to them if everyone else was well informed? 

As for their targets with this information? Of course they only wanted the patronage of the most prominent figures of the Void Palace as only they would be able to afford the exhorbitant prices. 

The untouchable ranks of the Sector Ranked Disciples, the rest of the Cataclysm Generation, the Morales family Heirs, and, of course… the two lofty existences that seemed to stand alone within the Cataclysm Generation…

The Sword Deity, Amery Suiard. 

The Bow Deity, Nazag Tarius. 

… 

Leonel and Aina finally made it to the Archery Faction. As expected, this region was no less beautiful than the Spear Faction had been. In fact, the Archery Faction seemed to be even better than Leonel remembered the Spear Faction to be. 

There was a formation in the surroundings that staved off Anarchic Force, there was an artificial sun in the sky and radiant rainbow colored clouds. The surroundings were exceptionally peaceful and even the air tasted sweet to breathe in. 

Leonel and AIna didn't gather much attention upon entering as there were many individuals going about their business. The price for just one day of entry was incredibly steep, almost no one had the time to waste the precious hours on people watching, and those that could afford to do such a thing wouldn't be interested in two Tier 1 youths like Leonel and Aina. 

With a quick scan, Leonel saw many familiar buildings. There were training facilities, challenge facilities, resting rooms, and, what he was most interested in, technique centers. 

Leonel had been planning on just making a beeline for these technique centers, however his attention was caught by something else before he could. 

He came to a pause, causing Aina to look toward his side profile with a questioning glint in her eye. 

'So you can do that too…'

Leonel's gaze locked onto a building in the distance. It was in the shape of a pagoda, and just looking at it from the outside, it was difficult to tell how many floors it had. At one glance, it looked like it had seven, but when Leonel blinked it became eight, then nine. It seemed to fluctuate from having as little as three floors to as many as twelve without rhyme or reason. 

Leonel had seen a building like this in the Spear Faction as well and he understood what it was. 

There were two methods of learning techniques in a Weapon Faction. The first was the conventional way. Go to the technique centers, find a description you liked, and exchange for it with money and points. 

The second method, however, didn't require the use of the money. But it was likewise far more troublesome to deal with. 

Leonel took Aina's hand and walked forward, an amused glint dancing in his eyes.
