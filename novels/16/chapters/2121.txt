Leonel took out the Omann family treasure and he was surprised. He had been certain that it would have some relation to Crafting, maybe something that would help Flame Spirits evolve, or maybe a Spirit of a different kind since the Morales had a monopoly on Metal Spirits, but it was nothing of the sort.

'The Omann family actually has such a treasure related to combat? Why are they so weak, then?'

In Leonel's palm lay a bronze disk. It had a slight taper to it that didn't allow it to sit on Leonel's palm perfectly. Its outer edge was a separate mechanism from the inner, the outer being layered with complex runes while the interior was perfectly smooth.

This was yet another surprise, because Leonel had been expecting a consumable item, but then it clicked for Leonel.

Given the plans the Omann had for the Heir Wars, would they even consider the possibility of losing? They were very weak overall outside of their Crafting abilities, and it could be said that Cynthia's appearance and her high combat strength was an anomaly of their family. As such, they didn't invest in large consumable products like the Suiard family's Whetstone or the Morales family's pools.

At the same time, the items they had that could help Spirits evolve were the greatest secrets of their family, they wouldn't easily hand them over to the Morales because even if the Morales lost, in the time that it had spent in their possession, it might be reverse engineered, and they wouldn't stand for that.

So, in the end, they had given this item instead and its introduction was very brief.

Reversing Disk. Inject your Force and it will expel the opposing Force. Resist the change to train your Force.

Leonel's brows jumped. Wasn't this exactly like his Lotus Domain?

His eyes narrowed. This matter definitely wasn't so simple. He activated his Internal Sight and scanned the disk in its entirety, but he didn't find anything out of the ordinary, it seemed to do exactly what the description said.

But Leonel did find something else that was shocking. This was definitely a Life Grade treasure, but more importantly than that, it gave off a sort of familiar energy that Leonel recognized.

'The Cataclysm Zone!'

Leonel's heart skipped a beat. This was definitely the unique air of the Cataclysm Zone, it reminded him of the other treasure he had in his possession.

The Cataclysm Zone wasn't just ahead of their "simulation" in terms of fighting prowess, but their Crafting was on a completely different level. From what Leonel had seen, even their standards for Black, Bronze, Silver and Gold Grade couldn't compare. This is why even until now Leonel was still using the Force Crafting Quill he had gotten from them despite technically being able to forge a "better" one with his Life Grade status.

Though, of course, quills weren't that easy to forge because they required special materials from living creatures.

This disk fell into a similar category. It was of the Life Grade, but it was a Life Grade that existed on the standard of the Cataclysm Zone, and as a result, was in a plane of its own. It was no wonder the explanation was so simple, the Omann didn't believe that the Morales could find more information about it through normal means.

Leonel flickered and vanished. "Anastasia, start an analysis on this treasure."

Reverse engineering was an ability that Anastasia definitely had. In fact, if given enough time, she might even be able to construct a replica. The reason why Leonel had to forge it himself first before she could mass produce things for him was that it greatly simplified the process because then she would only have to copy him.

However, it could be said that Reverse Engineering was the foundation of this mass producing ability.

Although he spoke these words, Leonel still deployed his own Dream World. As Anastasia was completing the task, he was deducing on his own, picking the treasure apart.N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

A diagram appeared in the air, formed of his Emulation Spatial Force. He waved a hand and the disk suddenly split into countless pieces.

Leonel's heart skipped a beat. This overly simple interior that looked like the workings of a watch or an analogue computer... they reminded him of...

Leonel waved a hand and a familiar silver disk flew into his hand.

PAH

His thumb rubbed the outer surface of the disk and he frowned. This was obviously the dictionary that his father had left for him. It had been a long time since he had needed to use it, especially after he gained Wise Star Order and then read all the books and research papers of the Void Palace. He was no longer that na√É¬Øve boy who didn't know anything.

But he had still wanted to take apart this silver dictionary one day. Unfortunately, he still didn't have the skill, he couldn't even spot his father's peak, it was a bit exasperating. It was clear that there were large gaps between Life Grade Crafters as well.

That said... why was the interior of the silver dictionary and this Reversing Disk so similar? Could it be that his father had learned Crafting techniques from the Cataclysm Zone? Or was this just the natural progression of Crafting?

Leonel was a bit frustrated now. He knew that if he asked his father about it, he would be brushed off even in normal situations, let alone right after he had exposed him in front of his mother.

Suddenly, he grinned.

"Hey, what's this disk and what's its relation to the way you were crafted?"

A familiar, somewhat robotic version of his father's voice began to speak. Leonel's grin widened. As expected, the dictionary was just designed to do as it was told and answer questions appropriately. He had thought once before that it had already reached its limit, but maybe that was just him thinking too much.

Usually, highly important information or information that his father thought he was too weak for would be redacted, but without noticing, Leonel's strength had reached a point where most of the information he hadn't been able to access before was laid out bare before him.

[Defensive-Support Treasure Item][Life Grade: First Star Inferior][Uses: Reverse Force, Absorb Force, Dispel Force, Suppress Force, Train Force][Responding to Seed, there is no relation]

Leonel's brows jumped. First Star Inferior? Wasn't that a grading system of the Cataclysm Zone? Why would this silver disk use it?
