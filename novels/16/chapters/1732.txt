[Emperor's Gaze]. 

This was a technique that built off the back of [Emperor's Presence], fusing it instead into a person's eyes. However, unlike the Bow Domain Lineage Factor, this technique wasn't actually designed to see any further, though it could be used to see with more clarity. 

The most basic usage and implementation of this technique was to disperse illusions and to attack the psyche. These both relied on similar principles and managed to accomplish two different things relying on the same foundation. 

Ultimately, illusions were just tricks of the mind and [Emperor's Gaze] could disrupt them. By the same token, it could piggyback off this ability to directly attack the mind of an enemy. 

When Leonel finished assimilating with the technique, his gaze couldn't help but glow, his pale violet irises becoming a deeper hue of violet for a moment before reverting back to their original color. 

This technique, wasn't it very similar to a technique of the Spirituals? In fact, wasn't it precisely because of techniques like this that running into a Spiritual Boss in the Void Tower was no different from drawing dead? 

The human race only dared to battle against Spirituals when they had soul protection treasures on hand. Without them, meeting a Spiritual Race individual of the same and similar Dimensional strength was basically a guaranteed insta-kill. 

Humans had too little research done on the soul and hadn't created any techniques for it themselves. As such, they were all too vulnerable in this respect and could do nothing against those who did have such techniques. 

Just by virtue of gaining [Emperor's Gaze], Leonel had basically become as difficult to deal with as a Spiritual. The only ones who could combat against him were either individuals in the Seventh Dimension who also had Soul Force or Dream Force based Ability Indexes or Lineage Factors, or those who carried around soul protection treasures. 

However, in both instances, these demographics should be somewhat rare. At the very least, one would have to be from a prominent family of at least a Sixth Dimensional territory to carry around a soul protection treasure. 

The other ability of [Emperor's Gaze], to dispel illusions, was also quite good. Leonel was already fairly immune to illusions, but that wasn't the case for those around him. Now he had a tangible method of crushing any illusion he or his allies faced and this could be greatly helpful in the future. 

Leonel's eyes cleared and runes danced and rotated in his irises before slowly fading. He didn't feel like he was anywhere near his limits so he reached forward and tried the fourth. 

A refreshing feeling washed over him again and the runes of another technique imprinted itself onto his soul. 

[Emperor's Seal]. 

Leonel's gaze narrowed. Even the name alone was domineering, however the description of the technique itself was even more soul shuddering. 

[Emperor's Seal] was an application of [Emperor's Aura] and [Emperor's Presence], using the latter, it formulated the former into a grand seal that manifested into the air. This seal would be used to directly suppress, imprison and crush.  Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even if Leonel hadn't had any spatial affinity, he could use [Emperor's Seal] to lock down space similar to what the warships of Shield Cross Stars had done to the Void Palace. Like this, even if someone had a great spatial affinity, it would become useless. 

[Emperor's Seal] was quite similar to a domain-like ability and it functioned on a more ethereal level than Leonel's Gravity Domain. While one targeted the physical body, the other targeted Force and the soul. However, both of them were able to cause physical changes. 

Beneath [Emperor's Seal], even though it ultimately was a suppression of the soul, the body would find it a very difficult move and Force would become extremely sluggish. In the worst case scenario, if the gap was large enough, one would find themselves grinded into meat paste. 

In fact, one of the actions of the [Emperor's Seal] was known as "Rotation". With every rotation, the pressure would increase on the person beneath the seal's might until they could no longer handle it and exploded. 

Leonel took another step forward and touched yet another bubble. 

[Emperor's Edict]. 

As these runes fused with Leonel, his aura became more refined and more dignified. The rotating runes within his irises only grew more complex with every assimilation. 

[Emperor's Edict] was yet another technique that Leonel found very similar, and once again, he gained an entirely new view of it. 

This technique wasn't very different from the one his mother created. It used [Emperor's Seal] to form the boundaries of a world and then it disseminated an Emperor's Edict. This Edict set a rule that had to be followed within the confines of the Emperor's Seal's world. 

If this sounded familiar, that was because it was. It was the very same concept as Leonel's mother's Crystal World technique, one that Leonel hadn't used in a very long time because he simply didn't have the time to assign to mastering it. 

This technique when fully mastered could be extraordinarily powerful. Leonel could set a rule that stated that all metal within his Seal World were brittle. In this situation, if a sword tried to attack him, he could shatter it with the flick of a single finger. 

If he was in a world of water and found himself disadvantaged by the terrain, he could set a rule that stated all water would vanish, and suddenly he would be fighting in the air. 

He could reverse gravity, he could zap away all oxygen, he could even turn all gas in the air into an extremely flammable substance and then light it all on fire with a single thought. 

When taken to its logical extreme, [Emperor's Edict], or Leonel's mother's Crystal World technique were all mind numbingly powerful, and in the hands of someone like Leonel, the possibilities were simply endless. In the face of an Emperor, what right did anyone have to resist?
