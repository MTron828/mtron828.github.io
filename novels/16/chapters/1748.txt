The vitality of a Seventh Dimensional existence was exceptional. even when the Seventh Dimensional existence in question had only taken the conventional path to get to their current level of strength. and sometimes especially so. 

Those that took the conventional path had to temper their bodies twice over and as such the powerful ones among them would sometimes have this advantage even over those who took the God Path; After all, it had to be remembered that not all those who took the Conventional Path were considered to be weak; 

Although Emna's strike could be considered enough to kill almost anyone so long as they weren't like Leonel and had their bodies and souls as two separate existences, the problem was how long it would take; 

A cornered beast was the most dangerous kind of animal, and a Seventh Dimensional existence that knew they were going to die was even worse than a cornered beast; 

Leonel moved fast, but it would still take him three seconds to get there, most of the time of which was spent descending from the flagship; 

Emna realized the problem and retreated immediately. lamenting slightly. but this was already the best that she could do; If she could have aimed for the head instead. she would have done so; But the issue was that the bones of a Seventh Dimensional existence were too incredible; 

Although it looked like she pierced casually through her target's throat. she had actually slipped her Blade Force through the vulnerable disk of the big bellied man's spinal cord. making the resistance minimal; And yet. even so. it took her concentrating a great deal of power in her finger tip just to ensure she pierced flesh; 

It could be said that she was a mad woman; A Fifth Dimensional existence assassinating a Seventh Dimensional existence may have never happened before in the history of the Dimensional Verse. and yet here she was about to succeed; But it also seemed that this success would also cost her life;  𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Despite how fast Emna retreated, she could never be faster than a Seventh Dimensional existence. 

The big bellied man released an infuriated roar. billowing into the skies as though lamenting the fact his life would end like this; Just the wind pressure and sound of the roar alone was enough to burst Emna's eardrums and make her feel as though her brain might turn to slush any moment; 

Her balance was thrown off and Blade Force didn't seem to want to respond to her anymore; Her equilibrium was completely out of wake and the perfect efficiency of her movements were thrown out of the window; 

The big bellied man smashed a palm downward; 

To Emna, it looked no different from a descending mountain; Just the momentum alone made her knees buckle; 

"Move."

The word suddenly echoed in Emna's mind; It was soft and soothing, and somehow also somewhat familiar; But at the same time, they carried an odd sort of power that gave her clarity of mind; 

She regained control of her body just enough for her to leap out of the way; 

But even so; the power of the big bellied man's swipe was too strong; Just the residual impact alone was enough to send her flying into the distance; coughing up several mouthfuls of blood as she felt her entire body nearly collapse; 

Her bones shattered. her inner organs were skewered through. and her eyes rolled into the back of her head. a shuddering seizure rippling through her body. 

She rebounded against the asteroid's face hundreds of meters away; 

The big bellied man snapped his neck toward the direction she flew in; seemingly not feeling the pain of his neck being pierced through at all; He was riding an emotional high as the final seconds of his life ticked by; 

He bent his knees, leaping over with a fierce momentum. 

He crossed half the distance in just a single bound as though the convenience station didn't have even artificial gravity. However. if he had been conscious of what just happened. despair would grip his heart. If it wasn't for his vitality rapidly draining away. how could he only just so far? If he was in peak condition. even jumping double the distance to Emna in a single bound would have been easy. 

Still. in his current state. the big bellied man didn't care. gathering up his strength and bounding forward again. 

He appeared in the skies above Emna, casting a shadow over her. 

Emna's vision was blurry and she could barely see what was happening. She could vaguely feel that a shadow had appeared above her, but she could only hope that it was the shadow of the person that had just saved her. If it wasn't… she would truly be finished. 

Unfortunately for Emna, she wasn't so lucky. 

Three seconds was just too small a time frame to a Seventh Dimensional expert. If they really wanted to, even attacking dozens of times within that span was as easy as breathing. 

Luckily, Leonel didn't need to catch up entirely, he just had to enter rage to effect change. 

Leonel, who was speeding over with his jet black surfboard suddenly raised a hand. Bouncing in the skies like that and falling through the air put the big bellied man in a compromised position. 

Activating his Emulation Spatial Force, Leonel thrust at the back of the falling big bellied man, throwing him off course from his descent onto Emna. 

BANG!

Leonel activated his Starry Light Domain and flickered forward three times, finally catching up and appearing above the big bellied man. 

A spear appeared in Leonel's palm and he struck outward with an undeniable momentum. 

The big bellied man growled and looked upward to meet the strike, but Leonel's gaze flashed. 

Emperor's Gaze. 

To Leonel's astonishment, however, the big bellied man reacted as though nothing had happened as he continued to punch upward. 

Leonel's pupils constricted. This man had a soul protection treasure, and a very good one at that. 

BANG!
