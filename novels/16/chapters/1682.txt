The Force Art surged into Leonel's eyes once again, a familiar loop quickly taking form. By this point, the similarities to the Spear Domain Lineage Factor were all too obvious. But the difference here was that while the changes to his brain for the spear were related to his body, reflexes and muscles, for the bow, they were entirely reliant on his eyes. 

When Leonel looked around this time, however, he couldn't help but be shocked. It suddenly felt as though a two-dimensional world had become three-dimensional. It was such a shocking change that Leonel had to close his eyes, only to open them up again slowly and see an even more exaggerated result. 

It was obvious that the world was three-dimensional, this was something that everyone accepted from the time they were young. However, just because the world was three-dimensional didn't mean that the eyes saw it this way. 

What was three-dimensional to the eye of an individual was just a feedback loop of lighting and shadows, when in reality, all one could ultimately see was a single flat surface. 

It couldn't be helped, vision was simply always limited in this way. A person could only face a single direction at a time and even if you had the full scan of an object in your memories, you couldn't stitch them together to form a new and more substantial representation. 

However, these eyes were different. Leonel could tell that it was no longer a trick of his mind convincing him that the world was three-dimensional. For the first time, he truly felt that the world had depth, not just due to shadows and lighting, but in a more substantial reality. 

When Leonel looked at his hand, it was as though the photons that bounced around it curved in a way that he could see the front, back and sides of it all at once. His mind would then process this image like a three-dimensional graphic designing software and create a perfect replica that would then become the "image" he saw in his mind. 

It wasn't just his hand that was like this either. Whether it was the platform he stood on, the bow in his hand, or the targets in the distance, all of them were like rendered images in Leonel's brain. 

It was a fascinating overload of information. It felt like his eyes were taking snapshots at every conceivable angle and then stitching them all together into a single global image. It was like… his eyes had become Internal Sight. 

Leonel knew that this was an ability that Internal Sight had long ago, but somehow, this felt so much different. 

In reality, if things were taken at face value, Internal Sight was even better. This was because while Internal Sight was called as such, it could translate the other senses to the mind of the user as well. Whether it was smell or touch or hearing, Leonel could use them all though his Internal Sight. However, these eyes only worked with sight and sight alone. 

That said, not all sight was created equal. This was proven just by the fact that Leonel's Starry Spirit Domain was so much more powerful than his Internal Sight despite having a smaller range. Some things could just "see" better than others. 

And these eyes were definitely beyond his Internal Sight in pure sight alone. However, it was beneath his Starry Spirit Domain in the same respect. 

Even so, Leonel wasn't disappointed by this for two reasons.  Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Firstly, with the advancement in his sight, these eyes could see further than his Starry Spirit Domain could. In addition, the stamina drain that it had was far lesser as well. It took a lot out of Leonel to use the full scale of his Starry Spirit Domain, which was why he often only used a small portion of it. But these eyes seemed to work almost no differently from his own eyes. 

The only pain of these eyes was that they didn't stack well with the previous abilities he had gained. If he wanted to use them one at a time, there was no issue. But if he wanted to forcefully use them together, then the stamina consumption would increase. 

Leonel was even more certain that these abilities were meant to be fused into one. In fact, he was sure that if they did fuse, the stamina consumption might even be less than it currently was when he used just a single ability. 

That aside, the second reason he wasn't disappointed was because he had a feeling that this was just the beginning. The next ability, the seventh, would be a qualitative change. That, he was absolutely certain of. 

When Leonel entered the seventh trial, however, he could only frown. He stood in silence for a long time before closing his eyes and taking deep breaths. 

This trial was even more complicated than the last. 

In the previous trial, the targets were erratic and impossible to predict the movement of. They didn't have the mannerisms of humans so Leonel couldn't use his predictive abilities to guess where they would go, and because they had no mass, there was no inertia or momentum for them to care about. 

With these factors compounded, Leonel could only use a brute force method, tiring himself out by putting his 100% into every single release of his bowstring. 

One could imagine how difficult the trial had been if Leonel, even with his current strength, was tired out in doing so. 

But this trial here, if the last one was difficult, was absolutely impossible. 

Not only did it have the exact same structure, but it added a layer of complexity: changing colors. 

​ Leonel's task was to take out the red orbs. If he accidentally hit the green ones, he would lose one of his three lives. If he accidentally hit a blue orb, he would lose immediately. 

The difficulty here was that the color of the orbs was not fixed, they could randomly change their colors at any time seemingly without rhyme or reason. It was even more difficult to predict than their flight paths.
