The Heavy Gravity floors were one of the few that didn't actually require any battle. 

The first layer of difficulty was, obviously, the heavy gravity. The second layer of difficulty was in the so-called "pillars of gravity". These pillars of gravity were regions of this seemingly blank and wide space where the gravity would suddenly multiply by thousands of times and crush you to death in an instant. 

In order to pass these floors, one had to cross this spacious room without dying, and of course, while withstanding the generally higher gravity as well. 

It was safe to say, then, that this was another exceptionally lucky draw for Leonel. Even if he had been in the Fifth Dimension again, he could have crossed this room easily. 

He rose his foot and his figure flickered, taking an approach most saw as suicide on the Heavy Gravity floors. And yet, he did it without even thinking twice. 

Gravity? Why would a member of the Morales family have to fear it?

Leonel appeared on the 20th floor, his mood still quite casual. From what he could tell, in ten floor increments, the Void Tower seemed to jump through two Tiers of strength at a time. The boss of the 10th floor had been a Tier 2 existence, so it was likely that the boss of the 20th floor would be at Tier 4, which meant that the boss of the 50th floor would be Quasi Seventh Dimensional. 

However, this standard was set to the average student of the Void Tower. While average to the Void Tower was considered to be genius level to the greater Human Domain, to the likes of Leonel and the Cataclysm Generation, it was child's play and actually quite weak. 

Of course, things actually weren't quite so simple since the non-boss floors had many enemies of that level to face, while the boss floors themselves faced them off against more concentrated talent. But this was the general gift nonetheless. 

This was why, even standing on the 20th floor, Leonel didn't even feel a need to take out a spear. 

Watching as a Pixie of the Dwarven Race flapped her wings and quickly rose into the air, Leonel only pressed out two fingers, causing a flash of golden Spear Force to rush out so quickly that it was almost impossible to track with the naked eye. 

Before the Pixie could even get into place to draw her bow, she froze, her eyes going blank as she fell from the skies, dead.

The silence was exceptionally heavy. It seemed that whether it was Leonel or Aina, both of them had no intention of allowing these matters to settle down quietly. Although Leoenl had failed to break into the all-time rankings again after the first nine floors, he didn't waste any time crushing the first time rankings one after another. The worst part was that he didn't even seem to be putting in his full effort. 

Even after crossing the 30th floor and beginning to face enemies at Tier 7 and even Tier 8, they didn't seem to be putting in much effort at all. They crushed them one after another, their times still being absolutely ridiculous. 

By the time Leonel and Aina entered the 40th floor, any smiling and jeering that had been present had become a solemn silence. 

Back then when the Cataclysm Generation had first entered, the fact that Tier 1 existences could battle against Tier 7 and above existences was hard for most to fathom, but they had slowly come to accept it over time. This was just the new standard for absolute genius. 

Seeing a new pair of individuals accomplish the same thing, but seemingly with even greater ease, was absolutely shocking and they weren't sure how to wrap their heads around it. 

The likes of Wymlan and Quoron had on exceptionally ugly expressions. Although they could climb to these floors as well, and even make it look quite easy too, they were in Tier 6 already. When they were in Tier 1, they couldn't have hoped to be so casual. 

By the time one entered the Sixth Dimension, taking even one step forward was incredibly difficult. This was why even after 20 years of being gone, a minority had crossed into the Seventh Dimension. 

In reality, for the vast majority of those in the Human Domain, entering the Sixth Dimension was nothing more than a dream. As for the geniuses who could make it to the Void Palace, entering the Seventh Dimension was just as much of a dream to them. 

Every step was arduous and difficult. But likewise, the benefits for taking such steps was also outstanding and one gained large amounts of power for each step you took. 

Crossing levels to do battle in the Sixth Dimension should be extraordinarily difficult… So why did they make it look so easy?!

Leonel's and Aina's names flooded the rankings. By the 40th floor, each of them had secured 120 Void Merits a month at a minimum, and that was just considering the current rankings and not the all time rankings. If the latter was included, the totals would be even more exaggerated. And yet, they showed no signs of stopping. 

… 

Leonel entered the 41st floor, a familiar charismatic smile on his face. 

'It seems that I should get a little bit more serious.'

He reached out a hand causing a surge of Emulation Spatial Force to manifest. Soon, it solidified, forming a jet black spear. 

A pulse of light radiated from Leonel's forehead and a golden crown formed and wrapped around his head, its centerpiece being a radiant golden spear. 

Leonel stood in a world of a vast ocean. As far as even his own eyes could see, there was nothing but crystal blue waters. 

Until, that is, the skies began to rumble and the water began to churn.
