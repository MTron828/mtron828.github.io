Every action Leonel took seemed to remind him of the words he had spoken back then. Every genius that fell caused another pang of regret to light their hearts, another surging pain and unwillingness coursing through their veins.

It was at that moment that some began to realize that Leonel had done this on purpose. Every time he killed, they would be reminded of their words, reminded of what could have been, reminded that everything that was happening now was their fault.

Whether they acknowledged that in the future and didn't blame Leonel himself was entirely unknown. However, what was certain was that they would know the truth in their hearts.

Armand had never wanted to enter the Heir Wars to begin with, it was they who had made him, they who had ignored his wishes. He could have been home right this moment, lounging as he normally did. But now he was lying in a pool of his own blood.

"Ruthless, too ruthless." Ancestor Golddark said coldly. This time, he didn't bother to seek an answer from the Morales family, he only said this to stoke the flames. His Golddark family wouldn't be the only one to suffer, and if there was an opportunity to retaliate, they also wouldn't be alone.

However, when he glanced over at the Morales Ancestor, all he saw was pride in their eyes and sneers on their lips. This group of madmen didn't seem to give a damn.

"Gather up," Leonel's voice called out as he lowered his gaze from the skies.

"We'll begin the Silver-Grade upgrade now"

"Yes!"

The Skies family members took deep breaths, but they weren't nearly at the end of their ropes yet. They had had overwhelming numbers, and though they had to team up for victory, this had helped them to save quite a lot of energy as well. They were prepared.

They reformed their teams and gathered up. With Silver-Grade threats on the horizon, they would once again have a tough challenge ahead of them, and this time Leonel didn't have any terrain changers to use to his advantage. Even so, their numbers, with the support of his brothers, him and Aina, should be enough.

The upgrade challenge was triggered and the battle ensued. As expected, it was far more challenging than the first time around. The Skies family members, at least the majority of them, were only about as strong as Bronze-Grade threats, as if they could fight such an existence one on one.

Only about 10% of them were as good as a Silver-Grade threat.

The Oryx were different in this regard, which was why they were such a surprise to the people of the Human Domain. This relatively unknown race of people were mostly Silver-Grade threats with about 10% of them being Gold-Grade threats.

This aside, given the circumstances, it was unsurprising that the challenge was tough. This time, it was Leonel and his group that was at a disadvantage in number. Not only were they disadvantaged in terms of numbers, but they were also weaker overall.

If Leonel's earlier actions had seemed insane, this was even beyond just that.

His eagerness to gather a third city to complete the fusion was excessive, this was especially so given the fact that if he was struggling so much with a Silver-Grade upgrade, there was absolutely no way he would be able to deal with the Gold-Grade upgrade challenge anyway.

Not only would the numbers they faced in the Gold-Grade upgrade challenge be at least a hundred times more than the around 10 000 of the Silver-Grade, because it was a fusion path he was taking, it would be three times more than even that. On top of that, they would all be Gold-Grade threats!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

By this logic, it made no sense for Leonel to be pushing the limits like this.

He shouldn't be able to enter the Gold-Grade anytime soon anyway.

However, at that moment, Leonel took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

When they opened again, the fatigue within them was clear, but the determination was even clearer. These next few steps would be the ultimate deciding factor.

Three silver Stars appeared to Leonel's back once more and he roared into the skies. If one was standing to his back, it would be possible to see a silvery-gold glow shimmering through the back of his neck.

At that moment, one after another, countless troll beasts appeared in the skies, each valiantly wearing a coat of violet armor.

Dozens, then hundreds, then thousands, then over ten thousand.

They had hardly settled down when Leonel's aura rose again. Roars echoed across the skies as one Earth Dragon after another began to appear, their enormous bodies blotting out the skies. They, too, looked exceptionally valiant donning their own violet armor, their presences menacing as their hundreds of blade-like legs pierced down from the skies above.

Leonel huffed and puffed, veins popping up across his forehead.

At that moment, he used a kill exchange and summoned Little Blackstar. The little guy was only about three feet long, but he seemed to instantly become the center of the battlefield.

"Crush them," Leonel said lightly.

He threw everything he had forward. It was maybe only now that those watching understood that Leonel hadn't run out of trump cards just yet. In fact, the only new ability he had displayed just now was the summoning of a beast creature they had never seen before. The little mink looked unremarkable, but the moment he entered the fray, he didn't kill in batches any smaller than ten.

Under the control of Leonel, Silver-Grade spirit constructs crashed against Silver-Grade beasts, monsters and trolls.

The pressure against the Skies family members was alleviated instantly. With Leonel's spirit constructs taking the frontlines, their job couldn't have been easier. They looked for vulnerable creatures and killed them while they were occupied.

Strikes of lightning spread across the battlefield and the battle soon came to an end.

Leonel took deep breaths, his body seemingly reaching its limits as well. His mind couldn't help but wonder. This sort of feeling was created using nothing but Dream Force, that he was certain of... What was the secret behind it? And could he replicate it?

Leonel claimed the city after spending millions to expand its region to 400

kilometers as well. His gaze flickered for a moment when he saw what the territory map had to offer.
