Chapter 912: Forget Lt

The destruction Leonel had just caused was enough to, ironically, put the fear of god in anyone. It was just an instinctual, ingrained fear that one would find it hard even to face this Force, let alone fight against it.

The truth was that as Leonel’s body grew through the Dimensions, so too did his Scarlet Star Force. To have a Force known to cause the greatest destruction in his body made it a miracle that Leonel was even alive at this point. But, that was the benefit he gained for having been born with such an Innate Force Node.

One might wonder, then… Did this mean that Leonel would never be capable of using his Scarlet Star Force? If it increased in difficulty to use every time he broke through, then what was the point of being born with such a Force Node to begin with?

The reality, though, didn’t quite work like this. It could be said that rather than Scarlet Star Force shackling Leonel, it was actually the other way around.

For a Force to be ranked amongst the top ten of a powerful Force like Star Force, one could imagine that this wouldn’t just be for lower Dimensions, but especially so for higher Dimensions. In fact, the ranking system was based on the highest Dimension said Force could reach.

Scarlet Star Force was essentially a high Dimensional Force, forced to restrain itself in Leonel’s body to an artificially lower Dimension. This meant that every time Leonel broke through, Scarlet Star Force was actually just undoing chains Leonel placed on it.

What was the difference between this and Scarlet Star Force growing with Leonel? The difference was that eventually, the Scarlet Star Force would return to its original state and stop outgrowing Leonel. When that day came, Leonel would finally be able to use the gift he was born with without reserve.

For now, though… Even in the Fifth Dimension, Leonel felt like he was on the verge of dying after having used it for just a small moment. Still, the result shock even Leonel himself.

Leonel had been racking his brain, trying to figure a way out of this. But, he knew that even his current Dream Force wasn’t enough to counter that seal. In the end, he had no choice but to bring out one of his greatest trump cards.

What he hadn’t expected, though… Was to almost cause the destruction of the planet.

Leonel had felt it. Had he been able to hold out for about ten more seconds, he could have caused the entire planet to implode.

Of course… asking for ten more seconds when he had barely just held it for a split moment just now was far too much to ask. But, the reality was shocking nonetheless. And, it happened to be a reality that these cloaked figures had all witnessed.

Even as lava overflowed from the split in the earth, they only had eyes for Leonel himself.

“Innate Force Node, and a very powerful one at that. I have a feeling that you can’t use that attack more than once, right? I wonder what kind of state your body is in right now.” The man chuckled. “Who asked you to blaspheme a Three-Layer Hand of the Evergreen Goddess. I would take a step back and let them hunt you down to the death, but they won’t mind if I present your corpse to them with a small piece missing… right?”

The lead cloaked figure stared at Leonel as though he was looking at a priceless treasure.

Leonel paused practically mid cough.

“What did you just say?”

His tone was icy to an extreme. As ridiculous as it had been for the temperature to drop previously, it was even more ridiculous now.

The heat of Scarlet Star Force still hung in the air. Even now, the foliage of the trees in the surroundings would spontaneously combust from time to time, erupting in a new rain of fire that would only make the situation worse.

As though that wasn’t enough, lava continuously pooled out from the split in the earth, forcing the youths in the surroundings to scatter and run, breaking the formation of the three organizations with absolute ease.

And yet, the temperature still plummeted.

Leonel’s gaze locked onto the man before him, his fury from before still not having faded before this man dared to poke at the flames.

When Leonel had learned that something of his had been taken out of his body when he was too young to do anything about it, he had already been furious. That anger wasn’t satiated by his father helping him to regrow his Innate Force Node. Rather, it was simply stored away.

Leonel didn’t care about the Innate Force Node in all reality. After all, he hardly got to use it and had been living life just fine without knowing it existed. However, the principle of it all infuriated him to an extreme.

He had a feeling that if he hadn’t had such a powerful father, wouldn’t he be dead right now? Wasn’t this yet another example of the people of the Dimensional Verse doing as they pleased to the weak? Prattling on about survival of the fittest, etc etc.

Leonel had no idea whether his parents had already made those who did this to him pay or not, nor did he care. Even if they had, this anger wouldn’t fade because it was rooted in something deeper than just himself. And yet, this cloaked bastard, come from nowhere, had actually thought to poke at that open wound.

It was difficult to see the face of the cloaked figure, but Leonel could almost feel his smile spread out into a wide grin. His chest puffed out, his gaze flared with derision, his contempt was so palpable that it hung in the air like a foul odor.

“I said…”

“Forget it. Just die.” Leonel said coldly.

An enormous sniper rifle appeared in Leonel’s hands. Before anyone could react, a beam of blinding golden light cut through the air.

The cloaked man didn’t even get a chance to finish his words before his head was eviscerated into nothing, his headless corpse teetering back and forth before failing to maintain its balance and plopping to the ground.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
