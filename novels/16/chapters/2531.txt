Chapter 2532 [Bonus] Karma

[Bonus chapter courtesy of Mr. Ham <3 4/6]

The Nomad's eyes opened wide. He didn't expect such a thing to happen, and he definitely didn't expect that if it should that the culprit would be Leonel of all people.

In truth, he had thought that the humans had come in with some huge trump card. They had moved quite a bit to deal with them. These runes floating before his forehead weren't even the start of it. In reality, the games had begun even before Leonel activated it all.

They had wasted a great deal of Contribution Points on a treasure that could allow them to avoid random teleportation. As a result, they had all appeared in the same mountain range.

Clarence had ended up being quite unlucky as a result. He didn't lose his life at the hands of just a single Nomad, but rather over a dozen of them.

Eventually, they had chosen to spread out after their leader helped each one of them catch a Tier Five to bolster their strengths immediately, thus solidifying their advantage.

Their task now was to each claim a Tier Six while their leader went off to fight a Tier Seven. Then, they would regroup using a similar method to what they used previously and steam roll the competition.

Everything was going smoothly, and though he seemed to be at a disadvantage now, that was already to be expected. He was just about ready to launch his counter attack...

And then Leonel appeared.

In truth, they had originally entered just for the Contribution Points. It was a large amount and they wanted them. So long as they were at least second place, they would recoup their bet and then some.

However, when Leonel appeared, that focus had shifted, but not as much as one might think.

They knew that wielding the Life Tablet was beyond them and their main goal was still pretty much the same. According to their leader, they were only to deal with Leonel if the opportunity presented itself.

To think it would present itself like this.

Ovrian had already stopped taking the humans seriously. Clarence's easy death had already proved to him that they had done all this preparation for the others, not the humans. In the end, they were just paper tigers and they had no real preparation at all.

To think they'd send a Sovereign to die.

It was a shame, though. If this was Leonel's real body, they would probably capture him and train him up. Then, when he reached the Ninth Dimension they'd kill him and use his Essence to see if they could create a Dream Sovereign of their own.

The odds were slim, but it was possible.

Still, the Life Tablet was worth more than any of that.

Ovrian leapt backward with a sneer on his face. At the same moment, the Tier Six Snowy Tailed Fox broke free of their battle and rushed right for Leonel. He knew that this would happen the moment Leonel appeared. The top priority of the "king" of this peak or any of the others was always the Forgetful Orb. Leonel would have to spit it back up quickly.

He stopped, crossing his arms over his chest with a sneer on his face.

And that was precisely why he was caught completely unprepared.

Right then, the fox that had been charging toward Leonel suddenly stopped. Without even looking back, one of its tail descended from the skies and whipped against Ovrian's body, breaking his spin in two.

Ovrian was entirely unprepared, he had been waiting to see what would happen to Leonel, but...

He felt his vision blurring. Suddenly a force grabbed at the White Stone Elephant stuck in his Ethereal Glabella and it began to inexplicably rampage as well.

A huge suction of Dream Force made his mind blur with incomprehensible thoughts and by the time he could even barely see again, his Dream Force was already dissipating rapidly.

However, just when he thought it was over, he felt a tight hand holding his neck. He found that he was rapidly falling down the side of the mountain, and he was in Leonel's hands as they fell together. Even if he wanted to, his Dream Force refused to dissipate entirely and fear suddenly took hold of his heart.

"Tell me," Leonel suddenly asked. "How many people do you think are watching this Challenge?"

The Nomad's mind iced over. He had no idea, but he was sure it was many. Challenges were rare, and there was the Life Tablet involved. There were likely even God Races watching right now, even if it was just a small number.

"You probably had a good time humiliating the Human Race, didn't you?"

Leonel asked this with a smile, but for some reason Ovrian just felt chillier and chillier.

"You know, I don't really care about the differences between Races. To me, a life is a life. You probably think I'm speaking nonsense, but I've given up real, tangible benefits before because of those beliefs, and I'd do it again."

Ovrian didn't know why the words of this young man were striking him so close to heart, to his soul. He wasn't being moved by them. Rather, he just couldn't feel anything other than fear. Real, tangible, unbridled fear.

And then it struck him.

Dream Force.

How was the ability of his young man to impose his will on the world so powerful already? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Leonel landed on the ground.

"But every one of you keeps provoking me."

"It wasn't me!" Ovrian suddenly squeezed out.

"Oh? But I never mentioned anything," Leonel laughed. "What wasn't "you", exactly?"

"I... I..."

The Dream Force in the surroundings rippled beneath Leonel's landing.

"It's fine, I've already guessed most of it. This mountain range has so few existences of a truly powerful tier. It took me two hours just to find enough to reach this level. That beast in your forehead probably isn't the only one your group caught, huh?"

Leonel's smile faded, a deep indifference returning.

"I hope you aren't reincarnated as a human in your next life. Wouldn't that make Karma too on the nose?"

Ovrian died screaming.
