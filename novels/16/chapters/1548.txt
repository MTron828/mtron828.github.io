The clouds above had suddenly become a very quiet place. The only one speaking was Avras who had suddenly become like a little boy trying to seek encouragement from his mother. But not a single person dared to snicker or laugh.

Mistress Oliidark and the others of the Oliidark family didn't know how to take this situation on properly. If they tried to protect Leonel now, wouldn't that make them an enemy of a Fiend power? They couldn't even handle a High Class organization, how could they possibly face off against a behemoth even the Great Families respected?

Athrae, though, as air headed as ever, had been sobbing about the death of Sebastian and Slaton. But when she saw such a pretty woman in Leonel's arms, she seemed to forget about it all, her eyes looking forward in shock.

For some reason, even though she had spent so much time saying the most disparaging things about Leonel, she felt a wave of jealousy. It was as though Leonel was her toy to throw away and pick up as she pleased, but now someone had actually dared to take it away from her without her consent.

"Grandma, this isn't fair. Can you—!"

Mistress Oliidark slapped her hand over her granddaughter's lips. It was so forceful that it might as well have been a real slap.

Athrae was stunned into silence. The slight stinging on her face and lips almost made her tear up again, if she wasn't so surprised that she couldn't even think of a next move to make in the first place.

Mistress Oliidark knew her granddaughter too well. If she said some nonsense now, even their attempts to salvage the situation might not be worth much of anything.

…

Back in the High Class Sector, Leonel and Aina were still chatting without a care in the world when the youths of the Sacred Light Pavilion came down.

When Stophiar saw the scene below, he didn't even know how to react. One of the many men that Aina had suddenly grown very cold toward was none other than himself.

One would think that Stophiar would know enough not to go after a young woman of the Endless Twilight Pavilion. However, the Sacred Light Pavilion had quite a special position amongst the Human Class powers, and as their head disciple, Stophiar was in a unique position to maximize those benefits.

There was a pipeline from the Sacred Light Pavilion, to the Fiend Class, and then the Laevis of the Great Families. 

Rules were only things meant to be followed by the weak, and as scary as Pavilion Head Ophelia seemed, there was still a gap between her and the foundation of the Great Families. As any hot blooded male, Stophiar believed that so long as he proved his worth, the Laevis family would deal with Ophelia for him until he became powerful enough to deal with her himself. 

Of course, these were all naïve ravings. He was comparable to some Fiend Class talents, but he wasn't enough to make the likes of the Laevis family do anything for him, let alone offend such a powerhouse. 

But the fuel of testosterone and foolishness was strong when a beauty entered the picture. 

However, even though his face twisted, Leonel and Aina didn't even look in his direction. 

"Forget about me," Leonel tried to dodge the scrutiny he was under, "didn't you just try to attack me? Why don't we talk about that. You can't even recognize your own husband?"

"You smell diff—what's that supposed to mean? I don't remember having a husband."

"I smell different?"

"Yes, you do."

Leonel frowned, his head turning, suddenly feeling annoyed by a particular gaze. 

Those that had been watching were used to a calm and collected Leonel. He might be somewhat cold, but his actions were always restrained. However, at the moment, he was like a completely different person. 

"Can you piss off?"

Stophiar's face froze. He had been staring unrestrainedly, but that was because he was used to doing as he pleased and he was more surprised by this outcome than anything else. 

Women of Aina's caliber were like precious gems to most families. Unlike some women who might be promised away before they were even born, talents on this level were carefully nurtured and well protected until maturity, only then might they get married, and that was only if they weren't in an organization like the Eternal Twilight Pavilion. 

The odds that Aina would have a man should be practically 0, and yet now that very man was telling him to piss off without the slightest fear for his background. 

"Forget him, come, come," Aina spoke, suddenly remembering something. She grabbed Leonel's hand and dragged Leonel away. 

Uvile and Silyn only now broke out of their shocked states and tried to call after Aina, but Aina only waved and ignored them. It was as though she had completely forgotten about everything now that Leonel was here.  ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

…

Not long later, Leonel and Aina had made it to the top floor. Much like the Middle Class, a Tablet hovered, but this time, Leonel saw a silver one. 

He thought that he might get the next portion of the dark half of his Lineage Factor, but he was wrong. Instead, what he saw was something that made his heart skip a beat. 

'A Union of Light and Darkness will reveal the Twelve Pointed Star…'

The worlds seemed far bolder now, but Leonel's Lineage Factor trembled in his veins, salivating as though it hadn't eaten in weeks. 

This Silver Tablet wasn't the dark half, it was the light half. It contained the next step beyond his Starry Tailed Fox Lineage Factor. And, Leonel knew exactly what was within it. 

The Twinkling Light Bear Lineage Factor and the Golden Tiger Lineage Factor, both Eighth Dimensional Lineage Factors that carried a weight and power that was near unfathomable. 

However, Leonel quickly restrained himself. Since Aina had brought him here, didn't it mean that she saw something important to her? Leonel didn't mind giving up the opportunity and helping Aina exchange for what she needed instead if it was important. 

"What do you see?" Leonel asked.
