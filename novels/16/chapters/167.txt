"You‚Ä¶" Pisces swallowed her anger and regained her calm. "‚Ä¶ Are you sure that's the decision you want to make? I know that you are very powerful, but this is a matter of life and death for us all, do you understand this?"

Leonel could already sense several hostile gazes aimed toward him. The only ones who didn't seem to have this reaction were Seer and Precious Moment, along with Roaring Black Lion, Thunderous Clap, and, surprisingly, King of Seas. It seemed the last took quite a bit of pleasure in Leonel rejecting Pisces.

Of course, there was also Flowing Wind who seemed excited by this turn of events. Only now would she be able to watch the best show.

Calming Wind furrowed her brows, looking toward Leonel with disappointment.

Leonel shook his head. These people really wanted to fight him? ùíÇll new stùíêries at n0ve/lbi/ùíè(.)cùíêm

He had to admit, he really couldn't beat them all. This space was too restricted, for one. And, secondly, his body still hadn't recovered from making sure they all got here safely, ironically. Of course, if he wanted to run, he didn't think that any of them had the speed to keep up with him, but, without the map of the tunnels, there was no telling whether or not he would run into a dead end before he escaped.

Of course, he had already memorized the path they took to get here, but that led outside. What was he going to do, run back to those beast legions? Who knew what kind of wild nonsense was happening out there right now?

Ultimately, he really didn't have the ability to deal with all of them.

Though he was disappointed in what was happening, he could understand where they all were coming from. Those from the Southern Lookout still had a somewhat jaded opinion of him. It was only due to his recent actions that those ill feelings began to turn around somewhat.

However, humans were creatures who often fell victim to group think and confirmation bias. Whatever good impression they had of Leonel was easily overridden by his actions now. To an outside observer, his actions did indeed seem selfish.

From one perspective, Leonel didn't have to give his things to others if he didn't feel like it. But, this time, this matter involved all of their lives. How could they just sit idly by?

"Indomitable, don't be so shameless. This isn't about you." Ruptured Artery, who already hated Leonel to the core to begin with, couldn't help but to stand out at this moment.

The rowdiness of the group of youths seemed to only grow with each passing moment. Pisces didn't even have to say a word and many had already defended her position for her.

"That's enough, this doesn't need to devolve to violence." Calming Wind finally stood from her seated position, walking toward Leonel.

"Indomitable, please think of the overall situation. Is it really appropriate for you to act in this way?"

Leonel was starting to feel a bit annoyed. After all, he was human. As much as he wanted to be 'understanding', he had limited patience as well. But, still, since he knew their intentions weren't overly sinister, he kept whatever bubbling dissatisfaction he had down.

Instead of exploding with anger, he flipped a palm, allowing a familiar silver disk to appear.

"Scan her ability." Leonel said calmly.

[ *Ping* ]

[ Generating nomenclature‚Ä¶ ]

[ Evolution Stage: Tier 6 Black ]

[ Evolution Type: Elemental ]

[ Evolution: Water Sense, Water Manipulation ]

[ Water Sense: Greater affinity for Water Elemental Force. 50% boost in comprehension and power in using water based Force Techniques.? ]

[ Water Manipulation: Control over the Water Element. ]

Pisces widened her eyes. Even the Slayer Legion Lookout hadn't been capable of giving such sharp analysis of her ability. What was going on? And, more importantly, what was Leonel's purpose?

"What is the likelihood she would gain the water metamorphosis ability upon absorbing the coy fish's Beast Crystal?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ Replying to Seed, Father Overlord did not program this function into the dictionary. Once you are skilled enough, it will be possible to upgrade the dictionary. ]

Pisces, whose heart had constricted, sighed a breath of relief. Her smile bloomed once more as she felt Leonel's display had failed. What would he do now that his little trick was going nowhere?

Leonel, seemingly having expected this, though, didn't show much of a reaction.

"What are the chances of mutating an ability upon the ingestion of a Beast Crystal?"

It seemed that the dictionary wasn't able to perform ultra specific tasks. Leonel had a feeling that his father purposely created it this way. Like this, he would be able to gain supplementary knowledge without relying on the dictionary to do every and anything for him.

[ *Ping* ]

[ Replying to Seed, without a Crystal Absorption Technique, the likelihood is 1 in 10 000. With a Crystal Absorption Technique, the odds are closer to 1 in 10. ]

Pisces' expression, which had just regained some color, paled once again. She definitely didn't have such a technique, or else she definitely wouldn't have reacted this way. But, after a moment, she recovered again.

"I get it, you've proved your point." Pisces said calmly. "But, compared to you who has a 0% chance, my odds are still better."

Those who had begun to falter after hearing the odds steeled their hearts. Pisces was right. A 1% in a 1% chance was still better than a 0% chance.

Leonel pretended as though he hadn't heard Pisces.

"What are the chances a Force Crafter has in extracting a specific ability from a Beast Crystal?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ A Force Crafter with a Crystal Spirit Familiar has a 100% chance. All other Force Crafters have a percentage chance depending on their skill and their strength in comparison to the beast the crystal was taken from. ]

"What are the lowest odds?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ Replying to Seed, about 10-20% as long as the Beast Crystal shares its Dimensional Grade with the Force Crafter. If trying to extract an ability from a higher Dimensional creature, 0%. ]

"Am I a Force Crafter?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ Yes. ]

"What are my odds of success?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ Taking Seed's ability into consideration, Seed has a 78% chance of success. ]

"And if I awaken my Metal Synergy Lineage Factor?"

[ *Ping* ]

[ That would allow Seed to take greater advantage of the senses of Seed's Metal Spirit which would boost the chance of sensing the ability in question. In this case, it will be about 92% ]

The more Leonel spoke, the paler Pisces became. It was as though she could see the Beast Crystal she thought of in her dreams slipping away.
