BANG!

Aina felt a small gasp of air jet out from her body as her back smashed against the wall of Leonel's room. The impact was so fierce that the wall cracked, leaving a small crater that just barely fit her petite body.

However, before she could catch her breath, she felt herself being enveloped, Leonel's lips suffocating her.

Aina felt her clothes being ripped away, her body swaying like a boat in a storm under the whims of Leonel.

A heat seared her chest, her heart boiling. Someone else might have felt uncomfortable beneath Leonel's smoldering heat. But, to her, it felt as though she was drifting on cloud nine.

Her body took in the assault with open arms. Everything from Leonel's roughness, to the strength of his hands, to the coldness in his eyes made her shiver. She felt an excitement the likes of which she never had before, an excitement that even somewhat faintly surpassed all the orgasms Leonel had helped her experience until now.

When Leonel dragged her away from the Selection, fury still lighting his eyes, she hadn't known exactly what to expect. But, when Leonel actually threw her against a wall, the small gasp that came from her mouth registered like a struggle for air in her mind, but the reality was that it came out almost like an excited squeal.

It was the kind of sound that captured the hearts of men, latched on, and refused to let go, squeezing until they lost all rationality while hovering between a line of life and death.

Such a small impact hardly even jarred Aina's inner organs, let alone caused her any harm. The training she put herself through made these walls they were cratering, the furniture they were smashing and the floors they were collapsing seem like nothing more than child's play.

As though a pair of wild beasts, the couple seemed to unleash their frustration onto one another.

Aina's nails clawed into Leonel's back, leaving bloody streaks even his Metal Body couldn't defend against. She sheered through is Tier 4 defenses as though a hot knife through butter.

Leonel's blood seeped into her nails, subconsciously being drawn into her body. But, the result was far beyond Aina's expectations. The instant Leonel's blood clashed with her own, a deep moan left her lips, her pelvis grinding against the bulge in Leonel's boxers. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Leonel's blood was like a drug pumping through her veins. It carried a scorching heat and a soothing mellow. It was a dichotomy of feelings that almost perfectly meshed with the feeling of Leonel's tongue in her mouth.

In that instant, as though being burned by hot coals, Aina's curse screeched.

Pain Aina had experienced for a lifetime suddenly retreated into the depths of her body, fleeing from Leonel's blood.

However, Aina hardly seemed to notice. She continued to greedily absorb Leonel's blood, feeling as though the two of them were finally fusing into one.

At that moment, Aina realized that she loved Leonel, loved Leonel so much that it left a throbbing pain in her chest.

Her body began to enter its real form.

Her slender legs, wrapped around Leonel's waist, became longer. Her breasts, pushing against the fabric of her chest band, threatened to rip out a path for themselves even without Leonel's input. Her scars already retreated, leaving a visage so perfect behind that the energies of the world seemed to sing.

Her hips became fuller, her bottom rounder, her hair longer...

Leonel's mind was too calculative to not notice these changes and he also immediately understood what was happening. His heart thrummed out of his chest, rebounding against his rib cage and sending vibrations to Aina's own.

The heat in Leonel's lower belly continued to rise. His rushing blood made his cock so hard that it sprung out from the elastic bands of his boxers.

Aina felt the scolding heat touch her inner thighs, her body trembling with excitement. Her amber eyes brightened into a luscious gold, an overwhelming mental dominance being exuded from her body.

She pushed forward, her slender legs touching the ground as she pushed Leonel into the opposing wall. Her strength was so great that it completely collapsed. However, she didn't seem to notice as her cherry lips enveloped Leonel's, her graceful legs stepping out from her pants with an elegance that was impossible to match.

The skin tight, black panties beneath completely outlined her silhouette. But, Leonel only got to see the enticing sight for only a split moment before he felt that soft, small pink tongue slide into his mouth.

From being just 5'7, Aina had grown to over 6'0 tall, leaving her just three or four inches shorter than Leonel. Rising just a bit on her tippy toes, she was able to taste those lips she couldn't get enough of.

However, her dominance didn't last for long before she found herself being hoisted into the air again. A sturdy hand ripped her chest band away.

The healthy bounce of two fleshly mounds was cut short as they pressed flush against Leonel's chest.

The couple left devastation in their wake, a trail of destruction following after them as they somehow traveled from room to room of the Segmented Cube.

"I can't… I can't take it anymore…" Leonel's hoarse growl made Aina shiver.

At the moment, she was perpetually releasing a sort of mental coercion that even Leonel wasn't immune to. The instant Aina's curse was suppressed, it felt as though her Soul Force had become no weaker than even Leonel's own. But, rather than being tailored for computation, Aina's Soul Force seemed to be able to cast the mind into a state of absolute obedience, as though the whole world should call her Queen.

Aina's hips shifted, one hand wrapped around Leonel's neck, she used the other to slide her skin tight panties off.

With the soft sound of skin slapping against skin, Leonel felt his cock gently split the delicate folds of skin so soft his mind went blank.

Aina blushed profusely. "Do you… have a condom?"

Leonel choked on air.
