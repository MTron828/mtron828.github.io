"Fuck! Young Miss Swan, how can your Swan City be this useless?! You've made no progress at all?!"

Raynred appeared on the battlefield, cackling. He didn't have a flying treasure like Leonel, nor did he have any ability to do so on his own, so he could only stand atop one of the Province's many collapsed buildings, using laughter to push away the very fear he had been feeling for so long.

He had no idea about the changes to Earth's people and his only knowledge of them was in battling them in a weakened state. So, seeing the mighty Swan City struggle so greatly against a single Fort that wasn't even comparable to half The Capital gave him a great sense of amusement.

Of course, a portion of his hearty laughter was reserved due to the fact Young Miss Swan had rejected his advances many years ago. So, seeing her struggle despite the fact the Swan family was supposedly so powerful left him in a good mood.

Knowing Raynred, though, it was obvious things weren't so simple. A union of a City and a Power would never happen. So really, he had only wanted to have some... immoral fun with Young Miss Swan. And, as the young Heiress of such a City, how could she allow her purity to be tainted in such a way?

Raynred may have twisted the matter in his mind, painting her as a stuck up bitch. But the reality was very far from this.

Still, Raynred wasn't exactly the picture of gentlemanly ideals. Was it really so surprising he had such thoughts?

Swan City had always been a rival to Keafir City. Although their current City Lord wasn't a match for the dead Anared's father, Syl and Young Miss Swan were always at a head. In fact, Leonel had witnessed this personally.

With such strength, it was no wonder Swan City was tasked with handling Earth's third ranked Province, Royal Blue.

Unfortunately, what was previously an easy battle had suddenly become difficult to even keep a foothold in. In fact, it didn't seem like it would be long until Swan City was being sieged rather than the other way around.

Young Miss Swan's attention had been focused on her father who was battling valiantly below, wearing his signature white armor. But, hearing Raynred's voice, many on the battlefield couldn't help but look in his direction. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The young Heiress frowned.

'When did the Powers get to Earth?'

Down on the battlefield, Milan, Joel and Raj stood valiantly. Having been given positions as generals by the Secretary Marquisette, they filled their roles in better than anyone would have thought.

Of course, if they were asked why, their simple answer would be that whenever they were stuck, they'd only have a single thought... "What would cap do?"

This simple minded approach had actually placed them among the most effective generals of Royal Blue Fort.

That said, their success was also in large part due to the cooperation of the nobles. After Code Black was implemented, they no longer dared to hold back lest the titles their families had fought to keep hold of for centuries suddenly vanish under their leads.

"Who's this dumbass?" Raj's booming voice suddenly caused his troops to erupt in laughter. Their morale was already extremely high at the moment to begin with. Hearing such jeering right now made them feel as though they were on top of the world.

Raynred was too far away to hear these words since Raj hadn't enhanced his voice with Force. So, the latter kept boisteriously laughing in his own world.

After a moment, he calmed, sneering as he looked down on the battlefield.

"I'll give you all one chance, hand over all those with affiliations to Leonel Morales and I'll consider letting the rest of you live!"

Raynred's gaze lit with murderous intent. He had been humiliated more today than he ever had been before. He needed something to vent, and this Leonel would have to take the brunt of his rage.

At that moment, numerous figures on the battlefield suddenly halted, their fiery gazes all landing on Raynred at once.

In that instant, Raynred felt as though he had been plunged into a vat of ice. Several hundred meters separated him and the battlefield, yet it was as though a blade was being held at his throat.

Raynred froze.

By the time he recovered and shook his head, his fury had lit once again. Who the hell were these bastards to make him feel fear?!

Raynred suddenly growled, Force surging around him in tidal waves.

"It seems the Swan family is so incompetent that they've allowed you to grow arrogant! I'll kill you all the same way I killed that black lion and the other bastards of the Slayer Legion!"

"You killed who?"

It was then the battlefield came to a grinding halt. Compared to when Raynred spoke Leonel's name, this was like a completely different animal. Let alone the soldiers of Royal Blue Fort, even those of Swan City felt like all the oxygen had been sucked away.

In the skies, a surfboard with two individuals sitting upon it appeared seemingly out of thin air. They hovered above Raynred, the coldness that suddenly pervaded the battlefield emitting from them.

If before Raynred froze, this time he couldn't even stop his body from trembling. His knees grew weak, almost collapsing completely.

He had felt this feeling before. That day when Jilniya battled Aina, he had sensed it then too. Back then, he didn't even dare to breathe.

But now, Jilniya had long since died at the hands of that dark skinned, blue eyed bastard. There was no one but himself to take the brunt of this assault now.

Raynred's mind roared once again. This was the third time, it was already the third time he had been humiliated today!

He looked up and his gaze landed on a face he wanted to rip apart.

His fear gave way to a sneer. But it seemed that even he didn't realize his knees were still trembling. But, he had completely lost his rationality to his pride.

"That's right, I killed them. That whore Pisces was a nice help as I dug out their hearts. There was even some bitch among them who was mumbling your name even as she died, I bet you cared quite a bit for her, huh?

"What are you going to do about it?!"

In Raynred's mind, these words had come out forceful and powerful. But, all everyone on the battlefield heard was a long drawn out sentence laced with trembling stuttering.. Even when he yelled with the last of his energy near the end, it was in a voice three octaves too high to have possibly come from a man.
