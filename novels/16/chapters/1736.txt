Leonel reached out a palm and Richard flew into his palm. 

At that moment, Leonel's gaze glowed with a bright violet light, his grey hair even flickering with motes of purple light as well as it danced in the wind. 

"Who sent you?"

Richard was completely out cold, the whites of his eyes rolled forward and his mouth frothed. However, the moment Leonel spoke, it was as though his mind had been struck with a bell and his mouth began to move on its own. 

"My father sent me."

"Who is your father?" Leonel asked. 

"My father is Patriarch Graros Ernan, the ruler of the of the Chaotic Water Sector."

Even in his state, there was a hint of pride in Richard's tone as though he still had a right to brag. The trouble was that he clearly hadn't noticed that this father of his had sent him on a death mission. Something told Leonel that it wasn't just the pirate fleet that was bait, Richard was probably bait as well. 

But what was more curious was that Leonel had never heard of this Chaotic Water Sect. 

Considering they could send two Seventh Dimensional beings along with Richard, Leonel would guess that they were at least at that level. If he had to pinpoint an exact level, he would guess that they were closing in on the middle rank of Seventh Dimensional Sectors, but weren't quite there yet. 

The reason was quite obvious. The two Seventh Dimensional existences they had sent had broken through using the Conventional Path and they probably weren't among the truly powerful individuals, in fact they were far from it. 

In addition, Richard was the son of a ruler of a Sector, and yet he didn't have a soul protection treasure on him. That was enough for Leonel to make some assumptions. 

Leonel went through his memories and finally found reference to the Chaotic Water Sector. 

'Interesting…'

His assumption had been correct. This Sector was indeed a Seventh Dimensional Sector, but it was middling. 

Of course, to Leonel who was used to dealing with the Constellation families and was from the Morales family, his definition of middling was quite different from others. In truth, the Chaotic Water Sector was definitely a region of powerhouses and were about the same level of strength as Treanna's Viror family. 

There wasn't anything special about their location at first glance, but if Leonel's deductions were correct, they were probably near the current borders of Earth. 

Last time Leonel had fought for Earth it had been against the Umbra family and those other Sixth Dimensional families, but by now, Earth's had evolved twice and their territory was much larger. This meant that they were probably dealing with a lot of internal struggles right now as Leonel was sure that they had yet to assimilate so much territory, nor would the families and organizations that had once called those regions home obediently step aside. 

At the same time, they had new neighbors that watched what happened to the others and didn't want to sit idly by as they too were swallowed up. 

The Chaotic Water Sector was making a pre-emptive move and they had even been so fast to move. It was clear they were waiting for an opportunity, but more importantly, they had a trump card capable of finding Leonel in the middle of nowhere. 

This was clearly a warning. 

There were only two ways that this could go. 

The first would be Leonel obediently bowing his head. This would allow the Ernan family to manipulate him from the shadows and he could even be used to bolster their position. 

The second possibility was that Leonel would lash out and the ultimate result would be the Ernan family using this as an excuse to attack with reason on their side. 

In normal times, such childish tricks wouldn't work, but with his mother forcing Shield Cross Stars to retreat from their territory, the Chaotic Water Sector could be more brazen with their actions. 

Leonel's lip curled. 

He tapped a foot and the metal beneath his bare feet rippled, curling up and forming a pole that he wrapped around Richard's ankle and hung him upside down. 

"Stay here obediently," Leonel said casually even though Richard was far too out of it to understand what he was saying. In the end, the supposed prince could only nod obediently. 

At that moment, there was a burst of activity from behind the thick metal doors leading to the bow of the ship. The doors blasted open and a large number of soldiers holding what looked like assault rifles rushed forward. 

Leonel raised an eyebrow. Since when were guns a common weapon in the Dimensional Verse?  Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

"Fire!"

Leonel was surprised again. These soldiers truly had no respect for their prince. Richard hung right behind him yet they were opening fire with naked abandon. It was as though they didn't care about hitting Richard at all. 

Leonel's palm rose again, still facing down. 

"Stop."

With a whoosh, another circular formation of rotating violet fog spread outward, enveloping Leonel and the soldiers. The moment Leonel's commanding voice spread out, the "bullets" came to a grinding halt in the air. 

Leonel swept a casual gaze over them, realizing that these weren't normal metal casings at all but rather seemed to be concentrated bullets of Force. 

"Mm," Leonel nodded. 

He raised a finger and flicked it outward. "Reverse."

The bullets that had stopped in their tracks suddenly shuttled back toward the guns they had just come out of. 

"Close."

Leonel squeezed a hand and the barrels of the assault rifles crumpled like cheap paper. 

In their panic, some of the soldiers tried to fire again, but that only made the situation worse. 

BANG! BANG! BANG!

The guns exploded and backfired, causing catastrophic results. 

Leonel continued to walk forward as though the explosions didn't bother him in the slightest. 

"Condense."

The blast radius condensed into his palm until the point it was no more than a tenth the size of a fingernail. 

He reached a hand out to the side and aimed toward the warship floating several kilometers away to his right. 

"Accelerate."

Leonel flicked his finger and the projectile zoomed forward with unprecedented speed. In the blink of an eye, it vanished into the hull of the spaceship and a silence fell… 

BOOM!
