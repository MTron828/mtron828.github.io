1803 Really?

"Yes!" The words almost spilled out of Cherie's mouth, she didn't even bother to look toward her fellow head elders. Even after all of this time, she still worried that Leonel would turn around and slaughter their family after he got what he needed out of them. So, the moment she heard this, she didn't allow anyone to be foolish enough to hesitate.

Seaward and Rosellia looked toward Cheri with surprise, but at this point, they didn't dare to detract even if they had such a thought. If they did, the result would be even worse than outright rejection. Leonel swept a gaze through the head elders and then to Cherie and back. And then, he suddenly smiled. There didn't seem to be anything special about the smile, but for some reason it made them feel ice cold. If Leonel had said some stern words just now, maybe they could have handled it well enough.

But seeing that smile, that casual confidence, any sign of resistance they had crumbled to ash.

Leonel didn't bother with the old ones anymore and he pulled out a radiant blue Force Pill.

Anyone with the knowledge would be able to tell that this was a refined demon almost instantly.

Back then, Leonel's stomach had almost exploded just eating one, and yet now, he handed such a thing to a 14 year old little girl without much hesitation.

"Swallow it," Leonel suddenly said.

Grey blinked but nodded obediently in the end. Her eyes reflected an extremely dull blue that truly did look grey in most lighting. It was a rare color that made her look like an exotic little doll. Seeing her, Leonel couldn't help but think of another little girl, Nana. By now, Nana was probably a grown woman, if she didn't die in his massacre, that is. Leonel could neither confirm nor deny if she did. Back then, he was too infuriated to care and directly destroyed the planet the Adurna family had called home.

Even if Nana had died,though, Leonel didn't believe that he would feel guilty. If she was present, that meant that she too had participated in the war against Earth.

The little girl he had known back then was gone, so one way or another, it didn't matter. Grey opened her small mouth and swallowed the pill whole. BOOM! Almost instantly, a wild wave of Force shot out in all directions and a slight hint of pain colored Grey's adorable features.

Even so, just as Leonel had expected, she didn't implode, and instead, her aura began to skyrocket at a breakneck speed. This was exactly what the Florer family was missing. They had an enormous vessel, but they had nothing to fill it with. Grey was only in the Fifth Dimension, having barely entered it just recently. She was only at Tier 1, but she could actually withstand the vitality of a Sixth Dimensional Demon.

This Force Pill was just from the remnant of a Human Class even so, it was on a completely different level. Even the members of the Cataclysm Generation weren't as talented as such Demons. What shocked Leonel the most, though, was that it took less than a minute for Grey to open her eyes, her large irises blinking with excitement. But due to her usually reserved personality, she didn't dare to make too much noise so she just beamed from the inside.

Although she didn't know what Leonel had just fed her, she could feel that her strength was almost ten times as powerful as before despite the fact her Dimensional Tier didn't increase at all!

Leonel gave Rosna and Jean one pill each as well, and they soon experienced the same thing.

Their blood flowed like a raging tide and their body began to undergo many changes. If not for the fact Leonel had taught them how to control their flow of Blood Force to their partners, their plants

would have skyrocketed instrength as well.

"Here," Leonel flipped over a palm and handed Grey a little sapling. This tree couldn't have been more ordinary on the surface, but the aura it gave off was refreshing and vibrant. This was a tree from the Eighth Dimensional world of the infant now, but in maturity, it could grow to several kilometers tall with ease.

Grey's small hands carefully picked up the sapling, a happy little smile causing dimples in her cheeks.

Leonel smiled and rubbed her head. "I believe in your path, but your white-barked tree is too limited in its growth potential. This tree here was born in an Eighth Dimensional world. Although it is very ordinary in all aspects, just this foundation alonegives it the nigh infinite growth potential you need. You won't be limited by your first choice anymore. Although, so long as you master the technique I taught you, you can partner with other powerful plants to supplement your strength."Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Grey's large eyes suddenly glistened with tears. "Really?" This was the first time she had spoken without Leonel asking her a question first, which surprised Leonel somewhat,'She knew', Leonel's Dreamscape sparked. He understood right then that Grey knew that she had already reached the limit of her potential, she was just too scared to tell anyone.

This little girl was incredibly astute and her talent was far beyond what even Leonel had anticipated. Leonel's surprise became an even wider smile.

"Yes,really." Grey's tears began to fall but she quickly wiped them away, not wanting to affect the little sapling in her hands. Leonel couldn't help but think that she was too adorable. Let alone this ones apling, he had tens of thousandshe had no idea what to do with. After all,the Segmented Cube was still pretty much a blank slate in this regard.

"Thank you." Grey said with a softvoice. Leonel laughed and stood to his feet. "If you want to thank me, grow very strong and powerful. Take good care of your little sapling. In the future, you'll be of great help to me."

"Mm," Grey nodded surprisingly firmly. Leonel smiled and didn't say anything more. Whether or not she would reach her full potential would be up to her.

"Alright, navigate this ship toward Radix territory. It's time to fullysettle things."
