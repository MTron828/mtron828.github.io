Chapter 2534 [Bonus] Example

[Bonus chapter courtesy of Mr. Ham <3 6/6]

The Quasi Life State was worth so much more to Leonel. Because of his Sovereignty, it was as good as a true Life State. It was akin to two halves coming together to make a whole.

According to what El'Rion had said back then, Sovereignty was the representation of the Life State. It allowed much lower-level Forces to display some of the strength of the Life State ahead of time.

It could also be said that a Force that was both in the Life State and maintained a Sovereign air was on an entirely different level than both. The truest strength of Sovereignty wouldn't be seen until one entered the Life State and maintained it.

Thanks to this, Leonel skipped over Tier Four entirely and gained Tier Five strength, catching up with the foundation of the Owlans. It had not even been a quarter of the day, but he didn't feel complacent at all.

Remembering how much progress the Nomad Race had been able to make so quickly, he understood that he couldn't afford to get complacent.

He looked down at the net of runes before him.

'Hm... This could be useful even if I don't fuse it with myself.'

Leonel picked it up and shot into the distance. His Tier Five status plus his 100% booster was showing its strength right now and he shot right back up the mountain to where a certain Tier Six beast was still rampaging.

The moment it spotted Leonel, it lunged at him, but just as quickly, it was suppressed by the Life Tablet.

Leonel didn't want to control the creature for information. Ironically, precisely because it was the strongest creature of this mountain, it knew the least about the surrounding areas. That was because it never left the Forgetful Orb.

Leonel moved his intention a bit and the Tier Five creature inside of the net of runes was released. It was quickly killed by the Tier Six Starry Tailed Fox, and Leonel used the Life Tablet to absorb all of its strength.

'Barely anything.'

It would have taken at least a dozen of those Tier Fives to go from Tier Four to Tier Five. Now that he was already in Tier Five, the improvement was even less.

Luckily, he hadn't come here for that.

He poured Dream Force into the net of runes and controlled the Starry Tailed Fox at the same time. After some time, the two resonated, and then the latter leapt into the net of runes, becoming trapped.

'Success. That took over a minute. Luckily, I can control a Tier Six right now for just a bit over that time, or else it could get dicey.'

Leonel nodded to himself.

This idea was workable.

He didn't have enough Dream Force to just continuously control these creatures for long periods of time. But what if he could store them and conveniently bring them out when he needed them instead?

The Nomads had just given him the perfect item to do that, and he bet that if he killed more of them, he could likewise gather more to be used in a pinch.

Much like with the little fox back then, Leonel could control beasts a Tier down from him for around five minutes.

Back then, he had been in Tier One while the little fox was Tier Zero. Now, he was in Tier Five, he could control a Tier Four for five minutes, a Tier Five for half that, and a Tier Six like this one for half of that, putting him at just over a minute.

If he tried the same with a Tier Seven, he would run out of Dream Force, and then his life would be in danger.

Unfortunately, he also couldn't control more than one of these beasts at a time, or else the time he could have them under his control would plummet further, and then he'd end up on the bad end of the backlash. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

'I can try to study the net of runes more. If I understand it better, I can cut down the time from a minute. But...'

Right now, the reason it was taking a minute wasn't that it was difficult to control the beasts, but because of how much Dream Force he had to pour into the net of runes, and how carefully he had to control it.

Luckily, controlling the beast and fueling the net of runes relied on two completely different sources of Dream Force, one on his real body and one on this fake body.

But ultimately the annoyance was that he didn't perfectly understand the Force Arts. They were too complicated and beyond him. He could only use it in this crude way.

Even so, that was enough.

A sneer spread across Leonel's face as he bolted down the mountain and headed toward the previous one he had been on.

Now he had an easier method of hunting down the kings of these peaks, and if he was correct, there should be quite a number of Nomads focused on their battles right now as well.

He would make an example out of them.

By the time he was done, the Gem Dream Pavilion would have no one. He would make certain of that.

And that was exactly what he did.

Leonel moved from mountain to mountain, hunting down Nomads and Tier Six creatures alike. At the same time, he conveniently pocketed Forgetful Orbs.

He realized after cracking open his second one that it would take more than one more Forgetful Orb to enter the Life State truly, so he set aside that matter for the moment.

If he spent too long meditating, many of the Nomads would succeed and by then, dealing with them would be much more difficult. If they had Tier Six power, even if he set all his Tier Six captives at them in a trap, they would still be likely to escape.

The world watched as a seemingly pitiful human, the weakest ant they had maybe ever seen, massacred a Race of beings supposedly so much better than his own.

And they could do nothing about it.
