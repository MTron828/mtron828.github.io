Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

The remaining four arms of the panda construct raised into the air as a Crafting Quill appeared in Leonel's left hand; His intent blazed into the skies; four replicas of his Crafting Quill appearing in each hand; 

Space warped and Force surged as Leonel wrote across the air; Ancient looking runes formed one after another, touching a speed that made those who understood what was happening feel as though they were dreaming; 

Every time Leonel finished another Force Art, it shot into the skies, filling his surroundings with magic circles of all sorts of colors; 

The javelins blotted out all the light in the skies, trembling as they passed through these ancient runes one after another; With every completion, their auras changed entirely, the strength they exuded causing countless hearts to skip a beat; 

Blazing flames. blinding golden lights. twisting vortexes of space… 

Each and every javelin seemed to have an entirely different shape and form. aimed toward the survivors of the Brazinger family; 

All the while, Leonel's footsteps hadn't stopped; He continued to walk forward as though nothing could stop his forward momentum; Nothing would halt his massacre on this day; 

The quills in the panda construct's four hands vanished as the javelins suddenly moved; In one moment. they were almost entirely still. but in the next instant. they flashed forward with such speed that their former location seemed to implode with blasts of concentrated air; 

Several roars filled the skies as the Brazinger family members seemed to finally snap out of their shock; They had been so caught off guard by the sudden changes that they couldn't even breathe; Watching the Moon suddenly be enveloped by flames; its atmosphere burning to ash and the land being buried beneath furious crimson flickers had left them stunned; 

But the moment they realized what happened, it seemed to settle in all at once…

They were all dead? 

The eyes of the Brazinger warriors turned entirely red. their Berserk God Lineage Factor surging out of control. 

Not all members of the Brazinger family had the purest form of the Berserk God Lineage Factor; Many were like Aina before she reined her curse into her control, easily capable of losing themselves in bloodlust and carnage; 

The instant they were triggered by their fury, their roars shook the skies, wild crimson auras surging from their bodies as they grabbed their weapons and charged forward all at once; 

But that was when Leonel's javelins descended.

A warrior at the front was sucked into a vortex of space; his body shredded to pieces in an instant; The moment the vortex stopped rotating; it spit out the bits and pieces of his flesh and bones; allowing it to rain down from the skies; 

To his side, a blazing javelin of fire tore through the chest of three Brazingers in a row; They ran forward two more steps each before they combusted into balls of fire, falling in a rain of ash; 

On the other side of the battlefield; a javelin rotating with a deep; dark blue collided with a burly man that stood well over two meters tall; He had his ax raised above his head; closing the distance on Leonel with speed his body shouldn't have been able to carry; 

And yet. the instant he met the javelin. it felt as though he had been hit with a sledge hammer; It sounded as though a speeding truck had collided with a steel wall;  please visit

The burly man exploded on contact. mashed bundles of flesh and blood falling from the skies; Only he knew that he had actually dodged. but it didn't seem to matter; It was as though the entire area around the javelin had become a heavy mass. the air around it becoming part of its power; 

The massacre was on as large of a scale as his Emperor's Edict, but the power of the men and women who fell were on a completely different level; This didn't seem to matter to Leonel in the slightest as he cut them down like weeds; 

Weaker? Stronger? He would kill as many as there were. 

Leonel's freed four arms flipped their palms even as Ryu's Force Quill vanished to be replaced with the White Lion Bow. 

In that instant, four exact replicas appeared in his four palms, raising up four bows and aiming them all forward. Each one was over six meters from tip to tip, laying horizontally within Leonel's hand. 

Four javelins descended from around Ryu, loaded into the bow and slowly pulled the strings back. 

The scent of death permeated the air. Somehow, the danger seemed to multiple ten times over, the power of Leonel's archery causing the skies to tremble. 

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 

They were all released at once, the air collapsing and the booming calls of thunder being drowned out. 

Everywhere the javelins passed, dozens died, the residual auras alone capable of ripping everything in their path to pieces. 

However, even after this, four more javelins floated over, nocking into Leonel's four bows and pushing their strings back. Wild currents of Bow Force took shape, spiraling like drill cones. 

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Leonel alone became like an artillery unit. With every step, dozens would die. Never once did he slow or pause, it was as though his feet were carrying him toward a certain location. 

He was no different from a god of carnage. Not the slightest fluctuation could be seen in his eyes, his indifference and coldness shining through like a chilly wind that licked across the back of their necks. 

"THAT'S ENOUGH!"

Booming voices of fury layered atop of one another. Four young geniuses shot forward, two men and two women. Their gazes blazed with a trail of crimson, but their eyes had a clarity the others simply didn't have. There was no doubt that they had full access to the Berserk God Lineage Factor, each and everyone one of the being at Tier 7 at the very least. 

They finally closed the distance on Leonel, attacking him from all sides, their power causing the skies to clap like thunder.
