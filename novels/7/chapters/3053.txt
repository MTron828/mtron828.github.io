Chapter 128 – Fight?

“Lan Hailong? Why is he here?”

Blackie’s expression darkened a little when he heard Shi Feng’s words. He had spent the past ten years striving for Shadow. Yet, not only did he have nothing to show for it, but he had even gotten thrown away like a used tool by Lan Hailong.

Fortunately, the Miniature Ancient World had appeared, and he had managed to get into Zero Wing. Although he hadn’t made any money yet, he could already see the future prospects of the Guild. Zero Wing definitely had a promising future, and it would certainly surpass Shadow by leaps and bounds in the future.

“He’s probably here for those Epic Weapons and Equipment. Levels lost can be recovered, but it won’t be easy to recover all those Epic items,” Su Qianliu said, smiling.

Even her Thousand Flow adventurer team did not possess this many Epic Weapons and Equipment when it transitioned into the Miniature Ancient World. It wasn’t hard for her to imagine how devastated Lan Hailong must’ve felt after finding out about such a loss.

It might be a different story if Lan Hailong didn’t know who had come into possession of these Epic Weapons and Equipment. However, in a situation where he knew who had acquired these items, there was no way he wouldn’t do something about it.

“Guild Leader, that Lan Hailong must be up to no good! I’ll bring people over to your place right away!” Blackie hurriedly said when he recalled the sinister methods Lan Hailong had employed in the past.

“No need. I can take care of it by myself. You go and sell the equipment,” Shi Feng said, waving his hand.

“Will you really be fine, Guild Leader?” Su Qianliu asked with some concern.

“Don’t worry. It’s just Lan Hailong and his thugs. They don’t have the strength to do anything against me,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “Alright, I’m logging off.”

If it were two weeks ago, Shi Feng might have had a little trouble dealing with Lan Hailong. However, the S-rank Nutrient Fluids he consumed had already healed his hidden injuries and revitalized his body cells fully. Combined with his training, he now possessed the physical fitness of a half-step master. Now, he would have no problems facing even martial arts masters.

After saying so, Shi Feng promptly chose to log out of God’s Domain.

...

Outside Shi Feng’s villa...

Under the villa’s surveillance camera, Lan Hailong currently wore an ugly expression on his face. His eyes were also vaguely bloodshot, and even his clothes still had a lot of wine stains left on them. At this moment, he was completely devoid of his past arrogance and majesty.

“This bastard simply isn’t taking us seriously, Chairman! He’s made us wait outside for over ten minutes already!” the muscular and balding Zhou Yuhu said impatiently. “Should I break inside and drag him out?”

Zhou Yuhu was currently Shadow’s chief training instructor. He had also participated in many fighting competitions in the city and won many trophies during his younger days. Although his combat standards were inferior to Shi Feng in God’s Domain, he was far superior to Shi Feng in combat in the real world. With his physical fitness currently at the half-step Henglian master standard, he could easily take on two or three Shi Fengs simultaneously.

Meanwhile, the security system of Shi Feng’s villa might seem excellent, but Zhou Yuhu was confident he could sneak inside without any cameras catching him.

However, after hearing Zhou Yuhu’s suggestion, Lan Hailong calmed down a little and shook his head, saying, “Shi Feng now has a Tier 6 God-ranked expert backing him, so he’s naturally feeling arrogant! We’ll wait!”

Since Lan Hailong had already said so, as Lan Hailong’s number one henchman, Zhou Yuhu had no choice but to dismiss his plans and continue waiting.

After another ten minutes had gone by, the villa’s door finally opened, and standing behind it was Shi Feng.

At this time, Shi Feng was dressed in a bathrobe, and his hair was still wet. Evidently, he had just come out of the shower.

“Shi Feng!” Zhou Yuhu immediately felt his anger flaring up when he saw Shi Feng’s attire. “We’ve been standing outside for so long, yet you were inside taking a shower?! Are you even taking us seriously?!”

“Do you have business with me?” Shi Feng asked, ignoring Zhou Yuhu as he turned to look at Lan Hailong. Honestly, he wasn’t trying to trouble Lan Hailong and Zhou Yuhu by taking a shower. Instead, he had simply taken a shower because his body had grown dirty and sticky after spending many hours cooped up inside his virtual gaming cabin.

“I know you’re very upset with me, Shi Feng.” Seemingly regaining his past majesty, Lan Hailong calmly said, “Now that you have a God-ranked expert standing behind you, it’s natural that you can ignore Shadow and me. However, don’t you know you’ve just brought disaster to yourself?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Disaster?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw Lan Hailong’s high and mighty behavior. “What is this disaster you speak of, Chairman Lan?”

“Your Zero Wing might have a God-ranked expert backing it, but not only did your people annihilate Shadow’s experts right in front of World Dominators’s many affiliated Guilds, but they’ve also killed Gu Yiren, one of World Dominators’s administrators in the Miniature Ancient World. Do you think World Dominators will let Zero Wing off the hook after this slight?” Lan Hailong asked. When he looked at Shi Feng’s nonchalant expression, he could tell that the other party wasn’t heeding his words whatsoever. So, he continued, “I can tell you now that World Dominators is very angry over this matter. It has even prepared to issue a bounty across the entire Miniature Ancient World.

“That God-ranked expert might not care about having a bounty placed on him, but what about the rest of you?

“Do you think you can survive the pursuit of the Miniature Ancient World’s countless experts?”

Nodding to Lan Hailong’s words, Shi Feng asked, “So?”

“Hasn’t Zero Wing acquired Shadow’s lost Epic Weapons and Equipment?” Chuckling, Lan Hailong said, “I can make you an offer. Think of a way to sell those items back to Shadow; you can at least give that God-ranked expert an explanation that way. In return, Shadow will plead World Dominators’s side for mercy and forget about issuing a bounty on Zero Wing. This is a deal that is good for both of us!”

Shi Feng quietly looked at Lan Hailong. After listening to Lan Hailong’s offer, he suddenly found that Lan Hailong wasn’t a brainless fool like he thought. The man was simply ignorant of the current situation.

“Your offer is good, but I refuse!” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

“Don’t delude yourself, Shi Feng! World Dominators’s bounty will be one that can tempt countless experts! There is no way Zero Wing can survive this!” Lan Hailong said, his gaze suddenly turning icy cold. “This is your only chance!”

“Let’s just fight, then!”

After saying so, Shi Feng closed the door and stopped entertaining Lan Hailong and Zhou Yuhu, his actions causing Lan Hailong to grow dumbfounded.
