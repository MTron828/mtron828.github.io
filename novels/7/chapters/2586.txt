Chapter 2587 – One Step Ahead? Frightening Levels!

“We haven’t even started on the Boss, yet the trial’s been cleared? Did another team get ahead of us?” “Did some power send a team into the tower in secret before we got here?”

“Impossible! No one can field a team powerful enough to clear the tower without anyone noticing!”

No one on the alliance team could believe their ears when they heard the system announcement. At the same time, they all wondered which team had just conquered the Ancient God’s Tower’s first floor.

But even after racking their brains for a long moment, they couldn’t think of anyone who could pull it off.

They had first-hand experience with the first-floor trial, so they knew just how challenging it was. Not only would a team need at least 1,000 Tier 3 Refinement Realm experts, but they’d also have to be fully armed with top-tier equipment. Their alliance team had even been forced to borrow their top-tier weapons and equipment from the main continent’s various superpowers. Procuring enough of these items was simply impossible for the Dark World’s various major powers.

“Could it be Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s team, Elder Heart?” the Level 110, Tier 3 Assassin from World Domination wondered.

“Impossible!” Furious Heart’s reply was instinctive. They only entered the tower less than half a day ago! With just 200- plus players, they won’t even be able to handle the outer area’s monsters, much less the monsters within the four ancient cities!”

“I guess you’re right. Even with top-tier equipment, they’d need a lot of time to figure out the Bosses’ patterns and weaknesses. They’ll be lucky to raid the first Boss so quickly, not to mention all four,” the Assassin said. He silently scolded himself for being stupid enough to think Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society could be responsible for capturing the first floor. “Since they couldn’t do it, who just did?”

Everyone in the Dark World knew that Dark Rhapsody, Deity Society, and World Domination were the three strongest Guilds in their Otherworld, and no other Guild could compare. Hence, he found it hard to imagine that some hidden power, capable of accomplishing such a feat, existed.

“I don’t know who foiled our plans, but it’s fine as long as it wasn’t Dark Rhapsody or Deity Society,” Furious Heart commented after taking a moment to calm his rage. “We’ll figure out who they are when they system teleports us to the inner sanctum.”

The appearance of a third faction certainly surprised Furious Heart, but it wasn’t something to make a fuss over. Plenty of major corporations had invested in God’s Domain, and there were bound to be some who secretly developed their powers, waiting for an opportunity to shine. That was, after all, Demon’s Heart’s situation.

This wasn’t the worst possible outcome. With how much influence Demon’s Heart and the various superpowers possessed, they weren’t afraid that this third faction wouldn’t cooperate. Rather, allying with them would be the wisest move this faction could make.

The other powers’ members nodded in agreement.

Their team represented the majority of the Dark World’s major powers. Refusing to cooperate would be tantamount to suicide. The Ancient God’s Tower wasn’t the only way out of the Dark World, and players could contest for its ruling rights once a month. The easiest way to determine the tower’s new owner once that month was up was to host a battle between players, not a simple contest of who could raid the tower the fastest

Shortly after Furious Heart fell silent, a teleportation array appeared under everyone’s feet, sending all of them to the tower’s inner sanctum.

Ancient God’s Tower, first floor’s central hall:

A flash of white light filled the central hall’s plaza as all players on the first floor teleported in.

The first floor’s central hall was roughly the size of three sports stadiums. Aside from the stone golems that maintained security, the hall contained a large number of hotels, restaurants, and Shops. This place could easily accommodate 100,000 players.

“Quick! Find those people!” Furious Heart commanded as soon as he arrived.

Although getting a clear view of the plaza with a glance was possible, they couldn’t do anything to stop the third faction’s members from fleeing. Players weren’t allowed to fight within the Ancient God’s Tower’s inner sanctum, and players could freely use Return Scrolls in this area.

However, the alliance team members were stunned by what they found in their search for the mysterious third faction.

Aside from Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s 200-plus members and themselves, the plaza was empty...

“Where are they?” Furious Heart also looked around, confused. “Have they already escaped? No! Impossible! Everyone teleported at the same time! Even if they used Return Scrolls the moment they arrived, we should’ve still seen them!”

While Furious Heart and his team frantically searched for this third faction, two figures approached them. However, Furious Heart and the others instinctively ignored them.

The two figures were none other than Dark Rhapsody’s Blue Rainbow and Deity Society’s Elder Gold.

“Long time, no see, Elder Heart,” Blue Rainbow greeted Furious Heart as she walked up to him.

“Long time, no see? If I recall, we met only a few days ago,” Furious Heart rudely responded.

He had visited the two Guilds personally to persuade them to join with Demon’s Heart. Blue Rainbow had received him when he visited Dark Rhapsody, but both Guilds had foolishly and definitively refused Demon’s Heart’s goodwill, siding with Zero Wing instead.

Furious Heart didn’t doubt that these two were here to ridicule the alliance team for failing to capture the Ancient God’s Tower’s first floor.

“Is such behavior necessary, Elder Heart? I am only here to pass on a message from Guild Leader Black Flame,” Blue Rainbow said, unfazed by man’s attitude.

“Relay a message? I hadn’t realized that Dark Rhapsody’s Honorary Elder had become Zero Wing’s errand girl. The world really has changed,” Furious Heart said, sneering.

“That’s right; the world has changed. Some people just refuse to acknowledge it,” Blue Rainbow responded, not angered in the least by Furious Heart’s provocation. Chuckling, she continued, “Guild Leader Black Flame’s message is simple. Develop yourselves quietly, and don’t cause unnecessary trouble. If you refuse, there will be consequences!”

“Consequences? With just Zero Wing’s strength? Demon’s Heart’s foundation and strength are leagues beyond what Zero Wing can imagine!” Furious Heart growled disdainfully. “While I admit that we failed to secure the first floor’s First Clear, can’t the same be said of you?”

“The same of us?” The question surprised Blue Rainbow. After a moment, she simply shook her head before turning and leaving without another word.

Elder Gold, who had stood beside her, just chuckled before he walked off.

“What are you laughing about?!” Furious Heart bellowed after the older man. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He didn’t receive a reply, however, and in the next moment, Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s members pulled Return Scrolls from their bag as they prepared to leave the Ancient God’s Tower.

Just as Furious Heart was about to say something else, he heard a voice.

“Something’s not right, Elder Heart! Look at their levels!” the Assassin from World Domination exclaimed.

Everyone from the alliance team turned to examine the other players’ levels, and what they saw left them utterly flabbergasted.

“Level 115?! How is that possible!?”
