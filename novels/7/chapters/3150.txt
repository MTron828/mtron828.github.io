Chapter 225 – Birth of a Legend

“Dammit!”

When Death Omen, who wore crimson leather armor, saw Shi Feng’s team disappearing, rage instantly filled her eyes.

She could have intercepted Shi Feng’s team had she had a few more seconds. Then, she could have bought time for Chiyang Tianhe, Ruthless Sky, and the rest of their army to arrive. At that time, they could definitely keep Shi Feng’s team in the first underground level.

She is most likely at the Beyond Domain Realm already...?Chiyang Tianhe was very surprised when he saw Laura Crader in action.?To think an expert of such caliber would come to our Miniature Ancient World. Could Zero Wing be insane?

Unlike Death Omen, Chiyang Tianhe wasn’t blinded by rage, so he could process the situation with a calm mind. Meanwhile, his evaluation of the situation confused him greatly.

Beyond Domain Realm experts were extraordinarily rare, even among the Five Great Super Guilds. They were the ceiling of the Five Great Super Guilds’ combat power. They were also a large part of why the Five Great Super Guilds could have their current positions.

Meanwhile, according to his knowledge, Beyond Domain Realm experts were likewise incredibly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. Such experts would receive respectful treatment even from the various hegemonic powers. Should a Beyond Domain Realm choose to join a hegemonic power, they would instantly receive a core executive position and enjoy authority rivaling Grand Elders. They would even receive some of the Guild’s shares.

Normally, not even the various hegemonic powers would be willing to send a Beyond Domain Realm expert to a Miniature Ancient World. After all, these experts represented the Guild’s deterrent power and foundation. The presence and absence of even one Beyond Domain Realm expert could impact a hegemonic power’s influence greatly.

At the same time as Chiyang Tianhe was calmly analyzing the situation, an uproar had occurred among the several great alliances’ members.

“Crap! Who is that woman?! After breaking the Crimson Demon Barrier in one hit, she even killed thirty of the Flower of Seven Sins’ core members in one move!”

“She’s ridiculously strong! I’ve never seen a God-ranked expert as strong as her!”

“She’s so cool! She’s like the Valkyrie recorded in libraries, sweeping across an army of millions all by herself!”

“This is definitely the luckiest day of my life! Not only did I get to see the birth of a war goddess, but I even got a recording of it! If any of you want to rewatch the battle just now, I’ll sell you a copy for 100 Credits!”

Everyone was awed by the miraculous feat Laura had just pulled off, and many players had even uploaded screenshots and video recordings of the battle onto the official forums.

For a time, players across the entire Miniature Ancient World went into an uproar.

Previously, everyone was of the opinion that the Asura Mercenary Alliance was overestimating itself by challenging the Flower of Seven Sins. Everyone also thought that Asura was merely seeking its own demise by entering the Boundary Mountain Range.

However, facts had proven them wrong. Not only did Asura’s team remain unharmed after entering the Boundary Mountain Range, but the team had even successfully entered the second underground level.

What surprised everyone the most was that another God-ranked expert had appeared in the Asura Mercenary Alliance. Meanwhile, not only did this God-ranked expert shatter the Crimson Demon Barrier, but she had also single-handedly helped Asura’s team break past the several great alliances’ army of 20,000 Refinement Realm experts and above.

The Valkyrie of Light!

In no time at all, this nickname had spread across the entire forums. Some people have even analyzed Laura Crader’s battle video and felt that the Valkyrie of Light might become another peerless monster in God’s Domain. As a result, the number of players seeking to join the Asura Mercenary Alliance increased again.

After all, God’s Domain’s four peerless monsters were existences feared by even the Five Great Super Guilds.

Or, more specifically, the Five Great Super Guilds treated the four peerless monsters like natural disasters and avoided butting heads with them as much as possible. This was because making an enemy out of these peerless monsters was in no way a wise decision. Even if they managed to win, it would be a pyrrhic victory.

…

While the Miniature Ancient World’s players were excitedly discussing Asura and Laura Crader, the several great alliances quickly prepared to enter the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level. The great alliances reorganized their joint army and formed a 1,000-man team of Flowing Water Realm experts and above. The team was also led by Chiyang Tianhe, Death Omen, and Ruthless Sky, and the team would be responsible for hunting down Shi Feng’s team in the second level.

“Teacher, are we really going in with them?” World Dominators’ Tao Yuwei quietly asked as she looked at the elderly Thousand Swords. “They have a 1,000-man team. We won’t receive any good loot if we follow them…”

World Dominators and Blackwater had only co-formed a 100-man team. Although every member of the team was at the Flowing Water Realm or above, with half being at the Void Realm, it was still an incredibly weak team compared to the several great alliances’ 1,000-man team. It didn’t matter even if their team was led by Thousand Swords, a former Tier 6 Sword God.

“Yes, we’ll be safer if we enter with them,” Thousand Swords said. “The second level’s situation is completely different from the first level. It might have many more opportunities to offer, but these opportunities come with equal amounts of danger. In addition, I won’t be able to take care of everyone because of the special environment there. The death penalty isn’t something as simple as losing a level, either. According to our sources, players who die in the second level will enter a forced sleep in the real world. Although it isn’t life-threatening, nobody has regained consciousness thus far.”

“Even you won’t be able to take care of all of us, Teacher? Is the second level that dangerous?” Gu Yiren asked, astonished by Thousand Swords’ words. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Even after reverting to Tier 3, a God-ranked expert geared in only Epic items could easily exhibit combat power at the Tier 4 standard and hold their ground against Mythic monsters of the same level.

It should be known that Thousand Swords owned a Fragmented Legendary Weapon. Even when subjected to the special environment of the Boundary Mountain Range’s first underground level, he could still effortlessly annihilate the 100-man team co-formed by World Dominators and Blackwater. He could even single-handedly defeat several hundred Great Lords of the same level.

Meanwhile, the Void Creatures in the Boundary Mountain Range would, at most, appear in groups of several hundred. Logically, even if the second underground level’s environment was harsher, Thousand Swords still shouldn’t have any trouble going up against these monsters.

“You’ll find out once you enter. Moreover, even if you don’t acquire any loot, just entering the second underground level will benefit you all greatly,” Thousand Swords said, not bothering to offer any additional explanations.

“The Predators have arrived already, Commander Omen. We can set off any time,” a Level 109 Assassin from the Flower of Seven Sins said to Death Omen respectfully.

“Good! Set off immediately!” Death Omen nodded, her expression as cold as ice. “Asura might think that they have humiliated us by entering the second level, but it has no idea that it is only sending its members to their graves!”
