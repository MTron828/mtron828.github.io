Chapter 2796 – Black Flame’s Astonishing Appearance

When Divine Shadow and the other Heaven’s Blade’s members saw Autumn Plant teleporting away, their eyes turned bloodshot, and they desperately tried to stop him. Unfortunately, none of them managed to break free of their restraints, and they could only watch helplessly as the scene before them continued playing out. “Dammit!”

At this moment, Divine Shadow couldn’t help wondering why Autumn Plant had managed to get promoted to Tier 4.

In terms of combat standards, Autumn Plant couldn’t even rank within Dragonheart Island’s top 20. The only advantage he had was his race as a Half-elf, which granted him a slightly better affinity with Mana. However, the Promotion Quest of Half-elves was also much harder than that of humans.

For the sake of balance, races with strong talents in God’s Domain would often find their talents becoming shackles that prevented them from advancing. Hence, not many players were willing to convert to other races. Only those with incredible willpower would take this risky path.

As proof of the limitation of other races, Autumn Plant had gotten promoted to Tier 3 slightly later than players of similar levels and combat standards. Yet, he was actually the first to reach Tier 4 on Dragonheart Island. This situation was simply unbelievable, no matter how Divine Shadow looked at it.

In reality, though, Autumn Plant’s promotion to Tier 4 was a complete accident. It wasn’t something he had actively sought to accomplish. Instead, his promotion was related to the Legacy of his hidden class.

“Vice Commander, we don’t have many Horned Eagles. Aside from the two of the other Vice Commanders remaining on Dragonheart Island, the only other Horned Eagle I can think of belongs to the missing team leader, Yu Luo,” Cleansing Flame said worriedly as she looked at the approaching Horned Eagle. “Could that person flying toward us be Team Leader Yu Luo?”

“It should be, but it’s useless to say anything now,” Divine Shadow said, smiling helplessly. “If we can’t do anything against Autumn Plant, what more can Yu Luo do?”

At this time, he no longer held any hopes of Yu Luo escaping. It might have been a different story if Yu Luo were a scout class, but as a Cleric, she wouldn’t notice Autumn Plant’s rapid approach before it was too late.

“That’s right. Now that Autumn has taken action, they can’t escape. You should just obediently follow us back and persuade your commander.” At this time, a blue-clad woman suddenly appeared beside Divine Shadow and the others, giving Cleansing Flame and the others a scare.

This female Ranger was none other than Ink Feather, another one of War Blood’s Four Great Vice Commanders.

“I never thought that War Blood would send two of its vice commanders just to stop us. What an honor,” Divine Shadow said provocatively as he looked at Ink Feather.

“Shadow, there’s no point in inciting me.” Sneering, Ink Feather said, “Even without Autumn here, do you think you can escape me? You should know very well that if we were to fight, I would have a greater chance of winning. Not to mention, I am more proficient at hunting down targets.” At Ink Feather’s words, Divine Feather stopped speaking

As a Domain Realm expert himself, he had to admit that Ink Feather was powerful. Previously, he could still beat her when she had yet to reach the Domain Realm. At present, however, not only was Ink Feather in the Domain Realm already, but it was even rumored that she had obtained a Fragmented Legendary Bow. Her strength was incredibly close to catching up with Tier 4 existences’.

Hence, in an actual confrontation, the chances that he would lose were indeed very high.

“You don’t have to worry. Yu Luo won’t be in any pain.” Looking at Divine Shadow and the others, Ink Feather smiled faintly and added, “She’ll soon be like you. Once within Autumn’s sight, nobody can escape.” Afterward, Ink Feather and the other War Blood members shifted their gaze toward Autumn Plant, who had already popped up before the Horned Eagle. Upon noticing Autumn Plant, the flying Horned Eagle felt uneasy and came to an abrupt stop, looking at the Tier 4 Great Wizard with fear in its eyes.

“I don’t know whether to call you bunch brave or stupid to approach while riding one of Heaven’s Blade’s Horned Eagles,” Autumn Plant said, smiling as he looked at the four cloaked figures atop the Flying Mount. “At this time, only three people in Heaven’s Blade possess a Horned Eagle. Of the three, two are still hiding inside Dragonheart Island. Even if you don’t reveal yourselves, I can guess that one of you is that missing team leader, Yu Luo, right?”

War Blood had conducted a detailed investigation into Heaven’s Blade’s organizational structure after forcing the latter to disband. The sudden disappearance of Yu Luo was included in the information they dug

up.

Yu Luo did not bother refuting Autumn Plant’s words. She simply looked at the Great Wizard and said calmly, “I never thought you would actually be the first on Dragonheart Island to get promoted to Tier 4.” “That’s right! But many more unexpected things have occurred as well, such as the dissolution of Heaven’s Blade and the fact that you’re now a prisoner of War Blood!” Autumn Plant said contemptuously instead of growing enraged at Yu Luo’s words. “Now, do you want me to take action, or are you going to follow me obediently?”

However, no sooner had Autumn Plant finished speaking than a chuckle came from behind Yu Luo.

“Long time no see, Vice Commander Autumn. It seems you’ve grown to have quite the arrogant tone.”

As this voice spread, Autumn Plant’s complexion changed, and he stared automatically at the cloaked man standing behind Yu Luo.

“You are...” For a moment, Autumn Plant doubted his ears. After all, he was familiar with this voice, to the point where just hearing it disgusted him already. In fact, he even had trouble speaking right now. “Black...Flame!”

Autumn Plant’s reaction was because this man was the culprit responsible for War Blood’s loss of reputation on Dragonheart Island. This man had also very nearly turned War Blood into a joke to the various superpowers. Hence, this man was the person Blood Oath, War Blood’s commander, wished to kill the most.

“That’s right.” Nodding, Shi Feng removed his hood and smiled at Autumn Plant. “We meet again, Vice Commander Autumn.”

The instant Shi Feng removed his hood, a wave of restlessness spread through the War Blood members spectating the situation from a distance. Heaven’s Blade’s members were similarly astonished to see Shi Feng.

Black Flame was currently a bigshot that everybody in God’s Domain knew of. He had thoroughly risen to fame during the reserve seat competition as the first player in God’s Domain to reach Tier 4. Although there hadn’t been any news of him recently, his performance during the competition was still being discussed by countless players even today.

“This is great! It’s really Guild Leader Black Flame!” Cleansing Flame grew ecstatic when she saw Shi Feng.

Although Heaven’s Blade wasn’t considered allies with Zero Wing, the organizations had a relatively good relationship. In fact, Zero Wing was one of the Guilds they intended to seek help from when they were planning to escape from Dragonheart Island.

The arrival of Zero Wing’s Guild Leader was undoubtedly a wonderful situation for Heaven’s Blade.

Moreover, Shi Feng was a Tier 4 player. Even Autumn Plant shouldn’t dare act recklessly before him.

However, as Cleansing Flame and the others were rejoicing, Ink Feather sneered at them.

“Don’t celebrate too soon! Black Flame’s appearance here is just perfect!” Looking at Shi Feng’s distant figure, Ink Feather smiled faintly. “He turned War Blood into everyone’s laughingstock previously. Now, we’ll let him know that he won’t get off scot-free for interfering in War Blood’s matters!”

After saying so, Ink Feather shot a dazzling arrow into the sky, which was visible even from 10,000 yards away.

Immediately afterward, the War Blood members patrolling on speedboats in the vicinity each took out a stone with strange runes engraved on it. They then began frenziedly pumping their Mana into the stone.

Suddenly, a storm brewed, blanketing the entire sea zone. Simultaneously, multiple barriers emerged from the ocean, thoroughly enveloping Shi Feng’s group of four. An endless supply of water-type Mana also bound them, the restriction weakening their Basic Attributes and physique by 30%.

“What a powerful restriction.” Shi Feng was a little surprised by this situation.

There were very few magic arrays capable of affecting Tier 4 players significantly. Even a Master Magic Array would only be capable of reducing a Tier 4 player’s Basic Attributes; it would hardly affect a Tier 4 player’s physique. Nevertheless, the magic array used on them had reduced both their Basic Attributes and physique by a significant margin. This was truly an amazing magic array. “Hahaha! Black Flame, you’ve really barged your way into hell now!” Autumn Plant burst into delighted laughter when he saw that the magic barrier had taken effect. “We originally intended this Sea Prison to be a present for Heaven’s Blade’s Zwei. Now, though, we’re giving it to you. What do you think?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Under normal circumstances, Autumn Plant would still have to be afraid of Shi Feng. After all, Shi Feng was the first player to reach Tier 4. Hence, Shi Feng’s understanding of Tier 4 classes should greatly surpass his own. There was also the fact that the moves Autumn Plant had employed against Tier 3 players would have hardly any effect on Tier 4 players. However, the situation was different now.

The Sea Prison was a magic array capable of suppressing even Tier 4 existences significantly. While a 30% reduction of Basic Attributes couldn’t be considered significant, a 30% reduction of physique was massive. Such a suppression would basically reduce a Tier 4 physique to the Tier 3 standard.

With such a huge difference in physique, even if Shi Feng possessed astonishing Basic Attributes, he wouldn’t be a match for Autumn Plant.

“This Sea Prison is not bad, but you wasted it for nothing.”

After observing the runes on the barrier, Shi Feng found that this ancient magic array’s current performance could only be considered half-baked at best. At the very least, it needed over a dozen Master Magicians to exhibit its capabilities fully.

“What arrogance!” Upon seeing Shi Feng’s nonchalant behavior, Autumn Plant brandished his staff. “Death is already knocking on your door! I want to see just how long you can keep up your facade!”

After saying so, Autumn Plant summoned several dozen crimson chains that shot at Shi Feng.

Tier 4 Legacy Spell, Blood-bound Lock!

However, just as the crimson chains were about to reach Shi Feng, a ripple of Mana came from his body and stopped all of the chains cold one meter away from him.

Afterward, a voice entered Autumn Plant’s ears.

“This Binding Spell is pretty good. Unfortunately, you used it on the wrong person!”
