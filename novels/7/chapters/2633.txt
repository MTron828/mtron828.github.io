Chapter 2634 – Fame Spreads Across the Western Continent

The Silver Light Legion was Mythology’s strongest trump card legion. It might not have many members, but every member had astonishing combat power. Moreover, the peak experts of the legion all possessed the assistance of a battle array. All this time, the Silver Light Legion had been an existence the various superpowers dreaded.

Meanwhile, although Violet Light City was a Guild City jointly established by Violet Sword and Mythology, as many superpowers were partners with these Super Guilds, there were plenty of members of other superpowers present in the city.

Word of Sandstorm’s team suffering a tragic defeat triggered heated debates among the various superpowers’ members resting within Violet Light City. Some could not help doubting the validity of this information.

In their opinion, Mythology’s Silver Light Legion was basically an invincible existence. At this stage of the game, no matter how strong a team of players became, it would, at best, be the Silver Light Legion’s equal. The utter rout bruited about was definitely impossible for the Silver Light Legion. How could a pseudo-superpower like Zero Wing have a team capable of defeating the Silver Light Legion?

...

While the various superpowers operating in Violet Light City were looking into this matter, White Feather and the other survivors of Sandstorm’s team were currently standing inside a meeting room in Mythology’s Residence and reporting about it to the white-haired youth before them. White Feather and the others gazed at this white-haired youth with reverence in their eyes.

This was because this white-haired youth was none other than the Silver Light Legion’s vice commander, Prosciutto, nicknamed the Silver Ghost.

“You’re saying Zero Wing has over 100 members with fully unlocked Mana Bodies?” the Silver Ghost asked calmly as he looked at White Feather.

“Mhm. In addition, according to our investigations, before Azure’s Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian underwent Zero Wing’s special training, both of them were still quite some distance away from fully unlocking their Mana Bodies. Now, however, both of them have already done so, and they now rival Crimson Star and Wildfighter in combat power,” White Feather replied seriously while nodding.

“It seems Zero Wing has quite a lot of secrets,” Prosciutto commented as he entered deep thought.

“Vice Commander, they activated the Teleportation Gate not long ago. Why don’t I organize another team and wait for them to come out? Previously, we lost mainly because we were outnumbered. If we have more people in the team, Zero Wing won’t have much of an advantage over us,” White Feather suggested.

Now that news of the Silver Light Legion’s defeat had spread, they would definitely become a laughingstock among the superpowers if they could not take care of Zero Wing in short order.

“That won’t be necessary,” Prosciutto said. Chuckling, he continued, “Since Zero Wing wants to become famous, we’ll fulfill their wish. Notify the ones below and have them publicize this information. I believe plenty of superpowers and major corporations will be interested in Zero Wing’s secret for unlocking the Mana Body.”

“Vice Commander, although the other superpowers will definitely be interested in this secret, if we don’t make a move ourselves, I’m afraid no superpower will be willing to take action against Zero Wing. In the end, everyone will simply sit back and watch Zero Wing develop,” White Feather said worriedly.

“Relax. Soon, we’ll be done with the task the Demon God assigned us. At that time, the kingdoms and empires on the continent will no longer serve as a protective shield for the various powers. Meanwhile, with how much resources Zero Wing is occupying, it will become the common target of the superpowers. We won’t need to make a move at all,” Prosciutto said, smiling.

“That quest is almost complete?” White Feather’s eyes glowed with excitement when she heard Prosciutto’s words.

There were two crucial quests available in the Demon God’s Shrine, and the completion of either of them could kick up a storm throughout the western continent. Mythology had chosen to challenge one of those quests. Originally, though, she thought that they would need a lot more time to complete it.

If they really completed that quest, then even if Zero Wing cleared the ancient secret land’s Hero Trial, it would be meaningless. The only outcome awaiting Zero Wing would be destruction.

“Alright, go make the necessary preparations to publicize Zero Wing’s information. Also, send someone to the eastern continent to notify Vice Guild Leader Cold Shadow about the quest’s progress. She should know how to deal with Zero Wing,” Prosciutto commanded.

“Understood!” White Feather replied before leaving the meeting room.

News of Zero Wing having over a hundred experts with fully unlocked Mana Bodies spread across the entire western continent, instantly garnering great fame for Zero Wing. At the same time, though, the western continent’s powers also grew jealous of Zero Wing and started coveting its secrets. The Guild immediately became the focal point of the western continent as the various powers began investigating it.

...

As Zero Wing’s fame was spreading across the western continent, Crimson Star was leading Shi Feng and the others into the Hero Trial.

After everyone walked through the Teleportation Gate and arrived inside the trial grounds, they immediately fell silent. An indescribably solemn expression also appeared on their faces.

The reason for this was the intense gravity in the trial grounds. The moment they entered, it felt as if several hundred kilograms had been added to their bodies. Now, let alone fighting, even walking normally was a challenge.

In addition, the tunnel they were currently standing in was incomparably dark, which hampered their vision greatly. In fact, aside from their sense of sight, the rest of their five senses were also significantly blunted. Now, they felt as if the standard of their five senses wasn’t even on par with the five senses of Tier 1 players.

The worst part of it all was the tens of thousands of humanoid monsters ahead of them. Aside from being fully geared in armor, these humanoid monsters also held longswords and carried longbows on their backs. Looking at this scene, everyone could not help feeling that they had just entered an ancient battlefield.

...

[Trial Warrior] (Dark Creature, Great Lord)

[Trial Elite] (Dark Creature, Grand Lord)

...

However, before everyone could digest the information before them, the sound of system notifications entered their ears.

...

System: You have discovered the Hero Trial Space.

System: Hero Trial activated. You have five natural days to complete the trial. You will be awarded based on the trial’s Completion Rate.

...

“Five days?! How can we possibly get through so many monsters in just five days?!” Floating Light suspected that the system was toying with them when he stared at the endless Trial Warriors and Trial Elites before him.

The monsters in this trial space were ordinary monsters, which normally wouldn’t pose much of a threat to the experts on their team. However, that was in the outside world. Inside the trial space, their physical bodies and five senses were heavily suppressed. Even a Domain Realm expert like himself could barely exhibit 30% of his normal combat power under such a suppression.

At this moment, he would have great trouble fighting the Trial Warriors in a one-on-one situation, let alone the Trial Elites.

Meanwhile, there was only one path in this trial space, so there was no way they could avoid the Trial Warriors and Trial Elites entirely. The only way to get to the Trial Boss was to kill these monsters and gradually carve out a path.

Meanwhile, when Crimson Star and Wildfighter, who had started growing optimistic of success after witnessing Zero Wing’s strength, saw this scene, they were likewise stunned.

“Not only are the monsters here numerous, but they are also positioned very close together. Even if we lure just one of them, I’m afraid we’ll end up luring several thousand. In addition, all of these monsters are capable of ranged attacks. Let alone fighting, even dodging their attacks would be a problem...” Wildfighter frowned at the Trial Warriors and Trial Elites that filled the tunnel before him. Although he had long known that the Hero Trial would be difficult, he never thought that it would be this difficult. With their bodies so heavily suppressed, if they tried fighting several thousand of these monsters simultaneously, they would definitely be honeycombed in no time.

“Look closer; the weapons of those monsters are enchanted with the Penetrating effect. Not to mention other melee players, even MTs won’t be able to tank more than a handful of those monsters. The slightest mistake would mean death. Although I have some Spells that can stop a portion of the ranged attacks, there are simply too many monsters. The help I can provide will be negligible,” Crimson Star said, a bitter smile forming on her face as she pointed at the Trial Elites’ weapons. “Our only option is to have our ranged players kite the monsters and whittle away their numbers. However, if we do that, killing all these monsters in just five days will be utterly impossible.”

Upon hearing Crimson Star’s words, Duan Hanshan and the other experts from the Azure Chamber of Commerce also nodded in agreement.

Any melee expert that hadn’t reached the Void Realm would get slaughtered if they tried going up against more than a handful of these trial monsters by themselves. However, their team simply had too few peak experts. They couldn’t form a frontline capable of effectively holding off the trial monsters. Their only option was to have the ranged players kite the monsters and have the melee players repel any monsters that got too close for comfort. However, while this strategy was very safe, the efficiency was abysmal.

“Vice Commander Crimson, you say can block a portion of the ranged attacks?” Shi Feng asked after giving the matter some thought.

“Yes. I can block roughly 20% to 30% of the ranged attacks. However, there are simply too many monsters here. Against the attacks of several thousand monsters, even if I manage to block 30%, it will do little to no good for those dodging the attacks,” Crimson Star said, nodding.

“If you can block that much, then there shouldn’t be any problem,” Shi Feng said after making some mental calculations. “Afterward, my side will stand at the front and attract the monsters’ attacks. Everyone else just has to attack with everything you’ve got. We should be able to get to the Trial Boss within the stipulated time.”

“You’ll attract the attacks?”

Crimson Star was stunned by Shi Feng’s words. She simply couldn’t understand why Shi Feng didn’t consider this a problem. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

These were the simultaneous attacks of several thousand monsters they were talking about. Moreover, some of these monsters even had weapons with enhanced penetrative effects. Not to mention, in this horrible environment, even peak experts would have difficulty evading the attacks of the trial monsters, let alone Zero Wing’s members, who were mainly at the Refinement Realm standard.

However, before Crimson Star and the others could react to Shi Feng’s proposal, the Swordsman had already commanded Zero Wing’s 100-plus experts to take action. And these Zero Wing members immediately charged at the nearby Trial Warriors and Trial Elites without the slightest bit of hesitation.
