Chapter 460 – Tier 6 Super Spell

How is this possible?!

When everyone saw Crest collapse, the shock they experienced was many times greater than when they first saw the Holy Ancestor.

Previously, everyone still lacked a clear concept of Manoset’s strength since they didn’t have any knowledge regarding the existence of Holy Ancestors. It was similar to how they lacked a clear understanding of the strength of Primordial Gods since they had only ever read about them in historical records.

However, after seeing Manoset getting weakened to the Tier 5 standard and still nearly killing Crest in one hit, everyone finally understood just how powerful the Holy Ancestor was.

It should be known that Crest was a fifth-floor expert, an existence standing at the Greater God’s Domain’s apex. With his combat techniques and Fragmented Legendary items, he could tank Tier 6 monsters even as a Tier 5 player.

With a tank like Crest, a team of several dozen Tier 5 experts could even slay Tier 6 monsters of the same level. This was also why Frey dared to challenge the God Mode Courtyard of Space in the first place.

It really is a Gold Combat Technique! Is the Main God System playing a joke on us?

When Desolate Fury saw that Crest could no longer move his arms, he couldn’t help but despair a little.

Previously, Desolate Fury still wasn’t certain if Manoset had used a Gold Combat Technique. But now, he was certain.

As a Tier 5 tank himself, Desolate Fury knew better than anyone how difficult it was to damage a tank like Crest to such an extent.

Not only could Fragmented Legendary Shields neutralize a significant amount of damage their wielders received, but they could also dampen the force of attacks blocked to a significant extent. After taking into account that Crest had used a combat technique to redirect Manoset’s attack, the actual force that was transferred from Manoset’s fist to Crest’s shield shouldn’t exceed 10%.

Manoset might have astonishing Basic Attributes, but they were only at the standard of ordinary Tier 6 Divine monsters. With Crest’s Basic Attributes that were close to reaching the Tier 6 standard, there was no way a Tier 6 Divine monster could heavily injure him.

The only explanation Desolate Fury could come up with for this situation was that Manoset had used a Gold Combat Technique.

It should be known that players who mastered a Gold Combat Technique could transcend tiers and rank among the apex of the Greater God’s Domain. So, just how were they supposed to fight against a Tier 6 monster that had mastered a Gold Combat Technique?

“Mr. Black Flame, I’m afraid we can’t beat this monster. No matter how I look at it, I just can’t see us overcoming his Gold Combat Technique…” Unrestrained Lionheart said, wryly smiling when he saw Manoset ignoring them to target the Goddess’s Shadow instead.

“Gold Combat Technique?” Shi Feng chuckled when he heard Unrestrained Lionheart’s words. “What he’s using isn’t a Gold Combat Technique.”

It might look like Manoset had just used a Gold Combat Technique, but the move didn’t have anything to do with combat techniques. Instead, what the Holy Ancestor used was a Holy Art unique to the Holy Race.

Holy Aura was a method for players to enhance their raw offensive and defensive capabilities using Holy Power, whereas Holy Arts were essentially the evolution of Holy Aura. Or, more specifically, they were special methods of using Holy Aura. Meanwhile, similar to combat techniques, Holy Arts could be categorized into Bronze, Silver, and Gold ranks.

Hearing Shi Feng’s response, Unrestrained Lionheart shook his head and smiled, saying, “Even if what he used isn’t a Gold Combat Technique, it still doesn’t change our situation. It will take at least a few Tier 6 players to take him down.”

The many fifth-floor experts standing nearby nodded in agreement. It simply wasn’t feasible for Tier 5 players like them to fight against an existence like Manoset.

“Not really. We don’t need multiple Tier 6 players.” After pondering for a moment, Shi Feng said, “If we can have one Tier 6 combatant to distract him, defeating him isn’t out of the question.”

Holy Arts were different from combat techniques. In terms of improvements, Holy Arts provided a more well-rounded improvement, whereas combat techniques provided more extreme improvements. For example, some combat techniques might increase only the user’s offensive capabilities, some might only increase defensive capabilities, etc.

Only through such extreme improvements could Gold Combat Techniques let users transcend tiers. This also meant that Gold Holy Arts couldn’t let users transcend tiers.

“Is what you said true?” Frey asked as she looked at Shi Feng with a serious gaze. “Can we truly raid this Boss if we have a Tier 6 combatant?”

“Vice Guild Leader, could it be that you…” Unrestrained Lionheart panicked when he heard Frey’s words. Even though Frey hadn’t revealed her intentions, he could already guess where she was going with her words. “But that’s your last trump card for competing against the other Vice Guild Leaders…”

“It doesn’t matter. If we get annihilated here, I will be doomed regardless,” Frey said to Unrestrained Lionheart, shaking her head. Then, she returned her focus to Shi Feng and asked, “How confident are you, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

“If no accidents occur, we have a 50% chance of succeeding,” Shi Feng answered. Although the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s Final Boss turned out different from what he heard, in a situation where Manoset could not move from where he stood, defeating him wasn’t exactly impossible. After all, he had slain plenty of Tier 6 Holy Gods during his previous life. Slaying a Tier 5 Holy Ancestor who was partially immobilized shouldn’t be too difficult.

“50%?” Frey was surprised by Shi Feng’s answer. Then, she smiled and said, “Okay! I’ll place my bet on you!”

After saying so, Frey raised the staff she wielded and chanted an incantation.

Immediately, a silver, fivefold magic array appeared under Frey’s feet, the magic array taking up over half of the hall. Subsequently, Frey’s aura rapidly weakened, her soul falling into a weakened state in no time. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

At the same time, the fivefold magic array began to release a frightening aura.

“A dragon?”

“Amazing! Vice Guild Leader Frey is simply amazing! This is a Tier 5 Dragon we are talking about!”

Everyone was shocked when they saw the gigantic figure emerging from the fivefold magic array.

Is this Dragon Soul Summoning, one of Nethersoul’s three rumored abilities??Shi Feng was similarly astonished by the sight of the dragon emerging from the magic array.

…

[Ghost Dragon] (Dragon, Legendary)

Level 141

210,000,000,000

…

The Divine Weapon Nethersoul came attached with three Tier 6 Super Spells that surpassed even Tier 6 Curses.

Although Dragon Soul Summoning could only summon the soul of a dragon and not a living dragon, it was still plenty frightening.

At the very least, the Ghost Dragon before him definitely possessed combat power at the Tier 6 standard.

“Go!”

After summoning the Ghost Dragon, Frey promptly commanded it to attack Manoset.

“Annoying pest!”

When Manoset saw the Ghost Dragon swiping its claw at him, he removed his focus from the Goddess’s Shadow and threw a wall of punches at the immediate threat.
