Chapter 463 – World Mode’s First Clear?

Upon seeing Shi Feng pick up the Sacred Phantom Ring and hearing his command, everyone promptly snapped out of their dazes and went into action. Nobody present was a fool, so everyone understood that this was a crucial opportunity.

But will this really work? Unrestrained Lionheart wondered skeptically. Even though Manoset was currently looking pale and breathing heavily, Unrestrained Lionheart still couldn’t help but have his doubts about defeating the Holy Ancestor.

It was indeed astonishing that Shi Feng could heavily injure Manoset. If he had used that same attack against a Tier 6 tank, the latter would most likely have been killed on the spot, even with a Lifesaving Skill activated.

Only, while Manoset might be heavily injured, nothing had really changed for the team.

Firstly, while it was true that Boss monsters couldn’t actively recover from a heavily injured state, the negative state would only last for a very limited time. It was why teams would typically only heavily injure a Boss monster when the Boss in question had gone berserk.

Secondly, Manoset was ridiculously durable. Even in a heavily injured state, the Holy Ancestor still had 750 billion HP. That was more than what a Level 148, Tier 5 Dragon possessed. While Manoset could no longer benefit from the battle recovery effect, it would still take the team a long time to deal 750 billion damage, and time was a privilege they couldn’t afford.

However, despite his concerns, Unrestrained Lionheart did not dawdle in his actions. Immediately, he activated a Berserk Skill and began casting a threefold Tier 5 Spell.

At the same time as Unrestrained Lionheart was preparing his attack, the Tier 5 Rangers of the team also activated their Berserk Skills and bombarded Manoset with arrows. The Ghost Dragon that had lost a claw also opened its maw.

Tier 5 Skill, Heaven’s Rain!

Tier 5 Skill, Soul Chaser!

Tier 5 Skill, Nine-in-One!

Dragon Breath!

The Ghost Dragon’s breath attack carried power rivaling Tier 5 Curses. So, Manoset had no choice but to defend against the attack with his fists. This led to more than 200 arrows landing directly on his body.

-116,134,523!

-214,764,212!

-124,891,591!

…

Upon seeing the series of damage values appearing above Manoset’s head, everyone present couldn’t help but be stunned.

“Am I hallucinating?”

“Every arrow’s dealing over 100 million damage? Is the system bugged?”

Previously, when the team’s Tier 5 Rangers attacked Manoset, each of their arrows could only deal several million damage. Yet, now, each arrow was dealing over 100 million damage, and the entire volley of arrows had caused the Holy Ancestor to lose nearly 20 billion HP. All of a sudden, the goal of dealing 750 billion damage no longer looked as out of reach as it did previously.

“It’s doable! The raid’s doable!”

The melee players standing at the forefront grew ecstatic. Immediately, they sped up their charge toward Manoset so that they could quickly get in on the action as well.

“It seems we should also stop withholding our strength.”

When Death Omen saw the damage dealt by the Rangers, she promptly activated Shadow’s Power, a Berserk Skill that doubled her Strength and Agility and improved her reaction speed by 30%.

Thousand Scars also followed suit and activated her Berserk Skill Divine Flame. Immediately, the two daggers she wielded transformed into scorching flames that behaved like serpents, the flame serpents attacking Manoset and causing damage in the tens of millions. Although each of Thousand Scars’ attacks didn’t deal as much damage as the Tier 5 Rangers’ arrows, her high Attack Speed allowed her to match the Rangers’ damage output.

Meanwhile, once the team’s melee players started landing attacks on Manoset, the team’s overall damage output more than doubled.

Even though Manoset was wildly flinging punches, as the power of his punches couldn’t even reach the Tier 6 standard right now, they were of no threat to the Tier 5 players present. At most, the punches only let him block a portion of the incoming attacks.

76%… 52%… 33%…

Manoset lost dozens of billions of HP with every round of attacks he suffered, which resulted in his HP bar decreasing by visible chunks. However, the lower the Holy Ancestor’s HP fell, the slower the decrease became.

“Faster! Faster! We need to be faster!”

When Shi Feng saw Manoset’s punches becoming faster and stronger, he knew that the Holy Ancestor would soon recover from his heavily injured state. Meanwhile, once Manoset recovered, it would be a pipe dream for their team to defeat him.

When Manoset’s HP fell to 25%, the gaping hole in his chest had already recovered by 90%, and a silver heart had started to take shape in the hole.

“Hahaha!”

When Manoset saw that he was close to fully recovering, he laughed and stopped defending against the incoming attacks. Instead, he scanned the players before him with a contemptuous gaze, causing everyone to experience unprecedented intimidation.

Holy Art, Splitting Star!

After Manoset let out a loud roar, a gigantic illusory fist smashed down on the hall like a falling star. Partway through its descent, the star split into countless meteorites that carried as much power as the Holy Ancestor’s punches.

Seeing this, Shi Feng promptly stopped holding back, the Winter of Eternal Night in his hand unleashed a dark aura that enveloped its surroundings.

Radiant Night!

Sword’s Orbit!

Under Radiant Night’s effect, every one of Shi Feng’s attacks carried power at the Tier 6 standard and dealt damage in the hundreds of millions to Manoset. While executing Sword’s Orbit, Shi Feng could land over thirty attacks on the Holy Ancestor every second, which translated to more than ten billion damage every second.

25%… 23%… 21%…

As Manoset’s HP fell, the number of players killed by the descending meteorites also increased.

80… 62… 45…

In only a few seconds, the team lost over 40 players. Of the team’s surviving members, only those at the fifth-floor standard could dodge the rain of meteorites perfectly. As for titled experts, they could only pray that they weren’t targeted by more than two meteorites at a time. Otherwise, unless they were a tank, they would be killed on the spot.

Is it still not enough?

Shi Feng couldn’t help but feel disappointed when he saw that the team had less than 30 members remaining and that Manoset had recovered from his heavily injured state.

Currently, Manoset still had 20% of his HP remaining. With fewer than 30 players on the team, they wouldn’t be able to defeat the Holy Ancestor even if he was still heavily injured. So, it’d be even more impossible to defeat Manoset now that he was no longer heavily injured.

“This is the end of the line for you ants!” Manoset said, his body seemingly growing a little larger after he had recovered from his injuries. Then, he sent a flurry of punches at Shi Feng and the others.

Sure enough, it’s a failure… Frey sighed deeply when she saw the wall of punches coming at her.

However, just as everyone thought the wall of punches would devour them, the Goddess’s Shadow, who had been maintaining the seal on Manoset all this time, suddenly moved.

“You’ve done well to weaken Manoset to such an extent, Heaven’s Blessed,” the Goddess’s Shadow said as she raised her hands.

Immediately, Eternal Energy flooded the hall, and the space around Manoset began to twist and shrink rapidly, forcing the Holy Ancestor to shrink with it. In the blink of an eye, Manoset’s ten-meter-tall body was reduced to just one meter, then to the size of a rice grain, and ultimately to an indiscernible speck.

This scene dumbfounded everyone in the hall.

He’s dead? Shi Feng was similarly stunned by Manoset’s abrupt disappearance.

A Holy Ancestor!

An existence comparable to Primordial Gods was eliminated, just like that…

Before Shi Feng could come back to his senses, a series of system notifications sounded in everyone’s ears.
