Chapter 370 – Tier 5 Advanced Epic!

Shi Feng’s firm words rendered Laura and her party members speechless.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, the current Zero Wing is indeed close to catching up to the various hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World, but the forces the Divine Seal Saint can send here go far beyond the various hegemonic powers,” Laura patiently explained. “Tier 4 players might be rare in the Miniature Ancient World, but they are everywhere in the Greater God’s Domain. Once the World Passage opens, it won’t take the Paimon Conglomerate more than two or three days to clear out the entire passage and flood the Miniature Ancient World with Tier 4 experts. At that time, we aren’t talking about facing just a few hundred or a few thousand Tier 4 experts, but hundreds of thousands instead. Moreover, these Tier 4 experts will have much better weapons and equipment.”

Travel across a World Passage might be challenging, but with the Paimon Conglomerate’s strength and influence, it would have no trouble transporting a few hundred thousand Tier 4 experts into the Miniature Ancient World. Meanwhile, such a force was enough to destroy the entire Miniature Ancient World many times over, let alone destroy Zero Wing.

It didn’t matter even if Shi Feng possessed a Legendary Weapon.

Once the World Passage opened, players entering the Miniature Ancient World might have to deal with level and tier restrictions, but there wouldn’t be any restrictions on weapons, equipment, and tools.

It might be hard to come by Legendary Weapons and Equipment in the current Miniature Ancient World, but there were plenty in the Greater God’s Domain. For a long-standing existence like the Paimon Conglomerate, the number of Legendary Weapons and Equipment under its possession vastly outstripped even the various hegemonic powers. So long as the Paimon Conglomerate sent over a few of its Legendary Weapons and Equipment, Shi Feng would be doomed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Shi Feng was admittedly very strong, but how many players equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment could he go up against simultaneously?

However, Shi Feng did not bother explaining his decision to Laura. Instead, he asked, “Commander Laura, are you planning to take on the Greater God’s Domain once you get promoted to Tier 5?”

Laura’s identity and strength were a big mystery to Shi Feng. When Shi Feng met Laura, the other party’s primary goal was to enter the Greater God’s Domain. They had even signed a contract around this condition.

However, it also seemed like Laura was considerably knowledgeable about the Greater God’s Domain and knew that it’d be incredibly dangerous to roam the Greater God’s Domain as a Tier 4 player. Hence, she had yet to leave the Miniature Ancient World until now.

“That is indeed my intention.” Laura was initially stunned, failing to understand why Shi Feng would ask such a question. However, she still chose to give Shi Feng a proper answer. “Although the Miniature Ancient World still holds many secrets, many more opportunities are available in the Greater God’s Domain.”

The Miniature Ancient World would no longer hold much value to her once she reached Tier 5.

A big part of why she came to find Shi Feng this time was to return the favor she owed him. Meanwhile, she would return this favor by bringing Zero Wing’s members into the Greater God’s Domain with her.

“How about making another deal with me, Commander Laura?” Shi Feng asked.

“A deal? What kind of deal?” Laura grew even more confused. Rather than try to get out of his current predicament, Shi Feng was instead looking to make a deal with her? What was he even thinking?

“Once you are promoted to Tier 5, stay in the Miniature Ancient World and protect Zero Wing for a month,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “In exchange, I can help you go further in your Tier 5 promotion!”

The woman known as Laura Crader undoubtedly possessed extraordinary strength. Even though she had only revealed a portion of her strength thus far, it was already enough to put her in the top 10 of the Miniature Ancient World’s God List.

Moreover, Laura was confident in breaking through the Paimon Conglomerate’s blockade once she became a Tier 5 Sword Saint. If that were the case, she’d be of even greater help to Zero Wing if she remained in the Miniature Ancient World.

Shi Feng needed to participate in the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition, so he wouldn’t be able to stay in the Miniature Ancient World to protect Zero Wing during that period. If Zero Wing could have Laura protecting it, he could participate in the competition without any worries.

“Go further in the Tier 5 promotion?” An elderly male Elementalist from the Glimmer adventurer team laughed when he heard Shi Feng’s words. “Young man, do you know what rank Commander Laura can achieve when creating her Tier 5 Mana Body?”

Aside from the elderly Elementalist, the three other unfamiliar faces in Laura’s party also laughed.

“Epic rank, right?” Shi Feng said blandly.

Apart from reaching level 140, Tier 4 players seeking to get promoted to Tier 5 in God’s Domain also needed to create a Tier 5 Mana Body that suited them. Meanwhile, the Tier 5 Mana Bodies players created would vary in strength, the ranks going from Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Epic.

For most paragons in the Greater God’s Domain, their lifelong goal was to create a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body. That way, they could become a powerhouse in the Greater God’s Domain once they reached Tier 6. Meanwhile, the Divine Seal Saint was one such powerhouse.

It was also why many paragons refused to get promoted to Tier 5. Only, out of the many paragons in the Greater God’s Domain, less than 1% of them would succeed in creating a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body.

“You are indeed insightful, Guild Leader Black Flame,” the elderly Elementalist said, nodding. Then, with a proud smile on his face, he continued, “You are correct. Commander Laura can already create a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body. So, do you still think you can be of any help to her?”

In the Greater God’s Domain, even conglomerates would celebrate for three days and three nights if one of their paragons managed to create a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body, while hegemonic powers would celebrate ten days and ten nights if they gained such a paragon.

In response, Shi Feng looked at the elderly Elementalist before saying, “What if I say I can help Commander Laura push her Mana Body to the Advanced Epic rank?”

“The Advanced Epic rank?” The elderly Elementalist didn’t believe Shi Feng’s words for even a moment. “Are you playing a joke on this old man, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

It was true that the Epic rank wasn’t the limit for Tier 5 Mana Bodies. Above Epic Mana Bodies were Advanced Epic Mana Bodies.

However, even acquiring a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body was already an astounding achievement in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone a Tier 5 Advanced Epic Mana Body. According to his knowledge, individuals capable of reaching this standard were all mythical figures in the Greater God’s Domain.

What did it mean to be a mythical figure in the Greater God’s Domain?

It meant that every one of these individuals was qualified to antagonize apex powers!
