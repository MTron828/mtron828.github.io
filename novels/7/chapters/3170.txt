Chapter 245 – Demon God’s Armament

“Zero Wing got promoted into a Bronze Guild?”

“Amazing! Zero Wing actually got promoted into a Bronze Guild already! As expected of the Guild responsible for starting the Myriad Worlds’ Descent! With this, our local Guilds have finally surpassed the foreign God’s Domains’ Guilds in something!”

“I just checked, and it seems that a Bronze Guild has 30,000 special authority slots that can be used to gain priority entry into any NPC City!”

“Crap! Doesn’t this mean that Zero Wing’s members can freely enter even NPC Cities that have already fallen into the hands of other God’s Domains?”

“This means that the foreign God’s Domains’ powers will have difficulty taking Zero Wing’s territories even if they want to. Zero Wing can make a fortune by using this advantage to trade with other local powers. Not even the Five Great Super Guilds can be a match for Zero Wing now since they have occupied only one NPC City. At most, the Auction House in their city will be connected with the Auction Houses of several neighboring cities. In comparison, Zero Wing can freely access the Auction Houses of every NPC City.”

After the system announcement was repeated three times, the Miniature Ancient World’s local players instantly went into an uproar, many going to the official forums to discuss Zero Wing. Particularly, the topic of how to join Zero Wing became the focus of many people’s attention.

For a time, Zero Wing became the most desired Guild for players to join in the Miniature Ancient World.

…

“Dammit! How did things turn out like this?!”

Inside the top-floor VIP room of a high-class restaurant, Jing Yang’s rage shot through the roof when he learned about the details regarding Bronze Guilds.

Previously, he had chosen to withdraw Blackwater from the Asura Mercenary Alliance because he wanted Zero Wing to know Blackwater’s significance to the mercenary alliance. However, Zero Wing had quickly proved him wrong time and again.

First, Zero Wing had revealed astonishing foundations by forcing its way into the Boundary Mountain Range with only a team of 100 players. Moreover, out of these 100 players, there were three fourth-floor experts that even a hegemonic power like Bright Dragon had to be wary of. Now, Zero Wing had even gotten promoted into a Bronze Guild, instantly solidifying its position in the Miniature Ancient World.

In contrast, Blackwater had only managed to secure the management rights to a small NPC City after joining forces with other superpowers. Moreover, they weren’t even certain if they could retain their hold over this NPC City.

It hadn’t been more than a day since the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack took effect. There would be more and more players from foreign God’s Domains entering the Miniature Ancient World from now on. So, competition in the Miniature Ancient World would only grow even more intense in the future.

How was he supposed to explain himself to his superiors?

It should be known that it was entirely his decision to withdraw Blackwater from the Asura Mercenary Alliance. Now that Zero Wing had become a Bronze Guild, it instantly became the most sought-after partner for all local powers. After all, players needed the various services the various NPC Cities offered.

At this moment, the representatives of the other powers, which had also withdrawn from the Asura Mercenary Alliance, in the room were similarly filled with mixed feelings.

As for Thousand Swords, he sighed deeply after reading about the details of Bronze Guilds and said, “It seems I’ll have to pay Zero Wing a visit.”

“Teacher, can our Guild really not survive in the Miniature Ancient World without Zero Wing?” Gu Yiren asked with a confused expression.

World Dominators was a veteran Super Guild. In Gu Yiren’s opinion, World Dominators should have no problem securing its hold over a small NPC City, so he felt it unnecessary to seek partnership with Zero Wing.

“It’s going to be very difficult,” Thousand Swords said and shook his head after giving Gu Yiren’s question some thought. “This is only the Myriad Worlds’ Descent’s first day. The players we have seen thus far are only the vanguard of the various foreign powers. Once those foreign powers start to dispatch more God-ranked experts, even the Five Great Super Guilds will have difficulty safeguarding their city, let alone other superpowers like us.

“Also, even if I visit Zero Wing, it’s uncertain whether Zero Wing will agree to partner with us…”

Thousand Swords couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile when he spoke up to this point. Although he had long since known that the powers of other God’s Domains would be very powerful, he didn’t think they would be so powerful that they’d have experts capable of rivaling him among their younger generation.

Moreover, this was only the first day of the new expansion pack. The various foreign powers were only testing the waters with their younger members. Hardly any of their veteran experts had made a move yet…

…

Red Obsidian City, Flower of Seven Sins’ Residence:

“We have finished reallocating our core members and resources, Commander Omen. We have already sold all of our Lands and Shops in the various NPC Cities, and we can set out for Shadow Fog City at any time,” a Level 110 masked Ranger said respectfully to the bewitching woman resting in the office.

“Have everyone move out, then,” Death Omen commanded. Then, while looking at the report on her desk, she said, “A Bronze Guild, is it? Count yourselves lucky. Once the Level 120 maps open, we’ll see how you can continue retaining your place in the Miniature Ancient World!”

After saying so, Death Omen left her office and withdrew from Red Obsidian City with the rest of the Flower of Seven Sins’ members. Then, they moved toward Shadow Fog City, a large NPC City controlled by Bright Dragon.

…

While the Flower of Seven Sins was secretly moving its base of operations, Shi Feng had teleported to Zero Wing’s Residence in Abyssal Star City, not daring to stay even a moment longer in Hundred Flow City’s Adventurer’s Association.

Aren’t these rewards a little too much?

Even after reading the system notification exclusive to him several times, Shi Feng still couldn’t help but feel astonished.

During his previous life, Zero Wing had conducted its promotion into a Bronze Guild in the Greater God’s Domain, so it didn’t receive any rewards for its promotion. Although he had fortunately acquired a Bronze Cross-Border Guild Promotion Order in this life, he didn’t think becoming the first Bronze Guild would come with such abundant rewards.

It was incredibly difficult for a Guild to raise its God’s Domain Fame in the Greater God’s Domain. Yet, God’s Domain Fame was crucial for Guilds to get promoted beyond the Bronze rank. For example, a Large-scale Crisis Quest would only award a Guild with 1,000 Fame Points. Yet, a Bronze Guild needed 500,000 God’s Domain Fame Points to get promoted to the Silver rank.

Aside from needing Fame to get promoted, a Bronze Guild that had accumulated 200,000 Fame Points could apply with the Adventurer’s Association to construct a World Tower of its own. Although Bronze Guilds could only construct the first two floors of the World Tower, it was still a privilege that many Bronze Guilds dreamed of obtaining. This was because players would need to pay 100 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal each time they applied to challenge the Advanced Adventurer Certification with the Adventurer’s Association.

Indeed. The application fee was charged in Seven Luminaries Crystals, not Coins or Magic Crystals.

However, if a Guild managed to acquire its own World Tower, it could lower the fee by 50%. This would drastically reduce the Seven Luminaries Crystals it needed to spend to let its members take the Advanced Adventurer Certification.

Now that Zero Wing had received 100,000 God’s Domain Fame as soon as it had become a Bronze Guild, it would no doubt save Zero Wing a lot of time in the future.

However, compared to the Guild rewards, the personal rewards Shi Feng received were what truly surprised him. Not only did he receive three level-ups, which instantly propelled him to Level 120, but he also received a Legendary Legacy Scroll and an Overtier Spell Book. Both of these two items were of extraordinary value, and they normally could not be bought with money.

An Overtier Spell Book was a spell capable of exhibiting strength above its tier. For example, a Tier 3 Overtier Spell could exhibit power at the standard of Tier 4 Spells, while a Tier 4 Overtier Spell could exhibit power at the standard of Tier 5 Spells.

Typically, a Tier 3 Overtier Spell Book would be worth one piece of Fragmented Legendary Equipment. As for Tier 4 Overtier Spell Books, their value exceeded even Fragmented Legendary Weapons.

Moreover, the Tier 4 Overtier Spell that Shi Feng received was even a Berserk-type Spell.

…

[Demon God’s Armament]

Tier 4 Overtier Spell

Requires: Tier 4

Upon use, borrow the Demon God’s power to create a set of weapons and equipment with 100% adaptability, increasing the effects of all your weapons and equipment by 100%.

Duration: 60 seconds nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Cooldown: 1 hour

…

The greater a player’s equipment standard, the more strength they could draw from this Tier 4 Overtier Spell. In Shi Feng’s opinion, the effects of Demon God’s Armament were not the least bit inferior to a Tier 5 Overtier Spell.

After carefully keeping the Overtier Spell Book away, Shi Feng turned his attention to the ancient dark-purple scroll in his bag.

If he were to say that Demon God’s Armament had given him a pleasant surprise, this ancient dark-purple scroll had given him a fright.
