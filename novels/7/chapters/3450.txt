Chapter 525 – Godlike Line-Up

Incredible! This is simply incredible!

It felt like I would have been obliterated if I had just touched that energy blade, yet she managed to deflect it! No wonder Guild Leader Black Flame is so relaxed! With such capabilities, she can already fight true Tier 6 players!

Liu Wusheng and the others were greatly astonished by Ink Qilin’s combat capabilities when they saw the fissure that had resulted from Nightmare Chaser’s attack getting deflected. At the same time, they couldn’t help but put themselves in Ink Qilin’s shoes and wonder how they would do against Nightmare Chaser’s attack.

However, no matter how many simulations they ran in their minds, they could only get one result—instant death!

The gap between them and Ink Qilin was simply massive. Whether it was technique or Basic Attributes, they were vastly inferior to Ink Qilin.

Good! We should have a fighting chance now! Hidden Soul thought, hints of expectation and joy coloring her gloomy face when she saw Ink Qilin mostly unscathed.

Originally, Hidden Soul was already close to falling into despair. After all, she knew the difference between Tier 5 and Tier 6 players. When she was still active on the main continent, the best she could ever do as a Tier 5 player was threaten Tier 6 players. It was a qualitative difference that could not be overcome with numbers alone.

Not to mention, Nightmare Chaser wasn’t your average Tier 6 player.

If it was with her current combat standard, Hidden Soul was confident she could defeat the Tier 6 players she had previously faced on the main continent. However, she had zero confidence she could triumph against Nightmare Chaser.

After all, as a fifth-floor expert, Nightmare Chaser could sweep the floor with her even if they were at the same tier, let alone having a one-tier advantage.

In a certain sense, the Tier 6 Nightmare Chaser was even more terrifying of a foe than the Hades Society, Primal Empire, and Sacred Tribe’s 50,000-plus Tier 5 experts.

But now that Ink Qilin had shown herself capable of fending off Nightmare Chaser’s attack, it would take a lot of pressure off of Abyssal Star City if she could keep him pinned.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Nightmare Chaser didn’t seem all too surprised to see Ink Qilin overcome his attack.

“Not bad! As expected of a vice commander of Scarecrow Fox,” Nightmare Chaser praised as he looked at Ink Qilin. “With how effortlessly you deflected my attack, I can say with certainty that you’ll be put onto the Divine Glory List the day you decide to advance to Tier 6. That Great Commander of yours will have a wide smile on his face when he learns of how much you have improved.”

“You overpraise me, sir,” Ink Qilin calmly responded as she looked at Nightmare Chaser. “If not for the miniature world suppressing you, I wouldn’t have been able to deflect your attack so easily.”

As soon as Ink Qilin finished speaking, Hidden Soul and the others couldn’t help but gasp.

That devastating attack was subjected to the world’s suppression?

Many native players couldn’t help but find Ink Qilin’s words unbelievable. It was especially so for the native players who had seen Tier 6 players in action on the main continent before. They had a very hard time believing that Nightmare Chaser’s devastating attack was subjected to any form of suppression.

Of the players present, only those who had spent time in the Greater God’s Domain knew that Ink Qilin wasn’t lying.

Every world in God’s Domain, be it a main world or a miniature world, had a protection mechanism for native players against foreign players. If players entered a foreign world, they would face a suppression that would increase in strength along with tiers, and the suppression for Tier 6 players was absurdly powerful.

This was why most worlds in the Greater God’s Domain remained under the control of native powers.

As Nightmare Chaser wasn’t a native player of the Miniature Ancient World, he would face a 40% suppression to his Basic Attributes and Physique as a foreign Tier 6 player. In other worlds, Nightmare Chaser could only perform at 60% of his peak in the Miniature Ancient World.

Of course, even with his Basic Attributes and Physique suppressed to such a significant extent, he was still far above Tier 5 players in these regards.

Meanwhile, after praising Ink Qilin, Nightmare Chaser turned to look at Shi Feng, who stood behind Ink Qilin.

“It seems you weren’t behaving arrogantly without reason, young man,” Nightmare Chaser said, chuckling as he stroked his long beard. “But I wonder, how will you behave if you have to face two Tier 6s?”

Upon hearing Nightmare Chaser’s words, the players in Abyssal Star City couldn’t help but shudder and think that he must be joking.

It was already plenty unbelievable for one Tier 6 player to appear.

Two Tier 6 players? Was that even possible?

“Nightmare, you old bastard! Couldn’t you keep your mouth shut?!”

Suddenly, a man shrouded in black mist appeared next to Nightmare Chaser. As if the mist-shrouded man had always been there, nobody noticed how he arrived next to Nightmare Chaser. At the same time, following the mist-shrouded man’s arrival, a terrifying Divine Might spread across Abyssal Star City, causing everyone to feel as if a hand was gripping their heart.

Tier 6!

Another Tier 6!

“Heavens! What in the world is happening here?! The Hades Society sending Nightmare Chaser here is already crazy enough. Now, even the Primal Empire has lost its mind and mobilized Wraith Saint?!” One Step got goosebumps as he looked at the two figures in the sky.

Melissa was also visibly shocked by this sudden turn of events.

Whether it was Nightmare Chaser or Wraith Saint, both were famous individuals in the Void Sea. Any one of them appearing on the battlefield could cause a great uproar. Yet, now, both of them had entered the Miniature Ancient World and were working together to besiege a city…

Meanwhile, Myriad Spears Daylight and Unsleeping Death Death Stride smirked when they saw the reactions of the players in Abyssal Star City. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ink Qilin was indeed amazing for being able to slay Heratis and deflect an attack from Nightmare Chaser. But when faced with both Nightmare Chaser and Wraith Saint, what could she do?

What do we have for them to mobilize two Tier 6 experts? Hidden Soul wryly smiled as she looked at the two figures in the sky, unsure of what the Asura Mercenary Alliance could possibly do to get out of this predicament.

As for Liu Wusheng and the others, they thoroughly fell into despair.

“Young lady from Scarecrow Fox.” At this time, Nightmare Chaser suddenly looked at Ink Qilin and smiled, saying, “If you turn away and leave now, I can pretend as if you were never here out of respect for your Great Commander. You have three seconds to consider.”

When Wraith Saint heard Nightmare Chaser’s suggestion, he wasn’t particularly surprised.

Scarecrow Fox was a powerful adventurer team that even the Hades Society would prefer to avoid provoking. Scarecrow Fox’s Great Commander was especially someone to be feared.

“Thank you for your goodwill, but please forgive me for refusing it, sir,” Ink Qilin said, shaking her head. Then, in an earnest tone, she continued, “At the same time, I would like to advise you that it is not a wise choice to make an enemy out of Guild Leader Black Flame.”

“Not a wise choice?” Nightmare Chaser laughed. He felt like he had just heard the funniest joke of the century. However, he did not try to argue with Ink Qilin. Instead, he turned to Wraith Saint and said, “I’ll keep this girl pinned while you deal with the other kid. We’ll show this little girl what wisdom really means!”

“Fine. But you owe me a favor,” Wraith Saint said out of annoyance.

“Sure.” Nightmare Chaser nodded.

When Nightmare Chaser finished speaking, Wraith Saint disappeared and reappeared twice in quick succession, the distance between him and Shi Feng shortening significantly with each reappearance. In the meantime, Nightmare Chaser brandished his saber, sending multiple energy blades in Ink Qilin’s direction to keep her busy.

Many of the various hegemonic powers’ executives sighed at this scene. This was because they could tell that Shi Feng was doomed this time.

However, when Wraith Saint disappeared from everyone’s eyes for the third time, several arrows targeted him from multiple directions, forcing him to reappear. Then, two figures appeared directly in front and behind him, the one in front charging him with a shield while the one in the back swung an axe at him.

Boom!

The three sides separated as soon as they collided. Immediately afterward, Wraith Saint could be seen reappearing nearby, a solemn look on his face as he looked at his three new opponents.

Three Golden Masters?
