Chapter 2862 - Hunter? Or Hunted?

Quasi Eagle’s words agitated the Tier 4 experts around him so much that they wished they could charge forward and finish off the seven native players in front of them immediately. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Currently, the Alliance’s price for native Tier 4 experts was 300 Contribution Points per kill. If a curse was used on the kill, they would receive 1,000 points.

These prices represented a fortune, even for the luxury zone’s residents, let alone residents of the commoner zone like themselves. If converted into income, 1,000 Alliance Contribution Points were equivalent to ten years of salary for an ordinary person living in the luxury zone.

Indeed! The Interstellar Alliance’s bounty for native Tier 4s was that high!

This demonstrated the Interstellar Alliance’s determination in acquiring this God’s Domain.

More importantly, Alliance Contribution Points could be exchanged for money but not vice versa. Meanwhile, Alliance Contribution Points could be used to exchange for many items and resources that normally could not be bought with money.

Hence, the seven Tier 4 players in front of them were basically walking treasure troves. Even if they split the points among their group, they would still earn a significant income.

However, Awakened Abyss did not respond to Quasi Eagle’s question. Instead, he stared at the group of native players in front of him. More precisely, he was looking at the cloaked man standing at the head of this group. Despite being surrounded by over 100 Tier 4 combatants and suppressed by a Master Magic Array, this cloaked man remained incredibly calm.

“Guild Leader Black Flame! You’ve really made me search for you!”

Awakened Abyss ignored everyone around him, focusing solely on Shi Feng, the words he uttered carrying endless rage and killing intent.

Although Awakened Abyss had eventually gotten rescued from Sky Spring City’s prison, his reputation in the Guild had still plummeted. As a result, despite being one of the Guild’s top three talents, he had no choice but to complete a bunch of meaningless missions, such as hunting down Shining Tiger’s Tier 4 experts.

Hence, Awakened Abyss bore deep hatred for Shi Feng. Only, after the World Passage opened, he had not obtained any information on Shi Feng’s whereabouts, so he had no opportunity to reclaim his honor.

However, Shi Feng ignored Awakened Abyss’s anger and hatred entirely. Looking at the young man, Shi Feng said calmly, “So, it’s Commander Abyss of Hundred Ghosts. It seems you’ve improved a lot since we last met.”

Awakened Abyss was evidently much stronger than when Shi Feng saw him in Sky Spring City.

The young man had not only reached Level 145 but even broken through the 100% threshold of his Mana Body; his Mana Body’s Completion Rate definitely rivaled Fithalia’s.

Most importantly, aside from sporting Epic Set Equipment, Awakened Abyss also had three Fragmented Legendary items on him. Given that he was at the Domain Realm and had gotten far in the Realms of Truth, the combat power he could display was most likely superior to the average Tier 4 NPC’s.

“That’s right! This is all thanks to you, Guild Leader Black Flame!” Awakened Abyss gnashed his teeth at Shi Feng’s words. “Since we had the fortune of meeting today, how about we - 11

Just as Awakened Abyss was about to propose a duel, Jade Leaf hurriedly tugged his sleeve and said quietly, “Abyss, don’t mess around! His strength has already reached monstrous levels! Moreover, the Elder told you that now still isn’t the time for us to make an enemy of Black Flame!”

Awakened Abyss had been imprisoned in Sky Spring City, so he had not witnessed the battle outside the Secret Covenant Tower.

Back then, not only did Shi Feng single-handedly slay hundreds of weakened Tier 4 Faux Saint Saboteurs as if he was cutting up a bunch of vegetables, but he also revealed extraordinary trump cards.

Shi Feng also possessed an incredibly powerful Mana Domain. When he deployed his Mana Domain, none of the Faux Saint Saboteurs managed to exhibit more than half of their usual combat power.

While one of the reasons Windshadow had chosen to surrender to Zero Wing was indeed the Mobile Fortress’s threat, a larger part was Shi Feng’s trump cards. Hence, he had chosen to surrender and compensate Zero Wing.

Although their hunting group currently had a significant advantage in numbers and even had a Master Magic Array suppressing Shi Feng, Jade Leaf still couldn’t see their group having any chance of victory against Shi Feng’s party.

At Jade Leafs reminder, Awakened Abyss gradually cooled down.

“I know!”

Although Awakened Abyss wanted nothing more than to kill Shi Feng right now, his circumstances were no longer the same as before. He could no longer afford to act willfully. Take Jade Leaf, for example. In addition to protecting him, she was also tasked with supervising him.

If Awakened Abyss dared defy Windshadow’s command and Jade Leaf reported his disobedience, it wouldn’t matter whether he managed to kill Shi Feng or not; nothing good would come of it. In fact, he might get even more marginalized in the Guild.

After Awakened Abyss finished his conversation with Jade Leaf, he turned to Quasi Eagle.

“Commander Eagle, remove the barrier! We’re leaving!”

At Awakened Abyss’s words, Quasi Eagle and the other Tier 4 experts of the hunting party were all stunned.

“What’s going on?” Sixteenth Cloud also goggled in shock. She couldn’t understand why the situation had taken such an unexpected turn.

While she wasn’t aware of the history between Awakened Abyss and Shi Feng, she could tell from the anger and hatred Awakened Abyss had displayed toward Shi Feng a moment ago that Awakened Abyss wouldn’t let them go. In fact, it was already incredible that Awakened Abyss did not take action immediately.

Yet, Awakened Abyss was now saying to let them go. If not for her clearly sensing the resentment Awakened Abyss radiated, she would even suspect that Awakened Abyss had merely been feigning anger before and that he actually had an excellent relationship with Shi Feng.

Let alone Sixteenth Cloud, even Shi Feng found this situation surprising. He couldn’t help wondering if Awakened Abyss had blown a fuse or two in his brain from his previous outburst and had a slip of the tongue.

“Commander Abyss, what are you saying?” Looking at Awakened Abyss in confusion, Quasi Eagle asked, “We’ve expended so much manpower and resources to hunt them down, yet you want us to just release them?”

It wasn’t easy to hunt down and surround the native superpowers’ Tier 4 experts, who were now operating very cautiously.

If it were before, they would’ve required a team of only a dozen or so Tier 4 combatants to hunt down a handful of native Tier 4s. Now, they needed to mobilize over a hundred Tier 4 combatants just for three of Shining Tiger’s Tier 4 experts.

Since their hunting group had surrounded seven Tier 4 experts—four more than expected —they would make a fortune if they simply finished the job. Yet, Awakened Abyss was telling them to let these Tier 4 experts go. For a moment, Quasi Eagle suspected that Awakened Abyss had gone crazy.

In response, Awakened Abyss clenched his fists and repeated, “Yes, let them go.”

Sixteenth Cloud and her two Guildmates heaved a deep sigh of relief at Awakened Abyss’s affirmation. Although they didn’t know why such a situation was happening or who exactly Awakened Abyss was, Awakened Abyss appeared to be the leader of this hunting group. And since the leader had spoken, her party should be safe.

However, contrary to the Shining Tiger trio’s expectations, Quasi Eagle, the mercenaries’ leader, behaved as if he had not heard Awakened Abyss’s command. He didn’t call off his subordinates or remove the Master Magic Array

“Sorry, but I cannot listen to your words, Commander Abyss. I don’t know what kind of relationship you have with this Guild Leader Black Flame, but I need to take care of my brothers. We went to great lengths to trap these people in a barrier. If we let them go now, my brothers will have nothing to eat!” Looking at Awakened Abyss, Quasi Eagle smiled faintly and said, “Since you are unwilling to take action, we will do it instead. If you can’t bear to watch, you can shut your eyes and stand aside. I promise we won’t let your friends suffer and will finish the battle quickly!”

“I support you, Boss! Commander Abyss, even if you’re the leader, you have to ask our weapons first whether we agree with your commands!”

“That’s right! Commander Abyss, if you can’t bear to attack your friend, just stand aside!”

The other mercenaries promptly voiced their agreement with Quasi Eagle. Players like them relied on bounties to make a living. Now that they had found themselves a big catch, there was no way they would let their prey get away.

When Awakened Abyss heard these mercenaries’ words, he had an urge to puke blood.

“You…”

When did I become friends with Black Flame?

Despite his anger at the mercenaries’ comments, Awakened Abyss was actually delighted about this situation. In fact, he wished these mercenaries would blow up this situation even further. At that time, even if the higher-ups of his Guild wanted to pin the blame on him, they couldn’t.

Although Awakened Abyss was slightly displeased that he wouldn’t get revenge with his own hands, watching Shi Feng get killed wasn’t a bad option, either.

Jade Leaf, on the other hand, frowned at this sight. She never thought that these mercenaries would be so crazy. These mercenaries were treating a monster like Shi Feng as an average Tier 4 expert under the command of the native superpowers. Instead of conducting detailed research on the man, the only thing they had in their minds was money.

“Jade, you saw it yourself. I tried to let him go, but these people aren’t willing to do so. There’s nothing I can do about this.” Pretending to be angry, Awakened Abyss said, “These mercenaries simply aren’t treating me like their leader at all. That’s why I’ve been saying that I’m not suited to leading these mercenaries. After this mission, you must talk to Elder Windshadow for me.”

“Forget it! We’re leaving!” Jade Leaf couldn’t be bothered with these mercenaries.

The instructions of the Guild’s higher-ups were simple: they were to avoid making an enemy out of Zero Wing, no matter what, for the moment. However, since they had no control over these mercenaries, the higher-ups naturally couldn’t blame them for negligence if the mercenaries acted on their own.

Jade Leaf promptly drew Hundred Ghosts’s members aside, refusing to participate in this affair.

“Good!” Seeing Jade Leaf moving away, Quasi Eagle smiled and said, “Brothers, time to work! Make sure not to show too ugly of a scene to our dear Commander Abyss!”

The other mercenaries present laughed, all them gazing at Shi Feng’s group with ill intentions.

“Friends, don’t blame us for this! We’re only doing this to make a living. For our sake, I’ll have to trouble you to suffer a little bit!” Quasi Eagle said as he looked at Shi Feng’s group of seven, his eyes radiating killing intent.

“Trouble?” Shi Feng chuckled. “It seems you people have made a mistake.”

“Mistake?” Quasi Eagle eyed Shi Feng strangely. “What mistake?”

“You’ve mistaken the roles of the hunter and the hunted in this situation!”

After saying so, Shi Feng extended his Mana Domain, instantly enveloping a 2,000-yard radius in his Mana and shattering the magic barrier trapping the seven.
