Chapter 3886 - 960 - Tower's Second Floor

Boom!

When the two dragons clashed, the impact created an explosion that echoed across the entire Skeleton Hill map and reduced 99% of the buildings in the primordial civilization city to dust. It also damaged the spectating members of the Seven Luminaries Alliance and Ninth Street, causing them to lose over half their HPs and their minds to grow weary.

“Did he lose?”

When everyone regained their bearings and looked at the bottomless pit in the middle of the battlefield, they couldn’t help feeling dejected.

As the dust settled, the silhouette of a person appeared hovering quietly above the bottomless pit. The figure in question was 20 meters tall, so apart from Adegas, it could not be anybody else. And since only Adegas remained on the battlefield, Shi Feng had evidently failed to survive the First-Generation Hero’s final attack…

“Sure enough, he still lost,” Snow Wolf muttered, staring at Adegas’s figure grimly.

Shi Feng’s defeat did not surprise Snow Wolf. On the contrary, he had expected it. However, the strength Adegas displayed had exceeded his expectations.

Despite being at Level 235 and equipped with four Divine Artifacts and the rest of his equipment comprising Fragmented Divine Artifacts, Snow Wolf determined that he was still much inferior to Adegas in Strength. To make matters worse, the Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill Adegas had used in his final attack reached the Overlimit standard. Unless Adegas suddenly decided to lower the difficulty of his trial, Snow Wolf did not think he could survive Adegas’s final attack, even if he were to counter it with a Pseudo-Tier 7 Overlimit Skill.

However, just as everyone was despairing over Adegas’s trial, they received a system notification.

System: Congratulations! Your team has captured the archaic city. Rewarding one level and 30 Free Legacy Skill Points. You will be teleported out of the city in five seconds.

“We succeeded?”

“Didn’t Guild Leader Black Flame die?”

The system notification surprised and confused everyone. Nobody could understand what had just happened. However, amidst everyone’s confusion, someone suddenly pointed at the smoke-filled air above the bottomless pit.

“Look over there!”

At this player’s prompt, everyone followed this player’s finger and looked above the battlefield. Immediately, they spotted the silhouette of a second figure in the smoke-filled air. This second figure was much shorter—only one-tenth of Adegas’s height.

Not even that could kill him? Rin was dumbfounded as she stared at the second figure amidst the dispersing smoke.

This second figure was none other than Shi Feng. Not only did Shi Feng look fine, but his HP had recovered to full, as if he had never clashed with Adegas.

How is this possible?! Snow Wolf was equally shocked when he saw that Shi Feng was unscathed and looked even more spirited than before. Even if I were to defend against that final attack with a Pseudo-Tier 7 Overlimit Skill, I still wouldn’t be able to survive it. How did he not die?

Unfortunately, Snow Wolf did not get to voice his questions to Shi Feng. Before anyone could react, Adegas swiped his hand in the air and teleported everyone except Shi Feng out of the primordial civilization city.

“Well done, young man. I never expected you to block my last attack,” Adegas said approvingly to Shi Feng after teleporting the others away. “As a reward for your achievement, I will grant you the true Absolute Thunder. I hope you can take that final step.”

After saying so, Adegas transformed into a series of divine runes that submerged into Shi Feng’s mind.

System: Congratulations! You have received the complete version of First-Generation Hero Adegas’s Absolute Thunder Skill and its corresponding Legacy memories. Your Absolute Thunder Skill’s Completion Rate has increased by 5% permanently.

System: Congratulations! You have defeated the First-Generation Hero Adegas. Rewarding two levels and 100 Free Legacy Skill Points.

Following the system notifications, a purple-gold glow enveloped Shi Feng as his rewards for capturing the primordial civilization city and defeating Adegas took effect. His level rose to 231, putting him on par with the Greater God’s Domain’s apex experts.[1]

“How close. I nearly missed the rewards,” Shi Feng sighed in relief as he looked at the system notifications.

[Absolute Thunder (Complete Version)]

Requires: Sword

Pseudo-Tier 7 Skill

Allows the user to execute three slashes. Each slash quadruples the user’s Strength and speed.

Cooldown: 20 seconds

Shi Feng survived Adegas’s last attack with just a sliver of HP. However, because of The End’s side effects, he lost a level and severely damaged his soul. He had also been continuously executing the Threefold Mana Body Technique to practice Absolute Thunder before his challenge, which had drained his Concentration. As a result, his soul became overly drained, causing him to suffer a true death shortly after he blocked Adegas’s attack.

Fortunately, the Sacred Phantom Ring’s Phantom Substitute could help him take on a true death. Otherwise, he’d have had to rely on Hidden Soul and the others to resurrect him with Soul Essence[2]. He’d also have missed out on Adegas’s reward.

The complete version of Absolute Thunder was much stronger than the one he was initially given. Besides providing a stronger buff to Strength and speed, its Cooldown was also ten seconds shorter. He could use it as a general Skill when grinding for levels and raiding Bosses.

Although the city’s Guardian Boss turned out much stronger than I expected, this complete version of Absolute Thunder makes all the extra trouble worthwhile. After glancing at Absolute Thunder’s updated description, Shi Feng flew to the sunken tower in the middle of the city.

The sunken tower before him was why this primordial civilization city had garnered great fame in his previous life. It was also where the Inferior Legendary Siege Weapon Firmament was stored.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The reason royal powers were considered as such in God’s Domain wasn’t simply that they had significantly more Level 240-plus experts and Divine Artifacts than apex powers. It was largely because of their advantage in Siege Weapons.

As mighty as the Seven Luminaries Alliance was, it never got its hands on an Epic Siege Weapon, much less an Inferior Legendary Siege Weapon.

Furthermore, Firmament was the sole Inferior Legendary Siege Weapon in the Eternal Realm. Any non-royal power that got its hands on Firmament would instantly gain the strength to trade blows with royal powers.

…

Inside the sunken tower…

After Shi Feng entered the sunken tower and walked down a dark corridor for about three minutes, he arrived in a town-sized space. The space was filled with stone pillars that were hundreds of meters tall and covered in divine runes. Hovering in the middle of this stone forest was a giant mechanical sword composed of countless sky-blue metallic structures. This mechanical sword was none other than the Inferior Legendary Siege Weapon Firmament.

Just as Shi Feng was about to collect Firmament, the ground beneath the Siege Weapon shook as countless stone slabs engraved with divine patterns shifted. A few seconds later, a staircase leading down presented itself to Shi Feng.

“A second floor?”

TL Notes:

[1]Level 231:

The raws wrote Level 232, but Shi Feng was only Level 229 when he reached the tower. He also lost a level when he used The End, so it would be 229 – 1 + 2 + 1 = 231.

[2]Soul Essence:

The raws wrote Divine Water of Life, but in Chapter 590, it was stated that although the Divine Water of Life could be used to resurrect NPCs, it was useless on players.

On the other hand, Soul Essence’s sole purpose was to resurrect players.
