Chapter 2388 – Evolution Effects

Suspended in mid-air, the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment radiated a golden light as it hungrily devoured the purple-blue smoke.

As the Literature Fragment absorbed more of the smoke, the engraved divine runes sharpened. The surrounding Mana began to flow toward the Literature Fragment, as well.

After 10 seconds of this, the divine runes on the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment had completed, fully repaired, and it radiated far stronger Divine Might than before.

What a powerful aura! Shi Feng began to grow excited as he sensed the Literature Fragment’s Divine Might.

The strength of the Divine Might meant the Literature Fragment had been upgraded, and the process was a success. Eagerly, Shi Feng clicked to inspect the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment.

Why is it still Epic rank? Shi Feng was confused when he saw the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment’s statistics.

In terms of abilities, the upgraded Ancient God’s Literature Fragment was stronger than some of the Fragmented Legendary items Shi Feng had seen. In fact, if the various superpowers found out about the Literature Fragment’s current abilities, they’d likely offer to trade several Fragmented Legendary items for it.

Yet, despite such abilities, the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment was still an Epic item. It was unbelievable.

Sure enough, I’ll need to collect more fragments if I want to upgrade its rank, Shi Feng concluded.

The Ancient God’s Literature was a divine tome, which numerous Ancient Gods had written. It had the power to decimate the heavens and earth. Trying to upgrade a single fragment to Fragmented Legendary rank was simply unrealistic.

However, Shi Feng was satisfied with the results.

With the minor strengthening, the Literature Fragment’s Summon Heroic Spirit Skill had massively improved. The Skill was enough to make him a one-man army. Furthermore, Soul Absorption and Soul Strengthing’s Cooldowns had shortened significantly. Every one of the changes had exceeded Shi Feng’s expectations.

Most importantly, his Ancient God’s Literature Fragment now had the ability to locate other fragments within range. This effect would make it much easier to compile the fragments. If he could complete the tome, the Ancient God’s Literature would benefit the Guild far more than four or five more Fragmented Legendary items.

Following which, Shi Feng stored the Holy Grail and turned to face the Secret-Silver Guards behind him.

These Secret-Silver Guards weren’t like monsters like Anna and Kite. Each only needed three drops of Soul Essence for their first Soul Strengthening. Fortunately, Shi Feng had collected over 100 drops, so he could strengthen all 16 Secret- Silver Guards at least once. With 16 Fine-Gold Guards and Anna and Kite’s strength, he could move through the Demonwolf Mountain Range unhindered.

Shi Feng wasted no time as he began to chant the Soul Strengthening’s incantation and target the Elementalist before him.

A fivefold magic array, one far stronger than the one that had appeared when Shi Feng had strengthened Kite’s soul, immediately appeared under the Elementalist’s feet. The array even absorbed Mana from its surroundings and the void at least three times faster than it had with Kite.

Very quickly, a fist-sized ball of Liquid Mana appeared before the Elementalist. This ball of Mana melted into the Elementalist’s forehead, and the Secret-Silver Guard released a bone-piercing howl.

Although the Elementalist was in pain, Shi Feng could clearly sense the Guard’s aura rapidly growing stronger.

This excruciating process continued for five seconds. By the time the ball of Liquid Mana and the Elementalist had merged completely, the Elementalist felt like a completely different person.

To Shi Feng, the Level 103, Tier 3 Great Mage had only felt slightly threatening, but now, even he’d have to tread carefully in a fight with this NPC.

This NPC improved so drastically?! Shi Feng could not believe his eyes when he saw the Great Mage’s statistics.

Previously, the Great Mage had only had 78 Growth Potential, which was considerably high for a Secret-Silver Guard. Secret-Silver Guard’s Growth Potential only ranged between 71 and 80, and this Great Mage had only been three points away from Fine-Gold rank.

When Shi Feng used Soul Strengthening on Kite, the NPC’s Growth Potential had only risen by two points. While Shi Feng had expected a greater increase for a Secret-Silver Guard, he had only expected a three- or four-point increase at best.

However, the Great Mage’s Growth Potential had risen by five points, to 83. The Great Mage had crossed the Fine-Gold threshold and more.

Every additional point of Growth Potential was significant to Personal Guards. At 83, a Personal Guard could perfectly suppress an apex expert of the same level and tier.

Shi Feng couldn’t help his growing excitement.

With the Ancient God’s Literature Fragment’s new strength, he could even elevate Secret-Silver Guards with 76 Growth Potential to Fine-Gold rank. Now, Zero Wing could amass a small army of Fine-Gold Guards.

Shi Feng immediately contacted Melancholic Smile and had her send him the Guild’s Secret-Silver Guards with at least 76 Growth Potential to the Basic Meditation Room on the top floor.

“Guild Leader, those guards are currently protecting Silverwing Town. I’m afraid that I’ll need some time to find temporary replacements and recall them all to White River City,” Melancholic Smile said.

Of the Secret-Silver Guards she had found, she had ordered those that met Shi Feng’s requirements to stand guard in White River City. She had sent the rest to defend Silverwing Town in the meantime. Secret-Silver Guards had incredible combat power, and once they reached Level 100, they could complete their promotion to Tier 3. They were an excellent deterrent in the chaotic Ore Empire.

“Don’t worry about it. Just recall them all here,” Shi Feng said. He did not mind waiting. The upgraded Soul Strengthening still had a 3-hour Cooldown, and it would take a full, natural day to strengthen the 16 Secret-Silver Guards before him.

“Alright, I’ll start making the necessary arrangements,” Melancholic Smile said, not giving the matter much thought. She then contacted the core members that owned the Secret-Silver Guards in question.
