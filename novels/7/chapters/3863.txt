Chapter 3864 - 938 - Sixth-Floor Grading

“He died?”

“Impossible!”

Everyone watching the fight was stunned when they saw Garuda’s death. Extreme Feather, Garuda’s confidant, was especially dumbfounded, her aloof expression replaced by one of disbelief.

Ink Crystal and Garuda were evenly matched just a second ago. Yet, Garuda was one-shotted a second later. This situation seemed like a joke no matter how Extreme Feather looked at it.

“How can there be such a huge difference between sixth-floor experts?” Fervent Samsara couldn’t accept what he just witnessed.

Even during the last Continental Championship, Garuda was already regarded as the Holy Race’s number one chosen one, his combat standard having reached the Half-step Mortal God standard. Now that he had reached the sixth-floor standard and fully equipped himself with Divine Artifacts, he should at least rank among the ten strongest experts of the three races, if not the strongest.

Yet, as soon as Ink Crystal went on the offensive, Garuda was one-shotted…

This development shattered Fervent Samsara’s understanding of the sixth-floor standard.

“What do you think of the gap between the Refinement Realm and the Void Realm? Is it big?” Shi Feng did not offer Fervent Samsara an answer but posed a question instead.

“It’s huge!” Fervent Samsara answered without hesitation.

The Refinement Realm was merely a starting point for players in the Greater God’s Domain. To put it bluntly, players who had reached the Refinement Realm had only learned the basics of controlling their bodies: how to make subtle adjustments to their bodies so that they could execute movements more accurately.

However, the Void Realm was a completely different story. Players who had reached the Void Realm could constantly perceive everything in their immediate vicinity. A Refinement Realm expert would have no secrets in front of a Void Realm expert; no matter how perfectly a Refinement Realm expert executed their movements, a Void Realm expert would know everything they were doing. Void Realm experts could also locate and target the weak points and blind spots of Refinement Realm experts in advance. There was simply no comparison between the two groups of players.

“The same goes for the sixth-floor standard,” Shi Feng said, some foggy memories gradually regaining clarity as he gazed at Ink Crystal. Then, he instinctively continued, “The Mortal God standard primarily focuses on using and controlling the mind. Or, more specifically, the soul. In Garuda’s case, he has only achieved the ‘Refinement Realm’ standard in this regard. He stood no chance against Ink Crystal.”

“Guild Leader, do you mean that…Ink Crystal has already reached the Void Realm standard in controlling her mind?” Fervent Samsara asked as he stared at Ink Crystal’s distant figure in disbelief.

They were all players of God’s Domain. Yet, Fervent Samsara could only ever dream of reaching the sixth-floor standard, while Ink Crystal, a girl who was 17 years old at most, had already made considerable progress in the sixth-floor standard. At this point, he couldn’t help but ask—were they even playing the same game?

“I don’t know.” Shi Feng spread his hands and smiled wryly. “I only say that it’s possible. After all, I haven’t reached that standard, either.”

In his previous life, the human race had given birth to many sixth-floor experts. Although he didn’t specifically know how these experts had reached the sixth-floor standard, he did know about the categorization method of sixth-floor experts. The categorization method divided the sixth-floor standard, called the Realms of Essence, into Refinement, Flowing Water, and Void.

The Three Absolutes in his previous life had all reached the Realms of Essence’s Void Realm. It was why the Holy Race’s various powers had always been reluctant to provoke them. After all, experts of this realm were already capable of simultaneously fighting several or even a dozen novice sixth-floor experts. At the time, only the Holy Race’s royal powers commanded over a dozen sixth-floor experts, while apex powers would be fortunate to have more than a handful.

“…”

Everyone from Zero Wing looked at Shi Feng in exasperation.

Ink Crystal’s victory meant they had to kill her if they wanted to leave with any tokens. Yet, they didn’t even know how strong she was.

It might be fine if Ink Crystal was only at the peak of the Refinement Realm. After all, they had two sixth-floor experts on their team. However, it’d be a different story if she had reached the Flowing Water Realm. Even with the same equipment standard, a Flowing Water Realm expert could easily defeat two Refinement Realm experts. And if she was at the Void Realm standard, they’d be better off going on their merry way.

“Guild Leader, a message just came in from Miss Jade. She says her group will reach us in five minutes max,” Hidden Soul reported in a hurry when she saw that Ink Crystal’s team was already getting ready to leave. “Should we take action now to delay them?”

Now that Ink Crystal’s team had concluded its fight with Garuda’s team, it naturally wouldn’t stay in Plot 079 for much longer. In that case, Ink Crystal’s team was bound to take flight. Although they could secretly tail Ink Crystal’s team, the team could easily detect them once they were in the air, even if they remained invisible.

Of course, they also had the option of waiting until Ink Crystal’s team entered another plot of land before chasing after it. However, they’d risk losing the team amidst the sea of buildings.

If they wanted to snatch Ink Crystal’s tokens, their only option was to delay her team until Dragon’s Crown’s group arrived, which obviously wasn’t a wise move.

Ink Crystal could one-shot even an expert as strong as Garuda. Even if Shi Feng had the strength to fight sixth-floor experts, he wouldn’t be much stronger than Garuda. Not to mention, Garuda was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts this time; his Basic Attributes were definitely superior to Shi Feng’s.

As Shi Feng hesitated over whether to take action, Ink Crystal suddenly turned around and looked toward Zero Wing’s team.

“Come out! You’ve been spying long enough! Do you think I haven’t noticed you?” Ink Crystal shouted, her voice echoing across thousands of yards.

“We’ve been discovered?!” Hidden Soul stared in shock at Ink Crystal, who stood over 5,000 yards away.

Although fifth-floor experts could foresee the future, they could only see briefly into the future. Moreover, they could only foresee events in their immediate vicinity, normally about two or three hundred yards. A distance of 5,000 yards already challenged the limit of a sixth-floor expert’s sight, let alone foresight. A sixth-floor expert should, at most, be able to foresee events one or two thousand yards away. Hidden Soul found it hard to believe the foresight of sixth-floor experts could extend up to 5,000 yards and beyond, especially when they were all Tier 6 players. Not to mention, Zero Wing’s members were all invisible right now.

However, before Shi Feng and the others could fully process Ink Crystal’s words, a team of 500-plus players suddenly rushed out of a building near Ink Crystal and surrounded her team.

Why is she here? Shi Feng was stunned as he looked at the woman in black armor leading the team of 500-plus players. This was because she was none other than Lunar River, King’s Paradise’s First Vice Guild Leader.
