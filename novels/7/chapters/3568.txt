Chapter 643 – Activating the Medium World Fragment

“You really shouldn’t have reacted so impulsively, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Ink Qilin said worriedly to Shi Feng after seeing Nineteenth Sword leave. “The Skylight Association is very powerful in the Eternal Realm; even the various pseudo-apex powers are wary of it. Not to mention, Elder Sword is known for his arrogance. Now that Zero Wing has rejected his buyout offer, he is bound to target Zero Wing at the World Ark.”

Nineteenth Sword had rejected all of the invitations he had received from the various apex powers thus far, so it was a huge deal for him to join a non-apex power like the Skylight Association. Yet, when he came in person to make Zero Wing a buyout offer on the Skylight Association’s behalf, he had faced such an outright rejection. With his prideful personality, there was no way he would let this slight go.

Not to mention, the World Ark was a high-level World Mode Regional Dungeon that was bound to be the focus of the various players and powers in the future. At that time, there wouldn’t be just one city’s worth of players and powers competing over the map, but many cities instead. There were also the Holy Race’s various players and powers.

Although Zero Wing currently already had over 100,000 members and over 200 fifth-floor experts, such numbers were nothing in the competition over the World Ark. If Zero Wing wanted to thrive in the Regional Dungeon, the wisest choice would be to partner with the Skylight Association.

“Don’t worry, Vice Commander Qilin,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “The current Zero Wing is no longer the same as before. The Skylight Association is not worthy of Zero Wing’s fear.”

The Skylight Association indeed grew to an extraordinary extent during his previous life. But the current Zero Wing similarly shouldn’t be underestimated, either. Not to mention, even with the limited resources he had during his previous life, he still managed to fight Demon’s Gate, an apex power, to a standstill. So, why should he be afraid of a non-apex power like the Skylight Association?

“If you feel that the Mana Purification Technique is sufficient as a trump card, I advise you to reconsider, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Ink Qilin said, wryly smiling when she heard Shi Feng’s nonchalant response. “I don’t know how, but the Skylight Association has also managed to secure many copies of the Mana Purification Technique for its elites. This is also how the Skylight Association has thrived at the World Ark.”

“Skylight has also acquired many copies?” Shi Feng was a little surprised to hear this. He found it hard to believe that an up-and-coming power like the Skylight Association could get its hands on many copies of the Mana Purification Technique.

In the current Eternal Realm, only the various apex powers should be able to get their hands on a considerable amount. As for Zero Wing, it had only gotten lucky and secured a large number from the Nameless City.

“In short, be careful of Skylight, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Ink Qilin said cautiously. “There is no way Skylight is an ordinary existence. Despite the various apex powers offering various resources to recruit him, Elder Sword still turned down all of their offers. Yet, Skylight has somehow managed to convince him to join.

“Moreover, it isn’t just Elder Sword. According to Scarecrow Fox’s intelligence, many of the Greater God’s Domain’s top adventurer teams and famous individuals have also joined Skylight. Skylight’s forces have also killed several of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers’ legions at the World Ark already, and these were legions led by Vice Guild Leader-individuals we are talking about. Nobody knows exactly how powerful the Skylight Association is right now.”

“Thank you for your reminder, Vice Commander Qilin,” Shi Feng said gratefully. “I will take note of this.”

“Okay. I still have to take care of the Great Commander’s mission, so I’ll be taking my leave as well,” Ink Qilin said, nodding before leaving Zero Wing’s Residence with River Light.

Meanwhile, a moment after Ink Qilin and River Light left, Gentle Snow stepped into the lounge.

“Should we head to the World Ark with Azure Shadow’s group in four days, Guild Leader?” Gentle Snow suggested.

The Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers were second to only the various apex powers. Meanwhile, their legions led by Vice Guild Leader-level individuals were so strong they could survive against even Divine Glory experts. Yet, the Skylight Association had managed to kill multiple such legions.

“No need. Let them focus on preparing for their test,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “If we want to stand out in the Eternal Realm, it is best if we rely on ourselves. How’s the secret room’s renovation coming along?”

“The barrier has been set up as you requested. Not even Tier 6 experts should think of breaking it in a short time,” Gentle Snow answered with a look of curiosity. She couldn’t understand why Shi Feng would ask to erect such a powerful barrier for a single room. The barrier was already strong enough to protect the average city.

“It’s done already?” Shi Feng smiled when he heard Gentle Snow’s answer. “In that case, have Soul’s group gather there in an hour. The same goes for you.”

“Why are we gathering there? I don’t think it will be necessary if we’re gathering for a sparring session.” Gentle Snow asked in confusion. “After learning the Advanced Bronze Purification Technique, everyone is busy trying to master World Laws. Many of them are also very close to mastering a Law already.”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but chuckle when he heard Gentle Snow’s concerns. Then, he said, “Naturally, it is to help you all master more Laws. Of course, I won’t object if you all decide you don’t want this opportunity. I can always enjoy it by myself.”

“Master more Laws?” Gentle Snow was momentarily stunned. “Really?”

World Laws played a vital role in determining a Divine Body’s Completion Rate and strength. The more World Laws a player mastered, the higher their Divine Body’s Completion Rate and strength would be.

In reality, many of Zero Wing’s executive members could already get promoted to Tier 6. But they all had great ambitions, so they wished to make more progress in World Laws before creating their Divine Body and getting promoted to Tier 6.

But mastering World Laws was not an easy task. Apart from gaining assistance from various Legacies, they could only rely on themselves to comprehend and experiment.

“Of course. When have I ever lied to you?” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Hurry up and notify the others.”

“Okay! I’ll go and inform them right away!” Gentle Snow said hurriedly. “Also, you’re not allowed to monopolize this opportunity, Guild Leader!”

While Gentle Snow left to contact Hidden Soul and Zero Wing’s other executives, Shi Feng made his way to the secret room protected by a Large Grandmaster Magic Barrier.

The secret room was the size of a football field, and it was more than enough to accommodate the activities of over a hundred players.

After arriving in the secret room, Shi Feng took out the Medium World Fragment from his bag. Then, he injected a God Crystal into the fist-sized void fragment.
