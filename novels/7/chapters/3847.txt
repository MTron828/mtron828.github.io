Chapter 3848 - 922 - Apex of the Three Races

Eternal Realm, Everlasting City:

Everlasting City was like a giant tree that connected heaven and earth. This “tree” had 144 branches, each representing a separate zone the size of an ordinary NPC City. The sight of the city amazed the gathered players.

However, what was even more astounding was how many powers had gathered outside the city. Over a thousand pseudo-apex powers were present, each with at least 1,000 fifth-floor experts, and some even commanding over 2,000 fifth-floor experts.

Nevertheless, despite a combined total of over 1.5 million fifth-floor experts under their command, these pseudo-apex powers would only be competing for a few dozen zones. This was because the majority of Everlasting City’s 144 zones had already been reserved by the six royal powers and thirty-five apex powers present.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Commander! This is madness! How can there be so many fifth-floor experts here?! With the current situation, the Eternal Chamber of Commerce will have trouble occupying even four plots of land!” Drifting Bean, a Level 233 Swordsman, said in exasperation as she looked at the various powers’ teams gathered outside Everlasting City.

“It will indeed be difficult. We can ensure the safety of only the lands we occupy at the beginning,” Endless Scars, a Level 241 Elementalist wielding a celestial staff and wearing a veil, said in agreement. “The number of participating experts is more than double what Eternal’s executives anticipated. The two other races are much stronger than the human race. I guess it will come down to who can survive the longest.”

When Endless Scars received the order to help the Eternal Chamber of Commerce with Everlasting City’s competition, she initially thought it would be a simple task. She even looked forward to the competition.

However, after arriving outside Everlasting City and seeing the teams of the alien races, she couldn’t help but be shocked. Whether it was the Holy Race or the Crystallian race, both vastly outnumbered the human race in fifth-floor experts; all of their apex powers had at least 5,000.

Although the Eternal Chamber of Commerce also commanded over 5,000 fifth-floor experts, many had been recruited from adventurer teams. Even so, the Eternal Chamber of Commerce still couldn’t compare to the apex powers of the two alien races, especially the Holy Race’s.

Every fifth-floor expert under the Holy Race’s apex powers was equipped with two or three Fragmented Divine Artifacts. In contrast, the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s fifth-floor experts were a mixed bag. While the stronger ones might have two or three Fragmented Divine Artifacts, most were fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment.

Although Everlasting City’s level restriction would limit the Fragmented Divine Artifacts’ advantage over Legendary Weapons and Equipment, these differences would be considered minor only in individual fights. These small individual differences would be compounded in a battle between legions, and the legion with the better equipment would have a much greater chance of victory.

Fortunately, Everlasting City’s competition wasn’t a duel between teams but a free-for-all. This meant that survival was the top priority for all participants, as only survivors could compete for a winning spot. The competition also had a 12-hour time limit, so the more forces a power could preserve, the greater its advantage.

“Commander, look at the Holy Race’s side. Who is that young man? Many of the Holy Race’s experts seem in awe of him,” Drifting Bean said, pointing at a Level 226 young man among the Holy Race’s experts. As the young man walked among the Holy Race’s players, those in his way would take the initiative to make way for him. Some of these players included Level 240-plus experts.

“That person should be Divine Fist Garuda, the Holy Race’s number one chosen one,” Endless Scars said as she looked at the young man in question vigilantly. “I hadn’t thought the Thunder Empire would send him here. It seems the Thunder Empire is taking the competition seriously.”

“The Holy Race’s number one chosen one?” When Drifting Bean heard Endless Scars’s introduction, her eyes shone with fighting intent as she looked at the young man.

“Don’t even think about it,” Endless Scars said, chuckling at Drifting Bean’s reaction. “Garuda is rumored to have reached the Half-step Mortal God standard already. Even among the older-generation experts, few can trade blows with him. Considering the significance of this competition, the Thunder Empire must have equipped him with Divine Artifacts and various trump cards. Only Demon’s Gate’s Star Maiden Elise and the Crystallian race’s Earthen Princess Rin can match him.”

After saying so, Endless Scars turned to where the Crystallian race’s experts had gathered, only to find many of the Crystallian experts suddenly directing their attention to a girl who had just appeared among them. They looked at the girl as if she were their monarch, their eyes full of reverence. Even the experts of the Crystallian royal powers maintained a respectful expression as they looked at her.

“Who is she?” A sudden chill ran down Endless Scars’s spine as she stared at the Crystallian girl. “A Mortal God?!”

Besides the Crystallian experts, Garuda and Elise also turned to look at the Crystallian girl.

Ink Crystal!

I finally get to fight you again!

Garuda and Elise looked at the Crystallian girl as if she were their greatest opponent, their bodies trembling with excitement.

Those who hadn’t participated in the most recent Continental Championship wouldn’t know about the Crystallian girl named Ink Crystal. All the powers in the know had decided to keep a tight lid on her existence. After all, the news of someone achieving the Mortal God standard was so incredible that it might rewrite the history of the three races.

“A Mortal God? What are you talking about, Commander?” Drifting Bean asked the dazed Endless Scars in confusion.

“It’s nothing. Maybe it’s just my imagination,” Endless Scars said, shaking her head. “No matter how heaven-defying a sixteen-year-old is, there is no way she can reach that realm at this age.”

“Commander, look over there! The emblem of that Flying Ship looks like Zero Wing’s!” Drifting Bean exclaimed as she pointed at a gigantic Flying Ship approaching Everlasting City. “Could the Swordsman standing on the deck be Guild Leader Black Flame?”

“Why are they here?” When Endless Scars saw the six-winged emblem on the Silverwing Flying Ship, a hint of shock and confusion appeared under her veil.

Compared to the surprise Endless Scars felt when she learned that Shi Feng was acquainted with the Red Dragon Nation’s Vice Guild Leader Frey, the surprise she currently felt was on a completely different scale.

This was Everlasting City’s competition they were talking about!

The upcoming competition would involve an all-out battle among the three races. Many of the human race’s pseudo-apex powers, such as the Red Dragon Nation, couldn’t even participate in the competition. It wasn’t that they were prohibited from joining, but that they lacked the strength to join in on the action. For them, joining would be suicide.

Thus, Endless Scars found it bewildering that an upstart Guild would dare to embroil itself in such a battle.

When the Silverwing Flying Ship landed and Shi Feng descended from it, Divine Fist Garuda, Star Maiden Elise, and even the Earthen Princess Rin suddenly turned to look at him through the crowd, their behavior surprising the many players present.

“Who is he?”
