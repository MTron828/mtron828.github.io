Chapter 350 – World Passage’s Opening

The system announcement echoed across the dozen or so kingdoms and empires situated near the Sea of Giants, the news brought by the announcement sending the players in these countries into a frenzy. Even the Ancient River Kingdom’s players, who were feeling overwhelmed because of the Ancient River Secret Land’s collapse, showed abnormal levels of excitement in response to this announcement.

…

In a dark alleyway of Gazing Moon City’s main street, six players wearing cloaks and masks to hide their information and appearances were staring intently at the nearby Gazing Moon Hotel. They behaved as if the Gazing Moon Hotel was the only building that existed in this world. They were so focused on the hotel that even the swaying of the hotel’s potted plants was within their perception.

However, shortly after the system announcement appeared, a stalwart man dressed in a gray robe suddenly appeared before the six. When these six cloaked individuals saw the gray-robed man, a flash of awe and admiration appeared in their eyes.

!!

“You’re here, Boss Firefly,” a snake-like young man with long hair, the leader of the six, greeted the gray-robed man. Then, with an excited look, he asked, “Since you’ve shown up, does that mean there is a change in our plans? Are we heading straight to the Sea of Giants?”

The name Firefly was known by almost everyone in the Ancient River Kingdom.

Although Firefly was only a Tier 5 Sword Saint, he was a Dark Player who even the kingdom’s six ruling hegemonic powers had a headache dealing with. There was also nobody who could escape from Firefly’s hands once he set them as his target.

In the past, the Ancient River Kingdom’s six ruling hegemonic powers had tried to eliminate Firefly once and for all. For the sake of accomplishing this goal, each of the six ruling hegemonic powers had dispatched one legion consisting of 1,000 Tier 5 players led by one Tier 6 player. However, the result of the operation dumbfounded everyone.

Not only did Firefly escape the six legions’ pursuit with his life, but he had even caused the six legions to lose one-tenth of their members. Although none of the Tier 6 legion commanders were killed, they were powerless to do anything to prevent Firefly from escaping.

Even now, the Ancient River Kingdom’s six ruling hegemonic powers were still hunting for Firefly. Yet, despite this, Firefly was still thriving in the Ancient River Kingdom, entering and leaving the various NPC Cities whenever he wanted.

“No,” the stalwart man named Firefly calmly said. “The World Passage’s opening might be tempting, but Black Flame’s importance isn’t any lower. The Ancient River Secret Land’s disappearance must have something to do with the ten people who had entered the Ancient River’s Heart, particularly Black Flame. He has managed to win against Empress Blood Arrow and the Undefeated Battle Maniac, so he must have some big secret on him. Now that a World Passage connected to him is opening, he is bound to make a move, so do not let your guard down during this period.”

“Understood!” the snake-like youth nodded. “So long as he dares to leave the main street, we’ll make sure to capture him before anyone else!”

Firefly did not say anything more. Then, he disappeared just as abruptly as he appeared.

Gazing Moon Hotel, VIP room:

“How could this be?” Wu Xiaoxiao grew incredibly nervous when she saw the system announcement.

Once a world’s World Barrier broke, players in that world would no longer be protected, and players from other worlds could freely enter it. Along with this announcement, their God’s Domain’s struggle over the Miniature Ancient World with other worlds had officially begun.

It was just that she didn’t expect the Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage would open so much sooner than she expected. It had even opened ahead of their God’s Domain’s World Passage. This was undoubtedly a disaster for their God’s Domain’s players in the Miniature Ancient World.

However, when Shi Feng saw the anxiety on Wu Xiaoxiao’s face, he smiled and said, “This isn’t bad news, you know? On the contrary, it is good news for you and Midsummer.”

“Good news?” Wu Xiaoxiao grew confused. She couldn’t understand how she could benefit from this situation in any way.

Once the Miniature Ancient World became fully open to the Greater God’s Domain, most, if not all, of the Miniature Ancient World’s resources would be snatched up by the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers. One could easily imagine how this would impact the development of the Miniature Ancient World’s native powers. Meanwhile, as a genius nurtured by the Green God Corporation, it went without saying she would be negatively affected by this situation as well.

Shi Feng did not hurry to provide Wu Xiaoxiao with an explanation. Instead, he smiled and asked, “Do you know why, even though the Miniature Ancient World only allows players to enter it if they restart their progress, the various foreign powers still sent their geniuses into the Miniature Ancient World in droves?”

“Isn’t it to train those geniuses?” Wu Xiaoxiao answered almost instinctively.

“Training is only one part of the reason,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “The various powers’ true aim is the moment the World Passage opens. Specifically, they are aiming to compete for the World Passage’s opening rewards!”

“There are rewards for the World Passage’s opening?” Wu Xiaoxiao was surprised. This was the first time she had heard about such a thing.

“Naturally. Any World Passage’s opening will cause chaos and fluctuations in space and time, allowing dangerous creatures in the void to surge into the worlds connected to the World Passage. Meanwhile, players who kill these dangerous creatures will gain Contribution Points from the Greater God’s Domain’s Adventurer’s Association, and these points can be spent to exchange for items in the Association’s treasury,” Shi Feng explained. “The Adventurer’s Association’s treasury is incredible. Not only does it have Legendary Weapons and Equipment, but it even has Legendary Equipment Sets. However, these items still aren’t the most important.”

“These still aren’t the most important items?” Wu Xiaoxiao was stunned.

These were Legendary Equipment Sets they were talking about! Yet, they weren’t considered the most important?

If a Tier 6 player were to equip such a set, they could basically roam the Starlight Realm unhindered. After all, only a few players in the Starlight Realm owned a Legendary Equipment Set, and they were all peerless individuals known by everyone in the Starlight Realm.

“Of course not,” Shi Feng said, rolling his eyes at Wu Xiaoxiao. “The Adventurer’s Association’s treasury is unique in the Greater God’s Domain. No other organization’s treasury can match the Adventurer’s Association’s treasury. Meanwhile, out of all the items in the Association’s treasury, the most precious ones would undoubtedly have to be the Legacy Guidance Crystals, items that can let players experience the promotion process of Gods during ancient and primordial times.

“There are also the Legacy Crystals that can let players experience the perfect use of Gold Combat Techniques. These are vastly superior to the Legacy Crystals players typically come across in the outside world, which usually only provides an incomplete experience.

“Currently, although you and Midsummer have qualified for the Galaxy Conglomerate’s official invitational competition, it is nothing but a dream for you two to win an invitation from the competition. However, if you can get your hands on the Adventurer’s Association’s Legacies, your chances of winning an invitation will increase dramatically.”

Weapons and equipment might be important, but they could be easily lost. On the other hand, promotion methods and combat techniques would stay with the player forever once learned.

These Legacies were also the only advantage the Adventurer’s Association provided to isolated worlds once their World Passage opened.

When Wu Xiaoxiao heard Shi Feng’s explanation, she immediately understood why even hegemonic powers originating from Higher God’s Domains would send their geniuses to the Miniature Ancient World. Such an opportunity was indeed hard to come by.

“But I’ve already left the Miniature Ancient World, and I don’t have any ways to go back,” Wu Xiaoxiao said somewhat helplessly.

It was a fluke that she managed to enter the Greater God’s Domain before the Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage opened. She would need a miracle to return to the Miniature Ancient World. After all, if it was so easy to travel in and out of an isolated world, the various hegemonic powers wouldn’t have bothered having their geniuses restart their accounts’ progress.

“Who says you can’t go back?”
