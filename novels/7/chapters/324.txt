Chapter 325 - Life and Death

“Are you toying with me?”

Absolute Heaven glared at Shi Feng, trying to figure out just what was going through Shi Feng’s mind. However, no matter how he examined his opponent, he still could not see through Shi Feng, who had currently disguised himself using the Demon Mask. Absolute Heaven could only see a middle-aged man with a faint smile in front of him. No matter how hard Absolute Heaven racked his mind, he just could not figure out what Shi Feng was trying to do.

After nearly taking his life, Shi Feng suggested gambling his life away. Was there a need for so much trouble? Wouldn’t it be easier just to finish him right now?

“Why would I toy with you?” Shi Feng laughed.

“Fine, I’ll make the bet. What will happen if I survive? What if I die?” For his own pride and honor, Absolute Heaven refused to die.

“If you escape safely, I’ll do one thing for you. If you die, you’ll have to do one thing for me. How about it?” At this moment, Shi Feng finally revealed his true intentions. He had done everything so far all for this single goal.

“One thing, huh?” Absolute Heaven considered it carefully. After giving it some thought, he looked at Shi Feng and said, “If I ask you to kill Ye Feng, will you do it?”

Absolute Heaven’s request caught Shi Feng off guard, but soon after, he let out a soft chuckle.

In White River City, everybody knew that Black Flame and Ye Feng were the two symbols of Zero Wing.

Never would Shi Feng have imagined that Absolute Heaven’s request would be something like this. He had to admit that Absolute Heaven was indeed ruthless. If the public learned that Black Flame had killed Ye Feng, it would greatly affect Zero Wing’s reputation. At the same time, it would also affect Black Flame and Ye Feng’s reputations.

However, be it Black Flame or Ye Feng, only a few core members of Zero Wing knew that both identities belonged to a single person, which was Shi Feng himself.

Meanwhile, Absolute Heaven requested that he kill himself. The difficulty of this request was indeed quite high...

“What? Didn’t you say that you’ll do one thing for me if I win?” Absolute Heaven smiled complacently. He then said, “My request is so small, yet, you hesitate?”

“No, I just didn’t think that you would make such a simple request. Originally, I thought you would want to kill me once. After all, I am the Guild Leader of Zero Wing, and Feng Xuanyang of Underworld possess a deep hatred of me. As long as you manage to kill me and pass on the recording to the higher-ups of Underworld, you will receive Underworld’s attention. Your position in the organization will soar as well,” Shi Feng mentioned.

If Black Flame died, the prestige that Zero Wing had managed to accumulate due to his efforts would crumble.

At this moment, Absolute Heaven suddenly came to a realization. He had actually forgotten about such a possibility.

The loss and humiliation Dark Star had suffered caused Feng Xuanyang’s hatred of Zero Wing to soar. The Guild he had nurtured with so much effort had actually fallen into such a state. Naturally, he would not let Zero Wing off the hook. Hence, Feng Xuanyang put out a bounty to all members of Underworld stating that, as long as anyone from Underworld managed to kill the higher-ups of Zero Wing and cause trouble, the rewards would be bountiful.

As long as someone could accomplish this task, they could gain fame, status, and wealth.

If one could annihilate Zero Wing, receiving a promotion from outer member to elite member of Underworld would be a simple matter.

There were not many elite members in Underworld. They were few and far between, but those who obtained the prestigious title would also become influential in reality. Every day, there were countless outer members in Underworld working as hard as they could to become official members. Only after becoming an official member could one possibly become an elite member.

If he, Absolute Heaven, could kill Black Flame, the Guild Leader of Zero Wing, there might actually have a chance at receiving the promotion to that elite group. Even if it were not possible, at the very least, he could still become an official member.

“Alright, then. I agree to the bet. Let’s start after I have fully recovered.” Absolute Heaven directly agreed.

After a few moments, Absolute Heaven’s HP and Stamina recovered completely.

Shi Feng then took out a Gold Coin, suggesting, “I’ll toss this Gold Coin into the air. The battle will start the moment the Coin reaches maximum altitude and begins to fall. How about it?”

“Okay.”

Absolute Heaven was momentarily speechless when he saw Shi Feng use a Gold Coin as a starting signal. Was he not afraid of losing the Gold Coin? Currently, Absolute Heaven only had around 20 Silver Coins in his pockets. Even so, he was considered relatively wealthy. Yet, Shi Feng had actually taken out five times that amount and treated it like a toy.

Comparisons are indeed odious!

“Let’s start, then!”

Shi Feng tossed the Gold Coin into the air. The Coin soared upward. Only when it was around four meters above ground did its speed begin to slow, the Coin faintly showing signs of stopping and succumbing to gravity. Absolute Heaven focused his gaze sternly on the Coin. The moment it started to fall, he intended to use Blind on Shi Feng immediately. He would then activate Wind Steps and start running towards the town. In such a wide open area, if he attempted to use Vanish to enter stealth mode, Shi Feng would discover him easily. However, it would be a different story in town.

Although terrain on the way to town was complex, aside from Vanish, he possessed other lifesaving skills and tools to help him get through this distance. As long as he could reach the town and use Vanish, even if Shi Feng possessed excellent senses, it would be impossible to locate him.

However, from start to end, Shi Feng had been paying attention to Absolute Heaven. He did not even take a look at the Gold Coin in mid-air.

The moment the Gold Coin started to descend, just as Absolute Heaven was about to use Blind, Shi Feng instantly vanished. Immediately, he appeared at Absolute Heaven’s back, sending a Chop towards the Assassin. The speed of this attack was astonishing, and Absolute Heaven had no way to dodge.

Absolute Heaven suddenly felt an icy feeling coming from behind him. Moreover, the Blind that Absolute Heaven had used before had lost its target, becoming ineffective. Without giving it a second thought, Absolute Heaven immediately proceeded with the next part of his plan and activated Wind Steps. When activating this skill, he would become invincible for nearly one second. Absolute Heaven took advantage of this short moment of invincibility to block Shi Feng’s attack, negating all damage. Moreover, Absolute Heaven also took advantage of the impact of Shi Feng’s attack to send himself flying almost six yards away, creating a relatively large gap between Shi Feng and himself.

Shi Feng inwardly praised his opponent as he watched Absolute Heaven’s fleeing figure. If Absolute Heaven had not chosen to use Wind Steps and used Block instead, Shi Feng’s sword would have destroyed at least half of his life. Now, as a result of his accurate judgment, not only had Absolute Heaven managed to use Wind Steps to defend the attack, but he also managed to place quite some distance between them. Moreover, due to the 40% Movement Speed buff provided by Silent Steps, Absolute Heaven managed to widen the gap even further.

Seeing this, Shi Feng used Wind Blade and chased after Absolute Heaven. In the blink of an eye, the distance between the two shortened greatly.

Shi Feng’s Agility was very high. Throughout Star-Moon Kingdom, nobody that could surpass him in terms of Agility. There were also his equipment’s passive skills. Nobody could match Shi Feng in terms of speed. At this place, only the Level 50 Tier 1 Assassin and Ranger NPCs had a chance at beating him.

Absolute Heaven could not help his shocked. Immediately, he retrieved a Magic Scroll from his bag.

This Magic Scroll was aqua-colored, and it looked very exquisite. It turned out that it was actually a Tier 1 Magic Scroll.

Absolute Heaven then unrolled the Magic Scroll and used it on Shi Feng. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Water Binding!

Immediately, several jets of water shot out from the Magic Scroll. The water flew towards Shi Feng, intending to wrap around him.

Shi Feng revealed a calm smile, not faltering at the slightest as he continued charging at Absolute Heaven.

The moment the blue jets of water came into contact with Shi Feng, they lost all effectiveness and disappeared.

“It didn’t work?” A stunned expression appeared on Absolute Heaven’s face.

That was one of the precious Tier 1 Magic Scrolls that he possessed. The Magic Scroll could even entrap a Boss monster for a short moment. Yet, it was actually ineffective against Shi Feng.

Absolute Heaven did not know that before the battle had begun, Shi Feng had already activated the Aura of Space of the Seven Luminaries Crystal. The Aura of Space granted Shi Feng immunity to all control effects. Based on the strength of a Tier 1 Magic Scroll, it was still too weak to break through the effect of the Seven Luminaries Ring.

“Damn, it seems that I have no choice but to use this thing.”

Absolute Heaven unwillingly took out a shabby-looking Magic Scroll from his bag. This was an item that he had obtained by coincidence from an underground ruin. Although the Magic Scroll looked shabby, the magic power it gave off was frightening. Even an NPC Appraiser could not identify what Tier the Magic Scroll was. However, that Appraiser estimated that the Magic Scroll should be Tier 2 or higher.

Originally, Absolute Heaven had not intended to use this Scroll. After all, he only had one. However, if he did not use it now, with his opponent’s frightening speed, Shi Feng would definitely catch up to him in no time. If that happened, he would be in big trouble.
