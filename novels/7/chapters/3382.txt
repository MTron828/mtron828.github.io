Chapter 457 – Goddess’s First Appearance

“How can such an out-of-this-world body technique exist?”

“This is insane! A Tier 4 Sword Emperor is tanking five Legendary monsters solo?! Even Saints shouldn’t be able to pull off such a stunt!”

“No wonder the Vice Guild Leader is willing to pay such a high price to hire him. If Elder Parker finds out about this, he’ll probably die of regret.”

…

Everyone was greatly shocked as they watched Shi Feng taking on five Combat Puppets while staying in the air.

Although their team had less than 100 members because of Parker and Co’s betrayal, Shi Feng had single-handedly made up for the twelve missing players. This situation was both unbelievable and frightening.

It should be known that a Tier 5 MT with a Tier 5 Lifesaving Skill active could, at best, take on five Combat Puppets simultaneously. Moreover, it would only be for a very limited time. Yet, Shi Feng, a Tier 4 Sword Emperor, had accomplished this feat without the use of any Lifesaving Skills.

Meanwhile, Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja were greatly excited by this situation.

This body technique is simply incredible!?Cross wore a fervent look as he watched Shi Feng’s fight.?If I can successfully learn it as well, I can fight against even Extrasensory Realm experts!

Leroja also shared similar thoughts, her eyes full of surprise and hope.

Previously, she only knew that the Courtyard of Space’s hostile environment was actually a Gold Combat Technique’s Legacy in disguise. However, she had no idea exactly how powerful this Gold Combat Technique was.

However, after seeing Shi Feng transforming the sky into his battlefield, something which should be impossible to accomplish in the Eternal Realm, she quickly understood the value of the Flowing Space technique.

The boost in combat power this combat technique could provide to players in the Eternal Realm was utterly immense. It was especially so for Rangers like herself. If she could monopolize the skies while her opponents were stuck on the ground, she was confident she could fight against even fifth-floor experts.

…

So, this is a Gold Combat Technique?

Compared to Leroja and the others, Shi Feng was even more excited by Flowing Space’s effectiveness.

In addition to letting him sprint in mid-air, the technique also drastically boosted his speed on the ground. If he wanted to, every step he took on the ground could propel him across great distances instantaneously and leave over a dozen afterimages in his wake. This situation thoroughly renewed his opinion of Flowing Space and Gold Combat Techniques altogether.

In his previous life, Shi Feng never got to learn a Gold Combat Technique. The strongest technique he managed to learn was the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique. Now that he had successfully learned one, he finally understood how frightening Gold Combat Techniques could be. He also understood exactly how powerful the Goddess of Space’s Gold Body Technique was.

Even though his mastery of Flowing Space only reached the Stepping Space standard, not only did he gain a permanent 10% boost in reaction speed, but he also gained a huge boost in his Movement Speed and nimbleness while executing the technique. He was at least twice as fast and nimble than when he was outside the Eternal Realm. As icing on the cake, he also gained the ability to fly in the Eternal Realm. So long as he didn’t run out of Stamina and Concentration, he could remain in flight for as long as he wanted.

With all these benefits, even if he didn’t wield a Legendary Weapon, he was confident he could hold his ground against a Dragon of the same tier!

…

Meanwhile, outside the Courtyard of Space, nine hours after the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s activation…

Streams of light appeared outside the teleportation gate, the light revealing the silhouette of human players as they faded.

“Dammit! Damn it all!” Moro cursed as he glared at the dark pillar of light rising from the teleportation gate.

Parker, who was teleported out of the Courtyard of Space with Moro, also wore an ugly look, his face looking like it had aged by more than a decade.

“Hahaha! That’s one more team annihilated! And it’s even a team from the Red Dragon Nation this time!”

“The Red Dragon Nation’s team might be strong, but it’s a pity that the God Mode Courtyard of Space is unlike any of the other God Mode Team Dungeons we’ve seen before.”

“Indeed! I heard that even a team of 100 Tier 5 experts from the Holy Race’s side has gotten annihilated.”

…

Originally, the Courtyard of Space’s outside was supposed to be embroiled in a battle involving only a couple of thousand players. Currently, though, no fights were taking place around the teleportation gate. Players from both the human race and the Holy Race were merely resting, and neither side intended to fight.

Moreover, the number of players outside the Courtyard of Space had increased to several tens of thousands. And if one looked carefully, one would find that some of these players belonged to the teams that had previously entered the God Mode Courtyard of Space.

“Now that we’ve failed to raid the God Mode Courtyard of Space, what should we do next, Lord Moro?” Desert Web tentatively asked as he looked at Moro, who was clearly in a terrible mood.

After scanning the area and pondering for a moment, Moro said, “We wait!”

The God Mode Courtyard of Space’s difficulty was beyond his imagination. The Dungeon’s Final Boss was absurdly tough, gradually exhausting and eradicating his team. Meanwhile, teams that had suffered annihilation in a God Mode Team Dungeon could only reenter the Dungeon after the weekly cooldown period.

“We’re waiting?” Anxiously, Desert Web said, “But the Blood Hell Mountain Range would have already activated by the time the cooldown finishes…”

“Of course, we won’t wait for that long,” Moro said as he looked at the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s teleportation gate. Then, he sneered and continued, “I just checked, and not only is Frey’s team not here, but my friends’ list shows that she is still online. This proves that her team is still inside. Otherwise, the various powers’ experts here would have long since eliminated her team!”

“Do you mean to wait for Vice Guild Leader Frey’s team to come out?” Desert Web’s eyes lit up when he heard Moro’s words.

Currently, there were very few teams with the strength necessary to challenge the World Mode Courtyard of Space. This was because 99% of the raid teams that had previously gathered to raid the Courtyard of Space had entered the Dungeon’s God Mode difficulty. Out of the human teams gathered, the only one that managed to enter World Mode was Frey’s team.

The Courtyard of Space’s God Mode difficulty was already challenging beyond belief. So, one could easily imagine how challenging World Mode would be. If the teams present wished to successfully raid the World Mode Courtyard of Space once their respective cooldown periods were over, they would need plenty of information regarding the World Mode Dungeon.

Meanwhile, Frey’s team was undoubtedly the best source of information. It was also why so many people were gathered here.

Everyone was waiting for the players that had entered the World Mode Courtyard of Space to obtain information relating to the World Mode Dungeon.

Of course, these players had the option to not share any information, but if that was the case, there would only be one outcome awaiting them.

Death!

…

Inside the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s castle area…

A team of 88 players arrived at a double door leading into the central hall on the castle’s top floor. The doors were made of unknown material, and divine patterns giving off a primordial presence engraved on them. The doors emanated a frightening mental oppression that could easily cause ordinary Tier 4 experts to shudder.

When the players walked up to the double door, the doors slowly parted to reveal the central hall and two figures standing inside the hall. Upon seeing these two figures, the players couldn’t help but be shocked.

“An Ancient God’s aura! How is this possible?!”

“The Goddess of Space?”

Inside the central hall that was as wide as four sports stadiums, two figures measuring over ten meters in height stood in the middle. Of these two figures, one was male, while the other was female. Both figures radiated Divine Might so powerful that even Tier 6 players would subconsciously back away.

The woman in the hall was especially imposing. Even though the woman was just standing still, it felt like she was the master of the Courtyard of Space. Even the mana in everyone’s body was seemingly compelled to flow toward the woman.

At the same time as Shi Feng and the others discovered this woman, the woman in question also noticed their presence. Suddenly, she vanished from where she stood and reappeared in front of Shi Feng’s group, her spontaneous appearance making it seem as if she had always been standing in front of the group.

TL Notes:

Just a reminder that Extrasensory Realm = Beyond Domain Realm. When players reach this realm, they become able to utilize their 6th sense more effectively, allowing them to predict dangers and take appropriate countermeasures.

Realms of Refinement:

1)Refinement Realm – better control of subtle movements

2)Flowing Water Realm – better at piecing moves together to smoothen maneuvers

3)Void Realm – can’t remember what this is. I think it has something to do with having better perception.

4)Domain Realm (3 steps)* – vastly improved perception.

5)Beyond Domain Realm/Extrasensory Realm – improved 6th sense effectiveness Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

*Domain Realm is different from Mana Domain. Mana Domain is something gained through having superior control over mana. Thus far, Mana Domain has two stages, Mana Domain and World Creation.
