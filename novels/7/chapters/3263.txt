Chapter 338 – Mutant’s Rewards

…

TL Notes:

[1] Changed “Crumbling Earth” to “Rumbling Earth”

[2]***Important*** I wrongly misinterpreted the raws in Chapter 335. Fixed it now, and below are the changes I’ve made:

!!

Incorrect version:

This was great and all, but there was a problem in that the Four Gods Secret Art was split into four parts that corresponded to the Four Major Elements, and each part enhanced only one specific element. Moreover, only up to four players could learn the Four Gods Secret Art.

Corrected version:

This was great and all, but there was a problem in that the Four Gods Secret Art was split into four parts that corresponded to the Four Major Elements, and each part enhanced only one specific element. Moreover, each part could only be learned by one player, and up to a maximum of four players could learn the Four Gods Secret Art.

“Are they crazy?” Lightning Chaser was stunned by the Spells Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao used. “Do they think they can instantly kill the Mutated Heroic Spirit and block the Titan Behemoth’s attack with only Tier 4 Spells?”

The Mutated Heroic Spirit might be a Tier 4 Great Wizard, but it was still a Mutant.

In terms of overall strength, the Tier 4 Mutated Heroic Spirit was comparable to Legendary monsters. Although the Mutated Heroic Spirit was far less durable than Legendary monsters, it could attack using various combinations of Spells, achieving attacks far stronger than the average Legendary monster.

Moreover, as a Great Wizard, the Mutated Heroic Spirit possessed incredibly high Magic Resistance. The Mutant’s Magic Resistance was so high that ordinary Tier 4 Spells could hardly damage it, let alone take away 5% of its HP in one fell swoop.

Stopping the Titan Behemoth’s attack with only Tier 4 Spells was also a joke.

The Titan Behemoth might only be at the Mythic rank, but its Bloodline allowed it to have Strength at the Tier 5 standard. This was also why the Titan Behemoth could hold its ground against the Mutated Heroic Spirit. If any Tier 4 MT tried to tank the Mutated Heroic Spirit, they would have long since been reduced to ashes.

When Lightning Chaser thought Shi Feng’s party of three was going to get killed by the Titan Behemoth’s attack, the ground suddenly shook as if a magnitude-8 earthquake was taking place. Then, the ground several hundred yards around the Titan Behemoth cracked and burst apart, sending everyone but Shi Feng’s party flying into the air. Even the Titan Behemoth’s massive frame was sent airborne…

After the earth exploded, a stream of energy shot out of the shattered ground and struck the Defensive Spell the Mutated Heroic Spirit had cast to protect itself. Meanwhile, not only did this stream of energy instantly shatter the Defensive Spell, but it also rapidly reduced the Mutant’s HP.

“How is this possible?!”

It can be hard to make great work when its stolen from shorturl.at/mCEOX.

“Is this really the Rumbling Earth I know?”

Everyone was stunned by what they saw, whether it be the experts on the battlefield or the players spectating from the outside world.

Rumbling Earth was a widely available Tier 4 Spell in the Greater God’s Domain. Because of this, even newcomers who had only come into contact with God’s Domain recently knew about the Spell and its details.

However, compared to the Rumbling Earth everyone knew, the one they had just seen Midsummer cast felt like an entirely different Spell. For a moment, everyone even suspected that what Midsummer had cast wasn’t actually the Tier 4 Rumbling Earth but some Tier 5 Spell they didn’t know about. Otherwise, how could they explain the scale and power of Midsummer’s Rumbling Earth?

While the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP was continuously decreasing, the sky suddenly darkened, and the sound of thunder echoed throughout the entire Ancient River Secret Land. At the same time, countless water droplets formed in a 500-yard radius around the Mutated Heroic Spirit. Then, before anyone could react, these water droplets congregated around the Mutated Heroic Spirit.

In the blink of an eye, a waterspout with a height of nearly 1,000 meters appeared before everyone’s eyes.

The water droplets forming the waterspout were akin to sharp blades capable of cutting apart even space. Surrounded by these water droplets, the Mutated Heroic Spirit was utterly incapable of defending itself. As a result, damage values in the thousands rapidly appeared above the Mutant’s head, one after another. Combined with the constant stream of energy rising from the ground, it took only a second before the Mutated Heroic Spirit lost all of its HP. The Mutant’s death happened so quickly that nobody present had any time to react…

“This… Impossible!”

“Since when did the Tier 4 Waterspout become so strong?”

Everyone gaped in shock when they saw the dead Mutated Heroic Spirit and the deformed cliff.

Not only did Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao deform the entire cliff with only two Tier 4 Spells, but they also used these same Spells to instantly remove 5% of the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s HP. Moreover, this was only because the Mutated Heroic Spirit only had 5% of its HP remaining. Otherwise, Midsummer’s Rumbling Earth and Wu Xiaoxiao’s Waterspout could have caused even more damage.

At this time, the various experts present weren’t the only ones dumbfounded by this scene. Even Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao were shocked by the effects of their own Spells.

Is this the power of the Four Gods Secret Art?

Midsummer thought, feeling flabbergasted as she looked at the results her Rumbling Earth produced.

After being enhanced by the Four Gods Secret Art, Rumbling Earth, an ordinary Tier 4 Spell, had managed to exhibit power close to rivaling that of Tier 5 Curses. This result was completely different from the secret art’s description.

Right now, Midsummer suspected she could even fight against an actual Tier 5 player so long as she had the Four Gods Secret Art.

Of course, that was under the precondition that she had enough Seven Luminaries Crystals.

It cost 200 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal just to enhance one attack. Not even hegemonic powers would dare to fool around with the Four Gods Secret Art. After all, it was very normal for a battle between two Tier 5 players to involve dozens or hundreds of exchanges unless there was a significant gap.

As expected of one of the Six Great Secret Arts. It can already achieve such power with only two people using it together. If four people use it together, even an expert with a Gold Combat Technique mastered would have to run away, Shi Feng thought as he looked at the ruined cliff. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Every one of the Starlight Realm’s Six Great Secret Arts was only mentioned in legends. Nobody had ever seen the Six Great Secret Art’s true effects and power. Everyone only knew that they rivaled Gold Combat Techniques.

However, after seeing Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao using the Four Gods Secret Art, Shi Feng felt that the Six Great Secret Arts might be even more powerful than the legends described.

At this moment, Shi Feng even suspected that the old demon back then had already secretly gathered four people to learn the Four Gods Secret Art. Hence, he dared to reveal the so-called “Mana Cohesion Method” to the public. Either that or he had intended to spread the information so that he could get enough people to learn the Four Gods Secret Art. After all, if the Four Gods Secret Art was already so powerful with only two people using it, if four people used the secret art together, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them invincible among Tier 6 players.

While everyone was shocked, a purple glow enveloped Shi Feng, Midsummer, and Wu Xiaoxiao as all three of them leveled up to Level 140.

“The Mutant is dead! Snatch the loot!”

“Quick! Don’t let the three of them get the loot!”

Upon seeing Shi Feng’s group of three level up, everyone promptly snapped out of their daze and focused their attention on the items falling out of the sky.

The Mutated Heroic Spirit dropped over a hundred items on its death, and every one of these items radiated powerful mana and aura, an indicator that these items were extraordinary.

Currently, however, Shi Feng’s party was not only the closest to the loot, but the trio had also grasped the timing of the loot’s appearance the most accurately out of everyone. The trio had charged at the dropped items as soon as they appeared and started frenziedly grabbing items out of the air.

“Dammit! We’re a step too late!”

“Let’s join forces to kill them! Otherwise, none of us will be leaving with any loot!”

“Okay! Let’s kill them together!”

…

Immediately, everyone steeled their resolves and tacitly used their trump cards at Shi Feng’s party of three simultaneously.
