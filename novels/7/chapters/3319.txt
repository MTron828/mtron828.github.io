Chapter 394 – God Versus God

“Dammit! How did things turn out like this?!”

When Saint Arm sensed the terrifying amount of mana gathered in the Ancient God’s axe of light, a bitter look appeared on his face.

At this point, even a fool could tell that the Ancient God’s attack was strong enough to erase all existences caught within its radius. If players were struck by the attack, losing a few levels and items would be the least of their worries. They might never be able to log back into God’s Domain.

When White Owl saw the white-robed Ancient God’s axe of light, she let out a resigned sigh and said, “It seems it’s over.”

!!

If she was going up against a Tier 6 God’s attack, she was confident she could keep herself from suffering Soul Annihilation at the very least. However, Ancient Gods were unlike the average Tier 6 God. Every Ancient God had reached the extremes of a certain field.

Even among Tier 6 players, few could even survive against an Ancient God’s all-out attack. So, it was even more impossible for a Tier 5 player like herself to survive it.

However, when the Ancient God’s axe of light began its descent, and everyone could feel death approaching them, a 20-meter-tall man suddenly appeared out of thin air in front of Shi Feng. The man carried two exquisite longswords around his waist, and he wore a silver cloak with a hood that covered his head. Although the cloak made the man’s face indistinct, it was still vaguely possible to see the man’s sharp and seasoned eyes.

As soon as this mysterious man appeared, everyone’s hearts inexplicably shuddered.

“NPC?”

“An NPC?”

“Is it another God?”

“No, he’s not a God! He’s a player!”

…

When everyone saw the giant Swordsman, particularly the player symbol displayed above the Swordsman’s head, they couldn’t help but be confused.

Firstly, they were confused as to how a player could have such a huge body.

Secondly, they were confused by the frightening Divine Might the mysterious Swordsman radiated. The Swordsman’s Divine Might not only felt as powerful as the Ancient God’s Divine Might, but it even felt vaguely superior.

Why would such a Tier 6 player appear in this place? White Owl was similarly surprised to see the mysterious Swordsman. Could he be related to Zero Wing?

Others might not know how a player managed to gain such a gigantic body, but White Owl did.

In reality, it wasn’t anything strange for a Tier 6 player to have a 20-meter-tall body. After all, players were responsible for constructing their own Tier 6 Divine Body. Most Tier 6 players might still have a standard human body when they initially got promoted to Tier 6, but so long as they managed to come into contact with the core secrets surrounding Tier 6, they could even create a 200-meter-tall body, let alone a 20-meter-tall body.

Only, such Tier 6 players would normally only appear in the Twelve Sanctuaries. It wasn’t often one would come across such a Tier 6 player in Realms outside the Twelve Sanctuaries.

So, rather than the mysterious Swordsman’s size, White Owl was more surprised by how the mysterious Swordsman would appear in a Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage.

Before White Owl could make sense of the situation, the mysterious Swordsman could be seen unsheathing one of his longswords.

The longsword had a crimson body covered in black patterns, and black electric arcs constantly circulated the weapon’s blade. As soon as the crimson longsword was unsheathed, the surrounding void started to repeatedly self-destruct and self-repair. It was evident that even the void was incapable of withstanding the longsword’s power.

“Vanish!”

After unsheathing the crimson sword, the mysterious Swordsman indifferently said only one word before swinging his longsword at the white-robed Ancient God’s terrifying axe of light.

Immediately, a dark tide made up of black lightning arcs swarmed the descending brilliance.

Boom!

Suddenly, a blinding light filled the sky above the void sea, followed by a powerful shockwave that sent all players within vision range of the battlefield flying thousands of yards backward. At the same time, space-time cracks also formed across the void sea, annihilating any Void Sea Serpents and Void Sea Dragons next to them.

After the explosion, the players present on the void sea couldn’t help but gape in shock as they looked in the direction of the floating island.

“It’s gone?”

“That terrifying attack got erased?”

It should be known that the white-robed Ancient God’s attack had roused all mana within a 10,000-yard radius. Yet, the mysterious Swordsman had erased all of this mana.

He actually blocked an Ancient God’s all-out attack? Is he really just a player?

Saint Arm, who was struggling to keep himself from falling out of the sky, was greatly shocked as he watched the white-robed Ancient God trading blows with the mysterious Swordsman in the distance. He doubted that even the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Overlords could defend against the white-robed Ancient God’s all-out attack. Yet, the mysterious Tier 6 Swordsman had accomplished it with seemingly little effort.

In addition, what was even more unbelievable was that the mysterious Swordsman was currently trading blows with the white-robed Ancient God without losing any ground. It was also evident that the Ancient God wasn’t holding back against the mysterious Swordsman as every collision between the axe of light and crimson longsword would generate a shockwave that could be clearly felt from thousands of yards away.

As for the other players, their jaws dropped when they saw the exchange between the mysterious Swordsman and the white-robed Ancient God. It was especially so for newcomer players who had only recently come into contact with God’s Domain.

“Is this what battles between Tier 6 God-ranked players and Tier 6 Gods look like?”

This was the first time they had witnessed such a devastating confrontation since they entered God’s Domain until now. The area within a 3,000-yard radius of the mysterious Swordsman and white-robed Ancient God had become off-limits to all life as space-time rifts could be seen forming everywhere.

Moreover, a beam of light or a dark thunderbolt would also emerge from this forbidden zone and strike a random location within a 10,000-yard radius from time to time, the impact of these attacks instantly vaporizing numerous Void Creatures and players. Even Bronze Warships, which should be capable of withstanding one Tier 6 attack, were instantly reduced to ashes when struck…

If these two mighty beings were to continue fighting, their battle could even devastate an entire continent.

Compared to the newcomer players, though, the various hegemonic powers’ experts and the Paimon Conglomerate’s experts were in greater shock.

He can hold his ground against an Ancient God? Who is this person? White Owl was greatly confused as she watched the mysterious Tier 6 Swordsman fight.

Very few Tier 6 players could fight an Ancient God to a standstill in the Greater God’s Domain, and every one of these players was an apex existence in the Twelve Sanctuaries. However, as far as White Owl could tell, the mysterious Swordsman wasn’t one of these apex existences.

While White Owl was wondering about the mysterious Swordsman’s identity, the person in question and the white-robed Ancient God used their respective ultimate moves.

On the Ancient God’s side, the white-robed Ancient God summoned a star of light that illuminated the entire void sea, the star dozens of times larger than the floating island. If it struck the void sea, the resulting impact would obliterate all existences within a radius of several hundred thousand yards.

On the other side, the mysterious Swordsman raised his longsword and released a world-ending thunderbolt that pierced the descending star.

Boom!

Following an explosion that echoed throughout the entire World Passage, everyone’s vision went dark. Immediately afterward, the sound of a system notification entered everyone’s ears. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
