Chapter 2774 – Ancient Legacy Inheritor

Meteorite City, Skyflare Hotel:

The Skyflare adventurer team was one of the top three powers of Meteorite City, and the Skyflare Hotel it owned was one of the city’s landmarks. Not only did the hotel boast 19 floors, but it even occupied the largest plot of Land in the city’s business district, with roughly the footprint of a sports stadium.

The Skyflare Hotel also had the best resting environment in Meteorite City. Due to its relatively reasonable prices, it had become the first choice of many players and NPCs for lodging. The hotel was so popular that it ranked within the top 10 most profitable businesses of Meteorite City.

At this time, a Level 131 female Assassin clad in pitch-black Epic Equipment walked into the Skyflare Hotel’s top-floor lounge. She then stopped before an imposing man sorting documents behind an office table.

This imposing, middle-aged man was none other than the Skyflare adventurer team’s commander, Lionheart, nicknamed Raging

Lion.

“Commander, I’ve already looked into the person you mentioned. She’s Yu Luo, a Cleric from the knight legion.

“She’s the one responsible for spreading the information across the city. Not long ago, she made another announcement stating that her side will be hosting a small auction at the Auction House. They will be selling five Crystals of Souls and 50 drops of Soul Water, which is an inferior version of the Crystal of Souls,” the black-clad Assassin reported. She then passed a Memory Crystal to Lionheart and continued, “There is a record of her image in there. From what I found out, she seems to be a proxy. The real seller should be the party of five people that entered Meteorite City with the knight legion. I included a record of their appearances in the crystal. Of the five, the cloaked man walking in the lead is verified to be a Tier 4 Sword Emperor. However, I did not find any records of him appearing within Meteorite City’s vicinity.”

“Good job,” said the crimson light armor-clad Lionheart, who had reached Level 133. After glancing at the images recorded in the Memory Crystal, he nodded and looked toward the several vice commanders inside the lounge. He then asked calmly, “What do you guys think of this matter?”

“They’re simply picking a fight with Skyflare! We’ve already shown a lot of respect to that Sword Emperor by offering such a high price, yet they still refuse to reciprocate!” sneered a gloomy man standing beside the French window. “I think we need to teach these outsiders a lesson. If they wish to mingle in Meteorite City, they need to know their limits! The treasure in question can increase the success rate of completing the Tier 4 Promotion Quest. We absolutely cannot let the other powers in the city get their hands on it!”

The three other vice commanders present nodded in agreement with the gloomy man, Wind Chaser.

Although Wind Chaser was a cold and ruthless person, he was incredibly loyal to the Skyflare adventurer team. Most importantly, Wind Chaser was a Tier 4 Nightwalker. When it came to assassination, he was undoubtedly the best player in Meteorite City. In terms of top combatants, the Skyflare adventurer team was already the strongest player force in Meteorite City.

Simply put, this was the best opportunity for the Skyflare adventurer team to consolidate its grip on Meteorite City. Hence, how could they let other player forces gain an opportunity to rise up?

Now that the several outsiders were showing no respect to their adventurer team, they definitely needed to teach these outsiders a lesson.

It didn’t matter even if the other party had a Tier 4 Sword Emperor on its side. After all, not only did Wind Chaser hold a Peak Hidden Class, but he had even inherited a special Mana Technique. So long as he was hidden in the darkness, he could potentially one-shot even Tier 4 MTs, let alone a Tier 4 Sword Emperor.

“Well, let’s go over and talk to him first. If we can agree on a good price, everybody can be happy. If not, it won’t be too late to take action,” Lionheart said after giving the matter some thought.

Lionheart, too, agreed with Wind Chaser’s opinion, especially about the Crystal of Souls, which could strengthen a player’s soul by a small margin.

After all, the strength of a player’s soul would greatly affect their learning ability. Even a small boost to the soul would be a great help to players learning a Tier 4 Skill or Spell during their Promotion Quest.

Hence, Skyflare had to obtain the Crystal of Souls.

The four vice commanders present all nodded in agreement with Lionheart’s decision. “Billow, find out that Sword Emperor’s current location. I need to know right away,” Lionheart ordered the black-clad Assassin.

“Commander, don’t you know how I operate?” Smiling, the petite Assassin named Crimson Billow added, “As soon as you told me to look into this matter, I set my sights on that Sword Emperor. Hence, I had people keep track of his every move. Currently, that Sword Emperor is at the Auction House. By the looks of it, he plans to rent an auction hall to host a small auction.”

“Good!” Lionheart nodded in satisfaction as he looked at Crimson Billow. “Billow, you and Chaser will follow me in secret. I’ll meet with that Sword Emperor in person and find out his origins and purpose.”

Truthfully, he felt very curious about the Sword Emperor mentioned. Tier 4 players were still incredibly rare in the current God’s Domain. According to Skyflare’s information network, most Main Cities had only one Tier 4 player. The Main Cities with two or three Tier 4 players were all cities with massive populations.

Logically, after a player reached Tier 4, the first thing they should do was expand their influence in their city as much as possible, capitalizing on their advantage. However, this foreign Sword Emperor had actually chosen to visit another city. It was simply inconceivable.

“Understood!” Crimson Billow and Wind Chaser responded respectfully.

Meteorite City, Auction House:

Meteorite City was a large trade city, and the Auction House could be said to be the most prosperous place here. Not only was the local Auction House much larger than the ones found in the modern God’s Domain’s royal capitals, but its visitor traffic was also massive.

A huge variety of products was on sale, including Mana Ore, which was quite rare in the modern God’s Domain, sold by the stackat dastardly cheap prices.

One stack of 200 Mana Ores cost only 49 Magic Crystals!

If sold in the modern God’s Domain, it would be bought out instantly. After all, Mana Ore was a byproduct of certain ores, and the chances of acquiring it were low. Hence, the price of Mana Ore in the modern world was already close to 30 Silver Coins per piece. Even then, supply was still tight.

It’s a pity I can’t travel freely between the two worlds. Otherwise, I could definitely make a killing, and Zero Wing wouldn’t have to worry about lacking funds and resources anymore, Shi Feng sighed ruefully as he looked at the available items in the Auction House.

According to the old man’s words, only ten people could visit the ancient God’s Domain at a time. Moreover, while first-time visitors could get in for free, the second visit onward had a price.

It might be fine if the price was reasonable, but if it was exorbitant, his visits to the ancient era would be limited.

Although he could leave the visits to other people, the importance of the ancient God’s Domain was too significant. If the Earthfall Secret Land’s secret got out, every superpower on the continent would either try to annihilate Zero Wing or compete for the secret land.

Shi Feng spent 500 Magic Crystals to rent a small auction hall that could fit 200 people, at most. For Meteorite City’s various powers, this number was already more than enough. After Shi Feng finished making the necessary arrangements, an imposing and mighty man suddenly approached him. The man was clad in crimson light armor and carried a knight’s shield with crimson runes.

At the appearance of this imposing man, silence descended momentarily on the entire Auction House. Everyone looked at this man in surprise, a hint of awe and admiration gleaming in the eyes of both players and NPCs. “Crap! It’s Lionheart!”

“He looks so handsome! He looks much better than the photo on Skyflare’s promotional posters! But, why is a bigshot like him here?” “Could it be because of the news of that small auction?”

A discussion over Lionheart promptly broke out in the Auction Hall. Everyone couldn’t help wondering why a VIP like Lionheart would personally visit the Auction House.

“Skyflare’s commander?! He actually came in person?!”

Yu Luo, who had just arrived in the Auction House, gaped in shock and doubted her eyes when she saw Lionheart enter the building.

Lionheart was an amazing individual. Despite having started with nothing in this ruthless world, the adventurer team he established had grown to the point where it managed to defeat several large Guilds and become one of the top three powers in Meteorite City. In terms of achievements, the Skyflare adventurer team easily eclipsed the Heaven’s Blade adventurer team.

On the Interstellar Continent, living resources were incredibly scarce. Ordinary civilians couldn’t hope to compare with large Guilds in terms of the resources they could acquire. This was because large Guilds generally had high-level authorities as backers. These authorities boasted resources and influence far greater than those of the large Guilds on Earth.

Just one word from these high-level authorities would be enough to allow a civilian who could barely feed themself to move to the Interstellar Continent’s core area. In the core area, one would be able to not only eat like a king but also enjoy recreational activities in the real world and appreciate the beauty of the vast universe.

Just this point alone allowed large Guilds to walk over civilian players with no background.

Meanwhile, Lionheart was only a civilian on the Interstellar Continent. His development of Skyflare to such an extent was a remarkable feat. He was practically a legend among the civilians there. If he were in the modern God’s Domain, he would definitely become a noteworthy existence known throughout the mainland. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The next moment, Lionheart stopped before Shi Feng. Immediately, everyone in the Auction House focused on Shi Feng curiously, the stares making him feel very uncomfortable. “You’re the person selling the Crystals of Souls, right?” Looking at Shi Feng, Lionheart went straight to the point, saying, “I am Lionheart, the Skyflare adventurer team’s commander. You should’ve heard of me already.”

“Of course, I’ve heard of you. In fact, I’ve heard a lot about you.” Shi Feng did not deny Lionheart’s statement. Calmly, he asked, “May I know what business you have with me?”

Shi Feng had gained plenty of information regarding Lionheart. The man was undoubtedly a powerhouse. Not only did he reach the Domain Realm, but he had even set foot onto the second step-the Upper Domain Realm. The amount of time he had spent immersed in virtual reality games was much greater than that of the modern God’s Domain’s players. Rumor had it that Lionheart’s control over Mana had already reached the Advanced Master Magician standard and that he was only half a step away from becoming a Grandmaster.

In addition, Lionheart also possessed an Ancient Hidden Class called the Blood Knight, which gave him the strongest Defense among players. At this point, he was a complete monster when it came to Defense.

His terrifying Defense was why the Skyflare adventurer team had managed to conquer plenty of powerful Bosses. The adventurer team had even killed quite a few Level 120 Superior Mythic Bosses. Hence, Lionheart was also known as Meteorite’s Wall by Meteorite City’s players.

“This isn’t a place to talk. Why don’t we find a place to sit down and have a proper conversation?” Lionheart suggested as he scrutinized Shi Feng. When he saw Shi Feng’s special state, he was surprised and confused. However, he quickly set aside his surprise and treated Shi Feng with the respect due a foreign Tier 4 expert.

“Sure.” Shi Feng nodded. He then turned to the empty space a short distance behind Lionheart and asked, “Are those two coming along too?”
