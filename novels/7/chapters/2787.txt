Chapter 2788 – Illusory Flames

While Lionheart agreed enthusiastically to Shi Feng’s offer, Yu Luo looked at Shi Feng in surprise. She never thought that Shi Feng would actually be willing to sell the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. In the modern God’s Domain, Zero Wing was the sole Guild to own Flying Ships. Many superpowers wished to purchase one from Zero Wing, yet Zero Wing had rejected all offers. Of course, everyone could also understand that decision. After all, Zero Wing could reap more advantages by monopolizing the Flying Ship than selling it.

If news got out that Shi Feng was selling a Crimson Dragon Flying Ship to the Skyflare adventurer team, the various superpowers operating in the modern era would definitely die of envy.

However, what Yu Luo wasn’t aware of was that Shi Feng had decided to sell Skyflare a Flying Ship because matters of the ancient era wouldn’t influence the modern era.

It was challenging for players of the modern era to visit the ancient era. And even if they managed to travel to the ancient era by luck, they wouldn’t be able to stay for long. The number of players that could travel to the ancient era wouldn’t be significant, either. Likewise, the ancient era’s players would have a tough time visiting the modern era. It was unlikely for the two worlds to have any major interaction with each other at this point.

To put it simply, even if he sold a Crimson Dragon Flying Ship to the Skyflare adventurer team, Skyflare wouldn’t affect Zero Wing’s advantages in the modern era. Hence, he could trade some precious items to Skyflare without worry.

Moreover, if Skyflare grew stronger in the ancient era, the adventurer team would also have an easier time collecting the ancient era’s various resources for him.

After all, he had neither the time nor the strength to establish his own force in the ancient era. In that case, relying on the local powers to secure resources was the next best option.

Most importantly, the fewer the people that knew of the secret between the two worlds, the better. Otherwise, be it in the ancient God’s Domain or modern God’s Domain, he shouldn’t think of living a peaceful life.

“Commander Lionheart, if you wish to purchase the Flying Ship, it will cost you 10,000 Titan Silver ingots, 1,000 Magic Elven Stones, and 1,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals,” Shi Feng stated his price directly. For the time being, he could already secure more than enough Magic Crystals through exchanging the Crystals of Souls and Soul Water. Compared to Magic Crystals, he prioritized obtaining materials that were rare in the modern God’s Domain and Seven Luminaries Crystals.

Moreover, trying to obtain these rare materials with the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water would be difficult since Crystals of Souls and Soul Water were nonessentials. After all, they merely increased players’ chances of completing their Tier 4 Promotion Quest by a little.

More precisely, the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water merely helped players complete their Tier 4 Promotion Quests ahead of time. In the case of players who never had a chance to complete their Tier 4 Promotion Quest to begin with, the items would be useless. This point was something anyone who had used the two items would know.

Hence, while the various powers could accept using Magic Crystals, which were abundant, to exchange for Crystals of Souls and Soul Water, they would think twice if the requested currency was a strategic or rare material. After all, collecting these materials wasn’t an easy task, and they were necessary for many applications. These materials basically served as the foundation of the various powers. “That much?” Lionheart frowned automatically when he heard Shi Feng’s price.

Although he had known that the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship wouldn’t be cheap, he never expected such a steep price.

Titan Silver and Magic Elven Stone were precious resources essential to the construction of many buildings and the production of important items. As for the Seven Luminaries Crystal, it was something all players and powers coveted.

The Skyflare adventurer team had gone to great lengths and sacrificed many experts to occupy a small area that generated Seven Luminaries Crystals. Moreover, Skyflare still had to station over a thousand Tier 3 experts there to guard the area at all times. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Meanwhile, the price of 1,000 Seven Luminaries Crystals would basically zero out Skyflare’s stockpile. Upon seeing Lionheart’s reaction, Shi Feng said unhurriedly, “Of course, this is only the first option, Commander Lionheart. You can also consider going with the second option, which is to let me invest in Skyflare and give me 5% of Skyflare’s income in the future.” “Five percent?” Lionheart pondered Shi Feng’s offer carefully.

Honestly speaking, 5% of the current Skyflare adventurer team’s income wasn’t a significant amount. However, the story would change when Skyflare grew stronger. In the long run, the income Skyflare lost would definitely far exceed the price of Shi Feng’s first offer.

“Commander, my suggestion is to go with the first option,” Wind Chaser whispered as he looked at Lionheart agonizing over Shi Feng’s offer. “Although we’ll be broke for some time after buying the Flying Ship, Skyflare’s value will far exceed those resources in the future.”

Now that Skyflare already had five Tier 4 players, its future was promising. Giving away part of its income for just one Flying Ship was unnecessary. The other Skyflare executives also looked toward Lionheart, their eyes clearly conveying agreement with Wind Chaser.

Taking a deep breath, Lionheart looked at Shi Feng and said, “Brother Black Flame, I chose the first trading option. Once this operation is over, we can conduct the transaction in Meteorite City. However, the amount of materials you need is too significant.

“While we have enough Seven Luminaries Crystals, I can’t say the same for the Titan Silver and Magic Elven Stones. I don’t think we can meet your demands even if we take out Meteorite City’s stockpile. We can, at most, fulfill 50% of your required amount. May I know if we can make up for the remaining amount using 100 top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment?”

“This...” After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng said, “That’s fine as well, but I will accept only Level 150 Epic Weapons and Equipment.”

In Meteorite City, the total value of 5,000 Titan Silver ingots and 500 Magic Elven Stones was equivalent to 80 top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment, at most. Moreover, acquiring so many top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment wouldn’t necessarily be possible. After all, while many NPC merchants in the ancient God’s Domain sold Epic Weapons and Equipment, there was still a limit.

This was especially true for top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment. Their rarity in the ancient era was not the slightest bit lower than in the modern era.

Often, acquiring these items meant raiding Mythic Bosses and even Superior Mythic Bosses. Bosses of such caliber were incredibly limited, and one would be fortunate to find even 20 of such Bosses within Meteorite City’s vicinity each week. Moreover, even if Skyflare now had many Tier 4 experts, raiding Superior Mythic Bosses still carried great risks.

Lionheart’s offer of 100 top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment to make up for the difference was definitely favorable for Shi Feng.

Shi Feng understood Lionheart’s reason for doing so. In fact, if he were in Lionheart’s shoes, he would go with such an option too. After all, the risks that came with giving away Skyflare’s shares were massive.

However, Shi Feng didn’t really mind Lionheart’s choice, either, since his initial goal was to obtain a large amount of Titan Silver, Magic Elven Stones, and Seven Luminaries Crystals. The second option wasn’t actually a good option for him. After all, the number of times he could enter the ancient God’s Domain was limited. For Zero Wing, which was currently in dire need of resources, such a long-term investment wasn’t desirable.

This outcome was undoubtedly the best for Shi Feng. Moreover, exchanging half of the required Titan Silver and Magic Elven Stones into top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment was also a good deal for him. After all, the current Zero Wing hardly had any Level 150 Epic Weapons and Equipment.

With these top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment, Zero Wing’s executives would also have an easier time completing their Tier 4 Promotion Quests.

“That won’t be a problem.” Lionheart nodded. Simultaneously, he revealed a bitter smile.

For the sake of purchasing one Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, he had basically emptied out Skyflare’s coffers. After this transaction, Skyflare would severely lack for not only Magic Crystals and various strategic resources but also weapons and equipment.

However, despite knowing this, all of Skyflare’s executives revealed ecstatic expressions on their faces. They also continuously admired and inspected the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. It was as if they could already imagine the beautiful future that awaited Skyflare once they obtained the Flying Ship.

The Crimson Dragon Flying Ship flew for a dozen hours or so. After passing through numerous large maps, it finally arrived at a dusky land. Despite flames burning everywhere, this land was heavily forested.

As soon as everyone entered this map, they immediately felt their Stamina and Concentration depleting.

In response, Crimson Billow drank a Fire Resistance Potion. However, she still sensed her Stamina and Concentration decreasing gradually and couldn’t help feeling a little surprised. “Fire Resistance has no effect on the flames here. At this rate, I’m afraid we’ll run out of Stamina and die if we stay here for more than a dozen hours.”

Normally, an increase in a person’s Fire Resistance would allow them to counter all debuffs from fire. However, her increased Fire Resistance was actually useless here. This situation was simply unprecedented.

“It seems that we’ll have to move quickly.” While sensing the changes in his own body, Wind Chaser said, “Otherwise, we’ll probably be annihilated before we can kill that Tier 4 Infant Dragon.”

Nodding, Shi Feng promptly commanded, “All Tier 3s will remain on the Flying Ship, while Tier 4s spread out and search for the Infant Dragon. Once you locate the Infant Dragon, report back immediately!”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Skyflare’s five Tier 4 players promptly floated up, ready to start looking for the Tier 4 Infant Dragon.

Meanwhile, Lifeless Thorn, Solitary Nine, and Yu Luo, who had been concealing their auras with their Black Cloaks all this time, also gradually rose into the air, the sight attracting the attention of Skyflare’s executives.

“They’re Tier 4s too?” Crimson Billow was shocked as she looked at Lifeless Thorn’s group of three.

Although Shi Feng had already surprised her plenty of times, she still found it astonishing that the three players who had tagged along with Shi Feng were also Tier 4 players.

After all, Tier 4 players were still rare in the entire God’s Domain. On average, a Main City would only have one or two Tier 4 players. Yet, it was revealed that not only Shi Feng but even the people following him were Tier 4 players.

Since when were Tier 4 players as common as cabbages? “It seems Black Flame has far more secrets than we think. Fortunately, we chose to partner with him. I really don’t want to imagine what would have happened had we chosen to make an enemy out of him,” Wind Chaser said, smiling bitterly.

Yu Luo aside, Lifeless Thorn and Solitary Nine were part of the group that entered Meteorite City with Shi Feng. Now that three out of the group of five were confirmed to be Tier 4 players, it wouldn’t be strange that the other two players were hidden Tier 4s as well.

To think that we were actually planning to use force if negotiations failed... In retrospect, Wind Chaser found their thoughts laughable.

Subsequently, after Shi Feng’s group of nine searched for about half an hour, Crimson Billow’s voice suddenly appeared in the team chat.

“I found the Infant Dragon! It’s resting inside a cave in the southwest valley!”
