Chapter 898 – A Talented Subject Knows the Right Leader to Serve

A Mortal God?! Another Mortal God?! Ember Dragon felt an indescribable sense of oppression as he scrutinized Purgatory Jade’s every move. Feeling his sanity reaching its limit, he turned to the bandaged youth beside him and quietly asked, “Didn’t you say that there were no sixth-floor experts in this Greater God’s Domain?! Why are they appearing one after another now?! Are you sure you’re not playing tricks on me?!”

“I don’t know.” The bandaged youth was equally surprised as he looked at Purgatory Jade. However, he quickly stated in a firm tone, “But I’m certain she hasn’t come into contact with that side yet.”

“She hasn’t?” Ember Dragon sighed in relief and quickly regained his composure. Then, when he returned his gaze to Purgatory Jade, a hint of passion appeared in his eyes as he thought, Although I don’t know Dragon’s Crown’s origins, the fact that it has two sixth-floor experts should mean that it has a guide to the sixth-floor standard. If I can win Dragon’s Crown’s favor, I’ll be able to advance to the sixth-floor standard before those people! At that time, pseudo-apex powers will be nothing but jokes!

Besides Ember Dragon, the representatives of the other pseudo-apex powers also marveled at Dragon’s Crown’s strength and foundation, and they all started to have their own designs. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Currently, none of the Greater God’s Domain’s surface apex powers had sixth-floor experts. Although these apex powers might have hidden their sixth-floor experts, the possibility was low. After all, if these apex powers gained a sixth-floor expert, it would be in their best interest to let everyone know about it.

Firstly, a sixth-floor expert could serve as excellent promotional material. In God’s Domain, any power that wanted to flourish needed a constant influx of talented newcomers. By letting everyone know it had a sixth-floor expert, an apex power could attract many geniuses.

Take Holy Dragon Spear, for example. Talented newcomers from all over the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary flocked to Holy Dragon Spear once they discovered that Red Frost had achieved the sixth-floor standard. This was also why the various powers started to be wary of the adventurer team.

Secondly, a sixth-floor expert could be used as a deterrence. If an apex power had a sixth-floor expert under its command, other apex powers would have to think twice when picking a fight with it. Before a conflict escalated into an all-out war, they would likely avoid pulling small tricks on it.

These two points alone made it more than worthwhile for the various apex powers to reveal the sixth-floor experts under their command. Yet, there had never been any news of any apex power having a sixth-floor expert all these years. Even news of experts reaching the Half-step Mortal God standard was few and far between. Thus, the various apex powers most likely did not have any sixth-floor experts.

Although the current Dragon’s Crown wasn’t well-known, the fact that it commanded at least two sixth-floor experts already put it above all the surface apex powers. Not to mention, Purgatory Jade had introduced herself as merely Dragon’s Crown’s Second Vice Guild Leader. It should be known that a Guild’s strongest member would never be a Vice Guild Leader. Many pseudo-apex powers’ Vice Guild Leaders couldn’t even rank among the top 20 of the Guild’s strongest combatants.

Even if Dragon’s Crown operated somewhat differently, the fact that Purgatory Jade was the Second Vice Guild Leader meant that the Guild should at least have ten sixth-floor experts. This number was utterly terrifying.

Compared to the other pseudo-apex powers’ representatives, South Lake and Apocalypse reacted much more calmly to the latest revelation.

“This young lady looks about the same age as Red Frost. Between the two of them, who do you think is stronger, old commander?” South Lake asked Apocalypse through the party chat.

Although South Lake was surprised that Purgatory Jade was a Mortal God, he didn’t find it unbelievable that Dragon’s Crown could have two sixth-floor experts, considering that his adventurer team already had one.

“Both of them might have reached that realm, but…” After thinking for a while, Apocalypse continued, “If they fought with the same Basic Attributes, Frost wouldn’t last more than five moves…”

“Only five?” South Lake looked at Apocalypse in astonishment.

“It pains me to say it, but this person… Even though she has no Divine Artifacts, I doubt I can last three moves against her…” Apocalypse said, deep-seated fear coloring his eyes as he gazed at Purgatory Jade.

“What?!” South Lake was thoroughly dumbfounded.

On the surface, South Lake might be Holy Dragon Spear’s number one expert, but the truth was that Apocalypse was the actual number one. Furthermore, even after considering all the experts operating behind the scenes in the Greater God’s Domain, Apocalypse could compete for a spot among the top ten.

Initially, South Lake thought that Apocalypse could still triumph over Purgatory Jade by relying on his vastly superior equipment standard. He had never expected to hear such an evaluation from Apocalypse.

“Vice Guild Leader Jade, may I know what brings you to our humble place? Do you have instructions for us?” Ember Dragon took the initiative to break the silence when he noticed the other representatives lost in their own thoughts. He also made sure to maintain a respectful attitude.

As Ember Dragon spoke, the representatives of other pseudo-apex powers snapped out of their daze and cursed their slow reactions.

“I’m not here to give instructions,” Purgatory Jade said as she walked up to the round table and casually took a seat. “I’m only here to discuss a partnership with you all.”

“A partnership?”

Everyone’s eyes lit up at these words.

Dragon’s Crown was an apex power that had at least two sixth-floor experts. It would be a godsend if they could collaborate with such a powerful Guild.

“Yes, a partnership.” Purgatory Jade smiled as she took in everyone’s reaction. “However, this partnership isn’t with Dragon’s Crown, but Dragon’s Crown’s most valuable ally instead.”

“Your most valuable ally?” Ember Dragon was greatly shocked by Purgatory Jade’s statement.

Tarnished Wind, South Lake, and the other representatives also gasped in shock, wondering if they had misheard.

Dragon’s Crown was frighteningly powerful, even for an apex power. Yet, it was willing to act as an intermediary for someone else. Purgatory Jade even emphasized that Dragon’s Crown valued this ally greatly. Most likely, this “ally” was at least as strong, or even stronger than, Dragon’s Crown.

“Vice Guild Leader Jade, it is our honor to be able to partner with Dragon’s Crown’s most valuable ally,” Ember Dragon said, being the first to express his stance. “May we know how we can conduct this partnership? And can we know who your ally is?”

“The content of the partnership is something you all know. It is this secret land. It is also the Access Key you have been searching for,” Purgatory Jade stated.

Although Purgatory Jade spoke leisurely, her words shocked the various representatives to their core. They also finally understood how the Access Key was redeemed so quickly.

After learning who was responsible for redeeming the Access Key, the various pseudo-apex powers’ representatives were more or less conflicted. However, when they realized that the other party was a power that could get Dragon’s Crown to act as an intermediary, they immediately stopped fussing over the details and accepted the situation.

After all, it would be suicidal to try to compete with a power as strong as Dragon’s Crown.

“As for Dragon’s Crown’s most valuable ally, its name is Zero Wing!”
