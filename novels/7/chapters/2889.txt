Chapter 2890 – War God’s Temple’s Reward

War God’s Temple, War God’s Hall:

In a hall enveloped by starlight, a middle-aged man wearing a white divine robe and a turquoise crown sat on a throne made entirely of Seven Luminaries Crystals. The man slowly opened his eyes when he sensed the arrival of Shi Feng and the senior administrator. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After reaching the middle of the hall, the senior administrator reported respectfully, “Lord Temple Lord, this person is here to claim the bounty on an Evil God Envoy.”

The robed man took a closer look at Shi Feng and the restricted Beast Emperor upon hearing the senior administrator’s words. He then nodded and said, “Administrator Roa, you may take your leave.”

Normally, a lofty Temple Lord wouldn’t need to handle the bounty of an Evil God Envoy. However, Shi Feng was a Tier 5 individual, an existence standing at Star-Moon Kingdom’s apex. Hence, even the Temple Lord had to treat this matter with care. Shi Feng likewise curiously scrutinized the Temple Lord. Star-Moon City’s War God’s Temple was the headquarters for the War God’s Temple’s branches in Star-Moon Kingdom. Meanwhile, Howard Ragewind, the Temple Lord of this branch headquarters, also happened to be the War God’s Temple’s strongest combatant stationed in Star-Moon Kingdom. After taking a look at Howard Ragewind, Shi Feng had to admit that the War God’s Temple deserved to be called the strongest force in God’s Domain. This was because even the Temple Lord of a kingdom’s branch headquarters was a Level 200, Tier 4 NPC.

A half-step Tier 5 NPC, to be precise. Not only did Howard Ragewind possess an incredibly high Life Rating, but his mastery over the various elements was also considerable. He was only a short distance from creating his Tier 5 Mana Body and getting promoted to Tier 5.

Moreover, the staff and crown Howard Ragewind owned were both Legendary items. Even an actual Tier 5 existence would struggle against him. Looking at Shi Feng, Howard Ragewind asked, “Lord Sword Saint, may I verify that Evil God Envoy?” “Certainly.”

Shi Feng waved his hand. Beast Emperor’s body immediately flew toward the Temple Lord. However, because Beast Emperor had forcibly logged out of the game already, his body was merely an empty shell.

After Beast Emperor’s soulless body arrived in front of Howard Ragewind, its restraints disappeared. Simultaneously, the magic arrays set up around the hall activated and bound Beast Emperor’s body with golden chains covered with divine runes. Even if Beast Emperor were a Tier 5 player, he wouldn’t be able to break these divine chains.

“You are amazing, Lord Sword Saint. You actually caught an Evil God Envoy. This is a subordinate the Evil God has spent much to nurture. Now that you’ve captured one, the continent will be in peace for quite some time,” Howard Ragewind said, his eyes glowing with joy when he finished inspecting Beast Emperor’s body. The Evil God was incapable of descending onto the main continent. At most, he could only plague the continent through the Legacies he left on the continent. Meanwhile, people who had acquired and utilized the Evil God’s Legacies were known as Evil God Envoys. Compared to Evil God Apostles, the capture of an Evil God Envoy was many times more valuable.

This was because only Evil God Envoys could use the power of the Evil God’s Legacies. There was a limited number of Evil God Legacies on the continent, so the loss of an Envoy meant the disappearance of one Evil God Legacy.

“You overpraise me, Lord Temple Lord,” Shi Feng said calmly.

Shi Feng had long since known that Beast Emperor was an Evil God’s Envoy. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have visited the War God’s Temple in such a hurry.

Afterward, Howard Ragewind chanted an incantation, and Beast Emperor’s body gradually disintegrated under the power of the golden chains. When Beast Emperor’s physical body disappeared, Shi Feng saw a translucent soul appear in its place. However, under the magic arrays’ effects, the translucent soul also dissipated quickly.

The entire process lasted no more than 20 seconds. When Howard Ragewind stopped chanting, Beast Emperor’s existence had been expunged from God’s Domain. Beast Emperor would have to start from scratch if he wished to enter God’s Domain again. Meanwhile, without the Evil God’s Legacy, Beast Emperor would pose no threat to Zero Wing. He might even have problems reaching Tier 4. After Beast Emperor disappeared, Shi Feng received a notification from the system.

System: Congratulations! You have captured an Evil God Envoy. Rewarding 100,000 War God’s Temple Merit Points, 3,000 War God’s Temple Reputation Points, five Levels, and 50 Legacy Skill Points. System: Your War God’s Temple Reputation has reached 6,700 points. Rewarding “War God’s Envoy” title. You will enjoy status and authority equivalent to a War God’s Temple Elder with this title.

Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the rewards. Although he had expected a generous reward, he never dreamed it would be this generous. Setting aside how many items he could exchange from the War God’s Treasury with 100,000 Merit Points, just the War God Envoy title more than justified his efforts.

While the War God’s Temple had countless branches across God’s Domain, it had a limited number of Elders. The status of Elder exceeded even that of Branch Temple Lords in the War God’s Temple. With this status, Shi Feng could directly recommend Zero Wing be one of the Top Ten Rookie Guilds of God’s Domain. Zero Wing would no longer have to go through the coming year’s selection competition. Instead, it could directly participate in the competition for the twelve reserve seats. Moreover, God’s Domain’s Top Ten Rookie Guilds also got to enjoy a portion of the twelve reserve seats’ authority, including having a Guild garrison a kingdom and enjoy the worship of this kingdom. Seeing Shi Feng in deep thought, Howard Ragewind approached him and said respectfully, “Lord Sword Saint, because of your contributions, you are now the War God’s Temple’s Envoy. If you encounter any trouble in the future or need help with something, I will be more than happy to help.”

“That’s great.” Upon hearing the Temple Lord’s offer, Shi Feng asked, “I wish to recommend my Guild as a candidate for the Top Tep Rookie Guilds. I also wish to have my Guild garrison Star-Moon Kingdom. May I know what I need to do to accomplish this?” This was his first time enjoying an Elder’s privileges in the War God’s Temple, so he had no clue how to recommend a Guild become a Top Ten Rookie Guild. Howard Ragewind was undoubtedly the perfect candidate to answer this question.

“This is simple. All you need to do is write a recommendation letter, and I’ll pass it on to the main headquarters’ Elders. Afterward, you just need to wait. I believe that news of your Guild becoming one of the Top Ten Rookie Guilds will spread across the continent in a few days, Lord Sword Saint,” Howard Ragewind replied, smiling. “Having your Guild garrison Star-Moon Kingdom is even easier. I am good friends with the King. Once the War God’s Temple makes its announcement, the King will be more than happy to let your Guild garrison Star-Moon Kingdom. So long as you give your approval, your Guild can become Star-Moon Kingdom’s Representative Guild on the same day!”

“I will have to trouble you with that, then, Lord Temple Lord,” Shi Feng said joyfully. He initially thought he would face a troublesome process. The Top Ten Rookie Guilds enjoyed extraordinary status in God’s Domain. Although they didn’t have the authority to decide the development of an entire country, the benefits of becoming the Representative Guild of a country were massive. Representative Guilds would receive precious resources from their respective countries upon taking the position, and these resources included Seven Luminaries Crystals and various Legendary materials. With luck, a Guild might even receive Inferior Divine Artifact ranked materials.

After writing the recommendation letter, Shi Feng went to the temple’s core treasury, a place only those at the Branch Temple Lord status or above could enter.

Sure enough, it’s impossible to exchange for Legendary Weapons and Equipment directly. Shi Feng sighed in disappointment when he scanned the exchange list at the treasury. Although the War God’s Treasury offered Legendary Weapons and Equipment for exchange, only NPCs could use these items. The weapons and equipment usable by players were limited to the Fragmented Legendary rank or below. Of course, the Divine Artifacts that cost over 200,000 Merit Points were the exception. However, it was practically impossible for anyone to accumulate that many points. At this point, Shi Feng switched to browsing the treasury’s materials. When he saw the list of materials, he couldn’t help sighing in admiration. After all, the treasury housed over 500,000 Legendary materials and 10,000 Divine Artifact materials!

This is...a Divine Power Source! Shi Feng was stunned when he read the description of one Divine Artifact ranked material.

(Scorching Eye) (Divine Artifact Rank Material)

An Eye of Flame naturally formed from a Divine Power Source. The Scorching Eye can be merged with a person’s body to improve their Life Rating significantly.

Required Merit Points: 70,000

Shi Feng had investigated Divine Power Sources on multiple occasions. However, he never managed to find any information on them.

He never thought that he would come across one in the War God’s Temple. However, he gasped involuntarily when he saw how many Merit Points the Scorching Eye cost. The average Fragmented Legendary Weapon only cost around 40,000 Merit Points, yet the Scorching Eye cost 70,000 Merit Points despite being only a material. For comparison, God Crystals, which were also considered materials, only cost 7,000 Merit Points. There are four Divine Power Sources in the War God’s Treasury, but I can afford only one with my current points. If I exchange for God Crystals instead, I would probably have enough to upgrade Fragmented Legendary Equipment to Legendary rank already. Shi Feng hesitated over the Scorching Eye. There was no way he could acquire more Merit Points within a short period. After all, there was no second Evil God Envoy waiting for him to catch. Meanwhile, the Scorching Eye was the cheapest of the four Divine Power Sources available for exchange. The others cost around 80,000 points. If he chose to exchange for enough God Crystals to upgrade a piece of Fragmented Legendary Equipment, he wouldn’t be able to afford any Divine Power Sources at all. Finally, Shi Feng gritted his teeth and said, “I’ll exchange for the Scorching Eye and four God Crystals!” “Please wait for a moment,” the receptionist in front of Shi Feng said, smiling before leaving to find the items he chose.

Some time later, the Scorching Eye and four God Crystals entered his hands. Simultaneously, the Merit Points he had also plummeted.

However, Shi Feng did not regret his decision. Based on how few Divine Power Sources the War God’s Temple owned, he could tell that these items were incredibly rare and precious. Obtaining even one Divine Power Source in the outside world would already be close to impossible, let alone two.

God Crystals, though, were a different story. While God Crystals might be rare, Shi Feng still had ways to obtain them.

I wonder how much the Light of Two Worlds will improve? Looking at the fist-sized Scorching Eye in his hand, Shi Feng drew the Light of Two Worlds.

System: Divine Power Source detected. Do you wish to let the Light of Two Worlds absorb it?

“Absorb!”
