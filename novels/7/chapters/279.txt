Chapter 280 - Zero Wing Residence

Currently, the interior of the Adventurer’s Association of White River City was filled with players coming and going. Most of these players were here to accept or hand in their Daily Quests.

However, there were insufficient NPCs to cater to the large number of players. As a result, these players usually needed to wait in the lounge for a period of time before they could accept or turn in their quests.

Having nothing better to do inside the lounge, some Guild players started ordering alcohol and holding a discussion among themselves.

“Zero Wing is getting worse by the day! If I had known this would happen earlier, I would have definitely joined some other large Guild to develop myself! Perhaps I might have already become the leader of a party by now! Brother Hui, as expected, you are still the smarter and wiser one! You joined Dark Star from the very start, and now, you’ve already become the vice-leader of a 15-man team! Now that I have left Zero Wing, I will be relying on Brother Hui’s guidance from now on!” A Shield Warrior with tanned skin flattered the robust-looking Berserker sitting beside him.

“No problem! With me around, you will definitely have no problem joining the Guild!” the Berserker assured him, clapping his chest. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Meanwhile, sitting beside this Berserker addressed as Brother Hui was a pretty female mage. Although her face looked average, she had an excellent figure. Coquettishly fluttering her eyelashes, the female mage looked at the person known as Brother Hui, sweetly saying, “Big Brother Hui, I’ve been wanting to go to the Level 15 Wind Ridge. When will you take me there?”

Wind Ridge was a Level 15, 20-man Team Dungeon. Among Level 15 Team Dungeons, Wind Ridge had a below-average difficulty. However, to average players at this stage of the game, even a Level 15, 10-man Team Dungeon was a great challenge, not to mention a 20-man Dungeon like Wind Ridge.

“Of course, of course! Isn’t it just Wind Ridge? You’re already my woman now, how could you settle for only a meager Wind Ridge? Tomorrow, I’ll call up my men and bring you to the Demon’s Castle!” The Berserker wrapped his arm around the female mage’s willowy waist, a nasty grin on his face.

Many onlookers grew envious at this scene. They could not help but wish that they, too, could join Dark Star and getting a beauty for themselves as well.

“Brother Hui, I hear that the Demon’s Castle has a very high difficulty. Don’t tell me you’ve already managed to obtain the raid strategy from Zero Wing’s main force?” the tanned Shield Warrior asked curiously.

“Indeed, we’ve managed to obtain the strategy already. However, even without it, with Dark Star’s strength, we could still easily conquer the Demon’s Castle. The main reason we haven’t done so is simply because of the competition we’re having with Ouroboros. Otherwise, Zero Wing would not have had the chance to take the limelight as they did before. Look, isn’t Zero Wing in shambles now? They’re simply a little faster in terms of leveling up. They haven’t even cleared the Normal Mode of any of the Three Great Dungeons yet. Dark Star, on the other hand, has already killed the second Boss of Hard Mode and started trying to raid the third Boss. We have already caught up with Ouroboros. It is only a matter of time before we surpass Ouroboros. I really don’t know what qualifications Zero Wing possesses to be considered as one of the top six Guilds in White River City.” The Berserker’s loud voice was filled with disdain as he spoke of Zero Wing.

“Even though the Guild clearly has no future, there is still more than half the original number of players remaining in it. It really makes you wonder just what is going through those people’s minds.”

“They’re just fools.”

“Brother Hui, you’re right! I really regret listening to my friend’s words about joining Zero Wing back then.” The Shield Warrior nodded his head in agreement, his heart filled with great disappointment. If he had joined Dark Star early on, he might also have had a beauty accompanying him by now.

Meanwhile, seated near this trio, Shi Feng was currently quietly browsing through information on the official forums.

Naturally, he could clearly hear the loud conversation between the robust Berserker and the skinny Shield Warrior, and the same went for everyone else waiting inside the lounge.

However, Shi Feng made no comment on their mocking words. After all, everyone had the freedom to make their own decisions.

As for the Shield Warrior’s regret at joining Zero Wing?

Shi Feng simply revealed a calm smile.

If this Shield Warrior knew that Zero Wing was about to establish their very own Guild Residence, just what sort of emotions would he have?

At that time, even the words “earth-shattering” would not be enough to describe the amount of shock he would feel.

However, Shi Feng really could not be blamed for this...

Soon after, Shi Feng headed to the counter and dealt with all the necessary procedures. After he turned his private territory into a Guild Residence, he also spent 3,000 Gold to build an Advanced Guild Hall in place of the Purple Sun Mansion. The Advanced Guild Hall could fit up to 3,000 people. As for the other facilities of the Guild Residence, those would only be obtainable from large-scale Team Dungeons that were Level 25 or above.

Some time was needed before the construction of the Advanced Guild Hall could be completed.

After Shi Feng completed all the necessary procedures, his remaining task was to head to the War God’s Temple and report the matter of the Endless Abyss.

Just as Shi Feng was about to leave the Adventurer’s Association, the system notification sounded.

Moreover, this wasn’t just any normal notification. Instead, it was a notification sent to the entire Star-Moon Kingdom.

Star-Moon Kingdom System Announcement: Congratulations to Zero Wing for becoming the first Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom to establish a Guild Residence! Rewarding 10,000 Guild Reputation, 10,000 Guild Popularity and 10 Gold Coins to the Guild.

“I spent 3,000 Gold, yet only got 10 Gold in return. The System sure is tightfisted.” Shi Feng laughed.

However, Shi Feng did not concern himself with such an amount of Gold.

The reason being, in these past few days, the Starstreak Trading Firm was already making a daily profit of over 1,700 Gold. It was all thanks to the popularity it gained from selling the Arclight Shield, as well as the Basic Mana Armor Kits. During this period of time, the forging genius, Cream Cocoa, had also been continuously producing Gemstone Buckles, Advanced Whetstones, and many more forging products.

Moreover, the number of forging players Melancholic Smile recruited was also rising. Not only did the combination of these new forgers and the various Forging Designs provided by Zero Wing increase the number of products sold by the Starstreak Trading Firm, it also expanded the company’s product selection. As a result, the daily profits of the Starstreak Trading Firm continuously rose.

Currently, the Starstreak Trading Firm already controlled over half of the market for forging products in White River City. Moreover, such a situation wasn’t limited to just White River City; it extended to the seven surrounding cities.

Hence, Shi Feng was not lacking in money at all.

Compared to having spent 3,000 Gold Coins, Shi Feng was more interested in the 10,000 Guild Popularity points. This was a feature that would only become available to a Guild after it established a Guild Residence. The higher the Guild Popularity, the more famous a Guild would become among NPCs. With 10,000 Guild Popularity, Zero Wing could be considered relatively famous among the NPC populace. Compared to starting from scratch, having this 10,000 Guild Popularity made things much simpler for him.

It should be known that, when a Guild member completed a quest commissioned by an NPC, the Guild would normally receive only one to three Guild Popularity. Only quests with high difficulty would reward five to ten points. In other words, a Guild needed to complete thousands of Guild Quests in order to accumulate 10,000 Guild Popularity.

These bonus Guild Popularity points had saved the Guild plenty of development time.

Meanwhile, inside the lounge of the Adventurer’s Association, the tanned Shield Warrior that had just recently left Zero Wing no longer felt joyful about joining Dark Star. On the contrary, his face was as pale as a sheet of paper.

Inside the Land of Death, one of the Three Great Dungeons...

Dark Star’s main team was currently battling against a White-bone Giant Elephant, which was over 20 meters in height.

At this time, the MT of the team, Lone Tyrant, was enduring the attacks from this White-bone Giant Elephant. Every time he took an attack from the Boss, he would receive over -2,000 damage. His HP constantly rose and fell, his life hanging by a thread.

Just as the White-bone Giant Elephant in the distance was preparing to charge, Lone Tyrant suddenly received a system notification.

Lone Tyrant was momentarily stunned by what he saw.

“How did Zero Wing obtain a Guild Residence so quickly?!” Lone Tyrant couldn’t help but yell out when he saw the description of this system notification, his eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. He even forgot to use a skill to block the incoming attack from the White-bone Giant Elephant before him.

As a result, he was turned into a pile of meat paste by the Boss’s foot, losing his life instantly.

What followed was what would be expected: a team-wipe...
