Chapter 3791 - 865 - Remnants of a Primordial World

In a valley shrouded in white fog, a 20-man team fought a Level 235, Tier 6 Shadow Ape.

[Shadow Ape] (Shadow Creature, Divine)
Level 235
HP 30,000,000,000,000,000

The Shadow Ape was over 100 meters tall. Yet, it could do nothing to the Level 235 Demidragon Guardian Knight before it.

The Demidragon Guardian Knight in question wielded a crimson war hammer in one hand and a dragonscale shield in the other. Although the Shadow Ape bombarded him with a flurry of punches using its six arms, he easily blocked the attacks with his shield. He would also use the force of the Shadow Ape’s punches to propel him toward its ankles and attack with his war hammer from time to time, causing it to stagger and lose over 100 billion HP.

The Guardian Knight’s teammates were equally excellent. They were all at Level 233 or above, and each of their Skills dealt over 100 billion damage to the Shadow Ape, while their normal attacks caused 30 to 40 billion damage.

“Everyone, keep it up! Also, be careful of the Shadow Ape going berserk! It doesn’t have much HP left!” Whirlwind Bulwark, the Demidragon Guardian Knight, commanded while tanking the Shadow Ape’s attacks.

“Relax, Commander. It’s not our first time killing this Shadow Ape,” a Level 234 Cleric said jokingly as she healed Whirlwind Bulwark. “Even if it goes berserk, we can still dodge its attacks with our eyes closed.”

Everyone else nodded in agreement, their expressions looking relaxed.

Subsequently, when the Shadow Ape’s HP fell to 30%, its skin turned crimson, its size doubled, and its Attack Speed increased significantly. Shadow spears also started to rain from the sky, covering a 1,000-yard radius around the Shadow Ape.

Seeing this, Whirlwind Bulwark let out a low shout as he activated the Tier 6 Skill Guardian Angel. Immediately, numerous translucent holy barriers formed above him and his team, shielding them from the falling shadow spears.

Even though the shadow spears the Shadow Ape summoned had greatly increased in number and speed after it went berserk, they still couldn’t break through the holy barriers. At most, they caused Whirlwind Bulwark to lose some HP as they bombarded his holy barriers. However, this damage was quickly neutralized when the team’s Cleric cast her Tier 6 Spell Aurora Healing, which healed Whirlwind Bulwark and everyone else on the team for 5% of their HP every second.

As such, the Shadow Ape going berserk changed nothing. Its HP still fell rapidly over time.

30%… 20%… 15%…

When the Shadow Ape’s HP fell below 1%, an icy longsword suddenly appeared from a distance and plunged into its body like a meteorite, instantly devouring the rest of its HP. Then, the Shadow Ape fell, and items appeared all over its corpse.

This turn of events surprised Whirlwind Bulwark and his team, and they immediately turned to where the icy longsword came from.

A 100-man team had emerged from the mist, taking them unawares. The elegant female Mage God walking in the lead was holding up a Tier 6 Curse Scroll.

“What is the meaning of this, Fira?” Whirlwind Bulwark demanded, looking livid.

“Kill-stealing, naturally. Isn’t it obvious enough?” Fira, the female Mage God, said with a faint smile. “Also, have you forgotten my Guild Leader’s warning? While you might have his admiration, that doesn’t excuse you from paying your protection fees.”

“We’ve already said Pale Horn won’t be getting involved in your war with the Holy Knights! Also, we’ve already paid the White Dragon Nation’s protection fees for this month! It’s only been a few days since then, yet you want us to pay you again? Don’t you think you’re being excessive?” Star Butterfly, the female Cleric behind Whirlwind Bulwark, protested angrily in response to Fira’s words.

“Excessive?” Fira scoffed. “I don’t think so. On the contrary, I think you should be honored. So long as the White Dragon Nation wins, Pale Horn will face fewer troubles in Nightmare Holy City. Not to mention, my Guild Leader has already promised that so long as Pale Horn kills a hundred members of the Holy Knights, the White Dragon Nation will stop troubling you in the future. You won’t even need to pay any protection fees.

“Of course, if you refuse to comply, we will simply have you disappear from Nightmare Holy City.”

“You… How can you do this?!” Star Butterfly shouted in frustration.

The White Dragon Nation was one of the two strongest Guilds operating in Nightmare Holy City, and it had many experts under its wing. If it decided to target the Pale Horn adventurer team, the outcome was obvious.

“Bulwark, this is your last chance, so think carefully. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee what will happen to you all today,” Fira said, smiling.

Meanwhile, Star Butterfly and the other members of Pale Horn turned gloomy when they heard this.

Leaving Nightmare Holy City was out of the question. After all, it was one of the few safe havens for human players. However, although they considered themselves strong, the White Dragon Nation’s experts far outnumbered them. If the White Dragon Nation kept harassing them out in the fields, it would only be a matter of time before they got worn out and killed.

“Aren’t you afraid that I will join the Holy Knights?” Whirlwind Bulwark asked coldly.

One of the two strongest Guilds operating in Nightmare Holy City was the White Dragon Nation; the other was the Holy Knights. It was also because these two Guilds were fighting for control over Nightmare Holy City that the situation in the city had become the way it was.

“You can do that, but it’ll depend on whether you can walk out of here alive,” Fira said as she raised her hand. Immediately, a crimson scroll inscribed with divine runes appeared in her hand, emanating an oppressive aura that made everyone present shudder.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, more White Dragon Nation members suddenly appeared in the surroundings, their numbers exceeding 200. These players had previously been hidden under the effects of a Group Invisibility Scroll, and they now surrounded Whirlwind Bulwark’s team.

However, rather than these players, Whirlwind Bulwark was more concerned about the scroll in Fira’s hand.

“How generous of the White Dragon Nation to take out a Divine Soul Curse for us,” Whirlwind Bulwark said as he eyed the crimson scroll solemnly.

The Divine Soul Curse was a special type of Magic Scroll. Although it lacked any offensive capabilities, it could forcibly bind with the souls of targeted players. Should the bound players get injured or die, they would permanently lose a portion of their souls. Normally, the Divine Soul Curse would only be used against VIPs of hostile powers or an army of tens of thousands.

“My Guild Leader just wants you to think carefully,” Fira said as she played with the scroll in her hand. “Well? Which side will you choose?”

Before Whirlwind Bulwark could respond, a crack stretching dozens of kilometers suddenly appeared in the foggy sky. Then, streaks of white light shot out of the crack and landed between the Pale Horn adventurer team and the White Dragon Nation.

…

Is this the God Mode Underground City World? Shi Feng wondered as he scanned his surroundings, taking note of the unfamiliar players around him and their shocked expressions.

Although Shi Feng had never been to or heard of the God Mode Underground City World in his previous life, he didn’t find it too strange to meet other players here. Any place in God’s Domain labeled a “world” had the possibility of housing players. Even an Underground City World was no exception.

However, what surprised Shi Feng was that these players all had very high levels. They were all at least Level 230; many were even at Level 235 or above. If these players were in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, they would be among the highest-level players.

System: Congratulations! You have discovered the remnants of a primordial world. World Suppression will be greatly increased. Taboo Restriction on players will be lifted.

“Who are you people?! How dare you stand in the way of the White Dragon Nation?!” Fira demanded coldly as she glared at Shi Feng’s party.
