Chapter 2884 – Ruthless Shi Feng

Fenglin City, Zero Wing’s headquarters: Shi Feng stood in front of Zero Wing’s headquarters. The place had undergone significant changes since his last visit.

Currently, people crowded the plaza in front of the building, many of them young men and women. These people were either waiting to enter the building or taking various tests out in the plaza. This prosperous sight was even more spectacular than what could be found at the various Super Guilds’ headquarters.

As Shi Feng made his way to the entrance, he overheard these young men and women discussing Zero Wing’s matters. As they spoke about Zero Wing City’s training environment or the heaven-defying battle that had taken place at Ancient Rock City, their eyes glowed with anticipation.

Before Shi Feng could reach the entrance, a long-haired man in his thirties approached him.

Looking at Shi Feng, who was clad in sportswear, the long-haired man said in a friendly tone, “Friend, you’re here to join Zero Wing, right?”

“Me? Join Zero Wing?” Shi Feng was stunned by the long-haired man’s words.

Although the long-haired man looked ordinary, Shi Feng sensed intense lifeforce from him. In terms of physical fitness, the long-haired man could practically rival Henglian masters. However, before Shi Feng could say anything, the long-haired man unzipped his jacket and revealed a six-winged emblem pinned on his T-shirt, proving that he was an internal member of Zero Wing.

“I can tell that you’re extraordinary at a glance, Brother,” the long-haired man said while showing off his emblem. He then pointed at the long line of people waiting to enter the building and grinned, saying, “Look at how long that line is. If you grab a ticket and join the line now, it’ll take you forever before your turn arrives. However, I’m an internal member of Zero Wing. I have a recommendation slot that lets me help one person bypass the initial test.”

“What are you trying to say?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

“I can see that you’re extraordinary, so I plan to recommend you to the Guild. However, once you become an internal member of Zero Wing, you’ll need to join my team. What do you think?” Looking at Shi Feng with a serious look, the long-haired man said earnestly, “The team I belong to is extraordinary. Although it was established only recently, it has become a second-line team already! It’s only one line behind the main force!”

Shi Feng was at a loss for words.

He never imagined such competition existed between Zero Wing’s various teams.

If he weren’t Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, he would’ve most likely been tempted by the long-haired man’s words already.

After all, apart from Zero Wing’s main force, any other team that had a Tier 4 player leading it would be considered a second-line team. Meanwhile, all second-line teams could raid Level 150, 100-man Hard Mode Team Dungeons.

“What? You don’t believe me?” Upon seeing Shi Feng’s startled expression, the long-haired man said delightedly, “Do you know who my team leader is? You’ll get a fright if I tell you!”

Just when Shi Feng wondered who this strange man’s team leader was, the sounds of fighting came from inside the lobby. The din was like a sledgehammer pounding the ground. However, neither the long-haired man nor the other Zero Wing members present showed any concern over these loud sounds, appearing wholly accustomed to them. The newcomers, though, all expressed curiosity and tried sneaking peeks into the lobby. “Ignore that. It’s nothing to fuss about,” the long-haired man said when he saw the curiosity on Shi Feng’s face. He then added nonchalantly, “It’s just the experts of another superpower coming to provoke Zero Wing. I believe Master Lei Bao will take care of them in a moment.”

Shi Feng asked, “Have there been a lot of such situations happening in Zero Wing lately?” “It’s been like this since before I joined. However, it’s become much more frequent recently,” the long-haired man said as he nodded in frustration. “These superpowers can’t bear to see Zero Wing developing. However, as they can’t do anything to us in God’s Domain, they keep coming to our headquarters to make trouble. They keep asking us to sell them Zero Wing City’s Lands. I heard that the group that came here this time consists of six superpowers, one of them the Super Guild Mythology. “Mythology’s group is even led by the Fang family’s young lady. That Fang Shihan really is something. Not only is she beautiful, but she’s also frighteningly strong. She can take down master-level experts in practically one hit. I’m afraid only our Big Sis Fire Dance can take her on.”

The long-haired man shuddered when he spoke of Fang Shihan. It was evident he feared the latter greatly.

After the long-haired man finished speaking, the lobby’s door opened abruptly, and a group of people stalked out of the building. These people were representatives of superpowers, and they currently had angry expressions. However, when they looked at Fire Dance and Lei Bao, who walked out of the building shortly after them, and then looked at the injured master-level experts and one half-step neutralizing grandmaster beside them, they dared not do anything.

“Just you wait! Don’t think that, just because we are helpless against you in God’s Domain, you’ll be invincible in the real world as well!”

“Zero Wing will only encounter more trouble for refusing to cooperate with us!”

The various superpowers’ representatives barked arrogantly at Fire Dance and Lei Bao, their voices growing complacent as they spoke.

While master-level experts might be powerless against Zero Wing, there were bound to be superpowers capable of inviting grandmaster-level experts to move for them. The corporations operating within the Upper Zone might even take action. After all, Zero Wing was too large a cake to pass on.

According to the information the various superpowers had gathered, some forces based in the Upper Zone were already investigating Zero Wing, evidently interested in the Guild. Hence, it was only a matter of time before grandmaster-level experts came to find trouble with Zero Wing.

Fire Dance and Lei Bao revealed somewhat grim expressions on their faces when they heard the representatives’ words. They had expected the battle at Ancient Rock City to have caught the attention of many organizations in the Upper Zone. Hence, they were certain that grandmaster-level experts would eventually come to Zero Wing seeking trouble.

While these grandmasters might not be capable of doing anything against Zero Wing on the surface, if they came every day to pick a fight, it would ruin Zero Wing’s reputation, not to mention the other unscrupulous tactics they could employ.

However, when the various superpowers’ representatives were getting full of themselves, Fang Shihan suddenly left the group and headed toward Shi Feng. The cold gaze she directed at him made the temperature in the surroundings fall by more than ten degrees; the long-haired man standing beside Shi Feng shuddered in fear despite himself.

Looking at Shi Feng, the long-haired man asked, “Friend, did you offend her in some way before? Why do I get the feeling that she’s coming for you?”

In this situation, the nearby young men also looked at Shi Feng and began a quiet discussion. They all wondered who Shi Feng was to warrant such attention from a great beauty like Fang Shihan.

“I don’t think I’ve done anything to her,” Shi Feng said. He likewise found it strange that Fang Shihan was walking to him. After giving the matter some thought, he added, “The only things I remember doing are killing one of her elders and telling her to get lost. I don’t think I’ve ever done anything else to her.”

Shi Feng’s words stupefied the long-haired man. He never thought that Shi Feng would be so ruthless as to pull such stunts with the Fang family’s lady. It would be strange if Fang Shihan didn’t try to take Shi Feng’s life. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

However, when Fang Shihan arrived in front of Shi Feng, she looked at him and asked quietly, “Can I speak with you in private?”

Immediately, be it the long-haired man or the other men present, they all couldn’t help staring at Shi Feng with wide eyes.

What was going on here?
