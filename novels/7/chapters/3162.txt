Chapter 237 – Epic Expansion Pack

Boom! Boom! Boom!

When the stars made of sword lights clashed with Diaclo’s Rain of Stars, the space above the plaza shattered and transformed into a dark void. The resulting shockwaves of the clash caused even the players standing outside the plaza to stumble backward, and only God-ranked experts managed to keep their bodies steady.

After the clash continued for around ten seconds, the illumination in the entire second underground level dimmed as if night had descended on the area.

“Is that guy really just a Tier 3 player?”

Many of the players standing outside the plaza couldn’t help but doubt their eyes when they saw the lone figure standing steadily in mid-air. This was especially so when they also noticed that the other players in the plaza had lost a portion of their HPs to the shockwaves alone.

This was a Tier 5 Destruction Spell cast by a Tier 5 monster they were talking about. Yet, Shi Feng had stopped it completely. This accomplishment was enough to put him on par with the Greater God’s Domain’s legendary individuals.

It should be known that these legendary individuals were experts that even the Greater God’s Domain’s hegemonic powers feared greatly. Every one of these individuals stood at the Greater God’s Domain’s apex. They also wielded great authority in the Greater World.

How is this possible?!

At this moment, Death Omen similarly looked at Shi Feng in disbelief.

Death Omen might be a God-ranked expert, but as one of the Flower of Seven Sins’ seven commanders, she was well aware that there were significant differences even between God-ranked experts. The gap could be as big as the difference between a human and a dog or possibly even more.

This was why she had chosen to go under Supreme Sky, the Sin of Greed’s commander.

In the eyes of the average person, the various international corporations and the Five Great Super Guilds of their world might be unreachable and insurmountable existences.

However, Death Omen knew that be it the various international corporations or the Five Great Super Guilds, they were still nothing but ants in the Greater World. At most, they’d be slightly bigger-sized ants.

Meanwhile, it was only a matter of time before their world merged with the Greater World. If she wished to have a better chance at surviving and thriving in the Greater World, her best bet would be to go under the wing of someone strong like Supreme Sky. After all, competition in the Greater World was much more intense than in their world. Only experts like Supreme Sky were sufficiently strong to be treated well in the Greater World. As for weaker God-ranked experts, they could, at most, earn enough to get by if they couldn’t find a strong backer to rely on. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Hence, when Death Omen initially learned that Hidden Soul had chosen to join the Asura Mercenary Alliance and rely on some unknown Outerworld expert named Black Flame, she couldn’t help but find the decision laughable and foolish.

But now…

The unknown Outerworld expert she had previously looked down on was not only single-handedly pinning down a Tier 5 Nether King, but he had also stopped a Tier 5 Destruction Spell completely. Meanwhile, he had accomplished all that while being only at Tier 3. With such strength, so long as Black Flame successfully reached Tier 6, even the Greater World’s top-tier corporations would treat him as a VIP.

…

He stopped everything?

Flanders was greatly surprised when he saw that the various teams had hardly suffered any casualties. At the same time, a hint of awe appeared in his eyes as he looked at Shi Feng.

Previously, Flanders had been of the opinion that Shi Feng’s only partnership value lay in his ability to bring players out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm. However, after seeing Shi Feng’s performance against Diaclo, Flanders realized that Shi Feng’s value was much higher than he expected.

“Don’t get too excited yet. I can only stop Diaclo for a limited amount of time, so you need to defeat the Boss as quickly as possible,” Shi Feng hurriedly said when he swept his gaze across the plaza and saw the excited looks on everyone’s faces. “If you still have any trump cards saved up, you’d best use them now. Otherwise, none of us will be leaving this place alive!”

Everyone might think he had stopped Diaclo’s attack with relative ease, but he was well aware of how much Stamina he had exhausted just to stop the Nether King’s Rain of Stars. Not to mention, he had used Abyssal Power to stop the Tier 5 Spell.

Abyssal Power only had a three-minute duration. Once these three minutes were up, he could no longer block Tier 5 Skills and Spells even if he executed Sword’s Orbit.

It seems we cannot continue saving our strength.?Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Flanders promptly suppressed his excitement and said to his team, “Use all of the Tier 4 Magic Scrolls we prepared! Everyone who has Berserk Skills left unused, use them now! We must kill the Boss before Black Flame reaches his limit!”

Following Flanders’ command, the Tower Alliance’s members activated their Berserk Skills one after another. They also took out the Tier 4 Magic Scrolls in their possession and began bombarding the Nether King with Tier 4 attacks. As for the several dozen teams in the plaza, they similarly used their Berserk Skills and precious tools.

For a time, over a thousand Tier 4 Magic Scrolls and several thousand precious tools were being used as if they cost nothing. Then, attacks at the Tier 4 caliber bombarded Diaclo one after another, each attack reaping over ten million of the Nether King’s HP.

The Asura Mercenary Alliance’s members were dumbfounded when they saw this scene. Tier 4 Magic Scrolls were typically treated as strategic items by the various superpowers, and the average superpower would, at most, have around one hundred Tier 4 Magic Scrolls in their reserves. Yet, now, Tier 4 Magic Scrolls were being used like they were Tier 3 Magic Scrolls.

Seeing over a thousand Tier 4 Magic Scrolls being used, even the several great alliances outside the plaza couldn’t help but wince in pain. Not even the Five Great Super Guilds would dare to waste so many Tier 4 Magic Scrolls for a single raid. This was an act only superpowers from the Desolate Star God’s Domain, which was a God’s Domain superior to theirs, would dare to do.

Diaclo’s HP had fallen to 5% in less than two minutes. Although the Nether King had cast Tier 5 Spells one after another throughout this period, Shi Feng had blocked every one of its attacks with Sword’s Orbit.

However, Shi Feng’s complexion would also turn slightly paler with every Tier 5 Spell he blocked.

“Quick! Only 5% to go!”

When Flanders saw Shi Feng’s pale-white complexion and more and more experts getting killed by the residual power of Diaclo’s Tier 5 Spells, he knew that they were now in the final length of their race against time. Hence, he began executing Silver Combat Techniques against the Nether King one after another, completely disregarding the massive toll he placed on his Stamina and Concentration.

5%... 3%... 1%...

Unfortunately, before the various teams could bring down Diaclo, Shi Feng succumbed to his exhaustion and powerlessly fell out of the air. To make matters worse, the Nether King had seemingly been waiting for this opportunity as it promptly started casting another Rain of Stars…

Just when everyone had fallen into despair, Frey, who had been passively recovering in the middle of the plaza all this time, suddenly raised the staff in her hands.

“Wither away! Soul Flower!”

Immediately, translucent vines appeared from the void and wrapped around Diaclo, the thorns that covered the vines causing the Nether King’s HP to plummet until nothing remained. This situation caught everyone off guard as nobody expected Frey to still have the strength to execute such a powerful attack.

Only, after using this move, Frey became so weak that she had to rely on her staff to stay standing.

Meanwhile, along with Diaclo’s death, a series of system notifications suddenly rang in everyone’s ears.
