Chapter 238 – Greater Era’s Arrival?

“An Epic Expansion Pack?”

“The update is going to last for two days? What kind of expansion pack is this?”

“Hm? There seems to be a general introduction from the system!”

Before the players in the plaza could celebrate their success in bringing down the Nether King, they were stunned by the abrupt announcement of the Epic Expansion Pack. The information was so shocking that nobody even noticed they had all leveled up from the raid.

…

System: Once the Epic Expansion Pack “Myriad Worlds’ Descent” activates, the Miniature Ancient World’s various NPC Cities will be open to the Realm to which the Miniature Ancient World belongs. All players under Level 120 from the Realm will have one opportunity to enter the Miniature Ancient World. The World Wall in the Miniature Ancient World will no longer prevent teleportation between the cities of the two domains.

System: Ten natural days after the activation of the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack, the Top of Two Worlds’ teleportation will open in the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level. All players at Level 115 or above can teleport to the Top of Two Worlds using this teleportation gate and explore the Level 120-plus maps there.

Although the system’s text introduction only consisted of a few sentences, every player present couldn’t help but feel surprised and shocked after reading it. Even Shi Feng fell into a daze after reading the introduction.

The merger got brought forward??

A frown formed on Shi Feng’s face as he looked at the system notifications.

Shi Feng knew that it was only a matter of time before the two God’s Domains connected to this Miniature Ancient World would start interacting with each other. However, what he did not expect was for it to happen so soon and on a much larger scale.

This was no longer something as simple as the players of two God’s Domains clashing. Instead, the scale of the conflict would be extended to cover the God’s Domains of an entire Realm. The danger ahead for their God’s Domain would likely be far greater than his initial expectations.

There were many Realms in the Greater God’s Domain. Meanwhile, each Realm was home to at least a thousand God’s Domains.

The Realm God’s Domain belonged to was the Starlight Realm. According to the information he gathered during his previous life, there were 1,654 God’s Domains in the Starlight Realm. Based on their size and average player standard, these God’s Domains could be categorized into three groups: Elementary, Intermediate, and Higher.

Meanwhile, the Starlight Realm had 1,549 Elementary God’s Domains, 97 Intermediate God’s Domains, and 8 Higher God’s Domains.

In the case of the Desolate Star God’s Domain, it could only be considered an Intermediate God’s Domain if going solely by its player standards. It would even be ranked near the bottom of Intermediate God’s Domains, and there were at least 100 God’s Domains in the Starlight Realm that were stronger than the Desolate Star God’s Domain. After all, many Elementary God’s Domains had average player standards superior to Intermediate God’s Domains.

Meanwhile, not only did the Miniature Ancient World possess Legacies left behind by Ancient Gods, but it also contained the possessions of Ancient Gods. The Miniature Ancient World itself was also quite wealthy in resources. So, the Miniature Ancient World was a considerably tempting treasure trove even to the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers.

Originally, the struggle for the Miniature Ancient World only involved two God’s Domains. Even if the Desolate Star God’s Domain was an open God’s Domain, players from other God’s Domains would first need to gain the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s permission before they could enter the Miniature Ancient World. Otherwise, they’d be annihilated by the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s native powers before they could event each the Miniature Ancient World.

However, once the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack took effect, the Starlight Realm’s various God’s Domain would no longer have to go through the Desolate Star God’s Domain to enter the Miniature Ancient World.

At that time, the number of players and powers flooding into the Miniature Ancient World would be simply unimaginable…

Right now, Shi Feng even started to doubt whether their God’s Domain’s mighty superpowers could survive the Myriad Worlds’ Descent.

“Crazy! This is crazy!”

“How did things turn out like this?”

When Thousand Swords and the others saw the system notifications, their expressions turned incredibly somber.

While it was great that they would have more opportunities to interact with the powers of other God’s Domain, having the powers of so many God’s Domain flood into the Miniature Ancient World was not good news. Instead, it was a nightmare.

The Miniature Ancient World had limited space and NPC Cities. At best, it could only accommodate the players of three or four God’s Domains, not a thousand or more. If players from so many God’s Domains flooded into the Miniature Ancient World?

Even a fool could tell that competition would shoot through the roof. At that time, players and powers wouldn’t just be competing for monsters and resources. They’d also have to compete frantically for living space. Weaklings might not even be able to continue surviving in the Miniature Ancient World…

While everyone was shocked by the news of the Epic Expansion Pack, Frey was the only one who had happily walked up to the Nether King’s loot. She didn’t care about the Miniature Ancient World’s Epic Expansion Pack in the slightest. The only thing in her eyes were the dozen or so items the Nether King dropped.

“Sure enough, it’s here.”

A happy smile appeared on Frey’s face when she saw a gray, withered seed among the dropped items. Immediately, she walked up to the withered seed, picked it up, and put it into her spatial bag. Throughout this process, she didn’t spare any of the items a single glance even though every one of them radiated dense Mana.

“You all did a good job this time. I will transfer all the promised compensation to your God’s Domain Accounts afterward. For those without a God’s Domain Account, you can contact the Tower Alliance, and they will resolve this problem for you,” Frey said as she looked at the several hundred players that remained in the plaza. Then, she turned to Shi Feng, who was barely keeping himself standing, and continued, “I will be taking this seed as per our agreement. You can have the rest of the loot. Consider it the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s bonus compensation. As for the five million Star Coins, if you do not have a way to accept it, Flanders will help you solve it.”

After saying so, Frey seemingly didn’t wish to spend even a moment longer in the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level as she took out a Tier 5 Teleportation Scroll and activated it.

A Tier 5 Teleportation Scroll was an item that even superpowers wouldn’t dare dream of owning. Yet, Frey had used it without hesitation. Moreover, she didn’t even use it to get herself out of a precarious situation. Instead, she used it simply to save herself some travel time.

However, none of the Desolate Star God’s Domain’s players were surprised by Frey’s extravagant behavior. On the contrary, they even felt it was an action befitting Frey. After all, Frey was the Galaxy Corporation’s Fourth Princess. With her position’s importance, she’d use even a Tier 6 Teleportation Scroll without hesitation as long as she could save time.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng didn’t know what to say when he saw Frey’s prodigal behavior. He felt that only someone like the Galaxy Corporation’s heiress could treat something as precious as a Tier 5 Teleportation Scroll so nonchalantly.

“What should we do next, Guild Leader?” Su Qianliu quietly asked as she looked at Shi Feng.

She was no longer the ignorant executive of a third-rate power anymore. After her trip to the Stratified Abyssal Realm, she more or less knew what a Realm was. Hence, she knew that the Epic Expansion Pack’s name of Myriad Worlds’ Descent truly meant the descent of a myriad of worlds into the Miniature Ancient World...

“Everyone’s tired. Don’t think about anything for now and just go offline and rest,” Shi Feng said when he saw the anxiety on the faces of Su Qianliu and the others. “We’ll talk about future matters after we come back online.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Everyone nodded and followed Shi Feng’s instructions, choosing to log out of the game and rest.

As for Shi Feng, he stuffed the Nether King’s loot into his spatial bag before similarly logging out of the game. After having used Sword’s Orbit so many times in a row, he was having trouble even staying conscious right now. So, he naturally wasn’t in the mood to inspect the loot or care about anything else.

However, although Shi Feng wasn’t in the mood to consider the new expansion pack, it was a different story for the rest of the Miniature Ancient World and the main continent. The Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack’s announcement quickly sparked a huge uproar...
