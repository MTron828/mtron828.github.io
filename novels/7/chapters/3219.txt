Chapter 294 – Top Adventurer

…

“Guild Leader Black Flame?”

When Shi Feng discovered Wu Xiaoxiao, Wu Xiaoxiao also noticed Shi Feng, shock and confusion appearing in her eyes.

However, Wu Xiaoxiao quickly recovered from her surprise and resumed running at full speed. Despite being an Elementalist, Wu Xiaoxiao managed to not only evade one of the Three-tailed Blaze Wolves that had lunged at her, but she also managed to widen the gap between them to over 30 yards in only an instant. Her movements were incredibly swift and natural, and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that she was already close to rivaling Domain Realm experts.

Moreover, if one were to inspect Wu Xiaoxiao with an Identification Skill, one would realize that Wu Xiaoxiao was no longer a Tier 3 Great Mage but a genuine level 127, Tier 4 Great Wizard instead. She also wore quite a few pieces of Dark-Gold Immortal Equipment, and the staff she wielded was even a Fragmented Legendary Staff.

At the same time as Wu Xiaoxiao was pulling away from the Three-tailed Blaze Wolves chasing after her, another Blaze Wolf emerged from the distant grassland. However, unlike the previous ones, this one was seven meters tall and had six tails. When it emerged from the tall grass, it glared at Wu Xiaoxiao with its crimson eyes, the flames coming out of its mouth causing the surrounding area to become scorching hot.

[Six-tailed Blaze Wolf Chief (Realm Lord)] (Demonic Beast, Mythic)

Level 130

HP 7,000,000,000

…

The Blaze Wolf Chief was a Mythic ranked Realm Lord. While it might not be comparable to Superior Mythic monsters of the same level, it wasn’t an opponent that Tier 4 players could go up against alone in the Greater God’s Domain. Typically, a party of six Tier 4 players would be needed to raid such a monster.

However, before the Blaze Wolf Chief could take further action, two twofold magic arrays suddenly appeared under its feet. Subsequently, ice vines emerged from the ground and restrained the Blaze Wolf Chief while lightning bolts descended from the sky.

Tier 4 Barrier Spell, Ice Prison!

Tier 4 Curse, Lightning Waterfall!

“Nicely done, Xiaoxiao! This Blaze Wolf Chief is done for now!”

After the two Spells took effect, a Level 129, Tier 4 female Great Wizard emerged from a patch of grass near the Blaze Wolf Chief. The Great Wizard was currently surrounded by dense ice-type mana and lightning-type mana. She was none other than the caster of Ice Prison and Lightning Waterfall.

This other female Great Wizard wore an icy-green robe paired with an icy-green mage’s hat, and under the hat was a delicate face. At a glance, she looked roughly the same age as Wu Xiaoxiao. Yet, unlike Wu Xiaoxiao, the girl wore a golden four-leaf emblem on her robe, symbolizing that she had already conquered the World Tower’s fourth floor. It was also the symbol of a Top Adventurer in the Greater God’s Domain.

When this Level 129 Great Wizard finished speaking, the Blaze Wolf Chief had already lost over 50 million HP and fallen into a heavily injured state, which reduced his Basic Attributes by 30%. As for the Three-tailed Blaze Wolves chasing after Wu Xiaoxiao, they had lost over 100 million HP each, a huge chunk of their HP bars vanishing in the blink of an eye. Their bodies were also riddled with heavy injuries, and their current Basic Attributes were inferior to even Great Lords of the same level.

Seeing this, Wu Xiaoxiao promptly swung her staff, executing silent casting as she bombarded the Blaze Wolf Chief with Tier 4 Spells. Immediately afterward, damage values exceeding 20 million appeared above the Realm Lord’s head in rapid succession.

The Blaze Wolf Chief could no longer rely on its battle recovery due to its heavily injured state. So, its HP bar rapidly depleted under the attack of the two Great Wizards. At this rate, it was only a matter of time before the Blaze Wolf Chief fell.

However, just when everything was progressing smoothly for the two girls, a threefold magic barrier suddenly appeared in the sky, instantly isolating an area of a 500-yard radius. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“A Threefold Heaven’s Lock?!” When the girl in the icy-green robe saw the barrier in the sky, her expression instantly darkened.

The Threefold Heaven’s Lock was a Grandmaster Magic Array. The value of just one set of scrolls for the Threefold Heaven’s Lock was equivalent to one Fragmented Legendary item. However, in exchange for its costly price, the Threefold Heaven’s Lock could trap even Tier 5 players for a considerable amount of time. It was one of the more precious means for players to trap their enemies in the Greater God’s Domain.

“There’s no running away, Midsummer! Hand over the Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal, and I will let you two go!”

Subsequently, a team of over twenty Tier 4 players scurried out of the distant grassland. The person standing in the lead of this team was a Level 130, Tier 4 male Summoner who also wore a golden four-leaf emblem on his chest.

“Don’t even think about it, Arrogance! We’ve long agreed that the highest bidder will get the ruin’s loot! Also, didn’t your team receive a share of the money already?! What you’re doing now is just robbery! Aren’t you afraid of the Purple Melody Alliance’s retaliation?!” the delicate girl named Midsummer said angrily as she glared at the male Summoner.

“So what? Do you think the Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal is something you can buy for a measly 300,000 Star Coins?” the Summoner named Uncaring Arrogance said with a contemptuous smile. “I admit that Purple Melody has many experts, but how many of these experts can you get to help you? Do you truly think the Twin Saints Alliance is afraid of you?”

“You!” Wu Xiaoxiao frowned when she heard Uncaring Arrogance’s words. However, she couldn’t think of anything to rebuke the Summoner’s words.

The Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal was indeed an incredibly valuable treasure. The countries in the Greater God’s Domain were situated far apart from each other, so teleportation between countries was incredibly expensive. Moreover, teleportation fees had to be paid in Seven Luminaries Crystals, and teleporting even to the nearest country would cost 50 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. Meanwhile, with the Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal, one could get one free teleportation every three days so long as the teleportation fee did not exceed 200 units.

However, the Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal was a rare item, so much so that most Tier 6 experts didn’t even have one.

In addition, under the rules set by the Ancient River Kingdom’s six hegemonic powers, players of a higher tier were prohibited from taking action against players of a lower tier within the kingdom’s territory unless it was because of a Guild War or City War. This was to ensure the Ancient River Kingdom’s order and stability. Anyone found breaking this rule would be jointly attacked by the six ruling hegemonic powers.

Hence, conflicts between players that took place within the kingdom’s borders would usually be limited to players of the same tier. Many geniuses and experts would even choose to remain at Tier 4 so that they could find better Legacies or further develop their Mana Bodies so that they could have an easier time at higher tiers.

It was true that the Purple Melody Alliance had over 30 Tier 6 experts under its command, which was far more than what the Twin Saints Alliance had. One of the Ancient River Kingdom’s top 50 Tier 6 experts even belonged to Purple Melody. However, when it came to Tier 4 experts, the Purple Melody Alliance was inferior to the Twin Saints Alliance.

“Since you refuse to hand it over, we will have no choice but to take it ourselves!” Uncaring Arrogance said before gesturing with his hand.

“There’s a person we’ve never seen before over there, Commander Arrogance,” a Tier 4 Assassin who was similarly wearing a Top Adventurer’s Emblem suddenly said to Uncaring Arrogance. “Should we attack him as well?”

Uncaring Arrogance glanced at Shi Feng when he heard the Assassin’s words. After failing to see a familiar Guild Emblem or even an Adventurer’s Emblem on Shi Feng, he indifferently said, “Get rid of them together! We cannot afford any mishaps with the Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal!”

Upon receiving Uncaring Arrogance’s command, 15 players from the Twin Saints Alliance’s team charged toward Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, while the remaining eight charged at Shi Feng. Of these 23 players, even the weakest was a Superior Adventurer. One of them, the Assassin who spoke to Uncaring Arrogance, was even a Top Adventurer.

“Xiaoxiao.” When Midsummer saw some of Twin Saints’ members targeting Shi Feng, she curiously looked to Wu Xiaoxiao and asked, “Do you know that guy? I noticed that you were quite surprised to see him just now.”

“Mhm. He’s from the same God’s Domain as me,” Wu Xiaoxiao said, nodding. “He’s also quite a well-known figure in our God’s Domain.”

“He’s a famous figure from your God’s Domain?” Midsummer’s eyes brightened when she heard Wu Xiaoxiao’s answer. “Is he strong?”

Midsummer was aware that Wu Xiaoxiao came from an isolated God’s Domain. From what she heard from Wu Xiaoxiao, the God’s Domain she came from was incredibly weak.

However, from what Midsummer could tell, Wu Xiaoxiao possessed incredible talent. Two days ago, Wu Xiaoxiao had even conquered the World Tower’s third floor, becoming one of the few Superior Adventurers in the Ancient River Kingdom.

Wu Xiaoxiao’s current combat standards might be inferior to hers, but it should be noted that Wu Xiaoxiao was only at the World Tower’s second-floor standard roughly two weeks ago. The ability to improve so rapidly definitely put Wu Xiaoxiao at the top among the Ancient River Kingdom’s latest generation of geniuses.

If even Wu Xiaoxiao already possessed such strength and talent, someone famous from Wu Xiaoxiao’s God’s Domain shouldn’t be weak.

“...” After thinking for a moment, Wu Xiaoxiao hesitantly said, “He should be at the standard of ordinary Top Adventurers.”

Black Flame was one of Zero Wing’s known Tier 6 God-ranked experts. Logically, he should only be at the standard of Superior Adventurers. However, Wu Xiaoxiao felt he should have made some improvements along with the myriad worlds’ descent.

“An ordinary Top Adventurer?” Midsummer sighed a little when she heard Wu Xiaoxiao’s answer. “I guess there’s no hope for us this time.”

Top Adventurers might be considered experts among experts in the Ancient River Kingdom, but an ordinary Top Adventurer would most likely have difficulty surviving the team led by Uncaring Arrogance.

While Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao were readying themselves for a harsh battle, the fourth-floor Assassin from Twin Saints suddenly split into three copies of himself and attacked Shi Feng simultaneously. Each doppelganger executed six attacks with the daggers they wielded, launching a total of eighteen attacks from different directions. The attacks were also executed at a speed beyond the reaction speed of the average Tier 4 player.

“Scram!”

However, when Shi Feng saw the Level 130 Assassin attacking him, he simply flung a punch at the empty space before him.

Boom!

Suddenly, cracks appeared in the space before Shi Feng.

Spatial Destruction!
