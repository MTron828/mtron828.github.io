Chapter 401 – Asura

“Can someone tell me what just happened?”

“Why did Vice Commander Qilin let Shi Feng get behind him?”

“Did Vice Commander Qilin just lose on purpose?”

When the surrounding crowd saw Chen Qilin’s five-meter-tall body collapse, confusion filled them after a brief silence.

Chen Qilin was not just any vice commander in the Star Lake Legion. In the current Star Lake Legion, his strength was second to only Red Frost.

Yet, such an expert had lost to a rookie?

No matter how everyone thought about it, they felt Chen Qilin must have lost on purpose. Otherwise, why would Chen Qilin stand still like a wooden block?

“Did Chen Qilin lose his mind?” Thousand Scars was flabbergasted when she saw how the battle had ended. “He is a vice commander of the Star Lake Legion. He is the face of the entire legion. Does he even understand what it means for him to lose to a rookie?”

The Star Lake Legion’s vice commanders were right below the commander in strength. If one of these vice commanders were to lose to a rookie, they wouldn’t just be ruining their own reputation but the entire legion’s reputation instead.

“His loss…was inevitable,” Death Omen said with a grim look, her reaction to Chen Qilin’s loss completely different from Thousand Scars’s reaction. “That guy… Shi Feng can no longer be considered human.”

“Chen Qilin’s loss was inevitable? Shi Feng’s not human?” Thousand Scars turned to look at Death Omen in surprise and confusion, her mind failing to comprehend the meaning behind Death Omen’s words.

Thousand Scars admitted that Shi Feng was powerful. From his first exchange with Chen Qilin, she could tell that he had most definitely reached the standard of titled experts.

However, there were plenty of titled experts in the Star Lake Legion. Or, more specifically, which member of the various ace battle groups wasn’t a titled expert?

However, to say that a titled expert could overwhelm Chen Qilin to a point where the latter couldn’t even react was beyond exaggeration.

“If we are comparing combat standards, those two are indeed evenly matched,” Death Omen said before pausing to take a deep breath. Then, with hints of fear in her eyes, she looked at Shi Feng’s figure and continued, “But Shi Feng’s Concentration…has already reached the Tier 6 standard.”

Players who had never reached Tier 6 would not have noticed why Chen Qilin had lost to Shi Feng. However, it was a different story for Death Omen, someone who was formerly a Tier 6 expert and knew the capabilities of a Tier 6 player.

His Concentration has reached Tier 6?

Thousand Scars gasped when she heard Death Omen’s words, an expression of disbelief appearing on her face as she turned to look at Shi Feng. Although she had never reached Tier 6, she had fought against many of the Flower of Seven Sins’ Tier 6 experts, so she knew how scary a player could be when their Concentration reached the Tier 6 standard.

Any player without Tier 6 Concentration would be highly susceptible to the mental influence of a player with Tier 6 Concentration. With Tier 6 Concentration, one could perceive even the subtle details of another person’s mental state that the person in question wasn’t even aware of.

In a one-on-one situation, so long as there wasn’t too significant of a gap in Basic Attributes or combat standards, a player with Tier 6 Concentration could trample over a player without Tier 6 Concentration.

But how could a Tier 4 player have Tier 6 Concentration?

…

At this time, Death Omen wasn’t the only person who had noticed Shi Feng’s Concentration standard. Every expert who was either at Tier 6 or had reached Tier 6 before was currently staring at Shi Feng with widened eyes. Some were puzzled, some were intimidated, and some were pleasantly surprised.

Meanwhile, after Markless Blade learned about the situation from his fellow vice commanders, he tentatively looked to the woman leisurely sitting behind him and asked, “Did you find out his Concentration has reached Tier 6 beforehand, Commander? Is that why you were confident in letting him fight Chen Qilin?”

Markless Blade was aware that Red Frost held a high opinion of Shi Feng. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have bothered to remember Shi Feng’s name.

However, no matter how high of an opinion Red Frost had of Shi Feng, it was still insane to let a rookie fight against Chen Qilin. Unless, of course, Red Frost didn’t want Shi Feng in the legion, which definitely wasn’t the case. In that case, it could only mean that Red Frost knew for certain Shi Feng would do fine even if he went up against Chen Qilin.

“No, I didn’t know that,” Red Frost said, shaking her head. Then, looking at Shi Feng with a hint of joy, she licked her lips and continued, “My initial thought was that he would suffer a major setback in Chen Qilin’s hands. I wouldn’t even be surprised if he failed to last ten moves. However, I didn’t expect him to give me such a huge surprise. Tier 6 Concentration! With this, I can give those old bastards over at Jade Light City a piece of my mind!”

“You didn’t know?” Red Frost’s words rendered Markless Blade speechless. “Yet, you still let Chen Qilin fight him? What if Shi Feng gets eliminated?”

“Eliminated?” Red Frost nonchalantly chuckled. “I won’t let him get eliminated. If he fails the test, I’ll use my commander’s privilege to let him join an ace battle group.”

“Your privilege?” When Markless Blade heard Red Frost’s statement, he couldn’t help but ask, “You only get one slot every decade. Wouldn’t it be a waste to use it on Shi Feng?”

Being the Star Lake Legion’s commander came with many privileges, and key among them was the privilege to unconditionally let one person under the age of 50 join an ace battle group.

Normally, this privilege would be used as a bargaining chip to poach peerless paragons from other cities. And as this privilege was incredibly unfair to the city’s countless geniuses and paragons, the Star Lake Legion’s commander was limited to only one such slot every decade.

“No, he is worth this slot!” Red Frost said definitively.

“He’s worth it?” Markless Blade turned to look at Shi Feng in confusion when he heard Red Frost’s answer.

Red Frost’s decision might have made sense if she had made it after learning that Shi Feng possessed Tier 6 Concentration, but before? No matter how Markless Blade thought about it, such a decision would be illogical. After all, their previous impression of Shi Feng was that he was only a titled expert, and there were plenty of titled experts in the Star Lake Legion.

When Red Frost saw Markless Blade’s confusion, she chuckled and asked, “Do you know about the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Seven Luminaries Lists?”

“Who?doesn’t?know about the Seven Luminaries Lists?” Markless Blade responded in a strange tone. “All players in the Greater God’s Domain pay attention to them. But what do they have to do with Shi Feng?”

The Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Seven Luminaries Lists were known throughout the Greater God’s Domain. There were three of these lists: the Luminous Glory List, the Sacred Glory List, and the Divine Glory List. The three lists catered to Tier 4, Tier 5, and Tier 6 players respectively, and each recorded 1,000 experts from Greater God’s Domain.

Any player who could get on one of the three lists, whether it was the Luminous Glory List for Tier 4s or the Divine Glory List for Tier 6s, would be an individual standing at the apex of the Greater God’s Domain.

The reason why even conglomerates respected Red Frost was that she used to be on the Divine Glory List in the past. During her prime, her fame in the Starlight Realm was second to none. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After all, throughout the Starlight Realm’s history, fewer than ten players from the Starlight Realm had managed to get into the Seven Luminaries Lists.

Indeed. They wouldn’t have ten players even if they counted all three lists.

“Of course he has something to do with it!” Red Frost said, grinning. “A change has occurred to the latest Luminous Glory List the Seven Luminaries Alliance has published internally. The 963rd ranker has fallen to 964th place, and the current 963rd ranker is Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, the Asura Sword Emperor Black Flame!”
