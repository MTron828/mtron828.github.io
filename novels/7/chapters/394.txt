Chapter 395 - Broken Steel Legacy Set Equipment

Shi Feng then used the Communication Crystal to contact Seliora.

“Hello, Miss Seliora. I am Ye Feng. I have something I would like your help with. I wonder if you have any time to spare right now?” Shi Feng carefully asked.

Ultimately, his current status was far from comparable to Seliora’s. Although they had a good relationship, basic courtesy was still required, if he wished to ask her for a favor.

“Oh, it’s you. I’m very busy right now, so make it quick.” Although Seliora did not immediately reject him, she still did not show any sign of interest.

To Seliora, nothing was more important than collecting Epic ranked forging materials right now. If not for the favor she owed Shi Feng, she would have directly rejected his request, instead of taking the time to listen to him.

Shi Feng was aware of this point. After all, he was extremely familiar with Seliora’s personality—someone who was wholeheartedly focused on forging, without the slightest bit of interest in anything else. This was also why she had managed to become a Grandmaster Forger at such a young age. Shi Feng then chuckled and said, “I have a forging design for an Epic Set Equipment.”

“What? Epic Set Equipment!?” Seliora’s eyes suddenly shone. She hurriedly demanded, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?! Meet me at my smithy right away!”

Shi Feng shook his head and laughed when he heard Seliora’s impatient tone.

To NPCs, Epic ranked forging designs, much less a forging design for an Epic Set Equipment, were extremely rare. It was the dream of countless forgers to produce a set of Epic Equipment.

Meanwhile, to players, Epic ranked forging designs were much more difficult to obtain. In the past, Shadow had only managed to get a few pieces. As for Epic Set Equipment Forging Designs, Shi Feng had only heard about them occasionally and had never personally seen one himself.

In God’s Domain, Set Equipment were half a rank stronger than discrete equipment of the same rank. In other words, the quality of an Epic Set Equipment was above that of Epic Equipment, but below that of Fragmented Legendary Equipment. To players who could not get their hands on Fragmented Legendary Equipment, Epic Set Equipment was the best equipment available.

In this life, Shi Feng was truly fortunate to have obtained the forging design for an Epic Set Equipment.

Half an hour later, Shi Feng arrived at Seliora’s smithy in a horse carriage. At this moment, the door to her smithy was still shut tight, and it did not seem she planned to do business at all.

Shi Feng walked over and knocked on the door. The thick wooden door then slowly opened, and a surge of scorching air rushed out of the house.

In the next moment, Seliora walked out from within before quickly dragging Shi Feng into the house.

Despite having not seen each other for some time, Seliora looked exactly the same, still fully garbed in black leather clothing. That large V-shaped collar revealed her snow-white skin. Her black leather pants tightly hugged her slender legs. Seliora currently exuded an enchanting charm.

“Hurry up and let me see it~~”

Seliora pushed Shi Feng against a table, her body very nearly sticking to his. Her eyes shone with excitement as she spoke, failing to notice how lethal her impure actions were...

Although Shi Feng had long since gotten used to Seliora’s personality in his past life, his heart still raced involuntarily every time they met.

“Here it is.” Shi Feng calmed down somewhat and retrieved the Broken Steel Forging Design from his bag.

[Broken Steel Set Equipment]

Epic Rank Unique Set Equipment

Six-piece set consisting of:

Broken Steel Gauntlets

Broken Steel Breastplate Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Broken Steel Helmet

Broken Steel Leg Guards

Broken Steel Boots

Broken Steel Bracers

Equipment Requirement: Strength 1,000, Agility 1,200, Sword-related Mastery 350

Class Restriction: Blade Saint

Originally, Shi Feng had thought he could equip this Broken Steel Set Equipment immediately. However, 1,000 points in Strength and 1,200 points in Agility were definitely not achievable by players below Level 30. At the very least, one needed to be above Level 50 to possess such Attributes.

Meanwhile, the materials required to produce this Set Equipment were 12 pieces of Eternium, 300 Mana Stones, 1,000 pieces of Titan Ore, 12 Fire Source Crystals, 12 Water Source Crystals, 12 Wind Source Crystals, 12 Earth Source Crystals and one Nucleus of Life.

“The person who drew this design must be insane! Is he trying to make a Legendary item?”

Seliora gaped in shock after inspecting the forging design.

Not to mention Seliora’s, even Shi Feng’s heart was beating madly right now. He, too, was dumbfounded by the description.

Shi Feng had previously been caught up in his joy over becoming a Blade Saint. Moreover, he knew it was impossible for him to produce the Broken Steel Set Equipment by himself and to gather the materials required to make the set. Hence, although Shi Feng had long since completed the Broken Steel Forging Design, he never actually bothered to take a look at it.

As for the reason why Shi Feng had come looking for Seliora this time, he simply wished to know how confident she was in producing the Set Equipment. That way, he could make appropriate preparations for it.

However, after seeing the forging materials required, Shi Feng immediately dismissed his previous thoughts of making preparations. Just collecting a single set of materials was nigh impossible, not to mention collecting a second set.

Previously, Shi Feng had spent hundreds of Gold just to produce 21 Mana Stones. Now, the Set Equipment actually required 300 Mana Stones! That was a few thousand Gold, at least! However, even if he did manage to obtain the 300 Mana Stones, Eternium was something much rarer and more precious than even Mana Stones. Countless Master Forgers dreamt of obtaining even just one piece. Yet, the set actually needed 12 to produce! Titan Ore was also a considerably high-class rare ore. At this stage of the game, nobody was capable of mining such an ore yet. As for the Elemental Source Crystals, they were all materials highly sought after by Master Alchemists. Their preciousness and rarity were not one bit lower than Eternium!

Meanwhile, the most inconceivable thing was that the Broken Steel Set Equipment actually required a Nucleus of Life. The value of that item far surpassed even the Water of Life, and it was something that could only be found with luck.

“Miss Seliora, if you have the materials, how confident are you in making it?” Shi Feng asked. Originally, he had already planned on giving up on producing the Broken Steel Set Equipment. However, after giving it some thought, he still chose to inquire.

“You really have the materials?” Seliora’s expression immediately changed upon hearing Shi Feng’s words. Her gaze as she looked at Shi Feng was as if she were looking at a Seven Luminaries Crystal Mountain, and she beamed at him as if saying, “Tycoon, let’s be friends!”

“I was only asking.” Shi Feng smiled bitterly, shaking his head.

Even if he sold everything in his possession right now—including himself—he still wouldn’t be able to gather all the required materials.

“Around 20%. If you give me more time to practice, I can raise it to 30%.” Seliora rolled her eyes at Shi Feng, feeling slightly disappointed. However, her interest in producing the Broken Steel Set Equipment still burned brightly.

“Thirty percent?” Shi Feng had also made his own estimations before. It would be extremely fortunate if Seliora could have a 20% success rate. Most likely, only a few NPC Grandmaster Forgers could actually achieve a 30% success rate. As for players, even if Shi Feng waited until someone became a Grandmaster Forger, these players would have around a 10% success rate, at most. “I’ll have to trouble Miss Seliora, then. I will try my best to collect the materials required.”

“Since you have entrusted this task to me, I will continuously research this forging design, while you gather the materials. As for the cost of making it, I won’t charge you anything if it is unsuccessful,” Seliora said happily.

In God’s Domain, one needed to pay an exorbitant labor fee when commissioning a forger—be they players or NPCs—of Master rank and above to produce an item, regardless of the final result. Now, however, Seliora offered not to charge him should she fail. It could be seen just how happy Seliora was right now.

System: Seliora’s Favorability towards you has increased by 100.

Currently, Shi Feng was in no hurry to produce the Broken Steel Set Equipment. After all, even if it was produced, he did not possess the Attributes needed to equip it. In order to do so, he needed to be above Level 50 at the very least. During this period, he could slowly gather the required materials.

Following which, Shi Feng left the Broken Steel Forging Design at Seliora’s place to allow her to properly study it. He then hailed another carriage and hurried to the location he had agreed to meet Gentle Snow at.
