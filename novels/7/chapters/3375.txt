Chapter 450 – World Mode Courtyard of Space

“Elder Parker, what is the meaning of this World Mode?” Moro questioned as he coldly looked at Parker. “Why have I never heard you mentioning it before?”

The Red Dragon Nation was a pseudo-apex power and a titanic existence in the Greater God’s Domain. It was vastly more powerful than the likes of the Galaxy Conglomerate. Because of this, every Elder position in the Guild was highly sought after by the Red Dragon Nation’s many executives.

Parker might be one of the rare individuals who had reached the realm of Saints, but the Red Dragon Nation had quite a few of such existences under its command. So, even as a Saint, Parker wouldn’t be guaranteed an Elder position if he joined the Guild.

Meanwhile, for the sake of ruining Frey’s plans, Moro and the conglomerate behind him had paid a heavy price to secure Parker an Elder position in the Red Dragon Nation. Yet, now…

“I have never heard Frey talk about this before when I was by her side, Lord Moro,” Parker hurriedly explained when he saw Moro’s cold expression. “The two women who provided the Courtyard of Space’s information never mentioned this, either.”

Honestly, Parker was even more astonished than Moro to learn that Frey had activated the Courtyard of Space’s World Mode.

“Enough. I do not want to hear your excuses,” Moro said.

Everyone present shuddered when they heard Moro’s cold tone. Even Saints like Parker and Desert Web shuddered a little.

As someone who had served as one of the Red Dragon Nation’s Vice Guild Leaders for over two decades, Moro possessed not only astonishing individual strength but also an extraordinarily powerful background. So, it wasn’t difficult for him to deal with a Saint or two.

“What should we do now, Lord Moro?” Desert Web asked. “Even if we try to form a new team now, I do not think we can gather strong enough players to raid the World Mode Courtyard of Space.”

“We continue with our raid.” After taking a deep breath, Moro took a deep breath and smiled. “I have underestimated Frey before. I hate to admit it, but it would seem that she didn’t get into the position through luck. It is too late for us to contest World Mode now. But Frey probably didn’t expect Parker’s group to defect, so she shouldn’t think of securing the First Clear, either!”

“That is true.” Desert Web nodded. “Her team can’t even clear God Mode without Parker’s group, let alone World Mode. Meanwhile, if we can obtain the God Mode Courtyard of Space’s loot, it should make things a lot easier for us to raid World Mode.”

“Indeed! Frey might think she has secured an advantage, but if she can’t even clear God Mode, what can she do in World Mode? This is the first time the Greater God’s Domain has ever seen a World Mode Team Dungeon, so its raid difficulty should be beyond imagination. It might look like we have taken a longer way, but who will emerge victorious remains to be seen!” Moro nodded. Immediately, he stood up and said, “We’ve rested enough! Continue advancing!”

Parker vehemently nodded in agreement with Moro and Desert Web. He also couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

Apart from Moro’s team, the other teams stuck in the God Mode Courtyard of Space also had the same idea and started to accelerate their raid progress. They were all aiming to pave a path for themselves toward the World Mode Courtyard of Space.

…

Meanwhile, inside the World Mode Courtyard of Space…

The Courtyard of Space’s interior was as vast as a city. Countless divine patterns covered the sky, the glow they radiated illuminating the entire courtyard. Meanwhile, along with the descent of numerous streaks of light in the courtyard’s front garden, the garden quickly became lively.

This is the World Mode Courtyard of Space?

Death Omen and Thousand Scars immediately gasped when they arrived in the front garden’s plaza.

Although there were no monsters in the plaza, they could see spatial blades flying all over the courtyard. These spatial blades came in various lengths, with the smaller ones measuring several centimeters while the larger ones measuring several dozen meters. The smaller spatial blades were incredibly hard to follow with the naked eye, while the larger spatial blades looked like they could easily cleave a skyscraper in half.

Not only did these spatial blades cover almost every open space in the courtyard, but they also moved in irregular patterns. Moreover, every spatial blade carried enough destructive power to give Tier 6 experts a lot of trouble. Tier 5 players simply had no chance at blocking these spatial blades and living to tell the tale. Even Tier 5 MTs were not an exception.

When Frey, Unrestrained Lionheart, and the other fifth-floor experts of the team saw the spatial blades flying around them, they couldn’t help but feel cornered.

As if these spatial blades weren’t hard enough to deal with, on top of having great numbers, speed, and irregular movement patterns, these spatial blades would also bounce off any object which innately belonged to the courtyard, altering their course and speed in the process. It was also challenging to predict whether a spatial blade would accelerate or decelerate after bouncing off an object.

If they had to fight against monsters in such an environment, even fifth-floor experts going all out would have difficulty performing effectively, let alone fourth-floor experts.

So, this is the rumored Blade Field.

Shi Feng was similarly astonished by the sight before him.

To make matters worse, because the Blade Field covered

One of the aspects that made the World Mode Courtyard of Space challenging was the Blade Field.

Every spatial blade in the Blade Field had power at the Tier 6 standard and speed rivaling the arrows fired by Tier 5 Rangers. Because of the Blade Field’s presence, even traversing the courtyard became a challenge, let alone fighting against the courtyard’s monsters. Moreover, as the Blade Field covered the entire courtyard, players had to be in constant motion and couldn’t stop to rest for even a moment. Yet, as luck would have it, raiding the World Mode Courtyard of Space required a significant amount of time.

Simply put, the challenges players faced in the World Mode Courtyard of Space were on an entirely different level than what players needed to face in the God Mode Courtyard of Space.

While everyone was feeling shocked by the scene before them, bursts of roars suddenly came from outside the garden plaza. The roars echoed throughout the entire plaza, causing everyone to shudder involuntarily.

Before anyone could react, several thirty-meter-tall scaled behemoths appeared in their view.

“Tier 5 Earth Dragons?!”

“Heavens! Tier 5 Earth Dragons!”

“Madness! This is madness! These are the highest-ranked Dragonkins we are talking about, yet there are three of them here?! This is totally different from the information we received!”

When everyone saw the three scaled behemoths wandering the garden before them, their faces paled as if they had just seen a ghost. Even Unrestrained Lionheart started to sweat out of anxiety.

…

[Devouring Earth Dragon] (Dragonkin, Legendary)

Level 147

HP 500,000,000,000

…

Earth Dragons were at the top of the Dragonkin hierarchy, and they possessed Life Ratings nearing actual Dragons. Normally, any Tier 5 Legendary Earth Dragon could be regarded as a World Boss. After factoring in the effects of Holy Power Protection, even a 100-man Tier 5 team would have great difficulty raiding one.

Yet, now, three Tier 5 Earth Dragons had appeared before their teams. Moreover, these Earth Dragons were merely the fodder of the Courtyard of Space…

Most importantly, their team had to fight against these Earth Dragons in an environment covered with spatial blades.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, are you certain we can raid this place?” When Frey saw the three Devouring Earth Dragons roaming the garden before her, she couldn’t help but turn to Shi Feng.
