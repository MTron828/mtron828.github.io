Chapter 212 – The Current Zero Wing Is Very Strong!

“We don’t have to go? Risky action?” Liu Wusheng was exasperated when he heard Hidden Soul’s response. “Chief Administrator Soul, according to our initial estimates, at least 10,000 Refinement Realm experts have entered the primordial ruins to go after Zero Wing. Even if Zero Wing’s team has Guild Leader Black Flame in it, the Flower of Seven Sins also has its own Tier 6 God-ranked experts. Moreover, the other side has the advantage in numbers. Zero Wing might have made significant progress recently, but its foundations are still too shallow. Let alone the Flower of Seven Sins, even the various first-rate powers moving this time can deal catastrophic damage to Zero Wing.”

Tier 6 God-ranked experts might remain powerful after entering the Miniature Ancient World, but they weren’t invincible. Several Domain Realm experts working together could easily keep Shi Feng busy while everyone else took care of Zero Wing’s other members. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Aside from Shi Feng, the only other noteworthy expert in Zero Wing was Su Qianliu. However, even if Su Qianliu could exhibit the strength of an apex expert by virtue of her Mana Equipment Set, she could, at most, fight one of the various superpowers’ apex experts to a standstill. Faced against a force of more than 10,000 Refinement Realm experts and above, there was very little Su Qianliu could do.

“You don’t have to worry, Mr. Liu. The current Zero Wing is very strong!” Hidden Soul said, chuckling as she looked at the anxious Liu Wusheng. Then, she added, “Anyway, let’s stop focusing on that matter. Guild Leader Black Flame has asked us to deal with an urgent matter.”

“The current Zero Wing is very strong?” Liu Wusheng was greatly confused by Hidden Soul’s words. No matter how he racked his mind, he simply couldn’t figure out how Zero Wing could possibly go up against the experts of so many first-rate powers and superpowers. However, he also didn’t think Hidden Soul would lie to him since Hidden Soul’s fate was tied to the Asura Mercenary Alliance. “May I know what Guild Leader Black Flame has asked us to do?”

“Seven Luminaries Crystals!” Hidden Soul said, her expression suddenly turning serious. “Guild Leader Black Flame urgently needs 3,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystals. He hopes that we can gather this amount as soon as possible.”

“Three thousand units isn’t a small amount,” Liu Wusheng said with a slight frown. “There’s still no stable source of Seven Luminaries Crystals found in the Miniature Ancient World. It’s also a crucial resource for reaching Tier 6. Even if we offer to buy them at a high price, I doubt any powers in possession of Seven Luminaries Crystals will sell them to us...”

Hidden Soul nodded in understanding. Then, she said, “Guild Leader Black Flame has thought of this point, so he plans to use Lineage Crystals to exchange for them. If we offer to exchange at a rate of 300 units of Seven Luminaries Crystals per Lineage Crystal, I’m sure the various powers will be interested.”

“We’re using Lineage Crystals to exchange?” Liu Wusheng was stunned. Hurriedly, he objected, “Our reserve of Lineage Crystals is already dwindling, Chief Administrator Soul. If we are to trade away ten Lineage Crystals at this juncture, it’ll only accelerate the process of the various superpowers siding with the Flower of Seven Sins.”

The reason the various superpowers were willing to target the Flower of Seven Sins right now was that they could acquire Lineage Crystals for doing so. If Asura ran out of Lineage Crystals, the various superpowers definitely wouldn’t continue targeting the Flower of Seven Sins.

After all, the Flower of Seven Sins wasn’t some pushover. If the various superpowers continued their hostilities, they might really end up on the Flower of Seven Sins’ hit list. If that happened, there was a high chance they would become history in God’s Domain.

“Guild Leader Black Flame has also considered this point. If those fence-sitters want to side with the Flower of Seven Sins, they are more than welcome. The Asura Mercenary Alliance doesn’t need such members!” Hidden Soul said in a determined tone. “Anyone who chooses to side with the Flower of Seven Sins will be permanently expelled from Asura!”

Liu Wusheng was honestly dumbfounded when he heard Hidden Soul’s statement. He felt that both Shi Feng and Hidden Soul had lost their minds.

Presently, the Asura Mercenary Alliance was already on the brink of collapse. If the mercenary alliance were to expel the various superpowers’ experts, what would it use to resist the Flower of Seven Sins?

“I still have many matters to take care of, Mr. Liu. If there is nothing else, I will be taking my leave now,” Hidden Soul said, not bothering to offer Liu Wusheng any additional explanations. After saying so, she turned around and swiftly left to inform the various powers about the exchange of Seven Luminaries Crystals and Lineage Crystals.

Meanwhile, in the central area of the primordial ruins...

“Guild Leader, in front of us is Windy Sand Town, a resting spot for players. The Flower of Seven Sins has turned the town into its base of operations,” Wu Lingling said as she pointed at the town roughly one kilometer away. “Currently, as the Flower of Seven Sins is focused on exploring the Boundary Mountain Range, it has recruited a large number of independent Refinement Realm experts to help defend Windy Sand Town. There are roughly 5,000 Refinement Realm experts stationed in the town at all times, and they will attack any members of Asura who dare to approach it.”

While looking at the several dozen independent players standing atop the distant town’s walls, Shi Feng was a little astonished when he heard Wu Lingling’s report.

The Flower of Seven Sins’ pocket is truly deep. Even major corporations wouldn’t be willing to hire 5,000 Refinement Realm experts to garrison a town at all times.

It might not cost much to hire the services of a Refinement Realm expert for a day or two, but it was a different story if the employment period was long-term. Employing a Refinement Realm expert for an entire month could easily cost one million Credits or more, while a force of 5,000 Refinement Realm experts would cost at least five billion Credits to employ for a month.

Not to mention, most independent Refinement Realm experts usually wouldn’t accept Credits as payment. Instead, they would only accept Coins or Magic Crystals. This would further increase the cost of hiring these experts. In addition, any losses these hired experts incurred during the employment period would be shouldered by the employer. Unless absolutely necessary, the average superpower definitely wouldn’t be willing to hire 5,000 Refinement Realm experts just to safeguard a town.

After observing the town’s situation, Shi Feng turned around to face the young geniuses behind him. Then, seeing the eager looks on these youngsters’ faces, he waved his hand and said, “Alright! It’s time we take action!”
