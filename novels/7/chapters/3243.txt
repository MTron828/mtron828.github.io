Chapter 318 – Uproar in Star Lake

Tier 5 Magic Equipment!

Typically, it was a super-special equipment that players could only manage after reaching Tier 5.

This was because simply meeting the magic equipment’s basic requirements wasn’t enough to unleash all of its effects. On top of that, players also needed to fulfill special conditions if they wanted to unleash all of the magic equipment’s strength.

However, so long as a player could operate a piece of Tier 5 Magic Equipment normally, it’d be akin to wearing a full set of Fragmented Legendary Equipment. If used by players under Tier 5, it could instantly raise their combat power by one whole tier.

!!

Only, using Tier 5 Magic Equipment placed a huge burden on the wearer’s Concentration. In addition, players also needed to be incredibly skilled at mana manipulation to activate the magic equipment’s magic array. These harsh conditions made it so that even among Tier 5 players, few could actually use Tier 5 Magic Equipment. So, it was even less likely for players beneath Tier 5 to use Tier 5 Magic Equipment.

Yet, now, not only did the Tier 5 Magic Equipment that had been sitting in Heavenly Boa’s treasury finally get to see the light of day again, but it was even being used by Markless Blade, a Tier 4 player.

A legend!

The young Guardian Knight felt that he had just seen the beginnings of a new legend!

With Markless Blade’s current strength, he could even try to compete for the top three positions of Myriad Forest Empire’s Battle of Geniuses, let alone defeat the Ancient River Kingdom’s Saint Three. He also wouldn’t have any trouble getting into the top 20 of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition this time. Moreover, this was after taking into account the paragons of other kingdoms and empires secretly participating in the competition.

Meanwhile, after revealing his Tier 5 Magic Equipment, Markless Blade glanced at the young Guardian Knight and proudly said, “Go back and tell those Grand Elders that I will take care of Black Flame during the official competition. I will let everyone in the Ancient River Kingdom know the terror of the Heavenly Boa Guild!”

Markless Blade’s words were very domineering, and his voice echoed throughout the entire plaza. Everyone in the plaza heard him loud and clear, and they couldn’t help but be shocked by his proclamation.

“Crap! What’s going on? Are we going to see a 1v1 at the apex level?”

“Tier 5 Magic Equipment! I can’t believe someone can use Tier 5 Magic Equipment at Tier 4!”

“Amazing! This is simply amazing! As expected of the Heavenly Boa Guild!”

“I really didn’t think Markless Blade would reappear with such strength after going silent for so many years.”

“You youngsters might not know it, but although Markless Blade has grown a little old in age, he had shocked the entire Myriad Forest Empire during his youth. The number of paragons he had defeated in the Myriad Forest Empire is well over ten. If he hadn’t attracted too much attention back then, causing Heavenly Boa to hide him, he could have easily entered the top five of the empire’s most recent Battle of Geniuses.”

Many youths in their early twenties were shocked by the terrifying aura Markless Blade revealed shocked, and they couldn’t help but wonder about his background. Meanwhile, geniuses who belonged to the same generation as Markless Blade began proudly explaining Markless Blade’s history to these young geniuses.

Before even reaching 20 years of age, Markless Blade had already become famous throughout the Myriad Forest Empire. At 24, he had secured second place in the Myriad Forest Empire’s Battle of Geniuses, shocking the entire empire. At 27, he had participated in the Hundred Nations Paragon Battle. Unfortunately, he had offended the paragon of an upper-ranking hegemonic power at the time, so the Heavenly Boa Guild had no choice but to hide him and keep him out of the public’s eyes.

At 30, he joined Star Lake City’s Star Lake Legion. Although he was nothing more than an ordinary participant when he joined, he had recently gotten promoted to vice commander by Star Lake City’s infamous madwoman Red Frost.

Moreover, according to rumors, a significant part of why the Twin Saints Alliance’s current Saint Three had managed to gain his current achievements was because of Markless Blade’s teachings.

Now, after maintaining a low profile for so many years, Markless Blade had finally decided to stop hiding. Meanwhile, not only did he reveal himself to be capable of using a piece of Tier 5 Magic Equipment, but his Epic Mana Body had also reached the legendary 120% Completion Rate. His achievements were already close to rivaling the Myriad Forest Empire’s current First Paragon.

…

Star Lake City, God’s Domain Association:

Inside an advanced training room on the 500th floor, over a hundred talented young men and women were frenziedly training in their attempt to improve their rankings in the city legion’s selection. They all hoped they could get a sufficiently high ranking and join the Star Lake Legion as official participants directly.

At this time, though, some of these young men and women suddenly stopped their training one after another as they gathered around a beautiful young woman to discuss something.

“Qianhen, have you heard about the news from the Star Lake Legion?” a cute girl who currently ranked in the top 100 of the selection asked as she looked at Thousand Scars. “The legion’s Vice Commander Markless Blade appears to have challenged the Black Flame from your Miniature Ancient World. It seems they will have a one-on-one duel during the official competition of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition. News about this fight has spread all over Star Lake City already.”

“I just heard about it as well,” a beautiful girl said, nodding. Then, she looked at Thousand Scars and continued, “Qianhen, I previously heard you mentioning that Black Flame is Zero Wing’s Guild Leader. Is he strong?”

Almost nobody living in Star Lake City knew about Black Flame. However, so long as one had lived in Star Lake City for some time, they would definitely know about Markless Blade.

In the past, Markless Blade was merely an unassuming team leader in the Star Lake Legion. The strength he displayed was also average at best. Yet, as soon as that madwoman became the Star Lake Legion’s new commander, she promoted Markless Blade into one of her vice commanders without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Markless Blade did not disappoint Red Frost’s appointment, either, displaying astonishing combat standards as soon as he got promoted. He could easily rank within the top five out of the Star Lake Legion’s dozen or so vice commanders. Many powerful corporations had even extended an olive branch to him as a result.

At the same time, Markless Blade also became a target for many wealthy young ladies. He also became the prime real estate for the Star Lake Legion’s female participants, many women wishing to marry him.

“Vice Commander Markless Blade is challenging Black Flame?” Thousand Scars was dumbfounded by this news.

Markless Blade was an individual standing at the top of Star Lake City’s social hierarchy. Even though she had already become an internal member of the Paimon Conglomerate, before she developed her untapped potential, her status in the Greater World would still be vastly inferior to Markless Blade.

Not to mention, the Paimon Conglomerate had tasked her to join the Star Lake Legion and carry out all of the legion’s activities normally. Meanwhile, she would be nothing more than an ordinary participant when she passed the selection and joined the legion.

As for Black Flame, he was nothing more than a slightly stronger and in her eyes. Although he had earned some fame in the Miniature Ancient World and even became a titled expert, he should still be vastly inferior to a paragon of the Greater God’s Domain like Markless Blade.

No matter how Thousand Scars looked at it, it should be impossible for Black Flame and Markless Blade to have anything to do with each other.

Yet, now, she was being told that Markless Blade was challenging Black Flame?

These people must be joking with her!
