Chapter 87 – True Monster

“He died…”

“I must be dreaming! How can he kill a hundred Refinement Realm experts in one move?! This must be a dream!”

Hundred Flower Palace’s and Nature Hall’s members couldn’t help but doubt their eyes when they saw One-eyed Ghost and the 100 Refinement Realm experts evaporating from the battlefield.

They were aware that massive gaps could exist even between Tier 3 experts. Take One-eyed Ghost, for example. They were unlikely to beat him even if they ganged up on him. However, even though they couldn’t beat him, they could see and understand why they were inferior to him.

The current situation, though, was something they couldn’t even understand…

At this time, let alone the two Guilds’ experts, even Su Qianliu and the others were flabbergasted by this situation. The attack Shi Feng just executed had already exceeded their common sense of what a Tier 3 player was capable of, and it was something none of them had seen before.

“What just happened, Big Sis Rue?! Why couldn’t I sense even a bit of Mana fluctuation coming from him just now?!” Rain Song asked as she turned to Cleansed Rue, her eyes filled with shock and confusion. “That attack’s power was close to reaching the Tier 4 Peak standard! How can a Tier 3 player like him unleash such power without using any Tier 3 Super Skills?!”

Space in God’s Domain was incredibly stable, and attacks would typically have to reach the Tier 4 Peak standard to shatter space into oblivion. Unless a Tier 3 player used a Tier 3 Ancient Super Skill or Spell, it should be impossible for them to achieve such power.

However, Rain Song had failed to sense any Mana fluctuations coming from Shi Feng just now. In other words, Shi Feng had unleashed that extraordinary attack just now without employing the use of any Skills or Spells. Instead, he had relied entirely on his techniques to execute that attack.

Even as someone who used to be at the peak of Tier 4, Rain Song had never heard of a Tier 3 player being able to execute an attack at the Tier 4 Peak standard.

“He should’ve used some kind of Mana Technique just now,” Cleansed Rue said, a grim expression on her face as she looked at Shi Feng. “However, out of all the Mana Techniques I know, none of them are capable of unleashing such destructive power.”

“You two can stop guessing. That was indeed a Mana Technique,” Crimson Heart suddenly said as she watched the space around Shi Feng slowly mending itself. “But this Mana Technique should be…a God’s Legacy.”

“A God’s Legacy?!” Upon hearing Crimson Heart’s words, Rain Song immediately turned to look at Shi Feng, her voice trembling as she muttered, “Doesn’t that mean…he is…”

“Mhm, it is just as you guessed.” Look at Shi Feng, Crimson Heart’s complexion sank slightly as she said, “He should be a Tier 6 Sword God!”

“Crazy! This is crazy! Why would someone like him come to this place?!” Rain Song ranted almost frantically as she looked at Shi Feng.

Tier 6 God-ranked experts stood at the pinnacle of God’s Domain. Unless Tier 6 Gods appeared, they would be near-invincible existences.

Currently, the reason why so many experts had chosen to abandon their achievements on the main continent and enter the Miniature Ancient World was so that they could hopefully ascend to greater heights. Even Tier 5 experts were no exception.

However, it was a different story for Tier 6 God-ranked experts. As individuals who had already reached the theoretical finish line of God’s Domain, Tier 6 God-ranked experts did not need to enter the Miniature Ancient World. After all, no matter how great of a fortuitous encounter they came across in the Miniature Ancient World, the best they could achieve was to climb back to Tier 6. Rather than waste their time doing such a futile action, they’d be better off doing other, more productive things.

At this moment, Rain Song wasn’t the only one confused by this situation. Even Cleansed Rue, a Tier 5 expert, was similarly confused.

For what reason did a Tier 6 God-ranked expert like Shi Feng come to the Miniature Ancient World? Did he come here to bully noobs because he had nothing better to do?

While Cleansed Rue and the others were feeling shocked and confused, Shi Feng, who stood in mid-air, turned to Crimson Heart and Stalwart Bear. Then, like a god looking down at a bunch of ants, he asked, “Do you still want to continue?”

Even before obtaining the Tier 3 Ancient Mana Equipment Set, Shi Feng had never cared about any first-rate Guild. Now that he had the Mana Equipment Set, the only Guilds that could enter his eyes were Super Guilds. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left the Ancient Demon Court with his team.

Meanwhile, upon hearing Shi Feng’s question, the two first-rate Guilds’ members couldn’t help but turn to look at Crimson Heart and Stalwart Bear, anxiety coloring their faces.

Previously, they had looked at Shi Feng and his team as if they were ants. Now, though, the situation had made a complete reversal, and Shi Feng could decide their life and death with just a thought.

It should be known that a Guild War Order was sealing the map they were currently in, so they couldn’t log out even if they wanted to. Moreover, Shi Feng’s team could even freely resurrect them after killing them. If Crimson Heart and Stalwart Bear answered poorly, everyone here would have a bleak future ahead of them…

“You jest, Sir.” After a moment of silence, Crimson Heart frankly said, “If you wish to leave now, I doubt we’ll be able to stop you even if we wanted to.”

Shi Feng’s attack just now had already destroyed the magic barrier enveloping his team. At this time, even Su Qianliu and the others could freely leave the cavern, let alone Shi Feng.

Hearing Crimson Heart’s words, Stalwart Bear helplessly gestured for Nature Hall’s members to step aside and open a path for Zero Wing’s team.

Meanwhile, neither Crimson Heart nor Cleansed Rue was surprised by how decisively Stalwart Bear responded.

With Stalwart Bear’s personality, he would’ve fought to the very end if Shi Feng wasn’t a Tier 6 God-ranked expert. It wouldn’t matter even if Nature Hall’s team ran the risk of annihilation. He would take his chances so long as he had the slightest possibility of victory.

However, the only solution to a Tier 6 God-ranked expert was another Tier 6 God-ranked expert. Without a Tier 6 God-ranked expert on his side, the only thing Stalwart Bear could do in this situation was to take the loss. This was because it was incredibly difficult to topple a God-ranked expert using numbers. If he did that, he would only be worsening his losses. Not to mention, they were currently in the Miniature Ancient World. Making an enemy out of a Tier 6 God-ranked expert here was no different than courting death.

After seeing the two first-rate Guilds’ members opening a path, Shi Feng locked the Ancient Demon Court’s entrance and said through the team chat, “Let’s go.”

Meanwhile, whether it was Su Qianliu or Blackie, both of them couldn’t help but stare at Shi Feng in a daze.

Being able to win against one of the Eight Sword Meisters was already an astonishing feat. Now, Shi Feng had even wiped out a hundred Refinement Realm experts in a single move. Even the legendary experts of God’s Domain were probably incapable of such a feat when they were at Tier 3.
