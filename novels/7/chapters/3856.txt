“I don’t know her. I’ve had people keep an eye on Zero Wing throughout this period, but this is the first time I’ve seen her. She should have joined Zero Wing only recently,” Verdant Rainbow said, smiling wryly as she looked at Elder Martial, who very clearly wanted to seek guidance from Purgatory Jade.

“You don’t know her?” Elder Martial stroked his white beard at Verdant Rainbow’s answer. “Regardless, this is a good opportunity for us to get to know her. Unseeing Demon might have been defeated, but Evil Nature is still a royal power; a single Mortal God isn’t enough to topple it. Have the Divine Luminary Legion reinforce Zero Wing in Plot 095 immediately!”

“Elder Martial, are we really going to mobilize the Divine Luminary Legion?” Elder Martial’s decision surprised Verdant Rainbow.

The Divine Luminary Legion was a trump card among the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s trump card legions. It was a gathering of chosen ones from multiple generations. Although it had no sixth-floor experts, it was one of the few trump cards that allowed the Seven Luminaries Alliance to combat royal powers. By having the Divine Luminary Legion assist Zero Wing, the Seven Luminaries Alliance would be giving up on a plot of land in Everlasting City.

“Do it.” Elder Martial nodded. “It’ll be worth it if we can befriend a Mortal God.”

“I understand.” Upon hearing Elder Martial’s reasoning, Verdant Rainbow felt that his decision made sense.

In a situation where none of the various human powers had sixth-floor experts, the existence of the first human sixth-floor expert was akin to a banner. It was especially so now that Purgatory Jade had revealed herself before the various powers of the three races. Once the competition was over, Verdant Rainbow could imagine many powers from all three races trying to curry favor and establish partnerships with Purgatory Jade. The various human powers, in particular, would try to obtain her method and experience in reaching the sixth-floor standard.

While the Seven Luminaries Alliance might be an apex power, it wasn’t the only apex power of the human race. If it could establish close ties with Purgatory Jade in this competition, it would have a much easier time trading and establishing partnerships with Purgatory Jade than the other apex powers later.

However, just as Verdant Rainbow was about to inform the Divine Luminary Legion, the five Evil Nature members in the Magic Mirror suddenly made a move. They scattered to the five corners, surrounding Zero Wing’s team, retrieved a two-meter-tall idol from their bags, and erected the idols around Zero Wing’s team. Immediately afterward, the five idols raised a Holy Power barrier that covered a 5,000-yard radius and isolated Zero Wing’s team from the outside world.

…

“There’s something strange about this barrier! I can’t feel the presence of any Mana!” Phoenix Rain exclaimed when she sensed the change in her surroundings. “The Holy Power here is also eroding my Mana ten times faster than normal!”

At Phoenix Rain’s exclamation, the other Zero Wing members quickly realized what was happening, and their faces immediately changed color.

Mana was the human players’ primary source of strength. If their surroundings had no Mana for them to use, the power of their Skills, Spells, Mana Techniques, and combat techniques would plummet.

The strengthened erosive properties of Holy Power on Mana made things even worse. Once their Mana was eroded completely, only death awaited them. Yet, if they wanted to resist this erosive effect, they would have to designate a portion of their Mana to resist it while battling. This would further reduce their combat power.

“World Idols?” Shi Feng frowned at the holy idols erected around Zero Wing’s team.

The Holy Race’s World Idols were very well-known in his previous life. They were powerful tools critical in the war between the Holy Race and the human race. With only five World Idols, one could seal and alter the environment of a large area for six hours. During this period, players caught in the seal could not leave it, while players outside could freely enter it. The World Idols were the perfect tools for trapping and killing players. Their only flaw was that they were single-use consumables that were difficult to produce. Even the Holy Race’s royal powers had only a few in their possession.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What a surprise! You know about the World Idols,” a four-armed, middle-aged man from Evil Nature exclaimed, looking at Shi Feng in delight. “But you can be proud of yourselves. Not only did you kill the commander, but you also forced us to trap you with the World Idols. Not even the Vice Guild Leaders of other royal powers can receive such treatment from us.”

“So what if you’ve trapped us?” Hidden Soul said, looking at the four-armed, middle-aged man. “Do you think you can kill us with just the five of you?”

“Of course not.” The four-armed, middle-aged man laughed. “But it’s a different story if one of Evil Nature’s trump card legions comes here! Even if you have a Mortal God on your side, all of you will die here today!”

The faces of Hidden Soul and the other Zero Wing members sank at the four-armed, middle-aged man’s words.

If they had to fight one of Evil Nature’s trump card legions in this extremely unfavorable environment, their demise would be inevitable, even if they had Purgatory Jade. After all, if Purgatory Jade had to split her focus to resist the erosion of her mana, she would likely have trouble fighting experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

As Evil Nature was a royal power, each of its trump card legions was led by at least one expert fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. With the assistance of the World Idols, it would be easy for said expert to distract Purgatory Jade.

…

At the same time, over at Plot 066…

Two legions of Holy Race players stood in the central plaza of Plot 066, surrounded by piles of player corpses. These corpses numbered over 10,000 and belonged to players from over a dozen pseudo-apex powers.

“Commander Vocalist, we have already eliminated over 70% of the players in Plot 066,” a girl wearing Evil Nature’s Guild Emblem reported to a three-eyed young man carrying two moon glaives on his back. “Additionally, Team Demon has reported that their attack on Zero Wing failed and that Zero Wing’s sixth-floor expert killed Commander Demon. They have trapped Zero Wing’s team using the World Idols and are requesting reinforcements.”

“That old man lost?” Slumbering Vocalist, the three-eyed young man, laughed. “How interesting! I guess this is to be expected of a Mortal God.”

“Besides our Holy Hymn Legion, Commander Demon’s Holy Scorpion Legion has also received this news. Should we go, Commander Vocalist?” the girl asked.

“Of course! Why shouldn’t we?” Slumbering Vocalist said, grinning. “That’s a sixth-floor expert we are talking about. I also heard that Zero Wing’s Guild Leader defeated Garuda in the Continental Championship. This is my chance to prove that I have surpassed Garuda and become the Holy Race’s number one chosen one!”

“Understood! I will have everyone get ready immediately!” At Slumbering Vocalist’s words, the girl promptly mustered the members of the Holy Hymn Legion.

While the Holy Hymn Legion members gathered, Slumbering Vocalist turned to look at a three-eyed woman standing a short distance away. The woman in question was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts and wore the Sun Dynasty’s Guild Emblem.

“Daystar, you should have heard it, too, right? Interested in joining me?” Slumbering Vocalist asked in a playful tone. “I heard that you lost to Black Flame. This is a good opportunity to redeem yourself.”
