However, thanks to the Frostflame Sacred Dragon, she arrived above the resurrection camp in less than three minutes.

Edited:

However, thanks to the Frostflame Sacred Dragon, she arrived within 5,000 yards of the resurrection camp in less than three minutes.

When Frey appeared on the battlefield, everyone stopped what they were doing and turned to her in unison. Even the savage young man, the leader of the Ominous Cavalry, paused to look at her.

“Hooray! The Vice Guild Leader is here!”

“Let’s see how Mad God can continue doing as he likes!”

“Vice Guild Leader Frey is 65th on the Eternal Chosen One Ranking List, while Solitary Mad God is only 82nd! He’ll definitely lose to Vice Guild Leader Frey in a direct confrontation!”

Admiration and reverence colored the eyes of the Red Dragon Nation’s members as they looked at Frey. It was as if she were the overlord of this region; nobody could resist her.

“I hadn’t expected the famous Netherworld Queen to use a Tier 6 Teleportation Scroll to meet me in person. I’m truly honored,” Solitary Mad God said, staring at Frey, who exuded an aura no weaker than that of Ancient Gods of the same level. “I was originally hoping to force the 51st-ranked Black Flame to face me, but since you showed up, I’ll test my strength on you first!”

After saying so, Solitary Mad God merged with his Mountain Devourer, a Tier 6 Advanced Extraordinary Flying Mount, transformed into a 1,000-meter-tall, four-armed giant, and punched at Frey.

Despite throwing only one punch, Solitary Mad God’s fist split into a hundred afterimages midway through, each carrying the power of a Level 230 Ancient God’s attack. This attack was clearly a Peak Gold Holy Art, and the sight of it shocked the Level 235 elite experts who had clashed with Solitary Mad God before. Never had they imagined that Solitary Mad God hadn’t been fighting them with his full strength just now.

“Arrogance!”

When Frey saw Solitary Mad God attacking her, she waved her weapon Nethersoul and created two threefold Tier 6 magic arrays under herself. Of the two magic arrays, one created a barrier that blocked all of Solitary Mad God’s punches, while the other called down hundreds of pitch-black Soul Spears on Solitary Mad God himself. Each Soul Spear carried power at the Tier 6 Limit standard, no weaker than Solitary Mad God’s punches.

However, Solitary Mad God was not one to be beaten. He threw two punches into the sky in rapid succession, striking down every Soul Spear and turning the sky into an empty void.

As neither side could get the upper hand, their fight quickly turned into a stalemate. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Eternal Chosen One Ranking List? What is that?” Shi Feng was confused when he overheard the conversations of the Red Dragon Nation and Azure Fang members.

Seeing Shi Feng’s confusion, Blue Phoenix explained, “It’s a ranking list that the Holy Race came up with recently. It records the younger-generation experts of the three races, and only those under 50 can enter it. But unlike the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Divine Glory List, it only records a hundred players. It also judges players solely on their strength and age; talent doesn’t matter.”

“A ranking list for the three races’ younger-generation experts?” Shi Feng was surprised to hear this. He had never heard of the Eternal Chosen One Ranking List in his previous life. There had never been a ranking list for the three races’ experts, either. Each race only bothered to rank its own experts.

“Mhm. You are ranked 51st on the list, Guild Leader, while Vice Guild Leader Frey’s rank rose to 65th two days ago after she fought the Thunder Empire’s Garuda and survived several dozen moves against him. As for Solitary Mad God, he replaced the Sun Dynasty’s Holy Blood as 82nd on the list after defeating the other party,” Blue Phoenix said. Then, she sighed, “Currently, the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s experts dominate the list. The human race doesn’t even have 20 players on it.

“Fortunately, there are sixth-floor experts like Big Sis Frost to hold the line for us, so we have seven players in the top 30.”

“Seven? Did someone else reach the sixth-floor standard?” Shi Feng asked. As he ranked sixth on the Divine Glory List, he hadn’t expected seven players to be ahead of him on the Eternal Chosen One Ranking List. Moreover, all seven players were Mortal Gods, judging by Blue Phoenix’s words.

“Azure Fang’s Aurebeth achieved a breakthrough when fighting the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s chosen ones not long ago. Besides her, another expert named Mourning Tone also achieved a breakthrough after numerous battles,” Blue Phoenix explained enviously.

Now that the war among the three races had begun, the various powers of each race were either ambushing the enemy’s NPC armies or assisting their side’s NPC armies. Whenever an NPC City was involved in a battle, there would even be hundreds of thousands of Tier 6 NPCs and over ten million Tier 6 players participating, resulting in grand spectacles that could normally only be found in Realm Wars.

As the three races’ various powers treated these siege battles as a place to nurture their chosen ones, they had all tacitly agreed to limit the experts they mobilized to under Level 235. This created many opportunities for the participants of these siege battles to fight chosen ones and geniuses, achieving unprecedented growth. The training effects of these siege battles overshadowed even that of the Tower of the Abyss.

Because of this, the various powers were doing everything they could to transfer more of their geniuses from their respective Greater God’s Domains into the Eternal Realm.

Unfortunately, as Zero Wing was busy defending its territories, its members did not have the opportunity to participate in these battles.

Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised to hear that more players had achieved a breakthrough thanks to the war. After all, this was a common occurrence in the war between the human race and the Holy Race in his previous life.

If fifth-floor experts relied only on themselves to improve, it would be incredibly difficult for them to reach the sixth-floor standard. Even if they could eventually succeed, it’d take them a lot of time. But if they could freely fight against other geniuses, they’d have a much easier time achieving a breakthrough. Only, such opportunities were incredibly rare. Now that the war among the three races provided players with such an opportunity, it was only natural for the birth of sixth-floor experts to be accelerated.

…

As Shi Feng and Blue Phoenix chatted, the Frostflame Sacred Dragon arrived above the resurrection camp, its massive frame casting a shadow over the camp. Immediately afterward, Shi Feng and Blue Phoenix jumped off its back and entered everyone’s sight.

“Boss Mad God! That person seems to be Black Flame!” Half Night, the vice commander of the Ominous Cavalry adventurer team, said to Solitary Mad God. “Should we retreat now?”

Following Shi Feng’s arrival, their opponents would have two experts on the Eternal Chosen One Ranking List. Should Shi Feng and Frey join forces, the Ominous Cavalry would be in a tight spot.

“We will retreat, but first, let me see if Black Flame is as strong as Daystar says!”

Solitary Mad God’s eyes burned with intense fighting spirit as he stared at Shi Feng. Immediately, he threw all four fists at Shi Feng, the four fists merging to create a colossal fist that shattered everything in its path. Even time and space were not spared. The attack was much stronger than anything he had used against Frey thus far.
