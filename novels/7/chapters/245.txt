Chapter 246 - Neither Weak nor Strong

“Success on the first attempt? It seems my luck really is good.” Shi Feng revealed a faint smile when he heard the system notification sound.

Along with the Arclight Shield’s promotion to Dark-Gold rank, a change occurred to its name as well.

Shi Feng then started inspecting the silver-colored, crescent-shaped shield that was placed on the iron-weave felt. He was extremely curious to find out just what sort of Attributes the Arclight Guard possessed.

[Arclight Guard] (Shield, Dark-Gold Rank)

Additional Passive Skill 1-

Sound of Life: Every attack received will grant user with a stack of Power of Life, increasing maximum HP by 3% and received healing by 2% for 1 minute. Maximum of 10 stacks.

Additional Passive Skill 2-

Refraction: Triggers once every 25 seconds. Becomes immune to one attack.

Additional Skill-

Time Arc: When activated, allows the user to save current state, and return to saved state 9 seconds later.

Cooldown: 10 minutes

“Isn’t this Time Arc skill overpowered?! No wonder there wasn’t much of an improvement on the other Attributes. Just this skill alone made the Arclight Guard deserving of being a Dark-Gold ranked shield,” Shi Feng exclaimed.

Saving current state, which was to say, after nine seconds, even if the user of the Arclight Guard died, they would still recover to their saved state. The Cooldown of skills used after Time Arc was invoked would recover as well. Compared to a skill that provided invincibility, Time Arc was a much more amazing skill. The only downside to this skill was its long Cooldown. However, when taking into consideration the heaven-defying effect of this skill, a 10-minute Cooldown was considerably short. If the Cooldown of this skill was any shorter, then the Arclight Guard would no longer be just a Dark-Gold ranked shield, but an Epic ranked shield instead.

Although Shi Feng had already made one Arclight Guard, he was still not satisfied; he wished to make even more Arclight Guards.

Deciding so, he used up the remaining four pieces of Runic Gold when forging the Arclight Shields. However, the results were horrible. Out of his four attempts, two were complete failures; they did not even achieve Bronze rank. As for the remaining two Arclight Shields, one achieved Secret-Silver rank, while the other achieved Fine-Gold rank.

However, such a success rate was already very good. He had used a total of five Runic Gold to forge the Arclight Shields. Among them, one had achieved Dark-Gold rank, one had achieved Fine-Gold rank, and one had achieved Secret-Silver rank. Out of the three shields, Shi Feng would naturally save the Dark-Gold ranked Arclight Guard for Cola’s use. With the Arclight Guard, they would have no problems raiding the Level 15, 20-man Team Dungeon, the Demon’s Castle.

Just as Shi Feng thought of carrying on with forging Arclight Shields, someone knocked on the door of the Forging Room.

“Come in.”

When the door to the Forging Room opened, a golden-haired beauty walked in. This person was none other than Shi Feng’s assistant, Anna.

“Your Excellency, an adventurer named Aqua Rose wishes to meet you. She says she has an appointment with you, and she is currently waiting in the meeting room on the third floor,” Anna said respectfully.

“Alright, I’ll be there in a minute,” Shi Feng nodded his head.

Shi Feng had similarly guessed that Aqua Rose should arrive right about now. After all, teleportation occurred instantaneously. Aqua Rose only needed to gather her subordinates, explain to them the situation, and make some future plans.

---

Inside the meeting room on the third floor, Aqua Rose and her hundred-plus subordinates were seated around the room, having a small discussion about matters relating to Shi Feng.

These players all had relatively high Levels. The lowest out of all of them was Level 13, while the others were Level 14. Even if placed inside a first-rate Guild, all these players would be considered elite members.

These players were all Aqua Rose’s most trusted aides.

Before they had arrived here, they hadn’t dared to imagine that there would actually be someone willing to spend 300 Gold Coins to bring them to this place. If the organization this person belonged to wasn’t extremely rich, then this person was just insane!

However, after they discovered that Shi Feng actually had a connection with such a large trading firm, their thoughts immediately changed. Not only did Shi Feng manage to achieve something that no other Guild had achieved, his fame in the entire Star-Moon Kingdom could already be described as the sun in midday.

It was especially true for the recently popular Basic Mana Armor Kit. This was an item that plenty of Guilds could only dream of having.

If they could be a part of the power Shi Feng belonged to, then couldn’t every one of them obtain their very own Basic Mana Armor Kit? This was definitely a treatment that no other first-rate Guild could provide.

“Big Sis Aqua, just who is that Black Flame? Is he in the upper management of a Super Guild?” a female Swordsman curiously asked.

Aqua Rose shook her head, a bitter smile on her face as she replied, “I don’t know, either. He has always been very mysterious. However, I believe that we will be able to find out his true identity today.”

In truth, Aqua Rose was also interested in finding out the truth. However, now that they were going to join the power Black Flame belonged to, Black Flame would have no need to hide the truth from them. They could finally take a look at the giant hidden behind Shi Feng.

“Sorry to keep all of you waiting.”

The moment Shi Feng walked into the meeting room, everyone inside immediately fell silent. Everyone present stood up as they looked at Shi Feng, deep veneration in their eyes. They were like interviewees standing up to welcome their interviewer; some were nervous, while some were excited.

After leaving Twilight Echo, they were like homeless little birds. Although they wished to soar higher into the sky, they did not possess a home they could return to. Feelings of helplessness and disappointment constantly filled their minds as they wondered what sort of future awaited them.

However, the situation was different now. They would be joining an even greater family now. At this moment, these ex-members of Twilight Echo rejoiced over the fact that they had chosen to leave Twilight Echo together with Aqua Rose, praising themselves for making a wise decision.

After all, a bright future had already opened its doors to them!

“I am the one who should be sorry for making Master Black Flame wait for us for so long,” Aqua Rose apologized.

“Since we will be companions in the future, stop referring me as Master this or Master that. Just call me Black Flame.” Shi Feng could sense the cautiousness behind Aqua Rose and everyone else’s actions. However, this was to be expected. “I have only asked you all to come here so that I can invite everyone into the Guild first. Later on, Miss Aqua can freely decide how you all wish to develop yourselves. I won’t set any restrictions for you. Right, here is a copy of the White River City Guidebook. After you are done reading it, you should be able to familiarize yourself with White River City, Miss Aqua.”

Saying so, Shi Feng sent a copy of the luxury version White River City Guidebook to Aqua Rose. Simultaneously, he had sent everyone present a Guild invitation.

“Zero Wing?”

“What is this Guild?”

“Why is it only a 1-Star Guild? Wasn’t it supposed to be some sort of hidden power?”

Everyone entered a daze for a long time after they received Shi Feng’s Guild invitation. Ignoring the fact that they had never even heard of such a Guild, just having status of a 1-Star Guild showed how weak Zero Wing was. The reason being, even third-rate Guilds at this stage of the game were 3-Star Guilds, not to mention first-rate Guilds.

After taking a look at the member count of the Guild, everyone was further dumbfounded.

Before they had joined, this Guild only had nine members? What kind of Guild was this?

Zero Wing was the weakest Guild they had seen so far, second to none.

Even Aqua Rose herself was shocked by this revelation. The current situation was completely different from what she had imagined it to be. She had thought Shi Feng would be bringing her to meet the many great characters of this Guild, allowing her to get a grasp on the frightening background of the Guild. Yet, the truth that Shi Feng revealed had far exceeded her expectations.

The reason being, the influence of this Guild could literally be determined in a single glance.

“You all must be very disappointed to find out that my Guild is actually so weak, right?” Shi Feng looked at everyone’s crestfallen expressions. Suddenly, he said in a cold voice, “Let me give it to you straight. This, this is Zero Wing. It is neither weak, nor strong. It is merely a home that you can stay in. As for how others are going to view us, it will depend on your own performances.”
