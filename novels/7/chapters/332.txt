Chapter 333 - Hidden Class

“Magic Weapon?” Cola did not quite understand Shi Feng’s words.

Violet Cloud was confused as well. Shifting her gaze to Shi Feng, she hoped to find out from Shi Feng what a Magic Weapon was.

It was their first time hearing the term “Magic Weapon.”

“A Magic Weapon isn’t an orthodox weapon. You can think of it as a double-edged sword of tremendous power. It can either raise a player’s combat power to frightening heights, or completely ruin them,” Shi Feng explained, smiling. He had naturally noticed the two’s interest.

Shi Feng had never revealed the secret of the Abyssal Blade to others. Aside from Blackie and Lonely Snow, nobody else in the Guild knew about it. Matters regarding Magic Weapons were of utmost importance. Compared to Blackie’s Epic ranked staff, Magic Weapons were much more precious. After all, they were weapons capable of rivaling Legendary Weapons.

Had it been possible, Shi Feng would have wished that the Abyssal Blade in his hands could become an Epic Weapon instead of a Magic Weapon. Although his combat power would have decreased significantly, he would not have to worry about the Abyssal Blade’s backlash.

Although Shi Feng had never personally witnessed the result of a backlash, he had still heard rumors about it. In the past, many first-rate experts had been devoured by their own Magic Weapons. After suffering the backlash, these first-rate experts had no choice but to delete their accounts and start all over again. Such a heavy price frightened even Shi Feng. Currently, he had no other choice but to continuously improve himself—in both combat techniques and combat power—in order to face the future backlash.

“So it turns out that Magic Weapons are so amazing. But, Guild Leader, is there even a class that uses a key as a weapon? None of the twelve main classes in God’s Domain that I know of uses a key as a weapon,” Cola asked.

“There is. However, it is a hidden class,” Shi Feng answered.

“Hidden class? So there really are hidden classes in God’s Domain? Then, aren’t hidden classes very amazing? Guild Leader, is it possible for us to switch to a hidden class?” Cola’s trust in Shi Feng had long since reached the level of blind faith. He did not had a shred of doubt about Shi Feng’s words. If Shi Feng said hidden classes existed in God’s Domain, then, to Cola, these definitely existed in God’s Domain. Even if there weren’t any hidden classes, Cola would still believe that there were.

“Big Brother Cola, what are you getting so anxious for? You should let Guild Leader finish speaking first.” Violet Cloud was also very interested in regard to hidden classes.

Seeing his two party members looking at him with such fervent eyes, Shi Feng could not help but laugh, saying, “This hidden class is called Astromancer and it can be considered a branch of the mage classes. Any mage or healer class can convert to an Astromancer. The minimum requirement is that you must first reach Level 20. More importantly, you must also receive and complete the Class Change Quest for the hidden class.

“Meanwhile, this key is very special. Not only is it a weapon, it is also a tool meant for triggering the Class Change Quest for the hidden class. You just need to bring this key to White River City and you’ll automatically receive the Hidden Class Change Quest.”

“Guild Leader, is an Astromancer strong? Can I still continue healing after I become an Astromancer?”

Violet Cloud was suddenly excited. As Zero Wing developed, the number of battles the Guild would be involved in would increase. Although she loved being a Cleric, the things she could do were clearly limited. After all, when all was said and done, a Cleric was not a combat-oriented class. Violet Cloud dearly wanted to fight as well. She did not wish to always stand in the rear and receive the protection of others.

“Although it is called a hidden class, you’re not exactly going to be changing to an entirely different class. It is more like having extra unique class skills. You will simply be gaining an additional skill set that does not belong to your original class. The downside to this is that you will take several times longer to level up, compared to normal classes. Moreover, it won’t be an easy task to learn the system skills of a hidden class. Simply put, your life will become much harder after converting to a hidden class,” Shi Feng explained.

“In addition, Astromancer isn’t a class suitable for the average player. The controls involved are very complicated, and the control difficulty is at least two to three times that of a normal mage class. If an ordinary player were to convert into an Astromancer, they might find themselves losing fights to opponents that they had managed to defeat in the past. On the other hand, if you successfully master the class, even if you meet someone who had become much more powerful than they were in the past, you can still beat them up until their mothers no longer recognize them. Overall, Astromancer could be considered a very extreme hidden class.”

Seeing Violet Cloud’s passionate gaze, Shi Feng asked, “Do you wish to convert to this hidden class?”

“Uhm. I don’t want to always stay at the back and heal. I want to be the same as Big Sis Fire Dance and Big Sis Aqua. I want to be able to fight enemies at the frontlines as well.” Violet Cloud nodded. She then looked at Shi Feng and asked timidly, “Guild Leader, can you please let me have this hidden class?”

Violet Cloud knew that she was being selfish. After all, she did not obtain this key by herself. Moreover, countless others in the Guild would be willing to fight over a hidden class. There were also powerful mage experts such as Aqua Rose, Ice Queen Su Qianliu, Blackie, and many others in the Guild. If they were to change classes into an Astromancer, they could greatly increase the Guild’s strength. There was simply no place for a healer like her.

However, she wished to contribute more to the Guild.

Cola’s mouth widened in shock when he heard Violet Cloud speak. He had not expected the usually quiet and lovely Violet Cloud to make such a bold move.

“This...” Shi Feng wrinkled his sharp brows, entering a deep contemplation.

Looking at Shi Feng’s grave expression, Violet Cloud could not help but start panicking.

“Guild Leader, Violet’s control and techniques are definitely first-rate! Even I am no match for her! Won’t you consider giving her a chance?” Cola voiced his opinion.

After thinking it over for a while, Shi Feng seriously looked at Violet Cloud, saying, “I’m not forbidding you to convert your class into an Astromancer. Only, this key is slightly troublesome. If you use this key to convert your class into an Astromancer, your path will be fraught with an endless amount of trouble in the future. You might even ruin your account. All your efforts would go down the drain. At that time, while everyone is over Level 100, you will have to start from scratch. Do you really have the courage and determination to do so?”

In fact, Shi Feng had no doubts in regard to Violet Cloud’s control and techniques. If Shi Feng did not possess ten years’ worth of experience playing God’s Domain, Violet Cloud might have already surpassed him by now.

Based on Violet Cloud’s standards, she might immediately become one of Zero Wing’s top combatants once she was an Astromancer. Shi Feng would naturally feel happy over this matter.

Yet, what he had in his hand right now was a Magic Weapon. If the weapon were a Legendary Weapon and not a Magic Weapon, he would willingly give it to Violet Cloud without hesitation as long as she wanted it. A Magic Weapon, on the other hand, had pros and cons that Shi Feng was very clear about. As long as a player unsealed a Magic Weapon and became its controller, then they would inevitably have to face the backlash of the Magic Weapon one day. Based on the current situation, the disadvantages of giving Violet Cloud the Magic Weapon greatly outweighed the advantages. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Most importantly, not every player could handle the pressure of having to start all over again.

“Guild Leader, I’m not afraid of trouble. I only hope that I can do more for the Guild. Even if I end up back in square one because of this item, I will have no regrets. At the very least, I would have contributed greatly towards the Guild’s current development.” Violet Cloud looked at Shi Feng, her eyes shining with conviction.

Faced with Violet Cloud’s gaze, Shi Feng abruptly recalled how he had been back then, and burst out in sudden laughter.

“That’s right! What’s there to be afraid of? It’s just a restart at worst!” The worry that filled Shi Feng’s heart disappeared. He then handed the key to Violet Cloud. “This key is still sealed. After returning to White River City, go look for someone who can unseal it. After it is unsealed, you will automatically receive the Tier 1 Hidden Class Change Quest.”

“Thank you, Guild Leader! I definitely won’t let you down!” Violet Cloud sincerely thanked Shi Feng as she excitedly received the purple-gold key.
