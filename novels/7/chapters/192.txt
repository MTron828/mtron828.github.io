Chapter 193 - Holy Grail Knights

When Shi Feng arrived at the location Stabbing Heart had provided, he couldn’t even find a shadow of Martial Union.

“Where are they?” Shi Feng surveyed his surroundings. Aside from a dozen or so Three-tailed Scorpions, not a single player occupied this flat, sandy area. “Was there an error in the information Stabbing Heart gave me?”

Shi Feng thought the possibility of such an error was low. After all, the Assassin’s Alliance was a top-tier, second-rate Guild; there shouldn’t be any significant errors in their information gathering. Moreover, Stabbing Heart had been so confident in providing the information, so he must have had a basis for his confidence.

“Forget it. I didn’t have much hope of finding them immediately in any case,” since Shi Feng was not in a hurry, he started searching around the surrounding area. If Martial Union had already entered White River City, Stabbing Heart would have notified him at the first notice. However, there was not a huge possibility for Martial Union to enter White River City right now as even Stabbing Heart’s team had yet to enter the city.

Time passed, little by little.

More and more players reached Level 10, each of them entering White River City, one after another.

Right now, the majority of the players who entered White River City were the elites and upper echelons of Guilds. There was only a small amount of teams consisting of independent players.

Most of these independent players had purchased the White River City Guidebook, and they all admired its creator.

“Leader, this Ye Feng is truly amazing. The information he wrote in this Guidebook is so detailed. Fortunately, we bought the luxury version. The introductions in the simplified version were overly brief, and it only helps one get a general understanding of White River City. Meanwhile, the luxury version mentioned plenty of locations with good quests meant for specific classes. Thanks to it, I’ve accepted plenty of valuable quests.”

“I know, right? It is all thanks to team leader’s wisdom for buying the luxury version. If I didn’t know that Ye Feng had personally penned this guidebook, I would even think that the game officials had published it. I really wonder what Ye Feng’s previous profession was to possess such powerful observation skills.”

“That Ye Feng indeed has some skills. Originally, I had simply intended to purchase the guidebook as a reference; I never thought that the information was all true. I was shocked after we arrived at White River City. It was worth the 20,000 Credits. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t willingly sell this information even for 50,000 Credits. Not only does the information require time to arrange, but this is also first-hand information. I can’t imagine why Ye Feng would willingly sell all of this for only 20,000 Credits.”

In front of the Teleportation Hall of White River City, a non-Guild team consisting of ten-plus elite players happily chatted while waiting for their other companions.

“Hmm? An independent team?”

At this moment, Gentle Snow emerged from a Teleportation Gate, spotting this merry team of players. She felt slightly surprised by the sight. At this time, aside from those elite teams of large Guilds, there was even an independent team who had reached White River City. This was an extremely rare sight, and it illustrated this team’s strength.

“I know who they are. Five years ago, these players were very famous in a relatively sizeable virtual reality game. They were known as the Holy Grail Knights at that time.

“Although they aren’t a Guild, and their numbers never exceeded a hundred players, every member of their team was extremely skilled. Their battle prowess was extremely frightening. Their leader, War Wolf, even had the reputation as the strongest Warrior in the game. During those days, not a single Guild in the game that dared provoke them. However, for reasons unknown, their team disbanded, and plenty of their members stopped playing the game.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“The remaining players then went on to become the upper echelons or core members of first-rate and second-rate Guilds. The Holy Grail Knights is a legend of sorts in the virtual gaming world now.”

When the Shield Warrior, Ghost Chop, who was knowledgeable about these independent players saw the average-looking Shield Warrior standing amidst those players, his expression suddenly turned solemn. This person was indeed War Wolf, the past team leader of the Holy Grail Knights. Back in those days, Ghost Chop had admired and respected this man; thus, he chose to play as a Shield Warrior as well. He then turned to Gentle Snow, slowly starting his recollection.

“I see,” Gentle Snow could not help but notice War Wolf.

Five years ago, she had yet to experience virtual reality games. Hence, she did not know that such a person had existed.

“Snow, are you thinking of recruiting him into Ouroboros?” Zhao Yueru asked with a smile when she noticed Gentle Snow’s moved expression.

“Although this person seemed to lack spirit at first glance, he seemed as deep and profound as an ocean at the same time. Moreover, the equipment he’s wearing is all Mysterious-Iron rank, though his weapon slightly lacks as it is not Secret-Silver rank. However, it should be extremely difficult for an independent team to have such a geared Shield Warrior, so it clearly displays how powerful the members of this team are. Meanwhile, a team leader capable of leading such a team is not a simple character. If we can recruit him, it should be of great help to our future Dungeon raids,” Gentle Snow did not directly deny Zhao Yueru’s question. Her previous intentions of recruiting Shi Feng as a subordinate were already dashed.

Unfortunately, she could not see through Shi Feng, as Shi Feng’s entire being was shrouded in mystery. The guidebook he had sold her further solidified this fact. She was greatly shocked when she arrived at White River City. Using the luxury version of the guidebook as a comparison, Gentle Snow came to fully understand the value of the exclusive guidebook Shi Feng had sold to her.

If the other first-rate Guilds discovered this guidebook, they might even start an all-out war with Ouroboros to snatch it away. Gentle Snow had estimated the true value of this guidebook to be five million Credits or more.

After all, within the super-luxury guidebook, there was information pertaining to the problems one would usually face when developing a Guild. The guidebook also touched on the topic of how to develop and strengthen a Guild. Moreover, it mentioned the daily quests available that could raise a person’s reputation in White River City. Such information could allow them to surpass the other Guilds greatly, and that was not something that could be purchased with a measly five million Credits.

Even now, Gentle Snow did not dare reveal this information to any other person; she did not wish to bring a calamity upon herself.

Due to this reason, Gentle Snow had become fully aware of just how much of a danger Shi Feng was. If she was already in so much danger just by becoming friends with him, what kind of consequences would she have to face if she accepted him as her subordinate? Gentle Snow no longer dared dwell on the consequences.

Shi Feng’s provocation of tens of Guilds presented a prime example. Fortunately, they were all unrated Guilds as the leveling secret did not hold much attraction to the true major Guilds. After all, the upper echelons of these Guilds knew many secrets, and they had a great understanding of God’s Domain. These Guilds were much stronger than those half-assed, unrated Guilds.

There were no bugs in God’s Domain. Even if there were one, the system would discover and correct it immediately. If there truly were a leveling secret, the only possibility was killing monsters of a higher level or carrying out high-level quests to obtain massive amounts of EXP.

Only experts or players with exceptional equipment could achieve the former.

As for the latter, it was clearly an unrepeatable situation because such high-level quests would have great limitations and rarity; not everybody could receive such quests. They might even be Rare or Unique Quests.

Thus, all of the rated Guilds did not have a particular interest in this secret that was not really a secret. On the contrary, they were much more interested in the White River City Guidebook. However, since Shi Feng had wisely offered the information for sale, these rated Guilds would naturally not look for trouble with Shi Feng. They also did not have so much time on their hands, unlike those half-assed Guilds.

Shi Feng belonged to a category of people so intimidating that they possessed few friends. To put it another way, without sufficient strength, friendship with Shi Feng was an extremely dangerous endeavor. As for the War Wolf before her, there was not much danger in building a friendship with such a person. Moreover, with such great strength, it would be an utter loss not to recruit him.

“Go. Let’s go and strike up a conversation with them, then,” seeing that all the members of her team were already present, she opened her mouth and spoke.
