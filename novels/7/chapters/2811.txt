Chapter 2812 – Storm Brewing at the Residence

Sky Spring City, Starlink’s Residence:

At this time, Tier 3 experts were thronging to Starlink’s Residence, which occupied an area equivalent to two sports stadiums.

Before Shi Feng’s group of three could arrive at the entrance of Starlink’s Residence, they saw the players crowding the main street stepping aside and opening a path for a 100-man team.

All the members of this 100-man team were at least a Level 125, Tier 3 expert. They were also equipped with Level 120 Dark-Gold Equipment and two or three pieces of Epic Equipment.

The two people walking in the head of this team were even more eye-catching. Not only were they equipped with six or more pieces of Epic Equipment each, but both of them were actually Tier 4 players. One of them was a Level 129 Berserker Emperor, while the other was a Level 130 Sword Emperor. Just seeing their gear, levels, and tier made the surrounding players sigh in fascination. “Crap! Who are these people? Why haven’t I seen that Guild Emblem before?”

“You don’t know? They’re from a Guild called Hundred Ghosts, an incredibly mysterious Guild that appeared recently. I heard that it has an incredible origin. Although the Guild has very few members, every one of them is an expert at Tier 3 or higher.”

“That’s right. That man and woman you see leading them are especially amazing. Before they got promoted to Tier 4, they secretly challenged the various superpowers’ monsters and won 49 out of 49 challenges. I never thought that those two would get promoted to Tier 4 after disappearing from the public eye for some time.”

“If they already had an undefeated record before reaching Tier 4, doesn’t this make them nigh-invincible now that they’ve reached Tier 4?”

The surrounding players held heated discussions over Hundred Ghosts’s 100-man team. Simultaneously, they couldn’t help admiring Starlink. Hundred Ghosts was a Guild that did as it pleased. It did not show respect to any superpower, yet it had actually accepted the invitation to participate in Starlink’s crusade.

Hundred Ghosts? Shi Feng was slightly surprised when he overheard the surrounding players’ conversations.

In the past, he had heard a little of the Guild known as Hundred Ghosts. The Guild had been an incredibly mysterious existence even back then. Moreover, it had revealed itself to the public three years after the game’s launch, shortly after the first major system update. The moment this Guild made its existence known to the world, it had shaken the entire God’s Domain.

This was because Hundred Ghosts had actually had over 30 Tier 4 experts at the time. Back then, even the superpowers only had around 30 Tier 4 experts, with stronger ones having around 40.

In addition, after Hundred Ghosts made its public appearance, the Guild’s Tier 4 experts began frenziedly challenging the various superpowers and took the continent by storm.

However, for some reason, after Hundred Ghosts had finished challenging the various superpowers and proving its strength, it suddenly went silent. The next time it appeared, the Guild already had Tier 5 experts and began challenging the Five Great Super Guilds.

Despite having the ability to challenge the Five Great Super Guilds, Hundred Ghosts did not possess even a single Guild Residence on the main continent. The Guild did not compete for resources, either. The only thing the Guild did was do combat. This situation had given the Five Great Super Guilds headaches back then. After all, the Hundred Ghosts Guild was simply too mysterious. It did not have any roots, so it was impossible to target the Guild’s base of operations. On the other hand, the number of Tier 5 experts the Guild had was not the slightest bit inferior to the Five Great Super Guilds’.

In this life, God’s Domain’s first major system update had taken place two years ahead of time. And Hundred Ghosts had also appeared two years ahead of time. This situation put Shi Feng in a reverie.

Could they be a Guild from an Interstellar Continent?

If it were before he had visited the ancient God’s Domain, he probably wouldn’t have any idea how such a strange Guild could appear out of nowhere. However, after visiting the ancient era, he understood that God’s Domain housed players not just from Earth but from the several Interstellar Continents as well.

Just like the ancient God’s Domain, Hundred Ghosts could be from another version of God’s Domain, only this version of God’s Domain overlapped with the modern God’s Domain much more closely than the ancient God’s Domain. Hence, Hundred Ghosts could bring so many players to the modern God’s Domain.

In fact, Shi Feng even suspected that the mysterious area Lifeless Thorn and the others fell into previously was Hundred Ghosts’s home world. However, Lifeless Thorn and the others had been repatriated to the modern God’s Domain before they could learn much about this other version of God’s Domain.

This would also explain why Hundred Ghosts’s members gave off a similar, but more subdued, sense of abnormality as the ancient God’s Domain’s players.

Another thing that surprised Shi Feng was that Starlink had actually managed to connect with Hundred Ghosts. This never happened in Shi Feng’s previous life.

“Now that so many powers are gathered, I’m afraid Zero Wing will have it tough later.”

“I know, right? The experts from Starlink, Miracle, and the other superpowers aside, just the number of experts gathered here is still more than enough to make Zero Wing suffer.” “I wonder if Zero Wing even dares come? Starlink has obviously set up a trap.”

“I doubt it will. Since this is Starlink’s Residence, even if Starlink’s experts take action inside, the city’s NPC soldiers won’t care at all. Zero Wing’s experts can only rely on themselves.”

The players on the main street couldn’t help worrying for Zero Wing, Unyielding Soul, and Crimson Emperor as they watched the various powers’ experts enter Starlink’s Residence one after another.

Although Zero Wing had the home ground advantage in Sky Spring City, how could the three Guilds possibly beat more than 20 superpowers when it came to expert count? Not to mention, a bunch of experts from the various major powers had also come to support Starlink.

If it came down to a fight, the three Guilds wouldn’t stand a chance at all.

So long as the three Guilds’ experts dared show up, only death would await them.

Yet, if the three Guilds did not show up, their reputation would most likely go down the drain. After all, if news of this matter spread, everyone would definitely think that the three Guilds have grown timid. If the three Guilds didn’t even dare accept a challenge, their aim of becoming titans in God’s Domain was an utter joke.

While the rubberneckers were conversing among themselves, a team of several dozen players suddenly appeared on one end of the main street, their arrival startling the gathered crowd.

This was because these players were members of the three Guilds. Leading this team of players were none other than Fire Dance, Unyielding Soul, and Illusory Words. Moreover, aside from these three, there was actually another Tier 4 expert with them. The aura this fourth Tier 4 player released was so terrifying that the gathered crowd gasped reflexively. “What?! Another person from Zero Wing reached Tier 4?!”

“That person should be Violet Cloud, right? The feeling she is giving off is completely different from before!”

Everyone fell into a daze as they looked at the lithe figure standing at the head of the three Guilds’ team.

Violet Cloud wore a mage’s robe that resembled the starry night sky, and she had her hair tied into a ponytail with a matching ribbon. She looked nothing like a sacred Cleric but more like a wise and pure goddess. Her level had even reached 131, which was higher than any other Tier 4 player they had seen thus far.

Shortly afterward, Violet Cloud and the other members of the three Guilds arrived at the entrance of Starlink’s Residence.

As if expecting their arrival, Lu Xingluo and his entourage appeared at the entrance at this time. Compared to Zero Wing’s group, Lu Xingluo had five Tier 4 players on his side, of which two were from Miracle; that was one more Tier 4 player than his side had previously.

The new addition was Miracle’s Sword Freak, Miracle Dragon. At this time, Miracle Dragon had already reached Level 130, and the oppressive aura he exuded was not much inferior to Violet Cloud’s.

Looking at Lu Xingluo, Illusory Words said coldly. “Lu Xingluo, we’ve come. You can let them go now!”

“Your courage is praiseworthy, Vice Guild Leader Illusory. However, I’ve changed my mind.” Smiling nonchalantly, Lu Xingluo said, “We went to great lengths to capture these people. If we just let them go so easily, wouldn’t we superpowers suffer a hit to our reputations?

“How about we have a match in the Residence? If you win, you can take them and leave. If you lose, all of you stay here. Do you three Guilds dare accept this challenge?”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
