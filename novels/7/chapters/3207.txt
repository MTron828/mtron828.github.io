Chapter 282 – Tier 4 Team?

“Am I dreaming?”

Crow Feather, the Cleric of the Gray Goose Team, gaped in shock when she saw Zero Wing’s team walking down the harbor and the surrounding players subconsciously stepping aside to make way for the team.

Players on a busy street wouldn’t make way for others out of politeness.

There was only one reason these players would behave in such a way.

Fear!

This was because every player in Zero Wing’s 100-man team was not only of a higher race, but every one of them also radiated an aura comparable to Mythic monsters of the same level.

When the Guardian Knight from the Gray Goose Team saw Zero Wing’s team walking in their team’s direction, he exclaimed, “Isn’t Zero Wing’s main force a little too strong? It’s practically comparable to the various hegemonic powers’ main force!”

“No.” Colorful Lunarite, the Gray Goose Team’s leader, shook her head in response to the Guardian Knight’s comment. Then, looking at Zero Wing’s team solemnly, she said, “If we are talking purely in terms of equipment standards, even the various hegemonic powers’ main forces are inferior to Zero Wing’s main force...”

“How is that possible, Team Leader?! The various hegemonic powers have fully equipped their main forces in eight-piece Epic Equipment Sets. Zero Wing couldn’t possibly have geared its main force members in Fragmented Legendary items, right?” Crow Feather said in disbelief.

Access to the Miniature Ancient World had only been opened not long ago, so eight-piece Epic Equipment Sets were already considered the best equipment players could get their hands on. Even the various hegemonic powers had only managed to get their hands on a few Fragmented Legendary items so far.

As for equipping an entire main force with Fragmented Legendary items, that was simply fantasy.

Crow Feather had learned about Zero Wing’s situation from Wu Xiaoxiao. Although Zero Wing had some powerful experts under its command, the Guild was terribly undersupplied when it came to weapons and equipment. It probably couldn’t even supply its main force members with six-piece Epic Equipment Sets like the various superpowers, let alone eight-piece Epic Equipment Sets.

“They aren’t equipped with Fragmented Legendary items.” Looking at Crow Feather with a bitter smile, Colorful Lunarite said, “But they are equipped with Immortal Sets. Six-piece Level 120 Fine-Gold Immortal Sets at that...”

“Fine-Gold Immortal Sets?” Crow Feather’s skepticism increased when she heard Colorful Lunarite’s words. “Are you trying to fool me, Team Leader? We are talking about Immortal Sets here. Even if it’s only a six-piece set at the Fine-Gold rank, it is still an Immortal Set. Not even the Greater God’s Domain’s hegemonic powers will dare to do something as extravagant as fully equipping an entire main force in Immortal Sets!”

A Fine-Gold Immortal Set might not be as valuable as a Fragmented Legendary item, but it was definitely rarer than Fragmented Legendary items. As for a Level 120 Fine-Gold Immortal Set, it was superior to even Level 120 Epic Equipment Sets when it came to Basic Attributes. In the current Miniature Ancient World, Crow Feather doubted that any of the various hegemonic powers had even one of such Immortal Sets.

Only a fool would believe that Zero Wing could take out 100 Fine-Gold Immortal Sets!

“You know I have the Judgment Eyes. There is no way I can be wrong in this,” Colorful Lunarite said definitively to Crow Feather.

In reality, Colorful Lunarite herself didn’t wish to believe this outcome. However, the information obtained by Judgment Eyes could not be wrong.

Of course, Colorful Lunarite could also understand Crow Feather’s inability to believe her words.

Hearing that an entire main force was fully equipped with Fine-Gold Immortal Sets was equally as shocking as hearing that every member of a main force was equipped with a Fragmented Legendary Weapon.

After all, these were Immortal Sets they were talking about!

Even upper-ranking hegemonic powers would cry tears of agony if they saw someone doing something as wasteful as equipping an entire 100-man team in Immortal Sets.

Immortal Equipment was different from Epic Equipment. A player geared in Immortal Equipment would not have to worry about engaging Mythic monsters in a melee. It was especially true for MTs. They could keep fighting for long periods without having to return to a city to get their equipment repaired.

Hence, whether a team possessed Immortal Equipment or not would affect its ability to grind and explore significantly.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, as per our agreement, we will lend this Bronze Warship to you for the next three days. The Gray Goose Team will also be assisting you throughout this period,” Colorful Lunarite said after seeing Shi Feng signing the God’s Domain Contract she had prepared. “Once these three days are up, we will collect the warship immediately, so I hope you can understand. As for the Greater World’s entry slots, Vice President Xia will have them ready in three days. However, exactly how many slots she can secure remains uncertain for now.”

“Three days?” Shi Feng nodded. Xia Qingying’s capabilities were much greater than he expected.

The World Passage had yet to activate, so traveling between their homeworld and the Greater World was incredibly troublesome. Even a Vice President of the Green God Corporation would have trouble acquiring entry slots into the Greater World. Originally, Shi Feng thought Xia Qingying would need around a week to secure the entry slots. So, it was certainly a pleasant surprise to hear that she only needed three days.

With this, the people he chose to bring to the Greater World would have more time to prepare for the Star Lake Legion’s selection, which would, in turn, increase their chances of getting into the city legion. If they could get into the city legion, they would become a real help to him in the Greater World, and he would have a much easier time carrying out his plans.

After Colorful Lunarite granted Shi Feng temporary authority to control the Bronze Warship, Shi Feng promptly set sail toward the destination he had decided on beforehand—the Bipolar Sea.

The Bipolar Sea was a Level 130 sea zone, and it contained the only Grade 1 ore vein Shi Feng had found using the Seven Luminaries Codex’s Elemental Search.

Grade 1 ore veins produced large amounts of Seven Luminaries Crystals, a highly demanded currency in the Greater World. One unit of Seven Luminaries Crystal could go for 100 hundred Star Coins in private transactions. One could say that Seven Luminaries Crystals were the primary method for powers in God’s Domain to strengthen themselves in the Greater World.

Even if Shi Feng managed to join the Star Lake Legion as an official participant, he would only receive a monthly salary of 10,000 Star Coins. Aside from the monthly salary, the only other way he could earn Star Coins reliably as an official participant was to lease out land. Moreover, the precondition for that was to not get targeted by a corporation. Otherwise, nobody would want to rent his land, and he would have no choice but to get by with only his standard salary.

Yet, if he relied only on his monthly salary, even staying in the God’s Domain Association would become a problem.

This was because the God’s Domain Association’s lower floors were in high demand but with low supply. Meanwhile, higher floors such as the 400th floor and above cost at least 2,000 Star Coins per day. If he were to rely only on his monthly salary, he’d be homeless before the week was even over, let alone purchase various potions to strengthen himself. Not to mention, his goal wasn’t only to survive by himself in the Greater World. He also needed to nurture other people in the Greater World, which would cost a significant amount of Star Coins...

Meanwhile, a Grade 1 ore vein was something that could spark a fight between several dozen hegemonic powers in the Greater God’s Domain. Even upper-ranking hegemonic powers would join in the fight if the vein wasn’t located too far from their base of power. One could easily imagine how much wealth a Grade 1 ore vein contained if it could tempt so many hegemonic powers into action.

Hence, Shi Feng naturally couldn’t let the Grade 1 ore vein he discovered go to waste.

A warship was much faster compared to an ordinary ship. A Bronze Warship’s speed was even comparable to a Bronze Mount’s speed. Because of this, the journey that originally required twenty hours of sailing took less than ten hours in the Bronze Warship.

Moreover, traveling in a Bronze Warship was also much safer. Several times, they encountered some Red Players who tried to rob them. However, these Red Players would quickly steer clear out of their path when they saw the opponent they were going up against. As for the sea monsters they encountered, the Bronze Warship could shake off even Mythic sea monsters with no trouble at all.

“The Bipolar Sea?” When Colorful Lunarite saw the tornadoes that covered the sea ahead of her, she couldn’t help but turn toward Shi Feng, who was steering the warship, and asked, “Guild Leader Black Flame, this is a Level 130 sea zone. Isn’t it rash to enter this place with the team’s current level?”

In the Miniature Ancient World, the difficulty of sea monsters would increase by one rank for every five levels they were higher than players. For a team with an average level of under 125, fighting against Level 130-plus sea monsters would be a great challenge.

Not to mention, the Bipolar Sea was also regarded as a land of death in the current Miniature Ancient World. This was because the Bipolar Sea was not only covered in tornadoes and storms, but it was also filled with powerful sea monsters. Even the weakest sea monster here was a Level 130 Grand Lord.

Although Colorful Lunarite didn’t care about the survival of Zero Wing’s members, she would be in hot water if the Bronze Warship sank in the Bipolar Sea.

Shi Feng naturally understood Colorful Lunarite’s concerns. He also understood that Colorful Lunarite retained central authority over the Bronze Warship, and she could retake control over the warship if necessary. So, he smiled and said, “This place might be a forbidden land for Tier 3 players, but what about Tier 4 players?”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Su Qianliu, who stood on the deck, pulled out a Magic Tactical Vehicle from her Epic Spatial Bag. Subsequently, a magic array covering a 500-yard radius slowly rose from the tactical vehicle and elevated the mana of everyone within its range by one rank.

“Tier 4 Mana!”

Colorful Lunarite gasped when she felt the mana around her.

Taken from Chapter 208:

Hexagram Protection: Erects a magic array that greatly strengthens the Mana of up to six people within a 1,000-yard radius. Enhancement works up to the Tier 4 standard. Magic array costs 1,000 Magic Crystals per minute to maintain.
