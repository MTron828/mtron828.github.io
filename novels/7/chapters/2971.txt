Chapter 46 – Zero Wing’s Initial Establishment

“The Mana Technique just now is recorded inside this Memory Crystal?”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Lin Yaoyue and Galaxy Past promptly turned their gazes toward the five Memory Crystals in Shi Feng’s hand, their eyes filled with shock and burning desire.

The tier progression in God’s Domain was brutal. The higher one reached, the more difficult it would be to make further progress. It was especially true for players seeking to reach Tier 5 and beyond. They would have to develop their physique and control over Mana to an extremely high standard.

Meanwhile, between Peak Legacies and Mana Techniques, Peak Legacies served mainly to improve a player’s physique, whereas Mana Techniques served to improve a player’s control over Mana. Both were essential for players seeking to ascend to higher tiers.

However, the Mana Technique Shi Feng had previously displayed was unprecedented. It wouldn’t even be an overstatement to say that the Mana control he exhibited was at a divine level.

If they could master such a Mana Technique, let alone reaching Tier 5, even reaching Tier 6 might not be a problem. In comparison, a Peak Legacy’s value paled significantly. After all, a Peak Legacy provided almost no help to players in getting promoted to Tier 6.

“These things should be enough to prove my point, right?” Shi Feng said, a faint smile appearing on his face as he looked at Lin Yaoyue’s and Galaxy Past’s expressions. “Just one copy of this Mana Technique should be worth four or five Peak Legacies, right?”

“Indeed,” Galaxy Past said, nodding as he walked closer to Shi Feng and Lin Yaoyue. Then, with overflowing desire in his eyes, he continued, “It is just as you say, Mr. Black Flame. Let alone four or five Peak Legacies, the various superpowers will probably be willing to trade ten Peak Legacies for just one copy of this Mana Technique.”

At the end of the day, a Peak Legacy could only be used to produce a Tier 5 expert. However, the Mana Technique in Shi Feng’s possession could increase a player’s chances of reaching Tier 6 significantly. Just this point alone was more than enough to cause all superpowers in God’s Domain to go crazy for it. After all, the value of a Tier 6 God-ranked expert easily exceeded the total value of ten Tier 5 experts.

Although powers with only one Tier 6 God-ranked expert could only be considered a top-tier first-rate power, it would become a first-rate power that no superpower would dare to provoke. Meanwhile, if a power had two Tier 6 God-ranked experts, it would be considered a superpower regardless of the standard of its other members. This showed just how powerful Tier 6 God-ranked experts were.

“It seems I have indeed been ignorant, Mr. Black Flame,” Lin Yaoyue said as she retracted her gaze from the Memory Crystals. Then, she looked at Shi Feng and tentatively asked, “May I know if you are willing to sell this Mana Technique, Mr. Black Flame?”

Compared to a Peak Legacy, Shi Feng’s Mana Technique would be of much greater help to a magical class player like herself. If she could get her hands on one of those Memory Crystals, she would have a much easier time progressing on the path of becoming a Mage God.

“If you are willing to sell it, the Star Alliance will pay double of whatever Mysterious Moon offers, Mr. Black Flame!” Galaxy Past said without hesitation. He did not hide his desire for the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique at all.

“Guild Leader Galaxy, you…”

Lin Yaoyue grew anxious when she heard Galaxy Past’s offer. Unlike Galaxy Past, the Star Alliance’s former Guild Leader, she was only a reserve executive of Mysterious Moon. Meanwhile, her desire to obtain the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique was for her personal benefit. Mysterious Moon definitely wouldn’t be willing to pay too high a price for her.

Seeing that the two people before him were about to break into an argument, Shi Feng promptly stored the Memory Crystals away and said, “You two don’t need to argue over it. There is no way I can sell this thing.”

“It’s not for sale?”

Galaxy Past and Lin Yaoyue were visibly disappointed when they heard Shi Feng’s words. However, they felt that it made sense after giving it some thought. Such a precious Mana Technique could be used as a Guild’s foundation. How could Shi Feng possibly sell them?

It was true that Mana Techniques were similar to combat techniques in that they could be duplicated infinitely once a player had achieved perfect mastery over them. It was also true that players could benefit massively by selling these duplicates. However, by doing so, players would also be strengthening potential rivals and enemies. They would essentially be putting the cart before the horse.

“Although I won’t be selling this Holy Annihilation Mana Technique, that doesn’t mean you don’t have a chance at obtaining it,” Shi Feng said when he saw the crestfallen looks of Lin Yaoyue and Galaxy Past. “It simply depends on whether you are interested in my offer.”

Hearing this, Galaxy Past hurriedly nodded and said, “Of course I am interested. May I know what your offer is, Mr. Black Flame?”

Before entering the Miniature Ancient World, Galaxy Past had been stuck at Tier 5 for many years. Now that there was a chance for him to reach Tier 6, he would be lying if he said he wasn’t interested.

Meanwhile, Lin Yaoyue also silently nodded in response to Shi Feng’s words. Although her circumstances differed from Galaxy Past, she was well aware of her limits. With her current talent, it’d be challenging for her to even reach Tier 5, let alone Tier 6. However, if she had the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique, she was certain she could reach Tier 5 at the very least.

“Become an outer member of Zero Wing, and you’ll have the opportunity to learn the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique.” Looking at the two people before him, Shi Feng proudly said, “Normally, you two wouldn’t have any chances at joining Zero Wing. However, Zero Wing is looking to develop in this world, so it is indeed of talents and resources. While you two aren’t particularly skilled, you still barely qualify.”

After thinking about it, Galaxy Past asked, “Do you mean for us to abandon our current Guilds and join Zero Wing, Mr. Black Flame?”

Hearing this, Lin Yaoyue also grew a little hesitant. After all, abandoning Mysterious Moon to join an unknown Outerworld Power was simply too big of a risk.

“No.” Shaking his head, Shi Feng said, “I previously mentioned that Zero Wing is a rather idle power. It is especially true for outer members. There aren’t many restrictions in place for outer members. Becoming an outer member is more like joining an adventurer alliance than joining a Guild. Once you two join, you can do whatever you want so long as you don’t make an enemy out of Zero Wing. You can also complete orders or tasks issued by Zero Wing to earn points and exchange them for Zero Wing’s resources.”

In the past, after the sub-world he operated in gained access to the many worlds of God’s Domain, the bigshots of the various sub-worlds had used a similar method to form alliances with his sub-world’s various powers. Compared to taking over other sub-worlds, this was a much more feasible method for a power to gain access to the resources of other sub-worlds.

Now that the sub-world he resided in had yet to gain full access to the many sub-worlds, he could use this chance to lay a foundation for himself in advance.

“If that’s the case, I am willing to join,” Lin Yaoyue said without hesitation. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t have a problem with it, either,” Galaxy Past said, nodding.

The two of them definitely couldn’t give up their existing Guilds to join Zero Wing. However, it was a different story if Shi Feng was only having them join a casual organization as individuals. Such an arrangement was no different than players joining the Adventurer’s Association. Both sides would only take what they needed from each other. It wouldn’t affect their positions in their current Guilds.

“Good!” Shi Feng nodded slightly. Then, he took out two Magic Contracts he had prepared beforehand and handed them to Lin Yaoyue and Galaxy Past, saying, “Sign it if you two don’t have any problems with the contract.”

Magic Contracts were the highest degree of protection in God’s Domain. It was also the main means the sub-world alliances used to bind their members.

Once players signed a Magic Contract, it didn’t matter which sub-world they were in. So long as they went against the contract’s terms, the penalty stated on the contract would take effect immediately. Even Tier 6 God-ranked experts couldn’t escape the contract’s effects.

After receiving the Magic Contract, Galaxy Past and Lin Yaoyue gave the stated terms a read. The contract was relatively simple. It prohibited them from becoming enemies with Zero Wing and leaking its secrets to players outside the Guild. Of the two clauses, the second one would remain in effect even after they left or got dismissed from Zero Wing.

Meanwhile, they would be prohibited from logging into God’s Domain forever if they break any of these conditions!

After reading the contract’s content, Lin Yaoyue looked at Shi Feng and asked, “Mr. Black Flame, am I allowed to invite others to join after entering Zero Wing?”
