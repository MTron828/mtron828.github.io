Chapter 591 – Frightening Divine Flying Mount

TL Notes:

Please regard all instances of “Divine Dragons” in the main story as “Sacred Dragons” from now on.

…

Did it…reach Tier 5?

Shi Feng couldn’t help but be surprised when he felt faint pressure coming from the Frostflame Phantom Dragon. This was something he had not experienced even when he faced the Half-Snakekin General. Moreover, the Frostflame Phantom Dragon no longer looked like a Flying Mount but rather an actual dragon instead.

Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng hurriedly checked the pendant in his hand. He wanted to check to what extent the Frostflame Phantom Dragon had been upgraded.

Unlike other items that raised the user’s Life Rating, the Divine Water of Life did not have a usage limit. So long as one had enough Divine Water of Life, one could continuously use it to improve a creature’s potential to the extremes. Only, the higher a creature’s potential, the more Divine Water of Life would be needed to improve its potential.

[Ancient Oath]

Can be used to summon a Divine-ranked Tier 5 Frostflame Dragon as a partner to fly and fight freely in the sky. If the Frostflame Dragon dies, it will need 60 natural days to return to life.

Additional Effect: Grants the Ancient Oath’s wielder 15% of the Frostflame Dragon’s Basic Attributes.

…

A Tier 5 Divine-ranked Dragon?

The stats that appeared before Shi Feng stunned him momentarily.

Be it Flying Mounts that were pure-blooded Dragons or Divine Flying Mounts, both were things he had only ever heard about through rumors thus far. As for a Divine Flying Mount that also happened to be a Dragon, this was the first time he had ever heard of one existing. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Flying Mounts could be categorized into four major ranks: Common, Extraordinary, Legendary, and Divine. These ranks represented a Flying Mount’s potential. It also represented the difficulty of upgrading their tiers.

Generally, a Legendary Flying Mount would have a chance of getting promoted to Tier 6, while Advanced Legendary Flying Mounts would have a considerable chance of getting promoted to Tier 6. As for Divine Flying Mounts, they were fated to get promoted to Tier 6.

In other words, he was now in possession of a Dragon that was fated to reach Tier 6!

If news of this spread, it would absolutely shake the entire Greater God’s Domain!

Dragons were an apex race in God’s Domain, and their average Life Rating was essentially unmatched at the same tier. Even the average Tier 6 Dragon could closely rival Tier 6 Gods in combat power. So, having a dragon as a Flying Mount would undoubtedly make him envied by all players.

In addition, the existence of Flying Mounts was akin to tools. So, unlike NPCs and contracted beasts, the concept of a true death did not exist for Flying Mounts, and they could be summoned limitlessly. Players also wouldn’t have to go out of their way to level up their Flying Mounts as Mounts leveled with their owners.

More importantly, players would get to share a portion of their Flying Mounts’ Basic Attributes, and any player would drool over a “dragon-class” bonus. This was because what made dragons strong was their heaven-defying Basic Attributes, and their Basic Attributes far outclassed monsters of the same tier.

It should be known that monsters already possessed far greater Basic Attributes than players in general. The disparity was so significant that even if players equipped themselves with top-tier weapons and equipment, they would still be slightly behind monsters of the same level and tier in Basic Attributes.

Yet, dragons possessed even greater Basic Attributes than the average monster, with a Tier 5 Dragon having the Basic Attributes of a Tier 6 monster of the same level. So, one could only imagine the Basic Attributes one could obtain from a Dragon/Flying Mount.

With this, I can probably fight the Western Continent’s Tier 6 Divine monsters, even without getting promoted to Tier 6.

When Shi Feng looked at his Attribute Panel and saw the numbers listed, he couldn’t help but feel as if he were dreaming.

Even though he was only receiving 15% of the Tier 5 Frostflame Dragon’s Basic Attributes, the bonus was already enough to put his Basic Attributes on par with a Tier 5 expert equipped with a full set of Legendary Equipment.

A full set of Legendary equipment!

For most players, owning a full set of Legendary Equipment was something they could only dream of achieving. Even the various apex powers’ chosen ones wouldn’t necessarily get to enjoy such a benefit.

This was because a Tier 6 expert fully equipped with Legendary Equipment would be strong enough to match Tier 6 Gods. Assigning such valuable equipment to Tier 5 players would be an utter waste. Such behavior would be beyond extravagant, and very few powers would be foolish enough to do such a thing.

Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng pulled up his contacts and called Gentle Snow.

When the call connected, Gentle Snow couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in surprise and ask, “You’re back already, Guild Leader?”

Previously, Shi Feng had already informed her through the real world that he was currently visiting the Forbidden Zone’s Western Continent and stated that they shouldn’t try to contact him unless it was an emergency.

As for the Eternal Realm’s Western Continent, Gentle Snow had more or less learned about it from Shi Feng. So, she knew that while the Western Continent had many more opportunities available than the Eternal Continent, it was also filled with much greater dangers. She also heard from Shi Feng that the Western Continent was infested with Holy Race players, so he couldn’t afford even a moment’s carelessness.

“Something unexpected happened, so I made a trip back first,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “I’m planning to bring some of Zero Wing’s members with me when I go there again, so have Qianliu and the others quickly gather in the Guild Residence.”

“Now?” Gentle Snow hesitated to comply with Shi Feng’s orders. “We are currently exploring the Underground Crystal Palace’s Level 165 zone. We are also planning to raid a Regional Boss once our reinforcements arrive. If we leave now, we will miss this precious opportunity.”

“It’s fine. At most, you’ll miss out on an Extraordinary Secret Treasure.” In a definitive tone, Shi Feng said, “Just tell Fury and the others that I have different arrangements for you all, and you won’t be exploring with them for the time being.”

Zero Wing might be exploring the Underground Crystal Palace’s Level 165 zone currently, but this expedition was led by Desolate Fury’s and Scarecrow Fox’s groups. The expedition didn’t only consist of Zero Wing’s members. Ultimately, the Boss’s loot would have to be distributed based on contributions, and not all would go to Zero Wing.

Not to mention, compared to the Underground Crystal Palace and the rest of the Eternal Continent, the Western Continent was of vastly greater importance. So, he planned to bring some of Zero Wing’s members to develop them on the Western Continent. Otherwise, others might say that Zero Wing lacked capable combatants and could only rely on joining forces with other powers to achieve its current standards.

“Alright, then. I’ll inform them immediately,” Gentle Snow replied as she stopped hesitating. Then, she promptly informed Su Qianliu and the others on the expedition team about Shi Feng’s orders.

Meanwhile, when Su Qianliu, Hidden Soul, and the others heard about Shi Feng’s command, they swiftly returned to the Residence, abandoning their exploration of the Level 165 zone. As for Desolate Fury’s and Scarecrow Fox’s groups, although they were confused by Shi Feng’s decision, they didn’t make any comments about it. After all, this was Zero Wing’s private affair, and they were merely Zero Wing’s collaborators.

…

Zero Wing’s Residence, Guild Leader’s Office:

“Why did you summon us back in such a hurry, Guild Leader? Did something happen?” Hidden Soul, who had already chosen to become a member of Zero Wing thoroughly, asked as she looked at Shi Feng. “The various powers are in the midst of competing for the Level 165 zone’s Regional Bosses to give their members a better chance of getting promoted to Tier 6. Isn’t it a waste for us to give up like this?”

It wasn’t easy for players to get promoted to Tier 6 in God’s Domain. Not to mention, the strength of the Divine Body created would also influence players’ strength in the future. Because of this, the various powers were currently looking for ways to improve their experts’ chances of getting promoted to Tier 6 with a powerful Divine Body, and Extraordinary Secret Treasures were one of the more effective methods that could be used to accomplish this goal.

Meanwhile, once the various powers’ experts created a sufficiently strong Divine Body, they could promptly get promoted to Tier 6 and capture ownerless settlements occupied by Divine monsters. This, in turn, would grant the various powers unimaginable advantages and wealth.

Yet, even though Zero Wing also had an opportunity to secure such advantages and wealth, they had actively abandoned it…

Looking at Hidden Soul’s slightly angry expression, Shi Feng smiled and retrieved a book from his bag space, asking, “Extraordinary Secret Treasures might be important, but what do you think of this item?”

The book was none other than the Bronze Mana Purification Technique he had obtained from grinding in the Nameless City with the Dawnlight Party.
