Chapter 2424 – Silenced

“Is he really just a Tier 3 player?” Prison Tiger was flabbergasted as he looked at the heavily injured Guardian Soldier.

He had experienced the strength of a berserk Guardian Soldier himself. Back then, it took all he had just to block one of the Grand Lord’s attacks. Meanwhile, he had not only gotten sent flying by the attack but also lost more than two- thirds of his HP. If not for his commander’s timely use of a Tier 4 Magic Scroll to bind the Guardian Soldier’s movements, he wouldn’t be standing here right now.

Shi Feng, however, had actually forcefully stopped the berserk Guardian Soldier’s attack despite being a Tier 3 Sword King. Following that, he had heavily injured the Grand Lord with just one strike. His Strength Attribute was frighteningly high.

At this moment, aside from Heaven’s Blade’s members, even War Blood’s and Starlink’s members, who had planned to target Shi Feng, were stunned by this scene, their mouths hanging wide open as they gawked at the prostrate Guardian Soldier.

Damn it! How did he become so strong?! Blood Oath’s expression turned indescribably heavy as he gazed at Shi Feng, his anger and fighting spirit fizzling out.

Previously, their team had managed to kill a berserk Guardian Soldier only after using three Tier 4 Magic Scrolls and sacrificing seven Tier 3 players. Although they had resurrected the fallen players afterward, the resurrected players still lost half a level, which would affect these players’ progress considerably.

Now, however, Shi Feng had actually heavily injured the berserk Guardian Soldier so casually. If they fought the Swordsman, their losses would most likely be even worse than if they went up against a berserk Guardian Soldier. After all, players were different from monsters as opponents.

The movements of monsters were controllable to a certain extent through the manipulation of aggro. Monsters were also lacking when it came to dodging and blocking attacks; they merely relied on their high HP to outlast players.

In contrast, players might not have as much HP as monsters, but they could avoid and defend against attacks. In a fight between experts of equal combat standards, it would be very difficult to reach an outcome, unless there was a massive difference in Basic Attributes, as neither side would be able to land a vital hit easily. Both sides could only resort to a battle of attrition.

“Old Sword, it seems we have a problem. I’m afraid this brat’s Basic Attributes are on par with those peerless monsters’. In fact, his might even be superior to theirs,” Wind Demon said to Sword Demon as he watched the Guardian Soldier struggle to stand up.

There were three peerless experts on Dragonheart Island, and the various superpowers dreaded every one of them. Even Starlink did not dare offend these monstrous existences.

Meanwhile, the strength Shi Feng had just displayed was not the slightest bit inferior compared to those three peerless monsters’.

If it came down to a fight, even if the four of them utilized their newly learned battle array, victory over Shi Feng would still be a long row to hoe. Not to mention, there was still Heaven’s Blade’s Zwei. The strength she had displayed similarly exceeded their initial expectations.

“His Strength Attribute surpasses that of Grand Lords of the same level?” Sword Demon was filled with an indescribable sense of consternation as he stared at Shi Feng. “Just how many resources and opportunities did he receive?”

With Starlink’s backing, the resources Sword Demon had obtained were far beyond what Guild Leaders of first-rate Guilds got. In addition, while challenging his Tier 3 Promotion Quest, he had come across a fortuitous opportunity and secured himself a Strength-type Bloodline and Peak Legacy. Now, in terms of Strength, he was already close to rivaling Grand Lords of the same level. With the boost from the battle array, his Strength would surpass that of a Grand Lord.

In terms of Strength, he undoubtedly ranked at the top of God’s Domain. The only ones that could surpass him were Dragonheart Island’s top three experts.

However, those three peerless monsters all had a Super Guild supporting them. The resources and opportunities they received were far superior to his. Hence, his inferiority was only natural.

Shi Feng, however, had only Zero Wing behind him. Even though the Guild was allied with superpowers like the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion and Unyielding Soul, producing a peerless expert should still be impossible for it.

Meanwhile, after a moment of silence, whether it was War Blood’s or Starlink’s Tier 3 experts, every one of them froze, their eyes brimming with fear as they looked at Shi Feng.

Heaven’s Blade’s members were stunned to see this.

The fact that Shi Feng had heavily injured a berserk Guardian Soldier with one move was already plenty shocking. Now, he even deterred War Blood’s and Starlink’s members from taking action. These 32 War Blood and Starlink members were not only Tier 3 players but also at the Void Realm standard at the very least.

If news of this matter spread, it would definitely cause a sensation throughout Dragonheart Island!

“No wonder Black Flame brought only three people with him to rescue us. He actually possesses such frightening strength. With this, War Blood and Starlink will have to think twice,” Early Butterfly, a Tier 3 female Elementalist from Heaven’s Blade, said joyfully when she saw this scene.

The three peerless monsters of Dragonheart Island were terrifyingly strong. Even the various superpowers’ main forces were afraid of provoking them. Now, Shi Feng had revealed that his strength rivaled those three peerless monsters’. If he worked with Heaven’s Blade’s members, then War Blood and Starlink’s chances of victory would be considerably low.

“What do you think, Big Brother Tiger? I didn’t say anything wrong, right?” Cleansing Flame said proudly as she glanced at the stunned Prison Tiger. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She knew very clearly what kind of strength Shi Feng possessed. Even Demon Palace’s main force was no match for him. War Blood and Starlink naturally wouldn’t stand a chance against him, either.

At this moment, Cleansing Flame even started wondering how Prison Tiger would react if he found out that Shi Feng had repelled Demon Palace’s main force members all by himself in a frontal confrontation.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng heavily injured the Guardian Soldier, Cola, Turtledove, and Shadow Sword joined the fight. Although the three of them were not as strong as Shi Feng, they still weren’t existences that War Blood’s and Starlink’s experts could take on one-on-one. Only Domain Realm experts like Blood Oath and the Four Shadow Demons would stand a chance against them.

For a time, the members of Heaven’s Blade, War Blood, and Starlink watched quietly as Shi Feng’s group of four took out the Guardian Soldier, an indescribably complex atmosphere filling the hall.

After looting the Guardian Soldier, Shi Feng turned to Blood Oath, a smile appearing on his face as he asked, “Commander Blood, you’ve been watching for quite some time now. Are you planning to leave on your own? Or do you want me to send you off?”

Although Blood Oath and the others had reached Tier 3, they still were not much of a threat to Shi Feng. After all, he possessed multiple Fragmented Legendary items. He would, at most, be wary of War Blood’s and Starlink’s hidden trump cards. After all, as Dragonheart Island’s number one adventurer team, War Blood should’ve come across plenty of fortuitous opportunities. The strength it concealed definitely could not be underestimated.

At Shi Feng’s words, Blood Oath’s complexion turned ashen. For a moment, the Berserker wavered over his decision. If he chose to fight, he would have to go up against Shi Feng, someone whose strength rivaled Dragonheart Island’s three peerless monsters’. If he chose to retreat, he would be abandoning an excellent opportunity to obtain a Tree of Life. In addition, War Blood’s reputation would most likely take a hit. After all, it would be impossible to keep such a huge incident under wraps.

Meanwhile, when Heaven’s Blade’s members saw this scene, they could not help but look at Shi Feng in reverence.

Ever since War Blood became Dragonheart Island’s number one adventurer team, it had remained in the limelight of Dragonheart Island. No superpower dared to offend it.

Aside from Shi Feng, there were most likely only a handful of individuals that could push War Blood to such an extent.

Right then, however, another commotion occurred in the inner corridor. Immediately, everyone turned to look at the altar hall’s entrance.

In the next moment, a team consisting of 50-plus members walked out of the monster-infested inner corridor and into the hall. The powerful aura the team exuded surprised everyone present. Meanwhile, every one of these players sported Thirteen Thrones’ Guild Emblem. Leading these Thirteen Thrones members was an elderly man—Elder Wu, one of Thirteen Thrones’ Grand Elders.
