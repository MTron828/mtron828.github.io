Chapter 252 – Geniuses and Monsters

Misty Canyon, Abyssal Star City:

“Guild Leader, less than four million players are gathered in Abyssal Star City right now. Moreover, the majority of them are Asura’s members, and few are independent players and members of the various powers. At this rate, the city’s population will just barely exceed ten million by the end of today. After deducting the city’s daily maintenance cost, we would have made a profit of only four million Gold and 170,000 Magic Crystals,” Blackie reported to Shi Feng in a somewhat gloomy tone. “If we can lower the entrance fee to 40 Silver, I’m sure we can max out the city’s population limit of 20 million.”

Currently, the various NPC Cities were only charging an entrance fee of 30 Silver. With Abyssal Star City’s geographical advantage, many players would be able to accept an entrance fee of 40 Silver. So, if they lowered the city’s entrance fee to 40 Silver, they’d have no problem filling the city’s population limit of 20 million. After all, many of the Miniature Ancient World’s local players had no way of entering NPC Cities.

“No. It’s not necessarily bad to keep Abyssal Star City’s player traffic low. If we hit the population limit, Asura’s members will likely have to wait in line for a long time, even if we reserve some slots. This will cause their leveling speed to lag behind,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

“I’m just a little sad about the lost income. If we can max out the city’s population limit, we can earn an additional several million Gold per day. In that case, we can buy a few more Advanced Lineage Crystals every day. Not to mention, purchasing Silver Combat Techniques from the various powers is also a considerable expense. Although Silver Combat Techniques aren’t as expensive as Advanced Lineage Crystals, each one still costs 150,000 Gold. Without these things, it’s going to take our Guild’s main force members a lot more time to grow to an adequate standard,” Blackie said, shrugging. “But we only have a few days before the Level 120-plus maps open…”

The Level 120-plus maps were destined to be the competition grounds for the various powers in the Miniature Ancient World. At the same time, that was also the best time for the various powers to reveal their strength.

However, Zero Wing had nothing to show other than its apex combatants. Its main force members were nowhere near as strong as the various superpowers’ main forces. So, how was Zero Wing supposed to compete for resources in the Level 120-plus maps?

“Let the various powers fight for the Level 120-plus maps if they want to. For the time being, it’s best if Zero Wing and Asura accumulate strength quietly,” Shi Feng said with a faint smile as he looked at the reluctant look on Blackie’s face. “So long as our main force members grow adequately strong, Zero Wing’s name will shake the world sooner or later.”

While Shi Feng was chatting with Blackie, he suddenly received a message from Su Qianliu stating that the Green God Corporation’s representative had already arrived at the God’s Domain Association Building’s entrance.

They’re here already?

After taking a deep breath, Shi Feng quickly passed his remaining work in Zero Wing to Blackie before going offline.

The Greater World!

This was the place where everyone would eventually go to live in the future. It was the place where people from many worlds converged. It was also the place where people from many worlds competed with each other for the right to live.

Whether a Guild could prosper in the Greater God’s Domain depended entirely on whether it could establish a foothold in the Greater World.

If a Guild couldn’t establish a foothold in the Greater World, it would be as good as finished in the Greater God’s Domain.

During Shi Feng’s previous life, Zero Wing had entered the Greater World without any prior preparations. As a result, it had gotten targeted by a conglomerate very early on, which led to Zero Wing encountering numerous struggles in the Greater World. At one point, Zero Wing had even nearly been eliminated by the apex power Demon’s Gate and lost its ownership over its God’s Domain.

However, Shi Feng did not intend to repeat his past mistakes. This time, he must lay a solid foundation in the Greater World before their God’s Domain was thoroughly linked with the Greater God’s Domain. Only by doing so could Zero Wing improve its standing in the Greater God’s Domain and reach the apex!

…

Shortly after Shi Feng went offline, two women wearing Black Cloaks to conceal their identities appeared on the Primordial Tower’s first floor, their beautiful eyes filled with shock the moment they stepped inside the tower.

“The mana here has thoroughly condensed into a mist-like state. Abyssal Star City has hidden a truly terrifying strength,” Favra muttered as she observed her surroundings with her eyes that had now turned completely silver. “In addition, the properties of the mana here are similar to Eternal Energy in that it can increase players’ brain activity by a significant margin. If we factor in the report we received on the tower’s miniature worlds, even Refinement Realm players can master Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques if given enough time.”

“Mana that resembles Eternal Energy?” Maria fell into a daze when she heard her aunt’s words, her mind having difficulty accepting this information.

Of course, that wasn’t to say that she doubted her aunt’s words. On the contrary, she trusted in her aunt’s judgment.

This was because her aunt was in possession of the Soul Eyes Skill, an Identification Skill that allowed the user to see the essence of all things for a short time.

Mana that shared similar properties with Eternal Energy was something that could be of considerable help to even Tier 6 God-ranked experts in their training, let alone helping Refinement Realm players master Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques.

Meanwhile, the Primordial Tower’s ability to provide players with such a mana environment was something that could be incredibly useful to any power in the Greater God’s Domain. This was because third-floor experts, also known as Superior Adventurers, were incredibly rare. Most of the experts the various powers had under their command were only Advanced Adventurers who were at the second-floor standard.

However, so long as an Advanced Adventurer mastered a sufficiently large number and variety of Advanced Bronze Combat Techniques, it was entirely possible for them to rival ordinary Superior Adventurers in terms of combat power.

If news of the Primordial Tower were to get out, it would cause an unimaginable sensation even in the Greater God’s Domain. At that time, the various powers would either try to get their members into the Primordial Tower or acquire the Primordial Tower.

However, so long as Zero Wing could successfully defend Abyssal Star City, it would no longer have to worry about prospering. No matter how many new maps appeared in the Miniature Ancient World in the future, Abyssal Star City would forever remain the best place for Superior Adventurers and below to settle in.

After Favra turned off her Soul Eyes, a flash of excitement appeared in her eyes as she said, “We have to act quickly, Maria. If the other conglomerates learn about this matter, we’ll have much greater difficulty opening a Trade Center here.”

Maria also understood the significance of the matter, so she logged out of the game without hesitation.

The process of opening a Trade Center involved many formalities. The Trade Center’s design also had to be delivered from the Greater God’s Domain, and that was a process that required some time.

…

On the other side, after Shi Feng went offline, he took a plane to an isolated island far away from the city under the lead of several Green God Corporation employees.

Upon arriving at the island, he found that there was actually an Upper Zone established on the island. However, unlike the Upper Zones found in first-tier cities, the one on this island was much smaller. There were also only several thousand people living here.

After passing through a series of inspections, Shi Feng arrived inside a large room that was situated several dozen kilometers underground.

There weren’t many people in the room, only ten, excluding Shi Feng. Out of these ten people, the oldest appeared to be in their forties, while the youngest appeared younger than twenty. In addition, all ten of these people were big names that everyone knew on the main continent of God’s Domain. These people were either known as monsters or peerless geniuses by players.

The five commanders of the Five Great Super Guilds’ main forces were the most famous among these people. Out of these five commanders, the most famous would have to be the Mythology’s Silver Ghost Prosciutto.

Aside from the five commanders, the five other people in the room were the Secret Pavillion’s Empress Purple Jade, Divine Tribe’s Magic-Eye Hunter Fithalia, Miracle’s Witch of the West Alice, the Flower of Seven Sins’ number one genius Thousand Scars, and last but not least, the legendary adventurer team Midnight Tea Party’s First Commander Breeze Wine.

Except for Thousand Scars, the other nine people in the room were all bona fide Tier 6 God-ranked experts. This was a gathering that most players in God’s Domain would probably never imagine happening.

When Breeze Wine, who wore a pair of sunglasses, saw Shi Feng entering, he swept his gaze across the others in the room and said, “Since the last person has arrived, we can go now.”
