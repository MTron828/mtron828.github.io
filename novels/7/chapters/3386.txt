Chapter 461 – Matching a Holy Ancestor?

When Frey looked at the countless oncoming fists, she promptly switched her actions with the Ghost Dragon, transforming its claw into a black hole.

Space Annihilation, the 13th-ranked Absolute Technique!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Countless explosions shook the hall, making it feel like doomsday had arrived. The space in the hall also cracked and destabilized more and more with each subsequent explosion. For a moment, it felt like two Tier 6 experts were battling here.

This exchange greatly stunned Desolate Fury, Thousand Scars, and the others. Had this battle taken place outside the Eternal Realm, the explosions taking place in the hall would have been strong enough to erase an entire map.

“Is this the power of a dragon?”

“No, this isn’t a result of just the dragon’s power. It’s also because of Vice Guild Leader Frey’s impressive control.”

“Indeed. Space Annihilation is an incredibly complex technique. Even fifth-floor experts have difficulty executing it under normal circumstances, let alone executing it through a non-human body. Yet, Vice Guild Leader Frey is executing the technique consecutively. If we’re comparing purely in terms of control, Vice Guild Leader Frey can already rank among the Red Dragon Nation’s top ten.”

Red Dragon Nation’s members grew excited when they saw the Ghost Dragon manipulated by Frey holding its ground against Manoset. They also grew more confident in defeating the Holy Ancestor.

The biggest concern a team faced when raiding a Boss monster was whether it had the ability to withstand the Boss’s attacks. So long as a team had someone or some way to resist a Boss’s attacks, it would become possible to raid the Boss.

Previously, the power Manoset displayed was simply terrifying, and their team’s ace tank nearly got killed in one hit. If any of the team’s other tanks tried to block the Holy Ancestor’s attacks, they would most likely be killed on the spot. So, their team essentially had no way of resisting Manoset’s attacks.

However, now that the Ghost Dragon under Frey’s control had proven itself capable of resisting Manoset’s attacks, all they needed to do next was attack the Holy Ancestor with their all.

Subsequently, the team’s ranged players began bombarding Manoset with attacks from over a hundred yards away.

Tier 5 Skill, Space Breaker!

Tier 5 Spell, Ice Devourer!

Tier 5 Taboo Skill, Demon King’s Rose!

…

Because the Holy Ancestor could not move and was busy defending himself from the Ghost Dragon’s attacks, he could only let the numerous Tier 5 Skills and Spells batter his body.

-3,465,424!

-5,541,746!

-7,465,471!

…

Everyone froze when they saw the damage they did to the Holy Ancestor.

“Impossible!”

“My Tier 5 Taboo Skill only caused seven million damage?”

“Did the Compounding Potion’s effects expire?”

Everyone couldn’t believe their eyes when they saw how little damage they had caused to Manoset.

Previously, even when they fought against the Legendary-ranked Devouring Earth Dragons, their attacks still managed to cause damage nearing 100 million. Meanwhile, the Devouring Earth Dragons were only slightly inferior to Dragons of the same tier regarding Defense.

Yet, when they used the same attacks against Manoset, none managed to cause more than ten million damage to the Holy Ancestor. The damage they caused wasn’t even a fraction of Manoset’s battle recovery, let alone Manoset’s 1.5 trillion HP pool.

At this rate, even if Manoset simply stood there and took their attacks, he would still be perfectly fine after a hundred years.

As expected of a Holy Ancestor. Not even Tier 6 Dragons have such a high Defense.?Shi Feng was also a little astonished when he saw Manoset’s Defense.

Although members of the Holy Race typically had very high Defense due to the improvements provided by Holy Power, this was the first time Shi Feng had seen a member of the Holy Race having such an absurdly high Defense. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“This won’t do, Vice Guild Leader. The Boss’s Defense is simply ridiculous. There’s no way we can deal enough damage to kill him,” Unrestrained Lionheart said, the corner of his eyes twitching as he silent-cast Tier 5 Spells one after another.

Frey also fell into thought as she manipulated the Ghost Dragon. Although she had long known that Manoset wouldn’t be an easy foe to defeat, she didn’t think the Holy Ancestor would be this frightening.

Not only did Manoset have HP greater than Tier 5 Dragons, but he even had Defense greater than Tier 6 Dragons.

“The rest is up to you now, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Frey anxiously said as she looked at Shi Feng.

Now that they had a way to block Manoset’s attacks, the next biggest problem they needed to resolve was how to deplete the Holy Ancestor’s HP. If they couldn’t even overcome the Holy Ancestor’s battle recovery, defeating him would be a pipe dream.

However, Shi Feng was only a Tier 4 Sword Emperor. Frey found it truly hard to imagine what methods Shi Feng could possibly come up with to deplete Manoset’s HP.

In response to Frey’s words, Shi Feng nodded and walked up to Manoset.

“What is Brother Black Flame trying to do?” Desolate Fury couldn’t help but grow worried when he saw Shi Feng moving within 100 yards of Manoset. “There’s no way to dodge the Boss’s punches at such close range, and even one of those punches is enough to K.O. a Tier 5 tank.”

“I can’t see any other options. Ranged attacks are already proven useless,” Leroja said while firing arrows at the Holy Ancestor. “Guild Leader Black Flame should have a way to block the Boss’s punches, so he’s probably thinking of testing the effectiveness of melee attacks.”

Melee attacks?

When White Owl overheard Leroja’s assessment, her curiosity was piqued, and she began observing Shi Feng’s every action closely. Not to mention, as a melee player, she didn’t have anything better to do right now.

Manoset’s punches were simply overwhelming. Not only did the Holy Ancestor’s punches carry immense power, but they also possessed frightening speed. Outside 100 yards, it was still possible for Tier 5 players like herself to react to the punches in time and take appropriate countermeasures. However, within 100 yards, they would be struck without fail.

Subsequently, as Shi Feng moved closer and closer to Manoset, the Holy Ancestor finally shifted his attention to him and threw out numerous punches. Seeing this, Shi Feng promptly raised the Winter of Eternal Night.

Holy Mana’s Shadow!

Suddenly, a cloud of crimson mist appeared around Shi Feng, enveloping him completely. Then, in the blink of an eye, a ten-meter-tall Swordsman covered in holy runes emerged from the cloud of crimson mist.

The instant this giant of a Swordsman appeared, everyone present involuntarily shuddered as an indescribable sense of pressure enveloped them. For a moment, it felt as if a God had appeared in the hall.

Immediately afterward, one of Manoset’s punches could be seen connecting with the giant Swordsman. However, the punch simply passed through the Swordsman without accomplishing anything.

Subsequently, the giant Swordsman began moving across the air at unbelievable speeds, rapidly evading Manoset’s punches one after another.

Flowing Space’s First Step, Stepping Space!

How fast!

Death Omen’s eyes widened her eyes in shock when she saw that the giant Swordsman had already arrived in front of the Holy Ancestor.

The Swordsman had crossed a distance of several dozen yards in the blink of an eye. This speed was already enough to rival a Tier 6 Assassin using an Advanced Silver Combat Technique. However, Death Omen could clearly feel that the Swordsman’s Life Rating was nowhere near the Tier 6 standard.

...

“Disappear, ant!”

When Manoset saw Shi Feng appearing before him, he sneered and abandoned all defense against the Ghost Dragon, opting to send a rain of punches at Shi Feng.

Holy Annihilation!

Without hesitation, Shi Feng executed his strongest move against Manoset’s barrage of punches.

Boom!

Space within the hall became devastated, and the barrage of punches disappeared as Manoset was sent stumbling backward and nearly falling to the ground. At the same time, an unbelievable damage value appeared above his head.
