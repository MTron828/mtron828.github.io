TL Notes:

Made a change to Chapter 936:

Desert River’s “stone cane” changed to “stone staff.”

I have also changed Ink Crystal’s “cane” to “vine staff.”

Eternal Realm, Skeleton Hill:

After 200,000 Eternal Gold and 10,000,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal disappeared from Shi Feng’s bag, the forested area shook, and countless lightning bolts emerged from the void to strike the land, shattering it. Immediately afterward, an ancient city comparable to the Crystal City of Secrets in majesty rose from the ground.

How can there be an archaic city here?! When Snow Wolf saw the ancient city emerging from the ground, his mouth fell wide open.

As the name suggested, archaic cities referred to cities that had existed in a distant era. Although these cities were typically discovered in a near-ruined state, they often held Legacies that did not exist in the modern era, making them incredibly valuable. Moreover, the older an archaic city was, the more valuable its Legacies were.

However, the old age of archaic cities made finding them incredibly difficult. Most would already be in ruins by the time they were discovered. Some might have even returned to the earth, never to be found. Although upper-ranking hegemonic powers could get lucky and find an archaic city after searching a Realm for several years, such occurrences were few and far between. Normally, only pseudo-apex powers and above could reliably locate archaic cities. Nonetheless, they’d need to spend years scouring dozens of Realms.

In the case of the archaic city before him, Snow Wolf could tell it was extraordinary at a glance. Although the city was in relatively good shape, hinting that it wasn’t from a particularly distant era, it radiated Divine Might that resembled that of Primordial Gods. This meant that, contrary to its appearance, the city must have come from an extremely distant era. Furthermore, it should be superior to the average primordial city.

If not for them being bound by a God’s Domain Contract, Snow Wolf would have attacked Shi Feng without hesitation.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, is this the place you want to capture?” Rin asked, shocked when she saw the many monsters inside the city.

The monsters inside the archaic city were all Level 230 Divine monsters, and they easily numbered over 10,000. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call the city a nest of Bosses.

In God’s Domain, Level 200 was a major turning point for players and monsters. Before Level 200, a Tier 5 player fully equipped with Legendary items could easily solo a Tier 6 Divine monster. However, after Level 200, even a Tier 6 player fully equipped with Legendary items could only stand their ground against a Tier 6 Divine monster. Upon reaching Level 220 and above, also known as Taboo Levels, players would need a party equipped with top-tier items to stand a chance against a Tier 6 Divine monster.

Although their team comprised fifth- and sixth-floor experts fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts, they’d still have to fight in 6- to 20-man groups if they wanted to kill a Level 230 Divine monster. If they fought solo, they would only be able to stand their ground at best.

Furthermore, they’d have to be careful not to lure too many monsters at a time. Should they accidentally draw the attention of a thousand monsters or more, even a team of their caliber would be doomed.

As Shi Feng looked at the monster-infested city, he recalled the battle video the Seven Luminaries Alliance had secretly recorded of the Sun Dynasty and explained, “There might be many monsters, but their perception range isn’t particularly wide. They are also quite spaced from one another. So long as we lure these monsters out bit by bit, we can safely exterminate them.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“If that’s the case, this will be easy! Rin, lure the closest monsters to the entrance! Tanks, you all will receive the monsters at the entrance! Everyone else, focus on attacking!” Snow Wolf commanded.

“Okay, leave it to me!” Rin answered as she waved her staff and executed an Implement Manipulation Technique, launching over a hundred pebbles toward a dozen ten-meter-tall Demonized Half-Orcs.

The pebbles flew and landed with great precision, each landing by the feet of a Demonized Half-Orc. Although they did not cause any damage, they created just enough noise to draw the monsters’ attention.

When the Demonized Half-Orcs followed the sounds and found only pebbles by their feet, they scratched their heads in confusion. But just as they were about to look away, they heard another barely audible sound of a pebble falling nearby. With their curiosity piqued, the Demonized Half-Orcs walked toward the source of the sound.

As this cycle repeated, the dozen Demonized Half-Orcs moved closer to the city’s entrance. However, no other Demonized Half-Orcs joined the group due to Rin’s perfect timing and control of the pebbles.

“Charge!”

When Snow Wolf saw the dozen Demonized Half-Orcs fast approaching the city’s entrance, he gave the command to engage the monsters. Immediately, several dozen five- to six-meter-tall Crystallian experts sprang forth, some conjuring stone walls with their staves to smash the Half-Orcs, while some turned their flesh into metal before charging headlong into the Half-Orcs.

After issuing his command, Snow Wolf also joined the fight. With a wave of his stone staff, the ground shook and the space around the Demonized Half-Orcs distorted. This disrupted the Half-Orcs’ movements and reduced the accuracy of their attacks, lowering the pressure on the tanks and healers. Additionally, the warped space neutralized the din of battle, allowing the tanks to fight to their hearts’ content and hold aggro more effectively. This, in turn, reduced the chances of rearline attackers stealing aggro.

“Are these two monsters?” The Seven Luminaries Alliance’s members were stunned by this scene. They had never thought fighting Tier 6 Divine monsters so silently was possible.

However, despite their astonishment, the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s members did not stop attacking the Demonized Half-Orcs. Less than half an hour later, the dozen Demonized Half-Orcs had been killed, contributing a significant amount of EXP to Shi Feng, who was covered in injuries.

It’s a pity the monsters here don’t drop items. Otherwise, we’d have made a small fortune after killing so many high-level Divine monsters. Shi Feng inwardly sighed as he looked at the corpses of the Demonized Half-Orcs.

Divine monsters were walking treasure chests outside the Eternal Realm. It was especially so for Level 220 Divine monsters and above. Besides dropping Taboo Weapons and Equipment, they also had a small chance of dropping Fragmented Divine Artifacts. Unfortunately, the monsters in the primordial civilization city gave only EXP and nothing else.

“Good! Next wave!” Snow Wolf ordered Rin again. “I’m already familiar with these monsters’ combat rhythm, so you can lure more.”

“Okay, I’ll lure more, then.” Rin nodded.

She had previously limited the number of Demonized Half-Orcs she lured to a dozen so they could understand the monsters’ standards. Otherwise, a 1,000-man team of elite experts like theirs would have no problem tackling a hundred Divine monsters of similar levels. Not to mention, their team had two sixth-floor experts.

Subsequently, Rin and Snow Wolf swiftly worked together to lure a hundred Demonized Half-Orcs. They also ensured their battle with the monsters made no sound. Moreover, whenever a Demonized Half-Orc died, they would quickly lure another to the entrance, maximizing the potential of the team’s AOE attacks.

Is this how sixth-floor experts cooperate in battle? Shi Feng felt like he was watching the cooperation of a hundred players as he watched Rin and Snow Wolf’s performance. He never thought that the cooperation between sixth-floor experts could yield such incredible results. He also dared not imagine how it would be like to confront two sixth-floor experts simultaneously.

After recovering from his surprise, Shi Feng started to contribute to the fight seriously, using Miniature Abyssal World to weaken the Demonized Half-Orcs and greatly shorten the time needed to kill them.

…

After five days of continuous progress, the team eliminated all the Demonized Half-Orcs in the city’s outer and inner areas.

In these five days, Shi Feng’s level had skyrocketed, reaching Level 229. Now, he was only 17% away from the Level 230 threshold.

After catching a breather, the team made its way to the heart of the city, arriving before a sunken tower.

The stone tower had three floors, each a hundred meters in height. The first two of the tower’s three floors were underground, and only the uppermost floor remained above ground. Many divine patterns were engraved on the tower’s exterior, and just the Divine Might they radiated made it difficult for even experts with Tier 6 Peak Concentration to approach the tower.

When everyone entered within 100 yards of the tower, Shi Feng suddenly sensed a frightening mental pulse from within the tower. Immediately afterward, everyone involuntarily took several steps back.

Before anyone could recover from their surprise, the entrance to the tower’s third floor opened, revealing a 20-meter-tall man armed with a greatsword and clad in a suit of silver armor. As the man walked out of the tower, his white cape fluttered in the wind, and divine runes lingered around him. The man’s presence felt primordial, and everyone shuddered as they stood in his aura.

When Shi Feng saw the giant of a man walking out of the tower, his eyes widened in shock.

“A First-Generation Hero?!”
