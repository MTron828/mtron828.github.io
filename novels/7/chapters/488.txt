Chapter 489 - Shop

Upon hearing Blue Bamboo’s agreement, Shi Feng immediately contacted Aqua Rose and had her organize an elite Dungeon raiding party.

A Dungeon was a very good place for players to improve their techniques.

Independent parties normally only raided Normal Mode Dungeons. Even ordinary Guild parties would only occasionally raid Hard Mode Dungeons. As for elite parties, they raided Hard Mode Dungeons slightly more often. Zero Wing’s elite parties, however, were different. When they raided Dungeons, Hard Mode was the lowest difficulty they would choose, though they would often challenge Hell Mode.

To raid a Hard Mode Dungeon, players only needed to meet the minimum requirement for equipment; the requirement for techniques was not very high. However, it was a different story for Hell Mode. Hell Mode had a very high technique requirement. Even if players’ equipment was good enough to overwhelm the monsters that waited inside the Dungeon, that did not guarantee that they could clear it. Their techniques needed to reach a certain standard before they could raid the Dungeon successfully, so it was a very good place to train one’s techniques.

Zero Wing also had a requirement set for its elite members. Every week, elite members needed to raid Hell Mode Dungeons a certain number of times. Although this was a stringent quota, members who fulfilled it would earn plenty of Guild Points as compensation for the deaths they suffered inside the Hell Mode Dungeon. This was also why Zero Wing’s elite members were so much more powerful than the elite members of other Guilds.

As long as Blue Bamboo trained diligently and polished herself in Hell Mode Dungeons for a time, she should not have any issues passing Zero Wing’s evaluation.

Following which, Thoughtful Rain and Blue Bamboo each purchased a set consisting of Level 25 Secret-Silver and Fine-Gold Equipment for Elementalists and Clerics, spending over a million Credits in total.

Despite such a large expenditure, however, both girls were extremely satisfied with their purchases. They even felt that they had profited significantly.

They knew very well that, should they purchase Level 25 top-tier equipment from the virtual trade center, they would have to spend over two million Credits at the very minimum. Moreover, there was no guarantee that the equipment would be available. After all, every Guild was in dire need of top-tier equipment. Naturally, they would not sell such equipment easily.

After Shi Feng finished dealing with these matters, he immediately departed from the Residence and headed towards the Starstreak Trading Firm.

“Rain, you’re the best! I can’t believe you actually know someone like Big Brother Ye Feng! Previously, one of my classmates boasted in front of me about how her boyfriend wore several pieces of Level 25 Fine-Gold Equipment. If she finds out that I now have several pieces of Level 25 Fine-Gold Equipment, she will definitely turn green with envy!” Blue Bamboo laughed as she fiddled with the Fine-Gold Equipment in her hands. “Honestly though, Big Brother Ye Feng really treats you nicely. On the way here, I’ve researched the forums and found out plenty about Zero Wing’s elite members. These elite members normally raid Hell Mode Dungeons, and they never offer to carry anyone, not even their own ordinary members.

“I’ve always wondered what it feels like to clear a Hell Mode Dungeon. Now that Big Brother Ye Feng has arranged for us to accompany Zero Wing’s elite parties to improve our strengths, it won’t be long before we become experts, too.

“Say, seeing as how Big Brother Ye Feng is such a young and handsome man, do you think he has a girlfriend? If he doesn’t... Hehe... Rain, this could be a good opportunity for you. Even an international corporation is trying to recruit him to their battle team. Once he becomes famous, who knows how many people will be gunning for him. Your chances with him will decrease significantly if you wait.”

“You little girl!” Thoughtful Rain blushed slightly. Snapping, she said, “I’m going to ignore you now!”

Seeing that Thoughtful Rain had turned around and was about to leave, Blue Bamboo hurriedly pulled her friend back, panicking, “Nooo!”

White River City, Starstreak Trading Firm.

“Smile, how many Strengthened Armor Kits have you guys produced?” Shi Feng asked.

“Guild Leader, the three of us have forged over 10,000 pieces. Are we going to put them up for sale now?” Melancholic Smile asked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mhm. Bring all of the Strengthened Armor Kits and follow me. Right, also bring the Gold we’ve earned so far,” Shi Feng said.

Although the Strengthened Armor Kits were inferior to the Mana Armor Kits, with three people producing them, Shi Feng did not have to forge the Armor Kits himself. Naturally, the stock they had created was astounding.

With the burden of 30,000 Gold on his shoulders, Shi Feng felt that it would be best if he dealt with the problem as soon as possible. After all, there was not much time remaining. The looming penalty for failing the Epic Quest was also quite stressful. Moreover, Horizon Alliance had already nurtured quite a number of Lifestyle players, forgers in particular. They had also recruited close to half the Advanced Forging Apprentices from White River City’s seven neighboring cities. The Horizon Alliance even employed Basic Forgers, which no other city possessed.

Once Shi Feng accumulated the 30,000 Gold, he would no longer have a connection to the Starstreak Trading Firm. Hence, Shi Feng had been planning and accumulating his wealth, preparing to open his own market.

And now was the perfect time to do so. Fortunately, he had accumulated a sufficient number of Gold Coins. It was time to display his strength.

“Guild Leader, I have everything with me. Aside from Strengthening Scrolls, we also have the 13,000-plus Gold that we’ve accumulated,” Melancholic Smile said as she placed the money and the items on the table. This was the first time she had ever seen so much money.

There were more than 13,000 Gold Coins stacked on the table. This was the accumulation of all the money Starstreak Trading Firm had earned from the eight cities it occupied, including White River City.

There was not a single Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom that could compete with the Horizon Alliance’s wealth; a Guild would be quite well off with only one-tenth of the Alliance’s fortune.

If converted to Credits, 13,000 Gold was worth hundreds of millions.

One had to admit that God’s Domain’s money-making potential was formidable. Moreover, the game had only launched less than a month ago...

However, no fool would exchange so much Gold for Credits, yet Melancholic Smile had no idea what Shi Feng intended to do with so much Gold.

After giving the items on the table a casual glance, Shi Feng quickly stored them in his bag.

“Follow me,” Shi Feng said as he exited the forging room.

Melancholic Smile promptly followed.

After leaving the Starstreak Trading Firm, Shi Feng led Melancholic Smile to White River City’s City Hall.

“Lord Viscount, how may I be of service today?” a female manager asked politely, smiling when she noticed Shi Feng enter the building.

“I wish to purchase some Land,” Shi Feng said.

“Please follow me.” Saying so, the female manager led Shi Feng and Melancholic Smile to a VIP meeting room.

After a short wait, a tall, middle-aged man entered the room.

“Lord Viscount, I have prepared a list of all available Commercial Land. My lord may choose any plot of land on this list, and because of your esteemed status, you will receive a 10% discount on all land.”

“Okay.”

Shi Feng only glanced through the pages, not bothering to read them in detail. He then said, “I want these two plots next to the Bank and the Auction House.”

If one pointed out the most valuable plots of Land in White River City, the first would be the plot directly beside the Auction House, the second was next to the Bank, the third was near the two aforementioned establishments, and the fourth was next to the Virtual Trade Center and the Adventurer’s Association. This held true for every city in God’s Domain.

In the past, these plots of Land had been highly sought after. Renting one of these plots for just a month could be astronomically expensive. Moreover, as God’s Domain developed, the money one could earn would grow.

Naturally, it also cost a significant sum to purchase these plots of Land. Moreover, one must also possess certain status if they wanted to purchase Land; money alone was not enough. As a Viscount, Shi Feng could only purchase a limited number of plots. Thus, he chose only one plot per location to begin his Shop’s operation.
