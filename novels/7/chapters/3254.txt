Chapter 3255 Chapter 329 – Star Lake Shaken

Great! I should get into the selection’s top 10 now!

When Thousand Scars looked at the result displayed outside the test room, she balled up her hands in excitement. She was so excited that even the other youths training in the same advanced training room could feel her excitement.

“Incredible! A three-star mental strength master at less than 20 years old! Only two other people had such a result in the selection this time, right?”

“Mhm. They are in third and sixth place, respectively. However, even though those two are the same age as Xue Qianhen, they are both successors of powerful families in Star Lake City. They’ve been cultivated using tons of resources from childhood and have already become two-star mental strength masters by 17. It then took them another two years to become three-star mental strength masters. Their starting lines are completely different from Xue Qianhen. Strictly speaking, they are far less talented than Xue Qianhen.”

!!

The youths in the training room were surprised when they saw Thousand Scars’ training results.

Thousand Scars’ achievement of becoming a three-star mental strength master before 20 was enough to put her in the top 10 of the Star Lake Legion’s selection. Unlike those who only managed to get into the top 100, she was a genius who could attract the attention of the Star Lake Legion’s commander and vice commanders.

Under normal circumstances, rookie participants assigned to the Star Lake Legion’s ace battle groups would have completely different career paths than participants assigned to other top 100 rookie participants.

Joining an ace battle group meant having more opportunities to participate in city competitions. Not only could members of ace battle groups receive sponsorship from the various corporations, but they could also acquire City Contribution Points that could be used to exchange for all sorts of tools and resources in the Greater God’s Domain. So long as one had enough City Contribution Points, one could even exchange for Legendary Weapons and Equipment in the Greater God’s Domain.

Moreover, Thousand Scars differed from the other geniuses in the Greater God’s Domain. Despite growing up without the help of the Greater World’s precious resources, she became a three-star mental strength master at the age of 19. It had already been over a decade since Star Lake City had seen the appearance of such a talented genius.

Meanwhile, the last person to have shown such talent was the Star Lake Legion’s current commander.

Red Frost!

A madwoman known by all powers on the Starlight Continent!

The next step will be to challenge Shi Feng!

Thousand Scars thought to herself before taking a deep breath. Then, just as she was about to proceed with another training session, a message notification suddenly popped up on her watch. Upon reading the message, Thousand Scars smiled and said, “Big Sis Omen and the others are finally here.”

After saying so, Thousand Scars grabbed the jacket she had set aside and walked out of the training room, causing many horny young men in the room to sigh in disappointment.

…

God’s Domain Association, first-floor lobby:

Although it was still early morning in Star Lake City, the lobby was already crowded with people waiting to take the Star Lake Legion’s selection test. Aside from those who had already taken the test multiple times, there were also many people who were taking the test for the first time. Among the latter group, they consisted of residents originating from the Greater World’s various towns and cities and newcomers to the Greater World.

“Amazing! So, this is a city in the Greater World?”

“Mental strength masters are incredibly rare in our world. Yet, they can be seen everywhere here.”

“I don’t think these people are anything special. Our world is dreadfully lacking in cultivation resources for mental strength, a stark contrast to this world. Here, you can get items brimming with mysterious energy like Soul Drops everywhere. I won’t say I can get into this so-called selection test’s top 10, but if I can get my hands on such resources, I bet you I can get into the top 100 easily.”

Currently, a group of young men and women around the age of 22 and 23 stood at the end of the long line of people waiting to take the selection test. Some of these youths wore looks of amazement, while some wore looks of contempt. However, without exception, every one of these youths was filled with feelings of excitement and anticipation.

In ordinary worlds, a person could already be regarded as a genius favored by heaven if they could become a mental strength master within their lifetime. As for becoming a mental strength grandmaster, that was an achievement not even geniuses favored by heaven dared to dream of accomplishing.

However, in the Greater World, accomplishing such an achievement wasn’t out of the question.

Although these youths didn’t speak very loudly, almost everyone in the lobby was a mental strength master, so they had no trouble hearing what these youths were saying. Yet, none of these mental strength masters laughed at these youths. On the contrary, when these mental strength masters saw the blue lightning emblem these youths wore, they promptly kept their mouths shut and minded their own business.

“Inhabitants of the Blue Flash World, is it?” Breeze Wine, who wore the employee uniform of the Green God Corporation, muttered, a flash of envy appeared in his eyes as he looked at the youths.

“Are those people incredible, Commander Breeze?” a woman with ethereal beauty standing next to Breeze Wine asked as she looked ahead at the group of youths standing at the back of the line.

“They do look extraordinary. Every one of them is a two-star mental strength master even though they are still in their early twenties,” a cold and elegant woman standing next to the ethereal beauty said in a rueful tone. “Even I am only at this standard right now. Comparisons truly are odious.”

These two women spoke in whispers, so the people around them did not hear what they said. Even so, many of the young men present couldn’t help but turn to look at the two, their faces looking as if they had just had their souls lured out of their bodies.

Although almost every woman in the Greater World was a beauty due to the high fitness standards here, these two women still stood out a lot. Whether it was their appearance, body, or temperament, they were vastly superior to the average woman in the Greater World. They could absolutely rank among Star Lake City’s top beauties.

Meanwhile, these two beauties were none other than Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul.

“The Blue Flash isn’t an ordinary world,” Breeze Wine said as he turned to Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul. Then, with a wry smile, he continued, “Instead, it is one of the few powerful worlds that have managed to elevate their God’s Domain into a Higher God’s Domain. As a result, even though the Blue Flash World’s collapse is already nearing, the world’s residents have the privilege of gaining citizenship in any third-tier city on this continent. They can also challenge the selection tests of any third-rate city for free.

“Moreover, many of the Blue Flash World’s geniuses can be found in the city legions of third-, second-, and even first-tier cities. Some of these geniuses are even bigshots who occupy high positions in their respective legions. Most importantly, the Blue Flash World has produced several peerless individuals who have gone beyond the realm of mental strength grandmasters.

“Simply put, the Blue Flash World is one of the top-ranking civilizations on the Starlight Continent, and it is far superior to our civilization.”

“Hmph. They’re only a bunch of people who got to enter the Greater World earlier than us,” a woman who closely rivaled Hidden Soul in appearances said, a hint of disdain appearing in her eyes as she looked at the youths from the Blue Flash World.

Upon hearing the third woman’s words, Breeze Wine simply chuckled and kept quiet.

Death Omen was one of the few Tier 6 experts in their homeworld, so she had incredible potential. Now, because of Thousand Scars’ recommendation, Death Omen had already gotten into the Paimon Conglomerate’s observation list. So long as Death Omen could become a titled expert within a specified time, she could become an outer member of the conglomerate.

In terms of future potential, Death Omen was vastly superior to Zero Wing’s Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul.

Shortly after Death Omen finished speaking, a lithe figure suddenly stepped out of an elevator and entered the lobby. As soon as this person appeared, she immediately attracted the attention and discussion of many people in the lobby.

“Xue Qianhen! Xue Qianhen is actually here!”

“Is she here to take the test again?”

“So soon? I wonder how many places she can rise this time?”

“Wait, no. It looks like she’s here to welcome a newcomer.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

When the surrounding crowd saw Thousand Scars approaching and talking to Death Omen with an intimate smile on her face, everyone couldn’t help but wonder about Death Omen’s identity. The young masters of some corporations even took the initiative to give their spots in line for the two.

While Death Omen and Thousand Scars were making their way to the front of the line, Death Omen suddenly turned back to look at Hidden Soul with a smirk on her face.

“You two should join the line as well,” Breeze Wine said to Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul with a wry smile when he saw Thousand Scars and Death Omen walking away. “Although it will take some time, you two should be able to get your test done and your accommodations arranged by sunset today.”

Despite Breeze Wine’s words, everyone brought here by the Green God Corporation knew there were limited rooms in the God’s Domain Association. So, the sooner they could take the test, the easier they could find a good room to rest in. If they took the test too late, even if they qualified for a good room, they could only settle for a lower-quality room if the better ones were at full occupancy.

However, Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and the others had no choice but to wait in line. After all, the only reason the people waiting in line had let Hidden Soul skip ahead of them was because of Thousand Scars.

While Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and the others were waiting to take their test, another commotion occurred in the lobby. This time, whether it was the people waiting to take their test or the people resting in the lobby, everyone turned to look at the same location.

TL Notes:

Fyi, I have no idea if the Soul Drop mentioned in this chapter is the same thing as the Soul Potion mentioned in Chapter 315.
