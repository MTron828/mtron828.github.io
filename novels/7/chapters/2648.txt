Chapter 2649 – Astonishing Ancient Legacy

Lightforged City, Crimson Silver Hotel:

As a hotel that catered to Lightforged City’s nobles, the Crimson Silver Hotel was off-limits to ordinary players and NPCs. The cost of resting in this prestigious hotel was similarly far beyond that of ordinary hotels.

Any normal room within the hotel cost 300 Magic Crystals or 10 Contribution Points to rent per day. Even Crimson Star and the others, who had become nobles of Lightforged City due to the Noble Authority Token, were unwilling to rest here.

At this moment, however, Shi Feng entered the hotel without hesitation, stunning the members of Violet Sword and Azure that saw him.

Be it 300 Magic Crystals or 10 Contribution Points, neither was cheap. Paying such a high price just for some rest was an unnecessary extravagance. Renting a room in an ordinary hotel for the price of 30 Magic Crystals or one Contribution Point was more than enough.

“My lord, how may I be of service?” a Level 180 female attendant asked respectfully as she approached Shi Feng.

“I wish to rent a normal room here,” Shi Feng said as he handed 300 Magic Crystals to the attendant.

“Very well,” the female attendant said after verifying the payment. She then took out a crystalline key and gave it to Shi Feng, saying, “My lord, here is your room key. You may choose any of the empty rooms upstairs.”

After accepting the key, Shi Feng promptly made his way to the second floor and entered one of the unoccupied rooms there.

As soon as he entered the guest room, the Mana density inside actually started rising rapidly. Just a short moment later, the ambient Mana had more than doubled already. In addition, the Mana here also gave him a soothing and calming feeling.

“Sure enough, the Mana density here is much higher than in ordinary hotels.” Shi Feng nodded in satisfaction when he sensed the room’s environment.

If he merely wanted some rest, he would’ve gone to an ordinary hotel. However, he didn’t intend to rest, but to obtain the Ancient Legacy recorded inside the Memory Crystal. Hence, he could not afford to be careless.

The noble hotel was much safer than the ordinary hotels in the city. This point was obvious just by looking at its attendants and guards. Every NPC here was at least a Level 180, Tier 3 NPC. They were not existences current players could afford to provoke.

In addition, the noble hotel was protected by a ridiculously strong fourfold, defensive magic array. Under normal circumstances, even Tier 5 existences would pose no threat to this magic array, let alone Tier 3 and Tier 4 existences.

Now that Shi Feng no longer had to worry about external disruptions, he immediately took out the Memory Crystal from his bag and readied himself to read its contents.

The Memory Crystal he obtained would remain in existence for only two natural days. He had already spent a lot of this time raising his Concentration standard. Now, he had less than three hours left to read it.

“Now that my Concentration has reached the Tier 4 standard, I should be able to read it, right?” Shi Feng could not help being nervous as he tapped his finger on the Memory Crystal.

On this trip to the ancient secret land, his greatest harvest would definitely have to be the Memory Crystal. In fact, everything else he obtained from this trip couldn’t even come close to half the value of this Memory Crystal.

If he still couldn’t read the information contained in it, then he really would die from heartache.

In the next moment, the sound of a system notification entered his ears.

...

System: Warning! You have discovered a Large Memory Crystal. According to your current Concentration, if you read the recorded information completely, there is a very small chance you will enter a deep coma. Do you still wish to read the information?

...

“There’s still a risk?” Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the system notification. “Just what is in this thing?”

Although the Tier 4 standard was not the apex of God’s Domain, it was definitely above average. Even a king had to take Tier 4 existences seriously.

Now, however, despite his Concentration having reached the Tier 4 standard already, reading the recorded information still involved a bit of risk. This was simply unbelievable.

“Although there is a risk, I want to see what is recorded in this thing!” Gritting his teeth, Shi Feng chose to read the information in the Memory Crystal.

Memory Crystals that contained Ancient Legacies were incredibly rare in God’s Domain. In fact, they could be counted on the fingers of one’s hands.

Previously, due to the “very large” chance of him falling into a deep coma, Shi Feng did not dare read the recorded information. However, now that the risk had become “very small,” he naturally had to try. After all, he wouldn’t get another opportunity like this again in the future.

After he chose to read the contents of the Memory Crystal, the large crystal in his hand started rapidly gathering Mana from its surroundings. It then released a dazzling glow that brightly illuminated the entire room.

Afterward, a beam of white light shot out from the Memory Crystal and into Shi Feng’s forehead.

For a time, Shi Feng sensed countless images and texts being transferred into his brain; the amount of the information was simply astonishing. It felt as if he had just plunged into a sea of knowledge.

Ten minutes...

Twenty minutes...

One hour...

For the first half-hour, Shi Feng still felt fine after receiving the copious information. However, after the transfer process continued for 40 minutes, he felt a stinging in his head as if someone was using a needle to poke his brain. Meanwhile, as time passed, this stinging sensation only intensified.

After 80 minutes into the transfer process, Shi Feng felt as if his brain was about to explode. Right then, the beam the Memory Crystal released disappeared. Immediately afterward, the crystal shattered into countless fragments and vanished from the room.

As for Shi Feng, his body swayed slightly, as his mind was in a mess. And when he opened his eyes, the world spun around him.

How close! If the transfer process had continued for a few more minutes, I might’ve fainted.

At this moment, Shi Feng felt that the system had tricked him. Despite the warning stating that there was only a very small chance for him to fall into a deep coma, he was clearly very close to breaching the mental protection system, which would have forced him into a deep coma for a very long time. Then, he would definitely die of regret.

However, after resting for a few minutes, Shi Feng started feeling much better, the pain in his head having lessened significantly. Meanwhile, the information he had received also came into focus.

“This is a lie, right?! A Small...Mobile Fortress Design?”

Stunned, Shi Feng wondered if the system was playing a joke on him when he looked at the images and texts displayed before him.

In God’s Domain, fortresses were much more valuable than towns. After all, aside from providing players with a place to rest, fortresses possessed far greater offensive and defensive capabilities than towns. They were shelters made for all kinds of warfare.

Even a Small Fortress could easily fend off the assault of a large number of Tier 4 existences. Moreover, fortresses had much lower production costs and operation costs; hence, they had been highly popular among the various powers in the past. During Shi Feng’s previous life, over 70% of the player shelters found in Level 100-plus maps were fortresses.

However, the design currently displayed before him was a cut above even ordinary fortresses. In fact, even during his previous life, he had the fortune to witness such constructions only a few times.

This construction was the Mobile Fortress!

It was a fortress that could drive countless powers crazy!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
