Chapter 101 - Entering Hell Once More

Ridiculed by Zhao Yueru in such a way, the expressions on Shi Feng’s party members turned dark. Even if Blackie loved beautiful women, he was still unable to overlook such an action. How could a great beauty like her have such a poisonous mouth? Although Blackie wanted to refute her, his words were unable to leave his mouth.

The Dark Moon Graveyard was just too hard. Even if they believed in Shi Feng’s strengths and techniques, when faced with so many Elites and Special Elites, who could guarantee that they’d be able to pass through?

“What? Nothing to say?” Zhao Yueru asked coldly when Shi Feng had remained silent as if he were in deep thought.

The members of Ouroboros were also looking at Shi Feng with disdain. They were already feeling despair towards the Dark Moon Graveyard, and even Gentle Snow felt helpless. So, what could a Beta Tester, with only some slightly good techniques, do?

“You’re just a Beta Tester. Who doesn’t know how to talk big? If you have the ability, then you take command and kill all of those monsters. If you don’t, stop spouting bullshit.”

“Humph! Just a bunch of independent players foolishly making second-guesses after we can’t get through.”

The members of Ouroboros all had their own arrogance. They all supported Zhao Yueru, one after another. They hurtled all sorts of ridicule towards Shi Feng, venting the despair in their hearts.

“What did guys you say?”

“If it weren’t for Brother Feng, would you still be alive right now?”

Shi Feng’s party members could no longer stand by idly and watch. Every one of them revealed expressions of anger, intentions of starting a fight surfacing.

If it weren’t for Shi Feng’s warning, both of the team’s MTs would have died. Without the MTs to act as meat-shields, the players behind would have definitely died, and it would be lucky if even a few survived.

Just as both sides were about to start a dispute, a deep muffled voice came from the team, disrupting everyone’s argument. Every one of the team members was dumbstruck, thinking they had misheard.

“After observing the surrounding area and those monsters, I’ve thought of a way to get through the fog. I wonder if Miss Snow would be willing to let me take command?” Shi Feng faintly smiled as he looked at Gentle Snow. Regarding the ridicules of Zhao Yueru and the others, Shi Feng did not mind them in the slightest. That was because everything was going according to his plan. From the moment Zhao Yueru started mocking him, his goals had already been achieved. If Zhao Yueru and the others did not react the way they did, how would he be able to seize the opportunity to take the initiative?

“If you can lead everyone across the fog, it won’t be a problem to pass leadership to you.”

Gentle Snow’s iceberg-like expression faintly changed. Being able to get through the fog was a good thing. She was also not a petty person. It was just that, for some reason, when she looked at Shi Feng’s smile, she had a faint feeling of disharmony as if all of this was within Shi Feng’s grasp.

“Snow, I was only joking. How could you give this bastard leadership over the team?” Zhao Yueru panicked. Ouroboros’ First Vice-Leader was actually being commanded by an outsider. Wouldn’t that make them the laughingstock of the other first-rate Guilds? They would call out Ouroboros for their inability.

“If you have any other methods to pass through, I won’t really mind,” Shi Feng shrugged, spreading his hands to signify that he did not care.

Zhao Yueru wanted to dissuade Gentle Snow. She had only been speaking out of anger before. If Shi Feng had really become the team’s leader, then wouldn’t an upheaval occur within the team? Who would be willing to submit to an independent player? Even if Shi Feng’s techniques were quite good, there were still heaps of such personnel within the Guild.

“Okay, now is not the time to care about reputation. Clearing this Dungeon is our priority. From now on, Ye Feng will command the team. His words are my words. If anybody doesn’t listen, you’ll know the consequences,” Gentle Snow said in a chilling tone.

Gentle Snow naturally knew Zhao Yueru’s concerns. She, too, had considered the problems. However, if they gave up the Team Dungeon’s First Clear due to this little reputation, that would truly cause their Guild to become the laughingstock of other Guilds.

“Alright, then. Whatever you say. However, if he doesn’t command us adequately, only blindly giving out orders, I won’t obey.” Zhao Yueru shot a glance at Shi Feng in anger. She did not believe that Shi Feng could properly command the team, not to mention lead them through the fogged area. After all, Shi Feng was just an independent player. It was impossible for him to have any experience in commanding a team. In a moment, she would watch and make fun of Shi Feng making a fool of himself.

Seeing that Gentle Snow had already nodded her head in agreement, Shi Feng unhurriedly said, “Since we’re done with the matter of leadership, let’s talk about the matter of distribution. All of the equipment will be given out according to Job requirements, while the other items will be auctioned within the team. Any problems?”

“Ye Feng! Don’t go overboard!” Zhao Yueru glared at Shi Feng like a wrathful tigress.

“Miss Zhao, I’m not trying to swindle even a single item. We’re just fairly competing inside the Dungeon, so is there a need to talk about going overboard?” Shi Feng calmly smiled.

Previously, Shi Feng agreed to Gentle Snow’s arrangements because he did not possess the power to back himself up.

He knew the strategy to conquer the Dark Moon Graveyard. However, he couldn’t reveal that fact earlier. After all, Team Dungeons had not activated during the Beta Test of God’s Domain. Hence, if Shi Feng were to reveal knowledge that not even Beta Testers of God’s Domain had, Gentle Snow and the others would definitely become suspicious.

Now, everyone was aware of the Dark Moon Graveyard’s information. Moreover, Shi Feng, himself, had followed them into the Dungeon. As long as Shi Feng performed thinking up a strategy, naturally, no one would question him.

Even the astute Gentle Snow would not suspect Shi Feng had long since known how to conquer the Dark Moon Graveyard.

“You...” Zhao Yueru became speechless from anger. She felt Shi Feng was just a scoundrel intoxicated by success.

On the other hand, Gentle Snow did not hesitate as she revealed a faint smile, calmly saying, “Alright. As long as we can get through, I’ll agree to your conditions.”

“Snow!” Zhao Yueru did not dare believe her own ears. Gentle Snow agreed, just like that. Recipes for Lifestyle Jobs! The ones dropped from Team Dungeons were even more priceless! How could they just let others take advantage of them?

“Enough. It’s all just a waste of breath if we can’t get through the Dungeon. If we manage to get through and an item drops, we’ll just buy it as is. Do you think an independent player like Ye Feng is wealthier than us?” Gentle Snow softly explained.

Hearing this, Zhao Yueru came to a realization. If they were competing regarding capabilities, even a hundred Ye Fengs would not be a match for them. At the end of the day, the item would still be theirs.

“Humph! Humph! Be pleased with yourself while you can.” Zhao Yueru’s mood greatly improved. She even looked forward to clearing the Dungeon as quickly as possible, obtaining several recipes. She wanted Shi Feng to know just how foolish his decision was.

“Since I will be commanding the team from now on, let’s first leave the Dungeon and re-enter it once everybody gathers,” Shi Feng took out a Return Scroll and started chanting.

Using a Return Scroll inside a Dungeon would automatically send players back to the Dungeon’s entrance, saving players the wasted time running back.

The others also promptly took out Return Scrolls after watching Shi Feng do so.

Indeed, three people had died in the team, so some reorganization was necessary.

Outside the Dark Moon Graveyard, many teams belonging to Guilds had returned after dying. They were currently reorganizing themselves, preparing to challenge the Dungeon once more.

When they saw the Snow Goddess and her team leave the Dungeon, they all were abruptly shocked. All of them hurriedly looked towards the Glory List at the Dungeon’s entrance.

The Snow Goddess’ fame was extremely great. In addition to so many of her team members leaving through the Dungeon’s entrance, there was a high chance that they had already cleared the Dungeon. However, the Glory List was still as empty as ever. Everyone let loose a breath of relief. They continued with their rest, discussing how they would raid the Dungeon.

After over a dozen minutes, the entire team was assembled. Everyone, once more, walked towards the Teleportation Gate.

As the leader of the team, Shi Feng immediately adjusted the Dungeon’s difficulty to Hell Mode.

Immediately, the color of the Teleportation Gate changed. A flickering image of a ghost’s head appeared, causing others to shudder.

Before anyone within the team could react, they turned into black rays of light as they entered the Dark Moon Graveyard.

Outside the Dungeon’s entrance, the members of the various Guilds were all dumbfounded.

What sort of situation was this?

Didn’t they just enter Normal Mode once? After understanding some information about the Dark Moon Graveyard, they’re already starting to raid Hell Mode?

Was there a need to be so strong-willed?
