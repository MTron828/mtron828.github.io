Chapter 393 – Black Flame’s Strength?

“What happened?”

“All those Tier 4 experts are gone, just like that?”

When the players fighting against the innumerable Void Creatures on the void sea saw the army of several hundred thousand Tier 4 experts plunging into the sea, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

!!

“Tell me I’m dreaming, Aunt…” Franz mumbled to Favra when he saw the Paimon Conglomerate’s Tier 4 experts dropping like flies. Even with his status, this was the first time he had seen several hundred thousand Tier 4 experts getting killed in the blink of an eye.

The shock Franz experienced was further intensified when he saw Shi Feng suddenly emerging from the floating island and quietly watching the army of Tier 4 experts plunging into the ocean like a heavenly god.

Normally, a Tier 4 army of such size could take on even Tier 6 experts with the help of a magic barrier. Yet, now, the entire army had gotten obliterated. Everything had happened so quickly that Franz didn’t even know what had happened.

Fear!

Unprecedented fear sprouted in the depths of Franz’s heart.

It should be known that the Tier 4 experts in the Paimon Conglomerate’s army weren’t a bunch of random nobodies. They would be regarded as mid-level mainstays if put in an ordinary hegemonic power. Many among them were even experts superior to him. If even these experts were erased in the blink of an eye, it went without saying he would do no better than them if put in their shoes.

“Divine Might!” With her wealth of experience, Favra quickly understood the cause of the Tier 4 experts’ fall, and this realization caused her expression to grow serious. “That’s…a Divine Might surpassing Tier 6 Gods!”

“A Divine Might that has surpassed Tier 6 Gods?” The fear in Franz’s eyes intensified when he heard his aunt’s words. “Doesn’t that mean…”

“Yes! That’s an Ancient God’s Divine Might!” Favra said in a grave tone. “Although I don’t know what Black Flame has done, he has indeed managed to borrow the strength of an Ancient God!”

Ancient Gods were existences beyond Tier 6 Gods. In the minds of the average player, Ancient Gods had long vanished from the Greater God’s Domain, and their existences were akin to myths that only existed in books. However, the various hegemonic powers knew that wasn’t the case at all. Not only were Ancient Gods still present in the Greater God’s Domain, but they were also unavoidable existences for those seeking to ascend to the Greater God’s Domain’s apex.

Meanwhile, the various hegemonic powers and conglomerates had one simple instruction for their members to do should they come across an Ancient God.

—Run!

In the eyes of Ancient Gods, all existences beneath Tier 6 were no different than ants they could effortlessly crush if they were in a bad mood.

Moreover, it wouldn’t be a simple death. Players beneath Tier 5 would be at an incredibly high risk of suffering Soul Annihilation, while even Tier 5 players would have a real chance of suffering Soul Annihilation.

Hence, Ancient Gods were existences even more terrifying than natural disasters.

…

Is this an Ancient God’s strength?

Outside the floating island, Saint Arm’s face turned pale as he looked at the hundreds of thousands of corpses floating on the void sea beneath him.

Ancient Gods were rarely seen in the Greater God’s Domain, and there was very little information about them, even in the Paimon Conglomerate’s database. The only thing the Paimon Conglomerate was certain of was that Ancient Gods were existences to be feared.

However, after witnessing the instant annihilation of several hundred thousand Tier 4 experts and the petrification of over a thousand Tier 5 experts, Saint Arm felt that Ancient Gods were even more terrifying than rumored.

“Lunatic! That Black Flame must be a lunatic! He’s trying to drag all of us down with him!” Dira cursed and gnashed his teeth when he saw Shi Feng emerging from the floating island. He didn’t think Shi Feng would be so crazy as to deliberately provoke an Ancient God to have them accompany him in death. “Quick! Everyone, get rid of him! Only if he dies can we appease the Ancient God’s wrath!”

An Ancient God’s wrath was devastating, and all non-Tier 6 players would have a chance of suffering Soul Annihilation.

At this time, Dira wasn’t the only person to have figured out the situation. White Owl and the others also realized Shi Feng’s plan. Immediately, they activated their respective Berserk Skills without hesitation, increasing their Basic Attributes to resist the powerful Divine Might. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, even White Owl, one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Ten Great Paragons, could only exhibit one-third of her usual mobility under the effects of the Ancient God’s Divine Might. She couldn’t use any powerful combat techniques in this state, so she could only rely on Tier 5 Skills to kill Shi Feng.

Only, before White Owl could use a Tier 5 Skill, a 20-meter-tall giant clad in a white robe suddenly appeared before Shi Feng. Then, the axe of light the giant wielded transformed into thousands of blinding beams that attacked Shi Feng from all directions.

The beams vaporized everything in their path. Even the Superior Mythic-ranked Void Sea Dragons that got struck were instantly reduced to ashes.

By the time White Owl had reacted to the situation, over a hundred Tier 5 experts caught within the Ancient God’s attack radius had already gotten killed, their existences getting erased so thoroughly that they didn’t even drop any of their equipment on death. At the end of the Ancient God’s attack, Shi Feng was the only person still alive within the giant’s attack radius.

He blocked it?

White Owl’s eyes widened in shock.

Not even she had managed to react to the Ancient God’s attack. Yet, Shi Feng had not only reacted to it, but he had even blocked it in time. Although Shi Feng had lost over half of his HP from blocking the attack and the two swords he wielded were trembling violently, he could practically be considered unharmed compared to the Tier 5 experts who were instantly killed.

White Owl wasn’t the only person feeling dazed at this moment. Spectating from a distance, Death Omen and Thousand Scars were also stunned when they saw Shi Feng successfully blocking the Ancient God’s attack.

However, before everyone could come back to their senses, the white-robed Ancient God reformed their axe of light and swung it, executing an attack that exuded power several times greater than before.

“It’s over… All of us are doomed…” Death Omen fell into despair when she sensed the mana gathering around the axe of light. By her estimates, the Ancient God’s following attack could most likely annihilate everything within a 10,000-yard radius at the very least. And if Tier 4 players like them were to die from this attack, they would most definitely suffer Soul Annihilation…

It seems this is my current limit, Shi Feng thought as he looked at the trembling Winter of Eternal Night. Then, after taking a deep breath, he looked to the white-robed Ancient God and said, “But don’t go thinking you can get rid of me so easily.”

After saying so, Shi Feng raised the Shadow Incinerator he wielded in his left hand at the Ancient God.

Incinerator’s Phantasm!
