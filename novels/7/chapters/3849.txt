Chapter 3850 - 924 - One-Man Army?

Everlasting City, Plot 059:

Plot 059 was situated several thousand meters above ground. At this time, 4,000 figures descended upon it and separated into 40 teams. Then, these teams spread across the land in all directions like a swarm of locusts, eliminating the other players on the land.

While King’s Paradise’s forces were seizing control of Plot 059, Lunar River arrived at the edge of Plot 059 with several dozen private guards. She showed no interest in the battle taking place in Plot 059. Instead, she quietly observed the situation of the other plots of land.

“Vice Guild Leader, everything is going according to plan. None of the neighboring plots have teams from apex or royal powers. The teams of our allies have also arrived safely, so we will soon have a force of 10,000 players. As for Angel’s Retribution, which we excluded from our alliance, its forces suddenly took action against Zero Wing,” Shuoyun reported.

“Who is leading Angel’s Retribution’s forces?” Lunar River asked.

“According to our intelligence, Crocodile Fang is the commander, while Angel’s Retribution’s main force commander, Blacksteel, is acting as his vice commander,” Shuoyun answered. Then, she continued worriedly, “Angel’s Retribution has mobilized 2,000 players this time, while Zero Wing has only a little over 600. Zero Wing might not hold out against Angel’s Retribution.”

“That old fellow let his son lead over Blacksteel?” Lunar River was slightly surprised.

The commander of every major power’s main force had extraordinary status. They were either the Guild’s First Vice Guild Leader or one of the Guild’s Grand Elders.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Blacksteel was well-known in the Angel Sanctuary. Over half a century ago, he was already recognized as one of the Angel Sanctuary’s top ten experts. Now, he was even considered one of Angel’s Retribution’s Six Overlords. Yet, Crocodile Fang was assigned to lead Angel’s Retribution’s forces in Everlasting City’s competition instead of Blacksteel. No matter how Lunar River looked at it, this situation was unbelievable.

Amidst her confusion, Lunar River received a communication request. The caller was none other than Angel’s Retribution’s Blacksteel.

“Commander Blacksteel, are you perhaps calling me to reconsider allying with Angel’s Retribution?” Lunar River asked nonchalantly, looking at the stalwart middle-aged man carrying a greatsword in the video chat.

“That’s right. Although you’ve repeatedly refused our request for partnership before, I am confident you won’t refuse us again this time,” Blacksteel said, looking at Lunar River. “I know you are trying to partner with Zero Wing to get ahold of the Tower of the Abyss. However, it seems that Zero Wing’s Guild Leader has been reluctant to agree to your partnership. So, I will create an opportunity for you. It is no longer a secret that Crocodile Fang has a grudge against Black Flame. Even if Angel’s Retribution takes action against Zero Wing in this competition, none of the other human powers will say anything.”

“Are you saying you will do me a favor?” Lunar River asked, her expression remaining indifferent.

“It will depend on your willingness to cooperate.” Blacksteel chuckled. “If you partner with us, we will naturally show Zero Wing mercy out of consideration that it will become one of our future partners. But if you refuse, we will show no mercy. At that time, even if you secure an Eternal World Magic Array, you won’t be able to transfer it to Zero Wing.”

“You are very calculating, Commander Blacksteel,” Lunar River said, chuckling. It was obvious Blacksteel had contacted her with the knowledge that King’s Paradise’s forces were currently occupied and couldn’t assist Zero Wing. “But aren’t you underestimating Zero Wing and me a little too much?”

“Underestimate you? Never,” Blacksteel said, smiling. If you decide to take action personally, we will naturally be powerless to do anything against Zero Wing. But are you really willing to expose your strength at this critical moment?”

“Are you challenging me?” Lunar River’s gaze sharpened.

“Five minutes!” Blacksteel extended five fingers at Lunar River. “You have five minutes to consider whether to expose your strength to save Zero Wing or reestablish King’s Paradise’s partnership with Angel’s Retribution. I will contact you again in five minutes.”

Blacksteel hung up after saying so, his words causing the King’s Paradise members around Lunar River to become deathly silent.

“Vice Guild Leader, should we take action?” Shuoyun asked.

“The competition has just started. It’s still too soon for us to make a move,” Lunar River said. Then, she commanded Shuoyun and the rest of her private guards, “You all make a trip down below. I don’t need you to save the others. You only need to rescue Black Flame. Make sure not to move within 100 yards of Blacksteel. None of you are a match for him yet. You won’t be able to escape if you get within 100 yards of him.”

“Understood!”

Shuoyun and Lunar River’s other private guards bowed and left.

…

On the other side, Angel’s Retribution’s 2,000-man legion arrived within a thousand yards of Zero Wing’s team.

“Uncle Blacksteel, how did it go?” Crocodile Fang asked nervously, looking at the stalwart middle-aged man beside him. “Did she agree?”

In reality, Crocodile Fang was only a puppet commander; Blacksteel was the legion’s true commander. Crocodile Fang was assigned to command Angel’s Retribution’s forces this time to make up for his mistake. If he couldn’t complete his assignment of reestablishing the partnership with King’s Paradise, his good days would end.

“Three minutes!” Blacksteel did not respond to Crocodile Fang’s question. Instead, he looked at the 100 experts standing respectfully behind him. Every one of these 100 experts was equipped with multiple Fragmented Divine Artifacts and exuded a dangerous aura. “Lunar River’s people should arrive about three minutes later, so I want you all to eliminate everyone except Zero Wing’s Guild Leader in three minutes!”

“Yes, Commander!”

The 100 experts responded confidently in unison, as if killing Zero Wing’s 600-plus experts in three minutes was a trivial matter. They immediately charged Zero Wing’s forces, their speed so fast that even Tier 6 experts could only catch a glimpse of their afterimages. If one observed them carefully, one would notice that they were all executing Gold-ranked Footwork.

Is this the main force’s strength? Crocodile Fang was astonished by the speed of these experts.

This was the first time Crocodile Fang had seen Angel’s Retribution’s main force in action. Blacksteel had always been responsible for managing and training Angel’s Retribution’s main force. As a result, besides Angel’s Retribution’s Guild Leader, everyone else in the Guild was in the dark about the strength of Angel’s Retribution’s main force members. However, after seeing them in action, Crocodile Fang finally understood why it was mentioned that these main force members were 90% of the reason Angel’s Retribution dared to participate in Everlasting City’s competition.

…

When Angel’s Retribution’s main force members went into action, over at Zero Wing’s resting area…

“Guild Leader Black Flame, do you need our intervention?” Purgatory Jade asked, looking at the 100 players closing in on them.

Based on her observation, Angel’s Retribution’s 100 experts were all very strong. Although their combat standards were inferior to the chosen ones under her tutelage, their equipment standards were much better. They weren’t opponents that Zero Wing’s members, most of whom hadn’t even reached Level 220, could handle.

“No need.” Shi Feng shook his head. Then, he looked at Phoenix Rain and said, “Rain, I’ll leave them to you.”

“Me? Can I?” Phoenix Rain asked, surprised that Shi Feng would let her take action.

“Mhm. It would be the easiest for you to deal with this situation,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “But don’t go all out. It’d be bad if we caused too much of a commotion.”

“Okay, I’ll try my best,” Phoenix Rain sighed and stepped forward.

When Phoenix Rain stepped forward by herself, the advancing main force members and the spectating members of Angel’s Retribution were stunned. They had never expected Zero Wing to send only one person to fight them.

“Is Zero Wing taking us for the Eternal Realm’s little fellows?!”

Angel’s Retribution’s main force members laughed when they saw Phoenix Rain raising her staff and chanting. At the same time, a cold glint flashed in their eyes. After going unmatched in the Angel Sanctuary for so long, they hadn’t expected to be underestimated by a small Guild in the Eternal Realm.

When Angel’s Retribution’s main force members got within 100 yards of Phoenix Rain, she finally finished chanting and gestured toward Angel’s Retribution’s forces with her free hand.
