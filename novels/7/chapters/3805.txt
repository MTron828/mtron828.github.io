Chapter 880 – Primordial Royal Power’s Foundation

“Do you know this Godly Relic?”

Kowloon Demon looked at Shi Feng in surprise. He hadn’t expected Shi Feng to be able to recognize the tattered paper, much less name it. After all, he had gone to great lengths to uncover its identity.

Additionally, the Chapter of Space had been stored in Dragon’s Crown’s Guild Warehouse since the Guild’s inception. If not for the secret information he had obtained from an ancient ruin, he might never have bothered to pay the ridiculous price to exchange it.

“I know a little bit.” Shi Feng nodded. “The Chapter of Space is one of the seven types of power contained within the Seven Luminaries Codex, a Godly Relic that has existed since the birth of God’s Domain. It is rumored to have the power of spatial teleportation.”

Shi Feng had been searching for the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments. However, he had located only the Chapter of Time thus far. Although he knew that the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary contained a fragment of the Codex, he hadn’t thought it would be in this remnant primordial world. He also hadn’t expected it to be in Kowloon Demon’s possession. After all, the Seven Luminaries Codex never reacted.

“That’s right.” Kowloon Demon nodded. Then, he confidently stated, “This Godly Relic should be powerful enough to take us out. Although it can only let us leave for a limited period and will forcibly teleport us back once time is up, it is the only viable method I can think of.”

“Indeed.” Shi Feng did not doubt Kowloon Demon’s words.

The Seven Luminaries Codex was no ordinary Godly Relic. It was rumored that even Primordial Gods had sought to possess its power. The Goddess of Space had even created a replica of it. Thus, the Seven Luminaries Codex shouldn’t have difficulty bypassing the Primordial Flame Dragon’s seal.

“Consider this Dragon’s Crown’s token of sincerity,” Kowloon Demon said, gritting his teeth as he handed the Chapter of Space to Shi Feng. “With this item, once you leave this world, you can soul-teleport up to 100 friends to your side at the cost of 500 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal per friend. The soul teleport lasts three days and has a cooldown of seven natural days.

“Dragon’s Crown’s members will add you as a friend before you leave. Once you teleport us to your side, we will pay you the teleportation cost plus ten million Undying Souls. What do you think?”

Kowloon Demon would have preferred not to give Shi Feng the Chapter of Space if possible. However, he knew he was unlikely to meet another group of players like Shi Feng. Moreover, even if players from another world came here, Dragon’s Crown wouldn’t necessarily be the first to meet them.

Simply put, Dragon’s Crown could only partner with Shi Feng to access the world outside, while Shi Feng didn’t necessarily have to partner with Dragon’s Crown to access this world’s resources.

“It’s a good deal,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the Chapter of Space he had obtained for free. “But before we proceed with this deal, I need you to agree to a few conditions. So long as you agree to them, I can sign a God’s Domain Contract with you immediately to seal the deal. If not, I can’t accept this Chapter of Space.”

“What are your conditions?” Kowloon Demon asked without hesitation.

“Firstly, I can bear all of the teleportation expenses, but you must trade at least 10,000 Level 235-plus Epic Weapons and Equipment with me each time you go out. Of course, I will buy them at market price. Additionally, you are not allowed to sell Taboo Weapons and Equipment to other powers,” Shi Feng stated.

“No problem. Since you are Dragon’s Crown’s partner, we naturally won’t cooperate with other powers outside,” Kowloon Demon said, nodding.

“Secondly, I hope you can help me when needed. I will compensate you appropriately for your assistance,” Shi Feng stated in a non-negotiable tone.

Dragon’s Crown was a royal power operating in this remnant primordial world. It would be a huge waste to only trade with the Guild, especially with Zero Wing’s current precarious situation in God’s Domain. Zero Wing needed more strength to contend with apex powers and royal powers.

“I have no problem with this condition, either. We are partners. Dragon’s Crown will naturally ensure its partner’s safety.” Kowloon Demon accepted the second condition without hesitation.

“Lastly, I require manpower to raid the Northern Badlands’ Taboo,” Shi Feng said. Then, after pausing to think for a moment, he continued, “If we successfully kill the Taboo, I want only half of its loot and priority in choosing the first item. If you agree to help, I will sign a contract promising ten consecutive teleport sessions.”

The Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss was an important step in Shi Feng’s preparation to slay the Undying Mother. When it came to sourcing experts, Dragon’s Crown was naturally more reliable than the Pale Horn adventurer team. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“You are aiming for that Taboo?”

Kowloon Demon was surprised. He hadn’t expected Shi Feng’s objective to be the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss. After all, the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss was a significant challenge, even for Dragon’s Crown. Moreover, it sounded like Shi Feng was confident in taking down the Taboo Boss, with or without Dragon’s Crown.

“Give me three days. I will bring you a team of players as strong as myself in three days. Moreover, they are all experts at Level 240 or above,” Kowloon Demon said after pondering for a moment. “Of course, if you are in a hurry, I can also get you a 100-man team that’s much stronger than any team you can find in Nightmare Holy City.”

“One hundred experts as strong as you?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but be astonished by Kowloon Demon’s nonchalant attitude.

Although Shi Feng had long since known that a royal power in this remnant primordial world would not be weak, he didn’t expect Dragon’s Crown to be this terrifying. Even if the 100 experts Kowloon Demon promised weren’t all at the sixth-floor standard, as long as they could match him in Basic Attributes, it would still be a frightening team.

It would be like having a team of 100 South Lakes. Not even the Greater God’s Domain’s apex powers could necessarily come up with such a line-up.

Subsequently, Kowloon Demon signed a God’s Domain Contract with Shi Feng on behalf of Dragon’s Crown. According to the contract, so long as Shi Feng left the remnant primordial world, he had to initiate the first teleport session within ten days. He also had to conduct ten teleport sessions back-to-back. As for the compensation of 100 million Undying Souls for the ten teleport sessions, Dragon’s Crown would pay 50% of it as a deposit on the first teleport session. This could be considered Shi Feng’s fourth condition.

After signing the contract, Kowloon Demon dismissed the Dimensional World and left the library immediately, leaving the spectators shocked and excited. They had never thought that Nightmare Holy City’s number-one expert would lose. After today, the status quo in Nightmare Holy City would most likely undergo drastic changes.

Nightmare Holy City, Nightmare Hotel:

“Kowloon, do you have any idea what you are saying?”

Currently, Kowloon Demon stood facing a crystal ball with a graceful female knight inside. Although the female knight spoke in a neutral tone, he couldn’t help but tense up in fear.

“Not only are you asking for the chosen ones I’ve trained, but you also want them to raid a Taboo Boss for a bunch of outsiders? Are you tired of being the Guild’s number-one chosen one? Do you want to get replaced? Or do you think the kids I nurtured are disposable assets you can squander?”

“Big Sis Jade, listen to me.” Wiping the sweat on his forehead, Kowloon Demon explained, “I am doing this to help you. This person I met in Nightmare Holy City is extraordinary. I’ve already established a partnership with him. If this deal works out, I promise those chosen ones under you will achieve excellent results in the next Battle of the Two Royals. They will surpass the chosen ones training under the other Vice Guild Leaders. At that time, you will also be promoted to First Vice Guild Leader.”
