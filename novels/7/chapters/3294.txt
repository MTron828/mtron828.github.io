Chapter 369 – Laura Crader Arrives

Thunder Fortress, Red Moon Harbor:

One after another, ships continued to pour into the Thunder Fortress from the Sea of Dark Thunder. Apart from Advanced Ships, there were many Bronze Speedboats and even Warships among these ships, their numbers far greater than the ships that had entered the Thunder Fortress the past few days.

This scene shocked the players who had only recently arrived at the Thunder Fortress.

However, their shock wasn’t solely due to the great number of ships. Instead, it was also because of the strength of the players alighting from these ships.

!!

The majority of these new arrivals were independent players. These independent players arrived in teams, and there would be at least two or three Tier 4 players in every 20-man team. In addition, every one of these independent players was at Level 134 and above and was fully clad in Epic Weapons and Equipment. The equipment standard of these independent teams was already comparable to the various powers’ main forces.

“Sure enough, those guys came running here as well,” a tall, middle-aged man who had just alighted from a Bronze Speedboat said, a wry smile appearing on his face when he saw the several dozen attention-grabbing teams at the harbor.

At the same time as this middle-aged man stepped onto the harbor, the other independent teams at the harbor also turned their attention to him.

The reason all these independent teams paid attention to the middle-aged man wasn’t just because he was a Level 135, Tier 4 Shield Warrior or the 20-man team he led was fully composed of Tier 4 players. More than that, it was because of the adventurer team the middle-aged man represented.

Five Dragons’ Fang!

Apart from Guilds, adventurer teams were also a formidable force in the Greater God’s Domain.

In fact, over 60% of the Greater God’s Domain’s the trade and transportation industries were under the various adventurer teams’ control.

Meanwhile, out of the many adventurer teams in the Greater God’s Domain, Five Dragons’ Fang was a considerably famous top adventurer team in the Starlight Realm, ranking among the top 100 of the Starlight Realm’s adventurer teams. Although Five Dragons’ Fang had fewer than 100,000 members, which was nothing compared to hegemonic powers with tens or hundreds of millions of members, its overall strength and influence were enough to deter the various hegemonic powers from provoking it.

“It can’t be helped, Commander. Any adventurer team worth their salt will know that it’s impossible to continue staying in the Miniature Ancient World. Now, all we can do is earn some contribution points from the Adventurer’s Association before packing up and leaving,” a Level 136, Tier 4 female Oracle said, sighing.

Originally, the various adventurer teams were supposed to enter the World Passage on the second day after its opening to sweep the leftover Void monsters that various hegemonic powers couldn’t be bothered to take care of. After all, although the World Passage’s opening rewards were tempting, most of the adventurer teams currently operating in the Miniature Ancient World had come here to do trade and sell transportation services.

Firstly, plenty of precious resources were available in the Miniature Ancient World. While the various hegemonic powers would take control of most of these resources, a significant sum would still be available on the open market. If the various adventurer teams resold these leftover resources in the Greater God’s Domain, a significant profit could still be made. Not to mention, they could also resell resources exclusive to the Greater God’s Domain in the Miniature Ancient World, making an equally large profit.

Secondly, even after an isolated world’s World Passage opened, traveling between said world and the Greater God’s Domain wouldn’t be easy. Even the various hegemonic powers’ elite teams could face annihilation if they weren’t careful.

Moreover, the danger in a World Passage wasn’t constant. Instead, it would change depending on the World Passage’s activation degree and the standard of the world it was connected to. Because of this, many players lacking strength might never be able to travel between worlds unless they received outside help, and this was where the various adventurer teams came in.

Unfortunately, now that Shi Feng had gone and killed Dira, the Miniature Ancient World had become an incredibly dangerous place, and any adventurer team worth its salt would know not to stay in this world for even a second longer. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Indeed,” the middle-aged man nodded. “The Divine Seal Saint has gone crazy after learning about Dira’s death, so much so that he has mobilized the Commander Wind Seal to block off the entire World Passage. From what I heard, the Divine Seal Saint is planning to eliminate Black Flame and everyone related to him…”

The Divine Seal Saint had four mighty experts working under him, also known as the Four Seals. Not only did the Four Seals receive the Divine Seal Legacy, but each of them also led a team of 100 Tier 6 experts, and just one of these teams was enough to obliterate an ordinary hegemonic power.

Although the Divine Seal Saint was only targeting Black Flame and those related to him, who could say for certain others wouldn’t be implicated?

If any unlucky team or player got falsely accused of having ties to Black Flame, that would be the end of their careers in God’s Domain and their lives in the real world.

Because of this, neither adventurer teams nor powers that had entered the Miniature Ancient World dared to continue staying in this world.

…

While the people in the Thunder Fortress were in an uproar, the Blood Rabbit Hotel welcomed a group of guests.

Although this group consisted of only six players, the sight of these six caused everyone in the hotel’s lobby to gasp.

Not only were all six of these players at Level 140, but every one of them had upwards of three Fragmented Legendary items. With such equipment and level, these six players definitely ranked at the very top of the Miniature Ancient World in terms of strength.

Yet, these six players did not belong to a Guild. Instead, they only came from an adventurer team.

The Glimmer adventurer team!

Even Shi Feng was surprised when he saw Glimmer’s party of six.

Apart from Laura Crader and Casio, this was the first time Shi Feng was meeting with the four other players in Laura’s party, but every one of these four new faces possessed strength at the standard of titled experts. This was a line-up not even the various hegemonic powers could put together in the Miniature Ancient World. Yet, the Glimmer adventurer team managed to do so…

…

Blood Rabbit Hotel, VIP lounge:

“Guild Leader Black Flame, according to the information I received, I’m afraid Zero Wing cannot continue to stay in the Miniature Ancient World,” Laura Crader frankly said. Then in an earnest tone, she continued, “My suggestion is to temporarily disband Zero Wing and get ready to retreat from the Miniature Ancient World with a group of core members. Although the Divine Seal Saint will have a tight blockade on the other side, so long as I can get promoted to Tier 5, I am confident I can break through that blockade with a few dozen people. Once in the Greater God’s Domain, so long as you leave the Starlight Realm, even the Divine Seal Saint will have difficulty getting his hands on you.”

She’s confident in breaking through? Shi Feng was shocked when he heard Laura’s claims. He didn’t think that Laura would be hiding such strength.

Shi Feng knew that the Divine Seal Saint had stationed Wind Seal, one of the Four Seals, on the other end of the World Passage. According to rumors, not only did Wind Seal possess a Legendary Weapon, but he was even strong enough to rival Tier 6 Gods of the same level. On top of that, Wind Seal also had a 100-man team of Tier 6 players supporting him.

After learning about this line-up, even Shi Feng wasn’t confident in breaking through the Paimon Conglomerate’s blockade.

Yet, Laura was confident in doing so.

“Your suggestion is excellent, Commander Laura, but Zero Wing will not disband. Neither will Zero Wing leave the Miniature Ancient World,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “The Divine Seal Saint’s forces might be strong, but that doesn’t make Zero Wing a pushover. If he dares to bare his fangs in the Miniature Ancient World, he’ll have to be prepared to lose them!”
