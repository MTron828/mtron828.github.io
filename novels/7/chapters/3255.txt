God’s Domain Association, first-floor elevator lobby:

A man in his early thirties walked out of the elevator lobby and into the main lobby.

The man wore a simple tracksuit that gave him an unremarkable appearance. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Yet, despite the man’s inconspicuous appearance, whether it was young corporation successors or the God’s Domain Association staff members present, they all couldn’t help but look at the man with a hint of envy. Some powerful individuals had even taken the initiative to make way for this inconspicuous man.

“Who is that guy? Isn’t he only a two-star mental strength master? So, why are those one-star mental strength grandmasters making way for him? Could he be a conglomerate’s young master?”

“That can’t be, right? Why would a conglomerate’s successor come to a shabby place like Star Lake City?”

“Indeed. I heard that some of those young masters find the environment of even second-tier cities unbearable. There’s no way any of them would come to a third-tier city.”

The young men and women from the Blue Flash World couldn’t help but grow confused as they looked at the inconspicuous tracksuit-wearing man.

The Greater World was a place that took the expression “dog-eat-dog world” to a much greater extent.

Meanwhile, the disparity in status between mental strength masters and grandmasters was massive in the Greater World. If a mental strength master dared to provoke a mental strength grandmaster without a sufficiently good reason, the city’s authorities would banish the former without hesitation.

This difference in status was even more noticeable in the God’s Domain Association. For starters, some sections in the God’s Domain Association Building were only open to mental strength grandmasters. Then, mental strength grandmasters also had priority access to the Association’s lodgings, training rooms, and exchangeable resources. The priority access to lodgings was an especially noticeable difference.

Normally, people who had concluded their newcomer period in the God’s Domain Association would look to rent the rooms on the Association Building’s lower floors since they were the cheapest rooms available. However, because of the privilege afforded to mental strength grandmasters, all of the rooms on the lower floors were snatched up by various mental strength grandmasters. As a result, anyone looking to rent these cheap rooms would have to do so through the various mental strength grandmasters. Otherwise, they’d have to find a place to rent outside the God’s Domain Association.

However, even though the rent the various mental strength grandmasters charged was three times more expensive than what the Association charged, exceeding even the average cost of renting a house in the city, there was no shortage of mental strength masters trying to rent these rooms. This was because of the city contribution quests the God’s Domain Association published every day.

In the Greater World’s various cities, anyone who hadn’t reached the standard of mental strength grandmasters would have difficulty earning city contribution points. Meanwhile, should a person fail to collect a sufficient amount of contribution points at the end of each month, they’d be kicked out of the city they were in, regardless of whether this person was a mental strength master or a mental strength grandmaster.

To help those who weren’t mental strength grandmasters, the God’s Domain Association would publish quests to its non-mental strength grandmaster members, allowing them to quickly accumulate contribution points. However, as there were only a limited number of quests published each day, those living in the God’s Domain Association would have an advantage over those living outside the Association.

As such, apart from mental strength masters with powerful backgrounds, every other mental strength master living in the various cities would instinctively behave respectfully around mental strength grandmasters.

While Blue Flash’s youths were feeling confused, the old man, who wore the emblem of a one-star grandmaster and was responsible for leading the youths, turned to look at them. Then, in a low voice, he warned them, “You youngsters, listen carefully. In addition to the city’s corporations and powerful families, that man is one of the people you absolutely cannot provoke.”

“Cannot provoke? Does he have a powerful background?” a beautiful girl with a lively appearance curiously asked.

“Yes and no,” the old man answered. Then, he returned his gaze to the inconspicuous man and continued, “He is currently in first place of the city legion’s selection, but that achievement alone isn’t enough to get grandmasters to show him respect. Those grandmasters fear him because of the person backing him.”

“The person backing him? Is that person amazing?” the lively girl asked, looking even more confused.

“That person is currently the Ancient River Kingdom’s publicly acknowledged First Paragon, Black Flame, the Asura Sword Emperor!” When the old man spoke up to this point, a hint of yearning appeared in his eyes. “He is also a frightening expert who has defeated Markless Blade, one of the Star Lake Legion’s vice commanders!”

“The Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon?!” When the lively girl heard this, a hint of fascination appeared in the gaze she used to look at the inconspicuous man.

If a player could get recognized as a kingdom’s First Paragon, it meant that this player was the strongest out of all Tier 4 experts in the kingdom. Normally, such Tier 4 paragons were the target of recruitment for the Greater World’s various city legions. This was because experts of such caliber could play a vital role in Tier 4 City Competitions.

Some city legions would even go as far as to offer a vice commander position to recruit these paragons. Not only would these paragons be given an ace battle group to lead, but they would also get to command all Tier 4 battle groups in the legion. They would essentially become the First Vice Commander for Tier 4 battle groups.

If the inconspicuous man possessed the backing of such an expert, it made sense for members of Star Lake City’s upper echelon to show him some respect.

A moment later, the inconspicuous man could be seen stopping in front of Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow.

“Guild Leader?”

At this time, Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow couldn’t help but feel stunned as they looked at the inconspicuous man before them. Although they knew that Shi Feng could make incredible achievements in the Greater World with how strong he was, they didn’t think his achievements would be this amazing.

Not just mental strength grandmasters, but even the various corporations’ young masters and Blue Flash’s inhabitants feared him. This was simply unbelievable.

This scene dumbfounded even Thousand Scars and Death Omen.

Black Flame?

Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon?

Thousand Scars and Death Omen weren’t ignorant about the meaning behind the title of a kingdom’s First Paragon. On the contrary, they were well aware of what the title represented.

If Black Flame had truly become the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon, the Star Lake Legion would definitely try to recruit him. In that case, nobody in Star Lake City would dare to casually offend Shi Feng and Zero Wing’s other members.

“Sorry for the long wait,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow. “I’ll take you to look around once you two are done with your test. I believe you two should be able to quickly become official participants of the Star Lake Legion.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, the surrounding crowd was immediately shocked.

“Those two beauties are also Zero Wing’s members?”

“Crap! Is Zero Wing planning to develop in Star Lake City? This is big news!”

“Seeing how amicably Shi Feng is behaving around them, those two must occupy high positions in Zero Wing.”

“No, no, no. Don’t you see how respectful Shi Feng is behaving? My guess is that those two beauties share a close connection with Black Flame, possibly closer than even Shi Feng. Otherwise, why would Shi Feng, the Acting Guild Leader of Zero Wing, personally come to welcome them?”

The people in the lobby started making all sorts of wild guesses when they saw the friendly interaction between Shi Feng, Hidden Soul, and Gentle Snow. They all felt that Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow possessed extraordinary identities, and they started thinking about befriending the two women.

While everyone was discussing Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow, a lively girl and an indifferent young man from the group of youths from Blue Flash approached Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow, taking the initiative to offer the two women their places in line. Upon seeing this scene, many youths couldn’t help but reprimand themselves for reacting so slowly and throwing away such a good opportunity to befriend Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow.

In the meantime, Death Omen, waiting in line some distance behind the Blue Flash World’s group, wore an ashen look on her face as she watched Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow walk past her position…
