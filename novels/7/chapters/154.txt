Chapter 155 - Devour Once More

After spending a long amount of time, Blackie and Lonely Snow finally managed to catch a Golden Fish.

At this moment, they both realized that they had greatly underestimated the difficulty of the challenge. Not to mention a Fragmented Legendary ranked item, even a Dark-Gold ranked item was a fanciful delusion.

“This old man has already said that your strengths are just too weak. Stop thinking about the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath and be more realistic. Otherwise, you all might not get anything in the end,” Faust, who floated in the air, smiled.

In reality, Faust only teased Shi Feng’s group for fun by taking out the Fragmented Legendary rank item.

In God’s Domain, even a Fragmented Legendary rank item was an incomparably precious item. Its value was over ten times that of an Epic ranked item. If one were lucky, one might even restore the Legendary Fragment into a true Legendary ranked item. So, who would be willing to give it away?

This was why Faust had set such an unreasonable and unattainable amount for exchange.

“That damned old man! He is clearly just toying with us!” Blackie cursed in the party chat.

“Leader, what do we do now? Should we just give up on the Fragmented Legendary and Dark-Gold ranked items and just go for a Fine-Gold ranked item?” Lonely Snow had already given up on an unattainable item.

Shi Feng shook his head, saying, “You guys focus on catching the Golden Fish. I’ll try by myself.”

It was impossible for Shi Feng to give up on the Fragmented Legendary rank item. Who knew when he would have another chance to meet with a Fragmented Legendary ranked item? Moreover, the difficulty of obtaining one at that time would definitely be much higher than now. If he couldn’t even obtain a Fragmented Legendary ranked item, how could he secure a Legendary ranked item in the future?

Soon after, with his Attributes now greatly increased, Shi Feng rushed towards a Golden Fish that currently swam in the silver river.

Chop!

A black light slashed at the Golden Fish’s soft-sided abdomen. He struck the Golden Fish before it could even react, a damage of over -1,400 points appearing above its head. Immediately after, Shi Feng sent a normal slash at the Golden Fish, causing over -800 damage.

Following which, Shi Feng brandished the Silver Lake in his hand. Three electric arcs wove across eight Golden Fish. Instantly, damages of -1056, -1384, and -1758 appeared above their heads.

In the blink of an eye, the Golden Fish lost over 6,000 HP. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The frightening damage surprised Faust.

“Not bad,” Faust praised as he stroked his white beard. However, he still did not hold a thread of belief that Shi Feng could procure the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath. On the other hand, there was a large possibility for him to secure a Dark-Gold ranked item.

“Brother Feng!”

“Leader!”

Looking at the damage Shi Feng had caused, Blackie and Lonely Snow forgot to continue attacking the Golden Fish as their eyes filled with fanaticism and excitement. With such frightening damage, there might really be a hope of completing the quest.

“Don’t just stare at me; continue your attacks!” Shi Feng said in the party chat, his hands not halting their actions as he spoke.

Shi Feng’s intense attacks quickly caused the Golden Fish’s HP to fall at flying speeds.

In the end, Shi Feng had only spent about 100 seconds to capture a Golden Fish, using around two-fifths of Blackie and Lonely Snow’s time.

“As expected, it’s still not enough,” Shi Feng wrinkled his brows.

At this rate, even if Shi Feng continuously attacked and captured the Golden Fish without stop, he would, at most, capture 170 to 190 Golden Fish. There would still be an immense gap from the targeted 1,000 Golden Fish.

“Hahaha! Young man, you have truly given me a shock! However, I’ve already said this before, you all should not try to obtain the Fragmented Legendary ranked item. With all three of you combined, it would be good enough to trade for one or two Dark-Gold ranked items,” Faust laughed with confidence.

Naturally, Shi Feng did not give up at Faust’s words.

Suddenly, a clear-blue flame appeared floating above Shi Feng’s palm. This flame was the Ice-Blue Devil flame. The Ice-Blue Devil Flame wrapped around Shi Feng’s entire body, increasing Shi Feng’s damage by 20%.

“I’ve truly underestimated you. You can even control a Mysterious Flame,” when Faust saw the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, he was once more given a shock. “Looking at the Mysterious-Flame’s power, it should be a Tier 2 Mysterious Flame. Mastering a Tier 2 Mysterious Flame at such a young age, you are truly not a simple fellow. Unfortunately, it is still not enough.”

With the support of the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, Shi Feng’s damage soared once more. He then attacked zealously, filling the sky with sword images.

Now, his normal slashes alone could deal over a thousand damage, while his Chop dealt over -1,700 damage. The most frightening was the Thunder Flame Explosion, dealing over -3,000 damage.

In the end, Shi Feng only spent around one minute to successfully catch a Golden Fish. Moreover, Thundering Flash, Earth Splitter, and Thunder Flame Explosion also dealt some damage to the other Golden Fish. Only, the Cooldowns for these skills were too long. In addition to the Golden Fish constantly swimming about, never staying in a single place, the effects of these AOE skills were extremely limited.

Continuing at this pace, Shi Feng could catch somewhere over 300 Golden Fish in 5 hours. However, it was still a great distance from 1,000.

Am I really not able to attain the Fragmented Legendary ranked item? Shi Feng felt very reluctant. No matter what was said, a Fragmented Legendary ranked item was simply too rare. Finding one now was only due to heaven-defying luck.

“Hahaha! Don’t be discouraged, young man. You have already performed quite well. If you all can capture 400 Golden Fish, I can trade you an Epic ranked item. Consider it as a reward for your efforts,” Faust smiled, consoling. It had been very long since he had seen a youth with such a fighting spirit. However, with Shi Feng and the others’ current standards, there was not a great likelihood they could earn even an Epic ranked item.

“That damned old man! He only knows how to toy with us! Even if we have a full five hours right now, our chances of catching 400 Golden Fish are less than 40%,” Blackie cursed in the party chat. Having learned his lesson, he no longer cursed out directly.

My Attack Power is still too low; my Attack Speed is also too slow. I need an increase to my damage and speed. Shi Feng entered deep thought as he tried to think of a way to increase his abilities.

If he used the Intermediate Frost Grenades, with all three of them bombarding a wide area of the silver river, they might capture over 400 Golden Fish. The problem was, however, that he simply did not have that many Intermediate Frost Grenades. Moreover, each Intermediate Frost Grenade cost 10 Silver Coins.

A single Intermediate Frost Grenade could deal around -500 damage to the Golden Fish. Then, killing a Golden Fish would require 200 Intermediate Frost Grenades, which would cost up to 20 Gold Coins. Taking into account the effective area of the Frost Grenades, every 200 Frost Grenades would kill around 20 Golden Fish, making the value of each Golden Fish the equivalent of 1 Gold Coin. Meanwhile, 1,000 Golden Fish would equal to 1,000 Gold Coins.

Although purchasing a Fragmented Legendary ranked item for 1,000 Gold Coins was no different than daylight robbery, to begin with, Shi Feng did not possess nearly that much money. Hence, this method was not feasible.

What should I do?

How can I increase my Attack Power?

Shi Feng flipped through his bag. He managed to think of over a dozen methods, but not one of them were feasible.

At this moment, Shi Feng discovered the Level 10 Fine-Gold ranked greatsword that he collected from the Sun Temple. This greatsword was something he had prepared for the Abyssal Blade’s level up. He had completely forgotten about it due to being too busy. Now that he collected ten Silver Dawns, he could level up the Abyssal Blade.

That’s right! If I can raise the Abyssal Blade to Level 10, its Attributes will massively increase. Maybe it would be possible at that time! Inspiration struck Shi Feng.

There would be a checkpoint for weapons at every ten levels, and there would be a big improvement when these checkpoints were reached. Right now, the Level 5 Abyssal Blade could rival a Level 10 Secret-Silver Weapon. If it devoured a Fine-Gold Weapon and ten Secret-Silver Weapons, it would undergo an impressive growth.

“Let’s start devouring, then.”

Shi Feng immediately chose to level up the Abyssal Blade, starting the devouring process.
