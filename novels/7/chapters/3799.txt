Chapter 874 – Badlands Taboo

Nightmare Holy City, Library:

The libraries in God’s Domain weren’t just places for players to learn about God’s Domain’s history and various knowledge. They also served as a marketplace for players to sell information. So long as players had battle videos or information they believed was important in God’s Domain, they could pay a fee to sell it in a library for in-game currencies.

Although this could be regarded as an alternative to selling information on the official forums, the two were different. This was because the Magic Crystal Balls in libraries could perfectly reproduce a player’s experience as if they were reading the player’s memories. They could collect information that was far more detailed than what players could collect.

Because of this, even though players typically had to pay exorbitant amounts of in-game currency for information at libraries, many were still willing to do so.

A Taboo Boss! The Northern Badlands do have a Taboo Boss! Shi Feng grew excited when he saw the information recorded on the Magic Crystal Ball in his hand.

According to the library’s records, as many as 119 teams had challenged the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss, and over a hundred players had specifically gone to investigate it. As a result, much information was available.

If he were to compile all the information on the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos, the result wouldn’t compare to what was available on the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss. This was because almost every player who faced the Twenty-Two Taboos suffered a permanent death. This, in turn, also resulted in very few players daring to investigate the Twenty-Two Taboos. And even if some powers managed to obtain information on the Twenty-Two Taboos, they wouldn’t casually sell it at a library.

On the other hand, Nightmare Holy City’s players and powers differed slightly.

Although over 99% of the players who faced the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss similarly suffered permanent deaths, many players were still willing to study it and share the information they collected. This was because Nightmare Holy City’s players could not advance deeper into the Northern Badlands and travel to other regions if they could not eliminate the Taboo Boss. Unless they could pass the impossibly difficult cross-region challenge, they would only spend the rest of their lives stuck in the Nightmare Holy City Region—unlike the Greater God’s Domain’s players and powers, who could still explore the boundless Void Sea even without killing the Twenty-Two Taboos.

As for how monsters in God’s Domain could be judged to be Taboo Bosses, it was simple.

Take the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos, for example. Although the Twenty-Two Taboos were currently invincible in the Greater God’s Domain, they hadn’t been strong from the start. Instead, they grew into their current strength. This was also why many of the Twenty-Two Taboos were mutated monsters.

Of course, simply growing in levels and tiers wasn’t enough for a monster to be considered a Taboo Boss. Only after a monster could cast a True World and gained a unique ability, such as the Undying Mother and its unique ability Undying, would they be deemed as one.

Shi Feng browsed the battle records of the 119 teams that had fought the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss. Although these teams never managed to see its true appearance, their experiences proved that it could cast a True World.

When subjected to the World Laws of a True World, players would be subjected to an all-encompassing suppression of 50% or more, regardless of their levels, equipment standards, or Law Projection standards. Even bona fide Ancient Gods were no exception. Moreover, this was only the effect of a True World’s Basic Laws. A True World could have other effects depending on the Taboo Boss’s level and the unique World Laws they mastered.

The Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss had clearly displayed a True World, as every player who challenged it experienced an all-encompassing suppression of 50% or more. Even Level 239, Tier 6 experts were no exception.

It’s a pity that none of these records show the Taboo Boss’s unique ability. Otherwise, I could make better preparations. Shi Feng sighed when he finished reading all the available information.

None of the players who shared their findings in the library had seen the Taboo Boss’s unique ability. The only good news was that the Taboo Boss was under Level 240. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Had it been a Level 240 Taboo Boss, a normal attack would be enough to one-shot a Level 239 tank equipped with five Divine Artifacts. However, based on the library’s records, a Level 239 tank fully equipped with Level 235 Fragmented Legendary equipment—after activating his lifesaving measures—only lost 80% of his HP when struck by a giant arm from the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss.

Based on this information alone, Shi Feng knew that the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss had not reached Level 240. It was likely only at Level 238 or Level 239.

It seems I’ll have to increase the party’s level quickly. Shi Feng got a headache when he saw the levels of Red Frost and the others through the party window.

Although leveling up in the Nightmare Holy City Region should be quite easy, it’d be wishful thinking if he thought he could kill a Taboo Boss with a six-man party. He’d need at least a 100-man team. Moreover, he had to kill the Northern Badlands’ Taboo Boss in 20 days. This was because he still had Kalisha’s quest to collect 30 million Undying Souls in 30 days and Enos’s quest to kill the Undying Mother.

After researching the Taboo Boss, Shi Feng went to a VIP reading room to study the ancient tome he received from Dawn Forest.

When Shi Feng initially obtained the ancient tome, he didn’t dare to study it in detail. This was because he quickly recognized the flowing divine runes on the ancient tome formed divine patterns.

Others might not recognize what these divine patterns represented, but as a Divine Engraver, Shi Feng was certain it was a Sealing Engraving.

The Sealing Engraving was a commonly used sealing method before the Mythical Era. It was impossible to undo without sufficient knowledge of divine engravings. Among the reasons the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers were heavily invested in divine engraving research were the items sealed by Sealing Engravings that they obtained from ruins.

The Sealing Engraving placed on the ancient tome wasn’t particularly powerful. Any Basic Divine Engraver could undo it. They merely needed to make a copy of the Sealing Engraving to undo it.

Immediately, Shi Feng analyzed the Sealing Engraving and copied it using the pure mana of Seven Luminaries Crystals.

One minute… Ten minutes… Thirty minutes…

After going at it for two hours, Shi Feng finally completed a copy of the ancient tome’s Sealing Engraving. The instant he undid the Sealing Engraving, all the information in the ancient tome became available to him. A dragon’s roar also shook the room.
