Chapter 208 – Returning to God’s Domain

Inside the top-floor combat simulation room of Glimmer’s mansion…

“Commander, do you really believe that he can take us out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm?” a three-meter-tall middle-aged man asked worriedly as he watched Laura Crader fighting against three simulated Tier 4 NPCs. “We’ve spent many years saving up all those Dark Crystals. They should have also been our capital to achieve rapid growth in the Greater God’s Domain in the future. Yet, you’re giving everything to that kid. It will be a huge loss for us if he fails to fulfill his promise.”

“I don’t know if he can do it, but he is the most promising partner right now,” Laura said after repulsing the three Level 120, Tier 4 NPCs she was fighting against. Then, with a hopeful look on her face, she continued, “Ten years. It’s been ten years already, yet those three people mingling in Shadow City have yet to find a way to get us out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm. The best they can do is move Temple Knight-level experts out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm. None of their methods of leaving can be used on us.

“According to them, people with strength like us will most likely have to wait until the Stratified Abyssal Realm is fully integrated into the Greater God’s Domain before we can leave. But that’s a process that might take ten or even twenty years. We cannot afford to wait that long.

“But Black Flame is different. He seems to have a special means of leaving the Stratified Abyssal Realm. If he can get us out, it doesn’t matter how many Dark Crystals we have to give away. So long as we can enter the Greater God’s Domain, I will let those people know that I, Laura Crader, am back!”

After Laura finished speaking, the light-blue longsword in her hand suddenly gave off a brilliant glow. Immediately afterward, all three shield-bearing Tier 4 Sky Knights disintegrated into dust and disappeared from the combat simulation room. At the same time, numerous cracks appeared on the room’s defensive magic array, which was capable of shrugging off even Tier 4 Curses.

…

Slumber City, Matrix Tower:

“Lord Legatee, you’re back so soon? Did you forget something?” Senior Administrator Terrad asked as he looked at Shi Feng strangely. It hadn’t been more than two hours since Shi Feng left, yet he was already back at the Matrix Tower again.

“Yes, I did forget something. I was in such a hurry just now that I left without exchanging anything,” Shi Feng said, his voice sounding much more confident this time around.

“May I know what you plan to exchange, Lord Legatee?” Terrad asked, promptly taking out the exchange list for Shi Feng to inspect.

“I don’t need the list. I plan to exchange for three Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicles and one hundred Hypersensitivity Potions,” Shi Feng said.

“Very well. Your total comes to 10,000 Dark Crystals. Once you complete the payment, we will prepare the items for you immediately,” Terrad said, nodding. Then, he added, “But I need to remind you that the Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle can only be stored in special bags. Moreover, each bag can only have one tactical vehicle. Since you are purchasing three tactical vehicles, they will occupy three of your bag equipment slots. If you do not have enough empty bag equipment slots, please have them prepared first.”

“I understand,” Shi Feng said, nodding as he handed 10,000 Dark Crystals to Terrad.

Every player would only have five bag equipment slots. This meant that they could carry a total of five spatial bags.

Meanwhile, Magic Tactical Vehicles were considered non-bag space items in God’s Domain. They could only be stored in special bags or Epic Spatial Bags. However, Epic Spatial Bags were incredibly rare, so most people tended to resort to the alternative when transporting non-bag space items.

Fortunately, Shi Feng didn’t bring many things with him to the Stratified Abyssal Realm apart from Magic Crystals. So, even though he didn’t have an Epic Spatial Bag, he could easily open up three bag equipment slots.

Around ten minutes after Shi Feng made the payment, Senior Administrator Terrad returned to the reception room with four spatial bags.

“Lord Legatee, here are your three Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicles and one hundred Hypersensitivity Potions,” Terrad said. Then, in a serious tone, he continued, “This is our first attempt at manufacturing Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicles, so they aren’t the best when it comes to defense. Please use them with caution.”

“I will, Shi Feng said, not particularly surprised by Terrad’s warning. Instead, he promptly clicked on one of the bags holding the tactical vehicles to inspect the vehicle’s statistics.

Magic Tactical Vehicles weren’t siege weapons but rather support items for players. A player would be crazy to use a tactical vehicle to engage in direct combat.

…

What a powerful tactical vehicle!?Shi Feng was greatly astonished by the Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicle’s parameters.

According to his research, the average Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle should only have an Intermediate Anti-Mana Barrier. Meanwhile, such an Anti-Mana Barrier would only have full effect on Tier 3 players and monsters. Against Tier 4 players and monsters, the barrier’s effects would be reduced.

On the other hand, an AdvancedAnti-Mana Barrier could thoroughly inhibit Tier 4 players from accessing the Mana around them. The barrier could even cause Tier 4 players to have trouble manipulating the Mana inside their bodies, which would, in turn, reduce the power of their Skills and Spells by 50% or more.

Logically, an Advanced Anti-Mana Barrier was something only an Advanced Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle should have. Yet, it had come with the Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicle.

Of course, in exchange for this powerful barrier, the Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicle’s defenses were far below average. The average Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle would have armor at the Tier 3 Advanced standard and durability of 500 points or more. Even a Tier 4 Mythic monster would need quite some time to destroy a standard Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle. However, in the case of the Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicle, it could, at most, withstand a few dozen hits from a Mythic monster.

Although its defense is weak, it is just fine for the current Zero Wing,?Shi Feng thought as he put away the Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicles and left the Matrix Tower.

...

Subsequently, time passed by rapidly. In the blink of an eye, ten days had already gone by since Shi Feng’s team arrived in the Stratified Abyssal Realm. During these ten days, everyone had increased their levels to Level 112 or above. Shi Feng had even reached Level 114 and was very close to reaching Level 115.

Aside from leveling up, Shi Feng had also offered to sell some Hypersensitivity Potions to Hundred Flower Palace at the price of 6,000 Magic Crystals per bottle, equivalent to 30 Dark Crystals per bottle. Meanwhile, Hundred Flower Palace had not only agreed to the deal, but it had even bought a whopping 1,000 bottles, allowing Shi Feng to make a profit of 2,000 Hypersensitivity Potions in the blink of an eye.

In addition to Hundred Flower Palace, Blood Hammer had also agreed to the offer Shi Feng proposed, using 1,000 Lineage Crystals to exchange for 1,000 Hypersensitivity Potions. However, the transaction would have to wait until the next time they opened the Gate of Crossing. After all, the Tower Alliance needed time to collect so many Lineage Crystals. For the time being, Blood Hammer had only spent 40,000 Dark Crystals to exchange for 1,000 Hypersensitivity Potions.

The deal with Blood Hammer had allowed Shi Feng to not only recoup the cost of the 1,000 Hypersensitivity Potions, but also had enough leftover to purchase seven more Dragonhorn Magic Tactical Vehicles, buying out his monthly limit of ten. Moreover, even after making all of these trades and fulfilling his own needs, he still had 2,000 Hypersensitivity Potions he could exchange this month.

As for the neighboring cities’ peak powers, they had become a joke five days ago.

As soon as Shi Feng took out a Dragonhorn Tactical Vehicle and elevated the Mana of Gentle Snow, Hidden Soul, and the others to the Tier 4 standard, the various peak powers understood that nobody could shake Zero Wing’s position in Slumber City. As a result, nobody dared to have any ideas against Zero Wing.

“The key is fully recharged, Guild Leader Black Flame. If there are no problems on your side, I will be using the key now,” Crimson Heart said to Shi Feng as she looked at the glowing ancient key in her hand.

“Okay, let’s go back,” Shi Feng said, nodding. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Subsequently, Crimson Heart and Blood Hammer activated the magic array on their respective keys. Immediately afterward, Shi Feng’s team vanished from Slumber City, transforming into a streak of light that flowed into a space-time fissure and returned to the Miniature Ancient World.
