Chapter 603 – Lunacy!

“Is he insane?! Why did he send only five people?!”

Over at Star Lake City’s spectator stands, Xia Qingying stood up and exclaimed in a somewhat ear-piercing voice when she saw only five figures appearing before the fifteen cities’ army, confusion and disbelief filling her eyes.

As Zero Wing’s partner, Xia Qingying was more or less aware of Zero Wing’s situation.

While Zero Wing might have very few capable experts based in Star Lake City, it definitely wasn’t so short on manpower that it could only have five people participate in the Tier 5 match. Not to mention, Shi Feng had even shown Zero Wing’s battle group to Mu Huangwu previously. That was undoubtedly a full battle group.

Moreover, Shi Feng always had the option of seeking reinforcements from Zero Wing’s other members in God’s Domain. While external reinforcements might experience a delay in controlling their bodies, fifth-floor experts could still display combat standards vastly superior to titled experts nonetheless. Combined with weapons and equipment enhanced by Intermediate Divine Engravings, these fifth-floor experts could put up a fight against even Skystar City’s ace battle group.

Yet, Shi Feng had chosen to participate in the Tier 5 match with just five people. Now, not only would it be impossible to defeat Skystar City’s ace battle group, but even winning against the fifteen city legions would be an insurmountable challenge.

At this time, Mu Huangwu also nodded in agreement with Xia Qingying. He felt that Shi Feng had already given up on the Tier 5 match. Otherwise, there would be no reason why he would have only five people participate. No matter how futile the Tier 5 match might seem, he should have mobilized at least twenty people. After all, every additional participant counted in a city battle.

…

“Are you all Zero Wing’s members?” Luo Tianhao asked out of curiosity as he looked at the five people approaching him.

Luo Tianhao had only heard a little about the Guild named Zero Wing, and most of it had come from Frey. However, based on Frey’s description, Zero Wing was supposedly an amazing Guild, so much so that she strongly recommended the Galaxy Conglomerate to establish deeper ties with it.

“That’s right,” Shi Feng responded, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes as he looked at Luo Tianhao and his battle group.

In his previous life, Luo Tianhao’s battle group was considerably famous on the Starlight Continent. The battle group had helped Skystar City achieve consecutive victories and zero defeats in the Tier 5 matches against other first-tier cities. Somewhere down the line, the battle group even won a match for a transcontinental special-tier city, instantly solidifying the Galaxy Conglomerate’s position in the city.

However, despite Luo Tianhao’s achievements and status as the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Sixth Successor, Shi Feng never really paid much attention to him. This was because most major struggles in the Greater God’s Domain only involved Tier 6 players, while Luo Tianhao and his battle group only focused on Tier 5 matches.

“Good!” Luo Tianhao nodded as he looked at Shi Feng. “Since you have the courage to stand before us, we won’t bully you with numbers. Instead, we’ll have a five-on-five match. If you win, my battle group will stay out of Star Lake City. If we win, you must personally tell Frey that Zero Wing isn’t worthy of collaborating with Galaxy. How about it?”

Upon hearing Luo Tianhao’s words, the fifteen city legions’ members promptly grew anxious.

In this Tier 5 match, Luo Tianhao’s battle group was the main force for their side, while everyone else was only here as support. While they might be able to kill Shi Feng’s group if they finished constructing their magic barrier, they would be in a bind if Shi Feng’s group fled to another city.

Even if the fifteen cities were to ultimately win the Tier 5 match, so long as Shi Feng’s group successfully occupied one or two capture points in another city, there was a chance the unlucky city might lose to Star Lake City in points. Not to mention, according to their intelligence, all five members of Shi Feng’s group should be fifth-floor experts.

“That’s a rather generous offer, Team Leader Luo.” Shi Feng couldn’t help but chuckle when he saw Luo Tianhao’s confidence. “Unfortunately, I am not interested in it. Also, I’m afraid nobody present is qualified to discuss conditions with Zero Wing.”

As soon as Shi Feng’s words fell, an uproar immediately occurred among the fifteen cities. It was especially so for Star Lake City’s spectators.

“Crap! Is that guy nuts?”

“How dare he provoke Skystar City’s ace battle group at this critical moment? Is he not worried City Lord Feng will kick him out of Star Lake City?”

Star Lake City’s spectators couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng as if he was a fool. After all, Luo Tianhao’s offer allowed Zero Wing to have a fair fight.

Yet, not only did Shi Feng turn down such an opportunity, but he had even provoked Luo Tianhao while he was at it…

“We’re not qualified to discuss conditions with you?” Luo Tianhao laughed. At the same time, his expression gradually darkened. “I would have assumed the Guild that Frey has talked so much about would have some brains, but it seems Zero Wing is merely run by a bunch of irredeemable fools. Since you think we’re unqualified, let me see how long you can last against my battle group!”

Immediately, Luo Tianhao and his battle group members materialized their Legendary Weapons and Equipment, the appearance of the items bringing along with them an aura surpassing that of the average Tier 6 player. And when everyone saw their weapons and equipment, they couldn’t help but be awed.

It was very rare to see players fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment in the Greater God’s Domain. Not even the executives of upper-ranking hegemonic powers would necessarily have a full set of Legendary items.

Yet, every member of Luo Tianhao’s member group was fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment. With such an equipment standard, it wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that Luo Tianhao’s battle group could confront a Tier 6 God.

Meanwhile, when Fire Dance felt the astonishing aura coming off of Luo Tianhao’s battle group, she looked at Shi Feng with fiery eyes and asked, “Can I have this battle, Guild Leader?”

“Ah! Not fair, Big Sis Fire!” Jun Luosha pouted. “We already agreed to share before!”

“Guild Leader! As a Vice Guild Leader, I think I should be the one to handle this fight,” Gentle Snow interjected. “Fire Dance and the others can go after me if I fail.

All of a sudden, four of Zero Wing’s five-man party could be seen contesting for the opportunity to take on Luo Tianhao’s battle group by themselves. When everyone else saw this scene, they couldn’t help but be dumbfounded, and it was especially so for Luo Tianhao and his battle group members.

Previously, it was already plenty ludicrous that Zero Wing had only dispatched five people to participate in the Tier 5 match. Yet, it seems the women around Shi Feng had also lost their minds as they now argued for a chance to fight alone.

At this time, even those familiar with Fire Dance, such as Xia Qingying and Mu Huangwu, couldn’t help but question whether they were hallucinating or Fire Dance and the others had truly gone insane.

“Stop arguing,” Shi Feng said with a wry smile. “If you all insist on soloing, we’ll go by order of whoever mastered the Advanced Bronze Purification Technique first. That way, it’ll be fair to everyone.”
