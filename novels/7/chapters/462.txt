Chapter 463 - Imperial Heirloom

“I’ll make the adjustments now, then.” Aqua Rose could only nod her head in reply upon hearing Shi Feng’s confident answer.

“Right, have you compensated Virtuous Cloud and the others?” Shi Feng suddenly asked.

After all was said and done, Overwhelming Smile had ambushed them because of him. He also still owed Virtuous Cloud six pieces of Secret-Silver Equipment. However, due to his short hibernation this time, he had not been able to bring them to make their selection.

“I’ve already brought them to the Guild’s Warehouse to exchange for ten pieces of Level 20 Secret-Silver Equipment. However, there is one matter that you definitely won’t be able to guess,” Aqua Rose said, revealing a mysterious smile.

“What happened?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

“After Virtuous Cloud and her party saw our Guild Warehouse, they were downright stupefied. Originally, they were planning to return to the Black Dragon Empire to continue their development there. Now, however, the party has joined Zero Wing and should be carrying out some high-level Guild Quests at the moment,” Aqua Rose replied.

Aqua Rose was very optimistic about Virtuous Cloud’s crew. An independent party attaining such high levels and good equipment was quite an amazing feat. Now that they had entered Zero Wing, it wouldn’t be long before they became experts.

In God’s Domain, though elite players were easy to find, experts were not.

Now that Zero Wing was in an all-out war with Overwhelming Smile, it would be a long time before things settled down. After all, it was not possible for either side to defeat the other in one fell swoop. Moreover, battles between two warring Guilds consisted mostly of small-scale skirmishes; large-scale engagements occurred very infrequently. As a result, the importance of players with top-tier combat power grew even greater. If a large group of players took action together, they could easily be discovered, as well as easily countered. However, if a party or an individual took action, they would be highly mobile; hence, they would not be discovered so easily. If Zero Wing could form a party of experts and give a huge blow to Overwhelming Smile from time to time, they could easily force Overwhelming Smile into a passive state.

“Guild Leader, why don’t we start raiding 50-man Team Dungeons now? Although the benefits we offer could attract quite a number of players to the Guild, it is still not enough of an attraction for many independent experts. The things these experts seek are top-tier equipment and room for growth. Meanwhile, we can use the top-tier equipment we obtain from large-scale Dungeons to attract these experts,” Aqua Rose suggested.

After seeing the reactions of Virtuous Cloud’s crew yesterday, Aqua Rose came up with this idea.

Previously, she had also tried inviting Virtuous Cloud and her party to join Zero Wing, but they had been reticent. However, after seeing the large number of Level 25 Fine-Gold and Secret-Silver Equipment, as well as plenty of Level 20 Dark-Gold Equipment, they made up their minds right away.

At that time, Aqua Rose had even considered displaying the two Epic items inside their Guild’s Warehouse. However, the Epic items were Zero Wing’s trump cards. It would be best if other Guilds did not know about the existence of these items, so she had promptly dismissed this idea of hers.

If she were to really put the Epic items on display, then many Guilds would definitely scheme against Zero Wing. Her action would no doubt create many more enemies for Zero Wing. The Guilds that were maintaining neutrality might even side with Overwhelming Smile. At that time, Zero Wing’s position would become very tenuous. Hence, only core members, who had signed a confidentiality agreement, could know about the existence of the Epic items.

“We still have to wait for some time regarding the matter of the large-scale Team Dungeons. However, we can begin raiding 20-man Hell Mode Team Dungeons.” Shi Feng had been the Guild Leader of Shadow for many years, so he naturally knew what attracted experts. Although he fully agreed with Aqua Rose’s suggestion, large-scale Team Dungeons were no walk in the park. They needed to accumulate even more strength if they wished to raid one. On the other hand, they could give 20-man Hell Mode Team Dungeons a try.

Players had a fixed probability for obtaining Dark-Gold items from 20-man Hell Mode Team Dungeons, though the majority of the items were Fine-Gold rank. In addition, there were plenty of production materials that were available only in Hell Mode Dungeons. The Guild could also obtain Guild Popularity by clearing Hell Mode Dungeons. As the Guild’s Popularity increased, the Guild Quests commissioned by NPCs would also improve in quality, and this was what Zero Wing needed the most at the moment.

“I’ll get everyone prepared right now, then!” Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Aqua Rose immediately went into action with great excitement.

As for Shi Feng himself, he made a trip to the Bank.

Although there were many things demanding his attention right now—the all-out war with Overwhelming Smile, in particular—at the end of the day, there was only one task that he needed to complete, which was to earn money.

Shi Feng had experienced countless all-out wars between Guilds in the past, so he had long since known what took priority.

Although he himself possessed frightening combat power, allowing him to easily hunt and kill Overwhelming Smile members out in the fields, just how many members were there in Overwhelming Smile?

Even if he ran around all day, hunting players, how many could he possibly kill by himself?

Doing so would allow him to collect the Immortal Souls of players he killed, but it was still not worth the effort. Moreover, even if he did nothing but hunt players from Overwhelming Smile all day long, completing his quest would take many days. During this time, Overwhelming Smile with its huge funding could easily recruit a large number of additional players. Even if Shi Feng worked himself to death, he still wouldn’t be able to win the war by himself. After all, this was currently the early stages of God’s Domain. The various Guilds had yet to possess their very own towns and cities. Killing Overwhelming Smile’s members would only cause the Guild a little trouble and slightly affect its development speed.

Most importantly, Shi Feng simply did not have the time to do something like this. He only had a little time left to complete the Epic Quest Darkness Descends, and he was still far from his goal of earning 30,000 Gold. If he failed to complete the quest, at that time, he would have to face the wrath of a Tier 4 Demon. With his current strength, he would certainly die. Hence, earning money was his top priority right now.

The war between the two Guilds would definitely grow more intense as time passed, and the same was true for the expenditure of both Guilds. It was especially true for the expenditure on equipment. Aside from losing equipment as a result of dying, fights between players would also cause the Durability of weapons and equipment to fall at a faster rate than when fighting monsters. Naturally, repairing these weapons and equipment would also require a large sum of Coins.

Presently, Guilds had a limited source of income for Coins. Guilds would only begin raking in large sums of Coins once they possessed their own towns and cities during the middle stage of the game. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although Overwhelming Smile had large funding, having a large funding did not necessarily equate to having a large number of Coins.

This was where Shi Feng’s confidence came from.

Half an hour later, Shi Feng arrived at the Bank. He then retrieved all the Starfire Ore as well as the Philosopher’s Stone from his Warehouse. He also retrieved the Dragonscale Set Equipment Forging Design he had stored away all this time.

At present, aside from the Warfire Set Equipment, the Level 20 Fine-Gold ranked Dragonscale Set Equipment was definitely the best Set Equipment available. It was naturally an item that all Guilds would fight desperately to obtain.

After Shi Feng organized the items inside his bag, he suddenly noticed the golden stone tablet inside it.

“How could I have forgotten about this thing?” Shi Feng’s mind had been occupied with too many things during this period of time, and he had completely forgotten about the golden stone tablet he had snatched away from the Anubis’s Gatekeeper.

An item guarded by a Great Lord was definitely not an ordinary item.

However, Shi Feng had also never heard about a golden stone tablet, so he did not know exactly what function this item possessed.

Glancing at it, he was unable to read its information; all that was displayed about the golden stone tablet was that it was an Unknown item.

Shi Feng then used Omniscient Eyes and started appraising it.

The seconds ticked by slowly as countless data flickered in front of his eye.

After a total of 22 seconds passed, the appraisal process was finally completed.

“An Imperial Heirloom?” Shi Feng muttered in disbelief when he read the information displayed about the golden stone tablet.
