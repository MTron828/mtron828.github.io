Chapter 515 – Different Era

Miniature Ancient World, Boundary Sea:

On a large island shaped like a hammer, over a thousand players were currently engaged in intense combat with each other. These players were mostly at Level 155 or above, with most being at Tier 4 while some were at Tier 5. These players were split into two groups, and it looked like two armies were clashing when they fought.

Both groups mainly fought using two tactics. They would either have numerous Tier 4 players supporting a couple of Tier 5 players using magic barriers or have a bunch of Tier 4 players fight with the assistance of battle arrays. Both tactics worked well at keeping the opponent’s Tier 5 combatants at bay, and the battle fell into a stalemate as neither group could get the upper hand over the other.

The battle between the two player groups had turned a radius of several thousand yards into scorched land. Even the island’s Level 150-plus monsters steered clear of these players, none daring to get close.

!!

While the two groups were gradually escalating the intensity of their fight, a four-meter-tall spatial rift opened up in the nearby forest. Then, Shi Feng and his teammates came flying out of the rift.

“What an incredible miniature world!” Desolate Fury exclaimed shortly after exiting the rift. “The density of the mana here is comparable to the former Holy World!”

“Indeed.” Shi Feng also couldn’t help but be surprised when he sensed the Miniature Ancient World’s mana. “If we’re comparing solely density, the mana here is already on par with the Holy World’s.”

The Holy World’s mana was extraordinary. It was so dense that it could suppress players’ mana. Meanwhile, such a mana environment was something most players and powers could only dream of finding.

Hence, the fact that the current Miniature Ancient World had mana rivaling that of the Holy World was astonishing.

It should be known that the Miniature Ancient World’s mana environment couldn’t even compare to that of the Starlight Realm’s Ancient River Kingdom previously. Yet, now, the situation was reversed, and the gap was vastly greater than before.

Even more surprising was the Miniature Ancient World’s law suppression that resulted from this dense mana. Not only did it cause his teleportation to go wrong, but it also restricted him from releasing his mana out of his body. It should be known that he had a Tier 5 Advanced Legendary Mana Body. Yet, after arriving in the Miniature Ancient World, he could no longer manipulate the mana around him to fly. Now, he could only walk using his feet.

“There’s a battle over there,” Leroja calmly stated after glancing at the players fighting roughly two thousand yards away from them. “By the looks of things, it should be a clash between two different powers, but it looks like one side is about to crumble soon.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Shortly after Leroja spoke, the battle developed as she predicted, with one side gradually retreating. Though, this outcome came as no surprise to anyone on Shi Feng’s team.

After all, there was a very apparent gap in strength between the two clashing groups.

At first glance, both groups were roughly even in numbers, with both groups most likely being 1,000-man legions originally. However, there was a significant difference in the number of Tier 5 experts the two groups possessed.

One side had over twenty Tier 5 experts, while the other had less than ten. Without a fortified stronghold to back them, it would only be a matter of time before the group with fewer Tier 5 players lost.

“Attack!” a level 160, Tier 5 Grand Wizard on the winning side commanded when he saw the enemy retreating. “Use Spatial Lockdown! We must not let these native Tier 5s escape!”

Following the Grand Wizard’s command, several dozen Tier 4 players quickly took out a magic scroll from their bag and created a Spatial Lockdown Barrier that enveloped a 5,000-yard radius. Now, unless the enemy team could exhaust the barrier’s mana reserves, they shouldn’t think of stepping out of the barrier.

Players from outside the Miniature Ancient World? When Shi Feng heard the Grand Wizard’s command, he started to observe him with more scrutiny.

On closer observation, Shi Feng noted that the Grand Wizard was undoubtedly a titled expert. If put in an ordinary hegemonic power, he would hold a position among the hegemonic power’s core executives.

In addition, apart from the commanding Grand Wizard, the twenty or so other Tier 5 experts on his team were also quite strong. Every one of them was at the fourth-floor standard.

A team with such a line-up would be more than enough to topple most of the hegemonic powers that had entered the Miniature Ancient World, let alone the Miniature Ancient World’s native powers.

However, when Shi Feng turned to observe the other team, composed of native experts, he discovered something even more surprising.

Even though the team of native experts had less than ten Tier 5 experts, every one of them had respectable combat standards. Every one of them was either a Domain Realm expert or a fourth-floor expert.

Normally, a God’s Domain that had only recently opened its doors to the Greater God’s Domain would be fortunate even to have a dozen or so experts reaching the fourth-floor standard. Moreover, all of these experts would be among the strongest existences of that God’s Domain.

However, Shi Feng didn’t recognize any of the supposedly native Tier 5 experts on the battlefield.

Amidst Shi Feng’s amazement, a team of twelve Tier 5 players suddenly joined the battle against the team composed of foreign players.

The team of twelve was led by two women; a Tier 5 Elementalist and a Tier 5 Assassin. Moreover, both were young women.

Following the appearance of these two young women, the atmosphere surrounding the battlefield instantly changed.

“Hooray! Our reinforcements have arrived!”

“Wow! It’s the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s Clear Sky and Nightingale!”

“We’re saved!”

The native players grew ecstatic when they saw the team of twelve joining the battlefield. A look of reverence even appeared on their faces when they saw Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin leading the team.

As for the foreign players, they exploded into an uproar when they saw the 12-man team.

“Dammit! Why is it those two?!” The Grand Wizard commanding the foreign team cursed when he saw Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin. Then, with great reluctance, he commanded, “Everyone…retreat!”

Hearing the Grand Wizard’s call for retreat, the foreign players dropped what they were doing and fled in all directions without hesitation.

“Trying to escape?” A cold glint flashed in Zhuo Yalin’s eyes when she saw the foreign experts fleeing. “Don’t even think about it!”

Immediately, Zhuo Yalin’s speed skyrocketed, her body splitting into fifteen copies that chased after the fleeing Tier 5 experts. Her speed was like lightning, and every Tier 4 player she passed by would disintegrate into particles of light.

Equally formidable, Lin Yaoyue raised her staff and cast three Tier 5 Spells simultaneously, sending forth an amalgamation of wind, lightning, and icicles that killed over a hundred Tier 4 players in the blink of an eye.

By the end of the battle, less than 20% of the foreign players managed to escape with their lives, and more than half of the foreign team’s Tier 5 players died in battle. If not for the commanding Grand Wizard ordering a retreat as soon as he saw Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin, the team’s losses would have been even more severe.

“What’s going on?” Gentle Snow couldn’t help but be stunned as she looked at Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin in the distance. What exactly happened when she was away from the Miniature Ancient World?

When did Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin become so strong?

Lin Yaoyue = Clear Sky (formerly[or still is?] the God’s Domain Academy’s director)

Zhuo Yalin = Nightingale (witness to Shi Feng clearing the Colosseum’s fifth-floor test)

*Colosseum is where players could fight for a chance to reconstruct their Mana Bodies.
