Chapter 2783 – Era of Hegemony

Upper Zone, entrance:

While Liang Jing and Lei Bao were shocked by the sight before them, Shi Feng, who had been waiting quietly by the entrance for some time, approached them.

“How is it? It’s different from what you imagined, right?” Shi Feng asked, smiling faintly as he looked at the two. Their expressions and thoughts were exactly the same as his when he first arrived before the Upper Zone.

“Guild Leader, how is the Upper Zone?” Liang Jing asked as she looked at Shi Feng. “Is it as amazing as the rumors make it out to be?” There were many rumors circulating in the outside world about the Upper Zones. Nobody was allowed to go near the Upper Zones without permission despite them being in the middle of bustling cities. Hence, while everyone knew of the Upper Zones’ existence, no outsider truly understood them.

In fact, there was not the smallest piece of official news on the Upper Zone in the world. The information everyone knew came only from rumors.

Lei Bao couldn’t help pricking up his ears at Liang Jing’s question.

To him, the Upper Zone was a place he never even dared to dream of visiting. After all, even world champions in fighting couldn’t visit it.

“It’s amazing!” Shi Feng replied with a smile. “It’s even more amazing than the rumors make it out to be. The people inside can constantly grow stronger physically without doing any training.”

“So, is it true that even world-champion-level fighters are not a big deal in the Upper Zone?” Lei Bao asked when he heard Shi Feng’s words.

The fact that a place could automatically improve a person’s physical fitness was simply unbelievable. This revelation thoroughly shattered his view of physical training.

“That rumor is slightly exaggerated, but it’s not far off from the truth, either,” Shi Feng replied, not trying to conceal the truth. “Even without physical training, the Upper Zone’s residents can still achieve a physical fitness rivaling Henglian masters. With some systematic training, their physical fitness becomes even more astonishing.” “It’s actually such an amazing place?” Lei Bao was shocked.

He had undergone plenty of intense training to achieve his current physical fitness, yet the Upper Zone’s residents could easily accomplish a similar feat without any training. Who would possibly believe this?

However, Lei Bao knew that Shi Feng wouldn’t lie to him, so this inflicted an even greater shock.

All of a sudden, Lei Bao felt as if he had lived his life for nothing. He felt as if all his previous efforts were nothing but a joke.

“Master Lei Bao, no need to be discouraged.” Looking at Lei Bao, who suddenly grew disheartened, Shi Feng said, “Zero Wing will also develop in the Upper Zone in the future. At that time, it won’t be just Qingxue, Aqua, and myself who can enter this place. I will let many more people join us. Just like those international corporations, we will treat the Upper Zone as our headquarters!”

Although Shi Feng did not speak loudly, both Lei Bao and Liang Jing gasped involuntarily at his words. At the same time, a hint of anticipation and excitement flashed in their eyes.

If anyone else had made this statement, they would’ve most likely treated it as a joke.

However, Shi Feng was someone who constantly worked miracles, having single-handedly developed Zero Wing to its current scale. Moreover, he never did anything he was not confident of succeeding in.

His declaration meant that he had some way to achieve this goal. “Zero Wing will also develop in the Upper Zone in the future?” Liang Jing couldn’t help growing excited when she looked at the distant steel wall.

If Zero Wing really accomplished this feat, it would truly become a powerful existence. At that time, even ordinary superpowers would be a joke to the Guild.

Lei Bao clenched his fists in excitement and anticipation. He felt that his decision to join Zero Wing was the wisest choice he had made in his life.

“These three bottles here are Strengthening Potions. Liang Jing, take two back and give them to Fire and Violet,” Shi Feng said as he took out three Strengthening Potions and handed two to Liang Jing. He then turned to Lei Bao and said, “Master Lei Bao, you take one, as well. I believe that you should be able to go a step further with this Strengthening Potion.”

Fire Dance and Violet Cloud normally trained their physical bodies very seriously. The two of them also possessed incredible talent in this regard. Unfortunately, due to insufficient resources, their improvements had been gradual. With the Strengthening Potion’s assistance, their development would no longer be hindered.

As for Lei Bao, he also possessed excellent talent. Unfortunately, as he had always been a lone wolf, he never managed to get his hands on any resources and could only rely on hard work. However, he had reached the point where he couldn’t improve further through hard work alone.

Although Shi Feng had previously given Lei Bao several bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids, which allowed him to improve his physical fitness significantly, it was evident that S-rank Nutrient Fluids alone couldn’t fully bring out Lei Bao’s potential. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, with the Strengthening Potion, Lei Bao might be able to go a step further and become a Half-step Henglian grandmaster.

Meanwhile, if Lei Bao succeeded, then Zero Wing would gain an additional layer of protection.

“Thank you, Guild Leader. I won’t disappoint you.” Lei Bao’s eyes shone with gratitude as he looked at Shi Feng. He had heard of the Strengthening Potion before. This thing was basically treated as a divine item in the fighting industry. Just one bottle could allow a person’s physical fitness to undergo a qualitative transformation. Unfortunately, the medicine was incredibly rare, much rarer than even the Life Potion. According to rumors, even grandmaster martial artists had difficulty getting their hands on a bottle. In fact, some grandmasters would even put their lives on the line just to get their hands on it.

Yet Shi Feng not only took out three bottles but even gave him one. How could Lei Bao not grow excited in this situation?

With this Strengthening Potion, he was confident that even if he couldn’t become a Henglian grandmaster, he could, at least, reach a level where he could contend with neutralizing grandmasters. “By the way, Guild Leader, more and more NPCs are appearing in God’s Domain. As a result, some superpowers have designs on the Secret Covenant Tower. In fact, they’ve already clashed with us over a dozen times outside Sky Spring City. Currently, both sides have lost over a thousand Tier 3 players,” Liang Jing said suddenly. “Fortunately, Vice Guild Leader Illusory Words and Vice Guild Leader Unyielding Heart returned in time to preside over the situation. Otherwise, the consequences would’ve been unimaginable.

“However, the two of them believe that if this situation continues, their two Guilds are unlikely to hold back the various superpowers for very long. Moreover, some small Guilds have already begun disbanding due to the NPC population pressure. Many new NPC forces have also emerged in the various NPC cities, and these NPC forces are constantly harassing the local Guilds and pose a headache even for the various superpowers.

“Hence, the various superpowers are all trying to enter the Secret Covenant Tower, which doesn’t have NPC intervention. Moreover, I’m afraid that they will only grow more desperate as the NPC forces scale up their harassment.”

Shi Feng frowned upon hearing Liang Jing’s report on God’s Domain’s and the Secret Covenant Tower’s present situation.

He hadn’t anticipated that the NPC forces would actually begin taking action so soon.

Moreover, with the NPC forces now taking action, the main continent of God’s Domain would enter an era where hundreds of countries fought for hegemony. To survive the upcoming chaos, the various superpowers would probably do everything they could to secure the sacred leveling ground known as the Secret Covenant Tower.

“I understand.” After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng looked at Liang Jing and instructed, “For now, have everyone in the Guild avoid going out to do quests if possible Instead, have them focus on grinding in the Secret Covenant Tower and restrict their sphere of activity to Sky Spring City and our three Guild Cities. Also, have Crimson Emperor and Unyielding Soul hasten their exploration. It doesn’t matter even if it increases the chances of the secret getting out. Our side will do the same as well.”

Originally, he thought that it would take the NPC forces another two weeks to take action. However, contrary to his expectations, the NPC forces had evidently completed their investigations already and made a move.

Once begun, the NPC forces’ harassment would only escalate as time passed. It wouldn’t be long before members of player forces would get attacked if they left the confines of towns and cities. Given enough time, NPC forces would even start launching attacks on Guild Towns and Cities, forcing the various Guilds to abandon their Guild Towns and Cities. This, in turn, would cripple the Guilds’ income and force them to disband.

“Okay. I’ll contact them once I return.” Liang Jing nodded. Shi Feng gave Liang Jing a few more instructions, such as secretly collecting the basic materials needed to construct the Small Mobile Fortress, then brought Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose into the Upper Zone. As for Liang Jing and Lei Bao, after looking at the three of them enviously for a moment, they promptly left in the levitating car.

In the Upper Zone, Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose’s condition immediately saw slight improvements. Now, they no longer looked as cold and indifferent as before. The degree of mental deterioration they suffered also declined significantly.

After they consumed the luxury set meals, which Shi Feng bought for 300 trade points each, their mental states even showed signs of stabilizing. They also no longer appeared indifferent to everything around them. At the very least, they display some interest in the Upper Zone’s matters. Occasionally, they even took the initiative to say a few words.

Seeing the two’s condition stabilizing, Shi Feng breathed out a sigh of relief.

The environment here should sustain the two of them for a long time. The next step is to figure out a way to consolidate my standing within the top 20. After seeing Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose enter their respective Fearless Cabins, Shi Feng started planning how to earn Seven Luminaries Crystals in God’s Domain.

Although he was currently ranked tenth in the contribution competition, the other participants had yet to take things seriously. Meanwhile, the competition’s top 20 participants’ being able to exchange for three items from the middle layer presented a huge opportunity for the various corporations. They would definitely do everything they could to enter the top 20. If he wished to secure his position within the top 20, he would need 200,000 contribution points, at the very least, and possibly more if the competition was intense. After all, the various corporations had been operating in the Upper Zone for a long time now. The wealth they had accumulated wasn’t something he could hope to rival.

In other words, he was still short of 15,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystals right now.

This was an astronomical number, even for the Five Great Super Guilds. Afterward, Shi Feng drank a Strengthening Potion and Life Potion before lying down in the Fearless Cabin in his bedroom.
