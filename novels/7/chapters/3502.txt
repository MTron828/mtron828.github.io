Chapter 577 – On the Basis That I Am Black Flame!

“A battle group fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment?”

When Red Frost heard Shi Feng’s words, she felt he was joking with her.

Whether it was Legendary Weapons or Legendary Equipment, both were incredibly rare and precious in the Greater God’s Domain. Even upper-ranking hegemonic powers would rarely be willing to let their developing paragons use these items.

Take Star Lake Legion, for example. The entire legion only had three Legendary Weapons and Equipment in its possession, and all three were on loan from the City Lord after he dug into his own pockets to acquire them. The Star Lake Legion couldn’t even afford to fully equip a player in Legendary items, let alone a full battle group consisting of twenty participants.

!!

In fact, not even top-ranking second-tier mobile cities would dare to think of fully equipping a 20-man battle group in Legendary items.

“Indeed! A battle group fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment!” Shi Feng nodded. “If you can have such a battle group under you, how confident are you at winning, Commander Red Frost?”

Normally, only upper-ranking hegemonic powers and above could possibly accomplish the feat of fully equipping a 20-man battle group in Legendary Weapons and Equipment. Ordinary hegemonic powers and corporations operating in third-tier cities shouldn’t even consider doing such a thing.

However, he was in possession of the Divine Engraver Legacy. He was also a Basic Apprentice Divine Engraver. So long as he could further develop the strength of his mana by a little bit, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to learn how to draw Intermediate Divine Patterns in seven days.

Previously, he had already mastered drawing a set of Basic Divine Patterns. The only reason he didn’t attempt to learn how to draw Intermediate Divine Patterns and become a bona fide Divine Engraver was that he lacked God Crystals.

If he wanted to learn a set of Intermediate Divine Patterns from the Divine Engraver Legacy, he would need to spend 50 God Crystals. This was not an amount that the average power could take out. Back then, he would have needed to sell everything he owned just to gather the required 50 God Crystals.

Not to mention, becoming a bona fide Divine Engraver wasn’t his priority back then. So, he didn’t bother to invest too much time and resources into the endeavor.

Now, though, not only did the Green God Corporation secretly gather a group of Lifestyle talents for him, but he had also received a large amount of funds. He could begin nurturing a large batch of players into Apprentice Divine Engravers at any time, and it wouldn’t be long before these players became Apprentice Divine Engravers.

If he couldn’t become an official Divine Engraver before that happened, he wouldn’t be able to carry out his subsequent plans. After all, he couldn’t possibly spend 50 God Crystals to let someone else learn from the Book of Eternity in his place. The cheapest and safest way to carry out his plans would be if he learned how to draw Intermediate Divine Patterns himself.

Meanwhile, once he could draw Intermediate Divine Patterns, he would be able to strengthen Fragmented Legendary items. At that time, he would simply have to strengthen a battle group fully equipped with Fragmented Legendary items. Then, he would have himself a battle group that possessed Basic Attributes rivaling a battle group fully equipped with Legendary items. Moreover, he wouldn’t have to worry about applying too much extra burden on the participants’ mental state.

Of course, to keep his ability to draw divine patterns a secret as much as possible, he still couldn’t reveal too many.

A 20-man battle group was about the limit. If he strengthened the weapons and equipment of only 20 participants, he could still justify it by claiming to have purchased a batch of Intermediate Divine Patterns at an exorbitant price. Any more, and he would have a hard time explaining himself.

If he were to accidentally expose to the various powers his ability to draw Intermediate Divine Patterns, it’d be the end of the road for him.

Whether it was Demon’s Gate or the Seven Luminaries Alliance, every apex power would try to capture him at all costs to take control of the Intermediate Divine Patterns in his possession. With his current strength, there would be nothing he could do to resist.

“If you can get such a battle group for me, there is nothing else I can say.” Grinning, Red Frost patted her well-endowed chest and expressed confidently, “If I still can’t secure victory in the Tier 6 battle, I will help you with anything you need in the future without question.”

Looking at Red Frost’s seductive and noble appearance, Shi Feng suddenly felt that if Blackie and the others were to learn of Red Frost’s suggestion, they would 100% hope that the coalition of fifteen cities would win against Star Lake City.

Setting aside the fact that Red Frost was a stunning beauty, just the fact that she was a pseudo-great grandmaster was already enough to tempt any upper-ranking hegemonic power and pseudo-apex power into recruiting her.

In the Greater World, three-star grandmasters could control a city, while great grandmasters could influence the direction of an entire continent’s development. A great grandmaster could also control a first-tier city and command respect from the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers and conglomerates.

“If you have no problems with the Tier 6 battle, winning the city battle also wouldn’t be a problem,” Shi Feng hurriedly said when he noticed Red Frost starting to scrutinize him again. “After the city battle, Star Lake City will be able to take a leap forward and become a second-tier city. I’m sure the City Lord will be very interested in my proposal.”

The lifelong dream of many three-star grandmasters was to preside over a second-tier mobile city. This was so they could cross the large hurdle before them and enter the realm of great grandmasters.

No matter how affluent a third-tier city was, it still had far too few energy resources to supplement the birth of a great grandmaster. Even the most energy-rich location in a third-tier city would only be comparable to the central district of a second-tier city, and it was still far from matching the most energy-rich location of a second-tier city. Not to mention, a second-tier city’s City Lord enjoyed much greater status in the God’s Domain Association than a third-tier city’s City Lord.

The God’s Domain Association was an incredibly mysterious organization in the Greater World. Nobody knew about the Association’s origins, but everyone knew that the Association could produce great grandmasters.

Or, more specifically, apart from certain special opportunities in God’s Domain, the only way a person could become a great grandmaster in the Greater World was by relying on the God’s Domain Association. In fact, the majority of the Greater World’s great grandmasters only existed because of the Association.

Star Lake City’s City Lord was already old, and his chances of becoming a great grandmaster were slim. If he wanted to achieve a breakthrough and prolong his lifespan and youth, his only option would be to become the City Lord of a second-tier city.

“You’re right.” Returning to her seat, Red Frost crossed her legs and nodded. Then, she smiled and said, “The City Lord will not be able to resist a chance to become a second-tier city’s City Lord. He will even be willing to stake his life for it. But, the problem is, on what basis do you expect us to believe you can fulfill any of your promises?”

Shi Feng’s proposal indeed tempted Red Frost. Her mind had even temporarily fallen into disarray because of it.

However, she was a pseudo-great grandmaster. She was also the Silver Lake Legion’s commander, and she wielded the most authority in Star Lake City after the City Lord. She naturally wouldn’t trust someone so easily. Not to mention, Shi Feng’s offer sounded too good to be true.

Shi Feng also sat back down. Then, looking at Red Frost in the eye, he calmly said:

“On the basis that I am Black Flame.”

Shi Feng did not speak in a loud voice. Yet, his words had seemingly stopped time as the lounge fell completely silent.
