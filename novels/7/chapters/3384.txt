Chapter 459 – Surpassing Dragons

When Manoset threw his punch, even the hall’s sturdy space instantly turned into a dark void. Not only did this void devour all mana caught within its vicinity, but it also caused time to slow down to a standstill. As a result, Shi Feng and every other player present could not move.

Moreover, apart from Shi Feng, Frey, Unrestrained Lionheart, and a few other experts on the team, everyone else experienced a lag in their thoughts.

It’s over…

So, this is the strength of a Holy Ancestor?

Frey and Unrestrained Lionheart were greatly shocked when they saw the destruction happening before their very eyes.

Tier 6 Gods were very rarely seen in the Greater God’s Domain, but as a pseudo-apex power, the Red Dragon Nation had plenty of video information on Tier 6 Gods. The Guild even had quite a few video recordings of Ancient Gods in battle.

However, out of all the Gods and Ancient Gods recorded in the Red Dragon Nation’s archives, not even the strongest Ancient God could throw out a punch as powerful as Manoset’s.

Incredible! This punch is already as strong as a Primordial God’s attack!?Shi Feng was also greatly surprised by Manoset’s devastating punch.

Shi Feng had fought against many Holy Gods during his previous life, but never had he come across a Holy Ancestor before. So, this was his first encounter with a Holy Ancestor.

Even in the Holy Race’s world, few records were available on Holy Ancestors. As far as Shi Feng was aware, no human player had come across a Holy Ancestor during his previous life, and all everyone knew was that Holy Ancestors were existences rivaling Primordial Gods.

Meanwhile, it should be known that Manoset was currently in a sealed state. Even though he had already broken free of the chains binding him, his strength remained sealed, and he’d be fortunate if he could even unleash 30% of his actual strength.

Yet, even with just 30% of his strength, Manoset could already throw a punch rivaling that of Primordial Gods.

While Shi Feng was marveling at Manoset’s punch, the shock that Frey and Unrestrained Lionheart experienced gradually turned into despair.

A Primordial God’s attack simply wasn’t something Tier 5 players could withstand. Even Fragmented Legendary items would be reduced to dust if struck by a Primordial God’s attack. So long as they were killed by it, they would most certainly see their Immortal Souls extinguished.

However, when Manoset’s fist was just ten yards away from reaching Shi Feng’s group, the Goddess’s Shadow, who was in the middle of chanting an incantation, suddenly waved her hand.

Boom!

An explosion shook the entire Courtyard of Space, the shockwaves of the explosion causing the courtyard’s environment to crack like glass. If another such explosion occurred, the courtyard’s environment would most certainly shatter, and everything within the courtyard would perish.

Back inside the castle’s top-floor hall…

We’re alive?

We’re not dead?

The players in the hall couldn’t help but be surprised as they inspected their bodies.

Although most of the players present had failed to see what had just happened, they weren’t fools. Time in the hall had yet to freeze the instant Manoset swung his fist, so everyone understood that there was no way any of them could have survived an attack from the Holy Ancestor.

While everyone was wrapped in confusion, several thoroughly translucent barriers before them shattered and disappeared one after another. When the fifth barrier disappeared, and cracks started to appear on the sixth one, Manoset’s fist came to a complete stop.

Am I dreaming? A sixfold World Wall??Unrestrained Lionheart nearly dropped his staff when he saw the barriers that had just shattered, and he couldn’t help but look toward the Goddess’s Shadow.?Is she really just a doppelganger?

World Wall was a Tier 6 Defensive Spell. It was also the strongest Defensive Spell available at Tier 6.

Normally, even a Tier 6 expert at the fifth-floor standard could, at best, silent-cast a onefold World Wall. And if they chanted the Spell’s incantation, they could cast a twofold World Wall.

Yet, the Goddess’s Shadow had constructed a sixfold World Wall with just a wave of her hand. Normally, this was a feat an Ancient God would find extremely difficult to accomplish even with their true bodies…

“Die!”

Manoset was unfazed even after seeing his first attack failing to connect. Without hesitation, he began throwing out a barrage of devastating punches, the punches so numerous that it looked like a wall of fists was approaching Shi Feng’s group.

The players present were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

A Gold Combat Technique?!

Impossible! How can an NPC use a Gold Combat Technique? How are we supposed to even fight against such an NPC?

Of those present, Frey and Unrestrained Lionheart were especially shocked when they saw the barrage of punches. With their vast knowledge of God’s Domain, they immediately understood that Manoset had just executed a Gold Combat Technique.

It should be known that NPCs typically possessed much greater Basic Attributes than players. They also had higher combat standards than monsters, with many Tier 6 NPCs having combat standards at the fourth-floor standard. Because of these factors, very few Tier 6 players could rival Tier 6 Gods, and a large number of Tier 6 experts were necessary to take down a Tier 6 God under normal circumstances.

However, if a Tier 6 God knew how to use Gold Combat Techniques on top of having greater Basic Attributes than players and greater combat standards than monsters, defeating them would be nigh impossible for players.

“Seal!”

Just as the barrage of punches was about to reach Shi Feng’s group, a divine voice suddenly echoed in everyone’s mind. Immediately afterward, the wall of fists gradually disappeared.

“Dammit, Space! You cannot stop me!” Manoset yelled out in pain and fury.

Subsequently, countless divine runes appeared around Manoset, locking down the space within a 100-yard radius of the Holy Ancestor. Then, these divine runes started to resonate with the remaining chains on Manoset’s body and sap away at his strength.

Primordial God… Tier 6 Ancient God… Tier 6 God…

The instant Manoset’s Life Rating fell to the Tier 5 standard, the brightness of the divine runes around him peaked, and Manoset’s strength stopped falling.

“Hahaha! Is this the limit of your doppelganger?” Manoset laughed when he saw the Goddess’s Shadow’s body destabilizing. “Or do you think these ants can defeat me just because I’ve been weakened to Tier 5?”

Manoset’s mockery did not earn any reaction from the Goddess’s Shadow. Instead, the Goddess Shadow merely turned to the hall’s entrance and said to Shi Feng’s group, “The rest is up to you now. I have already suppressed Manoset to the best of my abilities, but I can only maintain this suppression for a limited time.”

After saying so, the Goddess’s Shadow closed her eyes and focused all her attention on maintaining Manoset’s seal.

“She wants us to fight that?”

When everyone looked at the weakened Holy Ancestor, they couldn’t help but reveal a wry smile.

…

[Manoset] (Holy Ancestor, Tier 5)

Level 148

HP 1,500,000,000,000

… 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was true that Manoset had been weakened to the Tier 5 standard, but simply looking at Manoset’s HP was enough to tell them how frighteningly powerful Manoset was still. Even a Dragon of the same tier would be put to shame when compared to the Holy Ancestor.

Before everyone could come to terms with the situation, Manoset swung his fist at the team once again. Compared to before, Manoset’s punch this time was much less frightening. Even so, it still carried power at the Tier 6 standard, and it was strong enough to distort the surrounding space.

...

Before Manoset’s punch could reach the team, a Tier 5 Demidragon Shield Warrior intercepted it.

The Demidragon Shield Warrior was the tank that had previously received the Orichalcum Secret Treasure from Frey. After he let out a roar, his shield transformed into multiple barriers of light that continuously redirected and weakened Manoset’s punch.

One of the 99 Absolute Techniques, Skylight Guardian!

Boom!

Subsequently, the Demidragon Shield Warrior was sent flying and crashing into a wall, his shield falling out of his hands and his HP decreasing by over 80%…

“Crest!”

Unrestrained Lionheart was greatly shocked by this development.

Crest was their team’s ace tank. Not only did he wield a top-tier Fragmented Legendary Shield close to rivaling Legendary Shields, but he also had the Orichaulcum Secret Treasure equipped. Combined with the Absolute Technique Skylight Shield, even if he blocked an attack from a Tier 6 Divine monster, he shouldn’t lose more than 30% of his HP.

Yet, now, not only did Manoset’s attack put Crest into a heavily injured state, but the Shield Warrior had also lost over 80% of his HP.

How were they supposed to fight against such a powerful foe?
