Chapter 2864 - Astonishing Zero Wing

“He’s finally gone.” Jade Leaf heaved a deep sigh of relief when Shi Feng’s group disappeared into the distance. Previously, she thought that Shi Feng would take action against them. Although they weren’t afraid of getting killed, losing equipment would still impact them to a certain extent.

“Black Flame!” Awakened Abyss glared at the distant sky. “Just you wait! I’ll get back at you one day!”

Although Shi Feng was indeed powerful, he wasn’t an invincible existence.

This was especially true in the War of Worlds. Let alone Tier 4 World Creation experts, even Tier 5 NPCs were incapable of stopping their invasion. Otherwise, so many kingdoms on the eastern continent wouldn’t have fallen so soon after the War of Worlds began. Now, while it might seem like both sides had reached a balance, they were merely accumulating their strength. Moreover, it wouldn’t be long before the next large-scale operation began.

“Abyss, you’d better not mess around. Black Flame is much scarier than we initially expected. If you disrupt the Alliance’s plans, even Elder Windshadow won’t be able to protect you,” Jade Leaf warned. “What we need to do now is notify the Elder about Black Flame as soon as possible.”

Although a peerless overlord like Shi Feng couldn’t affect the overall situation of the war between the two God’s Domains, he could still affect the outcome of some war theaters.

“I know.” Awakened Abyss nodded. “After this operation, I’ll return to headquarters and apply for a trial slot.”

“You’ll apply for the trial now? Isn’t it too soon?” Jade Leaf asked in surprise.

The God’s Domain they came from was different from this God’s Domain. Their world had plenty of Legacies. One of the more valuable Legacies Hundred Ghosts possessed was an ancient trial, and the entry slots for this trial were generally reserved for the Guild’s top talents.

However, while this ancient trial could provide significant growth to players, it also came with significant risks. Failure would put players’ souls into a weakened state for a long period. Moreover, every top talent in the Guild had only one opportunity to challenge this trial.

“If I can improve my strength now, I can earn more Contribution Points in the upcoming war. So long as I accumulate enough points, I can just exchange for another trial slot.”

Awakened Abyss had long considered challenging the ancient trial.

The Interstellar Alliance was adamant in acquiring the eastern continent; hence, it had offered incredibly lavish rewards to those willing to contribute to this cause. With his status as one of Hundred Ghosts’s peerless geniuses, acquiring another slot for future use wouldn’t be difficult so long as he made enough contributions in the war.

His only problem was that he needed to achieve World Creation in this trial.

Previously, Awakened Abyss had only heard rumors regarding the strength of World Creation, but he hadn’t known exactly how powerful the ability to create a small world was. However, after seeing Shi Feng’s battle, he finally understood the power of World Creation. This was why he had decided to challenge the trial ahead of time. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Arctic Canyon, Zero Wing City:

Several bright flashes appeared above the teleportation array inside Zero Wing City’s Teleportation Hall as Shi Feng’s party of seven teleported into the city.

So, this is Zero Wing City?

Sixteenth Cloud was astonished when she arrived inside the Teleportation Hall.

What incredibly dense Mana!

Although she had long since heard rumors that Zero Wing City’s Mana was extraordinary, she found that the city was even more amazing than the rumors had depicted it to be.

Zero Wing City was bustling with people. All sorts of NPC merchants and NPC nobles were walking down the street outside the Teleportation Hall. She spotted even Tier 4 NPCs wandering the city.

If not for her coming to Zero Wing City to sign a partnership contract with Zero Wing on behalf of Shining Tiger, she would’ve never realized that Zero Wing City was such an amazing place.

Fithalia, MacAffrey, and Crimson Witch were also shocked by the city.

Not only did Zero Wing City possess superior Mana to the Starlight Fortress’s, but its security standard was also incredible. There were even Tier 4 NPCs patrolling the city. Zero Wing City’s security standard was something no other Guild City in God’s Domain could even imagine having.

While the various superpowers boasted Tier 4 NPCs of their own, these NPCs were Personal Guards the various superpowers nurtured. The superpowers treated every one of these NPCs as their most precious combatants, normally using them to defend entire towns or cities single-handedly.

However, in Zero Wing City, Tier 4 NPCs were actually tasked with leading patrol squads. Moreover, there wasn’t just one such patrol squad patrolling the city streets but many. The Tier 4 NPCs that were precious in the eyes of the various superpowers were no different from cabbages in Zero Wing City. Shi Feng, though, did not find this situation particularly surprising. Zero Wing City was currently the only Main Guild City in God’s Domain. It was even situated in the Arctic Canyon, a high-level neutral map. The number of Tier 4 NPCs seeking to develop themselves here would naturally be significant. Hence, Zero Wing City could recruit a group of Tier 4 NPCs to serve as soldiers.

Not to mention, Zero Wing City’s Mana environment rivaled that of the ancient God’s Domain, making the city even more attractive to Tier 4 NPCs. After all, if one wished to develop themselves further, one would need to improve one’s understanding of Mana.

However, Shi Feng had to admit that Zero Wing City had truly made significant progress while he was gone. Not only had the strength of the city’s NPC soldiers improved, but even the players occupying the city had grown stronger. Now, the players here were all Tier 3 or above, with even the lowest-leveled among them at Level 136. He had even noticed quite a few Tier 4 players in the city. On the way from the Teleportation Hall to Zero Wing’s Residence, Shi Feng had spotted more than ten Tier 4 players, which meant that Zero Wing City was even more prosperous than the Starlight Fortress. After all, any player capable of entering Zero Wing City now was a member of either Zero Wing or one of the Guild’s partners, and this drastically reduced the number of players capable of entering the city.

Apart from that, the number of Zero Wing’s members present in the city had reached an incredible number.

When Zero Wing City was first opened after its promotion to Main City, only several tens of thousands of Zero Wing members had entered it. Yet, according to the information Shi Feng received from the Guild Residence, there were more than 500,000 Zero Wing members in the city now.

Given that one needed to be at least Tier 3 to operate around Zero Wing City, Zero Wing currently had at least 500,000 Tier 3 players under its command.

This number definitely surpassed that of ordinary superpowers by a large margin and rivaled what Super Guilds had.

“Guild Leader, this is our Guild’s latest development report,” Liang Jing said with a hint of pride as she handed Shi Feng a statistics report.

Although a lot of things had occurred on the eastern continent during Shi Feng’s absence, because of the Mobile Fortress and three Guild Cities, Zero Wing managed to hurdle most of these problems. In fact, during the War of Worlds, Zero Wing City had practically become a shelter that all players sought to enter. Many annihilated Guilds and wandering adventurer teams had chosen to join Zero Wing, which resulted in Zero Wing’s member count skyrocketing

If not for resource limitations, the Guild’s member count would’ve most likely doubled by

now.

Amazing!

Shi Feng was astounded when he read the numbers on the report. At present, Zero Wing’s total Tier 3 member count already exceeded 800,000, more than 500,000 of which were operating in Zero Wing City. The rest were operating in Stone Forest City, Silverwing City, and the Mobile Fortress.

However, this still wasn’t the most astonishing part.

What was more important was that Zero Wing now had 73 Tier 4 players under its command. This number was even higher than what the average Super Guild had.

For a moment, Shi Feng even wondered if he had returned to the wrong Guild.

After all, super-first-rate Guilds currently had only a dozen or so Tier 4 players, with stronger ones having 20. Super Guilds had only around 30 or 40. Only existences like the Five Great Super Guilds had over 70 Tier 4 experts.

Moreover, according to Liang Jing’s report, Zero Wing still had over 40 players stuck inside their respective Tier 4 Legacy Lands, and half of them were expected to succeed in their promotion. In other words, Zero Wing would soon have over 100 Tier 4 experts under its command.

Of course, the main reason Zero Wing could produce such frightening numbers was Zero Wing City’s environment. The environment here allowed players to continuously improve their knowledge of and control over Mana.

Looking at Shi Feng’s surprised expression, Liang Jing suggested, “Guild Leader, several more Outerworld superpowers arrived on the eastern continent recently, and some of the eastern continent’s superpowers got annihilated as a consequence. I think we should absorb the Tier 3 and Tier 4 players of these fallen superpowers.

“Since our income of resources has reached a bottleneck, and we can support only so many Guild members with what we currently have, I wish to open Zero Wing City further. With the city’s advantages, we can easily acquire even more resources. Then, we can recruit more experts into Zero Wing.”

Shi Feng nodded in agreement with Liang Jing’s suggestion.

The War of Worlds was indeed a scary event, but it was also a good opportunity for development. This was because the moment the World Passage opened, the players of the two God’s Domains were enemies. Not only were players from the two God’s Domains incapable of adding each other as friends, but they couldn’t communicate with each other through the system, either.

In addition, players of the two worlds could kill each other without accumulating any Crime Value. In fact, native players would even receive gifts and EXP from killing Outerworld players-albeit significantly lower EXP than the EXP awarded for killing monsters and NPCs.

Most importantly, native players couldn’t join Outerworld Guilds and vice versa. Hence, native forces were the only option available to members of fallen superpowers. “We should indeed open Zero Wing City further to the public.” Smiling, Shi Feng added, “Before that, though, we still need to do something.”

“We still need to do something?” Liang Jing parroted in confusion. In her opinion, Zero Wing had already done everything possible and reached its current development limit. To expand its forces further, the only option it had was to open up Zero Wing City. As for Zero Wing’s other territories, developing them any further was impossible at present.

“That’s right.” Nodding, Shi Feng took out a document and said, “Prepare the materials on this list for me. I need them immediately.”

Further opening Zero Wing City to the public was a must. However, before doing so, he needed to complete the intercontinental teleportation array. With it, the city’s opening would generate much better results.
