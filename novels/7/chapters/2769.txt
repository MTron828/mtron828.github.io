Chapter 2770 – City of Riches

Meteorite City: Meteorite wasn’t just a gathering place in the Meteorite Mountain Range for humans to live and conduct trade in. It was also the safest location for humans in the Meteorite Mountain Range.

After the knight legion registered the information of Shi Feng’s party with the city, Cooling Cloud led the five straight into the city.

Meanwhile, as Shi Feng and his party members were non-residents of Meteorite City, they each had to pay an entrance fee of five Magic Crystals. Let alone Lifeless Thorn and the others, even Shi Feng was stunned by this fraudulent price.

Meteorite City’s entrance fee was more than ten times greater than the various Guild Cities’, not to mention that of modern NPC cities.

At this point, the market value of Magic Crystals had already risen to 40 Silver per crystal. Five Magic Crystals was the equivalent of two Gold.

Unless the city’s Mana had condensed into a liquid state, only a fool would pay such an entrance fee.

However, from the behavior of the NPCs and players here, it looked as if they had long since gotten used to this situation. Even Yu Luo paid the five Magic Crystals without hesitation.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, this is the standard price here.” Naturally, Yu Luo could tell what was going through the minds of Shi Feng’s party. Smiling, she whispered, “But please believe me that this price is absolutely reasonable!”

Initially, she, too, had been shocked by this price.

After all, she wasn’t the Guild Leader of a Guild, unlike Shi Feng, but merely a team leader in an adventurer team. The Magic Crystals she had on hand had only numbered 200 or so. Paying five Magic Crystals just to enter a city had been an extravagant expenditure for her.

However, after entering Meteorite City, she quickly realized that this price was definitely reasonable. Compared to the NPC Main Cities in the modern God’s Domain, Meteorite City could practically be considered a Holy City.

Of course, Shi Feng wouldn’t dwell on this matter. After all, five Magic Crystals was basically nothing to him. He was merely surprised by the absurd entrance fee.

Afterward, Shi Feng paid the entrance fee for his party of five, then followed Cooling Cloud and Yu Luo through the magic array that enveloped Meteorite City. This is a Main City of the ancient era?

When Shi Feng set foot in Meteorite City, a comfortable feeling immediately enveloped his body.

This comfortable feeling was different from the kind of comfort he felt when entering a place with high Mana density. Instead, entering this city allowed him to have a clearer perception of the world. Particularly, his perception of the various magic elements had sharpened over twofold. When he had first arrived in the ancient era, he had already sensed a significant improvement in his affinity with magic elements. If he could train in the environment here, he was confident that not only could he break through his Mana Body’s 100% threshold, but his efficiency in learning magic arrays, Skills, and Spells would also double or triple. This was a wondrous place for development.

Nonetheless, the environment inside Meteorite City was actually significantly better than the environment outside. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In fact, Shi Feng even had a hunch that if he used a Legacy Guidance here, he could exceed his Mana Body’s 100% limit in just a few days. “The magic array protecting the city is personally crafted by a human Saint. Not only does it have strong defensive properties, but it even improves the Mana Perception of the city’s inhabitants. However, operating this magic array requires a lot of Magic Crystals, hence the entrance fee,” Yu Luo explained. “Actually, Meteorite City’s big trade market and huge population flow have already helped reduce the entrance fee. Some cities even charge seven or eight Magic Crystals.”

“No wonder you managed to improve your control over Mana so much,” Shi Feng said in realization as he looked at Yu Luo.

Yu Luo had already unlocked her Mana Body’s potential to 100%, and her control over Mana had even reached the Master Magician standard. If her Concentration standard reached Tier 4, she would be able to form her own Mana Domain and become top-tier among Tier 3 peak experts.

Most Domain Realm experts hadn’t even reached the Master Magician standard at this stage of the game. And although Yu Luo was very talented, she was still far from comparable to Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow. Yet, even with his help, those two were still half a step away from becoming Master Magicians, so how could Yu Luo possibly overtake them?

The only explanation was the environment here.

“Mhm. I’ve improved a lot after arriving here,” Yu Luo said as she nodded confidently.

“That’s right. Yu Luo has been improving rapidly during this period. Now, she can already rank among the knight legion’s top five healers,” Cooling Cloud said, nodding. Although she didn’t have a high opinion of Yu Luo’s initial strength, she very much acknowledged the Cleric’s talent.

“Actually, it is all thanks to Lady Angelica’s teachings,” Yu Luo said. At the mention of Angelica Teresa, an expression of gratitude and admiration appeared on her face. “It’s a pity that we failed to complete the quest this time. Had we succeeded, Lady Angelica might’ve become the Lord of Meteorite City. If the city comes under Lady Angelica’s leadership, the city will prosper and possibly even rank up into an Advanced Main City.”

“Become the Lord? What kind of quest is she trying to do?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

His Inferior Mythic Quest had stated that he needed to help Angelica Teresa become Meteorite City’s Lord. Now that a clue on how he could do so had appeared, he naturally was curious.

“It’s nothing. Everyone in the city already knows about it at this point.” Since Shi Feng expressed interest in this topic, Cooling Cloud explained slowly, “Meteorite City has been developing for hundreds of years already, and its population and scale of operation have grown significantly. However, at this point, the city has reached a bottleneck. The old City Lord also abdicated recently. As one of the candidates to replace the Lord, Lady Angelica Teresa wishes to improve Meteorite City.

“Meanwhile, there are two ways to help Meteorite City develop further. The first is to expand the city. However, the city’s magic array was personally established by the Saint, and nobody in the city is capable of modifying it. The only way to modify the magic array is to go to the Holy City and meet with the Saint. The chances of success are dismal. Setting aside how far away the Holy City is, just trying to meet with the Saint is already an incredibly difficult task.

“Hence, Lady Angelica can only resort to the second method-strengthening the magic array’s core, which would, in turn, upgrade the magic array. Recently, we received news that a Tier 4 Infant Dragon appeared over at the Ghostfire Hills. If we can hunt this Infant Dragon and secure its Dragon Eyes and Dragon Crystal, we can strengthen the magic array’s core. Only...”

At this point, Cooling Cloud sighed.

Let alone hunting that Tier 4 Infant Dragon, they had already fallen prey to a Demon army’s ambush shortly after leaving Meteorite City. What followed next was what Shi Feng himself had witnessed.

Travel to the Holy City to meet with the Saint or kill a Tier 4 Infant Dragon? Shi Feng shook his head and smiled bitterly at Cooling Cloud’s words.

Although he didn’t know where the Holy City was, since the NPC cities here had no teleportation arrays linking them, the journey to the Holy City could easily take several months. Moreover, even after arriving at the Holy City, it wouldn’t necessarily be possible to meet with the rumored Saint.

As for the other option of killing a Tier 4 Infant Dragon, that was even more ludicrous.

A Tier 4 Infant Dragon was an existence above even Demon Princes. It was an existence that could truly match Tier 5 existences.

When Shi Feng was in his Tier 4 Legacy Land, even after reaching Tier 4 and gaining a Tier 4 Legacy Skill, he could only put up a fight against the Tier 3 Infant Dragons there. Even with the Heavenly Dragon Breath’s help, he still couldn’t kill those Tier 3 Infant Dragons.

Now, Angelica Teresa actually had designs on a Tier 4 Infant Dragon despite being only at Tier 4 herself. Calling her actions suicidal would be an understatement.

Moreover, killing the Infant Dragon probably had to be done as soon as possible. After all, Dragons did not have the habit of living in a fixed location long-term. If he couldn’t help Angelica kill the Infant Dragon before it went elsewhere, he would have to look for the elusive Saint.

Sure enough, this isn’t a quest that can be completed easily.

However, Shi Feng did not feel particularly surprised by this situation. A Legendary Quest was already monumentally difficult to complete; an Inferior Mythic Quest would only be worse. He also had to admit that Angelica Teresa matched the legends, which portrayed her as a brave warrior who stood up against Dragons.

If Angelica succeeded in slaying a Tier 4 Infant Dragon despite being at Tier 4 herself, that would truly be a legendary feat.

The only thing Shi Feng could do now was look for opportunities to improve both his and his party’s strength. Otherwise, he would be utterly helpless against the Infant Dragon.

Under Cooling Cloud and Yu Luo’s lead, Shi Feng’s party arrived at Meteorite City’s trade market.

When Lifeless Thorn and the others saw the dazzling items put up for sale, their eyes widened in shock. The basic currency used in the market here was actually the Magic Crystal. Coins did not exist here.

However, they also had to acknowledge that the ancient era of God’s Domain was truly amazing. The NPCs here even sold Epic Weapons and Equipment players could use. Only, the price was somewhat high; even a random piece of Level 150 Epic Equipment sold for 20,000 Magic Crystals.

If converted to the Gold Coins used in the modern era, that would be equivalent to 8,000 Gold per piece of Level 150 Epic Equipment. While the various Super Guilds would kill to purchase Level 150 Epic Equipment for 8,000 Gold, it was a different story if the payment had to be in Magic Crystals. In addition to Epic Equipment, Fragmented Legendary Weapons and Equipment occasionally appeared in Meteorite City’s Auction House, which the various player forces in Meteorite City competed for. Only, one needed a minimum deposit of 300,000 Magic Crystals just to participate in the auction. Meanwhile, these Fragmented Legendary items usually ended up selling for over 400,000 Magic Crystals.

Whether it was Lifeless Thorn or Shi Feng, they couldn’t help feeling like they had become beggars after entering Meteorite City. Although Shi Feng carried some Magic Crystals with him, that number was only 50,000, just enough to purchase two pieces of Epic Equipment, at most, here.

Of course, it was also much easier to earn Magic Crystals here than in the modern God’s Domain since the Magic Crystal was the main currency used in the ancient era. Whether one completed quests or traded materials with NPCs, payment was in Magic Crystals. Hence, local players found the prices of the Epic and Fragmented Legendary items reasonable.

After walking around for several hours, Cooling Cloud bid goodbye to Shi Feng’s party since she still had matters to deal with as a captain in the local knight legion. As for Yu Luo, she stayed behind to serve as a tour guide for Shi Feng’s party.

Inside a high-class hotel in Meteorite City...

Staying in one of the ordinary rooms here cost 50 Magic Crystals a day, while the high-end rooms cost 200 Magic Crystals per day. Shi Feng chose to rent a high-end room without hesitation.

Shortly afterward, Shi Feng’s party of five and Yu Luo sat quietly inside the room.

“Out with it. How long has it been since you arrived here?” Shi Feng asked seriously as he looked at Yu Luo. “What’s up with the players here?”
