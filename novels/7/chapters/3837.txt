Chapter 3838 - 912 - King's Paradise

Desolate Star City, City Lord’s Manor:

The City Lord’s Manor was a majestic building levitating a thousand meters above Desolate Star City. Its top-floor reception room had a panoramic view of the entire city.

Many of the Starlight Continent’s heavyweights had gathered in the top-floor reception room. These heavyweights included City Lords of first-tier cities, helmsmen of conglomerates, and presidents of corporations with branches in hundreds of mobile cities. Individuals such as the heirs of conglomerates and City Lords of second-tier cities were not qualified to sit here.

Although over a hundred people sat at the round table in the middle of the room, most kept their mouths shut. They didn’t even dare to breathe loudly, staying as silent as possible as they observed the two young women at the main host and main guest seats.

Of the two young women, one exuded the aura of a noble princess; the other, the aura of an army general. The former was none other than the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess Frey, while the latter was King’s Paradise’s First Vice Guild Leader Lunar River.

“Miss Frey, do you have anything to add to our partnership? You don’t have to hold back with me,” Lunar River said, smiling with satisfaction as she looked at the stack of mostly signed contracts in her hands. “So long as you can provide us with 10,000 of Shadowring Town’s priority entry slots long-term, any conditions are negotiable.”

“Miss River, that is a huge demand. The Red Dragon Nation only has 30,000 priority slots. The most we can give you is 5,000 slots,” Frey said, exasperated by Lunar River’s appetite.

This wasn’t the first time Lunar River had brought up Shadowring Town’s priority entry slots in their three-hour discussion. On the contrary, she had mentioned it many times. This situation gave Frey a huge headache.

Unlike in the past, Shadowring Town was now overcrowded with players at all times. As soon as someone stepped out of the town, someone else would immediately take their place. Some human and Holy Race players would even sell their place in the town to others for two Eternal Gold per slot.

Even in the current Eternal Realm, a fourth-floor expert would be fortunate to save 50 Eternal Silver a day. After all, players’ daily expenditures in the Eternal Realm were extremely high, especially for players operating in high-level maps.

Due to the introduction of Soul Synchronization, players had to consume potions that aided in Concentration recovery and Concentration improvement if they wanted to operate out in the fields for long periods. Otherwise, the burden their weapons and equipment placed on their mental states would quickly wear them out. Such Master Potions typically cost 20 to 30 Eternal Silver per bottle and lasted no more than six hours, while Grandmaster Potions of this variety cost upward of one Eternal Gold per bottle. Not to mention, once players returned to a city, they would need to rely on good food and accommodation to recover their Stamina and Concentration quickly.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Five thousand it is, then,” Lunar River said when she saw that Frey refused to budge. “But if you decide to sell more slots, please get in touch with me first. I promise to give you a satisfactory price, Miss Frey.”

“You overestimate my abilities, Miss River. I only got a head start on the other powers due to a stroke of luck,” Frey said, shaking her head. Then, she sighed, “If you want more priority entry slots, your best bet would be to seek out Zero Wing. Like the other Guilds partnered with Zero Wing, I have only a few tens of thousands of slots.”

“You are too modest, Miss Frey. You are among the first batch of people to own private shops in Shadowring Town. Now, the various pseudo-apex powers have trouble even renting a shop in Shadowring Town, let alone owning any,” Lunar River said, wearing a respectful expression. Inwardly, though, she felt nothing but contempt for Frey. After all, the other party couldn’t even be bothered to hide the delight on her face.

Then, Lunar River continued, “I also heard that many powers have approached you about the 20,000 Tower of the Abyss allied entry slots in your possession. The Tower of the Abyss truly is a guiding light for fifth-floor experts. Even I can’t help but want to enter it. It’s a pity that there’s a daily limit on how many players can use the tower.”

“Yes, many have approached me about the allied entry slots. You are very well-informed, Miss River. I hadn’t expected you to know about the allied entry slots despite having yet to enter the Eternal Realm,” Frey said, nodding. Then, she sighed, “Regarding the Tower of the Abyss, I agree it is a wonderful place. It’s a pity that my comprehension is slightly poor. I have had barely any harvest, even with the allied entry slot’s two daily entries.

“As for the Red Dragon Nation’s 20,000 allied entry slots I possess, we only received them because Guild Leader Black Flame wants everyone in the alliance to improve together. However, after distributing the slots across the Red Dragon Nation’s subordinate powers, I only have 3,000 remaining. There aren’t even enough for my legions to share.”

“Each of your legions has at least 10,000 members, so 3,000 slots is indeed a bit too few.” Lunar River nodded, feigning sympathy. Inwardly, though, she did not believe a single word Frey said.

The Tower of the Abyss’s training system was one-of-a-kind. Unless the Red Dragon Nation had enough slots for its own use, it would have to be stupid to share its precious allied entry slots with its subordinate powers. If the Red Dragon Nation could afford to share its slots, the Guild had to have excess slots.

“Now that you mention it, I do hope I can meet Guild Leader Black Flame. His name has appeared many times during my research of the Eternal Realm. His success in establishing his Guild in the chaotic World Ark and constructing Shadowring Town are akin to legends,” Lunar River sighed. Then, she turned to meet Frey’s gaze and continued, “Of course, the support you and Azure Fang’s Vice Guild Leader have provided is also indispensable, Miss Frey. Without you two, Shadowring Town could never have achieved its current success, and Zero Wing could never have deterred the World Ark’s various powers from coveting its town.”

“Deter the various powers? Miss River, you truly overestimate us,” Frey said, shaking her head. “We might as well have been cheerleaders in that situation. Zero Wing’s strength is the sole factor deterring the various powers from taking action.”

“You are too modest,” Lunar River said, shaking her head. She refused to believe an upstart Guild was strong enough to deter the Holy Race’s royal powers and the human race’s apex powers from occupying Shadowring Town with force.

Frey could tell what was going through Lunar River’s mind, but she didn’t bother to explain herself. After all, even she would be just as skeptical if she were in Lunar River’s shoes.

While the two were chatting merrily, Lunar River suddenly received a call, and her expression quickly turned ugly.

“Did something happen?” Frey asked curiously.

“It’s nothing. It’s just an argument between a senior’s son and some little fellows that needs my intervention. As those little fellows have a gold invitation sent by one of Desolate Star City’s management powers, many powers are paying attention to this matter,” Lunar River said. Then, she suggested, “Since the Galaxy Conglomerate is now one of Desolate Star City’s management powers, how about you go with me, Miss Frey? This is a good opportunity to let the various powers meet you.”

“Okay.” After thinking about it, Frey felt it was necessary to let everyone know that the Galaxy Conglomerate had become one of Desolate Star City’s management powers.
