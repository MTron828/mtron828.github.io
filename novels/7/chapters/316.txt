Chapter 317 - Town Capture

“Guild Leader, our names are as red as blood right now. Most of us have killed more than ten people, while Blackie and I have killed more than a hundred each. We’ll need to waste a lot of time to cleanse our Red Names completely. By the time we do, most of the players from the other Guilds will have already reached Level 20,” Fire Dance said as she smiled bitterly.

If a player wished to remove their status as a Red Name, they needed to remove the Crime Value they had accumulated. One of the most common ways to get rid of Crime Value was to wait, as a player’s Crime Value decreased over time. However, if one’s Crime Value was excessively high, they needed to punish evil and promote righteousness.

However, although killing NPCs such as villains, criminals, and bandits would significantly reduce a player’s Crime Value, there was no other benefit for doing so. Killing these NPCs would not provide players with any additional rewards or EXP.

Moreover, these NPCs were very few and usually scattered all over God’s Domain. It would be fine if players hunted for these NPCs by themselves, but hunting as a group would be time-consuming and inefficient.

“Indeed. Let’s forget about cleansing your Red Names for now. We’ll raise our White River City Reputation. As long as you become nobles, entering the city as Red Names will not have significant consequences. We should have no problems taking on the class change quest,” Shi Feng made his decision after some thought. Otherwise, it would take around two to three days’ effort to cleanse such a high Crime Value.

“...”

Everyone fell speechless when they heard Shi Feng’s decision to raise their Reputation in White River City to the degree of becoming a noble. Shi Feng made it sound as if becoming a noble of White River City was as easy as buying cabbage from the market.

It was extremely difficult for players to raise their White River City Reputation, and one needed to invest a lot of time to accumulate sufficient Reputation Points to become a noble. In this case, it would be much easier to hunt for NPC bandits.

“Guild Leader, do you have a method to increase our White River City Reputation quickly?” Blackie knew that Shi Feng would not speak without reason. Suddenly, his eyes shone with a hint of excitement as he looked to his Guild Leader for answers.

A noble of White River City!

Currently, one could count the number of players that had become nobles of White River City on one’s fingers. After becoming a noble, not only could one purchase a business stall in White River City, but one could also receive high-level quests in the City. The rewards were enough to drool over. Although the EXP rewarded was low, the monetary rewards consisted of Silver Coins, not Copper Coins.

Most importantly, nobles could receive a 10% discount when purchasing items in White River City. They could also receive a 30% discount when repairing weapons and equipment!

Currently, every time they went to repair items, they would always leave with a stomach ache.

Due to the quality of their items, the repair fees were at least six times higher than the average player’s.

If they could become nobles of White River City, in the future, they would not become poor bastards whenever they needed to repair their equipment. They might even get the chance to enter the Noble’s District.

Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Blackie, saying, “Do you really think it is so easy to become a noble?”

The team could not help their laughter at Blackie as he nearly choked from Shi Feng’s reply.

“Although it is not easy to raise one’s Reputation in White River City, if one wishes to increase it quickly, there is indeed a method to do so.”

“Guild Leader, is there really such a method?” Cola asked excitedly. It was an absolute nightmare for him whenever he had to repair his equipment.

Out of cloth armor, leather armor, and plate armor, the repair fees for cloth armor were the cheapest. On the other hand, plate armor cost the most to repair, and normally, the fees were at least double that of cloth armor.

“Ah, there is one method: Town Capture,” Shi Feng nodded, revealing a mysterious smile.

Shi Feng’s announcement stunned his Guildmates. What kind of trouble was Shi Feng trying to stir?

They had just escaped from Dark Star’s pursuit, yet, now, they were going to capture a town?

“Town Capture?” Cola was confused.

Although he did not know why Shi Feng suggested they capture a town, such a thing was not easy. Level 50 Elite NPCs guarded every town. There were even Tier 2 NPCs protecting them. Even with their strength combined, they wouldn’t be a match for even a single Level 50 Elite NPC, not to mention a Tier 2 NPC.

“That’s right. However, we’re not going to capture just any town. Instead, our aim is Creek Town, one of the towns within the White River City region that’s occupied by evil-aligned NPCs. As long as we capture this town, we can obtain a lot of White River City Reputation Points. If we’re lucky, there might even be unexpected rewards,” Shi Feng explained. “However, it won’t be easy. I’ll need to make some preparations before we set off.”

“Just stay here and catch some fish for now. I’ll head back and make the necessary arrangements. I’ll notify you guys once I’m done.”

After Shi Feng said so, he used a Return Scroll.

Town Capture.... During the middle stages of God’s Domain, this was a commonplace activity for players.

There were plenty of small towns in God’s Domain, and a majority of these towns were not under the management of any kingdoms or empires. Instead, other forces occupied these towns. So long as players wished to establish their own empire in God’s Domain, it was a must for them to occupy towns. Meanwhile, if players wished to occupy a town, they needed to chase away the forces that occupied said town first. Only by doing so could they turn the town into their own Guild Town. They could then slowly develop and upgrade the town’s rank. It was also not impossible for players to develop a town to surpass even Star-Moon City. However, the conditions for doing so were extremely demanding, so it was very difficult for players to succeed.

Moreover, capturing a town was easier said than done.

Even if the current number one Guild in White River City, Ouroboros, went all out, they should not have any clue of how to capture a town. It should be impossible for Ouroboros to capture even the most bordered and resource-poor town.

On top of that, now that Shi Feng had unsealed the Endless Abyss, towns had upgraded their overall strength in preparation for the assault from Demonic Beasts, making it even more challenging for players to capture a town.

However, Creek Town, the town Shi Feng had chosen as his target, was slightly special. There was a Hidden Quest in White River City that would greatly reduce the overall strength of Creek Town. If the town were weakened, capture would become far easier. However, in order to accept this Hidden Quest, at the very minimum, one must first become a Viscount of White River City. Fortunately, Shi Feng just happened to be just that.

After Shi Feng returned to White River City, he suddenly became the focus of the entire city. Any players who saw him immediately began whispering to companions or strangers by their sides. Shi Feng was a celebrity right now, and everyone in White River City knew about him.

Although part of the reason why Shi Feng attracted so much attention was due to his blood-red name, the actual cause for his fame was due to the name Black Flame.

The video of the battle in the Silverleaf Forest was extremely exciting. The scene where Shi Feng had leaped high into the air to finish off Ming Sha was particularly unforgettable. Countless players had tried to mimic Shi Feng’s actions. Unfortunately, average players could, at most, jump two to three meters high. Compared to Shi Feng, who had managed to reach a height of eight meters, the gap between them was simply too massive. Moreover, Shi Feng had brandished his sword six times while in mid-air, and every strike accurately landed on Ming Sha’s vital points.

Through their attempts to mimic Shi Feng’s actions, everyone’s admiration for him grew. Everyone knew that a player’s Basic Attributes determined the gap between them and others. Only after making a comparison did they know just how wide the gap was between them and Shi Feng.

“Guild Leader Black Flame! When will Zero Wing hold another mass recruitment? I’ve been waiting to join Zero Wing for a long time now!” a Level 17 male Swordsman asked loudly.

“That’s right! This little girl wishes to join Zero Wing as well! Big Brother Black Flame, please tell this little sister when you’ll recruit again! It can be our little secret! I promise not to tell anyone!” a beautiful female Summoner asked sweetly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Everyone’s eagerness to join Zero Wing grew greater and greater. If Zero Wing had not announced to the public that it had temporarily halted recruitment in order to fine-tune the management of the Guild, the stampede of players might have trampled Zero Wing’s recruitment area by now.

The crowd’s enthusiasm started to make even Shi Feng grow afraid. Without a better choice, he said, “Everyone can rest assured that Zero Wing will definitely recruit for more members. Moreover, we will have even more slots available during the next recruitment. As for the time and venue, the recruitment will be held in three days at Zero Wing’s Guild Residence. I hope that everyone will show up for the registration when the time comes.”

Finished speaking, Shi Feng hurriedly escaped. If he remained any longer, he might not be able to get away.

“In three days? Great! I can use that time to improve my techniques and strength! I will definitely pass the test and become a member of Zero Wing!”

After receiving a specific time, everyone grew even more enthusiastic. They all swore to join Zero Wing no matter what.

In their minds, Zero Wing stood out like a sacred temple of experts.

Assassin Fire Dance, Guardian Knight Cola, Elementalist Aqua Rose, Berserker Lonely Snow, Cursemancer Black Cloud, Cleric Violet Cloud, Swordsman Black Flame, Swordsman Ye Feng, and many other experts all belonged to Zero Wing. These experts possessed brilliant battle records in God’s Domain, and they were far stronger than other Guilds’ experts.
