“A mental combat technique!”

Phoenix Rain was shocked when she felt the mental storm the old man emanated.

Mental combat techniques were extremely rare in God’s Domain. According to the various human powers’ understanding, the Holy Race wasn’t proficient in mental development but physical development. Yet, the old man could intimidate players with Concentration beneath the Tier 6 Peak standard with nothing but a glare. This was unheard-of.

“Unseeing Demon?” Shi Feng was also shocked by the one-eyed old man. “The Transcendent List’s 12th-ranked Unseeing Demon?”

The Transcendent List was the Holy Race’s version of the Divine Glory List. However, the Transcendent List had much more substance than the Divine Glory List.

Any expert on the Transcendent List could pose a significant threat to the major human powers. Those ranked in the Transcendent List’s top 100 could rival the Divine Glory List’s top 10, while those ranked in the Transcendent List’s top 20 had all grown to become sixth-floor experts in Shi Feng’s previous life.

Unseeing Demon was one of these experts. In Shi Feng’s previous life, Unseeing Demon had fought all three of the human race’s Three Absolutes in one-on-one duels. He won against one of them, drew with one of them, and lost to one of them. He was, without a doubt, a super powerhouse.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yes, that is me,” the one-eyed old man answered. “Since you know me, I will give you a chance. Surrender all your tokens, and I will let you leave Plot 095 alive!”

After Unseeing Demon said so, the five players behind him revealed their auras, which rivaled that of Level 220 Ancient Gods. The implication was clear: they would immediately take action should Shi Feng refuse.

…

The appearance of Unseeing Demon’s party naturally caught the attention of the powers observing Zero Wing’s movement from a distance. Among them, the spectating human powers were dumbfounded by this development.

“Six experts that rival Ancient Gods of the same level! Is this the strength of a royal power?”

“They’re no different from Humanoid Bosses! Just one of them can take care of the entire Plot 095, let alone six!”

“Unseeing Demon?! Isn’t Evil Nature being excessive?! Why would it mobilize an old fellow like him?! Apart from the five other royal powers, who else can contend with Evil Nature now?!”

Experts who could rival Ancient Gods of the same level were typically among the strongest combatants of the various pseudo-apex powers. As mighty as the human race’s Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers were, even they had no more than ten such experts each, while the weaker ones had only five or six such experts. Yet, Evil Nature had mobilized six such experts to seize just one plot of land. The gap in strength between Evil Nature and the human race’s pseudo-apex powers was like heaven and earth. They stood on completely different levels.

…

“Has Evil Nature gone insane?! Isn’t this just a competition?! Why would it mobilize an old monster like Unseeing Demon?! Does it really think the human race is a pushover?!” The Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Elder Martial was furious as he glared at Unseeing Demon’s figure displayed on his Magic Mirror.

“Elder Martial, is Unseeing Demon that strong?” Verdant Rainbow asked, Elder Martial’s fury piquing her curiosity.

“That old fellow isn’t just strong,” Elder Martial sighed helplessly. “He’s a walking disaster!”

Others might not know who Unseeing Demon was, but as a Grand Elder of the Seven Luminaries Alliance, Elder Martial knew just how terrifying of an existence the one-eyed old man was. According to the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s investigation, Unseeing Demon had once destroyed several Realms by himself. He was a walking disaster through and through.

“With that old fellow there, Plot 095’s ownership is already decided.” Turning to Verdant Rainbow, Elder Martial said, “Contact Black Flame and have him leave Plot 095 immediately. If Unseeing Demon decides to take action, not even the Holy Race’s other royal powers can stop him.”

Not even the other royal powers can stop him? Hearing this shocked Verdant Rainbow even more.

Verdant Rainbow knew a little about the other royal powers’ experts. They had quite a few existences who could rival Ancient Gods. They had even mobilized experts who could rival the Holy Race’s Holy Ancestors. Thus, she couldn’t help but doubt Elder Martial’s statement.

As Verdant Rainbow was about to call Shi Feng, the Magic Mirror showed him responding to Unseeing Demon.

…

“You want us to surrender our tokens?” After glancing at Unseeing Demon and the five experts behind him, Shi Feng stated plainly, “I’m afraid you’re not strong enough to make us do that.”

“Young man, are you tired of living?” Unseeing Demon’s voice grew cold.

Unseeing Demon had run rampant in the Holy Race’s Greater God’s Domain for many years. Since the human race was weaker than the Holy Race, he naturally didn’t regard human players to be of any significance.

Although Evil Nature’s investigation showed that Shi Feng had previously defeated Garuda, Unseeing Demon viewed their fight as nothing but children playing house. A true powerhouse who had mastered many top-tier Holy Arts could easily defeat Shi Feng and Garuda.

Shortly after Unseeing Demon finished speaking, a crisp voice suddenly entered everyone’s ears.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, can you leave this matter to us?”

Immediately, everyone turned to the source of the voice and saw that the speaker was none other than Purgatory Jade.

“Of course. Since you are interested, I will leave it to you, Miss Jade,” Shi Feng said, consenting to Purgatory Jade’s initiative.

“Little girl, do you know that you are courting death?!” Unseeing Demon glared at Purgatory Jade, unleashing an even more powerful mental storm at her.

However, before Unseeing Demon’s mental storm could reach her, Purgatory Jade unleashed a mental pulse that thoroughly neutralized it.

“Old man, are you referring to yourself?” Purgatory Jade retorted, looking at the surprised Unseeing Demon indifferently. “Put away your useless mental combat technique and bring out your true abilities. Otherwise, I’ll end you in three moves.”
