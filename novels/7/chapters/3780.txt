Chapter 3781 - 855 - Fourth-Ranked Divine Set

Taboo Secret Land, Flame Dragon God’s Nest, Shadow Mountains:

When the blinding light faded, Shi Feng found that his location had changed completely. But before he could scrutinize his surroundings, a series of notifications rang in his ears.

System: Congratulations! You have entered the Flame Dragon God’s Nest and initiated the Flame Dragon God’s Trial.

System: You have initiated the Mythical Quest Flame Dragon God’s Trial.
Quest Content: Kill the monsters inside the Flame Dragon God’s Nest to obtain Undying Souls. Upon collecting 100 Undying Souls, you may open the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury and exchange Undying Souls for the Flame Dragon God’s rewards.

System Warning: You have entered the Taboo Secret Land – Flame Dragon God’s Nest. Due to external interference, you will not be allowed to log out or contact the outside world. You may only leave the secret land if you find the exit or die.

System Warning: If you die in the secret land, part of your Immortal Soul will be lost. Please proceed with caution.

The system notifications left Shi Feng stunned for a long while.

Sure enough, it is the same as in the rumors. Shi Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he looked at the system notifications displayed before him.

The Flame Dragon God was also known as the Primordial Flame Dragon. It was a Primordial God-ranked existence, and the Flame Dragon God’s Nest it left behind was a trial rather than a place for players to level up.

For this reason, once players entered the Flame Dragon God’s Nest, they had to collect enough Undying Souls to exchange for an exit ticket if they wanted to leave the secret land safely. Otherwise, their only other exit option was to leave behind a part of their Immortal Souls.

It was incredibly challenging to obtain Undying Souls. Although players only needed to kill monsters in the secret land to get them, monsters were not guaranteed to drop Undying Souls. Not to mention, even the weakest monster in Flame Dragon God’s Nest was a Level 230 Legendary monster. A Level 220, Tier 6 player fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment would have difficulty killing even one of these monsters. Moreover, these monsters typically roamed in groups. There were also many Level 230-plus Divine monsters.

However, although it was difficult to obtain Undying Souls, the rewards players could exchange for from the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury were definitely well worth the effort.

There were the Six Great Divine Sets in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. The Flame God Set, ranked fourth among the Six Great Divine Sets, could be exchanged for from the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury. In Shi Feng’s previous life, the reason Holy Dragon Spear could become one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Eight Legendary Adventurer Teams wasn’t just its legendary 10,000 Tier 6 experts. The Flame God Set in its possession also played a crucial role.

One of the reasons other apex powers feared Demon’s Gate was because it possessed a Divine Set. Although the Divine Set in question wasn’t one of the Six Great Divine Sets, it still allowed its wearer to overwhelm experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Even the old monsters of apex powers would be rendered helpless.

Meanwhile, with the Flame God Set being one of the Six Great Divine Sets, so long as a player equipped it, they could instantly compete with Primordial Gods of the same level and become invincible in the Greater God’s Domain.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, Holy Dragon Spear managed to get all eight pieces of the Flame God Set. Presently, though, the Flame Dragon God’s Nest had just been activated. This was also the first time Holy Dragon Spear’s members were entering the secret land. Thus, now was the best opportunity for Shi Feng to obtain the Flame God Set.

While Shi Feng was in a daze, the other Tier 6 players who had also landed in the Shadow Mountains sprang into action. As if afraid others would claim all the monsters, they quickly formed parties to kill those roaming the Shadow Mountains’ outer area.

[Undying Dragon Knight] (Evil Spirit, Legendary)
Level 230
HP 8,000,000,000,000,000

[Undying Dragon Knight Captain] (Evil Spirit, Legendary)
Level 232


HP 12,000,000,000,000,000

Level 220-plus, Tier 6 players would not have any difficulties soloing Tier 5 Legendary monsters of the same level. However, the Legendary monsters in the Shadow Mountains were at least Level 230; they were already nearly as strong as Level 210, Tier 6 Divine Bosses. Thus, Level 220-plus, Tier 6 players needed to fight in six-man parties to kill these Legendary monsters.

“Boss Abyss, that person seems to be the Divine Glory List’s Black Flame!” a Level 224, Tier 6 Berserker wearing the Divine Wing Dynasty’s Guild Emblem suddenly exclaimed as he pointed at Shi Feng. “Demon’s Gate has placed a huge bounty on his head! We can get a Fragmented Divine Artifact if we kill him! Should we do him in?”

The Berserker’s words immediately piqued the interest of several Divine Wing Dynasty members around him.

Whether it was the prestige of killing a Divine Glory List expert or the rewards from Demon’s Gate’s bounty, neither were things the average core member of a pseudo-apex power could easily ignore.

“We’re not here to have fun. We need to quickly regroup with the others and focus on grinding monsters. If we are too slow in collecting Undying Souls, we won’t be able to recoup the price we paid to come here,” Abyss Water, who was a Level 226, Tier 6 Assassin clad in dark gray clothes and the leader of the group, said. However, when his gaze fell on Shi Feng, his eyes suddenly narrowed as he muttered icily, “Black Flame?”

“Boss, do you know him?” Abyss Water’s abrupt change surprised the Tier 6 Berserker.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Of course! Of course, I know him!” Abyss Water automatically sneered when he saw that Shi Feng was only Level 200. “He was the one who humiliated me on the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s Dark Star! If it wasn’t for him, I never would have had to return to join the Divine Wing Dynasty! It seems the heavens are finally on my side, allowing me to meet him here!”

After saying so, Abyss Water vanished and reappeared within 30 yards of Shi Feng, his behavior attracting the attention of many nearby.

“Isn’t that Abyss Water, the Divine Wing Dynasty’s number one chosen one?”

“Who is that Swordsman? Why is Abyss Water interested in him?”

When the surrounding players sensed the killing intent Abyss Water radiated, they all understood that he intended to act against Shi Feng. They also couldn’t help but wonder about Shi Feng’s identity. After all, Abyss Water was an incredibly famous expert in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Yet, he was now willing to harm his reputation just to attack a player of a much lower level.

“Heiser! Guild Leader Black Flame is in trouble! We need to help him!” Twilight Leaf, who had similarly landed in the Shadow Mountains’ outer area, said to Heiser anxiously when she saw Abyss Water advancing on Shi Feng.

Abyss Water was the Divine Wing Dynasty’s number one chosen one. Among the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s youths, only Heiser could achieve a convincing victory against him. Although Shi Feng’s combat standard and Law Projection were incredible, the significant level difference between him and Abyss Water made it impossible for him to defeat Abyss Water.

“No rush. Let’s watch first,” Heiser said as she calmly looked at Shi Feng and Abyss Water. “I heard from Big Sis Frost that Guild Leader Black Flame has been supporting her behind the scenes all this time and that she admires him greatly. Even my teacher has sung his praises. I’ve already decided I will challenge him to a fight, so this is a good opportunity to check out his strength.”

“But Guild Leader Black Flame is only Level 200, while Abyss Water is Level 226,” Twilight Leaf said anxiously. “Does he even stand a chance with such a huge level gap?”

“Don’t worry,” Heiser said, smiling. Then, she glanced at Abyss Water and continued, “I know Abyss Water’s standard. If Guild Leader Black Flame is as great as I’ve heard, he should have no problem surviving a couple of moves. I will intervene once he starts to struggle.”

Hearing this, Twilight Leaf could only agree with Heiser’s decision. If she were to fight Abyss Water one-on-one, her chances of victory would be slim. Not to mention, the party that Abyss Water led was composed entirely of the Divine Wing Dynasty’s chosen ones. They might not be as strong as her, but they weren’t significantly weaker.
