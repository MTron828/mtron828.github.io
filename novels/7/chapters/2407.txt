Chapter 2408 – Elven Race’s Divine Artifact

“You really are amazing, Guild Leader Black Flame. You recognized it at a glance,” Cleansing Flame praised the Swordsman, a little surprised when Shi Feng identified the tree branch.

Heaven’s Blade had tried all sorts of methods to appraise the branch but failed to learn anything. In the end, they had only discovered the tree branch’s identity after using an Ancient Appraisal Scroll.

And yet, Shi Feng had known what the branch was after a quick glance. It was unbelievable.

Everyone in God’s Domain knew about the Tree of Life, the Elves’ Divine Artifact, but there was very little information available about the tree itself.

The most the average player knew about the Tree of Life was that it produced the Fruit of Life.

The Fruit of Life was a sacred item that could resurrect NPCs, as well as a treasure that could drastically improve a living creature’s potentials. Even kings and emperors coveted the Fruit of Life.

“It’s no wonder why War Blood is out to get you and willing to go as far as to seal off the Molten Canyon.” Shi Feng realized what the previous encounter had been about when he saw the tree branch in Cleansing Flame’s hand.

“That’s right. War Blood found out about the tree branch and is doing everything it can to target us in the ancient ruin. Unfortunately, our commander is still trapped in the ruin, and we aren’t strong enough to save her,” Cleansing Flame said, clenching her teeth. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“However, that branch isn’t one of the Tree of Life’s main branches, just a side branch,” Shi Feng calmly deduced. “Moreover, I’m guessing that you have more than two or three side branches on your hands. I suspect you also have a main branch.”

“How did you know?” Cleansing Flame was flabbergasted.

Only a handful of people in Heaven’s Blade knew how many branches the adventurer team had and what kind they were.

“Although the Tree of Life’s branches are precious, they’re not valuable enough to push War Blood to such drastic measures. Besides, your willingness to offer a side branch as payment tells me that you have many more,” Shi Feng explained.

At this point, no player in God’s Domain knew more about the Tree of Life than Shi Feng.

The Tree of Life’s side branches were valuable treasures, each worth multiple pieces of Level 100-plus Epic Equipment.

These side branches could be cultivated to grow into a Tree of Life, and as long as they did, it would produce Water of Life. The tree wouldn’t produce much Water of Life, and it would take a long time, but the liquid was immensely valuable. It was, after all, one of the few items in God’s Domain that could resurrect an NPC. It was even effective on Tier 5 NPCs.

However, cultivating a Tree of Life from a side branch wasn’t easy, not to mention producing Water of Life. One would need to sacrifice astronomical resources to accomplish the feat. Even if War Blood wanted the side branch, it wouldn’t be desperate enough to seal off the Molten Canyon to get it.

The only explanation was that Heaven’s Blade had acquired one of the Tree of Life’s main branches.

The main branches were extraordinary and even more valuable than ordinary Legendary items. As long as one cultivated a Tree of Life from a main branch, the tree would be capable of producing Fruit of Life!

Fruits of Life were just as valuable as Fragmented Legendary items. Thus, it was easy to imagine how valuable a Tree of Life, which could produce an endless supply of the fruit, would be.

Even Super Guilds would sacrifice everything to get their hands on a main branch.

Hearing Shi Feng’s explanation, realization dawned on Cleansing Flame.

Shi Feng’s deduction was correct. War Blood had discovered that Heaven’s Blade had a main branch from the Tree of Life, which was why it so furiously targeted Heaven’s Blade.

With no other choice, her commander, Zwei, had sent her with the side branch to find outside help. These branches weren’t ordinary items, and they were guaranteed to drop on death. Her commander wouldn’t have been in such a precarious position otherwise.

“If you’re hoping that Zero Wing will save your commander just for a side branch, I’m afraid that I have to refuse. I’m sure you’re aware of how crazy and powerful War Blood is, not to mention its partnership with Starlink. I doubt any superpower would be willing to offend War Blood. Even if you offered me two or three side branches, I’d have to refuse,” Shi Feng told Cleansing Flame with a serious look. “However, it’s not impossible to afford Zero Wing’s help. We want one of the main branches; that’s the bottom line to purchase Zero Wing’s help in rescuing your commander.”

He did not particularly care about the Tree of Life’s side branches. He could easily find replacements for the Water of Life. The main branch, however, was a different story. Not only could the main branch provide Fruits of Life, but it could also yield Nuclei of Life.

The Nucleus of Life was one of the required materials to produce the Broken Steel Set Equipment. It was also the most difficult material to acquire. If he could secure a source of Nuclei of Life, he could forge his class set equipment.

An Epic Class-specific Set Equipment!

Even during his previous life, very few of the various superpowers’ experts had obtained Epic Set Equipment. Most had only worn an assortment of Epic Equipment.

With the Broken Steel Set Equipment, he could roam through the truly dangerous areas of God’s Domain and hunt down the three remaining fragments of Solomon’s Sword. With his current strength, he only had a 10% chance of surviving in these locations, and that was only because he had the Disintegration Armor, which could temporarily elevate him into a Tier 4 Sword Emperor. Without the Disintegration Armor, he had no chance of surviving whatsoever.

Only an Epic Set Equipment could increase his survival chances. Only the extremely lucky could find enough Fragmented Legendary items for the task, and he couldn’t afford to rely on luck.

“A main branch?” Cleansing Flame hesitated after hearing Shi Feng’s demand.

As a mere team leader, she didn’t have the authority to make that decision. Heaven’s Blade had only secured one main branch, and if they gave it to Zero Wing, the adventurer team would suffer a huge loss.

Furthermore, protecting the main branch in their possession was the very reason that her commander was struggling so desperately. She would’ve already offered the side branches to appease War Blood otherwise.

However, Cleansing Flame couldn’t deny what Shi Feng had said.

Not only was War Blood Dragonheart Island’s number one adventurer team, but it also had Starlink’s support. No superpower on the island would be willing to offend War Blood for a mere side branch from the Tree of Life.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, I’m afraid I can’t agree to that. I need to discuss the matter with my commander,” Cleansing Flame said after giving the matter some thought. Rather than rejecting Shi Feng’s demand outright, she felt it was wisest to speak with her commander first.

“I understand,” Shi Feng said, not particularly surprised by Cleansing Flame’s response. Cleansing Flame was only a team leader. How could someone of that rank possibly have the authority to make such an important decision?

With Shi Feng’s agreement, Cleansing Flame logged out of God’s Domain to contact her commander offline. The offline messenger was the only way to communicate within Heaven’s Blade now that War Blood had sealed off the Molten Canyon.
