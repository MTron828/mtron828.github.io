Chapter 2657 – Clashing with the Faux Saint Devourer

“It got blocked?”

“How is that possible?! That’s an Advanced Combat Technique used by a Mythic monster!”

Crimson Emperor’s members seated in the Blue Rose Bar’s third floor rubbed their eyes in shock when they saw the pitch-black wall displayed on the Magic Mirror. For a moment, they all thought they were hallucinating.

In terms of Basic Attributes, the Faux Saint Devourer was above average among Mythic monsters of the same level. Combined with Hundred Arms’s Fallen Leaves technique, the power of the Devourer’s attack should be capable of sending even Mythic monsters flying.

Nevertheless, against the pitch-black wall that suddenly appeared, the attack was nothing.

The players standing on the battlefield were similarly stunned by this scene.

“What’s going on?”

“Is that pitch-black wall some kind of Defensive Spell? Isn’t it a little too amazing?”

Everyone was surprised and confused by the pitch-black wall that had suddenly appeared on the battlefield.

Not only did this pitch-black wall block the Faux Saint Devourer’s attack, but it had even split the entire battlefield in half, forcing the majority of the monster army to halt their charge. Now, the Faux Saint monsters could only stand still and quietly look at the pitch-black wall before them.

“This is...a spatial tear!” Illusory Words exclaimed when she saw the pitch-black wall fading out of existence.

“A spatial tear? How is that possible? Even a very powerful attack would, at most, cause a thin tear stretching over a dozen yards. This wall is over a hundred yards long and over 50 yards tall. Who could possibly have such strength?” the fierce man refuted, shaking his head in denial. He felt that Illusory Words’s conjecture was ridiculous.

Everyone in the bar’s third floor was familiar with spatial tears. After all, they would always come across spatial tears when clashing with Tier 4 Mythic monsters.

A spatial tear was the byproduct of an attack carrying too much power for the surrounding space to handle. The surrounding space would destabilize and shatter like broken glass, which was why the shape of spatial tears was generally irregular.

However, the pitch-black wall displayed on the Magic Mirror was incredibly stable. There were no cracks in it at all. It looked like a steel wall that had just fallen out of the sky—incredibly smooth and heavy.

“I guess you’re right. Even that person wouldn’t be capable of such a feat,” Illusory Words said, laughing despite herself. After giving the matter some thought, she agreed with the fierce man.

“Regardless, who saved Purple Eye?” the fierce man wondered as he carefully tracked the pitch-black wall back to its origin. “Setting aside the wall’s defensive capabilities, just the fact that this person saw through the Faux Saint Devourer’s movements is already plenty amazing. I doubt there are more than a handful of people in the entire Silverwing Town who would be a match for this person. Did an old monster belonging to one of Zero Wing’s partners take action?”

The fierce man’s gaze landed on a cloaked man wielding a pitch-black longsword—the origin of the remarkable wall. Although he couldn’t see any information about this cloaked man, his gut told him that this cloaked man possessed astonishing strength definitely at the Domain Realm.

Before the pitch-black wall disappeared completely, the cloaked man vanished from his original location and arrived before the Faux Saint Devourer. He then stopped another spear attack from the Devourer, allowing Purple Eye to put some distance between herself and the Mythic monster.

“Crap! Who is that guy?! He actually managed to block that Faux Saint Devourer’s attack!” Crazed Bull exclaimed, his eyes nearly falling out of their sockets when he saw Shi Feng successfully rescuing Purple Eye.

At this moment, aside from Crazed Bull, even Solid Wind could not help goggling in shock, her mind freezing in disbelief. Previously, she already found Shi Feng’s ability to pin down two Faux Saint Destroyers all by himself astounding. Now, the man had even single-handedly pinned down the Mythic ranked Faux Saint Devourer, which even an expert of Purple Eye’s caliber was no match for.

“Amazing! He’s actually keeping up with that Devourer’s speed! With this, he should have no problems handling the Devourer,” Illusory Words said, her eyes glowing with excitement when she saw the cloaked man deflecting every one of the Faux Saint Devourer’s attacks. “If Silverwing Town has his protection, we should be able to sustain the town for some time and foil Saint’s Hand’s plan to solicit help from the neighboring kingdoms’ powers. That way, Saint’s Hand’s development speed will slow down, and Zero Wing will have some breathing room. If Zero Wing can continue holding out in Star-Moon Kingdom, we’ll have an easier time resisting Starlink in the Dark Night Empire as well.”

“This will only delay the inevitable. That Faux Saint Devourer will grow stronger as more time passes. Its growth speed is also no laughing matter. Not to mention, Saint’s Hand has already informed the various superpowers that anyone that helps Zero Wing will become Saint’s Hand’s enemy,” the fierce man said, shaking his head. “Saint’s Hand has done considerable research into the Faux Saint monsters. In the future, we’ll definitely need Saint’s Hand’s help to deal with the threat of the Faux Saint monsters. This is also why the Guild Leader is having us withdraw completely. The appearance of that mysterious expert won’t change anything. In fact, Saint’s Hand will probably locate the power behind that mysterious expert and give that power a warning.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

...

Aside from Crimson Emperor’s members, the members of various superpowers hidden in Silverwing Town also viewed this situation indifferently.

“Zero Wing sure is lucky. It actually managed to get the help of an old monster.”

“I bet that old monster has yet to receive the news. Otherwise, why would he move to help Zero Wing?”

Although they did not know which superpower’s old monster was helping Zero Wing right now, they knew that this would be the only time this old monster would do so. Afterward, Saint’s Hand would definitely warn the superpower backing this old monster. Once that happened, said superpower would most likely stop assisting Zero Wing in defending the town against the Faux Saint monsters.

Not only was the current era of God’s Domain filled with turmoil, but it was also the era of the Faux Saint monsters.

Faux Saint monsters were a huge headache, even for Super Guilds. Moreover, stopping the spread of these Faux Saint monsters was also impossible.

In the future, any Guild that wished to develop safely in God’s Domain, be it a small Guild or a Super Guild, would have to partner or trade with Saint’s Hand. After all, up to now, no other power had managed to develop a tool that could prevent the Faux Saint monsters from attacking players. In fact, Saint’s Hand even had the means to prevent the Faux Saint monsters from attacking an entire area.

Now that Saint’s Hand was determined to destroy Zero Wing, even the Secret Pavilion would be able to stop it, just like how the Secret Pavilion had failed to stop Saint’s Hand from capturing one of the Star Alliance’s Guild Cities.

Meanwhile, as time passed, due to reinforcements continuously pouring out of Silverwing Town, the patrol army eventually gained the upper hand over the Faux Saint army. In fact, over a thousand Faux Saint Saboteurs had fallen in battle already, which made the Faux Saint Devourer anxious.

In the next moment, the Faux Saint Devourer let loose a deafening roar that echoed throughout the battlefield.

Immediately afterward, the Faux Saint army scattered and fled. As for the Faux Saint Devourer itself, it, too, turned around and ran off.

“Sure enough, it is going to escape.”

“Silverwing Town might’ve survived this time, but let’s see how it’s going to stop the next attack.”

The superpowers hidden within Silverwing Town were not at all surprised when they saw the Faux Saint army retreating. After all, with the Faux Saint Devourer thoroughly suppressed, it was only a matter of time before the Faux Saint army suffered annihilation. However, what made the Faux Saint monsters truly formidable was their ability to grow stronger with each battle they experienced. Even though Silverwing Town had successfully fended off today’s attack, it wouldn’t necessarily be able to repeat the feat.

“Escape?” Shi Feng sneered when he saw the Faux Saint Devourer fleeing. “Do you think you can escape?”

Following which, he took out the Ring of Gospel from his bag and activated Miniature World.
