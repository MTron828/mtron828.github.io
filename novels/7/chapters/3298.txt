Chapter 373 – Great Grandmaster!

Hundred Refinement Building, second-floor training room:

After Shi Feng integrated the Twelve-array Magic World he had used to create his Tier 5 Mana Body during his previous life into his current Mana Body, the Creation Assistance Mode quickly started doing its job.

In less than a minute, a Mana Body that had perfectly integrated with the magic array he provided appeared before his eyes.

…

!!

System: Congratulations! You have successfully constructed a new Mana Body. The constructed Mana Body’s strength is at 182% of your current Mana Body and has reached the Tier 5 standard. The created Mana Body is evaluated to be at the Gold rank. Do you wish to replace your current Mana Body with it and get promoted to Tier 5?

It managed to improve the mana flow to such an extent?

Shi Feng had difficulty keeping his mouth closed when he saw the system-improved Mana Body.

To reach Tier 5, players needed to create a Mana Body that was strong enough to alter their Life Rating to the Tier 5 standard, which was why Tier 5 players were typically much stronger than Tier 4 players. There was a qualitative difference in the Mana Bodies of the two tiers, and the difference was especially stark in the mana condensation aspect.

Meanwhile, out of all the steps players needed to go through to create a Tier 5 Mana Body, the most troublesome step would have to be determining the flow of mana.

Because players would be creating a Mana Body of their own, they would need to construct and integrate a significant number of magic arrays into their existing Mana Body. And as these magic arrays would have varying effects, they would also need varying amounts of mana supplied to them.

If players wanted to ensure all of these magic arrays could function properly and efficiently, they would usually have to invest a lot of time and effort into the endeavor, much more than what they had invested when they were integrating these magic arrays with their existing Mana Body. Players also couldn’t haphazardly decide their Tier 5 Mana Body’s mana flow as there would be a significant difference in the Mana Body’s performance between partial activation and complete activation of the Mana Body’s magic arrays.

So, exactly how one could achieve complete activation was the biggest headache players faced when creating their Tier 5 Mana Body.

However, the Creation Assistance Mode took care of this problem for players. One assisted creation was essentially equivalent to or better than one hundred creation attempts made by players themselves. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the Creation Assistance Mode was divine assistance.

A Legendary Mana Body truly is something. The Twelve-array Magic World is enough to strengthen a Tier 3 Epic Mana Body to the Tier 5 Epic standard, yet it only managed to strengthen my Tier 3 Legendary Mana Body to the Tier 5 Gold standard. It seems I won’t be able to use these magic arrays.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but reveal a wry smile after he was done inspecting the Mana Body presented before him. The Twelve-array Magic World he had used during his previous life was a Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array created by a Saint, and it was the key factor that allowed him to create a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body.

However, the Twelve-array Magic World was evidently lacking for his current needs. Or, more specifically, the Twelve-array Magic World was incapable of condensing mana that was sufficiently dense to effectively strengthen his Tier 3 Legendary Mana Body.

Although it should be possible to improve the Twelve-array Magic World’s effectiveness by restructuring it, even then, it could, at best, leave him with a Tier 5 Epic Mana Body. It was highly unlikely he could achieve a Tier 5 Advanced Epic Mana Body with the Twelve-array Magic World, let alone a Tier 5 Legendary Mana Body.

Going by my current Mana Body’s standard, I’m going to have to strengthen its mana to a solid state at the very least to achieve an Epic rank…

Under the effects of Eternal Energy, Shi Feng quickly understood where the Mana Body was lacking. Meanwhile, upon making this realization, he didn’t know whether he should laugh or cry.

Although he had quickly learned about his Mana Body’s deficiencies, increasing the density of its mana was easier said than done. It was especially so if he wanted to condense it to a solid state. This was no longer something that could be accomplished by a Grandmaster Magic Array. Even Great Grandmaster Magic Arrays might not necessarily be able to accomplish it…

Currently, Shi Feng did not have any Great Grandmaster Mana Gathering Arrays in his possession. In fact, only a handful of such magic arrays existed in the entire Greater God’s Domain, and they were either in the hands of apex powers or upper-ranking hegemonic powers that were capable of contending against apex powers. This was because only powers of such caliber had the strength to get their hands on such magic arrays.

Great Grandmaster Mana Gathering Arrays were incomparably precious, and their rarity rivaled Divine Artifacts. Meanwhile, there were only two methods to obtain these magic arrays. The first method was to have a Great Grandmaster Magician create one, while the second method was to destroy a kingdom based in one of the Twelve Sanctuaries and obtain it from the kingdom’s treasury.

Of the two methods, the first was nothing but a joke.

Firstly, Great Grandmaster Magicians were exceedingly rare in the Greater God’s Domain, and there usually wouldn’t be more than 100 in any era.

Secondly, a Great Grandmaster Magician would need many months to develop even the simplest Great Grandmaster Magic Array. Meanwhile, the complexity of Mana Gathering Arrays was usually significantly higher than that of other magic arrays of the same rank. So, not only would a Great Grandmaster Magician require a significant amount of time to create a Great Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array, but their efforts weren’t even guaranteed to pay off. In fact, their chances of success were unlikely to exceed 30%.

Hence, rather than wait and hope for a Great Grandmaster Magician to succeed, it’d be much quicker to destroy a kingdom in the Twelve Sanctuaries and search for a Great Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array in the kingdom’s treasury.

No, I’m not out of solutions yet!

Thinking up to this point, Shi Feng suddenly came up with an idea to obtain a Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array.

The Ancient Abyssal God’s Legacy!

The Ancient Abyssal God’s mana usage method that was recorded in the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s Abyssal Tower was more profound than even that of Saints. So, it might just be possible to create a Great Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array by referencing the Ancient Abyssal God’s Legacy.

Not to mention, Shi Feng had already reached the limits of a Grandmaster Magician. So long as he could create a Great Grandmaster Magic Array, he could become a Great Grandmaster Magician.

Immediately, Shi Feng started testing his theory by restructuring the magic array in the Ancient Abyssal God’s Legacy, continuously expanding it, and filling in the gaps.

The act of upgrading a magic array that was inherently at the Grandmaster rank to the Great Grandmaster rank was a feat ordinary Great Grandmaster Magicians wouldn’t even dare to think of trying. Under normal circumstances, Shi Feng wouldn’t have thought of doing so, either.

However, Shi Feng currently had the assistance of incredibly dense Eternal Energy. Thanks to this assistance, he had long surpassed the average Great Grandmaster Magician in mana control, mana affinity, and brain activity.

One hour… Three hours… Six hours…

Shi Feng was met with one failure after another as time passed. However, as he continuously summarized and learned from his mistakes, the quality and effectiveness of the Mana Gathering Array he created also grew more and more astonishing.

Originally, the Mana Gathering Array he modified could only barely condense mana into a solid state. It was also only strong enough to be integrated with roughly 1,000 magic arrays. At this standard, it could, at most, be considered a Grandmaster Mana Gathering Array.

However, the magic array quickly reached the Advanced Grandmaster standard, being able to easily condense solid mana. It could also be integrated with over 2,000 other magic arrays.

As expected of an Ancient God’s Legacy. Its mana usage method is a world unto itself. Though, the requirement it has for mana control is also absurdly high. If not for my current environment, I doubt I can even move 2,000 magic arrays with it.

As Shi Feng kept adding more magic arrays to the Mana Gathering Array, the difficulty of maintaining control over all these magic arrays also continuously increased. Even so, he couldn’t help but grow excited since his proficiency at manipulating mana also continuously improved. Meanwhile, the better he got at controlling mana, the more magic arrays he could control simultaneously.

2,600… 2,800… 3,000…

After Shi Feng spent his twentieth hour in the training room, he successfully increased the number of magic arrays he could control to 3,333. At the same time, the sound of a system notification entered his ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have successfully created a Great Grandmaster Magic Array. You have been promoted to a Great Grandmaster Magician. Rewarding Great Grandmaster Emblem, five levels, and 20 Free Legacy Skill Points.

System: Do you wish to make a universal announcement?

TL Notes:

Basically, the following is what I gathered from this chapter-

i) T3 Mana Body (Template) + many magic arrays of varying functions + Mana Gathering Array (“mana flow”/power supply) = T5 Mana Body

ii) Better Mana Gathering Array = more magic arrays = better T5 Mana Body
