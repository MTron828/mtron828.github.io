Chapter 3830 - 904 - Changes to Star Lake City

Star Lake City, Zero Wing Training Center

After his call with Xia Qingying ended, Shi Feng tidied up and went to the combat simulation hall where Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and the other Zero Wing executives usually trained.

Since the major system update, combat simulation halls had become the primary place for players to visit when resting offline. Besides being able to train against simulated experts, players could also recover the Concentration they expended in God’s Domain. Most importantly, players could watch the top experts of their respective Guilds spar.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Before the introduction of Soul Synchronization, the top experts of the various Guilds could be considered elusive creatures in the real world. They typically spent most of their time in God’s Domain, rarely appearing before others. However, following Soul Synchronization’s introduction, even great grandmasters with powerful mental strength had to go offline regularly to rest and recuperate. This situation resulted in the usually unpopular combat simulation halls becoming a gathering place for top experts.

…

The Zero Wing Training Center’s combat simulation hall was an indoor stadium with six floors. The first and centermost floor was a vast open space, the second and third floors comprised small and medium simulation fields, and the fourth to sixth floors held viewing boxes.

The viewing boxes on the fifth and sixth floors were exclusive to the Guild’s core members and executives; normal members could only use the fourth floor’s viewing boxes.

“Those newcomers named Lin Yaoyue and Zhuo Yalin are incredible! They actually lasted ten moves against Big Sis Fire when working together! They can probably rank among the top ten newcomers this time!”

“Indeed. Everyone in the latest batch of newcomers is incredibly strong. Even the Myriad Forest Empire’s Empress Blood Arrow Leroja and the Red Star Kingdom’s Undefeated Battle Maniac Cross have withdrawn from their respective Guilds to join us.”

“We have to work harder. The Guild only has so many simulation fields. Normal members like us might still get to use them now, but as more members move to the Guild’s headquarters, we’ll probably have to rent simulation fields outside to rest.”

The youths gathered in the fourth floor’s general area sighed as they watched the physical combat on the first floor. A sense of urgency welled up in their hearts when they considered Zero Wing’s rapid growth.

Before Zero Wing’s fame extended beyond Star Lake City, only some people from the city applied to join the Guild. However, after Zero Wing became famous, geniuses from Star Lake City and experts from neighboring mobile cities and the Starlight Realm began to flock to the Guild.

While Zero Wing’s youths were talking, a young man with black hair wearing a white sweatshirt walked past the crowd in the fourth floor’s general area and entered the fifth floor.

“The fifth floor?”

“Who is that person? Since he can enter the fifth floor, he should be a core member at the minimum, but why haven’t I seen him before?”

“He’s probably another one of those peerless geniuses who joined our Guild. I really envy these people. They become core members as soon as they join. In contrast, normal members like us have to undergo many rigorous tests to get promoted. We also have to wait in line to use simulation fields.”

“That’s only the tip of the iceberg. I heard that core members get to spar with the Vice Guild Leaders. Many heirs of corporations have offered our two Vice Guild Leaders millions of Star Coins to host a lesson. Even then, the Vice Guild Leaders rejected all such offers.”

“I heard that, too! If I could spar against the two Vice Guild Leaders, I can die without regrets!”

Envy colored the eyes of the youths in the fourth-floor general area as they watched the black-haired young man walk up to the fifth floor. This situation, in turn, stunned the black-haired young man.

Millions of Star Coins to host a lesson?

 Shi Feng was astonished when he overheard the discussion of the Zero Wing members on the fourth floor. He hadn’t expected Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow to become so popular in Star Lake City. Even the Guild Leaders of hegemonic powers would rarely receive such treatment from the younger generation of corporations.

…

While marveling at the changes in Star Lake City, Shi Feng arrived at a viewing box on the sixth floor.

“Guild Leader, I’ve finished sorting out all of Zero Wing’s profits like you asked,” Hidden Soul reported after Shi Feng entered the viewing box. She handed him an electronic tablet and stated proudly, “After deducting the funds needed for the Guild’s expansion, Shadowring Town’s maintenance, and repaying the money you owe, the Guild has 1.35 million Eternal Gold Coins left on its books.”

“That much?!” Shi Feng was shocked.

Although he had long since known that Shadowring Town would be incredibly profitable after the Tower of the Abyss’s addition, he hadn’t expected it to be this profitable. It should be known that Zero Wing owed 5.55 million Eternal Gold to the Seven Luminaries Alliance and 0.7 million Eternal Gold to Luminous Sky City. Furthermore, the current Eternal Realm’s player population was still relatively low, and it was challenging for players to reach Shadowring Town.

Nevertheless, Zero Wing still had 1.35 million Eternal Gold remaining after repaying all its debts and covering its operational costs!

Aside from apex powers, no other power could have such wealth in the current Eternal Realm. Even pseudo-apex powers would be fortunate to have half a million Eternal Gold right now.

“If you urgently need Eternal Coins, tomorrow is the lease renewal date for Shadowring Town’s shops. We should be able to get another 400,000 Eternal Gold,” Hidden Soul said seriously.

“That won’t be necessary,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “Register these Eternal Coins for me at the God’s Domain Association. I need to use the money today.”

The God’s Domain Association was the Greater World’s largest and most mysterious organization. Not only was it present in all mobile cities in the Greater World, but it also offered insurance for player transactions made outside of God’s Domain. However, this service came at a hefty price, with the God’s Domain Association charging anywhere from 10 million to over 100 million Star Coins to insure each transaction. It was not a service the average player could afford.

“Okay. I’ll have someone do it right away. It should take two hours at most,” Hidden Soul said, nodding. Then, she hesitantly continued, “By the way, Guild Leader, while you were out of reach, many pseudo-apex powers and some hidden pseudo-apex powers contacted me and Snow.”

“Contacted you two? What did they want?” Shi Feng asked calmly.

“All these pseudo-apex powers were powers with few to no members present in the Eternal Realm during its inception. Now that an entrance has been discovered, these powers are thinking of expanding into the Eternal Realm. However, they won’t have any advantage over other pseudo-apex powers if they enter the Eternal Realm now, so they plan to acquire Zero Wing to remedy that problem,” Hidden Soul said worriedly.

“Acquire us?” Shi Feng chuckled. “How much are they offering?”
