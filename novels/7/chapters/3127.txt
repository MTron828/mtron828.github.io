Chapter 202 – Upgraded Slumber City

Stratified Abyssal Realm, Slumber City:

When Shi Feng logged back into the game, he found that he had appeared in a different location than when he had logged out of the game. Specifically, he had appeared in Slumber City’s central plaza.

“What’s going on?!”

“Is this really Slumber City’s central plaza?”

The players that had appeared in the central plaza at this time were stunned by the scene in front of them.

Currently, suspended in the middle of the central plaza that covered a one-kilometer radius was a gigantic sphere of water. The water sphere itself had a radius of 400 meters. So long as one focused one’s senses on this water sphere, one would realize that this sphere wasn’t made out of ordinary water. Instead, it was made of Mana that had condensed into a liquid state.

Meanwhile, the presence of this sphere of Liquid Mana had increased the density of the ambient Mana in the plaza. This, in turn, allowed everyone to experience an indescribably comfortable and refreshing feeling. It felt as if they had just awoken from a deep slumber.

Moreover, the closer one stood to the Mana sphere, the denser the Mana one could enjoy, and the better one’s state would become.

An Elven Holy Spring! Isn’t this too much of an upgrade?!

?Shi Feng was also a little stunned when he saw the large sphere of Liquid Mana in the middle of the plaza.

Native players of this Stratified Abyssal Realm might be unfamiliar with this Mana sphere, but Shi Feng was someone who had traveled around the Greater God’s Domain for many years. Hence, he instantly recognized the identity of this Mana sphere.

The Elven Holy Spring!

Constructions in God’s Domain were typically divided into three ranks: Basic, Advanced, and Peak. Peak Constructions were generally considered the upper limit of what players could construct in a settlement. Even if a settlement reached the standard of a Holy City, without the necessary construction designs, players could only construct standardized Peak Constructions in it.

However, there existed constructions beyond the Peak rank that wielded unbelievable effects in the Greater God’s Domain. These constructions were labeled as Extraordinary Constructions, and they were created using technology that had been lost since the primordial era.

The Elven Holy Spring was one of these Extraordinary Constructions. It was an incredibly rare construction, even in the Greater God’s Domain.

Any city that had an Elven Holy Spring could be regarded as a gathering place for Mana since the Holy Spring would elevate the city’s Mana density infinitely close to a liquid state. At the heart of the Holy Spring, Mana would even remain in a liquid state.

Meanwhile, players standing near the Elven Holy Spring’s core would have their Mana affinity increased. This, in turn, allowed them an easier time improving their Skill and Spell Completion Rates. This feature was so valuable that even Tier 6 God-ranked experts were willing to pay an exorbitant price to practice their Tier 6 Skills and Spells near an Elven Holy Spring.

Moreover, an Elven Holy Spring wasn’t just helpful in developing players’ Skill and Spell Completion Rates. When present in an environment rich in Mana, players would also have a significantly easier time improving their combat standards and combat techniques. For this reason, Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts in the Greater God’s Domain would typically try to buy private housing in cities rich in Mana to use as their home base.

However, most of the Elven Holy Springs that existed in the Greater God’s Domain were in the hands of the various hegemonic powers and apex powers. Meanwhile, these powers treated the Holy Spring as a priceless treasure, and they would never allow outsiders to enjoy the benefits of their Holy Spring. At most, they would only allow outsiders to tour the city housing their Holy Spring.

Yet, now, an Elven Holy Spring had appeared in an NPC City inside a Stratified Abyssal Realm. This was simply unbelievable.

While Shi Feng was feeling shocked by the Elven Holy Spring’s appearance, a commotion came from the players who tried to approach the Holy Spring.

“What’s going on? Why do I have to wait until there are fewer than 1,000 people in the area to move closer? I even have to maintain my position for ten minutes before I can advance? But why can some people already get within 300 meters of the sphere?”

“The 300-meter mark just so happens to be where the Mana starts to transition into a liquid state. Why can only those few people get to enjoy it?”

“I know those people. Every one of them is an Upper-class Noble. It seems that if you want to enjoy the environment inside the 300-meter zone, you’ll either need to have a certain degree of status or ensure that there are no more than 1,000 people in the 300- to 500-meter zone. Did you guys not notice your area status? It shows that the area we’re currently in isn’t a safe zone. We can fight without getting punished by the city in here.”

“That’s not all. I might be inside the 300-meter zone, but if I want to enter the 100-meter zone, I’ll need to make sure that there are only 100 people left within the 200-meter zone. Moreover, I can only stay inside this zone for six hours. Afterward, I’ll get forcibly sent out of the 300-meter zone. It seems even Upper-class Nobles won’t get to enjoy this environment all the time.”

“This is great! I won’t have to worry about having too much competition now! I’m definitely getting myself a spot in the 100-meter zone!”

Suddenly, the players in the 300- to 500-meter zone began tearing at each other’s necks in an attempt to reduce their numbers to 1,000. The intensity of the fighting was much greater than even a fight between the peak powers of Slumber City.

“Vice Guild Leader, should we join in the fight?” Rain Song asked as she eagerly looked to Crimson Heart.

“It won’t hurt to try,” Crimson Heart said, nodding.

Aside from Hundred Flower Palace’s members, Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow, and the others also got the urge to join in on the action taking place near the Holy Elven Spring. However, unlike Slumber City’s native players, they weren’t doing so to enjoy the Holy Spring’s Mana environment. Instead, they wanted to use this opportunity to clash against the many third-floor experts here. If they could fight against all of these powerful experts in such a Mana-rich environment, they’d have a much easier time improving their combat standards.

The only worry was the EXP they would lose should they die.

Unlike Hidden Soul and the others, Shi Feng’s attention quickly shifted away from the Elven Holy Spring to a 400-meter-tall tower situated some distance away from the plaza. Currently, he could see an endless stream of Mana flowing out from the void and gathering around the tower, causing space and time around the tower to become distorted.

The Matrix Tower!

This was a construction unique to Slumber City. It was also the only construction that produced the Hypersensitivity Potion.

After Slumber City had gotten promoted, the Matrix Tower had also undergone a complete makeover. Before the city’s promotion, the tower only measured up to 100 meters in height. The range of its Mana absorption also only extended to the city’s surroundings. Now, though, the Matrix Tower was attracting Mana straight from the void. The large amount of Mana it attracted had even distorted space and time around it. This was a massive transformation.

Let’s hope there’s a change in the production rate.

After instructing Blackie and the others to investigate the latest changes to Slumber City, Shi Feng promptly made his way to the Matrix Tower.

According to Echoing Judgment, the Matrix Tower only produced 7,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potion each month. Out of these 7,000 bottles, each Vice City Lord could exchange up to 500 bottles using Dark Crystals. Each of the top five contributing powers of Slumber City could also exchange for 500 bottles, while powers ranked between sixth and tenth could exchange up to 100 bottles each, and powers ranked between eleventh and thirtieth could exchange for 50 bottles each.

Excluding Solitary Soul, Slumber City had three Vice City Lords previously. As a result, 5,500 out of the 7,000 bottles of Hypersensitivity Potion the Matrix Tower produced each month would be assigned ownership as soon as they were produced. As for the remaining 1,500 bottles, they would be auctioned to Slumber City’s players for Dark Crystals. It went without saying that such a small amount wasn’t enough to satisfy the demands of Slumber City’s hundreds of millions of players in Slumber City and thousands of player powers.

If someone wished to acquire a large amount of Hypersensitivity Potions, the most reliable and cheapest way to do so was through the Vice City Lords and the top five contributing powers.

When Shi Feng arrived at the Matrix Tower, the tower’s lobby was already crowded with the executives of Slumber City’s various powers. Every one of these executives had gathered in front of the exchange counter, their expressions ranging from joyful to worry.
