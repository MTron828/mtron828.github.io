Chapter 324 - Times Have Changed

So, it’s him. After not seeing him for some time, his techniques and equipment have improved quite a lot. No wonder he could get so close to me before my senses picked up on him. Absolute Heaven had left a deep impression on Shi Feng.

During the time Shi Feng had searched for the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, this expert Assassin had very nearly killed him. Afterward, Absolute Heaven had ambushed him again when he led Blackie and Lonely Snow to level up. At that time, Shi Feng’s life had hung on by a thread.

Since Shi Feng started playing God’s Domain in this life, although he had made plenty of enemies, Absolute Heaven was the only person who had almost taken his life.

After such a long time, Absolute Heaven would definitely be much stronger now that he had accustomed himself with the combat style of God’s Domain. If Absolute Heaven had not been careless and underestimated Black Flame, Shi Feng’s alternate identity, by not concealing his killing intent, Absolute Heaven might have successfully ambushed Shi Feng.

“Now that I know you’re there, you aren’t going to escape?” Shi Feng revealed a calm smile as he turned to Absolute Heaven.

“Escape?” Absolute Heaven revealed a hint of arrogance on his chilling face. “I admit that you’re strong. It is as expected of the Guild Leader of Zero Wing, Black Flame. According to my estimation, your strength should be on par with Ye Feng. Last time, Ye Feng only managed to kill me because of my own impatience. It was my mistake to use all of my skills on Ye Feng so early in the fight. Otherwise, with his strength, he could not even dream of killing me. Now, although I have revealed myself, do you really think that you can kill me while I still possess all of my skills?”

“Indeed, it is as you say. Unless all of your skills are on Cooldown, it will not be easy to kill a top-tier Assassin like yourself.” Shi Feng acknowledged Absolute Heaven’s power. However, times had changed. Although Absolute Heaven had improved, Shi Feng had also raised his strength. “Since you’re so confident, why don’t we make a bet?”

“A bet? Do you think that you can fool me? Originally, I intended to kill you today to show Ye Feng that I, Absolute Heaven, have returned. Since I can’t kill you, you can tell Ye Feng this; when I, Absolute Heaven, wish to kill someone, that person will definitely die!” Absolute Heaven laughed coldly. He then turned around to leave.

“If you want me to pass your message on, sure. However, the condition is that you need to escape.” Shi Feng activated the Seven Luminaries Ring, using the Aura of Time skill, Absolute Time. He instantly charged at Absolute Heaven.

[Absolute Time]

Prevents enemies within a range of 50*50 yards from using any skills or tools for 20 seconds.

With this skill activated, all of Absolute Heaven’s skills were in a similar state as a forced Cooldown. Meanwhile, an Assassin that could not use skills was like a tiger without claws or fangs.

“You think I can’t escape?”

Absolute Heaven smiled confidently in reply to Shi Feng’s taunt. He then tried to use Blind on his opponent. If he could do so, he could escape from this place easily.

However, Absolute Heaven immediately discovered that he could not use any of his skills. Suddenly, he started to panic. Nobody understood better than Absolute Heaven just how fragile an Assassin was without his skills.

However, Absolute Heaven was no ordinary player. He immediately calmed himself, turning around to flee.

Absolute Heaven quickly concluded that such a powerful skill had to have a limited duration; it was impossible for the effect to last indefinitely. As long as he could drag the fight out until the duration of this effect was over, he could fly freely like a bird.

At this moment, however, Shi Feng had already appeared at Absolute Heaven’s back after using Silent Steps, not giving Absolute Heaven an opportunity to run. Soundlessly, Shi Feng slashed the Abyssal Blade at Assassin. Absolute Heaven responded swiftly and used his dagger to meet Shi Feng’s sword.

When the silvery gray Abyssal Blade collided with Absolute Heaven’s dagger, he felt an immense pressure flowing from his dagger to his hand. That pressure then suppressed his entire body, forcing Absolute Heaven to kneel on the ground involuntarily.

Such power...as expected from the person who killed Ming Sha! Absolute Heaven silently clicked his tongue. If he had not personally experienced Black Flame’s might, he would never have imagined that Black Flame’s strength was actually on par with a Boss monster. At this moment, Absolute Heaven finally realized why a great expert like Ming Sha had been forced into a constant retreat and could retaliate against Black Flame.

Shi Feng brandished his sword over ten times repeatedly; each slash was as abrupt as a thunderbolt and as heavy as a mountain. Faced with this brutal assault, Absolute Heaven had no other choice but to block as many attacks as he could. However, although Absolute Heaven could reduce the damage he received by blocking with his dagger, his HP still decreased, frustrating him greatly.

Absolute Heaven inwardly cursed Shi Feng for being a despicable and shameless bastard. Shi Feng actually used force to suppress him. Shi Feng had not used any techniques and simply relied on brute force to brandish his sword. Shi Feng’s way of battle, which traded a life for a life, prevented Absolute Heaven from displaying any of his techniques. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

If Absolute Heaven could use his skills, he could easily escape his current predicament. Unfortunately, none of his skills would work. Despite being a powerhouse, Absolute Heaven felt powerless.

Just as Shi Feng was about to send Absolute Heaven to his death with a bombardment of attacks, Absolute Heaven suddenly felt that this situation was extremely familiar.

It was just like when he had ambushed Ye Feng. Back then, he had used a Magic Scroll to seal all of Ye Feng’s skills and had even frozen his movement, turning Ye Feng into a fangless tiger. At that time, Ye Feng could only escape and had not dared confront him head-on.

Meanwhile, his current situation was almost exactly the same as the last time he encountered Ye Feng. Only, this time, the roles were reversed.

If he had known Black Flame possessed such a skill, he would never have closed in on Black Flame. Worse, he had even wasted time by chatting with his enemy, giving Black Flame ample time to set a trap for him. He had practically sought out his own death.

Hah... It seems that I’m really going to die this time. With only a thread of his HP remaining, Absolute Heaven could already see his demise. He was currently a Red Name. If he died, he would lose all of his equipment. His level would also plummet. At that time, he would no longer have the ability to exact revenge on Ye Feng.

However, just as the Abyssal Blade was about to collide with Absolute Heaven’s body, it suddenly froze in mid-air.

“What? You’re not gonna kill me? If you wait until I can use my skills again, you won’t be able to kill me.” Absolute Heaven laughed coldly as he watched Shi Feng curiously.

“As I said before, I want to make a bet with you, but you thought that I only said those words to fool you and kill you. Now that you only have a thread of your HP remaining, it will only take me a casual wave to destroy your weapon, equipment, and level. However, I’ll repeat my offer. Are you interested in placing a bet?” Shi Feng asked, smiling as he returned the Abyssal Blade to its sheath.

“It seems that you’re really not trying to cheat me. Then was the fight your way of proving that you wish not to kill me, but to make a bet instead?” Absolute Heaven asked, greatly confused by Shi Feng’s actions. He could not figure out just what was going through Shi Feng’s mind.

“Of course. Otherwise, why do you think I would even bother fighting you? Does it look like I have too much time on my hands?” Shi Feng laughed bitterly.

Absolute Heaven was suddenly rendered speechless.

“What? You still don’t believe me?” Shi Feng’s expression turned cold,

“No, no! I believe you! Tell me, then. What do you want to bet?” At this moment, Absolute Heaven grew interested in the bet Shi Feng proposed.

“Bet your life!” Shi Feng said straightforwardly.

“Bet my life? Isn’t my life already in your hands?!” Absolute Heaven nearly cursed at Shi Feng.

Shi Feng shook his head, then slowly, he said, “You previously mentioned that, as long as you can use your skills, you can escape from me easily. Isn’t that right?”

“That’s right!” Absolute Heaven answered without hesitation.

Although Absolute Heaven had already witnessed Shi Feng’s frightening strength, he was still confident that he could flee from this battle.

“Simply put, I don’t believe you. So, let’s make a bet. While you can fully utilize all of your skills, we’ll see whether or not you can escape. What do you think?” Shi Feng asked with a smile.
