Chapter 189 - Berserked Market

Shortly after Shi Feng logged off...

The post Shi Feng had left on the forums became instantly popular.

One view became ten; ten became a hundred. Players had strong gossiping hearts, so they would not miss out on this good show.

Within a short twenty minutes, almost all players within the White River City region had discovered this matter.

The Guilds that had demanded the leveling strategy from Shi Feng were all enraged.

“Crap! Find all of the information about that little bastard for me! Not only am I going to kill him back to Level 0, but I’m also going to kill all his friends back to Level 0! Since he dares humiliate Ghost Wheel, he can forget thinking of mingling in God’s Domain any longer!” Sleeping Bones, the Guild Leader of Ghost Wheel, was furious after listening to his subordinate’s report. Although Ghost Wheel was an unrated Guild, they were still a large Guild with over five thousand members. Yet, a lone, independent player looked down on them. How were they supposed to show their faces in public in the future if they took this lying down?

“Leader, I’ve already investigated him,” an Elementalist said.

“Speak! Since he dares look down on Ghost Wheel, I can’t retain the name ‘Sleeping Bones’ if I don’t kill all of his friends back to Level 0!” Sleeping Bones bellowed.

“That Ye Feng is an independent player, and I’ve confirmed that he has eight team members. Aside from them, Ye Feng also has a good relationship with Stabbing Heart, the Vice-Leader of the Assassin’s Alliance. Rumor also has it that he has a very close relationship with the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow, as well” that Elementalist answered.

“......” Sleeping Bones suddenly fell silent.

Was this a joke? If they dared to actually kill Stabbing Heart of Assassin’s Alliance and Gentle Snow of Ouroboros, then the day they entered White River City would be the day Ghost Wheel disbanded.

“Forget it! I, Sleeping Bones, am a magnanimous person! We’ll just stick to killing Ye Feng and his teammates, lest we want other people to start gossiping about us!”

“Roger! Guild Leader is the wisest!”

At the same time, the other Guilds that did not have a clear understanding of Shi Feng began their investigations about him. They were prepared to properly deal with him the moment they entered White River City.

Meanwhile, on the forums, players were currently discussing this incident. They all felt that White River City’s battle of the century was about to begin. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“This fellow brother Ye Feng simply too awesome! Isn’t he trying to oppose those various Guilds?”

“He is just overestimating himself. Who does he think he is? When these Guilds enter White River City, it will take no effort for them to destroy him.”

“What do you know? Ye Feng is a god-ranked expert! Previously, he turned Martial Union upside down, while Martial Union could do nothing against him. They were even chased out of Red Leaf Town. Now, Ye Feng is even facing off against so many strong powers. He is truly my generation’s role model!”

“What’s so amazing about that? I could do it as well! Don’t forget, that incident happened in a town. The various large Guilds’ strength scattered; how many members could they possibly have in a single town? It was only natural that they were defeated!”

There were many players browsing the forums. However, a majority of them did not feel optimistic about Shi Feng’s chances. They were especially confused about Shi Feng’s actions.

Just how stupid could Shi Feng be, to actually dare taunt the Guilds? Was he not afraid of these Guilds taking revenge and killing him back to Level 0?

Along with the growing intensity of the discussions, the so-called god-ranked expert had also become a courageous fool.

Many started ridiculing Shi Feng.

Just when the forums reached their zenith, Shi Feng’s White River City Guidebook post revealed itself the moment the preset time arrived. The post’s appearance caused a massive ripple effect.

The White River City Guidebook was undeniably what various large Guilds needed the most right now. A few Level 9 independent players also urgently needed it. If these players had the White River City Guidebook, they would not have to spend a large amount of time exploring the city. They only needed to refer to the guidebook to learn what they needed to know.

Compared to the heavenly price of ten billion for a single leveling strategy, using 20,000 Credits to purchase a luxury version of the White River City Guidebook was unquestionably a lot cheaper; it was practically the price of cabbage. Also, the cheaper, simplified version only sold for 300 Credits. These various Guilds and players could easily accept that price.

However, afraid of Shi Feng’s trickery, a large majority of the Guilds chose to purchase the simplified guidebook, taking a look at it before making further decisions.

After all, they could afford a loss of 300 Credits.

As for the players that wished to develop themselves in God’s Domain, they all grew extremely curious about White River City, a fascinating city. They wished to experience it in advance, so many players had gnashed their teeth as they bought the simplified guidebook.

Within half an hour, the simplified version of the White River City Guidebook was like a best-selling novel. Sales of the guidebook continuously increased, and before anyone knew it, over 5,000 copies had already sold.

In other words, Shi Feng had earned 1.5 million Credits within this short time. Many players had discovered business opportunities from this.

Players who originally worried about whether or not they could make money in God’s Domain relaxed at this sight. After all, Shi Feng was their best example. As long as they could grasp ahold of the opportunity, becoming rich in a single night was not just a dream; it was just like how Shi Feng became the first person to enter White River City.

Immediately, plenty of players outside of the White River City region grew excited. If they too could be the first to enter their own respective cities and write a city guidebook, couldn’t they also become rich?

This thought inspired desperation in all of the players in God’s Domain. As if possessed by the devil, they all started rushing to level up. They all wished to become the first person to enter their respective cities, making a huge profit and becoming rich overnight.

Meanwhile, in the trade market of the entire Star-Moon Kingdom, the popularity of Whetstones had instantly soared. As long as a forger had at least a 30% success rate of crafting Whetstones, the various large guilds would instantly target them. The Guilds used all sorts of methods to recruit these forgers, continuously raising the standard of treatment. As a result, these forgers earned salaries comparable to the white-collar workers in the big cities.

Such a result inspired other players to become forgers. However, forging materials were utterly necessary if one wanted to hone their forging skill. Like adding fuel to a fire, this new situation instantly ignited a blazing inferno that raged through all of the Star Moon Kingdom.

The prices of forging materials soared, again and again, madly increasing the price of Hard Stones as well.

By the time Shi Feng entered God’s Domain that night, a stack of 20 Hard Stones already sold for a sky-high price of 8 Silver Coins. However, the supply could not keep up with the demand. Furthermore, even the most common Bronze Ore sold for 15 Silver Coins per stack, with 200 per stack.

“Hahaha! Luck can’t be stopped once it comes! I would never have thought that the White River City Guidebook would so fiercely drive the materials market!” Shi Feng rejoiced the moment he logged in.

During the day, aside from training his body, Shi Feng had gone to the city center to look for suitable locations to start up his Workshop. His requirements were very simple; he wanted a good environment surrounding the office building.

After surveying over ten locations, Shi Feng finally found a relatively pleasing office building. It was located in the city center. Moreover, it was an entire floor being sold. The office floor had a wide space of 5,000 square-meters, so it was extremely spacious. There would be no problems turning it into an office for several hundred people. Moreover, the surrounding environment and traffic were convenient. However, the most important factor was that the office was relatively close to Big Dipper, the best gym in Jin Hai City.

The owner of the office floor only sold it to make up for issues surfacing with his business. Otherwise, he would not bear parting with such an amazing location.

However, that person had set a price of 60 million Credits for the place, with each square meter priced at 12,000 Credits. Although such a price was not considered expensive in the city center, it was not cheap either. Shi Feng only had somewhere over 20 million Credits stored in his bank right now. He still needed that money for the Fellowship Party hosted by his school. In the end, Shi Feng could only ask the owner for fifteen days to think it over.

Shi Feng never imagined that he would be given a fright the moment he returned to God’s Domain. When he saw the sales of the White River City Guidebook, he even thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.
