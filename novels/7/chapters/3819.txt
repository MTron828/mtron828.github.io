Chapter 894 – Primordial Dragonoid’s Might

“He wants to see what the pseudo-apex powers are made of? This guy must be insane!”

“He is brazen, but he does have the strength to back his arrogance. He might have hidden his personal information, but I still gleaned some using my Peak Identification Skill. Surprisingly, he is Level 240. He is also fully equipped with Level 240 Taboo Legendary Equipment. Not even the various pseudo-apex powers can necessarily come up with a full set of Level 240 Taboo Legendary Equipment.”

“Level 240? Could he be the old monster of a major power?”

When the resisting players in the plaza saw Kowloon Demon appear at the forefront of the battlefield, they stopped what they were doing to stare at and discuss Kowloon Demon, a hint of expectation brightening their eyes.

A Level 240 expert was undoubtedly among the highest-level players in the Greater God’s Domain. Kowloon Demon was even fully equipped with Level 240 Taboo Legendary Equipment. If he fought seriously, the magic barriers set up by the ten pseudo-apex powers would crumble in no time. If the magic barriers disappeared, everyone would have a chance to escape.

No wonder he’s so bold. When the Level 237 Berserker representing the Dragon God Palace saw through Kowloon Demon’s level and equipment standard, he immediately scrutinized the other party seriously. After all, even in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, few individuals could match Kowloon Demon’s level and equipment standard. “Your level and equipment are not attainable by independent players. May I know which power you are from?”

The other leaders selected to lead the ten pseudo-apex powers’ forces similarly scrutinized Kowloon Demon in silence, none willing to make the first move.

Suddenly, silence enveloped the plaza.

“Dammit! Aren’t these pseudo-apex powers being too cautious?!” a Level 229 Cleric exclaimed out of anxiety when he saw the passivity of the ten pseudo-apex powers’ forces.

“The leaders of these powers are all cunning people. They won’t act rashly when dealing with experts of such caliber. The average power can’t produce such experts, so this guy is likely the executive of a pseudo-apex power,” a middle-aged Level 230 Berserker said, wearing a helpless expression as he looked at the pseudo-apex powers’ silent leaders. “If that guy is from a pseudo-apex power, the ten pseudo-apex powers won’t dare to kill him and risk thoroughly offending that power. Although the ten pseudo-apex powers have entered an alliance, they still can’t afford to have a vengeful pseudo-apex power ambushing their core combatants all the time.”

“Is this the end for us?” the Level 229 Cleric said bitterly. He had thought the Flame Dragon God’s Nest was his ticket to success. In a way, his assumption wasn’t wrong, as his level had skyrocketed since he had entered the secret land. Now, he was only one level short of qualifying for an executive position in the various powers. However, he hadn’t expected to get dragged into this catastrophe.

“That’s not necessarily true,” the middle-aged Berserker said, gazing at Kowloon Demon expectantly. “So long as that guy doesn’t come from a pseudo-apex power, we can still escape!”

If Kowloon Demon was not from a pseudo-apex power, the ten pseudo-apex powers would have to take action to maintain their reputation. After all, over 20 conglomerates were watching the situation. If the ten pseudo-apex powers conceded to a player not from a pseudo-apex power, the conglomerates involved in this incident would definitely strive to secure more benefits for themselves.

…

Inside the Advanced Tent hosting the pseudo-apex powers’ core executives…

“How surprising! This person is not only Level 240 but also has an aura comparable to yours, old commander,” South Lake exclaimed via party chat as he scrutinized Kowloon Demon through his Magic Mirror. “But I don’t recall hearing about such a person in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Could he be the expert of a foreign pseudo-apex power?”

Even among apex powers, Level 240 players were scarce. They were even rarer among pseudo-apex powers. Their respective powers typically treated them like treasures, never mobilizing them unless absolutely necessary.

“That’s likely the case. As far as I know, no such person exists among the other powers in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary,” Apocalypse said, stroking his beard as he looked at Kowloon Demon vigilantly.

“The heavens are truly in our favor!” South Lake exclaimed joyfully. “Although I don’t know which power this person is from, it doesn’t matter as long as he is from a pseudo-apex power. Ember Dragon will have trouble proceeding with his plan.”

No pseudo-apex power in the Greater God’s Domain was a pushover. If anyone dared to kill a pseudo-apex power’s Level 240 expert, that power would retaliate in full force. The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s ten pseudo-apex powers were only in a temporary alliance. If only the power directly responsible for killing Kowloon Demon suffered retaliation, the rest of them would most certainly stand by and do nothing.

“I doubt Ember Dragon will dare to take action,” Apocalypse said after analyzing the situation. “While he might be the Dragon God Palace’s First Vice Guild Leader, he has already exhausted his authority to wage war against us. He can’t afford to offend another pseudo-apex power while he is still fighting us.”

As South Lake and Apocalypse conversed, Ember Dragon revealed an ugly expression. He had not expected a lunatic like Kowloon Demon to come forward and disrupt his plans.

While the other pseudo-apex powers hesitated to voice their opinions, their Magic Mirrors suddenly showed Kowloon Demon speaking.

“Dragon’s Crown,” Kowloon Demon answered without reservation. Then, he eagerly added, “But you shouldn’t have heard of it before. Can we start fighting now if you have nothing else to say?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Dragon’s Crown?” The Level 237 Berserker from the Dragon God Palace confronting Kowloon Demon was visibly stunned. As far as he could recall, no pseudo-apex power in the Greater God’s Domain went by the name of Dragon’s Crown.

“He’s not from a pseudo-apex power?” South Lake’s expression instantly turned ugly at Kowloon Demon’s answer.

“So, he’s just an expert from a no-name power? No wonder he doesn’t have any Divine Artifacts! How audacious of him to stand against us!” Ember Dragon laughed as he looked at the Magic Mirror before him. “Relay my command! Kill this person and all those who dare stand against us!”

None of the other pseudo-apex powers’ representatives objected to Ember Dragon’s unilateral decision. Since Kowloon Demon wasn’t from a pseudo-apex power, they had no concerns about killing him, so they naturally didn’t need to stop Ember Dragon. After all, Kowloon Demon was merely a Level 240 expert without any Divine Artifacts.

…

Central Plaza:

Dragon’s Crown? When Red Frost heard the cloaked Kowloon Demon’s words, her brain seized up momentarily. How can someone from Dragon’s Crown be here?

Amidst Red Frost’s confusion, the ten pseudo-apex powers’ experts went into action.

“Since you are not from a pseudo-apex power, let me impart a truth to you today,” the Level 237 Berserker from the Dragon God Palace said as he raised his hand. Suddenly, the Hephaestus’s Flame behind him flared up, transforming into a thousand-meter-tall dragon that lunged at Kowloon Demon. “The consequence for provoking a pseudo-apex power is death!”

When the independent players in the plaza saw the Hephaestus’s Flame-turned-dragon, despair overwhelmed them.

Hephaestus’s Flame could exhibit the power of a Divine Artifact’s Profound Skill exerted to 100% potential. When manipulated by over a dozen Level 235-plus experts, it could fight even a Level 240 expert equipped with multiple Divine Artifacts head-on. A Level 240 player without Divine Artifacts would face certain death against it, as would the other independent players in the plaza.

“Come!”

When Kowloon Demon saw the incoming Hephaestus’s Flame, he drew and brandished his four sabers, creating a dense web of saber lights before anyone could react. Immediately afterward, the Hephaestus’s Flame-turned-dragon shredded into countless segments and dissipated.
