Chapter 848 – Holy Dragon Spear’s Little Monster?

“Do you know that Swordsman?”

Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf couldn’t help but turn to Shi Feng in astonishment when they overheard his mutterings.

“Of course. She’s my friend,” Shi Feng said, puzzled by Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf’s reaction. “Why? Do you bear a grudge against her?”

“Nothing to that extent,” Xiao Yilong said, shaking his head. Then, while watching the two eye-catching elves enter the Battle Arena, he added tentatively, “I just know that her origins are extraordinary and that she is a ruthless person.”

“Extraordinary origins?” Shi Feng grew even more confused.

Shi Feng knew the origins of the woman named Laura Crader very well. After all, he was the one who had brought Laura out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

However, after the explosion in the World Passage, Shi Feng had never seen Laura again. Although he had scoured the Eternal Realm and tasked Fervent Samsara’s subordinates with looking into Laura’s whereabouts after they garrisoned Gazing Moon City, nothing had turned up.

Originally, Shi Feng had already thought of giving up his search. He hadn’t expected to encounter Laura in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. He also never imagined Laura could have reached Level 221 already. Her leveling speed was simply phenomenal. Additionally, her aura was starkly different; she now gave off the feeling of an unsheathed blade. For a moment, Shi Feng had even wondered if he was looking at someone else.

“That woman joined Holy Dragon Spear under the Great Commander’s recommendation,” Xiao Yilong said in a hushed tone after checking his surroundings. “When she first arrived, she hadn’t even reached Level 160. Yet, the Great Commander granted her the position of Honorary Elder, putting her status just below his in the adventurer team. He even assigned her to be Heiser’s instructor later on.

“Initially, the little monster was very dissatisfied by the decision. However, she somehow convinced Heiser to become her student in just half a day. Back then, that little monster was a brat who behaved as she wanted in front of anyone. Not even the Great Commander could do anything about her. Yet, that woman managed to tame that little monster…”

“Heiser? Little monster?” Recalling the elf with blond, curly hair, Shi Feng asked, “Are you referring to that elven Mage God from just now?”

“Yes,” Xiao Yilong said, sighing helplessly. “She is Heiser, the Divine Songstress. She is our adventurer team’s strongest chosen one and Red Frost’s strongest opponent in today’s competition.”

Divine Songstress Heiser? Shi Feng was again puzzled as he searched his memories.

As far as he could recall, nobody in the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team went by the name of Heiser. Or, more specifically, nobody well-known in the adventurer team went by that name.

After Holy Dragon Spear’s battle against the Sun Dynasty and Sovereign Mark in his previous life, the adventurer team became a hot topic across the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. Practically everyone gossiped about Holy Dragon Spear in their free time. Back then, even the Tier 6 party leaders of Holy Dragon Spear were widely known, let alone the adventurer team’s chosen ones.

It should be known that Xiao Yilong was considered one of Holy Dragon Spear’s top three Shield Warriors. Based on Xiao Yilong’s claims, Heiser should be superior to him in both strength and fame in Holy Dragon Spear, so there was no way she would have been unknown in Shi Feng’s previous life. Yet, Shi Feng could not recall any information about her.

“Let’s hurry inside. The competition is about to start. Big Sis Frost still needs to get registered,” Twilight Leaf urged when she saw Shi Feng lost in thought.

At Twilight Leaf’s reminder, Xiao Yilong looked at the time and quickly ushered Shi Feng and Red Frost into the Battle Arena.

…

The Flame Vein Battle Arena was Holy Dragon Spear’s most prized construction. This was because it was a Special Construction.

In God’s Domain, most Guild Cities would only have an Advanced Battle Arena. The Advanced Battle Arena could accommodate about 200,000 to 300,000 people and allow players to fight under equal levels and Basic Attributes. It also offered players a combat environment that was more conducive to learning. The Battle Arena’s owner could also host competitions that offered rewards to attract customers.

Coming after the Advanced Battle Arena was the Peak Battle Arena. This construction could only be found in the Holy Cities operated by apex powers and a few pseudo-apex powers. It could accommodate up to 500,000 people and allow players to fight a perfect simulation of themselves, letting them discover their flaws more easily.

As for Holy Dragon Spear’s Special Battle Arena, it was vastly superior to even the various apex powers’ Peak Battle Arenas. In addition to being able to accommodate one million people, it could also let spectators experience fights from a first-person perspective.

For this reason, the Flame Vein Battle Arena was extremely popular at all times, and it was a challenge just to buy a ticket to enter the Battle Arena.

Flame Vein Battle Arena, VIP Seating Area:

When Shi Feng and Xiao Yilong entered the VIP seating area, hundreds of pairs of eyes immediately scrutinized Shi Feng.

“I’ve never seen that person before. Is he Xiao Yilong’s acquaintance?”

“He’s Black Flame. He’s currently a top-300 expert on the Divine Glory List. I heard he is supporting Red Frost to compete for the position of Great Commander.”

“A mere top-300 expert dares meddle in these waters? Does he not know Heiser has Ember Dragon backing her?”

“It’s not surprising. He isn’t the first person to try such a thing in our Sanctuary. He probably thinks he can establish a foothold in our Sanctuary after killing one of the Holy Race’s Holy Children and entering the Divine Glory List’s top 300. Unfortunately, he has no idea such achievements are worthless here.”

“Xiao Yilong has also fallen behind the times to throw his support behind Red Frost. Once this farce ends, he’ll probably have to retire to the second line. As for Black Flame, he’ll know his place once he watches the Battle of the Chosen Ones.”

The executives of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s various powers started a discussion among themselves as they watched Shi Feng take his seat. Although they spoke softly, they did not speak in private channels. Thus, Xiao Yilong could hear every word they said. Unfortunately, despite his frustration, he could do nothing but swallow his grievances.

The people sitting in the VIP seating area were big shots in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Outside of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, few people knew of them. But as someone who had grown up in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, Xiao Yilong knew that even the weakest of them was as strong as the Divine Glory List’s top 50 experts. They had simply faded from people’s memories after their long absence from the Greater God’s Domain’s spotlight.

…

Amidst the discussions of the VIP seating area’s occupants, the first match-up in the Battle of the Chosen Ones was announced.
