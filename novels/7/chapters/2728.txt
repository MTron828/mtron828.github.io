Chapter 2729 – Shi Feng and Odin “One move?!”

“The gap between Tier 3 and Tier 4 is actually this massive?”

When the various major powers’ experts in the VIP viewing rooms saw Shi Feng slay Sandstorm, they gasped involuntarily.

Although they had long since known that Tier 4 was the milestone separating the strong from the weak in God’s Domain, they never expected the gap between Tier 3 and Tier 4 players to be so massive. Just a moment ago, although Lina and the other Demidragons were struggling with Shi Feng’s attacks, they at least possessed the strength to put up a fight.

However, as soon as Shi Feng stopped holding back...

“That bastard! He was actually toying with us all this time!” a tall Demidragon man cursed as he glared at Shi Feng in anger and frustration.

“No, that probably isn’t the case,” Lina said, shaking her head.

“What do you mean? He wasn’t toying with us?” the tall man asked strangely. “This is only my guess, but...” Peeking at Shi Feng, Lina continued quietly, “He might’ve been on his guard against Sir Odin since the start of the battle.”

“He was wary of Sir Odin?” Realization dawned on the other Demidragons when they heard Lina’s conjecture.

Odin was an elusive existence in Mythology. If he hadn’t taken the initiative to appear, none of them would’ve noticed his presence. Only after Shi Feng exposed him did Odin reveal himself.

The tall man and the others shuddered. If what Lina said really was true, then Shi Feng was much more terrifying than they had thought.

Meanwhile, after killing Sandstorm, Shi Feng turned to look at Odin in the distance.

From the moment he arrived before the Advanced Resource Node, he had sensed a vague killing intent directed at him. If not for him having reached Tier 4 already and received a qualitative improvement to his physique and Concentration, he wouldn’t have noticed this killing intent at all.

Due to this threat, he had held back his strength. Even when clashing with Lina’s group, he refrained from using his full strength, all so he could respond when the owner of this hidden killing intent took action.

However, the moment Sandstorm went crazy and lashed out, Odin had also thoroughly displayed his killing intent.

Truthfully, even Shi Feng had to be wary of Odin. In his previous life, everyone had heard of Odin’s name. Not only was Odin an invincible existence even among Tier 6 God-ranked experts, but fighting enemies of a higher tier was also commonplace for him.

In the past, Odin had fought against a Tier 5 NPC while he was still Tier 4. In the end, their battle had not only ended in a draw but even leveled an entire NPC city.

This was despite the gap between Tier 4 and Tier 5 being even greater than the one between Tier 3 and Tier 4. Hence, Shi Feng had no choice but to activate Blade Domain as a precaution.

The reason Tier 4 classes were feared by players and recognized as powerhouses in God’s Domain wasn’t just their extraordinary physiques and frightening control over Mana. Instead, a larger part was due to the Tier 4 Skills and Spells they wielded.

In God’s Domain, there was a qualitative difference between Tier 3 and Tier 4 Skills. This was because Tier 4 Skills mainly relied on Mana in the natural world to activate. In comparison, Tier 3 Skills relied on the user’s Mana to activate. Due to this difference, the power levels of the two were worlds apart.

With the aid of Tier 4 Skills and Spells, Shi Feng dared to fight against even true Tier 3 Infant Dragons, let alone kill a Demidragon like Sandstorm.

However, to Shi Feng’s surprise, Odin never actually took action. He only used his killing intent to create an illusion of wanting to take action.

“Youngsters nowadays really are getting better and better.” A smile appeared under Odin’s hood. The man then looked at Prosciutto and said, “Let’s go.”

“Yes, sir!”

Prosciutto no longer hesitated this time. However, when he walked past Shi Feng, he also gave the latter a glance. Although he didn’t say anything, the intention his eyes conveyed was obvious.

We will meet again!

Afterward, Prosciutto and the rest of Mythology’s 1,000-man team left the Advanced Resource Node. They gave up the Resource Node very decisively and departed for another Resource Node together with Odin.

“They left?”

“They left, just like that?” “That Odin actually didn’t take action?”

The audience was stunned by this situation. The originally heaven-defying battle had actually ended in such a manner. Moreover, Mythology’s members had given up the fight so decisively. This was completely different from how the Five Great Super Guilds operated normally.

At this moment, even Muxin was taken aback by this situation.

“Is this...our victory?” Muxin couldn’t help asking Shi Feng.

Odin’s name was synonymous with destruction to the various superpowers. Now that Mythology had mobilized even Odin, she found it truly inconceivable that Mythology would give up just because of one Tier 4 player.

After all, while a Tier 4 existence was an invincible enemy for the various superpowers, that might not necessarily be the case for the Five Great Super Guilds. “I guess so.” Shi Feng nodded while looking at Odin’s departing figure.

Odin’s decisiveness had caught even Shi Feng off guard.

Initially, Shi Feng had already braced himself to fight for his life. He had even resolved to use some of the trump cards he had kept hidden all this time.

However, he now felt as if he had just punched at empty air.

“Do we still take control of this Resource Node?” Muxin asked.

“Of course,” Shi Feng answered decisively. “We went through great difficulties to win it.”

“Okay. I’ll have the others set up a perimeter now.” Upon hearing Shi Feng’s answer, Muxin immediately had her subordinates take up stations around the Resource Node to prevent others from stealing it.

After leaving the Resource Node, Prosciutto couldn’t help turning to Odin in confusion.

“Sir Odin, since we surrendered the Resource Node to Black Flame so easily this time, I’m afraid the other four Guilds will most likely ridicule us. Some superpowers might even start to make light of us because of this. Are we really not going to do anything?” Prosciutto asked.

In Prosciutto’s opinion, even if Shi Feng was a Tier 4 player, their team still had a fighting chance-especially since Odin was present. It wouldn’t even be strange if they managed to take down Shi Feng. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yet, Odin had unexpectedly given away the Resource Node without a fight.

“Now isn’t the time to fight,” Odin replied, shaking his head. “Moreover, we know too little about Zero Wing.”“It isn’t the time to fight?” Prosciutto grew even more confused at Odin’s words. “Why?”

With Mythology’s strength, they wouldn’t fear fighting the four other Super Guilds, much less Zero Wing. In fact, he was confident Mythology could triumph over any of the other four Guilds.

Now, they were actually retreating because of Zero Wing. When news of this matter spread, Mythology would most likely become the various superpowers’ laughing stock.

“Take a look at these.” Odin did not grow angry over Prosciutto’s doubts. Instead, he forwarded a few videos to Prosciutto before saying, “You’ll understand the reason once you finish watching them.”

“How is this possible?”

Prosciutto was stunned when he saw the videos Odin sent him.

This was because every one of these videos depicted a battle at the other Resource Nodes Mythology occupied. Moreover, these battles shared a common point: Zero Wing’s experts took part in them.

“All of them...lost?!”
