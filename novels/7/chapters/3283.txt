Chapter 358 – Astonishing Strike

Thunder Fortress, Thunder Restaurant:

The Thunder Restaurant was situated in the sky above the Thunder Fortress, overlooking the entire fortress. However, because the restaurant was situated a thousand meters in the air, thunderclouds and lightning arcs constantly surrounded it. One touch from these lightning arcs was enough to vaporize a Tier 4 player. So, if players wished to reach the Thunder Restaurant, they’d have to do so using a small flying ship.

When Midsummer, Wu Xiaoxiao, and Jun Luosha arrived at the Thunder Restaurant, they couldn’t help but be awed by the restaurant’s extravagance and the view they got to see from the restaurant. Looking down from the restaurant’s entrance, they could see thousands of ships docked in the fortress down below. There was also a constant stream of ships sailing in and out of the fortress. This was an incredible sight that one could rarely see in God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng’s party of four entered the nine-story-tall restaurant, Midsummer and the others were given another shock.

!!

Currently, all of the guests dining in the restaurant were executive members of the various hegemonic powers. Ordinary players were not qualified to set foot into this place at all.

Moreover, the prices the restaurant charged for its food were utterly criminal. Rather than Coins, players had to pay in Seven Luminaries Crystals for the meals here. Meanwhile, any random meal here cost over 100 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.

Yet, despite the exorbitant prices, the restaurant was packed with players enthusiastically stuffing themselves with food.

“How smart of these people,” Shi Feng commented as he watched the various hegemonic powers’ executives gorging themselves with food and beverages. However, he wasn’t particularly surprised by their behavior.

“Smart?” Jun Luosha was puzzled by Shi Feng’s comment. She failed to see how any of these people here were smart. In her opinion, these people were utterly prodigious. After all, paying over 100 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal for a single meal was unthinkable even in the Greater God’s Domain.

“The food they’re eating isn’t your normal fare,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “All of these meals are a Craftsman Chef’s cooking. Players who consume them will see an improvement in their physique and the strength of their mana. You will rarely find such meals, even in the Greater God’s Domain. You won’t lose out even if you pay 1,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal for a meal, let alone 100 units. Although these meals will only provide improvements on the first consumption, subsequent consumptions will allow players to enter an ethereal state that can drastically improve their learning capabilities temporarily.”

“A Craftsman Chef’s cooking?” Midsummer nearly drooled when she heard Shi Feng’s explanation.

The chef class was a Lifestyle class similar to the forger and alchemist classes, and chefs could be categorized into Basic Chefs, Advanced Chefs, Master Chefs, Grandmaster Chefs, and Craftsman Chefs.

Normally, only one in ten thousand Lifestyle players could become a Grandmaster, while only one in 100,000 Grandmasters could become a Craftsman. In other words, the chances of a Lifestyle player becoming a Craftsman was one in one billion.

Because of their rarity, every Craftsman would be highly respected by even upper-ranking hegemonic powers. The status of Craftsmen was vastly superior to even paragons such as Saint Nine.

Meanwhile, in the case of Craftsman Chefs, Midsummer had never even heard of one existing in the Ancient River Kingdom or the several dozen neighboring kingdoms and empires.

While Midsummer was thinking of the Thunder Restaurant’s food, their party arrived before the top-floor VIP room under the Assassin youth’s lead. Currently, there were six Tier 4 experts standing guard outside the room, every one of them radiating an aura superior to Saint Nine. Only, unlike Saint Nine, these six experts looked like they were well above 50 years of age. Every one of them also wore the Paimon Conglomerate’s Paimon Fang Guard Emblem, an indicator that they were experts capable of transcending tiers.

After the Assassin youth informed the six guards of the purpose of their visit, the six guards opened the doors to the VIP room for Shi Feng’s party of four.

When Midsummer, Wu Xiaoxiao, and Jun Luosha entered the VIP room, they couldn’t help but gasp.

Currently, about a dozen or so people were sitting in the room half the size of a football field. The majority of these people were either the Vice Guild Leaders of hegemonic powers or experts on the Miniature Ancient World’s God List. Even Trecht, the God List’s rank-one player, was present among the people dining in the room.

Out of these dozen or so people, the most inconspicuous person would have to be Thousand Scars, who was regarded as the number one genius among the Miniature Ancient World’s native players. When Thousand Scars saw Shi Feng appearing in the room, she was given quite a surprise.

As for the most dazzling person in this room, that honor would have to go to the delicate young man sitting in the center. Although the young man looked like he was only thirteen or fourteen, the equipment he wore was so dazzling it bordered on blinding.

A Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set!

Indeed!

The young man was clad in a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. It was even a six-piece set. Moreover, he also carried a longsword of indiscernible quality by his waist. Even though the youth was only a Tier 4 Swordsman, his Basic Attributes could probably rival a bona fide Tier 5 Sword Saint already…

Meanwhile, standing behind this youth were four middle-aged men and women. Even without doing anything, these four people radiated an aura rivaling Legendary-ranked Archaic Species. Every one of them was leagues above Saint Nine.

“Black Flame! I heard your name as soon as I arrived in this Miniature Ancient World!” the delicate young man said indifferently as he gnawed on a piece of meat. “Although your rank on the God List is far lower than Trecht’s, you still meet my minimum requirements. How about joining my Shadow Guard Legion? I can let you start as a party leader. Once your strength improves, I might even introduce you to my father.”

As soon as the delicate youth finished speaking, the oldest man, a Berserker with graying hair, standing behind the youth, suddenly shouted, “Black Flame! Hurry up and thank the young master! This is the biggest opportunity you will get in your life! Countless paragons in the Starlight Realm can’t even meet the young master even if they want to! Not only do you get to meet the young master now, but you can even become a party leader in the young master’s Shadow Guard Legion! You might even get a chance to meet the patriarch in the future! Not even the Paimon Conglomerate’s paragons can get such an opportunity!”

Upon hearing the delicate youth’s and the middle-aged Berserker’s words, many of the Vice Guild Leaders of hegemonic powers present couldn’t help but snicker. As for Flanders, who was also here on behalf of the Tower Alliance, he revealed an ugly expression when he heard the two’s words.

Everyone present understood that the “opportunity” the middle-aged Berserker spoke of was nonsense. It was nothing but an empty promise from Dira. It’d be more appropriate to say that Dira was asking Shi Feng to sign a slave contract.

Meanwhile, in response to Dira’s offer, Shi Feng shook his head and calmly said, “Forgive me for turning down your offer, Young Master Dira. It is best if you leave that party leader position for someone who needs it more. I still have matters to tend to, so if there is nothing else you need me for, I will be taking my leave first.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, silence filled the room. Even Dira had stopped chewing his food, his expression turning extraordinarily grim. Immediately afterward, a cold aura spread across the entire room. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Black Flame! How dare you refuse the young master’s kindness?!” the middle-aged Berserker bellowed at Shi Feng. “I’ll teach you a lesson in humility on behalf of the young master!”

After saying so, the middle-aged Berserker reached for the battle axe on his back and swung the weapon at Shi Feng, the terrifying aura he emitted causing not just the VIP room but also the entire Thunder Restaurant to tremble.

“Humility? Is he even worthy of that?”

After glancing at the oncoming axe, Shi Feng unsheathed the Winter of Eternal Night and swung it.
