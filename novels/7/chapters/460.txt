Chapter 461 - Exceeding Potential

When the sun set, Shi Feng had already been in deep slumber for over a dozen hours.

Di! Di! Di!

The virtual gaming cabin inside the bedroom continuously let out a warning sound.

At this moment, the Nutrient Solution inside the virtual gaming cabin was already depleted.

After the alarm of the gaming cabin rang for some time, the cover of the cabin suddenly opened.

“So tired.” Shi Feng opened his eyes and unwillingly climbed out of the virtual gaming cabin. He then took a look at the time. “What? I’ve actually slept for 18 hours!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Although he had exceeded his mental limit once again, it was not as severe as the first time. Even so, he had still slept for such a long time...

“Just what is going on here?”

After Shi Feng woke up, his entire body felt drained. Even the Nutrient Solution he had refilled just a few days ago was completely exhausted.

Normally, a full tank of Nutrient Solution could last a player 15 days. The previous time Shi Feng had exceeded his limit, some Solution still remained. Now, however, the tank was completely emptied...

However, compared to the matter of the Nutrient Solution’s depletion, his body’s current condition was much more inconceivable for Shi Feng. Not only was his body extremely weak, but he also felt a piercing hunger that he had never felt before. He was so hungry that he could eat an entire cow right now.

Although Shi Feng did not understand what was going on, he did know that, if he did not replenish his body’s nutrients at once, he could very well faint from hunger.

He immediately retrieved the two bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid he had set aside for his parents.

At this moment, Shi Feng could clearly tell that the hunger he was feeling did not come from his stomach. Instead, it was his body that starved of energy. Even eating a meal would not sate this hunger. What he needed to do right now was replenish the energy of the cells inside his body. Meanwhile, the S-rank Nutrient Fluids were the best solution for this problem.

After removing the cap, Shi Feng directly gulped down a bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid.

When the S-rank Nutrient Fluid reached Shi Feng’s intestinal tract, the originally cooling liquid suddenly transformed into a warm current that moved through his blood, re-energizing his entire body.

Five minutes after drinking the S-rank Nutrient Fluid, Shi Feng felt much more comfortable than before. His spirit had also recovered significantly, and his body was no longer trembling as it had before.

The value of one million Credits was really not overstated.

However, this feeling only lasted for a short while before the feeling of hunger flooded his mind once more. He felt as if he was a wolf that had been starving for three consecutive days; a bite of meat was simply not enough to sate him. The hunger he was feeling right now was even more intense than earlier.

Is one bottle not enough? Shi Feng was speechless.

A single battle actually required him to sacrifice two bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids.

No choice.

Shi Feng could only remove the cap on the last bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid and empty its contents.

Originally, one had to wait an interval of three to five days before consuming another bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid as the energy contained within the liquid was extremely concentrated. A person’s body was simply incapable of completely absorbing all that energy. Instead, drinking two bottles consecutively would only damage one’s body due to overnutrition.

When Shi Feng drank the second bottle, he felt a little heartache.

Each bottle cost one million Credits. Moreover, one could not simply purchase S-rank Nutrient Fluids even if they could afford it.

In the past, even though he had been the Guild Leader of Shadow, he only got to drink one bottle a month. Now, he had actually drunk two bottles in a single day. If others were to find out about this, they would definitely look down on him as a wastrel.

However, S-rank Nutrient Fluids were indeed amazing. After drinking two bottles and resting for a few minutes, Shi Feng was already completely rid of his fatigue. His body had also recovered to normal. Following which, Shi Feng drank another dozen or so bottles of A-rank Nutrient Fluid before recovering to his peak condition...

“Is it my imagination?”

After recovering completely, Shi Feng suddenly discovered that his five senses were much more acute than before. Originally, he could never hear the chirping of birds when inside his bedroom. Now, however, he could actually hear it.

Besides being able to hear the chirping of birds, when Shi Feng looked at his own room, he was also able to see with much greater clarity than before. His mind had also become much faster.

“Did breaking through my mental limit multiple times allow my brain to become more active?” Shi Feng’s heart was filled with ecstasy.

He had tried fortifying his body many times before to increase the flow of blood into his brain, in addition to providing his body with various nutrients. He had done so to develop his brain’s potential and boost its activity level, so that he could create his legacy in God’s Domain.

Now, he had actually achieved a breakthrough!

The human brain had always been a domain filled with mystery. In the past, even the most amazing human could only exhibit 10% of their brain’s potential. Advancements in technology had made developing the brain’s potential possible, but it was extremely difficult to do so. It was not something one could succeed at just by trying.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, countless people had tried their best and had spent large sums of money just to raise their brain’s potential by a tiny fraction. Yet, even so, these people had felt that slight improvement worth their sacrifice.

As the activity of the brain increased, a person’s control over their body would also improve significantly.

In God’s Domain, there were many genius players who possessed extraordinary talents. However, why were these geniuses better than ordinary players?

It was because their brain’s activity was out of the ordinary. As a result, their control over their game avatar surpassed ordinary players’, allowing them to carry out actions that no ordinary player was capable of.

Just like Soaring Snake whom Shi Feng had met some time ago. Soaring Snake was a gifted genius who possessed unmatched reflexes.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng had broken through that limit by chance, so how could he not grow excited?

Although he had only received a slight improvement, Shi Feng could now see a new path opening up for him.

Moreover, this was a path that led directly to the peak of God’s Domain.

“It seems that I need to prepare many more bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid in the future.” Shi Feng felt uneasy when he recalled the piercing hunger that was transmitted to his brain earlier.

After breaking past the limit of his mental power, his brain naturally needed a massive amount of energy to recover. This time, he was only fortunate that he had sufficient bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid to allow him to achieve a breakthrough. Otherwise, he would have had to be admitted into the hospital to rest for some time.

Moreover, resting at the hospital would not necessarily increase his brain’s activity and develop its potential.

When Shi Feng thought about improving his brain’s activity, his thirst for S-rank Nutrient Fluids grew even more intense.

Only now did Shi Feng understand why the first-rate Guilds and Super Guilds in the past were purchasing S-rank Nutrient Fluids in bulk. There was an 80% chance that they had done so in order to nurture apex experts. On the other hand, he had been under the misconception all this time that S-rank Nutrient Fluids were only used to strengthen a person’s physique.

Ding! Ding! Ding!

Suddenly, Shi Feng’s quantum watch started ringing. Meanwhile, the person calling him was none other than Big Dipper Training Center’s Chairman, Xiao Yu.

“Master Shi Feng, our side has already completed the preparations for the fighting competition. As for the exact time of the event, it will be set at two days from now, at 10 o’clock in the morning. May I know your opinion on this? If you are not free, I can still delay the event by two or three days,” Xiao Yu said.

“Let’s go with two days from now, then.” Shi Feng was in a very good mood at the moment. Hearing Xiao Yu’s words, he became even more elated.

As long as he won the competition, he would obtain not only five virtual gaming cabins but also 15 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid.

“I have already sent the information regarding your opponent to your quantum space. However, that person is very mysterious, and the information we have collected on him is very limited. We only have the records for a few of his matches. He had ended a majority of his matches in just a single move.” Xiao Yu had not expected Shi Feng to remain so calm. He knew that Zhao Ruoxi had long since told Shi Feng every little detail about his opponent’s strength, so Shi Feng should know how amazing his opponent was. Yet, now, not only was Shi Feng not anxious, but he was even showing a hint of anticipation.

“I understand. I’ll research it a little.” Shi Feng nodded. “I still have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be hanging up first.”

After saying so, Shi Feng disconnected the call.

Following a period of rest, Shi Feng was already fully recovered. He still had many matters he needed to deal with in God’s Domain. Since he had slept for so long just now, he naturally could not delay any longer, which was why he had ended the call in such a hurry. After refilling the Nutrient Solution inside the virtual gaming cabin, he lay down inside the cabin and entered God’s Domain once more.
