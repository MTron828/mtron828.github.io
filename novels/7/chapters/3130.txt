Chapter 205 – Glimmering Sword

“She wants to meet me?”

Shi Feng fell into thought when he heard that Laura Crader wanted to meet him.

Shi Feng had seen Laura Crader in the Abyssal Tower’s lobby previously, and the feeling of strength he felt from her was something he had only come across a few times in the Greater God’s Domain during his previous life.

However, Shi Feng was certain that he had never heard of Laura Crader’s name in the Greater God’s Domain, which was very strange for someone with her strength. It was especially true considering Purple Light’s Wordless Ember and Sleeping Quicksand had made such a huge name for themselves in the Greater God’s Domain.

It should be known that Laura was publicly recognized as Slumber City’s strongest expert. She was also vastly stronger than Wordless Ember and Sleeping Quicksand currently. So, it stood to reason that Laura’s name would spread like wildfire once this Stratified Abyssal Realm was thoroughly integrated into the Greater God’s Domain.

Yet, that never happened during Shi Feng’s previous life, which confused him greatly.

“Okay. Where do I meet her?” Shi Feng asked.

Even if the Glimmering Sword didn’t come to find him, Shi Feng would probably go to find her. According to Echoing Judgment, the Glimmer adventurer team was Slumber City’s number one power, and the adventurer team owned a mineral vein that produced a large amount of Dark Crystals. This was also the vein that produced the most Dark Crystals near Slumber City and the several neighboring cities. Its production volume was at least three or four times greater than the average vein that produced Dark Crystals.

So, one could say that Glimmer was the wealthiest power in Slumber City when it came to Dark Crystals. If anyone in Slumber City was looking to get their hands on a large amount of Dark Crystals, they definitely couldn’t avoid Glimmer. There was even a rumor saying that most of the Dark Crystals sold in Slumber City actually came from Glimmer.

“Glimmer’s headquarters in the central district,” Blackie said. “She will be waiting for you there all day today. But are you really going to meet her by yourself, Guild Leader? Wouldn’t it be too dangerous?”

Any adventurer team’s headquarters was considered private territory. Meanwhile, unless the property owner had designated their property as a safe zone, NPC soldiers would not intervene even if a fight broke out on the property.

While most players would normally designate their private property as a safe zone, players could also change this setting whenever they wanted. If they wanted to ambush someone, they could simply designate their property as a combat zone.

Because of this setting, players would be at a considerable disadvantage when visiting another player’s private property. After all, most private properties would have some sort of defensive magic array set in place. While these defensive magic arrays couldn’t stop players from leaving, they could subject all enemies in the area to a powerful suppression.

“If Laura Crader truly intends on dealing with me, she wouldn’t have to go to such lengths. Glimmer has also never shown any interest in unifying Slumbering City, and neither has it participated in the power struggles in the city,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “Otherwise, with Glimmer’s influence over Slumber City, it would have long since unified the city years ago. Death Curse would have never gotten the opportunity to rise, much less unify the city.”

“Even so, you still need to be careful. Even if Glimmer doesn’t intend on taking action, the same can’t be said for the other peak powers in the city,” Blackie reminded.

Every power in Slumber City was well aware that Zero Wing would soon rise in Slumber City, becoming another one of the city’s peak powers and adding to the already intense competition. Meanwhile, the main contributor to Zero Wing’s rise was undoubtedly Shi Feng. If Shi Feng were to get killed even once, it would have a huge impact on Zero Wing.

It was true that Shi Feng possessed astonishing individual strength. However, there were many ways players could use to take down powerful foes. For example, with the help of a Grandmaster Magic Array, a group of Tier 3 players could even take down a Tier 5 expert.

This was also a relatively common occurrence in God’s Domain. Grandmaster Magic Arrays might be as rare as Legendary items, but with how unique the Stratified Abyssal Realm was, it wouldn’t be strange even if the peak powers here possessed a few.

“Relax. Those powers shouldn’t have the time for that right now. The peak powers from other cities will be arriving soon. Those powers are a much bigger threat to the local powers than I am,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “By the way, contact Blood Hammer and tell him that Zero Wing can supply the Tower Alliance with Hypersensitivity Potions. We can supply them with up to 1,000 bottles a month at the price of one Lineage Crystal per bottle.”

“One thousand bottles a month? For one Lineage Crystal per bottle?” Blackie was a little stunned when he heard Shi Feng’s offer. Although he had long since known that Shi Feng could exchange for a large number of Hypersensitivity Potions after becoming a Vice City Lord, he didn’t expect it to be this many. “Will they be willing to take this offer, though?”

“I doubt they’ll refuse. Hypersensitivity Potions are much more useful than Lineage Crystals to them,” Shi Feng said confidently. Lineage Crystals might be precious in their homeworld, but it wasn’t as valuable in the Tower Alliance’s homeworld.

Although Shi Feng could also exchange Hypersensitivity Potions to Lineage Crystals with Purple Light, the amount he could get from Purple Light probably wouldn’t be as much as he could get from the Tower Alliance.

Based on what Shi Feng gathered, the Tower Alliance should be a superpower very close to becoming a hegemonic power. It was vastly superior to a Chamber of Commerce that was based in only one city in the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

In addition, Lineage Crystals were quite valuable in this Stratified Abyssal Realm. So, there wouldn’t be any power in the Stratified Abyssal Realm willing to accept a one-to-one trade for Lineage Crystals and Hypersensitivity Potions.

However, it was a different story for the Tower Alliance. The Tower Alliance had entered the Stratified Abyssal Realm with the specific purpose of recruiting experts. So, it would definitely be interested in the prospect of getting its hands on more Hypersensitivity Potions and nurturing its own experts.

“Okay. I’ll contact Blood Hammer right away.” Blackie nodded excitedly and hung up the call. If Zero Wing could get its hands on 1,000 Lineage Crystals a month, he was confident that Zero Wing could quickly become a superpower in the Miniature Ancient World.

While Blackie was contacting Blood Hammer, Shi Feng arrived in front of Glimmer’s headquarters situated in the city’s center.

Glimmer’s headquarters was a mansion that occupied an area the size of a stadium. Yet, despite its massive headquarters, Glimmer’s member count did not exceed 10,000. The adventurer team’s size was significantly smaller compared to the city’s other peak powers, which had over 100,000 members at the very least.

However, the average strength of Glimmer’s members was also the highest out of all peak powers in Slumber City. Even the weakest member in the adventurer team was a Refinement Realm expert. The adventurer team also had the most Novice Temple Knights, the number exceeding 1,000.

As expected of Slumber City’s number one power. The number of experts here far exceeds my expectations, Shi Feng inwardly exclaimed as he looked at the players loitering in the mansion’s front yard.

At a glance, Shi Feng could see over 30 Temple Knight-level experts in the front yard. Moreover, nearly ten radiated an aura rivaling Death Curse’s Night Revenant. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It should be known that Night Revenant was a third-floor expert very close to reaching the fourth-floor standard. He was also a vice commander-level individual in Death Curse. Meanwhile, Death Curse only had four such vice commanders.

Glimmer’s strength definitely wasn’t as simple as outsiders assumed.

After Shi Feng walked into Glimmer’s mansion, a three-meter-tall middle-aged man who was at Level 120 and radiated a Tier 4 aura approached him. Then, after scrutinizing Shi Feng for a moment, the middle-aged man pointed at the innermost room of a nearby corridor and coldly said, “I really don’t understand what the commander sees in you. Go in, then. The commander is waiting for you inside.”
