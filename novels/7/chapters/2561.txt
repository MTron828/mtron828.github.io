Chapter 2562 – Challenging the Dark World?

Silence fell as Shi Feng finished his declaration. Magic Flash and Old Forest stared at the Swordsman with their mouths ajar. They hadn’t actually thought he’d been serious.

This was insane!

They had assumed Shi Feng had been joking back in the Freedom Hotel, and yet, the man had just repeated his intentions straight to the Dark World’s various powers and independent players...

After a moment, every Dark Player broke out in riotous laughter.

“Did this guy come all this way just to tell us a joke?”

“He actually thinks Zero Wing will manage this Teleportation Gate from now on. Does he really think he can claim ownership by declaring it?”

“Who does this guy think he is?”

For a time, the countless Dark Players expressed their anger and ridicule. Their prior fear and awe had evaporated like fog on a hot day. They wondered how hard Shi Feng had hit his head to provoke the Dark World in its entirety so boldly.

What is Black Flame trying to do? Did he give himself a concussion and lose his mind? Doesn’t he realize that he basically just declared war on everyone in the Dark World? Blue Rainbow frowned at Shi Feng, who still seemed quite calm.

When they had heard Magic Flash and Old Forest’s report, they had considered Shi Feng’s intentions a joke. Now, however, Shi Feng had publicly announced Zero Wing’s plan to take control of the Teleportation Gate. If this was a joke, it wasn’t funny.

As far as she was concerned, this Swordsman either overestimated himself or was on a path of self-destruction.

Not even multiple cooperating Super Guilds would dare spout such nonsense before the Dark World’s army, much less a single superpower. Anyone that took control of the Teleportation Gate would reign over the Dark World.

This was beyond foolish!

He’s dead! He’s definitely dead now! Furious Heart laughed maniacally as he watched Shi Feng.

Thanks to Shi Feng’s announcement, the Dark World’s various powers and independent experts would stop at nothing to obliterate Zero Wing, even if Demon’s Heart didn’t pull any strings. They likely wouldn’t let the matter rest until they had removed any trace of Zero Wing from Cold Spring Forest. If they didn’t, the main continent’s players would look down on them, which was something the Dark World’s denizens and powers wouldn’t allow.

Once the Dark World’s collective laughter died down, each of these Dark Players turned lethal gazes on Shi Feng, killing intent radiating from them in waves. Some Tier 3 experts even unsheathed their weapons, preparing to teach this arrogant Swordsman a lesson.

“What a pity, Guild Leader Black Flame. I had hoped you were smart enough to know when to advance and when to retreat, but it would seem that Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society had thought too highly of you,” Dawn Dominance said, shaking his head. He then turned to leave, with no intention of continuing his conversation with Shi Feng.

A unit of five Flying Ships might be impressive, but it wasn’t intimidating enough to force the Dark World’s invading army to back down. While war weapons had frightening power and deadly potential, their attack rates were very low. When there wasn’t much of a difference between two sides’ combat power, an additional five Flying Ships would prove miraculously effective, but if one side had an overwhelming combat power advantage, the ships couldn’t turn the tide of battle.

At Tier 3, expert players were more than agile enough to evade Flying Ships’ attacks as long as there was enough distance between them. Furthermore, the invading army had more than 50 Flying Mounts, just as much aerial combat power as Zero Wing.

When Dawn Dominance left, the surrounding Tier 3 experts smirked and moved to surround Shi Feng.

Nearly 1,000 Tier 3 experts pointed their weapons at the Swordsman, their combined killing intent so powerful that the air around them grew cold and cloudy.

The Tier 2 Dark Players that had come to Cold Spring Forest to join the fun couldn’t contain their excitement as they watched.

Not even superpowers had so many Tier 3 experts, yet the Dark World’s army had so many more.

When less than 50 yards separated these Dark experts and Shi Feng, figures began to drop from the hovering Flying Ships, one after another.

In the blink of an eye, nearly 500 Tier 3 experts took their places around Shi Feng, and every one of them radiated a more intense aura than the Dark World’s Tier 3 experts.

“This...”

Seeing reinforcements arrive, the encroaching Dark Players came to a halt. The various major powers’ spectating upper echelons were similarly astonished. They had never dreamed that Zero Wing could muster such strength.

Now that 500 Tier 3 experts had joined the fray, the Dark World’s top three Guilds would be no match for Zero Wing’s force, even if they worked together. Including the Flying Ships still looming above them, engaging in battle now would only invite Zero Wing to slaughter those top three Guilds.

“It’s no wonder why you dared to spout such nonsense. Zero Wing is actually quite formidable.” Dawn Dominance had stopped, turning to glance at the Tier 3 experts around Shi Feng, but he shook his head and continued, “However, I’m afraid that still won’t be enough to defeat the Dark World.”

As he finished speaking, more Tier 3 Dark Players swarmed around Shi Feng. In less than 30 seconds, a group of over 6,000 Tier 3 Dark Players had joined the encirclement. Even Blue Frost and his Zero Wing companions from Shelter One, all of whom had participated in numerous battles, couldn’t help but frown.

“Blue, what do you think the Guild Leader is trying to do? We’re not really going to fight against all those people, are we?” Best Reincarnation, the leader of Shelter One’s Second Party, nervously asked.

He had watched and fought in multiple wars involving tens of thousands of players, but compared to the Dark World’s army, those forces weren’t worth mentioning. Not even an army of tens of thousands would be a warm-up for these 6,000-plus Tier 3 experts. If this force entered the Dark Den, they could sweep through the Otherworld without any trouble. Even if every Shelter banded together, they wouldn’t survive. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Meanwhile, Zero Wing had fewer than 500 Tier 3 experts present, and even with monsters like Fire Dance and Hell Rush, their chances of victory were unknown.

“I don’t know, but even if we lose this battle, it’ll be helpful in the future. Not just anyone gets an opportunity to face such a powerful force,” Blue Frost replied with a bitter smile. He had to admit that while Shi Feng’s behavior was insane, his blood boiled with excitement.

After all, who, at this stage of the game, would dare challenge such a formidable army?

Even the main continent’s various superpowers were afraid of the Dark World’s invading army, but not Zero Wing. If they lost, they’d lose with their pride intact.

This was also a super-rare opportunity to clash with a large number of Tier 3 experts, and the experience would definitely bolster their future development.

As soon as Blue Frost finished his reply, however, Shi Feng stepped forward from Zero Wing’s defensive circle and faced the Dark World’s several thousand Tier 3 experts directly.

“It seems you still don’t understand,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head at the Tier 3 Dark Players around him. Calmly, he continued, “Since the very beginning, I told you that I’ve only come to inform you. I’m not here to negotiate. Since you wish to test my patience, I regret to inform you that you’ve picked a fight with the wrong person!”

Shi Feng then pulled a token from his bag and started to chant an incantation. It was simple, only consisting of a dozen or so syllables, and would even be easy for a player new to God’s Domain to chant.

Before the Dark Players could mock Shi Feng for his ignorant foolishness, several magic arrays quickly manifested behind the Swordsman. In less than a second, they transformed into a Spatial Gate, and once the gate was complete, NPCs in exquisite, uniform equipment marched into Cold Spring Forest like a well-trained army.

Every one of these NPCs had at least reached Level 120 and Tier 3. Many of them even hailed from other races, and in the blink of an eye, more than a thousand NPCs had joined the battlefield...
