Chapter 441 – Goddess of Space

“What an incredible expert!”

“He’s more than just incredible. Didn’t you see that even White Owl could do nothing against those three just now?”

“Is that guy really just a Tier 4 Sword Emperor?”

…

After seeing the three Holy Race experts incinerated by the sea of flames, the other human players who had caught up to White Owl couldn’t help but voice words of admiration as they looked at Shi Feng.

Everyone present had seen the strength the three Holy Race experts had exhibited. Although the trio had to work together just to gain a slight advantage over White Owl, it remained a fact that they could contend against a bona fide Tier 5 player. Moreover, with the Holy Power Protection effect the Holy Race enjoyed, the trio’s Defense was superior to the average Tier 5 Legendary monster. Yet, despite having these things going for them, the trio failed to survive more than one attack from Shi Feng.

At this time, White Owl, Death Omen, and Thousand Scars were similarly dumbfounded by this situation. It was especially so for White Owl.

As someone who had personally fought the three Holy Race experts, White Owl knew just how absurdly high the trio’s Defense was. Previously, when she landed a Heaven’s Collapse on Forest Ape, she didn’t even manage to take off 5% of the other party’s HP. Yet, it should be known that Forest Ape’s Defense was the weakest out of the trio.

While White Owl acknowledged that the attack Shi Feng just used was powerful, her senses told her that it was slightly weaker than the Heaven’s Collapse she had used. Yet, this “slightly weaker” attack instantly killed the three Holy Race experts.

Of course, White Owl wasn’t completely ignorant of what just happened. She was aware that Shi Feng could accomplish what he just did because his usage of mana had already reached a terrifying level. The fact that he instantly detonated the mana within a 100-yard radius was proof of this.

Meanwhile, rather than defeating the three Holy Race experts with just one attack, it’d be more accurate to say that Shi Feng had defeated them by creating countless mana explosions around them. Although each of these individual explosions wasn’t exceptionally powerful, when countless such explosions simultaneously occurred in a small area, the combined force would naturally be impressive.

It was also because of these mana explosions that no mana remained in the area engulfed by the sea of flames.

…

While everyone was feeling shocked, the sound of a system notification entered Shi Feng’s ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have slain three Tier 4 Holy Race players. Adventurer’s Association Merit Points +30.

System: You have accumulated 10 Adventurer’s Association Merit Points. You have received an Adventurer Medallion.

…

[Adventurer Medallion] (Ornament, Bronze Rank)

When wearing the Adventurer Medallion, you may ask to exchange for treasures at any Adventurer’s Association.

…

This thing will save me a lot of time, Shi Feng thought, smiling as he looked at the medallion in his hand.

Apart from trying to prevent the Holy Race from obtaining detailed information on the human race too soon, another reason Shi Feng came to intercept Northlight’s group’s retreat was so that he could acquire an Adventurer Medallion.

In God’s Domain, so long as players killed alien players, they could earn Merit Points from the Adventure’s Association. Upon accumulating 10 Merit Points, players would receive an Adventurer Medallion and become qualified to exchange for items in the Adventurer’s Association’s treasury. Meanwhile, the more Merit Points players accumulated, the higher the rank their Adventurer Medallion would become, and the more functions the medallion would have. The quality of the items players could exchange from the Adventurer’s Association’s treasury would also become better.

However, leveling up the Adventurer Medallion wasn’t an easy task. Players might only need ten Merit Points to receive the Bronze Adventurer Medallion, but they’d need to accumulate one thousand points to upgrade it to the Mysterious-Iron rank, 10,000 points to the Secret-Silver rank, one hundred thousand points to the Fine-Gold rank, one million points to the Dark-Gold rank, ten million points to the Epic rank, one hundred million points to the Fragmented Legendary rank, and one billion points to the Legendary rank.

According to rumors, once players successfully upgrade their Adventurer Medallion to the Legendary rank, they’d be qualified to exchange a Fragmented Divine Weapon from the Adventurer’s Association’s main branch. Because of this rumor, countless players were tempted to kill the Holy Race’s players.

Shi Feng dared not have any thoughts on getting a Legendary Adventurer Medallion. He was already satisfied with having just a Bronze Medallion. During the Eternal Realm’s exploration stage, a Bronze Medallion could let players avoid many detours.

After putting the Adventurer Medallion away, Shi Feng approached the three corpses before him and collected the items they dropped. Apart from equipment meant for the Holy Race, Shi Feng found a petrified tree branch.

The equipment these three dropped is good. It’s a pity they can’t be used by humans,?Shi Feng thought as he put the three pieces of equipment he collected into his bag.

The three pieces of equipment Northlight’s group dropped were all at the Fragmented Legendary rank. Normally, obtaining three pieces of Fragmented Legendary Equipment in less than a minute should be cause for celebration. However, as the Holy Race’s weapons and equipment were filled with rich Holy Power, humans could not use them, so they did not have any value whatsoever to humans.

Just when Shi Feng was getting ready to leave the Flameheart Canyon, a young man from the caravan approached him. This young man was none other than Unrestrained Lionheart, the de facto leader of the caravan escort.

“Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Black Flame,” Unrestrained Lionheart said, starting the conversation with words of gratitude. “We would have lost a lot of opportunities if these people managed to escape.”

“It’s nothing,” Shi Feng said, responding to Unrestrained Lionheart’s initiative with a smile. “Even if I didn’t decide to help, you could have easily taken care of the situation, Mr. Lionheart.”

Unrestrained Lionheart was very well-known during the war with the Holy Race in Shi Feng’s previous life. The man had single-handedly defended an entire world from the Holy Race. Afterward, he even fought solo against three Ancient Saints, existences that rivaled the Greater God’s Domain’s Ancient Gods. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Unfortunately, although Unrestrained Lionheart managed to cause the permanent downfall of two of the Ancient Saints and scare off the third one, he also permanently lost the qualifications to log into God’s Domain after that fight. Though, Unrestrained Lionheart wasn’t the only Tier 6 expert to have met with a permanent fall during the war with the Holy Race. Tens of thousands of other Tier 6 experts had met with a similar fate.

“You jest, Mr. Black Flame. I don’t have that kind of ability,” Unrestrained Lionheart said, shaking his head. Then, after a slight pause, he asked in a hopeful tone, “I would like to make a request of you, Mr. Black Flame. The caravan I am escorting is headed to Pharos Town mainly to recruit qualified experts to explore an Ancient God’s ruins that we and the Holy Race coincidentally found.”

“An Ancient God’s ruins? Would such a discovery necessitate such a large mobilization from you?” Shi Feng asked, a puzzled look appearing on his face.

Ruins left behind by an Ancient God might be incredibly rare in the Greater God’s Domain, but for a pseudo-apex power like the Red Dragon Nation, the Guild had already explored over a dozen such ruins. No matter how Shi Feng looked at it, it didn’t make sense for the Red Dragon Nation to react so desperately to an Ancient God’s ruins, so much so that it would be willing to visit different towns to recruit the help of other experts.

In response to Shi Feng’s question, Unrestrained Lionheart shook his head and said, “If these ruins belonged to the average Ancient God, we naturally wouldn’t need to go to such lengths to compete over it. However, our investigation showed that these ruins might belong to someone special.”

“Someone special? Who?” Shi Feng grew even more curious.

“According to our investigation…” Carefully, Unrestrained Lionheart said, “The ruins might have been left behind by the Goddess of Space.”

“The Goddess of Space?!” Shi Feng was startled.

The Goddess of Space might not be a Primordial God, but she was an Ancient God who surpassed many Primordial Gods. Whether it was his homeworld’s Seven Treasures or the Greater God’s Domain’s Seven Luminaries Codex, these powerful items were all closely related to the Goddess of Space.

However, according to Shi Feng’s memories, the Goddess of Space’s ruins should have only been discovered in the Eternal Realm over a year after the Realm had emerged. It was also the only known relic left behind by the Goddess of Space.
