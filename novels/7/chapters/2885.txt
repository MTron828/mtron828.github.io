Chapter 2886 – Mental Strength Master?

When Fang Shihan saw Shi Feng slowly making his way to the plaza, she was stunned. She never thought Shi Feng would confront the enemy!

The enemy had over a dozen half-step grandmaster experts or better on their side. Among the sources of killing intent she sensed, a few even struck fear into her.

Facing so many experts of such caliber, even a Henglian grandmaster would suffer miserably.

This crazy bastard!

Fang Shihan gritted her teeth and followed after Shi Feng She was the Fang family’s young lady. Even the Upper Zone’s organizations would have to show her some respect. If she stood up for Shi Feng, the other party wouldn’t dare go too far lest they incur the Fang family’s wrath.

However, before Fang Shihan could catch up to Shi Feng, 14 people in the crowd approached him. They had concealed their auras so well that they looked no different from ordinary pedestrians; none of the people around them paid them any attention. “Kid, since you’re so eager to die, I’ll grant you your wish!” Elder Qi said when he saw that Shi Feng had already walked into the crowd. Sneering, he commanded, “Everyone, attack!” If Shi Feng had chosen to remain somewhere with little foot traffic, they would quickly get noticed by others if they took action. However, it was a different story in a crowded location like this plaza. With their standards, they could attack Shi Feng without anyone noticing. By the time the bystanders realized what was going on, they would’ve long since left the scene. The distance between both sides continuously shortened.

Thirty meters... Twenty meters... Ten meters...

When the two sides were less than three meters apart, one Henglian grandmaster, one neutralizing grandmaster, and four half-step grandmasters began walking straight toward Shi Feng. The six experts continued moving like ordinary pedestrians, with the four half-step grandmasters even chatting merrily like close friends. Nobody could tell that these six experts were approaching Shi Feng with hostile intentions.

When the four half-step grandmasters were within one meter of Shi Feng, both the four half-step grandmasters and the two true grandmasters took action simultaneously, so fast that ordinary people couldn’t even see their afterimages.

The six experts launched punches, palm strikes, and claw strikes. Aimed at Shi Feng’s vitals, their attacks did not create even the slightest ripple in the air. Although the six experts had different strength levels, their coordination was perfect, and they moved as if they were of one body.

Fang Shihan’s complexion darkened at this scene.

If she were in Shi Feng’s shoes, she could, at best, stop two or three attacks. The rest would land on her without fail.

It might be a different story if a Henglian grandmaster received these attacks, but Shi Feng was only a neutralizing grandmaster. He would most definitely die if he received all these attacks.

However, when the six experts’ attacks were about to land, Shi Feng’s body suddenly twitched and moved like flowing water. As if his various body parts had a mind of their own, they instinctively dodged the six experts’ attacks. Shi Feng’s movements were so fine that he dodged some attacks with less than half a centimeter to spare.

The six experts were startled by this outcome. However, before they could launch another round of attacks, Shi Feng casually scraped his shoulder past one of them and bumped into another. He then executed a punch, an elbow strike, a palm strike, and a kick against his other four opponents. The next moment, the two grandmasters and four half-step grandmasters stiffened and stopped moving. They stood still among the crowd like statues.

When Shi Feng had walked three meters away, the six experts’ eyes rolled back, and their bodies collapsed to the ground.

“This... How is this...possible?”

Fang Shihan’s eyes widened, and her jaw dropped at this scene.

Of the six experts, two were bona fide grandmasters-one of them a Henglian grandmaster. Yet, Shi Feng had taken care of these experts in the blink of an eye. The fight had ended so quickly that she didn’t even see what had happened.

She might’ve been able to accept such an outcome if the two grandmasters were both neutralizing grandmasters. With internal force, Shi Feng could knock them out instantly when his attacks connected. However, knocking out a Henglian grandmaster in one hit was an incredibly difficult feat. Otherwise, Henglian grandmasters wouldn’t be renowned as troublesome opponents.

Fang Shihan wasn’t the only person shocked by this situation. Elder Qi and the other experts similarly tensed up at this scene.

Even they were incapable of defeating Henglian grandmasters in one hit. While Shi Feng might have employed a dirty tactic, there was no denying that he had felled a Henglian grandmaster in one hit.

The remaining experts turned to Elder Qi to seek his opinion on the matter.

Elder Qi was their leader this time. He also possessed incredible strength, being slightly stronger than even the well-known Wang Xuanming. If Elder Qi chose not to attack now, they naturally did not need to attack, either. After all, Shi Feng’s display of strength just now had thoroughly stunned them.

Shi Feng’s feat was even more unbelievable than a person killing an elephant with one punch.

Seeing Shi Feng approaching their group, Elder Qi gritted his teeth and advanced.

Although Elder Qi didn’t know what method Shi Feng employed just now, he was confident he could stop any neutralizing grandmaster’s attack. After all, his mental strength was just a tad short of the mental strength master level. His perception and sixth sense were both much stronger than the average Henglian grandmaster’s.

All tricks were useless against him!

When the other experts saw Elder Qi moving, they quickly followed after him. However, their mentality toward Shi Feng was completely different from before. Now, they had ramped up their vigilance to the max.

Elder Qi’s group of eight split up and approached Shi Feng from eight different directions. They occasionally used the crowd to conceal their bodies and obscure their movements from Shi Feng.

However, Shi Feng remained unfazed and continued approaching Elder Qi casually.

What arrogance! Do you think I’ll fall for your tricks like those fools? Elder Qi accelerated his footsteps when he saw Shi Feng’s indifference, not wanting to give Shi Feng any more time to observe and prepare.

With six grandmasters in their group of eight, they could give even a mental strength master a headache if they attacked together. After all, a mental strength master’s physical fitness was only slightly superior to theirs. What made mental strength masters powerful was their perception of danger and their control over their bodies.

However, when Elder Qi was less than six meters away from Shi Feng, he suddenly lost sight of Shi Feng.

He disappeared?

Elder Qi was stunned as he stared at the spot Shi Feng disappeared from. Shi Feng had vanished not only from his vision but also from his perception. Elder Qi and the seven other experts immediately began looking around frantically, searching for Shi Feng. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Several seconds later, Elder Qi suddenly noticed a figure walking past him, and he was stunned once more.

Shi Feng? However, before Elder Qi could turn around, he felt a stinging pain in his chest. He then found his body paralyzed, and his vision darkened as if death had come for him.

When Elder Qi saw Shi Feng disappearing past him, a thought appeared in his mind, and fear surfaced on his face.

Mental...strength...master!

Apart from Shi Feng being a mental strength master, Elder Qi couldn’t think of any other explanation for this situation. After all, only a mental strength master could evade his perception.

However, before Elder Qi could warn the others, he noticed Shi Feng walking past his approaching companions, one after another. Unlike himself, though, his companions didn’t even notice Shi Feng. And after Shi Feng passed them, their bodies abruptly stiffened. It was evident that they had suffered a similar fate to his.

In the end, Elder Qi could only watch helplessly as his companions collapsed one after another.
