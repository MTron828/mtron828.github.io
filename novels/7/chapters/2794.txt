Chapter 2795 – Dragonheart Island’s Chaos

The waters surrounding Dragonheart Island:

Over a thousand ships were currently scattered around the islands surrounding Dragonheart Island, all bearing the mark of the War Blood adventurer team. Any ship traveling to Dragonheart Island had to submit to War Blood’s inspection. In addition, as Dragonheart Island was enveloped by a sealing magic array, communication between the island and the outside world was impossible. Teleportation into and out of the island was also blocked.

At this time, Dragonheart Island was practically War Blood’s territory.

“Dammit! War Blood is too vicious. We clearly aren’t Heaven’s Blade’s members, yet they charged us three Magic Crystals and twenty Ancient Bronze just for leaving Dragonheart Island!” a Level 114, Tier 2 Berserker driving a speedboat cursed angrily as he watched the departing speedboat belonging to War Blood.

“Shh! Keep your voice down! They still haven’t gone far.” A Level 120, Tier 3 Elementalist on the same speedboat hurriedly covered the angry Berserker’s mouth. He then warned, “War Blood has the final say on everything on Dragonheart Island right now. Even the superpowers have no choice but to go along with War Blood’s whims. We are leaving Dragonheart Island to sell our haul this time. We’ll be finished if we get targeted.” “I wonder what Heaven’s Blade did to anger War Blood to such an extent? Even now, War Blood is still hunting for Heaven’s Blade’s members. The captured members are even sent to be imprisoned by NPCs,” a Level 117, Tier 2 Oracle mused when she saw that War Blood’s speedboat was already more than 300 yards away. “Isn’t that obvious? War Blood’s clearly trying to get Heaven’s Blade’s Lands near the World Tower,” the Berserker said indifferently. “They are discovering more and more treasures in the World Tower’s underground floors right now. The fourth underground floor is especially amazing. However, the abnormal energy in the fourth floor is overwhelming, and the food needed to recover from this energy is incredibly expensive and uneconomical. The only other way to recover quickly is to rest in the special region around the World Tower. “Meanwhile, Heaven’s Blade owns a total of five plots of Land in that special region, including the sole large-sized plot in the special zone and a medium-sized plot. War Blood is currently in a frenzy to expand its influence, so how can it possibly let such a fat piece of meat get away?”

“Indeed. The Lands around the World Tower are in high demand right now. Since War Blood has already forced Heaven’s Blade to disband, it naturally won’t let go of Heaven’s Blade’s Lands. The reason War Blood is capturing Heaven’s Blade’s members is simply to force Heaven’s Blade’s commander to submit and give up those Lands,” the Elementalist youth said, nodding. “However, I doubt Heaven’s Blade will give up so easily. After all, so long as Heaven’s Blade has those five plots of Land, it can make a comeback any time.”

When the players aboard the speedboat spoke of the World Tower, they couldn’t help a sense of yearning for it.

Before the players on Dragonheart Island began exploring the World Tower’s fourth underground floor, they hadn’t placed much importance on the Lands around the World Tower. After all, those Lands were absurdly expensive. Moreover, they were far from Dragonheart Island’s business district. Naturally, nobody had been willing to purchase them.

However, after players began exploring the fourth underground floor, they found that it actually housed Tier 4 Legacy Lands!

As a result, the fourth underground floor was now a bone of contention for all superpowers in God’s Domain.

Unfortunately, there were only 34 plots of Land around the World Tower, which weren’t even enough to divide among the local player forces, let alone the foreign superpowers. Moreover, it turned out that not only did Heaven’s Blade own five plots of Land in that special zone, but the adventurer team had even gotten its hands on the best one. How could this not make the various superpowers and War Blood go crazy?

Before the party of six could continue their conversation, a loud explosion suddenly sounded in the distance. Immediately, the party of six, together with the other players in the vicinity, turned to look toward the origin of the explosion.

The next moment, what entered everyone’s eyes was a group of around 30 cloaked players summoning two Flying Mounts. The two Tier 3 peak experts leading the team worked together and rapidly finished off 20 Tier 3 War Blood experts. Afterward, they each hopped onto a Flying Mount and broke through War Blood’s encirclement together with their team. “It’s Heaven’s Blade’s remnants!”

“Activate the magic array! Don’t let them escape!”

When the nearby War Blood members saw this scene, they promptly sprang into action. Suddenly, the several dozen War Blood speedboats positioned around the two Flying Mounts set up a sealing barrier. It was evident that War Blood’s members were prepared for Heaven’s Blade’s members.

The next moment, before the two Flying Mounts could ascend 200 yards into the air, they were trapped within a magic barrier covering over a thousand yards. The translucent barrier had visible runes decorating it. One could easily tell that it was an Advanced Magic Array at a glance.

If trapped by this barrier, even Tier 4 Mythic monsters would need a lot of time to break out of it, let alone Tier 3 players.

“Dammit!” the female Guardian Knight leading Heaven’s Blade’s team cursed when she saw the barrier, a trace of frustration appearing in her eyes. She then turned to the man standing at the front of the other Flying Mount and asked, “Vice Commander Shadow, what should we do? It’ll take us at least three minutes to break out of this barrier. That’s more than enough time for War Blood’s members to surround us.”

At the Guardian Knight’s words, the man named Divine Shadow standing atop the Flying Serpent frowned. It was clear that he hadn’t expected War Blood to use such a powerful move against them. “We have no choice but to fight. I’ll activate my Berserk Skill and distract them afterward. In the meantime, you guys figure out a way to escape this place,” Divine Shadow said as he looked at War Blood’s approaching experts. He then turned to the female Knight Cleansing Flame and added, “Remember! Do everything you can to leave, even if it means escaping by yourself! Only if you escape will Heaven’s Blade have hope!”

“Yes, sir!” Cleansing Flame answered, a solemn expression appearing on her face.

Now that Heaven’s Blade had already disbanded and War Blood was even hunting down Heaven’s Blade’s members on Dragonheart Island, Heaven’s Blade’s only hope of making a comeback was to seek help from the outside world. With the Deeds of the special zone’s Lands in her hands, it was entirely possible to recruit the help of a Super Guild if they paid a certain price.

However, before Cleansing Flame could control her Flying Serpent to head for the barrier’s edge, a powerful voice echoed in the ears of Heaven’s Blade’s members.

“Escape? Do you think it’s that easy?

“None of you should think of leaving today!”

Before Divine Shadow and Cleansing Flame could react to the situation, a man suddenly appeared in front of them. This crimson-eyed man wore a dark red robe and held a crimson wooden staff. His entire being also gave off an indescribably evil feeling.

Just by hovering in the air, this evil-looking man exerted a powerful pressure on Heaven’s Blade’s members. Divine Shadow and the others felt as if a mountain were weighing down their bodies. They could also feel the Mana surrounding them growing hostile.

“Autumn Plant?!” A hint of confusion appeared in Divine Shadow’s eyes when he saw the crimson-robed man. “Impossible! Shouldn’t you be leading a team to the fourth floor?”

The evil man blocking their team was none other than Autumn Plant, one of War Blood’s Four Great Vice Commanders—as well as War Blood’s sole Tier 4 member. As a Great Wizard, he was an existence capable of destroying half of a small island with one attack.

Previously, Autumn Plant had even single-handedly wiped out tens of thousands of Thirteen Thrones’s experts using a single Tier 4 large-scale destruction Spell. Over twenty of the casualties were Void Realm experts, and three were Domain Realm experts. As a result of this severe loss, Thirteen Thrones had no choice but to back off from competing with War Blood. After this battle, Autumn Plant had also been crowned the undisputed number one player on Dragonheart Island.

Meanwhile, it was because they had caught wind that Autumn Plant had left for the World Tower’s fourth underground floor that they had attempted to escape Dragonheart Island.

Yet, now...

“Hahaha! If I didn’t visit the fourth floor, would you remnants be willing to come out?” Autumn Plant sneered contemptuously as he looked down on Divine Autumn and the others.

“You tricked us!” Divine Shadow clenched his fists in anger. He never thought that he would fall for Autumn Plant’s trap. “We’ve always been rivals in the past. Now that you’ve gotten promoted to Tier 4, I want to see just how strong you’ve become!”

After saying so, Divine Shadow activated his Berserk Skill, his aura skyrocketing to the point of rivaling Tier 4 Mythic monsters. At this time, if comparing purely in terms of aura, Divine Shadow was not the slightest bit inferior to Autumn Plant.

“Fool!”

When Autumn Plant sensed the intensity of Divine Shadow’s aura skyrocketing, his

ssion remained unchanged. Instead, he merely waved his hand.

Before Divine Shadow could react, over a dozen crimson chains appeared out of thin air and bound his body. And despite struggling with all his might, he couldn’t break free from their restraint, no matter what. On the contrary, his resistance weakened as time passed.

“How is this possible?!” Cleansing Flame was stunned.

Divine Shadow was one of Heaven’s Blade’s few Domain Realm experts. With his Berserk Skill activated, logically, he should be able to put up a good fight against a Tier 4 player. Yet, Divine Shadow was captured instantly. Autumn Plant had thoroughly shattered their understanding of Tier 4 existences.

“Hmph. You people don’t know just how massive the gap between Tier 3 and Tier 4 classes is. Do you really think you can turn things around when going up against me?” Looking at Cleansing Flame’s stunned expression, Autumn Plant sneered, “Let alone one Domain Realm expert, even ten Domain Realm experts working together won’t last more than three moves against me.”

Realizing the difference between them, Divine Shadow turned to Cleansing Flame and the others and shouted, “Dammit! Dammit! Everyone, kill yourselves! Don’t let him capture you!”

“Don’t even think you can kill yourselves so easily!” Autumn Plant said, brandishing his staff.

The next moment, blood-red chains appeared from the void and bound Cleansing Flame and the others, preventing them from moving their bodies at all. The difference between the two sides was clear for all to see.

“How can a Tier 4 class be so powerful?!”

Divine Shadow and the others stared at Autumn Plant with disbelief.

They had seen Shi Feng’s battle video during the reserve seat competition at the War God’s Temple. In their opinion, although Tier 4 players were powerful, they were not an insurmountable opponent. However, they actually couldn’t offer even the slightest resistance to Autumn Plant. The strength Autumn Plant displayed far surpassed Shi Feng’s.

While Heaven’s Blade’s members were shocked by the massive gap in strength between them and Autumn Plant, War Blood’s other members caught up with them and secured them.

“Alright, take them to the NPCs.” Looking at Divine Shadow and the other remnants of Heaven’s Blade, Autumn Plant smiled and said, “Now that we’ve caught two big fish, I refuse to believe that Zwei won’t submit!”

“It’s over! It’s over! Everything’s over this time!” Divine Shadow fell into despair when he saw Heaven’s Blade’s captured members. “I’ve truly doomed you guys this time!”

The only reason why they had decided to take on such a risky operation this time was the misinformation he had believed. Now, everyone was doomed because of his foolishness.

After all, if players were imprisoned by NPCs, nothing would change even if they forcibly logged out of the game; they would still reappear in prison after they logged back into the game. Unless they could break out, they would have to spend at least 15 days in prison.

A 15-day gap was more than enough for everyone to fall far behind God’s Domain’s frontline players.

However, as Divine Shadow was falling into a pit of despair and self-reproach, a Horned Eagle carrying four people suddenly came flying over from a distance. To everyone’s surprise, the Horned Eagle actually sported Heaven’s Blade’s flag extremely conspicuously.

“More remnants of Heaven’s Blade? Seeing as they have a Horned Eagle, it seems another big fish has arrived.” Autumn Plant’s lips curled up in delight when he saw the Horned Eagle.

Meanwhile, this unexpected situation also confused Divine Shadow and the others. They couldn’t understand why one of Heaven’s Blade’s Horned Eagles would be flying to them from outside Dragonheart Island. However, when they recalled Autumn Plant’s capabilities, they immediately began shouting at the people riding the Horned Eagle to escape.

Although Tier 4 players could fly, their flying speed wasn’t comparable to Flying Mounts. Hence, it was still possible to escape if the Horned Eagle flew at full speed.

“Escape? Do you think that’s possible?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After saying so, Autumn Plant used Instantaneous Movement and rapidly approached the Horned Eagle.

A Tier 4 Great Wizard’s Instantaneous Movement had a range of 3,000 yards, many times superior to a Tier 3 Great Mage’s Instantaneous Movement.
