Chapter 434 - Free Combat System

“Big Brother Summer, it’s great that you are willing to help, but the opponent is very hard to take down. We might even miss out on our chance to kill the Great Lord. I’m worried that it will affect Big Brother Summer’s task.” Youlan was familiar with the lean man’s strength, and she appreciated his assistance.

The lean man was Summer Sunshine. Not only was he unrelated to Underworld, but he was also an independent player. However, due to his backing and his overwhelming strength, even Feng Xuanyang attempted to build a strong relationship with him.

Youlan had once witnessed a fraction of Summer Sunshine’s strength.

Before entering White Fog Canyon, Summer Sunshine had fought Underworld’s pride, the leader of the Underworld Guards, Ming Sha, in a PvP. In the end, however, Ming Sha lasted only five moves against Summer Sunshine. Moreover, Summer Sunshine had not used any skills, relying on basic attacks to defeat his opponent.

The results of that fight had surprised everyone.

As a member of Underworld, Youlan knew full well how strong Ming Sha was. He was one of the few great experts in Underworld. Gentle Snow of Ouroboros was only slightly stronger than him.

However, such an expert was nothing more than a child to Summer Sunshine.

One could just imagine how powerful the Assassin was.

If Summer Sunshine was willing to lend a hand, they had a fairly good chance of defeating One-hit Asura Black Flame.

“It won’t take long to deal with the Great Lord. I don’t mind delaying our attack for a little bit. In any case, I am bored. If you need help with something, just ask,” Summer Sunshine laughed.

“Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame, has killed many of our elite members. We want to return the favor and kill him. Would you be interested in helping us with this, I wonder?” Youlan asked softly as she stared at Summer Sunshine.

“Black Flame?” Summer Sunshine nodded, saying, “Alright. I’ve heard many rumors about him when I was in White River City. I hear that he’s pretty amazing and has the title of One-hit Asura. He is even Star-Moon Kingdom’s number one expert. I’d love to exchange a few moves with him. If I kill him, won’t I become Star-Moon Kingdom’s number one expert?”

“Of course! If you kill Black Flame, you will officially become Star-Moon Kingdom’s number one expert. However, don’t underestimate him. He once killed Ming Sha with one hit. We need to plan carefully to avoid Black Flame escaping.” When Youlan received Summer Sunshine’s answer, the tension between her brows loosened, a few ideas of how to deal with Black Flame already brewing.

“He killed Ming Sha with one hit? Not bad. My last fight with Ming Sha wasn’t even a warm-up. I wonder if Black Flame is strong enough to take seriously?” Summer Sunshine licked his lips, a hint of excitement flashing in his eyes. “As for your plans, forget about them. As long as we find him, I have my own ways to prevent him from escaping.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Big Brother Summer, Black Flame has a large-scale silencing skill. If he discovers us and activates the skill, trapping him will be very difficult. It is best if we have a plan to silence Black Flame,” Youlan reminded.

“Don’t worry. I have something better than that. When I see him, I’ll trap him like a bug in a jar,” Summer Sunshine laughed. Confidently, he said, “Let’s hunt down Black Flame. Since he has provoked and angered you, you can watch as I take care of him.”

Following which, Youlan immediately sent a large number of players to search for Black Flame. Meanwhile, Overwhelming Smile’s army also slowly withdrew from the Ruined Shrine.

At the entrance of the Starfire Mine, Shi Feng and the others tidied up the loot scattered across the ground.

When Shi Feng had activated Firestorm, not only had he wiped out the players, but he had also dealt with all of the Level 27 Special Elite ranked Flame Furbolgs that had emerged from the mine.

With the Flame Furbolgs’ drops accompanying the items from players, weapons, equipment, and materials littered the area in front of the mine.

“The elite members of Overwhelming Smile sure are poor. The majority of their weapons and equipment are Level 20 Bronze and Mysterious-Iron ranked. There are only two pieces of Secret-Silver Equipment. The Flame Furbolgs dropped more Secret-Silver Equipment than those elites,” Blackie commented after they had finished collecting the items. He could not help but sympathize with the elites of Overwhelming Smile.

The loot from the players versus the Flame Furbolgs was easy to differentiate, as one group had only dropped Level 20 items, while the other had only dropped Level 25 items.

The Flame Furbolgs had dropped four pieces of Level 25 Secret-Silver Equipment alone, which was the equivalent of four pieces of Level 20 Fine-Gold Equipment. To God’s Domain’s players currently, Fine-Gold Equipment was top-tier equipment, whereas Dark-Gold Equipment was the cream of the crop. As for Epic items, they were the stuff of legends.

Meanwhile, if an ordinary player joined Zero Wing around Level 10 and completed their Guild Quests each day, they could trade their Guild Points in for a piece of Mysterious-Iron Equipment by the time they reached Level 20. If they were lucky and managed to join a party to complete advanced Guild Quests, they might even have enough points for three or four pieces of Secret-Silver Equipment. More than half an elite’s equipment would be Secret-Silver rank at the very least.

On the other hand, the equipment Overwhelming Smile’s elite members wore was mostly a mix of Bronze and Mysterious-Iron rank. Practically none of them had any Secret-Silver Equipment. They could not compare with Zero Wing’s members.

Furthermore, Level 25 weapons and equipment were now available for Zero Wing members. This was unheard of in any other Guild.

Any Level 25 equipment obtained by the other Guilds would be prioritized to their core members. These items would never be available for their ordinary members.

Compared to Level 25 Secret-Silver and Fine-Gold Equipment, the benefits that Overwhelming Smile offered were a joke.

After organizing the loot, Shi Feng had the two recently-resurrected members take the dropped weapons and equipment back to the Guild. As for Aqua Rose and the others, they all entered the Starfire Mine and started mining.

The Starfire Mine was a naturally occurring maze. Moreover, when wandering inside the mine, the players were often ambushed by groups of three to five Flame Furbolgs. As a result, Shi Feng’s team progressed slowly.

The Flame Furbolgs were Level 27 Special Elites. Their Strength was frighteningly high, and they could send a Berserker of the same level flying with a single hit. Although they were somewhat slow, the Flame Furbolgs also had an AOE control skill called War Stomp. When activated, all enemies within a radius of 8 yards would be placed in a Fainted state for four seconds. In this narrow cave, avoiding this skill was not easy.

Normally, a party had no chance against these Flame Furbolgs. At the very least, they needed a larger team and the willingness to make sacrifices to get rid of these Special Elites.

Unfortunately for the Flame Furbolgs, the opponent was Shi Feng.

Moreover, there were also the Tier 1 Assassins, Fire Dance and Flying Shadow, and the unpredictable Astromancer, Violet Cloud.

Before Shi Feng and the others, the Flame Furbolg’s 70,000 HP was only decoration.

Shi Feng and the others were Tier 1 classes. They were only slightly inferior to the Special Elites.

After activating the Aura of Fire, Shi Feng could easily deal over -1,000 damage with every attack. When he used the Tier 1 Chop, he could deal over -6,000 damage, over -10,000 damage if he achieved a critical hit.

As for the Flame Furbolg’s War Stomp, the skill was child’s play to an expert.

Faced with groups of three to five Flame Furbolgs, Shi Feng’s party of six could either incapacitate the monsters throughout the altercation or kill them swiftly with brute force, preventing them from activating War Stomp either way.

Shi Feng’s group continued to delve into the mine, their experience bars rising quickly.

The EXP earned from killing a Level 27 Special Elite was already abundant. There was also the bonus EXP due to the level difference and the fact that there were only six players in the party to share the EXP. Most importantly, there were a lot of Flame Furbolgs, and no matter how many the party killed, more awaited them further in the mine. They leveled faster here than when they had killed Lord ranked monsters in a team of 500 players. On top of everything else, they also obtained plenty of Level 25 equipment.

After Shi Feng and the others had killed Flame Furbolgs in the Starfire Mine for over three hours, the group arrived at a wide and beautiful crystal cavern. A gigantic flaming star took up the center of this cavern.

The moment Shi Feng set foot in the crystal cavern, a system notification suddenly rang out.
