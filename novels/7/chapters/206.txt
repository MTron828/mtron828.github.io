Chapter 207 - Killing the Queen

Shi Feng did not want this timeline to develop out of his control. If Stabbing Heart really wanted to raid one of the three great Dungeons...

He could only sternly refuse.

Stabbing Heart shook his head, faintly exclaiming, “It isn’t one of the three great Dungeons. It is just one of the 20-man Team Dungeons, the Beastman Munition Factory. That is a Level 10 to Level 13 Team Dungeon, and the equipment dropped there would be of great help to us when we raid the three large-scale Dungeons. Although we’ve already cleared the Normal Mode of that Dungeon, the Hard Mode is simply too difficult. We have been stuck at the first Boss all this time, so we wished to seek your aid.”

Shi Feng’s heart was slightly moved when he heard of the words “Beastman Munition Factory.” That Dungeon did indeed possess a lot of valuable items, especially the Basic Fire Resistance Potion Recipe and the Level 10 Swordsman Set Equipment, Wind Extinguisher.

It would not be a bad idea to make a trip there for these items.

“Fine, but I have a demand,” Shi Feng said.

“Brother Ye Feng, there is no need to hold back!” Stabbing Heart released a sigh of relief after hearing Shi Feng’s agreement. He was deeply afraid that Shi Feng would refuse.

“I want all the Recipes and Forging Designs we obtain from the Dungeon. In addition, I want priority over all Swordsman equipment. If you can agree to these conditions, I will have no problem offering my assistance,” Shi Feng listed his demands.

Stabbing Heart carefully considered Shi Feng’s words. If he were the one leading the team this time, he wouldn’t hesitate to agree to Shi Feng’s demands. However, the leader of the team this time was the Guild Leader of the Assassin’s Alliance, Cruel Sword. So, Stabbing Heart had no authority to make this decision.

“Brother Ye Feng, I have to consult with the Guild Leader about this matter. Can I give you a reply sometime later?” Stabbing Heart said with less confidence.

“Sure.” In any case, Shi Feng was not in a hurry. There was still some time before he could kill the Scorching Lamia.

After Stabbing Heart disconnected the call, he immediately went up to the Guild Leader, Cruel Sword. Cruel Sword was currently a short distance away, clearing the monsters in the Dungeon.

Based on appearance alone, Cruel Sword looked very young, and his tall and robust body seemed full of energy. In actuality, he was already 39 years old. Normally, he wore a stern expression, and he would always look at others with an intimidating and penetrating gaze. His ferocious appearance was just like that of a warrior about to enter a battlefield.

In fact, Cruel Sword was a mercenary in reality. However, he had long since retired from his squad. After his retirement, he joined the then-weak Assassin’s Alliance, and after enduring over ten years of hardships, he finally managed to turn the Assassin’s Alliance into an apex second-rate Guild, gaining plenty of support and sponsors from large corporations.

“How did your negotiations with him go?” Cruel Sword turned his head and glanced at Stabbing Heart, asking sternly.

Previously, the Assassin’s Alliance had been stuck at the first Boss of the Hard Mode Beastman Munition Factory. Hence, Stabbing Heart suggested recruiting a god-ranked expert to help them. However, Cruel Sword felt that it was beneath him to do such a thing. What god-ranked expert? Everyone’s just blindly overestimating him.

If it weren’t for the fact that Stabbing Heart had performed extremely well in recent days and been promoted to an elder of the Guild, Cruel Sword would not have let Stabbing Heart contact Shi Feng at all.

“He agrees to come, but he has a demand. He wants all of the Swordsman equipment and the Forging Designs and Recipes that drop.” Stabbing Heart carefully said, “However, I feel that Ye Feng is worth this price. After all, even the Snow Goddess greatly valued his performance.”

After listening to these words, Cruel Sword’s coarse eyebrows furrowed. He clearly felt dissatisfied about Shi Feng’s demands.

“Boss Cruel Sword, Ye Feng is truly powerful. Without Shi Feng, the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow, might not have even obtained the First Clear of the Dark Moon Graveyard,” Stabbing Heart hurriedly said.

“Gentle Snow, is it?” Cruel Sword’s resolve slightly wavered after hearing this name.

Just half an hour ago, Gentle Snow had shocked all players throughout the entire White River City region, Cruel Blade included.

Gentle Snow had taken down the First Clear of four Level 10 Party Dungeons and two Level 10 small-scale Team Dungeons. Moreover, it wasn’t the First Clear of Hard Mode, but the First Clear of Hell Mode.

Simultaneously, her achievements signified the gap between her and the other Guilds growing even larger.

Moreover, Cruel Sword received information that Gentle Snow had already begun raiding the Hell Mode of a 20-man Team Dungeon. If Gentle Snow really succeeded...

She would no longer occupy the same playing field as the other Guilds within the White River City region.

“It seems that Ye Feng indeed has some capabilities. Since that is the case, agree to his demands.” Cruel Sword was very curious about Shi Feng now. He wondered if Shi Feng was truly as strong as Stabbing Heart described him.

In truth, Cruel Sword did not want any outsiders participating in the Guild’s expedition. However, the Assassin’s Alliance’s position in White River City was becoming more insignificant as time passed.

Ignoring the first-rate Guild, Ouroboros, even the third-rate Guild, Dark Star, would soon surpass them. The severity of this matter further increased due to the sudden appearance of that Lone Tyrant, who occupied the first position on the Ranking List. Dark Star then continued to successfully raid the Hard Mode of two small-scale Team Dungeons, greatly increasing their fame and surpassing the other Guilds.

On the other hand, aside from obtaining the First Clear of several Normal Mode Dungeons, the Assassin’s Alliance had yet to even obtain the First Clear of a single Hard Mode Dungeon. Hence, Cruel Sword had personally organized an elite team to raid the Beastman Munition Factory. He intended to take this chance to obtain the First Clear of a Hard Mode Dungeon, increasing the Guild’s influence in White River City and ending the gossip of Assassin’s Alliance’s inferiority to Dark Star.

Hearing Cruel Sword’s command, Stabbing Heart immediately contacted Shi Feng, excited.

“Brother Ye Feng, our Guild Leader has agreed to your demands. I wonder if you can come here immediately?” Stabbing Heart asked.

At this moment, Shi Feng still battled the Scorching Lamia, so how could he possibly leave now? Making a rough estimate, he said, “I still have some matters to attend to right now. I’ll need around two hours before I can hurry over.”

“Alright, then let’s meet up at the entrance of the Beastman Munition Factory in two hours.” Although Stabbing Heart wanted Shi Feng to arrive as soon as possible, Stabbing Heart did not dare insist on the matter since Shi Feng had his own matters to attend. After all, it was already stunning that Shi Feng would willingly help them out.

“Alright. I’ll be there in two hours.” Shi Feng disconnected the call, resuming his barrage of attacks on Cela.

Just after the Scorching Lamia’s HP fell below 20%, a change suddenly overcame her previously beautiful appearance. Crimson-red sacred runes suddenly appeared on her jade-white skin, releasing a frightening magic power. Moreover, her red gemstone-like eyes released a brilliant white light.

Immediately, the Flame God’s Cave trembled. Cracks appeared on the ground, and very quickly, these cracks widened into large fissures that spewed molten magma. The lava formed a river as it moved and spread throughout the ground.

This was the Scorching Lamia’s strongest skill.

Queen’s Rage!

Fortunately, Shi Feng had long since lured Cela to this location. Otherwise, the lava that spewed from the ground would not be limited to a single river; it would form a great ocean that could instantly turn tens of thousands of players into ashes, becoming fertilizer for this great piece of land.

Immediately, Shi Feng activated Gravity Liberation. He jumped up into the air, and like a cannonball, he shot forth towards a rock wall some ten meters away, successfully avoiding the incoming surge of lava.

Approximately half a minute passed before the lava fully receded. However, the land was still dyed a crimson-red, releasing piping-hot steam into the air and the surrounding environment. If an average player set foot on this land, they would lose at least 500 HP every second in the best case scenario.

However, Shi Feng was different. He had 123 points in Fire Resistance, so he could completely ignore the ground’s high temperature. After he landed, he immediately resumed his attacks on the Scorching Lamia.

It was extremely exhausting for Cela to cast Queen’s Rage. So, after using the skill, she would enter a period of weakness. During this period, she would not have any Attack Power remaining, and it was the best time for Shi Feng to kill her.

If Shi Feng waited for the land to recover its normal state, the Scorching Lamia would have also recovered from her weakened state. In addition, her HP would also recover to 30% or above.

The Scorching Lamia in a weakened state stood no chance against Shi Feng.

The Blazing Meteor caused over -1,500 damage to Cela with every strike, with the occasional critical hit causing over -3,000 damage.

18%... 16%... 14%... 12%...

By the time the Scorching Lamia had broken away from her weakened state, she only had 10% of her HP remaining.

In the end, the Scorching Lamia entered a berserk state, and her damage increased by several folds. However, with Shi Feng’s Frost Grenades controlling her movements from beginning to end, Cela could not display her frightening might in melee combat at all.

After another ten minutes or so, the Scorching Lamia released a blood-curdling scream as her body fell to the ground.

Instantly, Shi Feng’s level increased by one, reaching 17% of Level 16. The bountiful EXP even shocked Shi Feng.

Shi Feng then heard the sound of an explosion, and a large amount of Flame Crystals, equipment, and items appeared in place of the Scorching Lamia’s body.
