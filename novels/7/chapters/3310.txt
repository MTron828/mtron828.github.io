When Storm saw that her magic barrier was active, she promptly waved her staff and shouted, “Thunder Realm’s Descent!”

…

On the floating island…

As soon as Storm finished speaking, a magic barrier that covered a 1,000-yard radius appeared around Shi Feng, thunderbolts constantly striking the inside of the barrier. Every thunderbolt carried as much power as the Thunder God’s Spear previously used by Storm, and these thunderbolts easily numbered more than 300.

Upon sensing the devastating power the thunderbolts carried, even the Four Beast Warriors spectating from a distance, couldn’t help but shudder. Although the four of them had already become Tier 5 players, they knew they couldn’t survive this move, even if all four of them worked together.

Tier 5 players might have a much stronger physique than Tier 4 players, but even a Tier 5 player would be fortunate if they could defend against 100 of these thunderbolts simultaneously. The fact that Thunder Realm could let its user launch over 300 attacks simultaneously was also why, despite having weaker-than-average raw power compared to other Tier 5 Curses, it was still labeled as a Curse.

However, thanks to the Grandmaster Barrier created by Storm, every one of her Thunder Realm’s 300-plus lightning bolts now carried power at the Tier 6 standard. Even Tier 6 experts would feel their scalps going numb when going up against such an attack, let alone Tier 5 players.

Is this the strength of the conglomerate’s core paragons? Meteor was in awe as he watched Storm controlling over 300 lightning arcs.

Until this point, Meteor had always been confident he could enter the ranks of the Paimon Conglomerate’s core paragons in the future. After all, he was currently already considered a paragon among the conglomerate’s internal members. However, after seeing Storm’s performance, his confidence started to waver because he realized that the gap between him and an actual core paragon was unbelievably huge.

At this time, Meteor even had a feeling that Storm could already go up against the Tier 6 experts of corporations in her current state.

With her ability to manipulate over 300 lightning bolts carrying power at the Tier 6 standard, it wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to say that Storm was a Goddess of Thunder!

Meanwhile, after seeing the barrier taking shape, Saint Arm promptly fled out of it, not daring to stay within it for even a moment longer. Although Storm could manipulate the thunderbolts in the magic barrier, she had to manage over 300 thunderbolts at all times. If she mismanaged them and he got hit by a few, he would still be vaporized, even if he was a Shield Warrior.

When Storm saw that Saint Arm had exited the barrier, she looked at Shi Feng and smiled, saying, “You can take pride in the fact that you got me to use Thunder Realm’s Descent.”

After saying so, Storm pointed at Shi Feng, and all 300-plus lightning bolts in the barrier transformed into agile serpents that attacked Shi Feng from all directions.

At this time, even White Owl and Laura, who were fighting in the distant sky, couldn’t help but glance at Storm’s Thunder Realm’s Descent.

“If you’re thinking of saving him, you best go now before it’s too late,” White Owl said, grinning as she looked at Laura. “Otherwise, he might very well suffer Soul Annihilation at Storm’s hands.”

Tier 6 attacks already had the power to heavily damage Tier 5 Immortal Souls. If Storm could land all 300-plus of her thunderbolts, she could even annihilate a Tier 5 Immortal Soul, let alone a Tier 4 Immortal Soul.

This was also why White Owl had chosen to bring Storm into the Miniature Ancient World with her.

Do I help him?

Laura couldn’t help but grow a little worried when she saw Storm’s attacks. Honestly, even she would have difficulty dodging all 300-plus thunderbolt attacks, let alone Shi Feng, who wasn’t even a Tier 5 player. Yet, if she tried to save Shi Feng, White Owl definitely wouldn’t let such a good opportunity slip.

Currently, although Laura could suppress White Owl, that was because of her slight advantage in Strength. When it came to Movement Speed, Attack Speed, and reaction speed, they were about evenly matched. So, if she let herself get distracted by Storm’s thunderbolts, White Owl would have a great chance of killing her.

Yet, if Laura didn’t save Shi Feng, Storm’s attack might really extinguish Shi Feng’s soul.

While Laura was hesitating about what to do, Shi Feng, who was inside the magic barrier, suddenly smiled.

“You call this Thunder Realm’s Descent? I’ll show you what a true Thunder Realm’s Descent looks like!”

After saying so, Shi Feng had the nine frost swords insert themselves into the ground and form a magic barrier around him. Meanwhile, he drew a series of divine runes with his left hand and had these runes merge themselves with the space around him.

Once the divine runes merged with the surrounding space, the 300-plus lightning serpents started to actively avoid Shi Feng as if afraid of him. Although the lightning serpents continued to linger around Shi Feng, none dared to touch him…

Impossible!

Storm was dumbfounded when she saw her attacks failing to harm Shi Feng in the slightest. She had launched over 300 attacks at the Tier 6 standard, but none managed to damage Shi Feng. Moreover, it looked like Shi Feng had used less effort to neutralize these attacks than when he neutralized her Thunder God’s Spear.

…

Is he really just a Tier 4 Sword Emperor? Trecht’s mouth turned into a big ‘O’ shape as he looked at Shi Feng.

Although Shi Feng was currently wearing a Black Cloak to hide his personal information, the life aura he exuded clearly indicated that he was only a Tier 4 player. But could a Tier 4 Sword Emperor really resist 300-plus Tier 6 attacks?

Was he hiding his strength the last time we fought?

Platinum Behemoth, who had previously fought Shi Feng in the Thunder Restaurant, also gaped in shock at this sight.

While everyone outside the magic barrier was looking at Shi Feng in shock, Shi Feng raised his hand and created one magic array after another before him. With each magic array Shi Feng created, the mana in the magic barrier also grew denser.

“I’ve seen your moves already, so it’s your turn to see mine now!”

Suddenly, everyone outside the barrier felt a change in Storm’s magic barrier. Before anyone could determine what had happened, the lightning serpents lingering around Shi Feng suddenly merged into one big ball.

Had Storm and Saint Arm opted to attack him together without using any fancy moves, Shi Feng would have indeed had difficulty tackling them. He might not even last long against them. After all, the Winter of Eternal Night could only remain at the Legendary rank for a limited time.

However, it was a different story now that Storm had set up a magic barrier.

In the entire Greater God’s Domain, no expert would dare to use magic barriers against a Great Grandmaster Magician. This was because doing so was akin to suicide.

Subsequently, once the numerous lightning serpents finished merging into one big ball of lightning, the lightning sphere gradually transformed into a lightning dragon that measured several hundred meters in length. The lightning dragon was also vastly stronger than the lightning serpents from before.

“Go!” Shi Feng said as he pointed at the elven woman standing over a thousand yards away.

As if understanding Shi Feng’s words, the lightning dragon bellowed at Storm and flapped its wings. Despite being Thunder Realm’s caster, Storm could not exert any control over the lightning dragon created from her Thunder Realm.

Before anyone could react, the massive lightning dragon shot through the magic barrier and devoured Storm in the blink of an eye. Then, the lightning dragon disappeared along with its creator, leaving behind only a piece of equipment…
