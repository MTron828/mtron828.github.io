Chapter 471 - It is Difficult to Breed True Dragons in Shallow Waters

Two hundred Gold Coins!

The crowd immediately fell silent. Everyone turned to Aqua Rose, the Rose Goddess who had left the first-rate Guild Twilight Echo.

“She’s insane!”

“Spending 200 Gold Coins just to garner some fame is foolish!”

“Does the Guild behind her really possess so much money that they can disregard 200 Gold?”

Every representative had their own speculation. Some believed that Aqua Rose was trying to use the money to buy fame, while some believed that the Guild supporting her possessed an extraordinary background. However, regardless of the reasons behind her actions, everyone’s admiration for Aqua Rose grew.

Every Guild here could afford to spend 200 Gold. After all, before Shi Feng had started his auction, he had required that anyone who wanted to trade with him must first carry 1,000 Gold on them. If not for the 1,000 Gold in their bags, they would not be so shameless as to participate in the auction. Every Guild in this restaurant was a reputable major power. If others discovered that they did not have 1,000 Gold in their bags, it would tarnish their Guild’s reputation.

However, although they had the money, they would not spend it on useless items. They would only buy that which had value to their Guilds. After all, their members had struggled to earn every Gold Coin. Nobody wanted to be played for a fool.

The three Super Guild representatives were also silent. They looked at Aqua Rose with curiosity, confused as to what the Rose Goddess was attempting to do.

“Two hundred Gold going once!” Shi Feng watched the calm and composed Aqua Rose, silently praising her performance.

He had to admit that Aqua Rose’s confident smile even led him to believe that 200 Gold was no different from spare change to her.

“Two hundred Gold going twice!”

Just as Shi Feng shouted the second time, Brilliant Wargod suddenly shouted, “201 Gold. This young master wants it.”

“Two hundred ten Gold,” Aqua Rose said as she glared at Brilliant Wargod, disgust and hatred filling her eyes.

“Two hundred eleven Gold,” Brilliant Wargod sneered.

Although he was not particularly interested in the Dragonscale Set Equipment, he could not stomach letting Aqua Rose garner fame in front of this crowd. If that happened, it would wound his reputation. Hence, he could not allow Aqua Rose to have the Dragonscale Set Equipment, allowing her to enjoy the limelight.

“Three hundred Gold.”

Done wasting time, Aqua Rose significantly raised the bid. The other Guild representatives were stunned. The three Super Guild representatives shook their heads helplessly.

The price was simply too high.

Previously, everyone had believed that Aqua Rose would never rise without the help of Twilight Echo. Yet, Aqua Rose’s current performance was more domineering than during her time in Twilight Echo. She was no less imposing than Ouroboros’s Guild Leader, the Snow Goddess Gentle Snow.

They could not understand why Twilight Echo had discarded Aqua Rose.

Brilliant Wargod’s heart trembled upon hearing this bid. Gritting his teeth, he shouted, “301 Gold.”

It had not been easy for the Guild to raise the 1,000 Gold he had on him right now, and part of the money had been taken from the funds set aside for Twilight Echo’s Guild Residence. If he spent 300 Gold here, it would undoubtedly delay the purchase of the Guild Residence by one or two days.

“Four hundred Gold!” Aqua Rose shouted without flinching. She then shot Brilliant Wargod a disdainful look.

None of these representatives were fools. They could tell that, rather than purchasing an item, Brilliant Wargod and Aqua Rose currently competed via wealth. However, when they saw Aqua Rose’s resolve as she called out a bid of 400 Gold, they could not help but admire the Rose Goddess.

Just what kind of financial power did she possess to ignore 400 Gold?

“You!” Seeing Aqua Rose’s contemptuous glance, Brilliant Wargod had never felt such humiliation. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and shouted, “Aqua Rose! Don’t even think of taking what’s mine! So what if you’ve bid 400 Gold? I bid 500 Gold!”

“Five hundred Gold going once!”

“Five hundred Gold going twice!”

...

As Shi Feng announced the price, Brilliant Wargod’s anxiety grew. He was deeply afraid that Aqua Rose would place an even higher bid. At that time, he would have to raise his bid even further. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Only when Shi Feng shouted the third time did Brilliant Wargod reveal a victorious smile. He then shifted his gaze towards Aqua Rose, smirking at the woman with pride.

“Five hundred Gold,” Shi Feng said as he walked up to Brilliant Wargod, placing the Dragonscale Set Equipment in front of the man. He did not care about whatever thoughts occupied Brilliant Wargod’s mind.

When the crowd watched Brilliant Wargod hand over 500 Gold in exchange for the Dragonscale Set Equipment, envy, admiration, and disdain filled their hearts. However, they admitted that the Dragonscale Set Equipment was currently the only Level 20 Fine-Gold Set Equipment available in God’s Domain. Although it was somewhat foolish to spend 500 Gold, once they had the Dragonscale Set Equipment, the profits they could reap with it might exceed 500 Gold.

Thinking up to this point, the various Guild representatives felt somewhat regretful. Why had they not competed over the set? What if they could gain far more than 500 Gold with the use of this set?

After obtaining the Dragonscale Set Equipment, a sense of indescribable joy filled Brilliant Wargod’s heart as he watched the silent Aqua Rose. However, before he could ridicule the woman, Shi Feng suddenly spoke again.

“Let’s begin the auction for the second item, then. The auctioned item is another Dragonscale Set Equipment. Like before, the starting bid is 100 Gold with minimum increments of 1 Gold.” Saying so, Shi Feng placed another Dragonscale Set Equipment on the table.

“You... How... Why do you have a second!?” Brilliant Wargod felt his heart shatter when he saw an exact copy of the Dragonscale Set Equipment he had just purchased.

“Who said I only had one set?” Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Brilliant Wargod before proceeding with the auction.

Brilliant Wargod’s elation deflated. When he saw Aqua Rose’s laughing expression, he even had the thought of killing himself[1]...

When the crowd saw the second Dragonscale Set Equipment on the table, they all glanced at their fellow representatives. Nobody had expected Shi Feng to have a second set. The regret that they had felt immediately vanished.

They had somewhat admired Brilliant Wargod for spending 500 Gold to purchase the first Level 20 Fine-Gold Set Equipment in God’s Domain. Now, however, that admiration turned into ridicule.

“150 Gold!”

“I bid 155 Gold!”

Previously, everyone had felt that 100 Gold was too expensive. Now, however, multiple Guilds simultaneously began the bid with 150 Gold.

However, just like before, Aqua Rose immediately dashed everyone’s hopes by bidding 200 Gold. This time, the three Super Guild representatives did not hesitate as they shouted higher bids.

Items of rarity were expensive. It was especially true during the early stages of God’s Domain. Just a single piece of equipment could significantly affect the future development of a Guild, not to mention a Fine-Gold Set Equipment.

In the end, Aqua Rose purchased the second Dragonscale Set Equipment at 280 Gold. The many Guild representatives envied and admired her. Simultaneously, they also could not help but acknowledge that Aqua Rose was really amazing. Even after leaving Twilight Echo, she was still so well-off. One could just imagine how capable she was. On the other hand, Twilight Echo had been so blind as to chase Aqua Rose out of the Guild.

As everyone admired Aqua Rose, interest in her Guild also began to grow.

It was difficult to breed a true dragon in shallow waters. Aqua Rose was undoubtedly a true dragon. No ordinary Guild would be good enough to catch her eye.

Soon, Shi Feng took out the third Dragonscale Set Equipment, rendering the crowd utterly speechless. They had even started to suspect that the Dragonscale Set Equipment was some kind of common good that could be purchased anywhere.

However, nobody complained. On the contrary, they all were elated because they had another chance to compete. Shi Feng had never mentioned how many sets he had on hand. What if this one was the last?

Hence, everyone gritted their teeth and placed their bids. In the end, Swallow Nine won the third set for 291 Gold.

Following which, Shi Feng revealed the fourth set, which Sanctuary’s Flourishing Colors won for 303 Gold. Thunder Tiger of King’s Return won the fifth set for 322 Gold, whereas a first-rate Guild purchased the sixth set for 337 Gold. Initially, everyone had believed that Shi Feng would reveal the seventh set. In the end, however, Shi Feng announced that the sixth was the last he had on him. This revelation had caused the crowd to regret not bidding higher.

None of the Guilds had cared much for obtaining a Fine-Gold Set Equipment when no one else had owned one. However, now that some Guilds had obtained one, things had changed. It was highly possible that due to the Dragonscale Set Equipment, these Guilds would take the lead in conquering Level 20 large-scale Team Dungeons. At that time, these Guilds would gain a massive advantage over the others.
