Chapter 2658 – Power of Tier 4 Concentration

When Shi Feng activated Miniature World, the sky above the desert woodland darkened as if night had fallen.

Immediately, everyone on the battlefield felt their perception of their surroundings vanish. It was as if they had been plunked into a pitch-black void with nothing in it. Moreover, aside from the players, even the fleeing Faux Saint monsters came to a halt and aimlessly turned their heads left and right, their eyes brimming with fear and confusion.

Shortly afterward, a colorful brilliance descended from the sky, the lights giving off a sacred and majestic feeling.

Spectators at a distance would see a gigantic rainbow barrier enveloping the entire desert woodland outside Silverwing Town. This rainbow barrier thoroughly isolated the woodland from the outside world, making the woodland look like a mirage.

Meanwhile, beneath this colorful brilliance, the Faux Saint monsters started wailing in agony, one after another, their screams echoing throughout the woodland. At the same time, the intense aura they radiated waned rapidly, and even their Basic Attributes and reaction speed weakened to an unbelievable degree. It was as if these Faux Saint monsters that everyone originally feared had become Common monsters.

Seeing this scene, everyone on the battlefield was stunned.

“Isn’t this a little too strong?! He actually debuffed several thousand Faux Saint monsters to such an extent in an instant! Who is this guy?!”

The various adventurer teams escorting merchant fleets and the patrol army fending off the Faux Saint monsters stared at Shi Feng in astonishment.

They had seen many instances of magic arrays suppressing monsters before, but this was the first time they had seen a magic array produce such a huge commotion and effect.

Any random Faux Saint Saboteur was more than enough to give Tier 3 experts a headache, what more the Faux Saint Destroyers.

Now, however, several hundred Faux Saint Destroyers had been suppressed until they were just slightly stronger than ordinary Great Lords. Even ordinary Tier 3 experts could handle these Grand Lords. As for the almighty Faux Saint Devourer, it was no different from an ordinary Mythic monster. In its present state, even Tier 3 peak experts could resist it for a certain period.

Master Magic Arrays were unlikely to be able to produce such results. Moreover, the magic array Shi Feng used spanned the entire desert woodland.

At this moment, Shi Feng himself was very surprised by the effects of Miniature World. He never thought that, after his Concentration had reached the Tier 4 standard, aside from being able to exhibit the power of an Advanced Combat Technique with his every movement, his control over magic arrays would also improve to such a frightening degree.

Currently, Miniature World’s suppression effects could rival those of Advanced Master Magic Arrays.

Despite his surprise, Shi Feng did not pause. After activating Miniature World, he promptly charged at the Faux Saint Devourer.

Under the suppression of Miniature World, the Faux Saint Devourer’s speed had decreased considerably. In just two seconds, Shi Feng intercepted the Mythic monster and sent the Abyssal Blade cutting at it.

Immediately, a crescent arc appeared and cut through the Faux Saint Devourer’s shoulder. Failing to react to the attack in time, the Devourer got sent flying and crashed into a large tree several yards away, a damage exceeding -600,000 appearing above its head. The disparity in combat power was clear for all to see. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What is that magic array? The Faux Saint Devourer actually doesn’t even have the strength to fight back?”

The various superpowers spectating the fight from Silverwing Town gaped in shock when they saw the Faux Saint Devourer at a complete disadvantage. In fact, the Devourer’s reaction speed couldn’t even keep up with the Swordsman’s movements.

Although they could tell through their Magic Mirrors that the Faux Saint Devourer’s Basic Attributes had decreased by a significant margin, the Devourer should be at the standard of ordinary Mythic monsters. Given its knowledge of combat techniques, its overall combat power should still be on par with that of Domain Realm experts. After all, the Basic Attributes of a Tier 4 monster was no trivial matter.

However, let alone putting up a fight, the Faux Saint Devourer couldn’t even defend itself against Shi Feng’s attacks, its HP continuously decreasing. It simply couldn’t keep up with Shi Feng’s movements.

After seeing this, everyone could already imagine what outcome awaited the Faux Saint Devourer.

Death!

While it might be impossible for Shi Feng to kill the Faux Saint Devourer by himself, as the Mythic monster had 1.6 billion HP, so long as a dozen or so Tier 3 experts joined him in assaulting it, the Devourer would eventually fall.

Until this day, let alone killing a Mythic ranked Faux Saint Devourer, the various superpowers hadn’t even managed to kill a Grand Lord ranked Faux Saint Destroyer before.

Now, however, Shi Feng accomplished this miracle just by using a magic array. This was simply unbelievable.

Following which, time passed quickly. Less than 10 minutes after Shi Feng activated Miniature World, all the Faux Saint Saboteurs on the battlefield had already fallen to the patrol army, while the Faux Saint Destroyers’ HPs were down by half. As for the Faux Saint Devourer, with Shi Feng, Purple Eye, and several dozen other Tier 3 experts attacking it, its HP had fallen below the 70% threshold already.

The players present could not help growing excited at this scene. This was especially true for the members of the various adventurer teams. After all, the Faux Saint monsters’ undefeated streak had finally ended.

Previously, the various powers and players had been afraid of the Faux Saint monsters because the Grand Lord ranked Faux Saint Destroyers were basically impossible to kill, not to mention the Mythic ranked Faux Saint Devourer.

However, now that killing these Grand Lord and Mythic ranked Faux Saint monsters was no longer a problem, not only was there hope of Star-Moon Kingdom’s survival, but reclaiming some of the kingdom’s lost land might even be possible. Players like themselves would then be able to continue developing in the Orc Empire and Star-Moon Kingdom like before.

“I don’t know who that person is, but after this battle, the situation in the Orc Empire and Star-Moon Kingdom is most likely going to change,” Illusory Words said, the corners of her lips curling up slightly as she watched Shi Feng suppressing the Faux Saint Devourer on the Magic Mirror.

Previously, the undefeatable Faux Saint monsters were the main reason why the various major powers and superpowers feared Saint’s Hand. Now, although they had succeeded in killing only a very small portion of the Faux Saint monsters plaguing Star-Moon Kingdom, so long as news of this success spread, Saint’s Hand would no longer be able to act in an overbearing manner as it did before.

However, just when the various superpowers hidden within Silverwing Town thought that the Faux Saint army was going to suffer annihilation, several dozen lightning spears descended from the sky, shooting at Shi Feng and the others, who were assaulting the Faux Saint Devourer. The speed and power of the lightning spears were so great that more than 20 Tier 3 experts were instantly vaporized.

Along with the descent of the lightning spears, two magic barriers suddenly appeared around the injured Faux Saint Devourer, protecting it from further harm. The Tier 3 Curse Purple Eye used failed to break through them.

Before anyone could react to this turn of events, over a hundred figures emerged rapidly from the surrounding forest and interposed themselves between the Faux Saint Devourer and Shi Feng’s group. Surprisingly, every one of these new arrivals radiated an aura rivaling that of Grand Lords of the same level.

“Who are you people? What are you trying to do?”

After Purple Eye saw her companions killed and the Faux Saint Devourer protected by a twofold magic array, an indescribable rage welled up within her as she glared at the 100-plus black-clad Tier 3 experts that had suddenly appeared.

If not for these new arrivals exuding auras rivaling that of Grand Lords, she would’ve attacked them already. However, reason told her she absolutely mustn’t do so. After all, so long as she took action, both she and her several dozen remaining teammates would die swiftly.

At this time, a tall and bald man with golden eyes walked out of the group. Looking at Purple Eye, the bald man smiled and said, “Commander Purple, long time no see. Do you still recognize me?”

With the appearance of this bald man, the atmosphere became incredibly tense. And Purple Eye’s expression turned grave.

“Thousand Eyes! Why are you here?!” Purple Eye demanded, a tinge of fear darkening her eyes as she looked at this bald man. “What is Saint’s Hand trying to do?!”

As for why she feared this bald man named Thousand Eyes, it was because he was the commander of one of Saint’s Hand’s three trump card legions. He was also the monster responsible for capturing the Star Alliance’s Guild City. Thousand Eyes’s Basic Attributes rivaled those of ordinary Mythic monsters. He had even instantly killed the Domain Realm expert that the Secret Pavilion sent to aid the Star Alliance.

“Do I even need to say it? It’s because you people have gone too far. That’s why we came to stop you,” Thousand Eyes said.

“What do you mean?” Purple Eye asked.

“It is only a matter of time before the Faux Saint monsters take over the entire eastern continent. After all, they are constantly growing stronger, and there is nothing players like ourselves can do to stop them. Our only option is to coexist with them, yet you are actually planning to kill the newly emerged Faux Saint Devourer, which is like a king to the Faux Saint monsters. If you kill the Devourer, you will only enrage those Faux Saint monsters even more. These monsters might even become more active during the day,” Thousand Eyes said. “Hence, we came to stop you from doing something stupid and aggravating the current situation!”

Thousand Eyes’s words gave many of the adventurer team members present pause.

The several thousand Faux Saint monsters here were merely a small portion of the countless Faux Saint monsters within Star-Moon Kingdom. Moreover, just like Thousand Eyes had said, these Faux Saint monsters were incredibly vengeful. So long as a player killed one of these Faux Saint monsters, even more Faux Saint monsters would hunt down the said player. Even if the said player managed to fend off a few attacks, the Faux Saint monsters would simply continue attacking more frequently and in greater numbers. They would not stop until they exacted their vengeance.

If they really killed the Faux Saint Devourer, which was akin to a king among Faux Saint monsters, nobody could tell what the other Faux Saint monsters would do. It was entirely possible for them to grow even more violent and for their daytime activity to escalate. In fact, previously, the Faux Saint monsters had not been particularly active during the day. However, as the number of Faux Saint Saboteurs that players killed increased, the Faux Saint monsters had indeed become more active during the day. They had also grown stronger much more quickly.

In this situation, Purple Eye was at a loss as to what to do.

As Purple Eye and the others were wondering what to do, a crisp and calm voice suddenly entered everyone’s ears.

“What if I want to kill it, no matter what?”
