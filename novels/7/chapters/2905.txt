Chapter 2906 – Combating a Mental Strength Master

Although Shi Feng spoke in a tone that was neither humble nor arrogant, the surrounding passersby and Han Yifeng couldn’t help falling silent, a hint of shock appearing in their eyes.

That’s the Infinity Master he’s talking to! Has he lost his mind?!

Han Yifeng felt his legs weaken when he saw Shi Feng’s unyielding attitude. For long-time residents of the Upper Zone, mental strength masters were existences that shouldn’t be provoked-all the more so a mental strength master with Two-star High Grade authority. Even the base layer’s top-ranking organizations wouldn’t dare to offend such an existence.

Mental strength masters with two-star authority could not only banish people from the Upper Zone for long periods but also teach those who offended them a lesson with little to no repercussions. While the Green God Company might penalize the mental strength master by deducting their trade points and contribution points, such penalties were nothing for a mental strength master of such caliber.

Although Shi Feng’s words and manner of speaking couldn’t be considered offensive to Fu Jiuzhong, it was still a slap to the face for the Infinity Master.

Han Yifeng failed to understand why Shi Feng would step forward himself instead of letting Qin Baiyi cover for him. In his opinion, Shi Feng’s action was simply insane!

At this time, let alone Han Yifeng, even Han Rongrong, who had been quite courageous before and even dared to challenge Shi Feng, shuddered involuntarily in fear. This was because a bone-biting chill was enveloping her entire body right now.

Killing intent! This was a frightening killing intent Han Rongrong had never experienced before. The killing intent was so intense that Han Rongrong, a half-step Henglian grandmaster, had the illusion that she would get killed the next moment. Her terror was so overwhelming that it had taken over her body, making her tremble despite herself.

So, this is the strength of a two-star master? Weiyang Qianhen revealed an indescribably grim expression as she looked at Fu Jiuzhong, feeling somewhat uncomfortable before the Infinity Master’s mental deterrence.

She had sparred with Qin Baiyi previously, so she wasn’t completely ignorant of the strength of mental strength masters.

However, compared to Qin Baiyi, Fu Jiuzhong was on a completely different level.

From sparring with Qin Baiyi, she had come to understand that his mental perception and brain activity were vastly superior to hers. If he was willing to pay the price, he could even increase his brain activity and perception’s sensitivity by more than tenfold at will, allowing him to make inhuman reactions.

Fu Jiuzhong, on the other hand, wasn’t just capable of simply boosting his thinking speed; he could already influence others with his mental will. It was akin to employing powerful hypnosis on his opponents. Most importantly, this mental deterrence wasn’t directed at her but merely spillover. She found it truly hard to imagine what kind of hell the actual target of Fu Jiuzhong’s mental power was experiencing right now.

Of those present, only Qin Baiyi fared slightly better. Even so, he was still affected by Fu Jiuzhong’s mental deterrence. Dammit! It’s over! Fu Jiuzhong has actually broken through to that stage already! There’s no way someone who hasn’t reached the level of a mental strength master can resist this mental deterrence... Qin Baiyi inwardly cursed this situation as he endured Fu Jiuzhong’s mental deterrence.

In Qin Baiyi’s opinion, Shi Feng was an excellent seedling. Not only did Shi Feng become a neutralizing grandmaster at a young age, but his mental strength standard had already reached the peak of the Special Grade. According to the report he received, Shi Feng had even defeated several Henglian grandmasters simultaneously. With such ability, Shi Feng might very well be only half a step away from becoming a mental strength master.

Originally, Qin Baiyi planned to learn more about Shi Feng and then introduce Shi Feng to his teacher.

However, all of his plans were ruined now!

Mental deterrence was something that liberated a person’s deepest fears. For this reason, it was normal for the minds of people subjected to mental deterrence to collapse. If a person had weak willpower, they might even die on the spot.

Even people with very strong willpower would suffer trauma when subjected to mental deterrence, which would impact their future mental growth.

Normally, only three-star mental strength masters could exhibit mental deterrence. Although Fu Jiuzhong’s mental deterrence wasn’t as strong as an actual three-star master’s, his use of this technique proved that he was already close to reaching the three-star standard. He might’ve already taken a step into the stage.

However, when Qin Baiyi turned to look at Shi Feng, he was stunned.

How is this possible?!

Fu Jiuzhong had clearly directed his mental deterrence at Shi Feng. Yet, apart from wearing a slightly solemn expression, Shi Feng showed no fear or discomfort on his face. It was evident that he could withstand the Infinity Master’s mental deterrence. In fact, he was enduring it much better than even Qin Baiyi.

“Hah!” Fu Jiuzhong remained mostly unfazed even after seeing Shi Feng’s reaction, sneering, “I initially had suspicions when I heard Tiandi say you might’ve become a mental strength master already, but I didn’t think you had really become one.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

When Fu Jiuzhong finished speaking, everyone present turned to Shi Feng in disbelief. Han Yifeng, in particular, was thunderstruck by this revelation.

Is he still human?

The first time Han Yifeng met Shi Feng, the latter was merely the Guild Leader of a large Guild. Although Shi Feng possessed some strength at the time, it was still insignificant in Han Yifeng’s eyes. The next time they met, Shi Feng had already become a resident in the Upper Zone, with a considerable amount of resources that could be traded for contribution points.

Now, Shi Feng had even become a mental strength master, an existence many corporations operating in the Upper Zone’s base layer feared. Shi Feng’s growth speed was simply out of this world.

Han Yifeng wasn’t the only one shocked by this revelation. Qin Baiyi similarly felt his heart pounding madly. A mental strength master under the age of 25?

Previously, Qin Baiyi still had his doubts about Shi Feng being a mental strength master. However, since Fu Jiuzhong had said so, then it must be true. Nevertheless, he found it difficult to digest this information.

Mental strength masters were special existences in the Upper Zone, the goal of countless young talents. However, typically, one could already be proud of oneself if one became a mental strength master by the age of 60 or 70.

Qin Baiyi’s achievement of becoming a mental strength master in his thirties already made him a rare talent that only appeared once every several decades in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. However, compared to Shi Feng, Qin Baiyi’s achievement paled significantly.

At Shi Feng’s age, the growth rate of his mental strength was still at its peak. Only after the age of 30 would his growth slow

than five years of rapid growth. If he continued developing himself, he could definitely become a three-star mental strength master in the future, and possibly even reach the legendary grandmaster standard.

When Qin Baiyi thought about the possibility of introducing Shi Feng to his teacher, excitement filled his heart.

However, before Qin Baiyi could grow excited for long, Fu Jiuzhong suddenly changed his tone and said coldly, “Your achievement of becoming a mental strength master might be excellent, but do you think you can behave arrogantly in front of me just because you’ve become one?”

After saying so, Fu Jiuzhong suddenly punched at Shi Feng.

Although Fu Jiuzhong had only executed a textbook punch, in everyone’s eyes, this punch seemed to carry the power of heaven and earth. The power of this punch was unstoppable, and everyone instinctively tried to run away. Not good! Qin Baiyi’s expression immediately underwent a drastic change. “Dodge it!” Fu Jiuzhong’s punch didn’t just exude a mighty aura that daunted others’ hearts. The Infinity Master had also removed the limiters on his body to exhibit 100% of his body’s strength. Moreover, he had perfectly concentrated this strength into his fist. Even a bona fide three-star master would have difficulty blocking this punch. It was evident that after seeing Shi Feng’s true potential, Fu Jiuzhong intended to cripple Shi Feng to rid himself of a future threat! Shi Feng, the target of Fu Jiuzhong’s punch, understood how powerful the oncoming attack was. Fu Jiuzhong’s fist wasn’t the only threat like most people thought. There was also the intent from the Infinity Master’s fist. Although the fist intent didn’t have a tangible form, it was by no means harmless.

Moreover, even if Shi Feng could evade Fu Jiuzhong’s fist intent, he couldn’t dodge the punch itself. And although Shi Feng didn’t know how powerful Fu Jiuzhong’s punch was, he had a hunch that if he allowed the fist to connect, he would end up either crippled or dead. And worse, he couldn’t stop the punch with his current strength utilization technique.

This was because he was currently incapable of removing all of the limiters his brain placed on his body.

No! I will not let things end like this!

As Shi Feng watched Fu Jiuzhong’s fist moving closer and closer to him, his brain raced, thinking of ways to block the punch. When Fu Jiuzhong’s fist was only half a meter away, a potentially viable technique suddenly occurred to Shi Feng-a technique he had wanted to use in the real world all this time but couldn’t due to physical fitness and mental capacity limitations.

Block it!

With a shout, Shi Feng concentrated the strength of his body and removed the limiters on his two arms. He then brandished his arms as if he were brandishing swords and instantly executed the sword technique he had used thousands of times in God’s Domain.

Sword’s Transmigration!
