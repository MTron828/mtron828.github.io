Chapter 300 – Miniature Ancient World’s Changes

The afternoon sun’s glaring rays shone brightly into Shi Feng’s room. While eating the God’s Domain Association’s complimentary lunch, which would typically cost 200 Star Coins, by the window walls, Shi Feng read through the many messages he received.

How surprising. It’s been only a day, yet so many changes have happened in the Miniature Ancient World,?Shi Feng thought, astonished by the messages Su Qianliu and Hidden Soul had sent him.

The majority of Su Qianliu’s messages were inquiries about his safety. After all, he had gone up against a Tier 5 Demon King in the temple. Tier 5 Legendary monsters were incredibly rare in God’s Domain. Every one of them was a walking disaster, and raiding a Legendary monster typically required a team of 20 Tier 5 players or a 1,000-man legion of high-level Tier 4 players. Moreover, this was after factoring in the use of various tools.

So, for a Tier 4 player to fight a Tier 5 Demon King without any support was no different than suicide.

Aside from expressing her concerns, Su Qianliu also mentioned Laura Crader’s unexpected appearance and how the Glimmering Sword had single-handedly repelled Meteor and the other geniuses from the Paimon Conglomerate. Afterward, Laura had even escorted Zero Wing’s team safely out of the Land of Ancient Dragons.

As for Hidden Soul, her messages had arrived only a few hours ago.

Whether it was Shi Feng’s performance against the Demon King Firenze or Laura’s fight with Meteor, news of both had already spread across the entire Miniature Ancient World and caused a huge sensation. Even the Seven Luminaries Alliance had hastily updated its God-ranked Expert List.

However, the God-ranked Expert List wasn’t changed simply because of Shi Feng and Laura. Aside from the first-ranked player, everyone else on the list saw a drastic change in their ranks. This was because the Seven Luminaries Alliance had begun to record the various conglomerates’ internal geniuses on the God-ranked Expert List, which the alliance did not do previously.

Meanwhile, as soon as the new God List appeared, everyone in the Miniature Ancient World was shocked.

Out of the original top 10 players on the God List, the only ones that remained in the top 10 were the first-ranked player and the fourth-ranked Asura Sword Emperor. Everyone else was removed from the top 10. Moreover, not only did Shi Feng’s position on the list not increase, but he had even fallen to seventh place.

The Miniature Ancient World’s various powers felt great pressure from this sudden change. The fact that the various conglomerates’ internal geniuses were revealing themselves to the public now meant that these conglomerates intended to invest in the Miniature Ancient World. This was not good news for the various powers.

Aside from the various conglomerates’ behavior, another thing that surprised the various powers was the Asura Mercenary Alliance.

Out of the top ten positions on the God List, the Asura Mercenary Alliance occupied two of them. Aside from the seventh-ranked Asura Sword Emperor, there was also the eighth-ranked Glimmering Sword. This situation instantly caused the Asura Mercenary Alliance to become a hot topic. Some hegemonic powers have even started to consider strengthening their partnership with the mercenary alliance.

However, the most astonishing piece of news Hidden Soul brought to Shi Feng would still have to be the Desolate Star Corporation’s willingness to establish a Trade Center in the Abyssal Star Primordial City.

Players unfamiliar with the Greater God’s Domain might be foreign to the concept of Trade Centers in God’s Domain, but anyone who had interacted with the various foreign powers would understand the value of a Trade Center.

Even the various hegemonic powers would desperately seek to obtain a Trade Center.

The Trade Center was a special type of construction in God’s Domain. Normally, only corporations in the Greater World would have the qualifications to establish Trade Centers. Meanwhile, a Trade Center functioned to help players trade in-game items for real-world currency directly and anonymously.

It should be known that trades involving in-game items and real-world money could usually only be conducted privately. This transaction method carried great risks. If mishandled, players could lose both their wealth and their lives.

However, players wouldn’t have to worry about such problems at a Trade Center. They could complete the entire transaction using only their in-game identities. The real-world money they received would be debited into their accounts by the Main God System, so nobody could trace where the money was sent. In exchange for this convenience service, all players needed to do was pay a small processing fee.

If Abyssal Star City were to gain a Trade Center, it would absolutely become the heart of the Miniature Ancient World as countless independent players wishing to keep their identities safe would come to do business in Abyssal Star City.

In addition, the Desolate Star Corporation also offered an incredibly tempting price to Abyssal Star City—10% of the processing fees. This was an offer only the Holy Cities of hegemonic powers could usually receive.

It should be known that a Guild City with a player population of 20 million could generate a frightening amount of Star Coins a day through a Trade Center. Even if Abyssal Star City could only receive 10% of the profits, the city should still see a daily income of 50,000 Star Coins. If the city’s population grew to 100 million, its income would also undergo a qualitative transformation.

Now that the Land of Ancient Dragons had appeared, many independent experts would definitely try to explore the God Mode Regional Dungeon. Meanwhile, should they look to sell the items they found during their exploration, Abyssal Star City would definitely be their best choice. At that time, even if Abyssal Star City’s player population couldn’t reach 100 million, it definitely wouldn’t have any trouble reaching 50 million.

So long as Abyssal Star City could maintain this state over a long period, both Zero Wing and the Asura Mercenary Alliance would have no problems establishing a foothold in the Greater World.

Hence, Shi Feng promptly replied to Hidden Soul, telling her to accept the Desolate Star Corporation’s conditions.

Aside from Su Qianliu’s and Hidden Soul’s messages, another message surprised Shi Feng.

Apparently, Xia Qingying had already secured two slots to enter the Greater World. So long as Shi Feng decided on who he wanted to allocate the slots to, the people he chose would be able to come to the Greater World in a week’s time. These two people would still have time to participate in the Star Lake Legion’s selection.

Without much hesitation, Shi Feng chose to bring Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul to the Greater World.

Whether it was Gentle Snow or Hidden Soul, both of them possessed superb talent. They were only missing an opportunity to shine. So long as they could enter the Greater World, they would definitely be of great assistance to him. Meanwhile, the more people he could get into the Star Lake Legion, the greater his authority in the legion would become.

…

Time passed by quickly. In the blink of an eye, nearly three days had gone by already.

After learning about the Desolate Star Corporation’s Trade Center and the two entry slots for the Greater World, Shi Feng began mining for Seven Luminaries Crystals with even greater enthusiasm. Aside from resting in the Gazing Moon Hotel, he spent the rest of his time mining in the Primal Ore Vein with Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, not logging off to rest for even a moment.

“I’ve collected another 100 units, Brother Black Flame,” Midsummer excitedly reported to Shi Feng after she finished mining her last Seven Luminaries Crystal for today. “We should have exceeded our quota of 10,000 units already, right?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

They had collected 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in under three days. This was the first time she had earned wealth so quickly. At the same time, this was also the quickest she had ever leveled up, her level going from 129 to 139 in under three days.

“Mhm. We’ve exceeded it already,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at the 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystals in his spatial bag and his level of 139. “Let’s go and take care of real business now.”
