Chapter 508 – Magic and Combat Techniques

“Is this the might of the War Goddesses?”

“We’re saved!”

Everyone was shocked and excited by the six War Goddesses’ performance.

Originally, their team stood no chance whatsoever against the Mutated Floor Master. This was because a Special Intelligent Lifeform had an overwhelming advantage over players, and this could be seen by how effortlessly Tia had cast over a dozen Tier 5 Spells simultaneously. It was simply unthinkable for players to defeat a Special Intelligent Lifeform of the same tier.

But now, with the six Tier 5 War Goddesses on their side, killing the Mutated Floor Master would no longer be a dream. There was a real chance they could accomplish the unthinkable.

“Don’t relax just yet. These War Goddesses can only stay summoned for a limited time. If we can’t finish the battle quickly, we will still be doomed,” Shi Feng said, reminding his excited teammates that they had yet to win the battle.

The summoned War Goddesses only had a duration of three hours. While the Feather of Oath’s War Goddess Summoning Skill didn’t have a cooldown, each War Goddess had a hidden summoning cooldown of one natural day. So, even if he had Seven Luminaries Crystals to spare, he couldn’t summon them limitlessly.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, everyone promptly calmed down.

The ability to summon six War Goddesses was indeed amazing. But there was no way such an amazing ability would have no restrictions. Otherwise, it’d be too heaven-defying. And although Shi Feng did not mention how long the War Goddesses could stay summoned specifically, they probably couldn’t stay summoned for very long.

Meanwhile, it definitely wouldn’t be an easy task to deplete Tia’s two trillion HP within a limited time. They would need to deal a minimum of 40 billion damage every five seconds just to overcome the Mutated Floor Master’s battle recovery. Even if Tia simply stood still and let them bombard her with attacks, killing her would still be a challenge.

“What do you suggest we do, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Ink Qilin asked via the team chat while keeping her eyes focused on Tia, who didn’t look to be in a hurry to take further action.

“We’ll have to heavily injure her. Otherwise, we will just die from exhaustion,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the Mutated Floor Master. “The War Goddesses will work together to give her a heavy blow, but we must buy time for them. They cannot be disturbed throughout the preparation process.”

The reason the Feather of Oath was regarded as one of the Goddess of Space’s prized possessions was not because of the War Goddesses’ individual combat capabilities. Instead, it was because of a Combination Gold Combat Technique the twelve summoned War Goddesses could use together. According to rumors, when twelve Tier 6 War Goddesses used this combination technique, they could even heavily injure a Primordial God.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Shi Feng could only summon six Tier 5 War Goddesses right now, the combination technique they used should be enough to heavily injure a Tier 5 Special Intelligent Lifeform.

So long as Tia was heavily injured, not only would her Basic Attributes plummet, but she would also lose her battle recovery ability. Coupled with the attacks of the six War Goddesses, their team would have a real chance of killing Tia. Otherwise, with Tia’s HP and their limited time and manpower, it simply wouldn’t be possible for them to take down the Mutated Floor Master.

“If it’s just guarding the War Goddesses for a short time, we can totally do that,” Ink Qilin said very confidently. “But for how long do we need to protect them exactly?”

“A little over ten seconds,” Shi Feng estimated. “During this time, Tia will definitely attack us relentlessly.”

“Just over ten seconds?” Ink Qilin breathed a sigh of relief. Then, while holding her shield, she said, “Then, I am 100% confident I can protect them. My shield’s Boundary Defense can neutralize all hostile attacks within an area for twenty seconds. I can even tank multiple Divine monsters throughout this duration.”

“Okay.” Nodding, Shi Feng said, “I am bound to be Tia’s priority target as the summoner, so I cannot stay near the War Goddesses. I will find an opportune moment to have the War Goddesses prepare their combination attack, but once they start their preparation, I will have to leave them in your hands.”

After saying so, Shi Feng promptly distanced himself from the War Goddesses. Otherwise, Tia could simply focus all her attacks on one location, and the War Goddesses would not have any opportunities to prepare their combination attack.

“I don’t know what you are trying to do, but do you think you can escape from me?” Tia nonchalantly said as she glanced and pointed a finger at Shi Feng, who was executing Flowing Space to leave the battlefield.

Suddenly, space and time seemed to have become frozen, and several dozen magic arrays appeared around Shi Feng.

When Shi Feng saw the magic arrays that had appeared around him, he quickly recognized two threefold magic arrays, and he couldn’t help but curse at the players responsible for feeding the Tier 5 Curses Spatial Garden and Time Arc to Tia.

Even with his Basic Attributes reaching the Tier 6 standard, Shi Feng still found himself immobilized due to the effects of the two triple-cast Curses, and he could only watch as several dozen Tier 5 Offensive Spells targeted him.

“Attack!” Shi Feng didn’t dare to drag things out any longer and immediately called for the War Goddesses to start preparing their attack. At the same time, he activated Fluctuating Law, constructing a world barrier around himself that protected him from the bombardment of Spells.

Following Shi Feng’s command, the six War Goddesses gathered together and closed their eyes to meditate, isolating their minds from their surroundings.

At first glance, it didn’t look like the War Goddesses were doing anything. Unfortunately, Tia immediately sensed the danger the War Goddesses posed to her and raised one of her hands. Then, everyone on the battlefield lost access to their five senses.

However, this state lasted for only an instant. Then, once everyone recovered their five senses, they saw hundreds of meteorites appearing in the sky.

The meteorites were massive, each having a radius of several thousand meters. Moreover, every meteorite was inscribed with divine runes, and their mere presence caused the surrounding space to collapse.

Tier 5 Curse, Starry Rhapsody!

Tia’s Starry Rhapsody was stacked more than ten times, and just its activation depleted the mana in a 10,000-yard radius. Everyone felt suffocated due to the lack of mana around them, and the sight of the descending meteorites instilled an indescribable sense of terror in them.

“So, this is a Special Intelligent Lifeform?”

At this moment, everyone on the battlefield could feel the approach of death. They also came to understand why Special Intelligent Lifeforms had the potential to grow into existences regarded as taboo by the entire Greater God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, when Ink Qilin saw the descending meteorites, she instinctively activated her Tier 5 Legacy Berserk Skill Hero’s Heart, increasing all her Basic Attributes by 150% and Defensive Skill effects by 200%.

Boundary Defense!

Suddenly, a barrier that blocked everything appeared with Ink Qilin at its center, covering a radius of fifty yards.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A moment later, the descending meteorites began bombarding Ink Qilin’s Boundary Defense one after another, the resulting shockwaves turning the entire battlefield into a dark void and sending tremors across the Underground Crystal Palace’s fourth floor.
