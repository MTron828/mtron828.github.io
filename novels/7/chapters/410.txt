Chapter 411 - Victory and Defeat

Violet Cloud’s easy victory had rendered everyone speechless.

Nimble Snake, one of the Twelve Apostles of Ouroboros, had been effortlessly manipulated, so much so that he failed to inflict even a single point of damage to a Cleric. If this matter reached the public, nobody would believe it.

“We won?”

Although Zhao Yueru had prayed that Violet Cloud could win, she had not expected that the girl could so easily.

However, Violet Cloud’s skills were peculiar.

It was especially true for her final skill. It had complemented Black Coffin perfectly, allowing the skill to display its full potential.

Violet Cloud’s and Ye Feng’s combat styles were clearly different.

Violet Cloud had not used any stunning attacks like Shi Feng. Instead, she utilized her skills to their very limits. From beginning to end, Nimble Snake had no chance to employ his advantage of techniques. Violet Cloud practically had him in the palm of her hand this entire match.

Regarding combat techniques, Zhao Yueru did not think that Violet Cloud was much stronger herself. Unlike Ye Feng and War Wolf, Violet Cloud’s techniques were not at an unreachable level. Only, the skills Violet Cloud possessed were simply too powerful. Despite Nimble Snake’s techniques being far superior, he still lost in the end.

“Ye Feng, is she really a Cleric?” Although Gentle Snow rejoiced, she was also incredibly curious. She refused to believe that a Cleric could possess such powerful skills. Moreover, from the looks of it, Violet Cloud’s Basic Attributes were significantly higher than Zhao Yueru’s.

“Yes and no,” Shi Feng said, smiling. He could guess what was going through Gentle Snow’s mind right now.

“What do you mean?” Zhao Yueru piped in.

“Violet has already class-changed from a Tier 0 Cleric to the Tier 1 hidden class, Astromancer. Not only does she possess the inherent skills of a Cleric, but she also possesses the skills of an Astromancer,” Shi Feng explained slowly. “Meanwhile, she defeated Nimble Snake just now using the Tier 1 Legacy Skills of an Astromancer. As for the might of those skills, you’ve seen them for yourselves.”

“Tier 1 class? You’re saying that Violet has already obtained her Tier 1 class?” Zhao Yueru’s little mouth gaped, her eyes filled with disbelief as she looked at the girl smiling happily beside Shi Feng.

Tier 1 class!

This was a completely unknown concept to God’s Domain’s current players. Though, as an expert, she knew that a Tier 1 class was stronger than a Tier 0 class. However, the Class Change Quest was cumbersome. Not only would it be time-consuming, but the quest also quite difficult. As a result, she had chosen to focus on her level first.

However, she never imagined that there would be such a huge gap between a Tier 0 and a Tier 1 class.

“So this is the gap between a Tier 0 player and a Tier 1 player?” When Zhao Yueru thought back to how effortlessly Violet Cloud had defeated Nimble Snake, her heart was suddenly eager to challenge her Class Change Quest. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Meanwhile, after listening to Shi Feng’s explanation, Gentle Snow had also come to a realization.

It was no wonder the two of them were only Level 22. It turned out that they had taken the time to complete their Class Change Quest.

Zero Wing is indeed filled with crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Gentle Snow inwardly sighed as she looked at Violet Cloud. It seems that Ouroboros needs to challenge the Class Change Quests as well.

A Tier 1 class was actually so powerful. If Zero Wing had a large number of Tier 1 players ...

Could Zero Wing even find a Dungeon they could not raid?

With such strength, leveling up would also be much easier.

In comparison, they had only been wasting their time and efforts by leveling up and raiding Dungeons.

At this time, the five matches of the competition had come to a close. Naturally, Gentle Snow was the overall winner. As for Cao Chenghua, the loser, at this moment, his eyes were bloodshot. He glared at Nimble Snake as thoughts of strangling the assassin filtered through his mind.

Despite all of his calculations and machinations, he had never expected that the two outsiders Gentle Snow had invited would be so powerful.

However, his thoughts were meaningless now because the Main God System had already begun enforcing the conditions of the contract. Cao Chenghua’s body began to slowly fade out of existence as the Main God System expelled him from God’s Domain permanently.

Just like that, the Acting Guild Leader of Ouroboros, a relatively influential character in the virtual gaming world, could not log into God’s Domain ever again.

Without Cao Chenghua supporting them, Blackhearted Arrow and the recently resurrected Nimble Snake were at a loss.

From now on, Gentle Snow would be the Guild Leader of Ouroboros. It would be a piece of cake for her to deal with them.

Regret turned Nimble Snake’s stomach.

Originally, he thought his future would be set if he followed Cao Chenghua. Yet, now...

Just as Nimble Snake and Blackhearted Arrow began to panic, War Wolf, the outsider invited by Cao Chenghua, stood and walked up to Gentle Snow.

“Miss Snow, we meet again,” War Wolf greeted, a faint smile on his face.

“Do you have any business with me?” Gentle Snow asked, somewhat surprised.

In the past, War Wolf had felt only disdain towards Guild players like her, refusing to even speak with her. Now, however, he had actually initiated a conversation. It was beyond unusual.

Even Shi Feng was curious as to what War Wolf had to say.

“I only wish to congratulate Miss Snow for becoming the Guild Leader of Ouroboros,” War Wolf spoke softly.

“Thank you,” Gentle Snow answered politely.

In regards to the man named War Wolf, Gentle Snow could not see through him in the least. Moreover, the Shield Warrior gave her a sense of extreme danger, and she was quite uncomfortable.

Following which, War Wolf shifted his gaze to Shi Feng, saying, “I truly did not expect to meet a fellow martial arts practitioner here. Although I wish to exchange a few moves with you, unfortunately, I am only a Tier 0 class right now. I can only seek you out once I receive my Tier 1 promotion.

“However, before I leave, I have something I need to say to Brother Ye Feng. It is best if you leave Zero Wing quickly and look for a better Guild to develop yourself.”

“Brother War Wolf, what are you trying to say?”

Shi Feng did not think that War Wolf was someone who would speak nonsense.

“This... It could be dangerous for me to go into detail, but recently, Zero Wing has attracted too much attention in God’s Domain. Some people can no longer sit by and have begun to take action.”

“Are you referring to Underworld?”

“No. Even I get a headache just thinking about dealing with those people. If you can hide from them, then hide. In the off chance that Zero Wing provokes them, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

War Wolf simply smiled and shook his head before departing from the room.

Watching War Wolf’s departing figure, Shi Feng grew confused. He could not figure out who else had targeted Zero Wing. Even an expert like War Wolf feared of them.

“Forget it. There is no point overthinking things. Let’s just take things as they come.”

Since he could not figure it out, Shi Feng no longer bothered thinking about it.

Why worry about trouble that might not even come?

After War Wolf’s departure, Gentle Snow had immediately expelled Nimble Snake and Blackhearted Arrow from Ouroboros.

Although the two of them were experts, who knew what sort of schemes they would concoct in the future? It was especially true for a sly and treacherous bastard like Nimble Snake.

Afterward, Gentle Snow gave both Shi Feng and Violet Cloud 30 million Credits each as remuneration for their help.

Violet Cloud was stupefied upon seeing the numbers in her virtual bank account.

This was her first time seeing such an astronomical sum of money.

Shi Feng, on the other hand, was rather pleased after receiving the money. With this, he would not have to worry about the Guild’s development funds for some time.

As Gentle Snow had just become Ouroboros’s Guild Leader, she still had a ton of things she needed to handle. Shi Feng and Violet Cloud did not linger either, and they left the Underground Arena.

Just as Shi Feng and Violet Cloud were about to return to White River City, the sound of his communicator ringing suddenly reached his ears.

“Brother Feng, I have bad news! Something big has happened!” Blackie announced.
