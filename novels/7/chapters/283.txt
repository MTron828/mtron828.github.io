Chapter 284 - Ghost Raider

As the capital city of Star-Moon Kingdom, beneath the flourishing appearance of Star-Moon City were piles and piles of pearly white bones.

The moment Shi Feng arrived at the city, he could already sniff out the strong smell of blood.

When Shi Feng walked the bustling streets of Star-Moon City, none of the players he saw belonged to small and unknown Guilds. Instead, all the Guild players he saw belonged to third-rate Guilds or above. As for the unrated Guilds, Shi Feng could make a general guess as to where they had gone.

They had definitely been completely annexed by these large Guilds.

Furthermore, the average level of players in Star-Moon City was very high. In terms of equipment, the players of Star-Moon City were also a notch higher than the players of White River City.

Originally, it was a very rare sight to find average players possessing Bronze Equipment. At Star-Moon City, however, it was not a rare sight at all. Shi Feng had even seen some independent players who possessed equipment of Mysterious-Iron rank and above. As for the players who wore a Guild Emblem on them, majority of their equipment were of Mysterious-Iron rank. Some elite members of Guilds were even fully geared with Mysterious-Iron Equipment. The standards of Star-Moon City were clearly a lot higher than White River City’s.

However, if these players were to be compared to Shi Feng, they would still be miles and miles behind.

When Shi Feng arrived in Star-Moon City, he had removed his disguise of Black Flame. Instead, he had chosen to use his original appearance of Ye Feng to move around the city. Hence, he did not choose to hide the equipment he had on him right now.

Although Shi Feng had already turned off the innate glowing effect that Dark-Gold Equipment possessed, he was unable to do anything about the originally dashing appearance of the item itself. There was also the two weapons at his waist, the Abyssal Blade and the Demonbane, whose quality could not be discerned through sight alone. Overall, Shi Feng’s equipment had caused all the players who walked past him to cast sidelong glances at him.

Shi Feng was just like a famous celebrity as he strolled along the streets of Star-Moon City; it was impossible for him to keep a low profile even if he wanted to.

However, Shi Feng paid no attention to the stares he was receiving, focusing only on the task at hand.

After arriving at Star-Moon City, a new city, Shi Feng first made a trip to the city’s Auction House by force of habit. He intended to gauge the market conditions of this entire city.

As the capital city, Star-Moon City was geographically located in the central region of Star-Moon Kingdom. Hence, whether it was the northern, southern, western, or eastern region, all trade would pass through this place. In the past, during the peak of Star-Moon Kingdom, Star-Moon City controlled a full quarter of Star-Moon Kingdom’s trade volume. One could simply imagine how large the trade volume at Star-Moon City was.

If one could dominate Star-Moon City, the daily profits one could rake in would be astronomical. In comparison, the Starstreak Trading Firm’s daily profit of 1,600 to 1,700 Gold Coins was merely a trifling sum.

With such a large trade volume available, it would be a lie to say that Shi Feng did not have aspirations towards it.

Unfortunately, Zero Wing had just recently set out on its journey. It would still be a long time before he could attempt to get a share of the pie known as Star-Moon City.

Today, Shi Feng was simply here to lay the groundwork for his eventual entry into Star-Moon City’s market in the future.

Star-Moon City’s Auction House was also the largest Auction House in Star-Moon Kingdom. When players registered an item here, the item would also be available for the players in the surrounding tens of cities to purchase. It was much more amazing than the White River City Auction House.

Moreover, when players from another country wished to visit Star-Moon Kingdom, or when players from the kingdom itself wished to head to another country, they would be required to make a transit through Star-Moon City, as it was the capital city of the kingdom. This situation also led to players from other countries selling their wares at the Star-Moon Auction House. Hence, there was a very large variety of items available at the Star-Moon Auction House, and no other Auction House in Star-Moon Kingdom could ever dream of being its equal.

This was also one of the reasons why many players would willingly come here to purchase or sell their items.

The inside of the Auction House was filled with a sea of players. After entering the building, Shi Feng quickly looked for a quiet corner and sat down. He then called out the Auction House interface, quietly browsing through its contents.

“Brother Blade, look at that person’s amazing equipment! Although my Eagle Eyes skill allows me to identify any weapon or equipment that is Fine-Gold rank or below, when I tried identifying that person’s stuff, many of them returned as Unidentifiable!” a skinny Ranger said excitedly as he drooled at Shi Feng’s equipment.

“What? Unidentifiable? Don’t tell me he’s using Dark-Gold Equipment? Imperial Thunder, did something go wrong with your skill? Let alone a player from an unknown Guild, even the Guild Leaders of Ouroboros and the Star Alliance wouldn’t be able to possess so many Dark-Gold Equipment,” the robust-looking Berserker named Lifeless Blade argued, laughing.

“Brother Blade, you should know that this identification skill of mine is an advanced skill that I obtained only after completing a Unique Quest. When had it ever gone wrong before?” the Ranger named Imperial Thunder replied earnestly.

Lifeless Blade nodded, his expression turning serious. He then looked towards Shi Feng, who currently sat on a stone chair, noticing that he was actually unfamiliar with this person.

“Ye Feng?

“He isn’t an expert of Star-Moon City. He should have come from some other city.”

After Lifeless Blade used an identification skill on Shi Feng, he immediately knew that Shi Feng was not a player belonging to Star-Moon City.

Lifeless Blade could be considered a somewhat famous person in Star-Moon Kingdom. He had met many players before, and he had also met majority of the experts that could be found in the city. As for the experts he had yet to meet, he knew what they were called, at the very least. Even so, he had never heard of an expert called Ye Feng before.

“And yet, I seem to recall hearing this name, Ye Feng, from somewhere...” Lifeless Blade drifted into deep thought. “I recall seeing this name on the official forums before. I wonder if I can still find it now.” Thinking so, Lifeless Blade opened the official forums and started searching for information relating to a player called Ye Feng.

At this moment, Imperial Thunder used Eagle Eyes on the Guild Emblem hanging on Shi Feng’s chest. Instantly, a shocked expression surfaced on his face. Yet, immediately after, that shock turned into great excitement.

“Imperial Thunder, what happened to you?” Lifeless Blade asked curiously. It was his first time seeing Imperial Thunder produce such an expression. In the past, Imperial Thunder did not react with such intensity even when he saw a Lord ranked Field Boss.

“Brother Blade, he’s a member of Zero Wing!” Imperial Thunder said excitedly.

“Zero Wing? Why would they be here?” Lifeless Blade asked curiously.

Nobody in Star-Moon Kingdom had not heard of Zero Wing at this point.

After all, it was the first Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom to possess its own Guild Residence. Moreover, there were plenty of experts in its midst. Even the top ranking player in Star-Moon Kingdom was a member of Zero Wing. Not only was this Guild extremely mysterious, it also had Star-Moon Kingdom’s Chief Forger providing them with equipment.

Countless players wished to join Zero Wing. Unfortunately, the Guild was only recruiting members in White River City. Unless players from other cities migrated there, they would have no chance of joining it at all.

At this moment, Lifeless Blade had also found some information relating to Ye Feng on the forums.

Aside from finding out that Ye Feng was the author of the White River City Guidebook, Lifeless Blade had also found some video recordings of Ye Feng’s battles. Of them, the video showing Ye Feng’s one-man battle against hundreds of Martial Union members was still ranked within the top 30 most-viewed videos. The video had even been titled God-ranked Swordsman’s Instructional Video. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“So he is that god-ranked expert, Ye Feng.” Lifeless Blade felt greatly surprised at this moment. He never imagined he would get the chance to meet such a great expert.

While Lifeless Blade and Imperial Thunder were watching Shi Feng, Shi Feng, with his extraordinary five senses, had long since noticed his two observers.

The interest these two players emitted was very strong. In addition, the fervor in their gazes made it hard for Shi Feng not to notice them, even if he wasn’t trying.

“And here I was, wondering who was spying on me. It turned out that it was Lifeless Blade and Imperial Thunder.” Shi Feng glanced at his two admirers, sending a faint smile at them. Shi Feng had been looking forward to meeting these two famous players for a long time now.

Before they had even started playing God’s Domain, they were already a relatively famous independent party. In the gaming world, they had even been called the Sharp Arrow party. After they entered God’s Domain, they shone even more than before. In the past, the team they had formed managed to successfully raid plenty of Team Dungeons that even the main force of first-rate Guilds were helpless against.

Meanwhile, the team leader, Lifeless Blade, had also been nicknamed the Ghost Raider.

“Brother Blade, such a chance won’t fall into our laps a second time. Why don’t we go get acquainted with him? Who knows, we might even become friends,” Imperial Thunder suggested to Lifeless Blade.
