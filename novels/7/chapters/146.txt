Chapter 147 - Might of the Devil Flame (3)

Absolute Heaven suddenly convulsed in shock when he saw the clear-blue flame floating above Shi Feng’s palm. Although this flame looked miniscule, the heat it gave off was extraordinarily hot. Within an instant, he could already feel his mouth drying up.

However, since the arrow was nocked, he had no choice but to let it loose.

Within an instant, the Ice-Blue Devil Flame covered Shi Feng’s entire body, turning him into a man on fire.

The ice-cold dagger suddenly stabbed into Shi Feng’s back.

“You... can move already?” Absolute Heaven was greatly shocked.

To a top-tier expert like himself, he had a very precise grasp on time. At worst, there was only an error of 0.1 seconds.

Absolute Heaven clearly felt that the 6 second duration for the Death’s Lock had yet to pass. Yet, Shi Feng was still able to use Defensive Blade to block his finishing move, Eviscerate.

“Didn’t you have a fun time beating me up just now?” Shi Feng revealed a faint smile, coldly saying, “It’s my turn now.”

Wielding the Abyssal Blade, which was covered by a layer of clear-blue flames, Shi Feng used Chop, and the Abyssal Blade transformed into a blazing streak of light as it struck towards Absolute Heaven.

“You have less than 500 HP remaining right now. Do you think you can defeat me?” Absolute Heaven sneered, retaliating.

The instant the two weapons collided, a trace of shock immediately appeared on Absolute Heaven’s frosty expression.

It was as if the opponent he was facing against right now was not Shi Feng, but a humongous bear. Shi Feng’s strength had thoroughly numbed his arm, and he was forced to retreat several steps before stabilizing his body.

How can he have such great strength?! When Absolute Heaven had exchanged moves with Shi Feng the previous time, Shi Feng’s strength was not yet quite so terrifying. However, now that he had changed and upgraded most of his equipment, increasing his Attributes by a large leap, he not only surpassed Shi Feng, but the gap between them had somehow grown even wider!

Now that he had failed at ambushing Shi Feng, it was already impossible for him to kill Shi Feng in a direct confrontation. He could only patiently wait for his next chance.

After forcing Absolute Heaven into a retreat, Shi Feng quickly took out a Basic Regeneration Potion and drank it. Very quickly, Shi Feng’s HP recovered more than 700 points.

“Absolute Heaven, it seems you only amount to this much. You’ve failed to kill me in both of your ambushes, so now it’s my turn to get revenge. Don’t even think of getting away from me today,” Shi Feng revealed a calm smile as he looked at Absolute Heaven, who was currently filled with killing intent.

He could not help but admire, and admit, that Absolute Heaven’s assassination abilities were very powerful. Not only did Absolute Heaven manage to persevere and track Shi Feng to this place, he had even managed to set up an ambush the instant Shi Feng relaxed his guard during his battle against the Steel-skinned Hippo. As a result, Absolute Heaven nearly managed to kill him.

Unfortunately, Absolute Heaven did not know that the Ice-Blue Devil Flame had strengthened Shi Feng’s body, slightly reducing the duration of the Death’s Lock on him. Otherwise, he would truly be finished.

Now that he was back to normal, he used the Ice-Blue Devil Flame to aid him; a 20% increase in damage was no laughing matter.

“What a joke. You’ve only managed to live this time due to luck. I will definitely kill you the next time we meet. As for you wanting to keep me here? You couldn’t do it the last time, and you similarly won’t be able to do it this time!” Absolute Heaven felt that Shi Feng was simply too conceited, daring to declare that he could kill him. The rage in his heart burned from Shi Feng’s words. He inwardly vowed to form a more thorough plan to utterly vanquish Shi Feng the next time.

“Brother Feng, I’ll help!” at that moment, Blackie’s vision was finally restored. He angrily glared at Absolute Heaven, prepared to use his Evil Whip.

Shi Feng waved his hand, saying with a laugh, “No need. Against him, I alone am enough.”

“Brother Feng, he is an Assassin; he definitely has a lot of lifesaving skills. His speed is also very fast. If he manages to escape, what should we do if he comes back to ambush us again?” Blackie had seen before an Assassin’s myriad of escaping skills. If not properly countered, one would be completely helpless against an Assassin.

“Relax, he can’t get away.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Alright, then.”

Since Shi Feng insisted, Blackie could only resolve himself to watch.

The reason why Shi Feng voiced out those words was to agitate and provoke Absolute Heaven. When dealing with experts like Absolute Heaven, it was not easy to kill them. Dealing with such experts, one first needed to attack them emotionally, provoking them and sending their state of mind into a mess, before looking for a chink or weak point.

“Brat, you sure have a big mouth. I want to see just how you intend to block my path,” Absolute Heaven said with a sneer, rage clouding over his expression.

“We’ll know once we try,” Shi Feng revealed a calm smile. He activated Wind Blade, his body piercing towards Absolute Heaven.

Originally, Shi Feng’s speed was already very fast. Now, with Wind Blade activated, Shi Feng’s speed was on a whole nother level. He arrived in front of Absolute Heaven within an instant, six sword images immediately stabbing towards Absolute Heaven’s vital points.

“So fast!” Absolute Heaven was awe-shocked, hurriedly using his daggers to block the attacks.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

With the added power from the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, Shi Feng’s attacks were not something that Absolute Heaven could easily block. Immediately, Absolute Heaven was in a disadvantageous position. He desperately blocked and dodged Shi Feng’s attacks, and he was forced into a retreat with every consecutive attack.

After exchanging several moves without using any skills, Absolute Heaven was struck once by Shi Feng. As a result, Absolute Heaven lost over 300 HP within an instant.

“Damn!” Originally, Absolute Heaven only intended to exchange a few moves with Shi Feng, grinding away Shi Feng’s arrogance. Never would he have imagined that he would instead be forced into a constant retreat. Yet, his pride as an expert was unwilling to admit that he had actually lost against Shi Feng in a normal exchange.

Seeing as the flaming sword was about to hit him, Absolute Heaven gritted his teeth, using the skill Block to defend against this attack.

If he was to receive another attack from that flaming sword, then he would very well lose his life.

Not good, time to leave. The gap between our Attributes and Attack Power is just too wide. After coming to grips with Shi Feng, he clearly understood the gap between the two of them. It was especially true for that clear-blue flame. Every time his equipment came into contact with it, their durability would continuously fall. Though his Secret-Silver ranked dagger was better off, only losing a little durability with each clash, the armor he obtained with much difficulty was only of Mysterious-Iron rank. Just a single stab from Shi Feng’s sword had reduced over a quarter of the armor’s total durability. If this situation were to continue, then his equipment would all soon turn to waste. Without the Attributes provided by his equipment, he would definitely die under Shi Feng’s swords. Hence, he immediately turned and ran.

“You can’t escape.”

Shi Feng gave Absolute Heaven no chances at all, activating Windwalk immediately. As fast as a ghost, Shi Feng caught up with Absolute Heaven in the blink of an eye. He then let loose his most powerful strength, creating sixteen sword images in the blink of an eye. The sword images fully surrounded Absolute Heaven, the flames released by them looking as if they intended to devour Absolute Heaven.

Absolute Heaven was greatly shocked. There was no way at all for him to stop so many sword images. He then hurriedly activated Wind Steps, using the 1 second invincibility to block all the incoming attacks. With his speed greatly increased, he immediately entered Stealth mode.

“I said, you can not get away!” Shi Feng immediately leaped up, the Silver Lake in his hand releasing the power of fire and thunder towards Absolute Heaven’s path of advancement.

Absolute Heaven knew that this move of Shi Feng’s was immensely powerful. He immediately used Vanish, the 1 second of invincibility allowing him to avoid the damage, and Fainted effect of the Thunder Flame Explosion.

After successfully blocking the Thunder Flame Explosion, Absolute Heaven no longer possessed any lifesaving skills in his arsenal. Just like last time, he was prepared to leap up into the trees, shaking off Shi Feng’s pursuit.

At this moment, he suddenly discovered that he was unable to jump, nor move. Unknown as to when it happened, both his legs had been frozen solid, and even his figure was revealed.

“I’ve already said that you can not escape.” Shi Feng was extremely satisfied with the effect of the Frost Grenade. Once again, he sent a burst of sixteen sword images stabbing at Absolute Heaven.

This time, Absolute Heaven could only go all-out, desperately stopping the incoming attacks with his daggers.

Two swords... Four swords... Six swords...

By the time Absolute Heaven blocked the eleventh sword, he was no longer able to keep up with the remaining sword images. He could only helplessly watch as the sword images stabbed into him, damages of over -300 points, and even -400 points, appearing above his head, one after another. Moreover, the durability of the equipment on his body fell madly.

By the time Absolute Heaven’s HP reached zero, the equipment on his body was all turned to scrape.

Absolute Heaven suffered an incomparable heartache, gnashing his teeth.

All these equipment were gathered by him, one by one, after spending a large amount of time. Yet, they were all destroyed now. The only thing he could rejoice about was that the two Secret-Silver ranked daggers, which were as precious as his own life, were not destroyed.

Soon after, Absolute Heaven’s dead body fell to the ground, an expression of unwillingness displayed on his face.

“I’ve already said that you won’t get away. Your weapon, I’ll gratefully accept!” Shi Feng looked towards the silver-colored dagger that Absolute Heaven dropped with a smile, picking it up.
