Chapter 357 – Three Overlords

“Rule? Of course there’s no such rule!” The Level 133 Berserker laughed when he heard the passing Swordsman’s words. “You must have just arrived at the Thunder Fortress, right? Right now, that person is in charge of the Thunder Fortress, and his word is the law here. That person has stated that all powers looking to stay in the Thunder Fortress must hand over 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, and even hegemonic powers won’t be exempted.”

“Even hegemonic powers aren’t exempted?” Upon hearing the Berserker’s words, one of the cloaked girls standing behind the cloaked Swordsman exclaimed, “Isn’t that too much of an exaggeration? Not to mention, the Thunder Fortress is protected by Tier 5 NPCs. Who could possibly threaten a hegemonic power here?”

Meanwhile, this cloaked girl was none other than Midsummer, who had entered the Miniature Ancient World with Shi Feng.

“You can only say that because you don’t know who that person is,” the Berserker said, shaking his head. “Even in the Greater God’s Domain, the person I’m talking about is an existence akin to god!”

!!

“An existence akin to god? Keep on boasting, why don’t you?” Midsummer said, rolling her eyes.

“If it were in the past, I wouldn’t have believed my own words, either. However, after arriving at the Thunder Fortress, I had no choice but to believe it,” the Berserker said, remaining patient even after seeing Midsummer’s response. “Have you heard of the Paimon Conglomerate before?”

“Of course. That’s one of the few conglomerates in the Greater World,” Midsummer said, nodding.

Upon getting a positive response, the Berserker continued, “The person I’m talking about comes from the Gray Seal family, one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Great Families. More specifically, he is Young Master Dira, the youngest son of the Gray Seal family’s patriarch. He is the one who set the rule I mentioned. There aren’t many powers that would dare to go against that young master even in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone our Miniature Ancient World.”

“Dira? The youngest son of one of Paimon’s Three Overlords?” Midsummer quickly thought of something after hearing the Berserker’s words. Immediately, she turned to Shi Feng and anxiously said through the team chat, “Brother Black Flame, I’m afraid we’re going to meet with some trouble during the World Passage’s opening this time…”

“A sum of 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal is indeed quite a lot,” Wu Xiaoxiao, who had similarly concealed her identity, said. At the same time, she also understood why so many powers would willingly hand over 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.

The youngest son of one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Overlords could indeed be regarded as an existence akin to god in the Greater God’s Domain. Even the Guild leaders of upper-ranking hegemonic powers wouldn’t dare to offend Dira. After all, one word from Dira was most likely enough to have them removed from their positions. As for powers weaker than upper-ranking hegemonic powers, offending Dira was no different than asking to stop existing in the Greater God’s Domain.

However, Wu Xiaoxiao also had to admit that Dira was quite ruthless to be collecting 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal from every power looking to enter the Thunder Fortress.

“The problem I’m talking about isn’t related to Seven Luminaries Crystals,” Midsummer said, shaking her head. “What I’m concerned about is Dira’s hobby!”

“His hobby?” Jun Luosha, who had remained silent this entire time, suddenly spoke up. “Is there a problem with his hobby?”

“There’s a big problem with it!” Midsummer said with a wry smile. “His hobby is collecting paragons, and he will recruit any paragon that catches his eye. This might seem great on the surface since getting recruited by Dira would mean hopping aboard the Paimon Conglomerate’s ship, but that can’t be any further from the truth. The paragons recruited by Dira will not only have to sign their freedom away with a God’s Domain Contract, but the benefits they will receive in exchange might not even be comparable to the internal geniuses of a corporation.”

Dira was incredibly well-known in the Starlight Realm. Firstly, it was because he was the most beloved son of the Divine Seal Saint, one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Overlords. Secondly, it was because he had recruited many non-conglomerate paragons and would have them collect various Legendary Weapons and Equipment for him. Or, more specifically, Dira was snatching the opportunities of these paragons to strengthen himself.

At this point, the name of Black Flame had already become incredibly famous in the Ancient River Kingdom and its surrounding countries. It was also publicly known that Shi Feng wasn’t affiliated with any conglomerate. So, the likelihood of Dira recruiting him was high.

Meanwhile, so long as Shi Feng signed a God’s Domain Contract with Dira, he’d have to spend the rest of his life tied to Dira.

As for putting up a resistance?

If even upper-ranking hegemonic powers dared not offend Dira, what could a paragon with no background possibly do?

“If that’s the case, maybe we should delay meeting up with Big Sis Hidden Soul and the others, Guild Leader. It won’t be too late to group up after the World Passage is open,” Wu Xiaoxiao hurriedly said.

Dira’s identity was extraordinary. However, whether it was joining Dira or rejecting Dira’s invitation, neither was a good option. The best action to take in this situation would be to avoid Dira as much as possible.

Shi Feng did not respond immediately. Instead, he scanned his surroundings for a moment before saying, “Your idea is good, but it seems the other party is one step ahead of you.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Midsummer, Wu Xiaoxiao, and Jun Luosha immediately sensed a person appearing next to their party. The other party was a Level 136, Tier 4 Assassin, and he looked like he was, at most, seventeen or eighteen years old. Yet, despite how young he looked, he gave off an incredibly dangerous feeling comparable to what they felt from Saint Nine.

A paragon comparable to Saint Nine?

Surprise flashed in Jun Luosha’s eyes as she looked at the Assassin youth. Despite being the Green God Corporation’s number one genius, she felt she couldn’t even hold a candle to the Assassin youth before her. Currently, she was still at the standard of ordinary fourth-floor experts, and she would need to make significant improvements before she could reach the standard of titled expert. Yet, the Assassin youth already had strength close to rivaling Saint Nine. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After making a sudden appearance next to Shi Feng’s party, the Assassin youth, with a wooden expression, quietly looked at Shi Feng, showing no intentions of launching a sneak attack.

“Greetings, Guild Leader Black Flame,” the Assassin youth said emotionlessly like a robot. “Young Master Dira has heard about your arrival at the Thunder Fortress, so he has gone out of his way to invite you to the Thunder Restaurant for a meeting.”

“How did you find us so quickly? ” Wu Xiaoxiao was a little astonished by the Assassin youth’s words. It hadn’t been more than half an hour since they got off the flying ship. They had even worn Black Cloaks to hide their identities. Yet, Dira’s henchmen still managed to find them. Their reconnaissance capabilities were truly terrifying.

“It’s simply because they have total control over the fortress,” Shi Feng calmly said as he surveyed his surroundings. “I was wondering why there are so many people fond of staying invisible in the fortress, but by the looks of things, it seems these people are members of Dira’s Shadow Guard Legion.”

“That is correct,” the Assassin youth said, not bothering to hide the fact about the Shadow Guard Legion after realizing that Shi Feng had seen through the Shadow Guards’ concealment. “We are the young master’s Shadow Guards, and we currently have the entire Thunder Fortress under our surveillance. So, I suggest you abandon any thoughts of leaving the Thunder Fortress. Even Trecht, the current rank-one player on the God List, shouldn’t think of leaving the Thunder Fortress once he sets foot into this place.”

“You…”

Midsummer was incensed by the Assassin youth’s words. However, she also realized that the moment the Assassin youth announced that he was Dira’s envoy, their party no longer had a choice. They’d be publicly offending him if they refused to meet with Dira. He’d have a justifiable reason to take action against them at that time. Yet, if they chose to meet with Dira, there would likely be only one outcome.

“Since Young Master Dira is inviting me with such sincerity, lead the way, then,” Shi Feng calmly said.
