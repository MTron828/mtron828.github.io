Chapter 381 - Attacks from Above and Below

Sharlyn was a Tier 4 Great Divine Official. The information she had access to would definitely surpass a player like Shi Feng.

The fact that she knew about the Destroyer of Immortality proved this point.

Should I wait a little longer? Shi Feng pondered in silence as he looked at the translucent sword that penetrated the ground.

Now that the Destroyer of Immortality had awakened, he could take on the Legacy Trial anytime he wanted to. He could slowly build his strength before challenging the trial. That way, he would have a higher chance of successfully clearing it.

After all, as one of the Ten Great Saint Legacies, the consequences of failure would be severe. It might turn out just as Sharlyn had guessed.

Death!

Heaven-blessed individuals were immortal existences, being able to resurrect infinitely. Yet, despite knowing this, Sharlyn had still made such an ominous claim. This proved that the penalty of failure would be unbearable, and players would have no choice but to delete their accounts and start all over again.

The wisest choice for Shi Feng right now was to first increase his strength before challenging the Saint Legacy’s trial.

However, after campaigning in God’s Domain for a decade, Shi Feng understood one thing clearly.

Life in God’s Domain was like a boat sailing against the current; either he kept going forward, or he would fall behind.

Pursuing stability constantly was not enough. Sometimes, one needed to take risks to achieve a breakthrough. Moreover, Shi Feng did not have too much time to waste.

Risks and opportunities coexisted.

The sooner he obtained the Saint Legacy, the smoother his path towards godhood would be. Originally, Shi Feng had not been certain that he could become a Tier 5 class in this life. To do so, he had to plan and prepare carefully. As for becoming a Tier 6 god-ranked class, that was nigh impossible. That was the apex of God’s Domain. How could something like that be so easy to achieve?

Shi Feng was aware of his own capabilities. His current performance right now was only amazing due to his decade of experience playing God’s Domain. It was not possible to walk the path toward godhood just by having a few additional years of experience. However, if he gained one of the Ten Great Saint Classes earlier on, coupling it with careful planning and preparation, he would have a better chance of becoming a god.

Shi Feng stepped up to the Destroyer of Immortality. He then grabbed the golden hilt of the sword. When he tried to pull the translucent blade out of the ground, however, it did not budge. No matter how much strength Shi Feng exerted, the sword remained firmly stuck in the floor. Instead, the sound of a system notification reached his ears.

System: Do you wish to accept the Legacy Trial? (Remaining time: 23 hours 54 minutes)

“Well, shit.” Shi Feng bitterly smiled.

The Destroyer of Immortality never intended to give him a chance to raise his strength.

Sighing, Shi Feng accepted the trial.

Suddenly, the Destroyer of Immortality released a divine golden light, enveloping Shi Feng. In the next moment, both the Destroyer of Immortality and Shi Feng vanished from the room.

“Space Transfer?” Sharlyn’s eyes flashed with surprise at both Shi Feng’s and the Destroyer of Immortality’s sudden disappearance.

A powerful barrier protected the Stargazing Tower, and all forms of teleportation magic were rendered ineffective here, regardless of whether said magic was used to enter or leave the Tower. Yet, the Destroyer of Immortality had effortlessly accomplished this feat.

“Hopefully, that little dummy can pass the trials.” Sharlyn smiled faintly, gazing at the spot where Shi Feng had stood a moment ago. “Awakening that sword drained me to such a degree. I’ll have to rest for a long time. I let him off too lightly by taking only 500 Gold. The next time we meet, I’ll collect this debt...with interest.”

---

At this moment, Shi Feng was at a complete loss.

In the blink of an eye, he arrived in a dimly illuminated field. Swords were everywhere, from the sky to the earth. This place was literally a world of swords.

In the distance, Shi Feng could see a mountain piercing the sky. A faint, silver glow radiated from the mountain’s peak, and it was the only source of light in this dim world.

System: You have discovered the Origin Sword Domain.

System: You are in a unique realm. All forms of communications have been sealed. You are unable to make contact with the outside world.

“It would seem that this Origin Sword Domain is independent of God’s Domain.” Shi Feng tried to call up the system map. However, the map was blank. Shi Feng then took a look at his surroundings. As far as the eye could see, other than the mountain in the distance, there was nothing but flatlands. Moreover, the further one traveled from the mountain, the darker it would become. “It looks like the only exit is at the peak of that mountain.”

Shi Feng then examined the swords stabbed into the ground, all of which were immovable. Some even resembled buildings and plants. Unlike flowers and trees, however, Shi Feng would receive damage if he touched these blades.

To put it simply, he needed to avoid these swords as he advanced.

As for the swords suspended in the sky, so long as he did not fly, they weren’t a threat.

However, this world only took a moment to correct that assumption. After Shi Feng took a few steps forward, several swords descended from the sky. One of them just happened to slice past his arm, causing -200 damage.

“Crap! Raining swords?!” Shi Feng looked at the swords around him, realizing why so many swords pierced the ground.

Moreover, the swords that descended from the sky dealt a lot more damage than the swords on the ground.

“I’m guessing this trial requires players to avoid the swords on the ground while dodging the swords descending from the sky?” Shi Feng remained still for the moment. He silently observed his surroundings, searching for the best path towards the mountain.

He chose to stand still because the moment he moved, the swords in the sky would start to fall. Most likely, the swords in the sky were set to fall based on the player’s movements.

“Sure enough, this world is trying to kill me.”

After waiting for a moment, Shi Feng discovered that the swords in the sky had not fallen. However, before he could rejoice over this discovery, the swords in the ground started trembling, and one after another, these swords sunk into the ground, vanishing completely.

Feeling that something was amiss, Shi Feng kept his gaze on the ground beneath his feet.

Suddenly, tens of swords sprung up from the ground beneath him, soaring into the sky.

Reacting quickly, Shi Feng performed a backflip, dodging these blades. However, due to his backflip, the swords above plunged towards him.

“This is a joke, right?” Shi Feng immediately unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and Purgatory’s Shadow, defending against the incoming flying swords. One after another, blades of light struck the flying swords, scattering them.

After these attacks, Shi Feng finally realized that this world intended to toy with him until he died.

If he rested, the swords on the ground would attack him after a short time. If he moved, the swords hovering in the sky would rain down on him.

Such an attack pattern allowed him little to no time to rest or recover, keeping him on guard.

Shi Feng also discovered something else. The swords that descended from the sky were growing more accurate and faster as he advanced.

“Is this place trying to exhaust me to death?” Shi Feng’s lips curled up slightly with amusement.

Immediately, he switched out the Aura of Space on the Seven Luminaries Ring for the Aura of Wind, increasing both his Movement Speed and Attack Speed by 40% and Agility by 30%. He then dashed towards the distant mountain.

The moment Shi Feng moved, the countless blades in the sky began their assault. They all turned their blades towards Shi Feng and shot towards him. However, Shi Feng was like a gust of wind. Relying on his Movement Speed alone, he avoided most of the attacks. In addition, his increased Attack Speed allowed him to strike down the remaining swords effortlessly as he darted onward.

However, after running for a few minutes, the ground in front of Shi Feng suddenly split apart. In the next moment, bone knights in silver armor crawled out of the fissure, every one of them emitting frightening killing intent as they rushed towards him.
