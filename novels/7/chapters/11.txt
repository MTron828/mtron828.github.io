Chapter 12 - A Timeful Parry

System: Player Quiet Wolf has attacked you and entered a Yellow Name state. Duration of one hour. Any players who attack Yellow Name players will not receive any penalty.

Shi Feng only had 31 HP remaining. Being attacked from both sides by the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf, put Shi Feng in a very dangerous position.

“Despicable!”Standing at a distance, Blackie scolded Quiet Wolf for sneaking an attack at such a moment. However, he couldn’t change a thing about it. The two of them were too far apart. It was too hard for him to land a hit on Quiet Wolf. He could only aim his attack on the Snow Fox, hoping to kill it off a second earlier and not letting Quiet Wolf profit off of them.

Although mages had high output, compared to hitting monsters, it was far harder to land a hit on players unless they stood still without moving.This was because the moment the Dark Arrow shot out, there would be a prediction line appearing. In a situation where the distance was great, players with good standards could usually dodge it. If it was an expert, then dodging it would be a piece of cake.

Just as the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf were about to rush up...The corners of Shi Feng’s mouth revealed a cold smile. He had been interacting with Quiet Wolf in Shadow for years now, so he was extremely familiar with Quiet Wolf’s strengths and habits. Shi Feng took two steps back, forming a perfect triangle between the Snow Fox and Quiet Wolf. Shi Feng gripped the Novice Sword tightly in front of his chest. He stood there without moving as he awaited the arrival of their attacks.

“Did he give up?”Quiet Wolf started looking down on Shi Feng when he saw Shi Feng preparing to block with his sword. Although players could reduce the damage received by defending the attack, the Snow Fox was an Elite. Even if Shi Feng could defend it, the attack would still cause around 50 damage. With just 31 HP remaining, Shi Feng couldn’t even take a hit.

The Snow Fox was a step ahead, biting towards Shi Feng.

Tearing Bite!“Just in time.” Instead of retreating, Shi Feng advanced. He rushed towards the Snow Fox.

The Novice Sword blocked the Snow Fox in its mouth. Using the lifesaving skill Parry, Shi Feng could block a frontal attack once. Shi Feng then continued by lifting the Snow Fox. The Snow Fox had low power, so Shi Feng had easily tossed it towards Quiet Wolf.Everything happened too quickly.Quiet Wolf who was rushing towards Shi Feng could not react in time. In an instant, his shoulder was bitten by the Snow Fox.

A damage of -164 appeared on Quiet Wolf’s head. His HP was instantly cleared down to zero.

“How?” Quiet Wolf was unbelievably shocked. His heart was filled with unwillingness as he stared at Shi Feng’s ridiculing smile. He never imagined that players could do such a thing. If he had known about it, he definitely wouldn’t rush forward, just to get himself killed.

At this point, regardless of how unwilling Quiet Wolf was, his HP had turned to 0. His body could only fall and turn into starlight. He had even dropped a piece of equipment.In the distance, Blackie became dumbfounded. He had even forgotten to attack the Snow Fox.“Blackie, stop daydreaming! Hurry up and attack the Snow Fox!” Shi Feng yelled and rushed at the Snow Fox again.

After Blackie started reacting again, he chanted a curse, madly attacking the Snow Fox.

Without Quiet Wolf’s disturbance, the near-death Snow Fox was just a decoration. Within 10 seconds, the Snow Fox released a wail before falling down.

System: [Rare Elite] Cunning Snow Fox killed. Obtained 130 EXP.Shi Feng was Level 2 now, so this amount of EXP was nothing to him. What Shi Feng was concerned about was the loot. Rare Elites were the love of all God’s Domain players because of their shocking drop rates. Furthermore, this was the First Kill of the Snow Fox, so the loot must be even better.

“It can’t be. It actually dropped a weapon.” Shi Feng obtained a Staff an Armguard.

[Blackwood Staff] (Bronze Rank)

Level 1

Equipment Requirements: Strength 5

Attack Power +8

Intelligence +3, Vitality +1, Mana +30 Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Durability 20/20This equipment would greatly strengthen a mage. Not only was its Attack Power high, it even gave an additional 3 Intelligence. If a mage equipped it, then their damage might increase up to two levels.

[Fox Skin Gloves] (Common Rank, Leather Armor)

Level 1

Equipment Requirements: Strength 3

Defense +4

Durability 20/20

On the other hand, Quiet Wolf had contributed a pair of Level 0 Common Leathered Shoes with +3 Defense.

“And here I thought it was some Gray Trash Equipment. It seems Quiet Wolf’s luck isn’t that bad, being able to obtain a piece of Common Equipment.” Shi Feng had a different view of Quiet Wolf now. Obtaining a piece of Common Equipment at the starting period of the game definitely depended on luck. However, Quiet Wolf’s luck now benefited Shi Feng instead. Swordsmen could wear both Plate Armor and Cloth Armor. Now that Shi Feng had two of these new items, his Defense had increased by a lot.

“Blackie, your equipment.” Shi Feng passed the Blackwood Staff to Blackie.

However, Blackie did not receive the equipment. He had a hesitant look on his face. Killing the Snow Fox depended entirely on Shi Feng. Blackie wasn’t of much help, yet he had received the best equipment; a piece of Bronze Equipment no less. At this stage of the game, there weren’t many players capable of owning such an item. It was extremely valuable.

“What’s happened to you; aren’t we good brothers? Why are you being courteous with me? Besides, you’re a Cursemancer. Once you’ve reached Level 1, you can fully exert the staff’s greatest capabilities. With that, we can level even faster.” Shi Feng said in a serious tone as if he knew what Blackie was thinking.

After some thought, Blackie was able to make sense of it. He no longer refused it, saying, “Thanks. I’ll definitely use it properly.”

“Now. that’s much better.” Shi Feng laughed, “Let’s go. We’re going to Dark-Moon Valley.”

Red Leaf Town.“Quiet Wolf, what were you even doing? Not only did you die, you’ve even dropped a piece of expensive Equipment. Do you know how precious that Equipment is?” Flaming Tiger snapped as he cursed.

Quiet Wolf’s expression was as gloomy as dark water. That pair of shoes was something he had obtained after grinding for 7 hours, and now he had actually lost it. Even his heart was bleeding right now. Although he had wanted to explain, he did not know how to. Should he say how he was toyed with by Shi Feng? That wasn’t something he was willing to admit. However, even if he wanted to snatch the equipment back, he wasn’t an opponent for Shi Feng.“Brother Tiger, I discovered a Rare Elite in the wild. I didn’t think I would be discovered by that kid when I was about to kill off the Elite. That kid had even brought along another person. In a one versus three situation, I wasn’t their opponent at all.” Quiet Wolf pretended to be enraged as he turned black into white. He continuously tempted Flaming Tiger. “That brat should have killed the Rare Elite by now. He must’ve obtained some good equipment. They were on the path towards Dark Moon Valley. We could still catch up to them if we chase after them. We might even be able to get back the equipment.”

“Rare Elite!?” Flaming Tiger’s eyes started to shine. He no longer questioned Quiet Wolf. Instead, he was extremely interested in the loot of the Rare Elite. He said excitedly. “Let’s go. We’ll immediately chase after them. They actually dare to steal my equipment. I will make them regret even playing God’s Domain.”Within a short moment, Flaming Tiger gathered all the members of Shadow Workshop present in Red Leaf Town. He brought along 11 Workshop members and rushed towards Dark Moon Valley. No matter what, he wanted to kill off Shi Feng and obtain his equipment.

At this moment, Shi Feng and Blackie had already arrived at Dark Moon Valley.There was a smithy beside the flowing creek. Shi Feng and Blackie quietly stood in front of it. They were looking at a barechested, middle-aged uncle. In his hand, the man wielded a steel hammer. Ding! Dang! He kept hammering on the crimson red ore.

Time slowly flowed by, bit by bit.

“Brother Feng, are we still going to wait? It’s already been half an hour now.” Blackie said.

“We have to wait. Without patience, he won’t give us the Quest.” Shi Feng affirmed.

In his previous life, Hammer Trading had passed by this place on accident. He had discovered a smithy here. However, the blacksmith here didn’t pay any attention to him regardless of how Hammer Trading talked to him. This had enraged Hammer Trading, so he decided to drag it on with the blacksmith. He kept standing to the side, sending death glares to the blacksmith. He had never imagined that after some time, the blacksmith would actively speak up. Not only that, the blacksmith even gave out a Hidden Quest. This had allowed Hammer Trading to learn the Forging Talent, becoming the Forging Master of the era.

When Shi Feng thought about obtaining the Forging Talent, coupling it with the Book Of Forging, advancing into an Advanced Forging Apprentice became a very easy task. When that time came, Gold Coins would rain into his pockets.

After waiting for more than ten minutes...“Do you two have an interested in Forging?” The middle-aged blacksmith suddenly asked.

“Yes, sir. We’ve loved Forging since we were young.” Shi Feng immediately said.

The middle-aged blacksmith nodded his head, saying in a satisfied tone, “Then since you love Forging, I can teach it to you. But first, could you help me retrieve 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore? They can be found on the West side of Crimson Star Mine.”

“Of course. We would gladly be at your service.” Shi Feng respectfully answered.

System: Hidden Quest ‘Road Of Forging’ accepted. Player is requested by Forging Master Jack to obtain 100 pieces of Meteorite Ore from Crimson Star Mine.

Crimson Star Mine was the nest of Level 4 Kobolds. These monsters loved ore the most. They would spend everyday mining within the mines. As such, Kobolds were born with great strength. However, they had short limbs. Because they stayed underground for long periods of time, their range of vision was short. They could only detect enemies within a 35-yard distance. This distance was also the maximum range of attack for a mage.

At the mine’s entrance, there were many Kobolds walking around. An entire group of them would be attracted even if only one of them was attacked.

[Kobold]

Level 4

HP 420

“Here. First, some food and drink to fill ourselves. We’ll start work after that.” Shi Feng brought out a Black Steel Beer and an Apple Pie.

Blackie didn’t understand what Shi Feng was trying to do, but since it was Shi Feng’s request, he must have his own reasons. Blackie sat down and started eating.

Ten seconds after eating the Apple Pie, all of Blackie’s attributes were suddenly increased by +1 points, the effect lasting 30 minutes.

After drinking the Black Steel Beer, Blackie’s vision started becoming hazy. When he looked at the distant Level 4 Kobolds, their Levels were suddenly reduced by 2; becoming Level 2.“Alright, let’s start then. A bottle of Black Steel Beer’s drunken effect only lasts 30 minutes.” Shi Feng stood up. He took out a Smoke Bomb and walked closer to the mine’s entrance. Then, he threw it at the group of Level 4 Kobolds; there were currently over ten of them there.

[Smoke Bomb]

Able to reduce the visibility in a radius of 10 by 10 yards. Duration of one hour.

The Smoke Bomb was able to reduce a monster’s vision by 10 yards. It wasn’t particularly useful against other monsters. However, it was great when facing Kobolds. Their vision was now reduced to 25 yards. As long as a mage attacked from a 30-yard distance, the Kobolds would not be able to spot them at all. They could only stand there and wait for their deaths.“Attack.” Shi Feng pointed to the Kobolds within the smoke.

Blackie was half-doubting Shi Feng’s actions, but he still chose to believe in Shi Feng. His mouth started chanting a curse. A moment later, a Dark Arrow shot out, landing directly on the foremost Kobold.
