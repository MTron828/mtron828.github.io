Chapter 468 - Ninth Heaven Pavilion

In just a short moment, news about Shi Feng’s sudden appearance had spread throughout Blackwing City.

“Have you heard? There’s a player wearing a full Dark-Gold Set Equipment.”

“Heard about it? I saw that player with my own eyes! You don’t know just how imposing he looked! He was like a ferocious tiger! He had only glanced at me, and my entire body trembled!”

“Ah, a Dark-Gold Set Equipment. It would be awesome to wear one.”

“Don’t even think about it. The various Guilds throughout God’s Domain can’t even obtain a Fine-Gold Set Equipment, let alone Dark-Gold. With a Dark-Gold Set Equipment, PvP and Dungeon raiding would be child’s play. If an expert wears the set, they will become practically invincible.”

“Do you think that person will sell his Dark-Gold Set Equipment?”

“Sell? Are you insane? Do you even know the significance of a Dark-Gold Set Equipment? A Dark-Gold Set Equipment is the best equipment currently available in God’s Domain by far. This set could even become the symbol of a Guild, attracting countless players to join. On top of that, the rise in combat power the set provides would make grinding and Dungeon raiding far easier. It would play a huge role in one’s future development. If it were up to me, I would rather sell my house than sell my Dark-Gold Set Equipment.”

“I guess you’re right. If purchased with Credits, a Dark-Gold Set Equipment should be worth at least two million. Including its ability to increase a Guild’s influence, it is worth more than a single house located in the city center.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The players occupying the streets and alleys of Blackwing City discussed Shi Feng. They envied and admired his Dark-Gold Set Equipment. Before, many of them had dreamed of equipping a Fine-Gold Set Equipment themselves. Yet, now, someone actually wore a Dark-Gold Set Equipment. No, to be precise, someone ran around Blackwing City while wearing a house...

While players talked about Shi Feng, the various Guild representatives in Blackwing City overworked themselves as they followed Shi Feng while reporting back to their respective Guilds. Currently, they no longer had the serenity befitting an upper-manager of a Guild as their anxiety was on full display.

This has worked out quite well. Shi Feng revealed a faint smile as he glanced at the various Guild representatives behind him.

Although he was in Blackwing City, it would not be so easy to sell out of the Dragonscale Set Equipment quickly.

Soon, Shi Feng found a high-class restaurant and rested for a moment.

Before Shi Feng could get comfortable, a few players abruptly sat across from him. These players were all Level 25 and above, and their equipment was at least Secret-Silver rank. One could easily tell that these were not ordinary players. They would be the center of attention on the streets of any other city. However, they could not compete with Shi Feng. Shi Feng’s Dark-Gold Set Equipment was as dazzling as the sun, and one would find it difficult not to notice.

“What business do you have with me?” Shi Feng spoke softly as glanced up at these players.

These players felt their chests tighten under Shi Feng’s pinning gaze, and their opinions of the player before them rose.

“Friend, please don’t misunderstand us. This humble one is called Swallow Nine. We noticed your extraordinary bearing, and that you wear a full Dark-Gold Set Equipment, so there is certainly no need to discuss your strength. We have also noticed that you are an independent player. We few are the representatives of major Guilds, and we want to extend invitations to our Guilds.”

The one who spoke was an elegant middle-aged man with a thin figure. On his chest, the man wore the Guild Emblem of a Super Guild, the Ninth Heaven Pavilion. Compared to the other representatives before Shi Feng, it was obvious that the power supporting Swallow Nine was far more extensive.

If first-rate Guilds were the princes and princesses of the virtual gaming world, then Super Guilds were emperors and empresses. Whether regarding financial powers, influence, or history of Super Guilds, first-rate Guilds could not compare to any of them.

In God’s Domain, a first-rate Guild was capable of controlling the majority of a kingdom’s territory. A Super Guild, however, possessed the capacity to control one or two empire’s territories. One could just imagine how massive the gap was between the two.

Meanwhile, Ninth Heaven Pavilion was a rather ancient Super Guild. Before the appearance of God’s Domain, they had been the overlords of several dozen large-scale virtual reality games. They had long since created a gigantic virtual empire for themselves. However, due to the appearance of God’s Domain, many virtual reality games had lost their markets. Thus, the Ninth Heaven Pavilion focused their investments on God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, the fact that the middle-aged man before Shi Feng was the Guild representative of the Ninth Heaven Pavilion spoke volumes of his abilities.

“I’m waiting for someone. I also have no interest in joining any Guild, so please leave!” Shi Feng expressed his impatience, going so far as to reveal a trace of killing intent.

Shi Feng’s strength allowed him to face a Lord as an equal. After going berserk, he could even overwhelm a Lord ranked monster.

After living in God’s Domain for a time, players’ intuitions had improved somewhat. Even ordinary players could vaguely sense things such as killing intent, let alone elites and expert players. If Shi Feng casually released a little killing intent, he could inflict a suffocating fear onto an ordinary player; the feeling was more intense for elites and experts who could sense killing intent with more clarity.

So strong! Swallow Nine was inwardly shocked.

Although Shi Feng had not taken any action, he could feel how powerful Shi Feng was. The Swordsman before him was definitely not an ordinary expert, and he was someone who could rival even the top powerhouses in the Ninth Heaven Pavilion. If factoring in his equipment, the top powerhouses of the Ninth Heaven Pavilion might not even be a match for Shi Feng in a one-on-one fight.

However, this revelation had only served to excite Swallow Nine further.

“Friend, if you are not willing to join, why don’t we become friends?” Swallow Nine did not mind Shi Feng’s killing intent at all. Smiling, he said, “With such strength, I believe that you must have a lot of weapons and equipment that you do not need. I am willing to purchase your items 20% higher than market value. How about it?”

The other representatives had nodded in agreement, though they were not as calm and carefree as Swallow Nine.

They had never thought, even for a second, that Shi Feng would join their Guilds. Experts of this level normally had quirky personalities and would never submit. Meanwhile, joining a Guild meant accepting someone else’s control. Shi Feng would not agree to such an invitation. However, seeing that Shi Feng was an expert capable of possessing a Dark-Gold Set Equipment, he should have many other top-tier weapons and equipment. Even if Shi Feng did not possess an extra Dark-Gold Set Equipment, at the very least, he should have a stock of Dark-Gold or Fine-Gold ranked items.

Such items were extremely difficult to purchase.

It was common knowledge that top-tier equipment could not be bought from the market. Even top-tier Workshops would keep such equipment for themselves; they definitely would not sell it. If one wished to obtain such equipment, they could only rely on themselves. However, it was easier said than done.

Now that they had encountered such a rare opportunity, naturally, they could not let it get away.

“You wish to buy my items?” Shi Feng laughed. With disdain, he then said, “Do you think you can afford them?”

“If you have something to sell, regardless of how many items there are, I, Swallow Nine, guarantee that I will purchase all of them at 20% above market value. If you have top-tier equipment, I will purchase it at 50% above market value,” Swallow Nine confidently declared.

“Right! Our Guilds have no issues doing the same,” the other representatives promptly voiced their agreement. Although their Guilds could not compare to the Ninth Heaven Pavilion, they were still major Guilds. They had more than enough money to purchase a single expert’s extra equipment.

“Hahaha! Interesting! Interesting!” Shi Feng suddenly laughed.

However, Shi Feng’s actions only made Swallow Nine and the others turn to look at each other.

“One thousand Gold. If you have 1,000 Gold on your persons right now, I will consider letting you look at the equipment I no longer need. Otherwise, scram! Find someone else to disturb!”
