Chapter 3833 - 907 - Endless Scars

“Let me start with the introductions.” After the agile-looking girl returned to her seat, Xia Qingying gestured toward Shi Feng and said, “This person here is Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame. As for this beautiful woman…”

“Endless Scars, right?” Shi Feng said before Xia Qingying could finish speaking.

“Do you know me?” The veiled woman stared at Shi Feng as if sizing him up. Yet, at the same time, it didn’t seem like she was looking at Shi Feng specifically.

“Have you seen Scars’s real appearance before?” Xia Qingying looked at Shi Feng in astonishment.

Xia Qingying wasn’t surprised that Shi Feng knew Endless Scars’s name. After all, Endless Scars was a very well-known figure in their God’s Domain. At one point, she was even recognized as the strongest player, having accomplished many unimaginable achievements. Even the Green God Corporation’s chairman couldn’t resist meeting and chatting with Endless Scars in person.

However, despite her fame, few people had ever seen Endless Scars’s real appearance. Xia Qingying only met Endless Scars in person because she was the Green God Corporation’s liaison with Endless Scars. Even now, the other senior vice presidents and Grand Elders of the Green God Corporation still did not know what Endless Scars looked like. They only knew that she existed.

“It’s just a hunch,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Out of the experts who have gone missing in our God’s Domain, I can only think of a few.”

Shi Feng recognized Endless Scars at first glance only because they were acquaintances in his previous life. Without his past life’s memories, he would never have recognized her. After all, the highest position he had achieved in the first ten years of playing God’s Domain in this timeline was the Guild Leader of Shadow, a second-rate Guild. There was no way he could become acquainted with a big shot like Endless Scars.

However, after meeting Endless Scars in this timeline, Shi Feng couldn’t help but admit that she had greatly exceeded his expectations. He had never expected her to be so terrifying…

A two-star great grandmaster on the verge of the three-star great grandmaster standard…

This was a standard that Endless Scars had never achieved in Shi Feng’s previous life. Her mental strength was already comparable to the old monsters of apex powers.

“You have quite an accurate intuition,” Endless Scars stated calmly.

“How boring. Couldn’t you have at least pretended to be surprised?” Xia Qingying shook her head and sighed when she saw Shi Feng’s calm reaction. “Anyway, you guessed correctly. Scars is the great senior I mentioned to you before. It is also thanks to her that newcomers like you get to live in a third-tier mobile city as soon as you enter the Greater World.”

“Because of Miss Scars?” His curiosity piqued, Shi Feng asked, “Could Miss Scars be the executive of a major power?”

It wasn’t easy to convince a third-tier mobile city to offer such a privilege to an entire world. After all, there were countless people immigrating into the Greater World from countless parallel worlds at all times. There was also a limit to how many inhabitants each mobile city could accommodate.

“It’s a pity, but you’ve guessed wrong!” Xia Qingying said, grinning. “Scars has established her own adventurer team in the Greater God’s Domain. She has also received the favor of one of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s Grand Elders, so she can be considered one of Eternal’s Internal Elders. As for Scars’s adventurer team, although it isn’t well-known in most Realms, it is incredibly famous in the Twelve Sanctuaries.”

“What is the adventurer team’s name?” Shi Feng asked curiously.

“The Angel Sanctuary’s Blood Wing adventurer team!” Xia Qingying answered proudly. “Although Blood Wing doesn’t have many members, it closely rivals the Angel Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers. Even the Angel Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers have to treat her with respect.”

The Blood Wing adventurer team? 

Although Shi Feng had never heard of this name before, he still couldn’t help but admire Endless Scars.

For players of their God’s Domain, simply establishing a foothold in the Greater God’s Domain could already be considered a significant achievement. Yet, Endless Scars had managed to entrench herself in the Twelve Sanctuaries and even make a name for herself there.

“As for this little girl here, she is Drifting Bean, Blood Wing’s latest chosen one. Don’t let her age fool you; her ranking on the Divine Glory List is higher than yours,” Xia Qingying said, pointing at the girl sitting obediently beside Endless Scars.

“Big Sis Xia, enough with the introductions. I know he is Zero Wing’s Guild Leader and an expert on the Divine Glory List. Let’s hurry up and take off. It’d be bad if we are late,” Drifting Bean interrupted, finding Xia Qingying long-winded. She wasn’t interested in learning about Shi Feng in the slightest.

Most experts on the Divine Glory List were jokes in the eyes of the Twelve Sanctuaries’ players. Only those ranked among the Divine Glory List’s top 30 were worthy of admiration, while those who weren’t even ranked among the top 100 were inconsequential.

“I guess you’re right.” At Drifting Bean’s reminder, Xia Qingying realized that now wasn’t the time for lengthy conversations. “I’ll inform the captain to take off immediately.”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A minute later, the Green God Corporation’s private plane took off from Star Lake City and departed for Desolate Star City at a speed far exceeding the speed of sound.

…

When Desolate Star City was a second-tier mobile city, it operated in a remote part of the Starlight Continent. However, after becoming a first-tier mobile city, it quickly moved to the continent’s central region. This put it in close proximity to Star Lake City, so the Green God Corporation’s private plane reached the city’s airport in less than six hours.

When the Green God Corporation’s private plane arrived, the airport, which could accommodate over a thousand passenger planes, was packed. Passenger planes landed and took off from the airport once every few seconds.

When Xia Qingying and the others alighted from the plane, the head attendant in charge of welcoming arriving guests sensed the powerful mental fluctuations Endless Scars radiated. She immediately approached the group and said respectfully, “Welcome to Desolate Star City. As the city is celebrating its promotion, all arrivals must present an invitation to enter the city. Guests without an invitation can only enter the city after the celebrations. Furthermore, all passenger planes can only stop at the airport for fifteen minutes.”

“Here is our invitation,” Drifting Bean said as she handed the head attendant a silver invitation.

“Distinguished Silver Guests, please follow me.” When the head attendant saw the silver invitation, she behaved even more respectfully. She didn’t even bother to lead Xia Qingying’s group into the arrival hall, where a long line of people was waiting to go through the formalities for entering the city. Instead, she summoned a limousine and drove the group into Desolate Star City.

“Crap! Why don’t they have to wait in line?” a young man queued up in the arrival hall grumbled in dissatisfaction. “I’m also an invited guest, so why must I wait in line here?”

“Little friend, you might have been invited, but you only received a bronze invitation. Did you not see that girl’s silver invitation? You need to be from a conglomerate, at the very least, to receive a silver invitation,” an old man waiting in line behind the grumbling young man said. “The trade fair this time is extraordinary, and many big shots have been invited. Those are not people that we can afford to offend.”

After hearing this, the young man shrank back and dared not say anything more.
