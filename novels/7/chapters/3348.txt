Chapter 423 – Extravagant Reinforcements

How generous of the Divine Seal Saint.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but be astonished when he saw the God’s Domain Association’s public bounty list. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

One hundred thousand Star Coins per head!

Moreover, this was only the bounty on normal Zero Wing members. The bounties on Zero Wing’s executive members were worth upwards of three million, and Zero Wing’s core executives were worth upwards of ten million. The bounty for Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame was even worth one hundred million Star Coins.

The total value of the Divine Seal Saint’s bounties was already comparable to the average corporation’s liquid capital. Meanwhile, the only condition to claim these bounties was to ensure that the targets could not log into God’s Domain for the rest of their lives.

This was a fatal condition.

Setting aside how easy it was to erase the Immortal Souls of a bunch of Tier 3 and Tier 4 players in God’s Domain, even if that wasn’t an option, there were still plenty of other methods that one could use in the real world to permanently prevent a person from logging into God’s Domain.

With such a loose clear condition and lucrative rewards, even two- and three-star mental strength grandmasters might be tempted to take action.

Fortunately, none of the Greater World’s two- and three-star mental strength grandmasters could enter Zero Wing’s homeworld. In addition, the Miniature Ancient World had returned to being in a sealed state, and it would be a long time before World Passage would open again. So, it was incredibly challenging for players to destroy another player’s Immortal Soul in the current Miniature Ancient World.

Shortly after Shi Feng started browsing the bounty list, he suddenly received a call from Hidden Soul.

“You’re finally offline, Guild Leader. Thank goodness you are okay. Otherwise, we’re going to be in big trouble over here,” Hidden Soul said, sighing in relief when she saw Shi Feng through the holographic projection.

“Did something happen while I was away?” Shi Feng curiously asked.

Currently, he, Hidden Soul, and Gentle Snow were staying at the God’s Domain Association, so their safety was essentially guaranteed. After all, no power in the Greater World would dare to poke at the Association’s bottom line.

In addition, now that they were members of the Star Lake Legion, they wouldn’t have to worry about not earning enough contribution points and getting kicked out of the city.

“A city battle is starting in six hours. Including you, me, and Snow, our battle group only has five people in total, and the two rookies we managed to recruit have taken a huge risk by joining us. If you are absent, our battle group won’t be able to avoid demotion, and we will even lose our qualifications to participate in the next city battle…” Hidden Soul said with a wry smile.

There existed intense competition between the Star Lake Legion’s various battle groups. If a battle group failed to achieve a sufficiently good result in a city battle, not only would it be demoted, but it might even lose its qualifications to participate in the next city battle, and it would have no choice but to start from scratch and compete with other unqualified battle groups for qualifications. Not even ace battle groups were an exception to this arrangement.

Fortunately, Shi Feng’s battle group started out as an ace battle group. So long as Shi Feng was in attendance, they would have one opportunity to avoid demotion. So, even if they did poorly because of the Divine Seal Saint’s bounty preventing them from recruiting sufficient members, they could still participate in the next city battle.

“Five in total? That’s quite a few.” Shi Feng nodded, feeling very pleased by this piece of news.

Although Star Lake City wasn’t under the Paimon Conglomerate’s jurisdiction, the conglomerate possessed extraordinary influence in the Greater World. Moreover, the fact that the Divine Seal Saint had placed a bounty on Zero Wing meant that anyone who cooperated with Zero Wing would be making an enemy out of him.

In the entire Starlight Realm, even upper-ranking hegemonic powers dared not offend the Divine Seal Saint unless absolutely necessary.

So, it was incredibly courageous of the two rookies to join Shi Feng’s battle group in this situation.

“How are you still in the mood for jokes, Guild Leader?!” Hidden Soul rolled her eyes at Shi Feng. “If our battle group still can’t recruit enough members for the next city battle, it might not just end with us getting disqualified from subsequent city battles. We might even be forced to disband!”

It might seem like one’s future would become smooth sailing after joining a city legion, but that couldn’t be farther from the case. Unless one continuously made advancements, one would quickly get relegated to a position of insignificance. At that time, the amount of contribution points one could earn would plummet. Meanwhile, if one couldn’t earn sufficient contribution points, even if one remained in the city legion, one’s situation would be no different than players outside the city legion.

This was because contribution points were an absolute necessity for people seeking to settle in any city in the Greater World. Even conglomerates could not avoid this situation.

The Greater World’s real estate, particularly prime real estate, was leased to individuals and organizations. Apart from having to pay the basic rental fee, individuals and powers seeking to lease a plot of prime real estate would also have to participate in an auction to win the leasing rights. Meanwhile, so long as an individual or power had sufficient city contribution points, it could even occupy an entire city.

Meanwhile, the quickest way to earn a large amount of Contribution Points was by participating in urban warfare. This was also why the various powers were eagerly looking to send their members into city legions.

“You speak as if we’ve already given up on the city battle this time,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “We cannot give up on it. City battles occur randomly. If we miss this one, who knows when the next city battle will take place.”

“But…there are only five of us…” Hidden Soul said in exasperation. “Battle groups participating in a city battle would typically have 20 members. With only five of us, even protecting an occupied territory will be a challenge, let alone occupying the enemy’s territories. Meanwhile, all battle groups participating in the city battle this time must secure two territories for a passing grade. There’s no way we can complete this test with just two people.”

“If we don’t have enough members, we can call for reinforcements,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Quickly go and get ready. It’d be bad if we arrived late.”

“Reinforcements?” Hidden Soul was rendered a little speechless when she heard Shi Feng’s suggestion.

Although it was indeed possible to invite foreign aid in city battles, all reinforcing parties would have a time delay imposed on them. This, in turn, would weaken their control over their bodies by a significant margin.

So, even if they did manage to hire the assistance of other experts, these experts were unlikely to be useful. At best, they would serve as scarecrows for target practice.

“Don’t worry! The helpers I’m calling are strong,” Shi Feng very confidently said.

“Hurry up, then, Guild Leader. There are only three hours left until registration ends,” Hidden Soul said, deciding to take the risk and participate in the city battle this time. After all, with Shi Feng’s strength, they shouldn’t have difficulty securing a checkpoint.

Subsequently, Shi Feng ended his call with Hidden Soul and contacted Cross, Leroja, Desolate Fury, Amber Soul, and Cheng Xin who had gone offline not long ago.

“Are you guys free? I need your help with something!”
