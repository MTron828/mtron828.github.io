Chapter 452 - Warfire

In White Fog Canyon’s inner region, a large group of players currently faced a Level 27 Lord.

Although these players only inflicted around -100 damage with each attack, there were over 2,000 players attacking simultaneously. In the end, the Lord died, unable to withstand the barrage of attacks.

“Haha! What good luck! A Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapon dropped!” Lone Tyrant laughed after he finished organizing the loot.

During this period, aside from searching for Black Flame’s whereabouts, they had also searched for and killed Lord ranked monsters.

After such a long time, they had managed to kill over a dozen Lords. However, the drop-rate of Level 25 Fine-Gold ranked weapons and equipment was very low. They had only obtained two pieces; one was a cloth armor, while the other was the weapon that had just dropped. Everything else they obtained was mainly Secret-Silver ranked.

When the Overwhelming Smile elites saw the Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapon in Lone Tyrant’s hand, they nearly failed to contain their drool.

A Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapon was the equivalent of a Level 20 Dark-Gold Weapon. The former’s Attributes were even slightly better than the latter. One could even say that Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapons were the best weapons currently available in God’s Domain.

Aside from Zero Wing, there was no news of other Guilds in White River City possessing Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapons. Now, however, Overwhelming Smile had finally obtained one of their very own.

Although they possessed far fewer Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapons than Zero Wing, it was still proof of Overwhelming Smile’s strength.

Unfortunately, the elite members of Overwhelming Smile could only look at the Level 25 Fine-Gold Weapon. They would have to wait a long time before they could obtain one for themselves.

In order to kill the dozen or so Lords, Overwhelming Smile had sacrificed many members. The price they had paid was simply unimaginable.

At this moment, however, Lone Tyrant handed the Level 25 Fine-Gold dagger to Summer Sunshine. Everyone’s hearts ached when they saw the exchange.

They had only obtained this Level 25 Fine-Gold dagger after killing over a dozen Lords with great difficulty, yet they actually gave it to an outsider without batting an eye.

“Oh, this dagger is quite good. It’s slightly better than my Level 20 Dark-Gold dagger,” Summer Sunshine said after he gave the Level 25 Fine-Gold dagger a few swings. Nodding with satisfaction, he said, “Alright, let’s search for another Lord, then.”

“Wait a minute,” Youlan suddenly said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Is there a problem?” Summer Sunshine asked as he turned to Youlan.

“Big Brother Summer, I’ve just received information that someone has spotted Black Flame. He is currently in the outer region of White Fog Canyon. If we hurry, we can still catch him,” Youlan said.

After Black Flame had killed Overwhelming Smile’s expert, Oriental Sword, all traces of the man had vanished.

To avoid letting Black Flame escape, Youlan had prohibited Overwhelming Smile’s members from acting rashly and alerting the enemy, giving Black Flame the chance to take preventive measures. All this time, they had searched for Black Flame in secret and had posted a bounty for the man. Unfortunately, even after so much time, nobody had seen the Swordsman.

Now that they had received news of Black Flame, they could not let him go.

Black Flame was too famous. At this rate, Zero Wing would become increasingly difficult to deal with, and it would become very difficult for Overwhelming Smile to take control of White River City.

“He has finally shown himself. Good. Let’s head over there immediately. I want to see just how strong the number one expert of Star-Moon Kingdom is,” Summer Sunshine said as he sheathed the dagger he had just received, anticipation filling his eyes.

“I’ll have to trouble Big Brother Summer, then.” Youlan smiled faintly.

Although she had constantly searched for ways to deal with Black Flame, she was still not confident of killing him. Now, however, they had an expert like Summer Sunshine on their side. Moreover, Summer Sunshine had just received a new weapon. Combined with the plans she had prepared, she was 90% certain that they could take Black Flame’s life this time.

Even if Black Flame were as strong as a Lord, he would still die at her hands.

Elsewhere, after Shi Feng had obtained the Warfire Bracers and completed the Warfire Set Equipment, he had not equipped the set himself. Instead, he passed it to Fire Dance.

From the side, Virtuous Cloud and the others widened their eyes in shock when they saw Shi Feng reveal the completed Warfire Set Equipment.

“Cloud, is that the Warfire Set Equipment?” one of Virtuous Cloud’s party members secretly asked through the party chat. For a moment, he had even doubted his own eyes.

“Mhm. It should be... possible... I think...” Even when Virtuous Cloud saw the flowing purple light unique to the Warfire Set Equipment, she still found it hard to believe what she saw. Someone had actually completed the Warfire Set Equipment.

Just how difficult was it to collect each piece of the set?

Since the discovery of the Warfire Set Equipment in White Fog Canyon, less than ten pieces of the Warfire set had dropped. Various Guilds and tycoons had purchased these pieces. Moreover, based the information she had obtained, many of the pieces obtained were duplicates. Even with all ten pieces, a full set had still not dropped.

However, Shi Feng had retrieved seven Warfire set pieces from his back without a single duplicate...

Virtuous Cloud could not fathom how Shi Feng had accomplished such a feat. She had grinded for the set pieces for several days now, so she knew full well just how difficult it was to obtain even one. Just how powerful was Shi Feng’s backing for him to gather a complete set?

“Guild Leader?” Fire Dance was astonished when she looked at the Warfire Set Equipment inside her bag.

She had personally seen the Warfire Set Equipment’s Attributes before. It was definitely top-tier equipment. Only, the set required a lot of EXP to upgrade. However, if someone upgraded the Warfire Set Equipment to Fine-Gold rank, below Level 30, it was one of the best sets available in the game.

Yet, instead of using it himself, Shi Feng had actually given her the first set?

Shi Feng’s actions confused her.

Black Flame was famous throughout the Star-Moon Kingdom. If Zero Wing wished to continue flourishing, Black Flame needed to continue improving. Hence, all equipment should naturally be prioritized for Black Flame.

However...

“Leveling up is my priority right now. Even if I equip the set, the Bronze rank set effects are not particularly useful. If I sacrifice my EXP to raise the set’s quality, it will do me more harm than good. Moreover, with Zero Wing’s current situation, what the Guild lacks isn’t top-tier experts but experts with overwhelming might. Don’t reject it. I still have Warfire set pieces, so don’t worry about it,” Shi Feng laughed.

“Mhm.” Fire Dance understood Shi Feng’s intentions.

Zero Wing had no lack of top-tier experts. Facing so many powerful Guilds, what Zero Wing needed most was an expert capable of turning the tides of battle by themselves.

Following which, Fire Dance replaced her equipment with the Warfire Set Equipment.

Immediately, Fire Dance started upgrading the set’s quality. After her level fell from Level 26 to Level 25, the Warfire Set Equipment had reached Mysterious-Iron rank. The Basic Attributes of the set had increased significantly.
