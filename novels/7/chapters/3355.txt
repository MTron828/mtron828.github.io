Chapter 430 – Astonishing Results

“Where did you find all these experts, Guild Leader?” Hidden Soul couldn’t help but ask Shi Feng when she saw Amber Soul finishing off the last participant among Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups. “Every one of them is incredible.”

The Riverlight City participants they faced here weren’t no-name experts. Instead, every one of them was a titled expert in God’s Domain. Normally, ordinary hegemonic powers would only have a small number of such experts under their command.

If it was before acquiring the Void Saint’s Legacy, Hidden Soul would have difficulty beating these experts even in a one-versus-one situation, let alone in a one-versus-many situation.

Yet, of the five players Shi Feng invited, every one of them could simultaneously take on several of these titled experts by themselves. It was especially so for Cheng Xin and Amber Soul. In front of these two individuals, the members of Riverlight City’s ace battle groups were no different than ants.

Even when several of Riverlight City’s participants worked together, they couldn’t last more than a move against Cheng Xin and Amber Soul. The two were even responsible for eliminating over 70% of the five ace battle groups. If not for everyone else acting quickly, 90% of the kills might have gone to the two.

Standing next to Hidden Soul, Gentle Snow nodded in agreement with Hidden Soul’s sentiment, her eyes full of curiosity.

Ignoring monsters like Cheng Xin and Amber Soul, Leroja, Cross, and Desolate Fury were also incredibly strong. With their strength, the three could easily rank among the top five strongest players in the current Miniature Ancient World.

It should be known that the Miniature Ancient World was currently a gathering place for the younger generation experts of the Starlight Realm’s various hegemonic powers. Hence, getting into the top five was an incredibly challenging feat.

Even Saint Nine, the current 10th-ranked player in the Miniature Ancient World, was already strong enough to rival Tier 5 players. As for the current top five players, every one of them was strong enough to go up against an entire hegemonic power by themselves.

Yet, Leroja, Cross, and Desolate Fury all had the strength to enter the top five. If these three people were to enter the Miniature Ancient World and operate as a group, the things they could achieve would be beyond imagination.

“Secret,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he looked at Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow.

The Holy World was related to one of the Six Great Divine Sets. It was also a gathering place for the various Realms’ strongest experts. Naturally, the fewer people who knew about it, the better. Not to mention, it wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing for Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow to learn about the Holy World.

The Holy World was regarded as top secret even by the Galaxy Conglomerate. Every player the Galaxy Conglomerate sent into the Holy World was required to sign a strict contract beforehand. It was why no other power in the Starlight Realm knew about the Holy World, even until now.

In fact, even Shi Feng didn’t know about the Holy World’s existence during his previous life. He only knew that the Galaxy Conglomerate had suffered heavy losses during its search for the Eternity Set. The conglomerate had kept a very tight lid on the situation’s specifics.

As for why the Galaxy Conglomerate would go to such great lengths to ensure the Holy World stayed a secret, it was because the astronomical benefits the Holy World could bring would most certainly arouse the interest of the various powers.

If Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow accidentally leaked information on the Holy World, they would be in grave danger in both God’s Domain and the real world. Even their current status as Star Lake City’s official participants would not keep them safe, and they could only spend the rest of their lives hiding in the God’s Domain Association.

When Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow saw that Shi Feng did not intend to share his secret with them, they did not choose to pursue the topic. They knew that Shi Feng must have his reasons for not telling them, and they were unlikely to get an answer even if they continued asking him about it.

…

Meanwhile, after Zero Wing’s battle group took care of Riverlight City’s five ace battle groups, Shi Feng had Pace Angel, a rookie from the Blue Flash World, stay behind at the capture point while he led everyone else to invade Riverlight City’s territory.

The five remaining battle groups on Riverlight City’s side were only ordinary battle groups. As they were utterly powerless against Zero Wing’s battle group, all of them chose to abandon the capture points they occupied as soon as they saw Zero Wing’s battle group appearing before them, opting to compete for other capture points instead.

For a time, a strange scene appeared in the city battle’s Tier 4 match.

Whichever capture point Zero Wing’s battle group visited would see Riverlight City’s participants abandoning it. This led to Zero Wing occupying eight out of the ten capture points in Riverlight City’s territory with zero resistance. If not for Riverlight City’s participants ambushing other capture points and forcing Zero Wing to have one person going around providing support, Zero Wing could have occupied nine of the capture points on Riverlight City’s side.

In contrast to Zero Wing’s battle group’s experience, Star Lake City’s nine other battle groups experienced a huge headache throughout the match. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Originally, they thought they would have an easy time occupying Riverlight City’s capture points since Riverlight City only had five ordinary battle groups remaining. However, because of Zero Wing’s battle group, Riverlight City’s five remaining battle groups had opted to focus all their efforts on protecting their two remaining capture points. Hence, although Star Lake City’s nine other battle groups still had a numerical advantage, it wasn’t a particularly overwhelming one.

In addition, the defenders of a capture point would receive bonus Basic Attributes. So, even though Star Lake City’s battle groups had the advantage in terms of both quality and quantity of participants, it still took them over an hour before they managed to occupy one of Riverlight City’s two remaining capture points.

As for the last capture point, even after the match’s two-hour duration was over, Star Lake City’s nine other battle groups never managed to secure it.

Ultimately, the city battle’s Tier 4 match ended with Zero Wing’s battle group occupying nine capture points while Star Lake City’s nine other battle groups occupied ten capture points. With a score of 19-to-1 in Star Lake City’s advantage, Star Lake City ended up gaining a 90-point lead over Riverlight City in the very first match. This was a landslide victory that had never been seen throughout Star Lake City’s history.

Seeing the difference in points, everyone in Star Lake City cheered in celebration. With such a huge lead, even if they ended up losing the next two matches, so long as they didn’t lose too catastrophically, the city battle would still end with Star Lake City winning.

…

Star Lake City’s participant bench:

“I thought we were going to lose because of our insistence on sheltering Zero Wing, but I didn’t think Zero Wing would bring me such a big surprise,” an old man with a graying beard said, smiling when he saw the outcome of the first match. Then, he looked toward the woman in tight-fitting crimson sportswear standing next to him and said, “The rest is up to you now, Commander Frost.”

“Don’t worry, City Lord. Star Lake City will definitely win this time,” Red Frost said, a rare smile appearing on her face.

There wasn’t much of a gap in strength between Star Lake City and Riverlight City, to begin with. So, having a 90-point lead after the first match would relieve a lot of pressure on the Star Lake Legion in the two subsequent matches.

Shortly after the Tier 4 match ended, the Tier 5 match began.

The Tier 5 match’s intensity was vastly greater than the Tier 4 match’s intensity. Because Riverlight City had the Paimon Conglomerate’s assistance, even defending their own capture points became a challenging feat for the battle groups led by Chen Qilin.

Despite Chen Qilin’s best efforts, the Tier 5 match ended with Star Lake City occupying only seven capture points while Riverlight City occupied thirteen. Star Lake City’s 90-point lead shrunk to just a 42-point lead because of this defeat, and Star Lake City’s spectators couldn’t help but feel frustrated over this outcome. They didn’t think the Star Lake Legion’s Tier 5 battle groups would be so weak.

Fortunately, the Tier 6 battle groups led by Red Frost herself performed well afterward, winning the Tier 6 match with twelve capture points occupied.

In the end, the city battle concluded with Star Lake City having an 82-point lead. Along with this victory, not only did Star Lake City put an end to its losing streak, but it also managed to regain its fifth set of power furnace energy.
