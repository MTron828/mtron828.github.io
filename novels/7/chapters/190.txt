Chapter 191 - Star-Moon’s Big Ten

Stabbing Heart immediately froze in shock when he heard that Shi Feng had fifty stacks of Hard Stones.

The entire Assassin’s Alliance could not even manage to gather up five full stacks. Yet, Shi Feng said he had fifty.

If fifty stacks of Hard Stones were used to craft Whetstones, even if the forgers crafting them had slightly lower success rates, it could allow all the elite players in the Assassin’s Alliance to reach Level 10, entering White River City.

“Brother Ye Feng, you’re not tricking me, right? Do you really have fifty stacks?” Stabbing Heart asked doubtfully. It was not that he did not trust Shi Feng, but this number was simply too huge. Even a first-rate Guild in a town could not offer up that many. It would be impressive if they could even gather six to seven stacks.

“Naturally. Since when have I joked around before?” Shi Feng shook his head, laughing.

The reason Shi Feng offered Stabbing Heart this many Hard Stones was not purely to earn Coins. A large part of the reason was to assist the Assassin’s Alliance in entering White River City and starting their development at an earlier date. After all, the Assassin’s Alliance’s main forces were all stationed around the few cities near White River City. As long as the Assassin’s Alliance grew stronger, with his relationship with Stabbing Heart, Stabbing Heart could help him suppress and stamp out those unrated Guilds. That way, these Guilds would be too busy dealing with the Assassin’s Alliance to pay any attention to him.

Originally, Shi Feng had wanted to sell some Hard Stones to Gentle Snow as well. However, Gentle Snow’s team was simply developing too quickly. They had managed to reach Level 10 in only half a day’s time, and at this time, all the elite members of Ouroboros had already arrived at White River City. Naturally, they would not need his help anymore.

The most important point was that Gentle Snow possessed the super-luxury version of the White River City Guidebook that Shi Feng had sold to her. With it, she could easily widen the gap between herself and the other Guilds, standing out from the crowd.

Now that Shi Feng had protective umbrellas like Gentle Snow and Stabbing Heart, would those unrated Guilds possibly dare do anything to him? He could progress with his own development with a peace of mind.

“Brother Ye Feng, I don’t know how to thank you for this...! If you have anything you need help with in the future, just mention it! If it is something that I can help with, I will give it my all!” Stabbing Heart was extremely touched right now. In his heart, he had already taken Shi Feng as his good brother.

However, 4 Gold, 50 Silver was not easy to obtain. He needed some time to gather the liquid funds from the other towns and collect some from the money-farming team.

Although it was a large expenditure, with fifty stacks of Hard Stones, Stabbing Heart could allow the team in Red Leaf Town to be the first team, out of all the other team in the Assassin’s Alliance, to enter White River City. At that time, he would receive a promotion in the Guild once more. He might even become an elder of the Assassin’s Alliance. Meanwhile, such an achievement was only possible due to Shi Feng’s help. Although Stabbing Heart felt slightly ashamed of himself for to not being of great help to Shi Feng, he had already decided that, once he entered White River City, he would fully support Shi Feng. Whoever dared to go against Shi Feng would go against him as well!

“When will you can send someone over to Red Leaf Town to conduct the trade?” Shi Feng asked.

“As long as you are free, any time is good!” Stabbing Heart answered.

“Oh, right. I have something I need to ask you. Do you know the current whereabouts of the team from Martial Union led by Unstable Devastation?” Shi Feng felt that, since he was going to make a trip back to Red Leaf Town, he might as well look for Unstable Devastation to extract his revenge.

“This, I know. They’re currently at the White Sand Ruins. Are you planning on taking revenge on them? I’ll call some men over to go with you. They have quite a few of players on their side, so it would be dangerous for you hunt them by yourself,” Stabbing Heart was slightly surprised. He did not think that Shi Feng would take revenge so quickly. Moreover, he was even going to deal with the elite team led by Unstable Devastation directly. After all, that elite team formed after Unstable Devastation merged the elite teams from five different towns. The number of elites in that team even far exceeded that of Stabbing Heart’s own elite team, so it would not be easy to deal with them.

“Thanks, but I wish to deal with my own matters by myself. Let’s meet up in front of Red Leaf Town’s Bank in twenty minutes,” Shi Feng thanked him.

“Alright. I’ll send some men to investigate Martial Union’s exact location. At that time, I’ll pass on their exact whereabouts to you along with the 4 Gold, 50 Silver.” Stabbing Heart naturally knew of the arrogance of an expert, so he did not pursue the matter. Otherwise, if he were to find trouble with Martial Union without Shi Feng’s agreement, he might even incur Shi Feng’s ire.

Twenty minutes later...

Shi Feng arrived in front of the Bank in Red Leaf Town.

“Hello, Big Brother Ye Feng. I am Cocoa, from the Assassin’s Alliance, Big Brother Stabbing Heart sent me here. Here is the grinding location of Martial Union’s elite team.”

A pure and pleasant looking female Elementalist walked over, her eyes sparkling as she looked at Shi Feng. After all, the Shi Feng before her was the god-ranked expert of Red Leaf Town that everybody knew about. He was a person that even team leader Stabbing Heart of Red Leaf Town treated with respect. Most importantly, Shi Feng was good friends with the Snow Goddess that she admired greatly. There was absolutely no chance for a normal lifestyle player like herself to come into contact with such a legendary figure. She was only here today to conduct a trade because the other forgers in the Guild were too busy, while she was a newly recruited forger in the Guild. Only, she did not think that she could meet such a great character.

Shi Feng glanced at this girl, and his expression immediately froze.

Cream Cocoa, wasn’t she that famous Master Forger of Star-Moon Kingdom?

As one of the Ten Great Master Forgers in Star-Moon Kingdom, Cream Cocoa was a forging genius who was the closest to becoming a Grandmaster Forger. Her talent was almost comparable to that of Seliora of White River City. She was both a beauty and a forging genius; plenty of first-rate Guilds had willingly offered her an annual salary of hundreds of millions to recruit her. Unfortunately, she rejected them all, one after another, as she wanted to stay in the third-rate Guild, Prayer Temple. Rumor had it that she had done so to repay a debt of gratitude, as Cream Cocoa was relatively clumsy during her early days, causing her success rate to be abysmally low. Due to her clumsiness, plenty of Guilds had refused to accept her. In the end, Prayer Temple was the only Guild that had accepted and nurtured her, so she did not wish to leave them.

Unfortunately, even with such a genius Master Forger in their Guild, Ouroboros still destroyed Prayer Temple in the end. As a result, Cream Cocoa chose to join World Dominators, a first-rate Guild in direct opposition of Ouroboros, to take revenge on the first-rate Guild.

However, why was Cream Cocoa in the Assassin’s Alliance right now?

Shi Feng was slightly confused, as Prayer Temple’s main force was not located in White River City, but in the capital city, Star-Moon City. It was also the reason why Ouroboros destroyed them.

Could it be that, after being ignored by the Assassin’s Alliance, she chose to head to Star-Moon City to develop herself after she reached a higher Level, which then led her to Prayer Temple? Shi Feng could only make guesses. If the Assassin’s Alliance found out that they had chased away a Master Forger during their early days in God’s Domain, they might even kill themselves in regret.

“Big Brother Ye Feng?” When Cream Cocoa discovered that Shi Feng stared at her sternly, she couldn’t help but panic.

Only now did Shi Feng regain his senses. His actions could not be considered overreacting, as a top-tier Master Forger was simply too important to a Guild. However, he couldn’t just try to recruit Cream Cocoa to his group. After all, Cream Cocoa was still a member of the Assassin’s Alliance right now. His only option at the moment was to wait for Cream Cocoa to leave the Assassin’s Alliance before trying to recruit her.

“Oh, it’s nothing. Here are the fifty stacks of Hard Stones,” Shi Feng immediately traded the fifty stacks of Hard Stones to Cream Cocoa.

When Cream Cocoa saw the fifty stacks of Hard Stones in her trade window, her eyes widened in shock. She did not even dare believe her own eyes. Right now, it was hard to even purchase one or two Hard Stones. Yet, Shi Feng had easily managed to bring out fifty stacks. It was no wonder why team leader Stabbing Heart was so respectful to Ye Feng! As expected, he was a figure that average players like her could only look up to!

Soon after the trade completed, Shi Feng departed from Red Leaf Town, heading towards the White Sand Ruins. However, he did not add Cream Cocoa as a friend, as such an action might cause a change to the track of history, causing Cream Cocoa to instead stay with the Assassin’s Alliance. If that happened, he would definitely cry with regret. Hence, he would let history repeat itself without his interference.

Now that he knew Martial Union’s precise location, he would immediately teach Unstable Devastation the consequences of becoming his enemy.
