Chapter 3265 - Chapter 339 - Replica Fragmented Divine Artifact

Chapter 339 – Replica Fragmented Divine Artifact

Upon seeing Shi Feng’s party of three move for the items that were slowly falling out of the sky, the 50-plus players on the cliff promptly took action, using either Tier 5 Magic Scrolls or Consumables that could exhibit power at the Tier 5 standard.

In the blink of an eye, seven Tier 5 Spells and five Tier 5 tools were used. Among the consumables used, there was even the Tier 5 Annihilation Thunderbolt, the Tier 5 Sanctioning Flames, and the Tier 5 Aurora Spear.

When Shi Feng saw all these Tier 5 attacks, even he couldn’t help but be a little astonished.

Tier 5 Magic Scrolls were extremely precious even in the Greater God’s Domain. Even the cheapest Tier 5 Magic Scroll was close to rivaling Fragmented Legendary items in value. As for the Tier 5 Consumables, they were priced exactly the same as Fragmented Legendary items, and even the various hegemonic powers had very few of these items.

!!

Yet, this time, seven Tier 5 Magic Scrolls and five Tier 5 consumables were used. Not even the various hegemonic powers would dare to be so wasteful.

“Put up your defenses!”

A quick look at shorturl.at/mCEOX will leave you more fulfilled.

When the twelve Tier 5 attacks were within 20 yards of Shi Feng’s party, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao simultaneously finished chanting their respective incantations.

Tier 4 Defensive Spell, Omniguard!

Tier 4 Defensive Spell, Ocean’s Wall!

As soon as the two cast their Defensive Spells, another 200 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal disappeared from each of their bags. At the same time, two barriers formed around Shi Feng’s party. One was made of rocks, while the other was made of seawater.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Subsequently, the Tier 5 Spells and Tier 5 Consumables collided with the two barriers, the impact resulting in an explosion that instantly turned the sky into a dark void and sent all players within a 100-yard radius flying. The sound of the explosion also echoed throughout the entire Ancient River Secret Land’s central zone.

“Amazing!”

“I didn’t think a bunch of Tier 5 Magic Scrolls being used together could achieve such an effect. The destructive power of this attack is already on par with the bombardment of a party of Tier 5 Grand Wizards.”

“What a pity. I thought Black Flame could get into the top 10 and compete against those paragons. Now, it seems that won’t be possible.”

Whether it was the various powers’ geniuses responsible for using the Tier 5 Magic Scrolls and Consumables or the players spectating the battle’s broadcast, everyone couldn’t help but gasp at the sight before them.

There was no doubt that this Rookie Competition was the most exciting instance out of all Rookie Competitions held in the Ancient River Kingdom. Even the Myriad Forest Empire’s Battle of Geniuses paled compared to the gathering of paragons in this Rookie Competition.

Sure enough, none of the parties here should be underestimated…

Glorious Mantra’s, Martial Quadbeast’s, and Silent Saintess’s hearts pounded as they looked at the huge cloud of dust before them. Even if the three of them worked together, they would probably be obliterated if they had to go up against so many Tier 5 attacks simultaneously. After all, even the average Tier 5 player would have difficulty reacting to so many Tier 5 attacks, let alone Tier 4 players.

However, just when everyone was getting ready to charge forward and compete for the Mutated Heroic Spirit’s loot, the dust cloud settled, and the scene that entered everyone’s eyes stunned them.

“They didn’t die?!”

At this time, the two barriers made of rocks and seawater could be seen crumbling apart in the air. However, the three figures hovering behind the destroyed barriers remained perfectly intact.

When Lightning Chaser and Desolate Fury saw this, their eyes nearly fell out of their sockets. For a moment, they even suspected they weren’t looking at Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao but two people disguised as Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao instead. They simply couldn’t believe that the two girls had managed to defend against twelve Tier 5 attacks.

How close! Sweat rolled down Wu Xiaoxiao’s forehead as she looked at the disintegrating barriers in front of her. Had we failed to perfectly merge Omniguard and Ocean’s Wall this time, we would have definitely been killed. It’s fortunate that we would normally practice combining Defensive Spells…

Although the Four Gods Secret Art allowed them to exhibit Tier 5 effects with their Tier 4 Spells, there was a limit to what a Tier 5 Defensive Spell could do against Tier 5 attacks. Not to mention, every one of the five Tier 5 Consumables was on par with Tier 5 Destruction Spells in terms of power. Just one of these Tier 5 Consumables was enough to overwhelm the average Tier 5 Defensive Spell.

Fortunately, after arriving in the Greater God’s Domain, Wu Xiaoxiao would often fight alongside Midsummer and occasionally combine their Spells to achieve stronger effects. This allowed them to combine their two Tier 4 Defensive Spells perfectly and enhance their Spells’ power significantly, which, in turn, allowed them to just barely defend against the bombardment of Tier 5 attacks. Had their coordination been weaker or had their opponents launched more Tier 5 attacks, their defenses would have most certainly failed to protect them.

“This can’t continue. I highly doubt our Combination Spell will be enough to stop their next attack,” Midsummer said, her complexion turning slightly pale when she saw that the various parties down below were getting ready to launch another round of attacks.

At this time, the many experts present had clearly realized that their attack just now was slightly off the mark. Hence, more than ten parties have taken out Tier 5 Magic Scrolls now. Glorious Mantra had even brought out a Silver Combat Puppet.

A Silver Combat Puppet. So long as players entered a Silver Combat Puppet, they would immediately gain Tier 5 combat power. A Silver Combat Puppet was superior to even Legendary monsters when it came to Strength and Defense. Not even a real Tier 5 player would dare to trade blows with a Silver Combat Puppet.

When Martial Quadbeast and Silent Saintess saw Glorious Mantra’s Silver Combat Puppet, they were greatly surprised. Neither of them had expected Glorious Mantra to have such a frightening trump card hidden.

A Silver Combat Puppet, is it? When Shi Feng saw Glorious Mantra’s trump card, he quietly took out one of the pieces of Divine Eternal Gold Midsummer had given to him. Then, he said to Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, “I’ll stop them while you two collect the loot.”

“This…”

Midsummer was at a loss for words when she heard Shi Feng’s command. It should be known that they were going up against a Silver Combat Puppet and over ten Tier 5 Magic Scrolls. No matter how she looked at it, this wasn’t an attack any Tier 4 player could defend against alone.

However, since this was Shi Feng’s command, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao promptly did as they were told.

“Don’t even think about getting the loot so easily!”

Before Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao could reach for the loot around them, Glorious Mantra charged at them in his Silver Combat Puppet. The Cursemancer was not at all worried about the various parties that were about to activate their Tier 5 Magic Scrolls.

Devour!

After Shi Feng took a look at the fast-approaching Silver Combat Puppet, he unsheathed the Winter of Eternal Night. Immediately afterward, the Divine Eternal Gold in his hand melted and transformed into a shining golden longsword.

Formless Sword.

It was one of the two Additional Profound Inheritances attached to the Winter of Eternal Night. It allowed him to convert any object in the world into a sword. Combined with what he had learned during his previous life from studying forging design for the Eternal Ashes, a Fragmented Divine Artifact, he had created a replica of the Eternal Ashes during his previous life.
