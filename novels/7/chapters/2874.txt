Chapter 2875 – Ancient Rock City in Peril

“Is Zero Wing planning to attack the city?”

“This is crazy! Zero Wing must’ve lost its mind! How dare they attack Ancient Rock City?!”

Inevitably, Ancient Rock City’s inhabitants doubted Shi Feng’s declaration, with many of them considering it a joke.

Saint’s Hand had continuously strengthened Ancient Rock City. Currently, the city’s defenses were superior to those of other Guild Cities, and the combatants stationed within the city were more than enough to instill fear in the various superpowers. Not to mention, the dark forces of over a dozen countries gathered in the city. Apart from Dark Guilds, there were also plenty of NPC forces among these dark forces. These forces had paid a considerable price to settle in Ancient Rock City and even treated the city as their base of operations.

Anyone who dared to attack Ancient Rock City would make an enemy of these dark forces.

Be it Dark Guilds or dark NPC forces, every one of them had at least two or three Tier 4 combatants under their command. Moreover, Miracle had recently garrisoned the city, so there should be close to 200 Tier 4 combatants defending Ancient Rock City right now. One could conquer an entire kingdom with that many Tier 4 combatants.

Most importantly, Ancient Rock City was currently an Advanced Guild City, only one step away from becoming a Main Guild City.

Ancient Rock City’s resident players weren’t the only ones shocked by this situation. Beast Emperor, who was conducting research in the City Lord’s Mansion, inadvertently crushed the research instrument he held when he received news of Zero Wing’s sudden arrival.

“Black Flame, how bold of you! It seems you’ve gotten arrogant while I was lying low!” Beast Emperor growled with a cold glint in his eyes. “Lord Beast Emperor, Black Flame is rumored to have reached Tier 5 already. Should we notify the Sacred Envoy?” the Level 152, Tier 4 Berserker, who had made the report, asked.

News of Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 5 had long since reached the ears of God’s Domain’s various powers. Meanwhile, a Tier 5 player was an existence even Saint’s Hand had to be wary

of.

Putting away the tools on his table, Beast Emperor glanced at Saint’s Hand’s Guild Leader, Furious Fist, and smiled lightly. “No need. Call for some people and come along with me. I want to see what exactly gives Black Flame the confidence to act arrogantly in my Ancient Rock City!”

After saying so, Beast Emperor turned around and left. A robust man with black skin covered in flashing runes, who stood guard before the research room, silently trailed him.

“Yes, sir!”

Furious Fist hurriedly followed after the robust man.

Less than three minutes after Shi Feng’s declaration, many players and adventurer teams, afraid of trouble, had already withdrawn from Ancient Rock City. Only Dark Players and a few courageous normal players chose to remain.

At the same time, players from the various dark adventurer teams and Dark Guilds also gathered at Ancient Rock City’s entrance, one after another, and watched the fleeing players.

“These cowards! Zero Wing sent only a few dozen players, yet these people are already running away!”

“Zero Wing is famous, after all. It’s normal for them to run away. Not to mention, Black Flame is also here. It’d be strange for them not to escape.”

“These people are simply idiots! Zero Wing won its past battles only because of the powerful defenses of its cities!”

“That’s right! So what if Zero Wing managed to produce a Tier 5 player? We’ll teach these guys what it means to offend us dark forces!”

The Dark Players revealed expressions of rage and excitement as they looked up at the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. Zero Wing’s reputation was through the roof right now. Moreover, Shi Feng had gotten promoted to Tier 5. Hence, players were starting to consider Zero Wing God’s Domain’s number one Guild.

If a battle were to occur in the outside world, Dark Players like themselves would indeed be afraid of Shi Feng. However, it was a different story if the battle took place inside Ancient Rock City. With the city’s magic array, they could still take him on with the many Tier 4 players they had. Not to mention, a large number of Faux Saint monsters protected Ancient Rock City, including two Superior Mythic ranked Faux Saint Slayers.

Even if they couldn’t kill Shi Feng, they could, at least, make the other members of Zero Wing suffer!

As the five-minute limit approached, the number of players retreating from Ancient Rock City also increased. At this time, the players that had withdrawn from Ancient Rock City suddenly felt a chill envelop their bodies. Even Tier 3 experts found themselves partially kneeling on the ground.

The next moment, a group of 40 players flew out from the City Lord’s Mansion. Apart from Furious Fist and Saint’s Hand’s Tier 4 executives, 17 players on the team were people that none of Ancient Rock City’s inhabitants had ever seen before.

These 17 players looked nothing like humans. Not only were their bodies pitch-black, but there were also flashing runes engraved all over their bodies. These players’ auras were also stronger than even that of Superior Mythic monsters. When combined, their auras transformed into a tsunami that swept through the entire city and its surroundings.

“Amazing! Is this Saint’s Hand’s rumored Bloodstained Knight Legion?”

“That’s not all! Even Beast Emperor left the City Lord’s Mansion! It seems we’ll have a good show this time!”

“Indeed. I heard that Beast Emperor has constantly been plotting revenge on Zero Wing after getting slaughtered at the Secret Covenant Tower. Now that Zero Wing has come knocking on his door, there’s no way Beast Emperor will spare Zero Wing!” The various major powers’ experts standing atop the city walls were surprised when they saw Beast Emperor and the Bloodstained Knights making an appearance. At the same time, they were shocked by the power Saint’s Hand displayed.

The superpowers on the eastern continent had always been fearful of Saint’s Hand, and this situation greatly confused the various major powers. However, after seeing Saint’s Hand’s top combatants, they realized that the superpowers’ fear of Saint’s Hand wasn’t without basis.

Setting aside the fact that Saint’s Hand had over 20 Tier 4 experts at the Void Realm or above, just the 17 rumored Bloodstained Knights were more than enough to instill fear into any player force.

After all, even a Tier 4 player would tremble in fear if they had to go up against a Bloodstained Knight, let alone 17 Bloodstained Knights simultaneously. That would be a nightmare.

Shortly afterward, Beast Emperor’s group arrived above the city gate. Seeing this, the various powers’ leadership promptly stepped forward to greet Beast Emperor. Thousand Miles, one of Miracle’s Vice Guild Leaders, was even among them.

Thousand Miles’s actions astonished the various major powers present. They never thought that even a superpower like Miracle would defer to Beast Emperor.

After Beast Emperor responded to a few greetings, he flew into the air with his subordinates and glared at Shi Feng on the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. He then said coldly, “Black Flame! You and I could’ve stayed out of each other’s way in the Orc Empire, yet you chose to come to attack me! So long as you apologize right now, I can ignore this transgression for the time being! Otherwise, none of you will be returning alive today!”

After Beast Emperor finished speaking, a frightening amount of Evil Energy erupted from the 17 Bloodstained Knights behind him, distorting the surrounding space and muddying it. The terrifying power within the Evil Energy made even those who had fled more than a thousand yards from the city tremble.

Moreover, the two Faux Saint Slayers had flown to flank the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, while the 30-plus Evil Dark Dragons had surrounded it, thoroughly sealing off all of Zero Wing’s escape routes.

The fleeing players gasped at this scene. With such a force under Saint’s Hand’s command, the Guild could take on even an empire!

“Dammit! I thought Saint’s Hand was going to suffer this time, but it seems I miscalculated!” “Zero Wing has always relied on Black Flame to survive. Now, it seems Zero Wing has finally met its match. If this situation isn’t handled properly, apart from Black Flame, the other Zero Wing members present probably won’t leave alive.”

At this time, even a fool could tell how powerful Saint’s Hand’s forces were. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that even an NPC force with a Tier 5 combatant under its command wouldn’t dare to offend Saint’s Hand casually, let alone Zero Wing. “Apologize?” Shi Feng laughed. “Beast Emperor, it seems you’re growing senile. Have you forgotten how you died at my hands last time?”

“You...bastard!”

Shi Feng’s words enraged Beast Emperor.

However, before Beast Emperor could say anything more, Mana exploded from Shi Feng’s body. Immediately, an indescribably heavy pressure descended on the entire Ancient Rock City. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

World Creation!

The next moment, Beast Emperor and the others plummeted to the ground one after another. Even the Tier 4 experts standing on the city walls found themselves on one knee under the strong pressure.
