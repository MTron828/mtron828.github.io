Chapter 890 – Disappearance of the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key

Flame Dragon God’s Treasury, Central Plaza:

As more players entered the secret land, the number of players teleporting to the Flame Dragon God’s Treasury also increased. After weaving their way through the crowd outside the central plaza, Shi Feng and Dragon’s Crown’s members arrived before the magic barriers enveloping the plaza.

“The various pseudo-apex powers have sealed off this place! Outsiders are not allowed to enter!” a Level 236 elven Berserker, the leader of a 20-man team stationed inside the magic barriers, stated to Shi Feng and his team.

“We are allies of Holy Dragon Spear. Here is my token,” Shi Feng said, taking out the elder’s token he received from Apocalypse.

“Holy Dragon Spear?” The elven Berserker glanced at the token in Shi Feng’s hand. After verifying its validity, he raised his hand and opened a gap in the magic barriers. Then, he stated, “Friends of Holy Dragon Spear, as space in the plaza is limited, you can only stay inside for an hour. You must leave once you have reached the time limit.”

“Okay.” Shi Feng nodded.

After letting Shi Feng’s team through the barriers, the elven Berserker suddenly smiled and said, “Brother, are you willing to sell your Undying Souls. I can buy them from you at a high price. I am buying each Undying Soul for 100 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. If you prefer real-world resources, I can also use Mental Strength Potions and Stardew to trade with you. I’m selling Mental Strength Potions for only ten Undying Souls per bottle and Stardew for only 100,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. These items are best for mental strength recovery and development!”

“You can supply Mental Strength Potions and Stardew directly?” Shi Feng was surprised by the elven Berserker’s offer.

Since the major system update, whenever players sustained injuries in God’s Domain, their mental strength in the real world would also be negatively impacted. Additionally, their mental strength would also determine the quality of weapons and equipment they could equip in God’s Domain. This led to the skyrocketing prices of potions that aided in the recovery and development of mental strength. Now, even Mental Strength Potions, which used to be the most common potion, were in short supply.

“Naturally. How about it? Would you like to stock up on some? I strongly recommend buying some Stardew. There’s hardly any supply on the open market,” the elven Berserker said, smiling. “If you can improve your mental strength, you’ll be able to use much better weapons and equipment. Otherwise, even if you get your hands on better weapons and equipment, you can only stare at them without sufficient mental strength.”

“It is a tempting offer, but I’m afraid it is out of my budget, sorry,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. Then, he made his way into the plaza with Kowloon Demon and the others.

“What a bunch of cautious newcomers.” The elven Berserker grimaced in displeasure as he watched Shi Feng’s team walk away.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng arrived at the central plaza, they were greeted by the sight of a rowdy marketplace. At a glance, there were at least 10,000 players in the plaza. Of these players, a small minority were members of the various pseudo-apex powers, while the rest were independent players and members of other powers. Currently, these players were either redeeming items from the treasury or purchasing Undying Souls from other players. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

After taking a moment to listen to the hawking players, Shi Feng found that many powers were buying Undying Souls at prices far more favorable than that of the elven Berserker. While it cost ten Undying Souls to buy one Mental Strength Potion from the elven Berserker, Mental Strength Potions could be had for just five Undying Souls in the central plaza. Some powers even offered them for four Undying Souls per bottle.

“That punk back there sure is evil,” Kowloon Demon commented as he glanced at the hawking players. “Luckily, you didn’t accept his offer, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

“I’d say that he was pretty kind already,” Shi Feng said. Casually pointing at some cloaked players standing in a corner, he continued, “Those people secretly monitoring the plaza are the real killers. They’re keeping track of everyone who redeems items. Once they see something valuable disappear from the list, they will immediately know who redeemed it. If they see that it’s not a player affiliated with them, they will most likely take action outside the plaza.”

On the surface, it might seem that the various pseudo-apex powers were harmoniously sharing the treasury with each other. In reality, there was constant infighting.

“No wonder you wanted us to come here with you. Your world really isn’t peaceful, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Kowloon Demon said as he scanned the plaza. There were at least a thousand of these cloaked players loitering around the plaza. Moreover, they clearly belonged to several dozen different powers. The scale of the conflict here was unlike anything he had seen in his home world.

Most regions in the remnant primordial world were governed by one power. Even in contested regions, there would only be two or three powers competing for the ruling position; there had never been a situation where dozens of powers clashed.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, how will you conduct your exchange? Do you need our help?” Purgatory Jade asked.

After careful observation, she knew that every corner of the magic barriers was scrutinized. The instant a player clicked to redeem an item from the treasury, the cloaked players would immediately find out what they had redeemed by referencing the most recent item to have disappeared from the exchange list. The only way to trick these cloaked players was to have dozens of players pretend to redeem items at the same time. That way, the cloaked players would have difficulty determining who exactly had redeemed an item.

“That won’t be necessary,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

The items he would be redeeming ranked among the treasury’s top five. Even if he had Purgatory Jade and the others pretend to redeem items, nothing would change. The observers already knew they were part of the same team when they entered the magic barriers. The various pseudo-apex powers would simply target the entire team.

Subsequently, Shi Feng pulled up the treasury’s exchange list. When he saw that all five of the top five items were still available, he immediately spent ten million Undying Souls to redeem the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key.

Before Shi Feng could redeem his second item, loud exclamations suddenly arose in the plaza.

“It’s gone! The Access Key is gone!”

“Heavens! Someone redeemed the Access Key!”

“Quick! Check the Recording Crystals! See who redeemed the Access Key!”

Upon hearing these exclamations, everyone in the plaza subconsciously looked around, their eyes colored by greed and madness.
