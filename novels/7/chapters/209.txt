Chapter 210 - Eye-opener

Shi Feng’s words struck Lone Tyrant and the others.

Immediately, the atmosphere became incomparably tense. Neither side spoke a single word, and both sides stood on the cusp of lashing out right now.

However, nobody intended to make the first move.

After all, everyone present understood that, if they took action right now, it would lead to an all-out war between the two Guilds. Regardless of who won and who lost in this confrontation, both sides would take heavy losses. Hence, be it Cruel Sword or Lone Tyrant, neither wished for such a situation to occur.

As both sides could no longer endure the stifling atmosphere...

“Getting the Hard Mode’s First Clear ahead of us? With trash like you?” Lone Tyrant’s complexion abruptly turned cold. With a ridiculing smile, he spoke with contempt, “Good, very good! Let everyone see the truth, then! I really want to see if your strength is as good as that mouth of yours!”

After he finished speaking, Lone Tyrant led his team into the Beastman Munition Factory. Moreover, they chose to immediately start with the Dungeon’s Hard Mode without warm-up or preparation. They clearly wished to prove to Shi Feng and the Assassin’s Alliance just how wide the difference between them was.

“Why are they trying to act so bold? They will suffer defeat when the time comes.” Stabbing Heart curled his lips, revealing a cold smile.

Without personally experiencing the 20-man Hard Mode Beastman Munition Factory, one could not truly gauge the difficulty of the Dungeon. Otherwise, they would not have sought Shi Feng’s help.

They had only chosen this method as a last resort. After all, the Assassin’s Alliance was in a precarious position right now, and they were in dire need of a breakthrough. Hence, they had to obtain the First Clear of a Hard Mode Dungeon.

“That’s right! Dark Star is nothing! They’ll cry with regret once they enter the Dungeon!”

“Guild Leader, let’s hurry and enter! We must teach those bastards from Dark Star the strength of the Assassin’s Alliance!”

“That’s right! Guild Leader, we must get the First Clear this time!”

The players from the Assassin’s Alliance wiped away their depression from before. They all cracked their knuckles as their thirst for battle grew.

Shi Feng remained silent as he listened to everyone’s enthusiasm with a faint smile on his face.

However, due to Shi Feng’s actions, the Guild Leader of the Assassin’s Alliance, Cruel Blade, viewed Shi Feng in a new light.

Cruel Blade considered that Shi Feng might not just be all talk.

Due to Shi Feng’s provocation, the team’s originally downcast mood received underwent a complete change. Right now, everyone was indignant over the injustice they had received rather than depressed, and they immediately wanted to charge into the Dungeon and slaughter the Boss within. They wanted to obtain the First Clear of the Hard Mode Dungeon, letting the players from Dark Star witness their might.

However, Shi Feng did not give much thought to Cruel Sword’s renewed opinion of him.

After all, he had been a Guild Leader in his previous life as well. If one wanted to increase the unity of a team, they only needed one thing.

They needed an enemy.

In fact, Lone Tyrant was already an enemy of the Assassin’s Alliance. Shi Feng merely poured some oil on the already-burning fire, further raising their fighting spirits.

Naturally, high fighting spirits were only a mental boost, and it would not help the Assassin’s Alliance to clear the Dungeon.

If the Assassin’s Alliance wanted to clear the Hard Mode Team Dungeon, they still needed some other key elements.

However, Shi Feng did not reveal this fact. He merely quietly joined the Assassin’s Alliance’s team, entering the Beast Munition Factory with Cruel Sword and the others.

The Beast Munition Factory was a dilapidated weapon manufacturing factory. Hence, the terrain inside the Dungeon was not particularly complicated. Players only needed to walk down a single path to reach the Boss.

There were a total of three Bosses throughout the Dungeon. Although the number was low, each Boss was extremely powerful. In 20-man Hard Mode Team Dungeons, the Bosses were all High Chieftain rank. Every one of them had powerful skills, and it was a normal occurrence for these Bosses to instant-kill an MT. If a team were not familiar with these Bosses’ skills, failing to grasp the timing of their attacks fully, it would not be strange for a team to team-wipe over ten times. In comparison to these Bosses, however, players would have a much easier time clearing the Elite monsters within the Dungeon.

“I think that everyone should know what to do by now. However, since this is Brother Ye Feng’s first time entering this Dungeon, I’ll give you a short explanation on what you should expect later on. Your task is to go all-out, dealing damage, while simultaneously evading the skills of the Elite monsters. On another note, the monsters here have very high Attack Power, and they deal a ton of damage, even to the MTs. Moreover, these monsters are immune to crowd control skills. Hence, healers will be under a lot of pressure. They will have no time to heal anyone other than the MT, so you need to be careful not to pull aggro,” Cruel Sword explained patiently.

“Alright, that’s it for my explanation. Let’s first use the four Elite monsters guarding at the entrance as practice for our coordination.”

Finished speaking, Cruel Sword directed two of the team’s MT to charge at the four axe-wielding Level 10 Elite Beastman Warriors. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

[Beastman Warrior] (Elite Rank)

Level 10

HP 50,000/50,000

As this was a Dungeon, the monsters in here had both their HP and Attack Power greatly increased. They were much stronger compared to the Level 10 Elite monsters out in the fields.

One of the two MTs was a Shield Warrior, while the other was a Guardian Knight. Each of them held the two monsters’ agro. However, when Shi Feng saw the damage these two MTs dealt to the monsters, he was immediately stunned.

A normal attack from the Shield Warrior only dealt -32 damage to the Beastman Warriors. When the Shield Warrior used Heroic Strike, he only dealt -66 damage. Meanwhile, the Guardian Knight fared even worse than the Shield Warrior. The Guardian Knight’s normal attack only dealt -24 damage, while his Divine Strike only dealt -51 damage.

Both of these MTs were Level 10 players, and both of them wielded Mysterious-Iron Weapons. Even if it were a one-handed weapon, when faced with an Elite monster of the same level, it should not deal such little damage. Thus, Shi Feng was shocked by this sight he witnessed.

Although the two MTs took care to evade the attacks of the monsters, they were very clumsy. As a result, the number of attacks they received exceeded the number of times they dodged. Moreover, each time they received an attack, they needed to retreat a few steps before they could stabilize themselves. The only fortunate thing was that the damage they received was not high; they received around -300 damage from each attack. Meanwhile, each MT possessed around 2,400 HP. With two monsters attacking each MT simultaneously, each MT received a rough total of -600 damage; a quarter of their total HP. This situation resulted in the healers suffering.

However, Shi Feng was similarly shocked when he discovered that both MTs possessed around 2,400 HP.

What the heck?!

Isn’t their HP a little too high?

They both couldn’t have only added their Free Attribute Points into Endurance, completely ignoring Strength and Agility, right?

However, this was the only explanation that made sense. It explained why, even though both MTs were clearly gaming experts, they required so much effort just to dodge an attack and why their damages were so pitiful. In contrast, a Level 10 Assassin, who similarly used a one-handed weapon, could deal over -100 damage to an Elite monster like the Beastman Warrior. They could even deal over -200 damage if they used a skill. The MTs’ Strength was just abysmal. Their Agility was similarly too low, preventing them from dodging attacks that they could have clearly evaded.

It was obvious that the players of the Assassin’s Alliance have yet to adapt to the battle methods of God’s Domain. They clearly possessed plenty of expert players, yet, they were unable to exhibit their full potential. It was no wonder the Assassin’s Alliance became an obscure existence during the early stages of the game. Only after half a year had passed since God’s Domain’s launch did they gain some achievements. If the Assassin’s Alliance battled the Boss of the Beastman Munition Factory like so, Shi Feng would be surprised if they didn’t team-wipe. It was truly a wonder as to how they managed to clear a 10-man Hard Mode Team Dungeon.

“I wish to say something; is that alright?” Shi Feng looked at Cruel Sword, asking softly.

Although the Assassin’s Alliance now possessed Lone Tyrant as a great enemy, the members of the team still had negative opinions of Shi Feng. They only kept their mouths shut due to his relationship with Stabbing Heart. However, if Shi Feng dared push his luck, they would not sit idle.

“Speak your mind. As long as it benefits the Dungeon raid, we will not reject it,” Cruel Sword had managed to discern Shi Feng’s capabilities somewhat. He could somewhat understand why Gentle Snow would take a fancy to Shi Feng. After all, Shi Feng indeed possessed strength.

“Can we replace the two MTs?” Shi Feng asked, holding nothing back.
