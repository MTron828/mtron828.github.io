Chapter 212 - Raiding Karur

By taking turns attacking Karur, the two Guardian Knights quickly established a strong hold on Karur’s aggro. However, compared to when they battled Elite monsters, the pressure on the healers had visibly increased.

Moreover, both Water Lake and White Feather were clearly unfamiliar with the Boss’s attack patterns; their movements were somewhat stiff when dodging attacks. Right now, they could only dodge every other sent at them. Even so, compared to the last time the Assassin’s Alliance had raided Karur, the healers were having a slightly easier time keeping these MTs alive. The healers’ mana consumption made this obvious.

Originally, Cruel Sword still worried that the two Guardian Knights could not manage. However, based on the results before him, it was clearly an unnecessary thought. The healers managed themselves with perfect order right now, unlike the several raids before where they had to cast their heals desperately, without caring about any proper order. The four healers couldn’t even catch their breaths unless they wanted the previous two MTs to die instantly.

In reality, such failures were very common. In God’s Domain, Level 10 players had a large threshold to overcome. The levels before Level 10 were merely an adaptation period. Once players reached Level 10, they would no longer receive any preferential treatment. Hence, entering a Level 10, 20-man Hard Mode Team Dungeon at Level 10 was the equivalent of entering a Level 5, 20-man Hell Mode Team Dungeon at Level 5. How could it possibly be easy?

In addition, Bosses would have much higher intelligence. It would take a certain degree of skill to hold the aggro of a Boss and prevent it from attacking the ranged classes and healers. MTs especially needed to know how to pin down and restrain the Boss monsters, as just having aggro did not mean that the Boss would only hit the MT. After all, even with aggro, Boss monsters would still find an opportune moment to massacre the healers, the weakest players on the team. When this occurred, MTs had the task of restraining the Boss, preventing it from attacking the healers. Hence, the requirements for an MT’s techniques were very high.

If the previous MTs were currently tanking the Boss, they would fare much better than Water Lake and White Feather regarding techniques. They had simply made a mistake during the allocation of their Free Attribute Points. However, there was no way to reset one’s Attribute Points in God’s Domain, so these two players could only be replaced. Moreover, for a long time, these two players would have to allocate all the Free Attribute Points they obtained from leveling up into both Strength and Agility. Otherwise, they would cripple their characters.

“Everyone, start attacking now. Berserkers and Swordsmen, assist the MTs in blocking some attacks. Focus your attacks on the Boss’s weapons or arms, and aim your attacks where they can interrupt the Boss’s attack. As for ranged classes, focus on dealing as much damage as you can,” Shi Feng commanded.

Immediately, a group of players charged forward to give Karur a beating, while the ranged players launched their bombardment at Karur.

-124, -137, -108, -189, -175...

One damage after another appeared above Karur’s head. However, the damage was not particularly high. Among these, the highest damage dealt belonged to the Berserker, Cruel Sword. His normal attacks could deal around -266 damage with each hit, while a Violent Strike could deal up to -448 damage. Right behind Cruel Sword was Stabbing Heart. As Stabbing Heart was an Assassin, his normal attacks could only deal around -120 damage with each hit. However, his attack rate was much faster than Cruel Sword’s. Meanwhile, a 5-star Eviscerate decimated 587 HP from Karur.

Ranking in third was the team’s cute and lovable little sister, the Elementalist, Mu Qing. She was the captain of the Assassin’s Alliance’s Elementalist team, and her techniques were first-rate. She was also one of the famous female Elementalists in Star-Moon Kingdom; she could rank within the top 100 Elementalists within Star-Moon Kingdom. Every one of her attacks could deal around -300 to -400 damage, but due to her spells requiring a long time to cast, her overall damage was slightly less than the two aforementioned players.

Originally, Cruel Sword had intended to say to Shi Feng, “Look! Isn’t our team’s damage output powerful? Why don’t you join our Guild? The position of First Vice Leader will be yours if you do!”

However, when Cruel Sword saw Shi Feng charging at Karur, subsequently slashing his sword at Karur, Cruel Sword was immediately dumbfounded. His words shrunk back into a secluded location in his mind.

Shi Feng’s two casual slashes dealt damages of -395 and -376 to Karur. Immediately after, Shi Feng followed up with a Level 10 Chop. The skill achieved a critical hit, instantly causing -2,137 damage to Karur. He then continued by using Thundering Flash, dealing damages of -643, -832, and -1,102 to Karur, as well as inflicting a damage amplification effect.

Shi Feng then abruptly jumped up into the air. As he descended, he smashed the Abyssal Blade covered in the power of thunder and fire down onto Karur’s head. Suddenly, Karur let out a soul-piercing scream of pain.

Thunder Flame Explosion instantly caused -3,312 damage, and everyone on the team, aside from Shi Feng, became slack-jawed when they witnessed this scene.

If Water Lake had not reacted quickly by using Mock, followed by Righteous Punishment, Shi Feng might have snagged most, if not all, of Karur’s aggro.

“Stabbing Heart, just where did you find a Swordsman expert as amazing as him?” Mu Qing’s exquisite lips parted as she gaped and involuntarily questioned Stabbing Heart. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As Mu Qing had not started out in Red Leaf Town, she was not particularly knowledgeable about Shi Feng. Since the launch of God’s Domain, she had always focused on leveling up and raiding Dungeons. Even after she entered White River City, she had not met many players who could surpass her.

Hence, Mu Qing naturally considered herself as a top-tier expert. However, Shi Feng had utterly shattered that belief. The highest damage she could deal was only around -700 points, and that was when she achieved a critical hit. Meanwhile, Shi Feng could casually deal over -700 damage with a single hit. Right now, he had even dealt over -3,000 damage to a High Chieftain ranked Boss. Mu Qing felt extremely embarrassed to think that she actually thought of herself as a top-tier expert. What a joke!

“Hehe, isn’t this big brother amazing? Shortly after I started playing God’s Domain, I discovered Brother Ye Feng’s prowess! With such a massive damage output, the First Clear of this Hard Mode Dungeon will definitely be ours this time!” Stabbing Heart gleefully said. After all, he was the one who had invited Shi Feng to this raid. Now that Shi Feng performed so valiantly, shocking everyone on the team, Stabbing Heart felt extremely proud.

“Scram! You’re not Ye Feng; what’s there to be proud of?! If you have the ability, then show me that you can deal over 1,000 damage!” Mu Qing glared at Stabbing Heart.

“Little Sister Mu Qing, you think too highly of me! How can I compare to Brother Ye Feng? He is the publicly acknowledged god-ranked expert of White River City! His damage alone can trump over a dozen players! I would be satisfied if I had even a third of his damage.” Stabbing Heart smiled bitterly.

Shi Feng was a great expert just like Gentle Snow. He and Shi Feng were on entirely different levels, so how could he compare to Shi Feng?

Previously, the players who still had some complaints about Shi Feng now had none.

Shi Feng was simply too amazing. Not only were his attacks incredibly powerful, but the timing and techniques he applied to interrupt the Boss’s rhythm continuously were also praiseworthy. Every time one of Shi Feng’s swords attacked Karur, his other sword would simultaneously strike at Karur’s saber, shifting the Boss’s attack slightly. This situation allowed the two MTs to dodge Karur’s attacks with far more ease, greatly reducing the burden on the healers.

At this moment, everyone finally understood what a true Swordsman was. Aside from having fierce attacks, Shi Feng could also nimbly assist the MT. With such a Swordsman on the team, raiding the Dungeon became much easier than before. By making a rough estimate, their chances of victory had risen by at least twofold.

At this moment, Cruel Sword suddenly sent a private message to Mu Qing, “Mu Qing, you’re one of the great beauties in our Guild. You can see how amazing Ye Feng is; it would be a shame not to recruit him into our Guild. It wouldn’t be too good for a brute like me to invite him directly. Can you use your charms to persuade him to join us? If you manage to pull Ye Feng into our Guild, I can guarantee that your current treatment will increase by threefold, and you will also be promoted to an elder of the Guild.”

Cruel Sword also tried to think of a few other methods to recruit Shi Feng into the Assassin’s Alliance. However, he immediately discovered that the Assassin’s Alliance did not have any great benefits to Shi Feng. With Shi Feng’s techniques, even first-rate Guilds would willingly wage a bloody battle with each other to recruit him. As for the price tag the Assassin’s Alliance could offer, any first-rate Guilds could easily double or triple the amount. Hence, the only option Cruel Sword had remaining was to play the relationship card.

Looking at Shi Feng’s age, he should only be in his early twenties. He was at the age where he should be both vigorous and passionate. Meanwhile, a great beauty like Mu Qing was perfect for this situation.

Although Cruel Sword hated resorting to such methods, the competition in God’s Domain was just too intense. There were plenty of Guilds using similar tactics. If he continued being conservative, he might regret it in the future.

“Guild Leader, are you for real?” Mu Qing excitedly asked.

“Of course,” Cruel Sword earnestly replied.

“Guild Leader, leave it to me! With this young lady’s charm, I will definitely recruit Ye Feng into our Guild!” Mu Qing laughed coquettishly, her large eyes shifting towards Shi Feng.

Cruel Sword had similarly notified Stabbing Heart of his plan. However, Stabbing Heart simply shook his head and smiled bitterly after he heard it.

Stabbing Heart really wished to say, “If even a saint like Gentle Snow and a demoness like Zhao Yueru failed to capture Ye Feng’s heart, I’m afraid Mu Qing will not have any chances at all.”

Although Mu Qing was indeed a beauty as pretty as a flower, when Stabbing Heart gazed at Mu Qing’s flat chest and recalled Gentle Snow’s and Zhao Yueru’s outstanding lethal weapons... They were on entirely different levels...

However, Stabbing Heart did not try to ruin Mu Qing’s beautiful fantasy.

At this moment, Karur’s HP had decreased to 50%. Suddenly, Karur let out an angry bellow.

“Everyone, get away from the Boss!” Shi Feng knew that Karur was about to use Blade Storm.

With Shi Feng’s reminder, the elites of the Assassin’s Alliance quickly distanced themselves more than 20 yards from Karur. Shortly after, Karur started spinning, transforming into a tornado that engulfed everything around it.

Even after Karur’s Blade Storm ended, nobody from the team had died. At worst, there were some players who had their HP damaged to a critical point. However, they were healed back to full HP by the healers very quickly.

Following which, the team proceeded to decrease Karur’s HP to 40%. Karur then started using his Avatar Slash. Although Karur only used Avatar Slash once every 20 seconds, there were bound to be some players who were extremely unlucky, chosen as targets for seven or eight consecutive times. For these unlucky players, surviving would be difficult regardless of how they held on.

As one team member after another fell, Karur’s HP also decreased to 10%. Karur went berserk. His speed and Attack Power soared by 30%, and he now had a critical hit effect.

White Feather, unfortunately, received a critical hit. Even with Protection Blessing activated, he instantly lost over 1,400 HP. Moreover, when White Feather received this hit, he only had around 60% of his total HP remaining. Hence, he instantly died.

White Feather’s death greatly increased the pressure on Water Lake. To make things worse, there were only 12 players left alive in the team, while Karur still had 4% of his HP remaining, almost 20,000 HP.

Helpless, Shi Feng could only choose to use one of his trump cards, the Flame Burst.

During the short two-second cast time, Karur had used Avatar Slash once more, instant-killing three more players. One of the three players killed was even a healer. This was truly a desperate situation.

Meanwhile, Karur still had 3% of his HP, which meant that he had around 13,000 HP remaining.

At this moment, the Abyssal Blade in Shi Feng’s hand started glowing a dazzling white. The white glow surrounding the Abyssal Blade shone like a miniature sun; its presence alone raised the surrounding temperature by several folds.

Shi Feng activated Wind Blade and arrived behind Karur. Lightly jumping up, Shi Feng brandished the Abyssal Blade at Karur’s back, instantly forming six sword images. The six sword images resembling the sun instantly devoured Karur, causing frightening damages of -2,153, -2,203, -2,178, -4,356, -2,206, -4,422 to appear above Karur’s head.

Under this tremendous might, Karur’s four-meter-tall body shot like a cannonball towards a steel wall.

Boom!

An indentation in the shape of Karur immediately formed on the steel wall. Meanwhile, Karur was thoroughly charred black, as void of life as a stone.
