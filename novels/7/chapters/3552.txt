Chapter 627 – Second City Building Order

“A political marriage? Is it with a big family from one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but be a little surprised when he heard Billowing Water’s recount.

The various powerful families in the Greater World were massive in size. It was especially so for the families operating conglomerates that had existed for centuries or millennia. These families easily had over ten thousand members. For this reason, political marriages between these powerful families and conglomerates were very common, and the Blaze Conglomerate wasn’t an exception.

However, as far as Shi Feng knew, the Blaze Conglomerate’s Fourth Young Miss was the apple of the Blaze Conglomerate’s eye. She was a monstrously talented individual who became a great grandmaster at the young age of twenty-two.

In fact, this Fourth Young Miss was so talented that before becoming twenty-two of age, the Blaze Conglomerate had kept a tight lid over her talent and only revealed it after her mental strength reached the great grandmaster standard.

In other words, the Blaze Conglomerate should be well aware of its Fourth Young Miss’s talent. Even if the Blaze Conglomerate was going to arrange a political marriage with another power, it should have selected a less-talented family member for the task. It would be highly illogical for the Blaze Conglomerate to use its Fourth Young Miss for the task.

Meanwhile, unless the Blaze Conglomerate’s current chairman was an utter buffoon, the fact that he would be willing to marry the conglomerate’s Fourth Young Miss off to another power showed that the power in question was extraordinary. And in Shi Feng’s opinion, even the families behind the average pseudo-apex power wouldn’t warrant the Blaze Conglomerate to sacrifice its Fourth Young Miss, so the other party should be one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers.

“No, it’s a small family that few people have ever heard about,” Billowing Water said, shaking her head. “However, that family has experienced a rapid rise in the Eternal Realm. Currently, it has already annexed over ten upper-ranking hegemonic powers and fully occupied two fortresses. It is also putting up a good fight against the various pseudo-apex powers based in the Eternal Continent’s capital city, and it even has a slight edge over them.

“For some reason, the family’s debauched Third Successor has taken a liking to my little sister. Moreover, I don’t know how, but the chairman somehow got persuaded into agreeing with the marriage. Many Elders and executives in our family stand on the chairman’s side. If I want to stop this marriage from happening, I must have sufficient strength in the Eternal Realm to negotiate with the chairman.”

“…I can get you 300,000 in a week, but what will you use as collateral, Miss Billow?” Shi Feng asked after pondering for a moment. “Three hundred thousand Eternal Gold is not a small sum. It is a significant fortune to any pseudo-apex power. It is especially so now that everyone is frantically buying up real estate.”

For most powers currently operating in the Eternal Realm, accumulating 300,000 Eternal Gold in a week should be nigh impossible. However, it wasn’t out of the question for Zero Wing. With Zero Wing’s ownership of the Secret Crystal Trading Firm and Shi Feng’s Divine Engraver Legacy, accumulating 300,000 Eternal Gold in a week should be doable.

Only, if Shi Feng were to agree to help Billowing Water, he would stifle Zero Wing’s development. After all, Zero Wing currently already possessed land in a second-tier mobile city. So long as Zero Wing had enough capital and resources, it could expand its influence and recruit experts in the Eternal Realm on a large scale.

“As you know, the Blaze Conglomerate had fortunately come across a City Building Order previously, Guild Leader Black Flame.” Billowing Water was unfazed when she heard Shi Feng bringing up the topic of collateral. Calmly, she said, “But aside from the conglomerate’s City Building Order, I also have one myself.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You also have one?” Shi Feng was shocked.

City Building Orders were exceedingly rare in the Eternal Realm. As far as he was aware, only Level 160-plus World Bosses dropped them at a low probability.

The Blaze Conglomerate should already be thanking its lucky stars for being able to obtain one. If it became known that the Blaze Conglomerate had two City Building Orders in its possession, every power in the Eternal Realm would immediately try to erase its existence.

“I was lucky enough to steal it from the Holy Race. I was originally planning to secretly construct a Guild City once I have accumulated enough funds, but I can’t afford that anymore,” Billowing Water explained. “I’m sure you know how valuable a City Building Order is, Guild Leader Black Flame. If I use it as collateral, you will stand to profit regardless of whether I can repay you.”

Shi Feng nodded in agreement. Then, he asked, “May I ask that you prove your possession of the City Building Order, Miss Billow?”

City Building Orders were easily worth a million Eternal Gold in the current Eternal Realm. After all, there weren’t many Level 160-plus World Bosses in the Eternal Realm, and the drop rate for City Building Orders was less than 3%.

Not to mention, in a situation where teleportation between NPC Cities was impossible, constructing a Guild City in a high-level resource map would guarantee the city’s owner a highly lucrative source of income. It wouldn’t take long for the owner to recoup their investments.

“Of course,” Billowing Water answered before taking out an ancient parchment engraved with golden runes and sharing its information with Shi Feng. “Feel free to verify it, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

It was already unbelievable for any player or power to get their hands on one City Building Order in the current Eternal Realm, let alone two. It was only normal for Shi Feng to seek verification.

“It is indeed a City Building Order for the Eternal Realm,” Shi Feng said, nodding as he finished inspecting the parchment in Billowing Water’s hands. At the same time, a trace of shock flashed in the depths of his eyes.

The parchment in Billowing Water’s possession was indeed a City Building Order. There were no inconsistencies with the item information, either. Only, Billowing Water’s City Building Order wasn’t meant for the Eternal Continent. Instead, it was meant for the Western Continent…

There were three types of City Building Orders in the Eternal Realm, each corresponding to one of the three continents. Among them, those engraved with purple runes corresponded to the Northern Continent, also known as the Eternal Continent, those engraved with golden runes corresponded to the Western Continent, and those engraved with blue runes corresponded to the Southern Continent.

However, as the item information for all three types of City Building Orders was the same, players unaware of the differences would only learn about them when they tried to use their City Building Orders on the wrong continent.

Meanwhile, for human players, the value of a City Building Order for the Western Continent wouldn’t just be worth one million Eternal Gold.

To establish a foothold on the Western Continent, the Seven Luminaries Alliance had gone as far as to mobilize the Golden Kingdom, a Divine Artifact, to protect Seven Luminaries Town. If the Seven Luminaries Alliance could acquire a Guild City on the Western Continent simply by spending one million Eternal Gold, it would probably die from happiness.

“Can we sign the contract now, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Billowing Water asked anxiously. “I urgently need 10,000 Eternal Gold right now. As for the remaining 290,000 Eternal Gold, I hope you can deliver a portion of it to me every day over a week. And if I can’t repay you in two weeks, I will give this City Building Order to you. Do we have a deal, Guild Leader Black Flame?”
