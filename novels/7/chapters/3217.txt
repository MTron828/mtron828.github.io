Chapter 292 – Peak State

When Shi Feng swung the Winter of Eternal Night, the surging tide of darkness instantly froze. Even space itself had become frozen, and not a single particle of mana could move in the slightest, all of them suspended in place.

Amazing!

After looking at the frozen space around him and the Winter of Eternal Night in his hand, Shi Feng couldn’t help but be shocked.

Although Legendary Weapons had the power to allow players to transcend tiers, he didn’t think he could achieve such an effect with the Winter of Eternal Night.

Even mana was prevented from carrying out their most basic operations!

This frightening passive ability was definitely enough to put the Winter of Eternal Night into the ranks of the Ten Great Legendary Weapons.

It could be said that Spells would become nothing but a joke in front of the Winter of Eternal Night.

Spells relied on the movement of mana to exist. If even mana was prohibited from moving, it would naturally become impossible for a spellcaster to maintain the integrity of their Spells.

Meanwhile, Demon King Firenze was also stunned by Shi Feng’s Radiant Night.

Dark Tide was Firenze’s strongest Spell. This one Spell was more than enough for him to heavily damage opponents of the same tier. Yet, Shi Feng had neutralized it so easily…

However, Firenze was a Tier 5 Demon King. Moreover, he was even a Demon Monarch among Demons. Even though this unexpected development had shocked him, he quickly recovered his calm and transformed his scepter into an axe. Then, he appeared before Shi Feng via Spatial Movement and swung his five-meter-long axe down at Shi Feng. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Firenze did not complement his attack with any techniques. Even so, his attack carried overwhelming speed and power, enough for him to obliterate an entire city.

......

Bang!

Countless sparks appeared when Shi Feng’s longsword collided with Firenze’s axe. At the same time, Firenze’s axe was knocked away, indicating that the longsword carried more power than the axe. This one exchange instantly showed who was superior when it came to Strength.

However, Firenze remained unfazed even after seeing the disparity in Strength. A cold smile had even appeared on his face.

“So what if you can block my attack?”

A calm and contemptuous voice flowed out of Firenze’s mouth. At the same time, another Firenze had suddenly appeared behind Kalisha, the axe in his hands already descending toward the Dragon Princess, who appeared to be chanting something with her eyes closed.

Tier 5 Spell, Worldly Doppelganger!

It was a Spell that allowed the user to create a carbon copy of themselves. The doppelganger created would have 100% of the user’s Basic Attributes and all of the user’s Skills and Spells.

However, Shi Feng did not panic in this situation. Instead, he simply smiled as he swung the Winter of Eternal Night.

Sword’s Orbit!

Suddenly, a river of stars that covered a 500-yard radius suddenly formed with Shi Feng as the center. At a glance, it looked as if a miniature galaxy had formed within the temple.

Meanwhile, before Firenze’s doppelganger could hit Kalisha with its axe, it was sent flying and crashing into a wall by one of the many stars flowing around Shi Feng.

.

Firenze’s doppelganger wasn’t the only one sent flying. Even the real Firenze standing before Shi Feng had similarly been sent flying into a wall, his HP instantly falling by over 100 million.

For a time, both Demon Kings couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng with a bewildered look, their minds failing to understand what Shi Feng had just done.

It’s been a while since I’ve felt so liberated! As expected of the Ancient God of Thunder’s final creation! I didn’t think it could let me use Sword’s Orbit in its peak state.

Satisfaction filled Shi Feng as he looked at the Winter of Eternal Night. At the same time, he couldn’t help but start to pity Firenze.

Sword’s Orbit was the technique he had relied on to rise to prominence.

Initially, Sword’s Orbit was nothing more than an ordinary combat technique. However, as time passed and he continued perfecting the technique, Sword’s Orbit had also continuously grown stronger with him.

Because of this, if he wanted to unleash Sword’s Orbit’s full potential, he would have to reach the Tier 5 standard at the very least. Just having Tier 5 Mana and Concentration wouldn’t be enough. His Physique would also have to reach Tier 5.

Only after meeting these three conditions could he perfectly integrate World Creation with Sword’s Orbit and unleash power rivaling the Second Sword, Holy Devour. In addition, everything within a 500-yard radius would be within his attack range, and he would no longer have to worry about Concentration expenditure.

Subsequently, Firenze and his doppelganger could be seen attacking Kalisha one time after another. However, no matter what attack they used, they couldn’t even get close to Kalisha, let alone injure her. Shi Feng had stopped all of their attacks without fail.

Unfortunately, even though Shi Feng was suppressing Firenze, there was nothing he could do to really threaten the Demon King.

As a Level 130, Tier 5 Demon King, Firenze’s base HP was over 300 billion. His battle recovery as a Demon Monarch even allowed him to recover 4% of his HP every five seconds. He simply wasn’t an existence that could be killed by a Tier 4 player wielding a Legendary Weapon.

Fortunately, Shi Feng’s job wasn’t to kill Firenze. All he needed to do was keep the Demon King busy for one minute.

Ten seconds… Twenty seconds… Forty seconds…

Time quickly passed by in the temple. After Shi Feng held on for one full minute, Kalisha suddenly opened her eyes. Immediately afterward, the expressions of both Firenzes twisted, and the life in their eyes rapidly disappeared.

When Firenze finally died, Kalisha’s expression had also become deathly pale, sweat rolling down her forehead. It was obvious that killing Firenze had put a huge toll on her body.

Meanwhile, along with Firenze’s death, the sound of another system notification entered Shi Feng’s ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have liberated Kalisha from the curse plaguing her. Rewarding five levels and 20 Free Legacy Skill Points.

…

Immediately, Shi Feng’s level went from 125 to 130. After reaching Tier 4, he would receive two Legacy Skill Points for every three levels he gained. After including the leftover Legacy Skill Points he had when he was at Tier 3, he now had a total of 221 Legacy Skill Points. If he wanted to, he could spend 200 Legacy Skill Points to learn a Tier 4 Apex Legacy Skill.

However, before Shi Feng could decide which Apex Legacy Skill he would learn, Kalisha suddenly turned her gaze toward him.

“Heaven’s blessed, thanks to your help, I was able to get rid of the curse cast on me by the Evil Gods and Demon Gods. I will now be leaving this small world and heading to a different place to reclaim my lost power,” Kalisha said with a tired expression. However, despite her fatigued look, her eyes were full of life. “I have seen your fate. So, as gratitude for your help, I can offer you two choices.

“The first choice is to remain in this small world. This temple holds my Ancient Dragon Legacy. Even if you cannot use it, you can give it to someone else, and whoever you give it to will achieve greatness rivaling the Ancient Gods.

“The second choice is to leave this small world and head to the greater world to help me collect 300 God Crystals within three months. As compensation, I will give you the primal ore vein that this island has birthed. I will also send you to a place where one of the Seven Luminaries Codex’s fragments reside.

“This temple does not have much power left, so you will only have five minutes to consider.”
