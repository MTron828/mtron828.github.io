Chapter 2876 – Shock!

“Impossible!”

Every player inside Ancient Rock City nearly had their eyes fall out of their sockets when they saw Beast Emperor and the other Tier 45 plummeting to the ground. Even the Zero Wing members present were stunned. This scene thoroughly exceeded their imagination.

In the current God’s Domain, Tier 4 players were already considered peak combatants and displayed a Guild’s foundation.

Yet, under Shi Feng’s Mana Domain, Beast Emperor and the other Tier 4 combatants on his side could exhibit only 20% or so of their usual combat power. They even lost their ability to fly and manipulate ambient Mana.

In the blink of an eye, these existences that originally stood at the peak of God’s Domain had become no different from Tier 3 players.

At this time, let alone a Tier 5 player like Shi Feng, even Tier 4 experts could slaughter Ancient Rock City’s defenders.

“This is the strength of Tier 5s?”

When the players who had evacuated Ancient Rock City looked at Shi Feng hovering proudly above the city, an indescribable sense of shock and horror filled their hearts. As veteran players of God’s Domain, they knew that a significant difference existed between tiers. They also knew that a Tier 5 player undoubtedly stood at the apex of all players in the current God’s Domain.

However, only after witnessing the power of a Tier 5 player did they understand how large the gap between Tier 4 and Tier 5 was. In front of a Tier 5 existence, Tier 4 players would only be making fools of themselves if they tried to win by zerg tactics!

The Tier 4 monsters among Ancient Rock City’s defenders, though, weren’t as badly off as the Tier 4 players. Because monsters mainly relied on their Basic Attributes and rarely manipulated the ambient Mana to do combat, their penalty was not as large as the Tier 4 players’.

Regardless, the Mythic ranked Evil Dark Dragons still had their combat power reduced by half, whereas the Superior Mythic ranked Faux Saint Slayers had theirs reduced by 30%. Moreover, all of them lost their ability to fly. Against Tier 4 players capable of flight, they would be at a significant disadvantage.

Unlike everyone else, Shi Feng wasn’t surprised at the scene before him.

Everyone failed to understand that his Mana Domain was different from the average Mana Domain. Existences at the World Creation standard could create a small world within their Mana Domains. The power of such a Mana Domain was on an entirely different level compared to the average Mana Domain.

Even a Tier 5 existence would be at a disadvantage if they got caught within a Tier 5 World Creation expert’s Mana Domain without any countermeasures, let alone Tier 4 players and monsters.

Meanwhile, after experiencing this unexpected turn of events, a hint of fear had surfaced in Beast Emperor’s eyes. Despite this situation, he still sneered, “Black Flame, don’t get too delighted just yet. Don’t forget that this is Ancient Rock City!”

As soon as Beast Emperor finished speaking, an enormous, threefold magic array manifested from the City Lord’s Mansion. After the magic array gathered Mana from the surroundings for a brief moment, it released pulses of Mana that enveloped the city. Immediately, the city defenders felt the heavy pressure on their bodies disappear.

Now, although Shi Feng’s Mana Domain still subjected everyone to a certain degree of suppression, their combat power had recovered to 80% of their usual. More importantly, they had also regained their ability to fly. Shi Feng was slightly surprised when he looked at the barrier enveloping Ancient Rock City. “What a powerful barrier. It seems you’ve invested quite a lot into this city.”

His Mana Domain could render even Master Magic Barriers useless. One would need to use at least a Grandmaster Magic Barrier to contend with his Mana Domain. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Magic Arrays were incredibly rare in God’s Domain, let alone a Grandmaster Magic Array that could cover an entire city. The value of every set of scrolls for such a magic array could rival that of Fragmented Legendary items.

“Black Flame! Do you think you’re the only one with the means to defend cities?” Looking at Shi Feng, Beast Emperor sneered, “This is an Ancient Grandmaster Magic Array! Although Ancient Rock City hasn’t reached the Main City level yet, it is no weaker than a Main City in terms of defense! Although you’re Tier 5, don’t even think about taking down Ancient Rock City!”

A Main City’s defensive magic array was wholly capable of withstanding Tier 5 attacks. So long as the magic array had a constant energy supply, even Tier 5 existences shouldn’t think of penetrating it.

Meanwhile, exhausting the energy supply of a Main City’s defensive magic array wasn’t something just one Tier 5 existence could accomplish. One would need several Tier 5 individuals or siege weapons with Tier 5 destructive power to do so.

However, Zero Wing only had one Tier 5 combatant now. In other words, breaking through Ancient Rock City’s defensive barrier would be nothing but a pipe dream!

When Beast Emperor finished speaking, the members of the various powers in Ancient Rock City sighed in relief. They then looked at Shi Feng with sneers on their faces.

“Black Flame, so what if you’re Tier 5?”

“That’s right! What can you do by yourself?!”

When Shi Feng had extended his Mana Domain before, everyone within Ancient Rock City had felt strong pressure overwhelming them. Saint’s Hand’s Tier 4 experts were no exception.

However, now that Ancient Rock City had deployed its defensive magic array, even a Tier 5 player like Shi Feng would be helpless against them. Next, all they needed to do was fight a war of attrition, something they did not fear in the slightest. After all, Ancient Rock City had accumulated a massive stockpile of Magic Crystals from the sales of Sacred Heart Amulets.

Not to mention, the Outerworld’s NPC forces would soon begin the second war against the eastern continent’s native forces. And in this upcoming war, the Outerworld forces would set Zero Wing as their primary target. Zero Wing couldn’t afford a war of attrition with Ancient Rock City at all! The longer it fought, the worse off it would be in the upcoming war!

“Guild Leader, let’s attack the barrier together! I want to see how long it can last against our combined attacks!” Fire Dance said, gnashing her teeth as she looked at Ancient Rock City’s arrogant residents. “That’s right! If it’s Spells with Tier 5 power, I can use a few as well! I refuse to believe we can’t break this barrier!” Zhao Yueru said, nodding in agreement with Fire Dance.

For other Tier 4 players, exhibiting Tier 5 power would indeed be a challenging task. However, her Frostflame’s Wrath was a top-tier Fragmented Legendary Weapon. With it, the fire- and ice-type Tier 4 Spells she cast could exhibit Tier 5 power. “No, that won’t be necessary,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhao Yueru was a bona fide mobile turret. If he hadn’t gotten promoted to Tier 5, she would rank at the very top of Zero Wing in terms of firepower.

However, besieging a city was different from attacking monsters. The defenders inside the city could launch attacks to counter Zhao Yueru’s Spells. The defenders could even target her directly, preventing her from casting her Spells altogether. This would drastically reduce Zhao Yueru’s ability to damage the defensive magic array. Having only the occasional Tier 5 attack land on the defensive magic array would yield hardly any effect.

“But we can’t just sit still and do nothing, right?” Zhao Yueru said in annoyance.

Although she knew that she couldn’t contribute much, it was still better than nothing.

Moreover, if they allowed Saint’s Hand to continue behaving so arrogantly, it would deal a massive blow to Zero Wing’s morale. After all, Zero Wing had already declared to the public that it would capture Ancient Rock City.

Currently, everyone was watching this fight; the various powers absent from this battlefield were no exception. They were all observing every detail of the battlefield and tensely awaiting the outcome of this siege.

If Zero Wing won, then the various superpowers would no longer dare entertain thoughts of resisting Zero Wing on the eastern continent. However, if Zero Wing returned foiled, many superpowers would begin having designs on Zero Wing. They might even ally with Saint’s Hand to deal with Zero Wing.

“Of course not,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “I’m merely saying that you don’t need to take action. All you need to do is watch.”

“Just watch?” Zhao Yueru looked at Shi Feng in confusion.

The Guild City in front of them rivaled a Main City. How could they possibly capture it just by looking at it?

The other Zero Wing members present were also confused, failing to understand what was going through their Guild Leader’s mind.

However, Shi Feng did not bother explaining himself. Instead, he flew to an altitude several hundred meters above Ancient Rock City and began chanting an incantation, his chanting causing the surrounding Mana to swarm toward him.

Upon seeing Shi Feng’s actions, Ancient Rock City’s defenders laughed. “Are you trying to use a Tier 5 large-scale destruction Spell?” Beast Emperor sneered as he looked at Shi Feng. “This is nothing but a futile struggle! Let alone a Tier 5 Sword Saint like yourself, even a Tier 5 Divine Mage can’t do anything against Ancient Rock City’s defensive magic array!

“Everyone, prepare for battle! Target the Flying Ship!”

Beast Emperor ignored Shi Feng’s attack, as there was no way weakened Tier 4 attacks could do anything against Shi Feng. However, it was a different story for the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. The Flying Ship wouldn’t last long before a barrage of Tier 4 attacks. It would fall quickly even if Zero Wing’s Tier 4 experts defended it.

The many Tier 4 magical classes atop the city walls promptly began casting their respective Spells, while the other Tier 4 ranged classes launched attacks at the Flying Ship. The 30-plus Evil Dark Dragons took to the skies and bombarded the Flying Ship.

The Zero Wing members aboard the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship felt an invisible pressure weighing down their bodies.

Upon seeing the oncoming attacks, Fire Dance yelled hurriedly, “Magical classes, deploy defensive magic arrays!”

Even a Tier 5 Legendary monster would suffer if it tried to take on the attacks of more than a hundred Tier 4 individuals, let alone Tier 4 players like themselves. Moreover, the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship only had Tier 4 combat power.

However, just as the two sides were about to clash, Shi Feng finished his incantation’s final verse.

Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a spatial tear spanning over a thousand yards appeared above Ancient Rock City. The spatial tear made it seem as if the sky was about to collapse, inevitably drawing everyone’s attention.

“What is Black Flame trying to do?”

Questions filled everyone’s mind as they gazed at the gigantic spatial tear.

Simultaneously, everyone felt an inexplicable chill overwhelm their heart. They could sense something terrifying in the spatial tear, and this feeling made even their souls shudder with dread.

Before anyone could say anything more, a gigantic claw the size of a four-story building extended from the spatial tear. Subsequently, a titanic figure gradually emerged from the spatial tear, blotting out the sky completely.

When everyone eventually discerned the identity of this figure, they were dumbfounded.

“A Dragon?!”
