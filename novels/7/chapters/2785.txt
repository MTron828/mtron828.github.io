Chapter 2786 – Foundation Versus Foundation?

Meteorite City, Skyflare Hotel:

Due to the arrival of Shi Feng’s group of four, Skyflare’s executives had decided to assemble in full. As a result, the conference room serving as the meeting venue seemed a bit crowded despite being the size of a basketball court.

Over 100 Skyflare executives filled the conference room, every one of them at Level 133 or above. Even the weakest among those present were at the Refinement Realm and Truth Realm standards. The number of peak experts exceeded 20.

If Skyflare operated in the modern God’s Domain with such a force, it would be considered a top adventurer team that even the various superpowers would be wary of. After all, only the superpowers could match such a force; first-rate Guilds wouldn’t even dream of accomplishing a similar feat.

In addition, among Skyflare’s executives, five possessed incredibly strong life auras, proof that they had crossed the Tier 4 threshold already. Compared to the rumors floating around the city, Skyflare actually had one more Tier 4 player under its command. Of the three newly promoted Tier 4 players, one of them was the female Assassin Crimson Billow. The remaining two were both vice commanders of Skyflare. One of them was Blood Blade, a Level 135 male Berserker, while the other was Fated Fern, a Level 135 female Oracle.

“What do you think, Brother Black Flame?” Lionheart asked when he saw Shi Feng enter the room. Pointing at the gathered Skyflare members, he chuckled and said, “These are the elites of Skyflare. Are they to your satisfaction?”

“They are indeed excellent.” Shi Feng nodded in agreement as he scanned the crowd before him. Smiling, he asked, “Is this the surprise you told me about, Commander Lionheart?”

Setting aside the five Tier 4 experts, just the 100-plus Tier 3 experts present already represented astonishing combat power. Many of these Tier 3 experts sported Epic items, with some even boasting Fragmented Legendary items. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the total number of Fragmented Legendary items that Skyflare had exceeded that of any individual superpower operating in the modern era.

With such a well-equipped team at his command, Lionheart indeed had the qualifications to be proud.

“Of course not.” Lionheart smiled, shaking his head. He then took out an ancient crystal from his bag and asked, “What do you think this is?”

After a casual glance at the crystal, Shi Feng immediately revealed a look of surprise on his face.

“A Tier 5 Sealing Crystal!” Shi Feng couldn’t help doubting his eyes as he took in the dark-gray crystal in Lionheart’s hand.

Tier 5 Magic Scrolls were incredibly rare in God’s Domain because Tier 5 Skills and Spells possessed astonishing power. The requirement for sealing them in a Magic Scroll was incredibly high. Moreover, even if one successfully stored a Tier 5 Skill, one would be fortunate if the resulting Magic Scroll could exhibit half of the Skill’s original power.

A Sealing Crystal, on the other hand, could perfectly seal Skills and Spells at the Tier 4 standard or above. Moreover, although Sealing Crystals were one-time-use items, they did not impose any usage requirements. Players could freely use the stored Skill or Spell at 100% potential.

Meanwhile, the darker the color of a Sealing Crystal, the stronger the Skill or Spell stored inside. Since Lionheart’s Sealing Crystal was dark gray, the sealed Skill or Spell was at the Tier 5 standard at the very minimum.

“That’s right. This is indeed a Tier 5 Sealing Crystal,” Lionheart said with a faint smile. “We got lucky and came across a visiting high noble from another city. After helping him complete an incredibly difficult quest, we were able to purchase this Tier 5 Sealing Crystal from him. “I believe that with this Tier 5 Sealing Crystal, our operation will proceed much more smoothly.”

“Indeed. If the Skill or Spell sealed inside is sufficiently powerful, it might be enough to land a heavy blow on the Infant Dragon,” Shi Feng said, nodding. While it was true that an unrestrained Tier 4 Infant Dragon was on par with Tier 5 monsters, that was true only for the average Tier 5 monster. A Tier 4 Infant Dragon still couldn’t stop Tier 5 Skills and Spells that were above average in power. Hence, this Tier 5 Sealing Crystal could indeed serve as a trump card in the upcoming raid.

“Skyflare will assist you with everything it has this time, Brother Black Flame. I have gathered all of Skyflare’s top experts. We have a total of 124 people, five of whom are at Tier 4. We have also finished distributing the teams. For the following operation, we will all listen to your command, Brother Black Flame,” Lionheart said proudly. “If you have anyone you wish to include in the team, you can freely make adjustments to the team, as well.”

“I really have to thank you for this, Commander Lionheart,” Shi Feng said gratefully.”

While he was somewhat confident of dealing with the Tier 4 Infant Dragon, he had never actually killed an unrestrained Tier 4 Infant Dragon. Hence, it wouldn’t be strange if their team suffered annihilation.

For the Skyflare adventurer team to give him its full support for such a risky operation required a lot of courage and determination.

“Nonsense. We are only helping each other, Brother Black Flame. If this operation succeeds, Skyflare will also greatly benefit from it, so how can we not give it our all?” Lionheart said. “If there are no problems on your side, we can take action at any time.”

Lionheart understood that their operation this time carried great risks. However, he had decided to go through with it not because he was betting on the low odds of success but to tie Shi Feng to his boat.

Both the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water were of considerable help to players in completing their Tier 4 Promotion Quest. One example of this was Crimson Billow, who had failed her Promotion Quest before. After using a Crystal of Souls, she had completed her Promotion Quest on the second attempt.

In fact, even Blood Blade and Fated Fern had mentioned that without the help of the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water, they would’ve most likely failed their promotions.

Hence, Lionheart began placing even greater importance on the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water. Meanwhile, if he wished to secure a stable supply of these two items, he had to befriend Shi Feng.

As for the Infant Dragon raid itself, Lionheart didn’t really care whether it succeeded or failed. So long as he could tie Shi Feng to his side, he would make a profit.

“There’s no problem on my side. However, we’ll need to reorganize the composition of your team, as I am going to add three people,” Shi Feng said.

“Three people?” Lionheart looked reflexively at the three people standing behind Shi Feng.

At this time, the three people behind Shi Feng had concealed their auras and information using Black Cloaks. However, based on the appearances they revealed, Lionheart recognized one of them as Yu Luo, whom he had met at the Auction House previously. As for the two other people, they should be part of the group that entered Meteorite City with Shi Feng.

What surprised Lionheart was that Shi Feng was actually bringing only three people for the operation.

After all, they were going to raid an Infant Dragon, a creature known to be invincible against opponents of the same tier. Let alone a team of 100-plus Tier 3 experts, even an army of 10,000 Tier 3 experts might not be enough to defeat the Infant Dragon.

Yet, Shi Feng was planning to bring only three people to the raid.

“Mhm. This is my first time visiting Meteorite City,” Shi Feng said, nodding. “Sorry for the poor display, Commander Lionheart.”

“Nonsense. Since you wish to adjust the team, we naturally don’t have a problem with it, Brother Black Flame,” Lionheart said, shaking his head. He then invited Shi Feng to the team and passed the team leader’s authority to Shi

Feng.

Afterward, Shi Feng inspected the team’s statistics and assigned Skyflare’s five Tier 5 players to one squadron. As for the Tier 3 players, he divided them across six squadrons, with one squadron having 12 healers and the other five having none.

Upon seeing Shi Feng’s team distribution, Skyflare’s members were inevitably confused. If their squadrons did not possess a single healer, what would they do when they got damaged?

While healers could heal players belonging to different squadrons, placing all of the team’s healers in a separate squadron would definitely lower their healing efficiency. Due to positioning issues, the healers wouldn’t be able to react immediately if players from other squadrons received damage.

However, what Skyflare’s members didn’t know was that Shi Feng had never thought about the team’s Tier 3 players taking damage and losing HP.

After all, if a Tier 3 player got hit by a Tier 4 Infant Dragon, even if it were just a scratch, the player would die without question. There was no need for a healer at all.

“Everyone in the healer squadron must prepare at least 20 Master Mana Recovery Potions and 20 Master Steel Potions. If you don’t have enough, you can go buy them now. I’ll pay for them,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the 12 Tier 3 healers.

At Shi Feng’s words, everyone present gasped.

A Master Mana Recovery Potion could not only instantly restore a player’s Mana to full but also increase a player’s Mana recovery speed by 150% for three minutes. With 20 Master Mana Recovery Potions, a healer could last through a battle involving hundreds of thousands of players.

A Master Steel Potion was even more extraordinary. At this stage of the game, it was considered a divine lifesaving potion.

When players consumed the potion, not only would their Defense increase by 300%, but their maximum HP would also increase by 1,000%. Although the potion only had a 15-second duration, its Cooldown was only 60 seconds.

If every healer carried 20 Master Steel Potions with them, they would practically be immortal healers, so long as their potion stock lasted.

“Oh, I almost forgot. Every healer must also carry at least five Magic Scrolls holding Tier 3 Defensive Curses. It would be even better if you have a Tier 4 Defensive Magic Scroll,” Shi Feng added.

“This...” Lionheart felt a little awkward when he heard Shi Feng’s words. “Brother Black Flame, I don’t think there are even 20 or 30 Magic Scrolls holding Tier 3 Defensive Curses. I’m afraid it’ll be impossible to supply every healer with five.”

“Is that so?” After giving the matter some thought, Shi Feng said, “If that’s the case, have everyone bring at least one.”

Afterward, Shi Feng spent the next half an hour reorganizing and reoutfitting the team until he was satisfied.

“This should be enough.” Looking at the items the team members carried, Shi Feng nodded and said, “Next, we can start making our way over to the Dragon.”

“Okay!” Lionheart revealed a bright smile when he heard Shi Feng’s words. He then turned to Wind Chaser and said, “Chaser, go make the necessary preparations quickly.”

“Understood!” Wind Chaser nodded, aware of Lionheart’s intentions. Their purpose in assisting Shi Feng this time wasn’t to raid the Tier 4 Infant Dragon but to rope him to their side, as well as show him the power of the Skyflare adventurer team.

“Preparations? Aren’t we setting off right away?” Shi Feng asked strangely. “Brother Black Flame, you might not be aware of this, but that Infant Dragon’s location is far from Meteorite City. Even if we travel on Mounts, it’ll take us around three days to arrive,” Lionheart said. “Hence, for the sake of this operation, I contacted the city’s high nobles a few days ago to borrow some Flying Mounts from them.”

“You’ll rent Flying Mounts?” Shi Feng was a little surprised. He never thought that Lionheart would help him to such an extent. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Ghostfire Hills where the Infant Dragon had its lair was indeed distant. Even the shortest route there would require them to cross nearly 30 leveling maps, including some Level 140 to Level 150 maps along the way. Hence, reaching the Infant Dragon wouldn’t be an easy task. In addition, Flying Mounts were exceedingly rare in the ancient God’s Domain, for some reason. They were so rare that no player in Meteorite City had gotten their hands on a Flying Mount even now. Hence, players who wished to travel across long distances quickly would have to rent Flying Mounts from the city’s high nobles.

However, to do so, one would first have to raise their Favorability with a high noble to the level of Respect. Meanwhile, in Meteorite City, the players eligible to rent a Flying Mount numbered no more than ten. Moreover, the rental cost was a whopping 5,000 Magic Crystals per day.

Most importantly, players could rent Flying Mounts only ten times per month at most. Hence, the city’s player forces would normally choose to rent Flying Mounts only for urgent matters.

With so many people participating in the operation this time, Skyflare would have to rent at least seven Flying Mounts. In other words, Skyflare would use up seven of its monthly rental opportunities.

“That’s right. With the Flying Mounts, we’ll need only half a day to reach the Ghostfire Hills,” Lionheart said delightedly.

In the entire Meteorite City, he was most likely the only person who would dare make such a generous move.

However, Shi Feng shook his head in response and said calmly, “There’s no need to rent Flying Mounts from those high nobles. You’ll be wasting your rental opportunities. We can just fly there right away.” “Fly there right away?” Lionheart parroted Shi Feng’s words in confusion. “Mhm.” Shi Feng nodded. Smiling, he said, “I have a Flying tool, so we can fly there right away. There’s no need for you to trouble yourself.”

After saying so, Shi Feng led Lionheart and the others to the Skyflare Hotel’s rooftop.

Skyflare’s bewildered members followed after Shi Feng, trying to figure out what kind of means Shi Feng had that could fly their whole team to the Ghostfire Hills. After all, their team had over 120 people. It would take seven Flying Mounts just to transport their whole team simultaneously.

However, as Skyflare’s executives were whispering among themselves, Shi Feng opened the lid of a pouch hanging at his waist. The next moment, a metallic behemoth over 100 meters in length emerged from the pouch, thoroughly blocking out the sky above everyone.
