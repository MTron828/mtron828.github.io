Chapter 2867 - Promotion to Tier 5

Although Shi Feng had never tried to create a personalized Mana Body, he was very confident of success, now that he had grasped the basic use of Mana’s various elements and his Mana Body had reached a 120% Completion Rate.

After spending close to an hour inside the statue room, Shi Feng finished constructing a brand-new Mana Body. Simultaneously, the sound of a system notification entered his ears.

System: The strength of the constructed Mana Body is at 144% of your current Mana Body. It is not at the Tier 5 standard.

Shi Feng revealed a wry smile as he looked at the system notification. Sure enough, constructing a Tier 5 Mana Body isn’t easy. In his opinion, the new Mana Body he constructed was perfect. He had thoroughly implemented the basic properties of the various elements of Mana into his Mana Body. He had even built an Elemental Magic Array for each element, making it much easier to manipulate the ambient Mana.

Hence, he never thought that the strength of the new Mana Body would be at only 144% of his current Mana Body.

From what he heard in his previous life, the requirement for the constructed Tier 5 Mana Body would depend on the rank of the player’s existing Mana Body. The higher the rank, the lower the requirement.

Take the Gold Mana Body, for example. One would need to construct a Mana Body that was at least 300% stronger to meet the Tier 5 Mana Body standard.

On the other hand, a Bronze Mana Body’s owner would need to reach 500% to get promoted to Tier 5.

This was why expert players needed to secure the best Mana Body possible at Tier 3. This decision didn’t just relate to the strength of one’s Mana. It also served as a massive hurdle to reaching Tier 5.

If I didn’t meet the requirement even with 144%, it seems I’ll need to reach at least 200% to get promoted to Tier 5 with an Epic Mana Body.

After pondering for a moment, Shi Feng took out the Sword Saint’s Legacy he had obtained in the ancient God’s Domain. He then began accepting the Legacy Guidance in silence.

The Mana Body he constructed just now was already the limit of his current abilities.

In his opinion, there were three possible reasons behind his failure to meet the requirements.

The first was that his control over Mana was insufficient.

The second was that his understanding of Mana was insufficient.

The third was that his understanding of Mana Bodies was insufficient.

Shi Feng felt that his control over and understanding of Mana had already reached the limits of Tier 4. It should be impossible to improve on them any further. Not to mention, the Dragon phantom in the trial had praised his level and even stated that some Tier 5 Dragons might not be able to rival him in these two aspects.

Hence, these two aspects were unlikely to be his stumbling block.

In that case, the problem should lie with his poor understanding of Mana Bodies. Meanwhile, solving this problem was simple.

Previously, he had refrained from accepting the Sword Saint’s Legacy Guidance because he was afraid of wasting it. Back then, he felt that his foundation was still lacking and that he still needed to accumulate more strength. The stronger he became, the greater his harvest from the Legacy Guidance.

However, his foundation had now grown so sturdy that even Tier 5 Adult Dragons might not be a match for him. It was the perfect moment for him to accept the Sword Saint’s knowledge.

Following this, time passed rapidly inside the statue room. A flood of information kept pouring into Shi Feng’s mind. The more information he browsed through, the brighter his eyes became. Thanks to this information, many of his questions had gotten answered. He also grew increasingly mesmerized by the Sword Saint’s knowledge. After the Legacy Guidance was over, Shi Feng stared at the Ancient Beast Sculpture idly, his mind immersed in the knowledge he gained.

While Shi Feng quietly processed the Sword Saint’s Legacy Guidance, a commotion raged in Zero Wing’s Guild Cities.

Just a moment ago, Zero Wing had announced that it would open Zero Wing City to the public. All players could teleport to Zero Wing City via Sky Spring City and enter it from the Arctic Canyon.

Everyone who received this piece of news found it to be unbelievable.

“Awesome! This is great!”

“I heard that you could raise your training efficiency by several times inside Zero Wing City. I never thought that Zero Wing would open such an amazing place to the public.” “That’s not all of it. Did you see the levels of Zero Wing’s members? Not that long ago, I was at roughly the same level as their Tier 3 members. Now, they’re at least three levels above me. The grinding speed in the Arctic Canyon is simply ridiculous.”

Nowadays, no player on the eastern continent was unaware of Zero Wing City’s existence. However, as Zero Wing had reserved the city for its exclusive use, everyone not affiliated with the Guild could only watch in envy from the sidelines. Even the various superpowers were helpless against Zero Wing City.

Now that Zero Wing City is open to the public, how could they not feel excited?

Less than half an hour after Zero Wing’s announcement, practically every native player and player force on the eastern continent had found out about it.

Fire Wing Empire, Secret Pavilion’s headquarters: As the most well-informed transcendental organization in God’s Domain, the Secret Pavilion was one of the first Guilds to learn of Zero Wing City’s public opening. It had even found out detailed information, such as Zero Wing City’s entrance fee pricing and current player population. “Uncle Yuan, it seems Zero Wing finally plans on giving its all.” Purple Jade smiled as she read the detailed report in her hands. Looking at Yuan Tiexin, she said, “This development will probably make the eastern continent’s superpowers pretty anxious.”

At this time, Purple Jade’s aura had already undergone a massive transformation. Not only did she give off an otherworldly vibe, but she also exuded an indescribable feeling of sharpness. She was now a Level 153, Tier 4 Sword Emperor. The Mana she radiated even appeared somewhat misty. If Shi Feng were to see her now, he would be surprised.

“Zero Wing’s development has reached a bottleneck. If the War of Worlds did not take place, it might’ve been able to continue developing quietly for some time.” While sorting through the reports spread across his desk, Yuan Tiexin was slightly surprised when reading the news on Zero Wing. “However, now that the Outerworld players have intruded into the eastern continent, Zero Wing has to open Zero Wing City to acquire even more resources if it wants to make any further progress. However, it is also a risky move, given Zero Wing’s current state.

“I initially thought Zero Wing would maintain a low profile for a while longer; Black Flame’s opening the city as soon as he returned was beyond my expectations. I can’t help thinking that he is rushing things a little too much.”

Yuan Tiexin did not doubt that Shi Feng had opened Zero Wing City to the public because of the Outerworld players’ invasion. However, while doing so would allow Zero Wing City to develop rapidly, it would also turn the city into an eyesore.

The Outerworld superpowers were not as easy to deal with as the eastern continent’s native superpowers. Not to mention, the Outerworld superpowers definitely would not wish to see the remnant forces of the native superpowers they defeated flocking to Zero Wing’s banner and creating a colossal native power.

Previously, the Outerworld superpowers had refrained from targeting Zero Wing because the latter had always operated like a turtle, limiting its members’ activity to the vicinity of its strongholds. With Zero Wing’s Guild Cities’ and Mobile Fortress’s immense defensive capabilities, devouring the Guild was a very challenging proposition. The Guild Cities of other superpowers posed much easier targets.

However, now that Zero Wing had fully opened Zero Wing City to the public, even a fool could foretell the consequences of this action. With the city’s massive advantages, Zero Wing would become the strongest and largest Guild on the eastern continent. Moreover, it wouldn’t take long for this future to come to fruition.

Given this situation, although Zero Wing was a tough nut to crack, the Outerworld superpowers would still choose to annihilate Zero Wing first for the sake of their future.

However, unlike Yuan Tiexin, not only did Purple Jade not feel confused by this situation, but it had even ignited her fighting spirit. “Uncle Yuan, since you’re free right now, why don’t we go take a look at Zero Wing City? I’ve been thinking of visiting Guild Leader Black Flame. I’ve improved a lot after returning from that place, but I haven’t had a chance to test myself. I can use this chance to ask Guild Leader Black Flame for some guidance and see which one of us has made greater improvements during this period.”

After she returned from her training, nobody among the Secret Pavilion’s younger generation could match her. Since she had always set Shi Feng as her target, she was very curious to see whether she could now defeat him and become God’s Domain’s number one Swordsman.

“Alright. Since you wish to go, I’ll go with you.” Yuan Tiexin revealed a bitter smile as he took in Purple Jade’s spirited look. She had been restless ever since completing her training. However, he also felt that Shi Feng would be a good opponent for the current Purple Jade.

Afterward, Yuan Tiexin and Purple Jade departed the Secret Pavilion’s headquarters and teleported to Sky Spring City. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

While the eastern continent was in an uproar over Zero Wing City’s opening…

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion of Zero Wing City, Shi Feng’s eyes opened abruptly. Amazing! As expected of a complete Legacy Guidance from an ancient Sword Saint!

After processing the Sword Saint’s Legacy Guidance, Shi Feng finally understood what exactly a complete Legacy Guidance was. He also understood why Fire Dance would make such significant improvements after experiencing the Legacy Guidance.

The Legacy Guidance described the properties and usage methods of the various elements of Mana in detail and provided a comprehensive introduction to the components and basic applications of the Mana Body.

Although the information provided mainly targeted the Swordsman class, it was also beneficial to the other classes. This was especially true for the information on the Mana Body’s components. Of course, if one lacked a good understanding of the fundamental properties of Mana’s various elements, one would have difficulty understanding all of the information provided. Naturally, one’s improvements would also be limited. This was because all of the Mana Body’s basic applications mentioned in the Legacy Guidance required familiarity with the various elements of Mana. My previous considerations for the Mana Body were too arbitrary. Moreover, they were all modifications based on my existing Mana Body when the Tier 5 Mana Body is essentially something completely different.

When Shi Feng thought about the Mana Body he previously created, he couldn’t help laughing at his ignorance.

Why were Tier 5 entities so much more powerful than Tier 4 entities?

It was because Tier 5 existences possessed Life Ratings far superior to Tier 4 existences. The two couldn’t even be considered the same type of creature. Yet, he had foolishly tried to use his Tier 4 Mana Body as a base for his Tier 5 Mana Body. His idea was fundamentally flawed.

Another reason contributing to a Tier 5 existence’s strength was their powerful Mana. The Mana flowing within their bodies was no longer gaseous or misty; instead, it was liquid. Hence, when constructing a Tier 5 Mana Body, one had to liquefy their Mana.

If one couldn’t achieve such Mana, constructing a Tier 5 Mana Body would naturally be impossible.

After thinking up to this point, Shi Feng began his second attempt at constructing his Tier 5 Mana Body.

Liquefying one’s Mana might be incredibly difficult for others, but it wasn’t an impossible task for a Grandmaster Magician like Shi Feng. All he needed to do was integrate a magic array that condensed Mana within his Mana Body.

Moreover, he had even identified the magic array for this job.

The Twelve-array Magic World! The Twelve-array Magic World was an ancient magic array created by a Saint. Although its simplicity meant even Master Magicians could learn it, Shi Feng felt that this magic array was incredibly powerful, particularly its ability to improve the Mana affinity of those within its range. At the very least, such a feat was still beyond him even now.

Shi Feng began trying to integrate the Twelve-array Magic World with the Mana Body he constructed.

One failure…

Two failures…

Three failures…

Time passed rapidly as the number of failures piled up. After an unknown amount of time had gone by with success still nowhere in sight, Shi Feng began to doubt his plan’s feasibility. However, just when he considered giving up…

System: Congratulations! You have successfully constructed a new Mana Body. The constructed Mana Body’s strength is at 336% of your current Mana Body and has reached the Tier 5 standard. The created Mana Body is evaluated to be at the Epic rank. Do you wish to replace your current Mana Body with it and get promoted to Tier 5?

A Tier 5 Epic Mana Body?

Shi Feng was momentarily dumbfounded. He had known that so long as he succeeded, his personalized Mana Body wouldn’t be of low quality; it would reach the Gold rank at the very least. However, he never expected that integrating the Twelve-array Magic World into his Mana Body would yield such an astonishing result.

He immediately chose to replace his Mana Body without hesitation.

He had created this Mana Body out of sheer luck. If he tried re-creating it, he wouldn’t necessarily achieve a similar standard. Hence, he naturally had to accept it.
