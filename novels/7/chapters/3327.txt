“Black Flame? 963rd on the Luminous Glory List?” Markless Blade gasped when he heard Red Frost’s words. “Are you serious, Commander?”

The Seven Luminaries Lists held incredible prestige in the Greater God’s Domain. Even if Black Flame was only at the bottom of the Luminous Glory List, getting onto the list in and of itself was already a remarkable feat.

The Ten Great Paragons of a kingdom?

The Ten Great Geniuses of an empire?

These people were nothing compared to the people on the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Luminous Glory List.

According to rough statistics, there were easily over a thousand Realms in the Greater God’s Domain. On the other hand, the Luminous Glory List only recorded 1,000 players. In other words, an entire Realm might not even see one of its players being entered into the Luminous Glory List. However, so long as a player managed to get into the Luminous Glory List, it would mean that they already stood at the apex of Tier 4 players in their Realm.

“Of course. This is insider information that I received,” Red Frost said definitively. “It shouldn’t take more than a week before the Seven Luminaries Alliance announces the change to the Luminous Glory List.”

“Hahaha!” Markless Blade couldn’t help but laugh out loud when he heard Red Frost’s affirmation. “963rd on the Luminous Glory List! With this, I can tell others that I once engaged an expert on the Luminous Glory List in an intense battle!”

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that none of the Starlight Realm’s Tier 4 players had ever considered entering the Luminous Glory List one day. Even the various conglomerates’ core paragons would, at most, set the top 10 of the Starlight Realm’s Hundred Nations Paragon Battle as their ultimate goal at Tier 4.

Originally, Markless Blade still bore some hatred for Black Flame. Now, though, he only felt joy from being defeated by Black Flame.

It should be known even the opportunity to spectate an expert on the Luminous Glory List fight was incredibly rare and valuable. The opportunity was so precious that not even the executives of ordinary corporations could get their hands on a ticket. Only conglomerates could get their hands on a few tickets.

Yet, now, it was revealed that he had fought an expert on the Luminous Glory List. This was an opportunity even conglomerates would have great difficulty acquiring.

“Can you show some dignity?” Red Frost couldn’t help but roll her eyes at Markless Blade.

Contrasting Red Frost’s reaction, the other vice commanders present couldn’t help but look at Markless Blade enviously.

“How lucky can you get, Brother Markless? You actually got to fight such an expert in his early days.”

“Damn! Why didn’t I take part in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition?”

“Brother Markless, tell us about Black Flame! How are his combat standards?”

For a time, the various vice commanders eagerly asked Markless Blade questions, none caring about their dignity or the look of contempt Red Frost was giving them.

From their perspectives, experts on the Luminous Glory List were akin to characters from fairy tales. If they could learn even a little bit of information about these characters, they might receive some inspiration for their own development.

While the various vice commanders were busy asking for Black Flame’s information, Red Frost walked up to the podium, her reappearance instantly silencing the noisy crowd in the arena.

“As you’ve seen, Vice Commander Qilin has been defeated,” Red Frost said as she glanced at Chen Qilin, who was in the middle of removing his simulation device. Then, she continued, “As I’ve previously stated, whoever can last ten moves will pass. But now that Shi Feng has defeated Vice Commander Qilin, Shi Feng will take Chen Qilin’s place as a vice commander in the Star Lake Legion from now on. Of course, if any of you can similarly defeat a vice commander, you will enjoy the same treatment!”

As soon as Red Frost finished speaking, the entire arena went into an uproar.

“What?! Is Commander Red Frost for real?!”

“Does this mean Vice Commander Qilin didn’t get defeated on purpose?”

“This is wonderful! Hurry up and continue with the test! I’m going to challenge those other vice commanders!”

…

For a time, the people in the arena were filled with surprise and worry. Though, the majority of them couldn’t help but be excited by Red Frost’s announcement.

If it were in the past, they’d have to meet incredibly stringent requirements if they wanted to become a vice commander in the Star Lake Legion. Firstly, they needed to reach the two-star mental strength grandmaster standard. Secondly, they needed to make sufficient contributions to the legion.

Now, though, all they needed to do was defeat a vice commander. The difficulty of becoming a vice commander had undoubtedly been reduced significantly, and this gave everyone hope that they, too, could become a vice commander. Only…

After nearly a day of continuous simulation warfare, those who aspired to become vice commanders had fallen into despair. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Out of the 10,000-plus people in the arena, nobody other than Shi Feng managed to defeat a vice commander. In fact, no more than 100 people managed to last ten moves against the legion’s vice commanders.

This situation taught everyone that Shi Feng’s victory wasn’t due to luck. It also wasn’t because Chen Qilin was weak. Instead, it was because Shi Feng was too strong.

Aside from Shi Feng, the women going by the names of Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul were also ridiculously strong. Both women had lasted over 30 moves against a vice commander, their achievements instantly granting them the qualifications to join an ace battle group.

Upon seeing the achievements of Shi Feng, Gentle Snow, and Hidden Soul, everyone couldn’t help but wonder what kind of Guild Zero Wing was exactly.

Zero Wing only had three people partaking in the enrollment test. Yet, out of these three people, two had become ace battle group members and one had become a vice commander. The achievements of Zero Wing’s members had shattered everyone’s understanding of the enrollment test.

In addition, one other shocking matter occurred after the enrollment test. More specifically, this matter was related to the various foreign powers which had come to Star Lake City to poach Gentle Snow.

Once the enrollment test ended, these powers had seemingly forgotten their original intentions of recruiting Gentle Snow as none of them attempted to approach her. Instead, the representatives of these powers all approached Shi Feng to congratulate him. They also openly expressed that so long as Shi Feng was willing to become a vice commander in their respective city’s legion, they could ensure him the position of commander within three to five years.

Since the founding of Star Lake City, this was definitely the first time a rookie from Star Lake City was made such a lucrative offer.

However, when these recruiters met with Red Frost’s smiling expression, they promptly dispersed and stopped pestering Shi Feng.

Nighttime, God’s Domain Association:

Thousand Scars and Death Omen carefully entered a conference room on the 600th floor. When they entered, two people were already seated in the room that was the size of a basketball court. Of these two people, one was a man, while the other was a woman. Both these people looked young, so young that even Thousand Scars could not help but envy their youth.

In reality, these two people were already around the age of 26. They were much older than Thousand Scars, who was only 19 this year. However, both of them were two-star mental strength grandmasters. Moreover, they were already at the limits of the two-star grandmaster standard and were only half a step away from becoming three-star mental strength grandmasters!

Despite being incredibly talented, even Thousand Scars couldn’t help but envy these two people.

In the Greater World, one would be publicly acknowledged as a genius if they became a one-star mental strength grandmaster before 30. If they could reach this standard before 25, their names could be entered into the history books of Star Lake City, as only a few such people had ever emerged from the city.

As for reaching the limits of the two-star mental strength grandmaster standard around the age of 26, no such existence had ever emerged from Star Lake City.

Even if the scope was expanded to cover the several dozen third-tier cities neighboring Star Lake City and the second-tier city governing these third-tier cities, such geniuses were few and far between.

An ordinary two-star grandmaster might look to be on the same level as someone who was at the limits of the two-star grandmaster standard, but the two were no longer existences on the same level.

Most people were under the impression that there was only a simple one-level gap between two-star and three-star mental strength grandmasters. However, for conglomerates and upper-ranking hegemonic powers, they knew that the two were two entirely different creatures. Hence, it was incredibly difficult to cross the threshold of three-star mental strength grandmasters, and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the chances of a two-star grandmaster succeeding were less than one in ten thousand.

Meanwhile, a person who had reached the limits of the two-star mental strength grandmaster had already taken half a step into the realm of three-star mental strength grandmasters, and it was only a matter of time before they crossed the threshold completely.

Moreover, out of these two people, Thousand Scars was incredibly familiar with the woman. This was because she had met this woman in the World Passage, and the woman’s name was none other than White Owl!
