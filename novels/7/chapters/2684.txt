Chapter 2685 – Generous Remuneration, Tier 4 Promotion Quest

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, the female Cursemancer and the other Frost Heaven members inside the room promptly snapped out of their dazes, all the contempt they previously had for Zero Wing swept away.

The number of peak experts Zero Wing currently had was indeed no match for the various superpowers. However, with Shi Feng’s Mana Domain, he could boost a team’s combat power by a significant margin. Moreover, if a superpower did not have any means of dealing with a Mana Domain, it wouldn’t matter how many Tier 3 experts they sent at Shi Feng. Every one of them would just end up as cannon fodder.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you really are a straightforward person. In that case, let me introduce myself first. I am Muxin, a Vice Guild Leader of Frost Heaven, and I am here on behalf of the Guild to invite Zero Wing to join Frost Heaven’s alliance,” Muxin said, looking at Shi Feng.

“Your alliance?” Shi Feng looked at Muxin with some confusion.

As far as he remembered, Frost Heaven had always walked the path of a lone wolf, never forming alliances with others.

“That’s right. You can consider it an alliance targeting the Faux Saint monsters,” Muxin explained, nodding. “So long as Zero Wing joins the alliance, not only will we attack and defend against the Faux Saint monsters together, but we will also share plenty of information with Zero Wing, especially information related to the Faux Saint monsters’ activities. This way, if the Faux Saint monsters try to conduct any large-scale operations, we will be prepared for them.”

“What are the entry requirements?” Shi Feng asked.

For the current Zero Wing, the offer of help in attacking and defending against the Faux Saint monsters wasn’t particularly important. However, information regarding the Faux Saint monsters’ activities was something that interested him greatly. Although Zero Wing’s members could collect plenty of information regarding the Faux Saint monsters’ movements, the scope of that information would drastically pale in comparison to what several superpowers working together could obtain.

With such information, he would have a better grasp of the Faux Saint monsters’ movements and could have Zero Wing make preparations ahead of time. After all, the problem of the Faux Saint monsters wasn’t something that could be dealt with in the short term. In fact, these monsters would remain a big problem for Zero Wing far into the future.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you’re overthinking things. There are no conditions for joining the alliance,” Muxin said, a faint smile appearing on her face. “If I have to give one, then it is receiving Frost Heaven’s recognition.”

“Does that mean Zero Wing has received this recognition already?” Shi Feng asked curiously. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Of course. Moreover, aside from inviting Zero Wing into the alliance, I also wish to extend an invitation to Zero Wing to take part in a secret operation our alliance is planning,” Muxin said earnestly.

“Secret operation? Is it compulsory to join?” Shi Feng asked when he noticed a hint of excitement on Muxin’s face.

“It’s not compulsory, but if Zero Wing is willing to help, I can personally provide you with a generous remuneration. For example, I can give you 50 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid, something that the various superpowers are currently in urgent need of,” Muxin said.

The other Frost Heaven members standing beside Muxin turned to her in shock.

“Muxin, what are you thinking?! That’s an absolute secret! Even within the alliance, only two other Guilds have the qualifications to take part! If you invite Zero Wing, even if the Grand Elders agree, the other two Guilds will most likely have strong opinions about it!” the female Cursemancer murmured to Muxin.

The female Cursemancer wasn’t particularly surprised that Muxin had agreed to Zero Wing’s joining the alliance. After all, with Silverwing City’s benefits and Shi Feng’s Mana Domain, Zero Wing indeed possessed the qualifications to do so.

However, inviting Zero Wing to participate in the alliance’s secret operation was a completely different story.

The secret operation Muxin referred to was extraordinary. Frost Heaven and the two other superpowers involved in this operation had paid an enormous price to secure this opportunity. Muxin was simply insane to invite Zero Wing along.

“Relax. I’ll just say that Zero Wing’s participation will be taken from my share. That way, the two other superpowers should not have any problems,” Muxin replied nonchalantly.

“You have truly lost your mind! You asked for this! It’s your problem if Uncle Hong and the others get angry at you!” the female Cursemancer said in a huff.

As the heiress of the Boulder Corporation, one of the three main corporations supporting Frost Heaven, Muxin indeed possessed a considerable number of participation slots for the upcoming operation. However, if Muxin gave these slots to Zero Wing’s members, Frost Heaven’s Guild Leader and Grand Elders would definitely have opinions about it. In fact, if Zero Wing’s participation adversely affected the operation, the Boulder Corporation’s standing within Frost Heaven might even suffer.

Meanwhile, seeing that the female Cursemancer had stopped speaking, Muxin returned her gaze to Shi Feng.

“What do you think of this, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Muxin asked once more.

“Will we receive the 50 bottles only if the operation succeeds?” Shi Feng asked after giving the matter some thought.

He had a great yearning for S-rank Nutrient Fluids. Setting aside his own needs, he also needed plenty of S-rank Nutrient Fluids for the development of Zero Wing’s core upper echelon. Unlike the various superpowers, Zero Wing did not have a major corporation backing it, so the Guild had a much more difficult time obtaining S-rank Nutrient Fluids.

He had to admit that Muxin had accurately grasped Zero Wing’s weakness.

“Of course not. The 50 bottles are a deposit. If the operation is a success, I will pay you an additional 50 bottles,” Muxin replied, her smile widening at Shi Feng’s question.

“Alright. I accept your invitation on behalf of Zero Wing,” Shi Feng said. When he heard that the remuneration was 100 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids, he agreed to the offer without hesitation. “When will this secret operation take place? And how many players do I need to send?”

“I can’t give you an exact time yet, but judging by the current development, the operation will need a minimum of 11 or 12 days before it can start. As for the numbers, it’s best if you bring no more than ten players,” Muxin replied after giving the matter some thought. She then pointed at the female Cursemancer beside her and continued, “Once the preparations on our side are done, I’ll have Lixuan notify you.”

“Very well. I will make all the necessary preparations beforehand,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

After Shi Feng agreed to Muxin’s invitation, the two of them formally signed a contract. Before the start of the secret operation, Muxin would supply Zero Wing with 50 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid first. And so long as the operation was a success, Muxin would send another 50 bottles within two days of the operation’s completion.

“Guild Leader, do you really intend to take part in Frost Heaven’s secret operation?” Youlan asked worriedly after Muxin’s group left the reception room. “The fact that Frost Heaven is willing to offer 100 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid as remuneration just goes to show how difficult this secret operation is. In fact, the operation might even come with great risks. If something untoward happens, Starlink and Saint’s Hand will pounce on this opportunity.”

Now that Silverwing Town had been promoted into Silverwing City, the number of players and powers operating in Silverwing City was continuously increasing. According to their current estimates, they could easily make over 300,000 Gold per day from the entrance fees alone. After deducting the various expenditures of the city, they should still net over 100,000 Gold—and this didn’t even take into account the income from the Transportation Firm.

To put it simply, they had no need to take any risks. They were more than capable of amassing enough money to purchase a large amount of S-rank Nutrient Fluids, given some time.

“I understand, but we’ll also need to live long enough to make that kind of money,” Shi Feng replied with a bitter smile.

If possible, he would prefer to refuse Muxin’s offer as well. After all, S-rank Nutrient Fluids were not common goods that were readily available. Even for Frost Heaven, S-rank Nutrient Fluids were an extremely precious resource. The fact that Muxin was willing to pay such a hefty price for Zero Wing’s help meant that the secret operation in question was incredibly difficult.

However, 100 bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid would alleviate a significant portion of the pressure on Zero Wing. Not to mention, now that his identity had been exposed, purchasing S-rank Nutrient Fluids would become even more problematic than before.

After Shi Feng finished conversing with Youlan and had assigned all the necessary work in Silverwing City, he stealthily made his way to the core room located on the City Lord’s Mansion’s second underground floor. He then took out a tattered scroll from his bag.

Although I haven’t made all possible preparations, in order to ensure the success of my future operations, I have no choice but to get promoted as soon as possible.

Gritting his teeth, Shi Feng unfurled the Legacy Scroll he obtained from the Ancient Lich Zorok and chanted the incantation recorded on it.
