Chapter 571 – Golden Kingdom

“A Superior Demigod?!”

“Crap! A Superior Demigod appeared?!”

Following the crystal’s announcement, everyone waiting in the hall turned their heads toward Shi Feng, their gazes filled with astonishment and envy.

There were vast differences between the three locations players could teleport to via the Eternal Temple. Although each was more dangerous than the previous, the rewards players could obtain from the more dangerous locations were many times better. It was especially so for the inland region. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the players who visited the inland region would return as a completely different person.

“Superior Demigod?”

“Isn’t he only ranked 11th on the Sacred Glory List?”

The Blaze Conglomerate’s youths were in disbelief as they looked at Shi Feng and his nonchalant expression.

They had met some of the Sacred Glory List’s top ten powerhouses before. However, ever since they returned from their first visit to the Forbidden Zone, they were confident that, aside from the Sacred Glory List’s top two, they could defeat and possibly even kill any of the other Sacred Glory List’s top ten experts.

Hence, in their eyes, the so-called experts who ranked outside of the Sacred Glory List’s top ten were nothing more than a joke.

Yet, now, Shi Feng was rated as a Superior Demigod?

Had the Sacred Glory List undergone a revision while they weren’t paying attention? Since when did the Sacred Glory List hold so much value?

How interesting. No wonder the old man has such high praises for him, Billowing Water thought as she looked at Shi Feng, her eyes revealing intentions to challenge Shi Feng to a fight. Subsequently, she stepped into the magic array before the assessment crystal.

A moment later, another repeating mechanical sound resounded in the temple hall.

“Assessment: Superior Demigod. You may head to the inland region.”

The announcement caused the people in the hall to turn their heads and stir once more. Even the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s experts tasked with maintaining security in the hall couldn’t help but take an extra look at Shi Feng and Billowing Water.

Normally, they would only see one Superior Demigod appearing for every few batches of players they teleported. Yet, not only did two Superior Demigods appear in this batch, but both even belonged to the same team. Even the various pseudo-apex powers’ expert teams couldn’t necessarily match such a line-up.

It seems she has already mastered the Formless Twilight, Shi Feng concluded when he heard the strength rating Billowing Water was given. At the same time, he, too, got the urge to spar with Billowing Water.

Because he was constantly chased by Demon’s Gate in his previous life, he never had the opportunity to challenge the Greater God’s Domain’s publicly acknowledged Ten Great Sword Gods, and it became one of his regrets.

Although Wordless Ember was also one of the Ten Great Sword Gods, the current Wordless Ember had yet to fully develop. He hadn’t even obtained his own Divine Artifact yet, so Shi Feng saw no meaning in challenging him.

Billowing Water, on the other hand, had not only acquired the Formless Twilight already, but she had even become proficient at wielding it already. Even if she wasn’t at her peak, she would still be a worthy opponent to hone his sword techniques against.

His Sword’s Orbit was only one step away from reaching the Gold Combat Technique standard. Unfortunately, he didn’t have any ideas on achieving a breakthrough. In such a situation, if he encountered an expert with comparable Basic Attributes who had already mastered a complete set of Gold Combat Techniques in the future, he would be at a considerable disadvantage.

However, Shi Feng quickly suppressed his urges.

While it was indeed important to improve his sword techniques, it was even more important that he entered the Forbidden Zone to search for a World Fragment.

“We have 200 people now. Everyone, gather at the teleportation array!”

Amidst Shi Feng’s brief contemplation, the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s guard captain suddenly shouted. And upon hearing the guard captain’s words, the players waiting in the hall started gathering toward the teleportation array in the hall.

In no time, 200 players stood within the ancient teleportation array situated in the middle of the hall. Seeing this, the guard captain took out a couple dozen Seven Luminaries Crystals and embedded them into the teleportation array, causing the dense mana in the hall to form a complete mana circuit.

“Before I send you off, let me remind you all that the Forbidden Zone is not human territory. If you die there, you will be resurrected in an NPC City on our side after one day. As for how long you can stay there and what you can obtain, it all depends on your abilities. However, I advise you not to be too greedy. What matters most is that you return alive since, should you die, you won’t be able to bring back any of your precious harvests.”

After the guard captain finished speaking, everyone felt their vision blurring, and the scenery before them underwent a drastic change.

…

In a secluded canyon on the Western Continent…

When Shi Feng and Billowing Water recovered their vision, they found themselves standing in the middle of a humble town enveloped in a faint golden barrier.

“Newcomers!”

“Look! We have newcomers!”

“No way! We really have newcomers?! Quick, notify the party leader!”

When the players setting up stalls along the town’s main street saw a sudden brilliance falling on the town, and two people emerged from said brilliance, excitement filled their eyes, and they behaved as if they had just seen a priceless treasure.

So, this is the Western Continent’s inland region?

Shi Feng couldn’t help but be astonished as he observed his surroundings. Although he had long learned about the Western Continent’s situation in his previous life, he still couldn’t help but be shocked after arriving here in person.

Eternal Energy!

Although various kinds of energy were present in his surroundings, the Eternal Energy here was so dense that it nearly rivaled the Hundred Refinement Building’s first floor.

It should be known that players could only enter the Hundred Refinement Building’s first floor once in their lifetimes. They wouldn’t get a second chance even if they started a new account. Moreover, they could only experience the first floor’s environment for five short days.

In contrast, even though the density of the Eternal Energy present on the Western Continent was slightly lower than that of the Hundred Refinement Building’s first floor, players could stay in this environment for as long as they wanted. They could enjoy a constant flow of inspiration simply by standing and breathing here, and they would not have to worry about lacking directions to develop themselves.

If a player could live in this environment for a long period, they would have no trouble getting promoted to Tier 6.

Another matter that surprised Shi Feng was that a human town existed in the middle of the Western Continent, which was completely occupied by the Holy Race. Although the town was tiny, being only one-fifth the size of the average Basic Town, it was still a bona fide human town. With the town’s circumstances, its value easily exceeded that of the Crystal City of Secrets.

The Seven Luminaries Alliance truly is insane… To think they would bring even the Golden Kingdom here… When Shi Feng saw the faint golden barrier that covered the entire town, he couldn’t help but admire the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s wealth.

The Divine Artifact Golden Kingdom!

The Golden Kingdom was the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s ultimate defensive trump card. While the Golden Kingdom was only a magic item and not a weapon or a piece of equipment, it was one of the few defensive magic barriers capable of withstanding an attack from a Primordial God.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that so long as a settlement was protected by the Golden Kingdom, so long as the Golden Kingdom had enough energy, the town would be impregnable. The only downside was that the Golden Kingdom couldn’t be moved for a year once it was set up. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

During Shi Feng’s previous life, the Seven Luminaries Alliance had relied on the Golden Kingdom to defend a fortress against the Holy Race’s invasion. At the time, the Holy Race’s various powers had joined forces to attack said fortress. Yet, even after besieging the fortress for over a year and permanently sacrificing hundreds of thousands of Tier 6 experts, the Holy Race still failed to capture the fortress. That battle had become an eternal legend in the Greater God’s Domain.

Now that the Seven Luminaries Alliance had used the Golden Kingdom to secure a safe haven for itself on the Western Continent, even if other human powers established their own settlements on the Western Continent in the future, none would be able to compare to the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s town in terms of safety.

However, compared to all these things, what surprised Shi Feng the most were the hundreds of players that occupied the town. Even though these players were only at Tier 5, the strength of the mana they exuded was superior to that of actual Tier 6 players. Some of them even had mana rivaling Tier 6 Gods…
