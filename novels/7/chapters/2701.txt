Chapter 2702 – Silence

“Alien?”

Shi Feng failed to comprehend Liang Jing’s words for a moment.

As his assistant, Liang Jing didn’t just take care of affairs in Zero Wing’s headquarters. Normally, she would also help Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose with tasks in God’s Domain. Hence, she had frequent contact with the two Vice Guild Leaders. In fact, Liang Jing should be even more familiar with them than he was.

Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose had been absent from the Guild for only some weeks. No matter how he looked at it, Liang Jing shouldn’t have a reason to describe them as alien.

“Are you saying that their temperament has changed?” Shi Feng asked after giving the matter some thought. A person’s temperament would change along with the improvement of their knowledge and mental state, especially after a breakthrough in the limit of their brain activity. Shi Feng was a perfect example of this.

“No.” Shaking her head, Liang Jing whispered in a somewhat uncomfortable voice, “That kind of...feeling... It’s like looking at complete strangers wearing their faces...”

“Wearing their faces?” Liang Jing’s words surprised Shi Feng. “Are you sure?” “Mhm, I’m very sure!” Liang Jing said earnestly.

“Okay.” Shi Feng nodded solemnly. “This matter ends here. Just treat them like you normally do.”

“Guild Leader, are the Vice Guild Leaders alright?” Liang Jing asked worriedly.

No matter how she looked at it, this change simply wasn’t normal. If Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose really had a problem, Zero Wing would be in great danger. After all, the two Vice Guild Leaders were responsible for most of the Guild’s daily activities, whereas Shi Feng was mainly a figurehead.

“I’m not sure yet.” Shi Feng shook his head. “I’m afraid I’ll know what’s going on only after I meet with them in person.”

Space-time mazes were very special existences in God’s Domain. Only an extremely small number of players would encounter a space-time maze when traveling through space-time passages. An even smaller number of players would encounter a mysterious space after leaving the space-time maze.

This mysterious space was unresolvable; many people attributed its appearance to a bug in the game.

Every player that entered this mysterious space would end up in a very special world. Nobody knew what kind of world it was, and only one thing existed in this world.

Slaughter!

One would either be hunted down endlessly!

Or hunt others endlessly!

Or fight on an endless battlefield!

It was as if the fragments of countless memories in God’s Domain were collected in this special world.

Even when players were killed in this world, they wouldn’t truly die. They would only go from one dream to another after their deaths, and this cycle would loop endlessly. Moreover, the pain players felt in this world wasn’t mitigated in the slightest.

The concept of time in this world was supposedly blurred.

The time players experienced inside this world was something only their minds perceived, with no effect on their real bodies. Hence, even when a player spent one or five years inside this special world, only hours or days might have passed in the real world. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, time was the scariest thing in existence. After all, time could wear down everything, let alone humans.

If Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose really came out from this mysterious space, a lot of time must’ve passed for them already, so much so that even their memories had blurred. Hence, it was only normal for them to change.

The only thing Shi Feng didn’t know was how many years Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose had spent in that mysterious space.

Meanwhile, according to the statistics from his previous life, the longer the time one spent in that special world, the greater the influence on one’s mentality.

Zero Wing Residence’s top-floor conference room:

Zero Wing’s upper echelon and core team leaders were currently seated inside this magnificent conference room. Of these people, even the weakest was a Level 116, Tier 3 player, while the strongest were Violet Cloud and Fire Dance, who had both reached Level 121 already. However, there was still a significant gap between them and Shi Feng, who was Level 125.

Fire Dance had already replaced her old gear with a set of dark-red leather armor. Based on the magic patterns etched into her armor, the armor was a set. Moreover, it even gave off the glow effect unique to Epic items. Fire Dance also had her hair tied up with a ribbon that resembled the starry sky. The ribbon gave her an indescribable sense of fierceness as if she were the empress of the night sky.

It seems Fire Dance also reaped a considerable harvest in the space-time maze. Shi Feng was slightly surprised at the dagger hanging by Fire Dance’s waist.

Not only did the dagger exude a faint sense of hostility, but it even roiled the ambient Mana. If this dagger were unsheathed, he couldn’t even begin to imagine the impact it would have on the environment.

Even Fragmented Legendary items paled in comparison to this dagger.

However, when Shi Feng swept his gaze across Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose, who sat on both sides of the conference table, he was taken aback.

How can this be? Shi Feng was rendered speechless.

After what Liang Jing had said, he had already mentally prepared himself for the worst.

However, now that he saw them in person, he realized that the two’s situation exceeded his worst expectations.

Gentle Snow’s and Aqua Rose’s weapons and equipment remained the same as when they left the western continent. Even their levels were still at Level 117. However, the feeling the two gave off was utterly different.

Gentle Snow had been rather aloof in the past but still relatively sociable. On the other hand, Aqua Rose had been a cheerful and assertive woman, and her eyes had always sparkled with wisdom and ambition.

Now, however, the two of them could no longer be considered human.Neither of them exuded the slightest hint of emotion as if they were plants; they did not appear happy or sad. Although they were currently communicating with the others around them, their voices did not fluctuate with any emotion whatsoever.

The only thing Shi Feng could sense from the two was a deathly silence, although the feeling of silence each gave off was slightly different.

In the case of Gentle Snow, her silence resembled bones piled atop a battlefield. In the case of Aqua Rose, her silence was like a candle flame in the dark, carrying both death and hope.

Besides Shi Feng, everyone else inside the room also sensed the changes in Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose. If not for the Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose they retained in their memories, everyone might’ve even had the urge to flee the scene immediately.

“Guild Leader, did something happen to the two Vice Guild Leaders?” Youlan asked Shi Feng through a whisper.

The change to Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose might not be noteworthy for those unfamiliar with them. But for those who were, this change was simply terrifying and creepy.

“Given how they are now, it seems something must’ve happened,” Shi Feng answered, not hiding the truth. After all, this was obvious to everyone present. During the time Zero Wing’s members were secretly discussing Gentle Snow’s and Aqua Rose’s changes, Shi Feng also shifted his gaze to the two of them.

“How long did you two live in that world?” Shi Feng asked them through a whisper.
