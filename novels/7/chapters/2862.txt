Chapter 2863 - Peerless Overlord

World Creation?! How is this possible?!

Sixteenth Cloud gaped in shock when she saw the magic barrier disappear and the pressure weighing down her body vanished. She simply couldn’t bring herself to believe this situation.

Even acquiring a Mana Domain was already tough for Tier 4 players; anyone who managed to do so would become an absolute powerhouse among Tier 4 existences.

Meanwhile, World Creation was something even Tier 5 existences had difficulty achieving.

Anyone who reached the World Creation standard could create a small world of their own, which was much more powerful than a barrier created using a magic array. It was akin to a passive, large-scale magic barrier.

What was even more amazing was that the owner of this small world could isolate enemies from the ambient Mana. So long as the trapped enemies had yet to reach Tier 5 or the World Creation standard or did not possess Fragmented Legendary items capable of countering a World Creation Mana Domain, resisting the owner of the small world was impossible.

In front of a World Creation expert, Tier 4 experts were hardly any different from Tier 2 and Tier 3 players; they just had stronger Basic Attributes and physiques.

Let alone Sixteenth Cloud, even Awakened Abyss and Jade Leaf were stunned by this situation.

“How can he be at the World Creation level already?! Isn’t he just a native?!”

Awakened Abyss couldn’t believe his eyes as he looked at Shi Feng. Even in the God’s Domain they came from, only experts standing at the apex of the world had reached the World Creation standard-all of them old monsters belonging to the few transcendental powers.

However, Shi Feng’s appearance indicated he was only 30, at most. Moreover, the God’s Domain he lived in was not only sparse in Mana but also lacking in Legacies. No matter how Awakened Abyss looked at it, there was no way anyone in this God’s Domain could achieve such strength at this stage of the game.

“So, this is his hidden strength?” Jade Leaf was horrified by this revelation.

Previously, when Windshadow told her that Shi Feng was still hiding a lot of his strength and that they needed to be careful around him, she hadn’t thought much of his warning. She had reminded Awakened Abyss to avoid clashing with Shi Feng simply because she did not want to disobey Windshadow’s orders.

However, after Shi Feng revealed his hidden strength, Jade Leaf found him much scarier than even Windshadow’s predictions.

The next moment, before Quasi Eagle and the other mercenaries could snap out of their daze, Shi Feng’s Light of Two Worlds swung toward them.

Tier 4 Skill, Lightning Edge!

Countless sword lights descended from the sky, creating a mesmerizing river of light.

Quasi Eagle and the other mercenaries indeed possessed combat power at the Tier 4 standard. Moreover, even the weakest Tier 3 expert among them was at the Refinement Realm standard. However, since they couldn’t tap the ambient Mana, none of the defensive maneuvers and Lifesaving skills they used could withstand Shi Feng’s attack.

As a result, apart from Quasi Eagle and a Tier 4 Elementalist, both of whom had broken through the 100% threshold of their Mana Bodies, everyone else lost their lives to the sword lights.

When the river of light disappeared, a ravine dozens of meters deep and nearly a thousand meters long had formed in the forested region, with weapons and equipment strewn inside it.

How is this possible?!

Quasi Eagle, who had survived thanks to a Tier 4 Defensive Skill, was stupefied when he saw most of his team of more than 100 Tier 4 combatants wiped out.

When he and the surviving Elementalist looked at Shi Feng again, they shuddered involuntarily, horror swamping their hearts. The two of them finally understood that what Shi Feng had said earlier was true. From start to end, their team had merely been a bunch of clowns. They arrogantly thought of Shi Feng’s group as sheep for the slaughter, not knowing that they themselves were the actual sheep.

World Creation… No wonder Awakened Abyss conceded without hesitation… Quasi Eagle smiled bitterly as he looked at Shi Feng.

The loss of levels was a small matter for Tier 4 players like them. However, the loss of weapons and equipment wasn’t something that they could recover from easily.

“Boss, what should we do?” the Level 144, Tier 4 male Elementalist asked Quasi Eagle in a panic. “There’s no way we can get away from him inside this small world. We also can’t fly inside the Demon Mist Valley.”

Once a World Creation expert unleashed their Mana Domain, escape was impossibleespecially for players like themselves.

At the Elementalist’s question, Quasi Eagle gritted his teeth and said to Shi Feng, “Friend, my brother and I surrender. We are willing to compensate you with two pieces of top-tier Epic Equipment for each of us. What do you think?”

Quasi Eagle’s proposal surprised Awakened Abyss and the other Hundred Ghosts members.

The commander of the Wild Hunt mercenary group was considered above average among the Tier 4 experts in their God’s Domain. For him to actually bow down to another was simply unbelievable.

Quasi Eagle was known to be a ruthless person in their God’s Domain.

He had once gone up against a Guild all by himself. Despite getting killed more than a dozen times, he still did not give up clashing with the Guild. Eventually, the Guild in question suffered a major loss in a Guild war. And with Quasi Eagle incessantly targeting the Guild’s experts, the Guild had no choice but to concede and provide all sorts of compensation to Quasi Eagle to put this feud to rest.

This incident had spurred Quasi Eagle’s rise to fame. He had then gone on to establish the present Wild Hunt mercenary group, which had a reputation as a pack of mad dogs in their God’s Domain.

Yet, Quasi Eagle was actually taking the initiative to admit defeat after suffering such a small setback. How could Awakened Abyss and the others not find this situation surprising?

Unfortunately, Shi Feng showed no interest whatsoever in Quasi Eagle’s proposal. “Three pieces! We’ll pay three pieces of Epic Equipment each!” Quasi Eagle said, gritting his teeth. “Even if you kill us, the most we will drop is two items each. Top-tier Epic Equipment is rare even in the present God’s Domain. This is definitely a worthwhile transaction for you!”

Normally, Quasi Eagle wouldn’t have minded getting killed.

However, he currently had a precious treasure on his person, and it had a certain chance of dropping upon death.

It was precisely thanks to this treasure that he had managed to break through his Mana Body’s 100% threshold. Meanwhile, this was only the tip of the iceberg of what this treasure had to offer.

Although he didn’t know what exactly this treasure was, since it had such an ability, it was definitely more valuable than even Fragmented Legendary items. He naturally wouldn’t dare bet on the chance that it wouldn’t drop. Hence, he endured the humiliation of surrendering.

However, before Quasi Eagle could finish speaking, Shi Feng had already slashed out with the Abyssal Blade.

First Sword, Lightshadow!

“You lunatic!”

When Quasi Eagle and the Elementalist saw the towering greatsword descending toward them, they promptly activated another Lifesaving Skill. The two of them then fled in different directions, neither daring to receive the descending greatsword.

They could clearly sense the frightening power the illusory greatsword carried. This attack was most likely much stronger than even that of Superior Mythic monsters. Receiving it would be suicide.

One slash… Two slashes… Three slashes… As Quasi Eagle and the Tier 4 Elementalist used up one Lifesaving Skill after another, Shi Feng executed Lightshadow time and again. After five consecutive slashes, Quasi Eagle and the Elementalist finally fell to the illusory greatsword and transformed into ashes, each of them dropping two items as they died.

This scene rendered Awakened Abyss and Jade Leaf speechless for a long time.

So, this is the power of World Creation? Sixteenth Cloud similarly found herself at a loss for words when she saw Quasi Eagle getting killed in just a few moves.

Her party of three had previously clashed with the mercenary commander. Despite the three of them working together to fight him, they were still at a disadvantage. Yet, Shi Feng had overwhelmed Quasi Eagle and another Tier 4 expert, who had also broken through the 100% threshold of his Mana Body, so much that the two couldn’t even retaliate.

Afterward, Shi Feng collected the loot from Wild Hunt, then glanced at Hundred Ghosts’s group. Awakened Abyss and the dozen or so Tier 4 experts around him shuddered involuntarily. A few of them even stumbled two steps back.

Shi Feng turned to Sixteenth Cloud and the others.

“Let’s go.”

Leaving behind the petrified members of Hundred Ghosts, Shi Feng led Sixteenth Cloud and the others straight out of the Demon Mist Valley.
