Chapter 411 – Eternal Stone

“Boss?”

Ghost Hand’s subordinates fell into a daze when they saw him collapse.

In addition to being one of the few fifth-floor experts among the Dragon Mountain Realm’s younger generation, Ghost Hand was one of the few budding experts who could hold his ground against older generation fifth-floor experts.

Yet, now, Ghost Hand was killed by Shi Feng in one move?

At this time, even Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury were dumbfounded by this situation. Although the three of them had long expected Shi Feng to have extraordinary strength after he got into the Luminous Glory List, they didn’t think he would be this strong.

Just a second ago, they thought that Shi Feng had died under Ghost Hand’s Star Rain. Yet, in the next second, Ghost Hand was killed by Shi Feng. They also clearly saw that Ghost Hand had failed to sense Shi Feng’s presence behind him right until Shi Feng stabbed him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Is there really such a massive gap between a Luminous Glory expert and a non-Luminous Glory expert?

Leroja dared not believe her eyes when she saw Ghost Hand’s corpse falling to the ground. Although it had been many years since the Starlight Realm had produced a Luminous Glory expert, that did not stop her from researching the experts on the Luminous Glory List.

Meanwhile, from the information she studied, while she acknowledged that the Luminous Glory List’s experts were inhuman, were they strong to such an exaggerated extent?

It should be known that Ghost Hand was already a fifth-floor expert. Killing fourth-floor experts like them should be child’s play for him. It also wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was already equal to the experts on the Luminous Glory List.

Yet, Ghost Hand couldn’t even last more than one move against Shi Feng?

Different from Leroja, Cross broke out into cold sweat when he saw Shi Feng handily defeating Ghost Hand. After all, before the Rookie Competition’s finals started, he had boldly stated that Shi Feng might be able to become a worthy opponent for him in the future. He was basically treating Shi Feng like a junior at the time…

Thank goodness the Rookie Competition’s finals didn’t adopt a duel format. Otherwise, I’d have made a huge fool out of myself,?Cross thought as he wiped the sweat on his forehead. If he were to stand in Ghost Hand’s shoes, he probably wouldn’t even know how he had died to Shi Feng.

As for Desolate Fury, he couldn’t help but let out a rueful sigh when he saw Shi Feng defeating Ghost Hand. When they first met, Shi Feng was a nobody whom even Lightning Chaser looked at in contempt. Now, Shi Feng had already reached a height where he couldn’t even see.

With the strength to slay a fifth-floor expert in one move, there was no doubt that Shi Feng had already reached the apex of the Starlight Realm’s younger generation of Tier 4 experts. At this point, only older generation Tier 4 experts would have any hope of one-upping him.

While Desolate Fury was immersed in melancholy, the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players briefly looked at each other before scattering without hesitation, none of them daring to continue their assault on Desolate Fury’s group.

If all of them were to fight against Ghost Hand together, it would only be a matter of time before Ghost Hand killed them all. Now that it was proven that even Ghost Hand wasn’t a match for Shi Feng, even if Shi Feng wasn’t an Assassin, so long as he could kill one of them with every swing of his sword, it wouldn’t take him more than a hundred swings to end the fight.

The penalty for death in the Holy Realm was incredibly severe. Should players die, they would permanently lose 10% of their Basic Attributes. If they died too many times, their accounts would be essentially crippled.

In no time, the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players vanished from the area.

They’re finally gone.

Shi Feng sighed in relief when he saw the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players retreating.

The mana suppression in the Holy Realm was so powerful that it had thoroughly negated any advantages his Mana Body had previously provided him. In addition, it became extremely taxing on his Concentration and Stamina to use combat techniques.

Meanwhile, although Divine Might was powerful, it wasn’t omnipotent. It only allowed him to perceive his opponent’s every movement and mental state as well as suppress his opponent’s mental state and five senses. For these reasons, Ghost Hand was no different than a titled expert before him. At most, Ghost Hand would possess stronger combat techniques than the average titled expert.

However, when going up against several dozen players who were in a battle array that increased their Basic Attributes and shared linked five senses, the advantages provided by Divine Might would diminish. If the Dragon Mountain Realm’s players were intent on killing him at all costs, it would only be a matter of time before they succeeded.

Subsequently, Shi Feng picked up a tattered sack that Ghost Hand dropped.

Sure enough, he had a substitution tool,?Shi Feng thought, not feeling too surprised as he looked at the tattered sack.

Every peerless paragon belonging to a major power would typically have a substitution tool that could let them negate the penalties of death. This was so that these peerless paragons could avoid accidentally falling into ruin. For a fifth-floor expert like Ghost Hand, it wouldn’t even be strange if he had two or three substitution tools.

Meanwhile, if a player with a substitution tool was killed, they wouldn’t drop any weapons or equipment. At most, they would lose items guaranteed to drop on death.

After collecting Ghost Hand’s loot, Shi Feng made his way to Desolate Fury’s group of three.

“Are you three alright?” Shi Feng asked when he saw that the three people before him were covered in injuries. Then, he continued, “How did you three get here? Are you not going to participate in the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition?”

Previously, Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury had participated in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition to enter the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition. Now that the competition in question was about to begin, Shi Feng found it strange that these three people would appear in the Holy Realm.

“The Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition?” Looking at Shi Feng strangely, Desolate Fury asked, “Don’t you know that the competition is already over, Brother Black Flame?”

“Over?” Shi Feng was confused. “Shouldn’t it just be starting soon?”

When he returned to the Miniature Ancient World from the Greater God’s Domain, the Galaxy Conglomerate’s preliminaries had just begun. Going by how much time had passed, the official phase of the invitational competition shouldn’t have started yet, much less ended.

“It’s already been two days since the Galaxy Conglomerate’s invitational competition has ended, Brother Black Flame,” Cross said, affirming Desolate Fury’s words. “Moreover, we are only here in the Holy Realm because the Galaxy Conglomerate sent us here after the competition. When the competition started, we wondered why you didn’t show up. The Galaxy Conglomerate even sent people to try and contact you.”

“The competition ended two days ago?”

When Shi Feng heard Cross’s words, he suddenly thought of the Space-Time Storm. He had no idea how much time he had spent in the Space-Time Storm. The passage of time inside the Space-Time Storm was also warped, so it wouldn’t be strange if a moment in the Space-Time Storm was several days in the real world.

Meanwhile, when Desolate Fury and the others saw Shi Feng’s reaction, they quickly understood what had happened and started explaining the situation to Shi Feng.

There were countless mysteries in God’s Domain. Situations such as players entering an area with a different flow rate of time weren’t unheard of. There were even instances of players experiencing one year in just one day, so Shi Feng’s case of experiencing one moment in several days wasn’t all too surprising.

Meanwhile, after listening to the trio’s explanation, Shi Feng learned that he had spent real-world days in the Space-Time Storm. He also learned that two days ago, the Galaxy Conglomerate had made an astronomical offer to the Tier 4 players of its invitational competition for them to enter the Holy Realm.

Originally, everyone who had received the Galaxy Conglomerate’s offer was very excited. However, shortly after arriving in the Holy Realm, everyone realized that the Holy Realm wasn’t as simple as they thought it to be and that they weren’t alone in the Holy Realm. The geniuses and paragons of many other Realms had also entered the Holy Realm.

Meanwhile, everyone only had one goal in the Holy Realm.
