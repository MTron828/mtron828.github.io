Chapter 3823 - 897 - Another Mortal God?

Flame Dragon God’s Treasury, Central Plaza, Advanced Tent:

The representatives of the ten pseudo-apex powers all wore gloomy expressions as they sat at the round table, staring at their respective Magic Mirrors.

“Everyone, voice your thoughts,” Tarnished Wind said, breaking the silence. “Do any of you know the origins of Dragon’s Crown?”

Nobody spoke after Tarnished Wind. Everyone merely shook their head as they focused on the figures of the Dragon’s Crown members displayed in their Magic Mirror, intent on uncovering any helpful information.

“Sure enough, no one knows,” South Lake sighed. “Our luck is truly rotten, coming across a well-hidden apex power under such circumstances. It’ll be difficult for us to appease the other party.”

“Appeasing the other party shouldn’t be difficult,” Ember Dragon countered calmly. “While we might have organized the operation this time, that person was the one who asked for a fight. We can just compensate Dragon’s Crown for its troubles afterward. At worst, we will have to sacrifice those involved. I doubt an apex power like Dragon’s Crown will demand anything more. After all, we all have connections with apex powers. The other apex powers won’t sit back if Dragon’s Crown tries to take things too far.”

“That’s true.” Tarnished Wind agreed with Ember Dragon. “Although we aren’t subordinates of those apex powers, we trade with them a lot. If a hidden apex power tries to get involved in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary and eliminate us all, it’d be no different from plundering the resources of other apex powers. Those apex powers won’t sit still and do nothing. As a hidden apex power, I’m sure Dragon’s Crown can understand this point.

“The problem is figuring out Dragon’s Crown’s goal in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Dragon’s Crown has hidden its existence so well until now, so why did it suddenly make such a high-profile appearance here? If we can’t figure this out, we might unknowingly offend it in the future and get destroyed.”

The various pseudo-apex powers’ representatives nodded in agreement.

Nobody doubted whether Dragon’s Crown was a hidden apex power anymore. Even if it wasn’t one, with its ability to muster nearly a hundred Level 240 experts, it still wasn’t an existence pseudo-apex powers could recklessly provoke. Not to mention, the topic of hidden apex powers wasn’t anything new in the Greater God’s Domain.

Take Demon’s Gate, for example. It was the most recent apex power to have appeared out of nowhere. Initially, nobody knew about this organization of lunatics. By the time everyone knew Demon’s Gate was an apex power, it had already decimated over a dozen pseudo-apex powers.

The fact that Dragon’s Crown was a hidden apex power wasn’t concerning. After all, several apex powers were already operating publicly. These surface apex powers had long since established a balance of power in the Greater God’s Domain.

If any apex power tried to overstep its boundaries, other apex powers would intervene for their own sake. This went double for hidden apex powers.

Dragon’s Crown’s high-profile appearance meant that this hidden apex power no longer wished to operate behind the scenes; it wanted to step into the limelight. To debut on the public stage, it would most certainly conduct an operation somewhere.

Thus, they needed to find out how Dragon’s Crown planned to execute its debut. The last thing they wanted was to unknowingly stand in Dragon’s Crown’s way and get eliminated because of it. It was also unlikely that other apex powers would wage an all-out war against another apex power because of one or two pseudo-apex powers.

“How about this? Rather than waste time guessing, let’s ask them,” Ember Dragon said, drumming his fingers on the table. “We don’t need to know their exact plans. We only need a general idea of what they want to accomplish and offer our full cooperation. That way, we can largely avoid conflicts with Dragon’s Crown.”

“This…” South Lake frowned. Then, he skeptically asked, “Will they be willing to talk to us, though? Once a hidden apex power decides to debut, it will carry out every step of its plan in secrecy to prevent other apex powers from interfering. If we accidentally angered Dragon’s Crown, wouldn’t we worsen the situation for ourselves?”

“Do you think the situation will improve without us doing anything?” Ember Dragon scoffed. “Don’t forget, we have a not-so-insignificant misunderstanding with Dragon’s Crown. If we don’t clarify our stance, Dragon’s Crown might very well decide to dispose of us.”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“It would be inappropriate to have the frontline personnel ask these questions.” After pondering for a moment, Tarnished Wind suggested, “We should go there in person. That way, we can show Dragon’s Crown our sincerity.”

“I second this!”

“I second this, too!”

…

The other pseudo-apex powers’ representatives all agreed with Tarnished Wind’s suggestion. They would only worsen their relationship with Dragon’s Crown if they had their subordinates negotiate such an important affair.

“That won’t be necessary!”

As the representatives were getting up from their seats, a clear and unfamiliar voice suddenly entered their ears, startling them.

When everyone turned to the source, they saw a graceful female knight standing at the Advanced Tent’s entrance. She had an eye-catching divine pattern between her brows, and her level of 243 was even more striking.

“Who are you?”

“How did you get in here?”

“Where are the guards?”

Everyone in the tent, including Tarnished Wind and the other Level 240-plus experts, promptly armed themselves when they saw the female knight. They behaved as if they were facing a formidable enemy.

As the Advanced Tent they used was meant to host the core executives of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s ten pseudo-apex powers, at least one large-scale Great Grandmaster Magic Array was set up to protect it. There were also a hundred Level 235-plus fifth-floor experts standing guard around it at all times.

Normally, even a Level 240 expert fully equipped with Divine Artifacts would need considerable time to break through a large-scale Great Grandmaster Magic Array. It was also impossible to break the barrier without making a commotion. Not to mention, everyone present was an expert. Nevertheless, nobody had noticed the female knight before she spoke.

“I am Purgatory Jade, Dragon’s Crown’s Second Vice Guild Leader. You don’t need to doubt the safety standards of your tent. I could only enter here because I have this Tier 6 Divine Runic Teleportation Scroll.” As Purgatory Jade introduced herself, a magic scroll appeared in her hands. The scroll had divine runes hovering around it, and it exuded mana that was denser than even that of Ancient Gods. “I can freely enter and leave any place not protected by a Craftsman Magician’s magic barrier with this scroll.”

“A Tier 6 Divine Runic Teleportation Scroll?!” South Lake was shocked as he looked at the scroll that Purgatory Jade held. “Isn’t that the Teleportation Scroll rumored to be able to travel anywhere besides the Taboo Zones established by Primordial Gods?!”

“As expected of a hidden apex power. Pseudo-apex powers like us can only marvel at the strength and foundation you possess,” Tarnished Wind sighed, the fighting spirit that flickered in his eyes disappearing. “If even a Mortal God like yourself can only serve as the Second Vice Guild Leader, I can’t even fathom how big a gap exists between our Guilds.”

At Tarnished Wind’s words, many of the other pseudo-apex powers’ representatives quickly realized a critical point they had missed.

Another Mortal God?
