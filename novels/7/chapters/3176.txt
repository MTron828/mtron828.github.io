Chapter 251 – Greater World’s Secrets

Outside of Abyssal Star City…

After the magic barrier enveloping Abyssal Star City disappeared, the millions of players outside looked at the city eagerly.

The changes to Abyssal Star City were visible to the naked eye.

The city’s size and the mana it radiated to the surroundings were enough to let everyone understand that Abyssal Star City had already surpassed small NPC Cities.

A huge commotion had even started on the Miniature Ancient World’s official forums because of Abyssal Star City’s changes. Everyone eagerly discussed what sort of changes might have taken place in Abyssal Star City, what they should do immediately after entering the city, and what they could do to make money via Abyssal Star City.

At this time, even the Flower of Seven Sins, the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s enemy, was filled with curiosity toward Abyssal Star City.

Abyssal Star City was already fated to become the Miniature Ancient World’s number one player-owned city. However, exactly how much attention this number one city could attract from the Miniature Ancient World’s players and powers was crucial for the Flower of Seven Sins.

Now that the Miniature Ancient World had become a training ground for the various God’s Domains’ rookies, it would more or less attract the attention of some conglomerates. If Abyssal Star City attracted enough players and powers, the Greater World’s conglomerates might decide to invest in the Asura Mercenary Alliance. Once that happened, the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s development would skyrocket.

…

Shadow Fog City, Flower of Seven Sins’ Residence:

“Big Sis Omen, do you think those conglomerates will really set their sights on Abyssal Star City?” Summer Wolf asked worriedly when he saw the ongoing discussions on the official forums. “If a conglomerate invests in the Asura Mercenary Alliance, we will most likely be numbered...”

Before learning about the Greater God’s Domain, players wouldn’t know exactly how terrifying the Greater World’s conglomerates were. However, once one came into contact with some information about the Greater God’s Domain, one would realize that even Higher God’s Domains wouldn’t dare to offend the Greater World’s conglomerates.

An example would be the Flower of Seven Sins’ Thousand Scars. Ever since Thousand Scars caught the attention of a conglomerate, the various hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World had promptly begun treating the Flower of Seven Sins courteously.

However, if Abyssal Star City managed to attract the attention of a conglomerate, the Flower of Seven Sins would probably cease to exist in the Miniature Ancient World. After all, there was a big difference in significance between an individual and an entire organization receiving a conglomerate’s attention. It wouldn’t be difficult to imagine which of the two would receive greater priority from a conglomerate.

“What are you worried about? There’s no way those conglomerates would decide to invest in a power so easily, much less a local power of the Miniature Ancient World,” Death Omen said contemptuously. “The Asura Mercenary Alliance would first have to become a hegemonic power and gain control of at least one-third of the Miniature Ancient World if it wants to attract a conglomerate’s attention. No conglomerate would care about the small profits generated by Abyssal Star City.

“Moreover, Abyssal Star City’s Teleportation Hall is only connected to Hundred Flow City’s Teleportation Hall. Players will have to go through Hundred Flow City before they can teleport to other NPC Cities. Abyssal Star City would be fortunate if it could attract even one-tenth of the Miniature Ancient World’s hegemonic powers.”

“I guess you’re right.” After thinking it over, Summer Wolf nodded in agreement with Death Omen.

The Greater World’s conglomerates wouldn’t even glance at ordinary hegemonic powers. Only upper-ranked hegemonic powers and above could receive partnership offers from the various conglomerates.

Meanwhile, every upper-ranked hegemonic power was a frightening existence that had successfully established an empire in the Greater God’s Domain and whose rule spanned over one hundred God’s Domains.

So, the likelihood of the Asura Mercenary Alliance attracting a conglomerate’s attention with the Abyssal Star Primordial City alone was incredibly slim.

“What’s the status of Thousand Scars?” Death Omen asked. “Whether the Flower of Seven Sins can secure a stable position in the Miniature Ancient World all depends on her now!”

“We’ve delivered all the Life Potions and combat techniques we purchased to her already. I believe she can achieve further improvements within the near future,” Summer Wolf reported.

“Good! So long as she can become a prioritized core talent, it’s only a matter of time before we can make the Asura Mercenary Alliance disappear!” Death Omen nodded, her mood improving significantly.

Zero Wing’s foundations might have exceeded her expectations. However, so long as the Flower of Seven Sins had a conglomerate to rely on, it wouldn’t matter even if Zero Wing had multiple fourth-floor experts defending it.

As soon as Death Omen finished speaking, both Death Omen and Summer Wolf received a message notification simultaneously.

“Is Zero Wing crazy? If it sets the entrance fee at 50 Silver, even the various powers will give up on Abyssal Star City, let alone independent players,” Summer Wolf exclaimed, a look of disbelief appearing on his face when he finished reading the report on Abyssal Star City’s situation.

If a power decided to set up an operating base in Abyssal Star City, it would assign a minimum of several thousand members to the city. If every one of these players had to pay 50 Silver just to enter the city every day, it would become a significant expense even for the various powers.

Not to mention, the Level 120-plus maps would soon open. Once that happened, Abyssal Star City would become nothing more than a teleportation hub allowing players to reach the Boundary Mountain Range much more easily.

However, if Abyssal Star City charged an entrance fee of 50 Silver per player, nobody would be willing to use the city even as a teleportation hub. After all, players would have to first line up in Hundred Flow City to teleport to Abyssal Star City. Rather than waste all that time just to save a negligible amount of money, it’d be much better if they traveled to the Boundary Mountain Range by Mount.

“It seems this is all Zero Wing amounts to,” Death Omen said, sighing in relief.

If Zero Wing freely let the Miniature Ancient World’s various powers enter Abyssal Star City, a large number of powers would flood the city. At that time, there’d be a real possibility of the city attracting a conglomerate’s attention. Meanwhile, if the Asura Mercenary Alliance truly managed to gain the support of a conglomerate, Hidden Soul’s status would skyrocket, and the Flower of Seven Sins would become a joke.

However, after the stunt Zero Wing just pulled, Abyssal Star City could, at most, attract the attention of local players and powers. The city would have great difficulty attracting the attention of the various foreign powers, let alone conglomerates.

…

At this time, the Flower of Seven Sins wasn’t the only one surprised by Abyssal Star City’s new rules. This change also caught the various local and foreign powers and players off guard.

“Is the Asura Mercenary Alliance crazy? Rather than secure itself a good future, it’s choosing to target natives only?”

“I doubt even natives will buy into an entrance fee of 50 Silver. After all, the Level 120-plus maps will be opening soon. All players above Level 115 will definitely move their base of operations to the Level 120-plus NPC Cities. Who would want to settle in Abyssal Star City?”

“Fifty Silver? Is Asura attempting daylight robbery? Moreover, teleportation fees can only be paid in Magic Crystals, and each teleportation costs two Magic Crystals? I only earn three Magic Crystals per Advanced Quest I complete for the Adventurer’s Association, and I can only pick up one Advanced Quest every two or three days!”

“I know, right? Repairing Epic Weapons and Equipment already costs a lot of Magic Crystals. Magical classes might only need to spend around one Magic Crystal per day for repairs, but plate-armor classes like us need to spend at least two Magic Crystals even on a good day or four Magic Crystals on a bad day. Is Asura telling us to fight naked?”

“That’s not all. Now, even Asura’s members are in a miserable state. Although Bronze members will still receive discounts when entering the city, they’ll no longer qualify to train in the Primordial Tower. Now, only Silver members and above can train in the tower. Moreover, the hourly usage fee has increased to 300 Magic Crystals. Only peak experts could possibly afford such a price.”

“If I have that many Magic Crystals, I’d rather spend it on buying a Basic Combat Technique from the Greater God’s Domain’s. It only costs 200 Magic Crystals to learn a Basic Combat Technique in our Guild.”

The Miniature Ancient World’s official forums were filled with complaints from both local and foreign players. After seeing the changes to Abyssal Star City’s rules, everyone was of the opinion that Abyssal Star City’s development would only go downhill from now on.

…

Hundred Flow City, Teleportation Hall:

“I’m afraid Abyssal Star City is beyond salvation now, Maria. Are you sure you still want to establish your trade center there?” Favra, holding a silver scepter in her hand, asked as she looked at her niece.

Maria was a little dazed when she learned about Abyssal Star City’s situation. However, after calming down, she earnestly said, “I still plan to take a look at it first.”

Honestly, Maria was greatly confused by the action Zero Wing took. After all, now that Abyssal Star City had just been upgraded into a Basic City, it was the best opportunity to attract the various powers to settle in the city and drive the city’s trade. Yet, Zero Wing had chosen to forsake this opportunity...
