Chapter 2891 ‚Äì Upgrade to Legendary

The moment Shi Feng chose to have the Light of Two Worlds absorb the Scorching Eye, the latter transformed into a bundle of flames and merged with the Fragmented Legendary Weapon.

The crimson flames made the sword spontaneously ignite, and the cracked divine runes engraved on it began mending. Several seconds later, crimson divine runes lit up all over the sword, followed by a significant increase in the Light of Two Worlds‚Äôs aura.

What a powerful aura!

Shi Feng was astonished as he looked at the weapon in his hand.

The aura the Light of Two Worlds now exuded was more than enough to deter ordinary Tier 4 players from approaching it. A Tier 4 player would need to break through the 100% threshold of their Mana Body to withstand the devastating power overflowing from the sword.

However, compared to the Light of Two Worlds‚Äôs external changes, the changes to its statistics were much more remarkable.

The upgrade had boosted the Basic Attributes that the weapon provided by 15%. With the weapon, Shi Feng‚Äôs Strength finally exceeded the 70,000 threshold. Now, he was only slightly inferior to Level 150, Tier 5 Legendary monsters in the Strength Attribute.

In addition, the Light of Two Worlds‚Äôs three Additional Skills had been upgraded to Tier 5. World Breaker, in particular, could now increase an attack‚Äôs power up to the Tier 6 Basic rank. The Skill‚Äôs Cooldown had also decreased from one hour to just half an hour.

After Shi Feng got over his joy of upgrading the Light of Two Worlds, he shifted his attention to his Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape.

Now that I‚Äôve upgraded the Light of Two Worlds, there‚Äôs no hurry to improve my weapons anymore. However, as a Tier 5, the Lifesaving Skills I have are far too few. I wonder how much the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape will improve if I upgrade it?

Shi Feng took out three more God Crystals from his bag as he looked at the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape, completing the seven God Crystals required to repair the Fragmented Legendary Equipment. Initially, he had planned to upgrade the Abyssal Blade to Tier 5 once he had saved up enough God Crystals, so he never bothered using the seven leftover God Crystals from the Dragon Trial. However, now that he had upgraded the Light of Two Worlds, he wasn‚Äôt in as much of a rush to upgrade the Abyssal Blade. This meant there was no need for him to reserve those remaining God Crystals. Instead, he could use them to raise his survivability. After all, Tier 5 players might be powerful, but they weren‚Äôt invincible. It might be fine if he died in a Dungeon, but if he died in the outside world, he would suffer immense losses.

After players reached Tier 5, they wouldn‚Äôt just lose a level when they died. Their Mana Bodies would also suffer damage, and a full recovery would take at least three or four days. Either that or players could spend Seven Luminaries Crystals to speed up the recovery process. Because of this significant death penalty, all players would try to raise their survivability as much as possible after reaching Tier 5.

System: Sufficient God Crystals detected. Do you wish to let the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape absorb them?

‚ÄúAbsorb!‚Äù

Shi Feng agreed to the prompt without hesitation.

The seven God Crystals in Shi Feng‚Äôs hands gradually disintegrated into seven streams of light that lingered around the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape, then merged with the cape‚Äôs tattered divine runes, repairing them.

When the seven God Crystals were gone, the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape‚Äôs divine runes suddenly lit up. A layer of black fog then appeared around the ordinary-looking cape, reducing Shi Feng‚Äôs presence significantly and preventing others from inspecting his information. Now, Shi Feng could even erase his presence completely if he wanted to.

Apart from the cape‚Äôs hidden effects, its statistics had also undergone earth-shattering changes.

The Blacksmith God Bayer crafted this cape for the Tyrant of Destruction. It possesses the power to traverse the void.

...

No wonder they say Legendary Weapons and Equipment grant players the power to transcend tiers! This Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape is simply preposterous!

Shi Feng was thunderstruck when he read the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape‚Äôs information displayed before him.

Although the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape still couldn‚Äôt let Tier 5 players stand toe-to-toe with Tier 6 players, it at least provided Tier 5 players with a certain degree of survivability against Tier 6 players. The Skill Void Walk was especially excellent for escapes. If Shi Feng escaped into the void, even a Tier 6 player would have difficulty searching for him. After all, even Tier 6 players would be subject to a powerful oppression when traversing the void.

If a Tier 4 player were to equip the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape, their strength would approach that of Tier 5 players. Unless a Tier 5 player could counter the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape‚Äôs abilities, or the Tier 4 player in question did something stupid, it would be impossible for a Tier 5 player to kill a Tier 4 player equipped with the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape. Meanwhile, after upgrading the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape, Shi Feng‚Äôs Strength Attribute skyrocketed once more, hitting the 90,000 mark. Now, he had 10,000 more Strength than the average Level 180, Tier 5 NPC. In terms of Basic Attributes, he already stood at the peak of Tier 5 existences, inferior only to Tier 5 NPCs wielding Legendary Weapons.

I thought I would have to wait a little longer before I could challenge the Evil God‚Äôs Secret Land, but now it seems that won‚Äôt be necessary. Fighting spirit flared in Shi Feng‚Äôs eyes as he thought about the God Mode Secret Land.

An ordinary Tier 5 player would not have the ability to challenge the Evil God‚Äôs Secret Land. However, with the Nightwalker‚Äôs Cape, combined with his above-average Basic Attributes, he was more than qualified to enter the God Mode Secret Land. Moreover, he had to raid the secret land, no matter what. After all, the wealth it contained surpassed the treasuries of several kingdoms combined.

But I‚Äôll need to make preparations first before challenging it.

Other people in God‚Äôs Domain might be ignorant of the situation inside God Mode Secret Lands, but not Shi Feng. Although he had never entered a God Mode Secret Land in his previous life, he had heard many stories of Tier 5 players rashly entering a God Mode Secret Land and meeting an untimely death.

A God Mode Secret Land had an excellent environment rivaling that of ancient times, and the concomitant dangers of ancient times. The poison fogs and extreme weather found inside God Mode Secret Lands were more than enough to claim a Tier 5 player‚Äôs life.

Hence, before entering a God Mode Secret Land, the various superpowers would always gather many Master and Grandmaster Alchemists to craft Magic Resistance Potions and potions that strengthened the user‚Äôs physique. These potions were essential for Tier 4 players seeking to enter the secret land. Without these potions, they could die at any given moment.

After thinking up to this point, Shi Feng contacted Melancholic Smile and had her prepare the necessary potions, particularly Grandmaster Potions. The more Grandmaster Potions they had, the better. Acquiring Grandmaster Potions wasn‚Äôt difficult for Zero Wing now, as Silent Wonder had recently become a Grandmaster Alchemist.

Time passed quickly. Two days after Zero Wing began preparing to raid the Evil God‚Äôs Secret Land, shock and fear suddenly swept the eastern continent‚Äôs various forces.

Just a while ago, the eastern continent‚Äôs various forces received news that a large number of players had emerged from the World Passage. Their numbers were unprecedented, with many Tier 4 players among them.

According to the reports of scouts and insider information from Outerworld players, more than 20 superpowers had entered God‚Äôs Domain from the Outerworld. The Outerworld‚Äôs NPC conquest army had also finished gathering its forces, and this army consisted of NPCs from over 30 kingdoms and six empires. One could say that the Outerworld‚Äôs NPC forces were adamant in conquering the eastern continent this time.

This conquest army had already gathered on the other end of the World Passage and was steadily making its way to the eastern continent.

The advent of the second War of Worlds was here.

In response, the eastern continent‚Äôs native forces began frantically raising their defenses, recruiting experts, and increasing their levels. They also banded together, forming a coalition to defend against the Outerworld forces.

At this time, though, an equally jaw-dropping incident took place in God‚Äôs Domain.

Mythology‚Äôs First Vice Guild Leader, Cold Shadow, left Mythology and joined Zero Wing with a large number of experts and resources, becoming one of Zero Wing‚Äôs Vice Guild Leaders!
