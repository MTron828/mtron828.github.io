Chapter 2416 – One Axe, One Sword

As Evil Qilin’s question hung in the air, Demon Palace’s members fell silent. Their jaws hung open, and they couldn’t process the possibility.

They had heard Black Flame’s name before. Not long ago, their Vice Guild Leader had tried to secure Zero Wing’s Stone Forest City to help the Guild’s peak experts develop rapidly. Naturally, as members of Demon Palace’s main force, they had heard about the situation.

However, they had never thought that Black Flame would be this strong!

Black Flame’s ability to instant-kill Dark Scorpion, the vice commander of Demon Palace’s main force, was unbelievable.

Even Evil Qilin could hardly believe the notion, but he had earnestly researched the Swordsman and studied his battle videos. The lightning bolt that had killed Dark Scorpion was one of Black Flame’s trademark moves, Lightning Slash, and had claimed many experts’ lives.

Although he hadn’t thought it important before, Evil Qilin had heard that Zero Wing was one of the powers trying to rescue Heaven’s Blade’s commander.

Seeing Lightning Slash and the Swordsman’s obvious relation to Heaven’s Blade, Evil Qilin could only think of Zero Wing’s Black Flame.

“That’s right. We meet again, Elder Qilin,” Shi Feng said, chuckling as he sheathed Killing Ray. He did not bother to hide his identity.

Hearing Shi Feng acknowledge his identity, Demon Palace’s members gasped.

“Zero Wing’s Black Flame is this strong?”

They considered Zero Wing to be a mere upstart Guild that was lucky enough to secure a treasure trove like Stone Forest City, which, in turn, allowed the Guild to nurture Tier 3 players sooner than other powers.

Although Zero Wing’s Guild Leader was the first player to reach Tier 3, they thought he had lost his advantage now that the various superpowers had Tier 3 experts of their own. As for Shi Feng’s identity as the 30th ranked player on the God’s Domain Experts List, that was of no concern.

The various superpowers had an agreement with the Secret Pavilion that it would only display information about a small number of their experts. No one wanted to reveal all of their cards. If not for this agreement, the various superpowers would’ve ganged up on the Secret Pavilion and removed it from the virtual gaming world. To put it simply, the God’s Domain Experts List wasn’t a reliable way to determine an expert’s strength.

And yet, Shi Feng had instant-killed Dark Scorpion, who ranked among the top 30 on Dragonheart Island. The situation destroyed everything they thought they knew about Shi Feng.

This Swordsman was clearly powerful enough to rank among the top 10 experts on Dragonheart Island. With such strength, they couldn’t afford to take him lightly.

Numerous superpowers operated on Dragonheart Island, and quite a few of them were Super Guilds. Even the weakest power on the island was on par with a first-rate Guild. Dragonheart Island was a hub for peak experts, and not a single individual who could rank among the island’s top 10 experts should be underestimated.

Of course, that did not mean that Demon Palace feared Shi Feng. Evil Qilin could also rank among the top 10 experts on Dragonheart Island. If it came down to an actual fight, Shi Feng’s victory wasn’t guaranteed.

Furthermore, they had far more Tier 3 experts than Shi Feng’s little group of five.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, my subordinates behaved rashly. May I request that you spare them? Then we can go our separate ways,” Evil Qilin asked as he gestured to Wind Gull and White Rainbow.

Hearing the request, Cleansing Flame breathed a sigh of relief. If Evil Qilin wanted a fight, the outcome wouldn’t be in their favor. Even if Zero Wing’s members were far stronger than expected, Demon Palace still had 15 combat-ready Tier 3 players on its team.

Moreover, team battles weren’t like one-on-one fights. Evil Qilin had two Tier 3 healers with him, whereas they didn’t have a single healer, and would have to rely on potions and items with Healing Skills.

“I’ve already said that this is a fair, one-on-one match. I don’t care if they acted rashly or not. If they want to leave, all they have to do is die once,” Shi Feng refused, chuckling.

As he did, a chilling atmosphere enveloped the area.

“Are you so unwilling to give the matter a little consideration on behalf of this old man, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Evil Qilin’s question was laced with killing intent, and he watched Shi Feng with narrowed eyes.

Shi Feng was stronger than he had expected, and Evil Qilin had to admit that the Swordsman qualified to be treated as an equal. But that was all. At most, Shi Feng was only his equal.

“Do you think you can just come and go as you wish? You think too highly of yourself, Elder Qilin,” Shi Feng responded, unfazed by the other man’s hostility. “I’ll repeat myself. I won’t just sit by and watch you interfere.”

“Good! Very good! I see you’re willing to fight, Guild Leader Black Flame!” Evil Qilin’s expression darkened. Suddenly, he radiated dense Mana as if the Demon God had just arrived. Evil Qilin was a much stronger Demonic Fighter than Dark Scorpion.

“Commander, we shouldn’t waste words on him! If we don’t teach him a lesson, he’ll think that he can provoke Demon Palace with impunity just because he’s strong enough to rank among the top 10 experts on Dragonheart Island!” a tall, beautiful woman, another Demonic Fighter, hissed coldly.

The rest of the team’s Tier 3 players nodded in agreement.

Shi Feng was simply too arrogant.

Aside from Super Guilds, no power on Dragonheart Island dared to disrespect Demon Palace. Shi Feng was clearly tired of living by refusing to show Evil Qilin the respect he deserved.

“Since you insist, show me your moves, Guild Leader Black Flame!”

Evil Qilin then pulled the two-handed war axe from his back. The weapon was nearly as long as Evil Qilin was tall, and when he held it in his grip, emerald flames ignited on the axe’s blade, radiating an intense heat. The flames were so hot that space around the war axe blurred.

A Legacy Weapon? Shi Feng was a little surprised to see how perfectly Evil Qilin integrated his strength with the crimson axe.

Legacy Weapons were very rare and usually stronger than ordinary Epic Weapons. Aqua Rose’s Sea Dragon’s Staff was one such example. Although Evil Qilin’s axe wasn’t as powerful as Aqua Rose’s Legacy Staff, it should still be a top-tier Epic Weapon.

Combined with his special Legacy, Evil Qilin’s Strength could likely rival that of a Grand Lord of the same level.

Evil Qilin then transformed into a blazing meteor as he charged at Shi Feng. The older man was even faster than Tier 3 Assassins.

Before anyone could react, Evil Qilin was within 10 yards of Shi Feng, leaving a blazing trail behind him.

So strong! Is he really just a Tier 3 player? Cleansing Flame could not help but gasp when she saw the attack.

Evil Qilin’s aura was even more intense than her commander’s. She couldn’t even muster the courage to resist him as his aura washed over her.

Once he had reached Shi Feng, Evil Qilin raised his axe and swung. The weapon transformed into seven flame serpents, assaulting Shi Feng from multiple directions.

Bronze Combat Technique, Flame Serpent!

As if the seven flame serpents were alive, they each traveled along a unique trajectory. They contained enough Strength that space around them trembled. It was no exaggeration to say that every one of these flame serpents rivaled Dark Scorpion’s prior full-powered blow.

Even Demon Palace’s Tier 3 experts were surprised, not to mention Cleansing Flame. None of them had realized how powerful their commander truly was.

However, Shi Feng did not panic as the seven flame serpents flew toward him. Rather, he leisurely unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and Killing Array, casually swinging the weapons. Immediately, a galaxy of stars manifested around him.

Sword’s Orbit!

Boom... Boom... Boom...

The sounds of one explosion after another echoed throughout the passage. In the end, Shi Feng used Sword’s Orbit to strike down all seven flame serpents. Not only hadn’t the flame serpents reached Shi Feng, but the resulting impacts had forced Evil Qilin to stumble half a step backward.

“Since you’ve finished your attack, it’s my turn!”

Seizing the moment after Evil Qilin’s attack, Shi Feng executed Lightning Flash. Unlike earlier, he now executed the technique with both of his swords, so he could focus more of his strength into the attack than his speed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Seventeen swords lights flashed toward Evil qilin, transforming into arcs of lightning.

Evil Qilin’s heart skipped a beat as he stood against the attack. He could sense that every arch of lightning was more powerful than his flame serpents.

He gripped his axe tightly and swung it in a horizontal arc, activating his Tier 3 Legacy Skill, Demonic Gale. A pitch- black storm formed before him, clashing with the blue lightning.

Boom!

When the two collided, Evil Qilin’s storm dissipated instantly. Although he had done his best to evade and deflect Shi Feng’s attack, one of the lightning strikes had brushed past his shoulder, leaving a scorch mark and taking one-quarter of his HP. The difference between their strengths was clear...
