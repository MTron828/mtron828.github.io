Chapter 313 - Killing the Commander

“Gather everyone immediately and surround this area. I don’t believe that they can grow wings and fly away,” Lone Tyrant sternly issued his command.

The news of World Dominators’ defeat had already spread, and very few in White River City did not know about the battle that took place. This result had greatly boosted Zero Wing’s prestige.

If Dark Star could get rid of not only Zero Wing’s core team, but Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame, also, then they could destroy the fame that Zero Wing had accumulated up until this point.

At that time, Dark Star would also garner fame themselves, killing two birds with one stone.

Naturally, Lone Tyrant would not let go of such a valuable opportunity.

Immediately, everyone from Dark Star started moving.

Previously, they had tried to cover too large an area in their search. Now that Shi Feng and the core team of Zero Wing had exposed themselves, Lone Tyrant quickly concentrated their hunt.

---

Soon, more and more Dark Star members gathered at the stated location in the dense forest. Shi Feng, who remained hidden in a tree, did not panic at this situation. Instead, he continued to wait for all the members of Dark Star to arrive.

“Come, come. The more, the merrier,” Shi Feng inwardly chuckled as he saw that the number of players gathered had already exceeded 1,000.

Before the battle even started, Shi Feng had already considered the consequences.

If he had not come fully prepared, he would not have allowed Fire Dance and the others to obliterate South Wolf’s team of elites.

“Guild Leader, our members have surrounded this part of the forest. As long as any Zero Wing’s members show themselves, it will be their death,” a Ranger reported as he walked up to Lone Tyrant.

“Good. Start shrinking the encirclement.” Lone Tyrant laughed satisfyingly. He then looked towards Ming Sha, the team leader of the Underworld Guards, and respectfully said, “In a moment, we will have to rely on Brother Ming Sha and your men to take care of the experts from Zero Wing.”

“Rest assured; Young Master Feng sent us to deal with Fire Dance and her team of experts. Although there is now an additional Black Flame added to the equation, the Underworld Guards can resolve this solution all the same. We won’t let any of them escape,” Ming Sha replied and nodded his head.

In order to extinguish Zero Wing’s core team, Feng Xuanyang had specifically sent a team of Underworld Guards to assist Dark Star. Feng Xuanyang had gone all out on this hunt.

Every Underworld Guard was an expert that Underworld had spent many years searching for to recruit. Underworld had also spent massive amounts of resources on nurturing these experts further. Compared to Absolute Heaven, the top-tier Assassin that Shi Feng faced before, these Underworld Guards were stronger, not weaker. Meanwhile, Feng Xuanyang had sent a team of 20 of such Guards. One could just imagine the frightening might this team possessed.

Even a 100-man elite team from Dark Star was no match for this team. Also, the leader, Ming Sha, was an expert among experts. In the virtual gaming world, he ranked near the top. Regarding pure combat techniques, he was on the same level as the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow. However, as Gentle Snow was in possession of a huge amount of resources, in terms of equipment, Ming Sha was definitely no match for her.

Originally, Feng Xuanyang had arranged for Ming Sha to go to White River City to deal with Ye Feng. However, Ye Feng was simply too elusive as if he had completely vanished from White River City. Hence, Feng Xuanyang sent Ming Sha to deal with the top experts of Zero Wing, such as Fire Dance and Blackie.

In regards to Ming Sha’s strength, Lone Tyrant had personally experienced its power. Even though he was clearly above Ming Sha in terms of Levels, and his equipment was of higher quality, he still suffered defeat at Ming Sha’s hands in less than twenty exchanges. On the other hand, he had only managed to reduce Ming Sha’s HP by one-tenth.

Meanwhile, after taking some time to focus on upgrades, Ming Sha’s equipment could now compare to Lone Tyrant’s. Now, Ming Sha was mostly geared with several pieces of Level 15 Secret-Silver Set Equipment and Fine-Gold Equipment. He also wielded a Level 15 Fine-Gold greatsword, the Bone Shatterer. His equipment certainly ranked at the very top of White River City.

Lone Tyrant had estimated that, if he fought Ming Sha now, he would last ten exchanges at most before his defeat.

Now that he had so many players surrounding this area and a powerful team of experts like the Underworld Guards supporting him, even a top-tier Assassin like Fire Dance could not escape.

Just as Lone Tyrant felt confident and was about to declare that he would annihilate everyone from Zero Wing, a figure suddenly appeared in the top of a nearby tree. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Someone’s there!” Ming Sha, who possessed acute senses, immediately discovered the figure.

As Ming Sha turned his sights to the intruder, everyone similarly followed his line of sight. Indeed, in the top of the tree, they discovered a person quietly watching them.

“Black Flame!” South Wolf immediately recognized the figure, his eyes burning with rage as he revealed this person’s identity.

At South Wolf’s reminder, everyone finally realized Shi Feng’s identity. After all, Black Flame had always been a mysterious existence, and most players had never actually seen Black Flame before. Now that this intruder had revealed himself, everyone from Dark Star discovered that Black Flame was just an ordinary-looking, middle-aged man. He did not even possess the type of aura that a Guild Leader should have. No matter how they looked at him, he was only an ordinary man.

“So, it is Guild Leader Black Flame. I didn’t expect you to show yourself here. Since you have refused to walk the path towards heaven and have instead barged your way down to hell, today will be the day that you die!” Lone Tyrant laughed coldly. He then commanded, “Everyone, kill him!”

Immediately, over a thousand players from Dark Star surrounded and charged at Shi Feng. Their encirclement was tightly packed, and not even a fly could get past them.

Faced with over a thousand players charging at him, Shi Feng did not panic in the slightest. Instead, his eyes emanated a chilling glow as he glared down at Lone Tyrant, smiling faintly. It was as if these thousand-plus players meant nothing to him. Meanwhile, as the recipient of this gaze, Lone Tyrant’s heart inadvertently quivered. However, Lone Tyrant quickly dispelled this feeling because he did not believe Shi Feng could do anything to him while so many players surrounded him.

In the next moment, however, Shi Feng vanished from the treetop and everyone’s sight.

“This is not good! He’s trying to escape! Quickly, use Flare!” Lone Tyrant hurriedly shouted.

The Rangers quickly used Flare upon receiving Lone Tyrant’s command, brightly illuminating the surrounding area. Within the effective range of Flare, all stealth-type skills would lose their effects. Yet, even after tens of Flares had been launched, Shi Feng’s figure still could not be found.

What the players of Dark Star did not know was that, after Shi Feng had activated the Ring of Nothingness, his first task was not to escape, but to leap forward and charge towards the tree closest to Lone Tyrant. Hence, the Flares used to seal his path of escape served no purpose whatsoever.

“Damn it! He plans to kill his way over! Use Flare and shine Guild Leader Tyrant’s surroundings!” When Youlan recalled the faint smile on Black Flame’s face as he pinned Lone Tyrant with a glare, she instinctively felt that Shi Feng aimed to kill the commander.

Only by doing could Shi Feng possibly redeem Zero Wing’s fame and prestige. At that time, even if Dark Star managed to annihilate Zero Wing’s core team, it would not damage Zero Wing’s reputation if Lone Tyrant, Dark Star’s Guild Leader, died at Black Flame’s hands. After all, even though Zero Wing only had tens of players on their side, they would still have managed to kill Dark Star’s Guild Leader while under the protection of over a thousand players.

At that time, Dark Star would be the one suffering humiliation.

“Why are you all still daydreaming?! Move!” Youlan angrily shouted when she noticed that none of Dark Star’s Rangers had reacted.

However, Youlan suddenly felt that something was amiss. Instead of looking towards the outskirts of the encirclement, all of these Rangers stared at the space above her. Immediately, Youlan raised her head, discovering a figure falling towards her, and this figure was none other than Shi Feng himself.

Panic surfaced on Lone Tyrant’s face. He never imagined that Shi Feng would be so suicidal as to come for his life.

“Black Flame, if you wish to die then I’ll grant your wish!” The corners of Lone Tyrant’s mouth raised slightly. He then picked up his shield and sword, fully prepared to guard against Shi Feng’s attack.

“What amazing courage!” Ming Sha, who stood by Lone Tyrant’s side, brimmed with fighting spirit right now, his eyes glowing as he watched Shi Feng fall. He then retrieved the Bone Shatterer from his back and stood in front of Lone Tyrant, acting like a highly defensive wall.

Ming Sha secretly admired Shi Feng’s performance, and he deeply wished he that could properly exchange blows with this man.

However, responsibilities came first, so he had no choice but to get rid Shi Feng.

Even with Ming Sha protecting Lone Tyrant, Youlan still felt that something was off. After all, why would an intelligent and resourceful man like Black Flame carry out such a reckless action? As insurance, Youlan hurriedly commanded, “Guardian Knights, use Protection Blessing on Guild Leader Tyrant! All healers focus on healing Guild Leader Tyrant as well! Do not let Black Flame succeed!”
