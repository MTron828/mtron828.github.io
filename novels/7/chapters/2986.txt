Chapter 61 – Academy’s Apex

Third Teaching Block, top-floor super-large classroom:

Including Shi Feng, a total of 35 people occupied the spacious classroom that could sit 400 people. Yet, despite less than 10% of the classroom being filled, the classroom’s occupancy had caused an uproar throughout the campus.

This was because, in just one class, Shi Feng had earned a whopping 220,000 Academy Points. Even after deducting the 30,000-point fee to use the classroom, he would still make a net profit of 190,000 points. With this many points, Shi Feng had become the undisputed number one on the instructor points list.

However, contrasting the noisy campus, the inside of the super-large classroom was filled with silence. Everyone kept their mouths shut as they focused their attention on Shi Feng. It was especially true for Qin Wuchen and the other students apprenticed under Shi Feng. Every one of them wore excited looks on their faces, and they thoroughly pushed their five senses to their limits for fear of missing out on even one of Shi Feng’s words.

“Are freshmen nowadays so rich?”

Liang Feng, who sat in the last row of the classroom, couldn’t help but be surprised when he looked at Qin Wuchen and the others.

Liang Feng was aware that Shi Feng possessed some ability. Otherwise, Chen Ziyou couldn’t have reached the Refinement Realm under Shi Feng’s tutelage. This was also why Liang Feng had taken the initiative to attend Shi Feng’s class.

However, Shi Feng’s class was anything but cheap. Even if Qin Wuchen and the others were Shi Feng’s apprentices, they still needed to pay 6,000 points to attend a class. This was an amount even Liang Feng didn’t possess when he was in his freshman year. Yet, all 30 of Shi Feng’s students were in attendance right now…

“It’s not that these freshmen are rich, but that Instructor Shi’s class is really worth the price,” Chen Ziyou said with a faint smile. “If I were a freshman, I’d even go as far as to pay 60,000 points just to attend one of Instructor Shi’s classes, let alone 6,000 points.”

“Keep on boasting,” Liang Feng said as he rolled his eyes at Chen Ziyou. “Even if Instructor Shi has some abilities, the development of combat standards isn’t something that can be done overnight. Your case is just an outlier. Otherwise, the various superpowers wouldn’t be stuck with so few Refinement Realm experts.”

“What you say might be right, Liang Feng, but what Ziyou said is also correct,” Instructor Qi, Qi Lianshan, said as he observed Shi Feng, a rare smile appearing on his face. “Instructor Shi is indeed an extraordinary individual. Setting aside his teaching standards, he definitely has me beat in combat standards. I wouldn’t be a match for him even if I were still in my prime.”

“You’re no match for him even in your prime, Teacher? Is he that strong?” Liang Feng couldn’t help but be surprised as he turned to look at Shi Feng, who currently stood on the podium. He had personally witnessed Qi Lianshan’s true strength. Even at his current deteriorated strength, Qi Lianshan could easily get into the mid-to-upper ranks in the Professional League’s B-League should he choose to participate. Qi Lianshan was probably stronger than even the current Wu Xiaoxiao.

If Qi Lianshan was still in his prime, he would definitely rank at the top of the B-League. He might even have a chance at qualifying for the A-League.

“He is far stronger than you think,” Qi Lianshan said, chuckling. “You might mistake him for your average civilian because he looks and feels so ordinary. However, it is precisely because he is so ordinary that he is scary. He has already reached a level where he can integrate his every movement with his surroundings. Such a person should be a Void Realm expert at the very least. So, how could I, someone who has only ever reached the Flowing Water Realm, match him?”

Upon hearing Qi Lianshan’s explanation, Liang Feng couldn’t help but examine Shi Feng again seriously.

If Shi Feng truly was a Void Realm expert, he would be one of the strongest experts in Jin Hai City. Even the various superpowers would fight to recruit him. A tiny place like Jin Hai University’s God’s Domain Academy wouldn’t be able to accommodate him at all.

At this time, even Chen Ziyou was surprised to hear Qi Lianshan’s explanation. Although she had long since known that Shi Feng was an internal force expert with high combat standards, she never thought Shi Feng’s combat standard would be this high. With his combat standard, Shi Feng could become a top-level executive if he joined a superpower. He could become a frightening existence that qualified to oversee the management of a royal capital.

While Liang Feng and Chen Ziyou were awed by Shi Feng’s strength, Shi Feng scanned the classroom and said in a good mood, “Since nobody else is joining, let us begin the class. However, as everyone’s standard isn’t uniform, I will be providing one-on-one instruction to each of you. Which one of you will go first?”

“Instructor Shi, can I be the first?”

Wu Xiaoxiao, who sat in the first row, suddenly stood up, her beautiful silver hair coupled with her otherworldly temperament instantly aweing everyone in the classroom.

“Sure, come on up,” Shi Feng said, nodding. He wasn’t surprised at all by Wu Xiaoxiao’s initiative.

Even before entering Jin Hai University’s God’s Domain Academy, Shi Feng had already heard of Wu Xiaoxiao’s name. Now that Wu Lingling had become his student, Wu Xiaoxiao would certainly come to test him.

Shi Feng had no intentions of letting Wu Lingling go. After all, Zero Wing was a Guild, and a Guild needed experts if it wanted to grow stronger. Not to mention, God’s Domain had never been a single-player game. Meanwhile, although Wu Lingling and the others might not be the most talented players out there, they were still considerably talented. So long as he nurtured them well, they could quickly be of help to him. This was also one of the reasons why he had chosen to come to the God’s Domain Academy in the first place.

There was no place more suitable for recruiting rookies than in the God’s Domain Academy!

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng finished speaking, Wu Xiaoxiao quickly walked up to the podium in a few steps and stared at Shi Feng with a penetrating gaze.

“Crap! What an exciting situation right off the bat!” Liang Feng became greatly interested when Wu Xiaoxiao got onto the podium.

The name of the Silver Witch was unique in the God’s Domain Academy. The Silver Witch was much stronger than the Academy’s Four Heavenly Kings. She had also reached the Refinement Realm long ago.

Meanwhile, although Wu Xiaoxiao had stated that she had come here for guidance today, everyone present knew that that wasn’t her goal at all. Instead, she had come here to determine whether Shi Feng was qualified to teach Wu Lingling or not.

“Stay focused,” Qi Lianshan reprimanded as he looked at Liang Feng. “Wu Xiaoxiao must’ve gained a significant harvest after her training in Crimson Emperor. If you wish to fight for a high position in God’s Domain in the future, she will inevitably become a mountain that you have to cross.”

“Mhm!”

Immediately, Liang Feng and Chen Ziyou took on a serious attitude.

Now that the Miniature Ancient World was released, a new generation of experts would also emerge. If they wanted to achieve something in God’s Domain in the future, they would have to triumph over these new experts. After all, God’s Domain had limited resources, so the number of players that could stand at the top was naturally limited as well.
