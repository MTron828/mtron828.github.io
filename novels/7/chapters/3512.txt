Chapter 3513 – Chapter 587 – Primordial Godkin

“Impossible!”

“Why is a Primordial Godkin here?!”

When Sky Pivot and Fire Bull saw the lithe figure that emerged from the treasury, their jaws dropped, and their minds couldn’t help but doubt what their eyes were seeing.

[Gorgon Queen] (Primordial Godkin, Divine)

Level 180

HP ? ? ? ? ? ?

!!

Gorgons were descendants of Gods. However, they weren’t particularly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. The Gorgon race even occupied an entire Realm to themselves, and said Realm was currently one of the Twelve Sanctuaries. In terms of Life Rating, the Gorgons were only slightly inferior to Dragons and evenly matched with Angels.

Because of this, any Gorgon that successfully reached the Tier 6 Divine rank would instantly become an opponent that most Tier 6 players would actively avoid. As for Gorgon Queens, who inherited the bloodline of Primordial Gods, they were regarded as Primordial Godkins and possessed talent far above other Gorgons.

Needless to say, Gorgon Queens were extraordinarily powerful. They were so powerful that one of them was even regarded as one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos.

“How dare you insignificant ants set your sights on my race’s treasures?! I will let all of you know the severity of your sins!” the Gorgon Queen bellowed as she glared at the Holy Race players before her. Immediately afterward, an invisible ripple of energy spread from her.

When the ripple spread across the plaza, nearly 90% of the Holy Race players on the underground plaza collapsed on the spot. Then, their bodies quickly turned to stone and disintegrated into dust…

“What…”

This abrupt development dumbfounded the remaining Holy Race players.

It should be known that everyone present had seen Tier 6 Divine monsters before. Yet, even with their experience, they still couldn’t comprehend what they just witnessed.

With only her gaze, the Gorgon Queen had erased nearly 10,000 Tier 5 experts. How could this even be within the realm of feasibility?

What an incredible mental attack! Shi Feng was greatly shocked when he saw the thousands of Holy Race experts turning to dust.

He had slain Tier 6 Gorgons in his previous life, but none of them could even come close to matching the Gorgon Queen before him.

With just one mental attack, the Gorgon Queen had annihilated all players whose Concentration was under the Tier 6 Intermediate standard. Moreover, this was only an AOE mental attack. Her single target mental attacks would undoubtedly be much more powerful.

“Have fun by yourself! That Gorgon Queen isn’t something my party can handle at this point!” Fire Bull said to Sky Pivot before hurriedly activating his Random Teleportation Scroll. When he saw how effortlessly the Gorgon Queen had annihilated thousands of Holy Race experts, he dared not remain in this place for even a moment longer.

“We’re leaving as well!” Sky Pivot promptly said in the party chat. “All of us will be at risk of permanent death if that Gorgon Queen notices us!”

Hearing Sky Pivot’s command, Moon Bamboo, Budding Leaf, Splashing Fire, and Billowing Water did not hesitate to activate the Random Teleportation Scrolls in their hands. After seeing the Gorgon Queen’s display of power, none dared to try their luck anymore.

Mental attacks were largely similar to soul attacks in God’s Domain. In other words, mental attacks could be used to damage souls. Meanwhile, if players had their souls annihilated, they would have to bid goodbye to God’s Domain forever. With such high stakes, nobody would dare to bet whether the Gorgon Queen could annihilate their souls.

The surviving Holy Race experts were no different in this regard, and many chose to retreat without hesitation.

“Dammit!” Extreme Feather cursed angrily when she saw the other powers’ experts fleeing. Unfortunately, despite her anger, she could do nothing about this situation.

“We should quickly retreat as well, Miss Feather,” a Level 165 Holy Race expert anxiously advised when he saw the gloomy look on Extreme Feather.

The surviving experts might be able to survive the Gorgon Queen’s AOE mental attacks, but the Gorgon Queen definitely wasn’t limited to such attacks. She undoubtedly possessed much stronger targeted mental attacks. As for whether they could resist these targeted mental attacks, only a fool would try to test it.

After looking at her anxious subordinates, Extreme Feather gritted her teeth and said, “Everyone…retreat!”

Upon hearing Extreme Feather’s call for retreat, the remaining Holy Race players sighed in relief. For a moment there, they had been incredibly worried Extreme Feather would command them to throw their lives away.

Immediately, the surviving Holy Race players scattered and fled from the underground plaza, none daring to stay here even a moment longer.

“You want to escape?” When the Gorgon Queen saw the Holy Race players fleeing, a contemptuous look appeared on her beautiful face. “Do you think I’ll let you?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Moving her serpent tail, the Gorgon Queen slithered toward the remaining thousand or so Holy Race experts like a bolt of lightning, every Holy Race expert she slithered past turning to stone on the spot. The Gorgon Queen didn’t have to lift even a finger to petrify the fleeing players. She simply wasn’t an existence that Tier 5 players could hope to resist.

Let’s give it a try! Shi Feng thought when he saw the Gorgon Queen hunting down the remaining Holy Race players. Immediately, he equipped the Mental Dominator title and charged toward the treasury.

Even though he had never fought a Gorgon Queen before, he was still more or less aware of their capabilities.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that players would die on the first exchange if they didn’t have sufficiently high Concentration. Even if players possessed heaven-defying Basic Attributes, it still wouldn’t matter.

Normally, players would need to have Tier 6 Advanced Concentration at the very minimum to go up against a Tier 6 Gorgon Queen. Otherwise, they wouldn’t even be qualified to stand before a Tier 6 Gorgon Queen, let alone fight one. They would simply be petrified on the spot.

Currently, Shi Feng’s Concentration had already reached the Tier 6 Advanced standard. If he utilized Mental Condensation, he could push it slightly above the average mark of the Tier 6 Advanced standard. And once he factored in the Mental Dominator’s title effect of weakening all mental attacks he received by 20%, he should have no trouble resisting the Gorgon Queen’s targeted mental attacks.

He’s… How dare he?! Extreme Feather, in her escape, noticed Shi Feng charging for the treasury, and this discovery instantly filled her with rage. After all, it was evident that Shi Feng was utilizing them as distractions for the Gorgon Queen!

“Despicable ant! That’s not a place you can set foot in!” The Gorgon Queen also noticed Shi Feng’s actions, and true rage colored her eyes for the first time. Immediately, she gave up chasing after the several dozen Holy Race experts before her and turned around to go after Shi Feng instead.

Good!

Extreme Feather inwardly celebrated when she saw the Gorgon Queen going away. Not once in her life had anybody dared to take advantage of her. If not for the threat of the Gorgon Queen, she would have definitely taken care of Shi Feng herself.
