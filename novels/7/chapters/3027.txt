Chapter 102 – Inhuman Precision

“Are my ears playing tricks on me?! Did Wu Lingling just reject the Empress’s invitation!?”

“She must’ve lost her mind. I remember that her teacher is called Shi Feng, and he is only the former Guild Leader of a second-rate Guild. Even during his peak, he had only managed to stick around at the top of Tier 3.”

“Tier 3? Doesn’t that mean he’s just an ordinary expert?”

“That’s right. Any one of my Academy’s instructors can beat him up.”

“That guy sure is lucky. I can’t believe he picked up such a peerless genius. He wouldn’t have to worry about his future with such a student following him.”

When the spectating crowd heard Wu Lingling rejecting Purple Jade’s invitation, many of them couldn’t help but grow confused. In addition, some of the instructors present who knew about Wu Lingling’s background couldn’t help but grow jealous of Shi Feng.

After all, even if they set aside the possibility that something might be wrong with Wu Lingling’s brain, the girl could still easily reach Tier 5 with her monstrous talent. If given enough resources, she might even have a chance at reaching Tier 6. Yet, despite being only an ordinary expert, Shi Feng had actually found himself such a monstrously talented apprentice.

“She must be out of her mind! If she doesn’t want that opportunity, she should’ve given it to me instead!” Liu Xuanyi cursed under his breath when he saw Wu Lingling rejecting Purple Jade’s invitation. He was also a Swordsman. If he could have a Tier 6 Swordsman as his instructor, he would have a much easier time climbing to higher tiers in the future.

“Wu Xiaoxiao’s little sister sure is an interesting person. She’s even more stubborn than her elder sister,” Liu Yanya, who stood beside Liu Xuanyi, said as she looked at Wu Lingling. “I’m afraid she’s going to become your biggest rival in the future.”

“Rival?” Shaking his head, Liu Xuanyi said, “She is not worthy of being my rival now that she has rejected the Secret Pavilion’s invitation. With only a Tier 3 instructor and no Guild backing her, I’ll leave her in the dust the next time we meet in the Academy Competition.”

“I guess you’re right. She is the same as her elder sister in this regard,” Liu Yanya said, nodding.

Their instructor Soaring Snake had extended an invitation to Wu Xiaoxiao multiple times in the past. However, Wu Xiaoxiao had rejected his offer every time. Although Wu Xiaoxiao was already receiving from Crimson Emperor right now, the number of recruits Crimson Emperor needed to train was massive. Thus, even though Wu Xiaoxiao was currently training under a superpower, the resources she received wouldn’t be as significant as most people imagined.

Had Wu Xiaoxiao accepted their instructor’s invitation previously, she might even have had a chance to reach Tier 6. Now, though, she could, at most, linger around the Tier 5 threshold.

While the surrounding spectators were feeling surprised and confused over Wu Lingling’s decision, the burly man standing among the Secret Pavilion’s executives similarly couldn’t help but turn toward Jin Hai Academy’s group with a look of surprise on his face.

What’s going on with Jin Hai Academy’s people? Why aren’t any instructors coming forward to advise Wu Lingling?

Normally, an ordinary God’s Domain Academy would be over the moon if even an ordinary superpower tried to recruit one of their students, let alone a transcendental power like the Secret Pavilion. These Academies would’ve frantically accepted the offer on their students’ behalf.

Yet, Jin Hai Academy’s side was seemingly filled with “eccentric” people. Even after hearing Wu Lingling refuse Purple Jade’s invitation, nobody from Jin Hai University had stepped forward to persuade the girl. On the contrary, every one of them looked at this situation as if they had expected it to happen…

Meanwhile, when Jin Hai Academy’s instructors and Lin Yaoyue saw the Secret Pavilion’s executives looking toward them, they couldn’t help but reveal bitter smiles.

If it was possible to change Wu Lingling’s mind, they would’ve long since done so. Unfortunately, Shi Feng seemingly possessed some unknown charm that had thoroughly captivated the little girl’s heart.

At this point, they had long since given up on influencing Wu Lingling’s decisions, choosing to let the girl decide her own future instead. It wasn’t a particularly bad decision to do so, either, since Shi Feng wasn’t as weak as he seemed. Otherwise, a senior instructor like Qi Lianshan wouldn’t have treated Shi Feng with such respect.

“How unfortunate. If you come across any problems in your training in the future, feel free to contact me.”

Purple Jade did not get angry after having her invitation rejected. Instead, she handed Wu Lingling her business card, her action causing many of the Secret Pavilion’s members present to grow envious. This was because they understood that Purple Jade wasn’t putting on an act. Instead, she was sincerely interested in Wu Lingling. After all, only a few people in the Secret Pavilion had Purple Jade’s contact method.

“Should I go and talk with Jin Hai Academy’s side, Commander? I believe that with the Secret Pavilion’s influence, that Shi Feng wouldn’t refuse our offer,” the burly man whispered to Purple Jade when he saw that Purple Jade appeared very interested in Wu Lingling.

A talent capable of catching Purple Jade’s eyes was incredibly hard to come by.

Although the Secret Pavilion’s Guild Leader had tried to get Purple Jade to teach the Guild’s geniuses in the past, Purple Jade showed no interest in those geniuses whatsoever. The Guild also couldn’t force her to teach them since she was one of the Guild’s Tier 6 God-ranked experts. It wasn’t until recently that Leili had appeared and caught Purple Jade’s attention.

Now that Purple Jade had shown interest in Wu Lingling as well, the Secret Pavilion naturally couldn’t let this rare opportunity get away.

“No need,” Purple Jade said, shaking her head. “Rather than that, I need you to look into Shi Feng. He definitely isn’t as simple as everyone thinks.”

“Huh?” The burly man couldn’t help but grow confused. “I heard from the other Academies’ instructors that Wu Lingling’s instructor is only the former Guild Leader of Shadow, a second-rate Guild. In addition, he had never even managed to reach Tier 4 during his peak, which was why Shadow’s Chairman had fired him.”

Instead of answering the burly man’s confusion, Purple Jade asked, “Do you think Wu Lingling is a fool?”

“How can that be? There’s no way she could have reached the seventh floor’s late stage at 16 if she were a fool,” the burly man answered strangely.

“Doesn’t that settle it, then?” After rolling her eyes at the burly man, Purple Jade put on a serious expression and said, “Moreover, there’s one more important reason I said that Shi Feng isn’t simple.”

“An important reason? Could it be that there is something special about him?” the burly man asked.

“It’s not him who’s special, but Wu Lingling instead. Her foundation is simply too solid. It is so solid that I can’t help but suspect that she isn’t a little girl, but an old monster who has lived for dozens of years!” Purple Jade said as she recalled Wu Lingling’s every action. “When I was talking to her just now, I noticed that she has incredibly precise control over her subtle movements. That kind of precision is something you would only find on someone who has already been at the Refinement Realm for over a dozen or several dozen years. Yet, despite having such precision control, the continuity of Wu Lingling’s movements was an utter mess, which is one of the main reasons recruits often have trouble entering the Refinement Realm.”

“Commander, are you saying that…” The burly man couldn’t help but shudder when the severity of Purple Jade’s words sank into his mind.

“That’s right. Either Wu Lingling has someone with godlike understanding over the Refinement Realm teaching her, or the girl is actually an old monster acting young before us,” Purple Jade calmly said. “However, no matter how I look at it, Wu Lingling is a teenage girl through and through. There is also no point for her to trick us since we can easily discern her actual age and identity through public records. In that case, that leaves us with only one possibility: her instructor’s understanding has already reached a godlike standard.”

“I’ll look into him right away.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After saying so, the burly man promptly left the underground training field, not daring to waste even a moment longer.

The Refinement Realm might not seem like anything special in the eyes of the various superpowers, which were capable of systematically nurturing their own Refinement Realm experts, but not all Refinement Realm experts were equal. Depending on how sturdy of a foundation a person built for themselves at the Refinement Realm, their future development would also change significantly. Only by having a sturdy foundation could one progress further and faster.

Unfortunately, helping players establish a sturdy foundation in the Refinement Realm was a challenge that troubled even the various superpowers. Even Domain Realm experts lacked the ability to help Refinement Realm experts develop their foundations.

This was because everyone had bad habits, and changing these habits was incredibly challenging. Moreover, even if a person managed to get out of a bad habit, parts of it would still linger in their subconscious. Meanwhile, the only known way to get rid of bad habits right now was to have players continuously train themselves to change and get used to the Refinement Realm over a long period. However, this process involved a lot of time, and time was money for the various superpowers.

Unfortunately, the only way they could streamline this process was if someone managed to achieve godlike understanding over the Refinement Realm and developed a perfect training system. If such a perfect system existed, new players could establish a solid foundation for themselves within a short period, saving them a lot of time in training and improving.

However, according to the Secret Pavilion’s knowledge, no Guild in God’s Domain possessed such a capability yet.

Indeed!

Not one Guild was capable of accomplishing such a feat! Even the Five Great Super Guilds were no exception!
