Chapter 480 – Him?!

Dark Star, Darkmoon City:

Upon entering the city, Xia Qingying led the group to a teleportation channel that facilitated rapid travel around the city. Then, using the teleportation channel, they arrived at the center of Darkmoon City less than a minute after they entered the city.

The Dark Star Auction House!

Darkmoon City was a vast place. It was more than ten times bigger than the Holy Cities found in the Greater God’s Domain. It could easily accommodate a population of one billion, and over a hundred million players entered and left the city daily.

Of course, only a tiny percentage of visitors were actual partners or guests invited by the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s executives. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that 99.99% of the players entering the city were people who had bought an entrance ticket through real-world channels.

The Dark Star Auction House could be regarded as Dark Star’s heart. It was a place that any player who entered Darkmoon City would visit at least once. Otherwise, they would have wasted a trip to Dark Star.

In the Dark Moon Auction House, one could find items commissioned by players originating from the Greater God’s Domain’s various Realms being sold. In addition, one could also see various competitive events in which the participants were all experts among experts. Some of these participants might even be experts who had caused a huge uproar in the Greater God’s Domain with their achievements.

Meanwhile, so long as one could obtain a sufficiently high ranking in these events, one could enjoy greater privileges in Darkmoon City.

The only problem was that one must become an official partner of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce before one would be eligible to participate in these events. Otherwise, one could only spectate from the side.

As it so happened, the test to become an official partner of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce was also held in the Dark Star Auction House.

…

Inside the arena on the Dark Star Auction House’s 100th floor…

Although the partnership test had yet to begin, the arena that could accommodate over 100,000 spectators was already packed with players.

“I’m looking forward to the test this time. Even though it’s only a basic partnership test, three of Eternal’s Elders are going to preside over it.”

“I know, right? You’ll usually only see Eternal sending three Elders for the advanced partnership test. If not for that peerless paragon from one of the Twelve Sanctuaries, the test this time would have probably had only one Elder presiding over it like usual.”

“Hahaha, the ticket I bought this time is money well spent! If there are going to be three Elders presiding over the test, I wonder how many people can pass the first round?”

Excitement filled the eyes of the spectators present as they looked at the three individuals standing in the middle of the stage.

The first round of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s basic partnership was a screening process in which participants would be put up against the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s representative. After all, God’s Domain was a place where might was right. Without sufficient strength, one could accomplish nothing. So, those seeking to become official partners of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce needed to have sufficient strength.

Of course, the bar of this initial screening wouldn’t be set very high. In past tests, participants only needed to last ten seconds against the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s representative. If they could survive ten seconds, they would proceed to the second and final round, where they would compete with each other for the limited partnership slots supplied by the Eternal Chamber of Commerce.

However, unlike past tests, where only one Elder would preside over the screening, the test this time would be presided over by three Elders. It went without saying that the initial screening’s difficulty had increased significantly.

“Quick, look! It’s the Divine Glory List’s Worldbreaking Axe, Untold Paths!”

“Crap! It really is him! If the Worldbreaking Axe is here, there’s no need to wonder who’s going to come in first place this time.”

“That’s right. I heard that he single-handedly obliterated a 100-man Tier 6 team from the Origin Conglomerate sometime ago. Even if his stats are suppressed to the Tier 4 standard right now, who here can possibly go up against him?”

There was a middle-aged man with unkempt hair standing in the middle of the stage, and he carried two large axes that radiated a blue glow. When the spectators spotted this middle-aged Berserker among the participants, their breaths became labored, and their faces became fanatical. It was as if they had just seen the god they revered.

As the cries of surprise among the spectator stands grew louder, many of the participants present also took notice of the middle-aged man in question.

The Worldbreaking Axe??Shi Feng couldn’t help but scrutinize the middle-aged man with messy hair.

There were three ranking lists that the Seven Luminaries Alliance periodically published across the entire Greater God’s Domain, and they were the Luminous Glory List, the Sacred Glory List, and the Divine Glory List. Of these three lists, the first two recorded talents of the younger generation. Only the Divine Glory List was different.

The Divine Glory List didn’t document budding talents. It only documented established powerhouses!

If one didn’t have the strength to contend against Tier 6 Gods, one couldn’t even qualify for the Divine Glory List. Meanwhile, during Shi Feng’s previous life, Untold Paths climbed to the 50th rank at his peak.

Moreover, this was only after taking into account the old monsters that were no longer active on the public stage. If these secluded monsters were excluded, Untold Paths could easily rank among the top ten of the Greater God’s Domain’s active Tier 6 experts. Even as an individual, he was an existence that the various apex powers had to take seriously.

…

While everyone’s attention was on Untold Paths, a large group of players arrived at the arena’s entrance. These players consisted of experts on the Luminous Glory List, experts on the Sacred Glory List, and participants with prestigious backgrounds.

At this time, though, every one of these individuals was walking alongside a young man clad in dark-gray leather armor, all of their attention focused on the young man.

Meanwhile, the instant this young man appeared, he instantly became the focus of everyone in the arena. Even the three Elders responsible for presiding over the test couldn’t help but take a look at him.

“So he’s Abyss Water? The rumored peerless paragon from one of the Twelve Sanctuaries?”

“No wonder the Scarlet Merchant Alliance is willing to let him become one of its Vice Guild Leaders. His presence alone is stronger than even Untold Paths. After seeing Abyss Water in person, I’m no longer sure who will be coming in first place in the test.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As the young man clad in dark gray surveyed the arena like an emperor surveying his domain, both participants and spectators felt their souls shuddering.

At the same time, many players present finally understood why the various apex powers and pseudo-apex powers coveted the Twelve Sanctuaries’ peerless paragons so much, even if these individuals didn’t have any amazing achievements.

The feeling Abyss Water gave off was akin to a machine created for slaughter. Moreover, his gaze did not look like one that belonged to a youth but an old monster who had lived for centuries already. It was incredibly sharp and penetrated deep into one’s soul.

Meanwhile, Xia Yingying couldn’t help but frown when she saw Abyss Water stepping onto the stage. This was because standing next to Abyss Water wasn’t just the participants of the upcoming test. There was also Wu Duanhen, whom Xia Qingying had ignored at the city’s entrance.

Currently, Wu Duanhen could be seen saying something to Abyss Water. In response, Abyss Water’s expression fell by several degrees as he turned to look at Xia Qingying’s group.

“These people have the nerve to mess with me? They must not know what death is!” Abyss Water said, his chilly tone causing the surrounding players to shiver.

The hostility shown by Abyss Water was apparent to everyone present. He also did not hold back his voice when he spoke. It was obvious he was indirectly hinting at the Eternal Chamber of Commerce to do something about this matter.

“Those people sure are pitiful, Boss Paths. With this, they probably won’t even get past the first round,” a hearty young man carrying a shield on his back said to Untold Paths, shaking his head as he looked at Xia Qingying’s group.

Many powers wished to befriend and recruit Abyss Water because of his status as a peerless paragon from one of the Twelve Sanctuaries. Even the Eternal Chamber of Commerce wouldn’t be an exception.

“Pitiful?” When Untold Paths heard the young Shield Warrior’s words, he looked toward Xia Qingying’s group of four out of curiosity, only to spot a familiar Swordsman among the group. Immediately, he used a Master-ranked Identification Skill on the Swordsman, and the result greatly surprised him as he exclaimed, “It’s him?! Why is he here?!”

“Him?”

When the young Shield Warrior saw the look of shock on Untold Paths’ face, he couldn’t help but follow the other party’s line of sight in confusion.
