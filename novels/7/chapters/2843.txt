2844 God“s Domain“s Black Flame

Chapter 2844 – God’s Domain’s Black Flame

“So, that’s why he dared to stand against Lu Tiandi! He’s the one responsible for Lu Xingluo’s removal! Lu Tiandi will probably have to tread cautiously around him.”

“Amazing! As expected of Black Flame! I never thought that he would be the person who received Grade 1 authority in Yuantian City recently.”

“This is interesting. It seems Lu Tiandi has met his match.”

...

Everybody present knew of Black Flame, but they did not know much about Black Flame’s identity in the real world. After all, they had many things they needed to handle. How could they possibly have the time to look into the real-world identity of every famous expert in God’s Domain? Only if they were particularly interested in a specific person would they spend some money to commission a detailed investigation.

Not to mention, Black Flame was someone who had never publicly declared his God’s Domain identity in the real world. This made it even more difficult to investigate his situation. Only superpowers that paid close attention to Zero Wing would know of Black Flame’s identity.

While most people did not know of Black Flame’s identity in the real world, it was a different story for the name Black Flame itself.

This name was far too well-known in God’s Domain. Not only was this name involved in many iconic battles in the game, but it was also behind the creation of many miracles. In fact, many of Black Flame’s battle videos had circulated through the various kingdoms’ and empires’ forums and were regarded as a paradigm for Swordsmen.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that almost every player operating on the eastern continent would know Black Flame’s name. Needless to say, residents of Upper Zones like themselves, who were expert players in God’s Domain, would definitely know of Black Flame.

Although Zero Wing started out as a Guild with no backing or background, it was now publicly recognized as a superpower. Compared to the various superpowers that had relied on powerful organizations to gain their strength, the influence Zero Wing had over the public was many times greater. In fact, Zero Wing’s influence over the virtual gaming industry almost rivaled the Five Great Super Guilds’ already.

Zero Wing had already become an absolute titan in God’s Domain!

Thus, Ji Luorong felt like she was dreaming when she looked at Shi Feng.

While the onlookers were discussing quietly among themselves, Lu Tiandi, who had been silently spectating the situation all this time, suddenly approached Shi Feng.

“It seems I have been impolite. I didn’t think that you would be Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame,” Lu Tiandi said as he looked at Shi Feng with a friendly smile. He also gave off an indescribably calm feeling, betraying no anger over Shi Feng having heavily injured his butler. “Hello, my name is Lu Tiandi, the current Guild Leader of Starlink. You have truly helped me a bunch by defeating Lu Xingluo, Guild Leader Black Flame. Otherwise, I would most likely have to expend a lot of time and effort to take over Starlink.”

“No need for thanks. You and I are not allies,” Shi Feng retorted nonchalantly.

Others might not know about Lu Tiandi, but Shi Feng had a very deep understanding of him.

This was because Lu Tiandi had been a well-known Tier 6 God-ranked expert in the past. However, he had not joined any Guild. Instead, he had led an adventurer team while working under Starlink.

Although Lu Tiandi appeared friendly on the surface, he was deep down a very conniving person. He had toyed with many powers in the past. These powers had worked for Lu Tiandi only to get backstabbed. For this reason, many superpowers had detested Lu Tiandi.

However, because of Lu Tiandi’s extraordinary strength and his Tremorous Clown adventurer team, one of God’s Domain’s Seven Great Dark Adventurer Teams, none of the various superpowers could do anything against him.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, must you be so unapproachable? Lu Xingluo and I are two different people. There are many people within the corporation who dislike Lu Xingluo for his overbearing and arrogant attitude as well. However, he is, after all, the Patriarch’s son. Even if others have an opinion regarding his behavior, nobody dares to say anything. Guild Leader Black Flame’s dragging Lu Xingluo off his pedestal is an event worth celebrating for the Starline Corporation,” Lu Tiandi said, chuckling. “Since Miss Ji is your friend, Guild Leader Black Flame, I will naturally stop trying to recruit her.

“Also, I have admired Zero Wing for a long time now. May I know if you are willing to form a partnership with me? To present Starlink’s sincerity in this partnership and apologize for my rudeness to Miss Ji, I can sell a large batch of Phantom Potions to you and Miss Ji at cost on behalf of Starlink. May I know what you think of this, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

At Lu Tiandi’s words, everyone couldn’t help envying Shi Feng.

The Phantom Potion was something the various major corporations coveted. Let alone at cost, they would even be willing to buy the Phantom Potion at double or triple the original price. After all, the importance of improving one’s mental strength trumped everything else in the Upper Zone.

Ji Luorong was tempted by Lu Tiandi’s offer. She currently held only Grade 2 authority in Haitian City’s Upper Zone. If she could acquire a few more Phantom Potions and improve her mental strength, she might reach Grade 1 authority. At that time, she would have a much easier time operating in the Upper Zone. After all, only around 300 people held Grade 1 authority in Haitian City’s Upper Zone, and the Green God Company placed heavy importance on every one of them.

At that time, even if a corporation in the Upper Zone wished to target her, they would face incredible difficulty. She also wouldn’t be tight for resources, as the tasks offered to Grade 1 authority holders would sometimes award Phantom Potions.

“Thank you for your goodwill, Guild Leader Lu, but Zero Wing already has its own collaborators. Currently, Zero Wing has no plans to cooperate with more Guilds, so there is nothing I can do about this,” Shi Feng said, directly rejecting Lu Tiandi’s offer. “If there is nothing else, we will be taking our leave now.”

“If that’s the case, then it truly is a pity.” Sighing, Lu Tiandi said, “If you have any intentions of forming a partnership in the future, feel free to contact me any time, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Shi Feng responded to these words with just a polite smile. He then turned around and left the training house together with Ji Luorong and Muxin.

The spectating crowd also dispersed, leaving Lu Tiandi and Yi Kui alone.

After the crowd dispersed, Yi Kui made a full recovery after consuming a Life Potion.

Looking at Shi Feng’s departing back, Yi Kui said in a quiet voice, “Young master, Black Flame is simply too arrogant. You already extended such a sincere invitation to him, yet he actually refused to show you any respect. It’s no wonder he managed to anger Lu Xingluo that much. Should I find an opportunity to teach that kid a lesson?”

Yi Kui was furious over Shi Feng’s successful surprise attack on him. Had he been a little more careful earlier, he definitely wouldn’t have suffered such a serious injury. Moreover, he had also noticed that Shi Feng looked a little pale after attacking him. Shi Feng had probably suffered a significant backlash from his own attack. If that were the case, landing a fatal blow on Shi Feng would have been entirely possible.

“I don’t know why, but he seems to be extremely wary of me, although this is clearly our first meeting. It seems it’ll be impossible to use him for our own purposes. If that’s the case, let’s teach him a small lesson. However, I’m afraid you alone won’t be enough,” Lu Tiandi said, shaking his head. “That Shi Feng actually managed to execute Miracle Dragon’s trademark move in the real world. Evidently, he has reached an incredibly high level in both his physical fitness and mental strength. It’ll be tough for you to take care of him by yourself. I’ll ask Brother Wang to accompany you.”

“You’ll have Mr. Wang come as well?” Yi Kui was momentarily surprised by Lu Tiandi’s words. However, he quickly revealed an ecstatic expression and said, “If this is the case, that kid is dead.”

The Brother Wang Lu Tiandi mentioned was a Henglian grandmaster who was only half a step away from becoming a mental strength master. He was also Lu Tiandi’s senior brother and a resident of the Upper Zone’s middle layer.

It would be child’s play for such an expert to take action against someone living in the base layer.

“By the way, when you head back, notify the others in the team to take action against Ji Luorong’s adventurer team immediately. Make sure to destroy them as quickly as possible,” Lu Tiandi instructed calmly. “Since I can’t have Ji Luorong’s adventurer team, there’s no reason why I should let Shi Feng have it!”

“Rest assured, young master. We have long since been keeping track of those people. If not for your love of talent, they would’ve been doomed already,” Yi Kui responded, smiling.

Nodding, Lu Tiandi then entered the mental strength training house.
