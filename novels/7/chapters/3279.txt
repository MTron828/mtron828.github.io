Chapter 354 – Who Is He?

Is he crazy?

When Jun Luosha saw Shi Feng taking the initiative to approach Saint Nine, she couldn’t help but try to stop him.

Jun Luosha might not have bothered if it were in the past since, back then, she still wasn’t aware of how strong Saint Nine was exactly. However, after seeing Saint Nine defeating Favra, a veteran titled expert[1], in one hit, she’d have to be a fool not to know how frighteningly strong Saint Nine was.

At this point, getting killed by Saint Nine could only be considered a small issue. If they ended up earning Saint Nine’s ire, they might not even be able to continue surviving in the Miniature Ancient World.

!!

The strength Saint Nine just displayed was already enough to upset the balance between the Miniature Ancient World’s various hegemonic powers. It was especially so now that the World Passage was opening soon. The various hegemonic powers would definitely try to befriend Saint Nine as much as possible.

So, if they were to offend Saint Nine now, one word from Saint Nine would be more than enough to erase Shi Feng and Wu Xiaoxiao from the Miniature Ancient World. Even the powers backing them might not be able to continue existing in the Miniature Ancient World.

However, before Jun Luosha could stop Shi Feng, Wu Xiaoxiao suddenly pulled her back and smiled, saying, “Don’t worry, Senior Sister. The Guild Leader is very strong.”

When Jun Luosha saw Shi Feng moving closer and closer to Saint Nine, she started to grow even more anxious.

Even if Shi Feng was strong, he shouldn’t be confronting Saint Nine to prove his strength!

Just when Jun Luosha thought of shaking off Wu Xiaoxiao’s hand, she suddenly discovered that she, a Swordsman, couldn’t shake off Wu Xiaoxiao, an Elementalist. Moreover, the flow of mana in her body had stagnated, and her body felt incredibly heavy.

“Xiaoxiao, you…”

After taking another look at Wu Xiaoxiao, Jun Luosha couldn’t help but feel as if she was looking at a completely different person. How was this supposed to be her cute junior sister? The other party felt more like a Legendary monster than a player right now.

…

While Wu Xiaoxiao was holding Jun Luosha back, Shi Feng continued making his way over to Saint Nine. He was aware that Wu Xiaoxiao wasn’t misbehaving just because she wanted to protect Jun Luosha. He knew that she was also trying to recruit Jun Luosha.

Geniuses nurtured by the Green God Corporation might be affiliated with the corporation, but the corporation did not restrict its talents from joining God’s Domain’s various powers. On the contrary, the corporation strongly encouraged such behavior. This was also why Jun Lusoha was not against Franz’s attempt at recruiting her.

As for Wu Xiaoxiao’s unilateral decision to recruit Jun Luosha, Shi Feng wasn’t against it.

Honestly, even if Wu Xiaoxiao didn’t take the initiative to provoke Saint Nine, Shi Feng had planned to intervene in this affair.

After all, the Desolate Star Corporation and Zero Wing were partners. Zero Wing had already earned a significant sum of Star Coins thanks to the Desolate Star Corporation’s Trade Center. So, even if Shi Feng didn’t have goodwill toward Franz, he still felt obligated to save Maria’s Aunt Favra.

…

On the other side, Franz hurriedly ran over to Favra’s side, took out a Healing Crystal, and shattered it above Favra. Then, streams of light-green mist flowed into Favra and quickly healed her back to peak condition. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Do we have any chance of escaping, Auntie?” Franz quietly asked Favra, fear evident in his eyes when he looked at Saint Nine.

Saint Nine’s strength had completely exceeded Franz’s imagination. Although he had long since known that geniuses capable of being regarded as paragons were much stronger than the average titled expert, he didn’t think Saint Nine would be strong enough to defeat a veteran titled expert in one move. Even a dozen titled experts working together might not be enough to take down an expert like Saint NIne.

However, titled experts were not cabbages that could be found everywhere. They were considered peak combatants even among the various hegemonic powers. In the Desolate Star Corporation’s case, despite how much importance the corporation had placed on the Miniature Ancient World, the corporation could only afford to dispatch six titled experts here to get a share of the World Passage’s opening rewards. If he and his Aunt Favra were to get killed here, it would be even more difficult for the Desolate Star Corporation to get a share of the opening rewards.

After all, based on the strength Saint Nine had just shown, he was most likely capable of heavily damaging the souls of those he killed. If that were the case, anyone he killed would be unable to log into God’s Domain for several days.

“It’s going to be difficult…” Favra said, shaking her head as she eyed Saint Nine warily. “He is already strong enough to fight against the God List’s top 3. Even if he is fighting someone else, he only needs to spare two attacks to eliminate us.”

That damned Calgaron! He must have made me provoke Saint Nine on purpose just now! Franz mentally cursed as he glared at the middle-aged Elementalist a short distance away. The Desolate Star Corporation and the Divine Will Corporation had fiercely competed with each other over the years, so it wasn’t out of the question for Calgaron to have planned such a trap.

“Franz! Don’t even think of getting away today!” Calgaron said, smiling when he saw the strong resentment in Franz’s eyes. “But don’t you worry. Once Lord Saint Nine takes care of that arrogant kid, it’ll be your turn next!”

When Calgaron finished speaking, the spectating crowd on the flying ship couldn’t help but sigh.

“It seems Desolate Star’s group is doomed this time.”

“Franz only has himself to blame for underestimating the experts on the God List. Not to mention, Saint Nine used to be one of the God List’s top 5 experts. Even after the various conglomerates’ geniuses officially stepped onto the Miniature Ancient World’s stage, he still managed to stay within the top 10. Every expert on the current God List is a titled expert. If Saint Nine can rank among the top 10 out of all these titled experts, there’s no way the average titled expert can be a match for him.”

“Indeed. Saint Nine used to be among the top 10 paragons of a kingdom in the Greater God’s Domain. The various corporations are willing to pay big money just to befriend such existences. Some corporations will even offer a director’s seat to recruit these paragons. That’s a privilege no ordinary titled expert can hope to receive.”

When the various hegemonic powers’ experts saw how powerless Franz was against Saint Nine, they came to learn just how frightening a paragon could be. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that one paragon was enough to go against an entire hegemonic power.

Just as everyone thought Saint Nine would put on another overwhelming performance, Saint Nine, who had been scrutinizing Shi Feng all this time, suddenly put his greatsword away. At the same time, his indifferent expression instantly changed into one of respect.

Before anyone could react to what was going on, Saint Nine quickly jumped down to the deck and walked up to Shi Feng. Then, putting on a friendly smile, he said, “It is a great honor to be able to meet you here, Sir. Would you grant me the privilege of buying you a drink upstairs, Sir?”

Saint Nine’s words instantly dumbfounded everyone present. Nobody understood why Saint Nine would suddenly have such a huge change in his attitude and behave so respectfully to the cloaked Swordsman approaching him. If they didn’t know any better, it looked as if Saint Nine had just met an existence he couldn’t afford to provoke.

Jun Luosha was similarly shocked to see Saint Nine behaving respectfully to Shi Feng. After combining this behavior with Wu Xiaoxiao’s previous words, she couldn’t help but turn to Wu Xiaoxiao and ask, “Xiaoxiao! Who is he?”

TL Notes:

[1]

Made a change to Chapter 353:

Original:

Originally, Favra was a widely known paragon during her era.

Edited:

Originally, Favra was widely known during her era.

…

It was mentioned in Chapter 270 that Favra was a veteran paragon, but I think the author has forgotten about that, and Favra is now only regarded as a veteran titled expert according to this chapter.
