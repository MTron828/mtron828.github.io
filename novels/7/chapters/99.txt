Chapter 100 - Go Ahead, If You Can

“Everyone, pay attention to your surroundings! Healers, stand in the middle! Protection Party, guard the healers! MTs, prepare to activate your lifesaving skills at any time! Dagger Party, prepare for battle!” Gentle Snow was not frightened by the situation. She immediately gave out commands, staying combat ready.

Haughtiness invites disaster; humility receives benefit.

This sentence just happened to be applicable to the members of Ouroboros. It was especially true for the arrogant Zhao Yueru.

Problems were bound to occur when one became complacent.

Only, the problems, this time, arrived somewhat too quickly.

Zhao Yueru, who was still relaxed, suddenly tightened her grip on her Crystal Staff. She was no longer acting cheerful or witty; her expression now turned solemn. She observed her surroundings for every little detail, revealing the unquestionable quality of an expert.

The other members of Ouroboros also no longer dared be careless. Although they were confident in their equipment, even possessing the confidence to overcome the Dark Moon Graveyard, this confidence still gradually faded after the two players were instantly killed. They could not help but become cautious and timid.

As for Shi Feng’s party, they were even more nervous. Inside their hearts, they were still considering themselves to be a bunch of noobs. Meanwhile, the elite members of Ouroboros before them were experts. Their techniques surpassed them by leaps and bounds.

However, such experts that wore top-tier Set Equipment still died an unfathomable death.

This Dark Moon Graveyard was just too horrifying!

Seeing everyone in such a panic, Shi Feng remained incomparably calm. As for what actually happened, nobody had a better understanding of it than him, or rather, he long since predicted such a situation.

Since Dark Moon Graveyard had a lower difficulty, depending on equipment and some experts, it was easy enough that it could be relaxingly cleared. However, in Shi Feng’s previous life, an unknown number of Guilds fell to the dungeon over and over, to the degree of cursing someone’s mother. Based on the strength of Gentle Snow’s team, they would still be able to clear the Dungeon, even after being team-wiped over a dozen times. Only, the price to pay for such an action was very high.

“Something’s coming. MTs, pay attention,” Shi Feng warned. He squinted his eyes, looking towards the fog that floated nearer.

Everyone abruptly tensed, looking over.

“What’s that?” The Shield Warrior discovered a blurry figure inside the mist.

The figure was hidden inside the murky fog, preventing anybody from getting a clear look at it. The team only knew that the thing was gradually wobbling closer, step after step, crawling as slow as a snail. As the distance between the two sides shortened, the wails of anguish became louder, causing all those present to have goosebumps.

Just when the figure was about to leave the fog...

“MTs activate your lifesaving skills!” Shi Feng yelled. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, the Shield Warrior paid no attention to Shi Feng’s words.

He had always looked down upon Shi Feng in his heart. The last time they met, Shi Feng was just a noob who got lucky. Shi Feng was only able to attract their leader’s attention because he familiarized himself with God’s Domain ahead of time. Although Shi Feng was currently reached Level 6, he had definitely depended on his familiarity with the Quests and monsters in order to level up so quickly. He did not truly possess strength.

Even if Shi Feng’s skills were good, the number of experts Ouroboros had recruited over the years from other virtual reality games exceeded five thousand. They were not lacking people such as Shi Feng at all. In other words, within Ouroboros, there were plenty of players that were much better than Shi Feng.

Although the Shield Warrior did not pay attention to Shi Feng’s words, the Guardian Knight, Cola, had always trusted in Shi Feng. He had, at the first instance, activated Protection Blessing on himself.

Just as the figure within the fog was about to reveal itself, two black rays of light shot out from the fog, reaching the MTs on the frontlines in the blink of an eye.

These two rays of light were as swift as bullets. The bulky MTs had no way of dodging them.

At that moment, Gentle Snow only shouted, “MTs, use your lifesaving skills!”

Unfortunately, Gentle Snow was still one step behind.

One of the black rays immediately pierced the Shield Warrior’s body, a damage of -1,600 appearing above his head. He was killed instantly.

The Shield Warrior’s eyes affixed to his chest where the black ray penetrated, unwillingly passing on.

Meanwhile, after activating Protection Blessing, the damage Cola received reduced by 50%. In addition to the Secret-Silver ranked Sky Armor that he received from Shi Feng, Cola only received slightly more than -500 damage, losing slightly more than half of his HP.

Everyone was dumbfounded after seeing this. A Level 5 MT wearing Bronze Set Equipment died, just like that.

Meanwhile, more figures started appearing out of the fog.

When Gentle Snow recalled the terrifying black rays from before, she immediately commanded, “Healers, heal! Everyone retreat. Guardian Knight, cover everyone else’s retreat. Anybody with a Defense Skill, pay attention and protect the Guardian Knight.”

Hearing Gentle Snow’s commands, Cola hesitated slightly. He turned to look at Shi Feng, intending to wait for Shi Feng’s command.

“Retreat then. Pay attention to your positioning and maintain a straight line with the people behind,” Shi Feng nodded his head.

After receiving Shi Feng’s orders, Cola immediately took action.

Seeing such a scene, Gentle Snow felt slightly upset in her heart. However, she did not voice it.

On the other hand, Zhao Yueru was not as willing. A noob like you, instead of listening to Snow’s commands, you actually listened to that lucky dog shit’s words? Was he trying to imply that the Snow Goddess’ strength and commands weren’t as reliable as Shi Feng’s?

However, just as Zhao Yueru was about to open her mouth, she immediately snapped it closed.

That was because, while Cola was retreating, he was actually able to simultaneously use his shield to block the black rays that fired towards the other players. He was even able to dodge the attacks of the black rays while, at the same time, retreating in an orderly manner. Such a feat was absolutely impossible for a fresh noob to accomplish. His skills were even better than their own Shield Warrior’s by a thread.

With four healers healing him, Cola was able to maintain his HP above the safety line. During the occasional desperate moments, Shi Feng would use Parry to help Cola block the black rays, allowing Cola to retain his life.

Such scenes caused the members of Ouroboros, who had been previously dissatisfied with Shi Feng, to have a change of heart. They questioned whether they were able to carry out such actions. Moreover, Shi Feng rescued Cola multiple times now, proving that it was not just a coincidence, but skill.

As long as Cola did not die, the remaining team members would remain safe. It could be said that Shi Feng was holding onto the lives of the entire team.

“It would seem...that I have still been underestimating him.” Gentle Snow started viewing Shi Feng in a different light. Although she, too, helped Cola block some attacks, her actions were not as natural and pleasant as Shi Feng’s. He was capable of blocking the attacks while not hindering Cola’s movements.

After everyone retreated some distance, they were finally able to clearly see the figures within the fog.

They had gigantic bodies with the height of two people. Their arms were both equipped with black, metallic claws. When they attacked, their claws were like swords shooting forth and sheathing quickly after, all within a blink of an eye.

[Kobold Zombie] (Special Elite)

Level 6

HP 5,000/5,000

Just a single Kobold Zombie was headache to them. However, there were a total of six Kobold Zombies that appeared from the fog. Such numbers practically demanded their lives. To make matters worse, a group of Kobold Warriors also appeared in their path of retreat.

Everyone finally understood the difficulty of a Team Dungeon. Its difficulty was practically over ten times that of a Party Dungeon.

“We’re finished,” Zhao Yueru felt despair in her heart when she saw the number of Elites and Special Elites, “How are we supposed to fight this many Elites and Special Elites? Moreover, they have both ranged and melee to cooperate with each other.”

The other team members similarly agreed with Zhao Yueru’s opinion.

“Is there no way for us to pass through?” Gentle Snow creased her brows. She was unwilling to just leave the Dungeon like this.

At that moment, Shi Feng opened his mouth, saying, “If we utilise the terrain properly and cooperate well with each other, it is not entirely impossible.”

The members of Ouroboros felt displeasure in their hearts when they heard Shi Feng. He was wholly mocking the inability of Gentle Snow’s commands.

“Easier said than done. Who would know how to deal with this many Elites and Special Elites? Go ahead, if you can,” Zhao Yueru sneered, looking at Shi Feng with disdain.
