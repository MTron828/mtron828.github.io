Chapter 353 – Do You Dare to Come Forward?

Although Saint Nine spoke calmly and only several people nearby could hear him, Franz’s complexion paled when he heard Saint Nine’s words.

In reality, Saint Nine didn’t have a powerful personal background. He had relied entirely on the Twin Saints Alliance’s resources to grow to his current strength. When it came to status and background, there was no question that Franz was overwhelmingly superior to Saint Nine.

However, the problem was that they were currently in the Miniature Ancient World, a place where even the strongest players were only at Tier 4. In this place, Saint Nine was akin to a walking disaster for the various powers.

Under normal circumstances, Franz wouldn’t have feared Saint Nine at all. At worst, he would die once.

!!

However, the World Passage was opening soon. If Franz got killed on the flying ship, he’d essentially have to say goodbye to the World Passage’s opening rewards.

It should be known that the main reason players and powers from outside the Miniature Ancient World came to this world was so that they could acquire the World Passage’s opening rewards, and Franz was no exception.

“Do you take the Desolate Star Corporation for a pushover, Saint Nine?”

While Franz was in a state of panic, the masked lady standing behind Franz suddenly spoke up.

After saying so, the lady with a pair of enchanting silver eyes waved the silver staff she wielded and merged three Tier 4 Spells into one. Immediately afterward, over 200 blades made of bone-chilling flames appeared around Saint Nine and struck at him, each of these soul blades leaving behind a fiery silver chain in their wake.

Every soul blade carried power at the Tier 5 standard, and the number of soul blades the lady summoned had already gone far beyond the maximum number of attacks Tier 4 players could react to simultaneously. Moreover, the silver chains the soul blades created continuously reduced the space available for Saint Nine to maneuver around.

“Auntie! You succeeded?!” Franz grew ecstatic when he saw the soul blades and silver chains surrounding Saint Nine.

The masked lady was none other than Favra, the Tower Alliance’s Great Elder. At the same time, she was Maria and Franz’s aunt.

Originally, Favra was a paragon widely known during her era. However, she had long retired from the public eye, so not much information was known about her nowadays. People only remembered her title of Silver-eyed Witch. Hardly anybody knew that Favra was researching how to combine three Spells, in other words, triple fusion magic, to unleash strength above her tier.

Now, though, his Aunt Favra had succeeded!

Meanwhile, the fusion of three Tier 4 Spells would result in power that could overshadow even Tier 5 Spells!

However, before Franz could relax, he suddenly heard Saint Nine speaking:

“You are still not qualified to be my opponent!”

Before Franz realized it, Saint Nine had vanished from before him and reappeared in front of Favra, his greatsword held in his hands. Then, Saint Nine swung his greatsword at Favra.

Boom!

Bright silver light enveloped the flying ship’s third floor, and everyone idly stared at the light as if time had stopped moving.

When the light faded, only a broken magic barrier remained in Favra’s original location. As for Favra herself, she had crashed into one of the flying ship’s sails, her silver mask shattering and her HP bar having little to nothing left.

How is this possible?! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

This scene dumbfounded Franz and his bodyguards, none of them daring to believe this to be true.

One strike!

Saint Nine had executed only one attack, yet this one attack had instantly killed Favra, the Tower Alliance’s Great Elder and the Silver-eyed Witch whose name once shook the Starlight Realm.

If not for the silver mask Favra wore, allowing her to evade death once, she wouldn’t even be alive right now.

The God List’s rank 10 is this powerful?

Following this situation was a question that appeared in not just Franz’s and his bodyguards’ minds but also the minds of many young geniuses on the ship.

In everyone’s minds, Saint Nine might be ranked 10th on the God-ranked Expert List, but he was still only a titled expert. Meanwhile, Favra was similarly a titled expert. Even though she was a little older, she remained in her peak condition. So, everyone assumed there wouldn’t be too huge of a gap between them.

Yet, reality couldn’t be any further from that.

If Saint Nine could instantly kill even a titled expert, wouldn’t it be child’s play for him to kill ordinary fourth-floor experts?

Moreover, if Saint Nine could only rank at 10th place on the God List despite being so strong already, how frightening were the God List’s other top 10 experts?

“Now that she’s dealt with, it’s your turn next!” Saint Nine said as he raised his greatsword and turned to look at Franz and his bodyguards.

Suddenly, Franz and his bodyguards felt as if they could hear death’s footsteps. It felt as if death was already waving at them.

The Desolate Star Corporation’s Second Successor?

Titled expert?

At this moment, all of these things had become nothing but a joke, and it was all because they weren’t aware of how monstrous Saint Nine was.

In the meantime, Calgaron gleefully watched all this happening from one side. His rivalry with Franz had been going on for some time now, so he couldn’t be happier to see Franz’s demise.

At the same time, Calgaron finally understood why the various hegemonic powers were reluctant to offend paragons, even when these paragons were at a low tier. Paragons, particularly top-ranking paragons of the Greater God’s Domain’s various countries like Saint Nine, were simply inhuman.

It might be a little far-fetched to say that Saint Nine could go up against 1,000 fourth-floor experts of the same tier, but it was definitely possible for him to go up against 100 fourth-floor experts and win. Meanwhile, just the thought of a paragon like Saint Nine reaching Tier 6 gave Calgaron goosebumps.

Anyway, with the current situation, the Desolate Star Corporation had essentially lost its chance of acquiring the World Passage’s opening rewards.

“Xiaoxiao, get ready to run with your party! It’s no longer safe here!” Jun Luosha said when she saw Saint Nine raising his greatsword against Franz, a bitter smile forming on her face. “Saint Nine can probably rival the God List’s top three with his current strength. If he decides to get ruthless, nobody on this ship can live to see the Thunder Fortress.”

However, in response to Jun Luosha’s anxiety, Wu Xiaoxiao shook her head and calmly said, “Saint Nine is indeed strong, but you don’t need to be so anxious, Senior Sister. We are very safe here. So long as the Guild Leader is around, Saint Nine can’t harm us in the slightest.”

Although Wu Xiaoxiao didn’t speak loudly, everyone on the flying ship was a Tier 4 player. In a quiet environment, a Tier 4 player could hear a person’s normal speaking voice even from several hundred yards away. So, even though Wu Xiaoxiao was only speaking normally, everyone aboard the ship could hear her words.

Meanwhile, upon hearing Wu Xiaoxiao’s words, Saint Nine suddenly stopped his attack against Franz. Then, he turned to look at Wu Xiaoxiao, a cold glint in his eyes.

“What a big mouth you have there, little girl!” Calgaron said, laughing. “But will that so-called Guild Leader of yours dare to come forward and show himself to Lord Saint Nine?”

As soon as Calgaron finished speaking, Jun Luosha couldn’t help but hold her head.

Her junior might be good at many things, but it would seem that she was terrible at reading the room. With this, not only were Franz and his bodyguards finished, but even they were doomed as well. It was especially true for the Guild Leader whom Wu Xiaoxiao mentioned. That person most likely wished to choke Wu Xiaoxiao right about now.

However, behaving as if she wasn’t aware of the mess she had just created, Wu Xiaoxiao turned to look at the cloaked Swordsman sitting nearby and fawningly said,

“Guild Leader! I’ve joined Zero Wing already, so you can’t just watch me make a fool of myself!”

“…This will be the only exception!”

After letting out a sigh, the cloaked man stood up and began making his way up to Saint Nine.
