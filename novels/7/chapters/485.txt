Chapter 486 - Generous Benefits

Inside the Adventurer’s Association, Shi Feng was currently applying to establish a Forge inside Zero Wing’s Guild Residence.

“Sir, this is the model list for Smithies. In addition, there is also a list of Blacksmiths; you may choose any of the names listed there,” the NPC at the counter smiled as she passed two lists to Shi Feng.

In God’s Domain, buildings were not limited to a single model; there was a large variety of models available for players to choose from. Players could even design their own buildings, though designing one from scratch required a lot of time. If not for highlighting the uniqueness of one’s own Guild, most players would choose one of the hundreds of models that were already available.

Promotion of buildings only required a Promotion Order; there was no need to spend any money. However, constructing a new building or reconstruction required a large sum. Depending on the size of the building, the materials required, and the building’s function, the price of construction would vary.

A Guild’s Smithy was extremely important. Hence, Shi Feng needed to decide carefully.

Smithies were differentiated by three grades: Ordinary, Refined, and Luxury. Though the price of each Smithy was higher than the last, each grade was also more efficient.

Ordinary Smithies cost between 100 Gold and 200 Gold. Aside from repairing weapons and equipment, Guild members could also sell their unwanted items to the NPCs at the Smithy.

Refined Smithies cost between 300 Gold to 500 Gold. Aside from having all the functions of an Ordinary Smithy, Refined Smithies had a more refined and luxurious appearance. Refined Smithies also had a Weapon Maintenance function. If a player left their weapon in the Smithy’s care, its Durability consumption rate would drastically reduce for a period. At the same time, one could also hire Intermediate Blacksmiths if they had a Refined Smithy.

One should not underestimate the function of Blacksmiths. These Blacksmith NPCs all possess different capabilities. For example, some Blacksmiths might take less time than others to repair weapons and equipment; other Blacksmiths’ might produce stronger maintenance effects. Hence, hiring a powerful Blacksmith was of utmost importance.

Lastly, Luxury Smithies cost between 800 Gold and 1,000 Gold. Aside from having all the functions of a Refined Smithy, Luxury Smithies had a Rest Area that allowed Guild members to accumulate the Double EXP buff. However, 48 hours of rest was required to accumulate 20% of the buff. In addition, Luxury Smithies contained Forging Rooms. Moreover, these were Advanced Forging Rooms, which were far more effective than those at the Starstreak Trading Firm. One could also hire Advanced Blacksmiths.

“For the Guild’s future development, we’ll get the most benefits from the best option. Let’s choose this 1,000 Gold model, then.” After looking through the model list, Shi Feng chose one of the largest Luxury Smithies available that allowed him to invite up to 10 Blacksmiths. After deciding on the model, he began to choose his Blacksmiths.

Shi Feng had received 700 Gold from the system reward alone. In addition, he also received over 300 Gold for each Dragonscale Set Equipment that sold at the Blackwing Auction House. At this point, he had already sold more than 20 sets. Currently, Shi Feng had more than 8,000 Gold on his person, making him wealthier than any single Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom. Moreover, Gold would continue to fill his bags as more sets of Dragonscale Set Equipment sold. So, he did not mind constructing the best Smithy available.

Following which, Shi Feng chose to hire ten Advanced Blacksmiths. These ten NPCs were the most skilled Blacksmiths one could currently find. Their monthly wages ranged between 3 and 5 Gold.

After Shi Feng finished dealing with the Smithy, he searched for a secluded location to adjust his appearance back to Ye Feng. He then hailed a horse carriage and returned to Zero Wing’s Guild Residence.

When Shi Feng arrived at the Residence, he discovered a sea of players crowding the entrance, creating an extraordinarily lively atmosphere.

There were currently two Berserkers in Dragonscale Set Equipment standing guard and maintaining order at the Residence’s entrance. The Fine-Gold rank glow from the sets thoroughly awed the players who had come to sign up for the Guild.

“Is that a Fine-Gold Set Equipment?”

“I’ve seen it on the forums before. I think it’s the Dragonscale Set Equipment. Currently, a single set costs more than 300 Gold. Zero Wing is just too rich; they actually bought two sets!”

“Not just two. I hear that Zero Wing’s Warehouse also has one set available for trade.”

As the crowd discussed Zero Wing’s wealth with astonishment, the newly-constructed Smithy also attracted their attention.

The Smithy’s construction was not as tedious as the Guild Hall’s. The Smithy required much less time as it had fewer functions. As long as the Guild paid the construction fees, the Smithy could be completed in less than ten minutes.

Zero Wing’s Smithy was three stories tall. The Smithy’s Luxury-grade appearance dazzled the onlookers, and many among the crowd even believed that they had arrived at the capital city’s Advanced Smithy. The Smithy was large enough to accommodate several hundred players, and it was even larger than an Ordinary Guild Hall.

“This is my first time seeing such an extravagant Smithy!”

“Zero Wing isn’t giving Overwhelming Smile any chance of survival! Zero Wing’s Smithy is almost the same size as Overwhelming Smile’s Guild Hall! It’s so much fancier than their Guild Hall, too!”

“From what I heard from Zero Wing’s Guild members, this Smithy even has a Weapon Maintenance function that reduces the Durability consumption rate of a weapon for a certain amount of time. With this, who knows how much money we can save when grinding monsters and raiding Dungeons?”

“For this Guild Smithy alone, I’ll do anything it takes to join Zero Wing.”

The independent players who had come to participate in Zero Wing’s test watched the Guild’s transformation with reverence, their desire to join Zero Wing intensifying.

Morale among Zero Wing’s members soared when they saw the growing flood of players coming to join their Guild. Now, whenever they strode down the streets with their six-winged Emblem revealed, they would receive countless envious stares.

Standing a short distance away from the Residence’s entrance, Thoughtful Rain quickly noticed Shi Feng’s arrival. Waving her hand, she shouted, “Ye Feng, we’re over here.”

Shi Feng promptly walked over.

Standing beside Thoughtful Rain was the expert who Shi Feng was extremely familiar with, Everlasting War.

However, though Shi Feng knew about Everlasting War in the past, the reverse was not true. The five companions by his side were also outstanding experts. In the past, Shi Feng had lived in an entirely different world from them. He had failed to reach even the upper ranks of God’s Domain, much less the pyramid’s peak.

“Ye Feng, let me introduce you. This man is Everlasting War; he wishes to discuss business with you,” Thoughtful Rain slowly introduced Everlasting War’s party to Shi Feng.

At this moment, Everlasting War was shocked after evaluating Shi Feng.

The pressure he felt from Shi Feng was intense!

He had not expected Zero Wing to possess another unfathomable expert besides Black Flame.

“Hello, I am Ye Feng,” Shi Feng said, smiling faintly at Everlasting War. “This place isn’t suitable for a discussion. Why don’t we head inside to chat?”

Saying so, Shi Feng led the group into the Rest Area in the Guild Residence’s Smithy.

The Rest Area was very elegant. Even having beverages available for Guild members, this Rest Area was no less impressive than the city’s restaurants.

“Wah! Is this really a Smithy?” Trailing after Thoughtful Rain, Blue Bamboo’s eyes shone brightly as she entered Zero Wing’s Residence. It was as if she had just stepped into an entirely different realm. Secretly, she said, “Rain, look! That’s the Weapon Maintenance Room! There are such high-quality weapons inside! Even the Blacksmiths are the rarely-seen Advanced Blacksmiths! Rain, make sure you say something to Ye Feng later! With such awesome Guild benefits, it would be a huge shame if we didn’t join!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
