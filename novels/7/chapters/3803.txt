Chapter 3804 - 878 - Royal Power?

Boom!

A deafening explosion resounded throughout the library. For a moment, the light in the hall disappeared. Then, a full moon rose, returning peace to the world.

In the blink of an eye, the first-floor hall became a dark void, and standing in the middle of this void were Shi Feng and Kowloon Demon. Although there was a huge level gap between the two, with Shi Feng being Level 212 and Kowloon Demon being Level 240, Kowloon Demon was the only one to sustain damage in the second exchange, his HP falling by 5%.

Guild Leader Black Flame won? Heiser couldn’t believe her eyes.

It was obvious that Shi Feng had yet to reach the sixth-floor standard. Yet, in a clash with Kowloon Demon, a bona fide sixth-floor expert, he had emerged superior.

We won? 

Xiao Yilong was dumbfounded when he saw that only Kowloon Demon received damage. He couldn’t help but grow excited.

Although this was only the second exchange, it should be virtually impossible for Kowloon Demon to kill Shi Feng in the third exchange unless he shamelessly fought using his full Basic Attributes. Thus, their party had effectively won the agreement.

Meanwhile, Whirlwind Bulwark and the other Pale Horn members gaped at this situation.

“Aren’t we in the library?!”

“Is Guild Leader Black Flame really only Level 212?”

Rather than the clash between a sixth-floor expert and a non-sixth-floor expert, Pale Horn’s members were more surprised by the destruction Shi Feng caused. Nightmare Holy City’s library was the sturdiest structure in the city. Even Level 235-plus players fully equipped with Level 235 Fragmented Legendary items could only create some cracks, at most, when they attacked the library.

Yet, Shi Feng, despite being a Level 212 player, had turned the entire first-floor hall into an empty void. They didn’t even dare to imagine what would happen if his attack struck them.

“Who are you?”Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After noticing the loss of his HP, Kowloon Demon couldn’t help but stare at Shi Feng as if the other party was a monster. His voice when he spoke was also filled with confusion; his calm composure was nowhere to be seen.

“Haven’t I already told you?” In response to Kowloon Demon’s question, Shi Feng chuckled and said, “We come from another region.”

“Another region? Do you take me for a fool?” Kowloon Demon glared at Shi Feng, not believing the other party’s words in the slightest. “While there might be many experts in other regions, none have someone like you. Despite not being a sixth-floor expert, you managed to overpower a sixth-floor expert. Not to mention, you don’t even know the rules of this region and the surrounding regions.”

There might be experts stronger than him in other regions, but they were all well-known experts. If a fifth-floor expert could overpower a sixth-floor expert with similar Basic Attributes, this person would be a legendary existence known by all.

However, Kowloon Demon had never heard of Shi Feng.

“Rules? What rules?” Shi Feng looked at Kowloon Demon curiously.

According to Whirlwind Bulwark, there shouldn’t be any unspoken rules in Nightmare Holy City. Had there been any, Dawn Forest, the Guild Leader of the Holy Knights, would have informed Shi Feng about them when trying to befriend him. Yet, Dawn Forest hadn’t. This meant that none of Nightmare Holy City’s players knew the rules Kowloon Demon spoke of.

Suddenly, Kowloon Demon took out a silver Tier 6 Divine Rune Scroll and unfurled it before Shi Feng. Immediately afterward, a translucent silver barrier enveloped Shi Feng and Kowloon Demon, isolating them from the outside world.

Shi Feng was surprised to see the translucent silver barrier.

Dimensional World was a lost Tier 6 Divine Runic Curse in the Greater God’s Domain. Only Primordial God-ranked existences could destroy the barrier it created within a short timeframe. Even if South Lake, Holy Dragon Spear’s Great Commander, were here, he would need at least a day of nonstop attacking to break it. As for Magic Scrolls that held the Dimensional World Spell, they were extinct in the Greater God’s Domain.

“Nobody outside can hear us now, so let’s be frank,” Kowloon Demon said sternly. “Before you make up any stories, I will have you know that Dragon’s Crown, the royal power I come from, controls the Nightmare Holy City Region and the several hundred regions around it. No player outside of the Nightmare Holy City Region doesn’t know Dragon’s Crown.”

“A royal power?” Kowloon Demon’s words momentarily stunned Shi Feng.

As far as Shi Feng could recall, there were no royal powers in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. Not even the mysterious Seven Luminaries Alliance had reached the standard of royal powers. It was barely strong enough to contend with the Holy Race’s royal powers.

However, Kowloon Demon claimed that this remnant primordial world concealed a human royal power.

Moreover, the information Kowloon Demon revealed about the remnant primordial world was frightening. It should be known that Nightmare Holy City’s players were already shockingly strong. Yet, there were actually hundreds of regions like it in the remnant primordial world.

Although Nightmare Holy City wasn’t filled with fifth-floor experts, many of its inhabitants were experts who had mastered Gold Combat Techniques. There were over 10,000 such experts in the White Dragon Nation alone. Yet, Dragon’s Crown controlled hundreds of other city regions like the Nightmare Holy City Region. It definitely wasn’t an exaggeration to consider Dragon’s Crown a royal power. It could absolutely compete with the Holy Race’s royal powers.

“That’s right. Dragon’s Crown is one of the only two royal powers in God’s Domain. This is something all players outside know.” When Kowloon Demon saw the surprise on Shi Feng, he couldn’t help asking in confusion, “Only native players of the Nightmare Holy City Region would be ignorant of this information. But you’re not from Nightmare Holy City, so who are you people?”

Shi Feng didn’t know how he should answer Kowloon Demon’s question.

After pondering for a moment, Shi Feng ventured awkwardly, “Would you believe me if I said I come from another world?”
