Chapter 153 - Legendary Item

After attracting Faust’s attention, Shi Feng’s remaining task was to deal damage to the Golden Fish.

These Level 20 Golden Fish currently swam within the bright silver river suspended in mid-air. The river was around 25 to 30 yards above the ground, making it impossible for any normal melee class to attack the Golden Fish. Moreover, the Golden Fish had scales as hard as diamonds, and it was nigh impossible for players below Level 20 to cause them over 100 damage in a single attack.

The Golden Fish possessed a very high magic resistance as well, reducing the magic damage they received by 40%. Also, the Golden Fish swam at exceptionally fast speeds in the silver river, making them extremely hard to hit.

As a result, there were many players who gained nothing despite having found the Star River Valley.

One thing that greatly differed God’s Domain from other virtual reality games was that, in God’s Domain, there were many of fortuitous encounters available out in the field. These encounters could allow a player to soar to fame and power overnight, and Shi Feng had seen many such examples before.

However, even though there were plenty of fortuitous encounters available in God’s Domain, encountering one did not necessarily guarantee any harvests. Whether one could obtain anything from such an encounter depended on one’s abilities.

“Blackie, Lonely, you two take this.” Shi Feng took two Basic Frost Grenades from his bag, passing them to the two.

Previously, to obtain the Ice-Blue Devil Flame, he used a lot of the Frost Grenades he stocked up. Right now, there were less than twenty remaining, and they were not enough to deal with all the Golden Fish in the silver river.

“Wah! Aren’t these Frost Grenade’s effects too powerful? These are godly tools for PK and grinding! If we could use them without limit, then our leveling speed would be absolutely heaven-defying!” Blackie said, shocked, after taking a look at the Frost Grenade’s introduction.

Just imagine if they used these Frost Grenades to grind on groups of Level 30 monsters... They might even level up once every minute! At that time, what would Martial Union amount to them? Just the level suppression alone would be enough to oppress them to death.

“It would be fantastic if we could get more of these. In the future, if PKers surround us, we wouldn’t even have to use a single skill to deal with them. Just by throwing a dozen or so of these Frost Grenades, they would definitely fall dead. However, with effects as good as these, I’m guessing that these items should be extremely rare and precious,” Lonely Snow lamented.

“Indeed. Not to mention using them for grinding and PK, just having a few of these tools of massacre as lifesavers would be good enough.” The longer Blackie looked at the Frost Grenade in his hand, the more he could not bear to part with it. With this item in hand, he could use it to save his life at the most crucial of moments.

Shi Feng only revealed a smile at the two’s reactions. He took out another Frost Grenade for himself, turning to look at the Golden Fish in the suspended river, saying, “Stop chatting. In a moment, I’ll count down to three, and we’ll all throw our Frost Grenades at the Golden Fish together.”

Blackie and Lonely Snow looked at the Frost Grenades in their hands, reluctance filling their eyes.

“Brother Feng, using the Frost Grenades to deal with these Golden Fish is just too wasteful. The Golden Fish have 100,000 HP each. The 200 damage from these Frost Grenades will not make any difference. Moreover, these items can be used at a crucial moment to save our lives. Using them right now is simply a waste!”

“That’s right, Leader!”

Blackie and Lonely Snow both tried to persuade Shi Feng. His actions right now were simply that of a wastrel!

Shi Feng was dumbfounded and speechless at the two’s persuasion.

Previously, he had used these Frost Grenades to grind to Level 9.

“Just use them with ease! I still have plenty of them in my possession. Later, I’ll give every member of the party 30 of these Frost Grenades,” Shi Feng said with a laugh.

Blackie and Lonely Snow were immediately shocked, even thinking that they had heard wrong. A Frost Grenade was such a precious item, yet, Shi Feng planned to give each of them 30 in the future? This was simply madness! In the future, if they met those bastards from Martial Union, with the Frost Grenades in hand, couldn’t they utterly massacre them?

With Shi Feng’s assurance, the two of them followed Shi Feng’s instructions, throwing their Frost Grenades at the Golden Fish suspended in mid-air.

Boom! The Frost Grenades exploded in the midst of the silver river. Even though the Golden Fish were adept at dodging, the explosion radius of the Frost Grenades was extremely wide. Some of the Golden Fish that did not manage to escape immediately froze solid, damages of over -100 points appearing above their heads.

Faust, sitting suspended in mid-air, stroked his white beard. He nodded his head, saying, “Not bad. It seems that you guys have some ability, to actually cause some damage to these Golden Fish.”

“Esteemed Lord Faust, we are only here to catch some Golden Fish to cook. We hope that our brutish actions did not disturb you,” Shi Feng acted courteously as he said.

“Oh? I didn’t think that you guys would be interested in cooking these Golden Fish,” when Faust heard the word ‘cook,’ a flash immediately appeared in his eyes. “Since you guys wish to catch the Golden Fish, I wonder if you can help me catch some live ones as well? My strength is too strong, and I will simply kill these Golden Fish if I am not careful. This dilemma has left me with no choice but to slowly fish here.”

“This...” Shi Feng said with a hesitant expression.

“Relax; I won’t mistreat you all. As long as you can obtain a satisfactory amount of Golden Fish for me, I can trade some items for them. How about it?” Faust casually waved his hand, and immediately, tens of items with pleasing appearances appeared and floated in mid-air.

Every single one of these tens of items was extremely valuable. Moreover, beside the item’s introduction, the amount of Golden Fish required to trade for the item was displayed as well.

“Brother Feng, look! That’s a Level 15 Secret-Silver ranked staff! There! That’s a Mysterious-Iron ranked mage robe! Wah! That’s a Fine-Gold ranked cloth armor armguard!” Blackie instantly drooled at the sight of these items.

Lonely Snow also discovered a Level 15 Fine-Gold ranked two-handed axe, his eyes sparkling at the sight of the weapon. Moreover, the Attributes of the weapon were simply mind-blowing. If he equipped that weapon, his Attack Power would instantly soar by several times. He could get rid of an MT of the same level with just two to three attacks.

However, amongst the many items, an item with a faint orange glow attracted Shi Feng’s attention. That was the glowing effect only found on Legendary ranked items!

“A Legendary ranked item?” Shi Feng was shocked.

Previously, he had only heard of players obtaining an Epic item at most from the Star River Valley. Shi Feng had even doubted the reliability of the information. Now, however, it seemed that the information was indeed true.

The rarity of a Legendary item was several tens of times greater than that of an Epic item. If a Legendary item were already present among the rewards, it would not be strange for there to be an Epic item as well.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, even after he reached Level 200 and became a top-tier Sword King, he did not possess a single Legendary ranked item. To Shi Feng, a Legendary ranked item was but a fleeting dream. Only the extremely few Tier 4 apex experts would possess one or two Legendary items. It was obvious just how rare a Legendary item was.

Meanwhile, these players who possessed one or two Legendary items, even if they were only at the peak of Tier 4, their battle prowess would not be any weaker than a Tier 5 player that did not possess any Legendary items. It was apparent just how much of an improvement a Legendary item provided to a player’s strength.

Shi Feng did not think that, in this life, he would bear witness to a Legendary ranked item. This situation was no different than a dream.

It was not just Shi Feng who discovered the Legendary ranked item. Even Blackie and Lonely Snow noticed it, as the orange glow that the item gave off was simply too eye-catching.

“Brother Feng, I’m not dreaming, right? That’s a Legendary ranked item, right!?” Blackie pinched his own cheeks, saying. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Meanwhile, Lonely Snow was speechless from excitement. He kept clapping Blackie’s shoulders as he pointed towards the Legendary item.

“You guys are not hallucinating. That is indeed a Legendary ranked item. It is also something that I chanced upon. However, this item is useless to me. Although it is possible to obtain this item if you want it, it won’t be so easy,” Faust stroked his beard as he said with self-satisfaction. He felt extremely satisfied by the shocked expressions of Shi Feng and the others.

At this time, Shi Feng had calmed down. Although a Legendary item was right before his eyes, obtaining it was an entirely different matter. As for snatching the item away from Faust, that would be no different than suicide.

They could only follow the rules to obtain it.

Shi Feng then clicked to look at the Legendary item’s introduction.
