Chapter 302 – Legendary Hundred Refinement Mana Body

…

“My price stands at 11,000 units! Take it or leave it!” the old man said as he looked at Midsummer. Then, he snickered and continued, “If you don’t decide now, I might choose not to sell it afterward. At that time, you won’t be able to buy it even if you want to.”

“Let’s go, Brother Black Flame.” Midsummer turned to Shi Feng when she heard the old man’s words. “This old bastard’s clearly playing us for fools.”

NPCs in the Greater God’s Domain were no different than real people. Moreover, the higher an NPC’s tier, the more intelligent they would become.

There were many instances of players getting scammed by high-tiered NPCs in the Greater God’s Domain. There were even some NPCs that had a bounty put on their heads by upper-ranking hegemonic powers.

Meanwhile, the old Great Wizard before them clearly had some kind of Skill or Spell that allowed him to see how many Seven Luminaries Crystals players carried, and he was trying to take nearly all of their Seven Luminaries Crystals.

“You have a deal. If you want 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, you can have them.”

Despite Midsummer’s words, Shi Feng had agreed to the old man’s price without hesitation.

Midsummer naturally wasn’t wrong to cast suspicion over the old man’s intentions, more so after the old man before them had already shown himself capable of seeing the amount of Seven Luminaries Crystals they carried. Any normal player would have definitely turned around and left in such a situation, even if they were initially interested in purchasing the Battle Arena.

However, Shi Feng had personally seen and visited the Hundred Refinement Building during his previous life, so he was certain this shabby Battle Arena was a Hidden Construction in reality. Although the price was different from what he heard, so long as he could purchase the Hundred Refinement Building, he didn’t care even if he had to pay an extra 1,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.

“Brother Black Flame?”

Shi Feng’s decision dumbfounded Midsummer. Wu Xiaoxiao was similarly at a loss for words.

......

With 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, Shi Feng could buy even a large-sized Battle Arena in the city center of the Ancient River Kingdom’s royal capital, let alone a shabby Battle Arena on the outskirts of Gazing Moon City.

Even if Shi Feng owned a Primal Ore Vein, such behavior was simply too extravagant…

“Good! I like your courage and decisiveness, young man!” The old Great Wizard was similarly surprised by Shi Feng’s answer. However, he quickly smiled and nodded approvingly. “But I’ll be taking too big of a loss if I give this Battle Arena to you for only 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. If you truly wish to buy it, these 11,000 units will only be enough to serve as a deposit. On top of these 11,000 units, you’ll have to pay me another 89,000 units within a month. Then, I will give you the core key. I will not be returning your deposit if you cannot pay the remaining 89,000 units. Do you dare to accept this offer?”

As soon as the old Great Wizard finished speaking, the sound of a system notification entered the trio’s ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have triggered the Legendary Quest Hundred Refinement Mana Body.

Quest Content: Gather an additional 89,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal within one month.

Rewards: The complete Hundred Refinement Building. Penalties unknown.

System: Do you accept the Hundred Refinement Mana Body Quest?

…

A Legendary Quest?

When Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao saw the system notifications, their mouths gaped in shock, and they couldn’t help but turn to look at Shi Feng.

Legendary Quests were incredibly rare and elusive even in the Greater God’s Domain. Although Legendary Quests came with great risks, the rewards they offered were also incredibly lucrative, so much so that they could be of great help to even Tier 6 titled experts.

Yet, now, Shi Feng had triggered a Legendary Quest just by purchasing a dilapidated Battle Arena. This was simply unbelievable.

Was the Hundred Refinement Building back then incomplete?

At this moment, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao weren’t the only ones shocked by this situation. Even Shi Feng himself was greatly surprised.

He had never heard about the need to complete a Legendary Quest to purchase the Hundred Refinement Building during his previous life. The Midnight Tea Party had purchased it directly after spending only 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal. There was also no need to doubt the validity of this statement.

During his previous life, he shared a good relationship with the Midnight Tea Party. Hence, there was no need for the adventurer team to lie to him, especially not after they had already purchased the Hundred Refinement Building. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Not to mention, Zero Wing owned one of the top 10 Hidden Constructions back then. It was vastly superior to the Hundred Refinement Building, which only ranked 39th out of the Starlight Realm’s 99 Hidden Constructions.

“Have you made your decision, young man?” the old man calmly asked as he looked at Shi Feng. “I will only make this offer to you once. If you give up on it, I will not offer it to you a second time.”

“Okay, I accept.”

Shi Feng nodded and handed the old man 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.

Although he wasn’t sure what kind of abilities the complete Hundred Refinement Building possessed, he was in urgent need of the Hidden Construction’s services right now. Otherwise, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao couldn’t even get through the upcoming Rookie Competition’s preliminaries.

“Excellent.” After counting the Seven Luminaries Crystals in his bag, the old man smiled and nodded, saying, “Now that I’ve accepted your deposit, I won’t keep you in the dark anymore. The Hundred Refinement Building, that is the real name of this building. It is one of the 99 constructions that have existed since the Starlight Realm’s birth. The Hundred Refinement Building has two floors, and you can only enter each floor twice in your life.”

Twice per lifetime? Two floors? Shi Feng was stunned when he heard the old man’s explanation.

During his previous life, the Hundred Refinement Building that everyone knew about only allowed players one entry in their lifetimes. Moreover, the Hundred Refinement Building only had one floor. There did not exist a second floor.

Setting aside the second floor, just the opportunity to enter the first floor two times was already beyond incredible. After all, even titled experts could benefit significantly from using the first floor’s services once. If they could use the first floor for a second time, they could absolutely achieve a qualitative improvement.

It should be known that the difficulty of developing a Mana Body would increase exponentially the further one progressed. Because of this, 100 simulations weren’t enough to push their Mana Bodies to the next level.

In general, 100 simulations were only enough to help players elevate their Mana Bodies by only half a level. However, if players could receive 200 simulations, raising their Mana Bodies to the next level wouldn’t be out of the question.

“The Hundred Refinement Building’s first floor is the basic layer. It can only help you simulate your Mana Body’s development 100 times,” the old Great Wizard said. “The second floor is the core layer. It can help you simulate the creation of a Mana Body 100 times. If you cannot pay up the remaining 89,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal within a month, I will take back the Hundred Refinement Building. I hope you can keep this in mind.”

After saying so, the old Great Wizard suddenly took out a bronze key out of nowhere and handed it to Shi Feng.

“This is the basic layer’s key. You will have complete access to the base layer with this key. As for the core layer’s key, that will have to wait until you gather enough Seven Luminaries Crystals for me.”

…

System: You have accepted the Legendary Quest Hundred Refinement Mana Body.

System: Congratulations! You have acquired a shop in Gazing Moon City. You are now officially in possession of noble status in Gazing Moon City. You will not have to pay the entrance fee when entering Gazing Moon City. You may live permanently in Gazing Moon City. You may grant up to ten players the right to live in Gazing Moon City for free permanently.

Despite hearing the system notifications, Shi Feng did not move his eyes to them. Instead, he focused his gaze on the bronze key in his hand.
