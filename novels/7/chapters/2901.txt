Chapter 2902 – Power of Tier 6

When Shi Feng brandished the Light of Two Worlds, a dazzling brilliance replaced the dark clouds overhead, and the sky itself descended to the ground. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of deafening explosions rang through the forest, the effects of Shi Feng’s attack stupefying Sky Fox and the others.

With just one attack, Shi Feng destroyed all of the Outerworld players’ Offensive Spells, as well as the magic barrier protecting the Outerworld players. Only after destroying several more Defensive Spells did the brilliance Shi Feng’s attack generated begin to dissipate. However, the areas Shi Feng’s attack passed through were now devoid of Mana.

Moreover, the resulting shockwave was so powerful that it reached Sky Fox’s party several thousand yards away, sending the six players smashing into trees and stifling their breath.

Isn’t he a little too powerful?!

Sky Fox and the others were at a loss for words as they looked at Shi Feng.

All of them could tell that Shi Feng’s attack wasn’t a Skill but a combat technique. Nevertheless, he had managed to destroy all of the Outerworld players’ Offensive Spells and most of their Defensive Spells.

“Even the Tier 5 Imperial Knight I saw previously wasn’t this strong!” Blade Heart exclaimed. “Is this the strength of God’s Domain’s strongest player?”

Everyone in God’s Domain had already gotten a clear look at Shi Feng’s power during the battle at Ancient Rock City. However, compared to that time, the power Shi Feng had just displayed was on a whole other level.

The Tier 4 Combination Defensive Spells the Outerworld players used rivaled Tier 5 Defensive Spells in power. Even Tier 5 NPCs needed quite a few attacks to break through a Tier 5 Defensive Spell.

Yet, Shi Feng had destroyed multiple Tier 5 Offensive and Defensive Spells with just one attack. Such power was beyond even Tier 5 NPCs.

Shi Feng was practically a God who had descended to the mortal world.

Black Flame, is it? Fighting spirit ignited in Blade Heart’s eyes as he looked at Shi Feng. I’m going to become as strong as him one day!

At this time, Sky Fox’s party wasn’t the only one shocked by Shi Feng’s display of power. The millions of Outerworld players were similarly thunderstruck.

“What?! Why does this world have such a powerful player?!”.

“He must be a Demigod NPC in disguise! Even a Tier 5 player can’t destroy so many large-scale Defensive Spells!”

Unlike God’s Domain’s players, the Outerworld’s players had a considerable understanding of Tier 5 existences. This was because there were already some Outerworld players who had attempted to get promoted to Tier 5. Many superpowers had also clashed against Tier 5 Legendary monsters before, with some even succeeding in slaying one.

As far as the Outerworld players knew, Tier 5 players could only hold their ground against Legendary monsters. They couldn’t solo one. Even experts at the Tier 5 Peak standard couldn’t. With so many Tier 4 players working together, they could heavily injure even a Tier 5 Legendary monster, let alone a Tier 5 player. Hence, what just happened was simply unbelievable. However, unlike most of the Outerworld players, the superpower executives in charge of the army reacted much more calmly to this situation.

“As expected of our primary target this time. I can see why Hundred Ghosts is so afraid of him that they did not send anyone over this time,” the four-meter-tall man serving as the army’s general said in commendation as he observed Shi Feng’s hovering figure. No sooner had the giant man finished speaking than the female Elf standing beside him said nonchalantly, “He might be strong, but he’s facing the Weeping God Army now! He still isn’t qualified to fight us alone!”

Nobody present rebutted the female Elf’s words. Some of them even revealed excited expressions.

Nine player armies had crossed the World Passage this time, every one of them established by the various superpowers. The Weeping God Army was one of these nine armies, and heading it was Land of Gods, one of their God’s Domain’s Seven Great Guilds, with the support of four other superpowers. And out of the nine player armies, the Weeping God Army ranked third in strength.

The reason behind the Weeping God Army’s name was its successful slaying of an Ancient Demigod, an existence far stronger than even Tier 5 Legendary monsters. This brilliant achievement was also why the Weeping God Army had accepted the task of taking down Zero Wing’s supporting kingdoms.

“Alright. Although it is a little early, we’ll summon the Nine-headed World Snake,” the general said. He then turned to the female Elf surrounded by dense bloodlust and said, “Wind, join the fight with your group as well. Let this world’s natives know our power!”

Land of Gods had brought out their precious Nine-snake Summoning Array to let all of God’s Domain’s forces know of its power. This summoning array was also the main reason the Weeping God Army had managed to slay an Ancient Demigod.

However, one had to pay a colossal price for each use of the summoning array, and it could be used only four times. Moreover, controlling the Nine-headed World Snake summoned was incredibly challenging. The task required nine players with excellent control over Mana and one player with remarkable control over their physical bodyin other words, an existence at the Beyond Domain Realm. Anyone weaker than that would have difficulty controlling the World Snake’s gigantic body. The female Elf named Nightmarish Wind nodded and led nine Tier 4 experts with incredibly powerful Mana Domains to the summoning array. All ten of them then jumped into the illusory nine-headed snake’s body.

Immediately, the illusory nine-headed snake grew more tangible. Its size also increased.

In just three seconds, the nine-headed snake’s body, which originally measured around a hundred meters in length, had grown to a thousand meters. Each of its nine heads had also enlarged to the size of mountains. Moreover, each of these heads now held mastery over a particular magical element, and they could independently cast Spells of their respective element. “Black Flame! I heard you’re this world’s strongest player!” Nightmarish Wind, who was hidden inside the World Snake’s translucent body, sneered when she saw Shi Feng still standing his ground. “Unfortunately, you’re not going to leave this place alive today!”

After saying so, Nightmarish Wind had the World Snake fly toward Shi Feng. The power its body exuded was so strong that the space in its path shattered. Simultaneously, the World Snake’s nine heads cast nine different Tier 5 Spells and launched them at Shi Feng.

This scene made Sky Fox and his team shudder in fear.

The current Nine-headed World Snake radiated a much more powerful aura than before, so much so that it felt like a completely different creature. Even the Tier 5 NPCs they had come across previously couldn’t compare to this monster. Meanwhile, in front of the World Snake, Shi Feng looked like an ant, as if the World Snake could wipe him out of existence with a single swipe of its tail.

The simultaneous bombardment of nine Tier 5 Spells was something even several Tier 5 NPCs working together would fail to stop.

However, even after seeing the World Snake’s attack, Shi Feng remained unfazed.

He simply raised the Light of Two Worlds once more and swung it at the World Snake.

World Breaker!

Boom!

For an instant, everyone on the battlefield felt the world around them disappear. Apart from an empty space filled with light, they could neither see nor feel anything around them.

Everyone gradually recovered their senses, and once they did, they couldn’t help gaping in shock, their minds going blank. Gone!

The Nine-headed World Snake is gone!

Moreover, the Nine-headed World Snake wasn’t the only thing that disappeared. A significant part of the vast forest had also disappeared, and in its place was a crater over 4,000 yards in diameter, with the endless void in its depths. From the sky, it would seem as if something had just taken a bite out of the Shadow Forest.

This sight rendered every surviving member of the Weeping God Army speechless. Even the army’s general couldn’t bring himself to say anything for a long time.

After all, Shi Feng’s strike didn’t kill just the Nine-headed World Snake but also over a quarter of the Weeping God Army.

After falling into a daze for over a dozen seconds, the Outerworld army’s general inhaled deeply and yelled with all his might, “Run! Everyone, run immediately! He’s no longer human!”

This shout snapped the Weeping God Army’s surviving members out of their daze, and they began scattering and fleeing frantically. As for the general himself, he took out a Tier 4 Instantaneous Movement Scroll and teleported out of the area immediately. He had no intention of lingering for even a moment longer.

Meanwhile, when Shi Feng looked at the vast abyss in the middle of the forest, he couldn’t help sighing ruefully.

No wonder Tier 6 players rarely fought on the main continent. If two Tier 6 players clashed, they could probably erase an entire empire from the continent.

World Breaker wasn’t an AE Skill. Even so, it had still wreaked such damage on the Shadow Forest’s terrain. This was something Shi Feng never expected.

After dealing a devastating blow to the Outerworld army, Shi Feng showed no interest in hunting down the fleeing players. That would simply be too tedious. Moreover, his attack had killed at least 70% of the Outerworld army’s Tier 4 players, allowing him to level up to Level 174. It was easy to surmise just how many Tier 4 and Tier 3 players he had killed.

Meanwhile, players killed by a Tier 6 attack wouldn’t be able to log into the game for some time. Even if a Tier 6 attack didn’t specifically target the soul, it would still cause significant damage to souls. Hence, players killed by Tier 6 attacks would get barred from the game for some time, and their souls would fall into a weakened state for five or six days afterward.

Shi Feng flew back to the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship and returned to Sky Spring City, leaving behind the fleeing Outerworld army and the stupefied members of Sky Fox’s party in the Shadow Forest.

“Commander, what should we do?”

“What else can we do? Hurry up and spread this information! We’ll most likely need to rely on Zero Wing for this War of Worlds!”
