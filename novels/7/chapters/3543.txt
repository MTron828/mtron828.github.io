Chapter 618 – Fear and Panic

“Tier 6?!”

“They’re Tier 6 players!”

“Seventeen Tier 6 players?! How is this possible!?”

The moment the amalgamation of Divine Might washed over the Holy Race experts, they all fell into a daze as their minds started to doubt the reality of their current situation.

Tier 6 players!

Whether it was for the human race or the Holy Race, Tier 6 players were existences who had secured a hold over the laws of the world. Hence, it was extremely difficult for players to get promoted to Tier 6.

In the current Eternal Realm, most experts wouldn’t dare to attempt the Tier 6 promotion unless they were confident in success. This was because failure to get promoted would force players into a long state of rest, and it would be a considerable amount of time before they could make their next attempt. By the time they recovered, other experts would have long surpassed them, and they would be forced to retire from the Eternal Realm’s main stage. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Not to mention, the energy resources required to challenge the Tier 6 promotion were immense. Even for the Holy Race, they could only afford to let a few people challenge the Tier 6 promotion.

Yet, it was now revealed that among the human team consisting of only a little over thirty members, seventeen of them had actually gotten promoted to Tier 6 already?

Who could possibly accept this situation?

Even if all seventeen humans were the weakest Tier 6 players in existence, they would still be considered a frightening force in the current Nameless City. They would be more than enough to go up against their legion of 1,000.

Not to mention, these seventeen human players weren’t by any means weak for Tier 6 players. On the contrary, they were far above the average, each being stronger than Tier 6 Divine monsters of the same level. After all, simply the act of these seventeen players releasing their Divine Might was enough to affect their entire legion’s mobility. This situation was no different than if they were to go up against the Holy Race’s Tier 6 experts.

Impossible! How can the humans have seventeen Tier 6 players?! The Beast Berserker, the Holy Race legion’s commander, was similarly dumbfounded as he looked at Azure Shadow’s group in the distance.

Even until now, none of the Holy Race’s various powers had managed to produce a Tier 6 player. Meanwhile, according to their investigation, the human race should be faring even worse than them.

Yet, now, seventeen Tier 6 human players had appeared on the Western Continent, which was supposed to be the Holy Race’s home ground…

Am I dreaming?

Billowing Water, who had prepared herself to fight to the death, couldn’t help but rub her eyes as she looked at Azure Shadow’s group. She felt that she must be dreaming.

It was currently the goal of the Eternal Realm’s various powers to produce a Tier 6 player as soon as possible. But according to the information she received, even the various apex powers had yet to accomplish this goal.

So, the only explanation she could come up with for this situation was that she was in a dream.

“The Holy Race’s experts, huh?” Azure Shadow revealed a look of excitement as he gazed upon the Holy Race experts before him. “Just in time. I can use you all to test my improvements.”

After saying so, Azure Shadow nocked his longbow and launched a series of arrows into the sky. At the same time, a magic array covering a 1,000-yard radius formed in the sky.

Tier 6 Skill, Stars From Heaven!

Azure Shadow had heard from Shi Feng the strength of the Holy Race when they first arrived at the Nameless City. Hence, he wasn’t ignorant of the circumstances surrounding the Holy Race. Under the same tier, human experts would have difficulty competing against Holy Race experts. Tier 5 Holy Race experts capable of using Holy Aura could even transcend tiers to fight Tier 6 human players.

Based on his senses, he could tell that the team leader-ranked Holy Race players before him were undoubtedly such experts. If he were to clash with any one of these team leaders when he first arrived at the Nameless City, their fight would be intense, and it would take him a considerable amount of time to kill them. If several of these team leaders attacked him simultaneously, he might even be in danger of losing his life.

Now, though, these party and team leader-ranked Holy Race experts were no longer a threat to him or his companions. Instead, these Holy Race experts had become the most suitable targets for them to familiarize themselves with their newfound strength.

Meanwhile, the instant the magic array in the sky finished forming, countless space-rending arrows began to rain down from the sky, the spatial tears they left in their wake creating a scene resembling the arrival of the Apocalypse.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Countless explosions echoed in the Nameless City’s core region, the explosions lasting for ten whole seconds before coming to an end.

When the dust clouds created by the arrow rain scattered, they revealed a desolate wasteland amidst the tall buildings decorating the Nameless City’s core region. As for the Holy Race experts who previously populated the street, their numbers had been reduced from a thousand to less than a hundred, and even the ones still standing looked incredibly miserable.

Have I become so powerful already? Azure Shadow couldn’t help but be taken aback by the devastation he caused.

His original intention for using Stars From Heaven was to break the Holy Race experts’ formation so his teammates could pick off the stragglers. This was the tactic they normally employed when fighting against groups of players or monsters. After all, each arrow in Stars From Heaven only carried 70% of his Strength. It was only because of the Skill’s large number of projectiles that it could pose a certain degree of threat to Tier 6 experts.

Yet, the effects of his Stars From Heaven vastly surpassed his expectations. Despite being an ordinary Tier 6 Skill, it achieved a result surpassing even that of Tier 6 Curses cast by Tier 6 Mage Gods. Each arrow exhibited power at the Tier 6 Peak standard. For a moment, he even suspected he could threaten a Tier 6 God’s life with this Tier 6 Skill.

“Are you on drugs, Azure? How in heaven did you do that?” Dawn Arrow, another Ranger from the Night Watch battle group, asked in astonishment.

Stars From Heaven was a common Tier 6 Skill of the Ranger class. Hence, Dawn Arrow was very familiar with the Skill’s capabilities. Normally, the Skill would only be enough to tickle Tier 6 Divine monsters and damage Tier 5 Legendary monsters slightly. While it might be more effective against players, it shouldn’t be anywhere close to being life-threatening to the Holy Race experts.

However, it was a completely different story for Azure Shadow’s Stars From Heaven. In Azure Shadow’s hands, the Skill performed no differently than the Tier 6 Curse Star Blast. Had Azure Shadow used this move outside the Eternal Realm, he might even be able to delete an entire map.

“What kind of drug do you think I would have to take to get such an effect?” Azure Shadow answered, rolling his eyes. “Also, we train and operate together all the time. What don’t you know about me?”

“This won’t do! I’m going to try it as well!” Dawn Arrow said before copying Azure Shadow in using Stars From Heaven.

Meanwhile, as soon as Dawn Arrow used his Skill, the surviving Holy Race experts couldn’t help but despair.

Each arrow they previously faced carried power at the Tier 6 Peak standard. Normally, even a Divine monster would become heavily injured after being rained upon by so many such arrows. They only managed to survive the projectile bombardment because they had used all of their Lifesaving Skills.

Yet, as soon as they finished surviving the rain of arrows, they had to face it again?
