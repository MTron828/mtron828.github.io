2848 Uproar

Chapter 2848 – Uproar

At the entrance of the Sixth Southern District...

Ten minutes have gone by already. Looking at his quantum watch, Yi Kui smiled in delight. Mr. Wang should be taking action right about now.

Yi Kui did not doubt Wang Xuanming’s strength in the slightest.

If not for the Enforcement Robots being too powerful, Yi Kui would’ve wanted to spectate the fight at a close distance and see how terrified and helpless Shi Feng was against Wang Xuanming.

After all, a neutralizing grandmaster like Shi Feng would be utterly incapable of resisting Wang Xuanming’s strength. The most he could do was run away.

Once Shi Feng was taken care of, dealing with Ji Luorong would become a lot easier.

Just as Yi Kui was entertaining such thoughts, a loud noise suddenly came from the residential area.

Has he started taking action?

Yi Kui grew excited when he heard the noise, and he couldn’t help taking a few steps toward the residential area. Although he knew that the most he would see from his location was Shi Feng’s building, this was more than enough. He was only curious to find out how many seconds Shi Feng would last against a monster like Wang Xuanming.

Three seconds?

Or perhaps four seconds?

Based on the strength Shi Feng had displayed previously, Yi Kui admitted that the younger man was indeed stronger than himself. However, if it came down to an all-out fight, he would have a great chance of victory. After all, Henglian grandmasters did not possess just incredible defensive capabilities but also recovery abilities far superior to the average person’s.

Yi Kui might’ve suffered significant damage from Shi Feng’s palm strike, but he had also recovered from the injury very quickly.

One could say that the only advantages Shi Feng had over the average Henglian grandmaster were speed and destructive power. However, in front of Wang Xuanming, these advantages would be negligible. Hence, Shi Feng would probably last against Wang Xuanming roughly as long as an average Henglian grandmaster would.

After leaving his hiding spot, Yi Kui immediately noticed Wang Xuanming charging into Shi Feng’s house. Wang Xuanming’s speed was so fast that Yi Kui didn’t even catch a clear sight of him.

However, two seconds after Wang Xuanming disappeared into the house, he actually reappeared at the entrance.

He’s done already?!

Yi Kui was dumbfounded when he saw Wang Xuanming back at the entrance of Shi Feng’s house. He never thought that Wang Xuanming would be so powerful as to end the fight in just one second. With such strength, calling Wang Xuanming a monster wouldn’t be an exaggeration at all. Wang Xuanming was on a whole different level from Henglian grandmasters like himself.

However, in the next moment, Yi Kui was stunned once more.

A woman wearing a light-blue nightgown had actually appeared before the entrance without him realizing it. Meanwhile, as if agitated by this woman’s appearance, Wang Xuanming promptly launched a flurry of punches at her.

Even from several hundred meters away, Yi Kui could clearly sense the terrifying aura Wang Xuanming exuded.

Madness!

Violence!

Destruction!

Nobody could possibly survive Wang Xuanming’s chaotic punches.

Has he lost his mind? Yi Kui was horrified.

If Wang Xuanming had simply taught Shi Feng a lesson and landed the latter in the hospital for several months, the Green God Company wouldn’t look too deeply into the matter. At most, it would strengthen the residential area’s security and give Shi Feng some compensation.

However, if Wang Xuanming took a life in the Upper Zone, he would touch the Green God Company’s bottom line. At that time, the company would definitely conduct a thorough investigation into the matter until it found the culprit. Once Wang Xuanming was caught, even the big shots living in the middle layer wouldn’t be able to help him. In fact, he might even drag down Lu Tiandi and Yi Kui as accomplices.

However, before Yi Kui could recover from his shock, he received yet another jolt. This time, his eyes nearly fell out of their sockets.

This was because the woman dressed in a nightgown actually remained unscathed despite facing Wang Xuanming’s flurry of punches. She even moved closer and closer to Wang Xuanming and eventually planted a palm on his chest.

The instant the woman’s blow landed, Wang Xuanming actually stumbled two steps back and clutched his chest in pain. He also stared at the woman before him with fear in his eyes.

Who is she? Why did such a monster appear in Shi Feng’s house?

Yi Kui was shocked and confused as he looked at Aqua Rose, who stood in the corridor outside Shi Feng’s house. He even rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating.

Wang Xuanming, an incredibly powerful Henglian grandmaster, had actually lost to a frail woman.

As Yi Kui gaped in shock, Wang Xuanming added to Yi Kui’s confusion by charging forward and attacking Aqua Rose once more. He actually showed no signs of trying to escape from another location.

However, Yi Kui quickly noticed that another woman of extraordinary beauty had walked out of the house. This woman was similarly dressed in a snow-white nightgown and had silky black hair flowing down to her waist. Under the illumination of moonlight, she looked just like a goddess that had descended to the mortal world.

Although this woman did not exude an imposing aura, the indifference in her eyes combined with Wang Xuanming’s strange behavior allowed Yi Kui to guess what was going on.

Most likely, the woman behind Wang Xuanming was a monster as well. Hence, he did not choose to enter the house and break out from another location.

After all, if Wang Xuanming were to fight inside the more spacious house, he would have to face those two monstrous women simultaneously. No matter how powerful Wang Xuanming was, he definitely wouldn’t have any opportunity to escape under such circumstances. Hence, he could only choose to fight in the narrow hallway and risk a pincer attack.

However, contrary to Wang Xuanming’s expectations, Gentle Snow had no intention of double-teaming him. She simply stood aside and quietly looked at the broken door, appearing quite bothered about it. In other words, the broken door seemed much more important to Gentle Snow than Wang Xuanming was.

On the other side, Aqua Rose treated Wang Xuanming’s series of desperate attacks as if they were child’s play. Not only did she evade all of them effortlessly, but she also landed another palm strike on Wang Xuanming, aggravating his injuries.

Their clash continued for four seconds. At this point, Wang Xuanming could no longer stand steadily, so weakened that even a Henglian grandmaster could go up against him. Trying to escape in such a condition was a luxury he couldn’t afford. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Before Wang Xuanming could launch another round of attacks against Aqua Rose, the alerted Enforcement Robots finally arrived at the scene.

After distinguishing everyone’s identities, the Enforcement Robots promptly took Wang Xuanming into custody. Once arrested by the Enforcement Robots, even a Henglian grandmaster would have no chance of putting up a struggle.

As Yi Kui watched Wang Xuanming’s capture, he noticed Gentle Snow walking out of the house and looking in his direction.

Fear seized Yi Kui’s mind, and goosebumps rose all over his body. He instinctively turned around and fled immediately.

She shouldn’t have seen me. I was so far away, and I even had my aura concealed. Even if she’s a monster, she shouldn’t have discovered me.

Yi Kui reassured himself this way as he fled. He repeatedly told himself that he was merely imagining things.

Only after Yi Kui had left Yuantian City’s Upper Zone did he finally calm down from receiving Gentle Snow’s attention.

That was too damned scary! How can such a monster exist in this world?! Chills crawled down Yi Kui’s back when he recalled Gentle Snow’s indifferent gaze. I need to have the young master report this matter to the higher-ups immediately! Those monsters aren’t things we can offend! Those two women simply aren’t human!

...

As Yi Kui was fleeing Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, Xia Qingying, the base layer’s general manager, arrived at Shi Feng’s residential area together with several supervisors.

“Who’s the fool who would actually dare assault someone in a residential area?” Luo Hanbin frowned as he looked at the broken door before him.

It had already been several years since a home assault had happened in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. The previous occasion had greatly angered the Green God Company. Although the victim had sustained only heavy injuries, not only had the offender gotten banished from the Upper Zone forever, but he was even imprisoned for ten years once outside.

Now that another occurrence had taken place, even if the Green God Company’s executives didn’t say anything, the managers of Yuantian City’s Upper Zone definitely wouldn’t spare the offender.

However, when Luo Hanbin entered the house and saw Wang Xuanming being held in place by two Enforcement Robots, his eyes nearly fell out of their sockets.

Wang Xuanming!

A peerless genius of Haitian City’s Upper Zone!

Wang Xuanming was a big shot who was only half a step away from becoming a mental strength master. Even a supervisor like Luo Hanbin had to act politely around him. Meanwhile, with Wang Xuanming’s strength, he could rank within the top three of Haitian City’s Upper Zone’s base layer. The man even had a mental strength master as his teacher. With all these conditions, he was almost certain to become a permanent resident of the middle layer.

Let alone Luo Hanbin, even Xia Qingying was shocked.

Originally, she had expected the offender to be an ignorant punk. She never imagined that the offender would be a peerless genius of Haitian City’s Upper Zone.

She also couldn’t help wondering how Shi Feng had apprehended Wang Xuanming.

With Wang Xuanming’s skills, Xia Qingying had only a slight edge over him. She couldn’t guarantee she would win if they clashed. And if Wang Xuanming focused solely on escaping, even she wouldn’t be able to hold him down for seven or eight seconds.

Looking at Shi Feng sitting on the living room sofa, Xia Qingying blurted out, “You sure know how to surprise people. The last time, you broke the Mental Path’s record. Now, you even brought down Haitian City’s Wang Xuanming.”

Smiling bitterly, Shi Feng said, “An accident. This really is an accident. I never thought that a big shot from Haitian City’s Upper Zone would actually take action against me out of the blue.”

From the time Wang Xuanming had broken into the house and until his apprehension, Shi Feng hadn’t done anything. He had been a spectator all the while. He also never expected an expert like Wang Xuanming to attack him.

Not wishing to reveal Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose’s matters for the time being, he did not dispel Xia Qingying’s misunderstanding.

“Alright, then.” Seeing that Shi Feng didn’t intend to continue speaking, Xia Qingying said, “Now that Wang Xuanming has been arrested, the Green God Company will definitely punish him. Even his teacher won’t be able to do anything about it. However, his teacher is incredibly protective of his students. While he might not be able to do anything about Wang Xuanming’s punishment, he is sure to pick a fight with you. Although we will strengthen the security of this area, you should still be careful. It’s best if you don’t leave the residential area for the time being.”

Even base layer general managers like herself would have a headache dealing with the anger of a mental strength master, let alone Shi Feng, who held only Grade 1 authority.

“Thank you for your warning, General Manager Xia,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

Shortly after Xia Qingying’s group left with Wang Xuanming, word of Wang Xuanming’s assault on Shi Feng’s house spread like wildfire. Even though it was already midnight, everyone in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone still quickly received news of it.
