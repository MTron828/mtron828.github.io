Chapter 896 – Make Them Choose Peace

Following the appearance of the cloaked players, a momentary silence descended upon the central plaza once again.

“Madness! This is madness! Who are these people?!”

“Crap! Nearly a hundred Level 240 experts! Even the Dragon God Palace would have difficulty coming up with such a line-up!”

“Difficulty? More like impossible! What do you take Level 240 experts for? Cabbage? Only an apex power could possibly have so many Level 240 experts!”

The sudden appearance of the Dragon’s Crown members stupefied the players in the plaza, especially the members of the ten pseudo-apex powers.

“Boss Tracer, are we doomed?” a Level 236 Elementalist from Red-Tailed Dragon asked as she looked at the Level 238 Demidragon Ranger before her. “If I can’t log into God’s Domain again, I’ll get kicked out of the City Legion immediately. I just bought a house in the city center after saving up enough City Contribution Points…”

At the young female Elementalist’s words, the other youths in Red-Tailed Dragon’s team turned to the Demidragon Ranger anxiously.

Internal competition in first-tier City Legions was fierce. Although they were all geniuses, they still had to pay astronomical prices to secure a spot in these City Legions. Originally, they planned to save City Contribution Points until they were 50 before retiring. If they were to suffer a true death here, they could only live in the slums from now on.

“I don’t know,” the Demidragon Ranger named Light Tracer said helplessly. “The origins of these people are a mystery, but they likely come from a hidden apex power. Only an apex power can create such a team. We can’t beat them in battle, so you all must pray you get lucky afterward. As soon as the fight starts, do your best to escape. If you can get away, stay as far away from Red-Tailed Dragon as possible to avoid retaliation and lie low. Then, once the storm subsides, go somewhere else to develop.”

“Boss Tracer, aren’t you coming with us?” the young female Elementalist asked when she saw Light Tracer reaching for his longbow.

“It’s impossible for me,” Light Tracer said, shaking his head. “As the leader of the vanguard this time, the Guild will sacrifice me to appease the other side. The Guild will find me, even if I escape. You guys, on the other hand, still have hope.”

After hearing Light Tracer’s words, the rest of the Red-Tailed Dragon team members felt bitter. It was bad enough that they were assigned the menial task of guarding the central plaza. Now, they even had to become scapegoats for their superiors.

However, they also recognized that there was nothing they could do to change the situation. Many past examples had shown the frailty of pseudo-apex powers when dealing with an apex power. Every pseudo-apex power that had ever bared its fangs against an apex power no longer existed today.

Aside from Red-Tailed Dragon’s members, the expressions of the other pseudo-apex powers’ vanguard members didn’t look pleasant, either. Initially, they thought they were only dealing with a no-name power. They had never expected to encounter a hidden behemoth. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

On the other side of the plaza…

“Guild Leader Black Flame, did you bring them here?” Red Frost asked Shi Feng, unable to contain her curiosity any longer when she saw more Dragon’s Crown members appear.

Dragon’s Crown was a royal power of a remnant primordial world. While it might lack Divine Artifacts and Fragmented Divine Artifacts, it commanded far more Level 240-plus experts than all the apex powers in the Greater God’s Domain did.

If Shi Feng truly had a way to transport Dragon’s Crown’s members to the Greater God’s Domain, Red Frost couldn’t imagine what would become of the Greater God’s Domain.

“Mhm. I summoned them here,” Shi Feng said, nodding. Then, he smiled and added, “Consider it one of the safety measures I prepared for redeeming items.”

“A safety measure? You call this a safety measure?” Red Frost stared at Shi Feng blankly.

This was a team of chosen ones from a royal power. She refused to believe Shi Feng had summoned these chosen ones just to have them be his bodyguards. This was a blatant show of force. Moreover, this was without the ten pseudo-apex powers knowing that Dragon’s Crown was a royal power. They would be frightened to death if they learned of Dragon’s Crown’s status.

“The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary has a long history. Who knows how many trump cards the pseudo-apex powers have in their possession? It never hurts to be cautious,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. Then, he pointed at the pseudo-apex powers’ teams and continued, “Of course, this can also be regarded as a reminder to the pseudo-apex powers. Otherwise, Zero Wing will have difficulty establishing a partnership with the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary in the future.”

In reality, Shi Feng had summoned Dragon’s Crown members with selfish motives.

The Flame Dragon God’s Nest was one of the few super-large-scale Taboo Secret Lands in the Greater God’s Domain. It was also one of the few secret lands that could allow players to quickly level up to Level 240 and beyond. It went without saying that the secret land would be fiercely contested. With Zero Wing’s current strength, there was no way the Guild could occupy the secret land, even with the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key.

The primary purpose of the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key was to adjust the approximate location and size of the secret land’s entrance. Its secondary function was to create Key Imprints so players could leave the secret land without dying or spending Undying Souls.

Although Zero Wing had recruited many experts in the Eternal Realm, the Guild’s forces were already stretched thin to defend Shadowring Town. It had no spare forces to occupy the Flame Dragon God’s Nest.

Hence, Zero Wing’s only option to occupy the secret land was to partner with the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s local powers. The more, the better. After all, there was no way Holy Dragon Spear could defend Flame Vein Holy City by itself now that the secret land’s existence had become public knowledge.

To convince the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s local powers to partner with Zero Wing, it was first necessary to set an example for the local pseudo-apex powers. More specifically, Zero Wing needed to convince the ten pseudo-apex powers that it had an extremely powerful backer they could not oppose, even if they all joined forces. Otherwise, with Zero Wing’s current standards, no local power would negotiate with it peacefully.

“Partnership? What partnership?” When Red Frost saw Shi Feng’s nonchalance, a ridiculous thought suddenly came to her mind. “Don’t tell me you want to occupy the Flame Dragon God’s Nest?”

Shi Feng might not have had enough Undying Souls to redeem the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key previously, but it was a fact that the Access Key had disappeared shortly after he showed up in the central plaza. He had even brought Dragon’s Crown’s members with him. When Red Frost linked these two points, she suddenly felt that it wasn’t out of the question for him to have redeemed the Access Key.

“Indeed!” Shi Feng nodded. “Even if Zero Wing and Holy Dragon Spear join forces, it is unlikely we can safely defend the secret land from others. We can only truly occupy the Flame Dragon God’s Nest by uniting more pseudo-apex powers.”

“Impossible.” Red Frost shook her head. “The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s local pseudo-apex powers all have ties with apex powers. They also don’t have the best of relationships with one another, with some even holding grudges. They will jump at any chance to take each other’s place in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. Even if you have the Flame Dragon God’s Access Key and Dragon’s Crown’s chosen ones, they will still get the various apex powers involved.”

Shi Feng nodded, acknowledging Red Frost’s concerns. Then, he smiled and said, “That’s why I’ve sent someone to talk to them.”

“You sent someone to talk to them?” Red Frost rolled her eyes at Shi Feng. The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s ten pseudo-apex powers were incredibly stubborn and showed no respect for anyone. Even if the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Verdant Rainbow were to negotiate with them, she wouldn’t achieve any positive results. After all, all these pseudo-apex powers were more or less backed by apex powers.

“Mhm. That person should have arrived already,” Shi Feng said as he looked at the Advanced Tent at the edge of the magic barriers.
