Chapter 955 – Hundred Race Battlefield

Made a change to Chapter 952:

Original:

“Guild Leader, we discovered many Holy Race experts lurking in the Shadowring Basin several hours ago. These experts average Level 230 and are fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts. They seem to be from the Holy Race’s apex powers,” Gentle Snow said, sharing a video recording taken by Zero Wing’s members near the Shadowring Basin. The video showed an area isolated by a large, opaque barrier.

“Guild Leader, we noticed an increase in the number of Holy Race experts in Shadowring Town. These new experts average Level 230 and are fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts. We believe they come from the Holy Race’s apex powers,” Gentle Snow said. Then, she shared a video taken by Zero Wing’s members near the Shadowring Basin, the video showing an area isolated by a large, opaque barrier.

Eternal Realm, Shadowring Town:

As a long line of players from the human race and the Holy Race waited to enter Shadowring Town, a giant, five-headed avian exceeding a thousand meters in length landed outside the town. The five-headed avian was shrouded by dark-gray flames and radiated a powerful Divine Might, its arrival drawing many envious and astonished gazes.

A Five-Headed Death Bird!

This was a monster that usually only appeared in the dangerous parts of the Void Sea. Its Life Rating was superior to even that of ordinary dragons. Furthermore, even the weakest among them was a Level 230 Divine monster. Because of this, it was incredibly difficult to turn a Five-Headed Death Bird into a Flying Mount; no apex power had ever accomplished this feat.

“Who are these people? How did they turn a Five-Headed Death Bird into a Flying Mount?”

“Wait! Aren’t those Crystallians?!”

“Crystallians? Why would Crystallian players appear here? Shouldn’t they be active in the southern and eastern regions? Are they also planning to seize Shadowring Town?”

“Zero Wing sure is pitiful. It had finally gained a foothold in the Eternal Realm thanks to Shadowring Town. Yet, before it could relish the fruits of its labor, the Holy Race’s various powers set their sights on the town. Now, even the Crystallian race has come to get a piece of the action.”

The players waiting to enter Shadowring Town curiously discussed the Crystallian players that had jumped down from the Five-Headed Death Bird. They all assumed that these Crystallian players were here to seize the town from Zero Wing.

…

Amidst the bystanders’ discussions, the Crystallian players approached Shi Feng and the Seven Luminaries Alliance members gathered outside the town’s entrance.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, sorry for the long wait,” Rin greeted Shi Feng as she walked up to him in her six-meter-tall frame. Then, she pointed at the team behind her and continued, “This is Ninth Street’s Snow Wolf Legion, which will be coming along with us, while this person beside me is Commander Snow Wolf.”

As Rin gave her introduction, the lanky young man beside her scrutinized Shi Feng.

“So, you are Black Flame? The guy who defeated Garuda in the Continental Championship?” Snow Wolf asked, a little surprised as he looked at Shi Feng, who wasn’t even two meters tall.

Shi Feng was only Level 223. His equipment also comprised Fragmented Legendary Equipment. Such an equipment standard couldn’t even match that of the various apex powers’ elite experts, let alone the various royal powers’ elite experts. Not to mention, his movements indicated that he hadn’t reached the sixth-floor standard. Hence, Snow Wolf found it hard to believe Shi Feng had defeated Garuda, the Thunder Empire’s strongest chosen one.

“That is me.” Shi Feng nodded, similarly surprised as he looked at Snow Wolf.

Although Snow Wolf was only Level 235, Shi Feng could sense that the other party was a bona fide sixth-floor expert. A veteran sixth-floor expert at that. Yet, he had never heard of the other party in his previous life.

The human race might not have had much information on the Crystallian race in his previous life, but Mortal Gods were incredibly well-known figures. Logically, there was no way someone who had achieved the Mortal God standard this early into the Eternal Realm’s development would be unknown.

“You have good talent. It’s a pity you don’t have any powers to back you,” Snow Wolf said after he was done sizing up Shi Feng. “Are you willing to become an internal member of Ninth Street? You might not be able to join Ninth Street in a real sense, but you can sign a God’s Domain Contract with the Guild. If you have Ninth Street’s resources and my guidance, you can reach the sixth-floor standard without a problem. If luck is on your side, you may even get to participate in the Hundred Race Battlefield with us.

“The Hundred Race Battlefield is an extremely rare opportunity in God’s Domain. Weaker races don’t even qualify to participate. Currently, out of our three races, only the Crystallian race and the Holy Race have this qualification. Moreover, the Crystallian race has more slots than the Holy Race.”

“The Hundred Race Battlefield’s participation slots?” Shi Feng was even more surprised to hear this.

The Hundred Race Battlefield was undoubtedly an unfamiliar term to current human players. Even in his previous life, very few powers knew about it.

The Hundred Race Battlefield.

As the name suggested, it was a battlefield involving players from many races. It was rumored to hold opportunities that could let players achieve greatness. Only, as the human race never had any royal powers in his previous life, it was too weak to even participate in the Hundred Race Battlefield.

Obtaining a participation slot for the Hundred Race Battlefield was incredibly difficult. Even royal powers could secure only a few dozen slots, while some might not even get 20. Because of this, rarely would any power share their participation slots with outsiders.

“That’s right. So long as you sign a God’s Domain Contract with Ninth Street, it wouldn’t be impossible for you to enter the Hundred Race Battlefield with your talent,” Snow Wolf said, nodding. “How about it? Are you interested in joining us?”

“The Hundred Race Battlefield is indeed tempting, but I will pass on joining Ninth Street,” Shi Feng said, turning down the offer.

The Hundred Race Battlefield might be able to let players achieve greater heights, but he currently didn’t lack such opportunities. He even had a Tier 7 Promotion Land Scroll, which was hard to come by even in the Hundred Race Battlefield. Hence, he did not need to participate in the Hundred Race Battlefield. His top priority was improving his strength.

“That’s a shame.” When Snow Wolf heard Shi Feng’s refusal, he did not try to persuade the other party. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In Snow Wolf’s opinion, Shi Feng’s strength and talent were subpar. Whether Shi Feng joined Ninth Street would not affect the Guild’s performance in the Hundred Race Battlefield. Moreover, Snow Wolf suspected that Shi Feng did not understand the importance of the Hundred Race Battlefield. Otherwise, the other party would not have casually rejected his kind gesture.

…

After Shi Feng chatted with Rin for a bit, the group took off on the Silverwing Flying Ship. They flew straight to Skeleton Hill where the primordial civilization city was situated. Skeleton Hill was one of the few Level 230 Taboo Maps located on the Eternal Continent, and it was also a place that many powers wanted to explore right now.

In his previous life, every Level 230 Taboo Map in the Eternal Realm was a priority exploration target for the various apex and royal powers. These maps allowed players to level up to Level 230 and occasionally spawned Level 240 Taboo Dungeons.

As Level 240 Taboo Dungeons were one of the few places in God’s Domain where players could obtain Level 240 Taboo Weapons and Equipment, they were regarded as a treasure trove by both apex and royal powers. Additionally, Level 240 Taboo Weapons and Equipment were crucial in competing for the qualifications to participate in the Hundred Race Battlefield.

…

After crossing multiple high-level maps and Taboo Maps and shaking off countless monsters, the Silverwing Flying Ship arrived at a plain littered with skeletons half a day later.

This should be the place.

When the flying ship stopped above a forested area surrounded by three mountains, Shi Feng jumped off and retrieved the Great Lord Token from his bag.

System: Do you wish to use the Great Lord Token to become the Great Lord of this region?

“Yes!”

System: It is detected that an archaic city occupies this region. A new city cannot be constructed here. Do you wish to spend 200,000 Eternal Gold Coins and 10,000,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal to awaken this city?

“Awaken it!”
