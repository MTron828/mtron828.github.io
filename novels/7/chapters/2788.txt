Chapter 2789 – Dragon’s Might

In a cave on the southwestern side of the Ghostfire Hills...

After Crimson Billow sent the Infant Dragon’s coordinates, Shi Feng had quickly gathered everyone. Now, all 128 members of the team were sneaking deeper into the cave.

“The flames seem to be getting stronger and stronger,” Yu Luo said worriedly when she sensed her Stamina and Concentration depleting at a quicker rate. “Moreover, the burning sensation is also growing stronger, the deeper we go. At this rate, I’m afraid the burning sensation will grow so strong that we won’t be able to focus during the battle.”

“Indeed. The burning sensation here is getting worse.” Wind Chaser nodded in agreement. “Under this burning sensation, I’m afraid ordinary Refinement Realm experts won’t be able to exhibit combat standards at the Refinement Realm.”

Previously, the illusory flames merely ate at his Stamina and Concentration. However, he now felt as if his whole body was scorching. Although the pain was subtle, it would still impact the performance of people with weak minds.

Combat techniques, Skills, and Spells required precision control. Even a slight deviation could result in a massive difference in the combat power one could exhibit.

After observing the environment, Lionheart suggested to Shi Feng, “Brother Black Flame, this cave is indeed extraordinary. I think our best option is to take the fight out of the cave. Otherwise, we’ll have difficulty exerting our strength.”

“I’m afraid that won’t do.” Shaking his head, Shi Feng said with certainty, “We must finish the Infant Dragon in this cave. Moreover, this is most likely our only chance. Outside this cave, we’ll have trouble even touching the Infant Dragon.”

Dragons were the rulers of the sky. On paper, fighting the Infant Dragon outside the cave might seem to be to their team’s advantage. However, doing so would actually place their team at a disadvantage. This was especially true for the team’s Tier 3 players. Without the help of special Skills, Tier 3 players couldn’t fly by themselves. Hence, if they fought the Infant Dragon outside, the team’s Tier 3 members would get sidelined.

As for utilizing the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship to fight the Infant Dragon, that was simply a joke.

Against a Tier 4 Infant Dragon, even an Advanced Flying Ship wouldn’t last more than three or four hits. In fact, it wouldn’t be strange if the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship fell after just one attack. After all, the Flying Ship was merely capable of withstanding the attacks of ordinary Tier 4 Mythic monsters. Its defenses would crumble instantly before a Tier 5 attack.

Shortly afterward, Shi Feng and the others came across Crimson Billow, hiding underneath a rock.

At present, though, Crimson Billow had a wilted expression on her face.

“What happened?” Lionheart asked strangely when he saw Crimson Billow’s condition.

“It’s nothing.” Shaking her head, Crimson Billow smiled bitterly and said, “I’m just wondering whether we can really win against that Infant Dragon.”

“Although it is an Infant Dragon, our team isn’t a pushover, either. How would we know we can’t win if we don’t give it a try?” Blood Blade said confidently as he looked at Crimson Billow’s defeated expression. “Don’t forget that we have nine Tier 4 players this time. That Infant Dragon is also only at Tier 4.”

However, after Blood Blade finished speaking, the cavern at the end of the road appeared in front of everyone. And a creature with a pale golden body over 100 meters long entered their sight.

[Infant Golden Dragon) (Dragon, Mythic) 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Level 140

HP 112,000,000,000

“How is this possible?!”

Everyone gasped involuntarily when they saw the Infant Dragon’s statistics. Even Lifeless Thorn and Solitary Nine, who had seen a Half-step Demon King before, were astonished.

The Infant Golden Dragon’s stifling aura aside, just its HP of 112 billion was already plenty mind-boggling

With 112 billion HP, the Infant Dragon would recover 2.24 billion HP every five seconds, or roughly 400 million HP every second. Even assuming each of their Tier 4 players could cause 50 million damage per second, after excluding the two Tier 4 healers, they could deal only around 350 million damage per second with the remaining seven Tier 4 players. Moreover, this was all under the premise that the Infant Dragon didn’t possess a powerful Defense and wouldn’t put up any resistance.

Not to mention, the Infant Dragon before them was part of the Golden Dragon tribe. Its Bloodline was of a much higher purity than ordinary Dragons’. Among the Dragon race, the Golden Dragons’ Bloodline was second only to Divine Dragons. “It’s no wonder they say Dragons are invincible among existences of the same tier. With such HP, even if we can survive this Infant Dragon’s attacks, I doubt we can actually kill it.” Wind Chaser couldn’t help feeling shaken.

Although HP wasn’t everything, it could still provide an intuitive gauge of an existence’s general strength.

With how much HP the Infant Dragon possessed, it was easy to imagine how terrifying its Basic Attributes were. They were definitely at least two or three times higher than those of the average Superior Mythic monster of the same level.

What did that mean?

With an attack from a Superior Mythic monster of the same level, a Tier 4 player would still receive significant damage even if they merely defended themself. However, if a Tier 4 player tried defending against one of the Infant Golden Dragon’s attacks, they would be fortunate to retain a scrap of HP to keep themself alive. If they were unlucky, they would be one-shotted.

In other words, if their team wished to fight the Infant Golden Dragon, they couldn’t allow even a graze from it. Otherwise, lives would be lost.

At this moment, Lionheart and the other Skyflare executives finally understood why Shi Feng didn’t assign healers to any of the Tier 3 combat squadrons.

After all, Tier 3 players would be no different from ants in the upcoming battle. They were insignificant existences that would disappear upon coming into contact with even the slightest shockwave. Hence, there was naturally no need to assign healers to them.

An Infant Golden Dragon? Shi Feng also smiled bitterly when he saw the mountain-like Dragon before him. No wonder this quest was evaluated at the Inferior Mythic rank.

This Tier 4 Infant Golden Dragon’s combat power reached the Tier 5 Intermediate rank. Even Frobero in his heyday wouldn’t be a match for this Infant Dragon. In other words, the Infant Dragon simply wasn’t an existence Tier 4 players could hope to confront.

Possibly, only Tier 4 experts wielding Legendary Weapons and geared in Legendary Equipment could hope to defeat the Infant Golden Dragon. Otherwise, the best option for players coming across this Infant Dragon was to obey their instincts and flee immediately. “Brother Black Flame.” At this time, Lionheart couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng and shake his head. “Although I don’t want to say it, I’m afraid there really is no hope of killing this Infant Golden Dragon.”

After seeing the Infant Golden Dragon for himself, he finally understood that the records in books weren’t entirely trustworthy. After all, the Infant Dragon before him was many times more terrifying than what was described in the library books he read. It simply wasn’t an existence Tier 4 players could hope to fight.

At the very least, it is absolutely impossible for their present selves. Most likely, only Tier 4 NPCs would have a glimmer of hope. “No, that’s not necessarily true,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. A hint of determination appearing in his eyes, he continued, “We’re not exactly out of options. It’s just that we’ll need to gamble.”

Killing this Tier 4 Infant Golden Dragon was imperative. However, it wasn’t just for the sake of completing his Inferior Mythic Quest, but because he couldn’t continue staying in the ancient God’s Domain.

After all, his initial goal in visiting the Earthfall Secret Land was simply to acquire the necessary resources for constructing the Small Mobile Fortress.

Now that he had achieved his goal, he couldn’t remain here, as there were still many things he needed to attend to in the modern God’s Domain.

Meanwhile, killing the Infant Dragon before him was his best chance to attract the world’s attention and get the world to banish him from the ancient God’s Domain.

“Gamble?” Lionheart was slightly surprised by Shi Feng’s words. He simply couldn’t see how they could possibly defeat the Infant Dragon before them.

“I will start chanting an incantation in a moment, and it will most likely cause quite a commotion. So, I will need you to erect a magic barrier now to prevent the Infant Dragon from noticing it,” Shi Feng said, taking a deep breath. “As for the subsequent battle, I will need you, Commander Lionheart, to act as support. Both Yu Luo and Fated Fern will be tasked with healing you. Nine, you’ll protect the healer squadron. As for the healer squadron, use everything you have to heal my summoned creature. Do not stop for even a moment.”

“Summoned creature?”

Lionheart and the others were confused by Shi Feng’s words. They found it hard to imagine that any summoned creature could stop the Infant Golden Dragon for even a moment. Despite their doubts, everyone still obeyed Shi Feng’s commands.

The next moment, over a hundred people each took out a Magic Array Scroll from their bags and instantly erected a barrier to isolate the tunnel from the cavern. With this magic barrier present, the Infant Golden Dragon wouldn’t detect anything they did inside the barrier even if it was awake right now.

“Brother Black Flame, everything is ready! You can begin whenever you want!” Lionheart said. Looking at the Advanced Magic Array, he couldn’t help feeling a little heartache. However, to avoid disturbing the Infant Golden Dragon, they had no choice but to use it.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng personally verified that everything was set up correctly, he took out the Bible of Darkness and began chanting an incantation.

Originally, he had not planned to use the Bible of Darkness. After all, the cost of using it at Tier 4 was far too great. He estimated that after a few more uses, his soul would get devoured by the Power of Darkness.

However, if he wished to slay the Infant Golden Dragon now, he could only take the risk.

Immediately after Shi Feng began chanting, the Mana inside the barrier gave off a bone-chilling sensation—the complete opposite of the burning sensation it gave off previously.

Before anyone could react to the change, the barrier’s interior suddenly went dark. Everyone could feel endless loneliness, coldness, and despair coming from the darkness around them. Standing in this dark environment didn’t feel the slightest bit better than standing in the Infant Dragon’s presence.

As Shi Feng continued incanting, the Infant Golden Dragon slumbering outside the barrier suddenly opened its eyes as if startled awake. Its massive eyes then looked directly at the barrier-enveloped tunnel vigilantly.

“How is this possible?!” Fated Fern, who was hosting the magic barrier, was stunned by this development.

The Advanced Magic Array they used, Spatial Wall, could thoroughly isolate an area from the outside world. Even if a large explosion went off inside the barrier, nobody in the outside world should be able to notice it.

Nonetheless, the Infant Dragon had clearly noticed them.

“What a despicable dark energy.” Looking at the empty tunnel before it, the Infant Golden Dragon bellowed, “It seems you humans have fallen as well! To think you would actually come seeking death together with a Demon!” The Infant Dragon’s bellow instantly extinguished the Advanced Magic Barrier like a storm blowing out a candle. Simultaneously, the figures of Shi Feng and the others appeared before the Infant Dragon. “Brother Black Flame?” Seeing that the Infant Dragon had already stood up, Lionheart raised his shield anxiously. He then sent a sidelong glance at Shi Feng and asked, “Are you still not done?”

The power of the Dragon before them far exceeded his expectations. Normally, even Mythic monsters couldn’t destroy the Spatial Wall so easily, yet the Infant Dragon had accomplished this feat with just one roar.

He simply didn’t dare imagine how powerful an actual attack from the Infant Dragon would be.

“I’m done! I made it just in time!” Shi Feng said, a smile appearing on his pale face. As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, a dark void appeared in the cavern’s ceiling. A stone door even larger than the Infant Golden Dragon then fell out of this void. Before the players and Infant Dragon could react to this turn of events, the stone door gradually opened.
