Chapter 871 – One Woman, One Spear

“Incredible! They got the Guild Leaders of the city’s top two Guilds to come to them! Who are these people?”

The bystanders were shocked and confused by the situation unfolding before them. Even Whirlwind Bulwark found it baffling.

Tyrant Wyvern and Dawn Forest were big shots who could shake the entire Nightmare Holy City with so much as a sneeze.

Under normal circumstances, meeting either of them would be as difficult as winning the lottery. Yet, both had now come together because of a single party.

“Yes, that would be us,” Shi Feng calmly responded to Tyrant Wyvern and Dawn Forest’s question. “What can I do for you two?”

Red Frost and the others also curiously walked over to look at the two Guild Leaders. They behaved like the 20,000-plus elite experts surrounding them did not exist.

To ordinary experts, a standoff involving tens of thousands of elite experts was indeed intimidating, especially when over half of these elite experts blatantly exuded killing intent. The average expert would probably collapse mentally when subjected to such heavy menace.

However, Shi Feng’s party remained unfazed. After all, major conflicts between pseudo-apex powers typically involved upwards of several million experts. Sometimes, hundreds of millions of experts could even be involved. Thus, a conflict involving 20,000-plus experts was nothing. Not to mention, there was not even a single Fragmented Divine Artifact among these players.

“Very good. I hadn’t expected you to have the courage to admit it.” Tyrant Wyvern couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows slightly when he saw how calmly Shi Feng behaved. “I am Tyrant Wyvern, the White Dragon Nation’s Guild Leader. Since you have admitted your sins, that makes things simple. Hand over all your weapons and equipment. Then, publicly kneel and apologize to Fira’s team. Do that, and I will let this matter slide. Otherwise, you will pay the consequences!”

“Guild Leader, aren’t we letting them off too easily?”

Tyrant Wyvern’s words surprised the guild executives behind him.

Tyrant Wyvern was known for his ruthlessness in Nightmare Holy City. Normally, even when only a few normal guild members were killed after a failed kill-stealing attempt, he would regard it as a provocation by the other party and wouldn’t rest until the other party had been annihilated a few dozen times.

Now that Fira and her team of over 200 elite experts had been wiped out, it wouldn’t be surprising if Tyrant Wyvern called for the permanent erasure of Shi Feng’s party from God’s Domain. Yet, he was willing to settle with just an apology…

“Enough! I have my own considerations!” Tyrant Wyvern glared at his subordinates, silencing them.

Compared to avenging Fira, Tyrant Wyvern was much more interested in the weapons and equipment of Shi Feng’s party. He was also somewhat wary of the identities of Shi Feng and his party members.

Through the battle video, Tyrant Wyvern could tell that Shi Feng and his party members possessed extraordinary Basic Attributes. Under normal circumstances, even he could not one-shot Fira. Yet, the Level 227 Heiser had done it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Logically, even if Heiser had used a combat technique above the Gold standard, she still shouldn’t be able to one-shot Fira. Thus, Tyrant Wyvern concluded that the weapons and equipment used by Heiser and the rest of Shi Feng’s party were far above the Fragmented Legendary rank.

If he could get his hands on these powerful weapons and equipment, it would propel his overall strength to a whole new level and greatly increase his chances of clearing the cross-region challenge. He might even be able to let other members of the Guild clear it. At that time, the White Dragon Nation would officially become the number-one Guild in Nightmare Holy City.

The only problem was obtaining these items. Even if he applied the Divine Soul Curse to Shi Feng’s party, they wouldn’t drop all their equipped items on death, much less the items in their bags. If they moved their weapons and equipment into their bags when they neared death, it would be a huge loss to the White Dragon Nation.

“Friend, you don’t have to listen to Tyrant Wyvern. So long as you join the Holy Knights, I can guarantee nothing will happen to you in Nightmare Holy City,” Dawn Forest said, smiling at Shi Feng. “Additionally, once you and your party members join the Holy Knights, so long as you perform well, you will be assigned an Elder position at the very least.”

“Madness! This is madness!”

“Am I hearing things? That Dawn Forest is making such a promise to a group of unknown experts? Not even Kowloon Demon received such an offer back then!”

Dawn Forest did not keep his voice down, so the bystanders heard him clearly. However, they couldn’t understand why he would offer such conditions to Shi Feng’s party.

As the Holy Knights was one of Nightmare Holy City’s top two Guilds, its Elder positions were highly valued and hard to come by. Even elite experts would have less than a 10% chance of becoming Elders after toiling over a decade for the Guild. Yet, Dawn Forest now offered Elder positions to all six members of Shi Feng’s party. This was definitely a first since the Holy Knights’ inception.

“Forest! Are you determined to oppose me?!” Tyrant Wyvern glared at Dawn Forest. Although he had already guessed that Dawn Forest was here to make trouble for him, he hadn’t expected the other party to act so blatantly.

“Brother Tyrant, how can you say that?” Dawn Forest scoffed. “Good talent is hard to come by. Since you have generously offered these friends to me, I naturally can’t mistreat them.”

The Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation had been fighting in Nightmare Holy City for many years, so neither side feared the other. Now that there was an opportunity to recruit a group of experts and suppress the White Dragon Nation, Dawn Forest naturally wouldn’t let it go.

“Good! Very good! In that case, you leave me no choice but to get rid of the Holy Knights as well!” Tyrant Wyvern said, his expression darkening. Immediately afterward, he commanded, “Attack!”

“Do you think that’s enough to scare me? Brothers, attack!” Dawn Forest promptly responded by commanding his guild members to engage the White Dragon Nation’s experts.

In the blink of an eye, a fight between the elite experts of the White Dragon Nation and the Holy Knights broke out in the middle of Nightmare Holy City’s main street. Although the city’s Level 200-plus, Tier 6 NPC Guards tried to intervene, their efforts were futile, as the two Guilds quickly suppressed them.

The main street quickly became a bloody battlefield with the two sides bombarding each other with Skills and Spells. Explosions echoed across the city.

In reality, there wasn’t much difference in strength between the Holy Knights and the White Dragon Nation. This was also why the conflict between the two Guilds had lasted for so long.

Unfortunately, because Dawn Forest had failed to show up with as many elite experts as Tyrant Wyvern, his forces were quickly suppressed and forced to give up ground repeatedly. Of course, this slight advantage still wasn’t enough to let the White Dragon Nation’s experts annihilate the Holy Knights’ experts.

Seconds after the battle began, the street was strewn with corpses. The magic barriers protecting the shops on both sides of the street also shook violently, their collapse imminent.

After some more time passed, Dawn Forest and his subordinates were ultimately forced to one end of the street. Now, the White Dragon Nation had full control over the main street.

“How surprising. I was certain you would have gone with Forest,” Tyrant Wyvern said when he saw that Shi Feng’s party never got involved with the battle. Then, he sneered and continued, “I don’t know if I should consider you smart or dumb. Did you think I would forgive your provocation simply because you steered clear of the conflict between our two Guilds?

“But I’m not unreasonable. I can give you two options. For the first option, you won’t need to apologize to Fira’s team, but you must turn over all your weapons, equipment, and bag items. Additionally, you must sign a contract agreeing to serve the White Dragon Nation for fifty years! As for the second option, permanent death! Now, make your choice!”

The bystanders gasped upon hearing this.

Although they had long since known about Tyrant Wyvern’s ruthless personality, they never expected him to be this ruthless. While he might have excused Shi Feng’s party from begging for forgiveness, he replaced it with the condition of serving the White Dragon Nation for 50 years. Moreover, if Shi Feng’s party refused to comply, they would be forced to retire permanently from God’s Domain and lose the ability to ascend to greater heights.

Before Shi Feng, the leader of the six-man party, could voice his refusal, Red Frost suddenly stepped forward with her spear in hand. Then, she casually walked toward Tyrant Wyvern as if strolling in her backyard.

“What? Is that beauty thinking of taking action?”

Red Frost’s actions stunned the players watching from the surrounding shops.

Besides being a powerful expert, Tyrant Wyvern had the White Dragon Guard protecting him at all times. The White Dragon Guard consisted of elite experts who were much stronger than those under Fira’s leadership. They were also equipped with Battle Array Equipment that could let a 500-man team form a Large Silver Battle Array. Under the effects of this battle array, it would be as if the White Dragon Guard had received a one-rank upgrade to all their weapons and equipment.

In a death match, the White Dragon Guard could eliminate all the elite experts Dawn Forest had brought.

“Commander, is Guild Leader Black Flame’s party insane? Why would they have only one person fight?” Star Butterfly was bewildered when she saw the rest of Shi Feng’s party remaining motionless. “That’s the White Dragon Guard we are talking about! They’re completely different from Fira’s team!”

Meanwhile, Tyrant Wyvern frowned when he saw Red Frost approach. He hadn’t expected there to be someone impervious to reason. Waving his hand, he commanded, “Kill her!”

Suddenly, over a thousand Spells and arrows flew at Red Frost. The attacks were densely packed like a wall, making them impossible to avoid.

However, shortly after these attacks were launched, Red Frost raised her crimson spear and thrust it forward. Then, a pillar of scorching flames shot into the sky, incinerating the oncoming Spells and arrows.

Scorching Blood!

This was the Profound Skill of Red Frost’s Divine Spear. Moreover, she could exert 100% of the Skill’s potential because she was now a sixth-floor expert.
