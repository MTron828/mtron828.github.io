Chapter 879 – Chapter of Space

Heiser and Xiao Yilong grew worried when they saw Kowloon Demon isolating the space around him and Shi Feng with the Tier 6 Divine Runic Curse Dimensional World.

“What is Kowloon Demon trying to do? Does he plan to go back on his word and fight with his full strength?” Xiao Yilong muttered anxiously as he stared at the translucent silver barrier.

Originally, Xiao Yilong thought their trip to this remnant primordial world would be filled with opportunities. Especially after seeing the states of Nightmare Holy City and its top two Guilds, he was certain they would be able to earn a lot of Undying Souls. However, the dangers here far exceeded his expectations. Never had he expected to encounter a Level 240 expert here, let alone one with such a terrifying combat standard.

If Kowloon Demon disregarded his reputation and fought with his full strength, their party might not leave this remnant primordial world, let alone earn Undying Souls from it.

“I don’t think so,” Heiser said, shaking her head. Then, while recalling her fight with Kowloon Demon, she added, “He’s a battle maniac through and through. He’s fixated on improving his strength. At his standard, finding worthy opponents is nigh impossible. Though not a sixth-floor expert himself, Guild Leader Black Flame can fight sixth-floor experts on even Basic Attributes. In a sense, experts like Guild Leader Black Flame are much rarer. If Kowloon Demon acts rashly, he might never come across another opponent like Guild Leader Black Flame.”

“I guess you’re right.” Xiao Yilong agreed with Heiser’s opinion. For those seeking ultimate strength, the higher they climbed, the lonelier they became. Then, he looked at Kowloon Demon and sighed, “Still, this world really is scary. I thought Red Frost had become the strongest human player in terms of combat standards. I hadn’t expected to meet other sixth-floor human experts in this God Mode Underground City. Moreover, according to Kowloon Demon, there should be quite a few sixth-floor experts in this world. If the Greater God’s Domain’s old monsters learn of this, their jaws will probably drop…”

Mortal Gods!

To his knowledge, Red Frost was the only player in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain to have reached this standard. Before Red Frost’s resurgence, everyone even thought it was impossible to achieve this legendary standard.

Yet, it was now revealed that there was not just one, but multiple sixth-floor experts in this remnant primordial world. This was unbelievable news.

Heiser stared at Kowloon Demon. Although she didn’t make any comments, she strongly agreed with Xiao Yilong’s sentiment.

…

Meanwhile, silence descended momentarily in the interior of the Dimensional World after Shi Feng revealed his origins. Kowloon Demon simply stared at Shi Feng, his expression changing from cold to confused.

“Another world?” Kowloon Demon finally broke the silence. Then, with a firm gaze on Shi Feng, he added, “Had you been a sixth-floor expert, I’d 100% suspect that you were sent by that side to mess with me. But you’re not. You even managed to overpower me. There isn’t anyone like you in this world.

“This is really unexpected. I always assumed those old records at headquarters were just legends. I never thought there could be human players outside our world. But now, it seems those ancient records were factual.

“If I’m not mistaken, you and that girl should be using the so-called Fragmented Divine Artifacts or Divine Artifacts, right? That would explain your frightening Basic Attributes.

“Since you are from outside of this world, how about partnering with Dragon’s Crown? Our world should have many things you need. Not to brag, but there isn’t anything in this world that Dragon’s Crown can’t obtain.”

Kowloon Demon’s zealousness and fighting spirit disappeared. Now, his eyes were filled with joy and anticipation. He looked at Shi Feng as if he were looking at a mountain of treasure.

“A partnership?” Shi Feng was momentarily surprised. Then, he quickly calmed down and said, “It’s not out of the question.”

No power could resist the lucrative potential of a trade agreement between worlds, least of all one involving this remnant primordial world. The weapon and equipment production technology here far outpaced anything found in the Greater God’s Domain. Even the Level 235 Taboo Epic Weapons and Equipment produced here could fetch astronomical prices in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone the Level 240 Fragmented Legendary and Legendary Equipment.

Of course, no one would sell these Taboo Weapons and Equipment for money unless absolutely necessary. After all, they were the foundation of a power’s strength. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

What the powers in the Greater God’s Domain truly lacked weren’t high-level players, but Taboo Weapons and Equipment. With enough Taboo Weapons and Equipment, their members could raid Taboo Dungeons nonstop and level up rapidly.

Taboo Dungeons weren’t particularly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. It was just that most players lacked the strength to raid them. If players were strong enough to raid Taboo Dungeons nonstop, they could level up as quickly as grinding in Taboo Secret Lands.

“I heard that you need a lot of Undying Souls.” Kowloon Demon laughed when he saw Shi Feng feigning hesitance. “While precious, they’re not particularly rare in this world. If you partner with Dragon’s Crown, you only need to bring Dragon’s Crown’s members outside. In return, Dragon’s Crown will pay you ten million Undying Souls per trip. This should be a great deal for you.”

“Bring you out?” Shi Feng frowned slightly. “While my party can come and go here freely, taking people out is another matter altogether.”

Shi Feng wasn’t surprised by Kowloon Demon’s desire to head to the Greater God’s Domain. After all, it was only a matter of time before this remnant primordial world linked up with the Greater God’s Domain. If Dragon’s Crown could establish itself in the Greater God’s Domain ahead of time, it would stand to benefit more once the linking happened. This was similar to Shi Feng’s desire to establish Zero Wing in the Eternal Realm.

However, his party had used a teleportation passage to reach this remnant primordial world, and they could only return by using the Return Crystal that the Underground City had given them. Moreover, this Return Crystal was bound to them, so they couldn’t give it to others. Evidently, the Underground City did not want the players of this remnant primordial world to leave.

Furthermore, Shi Feng was unable to use the Abyss Workshop Certification’s World-Breaking Teleportation due to the interference set in place by the Primordial Flame Dragon. Otherwise, he could have long since traveled in and out of the Flame Dragon God’s Nest freely.

“I know that,” Kowloon Demon said. Then, he hesitantly pulled out a tattered sheet of paper from the five-colored ring he wore and added, “We naturally can’t leave using normal methods. But leaving won’t be a problem if we use this item.”

“The Chapter of Space?” Shi Feng gasped when he saw the tattered paper in Kowloon Demon’s hand.
