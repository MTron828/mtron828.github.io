Chapter 948 – Dawn of a New Era

Eternal Realm, Shadowring Town, Violet Moon Bar:

The town’s Violet Moon Bar was as popular as ever among independent players. Besides providing players with high-end drinks that could help with Concentration recovery, the bar also served as a place to exchange information.

At this time, a female Swordsman carrying three longswords on her back entered the bar. She exuded a powerful aura as she approached the bar counter and ordered a Fiery Blue Moon. After paying 50 Eternal Silver for her drink, she turned to the Shield Warrior sitting beside her with a resentful look.

“Commander Azure Dragon, you’d better have called me here for something important. I just got into the Tower of the Abyss when you interrupted me,” Frost Raven grumbled before taking a sip of the Fiery Blue Moon the bartender had prepared for her.

The Tower of the Abyss had become a holy land for the human race’s experts in the Eternal Realm. Countless experts lined up to enter it every day. Queuing services had even appeared for the tower, each slot costing one Eternal Gold. That was about as much money as the average fourth-floor expert earned in the Eternal Realm.

Frost Raven had gotten her turn inside the Tower of the Abyss not long ago. However, before she reached the fifth floor, Azure Dragon had called her to meet him.

“Don’t get angry at me just yet,” Azure Dragon said apologetically, looking at the resentful Frost Raven. “I didn’t interrupt you on purpose. I have shocking news to share with you.”

“Shocking news? What is it?” Frost Raven asked indifferently. Not even for a second did she think Azure Dragon’s so-called “shocking news” could be as important as the Tower of the Abyss.

“Didn’t you ask me to keep an eye on Guild Leader Black Flame’s movements?” Azure Dragon chuckled, paying no mind to Frost Raven’s attitude.

“What?! Did you get a new battle video of Guild Leader Black Flame, Commander?!” Frost Raven’s indifferent expression vanished instantly, replaced by a look of urgency.

Frost Raven had always strived to become the strongest expert, at least among Swordsmen players. She also felt that she had the talent to achieve that goal. However, after doing her best in the Continental Championship, she suddenly realized that the world was much bigger than she had thought.

Frost Raven had never thought that there could be alien races playing God’s Domain. Moreover, these alien players were astonishingly strong. Of course, she was aware of her current limits, so she had set Shi Feng as her first goal.

Shi Feng was not only the second-strongest expert in the Continental Championship but also a Swordsman. He had many aspects that she could study. Hence, she asked Azure Dragon to collect battle videos of Shi Feng.

“You should know about Everlasting City’s competition, right?” Azure Dragon did not answer Frost Raven’s question directly. “It’s the one that many pseudo-apex powers wanted to hire us to help with, but you refused to participate because you weren’t interested.”

“Did Guild Leader Black Flame participate in Everlasting City’s competition?” Frost Raven asked in surprise.

The average power might be ignorant of Everlasting City’s competition, but it wasn’t much of a secret to the Order of Twelve. Frost Raven even received many offers for her help. However, as Everlasting City’s competition was a battle between powers, the battles in the competition would primarily be team battles. As she wasn’t interested in team battles, she had turned down all the offers she received.

Although Zero Wing had been developing rapidly in the Eternal Realm, it was still far from matching the various pseudo-apex powers. It was especially so when it came to its member count. Zero Wing would be at an overwhelming disadvantage if it participated in the competition in its current state. Not to mention, there was also a huge gap in levels and equipment standards between its members and the various pseudo-apex powers’ members.

“Yes! Not only did he participate in it, but he even made a name for himself!” Azure Dragon said excitedly. “It’s a shame you weren’t there to witness that legendary fight! It was one man against four royal powers!”

“One man against four royal powers?” Frost Raven was stunned.

The concept of royal powers might be foreign to human players operating outside the Eternal Realm, but for human players residing in the Eternal Realm, the words “royal power” were synonymous with fear. Even the human race’s apex powers would try to avoid a confrontation with royal powers.

Yet, Shi Feng had fought four royal powers by himself. Frost Raven couldn’t even imagine what kind of scene that could be.

“But that’s not why I called you here,” Azure Dragon said, looking at the dejected Frost Raven. Then, he pulled out a thick booklet and placed it on the counter. “This thing. This is why I called you here.”

“The Divine Glory List?” After snapping out of her daze, Frost Raven looked at Azure Dragon in confusion. “Didn’t you show this to me not long ago?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Besides briefly introducing all entries, the Seven Luminaries Alliance would also attach battle videos to the Divine Glory List to prove the authenticity of its evaluations. Because of this, the Divine Glory List was one of the few sources for players in the Greater God’s Domain to obtain the battle videos of apex experts. Outside of public matches, the average player would never get to witness experts of such caliber in action.

“This is the latest edition. Getting this wasn’t easy; I had to borrow it from a friend in the Seven Luminaries Alliance. Otherwise, we would have had to wait at least half a day before the latest edition reached Shadowring Town,” Azure Dragon said, caressing the booklet as if it were a precious treasure.

“Isn’t it just the Divine Glory List?” Frost Raven rolled her eyes at Azure Dragon. “Only the placements outside the top 500 will see significant changes. The top 100 placements hardly ever change. If not for Guild Leader Black Flame debuting on the Divine Glory List, I wouldn’t even have looked at it.”

“You’d better take a look before passing judgment,” Azure Dragon said, chuckling. “I can tell you that the changes this time will send shockwaves across the Greater God’s Domain. The new rules implemented for the Divine Glory List might even frighten you.”

“New rules?” Azure Dragon’s words piqued Frost Raven’s curiosity, and she couldn’t help but look into the booklet.

New Rules for the Divine Glory List:

Although the Divine Glory List will continue to record 1,000 of the strongest experts in the Greater God’s Domain, players’ evaluations will no longer be based on levels and equipment standards. Instead, players will be judged solely on combat standards. Additionally, only players aged 50 or under will be considered.

When Frost Raven saw the new rules, her eyes shone brightly.

In the past, the Divine Glory List only considered players’ overall strength. This skewed the evaluations toward levels and equipment standards. If players were judged solely on their combat standards, the evaluation would undoubtedly be fairer. It would also offer others a clearer look at a player’s talent.

Immediately, Frost Raven turned the pages to see who ranked first on the new Divine Glory List. At the same time, several names came to mind.

Since the new Divine Glory List considered only combat standards and restricted entries to players no older than 50, Shi Feng and Elise were likely to see their rankings soar. After all, they were younger generation experts who had represented the human race in the Continental Championship.

The person who ranked first on the Divine Glory List was…

Purgatory Jade!

“Who is this person?” Frost Raven was momentarily stunned. Then, she promptly looked to see who came in second place.
