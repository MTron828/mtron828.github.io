Chapter 424 – City Battle Begins

On a desolate and silent plain, two metal giants gradually neared each other.

The residents of both mobile cities looked up at the holographic screens spread across their respective cities in excitement and tension.

City battles were a solemn and important event for all cities in the Greater World. The outcome of a city battle would affect not only the contribution points earned by the two participating cities’ city legions but also the living standards of the two cities’ residents.

The Greater World’s mobile cities relied on power furnaces to sustain their daily operations. Meanwhile, the more fuel available in a power furnace, the higher a city’s Singular Energy levels would become.

Meanwhile, city battles were essentially fights over fuel for power furnaces.

The winner of a city battle would receive one power furnace’s worth of fuel from the loser, and once a third-tier city gathered twenty power furnace’s worth of fuel, it would get upgraded into a second-tier city.

Whether it was Star Lake City or the approaching Riverlight City, neither side possessed much fuel. Star Lake City only had four power furnaces worth of fuel, while Riverlight City possessed five. Hence, no matter the outcome of the upcoming city battle, the winner would see a significant improvement in its daily operations, while the loser would see a significant decline.

…

At this time, the members of both cities’ city legions were gathered on the walls of their respective cities, observing each other.

“Sure enough, it’s as the information we got stated, Commander. Riverlight City has received the Divine Seal Saint’s support. Moreover, he has sent two of his vice commanders to join Riverlight City temporarily…” Markless Blade said, frowning as he looked at the opposing city’s Tier 6 battle groups.

Clad in tight-fitting crimson sportswear, Red Frost remained unfazed as she looked at the two Divine Seal Legion vice commanders standing in the distance. Then, she said, “Who told us to refuse his suggestion of banishing Zero Wing’s members? With his temper, it’d be strange if he didn’t try to teach us a lesson.”

Power furnace fuel was of utmost importance to the various mobile cities. Knowing this, the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers and conglomerates would usually meddle in the city battles of other cities when they wished to target a particular city.

“Are you confident in winning, Commander?” Markless Blade nervously asked. Now that Riverlight City had gained two of the Divine Seal Legion’s vice commanders as support for its Tier 6 battle groups, Starlight City would be at an overwhelming disadvantage if it couldn’t find anyone to keep those two in check.

A city battle was divided into three rounds; one for Tier 6 battle groups, one for Tier 5 battle groups, and one for Tier 4 battle groups. Participating cities were only allowed to dispatch up to ten battle groups for each round, and the goal of the city battle’s participants was to occupy as many capture points as possible.

The battlefield would have twenty capture points spread across them; ten on each city’s side. Every capture point was worth varying amounts of points. The capture points on the Tier 6 battlefield were worth ten points each, the capture points on the Tier 5 battlefield were worth eight points each, and the capture points on the Tier 4 battlefield were worth five points each. The city with the most points accumulated at the end of the three rounds would be the winner.

Due to the distribution of points, the performance of the Tier 6 battle groups played a significant role in determining a city battle’s outcome. If a city’s Tier 6 battle groups were overwhelmed and occupied barely any capture points, the city’s Tier 4 and Tier 5 battle groups would need to pull a miracle for it to win.

This was why Star Lake City’s City Lord had gone out of his way to recruit Red Frost into the Star Lake Legion.

“Holding those two back won’t be a problem,” Red Frost said, chuckling. Then, her expression turned a little gloomy as she looked at Riverlight City’s Tier 4 battle groups and said, “What worries me are the Riverlight Legion’s Tier 4 battle groups.”

“Worried?” Markless Blade also looked at the Riverlight Legion’s Tier 4 battle groups when he heard Red Frost’s words. However, he failed to find anything unusual about them. “I recognize most of the Riverlight Legion’s Tier 4 members. Aside from that smart-looking kid I don’t recognize, everyone else is a veteran of the Riverlight Legion. Could that kid be someone strong?”

“He’s Paimon’s Second Paragon, Reckless Knight,” Red Frost said. “I didn’t think the Divine Seal Saint could get his help. Our Tier 4 battle groups are most likely in danger with him around.”

“Reckless Knight?” Markless Blade’s mouth widened in shock. “He’s?that?Reckless Knight?”

Aside from being the Paimon Conglomerate’s Second Paragon, Reckless Knight was also the only genius from the Starlight Realm to have entered the Sacred Glory List, a list for the Greater God’s Domain’s top 1,000 budding Tier 5 players. In other words, he shouldn’t have any business being in a Tier 4 battle group.

“Although I don’t know what the Divine Seal Saint used to persuade him to drop from Tier 5 to Tier 4, I can’t see any hope for our Tier 4 battle groups to win now,” Red Frost said. Then, she turned to Markless Blade and continued, “Make sure not to fight Reckless Knight afterward. The capture points are far apart from one another, so if you see him at a capture point, immediately give up on it and look for another one.”

“I understand.” Markless Blade nervously nodded.

With Reckless Knight leading the Riverlight Legion’s Tier 4 battle groups, all the Star Lake Legion’s Tier 4 battle groups could do was try not to lose too terribly. Otherwise, even if the Tier 6 battle groups led by Red Frost won, the Star Lake Legion would still be at risk of losing.

…

Meanwhile, over at the VIP spectator stands on Star Lake City’s wall…

“It seems I have severely underestimated the Divine Seal Saint’s insanity. To think that he would invite Reckless Knight…” Bloodless Blade, in his suit and tie, said, a frown forming on his face as he looked at the Riverlight Legion’s Tier 4 battle groups.

Thousand Scars and Death Omen, who were getting their simulation equipment ready, also frowned.

“Mr. Blade, now that the other side has Reckless Knight helping them, I don’t think our plan to get close to Zero Wing will work,” Thousand Scars said.

Now that Thousand Scars and Death Omen had already joined the Paimon Conglomerate, they knew just how scarily powerful Reckless Knight was. Even someone as strong as Bloodless Blade was a match for Reckless Knight, let alone the two of them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

According to their original plan, Bloodless Blade would lend each of them a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set and a Legendary Weapon. In addition, thanks to the resource assistance they had received from Bloodless Blade during this period, they had already become one-star mental strength grandmasters. So, they could now perfectly wield a Legendary Weapon in simulation warfare. In their current state, not even Shi Feng would be a match for them in simulation warfare.

Meanwhile, with this newfound strength, the two of them would assist Zero Wing from the side in occupying capture points, making Zero Wing owe them a favor in doing so.

However, that was before they knew Reckless Knight would participate in the city battle. If they had to go up against Reckless Knight, there’d be nothing they could do against him.

“Don’t worry.” After pondering for a moment, Bloodless Blade reluctantly said, “If you meet him, tell him to ignore you in exchange for the favor he owes me. That should let you get close to Zero Wing more easily.”

Thousand Scars and Death Omen couldn’t help but grow excited when they heard Bloodless Blade’s words.

Previously, Shi Feng’s performance had given them an unreachable feeling. Now, though, they would have an opportunity to taste that same feeling.

As more battle groups from the Star Lake Legion arrived at the competition venue, the arrival of a five-man battle group instantly attracted everyone’s attention.
