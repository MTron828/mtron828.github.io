Chapter 53 - Darkness Descends

Shi Feng was still slightly unable to accept Sharlyn’s makeover. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, Shi Feng could be considered lucky for being able to meet the rumored Librarian. According to the information he knew, the Librarian of Red Leaf Town was full of mystery her whereabouts unknown. Shi Feng never imagined the Librarian to be the female NPC who participated in a robbery against him. If Shi Feng had truly started a fight with Sharlyn just now, the consequences would be unimaginable.

What did playing the pig to eat the tiger mean?

Sharlyn was definitely a veteran in this field.

Divine Official was the Tier 3 Job Advancement for an Oracle. In the case of Swordsman, it was called Sword King, whereas between these two was the Sword Master. Even if a Divine Official was only Level 20, she could still easily dispatch a Level 50 Lord. Perhaps, Sharlyn was the most powerful NPC in all of Red Leaf Town.

“Hehe, do you believe me now?” Sharlyn giggled at Shi Feng. Her entire body radiated a golden glow as if she were the reincarnation of Mother Mary. “Since you have some business with me, let’s talk about it at the Library.”

System: Player has activated the Epic Quest, ‘Darkness Descends.’ Contents unknown.

Shi Feng stumbled suddenly when he heard the system notification, nearly falling.

What was the reason for him to actually trigger this Epic Quest? ‘Darkness Descends’ was the famous Epic Quest of God’s Domain. From the information he collected from the internet and Shadow, the difficulty for completing this Epic Quest was truly unimaginable. Of course, the rewards were also unimaginably bountiful. In Shi Feng’s previous life, the person who completed this Epic Quest was the Spirit Emperor, Fantasy Extinguisher. He was a legendary character amongst Summoners. He was globally ranked within the top twenty Summoners and top five hundred in the entire game during the peak of God’s Domain.

Although he was only ranked within the top five hundred within God’s Domain, it should not be looked down upon. The entire world had a total population of one hundred billion. Although there were only one hundred million players in God’s Domain currently, this number would increase past ten billion in a year. In three years, the number of players playing God’s Domain would go past thirty billion.

Being able to rank within the top five hundred, Fantasy Extinguisher was definitely an amazing expert.

However, the thing that made Shi Feng feel odd was why this Epic Quest was found here. Fantasy Extinguisher’s starting location was not in Star-Moon Kingdom. Instead, it was in Black Dragon Empire, which was far from Star-Moon Kingdom. Black Dragon Empire was far more powerful than Star-Moon Kingdom. Its landmass was three times that of Star-Moon Kingdoms. The competition between players and Guilds there was much fiercer.

“Could it be a reward for getting the First Clear on the Hell Mode of a Dungeon?”

Shi Feng silently guessed as he followed Sharlyn. He felt it was a great possibility. Otherwise, why would an Epic Quest that should be found in Black Dragon Empire be found here in Star-Moon Kingdom?

At this moment, Shi Feng’s system communication rang. Shi Feng took a look at the caller, learning it was Gentle Snow contacting him.

“Miss Snow, do you have business with me?”

“Seeing that you’re logged on, I have something to tell you,” Gentle Snow spoke in a very indifferent tone. She was like mysterious ice, unchanging even after ten thousand years and had no interest towards anything at all. “I’m in need of money to purchase something, so I might need more time to return the 15 Silvers that I owe you. At the latest, I will return it to you by the end of today.”

“Alright. If you are really in a bind, tomorrow is fine as well,” Shi Feng calmly replied. He no longer paid any heed to the 15 Silver Coins Gentle Snow owed him. Currently, he had more than one Gold Coin on his person, and he was troubled over how to spend it.

Gentle Snow was slightly surprised by Shi Feng’s indifference even toward that much money. However, since Shi Feng had already said so, naturally, she would not be courteous to him. She softly thanked him, saying, “Thank you. However, aren’t you afraid I won’t return it, causing you to lose everything?”

“You are the Snow Goddess. Why would you even try to cheat an average player of such a small amount of money?” Shi Feng said with a grin.

“Average? You dare call yourself ‘average?’ Even I am shocked by the map and strategy you provided. We only spent an hour to clear the Normal Mode of the Deathly Forest, then went on to clear Hard Mode as well. Unfortunately, Hell Mode is just too hard. We could not clear it, no matter what.” Gentle Snow faintly smiled, saying, “I am very curious as to how you all managed to clear Hell Mode. If you said it was due to your party members’ help, I would not believe you. .”

To conquer the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest, she especially rushed over Elite members of Ouroboros from other Towns. However, they couldn’t get past the first Chieftain-rank Boss, Willie, no matter what they did. Willie’s damage was especially terrifying. Even a Shield Warrior fully equipped with Bronze Equipment could not tank it. Gentle Snow truly could not understand how Shi Feng’s party had cleared Hell Mode.

“Just lucky,” Shi Feng honestly said.

“Since you don’t want to say it, I still have to fight over a piece of equipment; so, I won’t speak with you any longer. Don’t forget our Dungeon appointment.” Gentle Snow did not continue pursuing Shi Feng about how he was able to clear Hell Mode. Just Hard Mode alone gave them a great harvest.

“Fight over equipment? Is it the Garrison Heavy Armor?” Shi Feng casually asked.

“En, how did you know? Are you also fighting for this equipment?” Gentle Snow nodded her head while saying. The Attributes for this Garrison Heavy Armor was too great. If they had this piece of equipment, there would not be much trouble when they entered the Level 3 Wolfman Dungeon.

Shi Feng knew he had said too much, but he remained calm as he replied, “Yes, but I didn’t think there would be that many people competing for it. I’ve already given up on it by now.”

“Indeed. The price has already reached 23 Silver Coins, and only a Guild with strong funding will be able to buy it. I won’t speak with you any longer. I still need to sell some items,” Gentle Snow disconnected the call after finishing her piece.

Meanwhile, Zhao Yueru, who sat beside Gentle Snow, pouted her delicate lips. She kicked up a fuss, complaining, “Snow, why must you let that bastard join our team, no matter what? That bastard was just lucky, and his skills are just average. He coincidentally encountered a small Dungeon like the Deathly Forest that did not change much since the game’s official release, and he very luckily cleared the Hell Mode of the Dungeon. It would be pointless bringing him into the twenty-man Team Dungeon. Also, the skill levels of his party members are just too miserable to even look at. They would definitely become a burden to our progress.”

The Elite members of Ouroboros standing behind Gentle Snow also agreed with Zhao Yueru’s words. They were the Elites of Ouroboros. How could a group of average players compare to them?

“I feel that Big Brother Ye Feng is not that simple. He was definitely humble when he said he cleared the Dungeon due to luck. His skills are amazing, so it wouldn’t be disadvantageous inviting him to join us,” Xiao Yue’er softly offered her personal opinion.

“Little girl, what do you know about liars? You just don’t know how bad that bastard is. Also, he spent that much time just reaching Level 1. His skills are only so-so. This lady can instakill him with a single Flame Explosion,” Zhao Yueru gave Xiao Yue’er a stare, speaking confidently.

“Alright, stop arguing. I, too, feel Ye Feng is not that simple. Otherwise, how could he clear the Hell Mode of the Deathly Forest with a group of novices? When we enter the Team Dungeon, we will see where his standards lay. If he is not bad, I might consider recruiting him into the God-Slaying Army. Now, however, let’s first bid on this Garrison Heavy Armor,” Gentle Snow let out a soft cough.

Everyone abruptly became silent, astonished. They never imagined that Gentle Snow would have such considerations. She was actually planning to let Ye Feng join the God-Slaying Army. The members of the God-Slaying Army were the Elites amongst the Elites of Ouroboros. Each member had great skill, and they were experts who were selected out of tens of thousands of players. All of the Guild’s resources were prioritized on the God-Slaying Army. Aside from the Guild Leader and Sub-Leader, members of the God-Slaying Army had the most authority within the Guild.

Many experts in the virtual world struggled tirelessly to join the God-Slaying Army. However, a large majority of these people were all rejected. On the other hand, Ye Feng, who suddenly appeared before them, actually possessed a very great chance of entering the God-Slaying Army, and such a sight had caused great envy within them.
