Chapter 283 – God Mode Regional Dungeon

“You can rest assured now, right, Team Leader Lunarite?”

Shi Feng smiled when he saw Colorful Lunarite’s gaze fixed on the Magic Tactical Vehicle.

“I see why you aren’t afraid of Divine Hunters and Morning Light now…” Colorful Lunarite said, realization dawning upon her as she swept her gaze across the Zero Wing members aboard the warship.

Mana was the foundation of everything in God’s Domain. For players, the stronger their mana, the stronger their Skills and Spells would become.

Apart from not having any Tier 4 Skills and Spells, the Zero Wing members present were no longer any different from actual Tier 4 players. Meanwhile, a force of 100 Tier 4 experts was not something any power in the current Miniature Ancient World could go up against.

Yet, funnily enough, the various powers thought that Black Flame was Zero Wing’s only Tier 4 expert.

Should Crying Sea City’s various powers try to take action against Zero Wing out in the fields, the outcome would definitely shake the entire Miniature Ancient World.

Subsequently, Zero Wing’s members could be seen effortlessly slaughtering the Level 130 Grand Lord ranked sea monsters in the Bipolar Sea. Because of the difference in tiers, the level suppression effect was practically negligible.

Moreover, Zero Wing’s members didn’t even require the assistance of the Bronze Warship’s artillery. Just the Silver Combat Techniques they used were enough to turn a Grand Lord into an abundant amount of EXP in only a few minutes.

...

“Wu Xiaoxiao tricked me! She said her little sister was only at the Refinement Realm, while her juniors hadn’t even reached the Refinement Realm. So, what is up with all these Silver Combat Techniques?!”

Crow Feather’s eyes twitched when she saw Wu Lingling and the others executing one Silver Combat Technique after another, their skillfulness in using these combat techniques superior to even her. At a glance, their combat standards were not the slightest bit inferior to hers.

Silver Combat Techniques!

These weren’t combat techniques that Refinement Realm experts could learn. Even most Void Realm experts would have difficulty learning one.

Yet, Wu Lingling and the others had learned at least three Silver Combat Techniques each, covering the three main categories of defensive combat techniques, offensive combat techniques, and footwork. Speaking purely in terms of combat power, Crow Feather doubted she could even match Wu Lingling and the others. These so-called juniors of Wu Xiaoxiao were already close to matching Colorful Lunarite, the Gray Goose Team’s team leader.

Subsequently, the further Shi Feng and the others progressed into the Bipolar Sea, the more Colorful Lunarite became tempted by the Magic Tactical Vehicle.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, may I know if Zero Wing has any intentions of selling this Magic Tactical Vehicle?” Colorful Lunarite asked.

Zero Wing’s main force members might have extraordinary strength, but the real reason they could have such strength was entirely because of the Magic Tactical Vehicle. Otherwise, Zero Wing’s main force could, at most, contend against the various hegemonic powers’ main force. It absolutely couldn’t achieve overwhelming victory, let alone fight against groups of Grand Lord-ranked sea monsters.

“Of course, we intend to sell it,” Shi Feng said as he turned to Colorful Lunarite with a smile. “This will be one the main products Zero Wing offers in the future.”

Zero Wing was incredibly poor right now. If there was an opportunity to make money, Shi Feng naturally wouldn’t let it get away. Not to mention, he had deliberately displayed the Magic Tactical Vehicle to Colorful Lunartie this time.

“May I know the price?” Colorful Lunarite asked, an excited look appearing on her face.

Originally, she had only thought of trying her luck when she asked Shi Feng about the sale of the Magic Tactical Vehicle. Although she didn’t think Zero Wing would sell such a powerful war weapon, it wouldn’t hurt to ask.

“One Bronze Warship or two million Star Coins,” Shi Feng stated.

“This…” Colorful Lunarite was rendered speechless by Shi Feng’s answer. “I’m afraid I’ll have to discuss this with Vice President Xia first…”

Trading a Bronze Warship for a Magic Tactical Vehicle was out of the question. Two million Star Coins wasn’t a small sum, either. It was an amount of money that the average person in the Greater World would never see in their lifetime. Even for Xia Qingying, this was a significant expenditure. So, Colorful Lunarite couldn’t give Shi Feng an answer on the spot.

Shi Feng wasn’t surprised by this response. He, too, was aware that his asking price was very high. Afterward, he took a look at the coordinates shown by Elemental Search.

“We’re finally here.”

Excitement appeared on Shi Feng’s face as he looked at the island ahead of him and verified that the Grade 1 ore vein was located on the island.

However, when the Bronze Warship moved within 1,000 yards of the island, a gigantic magic array that covered a radius of several thousand yards suddenly appeared in the sky above them. The magic array was so massive that the people on board the Bronze Warship couldn’t even see the entire magic array at a glance.

After this magic array appeared in the sky, space underneath it began to grow chaotic. Spatial tears appeared all over the place, and there was no place safe for the Bronze Warship.

This is…a regional event??Shi Feng was incredibly familiar with this scene.

Events would randomly appear across the entire God’s Domain. However, these events were normally caused by players. Meanwhile, whenever an event occurred, a special space would be created in the area where the event was triggered. An example of this special space would be Regional Dungeons.

…

Regional System Announcement: This area will be promoted into a God Mode Regional Dungeon. All players are advised to be careful of the ensuing spatial turmoil.

A God Mode Regional Dungeon??Shi Feng was stunned by the system announcement.

Most Regional Dungeons could be categorized into three difficulties: Normal Mode, Hard Mode, and Hell Mode. However, there were two more levels of difficulty above this: Asura Mode and God Mode.

Of the two, God Mode Regional Dungeons were known as lands of no return. They were forbidden lands for players under Tier 6. Even Tier 6 players would face a high risk of death in a God Mode Regional Dungeon. Moreover, the death penalty inside a God Mod Regional Dungeon was incredibly severe, so much so that one would have to start a new account if one wasn’t careful.

Shi Feng wasn’t the only person stunned by this unexpected development. Everyone on the Bronze Warship was similarly dumbfounded.

A God Mode Regional Dungeon!

Regional Dungeons of such difficulty were extremely rare, even on the main continent. Meanwhile, every one of these God Mode Regional Dungeons was the nightmare of the various powers. Aside from a select few Super Guilds, nobody else dared to enter God Mode Regional Dungeons.

Yet, now, a God Mode Regional Dungeon had appeared right before their very eyes…

“Everyone, stick together in groups of three to five! Nobody is allowed to move alone!” Shi Feng shouted when he saw the number of spatial tears in the surrounding area increasing. “Once the spatial turmoil ends, gather at the island’s shore! Do not try to explore the island! Do not…try to explore…”

The gigantic magic array had spread out with the island at its center. So, it was obvious that the event’s starting point was at the heart of the island. This would also be the most dangerous location of the God Mode Regional Dungeon. Even if this was only a level 130 Regional Dungeon, a Tier 6 God-ranked expert would still fall if they weren’t careful at the Regional Dungeon’s heart.

However, before Shi Feng could finish speaking, space around the warship shattered and transformed into numerous spatial tears. Then, everyone on the warship was quickly sucked into these spatial tears and disappeared from the sea. When the gigantic magic array in the sky disappeared sometime later, it was as if Shi Feng and the others had never appeared in the area.
