Chapter 289 – Another Monster?

“Commander Laura?”

Su Qianliu stopped running as she turned to look at the figure that had emerged from the dense forest and stood in Meteor’s way, her eyes widening in shock.

It had already been some time since Laura Crader had disappeared from the Asura Mercenary Alliance. Outsiders might not know what Laura Crader had left to do, but Su Qianliu knew that Laura had left to challenge her Tier 4 promotion. So, logically, Laura wouldn’t appear in the Land of Ancient Dragons.

Is she the woman mentioned in the reports??When Colorful Lunarite saw Laura, she couldn’t help but scrutinize the other party out of curiosity.

According to the information the Green God Corporation gathered, Laura Crader was one of the few fourth-floor experts belonging to the Asura Mercenary Alliance. The corporation had even suspected that Laura might be a titled expert.

However, because Laura had suddenly disappeared after the Myriad Worlds’ Descent expansion pack took effect, the various powers gradually stopped paying attention to her. At this point, the name of Laura Crader was all but forgotten in the Miniature Ancient World.

So, Colorful Lunarite didn’t think that Laura Crader would appear in the Land of Ancient Dragons of all places.

Moreover, it was obvious that Laura was no longer the same as when she last fought in the Boundary Mountain Range. The aura she exuded clearly indicated that she had already reached Tier 4 and become a bona fide Sword Emperor.

However, after their brief surprise, a wave of unease also spread in the hearts of Su Qianliu and Colorful Lunarite.

Tier 4 players might stand at the top of the current Miniature Ancient World, but one Tier 4 player was unlikely to be enough to stop the Paimon Conglomerate’s team. It was especially true for the likes of Meteor and Star Snail. The two were far stronger than the average titled expert.

“You want to be our opponent? Do you think you are worthy of that?!” Death Omen sneered contemptuously as she looked at Laura Crader. Then, she immediately poised herself to resume chasing Su Qianliu and the others.

It was true that Laura Crader had shown incredible strength at the Boundary Mountain Range. It was also true that she had reached Tier 4 already. With her achievements, even the various hegemonic powers would have to be wary of her.

......

However, it was a different story for the Paimon Conglomerate. The conglomerate’s team of geniuses was vastly superior to the teams the various hegemonic powers could come up with. Not even the God List’s top five experts would dare to act arrogantly in front of the conglomerate’s genius team, let alone ordinary titled experts.

Yet, the moment Death Omen took her first step, an arm suddenly appeared in her path, blocking her advance.

“Commander Meteor?”

Death Omen looked at the person blocking her path, her mind failing to understand what Meteor was trying to do.

However, at the same time as Death Omen posed her question, she also noticed a strange situation.

Whether it was the Crimson Sword Emperor Meteor or the Divine Shield Star Snail, neither wore their previous look of nonchalance. Instead, replacing their calm expression was a solemn one. Even their eyes carried strong hints of alertness. This was a reaction they would normally only make when they were going up against experts capable of threatening them.

While watching Laura Crader slowly making her way over, Meteor said in a low tone, “Don’t act rashly. This person isn’t simple.”

“Not simple?” Death Omen was surprised. “Could it be that even you are not confident in dealing with her, Commander Meteor?”

“I can’t be sure without fighting her,” Meteor said. “But I am certain she is not weaker than Black Flame.”

“Not weaker than Black Flame?” When Death Omen heard Meteor’s evaluation, she couldn’t help but take another look at Laura Crader, her mind in disbelief.

Death Omen had already witnessed Black Flame’s strength. He was a monster capable of surviving the full-powered attack of a Tier 5 Demon King despite being only a Tier 4 player. This was a feat not even Meteor and Star Snail could accomplish.

Honestly, Death Omen already had a hard time accepting the fact that Zero Wing had such a monster in its midst. Yet, now, she was being told that the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s Laura Crader was also a monster on Black Flame’s standard? How could she possibly believe this?

It should be known that the Asura Mercenary Alliance was only a group of nobodies gathered by Zero Wing. Its strength couldn’t even compare to the local Super Guilds, let alone the Flower of Seven Sins. So, how could a monster of Black Flame’s caliber possibly appear in the mercenary alliance?

Amidst Death Omen’s daze, Meteor began walking toward Laura Crader. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Commander Laura, since you wish to intervene in Zero Wing’s affairs, would you be willing to block three of my attacks? If you block all three, my team will give up on targeting Zero Wing’s team. However, if you can’t, I hope you will stop interfering in this matter. What do you think?” Meteor asked as he unsheathed the broken sword he carried on his back.

Death Omen sighed in relief when she heard Meteor’s words.

The Flower of Seven Sins had no control over the Paimon Conglomerate’s actions. If Meteor did not wish to fight Laura Crader for the Flower of Seven Sins, there was nothing Death Omen could do about it.

However, by the looks of things, it would seem that Meteor planned to try and fight Laura Crader.

Meanwhile, should Laura Crader refuse Meteor’s suggestion or fail to block Meteor’s attacks, Zero Wing’s main force would be doomed.

Laura Crader was a little surprised by Meteor’s suggestion. Then, she calmly responded, “Alright, I agree with your conditions. If I can block three of your attacks, I will have to ask you to cease your actions against Zero Wing.”

“Of course. I always keep my word.”

Meteor nodded and raised his broken sword with both hands. Immediately, the aura he radiated skyrocketed in intensity, his aura not at all inferior to when he had his Berserk Skill activated during his fight with Demon King Firenze. It was obvious that he treated Laura Crader as a formidable enemy.

They’re having a one-on-one fight?

Colorful Lunarite gaped in shock when she saw this development from a distance. She never thought Meteor would choose to fight Laura Crader in a one-on-one duel.

The Paimon Conglomerate’s team held a significant numbers advantage. Logically, even if Laura Crader was now a Tier 4 Sword Emperor, she could, at most, hold Meteor back by herself, while the Paimon Conglomerate’s team’s remaining nine Tier 4 experts would have free rein. Meanwhile, these nine Tier 4 experts would be more than enough to annihilate Zero Wing’s team. So, there was no need for Meteor to go through the hassle of challenging Laura to a duel.

The only reason Meteor would take such a course of action was that he felt that Laura Crader alone was strong enough to pose a significant threat to his team, and Colorful Lunarite found this situation to be absolutely astonishing.

Before Colorful Lunarite could recover from her shock, Meteor’s broken sword had transformed into hundreds of threads that attacked Laura Crader from various directions.

Each of these threads carried enough power to tear apart space and heavily injure Superior Mythic monsters of the same level. Moreover, they could even increase their power by forming weaves of ten threads or more.

Tier 4 Advanced Silver Combination Combat Technique, Thousand Threads!

How foolish of her to give Meteor time to execute Thousand Threads!

When Death Omen saw Laura Crader patiently waiting for Meteor to attack her, she couldn’t help but laugh in her mind.

Anyone familiar with Meteor would know about his trademark move, Thousand Threads. It was an attack that combined the Tier 4 Legacy Skill Spatial Dicing and the Advanced Silver Combat Technique Tornado.

It was with this move that Meteor had injured Saint Nine, the third-ranked player on the God-ranked Expert List. Had Saint Nine not activated an Invulnerability Skill in time, he would have definitely died to this move.

The only flaw in this combination attack was its somewhat long execution time. However, so long as Meteor successfully executed the combination attack, his opponents would die without fail unless they possessed an Invulnerability Skill.

Subsequently, the several hundred threads could be seen attacking Laura Crader from all directions. Yet, even as the threads closed on her, Laura did not make any movements. She didn’t even draw the longsword hanging by her waist.

Boom!

The sound of a loud explosion shook the area, followed by a blinding light that brightly illuminated the entire coastline. The light was so dazzling that everyone found it difficult to look at the source directly.

When the blinding light faded, Laura could be seen standing in her original position, her right hand sheathing the longsword she had drawn without anyone’s notice. As for the threads that previously covered the sky, they had vanished as if they never existed…
