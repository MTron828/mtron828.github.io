Chapter 946 – Legend

“They left?”

“Why did they leave?”

“What in heaven is going on?!”

The spectators were dumbfounded when the four Epic Siege Weapons disappeared from Plot 079. They never expected such an outcome.

Victory was clearly in the four royal powers’ grasp. It was only a matter of time before they killed him. Yet, seconds after the battle began, they retreated, fleeing as if they had just seen a ghost. This situation confused everyone watching.

“Vice Guild Leader, what happened to those four powers? Why did they leave so suddenly?” Shuoyun asked, her mouth agape.

Each of the four royal powers had mobilized an Epic Siege Weapon against Shi Feng. This was potentially enough force to bring down even a Taboo Boss. Yet, the four royal powers had fled from Shi Feng.

“It should be that Black Flame caused substantial damage to those Epic Siege Weapons,” Lunar River said, recalling Shi Feng’s sword light shattering the Lightning Nation’s defensive barrier and hurling it. Then, she continued with mixed feelings, “Players still cannot repair Siege Weapons, so any damage a Siege Weapon suffers is permanent. Once a Siege Weapon runs out of durability, it will be scrapped.

“Although the four royal powers can secure a better placement in the competition if they obtain Black Flame’s tokens, the benefits they can reap from the competition are nothing compared to the significance of Epic Siege Weapons. So long as the four representatives have functioning brains, they will not continue to fight Black Flame.”

Originally, Lunar River had not taken Zero Wing’s strength seriously. However, she had never expected the Guild to show up with sixth-floor experts. She also hadn’t expected Shi Feng to be able to fight four royal powers and win. Contrary to her thoughts, King’s Paradise was inferior to Zero Wing, not the other way around.

…

At this time, many other spectating experts also realized why the four royal powers retreated, and they couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng with admiration and amazement. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Merely the courage needed to fight four royal powers as a single person would disqualify most players in God’s Domain, let alone the courage needed to fight four Epic Siege Weapons.

Yet, Shi Feng had not only done so but also achieved a big victory. He had frightened the four royal powers to the point where they did not dare to fight him. This was unprecedented in the history of all three races. It deserved to be considered a legend in God’s Domain’s history.

…

“What a pity,” Kowloon Demon sighed when he saw that the four royal powers had retreated. “Those four Epic Siege Weapons should still have more unused abilities. If Guild Leader Black Flame had stayed his hand a little longer, we might have been able to uncover all their abilities and reduce our Guild’s losses when we fight them in the future.”

“Although the intelligence we collected is a little lacking, we still gained a lot from this trip,” Purgatory Jade said, chuckling as she watched Lunar River’s team getting ready to leave. “It truly is surprising that this Greater God’s Domain has an expert who can use Tier 6 Overlimit Skills and an expert who has reached that realm of the sixth-floor standard. Once we return with their battle videos, we should be able to convince that monster to join Dragon’s Crown.”

Kowloon Demon nodded in agreement, excitement flashing in his eyes.

Although they didn’t get to collect much information in Everlasting City’s competition, they did witness a few exciting experts. Once they returned to their homeworld with these experts’ information, Dragon’s Crown could recruit many of the remnant primordial world’s independent experts, especially those nigh-invincible monsters. Those monsters had remained undefeated in their homeworld for a long time and could never find any worthy opponents. If Dragon’s Crown could successfully tempt these monsters to join it using the Greater God’s Domain’s experts as a lure, the Guild’s strength would increase significantly.

…

After the four royal powers left, Shi Feng did not waste even a second of Primordial Dragon’s Power’s five-minute duration, promptly flying to Plot 037, which was nearest to Plot 079, and using his powerful perception to hunt for players.

In less than three minutes, he had eradicated the remaining thousand or so players in Plot 037 and earned over 10,000 tokens, putting Zero Wing’s total to more than 80,000. This, in turn, elevated Zero Wing to the top 10 in the total number of tokens collected, putting it right behind the six royal powers.

However, as the end of the competition drew closer, the struggle for tokens escalated. All six royal powers stopped conserving their strength, using their Epic Siege Weapons to sweep through plot after plot of land and harvest tokens at a frightening rate.

Besides the royal powers, the 35 apex powers also unveiled their respective trump cards, deploying Siege Weapons and using items that rivaled Pseudo-Tier 7 Spells in power. Even sixth-floor experts would get obliterated if they weren’t careful against these apex powers.

As the three races’ powers fought, many of their young experts displayed outstanding feats—to the point where even Shi Feng, a reincarnated player, was astounded. He had never expected the standards of the three races’ experts to surpass those of his previous life.

First, there was Rin, Ninth Street’s Earthen Princess. She had seemingly achieved the sixth-floor standard while fighting the forces of seven apex powers. At the moment of her breakthrough, she masterfully executed a Peak Gold Implement Manipulation Technique and one-shotted nearly a hundred experts.

Next, there was Daystar, the Sun Dynasty’s Arbiter of Death. Although she didn’t achieve a breakthrough in the middle of battle, that was because she was already at the sixth-floor standard this entire time. She revealed this secret when she single-handedly obliterated an apex power’s 500-man team, shocking the Holy Race’s various powers.

On the human race’s side, Elise, Demon’s Gate’s Star Maiden, also revealed that she had reached the sixth-floor standard during an encounter with Daystar. As neither side had an advantage, their fight ended in a draw.

The Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Verdant Rainbow also performed spectacularly, executing Tier 6 Skills at nearly the Overlimit standard. With these powerful Skills, she sniped over a hundred experts of three apex powers from a great distance, stunning all the spectators.

When the bell signaling the end of the competition rang, the fighting in Everlasting City finally stopped. Then, a translucent screen appeared above the city, showing the participants’ rankings.
