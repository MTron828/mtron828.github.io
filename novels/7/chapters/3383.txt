Chapter 458 – Holy Ancestor?

Unrestrained Lionheart’s expression paled as he looked at the giant of a woman standing before him. Then, he looked to Shi Feng and wryly smiled, saying, “Mr. Black Flame, I think we received a little more than what we bargained for…”

The inside of the hall was shrouded in mist, so they couldn’t determine the woman’s appearance and strength just now. However, that was no longer the case now that the woman was standing right in front of them.

Although the woman’s blue-rimmed white hood prevented them from seeing her face, the sight of the woman’s stats bewildered everyone. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

[Goddess’s Shadow] (Ancient God’s Doppelganger, Tier 6)

Level 240

HP ? ? ? ? ? ?

Level 240?

Is this really just a doppelganger?

At this time, White Owl, Death Omen, and Thousand Scars similarly experienced despair. The three of them previously had the fortune of seeing an Ancient God in person in the Miniature Ancient World’s World Passage. So, they could tell that in terms of presence, the Goddess’s Shadow before them was much stronger than even the Ancient God they met in the World Passage.

Under normal circumstances, even a team of Tier 6 experts would have to flee if they encountered this Goddess’s Shadow, let alone a bunch of Tier 5 players like themselves. After all, the Goddess’s Shadow’s level of 240 was a height most Tier 6 players in the Greater God’s Domain struggled to reach. Not to mention, as an Ancient God, the Goddess’s Shadow possessed a Life Rating vastly superior to Dragons of the same tier.

The Goddess of Space truly is an existence that has surpassed Primordial Gods.

Standing before the Goddess’s Shadow, Shi Feng also experienced unprecedented pressure. Right now, it felt like he was standing in front of a real Ancient God rather than a mere doppelganger.

It should be known that doppelgangers in God’s Domain would always be much weaker than the main body. Normally, a Tier 6 God’s doppelganger would only be at the Tier 5 standard. The doppelganger’s Life Rating would also be inferior to an actual God. At most, a God’s doppelganger would have Life Rating rivaling four-winged Valkyries.

Yet, the Goddess’s Shadow’s Life Rating reached the standard of Ancient Gods. With this doppelganger’s level and Life Rating, even if it was only at Tier 5, it would still be impossible for their team to defeat it.

Just as everyone thought their raid had come to an end, the Goddess’s Shadow suddenly spoke up.

“After all this time, someone has finally come.” Indifferently looking at Shi Feng’s group, the Goddess’s Shadow asked, “Can I ask you all to lend me a helping hand?”

“A helping hand? May I know what you require us to do, Esteemed Goddess?” Shi Feng curiously asked.

In terms of combat power, the Goddess’s Shadow definitely stood among the very apex of the Greater God’s Domain. Even apex powers would have difficulty slaying it. So, Shi Feng found it hard to believe the Goddess’s Shadow would need their help.

“Simple. I need you to extinguish the Ancient God over there. Otherwise, it won’t be long before he breaks out of his seal and terrorize the Greater God’s Domain,” the Goddess’s Shadow said.

“Kill him?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but turn to the figure standing in the middle of the hall.

At this time, the mist in the hall gradually dissipated, revealing a figure restrained by dozens of translucent chains. There were faint purple-gold divine runes flashing on the chains, the runes giving every chain a tyrannical Divine Might. Rather than inanimate objects, it felt as if every one of these chains was a Tier 6 God.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but grow confused as he looked at the gigantic man in the middle of the hall.

From what Shi Feng recalled, the World Mode Courtyard of Space’s Final Boss should be a four-winged Tier 6 Archangel, an existence with a Life Rating superior to Valkyries and close to matching ordinary Dragons of the same tier.

Basically, teams needed to defeat a monster that was about as strong as a Tier 6 Dragon. The only difference was that, unlike Dragons that relied on having a powerful Physique and access to Draconic Magic for their strength, Archangels relied on combat techniques and weapons for their strength. This made Archangels much more difficult to deal with for ordinary teams.

As for the Goddess’s Shadow’s existence and request, Shi Feng had never heard about these things existing in his previous life.

What surprised Shi Feng even more was the man restrained in the hall. Silver runes covered the man’s entire body, and Shi Feng was incredibly familiar with these runes.

A member of the Holy Race!

Indeed! The man restrained in the hall was a Tier 6 Holy God!

Moreover, the man wasn’t any ordinary Tier 6 God. Seeing how the man was covered in holy runes, the man was most likely a Holy Ancestor…

A Holy Ancestor!

Out of the many Holy Gods that existed among the Holy Race, those who could be regarded as Holy Ancestors were few and far between. Meanwhile, their existence was akin to the Greater God’s Domain’s Primordial Gods.

So, when Shi Feng heard that the Goddess’s Shadow’s request was for them to kill a Holy Ancestor, he couldn’t help but feel as if the other party was joking with them.

…

[Manoset] (Holy Ancestor, Tier ? ? ?)

Level ? ? ?

HP ? ? ? ? ? ?

…

Seemingly noticing everyone’s concerns, the Goddess’s Shadow said, “Do not worry. I will use my power to weaken him. He won’t be able to exert more than 10% of his strength. With your strength, you should be strong enough to fight him.”

As soon as the Goddess’s Shadow finished speaking, a series of system notifications rang in everyone’s ears.

…

System: Congratulations! You have triggered the World-ranked Event Goddess of Space’s Seal. Assist the Goddess’s Shadow in killing the Holy Ancestor.

System: You are advised to challenge the Goddess of Space’s Seal event with everything you have. Failure to complete the event will lead to massive changes throughout the Greater God’s Domain. You will also be dealt with using the most severe punishment.

…

“A World-ranked Event?”

“Kill the Holy Ancestor?”

“What’s going on here?”

Unrestrained Lionheart and the others froze when they heard the content of the system notifications.

Whether it was the World-ranked Event or the Holy Ancestor, neither were things they had heard of before. Even so, they could still determine the severity of the situation based on the information they understood.

Everyone present had seen how powerful the Holy Race’s players were, so they couldn’t even begin to imagine how powerful a God from the Holy Race could be.

Subsequently, before Shi Feng, the leader of the team, could make a response to the Goddess’s Shadow’s request for help, the other party suddenly vanished. Then, the Goddess’s Shadow reappeared in the air in the middle of the hall and chanted a series of obscure divine incantations. Immediately afterward, over a thousand magic arrays appeared all over the hall, every magic array being a threefold magic array exceeding the Great Grandmaster rank.

Suddenly, the divine runes on the chains binding the Holy Ancestor glowed as they rapidly sapped his strength. However, even as the Holy Ancestor was growing weaker, not only did he not feel upset, but he even started to smile. At the same time, terrifying bursts of Holy Power spread across the entire Courtyard of Space.

“Hahaha! Space! Did you honestly think I’ve made no preparations throughout all these years?” Manoset said, laughing. Then, he coldly swept his gaze across Shi Feng’s group and continued, “Pitiful adventurers, today will mark the end of your lives!”

...

As soon as Manoset finished speaking, the chains binding him started to break one after another. Meanwhile, with every chain that broke, Manoset’s aura also grew in intensity. At one point, his mere presence had caused the entire castle to tremble. Shi Feng and the others also found themselves unable to move their bodies…

“Die!”

After breaking out of the chains restraining his arms, Manoset swung his fist in the direction of Shi Feng’s group.
