Chapter 185 - Ruined Mountain Range

Shi Feng pulled back his sword, sliding it back into its scabbard.

Immediately after, an agonizing wail resounded throughout the streets.

Brilliant Wargod stared Shi Feng with eyes filled with poisonous hatred. However, there was also a thread of fear hidden within that hatred. After all, Shi Feng had only used a single Swordsman skill, Chop, to kill him instantly. Brilliant Wargod’s past confidence and arrogance had, at this moment, shattered.

He quietly watched as his HP frantically decreased, and in the blink of an eye, he only had 1 HP remaining. Brilliant Wargod fell to his knees, his eyes filled with shock and fear.

As this was only a duel, Brilliant Wargod could escape death this time.

However, as Brilliant Wargod regained some of his spirit, he finally understood Shi Feng’s comment of this would be a boring battle. At that time, Brilliant Wargod had still thought that it was Shi Feng’s arrogance, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth. In reality, however...

“No!”

Brilliant Wargod exclaimed as he noticed his levels swiftly decreasing. In the blink of an eye, he had already fallen to Level 0.

Although duels would not allow players to die, the punishment the losing party received would not be altered in the slightest.

The sinister punishment Brilliant Wargod had previously set for Shi Feng had all come biting back at him. The system also transferred the map he gambled into Shi Feng’s inventory. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This time, not only had he dug his own grave, but he also bought his own coffin, suffering twice the loss.

“Miss Aqua, I’m done. Let’s continue our talks,” Shi Feng looked towards Aqua Rose with a smile as he spoke.

Brilliant Wargod glared at Shi Feng with a malicious expression, his teeth gnashing. Immediately after Shi Feng turned his back on Brilliant Wargod, the Shield Warrior took out a Tier 1 Magic Scroll, using it on Shi Feng.

“Black Flame, die!” the Tier 1 Magic Scroll that Brilliant Wargod used was a flame-type spell called Flame Spear. The scroll contained a relatively strong, single-target, destructive spell. In any case, Brilliant Wargod had already fallen to Level 0. He would not suffer a loss if the guards captured and jailed him. At worst, he would just have to delete his account and start all over again. It would be acceptable if he could kill Shi Feng and appease his hatred.

“Careful...!” Aqua Rose warned.

Shi Feng did not expect Brilliant Wargod to be insane enough to dare attack him in the middle of Blackwing City. However, due to the short distance between them, it was too late by the time Shi Feng realized Brilliant Wargod’s actions.

The Flame Spear instantly struck Shi Feng’s back, and Brilliant Wargod revealed a sinister smile as his attack landed.

This Flame Spear was Brilliant Wargod’s trump card. It was capable of causing up to 2,000 flame damage to a single target. Even if Shi Feng were amazing, he was a single Swordsman. How high could his HP be? It would already be heaven-defying if he had 1,200 HP. With this 2,000 damage, Shi Feng would unquestionably die.

After the raging flames dissipated, Shi Feng’s HP madly fell.

“Hahaha! So what if you are amazing? Since you dared provoke this young master, only death awaits you!” Brilliant Wargod laughed loudly as he watched Shi Feng’s full HP trickle to zero.

“Brilliant Wargod, you are too despicable!” With this action, Aqua Rose finally saw through to Brilliant Wargod’s true self. She did not think that he would be such despicable filth without even the most basic self-respect.

“Despicable? The victor becomes king, whereas the loser becomes a bandit! He can only blame himself for his own lack of skills!” Brilliant Wargod sneered as he spoke.

However, Brilliant Wargod’s smile quickly faded the moment he discovered that Shi Feng’s HP had stopped decreasing after reaching 20%.

“Why? Why aren’t you dead?” Looking at Shi Feng standing there, Brilliant Wargod retreated several steps; his trembling finger pointed at Shi Feng as he panicked.

“This, you don’t need to know. However, since you’ve dared take action here, I’m guessing that you’re prepared to receive your punishment,” Shi Feng softly said. He chuckled as he clapped at the flames remaining on his body, extinguishing them.

The damage caused by the Flame Spear could indeed kill a Level 14 player with one hit. However, Shi Feng was different. He possessed 20 points of Fire Resistance. He also had the Basic Body Strengthening passive skill activated, which would somewhat increase some of the hidden magic resistance. In addition, Shi Feng currently had a maximum HP of 1,840 points, so a single Flame Spear was not enough to kill him. To put it another way, Tier 1 Magic had no possibility of killing him with a single hit. At most, it would gravely injure him.

“Im... Impossible...!” Brilliant Wargod was completely dumbfounded by this scene. After all, that was the most powerful Tier 1 Magic Scroll he had in his possession.

“It can’t be, right?” Aqua Rose was similarly shocked. Fire-type magic possessed the highest destructive force of all elemental magic. Yet, Shi Feng had survived after taking a direct hit from a Tier 1 fire-type spell. Just what kind of Defense did he possess? Aqua Rose even started to suspect that Shi Feng was a Shield Warrior or a Guardian Knight in disguise. However, even Guardian Knights possessing the highest magic resistance could not forcefully survive this move.

While the two suffered their shock, the Black Knights of Blackwing City had arrived.

Compared to other towns and normal cities, Blackwing City’s management was far more strict. The penalties it administered were even more unbearable. Hence, in Shi Feng’s previous life, no players dared cause a scene while in Blackwing City. Any who did simply sought their own deaths. Not to mention, Brilliant Wargod had actually dared attack Shi Feng, who possessed the status of a Demon Hunter.

Hence, Shi Feng did not immediately take action against Brilliant Wargod. In reality, he simply waited for the punishment Blackwing City would provide to Brilliant Wargod.

“Brilliant Wargod, you have committed an offense against Blackwing City’s laws. Moreover, you attacked the Lord Demon Hunter. From now on, you will remain in jail in Blackwing City for 15 days. After your release, all your Attributes would be decreased by 10% for a duration of ten days, and the EXP you gain will decrease by 20%,” the Black Knight Captain walked up to Brilliant Wargod, stating his verdict.

Hearing such a penalty, Aqua Rose sucked in a cold breath. This penalty was simply too heavy. Even if they locked Brilliant Wargod up for 15 days, as an elder of Twilight Echo, there were other people available to help him level back up. However, now that he was Level 0, with the 15-day gap and 20% EXP gain reduction, Brilliant Wargod would need to grind ceaselessly for over a month to catch up with the level of the majority of the players, not to mention catching up to the top-ranking players.

“Hahaha! Black Flame, I admit that you are amazing! However, from the moment I took action, I had already decided to delete my account and start all over again! Did you really think I would fear the system punishment?” Although Brilliant Wargod trembled slightly when he heard the penalty he was to receive, giving it another thought, he planned to delete and rebuild his account. What should he be afraid of?

“Is that so? Then, I look forward to you deleting and rebuilding your account,” Shi Feng smiled faintly, not bothering to explain.

Seeing Brilliant Wargod’s confident smile, Shi Feng could not bear to shatter his fantasies. Brilliant Wargod thought too lightly of God’s Domain. If a pig-brained person like Brilliant Wargod could think of such a method to escape punishment, the Main God System would certainly have a solution.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, plenty of players had thought of God’s Domain as only a virtual reality game; they thought they could do whatever they wanted. There were even some players who had done unscrupulous and condemnable things towards female NPCs. After all, these players all thought they could simply avoid punishment by deleting and rebuilding their accounts from scratch. However, the outcome spoke differently. Unless one no longer wanted to play God’s Domain, otherwise, any and all punishments would be meted out. No matter how many times one deleted their accounts or changed their gaming helmets, the consequences were inescapable.

Although God’s Domain was a virtual reality game, it had its own bottom line as well; the rules of God’s Domain were the final bottom line. Any and all who dared go past this bottom line would do well to prepare themselves for their punishments, no exceptions.

When Brilliant Wargod saw Shi Feng’s smile, he suddenly felt uncertain about his decision. However, when he gave it more thought, it was possible that Shi Feng just tried to frighten him. Immediately, Brilliant Wargod logged out of God’s Domain, preparing to delete and rebuild his account.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng no longer cared to pay any attention to this brainless princeling. He then opened his bag, examining the clue to the God Slayer that he had just obtained.

There was no marked location on this map. There were also no written words to give an explanation. If any other players were to obtain this map, they would have no clue of what to do with it. After all, they would not know the location displayed on the map, nor would they know how to look for it. Moreover, the official site did not publish a world map for God’s Domain. That explained Brilliant Wargod’s ignorant generosity of wagering this map.

Fortunately, Shi Feng was extremely familiar with God’s Domain.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, the various major Guilds in God’s Domain made their own maps of God’s Domain, and Shadow was no exception. Ten years after God’s Domain started its operation, the world map that Shadow possessed was very thorough. Meanwhile, familiarizing oneself with the world map was one of the basic requirements of a Guild Leader, including Shi Feng.

However, the map currently in Shi Feng’s hands displayed very complicated terrain. Only after racking his brain for some time did Shi Feng manage to recall a place with a similar terrain as shown on this map.

It was the forbidden territory for humans, the Ruined Mountain Range.
