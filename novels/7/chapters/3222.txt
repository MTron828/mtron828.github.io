Chapter 297 – Kingdom’s Rookies

Ancient River Kingdom, Gazing Moon City:

After traveling continuously for over 14 hours, Shi Feng’s party of three successfully arrived at Gazing Moon City, an ancient city with over six centuries of history, before the sky darkened.

Sure enough, it’s the same as before.

When Shi Feng looked at the large city gate that easily allowed a large crowd to pass through, memories from the past gushed into his mind.

Gazing Moon City was one of the Ancient River Kingdom’s top ten cities. It had a stable player population of over 200 million, and it was situated in the kingdom’s northwestern region. It was also the first-ranked city in the kingdom’s northwestern region.

The entire city was built atop a towering mountain range with an altitude of more than 100,000 meters. It served as a link between the Ancient River Kingdom’s northwestern and central regions. Because of this, it ranked in the kingdom’s top five cities when it came to trade.

During Shi Feng’s previous life, Zero Wing had made Gazing Moon City one of its crucial bases of operations when the Guild began its development in the Ancient River Kingdom. The reason for this decision was that despite being one of the kingdom’s top ten cities, Gazing Moon City was not under the control of any Guild. Instead, the city was ruled by several alliances formed by independent players.

Among these alliances were the Twin Saints Alliance and the Purple Melody Alliance.

Hence, Gazing Moon City could be regarded as a free city that was incredibly suitable for trade. Any power could develop in Gazing Moon City should they wish to do so. However, because of the presence of these player alliances, no single power should think of occupying the city for themselves. Not even the kingdom’s six ruling hegemonic powers should consider doing so.

Currently, even though it was already getting dark, the number of players lining up to enter the city still exceeded a thousand. Moreover, more and more players were joining the queue as time passed. This situation left Shi Feng’s party with no choice but to wait in line.

Because of the long queue, many players waiting in line started engaging in small talk with each other. Among them, there were Tier 3, Tier 4, and even Tier 5 players discussing something with excitement on their faces.

“Did you hear? It seems three people have managed to offend the Twin Saints Alliance’s Spear Zealot Saint Three.”

“I did. I heard that those three people snatched Lord Saint Three’s Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal. The Tier 4 Swordsman, the leader of the group, even insulted Lord Saint Three. Everyone in the Twin Saints Alliance is talking about this matter.”

“What a bunch of lunatics. Not even the Tier 6 experts of hegemonic powers would dare to casually offend Saint Three. Yet, those three people have the gall to steal Saint Three’s Seven Luminaries Teleportation Crystal. Nowhere in the Ancient River Kingdom will be safe for them now.”

“I heard that the Tier 4 Swordsman is a titled expert who just migrated into the kingdom.”

“A titled expert? No wonder he’s so arrogant and ignorant. Unfortunately, while he might be considered a big shot in a city, he’s nothing in front of the Ten Great Paragons.”

“It’s a pity we don’t have any specific information on those three people. This is such a great opportunity to get into Saint Three’s good graces.”

“It is indeed a pity. I heard that the Twin Saints Alliance plans to handle this matter on its own, so it isn’t going to announce those three people’s information.”

It wasn’t very often a major news piece relating to the kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons would come up. Hence, many Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts jumped at the opportunity and began secretly inquiring about the three people who had offended the Two Saints Alliance’s Saint Three.

At this time, a cloaked beauty with a delicate face quietly observed the people around her, an anxious expression on her face.

“Is it really alright for us to come to Gazing Moon City, Brother Black Flame?” Midsummer quietly asked Shi Feng after overhearing the discussions taking place around her. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Wu Xiaoxiao, who stood next to Midsummer, also held deep doubts about Shi Feng’s decision to come to Gazing Moon City.

At this point, news of their actions had already spread across the entire Ancient River Kingdom. Meanwhile, upon learning of their deeds, Tier 4 experts weren’t the only ones tempted to take action. Even Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts eagerly thought of joining in on the action.

It should be known that these Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts were not joking.

They might be prohibited from openly taking action, but there were still ways for them to covertly take action.

In response to Midsummer’s concerns, Shi Feng chuckled and said, “If you two wish to develop peacefully in the Ancient River Kingdom in the future, the best way to achieve this would be to participate in the kingdom’s annual Rookie Competition that’s taking place in six days and join the ranks of the kingdom’s latest generation of Ten Great Paragons. If you can do that, the kingdom’s various powers and experts will no longer side with Saint Three. There will also be nothing Saint Three can do against you.”

“This…” Midsummer was rendered speechless by Shi Feng’s answer.

The Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition was held specifically for the Tier 4 players among the kingdom’s younger generation. Any Tier 4 player under Level 140 could apply for the competition. However, only if one managed to get into the preliminaries’ top 100 could one remain in the Ancient River Secret Land and have a chance at competing for a spot among the Ten Great Paragons.

Rumor had it that the Ancient River Secret Land not only housed an Ancient God Legacy, but it also housed a Divine Artifact. Hence, the Ancient River Kingdom’s annual Rookie Competition would always attract countless Tier 4 players under Level 140. Many titled experts would even lower their levels and tier to Level 140, Tier 4 just to participate in the competition.

The Ancient River Secret Land was also why the Ancient River Kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons refused to ascend to higher tiers even after many years had passed.

Because of the fierce competition, not even ordinary fourth-floor experts could get into the preliminaries’ top 100. In past competitions, even the weakest player in the top 100 would be a titled expert.

“You don’t have to worry about this. I have a way to get you two into the top 100. I can even give you a fighting chance against those paragons,” Shi Feng said, smiling.

Others might not know what secrets the Ancient River Secret Land housed, but he knew some of them.

The trials awaiting players in the Ancient River Secret Land weren’t a test of strength. Instead, it was more so a test of the Completion Rate of players’ Mana Bodies.

Moreover, the reason the Dragon Princess had teleported him to the Ancient River Kingdom should be because of the Ancient River Secret Land.

After he had arrived in the Ancient River Kingdom, the Seven Luminaries Codex still did not show any reactions. So, the only explanation he could come up with for this situation was that the Codex’s fragment was hidden in the Ancient River Secret Land, the most mysterious place in the Ancient River Kingdom.

…

After waiting in line for over an hour, Shi Feng’s party finally welcomed their turn.

After the Level 180, Tier 4 NPC soldier inspected Shi Feng’s party with an Identification Skill, he said, “I have verified your identities. It will be nine Silver Mana Coins for all three of you to enter the city. Once you enter the city, you will have to leave within three days, and you may not enter the city again for two days.”

“Here.” Midsummer handed nine Silver Mana Coins to the soldier.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng couldn’t help but grow a little envious when he saw how much money Gazing Moon City made from each player through entrance fees alone.

Many types of currency were used in the Greater God’s Domain. Out of all these currencies, the three most valuable currencies were Bronze Mana Coins, Silver Mana Coins, and Gold Mana Coins, with one Gold Mana Coin being worth 100 Silver Mana Coins or 10,000 Bronze Mana Coins.

Normally, the materials one could obtain from killing a Level 100 Great Lord would only be worth several Bronze Mana Coins.

Meanwhile, one Silver Mana Coin could be used to exchange for one Mana Stone. However, one Mana Stone could not be used to exchange for one Silver Mana Coin.

As for Gold Mana Coins, rumors mentioned that the value of one Gold Mana Coin was comparable to one unit of Seven Luminaries Crystal. Of course, nobody would be so foolish as to trade Seven Luminaries Crystals for Gold Mana Coins.

…

At the heart of Gazing Moon City, inside the Twin Saints Alliance’s Guild Hall…

Roughly half an hour after Shi Feng’s party entered Gazing Moon City, a Level 150, Tier 5 Ranger hurriedly entered a private room inside the Twin Saints Alliance’s Guild Hall.

The mana in the room was in a liquid state. Currently, there was a Tier 4 young man with messy hair sitting cross-legged in the middle of the room. If one observed this young man carefully, one would notice that the mana his body radiated was already close to achieving a solid state. This scene was astonishing as the density and strength of this mana shouldn’t belong to a Tier 4 player.

“What is it?” the savage-looking young man asked in a dissatisfied tone as he looked at the Tier 5 Ranger.

“Those three people have entered Gazing Moon City, Lord Saint Three,” the Level 150 Ranger hurriedly reported. “Should we take action now?”
