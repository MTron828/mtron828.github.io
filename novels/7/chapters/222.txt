Chapter 223 - Popular Starstreak

Inside a hotel in White River City.

Along with God’s Domain’s evolution, players understood the importance of rest. If they grinded monsters without rest, not only would their Stamina decrease, but their Concentration would also fall. Hence, after a day of battle, players would now rest at the hotel, having a drink and chatting with each other.

Players discovered that places like restaurants, hotels, and bars allowed them to recover Stamina and Concentration more quickly. After relaxing for two or three hours, they would feel refreshed and filled with energy.

“Did you hear? The Starstreak Trading Firm seems to be undergoing renovations. I heard that they are going to release new products for sale.”

“Who doesn’t know about this? After I made some inquiries, I found out that the Starstreak Trading Firm has also recruited tons of Potionmakers and Forgers. The trading firm is even hiring Lifestyle players right now. However, no players have dared apply for a position yet, thinking that it wouldn’t be a reliable job. I wonder what sort of new items they are going to sell?”

“Aside from the common usage items, what else could an NPC-owned store sell? They can’t possibly offer Bronze Equipment or rare potions, right?”

“That sounds about right.”

While the players in the hotel conversed, a male player suddenly pushed open the saloon doors, panting.

“Big news...! Starstreak Trading Firm has finished its renovations and has officially opened for business!” the panting Ranger exclaimed to his companions loudly.

“Why are you making a fuss? Aren’t they just reopening their business? We don’t lack Basic Potions or Common Equipment right now, so we don’t need to replenish our stock.” As the leader of the party, the Shield Warrior rolled his eyes as he watched this embarrassing companion of his. Others would make fun of them for the Ranger’s unsightly appearance.

Indeed, just like the Shield Warrior had feared, the other players in the hotel sent belittling glances, mocking smiles on their faces.

“Leader... listen... to me...” That Ranger excitedly said, “I saw Whetstones inside the shop! There are also Intermediate Recovery Potions and Intermediate Mana Regeneration Potions! Moreover, the Basic Potions are cheaper than anywhere else!”

“What did you say? There are Whetstones?” The Shield Warrior froze, stunned.

The entire hotel fell silent.

“Let’s go. Take us there immediately! We have to buy all of them, now!” The Shield Warrior abruptly stood up, casting Charge and arriving at the Ranger’s side. Grabbing the Ranger by the arm, he immediately rushed out of the hotel, running towards the Starstreak Trading Firm. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The other players inside the hotel were dumbfounded by this scene.

What?

“Crap, they’re going to buy out the Whetstones! We need to hurry as well!”

After entering White River City, players’ need for Whetstones had not decreased in the slightest. On the contrary, their need had grown. It was especially true when they faced high-level monsters, as the durability of their weapons reduced at a much faster rate.

As a result, the popularity of Whetstones had exploded. The available supply was far from meeting the demand.

By the time everyone had arrived at the Starstreak Trading Firm, a sea of people had already obliterated the shop’s doors.

Aside from Whetstones, the players present also fought to purchase the Intermediate Recovery and Mana Regeneration Potions like madmen.

Meanwhile, this information had quickly spread to the ears of the various Guilds.

“Guild Leader, I’ve already collected a large sum from all our members, and we’ve managed to purchase 30 stacks of Hard Stones. This amount should be enough to last us a long time,” Stabbing Heart spoke through the system communicator.

“Good. The moment the money-making team sends over the latest batch of Gold Coins, immediately return all the money we borrowed from our members,” Cruel Sword excitedly said.

Aside from the Assassin’s Alliance, other Guilds also frantically gathered funds.

“Snow, just what is happening at that Starstreak Trading Firm? Why would they suddenly start selling these items?” Zhao Yueru wrinkled her crescent brows when she looked at the latest news that she had just received. She then said helplessly, “We’ve already spent a lot of money to purchase our previous stock of Hard Stones. We don’t have any money to purchase any more right now.”

“I’ve heard that the Starstreak Trading Firm is also selling limited edition Advanced Whetstones right now. Rumor has it the Advanced Whetstone’s effects are at least double that of normal Whetstones. In addition, it also provides a 3% Damage Buff! Although it is slightly more expensive, costing 7 Silver Coins per piece, we would have a much easier time raiding the Dungeon Bosses with them!”

Gentle Snow shook her head, a helpless expression appearing on her beautiful face as she said, “Under normal circumstances, NPCs would never sell these items. However, there is something strange going on. A player has created a connection with the Starstreak Trading Firm. I’m just wondering who could possibly achieve such a feat. Also, who would possess enough funding to supply so many Whetstones and Intermediate Potions. This is simply unbelievable. Send someone to investigate this matter immediately.”

Recently, she had managed to raise 20 Gold Coins and had purchased Hard Stones with that money. Yet, the Starstreak Trading Firm now sold Whetstones. She had not received any information before this incident, causing her to suffer disaster.

Currently, the issue of weapon durability had caused a roadblock in their Dungeon raiding progress. Everything would be too late by the time their Guild’s forgers managed to turn those Hard Stones into Whetstones. Other Guilds would have long since surpassed them.

They needed to obtain the Whetstones right this instant, especially the Advanced Whetstones.

Meanwhile, inside an Intermediate Forging room in the Forging Association, Shi Feng currently crafted Advanced Whetstones. He did so to increase his Forging Proficiency and earn money.

The present market was not the same as before. With the Starstreak Trading Firm around, he could now sell the Advanced Whetstones he made in eight cities. Although the Advanced Whetstones were somewhat expensive, players from the eight cities would still buy them. Even if Shi Feng forged Advanced Whetstones 24 hours a day, he still wouldn’t meet the demand of the eight cities.

Currently, Gold Coins poured into the Starstreak Trading Firm’s accounts with every passing moment. Shi Feng did not even dare open the money system notification. Only one short hour had passed since Starstreak Trading Firm reopened, yet, already, it had earned over 300 Gold Coins. However, this was only the beginning. Things would become more exciting later on.

Aside from making money, Shi Feng’s goal in making Advanced Whetstones was to upgrade himself to an Advanced Forging Apprentice.

If he became an Advanced Forging Apprentice, he could learn the Advanced Book of Magic he had obtained from Stonehammer Town.

Previously, he only had White River City as the sole market for his wares. Now, however, he had eight markets. He also did not need to foot any of the high processing fees, so he could not waste this chance. Shi Feng intended to gain an impressive reputation and prestige among the eight cities. However, the Advanced Whetstones alone were not enough to achieve this result. Moreover, Advanced Whetstones could not increase his reputation, as these things did not carry his personal mark. Only the Starstreak Trading Firm would gain reputation from these Advanced Whetstones.

Most importantly, after everyone had a taste of the benefits of the Advanced Whetstones, they would fervently investigate how they could obtain the recipe. After all, the recipe for the Advanced Whetstone was not unique; players could obtain them from multiple Team Dungeons.

By the time Shi Feng opened his own shop, he would no longer possess the advantage he had right now.

Thus, he needed to become an Advanced Forging Apprentice and learn the Advanced Book of Magic, creating the one and only Mana Armor Kit. Once he thoroughly spread the Black Flame Forger’s reputation with the Mana Armor Kits that only he could create, tons of players would search him out.
