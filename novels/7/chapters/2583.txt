Chapter 2584 – Final Decision, Road to Tier 4

Shi Feng could not help but hesitate when he saw the system notification.

Both the Legacy Guidance and the Disaster Blade strengthening were incredibly rare opportunities.

Not only would the Legacy Guidance help players unlock their Mana Bodies’ full potential, but it would also help them reach beyond the 100% threshold. The knowledge a Titled Sword Saint like Elvoze had was especially valuable. With the Tier 6 Gods in seclusion, a Titled Sword Saint stood at the very apex of God’s Domain’s powerhouses.

Of course, the chance to strengthen the awarded weapon was just as precious.

This opportunity involved imbuing one’s Mana in a weapon, granting the weapon a portion of their abilities. This wouldn’t change any of the weapon’s Attributes, but the weapon’s power and Skill effects would receive a considerable boost. This could even grant the weapon hidden effects.

If a Titled Sword Saint imbued an Epic Weapon like the Disaster Blade with his Mana, the weapon would be able to rival Fragmented Legendary Weapons.

Even the various superpowers’ experts would consider such a weapon godly. They’d essentially be able to use it for their entire careers in God’s Domain. The weapon’s level limitation wouldn’t be a concern, either. It was possible to raise a Level 100-plus Epic Weapon or Equipment piece’s maximum level through certain means, although it would be more costly with a Level 100-plus Epic Weapon.

However, if one could continue to use an Epic Weapon that rivaled Fragmented Legendary rank, the cost would be worthwhile.

While Shi Feng hesitated, he heard the sound of another system notification.

System: You have one minute remaining. If you fail to make a decision before the time limit has ended, both options will be considered abandoned.

With so little time remaining, Shi Feng gritted his teeth and approached Elvoze.

“Esteemed Sword Saint, I hope to obtain your Legacy Guidance,” Shi Feng earnestly declared. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Are you certain? You have already unlocked your Mana Body, and based on how you accomplished that feat, you must have received Legacy Guidance from another powerhouse. I doubt my guidance will be of any significant help to you. In contrast, strengthening the Disaster Blade will certainly increase your strength,” Elvoze calmly informed Shi Feng.

“I am certain, my lord,” Shi Feng replied, nodding.

While he had unlocked his Mana Body’s full potential, 100% wasn’t enough for his future goals. He’d only reach greater heights by surpassing that threshold. Every powerhouse trod a different path, and obtaining more Legacy Guidance would definitely help him break past the 100% threshold.

Most importantly, opportunities to receive Legacy Guidance were incredibly rare. If he missed this chance, he might never find another.

Even after learning from the Heavenly Blue Saint’s Legacy Guidance, he had only unlocked his Mana Body’s full potential after combining what he had learned with a God’s Heart’s effects. Naturally, crossing the 100% threshold was far more difficult than reaching it. If he had to do so on his own, it would take ages before he made a breakthrough. He might never actually succeed. He had an Epic ranked Mana Body, and going beyond 100% at that rank would be much harder than it would be with lower ranks.

If he did not have enough help, his chances of making a breakthrough were minuscule at best, even with the help of a God’s Heart.

Thus, he had no choice.

Strengthening the Disaster Blade would give him immediate access to a pseudo-Fragmented Legendary Weapon and boost his combat power, but the Disaster Blade was a fragment of Solomon’s Sword. Once he found five sword fragments, he would have to combine them to reproduce Solomon’s Sword, which would render the strengthening useless.

Moreover, Shi Feng now had the Fragmented Legendary ranked Abyssal Blade. He no longer lagged behind others when it came to weapon standards.

More importantly, Tier 3 wasn’t the end for true experts, only a transition. Reaching Tier 4 was a far better option than obtaining another Fragmented Legendary item. As players reached higher levels, the strength differences between tiers would only grow. Sooner or later, the gap would grow so large that not even one or two Fragmented Legendary items would make a difference.

Shi Feng had also reached Level 117, only three levels away from the Level 120 threshold.

Level 120!

Naturally, the Tier 4 Promotion Quest would be much harder than the Tier 3 quest. The two weren’t even on the same level.

The Tier 3 Promotion Quest would be like a Normal Mode Party Dungeon, while the Tier 4 quest would be as challenging as a 100-man, Hell Mode Team Dungeon. There was a qualitative difference between the two.

Most mainstream experts were capable of reaching Tier 3. Even if they couldn’t do it at Level 100, they could complete the quest after reaching Level 120 or level 130. Tier 4, however, was a different story. If one truly couldn’t complete their Tier 4 Promotion Quest, they’d never do so, even after reaching Level 200.

Because of this, Tier 4 experts had been incredibly rare in the past, even among the various superpowers. Anyone that successfully reached Tier 4 instantly became a Guild upper echelon.

Moreover, completing the Tier 4 Promotion Quest took a very long time. According to the statistics players had collected in the past, completing a Tier 4 Promotion Quest could take anywhere between one and two months.

However, Shi Feng also had to face the Silver Divine Dragon, Auerbeck’s trial, so he was in a rush. If he couldn’t reach Tier 4 before he had to undertake the Divine Dragon’s trial, his chances of clearing the trial would be all but zero. Unfortunately, he couldn’t afford to lose Auerbeck due to the many benefits the Divine Dragon’s companion enjoyed. It had also helped him secure a foothold on the western continent.

In his current state, Shi Feng estimated that his chances of completing the Tier 4 Promotion quest were only around 10% or 20%. He had no choice but to grab ahold of whatever opportunities that would help him increase his chances as soon as possible.

“It seems you have already decided on your path,” Elvoze said, and he seemed to look at the Swordsman before him in a different way. He no longer viewed Shi Feng as a weaker being, but as an equal. He then retrieved a crystal ball and handed it to Shi Feng, saying, “This is the experience I have gained over the years. I hope it will be of some help.”

After handing Shi Feng the crystal ball, Elvoze transformed into a streak of light and vanished from Poison City. The two Tier 4 NPCs who had accompanied him also disappeared, and the dull-gray longsword Crodia had wielded returned to the fountain.

Removing the Disaster Blade from the fountain, Shi Feng stored it in his bag. He had no intention of using the weapon at all.

Unlike ordinary weapons, the Disaster Blade would convert its user’s Mana into dense death energy, which would affect everyone that came into contact with it, aside from the user. Just having the weapon passively equipped would influence the carrier’s surroundings. The weapon’s properties made it utterly unsuitable for ordinary players. Only Dark Players that preferred to work solo could wield the blade properly. This was another reason that Shi Feng had declined the chance to strengthen the Disaster Blade.

“Guild Leader, we’ve finished collecting the Boss’s loot,” Aqua Rose excitedly reported once Shi Feng had finished his conversation with Elvoze. “We’ve gained quite a harvest this time. Aside from the Fragmented Legendary ranked mage robes, Undead’s Will, we’ve acquired two Epic Weapons: a staff and a dagger. The complete Nether Set, a Tier 3 Set Equipment for magical classes, also dropped, as well as a bunch of materials and recipes. According to your instructions, we held an internal auction for the Epic Weapons. Blue Frost won the staff, while Flying Shadow won the dagger. What should we do with the Undead’s Will and Tier 3 Set Equipment?”

“Give the Undead’s Will to Blue Frost. He still has to command the situation in the Dark Den. It’ll make things easier for him when he has to stand up against the various superpowers,” Shi Feng said after giving the matter some thought.

Before Shi Feng and Aqua Rose could continue their conversation, though, Dark Rhapsody’s Blue Rainbow approached Shi Feng. Worried, she informed him, “Guild Leader Black Flame, I’ve just received a report stating that Demon’s Heart’s alliance team has reached the first floor’s third Boss and begun the raid. By the looks of it, they have a very high chance of taking it down...”

The Ancient God’s Tower’s first floor had four Bosses in total. If Demon’s Heart’s alliance managed to defeat the third Boss, they were almost guaranteed to defeat the Final Boss, as well.

“Their raiding speed is astonishing.” Shi Feng was similarly surprised to hear this. Each of the Ancient God’s Tower’s floors was as large as a small resource map. Finding the Bosses wasn’t easy. However, Shi Feng chuckled and assured her, “Fortunately, we’ve completed our task here. It’s time we return.”
