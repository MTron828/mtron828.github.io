Chapter 349 - Skyrocketing Experience

While Shi Feng slowly approached the battlefield, the other players stared intently at the Mechanical Slayer’s HP.

As the battle grew more intense, the Mechanical Slayer’s HP fell at an increasing rate.

If they were a step ahead of others, they would have a higher chance of obtaining some of the Slayer’s loot for themselves. Naturally, they all watched the Mutant’s HP intently, prepared to dash forward when it dropped to zero.

At the same time, various Guild Leaders began issuing commands to surround the battlefield.

Although Shi Feng had killed many of their members with the aid of the Mechanical Slayer, many were still alive. At this time, these Guilds no longer paid attention to Shi Feng. Including Lone Tyrant, who hated Shi Feng down to the bone, they all focused on the Mechanical Slayer.

“Guild Leader Tyrant, we have people stationed as close to the Mechanical Slayer as possible. Our men will charge forward as soon as the Slayer dies,” an Assassin standing beside Lone Tyrant reported.

“Good. If someone steals the loot, kill them,” Lone Tyrant ordered.

According to his estimation, the loot of such a powerful monster like the Mechanical Slayer, at the very least, would be Dark-Gold items. It might even drop Epic items!

As long as they could obtain these items, they could make up for some of the losses they had previously suffered.

“Right, have there been any movements from Zero Wing and Ouroboros?” Lone Tyrant asked.

“None at the moment. I don’t know what happened with Zero Wing, but none of their members have arrived. It seems they’re not interested in this situation. As for Ouroboros, they are still focused on raiding the Three Great Dungeons. They only sent a small contingent. On the other hand, Emperor’s Light and Assassin’s Alliance have sent quite a few members,” the Assassin reported. He then added, “If we had not lost so many members because of Black Flame, we could have contended with these Guilds evenly.”

“Hahaha! Gentle Snow, in your eagerness to conquer the Three Great Dungeons, you have missed out on the chance to conquer the Three Great Dungeons! Pass down my command. Have everyone focus on grabbing the most valuable items. Don’t let any Dark-Gold items or Epic items fall into other Guilds’ hands!” Lone Tyrant’s excitement grew as he thought about the bountiful loot of the Mechanical Slayer.

Before, Dark Star had lost many of their members and suffered massive losses due to Black Flame. It would take a long time for the Guild to recover. Lone Tyrant swore that he would personally avenge his Guild sooner or later.

However, if they could obtain some Dark-Gold and possibly Epic items, it would massively assist the Guild’s recovery. It was especially true for Dungeon-raiding.

If they could use Dark-Gold and Epic ranked weapons and equipment to fight the Bosses in the Three Great Dungeons, they would have a much easier time conquering these Dungeons.

By the time they obtained the First Clear of the Three Great Dungeons, Dark Star would take its place in the public eye once more, restoring its past glory.

Time passed gradually. While everyone focused on the Mechanical Slayer’s HP, the number of players in White River City who had gathered continuously increased.

After all, it was the first time a monster attack had occurred in Star-Moon Kingdom.

Shortly after the White River City System Announcement appeared, a report appeared on the God’s Domain official forums.

Even players from other cities rushed over to experience this rare event. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, the teleportation fee between cities was very expensive. So, there weren’t a lot of players from other cities. Meanwhile, the players from other cities were those who were well off in God’s Domain. A majority of these players were the elite members of Guilds.

At one point, over 500,000 players had gathered around the battlefield between Weissman and the Mechanical Slayer. That was practically a third of the total population of White River City.

“I’m relieved. To see such a powerful monster, we have not wasted the trip. Only a few of us teleported here, and we haven’t occupied any strategic locations. In a moment, if any of you manage to snatch some loot, escape immediately, understood? Don’t stay behind to throw away your lives,” a handsome man in black robes told the people standing around him.

If Shi Feng could see this man’s name, he would be shocked.

This man was a famous expert in the virtual gaming world. His fame even surpassed Gentle Snow’s. The man was also an individual ranked within the top 1,000 on the Global Experts List. This man was Red Feather, and he was one of the elders of the first-rate Guild, Star Alliance.

“Boss Red Feather, rest assured. You should know our strengths the best. Not in another hundred years could these noobs of White River City compete with us,” a Level 20 Assassin with tanned skin said disdainfully as he observed the various Guilds’ members of White River City.

“Big Brother Red, you’re being overly cautious. We are the trump card of Star Alliance. Since we’ve arrived, how could we not walk away with all of the loot?” Flourishing Willow, a female Ranger with an enchanting body, chuckled.

“You guys...” Red Feather helplessly shook his head his companions’ confident words. “There are still plenty of experts in White River City. Although Gentle Snow is not participating, don’t forget that there are still the Branch Leader of World Dominators, Blood Halberd, the Guild Leader of the Assassin’s Alliance, Cruel Sword, and the Branch Leader of Emperor’s Light, Thirteenth Swallow. There is also the expert that has recently appeared, Black Flame. In addition, experts from other cities have also come to take part in this event. No matter what, we have to act prudently.”

Unfortunately, Red Feather’s reminder fell on deaf ears. None of his companions took his words to heart.

After all, every one of them was above Level 20, and a majority of the equipment they wore was Secret-Silver rank. One of them even wore nothing but Secret-Silver Equipment. In addition, they were all veteran gamers who had fought in the virtual gaming industry for many years now. They were all top-tier experts.

Their levels, techniques, and equipment were all first-rate. So, how could they possibly lose to any other Guild?

“Big Brother Red, that Mechanical Slayer’s HP is about to bottom out. Should we rush over there?” Flourishing Willow asked.

“In a moment. The more powerful a monster is, the more powerful its counterattack will be before it dies. You have all personally witnessed how powerful the Mechanical Slayer is for yourselves. Anywhere within a 200-yards is a danger zone. If we don’t have any invulnerability skills, the splash damage will kill us before we get close,” Red Feather stopped his companions. “However, we can approach the 200-yard range.”

Just as Red Feather finished speaking...

Suddenly, a black figure charged towards the Mechanical Slayer so fast that it left observers tongue-tied.

“Hahaha! What a fool! The Mechanical Slayer still has 2% of its HP left, yet he dares to rush ahead!”

“Based on his speed, that person should be an expert. Unfortunately, his greed has overpowered his judgment. If he waited until the Mechanical Slayer died, with his speed, he could have snatch one or two items.”

Many onlookers ridiculed the figure that had boldly charged into the fray. Nobody believed that the figure would survive to reach the Slayer.

However, there was also a small number of players who rushed after him.

Meanwhile, the black figure leading the charge was none other than Shi Feng.

At this moment, the Mechanical Slayer was already on the verge of death. Weissman only needed two or three more skills to finish it off. Naturally, Shi Feng would not wait any longer.

However, when Shi Feng was 100 yards from the battlefield, the Mechanical Slayer erupted.

The Mechanical Slayer’s body suddenly turned crimson, shrinking by half. The serrated greatsword also transformed into a blood-red scythe. A pitch-black aura of death surrounded the blade. Tightly gripping the scythe with both hands, the Slayer swung it at its surroundings.

Suddenly, black streaks of light shot out in all directions.

This is...! Why does it have the Tier 4 skill, Death’s Sigh?! Shi Feng panicked at the sight of this skill. Hurriedly, he activated Fantasy World.

The instant the black lights collided with the barrier of light formed by the Fantasy World, although Shi Feng had not lost any HP, he felt as if he had been struck by a sledgehammer. Shi Feng had even wondered if Fantasy World could hold up against this Tier 4 skill.

The black lights illuminated the surroundings for six full seconds, covering a range 200 yards in all directions. The area looked like it had been enclosed by a black dome. Everything within this dome was pitch-black, and nobody outside the dome could see anything within it.

After Death’s Sigh ended, everything in the space was dead. Aside from Shi Feng who was safe inside his light barrier, every player who charged forward had died.

Meanwhile, the Ice Guard Weissman had summoned also shattered. At this moment, Weissman had lost a significant amount of his HP. He even spat a mouthful of fresh blood. Evidently, the Slayer’s attack had severely injured him.

However, this could not be helped. Nobody would have thought the Mechanical Slayer would use such a frightening skill as its dying counterattack. When caught unaware, even a Tier 4 Great Wizard would receive heavy damage from such an attack.

However, after using Death’s Sigh, the Mechanical Slayer was like an oil lamp exhausted of fuel. It only had a final thread of HP remaining.

Weissman then used Ice Descent, a Tier 3 spell. Suddenly, ice and snow fell from the sky, landing on the Mechanical Slayer. Wave after wave of Icy Air enveloped on the Slayer, devouring the last of its HP.

“Your head is mine.”

At this moment, seeing as the Mechanical Slayer was about to die, Shi Feng had grown anxious. Immediately, he activated Windwalk and dashed at the Mutant. The moment he was in range, he used Silent Steps to appear behind the Mechanical Slayer. As Weissman’s spell was not yet over, Shi Feng had to endure Weissman’s Ice Descends as well. Shi Feng then retrieved an Intermediate Frost Grenade from his bag. After accurately gauging the Slayer’s HP, Shi Feng threw the Intermediate Frost Grenade and dealt -500 damage to the Mutant. The Frost Grenade destroyed the Mechanical Slayer’s remaining 300 HP before the next wave of Icy Air could.

Shi Feng had pushed himself to his very limit to grasp the Mechanical Slayer’s HP, and he very nearly lost the last hit to Weissman.

After the Mechanical Slayer died, over a hundred items burst forth from the Mutant.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng also received a series of system notifications.

Before Shi Feng could check the notifications, his experience bar started to soar.

In just a moment, Shi Feng’s Level 24 experience bar fill before breaking through to Level 25.

Even after reaching Level 25, Shi Feng’s experience bar did not stop.

Level 26...

Level 27...

Level 28...

Level 29...

...

Golden light continuously flashed over Shi Feng’s body, only gradually fading after Shi Feng reached Level 34. In the end, Shi Feng rose to 74% of Level 34. Shi Feng had leveled up ten times consecutively. The EXP he had obtained had completely surpassed his imagination.

Even in his previous life, never once had he managed to level up ten times in a row. It was clear how bountiful the EXP provided by the Mechanical Slayer was. If he had obtained 100% of it, he would have leveled up further.
