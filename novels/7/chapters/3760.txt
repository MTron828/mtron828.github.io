Chapter 3761 - 835 - Walking Disaster

Boom!

Darkness suddenly enveloped the simulated battlefield, and all magic elements converged on Shi Feng like metal particles attracted to a magnet.

Is it a Domain Spell?

Xiao Yilong was astonished by this development. All he could see right now was darkness.

However, before Xiao Yilong could use a Control Removal Skill, he felt like a mountain had fallen on his shoulders. His movements and mana grew sluggish. As a result, his Advanced Gold Fusion Technique crumbled, and his HP plummeted.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

98%… 95%… 90%…

In only a second, Xiao Yilong had already lost 15% of his HP…

…

“What is this move?”

In the first-floor lobby, Twilight Leaf was similarly stunned as she watched Xiao Yilong’s HP decrease.

Twilight Leaf knew Xiao Yilong’s strength well. Under the same Basic Attributes, even Domain Spells should only be able to suppress him slightly. Not to mention, Xiao Yilong had several Tier 6 Domain Spells in his repertoire. Even if he couldn’t shrug off Shi Feng’s Domain Spell, he should be able to put up some resistance.

Yet, Xiao Yilong couldn’t even move right now, let alone resist. All he could do was watch as his HP disappeared. It was simply unbelievable.

…

When Xiao Yilong saw that his HP kept decreasing and his Mana kept dissipating, he knew he couldn’t hold back any longer.

Immediately, a clearly visible Law Projection expanded from Xiao Yilong and quickly covered a 1,000-yard radius. Upon casting his Advanced Law Projection, Xiao Yilong recovered much of his maneuverability. His Divine Body also regathered his dissipated mana.

Xiao Yilong sighed in relief at this development. Although he was still suppressed, at least he could fight now.

An Advanced Law Projection? Shi Feng was unfazed by the quality of Xiao Yilong’s Law Projection. In response, he activated the Shadow Incinerator’s World’s Descent.

Currently, his Miniature Abyssal World could only be considered an unfinished product. Its Completion Rate didn’t even reach 60%. Fortunately, World’s Descent could artificially enhance his control over his Law Projection. Although it wasn’t enough to let him recreate the Primordial Abyssal God’s Law Projection, it should let him achieve a passable standard.

Boom!

Under World’s Descent, the operations of the World Laws making up Shi Feng’s incomplete Miniature Abyssal World started to flow much more smoothly. This, in turn, allowed the Miniature Abyssal World to go from merely suppressing Xiao Yilong’s Advanced Law Projection to devouring it completely.

Additionally, like a black hole, the Miniature Abyssal World consumed Xiao Yilong’s mana. Although Xiao Yilong desperately activated Tier 6 Domain Spells one after another to resist the Miniature Abyssal World, he still couldn’t stop it from restraining his movements and reducing his HP.

50%… 30%… 10%…

When the duel reached the five-second mark, Xiao Yilong’s HP zeroed out. Since the duel started, all Shi Feng did was raise his hand…

…

A strange silence enveloped the first-floor lobby. Everyone wore a look of disbelief as they looked at Xiao Yilong’s corpse on the screen.

“Big Sis Frost! What did Black Flame just do?!” After snapping out of her daze, Twilight Leaf immediately turned to Red Frost for answers. “Not even Tier 6 Domain-type Super Spells can be that 

powerful! It can practically kill any Tier 6 player once activated!”

Twilight Leaf was confused and horrified by what Shi Feng had just done.

In the Greater God’s Domain, even Level 240-plus Ancient Gods could, at best, suppress Tier 6 players heavily when using Tier 6 Domain Spells. They couldn’t kill Tier 6 players with Domain Spells alone.

Not to mention, Shi Feng and Xiao Yilong fought under the same Tier and Basic Attributes. Yet, Shi Feng still managed to kill Xiao Yilong simply by activating what seemed like a Domain Spell. With such capabilities, calling Shi Feng a walking disaster wouldn’t even be an exaggeration.

“This…” Red Frost had no idea how she should answer Twilight Leaf’s question. She was similarly confused by how Shi Feng could kill a Tier 6 player with only a Domain Spell.

…

Meanwhile, on the simulation battlefield…

Sure enough, I still can’t cast the Miniature Abyssal World properly. Shi Feng sighed in disappointment. Then, after his pale complexion recovered slightly, he looked at Xiao Yilong’s corpse and thought, Although I pushed my mental strength to its limits, the results I achieved are still satisfactory. I hadn’t thought I could crush an Advanced Law Projection, but I guess it is to be expected from the Law Projection created by the Primordial Abyssal God.

Shi Feng was honestly surprised he could kill Xiao Yilong with just the Miniature Abyssal World. After all, his Miniature Abyssal World’s Completion Rate didn’t even reach 60%. Although he had strengthened it with World’s Descent, his original goal in using the Skill was only to strengthen the suppressive effect on Xiao Yilong.

However, the Miniature Abyssal World exceeded his expectations. Despite being an unfinished product, it could still crush Xiao Yilong, an expert who could cast an Advanced Law Projection. It was simply terrifying.

Of course, the Miniature Abyssal World wasn’t without its flaws. It placed a huge burden on the user’s mind. Shi Feng had to stretch his mental strength thin just to use it for several seconds. It definitely wasn’t a move suited for long battles.

Subsequently, Shi Feng withdrew from the simulation battlefield and climbed out of his simulation cabin.

At the same time, Xiao Yilong climbed out of his cabin, looking pale. When he saw Shi Feng again, fear, confusion, and frustration flashed in his eyes.

“I lost. I am not your match. Per our agreement, I will stop trying to persuade Red Frost.” After staring at Shi Feng for a few seconds, Xiao Yilong admitted his defeat. “However, that doesn’t change my opinion that you lack the ability to help Red Frost! Ember Dragon has already thrown full support behind one of Holy Dragon Spear’s chosen ones! If that chosen one gains control of the adventurer team, it will be the end for Red Frost!”

Xiao Yilong’s words made Red Frost, who had hurried to the combat simulation room, realize that she might have underestimated the severity of the situation.

“I understand your concerns, Mr. Xiao,” Shi Feng said, chuckling at Xiao Yilong’s frustration. “But like I said before, if Commander Frost joins Zero Wing, even the Uncrowned War God will no longer be a problem. Since the Uncrowned War God wishes to prop up his own representative in Holy Dragon Spear, Zero Wing can do the same by supporting Commander Frost!”
