Chapter 451 - Massacre

At Cold Laughter’s command, the other Red Names exploded into action.

Elementalists and Cursemancers started chanting; Rangers nocked their arrows; and Shield Warriors, Guardian Knights, and the other melee classes prepared to intercept any escape attempts.

“Black Flame, both our parties will open a path to our left. There’s a forest in that direction, so it will be easy to lose them once we’re inside,” Virtuous Cloud hurriedly said as she raised her shield in preparation to take damage.

Seeing that Black Flame’s party members had such high levels, it was very unlikely that they would be weak.

Although they were still outnumbered, 12-on-50 was still a lot better than 6-on-50. Not to mention, Black Flame’s party was clearly stronger than her party. There was still a chance for them to break through the encirclement.

However, before Virtuous Cloud had finished speaking, Fire Dance had already taken action.

Using Shadow Steps, Fire Dance immediately appeared behind Cold Laughter. In an instant, her blood-red short sword slashed across the back of Cold Laughter’s head. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Cold Laughter had no hope against Fire Dance’s speed. Before he knew it, a damage of -1,106 points appeared above his head, his HP instantly falling by one-third.

When Cold Laughter saw the other Truefire Blade coming in for another attack, he was instantly afraid.

“Scram!” Cold Laughter urgently used Whirlwind Slash, slashing his greatsword horizontally towards Fire Dance.

Berserkers were known for their Strength. In addition, Whirlwind Slash greatly increased the might of an attack by utilizing momentum. Even if Fire Dance had a higher Strength, she couldn’t defend against his attack.

Dang!

However, as if his greatsword had struck an immovable wall, the weapon stopped right beside Fire Dance, unable to advance. For a moment, Cold Laughter even felt his hands go numb.

“How...?” When Cold Laughter saw the blood-red short sword in Fire Dance’s hand block his greatsword effortlessly, he could no longer hide his fear.

Was this an Assassin?

This question echoed through Cold Laughter’s mind.

During Cold Laughter’s brief moment of shock, Fire Dance twisted the Truefire Blade in her hand, disengaging from Cold Laughter’s greatsword and forcing the Berserker to retreat by a few steps. Fire Dance then swung her other arm, sliding the other Truefire Blade smoothly into Cold Laughter’s chest.

Although Berserkers focused on Strength, with the difference in equipment, Fire Dance’s strength left Cold Laughter’s in the dust, despite her Agility-focused class.

This was the cruel reality of God’s Domain. Equipment spoke volumes.

Class advantage was meaningless in the face of powerful equipment.

Cold Laughter hurriedly tried to defend against Fire Dance’s sword. However, the latter gave him no opportunity to do so.

Shadow Strike!

Suddenly, Fire Dance disappeared, her entire person passing through Cold Laughter and appearing behind the Berserker.

Although Cold Laughter tried to turn towards the Assassin, the damage of -3,426 points that appeared above his head had emptied his remaining HP. Immediately, Cold Laughter’s vision began to gray.

The battle had ended before it had even started.

From beginning to end, Cold Laughter had not known what was happening.

Wasn’t she just an Assassin who was two levels higher than him? Yet, he couldn’t even put up a fight.

Is the gap between players really that intense? Cold Laughter didn’t understand. Fire Dance’s appearance had shattered his past preconceptions.

However, even if doubt filled the Berserker’s mind, his body still fell to the ground.

Only an instant had passed from the moment Fire Dance had taken action.

The surrounding Red Names had only noticed Fire Dance’s disappearance before she suddenly reappeared in front of Cold Laughter. In the next moment, Cold Laughter’s body hit the ground. Their boss and the only expert in their team had died, just like that...

The consequences of death for a Red Name spoke for themselves.

Not only had Cold Laughter dropped a majority of his equipment, but he would also lose at least three Levels.

Seeing this, the surrounding Red Names were scared stiff.

“So fast!” Admiration filled Virtuous Cloud’s gaze as she watched Fire Dance.

No matter how one viewed Cold Laughter, he was not an ordinary player. The fact that he was Level 24 and the leader of these elite players proved it. His dark red name also spoke of his countless player kills. He could not be underestimated, and she wasn’t even confident of defeating the Berserker. Yet, Fire Dance had killed the Red Name in the blink of an eye.

Meanwhile, after killing Cold Laughter, Fire Dance had not stopped. Spinning around, she dashed towards the enemy magical classes.

Currently, the stunned crowd was like a herd of frightened sheep. Fire Dance reached the magical classes easily, and killing each with a single hit, she instantly eliminated another three players.

Unwilling to fall behind, Blackie also began to wave his staff and cast Hell Flame. Green pillars of fire suddenly rose among the crowd, and any players the flames touched received multiple damages of over -2,000 points. Before these players could escape Hell Flame’s range, they died. In an instant, another dozen or so players had lost their lives.

Aqua Rose joined the fray, casting Flame Barrage and downing another six players.

Flying Shadow had long since charged into the crowd as well, massacring the Red Names. Even though many tried to resist, Flying Shadow dealt with all of them easily. The male Assassin was like a ghost, his movements erratic. None of the Red Names could even catch sight of the man, let alone damage him. On the contrary, due to friendly fire, they even killed some of their own...

By the time the Red Names realized the situation, they had lost over half of their numbers.

Run!

With less than half of their original army remaining, these Red Names no longer had the confidence to face Fire Dance and the others.

“Don’t you think that it is a little too late to escape now?” Shi Feng could not help but sigh as he watched the scattering Red Names.

Even if Shi Feng’s party and these Red Names were on the same level regarding Attributes, which they certainly were not, Fire Dance and the others would still have annihilated them easily.

In a moment’s time, Fire Dance’s group of five had devastated the 50 Red Names. Equipment and corpses littered the ground.

With a rough estimate, the Red Names dropped close to 300 pieces of equipment. Furthermore, the lowest quality was Bronze ranked. If sold, they could make a fortune from the loot.

Virtuous Cloud, who stood beside Shi Feng all this time, was utterly shocked.

Only now did she realize why Black Flame’s party members had been so calm.

So they weren’t putting on an act at all. Virtuous Cloud glanced at Shi Feng, a hint of shame surfacing on her face.

Originally, she thought that Shi Feng’s group was simply a bunch of rich tycoons who were ignorant about worldly affairs. Now, however, it would seem that she had been greatly mistaken.

With such frightening strength, it was no wonder they paid no attention to these Red Names.

“Thank you for saving our lives,” Virtuous Cloud said as she took out a Warfire set piece from her bag, intending to give it to Shi Feng. “I don’t have anything else on me that I can offer, so please accept these Warfire Bracers.”

When Virtuous Cloud’s party members saw her use a Warfire set piece as payment for their rescue, although their hearts ached at the sight, none of them tried to hinder their party leader’s actions.

It had not been easy to reach their current Levels. If they died, not only would they lose a level, but every one of them would also have to lose a piece of equipment. Losing the Warfire Bracers was more affordable.

Moreover, Virtuous Cloud’s decision could also allow them to forge a connection with an expert. This was a welcomed opportunity for all of them.

“Warfire Bracers?” Shi Feng had plenty of Warfire set pieces in his bag, enough to form three sets and more. He only lacked the Warfire Bracers. “Thanks, but you don’t have to. Why not sell it to me instead? As we had previously agreed, I’ll buy it for 10 Gold Coins.”

Saying so, Shi Feng traded 10 Gold Coins to Virtuous Cloud. He then added the Warfire Bracers to his bag.

“Finally, a complete Warfire Set Equipment.” When Shi Feng looked at the completed Warfire Set Equipment in his bag, an indescribable sense of joy filling his heart.
