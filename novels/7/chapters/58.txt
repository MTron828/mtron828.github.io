Chapter 59 - Violet Cloud

Although Shi Feng was having a relaxing time selling equipment, Hammer Trading was not.

To compete with Shi Feng, Hammer Trading was constantly forging new Savage Chestplates. The Silver Coins in his hands were no different than Copper as they disappeared in a flash. Hammer Trading also had to spend Credits to purchase more Silver Coins, giving him an immense heartache. However, when he thought of Shi Feng spending much more than him, his heart soothed by a lot. He wanted Shi Feng to go bankrupt.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng left the lively Auction House.

He arrived at the Bank, storing all the Card Sets and Hard Stones he had collected into his warehouse. Shi Feng was extremely excited as he looked at over a thousand slots of his warehouse filled.

This was the benefit of being reincarnated. In his previous life, he in a miserable state thanks to these items. Now, however, they became one of his biggest sources of income.

In the eyes of others, these items were still worthless. However, they would be priceless in the future. Their values could increase by over ten-folds, even tens of folds. It was especially true for Card Sets. A complete set would be worth tens of times more than a single piece. Even so, the large Guilds would still have a hard time obtaining them.

After he was finished storing the items, Shi Feng made a trip to the Grocery Store. He bought five stacks of White Paper and one stack of pen and ink. These two items could be bought at extremely low prices at the Grocery Store. A stack of 200 White Papers only sold for 10 Copper Coins, whereas as a stack of 20 bottles of Black Ink sold for 15 Copper Coins. The best Feathered Pen also only sold for 20 Copper.

Even so, Shi Feng’s casual purchase far exceeded the daily income of an average player.

An average player would definitely be unable to spend in such a way. However, to Shi Feng, these Copper Coins could no longer be considered money. Moreover, these items were all necessary for making Forging Designs. Shi Feng would still buy them, even if they cost 10 Silver Coins.

After buying the items, Shi Feng headed for the Forging Association.

“Sir, do you need any cooling beverages? I have here the best Fruit Juice in Red Leaf Town. It tastes extremely good, and it is only 1 Copper Coin per cup.” A fragile-looking young lady nervously asked a male Guardian Knight. The girl was holding onto a small basket, her doll-like eyes carrying with them earnest expectations as she looked at the man.

“Scram! Don’t annoy me! It’s just a virtual item, moreover a beverage, yet you are actually charging 1 Copper Coin for it? I wouldn’t want it even if you were giving it for free!” The Guardian Knight cursed in rage, pushing the 16 or 17 years old girl away. He then added, “My luck is just bad. Just you wait and see; I’ll take care of you if I don’t get to buy a Glimmer Chestplate because you delayed me.”

The girl that was pushed down but did not cry. Instead, she stood up without wavering. She clapped the dust off her clothes, proceeding to another player with a smile on her face.

Shi Feng was faintly shocked. He never imagined the girl to be so tough. The average female player usually would not carry out such laborious tasks, not to mention receiving the insults from other players.

When Shi Feng looked at this girl, he was reminded of his own past self.

Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on the girl.

Violet Cloud, Level 1 Cleric.

Shi Feng’s heart slightly tightened when he saw this name. This girl was actually Violet Cloud, one of the top ten Clerics in God’s Domain. If he could recruit her to his side, his team would have a considerable future.

“Hahaha! This is a virtual game, yet you’re actually trying to earn money by selling cold beverages? Do you think you’re Milk Tea Sister[1]? Only idiots would buy them. Seeing that you’re good-looking, why don’t you come over to my place tonight? I can even give you 1 Silver Coin.” A lecherous man in his thirties walked up to Violet Cloud, drooling as he harassed her.

“Sir, I am only selling cold beverages. Please have some self-respect.” Violet Cloud retreated a step, resolutely saying.

“I’ve given you praise, yet you’re still headstrong. You’re but a lowly Lifestyle player. If you don’t agree with me today, then you can forget about doing business here in the future.” The lecherous man threatened in rage. He blocked Violet Cloud’s path, staring at her snow-white neck and licking his lips.

“How could you act in such a way? You are simply shameless!” Violet Cloud’s eyes were filled with anger. However, she could not win against him in a fight. If she were to continue wasting time here, even her final hope would be gone.

“Hehe, I am shameless. What are you going to do about it? Bite me?” The man felt even better when he looked at Violet Cloud’s panicked expression.

Watching Violet Cloud trying to hold back from crying and the tears that were rolling about in her eyes, she became even more lovable.

“Uncle, please give way. I want a thousand cups of Fruit Juice.” Shi Feng used Observing Eyes on the lecherous man. His name was displayed as Drifting Blood, and he was currently Level 3. At this stage of the game, his level was considered relatively good.

Drifting Blood turned towards Shi Feng, sending him a glare, saying, “Brat, this girl is mine. If you don’t wish for something to happen to you, then scram. You want a thousand cups? Then I want ten thousand cups. Do you think you’re a tycoon capable of simply taking out 10 Silver Coins? If you continue competing with me like a fool, I’ll send you back to Level 0.”

If fighting were not prohibited within the Town, he would have long since gotten rid of Shi Feng.

“Hahaha! An amusing show this early in the day. Go for it! Don’t hold back! Don’t argue if you can fight!”

“What a tycoon, spending 10 Silver Coins just like that. Unfortunately for him, he’s angered Fatty Bear of [Martial Union]. There’s going to be an amusing show to watch.”

“Dog’s fart tycoon; I bet he’s just boasting to impress the girl. If he can really bring out 10 Silver Coins, I’ll live-stream myself eating shit.”

Quite a few busybodies stopped to watch the occurring scene. They all started a discussion about Shi Feng’s actions.

Shi Feng did not pay any attention to Drifting Blood at all. He grabbed Drifting Blood’s shoulder, applying a slight force.

Before Drifting Blood could react, he was already kneeling on the ground. No matter how much strength he used, even to the point where his face had turned beet-red, he still could not stand back up.

The surrounding onlookers were immediately dumbfounded.

Shi Feng was just too courageous, directly taking action within the premises of Red Leaf Town. Was he not afraid of being caught and jailed by the Guards?

Also, how did Shi Feng possess such immense strength? He had actually suppressed a Level 3 Guardian Knight with a single hand.

“Brat, you’re dead for sure. Just you wait till the Guards arrive,” Drifting Blood looked towards Shi Feng, smiling in disdain.

However, after waiting for some time, the Guards had still not shown up...

Shi Feng paid no attention to Drifting Blood as he firmly pressed him onto the ground, preventing him from even moving. Shi Feng looked towards Violet Cloud, his other hand holding out 10 Silver Coins, saying, “A thousand Fruit Juices, thank you.”

The players on the street, who were previously discussing amongst themselves, suddenly turned silent, their eyes nearly popping out of their sockets.

This was 10 Silver Coins, not 10 Copper Coins. Currently, they had felt extremely wealthy to even have a single Silver Coin on their person. On the other hand, Shi Feng had just simply taken out 10 Silver Coins. How rich was Shi Feng? Was he really a Brother Tycoon?

Violet Cloud rubbed her eyes. She looked at the 10 Coins in Shi Feng’s hand that gave off a silvery glow, her expression filled with incomparable shock. Originally, she thought Shi Feng was just trying to help her by saying so. Never would she have imagined that he would truly take out 10 Silver Coins to buy a thousand cups of cold beverages that nobody wanted.

Drifting Blood was similarly shocked. However, that shock quickly turned into greed. He thought about snatching the 10 Silver Coins and using them to buy a Glimmer Chestplate. There would even be leftovers remaining.

“Brat, I’m a member of Martial Union. If you don’t want to be killed back to Level 0, then immediately give me 20 Silvers. If you do so, I can consider letting you off this time. Otherwise, you’ll have to take responsibility for the consequences,” Drifting Blood’s gaze was affixed to the 10 Silver coins as he threatened in a chilling tone.

Paying no attention to Drifting Blood, Shi Feng looked at Violet Cloud. Seeing that the girl did not react, he asked, “Do you not have that much Fruit Juice?”

“En. I only have 156 cups of Fruit Juice with me. How about you give me a Silver Coin, and I’ll sell all of the Fruit Juice to you? Is that alright?” Violet Cloud worried that she would anger Shi Feng. What would she do if he suddenly decided not to buy? At the same time, she also wanted to thank Shi Feng for helping her, so she reduced her selling price.

“Alright. I wonder how long it would take for you to make 900 cups of Fruit Juice? I want all of them,” Shi Feng nodded after some thought, asking.

The surrounding players were all dumbfounded. What was he planning to do? Did this brat know the value of 10 Silver Coins? Did this brat truly fancy this young lady?

“I’m very slow at compounding Fruit Juice. If Sir is willing, I can be done in thirty hours.” Violet Cloud became extremely glad at Shi Feng’s words. However, when she thought of her extremely slow speed, she worried that Shi Feng would no longer wish to buy them. So, she stretched out five fingers, hurriedly saying, “How about this? I’ll just charge you 5 Silver Coins for 900 cups.”
