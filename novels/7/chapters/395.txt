Chapter 396 - Powerful Aid

Inside Blue Mountain Restaurant, a high-class restaurant located in White River City’s Noble’s District. As White River City’s upper-class area, the cost of living here was very high. It was a place that ordinary players rarely visited.

At this moment, however, there were actually three players, two women and one man, sitting under one of the outdoor gazebos of Blue Mountain Restaurant.

Of the two female players, one was a bright and seductive witch, while the other was an otherworldly fairy. Meanwhile, the man exuding a cold, murderous intent by their side also possessed a valiant look. With his combination of a handsome face and frosty personality, many young ladies would definitely fall prey to him.

“Snow, you can tell me who it is now, right? Just who is that mysterious person you called for?” Zhao Yueru whispered as she shifted closer to Gentle Snow’s side, the expression on her face saying, “I won’t tell anyone else.”

“Don’t worry. You yourself have met that person before. In any case, he’ll be here in just a moment.” Gentle Snow smiled faintly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I know them?” Zhao Yueru immediately started searching her memories, trying to recall all the experts she had met. However, taking into consideration the severity of the matter this time, she dismissed the large majority of them. In the end, she still shook her head and gave up. She truly could not figure out just which amazing character her friend had invited.

If Zhao Yueru had to point out an amazing character she had personally met before, then that would be Star-Moon Kingdom’s number one expert, One-hit Asura Black Flame.

However, as the Guild Leader of Zero Wing, Black Flame was obviously not suitable this time. If they really were to invite him, those people might even disagree to hold the match and make up even more excuses.

There were countless players in God’s Domain. Meanwhile, Black Flame managed to obtain the rank of 481 on the God’s Domain Experts List, as well as being given the title of Asura by the Secret Pavilion. Let alone a single Star-Moon Kingdom, there were only a few players throughout the entire God’s Domain stronger than Black Flame.

Looking at Zhao Yueru’s defeated expression, Gentle Snow could not help but curl her lips up even higher.

If not even Zhao Yueru, someone who was extremely familiar with her, could guess the identity of the person she invited, then it was even more impossible for those people. Most likely, even if she were to reveal that person’s name, those people would not know anything about that person, either.

Listening in on Gentle Snow and Zhao Yueru’s conversation, the aloof-looking man’s curiosity reluctantly grew as well.

The operation this time needed to be kept a secret. It was something that should not be told to outsiders. At the same time, this operation was of utmost importance to Gentle Snow.

Yet, Gentle Snow had done the unthinkable: she had actually requested the help of an outsider instead of choosing an expert subordinated to her. This decision had inspired both confusion and curiosity in him with regard to the expert who would arrive in a moment.

“Fierce, why didn’t Nimble Snake come with you?” Gentle Snow asked, shifting her gaze to the impassive youth beside her.

The reason why Ouroboros was able to become a dominant force in the virtual gaming world was mainly due to a few reasons. Other than its Founding Members, Guild Leader, Branch Leaders, and Elders, it also had the Thirty-two Advocators and the Twelve Apostles.

The last two groups of players were carefully chosen from the large number of experts within the God-Slaying Army, and they could be said to be the strongest combat power of Ouroboros.

This was especially true for the Twelve Apostles. Each and every one of them possessed strength that not even Gentle Snow herself could casually dismiss.

Meanwhile, the cold youth before her was one of the Twelve Apostles, Fierce Snake.

The Nimble Snake she mentioned was also one of the Twelve Apostles. However, Nimble’s strength was still a cut above Fierce’s. Among the Twelve Apostles, Nimble was also ranked close to the top, and he was one of the key figures for the operation this time around.

“Nimble said he had something to take care of, so he might come a little later. However, he is always punctual, so you can rest assured, Big Sis Snow. Not to mention, the operation this time is of such importance,” Fierce Snake assured.

Gentle Snow nodded in reply.

Gentle Snow had nurtured quite a few confidants in Ouroboros. Apart from the Apostles, she had also nurtured a few among the Advocators. However, the operation to be carried out later required someone with top-notch combat power. Although the Advocators were also very strong, they were still not comparable to the Apostles.

She could not afford to be careless in the operation this time. If she failed, the results would be irreversible, hence why she had called for Fierce Snake and Nimble Snake. In addition, out of worry that her plan might fail due to unforeseen circumstances, she had even invited Ye Feng.

After Gentle Snow’s group of three chatted for a while, a man wearing a black cloak came walking over.

Zhao Yueru, who had originally been idle and bored, immediately widened her eyes in shock upon seeing who was approaching. Unable to help herself, she said, “Snow, don’t tell me he’s the person you invited?”

“Of course. Who else do you think I would invite?” Gentle Snow chuckled lightly as she stood up to welcome that ordinary-looking man.

Meanwhile, the identity of this ordinary-looking man was none other than Shi Feng.

Zhao Yueru possessed a certain understanding of Ye Feng’s strength. Although she felt a little hatred for the man, she could not help but admit that Ye Feng was indeed very strong.

If it were any other person, they would definitely be fooled by that ordinary appearance and aura of his. In fact, she, too, had suffered under a similar misconception. However, as someone who had personally witnessed Ye Feng’s strength, Zhao Yueru knew that he was definitely not the slightest bit inferior to them. From the Dungeon raid, the previous few battles, as well as the fact that he was the first player to enter White River City, all of these clearly proved how strong Ye Feng was.

However, because of Black Flame’s sudden celebrity, Ye Feng’s existence had slowly disappeared from everyone’s minds. Even Zhao Yueru herself had nearly forgotten that there was still this hateful person...

“Miss Snow, may I know why you have called me here this time?” Shi Feng was somewhat curious about the reason for Gentle Snow’s latest invitation. Previously, Gentle Snow had always been tight-lipped on the matter, so Shi Feng had not asked about it. Now that the operation was set to begin, he needed to at least understand what they were to do. “Of course, if Miss Snow feels it inconvenient to speak, you need only tell me what you can.”

“Since you’re already here, there is naturally no need to keep this matter a secret any longer. It is a competition. Five people, five matches, the first to win three wins the competition. I have invited you here to defeat one person on the opposition team. The remuneration is twenty million Credits,” Gentle Snow said truthfully.

“Twenty million!” Shi Feng was greatly shocked upon hearing this amount.

Previously, Gentle Snow had already paid five million upfront just to have him show up. With this additional twenty million, the total would come to twenty-five million Credits. Wasn’t it just a competition? Was there a need to be so extravagant?

There were countless people in the world who could not earn a million Credits even after working for their entire lives. Yet, with just a few words, Gentle Snow had casually spent tens of millions. Comparisons were indeed odious.

Originally, Shi Feng had thought he could be considered a relatively wealthy person. Now, in comparison to Gentle Snow, he was practically a pauper...

“Of course, twenty million is just the basics. Depending on the opponent’s strength, I can further increase the remuneration.” Gentle Snow nodded.

“Okay, I accept this condition.” Shi Feng was naturally very satisfied with this deal.

Currently, Zero Wing had just started its development, and Shi Feng needed money for all aspects. Yet, he also could not constantly convert his Coins into Credits. Hence, this twenty million could definitely be considered a timely injection of funds.

Upon Shi Feng’s agreement, Gentle Snow sighed in relief. With a great expert like him around, things should proceed much more smoothly later on.

However, before she even had the time to feel joyous, she suddenly received a message.

When she read this message, her expression immediately turned grim. At this moment, everyone beside Gentle Snow could feel a bone-chilling aura emanating from her.
