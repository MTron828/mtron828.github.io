Chapter 366 – Astonishing Zero Wing

Thunder Fortress, Blood Rabbit Hotel:

The Blood Rabbit Hotel was a Basic Hotel located on the edge of the Thunder Fortress. Its location in the Thunder Fortress was far from ideal. Not only was it far from the port, but it was also a considerable distance from the Adventurer’s Association. As a result, not even independent players would choose to rest here.

The Blood Rabbit Hotel’s only advantages over other hotels were its price and size. It only cost five Magic Crystals a day to rent a room in the hotel. The hotel was also on the larger side of Basic Hotels, with well over a thousand rooms.

Currently, many players were crowded outside the six-story-tall Blood Rabbit Hotel. Every one of these players wore six-winged emblems on their chests. Although over 90% of these players were Tier 3 players, the number of Tier 4 players among them was no fewer than the Tier 4 players the various hegemonic powers possessed.

!!

When Shi Feng’s group of four stepped into the Blood Rabbit Hotel’s lobby, even Shi Feng, who had not returned to the Miniature Ancient World for some time, couldn’t help but be surprised by what he saw.

At this time, Su Qianliu and the other executives of Zero Wing were already gathered in the lobby. However, compared to before Shi Feng left the Miniature Ancient World, Zero Wing now had many more executive members. Moreover, apart from Su Qianliu, Firecloud, Happy Snow, and Rampant Blade, everyone else had also reached Tier 4.

Among the new executives were Mysterious Moon’s Zhuo Yalin, Lin Yao Yue, and Crimson Seal. There were also the Star Alliance’s Galaxy Past and the Purple Light Trading Firm’s Echoing Judgment, Wordless Ember, and Slumbering Quicksand.

When Shi Feng was away from the Miniature Ancient World, Mysterious Moon, the Star Alliance, and the Purple Light Trading Firm had all chosen to merge into Zero Wing. Meanwhile, because of the two first-rate Guilds and the Purple Light Trading Firm’s mix, Zero Wing became the seventh great power among the Miniature Ancient World’s various native powers.

Incredible! So, this is Zero Wing?

Midsummer was taken aback when she saw Zero Wing’s executives. Particularly, Echoing Judgment, Wordless Ember, Slumbering Quicksand, Galaxy Past, Crimson Seal, and Su Qianliu. She could feel significant pressure coming from these six people. Although she had more or less learned about Zero Wing through Shi Feng and Wu Xiaoxiao, she didn’t think Zero Wing would be strong to such an extent.

The control these six people had over mana was simply unbelievable.

Even though none of these six people had entered the Hundred Refinement Building, they had already developed their Mana Bodies to a 120% Completion Rate. Moreover, she could feel the presence of titled experts coming from Wordless Ember and Slumbering Quicksand.

It should be known that they were currently in an isolated miniature world. Without the assistance of the Greater God’s Domain’s resources and environment, even paragons like Saint Nine would be fortunate to reach the fourth-floor standard.

Normally, even third-floor experts were incredibly rare in isolated God’s Domains and miniature worlds. Moreover, most of these third-floor experts would be Tier 6 players in their respective worlds. Meanwhile, after entering the Greater God’s Domain, these third-floor experts would quickly grow to the fourth-floor standard, with some even becoming titled experts.

Although many of the Starlight Realm’s hegemonic powers had invested in the Miniature Ancient World, the assistance these powers could provide to the Miniature Ancient World’s natives was extremely limited. It was nowhere near the assistance players could obtain in the Greater God’s Domain.

If Su Qianliu and the others were to enter the Greater God’s Domain, their future would be limitless.

As expected of the Guild chosen by Vice President Xia. With Zero Wing’s current strength, it can already compete with the various hegemonic powers.

Jun Luosha and Wu Xiaoxiao were similarly surprised when they saw Su Qianliu and the others.

Unlike Midsummer, Jun Luosha and Wu Xiaoxiao were native to the Miniature Ancient World. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that they had watched Zero Wing grow from nothing to its current state in the Miniature Ancient World.

However, compared to the information they learned through the Green God Corporation’s reports, the current strength of Zero Wing’s executives was like night and day. The rumors about Zero Wing having only Black Flame to support it couldn’t be any further from the truth.

At the very least, when it came to fourth-floor experts, the number Zero Wing had was hardly any inferior to the number the various hegemonic powers had committed to the Miniature Ancient World.

Out of Shi Feng’s group of four, only Shi Feng knew that it was normal for Su Qianliu and the others to have their current strength.

After all, mana was the foundation of everything in God’s Domain, and the Tower of Transcendence[1] improved all aspects of mana. Hence, training in the Tower of Transcendence yielded extraordinary results. On top of that, Su Qianliu and the others also had the assistance of the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique and the Hypersensitivity Potion. These were all resources that even the Greater God’s Domain’s various hegemonic powers did not possess.

“What do you think, Guild Leader?” Su Qianliu asked when she saw Shi Feng walking over, a hint of pride in her voice. “Zero Wing is very strong now, right?”

Even without including the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s Tier 4 experts, Zero Wing already had 155 Tier 4 experts. This was more than what most hegemonic powers in the Miniature Ancient World possessed. If they factored in the use of Magic Tactical Vehicles, Zero Wing could have even more Tier 4 combatants.

In a frontal confrontation, Su Qianliu could confidently say that Zero Wing would not lose to any hegemonic power in the Miniature Ancient World.

Though, after boasting Zero Wing’s achievements to Shi Feng, Su Qianliu couldn’t help but look at Wu Xiaoxiao and Jun Luosha in surprise. Or, more specifically, she was taken aback by the Zero Wing Emblem they wore. She didn’t think that Jin Hai City’s famous genius Wu Xiaoxiao would actually join Zero Wing, much less Jun Luosha, the Green God Corporation’s number one genius. This was definitely big news. After all, Jun Luosha was highly coveted by even the various hegemonic powers.

“The Guild has indeed grown a lot stronger while I was away,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

The current Zero Wing might not be a match for the Greater God’s Domain’s various hegemonic powers, but it was undoubtedly stronger than the detached forces the various hegemonic powers had sent to the Miniature Ancient World.

“We’ve already heard about the matter regarding Dira, Guild Leader,” Su Qianliu said. “We’ll definitely have to teach the Paimon Conglomerate a good lesson once the World Passage opens. Commander Laura has also said that her party will come to our aid as soon as possible. We’ll make sure the Paimon Conglomerate’s entry into the World Passage will be a one-way trip!”

Other powers might be able to tolerate their Guild Leaders signing a slave contract, but that was not something Zero Wing could tolerate. Had she been at the banquet, she would have definitely taught Dira a lesson without hesitation.

“If Commander Laura’s party can come, that is indeed good news.” Shi Feng was surprised. Laura Crader and her companions were very mysterious in their actions. Ever since they arrived in the Miniature Ancient World, they would hardly ever show themselves. Yet, every member of their party was incredibly strong, much stronger than even the likes of Wordless Ember and Slumbering Quicksand. “But even with their help, we still need a little something else to go up against the Paimon Conglomerate. Have you prepared the materials I asked you to gather?”

After returning to the Miniature Ancient World, Shi Feng immediately contacted Su Qianliu and asked her to prepare the materials needed for the Primordial Divine Dragon Summoning. Although these materials were scarce in the Miniature Ancient World, preparing one or two sets should still be possible. And because the Primordial Divine Dragon Summoning’s Magic Array Scrolls had a 100% production success rate, every set of material collected would equal one complete set of Magic Array Scrolls.

Meanwhile, a Tier 5 Primordial Divine Dragon’s phantom was a weapon of mass destruction. It could be used to great effect even in a war between kingdoms in the Greater God’s Domain, let alone the Miniature Ancient World.

“I didn’t have much preparation time, and you asked for a large variety of Epic materials, so I only managed to collect four sets thus far. I’m going to need more time if you want more sets,” Su Qianliu said in embarrassment as she took out a bag full of materials.

“Four sets?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but laugh. “With this many, we can definitely make the Paimon Conglomerate suffer.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng was done allocating responsibilities in Zero Wing, he left for a room in the Blood Rabbit Hotel to start producing the scrolls for the Primordial Divine Dragon Summoning.

Are these the items Dira dropped?

Just as Shi Feng was about to retrieve the material bag, he paused when he noticed two foreign items in his spatial bag.
