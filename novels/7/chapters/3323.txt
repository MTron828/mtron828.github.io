Chapter 398 – Starlight’s Ten Greats

“Who is this person? Why is she letting a newcomer from the selection start first?”

“Shh! Keep your voice down! She’s Red Frost, the Star Lake Legion’s new commander!”

“What? She’s that Madwoman?”

“Didn’t they say that the Madwoman has the body of a bear and a voice that can cause people to go deaf?”

!!

…

Initially, many of the participants in the arena were dissatisfied with the words of the woman standing on the second-floor podium. After all, the woman looked roughly the same age as they were, possibly even younger. So, it was only natural they would get upset when the woman talked down to them in such a nonchalant manner.

However, after learning from others that the woman was the rumored new commander of the Star Lake Legion, they were promptly stunned.

Red Frost was a legend who had emerged from Star Lake City. In the past, even mighty conglomerates had extended invitations to her, offering her the position of Elder should she agree to join them.

This was because Red Frost used to be one of the Starlight Realm’s Ten Greats.

Although Red Frost had inexplicably fallen from grace while visiting a Sanctuary in God’s Domain and lost a significant portion of her strength even after getting resurrected, she remained a three-star mental strength grandmaster in the real world. Or, more specifically, she was someone who had already stepped out of the realm of three-star mental strength grandmasters. She was still an existence that ordinary corporations feared.

“What? Do you people have an opinion?” Red Frost asked as she swept her gaze across the people who had spoken up. “Come up here if you have an opinion. I’ll find you a nice, quiet place to chat.”

“N-No… We don’t have an opinion…”

The people who had previously spoken up hurriedly shut their mouths.

Red Frost’s vengeful personality was known throughout the Starlight Realm. Anyone who dared to offend Red Frost would not have good days ahead of them. Even the Guild Leaders of upper-ranking hegemonic powers wouldn’t dare to offend Red Frost for fear of the trouble she could cause them.

Red Frost?

Shi Feng grew confused as he looked at the woman on the podium. Although he instantly recognized Red Frost as the staff member responsible for conducting his first selection test in the God’s Domain Association, he had never heard of the name Red Frost during his previous life.

Yet, going by everyone’s expressions and private discussions, it was evident that Red Frost was famous in the Greater God’s Domain. Moreover, she was someone whose mental strength was already very close to reaching the great grandmaster standard.

“Cowards!” Red Frost said as she rolled her eyes at the several people. Then, she returned her focus to the crowd and continued, “I also have one more thing to announce. I will be modifying the enrollment rules for this year. I’m thinking of taking your concern off of the limited number of official participant slots, so for this year, all of you can become official participants so long as you pass the basic test I’ve set.”

The crowd in the arena grew restless again when they heard Red Frost’s announcement.

The biggest hurdle for reserve participants to become official participants was the limited number of available official participant slots. So, having this limitation taken care of was naturally good news for them.

“Commander Frost! May we know what your test is?”

Once the crowd in the arena was finished processing Red Frost’s words, many reserve participants eagerly asked Red Frost for the content of her so-called basic test.

“Don’t be in such a hurry,” Red Frost said, smirking when she saw everyone’s eager looks. Then, she pointed at the vice commanders lined up next to her and continued, “So long as you can survive ten moves from one of them, you will have passed the basic test. If you can survive twenty moves, you’ll get to join an ace battle group. However, if you can’t survive even three moves from one of my vice commanders, come back and try again next year.”

As soon as Red Frost finished speaking, whether it was the participants gathered in the middle of the arena or the vice commanders standing next to Red Frost, all of them were dumbfounded.

“Isn’t this too high of a requirement, Commander?” Markless Blade anxiously asked. “Some people here are newcomers who’ve never even participated in simulation warfare. Moreover, anyone capable of surviving ten moves against us would already be at the captain level in the legion. These newcomers can’t even survive three moves against us, let alone ten.”

Simulation warfare might be similar to duels occurring in God’s Domain, but players needed to materialize their own weapons and equipment in simulation warfare, and doing so put a huge strain on one’s mind. Even a fourth-floor expert experienced in simulation warfare would have difficulty executing basic combat techniques after materializing their weapons and equipment, let alone a bunch of newcomers.

“No, I think Commander Frost’s idea is good, Brother Markless,” a young man with an imposing presence interjected. “The previous commander was too lenient on newcomers. If Star Lake City wishes to grow stronger, it will need stronger fighters to represent it in city battles!”

“If that’s the case, the number of people who will pass won’t even be enough to form a full battle group, Vice Commander Qilin,” Markless Blade said as he rolled his eyes at Chen Qilin. He was fully aware that Chen Qilin was looking to target Shi Feng, and he did not doubt Chen Qilin would let this perfect opportunity get away. If Shi Feng was prevented from passing even the basic test, Chen Qilin would then have a good excuse to sideline Shi Feng in the legion.

“Alright, let’s just begin!” Red Frost said, annoyed by Markless Blade’s and Chen Qilin’s bickering. Then, she swept her gaze across her vice commanders and asked, “Which one of you will go first?”

“Since I support the commander’s decision, let me be the first examiner,” Chen Qilin said, volunteering himself.

“Commander?” Markless Blade couldn’t help but turn to Red Frost. He refused to believe that Red Frost was unaware of Chen Qilin’s aim.

However, Red Frost did not respond to Markless Blade’s gaze. Instead, she narrowed her eyes on Chen Qilin and faintly smiled, saying, “Good! You’ll be the first examiner, then!”

“Many thanks, Commander! I won’t disappoint you! I’ll be sure to let these newcomers know your good intentions,” Chen Qilin said, grinning.After saying so, Chen Qilin jumped down from the arena’s second floor. Even though it was a seven-meter jump, not only did he land steadily on his feet, but he also didn’t make any sound when landing. In addition, he started walking as soon as he landed, not needing to stop to stabilize himself at all. The control he had over his physical body had already reached inhuman levels.
