Chapter 2871 - Tier 5?

“They’re dead?”

The spectators in the room were stunned to see Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe collapsing to the floor, their minds failing to process this situation.

Cold Shadow and the long-haired youth from Solar Temple, in particular, appeared petrified, their bodies remaining utterly motionless as they stared at the two sprawled corpses. How is this possible!?

The instructor failed to endure even a single hit?

Compared to everyone else present, Cold Shadow and the long-haired youth had a much better understanding of Situ Qingtian’s and Chiyang Tianhe’s strengths.

Setting aside the fact that the two elderly men had combat standards close to the Beyond Domain Realm, just their Basic Attributes and Mana Bodies were more than enough for them to combat Superior Mythic monsters of the same level.

Despite being so monstrously powerful, Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe had failed to mount even the slightest bit of resistance to Shi Feng before dying. This was simply unbelievable.

Yuan Tiexin and Purple Jade were similarly astonished at this situation, their minds unable to recover from the shock even after a long time.

They had expected a heaven-defying battle and even felt that Shi Feng had been unwise to provoke Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe. After all, if these two Superior Mythic equivalents went all out, destroying Zero Wing’s Residence wouldn’t be impossible for them. Even if Shi Feng eventually succeeded in killing them, Zero Wing would still have to pay a significant price.

Yet, now… Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, unlike everyone else present, Nether King Relos’s attention wasn’t on Situ Qingtian’s and Chiyang Tianhe’s corpses. Instead, he stared at Shi Feng’s figure standing calmly by the window wall, his eyes wide with fear and horror.

“A Tier 5 Sword Saint?”

Although it was only an instant, Relos had felt unprecedented fear overwhelming his body when Shi Feng executed his attack. That spine-chilling fear hadn’t come from just witnessing Shi Feng’s frightening power. Instead, it was an instinctive, bone-deep fear.

Relos was no ordinary Tier 4 player; he was someone who had developed his Mana Body to an incredible extent. If he were facing a player of the same tier, his body wouldn’t have such a reaction.

The only way Relos could explain this situation was that Shi Feng was no longer a Tier 4 player. Instead, Shi Feng was already a Tier 5 Sword Saint!

Although Relos had subconsciously muttered to himself, he had not done so on a private channel. Hence, no matter how soft his voice had been, the Tier 4 experts present heard him loud and clear.

“Tier 5?”

Everyone turned toward Shi Feng, one after another. Previously, they had been so shocked by Situ Qingtian’s and Chiyang Tianhe’s deaths that they had forgotten about Shi Feng’s existence and the brief stagnation and fear they had felt.

How is this possible?! He’s reached Tier 5 already?!

Cold Shadow and the long-haired youth wore grim expressions as they looked at Shi Feng, their minds in denial.

Shi Feng no longer concealed his power. Hence, everyone in the room could feel tremendous pressure originating from a difference in Life Rating. Shi Feng’s Life Rating was something no Tier 4 player could possess, no matter what. If a Tier 4 player’s Life Rating were equated to a bonfire, then Shi Feng’s Life Rating was like the scorching sun. Unless he deliberately suppressed and concealed his Life Rating, there was no way anybody could fail to notice it. Is this why he dares to ignore the two Super Guilds?

When Yuan Tiexin looked at Situ Qingtian’s and Chiyang Tianhe’s corpses and then at Shi Feng’s nonchalance, the shock in his heart multiplied exponentially.

Meanwhile, Purple Jade was at a loss for words, a complicated expression on her face.

She had come to Zero Wing City to determine her growth and whether she could catch up to Shi Feng

However, let alone catching up, the two of them weren’t even standing on the same playing field anymore.

Tier 5!

In the current era, Tier 5 existences were already considered the apex existences of God’s Domain. They were capable of single-handedly destroying an entire kingdom, monsters that no current Tier 4 player could hope to go up against. “Guild Leader!”

Fire Dance’s eyes brimmed with jubilation and shock when she looked at Shi Feng.

This revelation was too shocking!

If Zero Wing still had to be fearful of the Five Great Super Guilds before, then it could now ignore their existence. After all, the gap between Tier 4 and Tier 5 was utterly massive. Even if the Five Great Super Guilds had many monstrously strong players and even individuals at the Beyond Domain Realm, none of them would be a match for a Tier 5 existence.

Unless the Five Great Super Guilds similarly produced a Tier 5 expert, it wouldn’t matter, even if they attacked Zero Wing with a large number of Tier 4 experts.

Not to mention, destroying a Guild City was child’s play for a Tier 5 player. Only a Main City-level Guild City could repulse a Tier 5. Moreover, if one didn’t have any means of retaliation, even a Main City would eventually fall to a Tier 5 player.

While Fire Dance was inwardly celebrating Shi Feng’s achievement, Shi Feng turned his sights to Cold Shadow and the long-haired youth from Solar Temple. He then said calmly, “I only dealt a small punishment to the two of them today. If your two Guilds pull such a stunt one more time, I won’t mind visiting your headquarters!”

Cold Shadow and the long-haired youth did not have any thoughts of refuting Shi Feng. They promptly left the reception room, together with their Guild members.

Netherworld Empire’s and Secret Pavilion’s members quietly watched with complicated feelings as the two Super Guilds’ members left. Before, they had been treating Zero Wing as just another superpower. However, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call Zero Wing the number one Guild of God’s Domain now.

Not only did Zero Wing possess a Tier 5 Sword Saint, but it even had a holy land like Zero Wing City. At this point, even the Five Great Super Guilds couldn’t hope to compete with it. Given enough time, Zero Wing was sure to become God’s Domain’s number one Guild.

At this point, Relos suddenly stood up from his seat, approached Shi Feng, and said respectfully, “Guild Leader Black Flame, I, Relos, wish to establish a partnership with Zero Wing on behalf of Netherworld Empire. We do not want much. We only need one temporary Guild Residence in Zero Wing City. In return, Netherworld Empire will provide Zero Wing with resources and business connections in the western continent. We will also establish a military alliance with Zero Wing to resist the Outerworld players. May I know what you think of this proposal, Guild Leader Black Flame?”

Although Relos’s respectful demeanor and sincere offer might seem surprising to others, the masked youth from Netherworld Empire and Yuan Tiexin did not find this situation unexpected at all.

While reaching Tier 5 might not be impossible for an expert like Relos, it would still be incredibly challenging. This was because the promotion to Tier 5 had nothing to do with a player’s combat standards. Instead, it depended entirely on one’s control over and understanding of Mana and the ability to construct a Tier 5 Mana Body.

Before reaching Tier 5 himself, Relos would only be seeking death if he behaved arrogantly in front of a Tier 5 existence.

Not one to fall behind, Yuan Tiexin also extended a similar partnership offer on behalf of the Secret Pavilion. The only difference was that the Secret Pavilion would only help defend Zero Wing City and Stone Forest City; it would not take part in any other battles.

“Sure, I can agree to your conditions,” Shi Feng said after hearing the two Guilds’ offers. “However, I have an additional condition.”

Upon receiving this encouraging response, Relos grew a little excited and prompted, “Please speak, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Initially, Relos thought that Shi Feng wouldn’t agree to his offer and would choose to monopolize Zero Wing City’s resources. Shi Feng’s willingness to negotiate was a positive outcome.

Yuan Tiexin also nodded in agreement with Relos’s words.

Shi Feng smiled and said, “My condition is simple-a complete Guild Legacy. If your two Guilds can provide me with your complete Guild Legacies, I can give you temporary Residences in Zero Wing City immediately!”

Zero Wing was not lacking in resources at the moment. So long as Zero Wing City remained standing, the Guild would have no trouble acquiring resources. However, a Guild’s development did not rely solely on resources. It also needed manpower and talents.

Hence, acquiring a complete Guild Legacy was of utmost importance for Zero Wing. Only with a complete Guild Legacy could Zero Wing reliably nurture its experts to the Domain Realm. “Okay, I agree to your condition on Netherworld Empire’s behalf!” Relos answered without hesitation.

Upon hearing Relos’s response, Yuan Tiexin gritted his teeth and said, “The Secret Pavilion has no problem with this, either.”

When Shi Feng heard the two Guilds’ positive replies, he inwardly sighed in relief. After all, a Guild Legacy was the root of a Guild. Many Guilds would rather face annihilation than share their Guild Legacy. He then nodded and said, “Good! I wish our three Guilds a happy partnership from now on!”

Shortly afterward, Shi Feng signed a contract with the Secret Pavilion and Netherworld Empire, taking an essential step toward Zero Wing’s becoming God’s Domain’s number one Guild.

As Shi Feng concluded his discussion with the two Guilds, news of his promotion to Tier 5 and his killing Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe in Zero Wing City quickly spread and reached the ears of God’s Domain’s various powers.

For a time, the entire God’s Domain was in an uproar!
