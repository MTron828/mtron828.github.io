Chapter 2757 – Fifteen Seconds!

Everyone gasped at Todelya’s appearance.

A Realm Lord was an existence close to rivaling World Bosses. Not to mention, Todelya was a Realm Lord of the Ruined Mountain Range. Its strength was most likely on par with that of World Bosses in the outside world.

“This is the terror of a forbidden land for humans?” Mu Lingsha smiled wryly at the sight of the Soul Singer.

She finally understood why none of the various superpowers’ expert teams managed to make it out of the Ruined Mountain Range alive.

It would be strange if they did!

At this time, not only was half of their team dead, but they also had to fight a large number of Soul Devourers. Although the Soul Devourers weren’t particularly strong, most of the surviving members of their team couldn’t fully exhibit their combat power, either.

The Soul Devourers dealt astonishingly powerful mental damage. Even after players broke free from the Soul Devourers’ mental shackles, the mental damage still existed, affecting their brains. The consequent headaches prevented the players from executing delicate actions, which, in turn, lowered their combat standards by two ranks on average.

Now, Void Realm experts could exhibit combat standards only at the Refinement Realm, while Domain Realm experts’ combat standards were at the Void Realm.

On the other hand, the Soul Devourers all had combat standards at the Trial Tower’s sixth floor. They could undoubtedly be considered first-rate experts, not much inferior to ordinary Tier 3 experts in combat standards.

With the addition of a Realm Lord, there was no way their team could get out of this situation alive.

Among those still standing, only Lifeless Thorn, Solitary Nine, Yan Ya, and Cleansing Whistle remained relatively calm, continuing to systematically slay the Soul Devourers troubling the players around them.

“Nine, Thorn, and Yan Ya, help me hold the Boss for 15 seconds!” Shi Feng said after saving another person from the Soul Devourers.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s command, Illusory Words and Unyielding Heart couldn’t help doubting their ears.

They’re still going to fight in this situation? Their opponents consisted of several hundred Soul Devourers and one Realm Lord. The only thing they could and should do now was run away.

The battle recovery of a monster of Todelya’s rank allowed it to regenerate 2% of its HP every five seconds. In other words, the Realm Lord could recover 410 million HP per five seconds. That was basically killing a Great Lord of the same level every five seconds. If they couldn’t accomplish that, they wouldn’t even be able to get Todelya’s HP below 98%.

Meanwhile, their team currently had fewer than 30 people alive, nearly half of them in a mentally weakened state and incapable of combat.

With Todelya’s Defense as a Superior Mythic thrown in, their team’s attacks would, at best, give the Realm Lord an itch.

“Fifteen seconds?” After briefly calculating their chances, Solitary Nine nodded and said, “No problem. However, 15 seconds really is the most I can do.”

Todelya’s mental influence was too powerful; even Solitary Nine felt a little overwhelmed.

“No problem! If you can’t handle it, I’ll take over!” Lifeless Thorn said, excitement flashing in his eyes as he looked at the approaching Soul Singer.

Previously, killing monsters for EXP had been a chore for him. After all, none of the monsters he fought allowed him to improve. He was killing them solely for the sake of leveling up.

However, after setting foot in the Ruined Mountain Range, he finally felt that he was truly fighting a battle.

Previously, he would get the exhilarating feeling of having one move decide his life or death only when fighting peak experts. Now, however, the Soul Devourers were giving him the same feeling. It was simply wonderful.

As for Todelya, the Realm Lord was an existence that could even terrify him. This was the kind of opponent he had been hankering for.

“Alright, let’s hurry up and head over! If we wait until the Boss arrives, the others might get dragged into the fight!” Yan Ya said, her head aching slightly when she saw Lifeless Thorn’s excited expression.

Solitary Nine and Lifeless Thorn activated the Power of Darkness, boosting their Basic Attributes by a large margin. Now, both of them were comparable with Tier 4 existences.

The next moment, the two melee players turned into streaks of light as they charged at Todelya. Meanwhile, Yan Ya, a Druid, chanted an incantation and flew toward the Realm Lord. Simultaneously, she cast a layer of Life Protection on both Solitary Nine and Lifeless Thorn, the Spell capable of absorbing some of the damage they took and converting it into HP.

Roar!

Todelya bellowed in anger when it saw two ants charging at it, its roar echoing throughout the Ruined Mountain Range’s outermost area.

As its roar spread, an invisible mental attack struck everyone.

Aside from Shi Feng, everyone present groaned in pain.

“Good! You really are powerful!”

After suffering Todelya’s mental attack, which was much stronger than its ever-present mental influence, Lifeless Thorn turned deathly pale. However, when he looked at the 30-meter-tall Realm Lord, not only did he not grow fearful of the Boss, but the fighting spirit in his eyes even burned brighter.

He raised his spear and transformed into a lightning bolt shooting at Todelya.

Tier 3 Legacy Skill, Lightning Flash!

With the Power of Darkness’s buff, this attack pierced through space itself. As if he had teleported, Lifeless Thorn instantly appeared before the Soul Singer.

So fast! This scene surprised Unyielding Heart.

There had been a 200-yard gap between Todelya and Lifeless Thorn, yet the latter had crossed this distance instantly. Unyielding Heart wasn’t sure he could react to such a speed even if he activated his Berserk Skill.

Boom!

A deafening boom echoed throughout the mountains. The next moment, a black shadow fell from the sky and struck the ground heavily, the impact of the collision creating a crater over two dozen meters in diameter.

Inside the crater, Lifeless Thorn stood, propping himself up with his spear. His hands on the spear trembled, and blood leaked out from a corner of his mouth. It was evident he had sustained a major blow. His HP had fallen by more than 460,000.

What happened?! Blue Gown, who was watching the clash from a distance, was dumbfounded.

Lifeless Thorn’s attack carried incredible power and speed. Even an actual Tier 4 Mythic monster should have suffered a serious injury from it.

Yet, not only did Lifeless Thorn fail to inflict any damage on Todelya, but he had even taken damage?

Moreover, Lifeless Thorn had lost close to 10% of his HP despite the Life Protection cast on him. At this rate, without additional healing, he would definitely die after six or seven more exchanges!

“Is this monster really just a Superior Mythic?”

Everyone couldn’t help doubting their eyes as they stared at the intact Soul Singer.

They had seen Superior Mythic monsters before. Some of them had even killed one before. However, compared to those Superior Mythic monsters, Todelya was like a completely different creature.

However, when Shi Feng, who was currently incanting, saw this scene, he wasn’t surprised at all.

The early stages of God’s Domain served to let players adapt to God’s Domain’s combat style. The Main God System had not only provided players with many benefits but also weakened the monsters in the game. In fact, even the Level 100-plus monsters that players felt were strong weren’t actually at their peak condition. They were still suppressed to a certain degree.

However, that was not the case for the monsters in forbidden lands. The monsters in these locations weren’t subject to the Main God System’s suppression and could exert 100% of their combat power.

In forbidden lands, Mythic monsters were beyond the capabilities of ordinary Tier 3 teams. Tier 3 players would need top-quality equipment and various support tools to even stand a chance. Moreover, the team would also need many experts with Berserk Skills. Otherwise, only one outcome awaited the team -annihilation!

Not to mention, Todelya was a bona fide Superior Mythic.

If Shi Feng himself fought Todelya right now, he definitely wouldn’t have an easy time. They would need at least six Tier 4 players to defeat this Boss. Otherwise, challenging the Realm Lord would be sheer suicide.

This was why he had tasked Lifeless Thorn’s trio with only holding back Todelya for 15 seconds. Asking them to hold the Realm Lord back for even a few seconds more was a luxury they couldn’t afford.

Subsequently, Solitary Nine and Lifeless Thorn activated their Lifesaving Skills one after another to defend against Todelya’s attacks. Even Yan Ya, who served as the healer of the trio, had to activate her Power of Darkness. Without the additional Basic Attributes, she would have died from any random stray attack that hit her.

One time, to defend against Todelya’s trampling, Solitary Nine activated his Tier 3 Shield Wall and interposed himself between the Realm Lord and his two companions. However, even with his Lifesaving Skill activated, the resulting shockwave still sent the trio flying several dozen meters away. Both Lifeless Thorn and Yan Ya lost over one million HP from the attack, whereas Solitary Nine lost over three million HP.

Five seconds!

Ten seconds! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Every second of battle placed immense pressure on the trio. Every moment they fought Todelya felt as if death would claim them in the next second.

The players spectating from afar were stupefied at this scene. This was the first time they truly understood how terrifying a Superior Mythic monster could be. If not for Lifeless Thorn’s group having activated their Berserk Skills, the trio would’ve most likely been killed instantly.

“Commander! Are you not done yet?” Solitary Nine asked Shi Feng through a private conversation.

Previously, he thought that it would be a joke if he couldn’t hold Todelya for 15 seconds. However, he now realized that 15 seconds was truly a long time.

“Good job!” At this time, Shi Feng had also finished chanting the final verse recorded in the Bible of Darkness. “Leave the rest to me!”
