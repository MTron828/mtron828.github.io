Chapter 3796 - 870 - Primordial Era's Wealth

Nightmare Holy City, Main Street:

“Commander, more and more people are tailing us now. The White Dragon Nation’s experts are most likely on their way here. Should we inform Guild Leader Black Flame?” Star Butterfly said worriedly after glancing at the players monitoring them from all corners of the street.

By now, everyone in the city should have already learned about Shi Feng’s party killing the White Dragon Nation’s experts. Thus, the party’s casual strolling in Nightmare Holy City was a huge affront to the Guild.

It should be known that the White Dragon Nation had millions of members inside Nightmare Holy City. The Guild’s Tier 6 experts exceeded 10,000. Killing several players inside the city was child’s play for the Guild.

Whirlwind Bulwark nodded in agreement.

The White Dragon Nation was a vengeful Guild. It would never let any slights against it slip by. Although Whirlwind Bulwark acknowledged the strength of Shi Feng’s party, he did not believe the party could resist the White Dragon Nation on the Guild’s home ground.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, the White Dragon Nation’s experts will be here soon. We must hurry if you want to look up information on the Northern Badlands’ Taboo.”

“Okay. Let’s head over to the library now,” Shi Feng said, nodding.

Through Whirlwind Bulwark’s introduction, Shi Feng already had a general understanding of players’ standards and development status in this remnant primordial world.

Virtually every Level 200-plus player in this world was currently based in Nightmare Holy City. Because of this, the city’s player population exceeded 300 million. Additionally, the combat standards of the players here were incredibly high. Only players who had mastered a Gold Combat Technique could be considered elite-level experts. Additionally, the average level of Tier 6 players here was Level 230, while elite-level Tier 6 experts averaged Level 233. However, nobody had reached Level 240 thus far.

Seven Luminaries Crystals were the primary currency in this world, while Undying Souls were a rarer and more valuable form of currency. Every monster here had a chance of dropping Undying Souls. Players who accumulated 30,000 Undying Souls could exchange them for a chance to take on the cross-region challenge inside Nightmare Holy City. So long as players passed the challenge, they could head to other regions to live. However, only a handful of players had conquered the challenge thus far.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But compared to the ease of obtaining Undying Souls in this world, what interested Shi Feng more was the Taboo Boss Whirlwind Bulwark mentioned.

The Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos were publicly acknowledged as being invincible. No power could kill them. Yet, as luck would have it, the Twenty-Two Taboos’ Taboo Nuclei were key to getting promoted to Tier 7.

At this point, Shi Feng did not have any confidence in killing any of the Twenty-Two Taboos, not even the weakest of them. However, when he learned that the Taboo Boss mentioned by Whirlwind Bulwark resembled the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos, he felt that his chance had arrived.

If the Taboo Boss Whirlwind Bulwark mentioned was similar to the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos, he would have a solid chance at obtaining a Taboo Nucleus. After all, the Taboo Boss in question was under Level 240.

Level 240 was a considerable milestone for monsters in God’s Domain. Although nobody could inspect the levels of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboos, everyone estimated they should be at least Level 240. This meant the minimum requirement to raid them was a Level 240 team.

But now, the remnant primordial world was suspected of having a Taboo Boss below Level 240. This was the opportunity of a lifetime.

The Twenty-Two Taboos were one of the main reasons the Holy Race invaded the human race’s Greater God’s Domain in Shi Feng’s previous life. If the Holy Race were to learn that there was a low-level Taboo Boss in this remnant primordial world, they would invade it at all costs. After all, the difficulty of killing a Level 240-plus Taboo Boss was exponentially greater than that of a Taboo Boss under Level 240.

Moreover, every Taboo Boss was unique. They would never respawn once killed, and nobody knew when a new Taboo Boss would be born.

Hence, when Whirlwind Bulwark finished his introduction, Shi Feng promptly had him lead the way to Nightmare Holy City. This was so that Shi Feng could look into the details of the Taboo Boss. Additionally, he also needed to study Nightmare Holy City’s market to find a way to earn Undying Souls quickly. Although the monsters in this world dropped Undying Souls, there was a limit to a six-man party’s capabilities. Even if they were to grind all day, every day, they would not be able to obtain 30 million Undying Souls within a month. They could only obtain such a large sum through Nightmare Holy City’s players.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng agreed to stop window shopping and proceed to their goal, Whirlwind Bulwark and the other Pale Horn members couldn’t help but sigh in relief. Had Shi Feng’s party decided to continue wasting time here, the White Dragon Nation’s experts would definitely catch up to them.

However, an astonishing scene occurred on the main street before they could make their way to Nightmare Holy City’s library.

The bustling street suddenly became devoid of pedestrians, and the restaurants and bars on both sides shuttered. Meanwhile, a large group of players appeared at one end of the street, all wearing the White Dragon Nation’s Guild Emblem.

At a glance, these White Dragon Nation members numbered over 10,000. Moreover, they were all Level 235 and above…

These White Dragon Nation members all exuded intense killing intent, scaring the players who had taken shelter inside the surrounding shops and restaurants. None of these bystanders dared to peek through the windows lest they be mistaken for an accomplice of Shi Feng’s party, only watching the situation through their Magic Mirrors.

“Crap! Did the White Dragon Nation mobilize all its elites?”

“Isn’t the White Dragon Nation overreacting? It’s just one party. Is there a need to mobilize so many people?”

The intimidating scene shocked the bystanders. After all, the White Dragon Nation’s elite experts were Level 235 or higher and equipped with Level 230 Epic Equipment at the very least.

Even experts who had mastered Gold Combat Techniques felt suffocated when looking at this gathering. Moreover, this was when the White Dragon Nation’s members weren’t targeting them specifically. They couldn’t even imagine what it would feel like to be on the receiving end of these elites’ killing intent.

“This… Is the White Dragon Nation crazy?” Whirlwind Bulwark also experienced intense pressure when facing this scene.

Originally, Whirlwind Bulwark thought that the White Dragon Nation would just mobilize one or two thousand experts. After all, Shi Feng’s party only had six members. They weren’t mortal enemies, either. Thus, he had never expected Tyrant Wyvern to come after Shi Feng’s party with an army.

Not even Kowloon Dragon, Nightmare Holy City’s number-one expert, had received such treatment when he provoked the White Dragon Nation in the past. In fact, the White Dragon Nation’s current response was over ten times greater.

However, just as the White Dragon Nation’s elite experts were closing in on Shi Feng, Whirlwind Bulwark, and the others, another army of players appeared at the other end of the street. Although smaller than the White Dragon Nation’s army, this other army still had over 10,000 players, and they all wore the Holy Knights’ Guild Emblem.

Over 20,000 elite experts from two of Nightmare Holy City’s strongest Guilds had gathered on the main street. This was definitely a first in the Holy City.

Subsequently, the Guild Leaders of the two Guilds stepped forward and looked at Shi Feng’s party of six.

“Are you the experts who killed Fira?”

Tyrant Wyvern and Dawn Forest spoke in unison, the scene stunning the eavesdropping bystanders. They had never imagined that the two Guilds’ highest authority would be interested in six players who didn’t even average Level 230.

TL Notes:

[1]elite-level experts: Fyi, elite-level experts (or “elites”) is officially a thing starting from this chapter. Thus far, the author has been rather vague with the term, only using “精锐,” which translates to “elite.” In this chapter, though, the author used “精锐级”高手, which translates to “elite-level/rank” expert. I considered using “first-class” but opted against it since it’d get wordy very quickly.
