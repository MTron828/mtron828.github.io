Chapter 2905 – High Grade Authority

When Weiyang Qianhen finished speaking, both the men tagging along with her and Han Yifeng turned to look at Shi Feng in disbelief.

Weiyang Qianhen’s tone was gentle. Although her words sounded reproachful, they were actually intimate.

Han Yifeng found this situation particularly unbelievable. He looked at Shi Feng as if he was looking at a monster, his mouth nearly failing to close properly.

Weiyang Qianhen currently enjoyed a lofty position in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, far out of even the Five States Corporation’s reach.

Many youths in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone could only dream of getting acquainted with Weiyang Qianhen, let alone having her strike up a conversation with them.

Previously, when Han Yifeng spoke with Shi Feng about Weiyang Qianhen, he thought Shi Feng only knew of the woman’s existence. After all, the Midnight Tea Party was extremely famous in God’s Domain as one of the best adventurer teams in the game. Anyone with a reliable information network in God’s Domain would have heard of it.

Han Yifeng never thought that the two of them were actually acquaintances and shared a good relationship.

Meanwhile, in response to Weiyang Qianhen’s questioning, Shi Feng smiled bitterly and said, “It seems I’ve made a fool of myself in front of Miss Weiyang. However, I was forced by circumstances to hide my true identity back then.”

“You sure know how to act mature,” Weiyang Qianhen said sourly.

Previously, she had thought Shi Feng was older than her, at least in his thirties, which explained how he came to possess such incredible strength.

Afterward, she had constantly thought of surpassing Shi Feng one day, going as far as to leave the Midnight Tea Party for a long period to train like crazy. After all, Shi Feng had given her a lot of surprises during their initial meeting. She never thought a person could become so powerful.

However, just when she thought she was catching up to Shi Feng, she received a shocking piece of news-Black Flame’s true identity was actually that of a young man who wasn’t even 25. Moreover, he was a bona fide self-made expert who didn’t possess the slightest bit of background or expert guidance.

She had fallen into depression for quite some time after learning about this.

Shi Feng laughed blankly at Weiyang Qianhen’s comment. In reality, it wasn’t wrong to say that he was a man in his thirties. After all, he had been one when he reincarnated. “It’s been a while since we met, and it seems you’ve undergone an amazing transformation. You’re now a celebrity in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone.”

“Me? That’s where you are wrong.” Weiyang Qianhen shook her head. She then pointed at the white-clad youth nearby and said, “I’d better introduce you to my senior brother!”

When Weiyang Qianhen said the words “senior brother,” she deliberately emphasized the word “senior,” causing the white-clad youth to smile bitterly before walking over.

“And this is?” When Shi Feng looked at Qin Baiyi, he found the white-clad youth somewhat familiar. He felt as if he had met the other party somewhere before, yet he couldn’t recall where.

“Hello, Guild Leader Black Flame. We meet again,” Qin Baiyi greeted with a smile.

“Again? Have we met before?” Shi Feng grew confused when he saw Qin Baiyi greeting him like an old acquaintance.

“Of course you’ve met! He likes to act mature, exactly like you!” Weiyang Qianhen said as she glared at Qin Baiyi, gritting her teeth slightly. Smiling awkwardly, Qin Baiyi said, “Let me introduce myself. You can call me by my real name, Qin Baiyi. You can also call me by my game ID, Breeze Wine.”

“Breeze Wine! You’re Breeze Wine?!” Shi Feng was startled when he heard Qin Baiyi’s words.

Breeze Wine was the Midnight Tea Party’s commander, someone Shi Feng had met and was relatively familiar with. However, the white-clad youth in front of him had a completely different look and bearing from Breeze Wine’s wildness and boldness.

While Shi Feng was feeling surprised, Han Yifeng, who stood beside him, was deeply shocked.

Qin Baiyi was not only a mental strength master but also the youngest mental strength master in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. Who would’ve thought that a mental strength master was actually the commander of a 20-man adventurer team?

Yet, God’s Domain’s various super-first-rate Guilds and Super Guilds had ignorantly used threats against the Midnight Tea Party to recruit the adventurer team. Those superpowers were simply tired of living.

“Don’t mind it, don’t mind it,” Qin Baiyi said awkwardly when he saw the surprise on Shi Feng’s face. “I wasn’t hiding it. Playing God’s Domain is just one of my hobbies.”

After hearing Qin Baiyi’s introduction, Shi Feng finally understood how Weiyang Qianhen managed to catch the eye of a middle-layer big shot. It was very likely due to Qin Baiyi’s introduction. Shi Feng also understood why the Midnight Tea Party wasn’t afraid of the various superpowers and could continue existing all this time.

With Qin Baiyi’s status, which superpower in God’s Domain would dare offend him?

Seeing Shi Feng in deep thought, Qin Baiyi took the initiative to say, “Guild Leader Black Flame, you and your friends must be here to register your housing status as well, right? We are also here to deal with housing matters. Why don’t we get it done together?” “I’ll be in your care, then,” Shi Feng said, accepting the offer.

There were still a few people lined up, waiting to get their business done in the hall. If Qin Baiyi was willing to help expedite the procedure, it was naturally good news for Shi Feng. After all, the sooner he got Gentle Snow and Aqua Rose into the large mansion, the sooner he could alleviate the stress on their mind.

Naturally, Han Yifeng also didn’t refuse the offer. He wanted nothing more than to establish a connection with Qin Baiyi right now.

Although the Five States Corporation had a solid foundation in the base layer, the influence the corporation held in the Upper Zone was still insignificant compared to Qin Baiyi’s. If Han Yifeng could get acquainted with Qin Baiyi now, he would have an easier time when he entered the middle layer. After all, the middle layer wasn’t an easy place to survive in. The competition there was even fiercer than in the base layer.

Subsequently, the group had all its needs taken care of in less than ten minutes.

When the group arrived at the Green God Tower’s entrance and was about to part ways, a commotion erupted from the street outside. The next moment, a maglev car suddenly descended from the sky and landed in front of the entrance, catching the attention of all the nearby pedestrians.

Although the Upper Zone allowed residents to drive their own cars, that was limited to road use. Cars were prohibited from flying. The only ones allowed to do so were people with very high status in the Upper Zone.

After the maglev car parked in front of the Green God Tower’s entrance, two peopleone young and one old-emerged from it. The young man was none other than Lu Tiandi, Starline Corporation’s current heir. However, Lu Tiandi showed none of his usual arrogance, standing humbly and respectfully behind the black-robed elderly man.

At this old man’s appearance, many of the corporation heirs present gasped reflexively Han Yifeng’s expression even paled when he saw the man.

Why would he come here personally?

Han Yifeng’s eyes were filled with disbelief as he looked at the approaching black-clad elder.

This was because the black-clad old man was none other than the Infinity Master of Haitian City’s Upper Zone, a mental strength master holding Two-star High Grade authority in the Upper Zone.

In the Upper Zone, the Green God Company would award anyone who had become mental strength masters with High Grade authority and permanent residence in the Upper Zone’s middle layer. However, as mental strength masters were not equal, High Grade authority was also categorized into different ranks, from one star to three stars.

Most mental strength masters in the Upper Zone held only One-star High Grade authority, with only a small number holding Two-star High Grade authority. For two-star authority holders, their position in the middle layer rivaled the middle layer’s general manager’s. The Green God Company awarded those who reached two-star authority with one permanent reserve slot for the middle layer and the authority to banish disrespectful mental strength masters from the Upper Zone for a duration of one to three years.

Meanwhile, Han Yifeng knew that the Infinity Master, Fu Jiuzhong, held a slight grudge against Shi Feng. However, in his opinion, someone like Fu Jiuzhong had no reason to take action personally. At most, the Infinity Master would send some of his subordinates to harass Shi Feng. Doing more wouldn’t be befitting of his status.

Yet, contrary to Han Yifeng’s expectations, Fu Jiuzhong had made a personal visit to Yuantian City’s Upper Zone.

After arriving before Shi Feng, Fu Jiuzhong demanded with a lofty aura, “Are you Shi Feng? The one who caused my student, Wang Xuanming, to get kicked out of the Upper Zone.”

When Fu Jiuzhong finished speaking, the surrounding passersby couldn’t help looking at Shi Feng with pity. At the same time, they also wondered who Shi Feng was to warrant the Infinity Master’s direct intervention.

Moreover, based on Fu Jiuzhong’s tone, if this situation wasn’t handled properly, he might very well utilize his authority to banish Shi Feng from the Upper Zone for some time. And once outside the safe zone known as the Upper Zone, Shi Feng was unlikely to keep his life.

At this time, Qin Baiyi stepped forward with a smile and said, “Master Fu, this person here is my friend. Is there perhaps a misunderstanding here?”

“Misunderstanding? I don’t think so.” Glancing at Qin Baiyi, Fu Jiuzhong said, “Also, you’d best not interfere in this matter! I don’t care, even if you have your teacher’s support!”

“Master Fu, although you have Two-star High Grade authority, this is Yuantian City’s Upper Zone!” Qin Baiyi said with a solemn look.

Qin Baiyi felt a little helpless against Fu Jiuzhong right now. He was but an entry mental strength master, no match for a veteran like Fu Jiuzhong. Only his teacher could possibly put up a fight against the Infinity Master. After all, the Two-star High Grade authority wasn’t just a status symbol for a mental strength master; it also symbolized strength. “So what?” Fu Jiuzhong sneered. “Let alone you, even if your teacher personally shows up now, I still won’t give a damn!”

“You!” Qin Baiyi was helpless at the moment.

If Fu Jiuzhong intended to abuse his authority now, Bai Qinyi wouldn’t be able to do anything about it with only his One-star High Grade authority. After all, these were the Green God Company’s rules. As for what kind of excuse Fu Jiuzhong would give to get the Green God Company to banish Shi Feng from the Upper Zone, he could simply trump up random offenses.

However, as Qin Baiyi was thinking of how to buy time and get his teacher to come and help, Shi Feng suddenly stepped forward.

“Wang Xuanming, is it?” Looking at Fu Jiuzhong, Shi Feng responded neither humbly nor arrogantly, “If you’re talking about that home intruder, I am indeed the one who handed him over to the Green God Company. May I know what guidance you have to provide, Master Fu?”
