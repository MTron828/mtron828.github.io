Chapter 612 – Help With Training

Zero Wing Training Center, top floor, Guild Leader’s Office:

Under Gentle Snow’s lead, Mu Huangwu, Xia Qingying, and seventeen youths entered Shi Feng’s office, instantly making the spacious room a little crowded.

Of the seventeen youths following Mu Huangwu and Xia Qingying, four wore suits, looking like bodyguards, while the remaining thirteen wore black sportswear. The youths in sportswear wore the Starry Scythe Emblem, a symbol denoting their official membership with the Night Watch City’s Night Watch Legion.

The seventeen young men and women stood in two rows and wore stern expressions, the uniformity of their actions making them look like trained soldiers. The weakest among them was a two-star grandmaster, while two were even two-star limit grandmasters. Even when these youths were just standing there, Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow couldn’t help but feel a strong pressure coming from them.

Incredible! Sure enough, the Green God Corporation is vastly superior to the average corporation,?Shi Feng inwardly exclaimed after looking at the thirteen youths behind Mu Huangwu and Xia Qingying.

Typically, the young talents nurtured by powers operating in second-tier cities could, at best, become one-star grandmasters before the age of 30. This wasn’t simply due to a lack of talent. It was also due to a lack of resources.

Yet, of the seventeen youths Mu Huangwu and Xia Qingying had brought with them, all of them were under 25. And among the thirteen new faces, one of them, a young man with a short stature and a pretty face, even looked like he was no older than sixteen or seventeen.

When Shi Feng saw the young man, he quickly recognized the other party. The young man was none other than the White Emperor, Azure Shadow.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, Azure Shadow was one of the pseudo-great grandmasters nurtured by Mu Huangwu. At the same time, he was the youngest Taboo under the Green God Corporation’s command. Despite not owning a Divine Artifact, Azure Shadow could exhibit the power of Taboos. During his peak, he even ranked among the Ten Great Rangers of the Greater God’s Domain. At the time, even without Divine Artifacts, he could still rival Ancient Gods. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

According to rumors, if the White Emperor could get his hands on a Divine Artifact, he could even compete for the top three spots among the Ten Great Rangers.

However, following Mu Huangwu’s retirement, Azure Shadow also vanished without a trace, his disappearance becoming a mystery in the Green God Corporation.

After taking a seat, Mu Huangwu got straight to the point and asked, “May I know if our previous discussion of partnership is still valid, Guild Leader Shi?”

“Are you talking about Zero Wing helping the Green God Corporation’s members enter the Night Watch Legion’s ace battle groups?” Shi Feng asked, recalling Xia Qingying’s previous business proposal after hearing Mu Huangwu’s question.

“That’s right.” Mu Huangwu nodded excitedly. Then, he pointed at the seventeen youths behind him and said, “So long as Zero Wing can help the Green God Corporation nurture them and help them join an ace battle group in the Night Watch Legion, I can promise Zero Wing 70% of their city contribution on behalf of the Green God Corporation.”

“You want Zero Wing to train them?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but be a little stunned as he turned to look at the equally stunned youths. “Are you sure you’re not joking with me, Elder Mu?”

The seventeen youths behind Mu Huangwu were the Green God Corporation’s core paragons. Moreover, each of them was a bona fide Tier 6 expert in God’s Domain. They were already regarded as executives in the Green God Corporation, and they were existences standing at the apex of God’s Domain. Yet, Mu Huangwu was offering to let Zero Wing borrow their strength?

Even if it was under the condition of training, it was still a ludicrous offer.

Honestly, if it wasn’t for Mu Huangwu’s unique status, Shi Feng would have instantly written off Mu Huangwu’s words as nonsense. After all, even in the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers, only Guild Leaders and Vice Guild Leaders would have the authority to mobilize such a force. If Xia Qingying, a senior vice president of the Green God Corporation, were to try the same, the seventeen youths wouldn’t have heeded her orders at all, much less go under the wing of another power.

“I’m not joking,” Mu Huangwu stated definitively. “I have brought them all up from when they were still children. If any of them dare disobey your arrangements, just tell me, and I’ll teach them a lesson!”

Hearing Mu Huangwu’s words, the seventeen youths shuddered and quickly retracted whatever words they originally intended to say.

Meanwhile, Xia Qingying couldn’t help but look at Mu Huangwu in disbelief. Originally, she thought Mu Huangwu had only come to agree to Shi Feng’s conditions and have Shi Feng assist these seventeen youths in getting into the Night Watch Legion’s ace battle groups. She never imagined Mu Huangwu would leave the training of these youths to Shi Feng.

It should be known that these youths were paragons that the Green God Corporation had nurtured with the intention of sending them into conglomerates or pseudo-apex powers. They were meant to pave a smoother path for the Green God Corporation in the future. It was why the Green God Corporation had invested so heavily in developing these youths. Even if these youths failed to become core executives in the corporations or pseudo-apex powers they had joined, they would still become existences wielding a certain degree of authority.

Yet, Mu Huangwu was offering to let Zero Wing, or more specifically, Shi Feng, instruct these youths.

So long as this deal went through, these youths would effectively owe Shi Feng a favor. In that case, should Shi Feng encounter any trouble and require assistance in the future, he could call upon these youths, and they would be obligated to help him, lest they wish to be known as ungrateful.

“If you truly wish for Zero Wing to train them, we can do that for you, Elder Mu,” Shi Feng answered. Then, he calmly looked toward the two rows of youths and continued, “But Zero Wing has a condition.”

Following Shi Feng’s words, the seventeen youths present couldn’t help but cast a contemptuous look toward him.

They would only be training under Zero Wing for several days. There was no way they could achieve any improvements in such a short time. This was simply a way for Mu Huangwu to sell Shi Feng a favor. Under such circumstances, Shi Feng should already be thanking his lucky stars if they were even willing to listen to his commands. Yet, despite being offered such a generous deal, Shi Feng still dared to ask for more.

“Feel free to state your condition, Guild Leader Shi.” Mu Huangwu did not get angry at Shi Feng’s words. On the contrary, he smiled and said, “Not to mention one condition, even ten conditions wouldn’t be a problem.”

“Elder Mu?” Azure Shadow couldn’t help but look toward Mu Huangwu anxiously.

After all was said and done, the seventeen of them were all Tier 6 players. Moreover, they were either pseudo-fifth-floor experts or experts who had mastered Saint-ranked Mana Techniques. Even alone, each of them could put up a good fight against fifth-floor experts.

Not to mention, they were all equipped with Legendary Weapons. In terms of combat power, they already stood at the apex of God’s Domain. Moreover, as individuals who had become two-star grandmasters at such a young age, they had a limitless future ahead of them.

Yet, Mu Huangwu was now making it seem as if they were the lucky ones for being able to train under Zero Wing.

However, Mu Huangwu did not offer any explanations and simply sent a sharp glare at Azure Shadow, causing the youth to keep quiet.

“You jest, Elder Mu.” Nonchalantly, Shi Feng said, “I only need them to sign a God’s Domain Contract promising lifetime confidentiality and pay a training fee of ten God Crystals per person.”
