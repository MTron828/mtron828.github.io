Chapter 363 – Legendary Weapon’s Hidden Effect

“Tier 5!”

“He became Tier 5 as well!”

Shi Feng’s astonishing transformation caused everyone present to mistakenly assume that he had similarly used some special means to promote himself into a Tier 5 Sword Saint. Or more specifically, aside from Shi Feng becoming Tier 5, they couldn’t think of any other reason that could allow Shi Feng to undergo such a massive transformation.

“Guild Leader!”

!!

Wu Xiaoxiao and Midsummer grew ecstatic when they saw Shi Feng’s mana seething.

Shi Feng might have had a hard time going up against three Tier 5 players as a Tier 4 player with Tier 5 standards, but it was a different story now if he had similarly become Tier 5. Now, he would have a fighting chance.

“So what if you got promoted to Tier 5?’ Iron Crocodile said. Although he didn’t expect Shi Feng’s sudden transformation, he remained calm even when he realized Shi Feng might have gotten promoted to Tier 5. “Do you think you can defend against all three of us together?”

The Grand Wizard and Brilliant Cleric Saint nodded in agreement.

Shi Feng’s strength might have exceeded their expectations, but they still outnumbered him by three to one. Moreover, they had an MT, a healer, and a DPS on their side; they could tank, heal, and do damage. They could even take down a Tier 5 Legendary Boss if they wanted to, let alone a Tier 5 player.

While Iron Crocodile was buying time for the magic arrays in the air to finish forming, Shi Feng suddenly swung the Winter of Eternal Night at the magic arrays.

Bang… Bang… Bang…

Immediately, the mana in the several dozen magic arrays froze, leading to the magic arrays crumbling apart one after another.

“A silencing effect?” When Iron Crocodile saw the magic arrays breaking apart, he started eyeing Shi Feng with more wariness.

The silencing effect was a powerful weapon in God’s Domain. Not only could it put magical classes into despair but also physical classes. This was because players subjected to a silencing effect would be prohibited from using Skills and Spells, putting them at a considerable disadvantage in battle.

“No, this isn’t a silencing effect!” the Grand Wizard denied, shaking her head. Then, with a fearful look, she said, “This is Mana Freezing!”

“Mana Freezing?” When Iron Crocodile heard the Grand Wizard’s statement, he couldn’t help but ask, “Are you sure you’re not mistaken?”

In God’s Domain, the Silence and Mana Freezing effects might look similar on the surface, but the two’s power was worlds apart.

Silence only prevented players from using Skills and Spells, but Mana Freezing not only prevented players from using Skills and Spells normally but also combat techniques and Mana Techniques.

“I won’t be mistaken,” the Grand Wizard said definitively. “Mana will stop flowing under the Mana Freezing effect. If you don’t believe me, you can try to manipulate the mana around you.”

However, before Iron Crocodile could try what the Grand Wizard suggested, Shi Feng suddenly appeared before Iron Crocodile and swung the Winter of Eternal Night at him, the slash creating a huge tear in space.

Iron Crocodile reacted to the attack extremely quickly, his hand spontaneously lifting his shield to defend himself.

Boom!

A loud explosion shook the entire Thunder Restaurant, followed by Iron Crocodile getting sent flying into a wall. Then, before anyone could react to the situation, Iron Crocodile suddenly shouted:

“Retreat!”

It was a word that shouldn’t have emerged from Iron Crocodile’s mouth. Yet, not only did it come out of the Sacred Sky Knight’s mouth, but it had also echoed loudly throughout the room and in everyone’s ears.

Meanwhile, upon hearing these words, the eyes of the spectators in the room nearly bulged.

This must be a lie!

Thousand Scars couldn’t believe her eyes as she stared at Iron Crocodile, who was embedded in the distant wall. Or, more specifically, the bisected shield in Iron Crocodile’s left hand.

One strike!

With just one simple strike that didn’t employ any techniques, Shi Feng had cut apart Iron Crocodile’s Epic Shield. Not even Legendary World Bosses of the same level could accomplish such a feat, especially not when the person wielding the Epic Shield was a Tier 5 Sacred Sky Knight!

Even though Shi Feng’s attack had taken less than 10% of Iron Crocodile’s HP, an indescribable sense of fear still assaulted the hearts of everyone present.

At this moment, even Dira, who had remained calm and composed all this time, started to waver a little.

“So this is the case! No wonder Leroja and Cross lost to him!” When Trecht saw the clean cut through Iron Crocodile’s bisected shield, bitterness and jealousy instantly colored his face.

Only one thing could cut apart an Epic Shield so cleanly and effortlessly.

It was also why Iron Crocodile and the others reacted so fearfully.

A Legendary Weapon!

Only weapons at the Legendary rank or above could destroy an Epic Shield in one hit.

Every Legendary Weapon possessed devastating might. With the help of a Legendary Weapon, even challenging Tier 6 players as a Tier 5 player would be possible, let alone challenging Tier 5 players as a Tier 4 player.

It should be known that the gap between Tier 5 and Tier 6 was vastly bigger than between Tier 4 and Tier 5. It was so big that even a piece of Legendary Equipment couldn’t mitigate the difference.

Yet, Legendary Weapons could do so, which was also what made Legendary Weapons so frightening and precious.

Because of how powerful Legendary Weapons were, it was publicly acknowledged in the Greater God’s Domain that so long as a Tier 4 player wielded a Legendary Weapon, this player would be nigh-invincible even among Tier 5 players. Unless a Tier 5 player was clad in a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set and wielded a Fragmented Legendary Weapon, they couldn’t even hold their ground against such a Tier 4 player.

So, even though the three Beast Warriors still outnumbered Shi Feng, it probably wouldn’t take Shi Feng more than a few attacks to thoroughly destroy all of their weapons and equipment.

“Croc, we’ll leave him to you!”

After exchanging looks with each other, the Grand Wizard and Brilliant Cleric Saint turned around and ran to Dira in a panic.

Different from an amateur like Trecht, they were Tier 6 experts who had worked under the Paimon Conglomerate for many years already. So, the information they knew about God’s Domain far exceeded Trecht’s knowledge of the game.

If Shi Feng merely had the ability to destroy Epic Weapons and Equipment, they wouldn’t have feared him at all. At worst, they’d die. As Dira’s guards, they had long since grown accustomed to dying.

What made them truly afraid weren’t the Basic Attribute bonuses Shi Feng received from his Legendary Weapon. Instead, it was the hidden effect commonly shared by Legendary Weapons.

Soul Annihilation!

There weren’t many things in God’s Domain that could completely destroy a player’s Immortal Soul. Unfortunately, Legendary Weapons just so happened to be one of those things.

“Don’t you think it’s a little too late to be leaving now?”

After glancing at the two people running to Dira, Shi Feng indifferently raised the Legendary-ranked Winter of Eternal Night and lightly swung it in Dira’s direction.

Suddenly, space in the room stagnated, and everyone found themselves incapable of moving. The only thing they could do was watch as a dark sword light cut across the room, erasing everything in its path.
