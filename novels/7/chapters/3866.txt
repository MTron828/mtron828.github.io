Chapter 3867 - 941 - Four Royals

TL Notes:
Made a change to Chapters 825 and 826:

The gnome youth’s “Peak Gold Fusion Technique” changed to “Twofold Peak Gold Fusion Technique.”

“Madness! This is madness!”

“Is the Thunder Empire out of its mind?! An Epic Siege Weapon?!”

“An Epic Siege Weapon?! Is the Thunder Empire trying to erase the entire Everlasting City?!”

“Is this necessary? All this just because Garuda got killed once?”

When the spectating players and powers saw the iron palace, they dared not believe their eyes.

A Siege Weapon!

This was a weapon created to attack cities inhabited by Gods in the Primordial Era. Theoretically, it could concentrate the power of all its operators to launch attacks exceeding the Tier 6 Limit standard.

Even a Common-ranked Siege Weapon was worth multiple Holy Cities, let alone an Epic-ranked Siege Weapon. The higher a Siege Weapon’s rank, the more comprehensive its abilities. A high-rank Siege Weapon could also accommodate more operators, allowing it to harness and exhibit greater power.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Once a Siege Weapon reached the Epic rank, it could theoretically destroy an entire Realm with one strike. It was not a weapon that could be countered with manpower alone. It was also a weapon exclusive to royal powers. More specifically, only powers with an Epic Siege Weapon could become royal powers.

As for the iron palace, it was called the Lightning Nation, and it was one of the Thunder Empire’s three Epic Siege Weapons!

…

“The Thunder Empire must be crazy! Does it need to bring out the Lightning Nation just to deal with two pseudo-apex powers?! Isn’t it worried that other royal powers will use this opportunity to attack its Realms?!” Verdant Rainbow was confused and shocked as she stared at the iron palace in the Magic Mirror.

Siege Weapons were the most crucial trump cards for any power. They were mighty weapons that could safeguard an entire Realm. However, the cost of mobilizing a Siege Weapon was mind-boggling. Even if the average upper-ranking hegemonic power got their hands on a Siege Weapon, it’d be too poor to deploy the weapon.

Most importantly, players still lacked the know-how to reproduce and repair Siege Weapons to this day, as the technology had been lost since the Primordial Era. Hence, Siege Weapons were essentially irreplaceable consumable items, and powers that owned them would never deploy these strategic tools under any circumstances outside existential threats. This was especially so when it came to Epic Siege Weapons.

While Verdant Rainbow thought that the Thunder Empire was making a mountain out of a molehill, space-time passages appeared in the three other cardinal directions of Plot 079.

The experts that emerged from these space-time passages all wore Guild Emblems of royal powers. These royal powers were Evil Nature, the Sun Dynasty, and the Crystallian race’s Ninth Street.

Each of these royal powers had not only mobilized over 10,000 experts but had also brought Epic Siege Weapons of their own.

All of a sudden, a four-way face-off involving four Epic Siege Weapons was taking place above Plot 079. One of these Siege Weapons was as bright as the sun, one was wreathed in crimson flames, one was shrouded by thundering clouds, and one was surrounded by a galaxy of stars. It was as if four starkly different worlds were facing off in the sky. They radiated overbearing auras that covered tens of thousands of yards and suffocated many Tier 6 players.

“Parting Forest, is such an overreaction necessary? Garuda didn’t even suffer a true death,” a short-haired Crystallian woman in her early 30s and wearing a golden robe scoffed at the stalwart, middle-aged man in charge of the Thunder Empire’s army.

“It might not have been a true death, but the soul damage he suffered will stifle his development for a considerable period. I’m sure you don’t need me to explain the consequences this would have in the ever-changing Eternal Realm, right? Of course, you might not think much of it since he isn’t your race’s chosen one,” the four-armed, middle-aged man named Parting Forest said, unfazed by the Crystallian woman’s taunt. “Jade Hunter, if Ninth Street insists on protecting her, I advise you to abandon the idea! The Thunder Empire will claim her life!”

The Crystallian woman named Jade Hunter did not try to continue her conversation with Parting Forest. Instead, she turned to the leaders of the two other royal powers and asked, “Do the Sun Dynasty and Evil Nature share the same opinion?”

“No, no. You’ve misunderstood our intentions, Miss Jade Hunter,” Slumbering Vocalist, the leader of Evil Nature’s army, said with a smile. “Evil Nature is only here for the tokens. So long as Miss Ink Crystal surrenders all her tokens, Evil Nature will leave immediately.”

Following Slumbering Vocalist, Daystar, the leader of the Sun Dynasty’s army, turned to Lunar River and said, “Since Evil Nature wants Miss Ink Crystal’s tokens, the Sun Dynasty will have Miss Lunar River’s tokens. The Sun Dynasty will keep its hands clean of any other matters.”

Jade Hunter sighed at Slumbering Vocalist’s and Daystar’s responses. Then, she turned to Ink Crystal and said, “Miss Ink Crystal, as you can see, I’m afraid you can only count yourself unlucky. If you do not want to die, surrender your tokens now. As for the Thunder Empire, I will help you stop it.”

“Jade Hunter! Do not stick your nose where it doesn’t belong!” Parting Forest glared at Jade Hunter. “Have you forgotten that Ninth Street has yet to establish a foothold on the Eternal Continent? If you insist on offending the Thunder Empire, Ninth Street can forget about gaining a foothold there!”

Jade Hunter’s expression darkened at Parting Hunter’s threat. She hadn’t expected the Thunder Empire to take Garuda’s death so seriously that it would refuse to show Ninth Street any respect.

“Siege Weapons, huh?” As Ink Crystal observed the four Siege Weapons hovering around her, enthusiasm colored her eyes rather than fear. “Although I’ve heard a lot about these things from those old fellows, I’ve never seen one in person before. Let me see how strong the royal powers’ prided Epic Siege Weapons are!”

After saying so, Ink Crystal set her sights on the Thunder Empire’s Lightning Nation, getting ready to fight it. Upon seeing this, Lunar River quietly stood aside to watch, showing no intentions of running away. She behaved as if her turn was next after Ink Crystal.

“Are those two crazy? Epic Siege Weapons are among the strongest trump cards the royal powers possess! Are they really standing their ground?”

Many of the spectating players were shocked to see Ink Crystal and Lunar River standing their ground against four Epic Siege Weapons.

If this was merely a clash between players, they wouldn’t have been as surprised to see Ink Crystal and Lunar River stand their ground. After all, Ink Crystal was a Mortal God, while Lunar River was an expert who could match Ink Crystal. They were both powerhouses who could solo entire legions.

However, Ink Crystal and Lunar River’s opponents were not players but Siege Weapons. Siege Weapons were akin to myths in God’s Domain. Epic Siege Weapons, in particular, were the lifeblood of royal powers. A royal power would never deploy its Epic Siege Weapons for anything less than an existential crisis. This was also why few people were aware of the might of Epic Siege Weapons; they only knew that they could not fight these weapons.

Of course, due to how rarely Epic Siege Weapons were put into action, anyone who said they weren’t interested in watching Ink Crystal and Lunar River fight an Epic Siege Weapon would be lying.

“Since you want to fight, I’ll grant your wish!”

When Parting Forest saw that Ink Crystal was eager for a fight, he commanded the players operating the Lightning Nation to attack her.

Immediately, the iron palace controlled by a thousand fifth-floor experts launched a thousand bolts of Lightning of Destruction at Ink Crystal, each bolt carrying power at the Tier 6 Limit standard. The momentum and might of the attack terrified the players who had never seen a Siege Weapon in action. They never thought that an Epic Siege Weapon could be this powerful. It was as if a thousand experts had attacked with Peak Gold-ranked techniques simultaneously. This simply wasn’t a force that a single player could fight.
