Chapter 2627 – Shi Feng’s Sword

Upon seeing Shi Feng charging toward the two distant behemoths, Crimson Star and Wildfighter turned pale.

“He’s insane!” Crimson Star cursed when she saw that Shi Feng had already gotten over 100 yards away. Immediately, she turned to the rest of the team and ordered, “Everyone, retreat together with Floating Light! Do not stop for anything! Retreat to Violet Light City! Wildfighter, hold the rear with me!”

“Got it!” Wildfighter responded and unsheathed his weapon, a solemn expression appearing on his face.

In this situation, Violet Sword’s members could not help growing nervous.

As for Sandstorm and the other members of Mythology spectating from a distance, their eyes nearly fell out of their sockets when they saw Shi Feng’s actions.

“That crazy Black Flame! He’s actually charging to the two Region Chiefs!” Sandstorm cursed. Then, he commanded hastily, “Hurry! Retreat quickly!”

As soon as Sandstorm finished speaking, Mythology’s members, who had been preparing to retreat from the area already, picked up their pace with serious expressions.

“Black Flame truly is insane. He’s actually planning to drag everyone down with him! Did Violet Sword’s people not warn him about the Region Chiefs here?” the tall, female Guardian Knight grumbled, similarly cursing at Shi Feng as she jumped down from the tree she had been standing on.

The Region Chiefs of the ancient secret land were considerably stronger than Mythic monsters found in the outside world. In terms of Strength and speed, they were at least 30% better. Trying to take on just one of these Region Chiefs with a 200-man, Tier 3 team was already an incredibly difficult task, incurring plenty of casualties. When coupled with the endless stream of other monsters that would continuously join in on the battle, any team that tried to challenge a Region Chief was doomed.

However, what made the ancient secret land’s Region Chiefs truly difficult to deal with wasn’t their physical prowess but their massive perception range. When these Region Chiefs fought players, they could manipulate all the Mana within a 5,000-yard radius, relying on this Mana to detect all movements within range.

One could say that, so long as there were players within a Region Chief’s passive perception range of 500 yards or players fighting a Region Chief, then all players within a 5,000-yard radius of the Region Chief would become its targets.

If players failed to kill the aggravated Region Chief, then they wouldn’t be able to shake off its pursuit. This was also the reason why Mythology and Violet Sword had labeled the Mythic Bosses in the ancient secret land Region Chiefs.

Normally, teams that accidentally came across a Region Chief were still fine. The majority of the team’s members had a chance to escape with their lives. However, only annihilation awaited teams that came across two Region Chiefs simultaneously.

Even before the female Guardian Knight finished speaking, Mythology’s members had already turned tail and run.

However, after everyone had taken just a few strides, the Mana around them suddenly stirred. At the same time, they felt as if a pair of eyes were looking down on them. Obviously, the two Region Chiefs had already locked on to their life auras.

“Damn it! Everyone, split up and retreat! Every survivor counts!” Sandstorm yelled. When he looked at Shi Feng’s distant figure, he felt himself going crazy. For a moment, he even suspected that Shi Feng had deliberately provoked the two Region Chiefs.

Meanwhile, when Crimson Star and the others saw the two Region Chiefs suddenly stop fighting and rapidly head in their direction, their complexions darkened. If they could not put a 5,000-yard distance between themselves and the two Bosses, they had no hope of escaping the battle at all.

A 5,000-yard distance!

Even Tier 3 experts like themselves would still take quite some time to cover 5,000 yards. To make matters worse, tools were ineffective inside the ancient secret land, so they couldn’t teleport away or accelerate their retreat from the battlefield.

“Crazy bastard! He’s going to get us all killed!” Floating Light, who was already retreating, cursed when he felt the two Region Chiefs locking on to his life aura.

Although players wouldn’t lose an entire level from dying inside the ancient secret land, the amount of EXP lost was still not a trivial matter. After all, at their level, just leveling up once took a lot of time. Hence, even a small percentage of their EXP equaled one or two days’ worth of hard work.

As Floating Light was leading the retreat of Violet Sword’s members, he suddenly noticed something: Zero Wing’s and Azure’s members were actually still standing in their original positions. It was as if they had not heard Crimson Star’s orders at all.

“What are they doing? Are they planning to die with Black Flame?” Floating Light was baffled as he looked at Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Setting the others aside, it was incredibly strange for Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian to defy Crimson Star. After all, the two of them were geniuses that had trained under Crimson Star during their sojourn at Violet Sword. The two of them knew very clearly how powerful and capable Crimson Star was.

Crimson Star’s calling for a retreat showed just how dangerous their current situation was, yet Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian had actually disobeyed her command and remained where they were. Moreover, they wore indescribably calm expressions, their reactions making it seem as if nothing was happening.

“Vice Commander, let’s quickly retreat. This is Zero Wing and Azure’s matter. Instructor Crimson Star and Instructor Wildfighter won’t be able to hold off those two Region Chiefs for very long,” a retreating Tier 3 Assassin urged hurriedly when he noticed Floating Light pause.

“I guess you’re right,” Floating Light said, nodding before resuming his retreat. At the same time, he could not help glancing at Solitary Frost and Yan Xiaoqian with pity.

Originally, with Solitary Frost’s and Yan Xiaoqian’s talents, they should’ve been able to shine brightly in God’s Domain. However, their futures were now ruined because they belonged to a Guild like the Azure Chamber of Commerce and followed an unreliable team leader like Shi Feng.

However, Floating Light had just taken a few steps forward when the deafening roar of a bear came from behind him and echoed throughout the forest, causing it to tremble. Immediately afterward, a beam of Mana shot past the area beside Floating Light’s group, leaving behind a massive trench on the ground it passed through. Seen from afar, the ground looked like pudding that a spoon had scraped.

“The fight started?” Floating Light’s complexion further darkened as he took in the massive trench a short distance away.

This was the power of the ancient secret land’s Mythic monsters. Any random attack of theirs could transform the terrain around them. Let alone one person, even a 100-man, Tier 3 expert team would be cannon fodder in front of these Region Chiefs.

If one really wished to take on a Region Chief, they would need a 200-man team of Tier 3 peak experts at the very minimum. Moreover, the team would need two or three Domain Realm MTs working together to tank the Region Chief. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to stop the Boss’s attacks adequately. In fact, even a single mistake might result in a team-wipe.

After Floating Light’s group ran for another 50 yards or so, a lightning bolt suddenly shot past them some distance away, followed by the ear-splitting crack of thunder. As the thunder faded, the sky above them darkened abruptly.

In the next moment, the 200-meter-tall, six-eyed gorilla went flying overhead and crashed heavily into the ground a few hundred yards ahead of them, the ground shattering at the impact. As for the giant gorilla, it stumbled quite a bit as it landed and very nearly lost its footing. After stabilizing itself, the gorilla glared into the distance before releasing a deafening roar. It then charged forward, completely ignoring Floating Light and the other members of Violet Sword, who stood only a short distance away from it.

“This... What is going on?” Floating Light was confounded by this situation.

Violet Sword’s other peak experts similarly could not help rubbing their eyes, thinking that they were hallucinating. However, no matter how much they rubbed, the several massive craters the six-eyed gorilla’s feet left behind did not disappear.

Before Floating Light and the others could react to this unexpected development, though, another deafening boom and the snapping of trees entered their ears. However, these sounds came from quite a distance away. There should still be some separation between the origin of these sounds and the six-eyed gorilla that had just charged past them.

Floating Light and the others turn around reflexively, looking for the origin of these sounds.

They spotted a cloaked man wielding two longswords standing atop a tree. Meanwhile, some distance away from this Swordsman was a gigantic bear that had just steadied itself, glaring hatefully at him. The six-eyed gorilla was also stalking toward this man, seemingly searching for an opportunity to strike at him.

However, Floating Light and the others could also see a hint of fear in the one-horned bear’s and six-eyed gorilla’s eyes. It was clear that the two Region Chiefs were afraid of the tiny human on the tree.
