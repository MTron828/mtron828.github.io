Chapter 386 – Shi Feng’s Secret

Storm?

Saint Arm fell into a daze when he saw Storm getting vaporized.

In terms of combat standards, Storm was not at all inferior to him. When it came to lifesaving measures, Storm even had the upper hand. After all, as an Elementalist, it would be fatal for her if her opponents managed to get within melee range, so it was only natural she placed more focus on gathering lifesaving measures.

Meanwhile, combined with her sixth sense, so long as Storm focused on fleeing, not even White Owl could kill her.

!!

Yet, now, Storm had died. Moreover, she had died at the hands of her own Thunder Realm’s Descent…

What did he do?

Meteor and the other Tier 4 spectators were confused and horrified as they looked at Shi Feng’s figure inside the barrier, none of them able to understand what had just happened.

The Tier 5 Curse clearly originated from Storm. Yet, the Curse not only refused to obey Storm, but it even turned around to kill Storm. This situation completely exceeded their understanding of God’s Domain.

“Everyone, retreat!”

While everyone was in a panic, White Owl suddenly issued a retreat order through the team chat.

“Commander Owl, this is the Void Saint Legacy we are talking about! Dira hurriedly said when he heard White Owl’s call for retreat. “We might never come across another opportunity like this if we miss it!”

The Void Saint class was a stepping stone into the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Senate. Not even apex powers would be willing to abandon such an opportunity, let alone the Paimon Conglomerate.

“If you wish to suffer Soul Annihilation, be my guest,” White Owl curtly said before taking out a Group Teleportation Crystal and enveloping everyone on her team in a teleportation array. At the same time, everyone in the teleportation array received a prompt asking them whether they agreed to get teleported.

“Dammit!”

Dira reluctantly looked at the nearby town before gnashing his teeth and agreeing to the teleportation.

Immediately, White Owl and the others vanished into thin air, leaving only Shi Feng and Laura on the floating island.

“They sure didn’t take their time leaving,” Laura remarked as she watched White Owl’s team teleporting away. However, she did not bother chasing after them, opting to sheath her sword instead.

A Group Teleportation Crystal could teleport everyone on the same team together. It was a rare and precious tool that was valued at 5,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal in the Greater God’s Domain, and they were usually treated as strategic items by the various powers.

Although the floating island’s barrier prevented players from directly teleporting out of the island, it was still possible to teleport to the barrier’s edge. There was quite some distance between her current location and the barrier’s edge, so unless she employed the help of teleportation magic as well, there was no way she could catch up to them.

“It’s a good thing that they’ve left,” Shi Feng said, wryly smiling when he saw that Laura still wanted to fight. “I can only fight them for a short time. Had the battle dragged on for a little longer, I would have most likely had to flee.”

Shi Feng could only make use of Thunder Realm’s Descent once. After all, he had already eliminated Storm, the source of the combination attack.

Meanwhile, without Thunder Realm’s Descent or an attack of a similar caliber, there was no way Shi Feng could kill Saint Arm. At best, he could hold his ground against the Time Guardian.

After all, a Legendary Weapon might grant its wielder the strength to transcend tiers, but the precondition was that the opponent wasn’t equipped with a Legendary Weapon or Equipment. Meanwhile, Saint Arm obviously wasn’t part of this category of opponents.

Moreover, apart from the Legendary-rank Winter of Eternal Night, another reason Shi Feng could match Saint Arm was because of his level of 155. That put him 15 levels above Saint Arm. If Shi Feng was only at Level 140, he would have definitely been put at a disadvantage against Saint Arm.

Hence, had the battle dragged on until Ancient Dragon’s Power’s duration ran out, Shi Feng would have to either flee or get killed by Saint Arm.

“But I have to say, what you did just now was truly incredible. Could you perhaps be that Ye Feng who recently became a Great Grandmaster Magician?” Laura asked as she looked at Shi Feng suspiciously. “It is almost impossible to take over someone else’s magic in God’s Domain. Unless, of course, you managed to grasp all of the magic arrays in that woman’s Mana Body. But that evidently isn’t feasible. Besides that, the only other method I can think of is if you manipulated that woman’s mana through her magic barrier.”

Previously, Storm had cast her Curse via her magic barrier so as to strengthen its output. Hence, so long as Shi Feng could take control of Storm’s magic barrier, he would gain control over her Curse.

However, that was easier said than done.

Taking over another person’s magic barrier was an incredibly challenging and time-consuming feat, as one would have to discern the mana nodes in the other person’s magic barrier. On top of that, one would need to have control over mana that was superior to the barrier’s creator so that one could win control over these mana nodes.

It should be known that Storm was a Grandmaster Magician. So, the fact that Shi Feng had not only managed to take control of Storm’s magic barrier but also accomplished it in such a short time was simply unbelievable. Apart from Shi Feng being a Great Grandmaster Magician, Laura truly couldn’t think of any other explanations for this situation.

Meanwhile, although Great Grandmaster Magicians were exceedingly rare in the Greater God’s Domain, it just so happened that a new one had appeared not long ago. Linking these two events together, Laura couldn’t help but overthink matters.

“You’ve guessed correctly, Commander Laura,” Shi Feng said, openly admitting to Laura’s suspicion. Then, he chuckled and added, “But please keep this a secret.”

Others might not be able to link him with Ye Feng, but it wasn’t a difficult thing for Laura to guess the connection. After all, Laura was aware of his ability to freely travel between worlds. Moreover, the timing of his recent trip to the Greater God’s Domain coincided with his becoming a Great Grandmaster Magician.

“Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone about it,” Laura said. Then, she grinned and continued, “But if the Divine Seal Saint were to find out that you’re that Ye Feng, he’ll probably lose his mind.”

The ultimate goal of the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers was to explore the Void Zones situated in the gaps between Realms. Meanwhile, exploring these Void Zones necessitated the construction of bases. However, unless a stronghold was protected by a Great Grandmaster Defensive Magic Array, it would need a large amount of manpower to keep it standing in the Void Zone.

This led to a situation where Great Grandmaster Defensive Magic Arrays were in high demand. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, there were far too few Great Grandmaster Magicians in existence. In the current era, there didn’t even exist 100 Great Grandmaster Magicians across the entire Greater God’s Domain. In other words, there were more Realms than there were Great Grandmaster Magicians. Moreover, most of these Great Grandmaster Magicians were gathered in the Twelve Sanctuaries, leaving even fewer Greater Grandmaster Magicians for the other Realms.

To make matters worse, these Great Grandmaster Magicians needed a lot of time to produce even one Great Grandmaster Defensive Magic Array.

Because of this, even if a power was willing to pay an exorbitant price to hire the services of a Great Grandmaster Magician, it would need to make a reservation for several decades later.

“Anyway, we can’t defend this place for much longer. The forces the Divine Seal Saint dispatched shouldn’t be limited to just White Owl’s group of three. Those three must have used some special means to reach this place ahead of the main army. Once the Divine Seal Saint’s army of experts arrives, even escaping will be a challenging task for us,” Laura said, feeling a little worried.

The strength of the experts the Divine Seal Saint dispatched had exceeded Laura’s expectations. If she had to fight against White Owl, she could only afford to take on a few more Tier 5 experts.

However, the Divine Seal Saint had dispatched thousands of Tier 4 experts, and many among them would complete their Tier 5 promotion as soon as they entered the World Passage. If this army of Tier 5 experts arrived, she could, at best, flee with several people. It’d be impossible for her to escape with all of Zero Wing’s members.

“You don’t have to worry about this, Commander Laura. So long as we can defend this place until the others return from their trials, I am confident in bringing everyone away safely,” Shi Feng confidently said.

From what Shi Feng learned during his previous life, the Void Gods’ settlements relied on divine seals created by Ancient Gods to imprison dangerous Demigods. So long as he could release these imprisoned Demigods and create some chaos, it should be easy for him and his team to escape the Divine Seal Saint’s army.

If Shi Feng was still only a Grandmaster Magician, he would have had a hard time undoing these divine seals. However, now that he had become a Great Grandmaster Magician, these divine seals were not a problem for him. It was only a question of whether he was willing to invest the time to undo these seals.

Before Shi Feng set off in search of the sealing grounds, he waved his hand at the item Storm dropped when she died, causing the item to fly into his hand.

If this was an item dropped by any other player, Shi Feng might not have been particularly interested in it. However, Storm was a core paragon of the Paimon Conglomerate. Every item she carried with her would be incredibly valuable, so he naturally couldn’t ignore it.

Meanwhile, after taking a look at the light-purple metal piece in his hand, Shi Feng couldn’t help but be rendered speechless.

Is Paimon so rich that it can afford to give away even things like this?
