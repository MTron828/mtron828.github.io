Chapter 2733 – Garrisoning Twin Towers

Vico, the Level 180, Tier 3 male administrator, looked at the certificate in Shi Feng’s hand and carefully inspected it.

“Yes, this is indeed an Official Guild Certificate from the War God’s Temple.” Vico nodded, his gaze turning respectful as he looked at Shi Feng. He then added slowly, “Lord Guild Leader, there is nothing wrong with your Guild Certificate. However, I’m afraid that as an ordinary Guild, your Guild does not qualify to garrison our kingdom’s capital. You can only choose to garrison another of the Twin Towers Kingdom’s cities.”

Sure enough, the Guild still can’t garrison the capital city. Shi Feng was not particularly surprised by Vico’s rejection. “Since that’s the case, Zero Wing will garrison Sky Spring City.” Although the War God’s Temple now recognized Zero Wing as an official Guild in God’s Domain, that was only recognition and nothing more. Initially, Shi Feng thought that with the deterioration of the Twin Towers Kingdom due to the abyssal monsters, Zero Wing might have a chance to garrison its capital.

However, it would seem that he had still underestimated the Twin Towers Kingdom.

After thinking it through, though, he found this situation reasonable. In his previous life, the Twin Towers Kingdom had shone brightly on the continent of God’s Domain, thanks to the Tower of Time and Secret Covenant Tower it housed. It had been a kingdom that stood far above other kingdoms.

Moreover, while the Twin Towers Kingdom might currently look battered, now that the first major update had taken place, NPCs would start appearing in large numbers across the kingdom. Once that happened, it was only a matter of time before the NPCs turned the tables on the abyssal monsters. Otherwise, Shi Feng wouldn’t have rushed to have Zero Wing garrison the Twin Towers Kingdom.

“That won’t be a problem. Please follow me. I will conduct the procedures for you,” Vico said and led Shi Feng to the third-floor hall.

On his way to the third floor, Shi Feng noticed that the number of NPCs inside the City Hall had increased significantly.

Previously, it was rare to see even one Tier 3 NPC in a City Hall. Now, he spotted at least a dozen. Moreover, even the weakest of them was at Level 140, while the strongest reached Level 182. They were not existences current Tier 3 players could hope to contend against.

Through this, he could already anticipate a large batch of Tier 3 NPCs appearing inside the Twin Towers Kingdom in the near future. With the combat power of these NPCs, retaking the Twin Towers Kingdom and driving the abyssal monsters back into the abyss would be entirely possible.

Meanwhile, the Sky Spring City he chose to have Zero Wing garrison was the closest NPC city to the Secret Covenant Tower.

Although Sky Spring City didn’t even rank within the top 15 of the Twin Towers Kingdom’s NPC cities, after the first major update, the Secret Covenant Tower would become more attractive than the Tower of Time.

This was because the Secret Covenant Tower was a holy land for grinding for levels and acquiring Guild resources.

Before God’s Domain’s first major update took place, grinding for levels was a daily chore for players. However, after the first major update, grinding for levels would become deadly.

If players did not possess overwhelming strength, then the moment they left the confines of NPC cities, they would have to fight with their lives on the line. This was because both NPCs and monsters gained conscious thought after the major update, and they would no longer let players kill them like idiots.

Both NPCs and monsters would fight desperately for survival.

Hence, grinding monsters would no longer be simple, repetitive fights for EXP. Instead, it would become a fight where players bet their lives for EXP. In a situation where the two sides were roughly equal in strength, every fight would be incredibly taxing. In fact, after the major update, most players would no longer dare fight monsters that were significantly higher-leveled than they were.

Of course, the increased difficulty in killing monsters came in tandem with a drastic increase in the EXP monsters awarded-at least ten times more than what they previously awarded. Even so, leveling up would still become an increasingly laborious task in the future.

However, it was a different story in the Secret Covenant Tower.

The countless monsters trapped in the Secret Covenant Tower’s special space had already gone crazy and did not possess any consciousness or intelligence. The only thing on their minds was slaughter.

Yet, despite the lack of intelligence, the monsters inside granted the same amount of EXP as the monsters in the outside world. The only problem was that entering the Secret Covenant Tower cost Magic Crystals. In addition, the monsters inside did not drop Coins or Magic Crystals. The value of the materials they dropped was also negligible.

Fortunately, the Secret Covenant Tower wasn’t completely barren of loot. Hidden inside the special space were relics belonging to ancient civilizations. The deeper one progressed down the tower, the better the relics one could obtain. Examples would be weapon and equipment designs, Master ranked Potion Recipes, and even complete Legacies for Tier 3 classes.

Yes!

Complete Legacies for Tier 3 classes!

Unlike the Tier 3 Legacies scattered in the outside world, a complete Legacy could lower the difficulty of players’ Tier 3 Promotion by a large margin. A complete Tier 3 Legacy could allow a Guild to gain a large number of Tier 3 players within a short period. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that, for Guilds, a complete Tier 3 Legacy was a hundred times more valuable than a Fragmented Legendary item.

Meanwhile, complete Tier 3 Legacies only started appearing from the 18th floor. This was a place that became available after the first major update. Before this, the Secret Covenant Tower was only a place for pre-Level 100 players to grind for levels. It wasn’t suitable for players past Level 100.

However, after the first major update, the Secret Covenant Tower would no longer be the same as before.

In the past, after it was revealed that the Secret Covenant Tower dropped complete Tier 3 Legacies, the various powers on the eastern continent had swarmed to the Twin Towers Kingdom. This, in turn, had made the Twin Towers Kingdom one of the most dazzling kingdoms in God’s Domain, and Sky Spring City had also become an NPC Main City that was second only to the capital city.

Shortly afterward, Administrator Vico completed all the formalities needed for Zero Wing to garrison Sky Spring City.

“Lord Guild Leader, this is your Sky Spring City Guild Token.” Vico handed a golden token to Shi Feng. He then explained, “This token grants you partial authority to manage Sky Spring City, including its security and development. Once Zero Wing garrisons Sky Spring City, it will receive 10% of the city’s profits as maintenance and management fees.”

“No problem. Zero Wing will manage Sky Spring City well and turn it into the best city in the Twin Towers Kingdom,” Shi Feng said, nodding

Once a Guild garrisoned a city, it couldn’t arbitrarily decide to abandon the city and seek greener pastures. One could say that the Guild and city were bound together for good or ill. Thus, even after Guilds obtained the qualifications to garrison an NPC city, they still had to be careful with their choice.

Fortunately, Shi Feng didn’t have to concern himself with such a problem.

Sky Spring City was bound to become one of the important hubs in the eastern continent. The money and resources it could rake in would far surpass those of many royal capitals. If developed properly, the city could even rival imperial capitals.

“I pray that you can fulfill this wonderful goal, Milord,” Vico said, feeling slightly surprised by Shi Feng’s confidence. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Now that Zero Wing has officially garrisoned Sky Spring City, can we enable Sky Spring City’s City Teleportation Network?” Shi Feng asked.

Obtaining the resources Sky Spring City had to offer was only one of his goals in having Zero Wing garrison the city. What was more important for Zero Wing was the City Teleportation Network that came with garrisoning a city. This was also the main reason the various superpowers had frantically fought to secure a reserve seat.

“Certainly. However, your Guild will have to handle the cost of binding with Sky Spring City’s Teleportation Magic Array,” Vico said with a hint of joy in his voice.

“How much will it cost to construct one large-scale teleportation array?” Shi Feng asked.

“If it is only one, the material fee is 100,000 Gold Coins and 30,000 Magic Crystals. The labor cost is an additional 5,000 Gold,” Vico said. “In total, it will cost 105,000 Gold and 30,000 Magic Crystals.”

“You guys sure are ruthless. It’s just a bunch of ordinary materials, yet you’re actually charging me 100,000 Gold.” Shi Feng was flabbergasted at Vico’s quote.

If it were before, he might’ve accepted this price as normal. However, after gaining experience in constructing teleportation arrays, he knew that the materials needed were much cheaper than what Vico quoted him. At most, the material cost should total around several thousand Gold.

“No, no, no. The materials the Twin Towers Kingdom uses are the best. No problems will occur even after a thousand years of use,” Vico assured sincerely while shaking his head.

“Fine, so be it. However, I want everything done within two hours,” Shi Feng said after taking a look at the time.

It had been nearly a day since the first major update took place.Meanwhile, the first wave of the NPC population boom would occur on the second day after the first major update. This was also the moment darkness would befall the various powers.

“That won’t be a problem,” Vico said confidently. “May I know which Guild City you wish to construct the teleportation array in?”

“Silverwing City!” Shi Feng answered after giving the question some thought. Silverwing City was pivotal to Zero Wing’s future development and resistance against Saint’s Hand. Hence, it was imperative that Silverwing City developed as rapidly as possible.

“Although it is slightly far, so long as Milord makes the full payment, we will act immediately,” Vico said, gritting his teeth as he looked at the map.

To Vico’s joy, Shi Feng paid the 105,000 Gold and 30,000 Magic Crystals without hesitation. After receiving the Coins and Magic Crystals, the NPC promptly left the private lounge, evidently making his way to Silverwing City.

Next, I’ll have to see how much the NPC population will increase during the initial wave. Shi Feng’s gaze grew solemn after Vico left the room. Hopefully, the number isn’t too significant.

Although he had managed to execute his plan in time, its success still depended heavily on how much the NPC population grew after the first population boom. If the increase in NPC count was too severe, even Zero Wing would be overwhelmed. After all, the Guild simply had too few Tier 3 combatants right now. Meanwhile, Tier 3 combatants were the minimum requirement for maintaining public order in Guild Towns.

At 6 AM, the sun slowly rose into the sky and shone its dazzling rays onto the various cities of God’s Domain, symbolizing a new day in God’s Domain.
