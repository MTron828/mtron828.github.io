“Fine-Gold Guards!?”

“These are all Fine-Gold Guards?!”

Cola and the others gasped and stared with wide eyes at the 28 Personal Guards behind Shi Feng.

They all knew how rare Fine-Gold Guards were. Not even some first-rate Guilds had a single Fine-Gold Guard at this stage of the game, and at most, the various superpowers had one or two.

The various superpowers treated their Fine-Gold Guards like family heirlooms, and when these Personal Guards reached Tier 3, they’d be treated as a part of the Guild’s foundation. Fine-Gold Guards were incredibly powerful. Even at Tier 2, they could suppress Tier 2 apex experts of the same level, and they’d only grow stronger at Tier 3.

And yet, Shi Feng informed them that the 28 Personal Guards behind him were all Fine-Gold rank...

“You’re too vicious, Guild Leader. If we stationed these Fine-Gold Guards in the Cold Spring Forest, they’d likely frighten the various superpowers to death,” Blackie said, his eyes glowing as he gazed at the Fine-Gold Guards.

Compared to the various superpowers’ shock when they had found out that these players had reached Tier 3, the fact that Zero Wing had 28 Fine-Gold Guards would be devastating.

Every one of these Tier 3 Fine-Gold Guards had even greater combat power than Tier 3 apex experts. In fact, one of these Fine-Gold Guards could take on two apex experts at once. Needless to say, these Fine-Gold Guards would easily overwhelm peak experts. Now that Zero Wing had so many Fine-Gold Guards, the various superpowers would have to seriously consider the potential losses before moving against Zero Wing, even when their experts reached Tier 3.

“Alright, let’s focus on completing the quest,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

These 28 Fine-Gold Guards might deter the various superpowers from attacking, but if Zero Wing wanted to become truly powerful, it would need to rely on players and resources. There were limits to what a Personal Guard could accomplish, after all.

“Right! Our quest! With these 28 Fine-Gold Guards, we can now raid the wolf dens we avoided earlier!” Cola exclaimed.

Their team had only dared to attack the Battlewolves in the outer region, one pack at a time, but now that they had 28 Fine-Gold Guards to help, they could raid the Battlewolves’ dens. Not only could they collect the Mana strands more quickly, but their leveling speed would also skyrocket.

“No, we’re not going to the dens. We’ll move to the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s inner area,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head as he gestured to the mountains in the distance.

There were a lot of Battlewolves in the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s outer region, but very few of these monsters were Great Lords or higher. Even with the Fine-Gold Guards, they wouldn’t be able to collect the necessary Mana strands fast enough. They’d be cutting it close if they stayed in the outer region. The inner region might be more dangerous, but there were far more Great Lords available in the area, which would allow the team to collect Mana strands far more quickly.

“Guild Leader, the inner region is full of Level 110-plus monsters, including plenty of Great Lords and Mythic monsters,” Yan Tianxing said worriedly.

Monsters gained a significant Basic Attribute boost with each level after Level 100, and the monsters in the Demonwolf Mountain Range had even greater combat standards than their counterparts in other areas of God’s Domain.

If their team accidentally encountered a Level 110-plus Mythic monster in the inner region, they’d risk annihilation, even if they had the help of 28 Fine-Gold Guards. They had only recently reached Level 101, and the Personal Guards, on average, were only Level 103, with a few at Level 104.

“Relax. We’re only going to explore the border between the inner and outer regions,” Shi Feng said. “Besides, we don’t just have 28 Fine-Gold Guards on our side.”

To prove his point, Shi Feng pulled two Summon Guard Scrolls from his bag and summoned Kite and Anna.

After questing on their own for a while, Kite and Anna had reached Level 108 and 109, respectively. They were only slightly lower-leveled than the monsters in the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s inner region.

The team relaxed when they saw Kite and Anna’s levels. Although neither of the NPCs had crossed the Level 110 threshold, they all knew how powerful these two were. Both had Dark-Gold rank Growth Potential and were far more powerful than the Fine-Gold Guards. With the 30 Personal Guards, the team was fully capable of raiding Level 110-plus Grand Lords.

Following which, the team climbed aboard the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship and made their way toward the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s inner region.

A white mist and constant snowstorms bombarded the inner region throughout the year, limiting visibility. Even Tier 3 players couldn’t see farther than 400 yards away. If players were not careful, they could easily fall prey to monster ambushes.

However, Shi Feng was relatively familiar with the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s inner region, and he piloted his flying ship toward one of the snow-capped forests in the area. Not only was visibility here much better than in other areas of the inner region, but these monsters only ranged between Level 110 and 112. Moreover, the wolf packs in the forest tended to keep their distance from each other, so they wouldn’t have to worry about attracting too many monsters while they fought.

“Cola, I want your group to gather the mobs! Tianxing, your group will lure the alpha away from the main group! Everyone else, prioritize the mobs, then target the alpha once they’re dead!” Shi Feng said as he watched a nearby pack.

[Two-headed Frostwolf] (Demonic Creature, Great Lord) Level 110

HP 290,000,000/290,000,000

[Frostwolf Chieftain] (Demonic Creature, Grand Lord) Level 112

HP 750,000,000/750,000,000

The wolf pack they faced only had around 200 members or so, 40 of which were Great Lords, and one was a Grand Lord. An ordinary Tier 3 team would have trouble with this pack, but taking these wolves down should be easy for them.

Cola, Turtledove, and Ye Wumian immediately split up and approached the pack from different directions. They herded the wolves into one big group before Yan Tianxing, Flying Shadow, and the rest of the Assassins on the team ambushed the Frostwolf Chieftain, securing its aggro and luring it away from the pack’s protection.

As soon as the Frostwolf Chieftain and the pack were separated, Anna and the other magical classes on the team bombarded the Frostwolves with their Spells. The remaining melee members then formed a defensive line, preventing the Frostwolves from reaching the ranged players.

After two dozen rounds of attacks, only the Great Lord ranked Two-headed Frostwolves remained standing. The rest of the Frostwolves lay dead in the snow. With them down, a significant portion of the pressure on the melee classes lifted.

After another ten minutes, every Frostwolf had died, except for the Frostwolf Chieftain. The team’s experience bars had risen by a large chunk after killing over 200 Frostwolves, which was a much faster leveling speed than what they had enjoyed in the outer region. They had also acquired 14 Mana strands from the Frostwolves.

Once Cola claimed the Frostwolf Chieftain’s aggro from Yan Tianxing, the team finished the Grand Lord off in less than five minutes. Not only did the Frostwolf Chieftain contribute another Mana strand, but it also dropped more than 20 items as it died, one of which was a piece of Level 105 Fine-Gold Equipment. Naturally, the team was excited about their results.

After two days of endless grinding in the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s outer region, the best loot that had dropped was a few pieces of Level 100 Secret-Silver Equipment, yet after killing one Frostwolf Chieftain, they had obtained a piece of Level 105 Fine-Gold Equipment, two ranks better than their best prior loot.

“We’ve gotten lucky. This Frostwolf Chieftain dropped a piece of the Snowfrost Set, a Fine-Gold Set Equipment for magical class players,” Shi Feng said, smiling at the Level 105 Fine-Gold ranked cloth armor he had picked up. “The complete set can be used until Level 110.”

Fine-Gold Set Equipment was extremely rare after Level 100. The standard equipment for Tier 3 players was limited to Fine-Gold Equipment after Level 100. Very few experts would be fortunate enough to equip a full Fine-Gold Set Equipment.

Aside from the Snowfrost Set piece, the Frostwolf Chieftain had dropped two pieces of Level 105 Secret-Silver Equipment. This was definitely a benefit of pioneering the area. Normally, a Grand Lord like the Frostwolf Chieftain wouldn’t drop such abundant loot.

“Guild Leader, since the Frostwolf Chieftain drops pieces of the Snowfrost Set, it should drop pieces of other Level 105 Fine-Gold Set Equipment. Based on the results of our earlier scouting efforts, there are several Frostwolf Chieftains nearby. We should kill them all,” Yan Tianxing suggested.

“Mhm. Everyone, get ready. Cola, lure another Frostwolf Chieftain our way,” Shi Feng said, nodding.
