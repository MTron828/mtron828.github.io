Chapter 581 – Divine Kingdom’s Resurgence

Mental Dominator?

Shi Feng was surprised by the title he abruptly obtained.

[Mental Dominator]

When the title is equipped, it weakens all mental attacks received by 20%.

The effect of weakening mental attacks received by 20% might seem insignificant, but that would only be true if he were still on the Eternal Continent. On the Western Continent, the Mental Dominator title could yield him extraordinary benefits.

Compared to the Eternal Continent’s monsters, the Western Continent’s monsters weren’t all that different in Basic Attributes. However, because of their mastery over mental attacks, they were vastly more difficult to deal with.

If he were to equip the Mental Dominator title, he would raise his resistance to mental attacks to a new level. If he were to face the Half-Snakekin General again, he wouldn’t even need to split his attention to deal with the Regional Boss’s mental attacks.

Now that my Concentration has reached the Tier 6 Advanced, I can probably execute Sword of Space without channeling my mana for a long time,?Shi Feng theorized when he felt his control over his mana improving significantly. Then, he unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator and thought,?I wonder if I can break the second seal.

When he previously undid the Shadow Incinerator’s first seal, the weapon had gained the might of a Legendary Weapon. If he could undo the second seal, the Godly Relic could undoubtedly elevate his overall strength to a whole new level. At that time, even if he had to roam the Western Continent by himself, he would face far fewer problems.

One time… Two times… Three times…

Shi Feng tried attacking the mental nodes on the Shadow Incinerator’s second seal multiple times using Mental Condensation in quick succession. However, the mental nodes remained completely unfazed.

It seems I was hoping for too much.?Shi Feng wryly smiled when he saw how he had utterly failed to break the second seal.

The Shadow Incinerator’s second seal was of a much higher rank than the first seal. Moreover, he sensed that the effectiveness of the Mental Condensation technique taught to him by the Primordial Abyssal God had weakened significantly after his Concentration reached the Tier 6 Advanced standard. The technique did not strengthen his Concentration to the Tier 6 Peak standard and only improved it by half a rank.

If he wanted to break the second seal, he would still have to raise his Concentration by half a rank.

Nevermind. At least I won’t have difficulties learning how to inscribe Intermediate Divine Engravings now.

Shi Feng quickly got over his disappointment and regained his calm. After all, his primary goal in trading away the Bronze Mana Purification Technique for the Soul Blood was never to undo the Shadow Incinerator’s second seal. Instead, it was to upgrade his Concentration to the Tier 6 Advanced standard so that he could learn how to inscribe Intermediate Divine Engravings quicker and have an easier time roaming the Western Continent by himself.

Admittedly, he could have an easier time killing Legendary-ranked Regional Bosses if he operated with the Dawnlight Party. However, he was in possession of the Feather of Oath. So long as he could resist the mental attacks of the Western Continent’s monsters, he could afford to explore higher-level maps and slay Legendary-ranked World Bosses by himself. Not only would he get to monopolize all of the loot, but the quality would also be vastly superior to that of Regional Bosses.

“Something’s up! Everyone, gather!”

At this time, Sky Pivot suddenly disrupted the cave’s tranquility, his command causing everyone to gather at the cave’s entrance reflexively.

“What happened outside, Leader?” Splashing Fire asked, growing a little anxious when he saw Sky Pivot’s unusually serious expression. “Did the Holy Race players discover us?”

Their party of six might be strong, but the Holy Race players had many experts. Some of them could even contend against the likes of Sky Pivot. If two or three of such experts worked together, they could quickly take down Sky Pivot, let alone the rest of their party.

“No, that’s not it,” Sky Pivot said, shaking his head. Then, with a confused look, he continued, “The Holy Race players outside are behaving strangely. It looks like they received a command of some sort, and they are now gathering in a particular direction. But I haven’t sensed any signs of battle coming from the direction they are headed.”

“They are heading in a direction without signs of battle?” Shi Feng had his curiosity piqued a little when he heard Sky Pivot’s description.

The Holy Race players were similar to human players in that they were split among numerous powers. Currently, the Holy Race players operating on the Plain of Fallen Gods all came from different powers, so their relationship with each other was that of competitors. Because of this, whenever they started to gather in the same direction, it usually meant they had perceived signs of battle coming from that direction, and they intended to contest for loot.

But if there were no signs of battle, it meant that no Boss battles were taking place nearby. In that case, it was very strange for the Holy Race players to gather in the same direction.

It still wouldn’t make sense even if allies notified them about a Boss battle taking place. If they were so far away that they couldn’t perceive any signs of the battle in question, the battle would have long ended by the time they arrived at the scene, and there would be no point in them heading over.

“Wait! That’s…a…city?” Before anyone could come to a conclusion, Sky Pivot suddenly exclaimed, “A city appeared on the Plain of Fallen Gods!”

Before Sky Pivot could continue speaking, a regional announcement rang in everyone’s minds.

Regional System Announcement: The sealed Divine Kingdom of old has been opened. Divine Kingdom’s Afterglow expansion pack activated.

The announcement repeated three times, stunning everyone.

During God’s Domain’s Mythical Era, countries that could be dubbed as a Divine Kingdom were countries ruled by Gods, and they possessed civilizations and technologies far beyond the grasp of the modern era.

“No wonder the Holy Race players are rushing over there! A Divine Kingdom! This is undoubtedly the biggest opportunity the Western Continent has to offer!” Splashing Fire exclaimed ruefully. “If we can secure even a tiny portion of what the Divine Kingdom has to offer, it will probably still be better than a Regional Boss’s loot.”

Moon Bamboo nodded in agreement. Then, she looked at Sky Pivot and said, “This is a rare opportunity, Leader. Now that our party has grown much stronger, should we take a look too?”

Following Moon Bamboo’s words, Splashing Fire, Budding Leaf, and Billowing Water also looked at Sky Pivot with hopeful and excited gazes.

During the past half an hour, they had already equipped the Secret Treasures they had obtained. Billowing Water had also gained initial mastery over her Bronze Purification Technique, putting her current strength close to Sky Pivot.

“Okay! Let’s go and take a look!” After hesitating for a moment, Sky Pivot decided to take a gamble.

…

Plain of Fallen Gods, central region:

What should have been a vast forested plain was now dominated by a towering city. The city occupied the entirety of the Plain of Fallen Gods’ central region and awed all players who approached it with its mountain-like walls.

It should be known that even the walls of Holy Cities would normally only reach a height of one hundred meters. Yet, the city that occupied the central region had walls measuring thousands of meters in height. Even birds would need to fly a long time to reach the top of the walls and cross them. As for players who couldn’t fly, these walls were akin to an insurmountable barrier.

At this time, though, thousands of Flying Mounts filled the sky above the city. Each of these Flying Mounts was at Tier 4 or above, and standing on the back of these Flying Mounts were Holy Race players exuding astonishing auras. Even the weakest of these Holy Race players exuded auras on par with the average Tier 6 human player. As for the Holy Race players standing atop the several Tier 5 Flying Mounts positioned in the lead, their presence was akin to that of Gods, and they exuded Holy Power that distorted the surrounding space.

At this time, a Level 164, Tier 5 middle-aged man with a solemn appearance could be seen approaching a young man on his Tier 5 Flying Mount. The young man had holy patterns marking his eyes, and the middle-aged man put on a respectful expression when he arrived before the young man.

“Lord Royal Thunder, all Tier 6 combatants operating in the Plain of Fallen Gods have already gathered. They number more than 50,000, and they are ready to comply with your orders,” the middle-aged man reported. “We have also discovered several human parties riding Tier 5 Flying Mounts secretly stalking us from 3,000 yards away. Should we eliminate them before we proceed?”
