Chapter 220 – Earth-Shattering

…

TL Notes:

[1]Glimmering Sword:

Going by this chapter’s wording, it would seem that the author has forgotten that he had previously designated “Glimmering Sword” as Laura Crader’s nickname and has started to treat it as her actual ID?

(I’m still not exactly sure about this. This will only be proven when her ID appears in a system announcement or something system-related.)

…

Black Flame’s level is already more than astonishing! Even someone who has grinded nonstop and without even going offline since the Miniature Ancient World’s launch would, at best, match his level! But Level 120?! Who is this woman?!

Shock and confusion filled Liu Wusheng when he saw Glimmering Sword’s level.

Players would have their leveling speed plummet once they reached Level 100. Even the main force members of the various superpowers grinding in a map with abundant monsters would need two or three days to level up once.

Players’ leveling speed would fall by another notch once they reached Level 110 in the Miniature Ancient World. This was because monsters outside the Boundary Mountain Range would not exceed Level 120. Not to mention, the level suppression in the Miniature Ancient World was much stronger than on the main continent.

Overall, it should take at least another month of constant grinding for the various superpowers’ main force members to reach Level 120.

Yet, the woman with light-blue hair walking had already reached Level 120, essentially surpassing the various superpowers’ progress by a month.

Moreover, since Glimmering Sword had already reached Level 120, it meant that she could start exploring the core region of the Boundary Mountain Range’s underground area and challenge her Tier 4 promotion!

How many secrets is Black Flame hiding??Galaxy Past was similarly shocked when he looked at Glimmering Sword.

In the eyes of the average player, reaching Level 120 might not seem like a big deal. After all, it was only a difference of several levels.

However, as the former Guild Leader of a first-rate Guild, Galaxy Past understood the significance of reaching Level 120. Glimmering Sword’s appearance would definitely change the current status quo in the Miniature Ancient World.

This was because reaching Level 120 meant that Glimmering Sword could get promoted to Tier 4 before all other players.

Meanwhile, so long as Glimmering Sword reached Tier 4, the Asura Mercenary Alliance would have an overwhelming advantage over the other powers. At that time, the mercenary alliance could monopolize the various resources available in the Boundary Mountain Range, and not even the Five Great Super Guilds would dare to have an opinion about it.

Aside from Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past, Crimson Heart from Hundred Flower Palace was similarly shocked to see Glimmering Sword. In fact, the degree of shock she experienced was even greater than Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past.

Didn’t they say that the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s natives couldn’t leave the Stratified Abyssal Realm??Confusion filled Crimson Heart’s mind as she looked at Glimmering Sword.

After living in the Stratified Abyssal Realm for ten days, Crimson Heart had already gained a good understanding of the situation there.

There was no question that the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s players possessed combat standards far surpassing the players of their God’s Domain. In fact, just the experts in Slumber City were more than enough to trample over the entire Miniature Ancient World.

After learning about the strength of the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s players, Crimson Heart had naturally thought of recruiting some of these experts and bringing them to the Miniature Ancient World.

However, after looking through all available information, she came to the conclusion that none of the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s native players could leave. Although there was a rumor mentioning that there might be a way to do so at the Dark Sanctuary, that was only a rumor that had never been verified.

Hence, Crimson Heart couldn’t even begin to fathom what means Shi Feng had used to actually be able to bring players out of the Stratified Abyssal Realm.

Meanwhile, after being in shock for a brief moment, Crimson Heart couldn’t help but shudder in excitement. This was because she could already foresee the Miniature Ancient World’s power structure undergoing a thorough change. At the end of these changes, the Five Great Super Guilds and the transcendental powers Secret Pavilion and Flower of Seven Sins would likely become history.

“These two here are Commander Glimmering Sword and Commander Echoing Judgment,” Shi Feng said, briefly introducing Laura Crader and Echoing Judgment to the others in the room. “They will be joining Asura from today on. Each of them will also hold an administrative seat in Asura.”

Glimmering Sword and Echoing Judgment nodded and proceeded to do a brief self-introduction before taking a seat at the table.

Despite Shi Feng abruptly announcing that Glimmering Sword and Echoing Judgment would each occupy an administrative seat in Asura, nobody present objected to the decision or found it unfair. This was because the levels of Glimmering Sword and Echoing Judgment had already mentioned a lot of things. There was also a high likelihood that the two had come from the so-called Zero Wing behind Shi Feng.

At this point, it was already very obvious that the Asura Mercenary Alliance was an auxiliary power of Zero Wing. So, Zero Wing naturally had the authority to decide which power could join and hold an administrative seat in the mercenary alliance.

Not to mention, the stronger the Asura Mercenary Alliance became, the more beneficial it would be for the powers tied to Asura.

“Let’s start discussing our subsequent actions, then,” Shi Feng said after seeing that everyone was seated. “Now that we have already declared an all-out war against the Flower of Seven Sins, we naturally have to do something to show for it. To ensure that we can make the Flower of Seven Sins truly feel the effects of our declaration of war, I plan to eliminate the Flower of Seven Sins’ main force in the Boundary Mountain Range.”

The main force of any power was the product of spending an astronomical amount of resources. A power’s main force was usually responsible for raiding challenging monsters and exploring dangerous areas to secure advantages for the power they belonged to.

Meanwhile, the death of even one main force member was enough to cause a power’s heart to bleed. If a power’s entire main force got wiped out, it would significantly impact the power’s future development.

“Eliminate the Flower of Seven Sins’ main force?”

Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past were stunned by Shi Feng’s words. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Guild Leader Black Flame, isn’t this too crazy?” Hurriedly, Liu Wusheng said, “The Flower of Seven Sins’ main force is currently being led by the Sin of Gluttony’s commander. In addition, the several great alliances have already monopolized the second underground level. With Asura’s current strength, we probably can’t even get past the second level’s entrance, let alone enter the second level to target the Flower of Seven Sins’ main force...”

Due to the Boundary Mountain Range’s unique environment, the quantity of experts had become much more important than quality.

Moreover, because the Flower of Seven Sins’ main force operated in the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level, they’d have to reach the second underground level before they could eliminate the Flower of Seven Sins’ main force. However, the various great alliances had already monopolized the second underground level. The average alliance couldn’t even get close to it, let alone the Asura Mercenary Alliance.

“I agree. After Blackwater and World Dominators’ withdrawal, Asura only has a few thousand Refinement Realm experts remaining. Even if we invest all of them into the Boundary Mountain Range, it still wouldn’t be enough to go up against the Flower of Seven Sins’ several tens of thousands of Refinement Realm experts…” Galaxy Past said.

If Blackwater and World Dominators hadn’t withdrawn from the Asura Mercenary Alliance, Asura might have had the ability to clash against the alliance formed by the Flower of Seven Sins. However, with the situation as it was, Asura had no hope of contending against the Flower of Seven Sins. Not to mention, the bounty the Flower of Seven Sins had put on Asura was still in effect.

“It might be a little crazy, but we aren’t without a chance,” Shi Feng said as he looked at Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past. “I don’t plan on mobilizing a large number of Refinement Realm experts. Instead, we’ll be sneaking into the second underground level with only a 100-man team. So long as we are fast enough, we can enter the second level before the great alliances can react.”

“Sneak in with only a 100-man team?” Liu Wusheng frowned when he heard Shi Feng’s plan. “The several great alliances might not have formed a blockade yet, and we can indeed move quickly in a 100-man team, but we’ll have difficulty breaking through if we come across a 1,000-man team. If we get held down for too long, we’ll only get surrounded and killed...”

Galaxy Past nodded in agreement, thinking that Shi Feng’s plan was too crazy. Shi Feng might be a God-ranked expert, but the several great alliances similarly had God-ranked experts guarding the entrance to the second underground level. So, the Asura Mercenary Alliance had no advantages over the great alliances.

“Since Guild Leader Black Flame has already said so, Hundred Flower Palace is willing to participate in this operation,” Crimson Heart suddenly said.

“Mysterious Moon is also willing to send players for this operation,” Zhuo Yalin said, albeit somewhat reluctantly.

Similar to Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past, Zhuo Yalin also felt that Shi Feng’s plan carried great risk. One unexpected encounter could easily result in the dispatched experts being wiped out. However, Lin Yaoyue, who stood next to her, had urged her to agree to the plan, so she decided to trust her friend’s judgment.

Meanwhile, Liu Wusheng and Galaxy Past couldn’t help but grow confused when they saw Hundred Flower Palace and Mysterious Moon agreeing to Shi Feng’s crazy plan. They couldn’t understand why the two Guilds were so confident in Zero Wing. After all, the operation involved them entering a lion’s den filled with tens of thousands of Refinement Realm experts. This simply wasn’t a force the current Asura Mercenary Alliance could go up against.

“Fine. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. The Star Alliance is also willing to participate,” Galaxy Past said, gritting his teeth.

He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t interested in gaining access to the Boundary Mountain Range’s second underground level. After all, the second underground level held crucial information pertaining to the Tier 4 promotion. Since Zero Wing, Hundred Flower Palace, and Mysterious Moon were willing to take the risk, the Star Alliance naturally couldn’t shrink back.

“It seems I’m going to have to work these old bones again. Witch’s Sin is also willing to join,” Liu Wusheng said, sighing deeply.
