Chapter 3773 - 847 - Meeting the Shimmering Sword Again

Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, Flame Vein Holy City, Teleportation Hall:

A pillar of light rose from one of the teleportation arrays in the Teleportation Hall. Then, a group of players emerged from the light; Shi Feng and Red Frost walked among the group.

“What an incredible city. The Tier 6 population here is already comparable to the Eternal Realm’s.”

When Shi Feng scanned the interior of the Teleportation Hall, he found that over 20% of the people in the crowded building were Tier 6 players. He had only ever seen such a high proportion of Tier 6 players in the Eternal Realm, which was a gathering place for the Greater God’s Domain’s experts.

Tier 6 was a massive threshold in the Greater God’s Domain that only a small minority of players could reach. For context, the average Elementary God’s Domain could give birth to only 100 or so Tier 6 players. Thus, any player who could successfully reach Tier 6 would be considered a frontline combatant and treated as a guest by hegemonic powers.

Yet, Flame Vein Holy City’s Teleportation Hall alone currently hosted over a thousand Tier 6 players. Some of them were even at Level 220 or above. This was considered a rare sight, even in the Holy Cities of other Sanctuaries.

“Today is just special,” Red Frost explained. “Today is when Holy Dragon Spear hosts its Battle of the Chosen Ones. As anyone is welcome to buy a ticket to spectate the competition, many Tier 6 players have come running here. You’d be lucky to see even one-third of the Tier 6 players here during normal times.”

“I see.” Shi Feng immediately came to a realization.

Battles between apex experts, especially experts on the Divine Glory List, were a good learning opportunity for the average Tier 6 player. But as these battles rarely occurred, the average Tier 6 player could only rely on battle videos, which were much less effective for learning. Thus, the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team’s Battle of the Chosen Ones was a golden opportunity for many Tier 6 players.

In a situation where Tier 7 was inaccessible, the significance of combat standards would exceed equipment standards once players reached Tier 6. Meanwhile, the chosen ones nurtured by the various pseudo-apex and apex powers were all experts who had learned techniques inaccessible to the average Tier 6 player in the Greater God’s Domain. If the average Tier 6 player could learn one or even half of a technique from these chosen ones, it would elevate their combat standard to the next level. Hence, many Tier 6 players had come running to spectate Holy Dragon Spear’s Battle of the Chosen Ones.

In reality, if not for the teleportation inside the Twelve Sanctuaries costing an exorbitant amount of Seven Luminaries Crystals, Flame Vein Holy City would have already been packed with Tier 6 players.

…

After leaving the Teleportation Hall, Red Frost led Shi Feng through the city’s bustling streets. Because of her familiarity with the city’s layout, they quickly arrived in front of a large Battle Arena in the heart of the Holy City.

The Battle Arena was the size of a town. It had over 30 entrances, and 100 members of Holy Dragon Spear guarded each one.

These Holy Dragon Spear members were all fifth-floor experts at Level 220 or above. They were fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment, and the party leaders among them were even equipped with eight-piece Legendary Equipment Sets and Combat-ranked Secret Treasures. Executives of hegemonic powers would be embarrassed if they compared equipment standards with these Holy Dragon Spear members.

These 100-man teams were comparable to the various apex powers’ trump card legions. Just one of them could overpower any power operating in the current Eternal Realm.

Following Shi Feng and Red Frost’s arrival, two individuals waiting outside the Battle Arena’s main entrance approached them. The two individuals were Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf. Compared to their appearances in the real world, Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf looked somewhat different in God’s Domain.

Xiao Yilong was already a giant in the real world, his muscular body reaching three meters. However, he was even taller in God’s Domain, coming in at four meters. He was also a Level 230 High Demidragon fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifact-ranked equipment, and his shield was even a complete Divine Artifact.

As for Twilight Leaf, she was a Level 225 Catkin Swordsman. She looked much less like a fairy in God’s Domain, having adopted a wild temperament instead. Although her equipment standard was inferior to that of Xiao Yilong, she still possessed a mix of Fragmented Divine Artifact- and Legendary-ranked equipment. The crystalline sword on her back also radiated the aura of a Divine Artifact.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What took you two so long? I nearly thought you wouldn’t show up,” Xiao Yilong grumbled as he looked at Shi Feng. When he turned to Red Frost and saw that she was only Level 223 and fully equipped with Legendary Equipment, he couldn’t help but sigh, “I already talked to the old commander and the others about your situation. They have agreed that they will support you in capturing a Void Fortress so long as you can come in second place in the Battle of the Chosen Ones and last ten moves against the champion. Otherwise, there will be no further discussion…”

“Just ten moves against the champion?” Xiao Yilong’s words surprised Red Frost. She didn’t think the adventurer team’s old commander, Elders, and Grand Elders’ conditions to help her would be so simple.

The Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team nurtured ten chosen ones this generation. The prerequisite for becoming a chosen one was to reach the fifth-floor standard. Thus, although the chosen ones weren’t equally talented, the difference in combat standards among them was minor. Unless there was a huge disparity in equipment standards, it was unlikely for a match between Holy Dragon Spear’s two strongest chosen ones to conclude under 50 moves.

“Do you think it’s a low requirement?” Xiao Yilong asked, having seen through Red Frost’s thoughts. Then, his expression suddenly darkened as he asked, “How many exchanges do you think I can last against the adventurer team’s strongest chosen one?”

“Twenty?” Red Frost answered in an uncertain tone.

Shi Feng also turned to look at Xiao Yilong, curious to learn how strong Holy Dragon Spear’s strongest chosen one was currently.

“Five,” Xiao Yilong said after taking a deep breath. “I fought her after I returned from visiting you, and I lost after only five exchanges. Moreover, I only lasted that long because I am a Shield Warrior. Otherwise, the fight could have ended after the third exchange. How many exchanges do you think you can last?”

Twilight Leaf wore a downcast expression. She knew this news would likely come as a great shock to Red Frost.

“Only five exchanges?” Shi Feng suddenly smiled when he heard Xiao Yilong’s answer. “It seems Holy Dragon Spear’s strongest chosen one will indeed be a good opponent for Commander Frost.”

Before training at the Tower of the Abyss, Red Frost would have indeed lost a fight against Holy Dragon Spear’s strongest chosen one. However, after training at the Tower of the Abyss for the past three days, Red Frost had reached the sixth-floor standard and was now vastly stronger than before.

“You… Have you been listening to me? I’m talking about an actual fight in God’s Domain here!” Xiao Yilong snarled as he glared at Shi Feng, who was only at Level 200. Shi Feng’s calm demeanor enraged him, and he wanted nothing more than to fight Shi Feng once more to demonstrate his true strength.

However, before Xiao Yilong could challenge Shi Feng again, their surroundings suddenly grew noisy. When Xiao Yilong and Twilight Leaf turned to check the commotion, a hint of fear suddenly flashed in their eyes.

At this time, two women could be seen walking toward the Battle Arena’s main entrance. Both were elves. One of them looked younger than 20 and had blond, curly hair. She was at Level 227, carried an emerald staff, and wore a white robe.

The other elven woman was a Swordsman in her mid-twenties. She had long light blue hair topped with a silver crown, and a rapier hung at her waist.

“Laura?” Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the elven Swordsman.
