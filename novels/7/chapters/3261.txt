Chapter 336 – Mutated Heroic Spirit

Following the system announcement, the atmosphere across the Ancient River Secret Land tensed up significantly. The audiences spectating the broadcast of the Rookie Competition also went into an uproar.

“Are these people really human? The first qualifier usually only appears on the second day or later in past Rookie Competitions. Yet, eight qualifiers have already appeared, even though only ten hours have gone by in the competition this time. How are other people supposed to compete against them?”

“Most of the parties led by the kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons have only collected around 30 to 40 Heroic Spirit Remnants thus far, yet those eight qualifiers have collected 100 already. Just how fast are their parties in killing Heroic Spirits?”

“It’s not surprising. After all, monsters like the Myriad Forest Empire’s Empress Blood Arrow Leroja and the Red Star Kingdom’s Undefeated Battle Maniac Cross are participating in this competition. The eight qualifiers are basically a group of monsters. The fight for number one is definitely going to be worth seeing later on.”

“Indeed. Any one of these eight qualifiers could have easily secured first place in past competitions. Now, all eight of them have appeared at the same time. Who among them will emerge victorious is anyone’s guess.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“How strange. What happened to the Asura Sword Emperor? Didn’t he defeat Markless Blade?”

“Black Flame might have defeated Markless Blade, but Markless Blade is still slightly inferior to the eight qualifiers. In my opinion, Black Flame could, at best, get into the top 20.”

…

The spectators started a heated discussion when they saw the birth of the eighth qualifier.

The quality of the Rookie Competition’s participants this time was vastly superior to those of past competitions. It was especially so for the veteran paragons. Although the various kingdoms’ young paragons were by no means weak, those veteran paragons showed everyone with their performances that even with the passing of time, they wouldn’t allow younger paragons and geniuses to overtake them easily.

Meanwhile, out of the eight players who qualified to enter the Ancient River’s Heart, the ones who had attracted the most attention from the spectating audience were the Myriad Forest Empire’s Empress Blood Arrow and the Red Star Kingdom’s Undefeated Battle Maniac. During their generation, both of them were known to be invincible among Tier 4 players. However, as the two had never fought each other, nobody knew which one of them was stronger.

Now, though, an opportunity had come for them to fight.

Hence, everyone was eager to see who was stronger. Would it be Empress Blood Arrow? Or would it be the Undefeated Battle Maniac?

…

While the spectators were discussing the eight qualifiers, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao revealed gloomy expressions.

Shi Feng’s goal in participating in the Rookie Competition this time was to get into the top 10 and enter the Ancient River’s Heart. Now, however, eight out of the ten entry slots had already been occupied. Moreover, judging by how quickly the eight slots were taken up, it shouldn’t be long before the ninth and tenth qualifiers appeared as well.

“How quick of them,” Shi Feng said, taking a deep breath. “It seems we’ll have to act ahead of time.”

“Act ahead of time?” Midsummer looked at Shi Feng in confusion. “Do you mean killing Heroic Spirits?”

No matter how Midsummer racked her brain, she simply couldn’t figure out how they could secure a spot among the top 10 before the two remaining slots were taken. Although she and Wu Xiaoxiao could now enhance their combat power if they spent Seven Luminaries Crystals to use the Four Gods Secret Art, the boost wasn’t enough to let them catch up to the other participants.

“No.” Shi Feng shook his head. Then, he smiled and said, “Our targets are the other parties!”

“Other parties?” Midsummer was stunned.

Robbing players was indeed the quickest way to collect Heroic Spirit Remnants. However, doing so came with great risks. It was especially so now that the competition had already reached the halfway point. If they tried to rob a party, there was a high chance a third party would take advantage of the situation to eliminate them.

At the start of the competition, all parties had killed hardly any Heroic Spirits, so they wouldn’t have many Heroic Spirit Remnants in their possession. Unless there existed a grudge between two parties, it wouldn’t be worthwhile for parties to fight each other.

However, at this point, every party had already killed quite a few Heroic Spirits, so they should have many Heroic Spirit Remnants in their possession. If two parties were to start clashing in this situation, the commotion caused would definitely tempt nearby parties to take advantage of the situation.

So, if their party of three were to attack other parties now, not only would they risk getting no Heroic Spirit Remnants for their efforts, but they might even risk the elimination of their party.

“Don’t worry,” Shi Feng said, smiling when he saw the worry on Midsummer’s and Wu Xiaoxiao’s faces. Then, he took out 2,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal from his bag and handed each girl 1,000, saying, “With our party’s strength, nobody should think of taking advantage of us!”

If it was before Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had learned the Four Gods Secret Art, Shi Feng wouldn’t have chosen to attack other parties since they would risk getting attacked by numerous parties. If the number of enemies became too overwhelming, even he would be powerless to resist. After all, most of the parties that had gotten into the official phase were extraordinary. They had a bunch of lifesaving methods. If they used these lifesaving methods to drag out the fight, there’d be nothing he could do against them once he expended all his trump cards.

However, it was a different story now that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had learned the Four Gods Secret Art.

“Time is running out, so let’s move quickly,” Shi Feng said as he turned to a direction with obvious mana fluctuations. Then, he swiftly ran in that direction.

Seeing this, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao exchanged looks before gritting their teeth and chasing after Shi Feng.

Currently, apart from robbing other players, there wasn’t any other way they could collect 100 Heroic Spirit Remnants within a short time. So, they had no choice but to take some risks.

A few minutes later, Shi Feng’s party of three arrived under a cliff, and the mana fluctuations they sensed came from the top of the cliff.

Currently, over thirty players could be seen on top of the cliff. Although these players clearly came from different parties, they were not fighting each other. Instead, they were working together to take on several Heroic Spirits with little HP remaining. Moreover, these players all wore joyful and excited looks on their faces.

That is…a Mutated Hero?! Shi Feng was shocked and confused when he saw the leader of the group of Heroic Spirits.

…

[Ancient Heroic Spirit] (Mutant, Tier 4 Great Wizard)

Level 145

HP 5,000,000,000

…

Mutants were special monsters in God’s Domain. Unlike normal monsters, mutated monsters didn’t have their movements restricted to specific areas. In addition, they could also continuously grow stronger, meaning the more monsters and players they killed, the stronger they would become.

There were 22 monsters that should never be provoked in the Greater God’s Domain. Or, more specifically, there were 22 monsters that even Ancient Gods were helpless against, let alone players. When faced with these 22 monsters, even the various apex powers would have to run away.

In their current state, any one of these 22 monsters was capable of single-handedly destroying an entire Realm. Many God’s Domains had also faced destruction at the hands of these 22 monsters.

Meanwhile, among these 22 monsters, more than half were Mutants.

Initially, these Mutants were incredibly weak, with some even starting at only Tier 3. However, as they continuously grew stronger, they eventually became invincible existences in God’s Domain.

However, in exchange for their unrestricted growth, Mutants would drop incredibly lucrative rewards when killed. Normally, a Mutant would drop items one tier above their current tier. Mutants found in the Greater God’s Domain would even drop unique items.

These unique items would differ depending on the Mutants’ tier. The quality of a Mutant’s loot would also differ significantly according to its tiers. Normally, a Tier 4 Mutant would drop items between the Epic and Legendary rank, while Tier 5 Mutants would drop Fragmented Divine Artifacts, and Tier 6 Mutants would drop Divine Artifacts.

“Quick! The Mutant is about to die!”
