Chapter 394 - Times Have Changed

The Legacy Trial had given him a total of 31 Legacy Skill Points. Anyone would hesitate over spending 30 points on only two skills.

However, Shi Feng did not. With his mind made up, Shi Feng clicked to learn both Skywheel Sword and Blade Liberation. Suddenly, his stock of Legacy Skill Points plummeted to 1.

To an expert in God’s Domain, nothing was more important than a powerful skill.

A powerful Tier 1 skill had a lot of versatility, so it was not easy to master. However, if mastered, it would not be surprising if a player’s combat power increased by severalfold.

As the saying went, a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.

Although Shi Feng could learn more skills if he spent the 30 Legacy Skill Points on less costly skills, the skills he learned would not contribute as much to his overall combat power.

During dangerous moments, in particular, the super-burst skill, Blade Liberation, would be far more useful than a dozen other ordinary Tier 1 skills.

After learning the two Class Skills, Shi Feng used a Return Scroll and teleported back to White River City.

At this moment, White River City buzzed with activity. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Overwhelming Smile’s high-priced poaching had boosted White River City’s development. A flood of independent players had migrated to White River City with the intention of joining Overwhelming Smile.

Based on the statistics offered by the official game developers, the player population in White River City had exceeded three million. White River City was now the most populated city in Star-Moon Kingdom’s eastern region. It was also the third most populated city throughout Star-Moon Kingdom.

Looking at this situation, Shi Feng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Originally, he had intended to make White River City the most popular city in Star-Moon Kingdom. After all, Zero Wing’s Guild Residence was in White River City, so it had the home-field advantage here. However, he never thought an enemy like Overwhelming Smile would actually help him achieve that plan.

Fate truly knew how to toy with people.

If Feng Xuanyang, the mastermind behind this situation, knew Shi Feng’s thoughts right now, he would most likely pop a vein or two out of anger.

However, Shi Feng also could not help but admit that Feng Xuanyang’s plan of desperately throwing money away was very effective. Currently, Overwhelming Smile had become the undisputed number one Guild in White River City. The Branch Guild in White River City already had over 80,000 members. Among them, there were also quite a few elite players. Compared to the other Guilds in White River City, Overwhelming Smile was far superior.

Moreover, during this period, Overwhelming Smile had continuously raided large-scale Dungeons around White River City. As if they were on steroids, Overwhelming Smile’s raiding speed far surpassed Gentle Snow’s team; they were on completely different levels. In addition, Overwhelming Smile had also offered to purchase information regarding Reputation Quests at a high price, apparently intending to become the second Guild in White River City to own a Guild Residence.

In contrast, Zero Wing showed no signs of movement at all. The Guild’s member count held steady around 20,000. If not for the high-level quests and Double EXP buff available from the Guild Residence, most of Zero Wing’s members would have long since defected to Overwhelming Smile.

“Brother Feng, you’re finally out. Have you completed your Class Change?” Not long after Shi Feng returned to White River City, Blackie contacted him.

“Yeah. How has the Guild been recently?” Shi Feng asked, not bothering to discuss his new class.

“What do you think? The entire Guild has been spiritless these past few days, and everyone is just focusing on quests. Many in the Guild have also started complaining and asking why the core team hasn’t moved against Overwhelming Smile yet. Overwhelming Smile’s suppression has them feeling resentful. Moreover, those Overwhelming Smile bastards have also started ridiculing Zero Wing publicly, claiming that we’re all bark and no bite,” Blackie said, feeling slightly indignant. “Brother Feng, since you’ve returned, why don’t we start raiding a Level 20 large-scale Dungeon and show those punks from Overwhelming Smile Zero Wing’s strength?”

Currently, the Level 20 Dungeons in White River City were only 10- and 20-man Team Dungeons. However, in the 50-man large-scale Team Dungeon, Cerek Dungeon, Overwhelming Smile had not managed to even meet the first Boss of Normal Mode before suffering a team-wipe. Meanwhile, if Zero Wing could obtain the First Clear of Cerek Castle, it would rain on Overwhelming Smile’s parade.

Not only would it extinguish their arrogance, but it would also increase Zero Wing’s reputation.

As for whether or not they could actually raid Cerek Castle, Blackie didn’t doubt their success. Others might not realize how strong Zero Wing’s core team was, but Blackie was well aware Moreover, with Shi Feng around, it would be a simple task to clear the Level 20 large-scale Team Dungeon, Cerek Castle.

“How many people in the Guild have completed their Class Change?” Shi Feng agreed with Blackie’s plan, but Cerek Castle was not easy to dominate.

“There are 39 members who have completed their Class Change. Among them, Sister Aqua was the first to obtain her Tier 1 class, while Sister Fire Dance was second,” Blackie said, a hint of fear surfacing in his eyes as he said “Class Change.” He had never expected that the Class Change Quest would be so difficult. If not for the fact that he possessed the Epic ranked staff, Mavis’s Guard, he might not have completed the quest. Fortunately, he passed his Class Change and obtained an A-rank evaluation. While he waited for Shi Feng’s return, he had familiarized himself with the combat style of a Tier 1 class.

Precisely because the Class Change Quest was not simple, many core members of Zero Wing had failed it. As these members had to wait a few days before they could challenge the quest again.

Moreover, as everyone had been busy with their respective Class Change Quests, the levels of Zero Wing’s core members had fallen behind. Now, Zero Wing no longer occupied all of the top 100 spots on the White River City Ranking List. Others had even claimed a few of the top 10 ranks. This had been a huge blow to Zero Wing’s morale and reputation.

“Thirty-nine? Not bad. Once we have more than 50, I guess we can make a trip to Cerek Castle,” Shi Feng said with a faint smile. In truth, he was somewhat surprised by Blackie’s report.

In the past, even when most players were around Level 24 to 25, most Guilds in White River City had not had more than 20 Tier 1 players. Currently, the average player in White River City was only around 18 to 19. Yet, Zero Wing already possessed 39 Tier 1 players. Although part of this reason was that Shi Feng had leaked some information about the strategy to challenge a few Basic Class Changes, the number of players that had succeeded was still astonishing.

The difference in combat power between Tier 1 players and Tier 0 players was like the difference between heaven and earth. It was not something that could be measured by levels.

Regarding the White River City Ranking List, ever since Zero Wing’s Guild Residence had been established, Shi Feng no longer troubled himself with it. After all, the future was the era of high-tiered players, not high-leveled players.

“Brother Feng, do you really mean it?” Blackie suddenly grew excited. During this period, the oppression he had suffered from those bastards in Overwhelming Smile frustrated him.

“Look at how excited you are. Of course, I mean it. However, I still have something I need to attend to right now. For now, have everyone familiarize themselves with the combat style of their Tier 1 classes,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

Although everyone had already evolved to a Tier 1 class, the freedom a Tier 1 class possessed had also become much higher. If players could not properly adapt and display their strength, their combat power would not improve much.

“Okay! Leave it to me! I’ll let everyone know!” Blackie said excitedly before disconnecting the call. He then proceeded to contact those who had already changed classes.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng took a look at the time, noticing that he still had quite some time before his appointment with Gentle Snow. He then retrieved Seliora’s Communication Crystal from his bag. The Grandmaster Forger had given him this item herself, and it allowed him to contact Seliora at any time.

Previously, Shi Feng had helped Seliora become a Grandmaster Forger, resulting in Seliora’s Favorability towards him to increase greatly. Moreover, in order to search for materials to produce an Epic item, Seliora had gone on a journey.

Shi Feng had obtained the Forging Design for the Epic ranked Broken Steel Set Equipment back in the Origin Sword Domain. However, if he had to forge an Epic item by himself, who knew how long it would be before he could achieve such a feat? Since he had a connection with a Grandmaster Forger, why not use it?
