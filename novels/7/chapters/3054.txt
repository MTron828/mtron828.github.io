...

TL Notes:

Made a change to Chapter 128 (20th March 2022):

bounty -> kill order

...

“He... He... What does he mean?”

Lan Hailong fell into a daze as he stared at the villa’s shut door.

Fight?

Fight who?

World Dominators? A Super Guild?

“Should I take care of him, Chairman?” Zhou Yuhu suggested.

“Don’t bother wasting your energy,” Lan Hailong said, shaking his head. Then, with a somewhat gloomy expression, he said, “Before I came here, Gu Yiren had already told us not to provoke Shi Feng no matter what for now.”

“Does Guild Leader Gu doubt my strength?” Zhou Yuhu asked angrily. “I’m not trying to boast, Chairman, but my physical fitness has improved significantly since I started receiving World Dominators’s training resources. I’m only a little ways off from becoming a martial arts master. It’s a piece of cake for me to take care of Shi Feng.”

“You should be aware of Gu Yiren’s strength. Do you think you can beat Gu Yiren in a fight?” Lan Hailong asked as he glanced at Zhou Yuhu.

Zhou Yuhu shook his head in response. Gu Yiren’s physical fitness had already reached a realm that was beyond his reach. If they fought seriously, he felt that Gu Yiren could claim his life in a single move.

“Gu Yiren has said that he isn’t a match for Shi Feng. If you still wish to try after hearing this, be my guest,” Lan Hailong said as he looked at the lights on the second floor lighting up. If it weren’t for Gu Yiren’s warning, he would’ve most likely had a similar idea as Zhou Yuhu. After all, there was no way he would take such a slight sitting down.

Initially, Lan Hailong had been skeptical of Gu Yiren’s claims. However, when he recalled how Gu Yiren talked about Shi Feng fearfully and then saw how nonchalantly Shi Feng treated them today, he realized that Gu Yiren might have been speaking the truth.

“Even Guild Leader Gu isn’t a match?” Zhou Yuhu was stunned when he heard Lan Hailong’s words. At the same time, a hint of fear had also appeared in his eyes as he stared at the villa’s second floor. “But are we really going to let this matter slide?”

Since Gu Yiren had already spoken as such about Shi Feng, Zhou Yuhu naturally wouldn’t be so foolish as to barge into Shi Feng’s villa. If he did that, Shi Feng would be completely within his right to take care of him. Shi Feng could even cripple him without having to worry about any legal repercussions. On the other hand, not only would he have to receive a beating, but he might even get into legal trouble for trespassing onto private property.

“Let this matter slide?” The corners of his mouth lifting slightly, Lan Hailong said, “How can we let this matter slide? Shi Feng might think that he’s become amazing, but he simply has no idea how powerful a Super Guild is! Just wait and see! It won’t be long before Shi Feng comes running to beg me!”

Before coming into contact with World Dominators, Lan Hailong hadn’t thought much of Super Guilds. While he acknowledged that Super Guilds were powerful, he didn’t think they were invincible. He even used to think of challenging a Super Guild if there was an opportunity to do so.

However, after partnering with World Dominators, he realized just how powerful Super Guilds were. The strength the various Super Guilds revealed to the public was merely the tip of the iceberg. Yet, even this small tip was already enough to scare the various non-superpowers into submission.

“But what about all those Epic Weapons and Equipment we lost?” Zhou Yuhu asked worriedly. “Without those items, our main force won’t be able to compete against the other powers’ main force. We’ll also be a step behind in exploring Level 110-plus maps...”

Currently, most of the various powers’ experts in the Miniature Ancient World had already reached Level 103. Some powerful experts had even reached Level 104 already. Meanwhile, once the various powers’ main force members reached Level 105, they would promptly advance into Level 110 maps and widen the gap between them and other players.

However, the Miniature Ancient World had a significantly harsher level suppression system. Without a full suit of Epic Weapons and Equipment, players would have difficulty grinding Level 110 monsters at Level 105.

“We don’t have any other choice. We’ll mortgage one of our Main Cities first and use the money to replace what we lost. I refuse to believe that Shadow can’t survive without that batch of Epic Weapons and Equipment Zero Wing stole!” Lan Hailong said, gnashing his teeth as he looked at the villa’s second floor hatefully. “I want to see just how long Zero Wing can survive against World Dominators’s kill order!”

After saying so, Lan Hailong turned around and walked away. Zhou Yuhu also took one last look at the villa before chasing after Lan Hailong.

Meanwhile, on the villa’s second floor...

After executing three repetitions of the Body Strengthening Technique, Shi Feng grabbed a bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid out of the fridge and drank it. Then, he climbed into his virtual gaming cabin and got ready to log into God’s Domain.

It seems we’ve thoroughly enraged World Dominators this time. I didn’t think World Dominators would put a kill order on us. Shi Feng frowned a little when he recalled Lan Hailong’s words.

When a player power issued a kill order, it showed that this player power was determined to kill the person or organization they targeted. Simply put, a kill order was a bounty. However, the bounty offered by a superpower was different from what non-superpowers could offer.

The bounty the average power offered wouldn’t earn the interest of peak experts. This was because the average power would only offer Credits or Coins for their bounty. At best, it would offer Epic Weapons and Equipment.

However, none of these things could catch the interest of peak experts. After all, a peak expert in God’s Domain could easily earn several million Credits from a single commission. Obtaining Epic Weapons and Equipment was a simple task for peak experts as well. Or, more specifically, most peak experts were the ones selling Epic Weapons and Equipment in God’s Domain.

Hence, the bounties issued by the average power in God’s Domain wouldn’t attract the interest of peak experts at all. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, it was a different story if it were a bounty issued by a superpower. It was especially so if said superpower was a Super Guild, an existence standing at the top among the various superpowers. A Super Guild’s bounty could cause even apex experts to go crazy, let alone peak experts.

Whenever a Super Guild issued a bounty, the very minimum reward it would offer was a Fragmented Legendary item!

Fragmented Legendary items were things that even first-rate Guilds had few of. Typically, even first-rate Guilds wouldn’t be willing to offer Fragmented Legendary items as a reward for their bounties. However, a Super Guild wouldn’t care about that.

Aside from Fragmented Legendary items, Super Guilds would also offer Legacies as rewards.

Of course, these weren’t your average Legacies. Instead, they were God Legacies. These were Legacies that even most first-rate Guilds lacked the ability to acquire.

Meanwhile, a God Legacy would have a fatal attraction toward experts stuck in the boundary between Tier 5 and Tier 6. It was similar to how Galaxy Past was adamant in acquiring the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique.

If World Dominators had decided to issue a kill order on Zero Wing, Shi Feng did not doubt that many peak experts and apex experts would come after Zero Wing. While Shi Feng was confident he could repel these attacks without trouble, it was a different story for Su Qianliu and the others.

Currently, the strongest member in Zero Wing after Shi Feng was Su Qianliu. With her combat standards paired with the Ancient Mana Equipment Set, she could fight against an apex expert fully geared in top-tier Epic items. However, while she might be able to fight off one apex expert, what if she had to go up against two or three simultaneously?

Many peak and apex experts had flooded into the Miniature Ancient World in an attempt to reach Tier 6. There was no way these experts wouldn’t be interested in a kill order issued by World Dominators.

Even if Su Qianliu and the others grouped up whenever they went out to grind, it probably won’t take more than a few seconds before they got sent back to the city. With World Dominators’s kill order in effect, Su Qianliu and the others wouldn’t even be able to leave the city to level up.

It seems I’ll have to open Abyssal Star City ahead of time.
