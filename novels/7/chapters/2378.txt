Chapter 2379 – Overestimating Oneself

“They’re finally done?”

Joy blossomed in Shi Feng’s heart when he read Cola’s message.

Any player that successfully completed their Tier 3 Promotion Quest at this stage of the game instantly became an apex combatant. Their combat power would be leagues ahead of Tier 2 players. Not even Tier 2 Domain Realm experts were a match for Tier 3 players.

Now that Cola and the others had completed their Tier 3 Promotion Quests as well, they could be the Guild’s spearhead, quelling any troubles that plagued their Guildmates. Shi Feng would no longer have to spend all day running around and putting out fires, having more time to invest in his own affairs.

He still had many important, unfinished quests, but since Zero Wing had been at risk and lacked enough powerful experts to protect it from the various superpowers, Shi Feng had been forced to put his quests on hold. Now that Cola and the others had returned, he could return to his quests without worry.

Suddenly, Liang Jing contacted Shi Feng, nervously informing him, “Guild Leader, a group of people from Demon Palace wish to discuss business with you.”

The Demon Palace? Shi Feng was confused when he heard the name. What business do they have with me?

Demon Palace had been extremely famous during his previous life. Not only had the Guild taken over the entire Demonic Hell World early on, but it had also been one of the few up-and-coming superpowers in God’s Domains. After years of development, it had grown into one of the few existences that had the power to contend with the Five Great Super Guilds of God’s Domain.

However, the Demonic Hell World’s Planar Passage was connected to the Ten Saints Empire, one of the Four Great Empires. The Ten Saints Empire was also quite far from Star-Moon Kingdom. Teleporting between the empire and the kingdom cost roughly 9 Gold per person.

“Do you wish to meet them?” Liang Jing asked.

“Let them wait in the reception room for now. I’ll head that way； Shi Feng said. After giving the matter some thought, he agreed to meet with the Demon Palace’s representatives.

Demon Palace was no ordinary superpower. Although it had yet to reveal its fangs, no superpower would dare underestimate it. The Demon Palace had the support of two international corporations and was the Demonic Hell World’s absolute overlord. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The Demonic Hell World was only slightly smaller than an empire, and due to its environment, the players from the Demonic Hell World were far stronger than those on the main continent. In addition, Demon Palace had developed relatively smoothly since it had no competitors in its homeworld.

Even the strongest Super Guild on the main continent struggled with roadblocks and setbacks, yet Demon Palace had faced no such issues. It was easy to imagine how powerful the Guild had become.

Most importantly, the easiest way for players to travel to the western continent was through the Ten Saints Empire. The empire had a dimensional passage, which was the largest and most stable in God’s Domain, that connected the two main continents. This passage also had the least restrictions.

Naturally, the Ten Saints Empire’s various superpowers had taken control of the dimensional passage after its activation. One of those superpowers was Demon Palace.

Because of this, many superpowers petitioned the Demon Palace for partnerships, which allowed the Guild to build its strength and influence. At this point, it was only slightly weaker than the Five Great Super Guilds.

Once Shi Feng had tidied up his work with the Crimson Sunsets, he made his way to the reception room in Zero Wing’s Residence.

Three Demonic Fighters in pitch-black armor quietly waited in the top-floor reception room. Not only were all three Level 100, but their auras felt as if the Demon God himself stood in the room with them. The Tier 2 experts standing guard by the doors shuddered as these auras washed over them.

“Zero Wing is quite interesting. Despite such weak members, it dares to provoke Starlink. If these core members were in our Guild, they’d wouldn’t even be elite members,” a white-haired youth said, shaking his head as he eyed the several Zero Wing core members that had just left the room.

“They are a little underwhelming, but this is a kingdom, after all. It’s a miracle that they’ve grown this strong,” a robust, 2.3-meter-tall, middle-aged man calmly stated. “Moreover, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader has reached Tier 3. It is not without reason that the Vice Guild Leader has set his sights on Zero Wing.”

“Naturally, the Vice Guild Leader knows what he’s doing. Zero Wing is lucky our Vice Guild Leader has noticed it. Even Starlink’s Guild Leader had to go to great lengths to negotiate a partnership,” a tall, slim woman said with a reverent look whenever she mentioned Demon Palace’s Vice Guild Leader.

As far as these three were concerned, neither Zero Wing nor the prosperous Starlink was of any significance. Only Super Guilds were worth Demon Palace’s attention.

While the trio conversed, Shi Feng entered the room, however, the three players didn’t seem overly interested in him. They only observed Shi Feng in silence.

“Greetings, Guild Leader Black Flame. I am Evil Qilin, an Elder from Demon Palace,” the middle-aged man introduced himself. “My two companions are the vice commanders of Demon Palace’s third trump card legion.”

“Greetings,” Shi Feng replied. When he sensed the trio’s violent auras, he realized that all three were very strong. The middle-aged man, in particular, was likely only slightly weaker than Giant’s Heart’s White Autumn. If not for White Autumn’s Sea God’s blessing, he wouldn’t even be a match for the middle-aged man. “May I know what business you have with me?”

“Our Vice Guild Leader values the Star-Moon Adventurer Alliance and desires a cut of the action. We aren’t asking for much of the alliance’s shares; 30% will be enough. In return, Demon Palace will supply Zero Wing with the Demonic Hell World’s rare materials and special Legacies,” Evil Qilin said. “In addition, we would like a temporary Residence in Stone Forest City and 30% of the city’s shares. In exchange, Demon Palace will step in to resolve the Zero Wing’s trouble with Starlink. I’m sure Starlink will back away out of respect for Demon Palace. With our members garrisoned in Stone Forest City, I’m sure we can provide a sufficient deterrent to the other superpowers if they have ideas of trying to steal the city. Zero Wing will be able to develop in peace and join the ranks of God’s Domain’s superpowers.”

“Naturally, Zero Wing welcomes a partnership between Demon Palace and the Star-Moon Adventurer Alliance. However, we can handle Starlink on our own. There is no need for Demon Palace to get involved,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

Shi Feng had no intention of parting with a single percent of Stone Forest City’s shares right now, let alone handing over 30% in exchange for protection.

“Although you are quite formidable, Guild Leader Black Flame, you are only one person. Meanwhile, thanks to some of the Demonic Hell World’s special Legacies, Starlink has established the Hellfire Legion, its strongest force. If you encounter five or six members of the Hellfire Legion, you might be fine, but even as a Tier 3 player, a 100-man team may overtake you. You should reconsider,” Evil Qilin said, sneering disdainfully when he heard that Shi Feng had no intention of sharing Stone Forest City.

He assumed Shi Feng must think himself invincible now that he had reached Tier 3, but even Tier 3 players would have to flee from a 100-man team from the Hellfire Legion, not to mention Zero Wing’s other experts. Demon Palace had already shown a lot of respect by offering to help Zero Wing.

Thank you for your warning, Elder Qilin, but I am confident that Zero Wing can cope with this situation on its own,” Shi Feng said. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll be taking my leave. I still have other matters I need to attend to.”

After dismissing his guests, Shi Feng stood and left the Demon Palace’s representatives alone in the reception room.

“By the looks of it, Elder, it will be impossible to ally with Zero Wing regarding Stone Forest City. Black Flame is simply too arrogant,” the white-haired youth beside Evil Qilin said. “However, the Vice Guild Leader told us to secure Stone Forest City. What should we do?”

“It’s fine. We can wait. Black Flame overestimates himself, but once Starlink takes care of Zero Wing, I’m sure he’ll come to his senses,” Evil Qilin said, sneering at the door Shi Feng had left through. “However, our demands will be much higher once he’s desperate.”

The Star-Moon Adventurer Alliance had lured many experts away from Starlink’s alliances, but the Guild still had many peak experts and top adventurer teams on its side. Starlink also had the Hellfire Legion. With so many enemies at their doors, Zero Wing’s members shouldn’t even think of stepping out of Stone Forest City.

Shortly after Evil Qilin’s group left Zero Wing’s Residence, another group of two dozen players wearing Zero Wing’s Guild Emblems entered.
