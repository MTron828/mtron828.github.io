Chapter 407 – Ninth Absolute Technique

Was I mistaken?

When Shi Feng saw Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja fleeing without hesitation, he couldn’t help but wonder if he had recognized the wrong people.

Setting Desolate Fury aside, who were Cross and Leroja?

They were living legends! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

While Cross and Leroja weren’t at the level where they were known by all in the Starlight Realm, their names were still more or less known by the Starlight Realm’s various powers.

Under normal circumstances, Cross and Leroja would dare to fight against even Tier 5 players, let alone Tier 4 players. After all, the two could already rival Tier 5 players in terms of Basic Attributes. And while they might not have as many Absolute Techniques as paragons the likes of Storm and Saint Arm, they were likely evenly matched with the Paimon Conglomerate’s core paragons when it came to combat standards.

Yet, now, the two battle maniacs had chosen to flee without putting up a fight. If it weren’t for their familiar faces, Shi Feng would have assumed he was looking at two completely different people.

However, Shi Feng quickly denied this possibility.

Even if there existed people who shared similar appearances with Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja, it was too much of a coincidence for these people to be gathered together.

However, before Shi Feng could ponder over his three acquaintances’ presence in the Holy Realm, Desolate Fury’s party of six was stopped by the surrounding search parties.

When Shi Feng saw Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja engaging their opponents in battle, he was further reaffirmed that these three people were the same people he was acquainted with.

Desolate Fury was known as the Divine Shield Bearer during Shi Feng’s previous life. Although Desolate Fury wasn’t currently wielding a Divine Shield, his way around the shield was top-notch. When he focused solely on defending himself, he perfectly neutralized the attacks of the three Berserkers besieging him.

Cross and Leroja performed even more outstandingly than Desolate Fury. Each of them took on an entire party of six by themselves. If not for their opponents employing a Battle Array, which boosted their Basic Attributes and linked their five senses, it would have been only a matter of time before Cross and Leroja had defeated their opponents.

As for the three remaining members of Desolate Fury’s party, they were also powerful experts. Unfortunately, as they weren’t as strong as Cross and Leroja, and neither were they MTs, they got killed by the parties they fought after only a few exchanges.

“Dammit! Nothing!”

“Fuck! These bastards are wasting our time!”

The three parties responsible for killing the three members of Desolate Fury’s party cursed when they saw that their kills had only dropped three pieces of equipment. Then, they charged at Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury with angry looks.

When the three other parties saw this, they began attacking Cross, Leroja, and Desolate Fury with even greater ferocity.

“Hand that thing over, and we will spare you!”

“Yes! Hand over what you got from the Dungeon, and we will guarantee your safety!”

“That’s right! You don’t want your Basic Attributes to be permanently reduced, do you? So be good and hand us that thing!”

While looking at the three players struggling desperately to survive, the leaders of the three parties started to persuade them with words. It was obvious that they did not wish to share whatever they were looking for with the other parties.

“Do you take us for fools?” Leroja rolled her eyes in disgust at the party leaders trying to persuade them. “The day your words can be trusted will be when pigs fly!”

Their party had long discerned the personalities of the people targeting them.

Every one of these bastards was a ruthless person. Previously, several other parties had handed over their harvest to these ruthless bastards after being promised safety. In the end, all of these parties were slaughtered without exception.

“Your mouth really doesn’t match that pretty face of yours,” the Tier 4 Ranger leading the party attacking Leroja said. “Unfortunately, even though you’ve guessed correctly, you don’t get a prize for it. If you want to blame someone, blame whoever sent you from the Starlight Realm! Since they only sent a bunch of weaklings here, we naturally have to eliminate you first!”

“Do you think you can kill us? Aren’t you getting a little too confident?” Cross said, laughing. Immediately afterward, he activated a Berserk Skill and sent two of his opponents flying, breaking out of the encirclement in the blink of an eye.

In no time, Cross had put over 200 yards between himself at the party of six targeting him. However, just when he thought he had left the party of six’s attack range, a rain of swords suddenly fell on him.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of explosions rang across the street as the swords rained down on Cross. When the rain of swords ended and the dust settled, Cross’s originally unscathed body became covered in cuts and blood. His HP also plummeted to a critical level.

“You useless pieces of trash. I only had you chase after a bunch of weaklings, yet you nearly let one of them get away?”

A cold, berating voice suddenly came from over a thousand yards away, causing the players besieging Desolate Fury’s party to shrink their necks and break out in cold sweat.

“This is...” Cross turned to look at the skinny figure approaching him from a distance, his eyes full of disbelief. “The Ninth Absolute Technique, Star Rain?”

“It seems you’re quite knowledgeable,” the skinny figure said, feeling a little surprised as he looked at Cross. “Unfortunately, as you and your friends are trash from the Starlight Realm, none of you will leave this place alive. The same goes for you, you eavesdropping punk over there!”
