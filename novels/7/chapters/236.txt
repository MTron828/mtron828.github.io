Chapter 237 - If You Don’t Do Stupid Things, They Won’t Come Back and Bite You in the Ass

In the central plaza of Blackwing City, many players wandered, sightseeing. Blackwing City was a must-see destination as it had been built atop the peak of a mountain. Meanwhile, the Stargazing Tower loomed in the central plaza of the city. Through the usage of a floating platform, players could arrive at the top of the tower and witness the full beauty of Blackwing City.

Beneath the Stargazing Tower, Shi Feng located Joking Scholar.

At this moment, panic painted Joking Scholar’s face. His eyes were like searchlights as they scanned the plaza. When he finally spotted Shi Feng, he hurried over.

“Guild Leader Tyrant, the higher-ups have given me my instructions. To maintain long-term cooperations with Guild Leader Tyrant, we agree to sell the Hard Stones to you at 2 Silver Coins a stack. As long as you take these forging materials back to Star-Moon Kingdom, you can earn back at least three to four times the cost,” Joking Scholar said as he walked up to Shi Feng, a smile filling his face.

Twilight Echo had spent a lot of time to obtain these forging materials. They had even spent an impressive sum of Coins and Credits in the process. Meanwhile, their main goal was to turn these forging materials into Coins. If luck would have it, they could even make a small profit from the trade.

By the looks of it, however, that would not happen. After all, not only were the forging materials of other kingdoms and empires similarly cheap, but there was also a mysterious NPC in Blackwing City selling these materials far below bottom-line prices now. The only thing Joking Scholar could do now was turn all these forging materials into Coins, even at the cost of taking a small loss. He could then head to the Blackwing City Auction and purchase some items that would benefit the Guild’s development.

However, although ideals were wonderful, reality was very cruel.

It was clearly impossible for Shi Feng to spend hundreds of Gold to purchase these materials. Even if he had over 3,000 Gold Coins, he still wouldn’t spend it in such a way.

Not to mention, Shi Feng had spent so much effort in swindling Joking Scholar. He naturally wouldn’t stop at just 2 Silver Coins.

“Two Silver Coins a stack, now that’s what I call sincere. However, just before I came here, someone mentioned to me that they are willing to sell a large amount of Hard Stones for 1 Silver Coin a stack. Moreover, if I am willing to purchase over a thousand stacks, they will lower that price even further.” Shi Feng shook his head, feigning disinterest.

“What? One Silver Coin a stack? Who said that?” Joking Scholar was already on the brink of insanity. He had only found a large transaction after much difficulty. Now, however, someone was trying to undersell him. Moreover, that person clearly knew about the mysterious NPC selling forging materials.

If he had to sell each stack of Hard Stones for only 1 Silver Coin, he might as well take them back to his own empire and sell them there. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Yet, the various Guilds in Storm Empire, the empire Twilight Echo belonged to, was far from lacking forging materials. As for the independent players there, most were self-sufficient. As a result, the players purchasing Hard Stones were very few. On the contrary, there were plenty of players selling them. However, due to Twilight Echo’s recent mass purchase, the prices of Hard Stones in the Storm Empire had increased. Originally, 2 Silver Coins would be more than enough to purchase one stack of Hard Stones.

If these Hard Stones were forged into Whetstones, though, the demand would slightly increase.

“You will have to investigate this person yourself. If there aren’t any more matters here, I’ll be going. I still have to discuss the exact pricing with that person. If I buy several thousand stacks, I wonder if he will sell at an even lower price?” Shi Feng laughed.

“Guild Leader Tyrant, please wait a moment!” Joking Scholar hurriedly said, “If you are willing to purchase a large amount, Twilight Echo is willing to offer the same price as that person! If you are willing to buy more than 20,000 stacks, I can offer you a price of 60 Copper Coins a stack! Take it as a sign of friendship!”

Currently, Joking Scholar no longer cared about price. The only fortunate matter to him right now was the fact that Lone Tyrant had yet to discover the mysterious NPC. Although Twilight Echo would incur an astronomical loss by selling the 2,000 stacks of Hard Stones they currently had at a price of 60 Copper, they could simply purchase more Hard Stones at a price of 40 Coppers from the mysterious NPC. If they resold those Hard Stones at 60 Coppers, they would make a clean profit of 20 Coppers per stack. If they resold 18,000 stacks, they could easily recoup their losses.

Hence, Joking Scholar needed to take action quickly. If Lone Tyrant found out about this matter, he might not even be able to sell the Hard Stones he had for 40 Coppers a stack.

“Sixty Copper Coins a stack? Moreover, you guys actually have over 20,000 stacks?!” Shi Feng feigned astonishment as he spoke.

“Of course! This is our way of showing sincerity! However, you have to buy 20,000 stacks to get such a low price.” Joking Scholar nodded his head, smiling.

“Hold on a minute. I’ll ask that person what price he is willing to offer if I buy 20,000 stacks,” Shi Feng said.

Hearing that Shi Feng was about to contact the person who knew about the mysterious NPC, Joking Scholar’s panic grew. Anyone aware of this information only needed to spend as much effort as flipping a hand over in this transaction. Even if they made a profit of 1 Copper Coin per stack, they could still earn 2 Gold Coins from selling 20,000 stacks. However, Joking Scholar’s situation was different. Hence, he hurriedly shouted, “Guild Leader Tyrant, please wait a minute! I don’t wish to waste time competing with those people, so I’ll offer you a cost price of 50 Copper Coins! Take it as me trying to befriend you! However, you have to purchase 50,000 stacks! I’ll even gift you 300 stacks of Iron Ore, 400 stacks of Silver Ore, 200 stacks of Mithril Ore, 100 stacks of Gold Ore, and also a Mysterious-Iron ranked Runic Ore Bag! Nobody can offer you a lower price than me!”

“You’re offering 50 Copper Coins a stack, and they come with a gift of rare ores as well? There are even 100 stacks of Gold Ore, a high-quality ore that I have never seen before. It seems that you are indeed sincere. I doubt that the other side can offer a price lower than this. Alright, then. I’ll buy 50,000 stacks of Hard Stones from you!” Shi Feng smiled contently. He was already quite satisfied that he could purchase 2,000 stacks of Hard Stones for only 50 Copper Coins a stack.

At the expense of selling over 200 stacks of Hard Stones at a price of 40 Copper Coins a stack, he could purchase over 2,000 stacks at a price of 50 Copper Coins in return. He had made a huge profit out of this transaction. As for the remaining 48,000 stacks of Hard Stones, if Joking Scholar uncovered the truth, he would never sell him Hard Stones for such a low price again. Basically, there wouldn’t be another business transaction between him and Twilight Echo. However, Shi Feng paid no mind to this.

With this batch of forging materials, he would not run out of Hard Stones anytime soon.

“Let’s sign a contract then, Guild Leader Tyrant,” Joking Scholar took out an electronic contract. With the Main God System bearing testimony to this contract, neither party involved was allowed to violate the conditions set.

“What is the meaning of this?” Shi Feng wrinkled his brows slightly.

“Guild Leader Tyrant, this is a large transaction that involves 50,000 stacks of Hard Stones. If Guild Leader Tyrant suddenly decides not to buy the Hard Stones, wouldn’t I suffer the loss? Of course, I am not trying to question Guild Leader Tyrant’s credibility. However, to avoid any future disputes, let us be villains before nobles,” Joking Scholar explained.

“Still, isn’t there a problem with this agreement? I don’t mind that the trade has to be done within ten days, but why do I have to compensate you 5,000 Gold Coins or 50 million Credits, with Gold Coins as priority, if I renege on the contract, while you guys don’t have to pay anything if you renege on your commitment?” Shi Feng angrily said, “You call this not questioning my reputation? From the way I see it, maybe we should forget about this business transaction altogether.”

Although Shi Feng appeared angry, inwardly, he couldn’t be any happier. Originally, he had no hopes of getting the remaining 48,000 stacks of Hard Stones. He would never have thought that Joking Scholar would take such an action. Contrary to being furious, Shi Feng couldn’t help but eagerly agree to this contract! The evil one brought upon themselves truly was the hardest to bear!

“Please wait, Guild Leader Tyrant! I simply forgot to write it in! If Twilight Echo reneges on the agreement, we will similarly compensate you with 5,000 Gold Coins or 50 million Credits. Moreover, Guild Leader Tyrant can rest assured about the validity of this contract, as our Guild Leader has personally signed. The only thing remaining is Guild Leader Tyrant’s signature,” Joking Scholar hurriedly amended the agreement. He had indeed forgotten about this matter out of panic. After all, he was deeply afraid of Shi Feng discovering the mysterious NPC who sold forging materials.

However, as long as both parties signed this agreement, even if Lone Tyrant discovered this mysterious NPC, Joking Scholar had nothing to fear.

“Now, that’s more like it,” Shi Feng said with satisfaction after finding no problems with the agreement.

Shi Feng was nearly unable to suppress the excitement in his heart. After calming his excited mood down, he signed the contract.

However, Joking Scholar was far more excited than Shi Feng; his heart was about to break out of his chest. As he watched Shi Feng finally sign the agreement, the contract receiving the recognition of the Main God System, he simultaneously revealed a cold smile.
