Chapter 616 – Zero Wing’s Training

Mu Huangwu was so stunned by Azure Shadow’s words that he forgot what he was going to say. As for Xia Qingying, she similarly couldn’t help but doubt if something was wrong with her ears.

After all, just a day ago, Azure Shadow and the others had expressed strong hostilities and contempt toward Zero Wing’s training. Yet, they were now worried they might be late for training?

“Let’s talk another time! We’re going to be late!”

When Azure Shadow saw that Mu Huangwu and Xia Qingying were unresponsive, he charged out of the boarding gate without hesitation. Seeing this, the other members of the Night Watch battle group also followed suit, leaving behind Mu Huangwu in the waiting lounge.

“Can you tell me what’s going on, Qingying?” Mu Huangwu asked as he stared at the boarding gate with a stunned expression.

Anyone could tell that Azure Shadow and the others looked forward to participating in Zero Wing’s training.

But even if they were to look forward to Zero Wing’s training, it didn’t make sense for them to look forward to it that much. It should be known that it was to the extent that they prioritized it even more than becoming aces in the Night Watch Legion.

At this moment, Mu Huangwu even suspected that if Azure Shadow and the others were made to choose between joining the Night Watch Legion’s ace battle groups or participating in Zero Wing’s training, they would choose the latter without hesitation.

“This… I have no idea, either,” Xia Qingying said with a wry smile.

While she might be privy to some of Zero Wing’s secrets, she highly doubted that something like the Intermediate Divine Engraving could garner much interest from Azure Shadow and the others.

But looking at the reactions Azure Shadow and the others had toward Zero Wing’s training, it was already to a point where she could describe them as fanatical. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have cast aside Mu Huangwu just so that they could avoid being late for training.

…

Eternal Realm, Western Continent, Nameless City:

After boarding the Green God Corporation’s private plane, Azure Shadow and the others promptly hopped into the temporary virtual gaming cabins the corporation had prepared on the plane and logged into God’s Domain. Then, when they saw that Zero Wing’s members were still resting around them, they couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

Thank goodness we made it back in time, Azure Shadow thought when he saw Shi Feng sorting through items nearby.

Before arriving at the Nameless City, Azure Shadow, as someone who had trained in the Galaxy Conglomerate’s holy land in the past, felt that no other place could compare to said holy land.

However, he instantly changed his mind after arriving at the Nameless City. Compared to the Nameless City, the Galaxy Conglomerate’s holy land was nothing more than a cheap knockoff.

Every corner of the Nameless City was brimming with Eternal Energy. Simply standing in the city allowed him to experience gradual but continuous improvement. He even felt that he could achieve a breakthrough at any moment.

However, the training Shi Feng provided them was even more valuable compared to the Nameless City’s environment.

The Bronze Mana Purification Technique!

This was a technique that could allow their mana to achieve a qualitative improvement. Before today, he had never even heard of such a technique existing. Simply gaining an initial mastery over the Bronze Mana Purification Technique made him feel he could fight against Tier 6 experts fully clad in Legendary Weapons and Equipment. Yet, what was even more unbelievable was that there was something even better than the Bronze Mana Purification Technique.

Unfortunately, as he and the others weren’t internal members of Zero Wing and all of the loot they acquired belonged to Zero Wing, they currently couldn’t learn the Advanced Bronze Purification Technique. If they wanted to learn it, they would have to kill a certain number of Regional Bosses and use their contributions to exchange one.

However, while their group of seventeen was currently capable of moving independently of Zero Wing’s group, they weren’t familiar with the Nameless City’s terrain. So, it would be much more effective if they searched for Regional Bosses with Zero Wing’s group.

Not to mention, Shi Feng would demonstrate Flowing Space from time to time. This presented them with an opportunity to watch and learn a Gold Combat Technique up close.

Gold Combat Techniques were incredibly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. The various powers would treat the Gold Combat Techniques they owned as heirlooms, and they would rarely ever share these techniques with outsiders. If outsiders wished to learn these techniques, they could only do so through watching battle videos, which was a nigh-impossible task.

This was due to the complexity of Gold Combat Techniques. When players fought using Gold Combat Techniques, they would usually only utilize fragments of the technique. Unless a player was willing to thoroughly demonstrate their Gold Combat Technique, others would never be able to learn their technique’s intricacies.

Meanwhile, when Shi Feng fought, he would always execute his Gold Combat Technique from start to end for them to observe. Typically, this was a treatment only the paragons of pseudo-apex and apex powers could receive. If they were to miss this opportunity, they would absolutely regret it for the rest of their lives.

“Alright, everyone, get organized. Since everyone’s back, we’ll begin exploring the core region,” Shi Feng commanded when he saw Azure Shadow and the others returning.

After fighting and learning for the entirety of last night, Azure Shadow’s group had already mastered the Common Mana Purification Technique and begun to learn the Bronze version. With their present combat power, it would be a waste not to explore the Nameless City’s core region.

The Nameless City could be categorized into four regions: outer, inner, central, and core.

Since yesterday, they have been exploring the central region and have acquired a good harvest. Overall, they obtained 14 copies of the Advanced Bronze Purification Technique and 41 copies of the Bronze Purification Technique. Even without the help of the War Goddesses, their grinding efficiency was better than when they had the War Goddesses’ assistance.

However, for a Regional Dungeon of the Nameless City’s rank, the core region would typically have many more Regional Bosses spawning within it than in the central region. There might even be Tier 6 Divine Bosses guarding the place.

Divine Regional Bosses were incredibly rare in the Greater God’s Domain. They also had a long respawn time and were the primary target of contention between the various powers.

Meanwhile, the Nameless City had only appeared not long ago. It was still in its exploration phase, hence its monsters had such a high drop rate. If they were to miss this exploration phase, even if Zero Wing could mobilize more experts to slay the Nameless City’s Divine Regional Bosses later on, their harvest might not even come close to their harvest in the current central region.

After everyone organized themselves, they began advancing toward the Nameless City’s core region under Shi Feng’s command.

…

After four hours of constant fighting, Shi Feng and the others arrived at the Nameless City’s core region. A thin layer of mist covered the entire core region, making it impossible for those outside to see or sense the situation inside.

However, the instant everyone stepped into the mist, they promptly realized how wondrous of a location this was. The density of the Eternal Energy in the core region was more than double that of the central region.

Only, before Shi Feng and the others could take their time to enjoy the significantly denser Eternal Energy, they saw a female Swordsman of the human race running in their direction with a 1,000-man Holy Race legion chasing after her.

The Swordsman in question was incredible. Despite being only a Level 165, Tier 5 Sword Saint, she continuously neutralized the attacks launched at her by the Tier 5 Holy Race experts. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

It should be known that these Holy Race experts could rival Tier 6 human players when empowered by their Holy Auras. Moreover, over a hundred of them could attack the human female at a time. Yet, the most they managed to do was cause some minor damage to the human female.

Even experts who had mastered Gold Footwork and Defensive Combat Techniques would find difficult to achieve a similar combat performance as the human female.

“That Swordsman is amazing!” Gentle Snow exclaimed as she watched the human female repeatedly breaking out of the Holy Race players’ encirclement. “Even if Big Sis Qilin gets promoted into a Tier 6 Guardian Knight, she wouldn’t fare much better against so many Holy Race experts.”

“Billowing Water?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw who the human female was. “Why is she here?”
