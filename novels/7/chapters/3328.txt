Chapter 403 – A Swordsman Nearing Ancient Gods

“Have a seat.”

When the young man in the suit and tie saw Thousand Scars and Death Omen entering the conference room, he pointed at the sofa before him and signaled for the two to be at ease.

However, be that as it may, neither Thousand Scars nor Death Omen dared to act casually. It was especially so for Thousand Scars. Even as a three-star mental strength master, she failed to keep her emotions in check and revealed an anxious expression.

It had already been over a month since Thousand Scars joined the Paimon Conglomerate. She had also joined the conglomerate much sooner than Death Omen, so she knew much more about the conglomerate than Death Omen did.

As an outer member who was in the middle of striving to become an internal member in the Paimon Conglomerate, the chances of Thousand Scars coming across White Owl, one of the conglomerate’s Ten Great Paragons, were close to zero under normal circumstances. This was because their paths in life existed in parallel to each other.

Take the battle in the World Passage, for example. Despite being an internal reserve member, Thousand Scars didn’t even qualify to be part of the army White Owl led. Only internal paragons such as Meteor could qualify.

Apart from her status, White Owl’s strength was also something Thousand Scars greatly feared.

In Thousand Scars’s opinion, Meteor was already an incredible expert, and it would take her quite some time before she could hope to match him. However, in front of White Owl, the so-called “incredible expert” Meteor would probably last no more than one move. After all, White Owl was an expert who was only half a step from crossing the threshold of the World Tower’s fifth floor, reaching the legendary fifth-floor standard.

However, compared to White Owl, the smartly dressed young man was even more terrifying of an existence!

The Paimon Conglomerate’s Third Paragon!

Nameless Blade!

Moreover, the Nameless Blade wasn’t just the Paimon Conglomerate’s Third Paragon. At the same time, he was also the conglomerate’s Second Successor.

Indeed! Nameless Blade was one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s successors!

The likes of Dira weren’t even worthy of carrying Nameless Blade’s shoes, and even the Paimon Conglomerate’s Three Overlords needed to treat Nameless Blade with respect.

Even if Nameless Blade failed to become the Paimon Conglomerate’s helmsman in the future, he could still become a senior vice president of the Paimon Conglomerate and govern the many upper-ranking hegemonic powers subordinated to the conglomerate. Compared to the Three Overlords, who only got to manage one Tier 6 trump card legion each, his status would be much higher in the conglomerate at that time.

So, it was only natural for Thousand Scars to grow anxious after suddenly coming face-to-face with such a big shot. If she accidentally offended Nameless Blade, she could very well be banished from the various moving cities and forced to live in hardship for the rest of her life.

“No need to be nervous. Just think of me as your colleague,” Nameless Blade said with a helpless smile when he saw neither Thousand Scars nor Death Omen daring to sit down. “If you two don’t take a seat, our conversation can’t go anywhere.”

“Just sit. Mr. Blade is different from Dira,” White Owl said. “In fact, you’ll only make Mr. Blade uncomfortable if you think of him the same as Dira.”

Hearing this, Thousand Scars and Death Omen nodded and stopped being polite.

“I heard that both of you are acquainted with Black Flame.” While pouring the two tea, Nameless Blade smiled and curiously asked, “May I know if you have any detailed information on him?”

Thousand Scars and Death Omen exchanged looks with each other.

“I know more about Black Flame, so I’ll speak,” Death Omen said. Although she was curious as to why Nameless Blade would be interested in Black Flame, she chose to say everything she knew, starting from how she learned of Black Flame to how he subsequently stirred up a storm in the Miniature Ancient World…

“I see.” Nameless Blade fell into a long silence once he finished hearing Death Omen’s story. “It seems our conjecture was correct. You don’t know about Black Flame’s true identity, either.”

“We are not Zero Wing’s members, after all. We can’t probe deeper into his identity even if we wanted to,” Death Omen explained. “If anyone would know about Black Flame’s true identity, it would most likely have to be my cousin and Zero Wing’s core executives.”

“Your cousin?” Curiously, Nameless Blade asked, “May I know who your cousin is?”

“Hidden Soul!” Death Omen said venomously. “She used to be the one who took away my position as a commander in the Flower of Seven Sins, but now she is very close to Zero Wing. She also has a close relationship with Black Flame as Black Flame did not hesitate to start a war with the Flower of Seven Sins for her sake.”

“This is good news.” Nameless Blade suddenly smiled.

“Good news?” Death Omen looked at Nameless Blade in puzzlement, her mind failing to understand how this was supposed to be good news.

“I hope you two can join Zero Wing!” Nameless Blade said, getting straight to the point. “With your blood relationship with your cousin, it should be relatively easy for you to join the ranks of Zero Wing’s core executives.”

“This…” Death Omen couldn’t help but doubt her hearing when she heard Nameless Blade’s request.

It should be known that Black Flame was the villain who had not only annihilated an army of several hundred thousand strong belonging to the Paimon Conglomerate, but had also caused Dira to nearly suffer Soul Annihilation.

At this point, the Paimon Conglomerate should want nothing more than to erase Black Flame’s existence. Yet, now, Nameless Blade wanted her to let go of her past grievances to join Zero Wing, the Guild led by Black Flame? This was utterly insane!

“This is an order!” Nameless Blade strictly said, instantly changing his “request” into an order when he saw Death Omen’s reaction. “Also, you two won’t be the only ones joining Zero Wing. Once you’re in, I’ll also need you to introduce us to Zero Wing!”

“You are also joining Zero Wing, Mr. Blade?”

Thousand Scars felt that she had experienced an auditory hallucination. She could understand Nameless Blade having them join Zero Wing. After all, it was common for the various powers to use their base-level members to conduct espionage on other powers.

However, it was a different story for Nameless Blade.

The Paimon Conglomerate’s Second Successor enjoyed status few people could match or overtake in the Starlight Realm.

Yet, now, this Second Successor was humbling himself to join Zero Wing for the sake of a player named Black Flame. If these words didn’t come directly from Nameless Blade’s mouth, Thousand Scars would have never believed them.

It should be known that the current Zero Wing wasn’t even a hegemonic power in the Starlight Realm. What qualifications did Zero Wing have to get a peerless paragon from the Paimon Conglomerate to join it?

“Definitely. This is also my goal in coming to Star Lake City,” Nameless Blade said. Then, revealing a wry smile, he continued, “You have no idea how big of a price I had to pay to snatch this opportunity.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“You had to?pay?a price to come here?” Death Omen was astonished.

Logically, there should be nothing outside the reach of a successor of the Paimon Conglomerate. Yet, Nameless Blade was saying that he had to make significant sacrifices to come to a backwater city like Star Lake City? For a moment, Death Omen couldn’t help but doubt her worldview.

White Owl remained quiet when she saw Death Omen’s response. The matter regarding Black Flame currently remained top secret even within the Paimon Conglomerate, so she didn’t have the authority to reveal information on the matter. That was something up to Nameless Blade to decide.

“...I guess it’ll be alright to tell you two now since this matter won’t be a secret in the future,” Nameless Blade said, sighing. Then, he retrieved a document from his briefcase and put it on the table, saying, “Take a look at it yourselves. However, remember never to share what you see with anyone else. Otherwise, the consequences will be beyond your ability to bear!”

Hearing Nameless Blade’s words, Death Omen and Thousand Scars couldn’t help but hesitate as they looked at the document on the table.

If they looked at the document, they would most definitely be burdened with a heavy responsibility that came with severe consequences. Yet, they would be plagued by curiosity if they chose not to read the document. They also felt they would be letting something important pass by them.

Let’s take a risk!

Ultimately, Death Omen and Thousand Scars decided to see what secrets Zero Wing held that would necessitate a big shot like Nameless Blade to make a personal visit to Star Lake City.

Around a dozen minutes later, Death Omen and Thousand Scars became completely silent.

That person is actually a Swordsman nearing Ancient Gods?
