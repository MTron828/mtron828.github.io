Chapter 915 – Because I Am Stronger

“Did I mishear?”

“Heavens! Does she want to fall out with Angel’s Retribution?!”

“Madness! This is madness! Who is that guy?! How can he get Miss Frey to go to such lengths for him?!”

Everyone present was a member of a major power, so they knew that nobody would casually offend a pseudo-apex power, much less do so for an outsider. Such behavior was extremely irrational in God’s Domain.

It should be known that Crocodile Fang represented Angel’s Retribution. Frey driving him out of Desolate Star City was tantamount to slapping Angel’s Retribution in the face. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say she was making an enemy of Angel’s Retribution.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, what is your relationship with Miss Frey?” Drifting Bean asked, staring at Shi Feng in astonishment. “Why is she willing to help you to such an extent?”

Xia Qingying and Endless Scars also looked at Shi Feng, finding it incredible that a big shot like Frey would thoroughly offend Angel’s Retribution for the Guild Leader of a small Guild. If Shi Feng were to say that nothing was going on between him and Frey, nobody would believe him.

“Miss Frey?” Crocodile Fang was stupefied, his eyes filled with confusion as he looked at Frey.

Although Crocodile Fang knew that Frey shared close ties with Shi Feng, he had thought that Frey would, at worst, give him a harsh admonishment. Hence, he dared to say what he did to Drifting Bean. It was to remind Frey not to offend Angel’s Retribution for the sake of a guest.

Crocodile Fang had never expected Frey to be willing to thoroughly offend Angel’s Retribution for Shi Feng. This was insanity.

“Take them away! I don’t want to see them in Desolate Star City in the future!” Frey ordered Shuoyun, not bothering to even glance at Crocodile Fang.

“This…” Shuoyun was also confused by this situation, and she couldn’t help but turn to Lunar River.

Frey might be one of Desolate Star City’s highest authorities, but even King’s Paradise would have to properly consider whether it wanted to provoke a power like Angel’s Retribution. Furthermore, this issue occurred in Desolate Star City, the mobile city controlled by King’s Paradise, so Shuoyun felt it would be wiser to let Lunar River make the final decision.

“Big Sis River, could this be a mistake? I am here on King’s Paradise’s invitation!” Crocodile Fang said, looking at Lunar River with an ugly expression. “If I am driven out, there won’t be any further negotiations between us!”

Crocodile Fang knew speaking with Frey was meaningless at this point, so he could only pin his hopes on Lunar River. If he truly was driven out of Desolate Star City, it would be a huge embarrassment for him.

“I already said that Frey has the final say,” Lunar River said to Shuoyun, ignoring Crocodile Fang’s words.

Shuoyun no longer held any doubts after hearing Lunar River’s words. Even so, the shock she felt did not decrease in the slightest. On the contrary, these words intensified it.

As a member of King’s Paradise, Shuoyun knew that King’s Paradise did not have any relationship with Shi Feng. She also knew Lunar River was acquainted with Angel’s Retribution’s current Guild Leader. Yet, for Shi Feng’s sake, or more specifically, for Frey’s sake, Lunar River was willing to offend Angel’s Retribution. This was a very confusing situation.

“Why are you still standing there?” Lunar River glared at Shuoyun.

“Understood!” Shuoyun snapped out of her daze and had the other head attendants nearby surround Crocodile Fang’s group.

“Big Sis River! Are you going to destroy the long relationship between our two Guilds for some outsiders?!” Crocodile Fang panicked when he saw the approaching head attendants. He felt Lunar River must be out of her mind to choose to abandon King’s Paradise’s partnership with Angel’s Retribution to befriend Frey.

“Shuoyun, take them away!” Lunar River said, acting as if she did not hear Crocodile Fang as she had Shuoyun escort Crocodile Fang’s group to the airport. Her nonchalant expression also made it seem like what she had just done was something trivial.

Ultimately, Crocodile Fang could only leave the auction venue in shock and frustration. He had never expected Lunar River to drive him out without hesitation. He felt that she must have truly lost her mind.

What Crocodile Fang didn’t know was that Lunar River didn’t do all this to gain Frey’s favor. Instead, she had done it for Shi Feng, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader.

Originally, Lunar River believed that the Red Dragon Nation and Azure Fang were the true owners of Shadowring Town with Zero Wing serving as a front. Although Frey had stated otherwise, Lunar River had been skeptical.

However, after seeing Frey’s attitude toward Shi Feng, Lunar River felt that Shadowring Town might genuinely be under Zero Wing’s control.

“As expected of one of the most popular figures in the current Greater God’s Domain. Even Desolate Star City’s administrator is willing to do Miss Frey such a huge favor,” Xia Qingying exclaimed softly as she watched Crocodile Fang and Xiao Quan getting escorted out of the auction venue. Then, she turned to the silent Shi Feng and asked, “Guild Leader Black Flame, you couldn’t have gotten some dirt on Miss Frey, right? Otherwise, why would she stand on your side so decisively?”

As the person who had brought Shi Feng into the Greater World, Xia Qingying felt that she knew plenty about him. Based on what she knew, it should be impossible for him to have anything to do with Frey. After all, one stayed in Star Lake City this entire time, while the other stayed in Galaxy City, one of the best first-tier mobile cities in the Greater World. The two were worlds apart in status.

If Xia Qingying had to come up with a reason for Frey to side with Shi Feng, it would be that Shi Feng had blackmail material on Frey.

Endless Scars also couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng curiously.

Frey was the spokesperson of the Red Dragon Nation, an existence that rivaled the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. Even the Grand Elders of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce would have difficulty getting such staunch support from her.

“I don’t have anything like that,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head with a smile. “As for why Miss Frey is willing to help me, I can think of only one reason.”

“What is it?” Xia Qingying grew even more curious.

Frey stood at the top of the Greater God’s Domain in status. It wasn’t easy to convince someone like her to provide help to such an extent. When Xia Qingying put herself in Frey’s shoes, she couldn’t think of any reason to offend Angel’s Retribution, a pseudo-apex power as strong as the Red Dragon Nation, for Shi Feng.

“It’s because I am stronger than them!” Shi Feng said confidently.
