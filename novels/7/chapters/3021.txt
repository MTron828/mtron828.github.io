Chapter 96 – Holy Land

The Abyssal Star Ancient City wasn’t very large, its size was only that of an Advanced Town. Unlike an Advanced Town, though, the ancient city was surrounded by a circle of tall walls.

The moment Shi Feng and Hidden Soul stepped into the city, they could instantly feel the mysterious energy in their bodies disappearing rapidly. The speed at which the mysterious energy dissipated here was more than double what they experienced when resting in the hotels of NPC Cities.

“How amazing. The core magic array still isn’t in operation, yet not only does it have Mana concentration rivaling NPC Cities, but it also has such a powerful cleansing effect. Is this the power of a primordial city?” Hidden Soul exclaimed when she noticed the changes to her body after entering a city.

There was a huge difference between a city with its core magic array activated and a city with its core magic array deactivated. Meanwhile, this was the first time she had seen a city with such powerful effects even with its core magic array deactivated.

Unlike Hidden Soul, Shi Feng took this situation calmly. As one of the nine ancient cities built by the Ancient Demon Gods, the functions Hidden Soul had stated were nothing but the tip of the iceberg. This was because every Ancient Legacy City of the Second Sequence would already possess environments rivaling the holy lands in God’s Domain in its initial stage.

Sometime later, Shi Feng arrived at the heart of Abyssal Star City with Hidden Soul.

Situated at the city’s heart was an ancient tower that extended up to 500 meters into the air. Meanwhile, situated at the top of the tower was a dazzling rune, the rune acting like a lamp that illuminated the entire city.

However, this ancient tower wasn’t just a simple lighthouse. Instead, the stronghold held the Abyssal Star Ancient City’s secrets.

Of the nine Ancient Legacy Cities the Ancient Demon Gods left behind, every one of them possessed a different ability. As an example, the Legacy stored within the ancient city Zero Wing obtained during Shi Feng’s previous life was related to Concentration, and it could help players improve their Concentration rapidly. Thanks to this Legacy, the number of Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts Zero Wing possessed far surpassed that of other Guilds.

Meanwhile, shortly after Shi Feng and Hidden Soul walked into the ancient tower, they were quickly dumbfounded by what they found.

When they entered the tower’s first floor, the first thing that greeted them was a row of tightly shut stone doors, and every one of these doors had strange symbols engraved on them. Then, after opening a few of these doors, they found that beyond each of these stone doors was a miniature world.

Indeed! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A miniature world!

Every one of these miniature worlds had a unique environment. Or, more specifically, players could freely set the environment they desired in these rooms. They could set the room to become a world filled with only a specific type of Mana. They could also set it so that the Mana was excited or calm.

One could say that these rooms were the ideal training ground for players to improve their control over Mana!

Incredible… The Legacy in this city is truly terrifying. Shi Feng was shocked beyond words as he looked at the many stone doors on the tower’s first floor.

The Mana in God’s Domain was a composite of various types of Mana. It didn’t consist of just one specific type of Mana. However, when players used Skills and Spells, they would often use only one specific type of Mana. Meanwhile, depending on how much Mana of that specific type they managed to accumulate, the speed of their spellcasting and the power of their Spells would be completely different.

If players stood in an environment that possessed only one type of Mana, the ambient Mana would greatly help them if they were to use Skills or Spells of the same type. It was especially true when it came to mastering the operating principles of that specific Mana type.

It should be known that after reaching Tier 5, players would need to understand the operating principles of the various types of Mana in order to construct their Divine Body and reach Tier 6. However, the process of learning these operating principles was incredibly challenging since players couldn’t typically see or touch Mana. They could only rely on their other senses to perceive it. The fact that ambient Mana was a composite of various Mana types made things even more challenging.

However, the miniature worlds here provided the solution to this problem. By allowing players to filter the ambient Mana around them to just one specific type, these miniature worlds could reduce the difficulty players faced in understanding Mana by more than tenfold.

After calming his excited heart, Shi Feng couldn’t help but turn toward Hidden Soul, who was still in a daze. Then, he smiled and asked, “Now that you’ve seen this city’s abilities, what do you think of my proposal?”

“Are you sure you want to put me in charge of this city?” Hidden Soul asked after snapping out of her daze.

She’d be lying if she said she wasn’t interested in the Abyssal Star Ancient City. To be precise, no player wouldn’t be interested in this city.

What was her goal in obtaining the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique?

Wasn’t it so that she could better understand and control Mana?

Meanwhile, the Abyssal Star Ancient City provided an unbelievable training environment to improve her learning efficiency by more than tenfold. How could she possibly refuse the chance to make use of this training environment?

“Since I am having you establish a mercenary organization with this city as its base, I will naturally leave this city’s responsibility with you,” Shi Feng said, nodding without hesitation.

Had he summoned only a Third Sequence Town, he might have had a way of letting Zero Wing defend it.

However, a Second Sequence City was no longer something the current Zero Wing could defend. After all, the existence of this city would be revealed to the entire Miniature Ancient World in ten days.

The only solution Shi Feng could think of to retain ownership over the city was having Hidden Soul step forward as its governor. After all, the Flower of Seven Sins was an existence no weaker than the Five Great Super Guilds.

Of course, Shi Feng also had other solutions to defend the Abyssal Star Ancient City if need be. However, not only would there be no benefits for him in doing so, but revealing these methods would also attract a bunch of trouble to him.

“I’ll say it upfront. If all you want me to do is form a mercenary alliance to guard the Abyssal Star Ancient City, it won’t be difficult to do so. I can even contact a group of powerful experts to help us right now,” Hidden Soul said after pondering for some time. “But the real problem is those superpowers. If they learn of the benefits of this city, they might dispatch Tier 6 God-ranked experts here. In my current state, there is nothing I can do against them.”

Previously, she had refused Shi Feng’s offer because she thought that Shi Feng was merely establishing a Guild Town. If that were the case, the mercenary alliance she established wouldn’t attract many independent experts to join. It was especially true for the independent experts she was acquainted with. Every one of them was incredibly prideful, and they showed no interest whatsoever even when the various Super Guilds offered them an advisory position in their respective Guilds. There was no way they would help defend a measly Guild Town just for some meager leveling resources.

However, it was a different story if the target of defense was the Abyssal Star Ancient City. With what the city had to offer, she was confident she could persuade her acquaintances to join her. She could even use this chance to reclaim her position in the Flower of Seven Sins.

Unfortunately, with the standards of her and her acquaintances, there was nothing they could do if the various superpowers decided to dispatch Tier 6 God-ranked experts. It was especially so when they might have to face more than one Tier 6 God-ranked expert.

“Don’t worry about that. I’ll step forward if God-ranked experts come,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.
