Chapter 2726 – Battle of Monsters

With Shi Feng as the center, a dark space with a 1,000-yard radius enveloped the Advanced Resource Node and its surroundings. The Mana inside the dark space flowed so rapidly that even ordinary players could sense the flux.

The feeling of devastation and oppression this dark space gave off made even the audience in the distant spectator stands fearful.

“How can such a powerful Mana Domain exist?”

“Even the Mana Domain of Superior Mythics isn’t this strong!”

“The Advanced Magic Barrier shattered? Shouldn’t Mana Domains be weaker than magic barriers?”

Many of the major powers spectating from the VIP viewing rooms had knowledge of Mana Domains. Some of them had even experienced one before. However, compared to what they had seen and experienced, Shi Feng’s Mana Domain was on a completely different level.

So, this is his Mana Domain?

Muxin, who stood near Shi Feng, was stunned right now. When she looked at Shi Feng again, she felt as if she was seeing him for the first time.

She had heard from Frost Heaven’s deceased foreign aid that Shi Feng’s Mana Domain was incredibly powerful.

However, the Mana Domain before her was not just powerful but a whole new ball game altogether. Shi Feng’s Mana Domain had essentially created a world of its own, and within this world, he controlled everything.

In this space, Tier 3 experts were basically ants in front of Shi Feng! Meanwhile, Sandstorm hovering in midair was dumbfounded when he saw Shi Feng’s astonishing Mana Domain. A player’s Mana Domain can actually be this strong? Sandstorm’s heart roiled with doubts as he felt the strong repulsive force coming from all directions.

Shi Feng’s Mana Domain was much stronger than that of Superior Mythics. Even after transforming into his Demidragon form and gaining a Tier 4 physique and Basic Attributes, Sandstorm still suffered a significant restriction in his movements.

By his estimates, he had lost around 20% of his Basic Attributes. His reaction speed and Movement Speed had also fallen by 30%. Now, his overall combat power was barely at the Tier 4 standard.

“Let’s get started, then.” After glancing at Lina and the other Demidragons, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and vanished. “Where did he go?”

Shi Feng’s sudden disappearance confused Frost Heaven’s members.

“He disappeared?”

At this moment, let alone Frost Heaven’s members, even the audience in the spectator stands were stunned.

A living human had actually disappeared from their godlike perspective.

However, before anyone could react, an explosion suddenly sounded in midair. Boom!

The next moment, a black shadow crashed into the ground, the impact creating cracks that extended over 20 yards. The frightening shockwave nearly toppled the nearby Frost Heaven members.

“What happened?”

Everyone gaped in shock when they saw the figure on the ground, their eyes wide with disbelief.

Without anyone realizing it, Shi Feng had appeared amid the flock of hovering Demidragons, fresh blood coating his longsword.

Meanwhile, the figure on the ground actually belonged to a Demidragon. At this moment, not only did this Demidragon’s armor sport a bone-deep cut, but one-eighth of his HP had vanished.

The speed of Shi Feng’s attack was simply unheard-of!

However, compared to the audience and Frost Heaven members, the Mythology members spectating the fight were much more surprised by this situation, especially Sandstorm. A hint of confusion lingered in his eyes as he glared at Shi Feng

After transforming into our Demidragon form, with the combat array’s buff, we wouldn’t lose even 3% of our HP after taking a direct hit from a Mythic monster. How can Black Flame have such great Strength? Fear surfaced in Sandstorm’s eyes as he analyzed the situation.

As Demidragons, they could be considered bona fide Tier 4 combatants. Yet, even in such a situation, they still were no match for Shi Feng. Sandstorm simply couldn’t fathom how much Strength Shi Feng had.

As expected of the Demidragon Bloodline combined with an Advanced Combat Array’s assistance. It’ll be difficult to finish one of them quickly. When Shi Feng looked at the Demidragon on the ground, he was slightly surprised. Although he didn’t use any Skills or Spells in his attack, he wielded a Fragmented Legendary Weapon and wore several Fragmented Legendary items. In terms of the Strength Attribute, he already rivaled Superior Mythics of the same level.

This was why he could slay Tier 3 players effortlessly. However, despite having such Basic Attributes, he had only managed to take away one-eighth of the Demidragon’s HP with his normal attack. The Defense of the Demidragon he targeted could rival that of Superior Mythics.

“Everyone, don’t get entangled with him! His Attributes and speed are above ours! All we need to do is deplete his Stamina and Concentration!” Lina commanded calmly and without hesitation. “Maintain your distances! Jack, prioritize protecting our healers! He definitely won’t last long in a protracted

battle!”

“Understood!” Lina’s command boosted the Demidragons’ fighting spirit, and they promptly went into action.

With Lina taking the lead, five Demidragons surrounded and attacked Shi Feng. In addition, one Demidragon Oracle stood at the rear, casting Defensive Spells and Buff Spells one after another, boosting the other Demidragons’ Attributes.

No longer having to worry about taking damage, the five Demidragons in the vanguard fought Shi Feng desperately, intending to trade blow for blow. Moreover, the five of them had excellent coordination, moving as one.

For a time, explosions continually shook the earth and sky. Countless afterimages also danced across the sky.

The Tier 3 experts in the spectator stands were stupefied. They couldn’t tell what was going on at all. They couldn’t even tell which afterimage belonged to whom. They only saw some of the brief clashes at best. Of the spectators watching the fight, only those in the VIP viewing rooms could get a clear picture, thanks to the spectator interface’s slow-motion mode.

The five vanguard Demidragons perfectly merged their Skills, Spells, and combat techniques. They also had perfect coordination with one another. When one of them exposed a chink in their defense from clashing with Shi Feng, the others would immediately attack, preventing him from landing a fatal blow. As the clash continued, the expressions of Muxin and the other Frost Heaven members also grew darker. Although the two sides seemed evenly matched, Shi Feng had to deal with the seven Demidragons’ back-and-forth offensive all by himself. He had no time to rest at all. His Stamina and Concentration consumption were far greater than Mythology’s seven Demidragons’. At this rate, Shi Feng would run out of Stamina and Concentration before Lina and the others did.

“Black Flame, you will lose for sure this time! While we aren’t a match for you by ourselves, how long can you possibly last against our joint assault?” Sandstorm grew increasingly excited as the fight went on.

Although he had suffered plenty of attacks from Shi Feng and lost a lot of HP, he continuously received healing from the rear-line healers. Hence, he quickly recovered the HP he lost.

“Black Flame, you can’t blame us for bullying you with numbers. It’s your fault for not having anyone capable of backing you up,” the tall man beside Sandstorm said, laughing. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At these words, Frost Heaven’s members lowered their heads in shame.

Against such strength, Tier 3 experts like themselves were nothing but jokes. They wouldn’t even qualify to be distractions. After all, they couldn’t keep up with these people’s speeds.

“It seems this is Zero Wing’s limit.”

“However, it’s already plenty amazing that Black Flame managed to last this long. It’s a pity there aren’t any capable combatants among Frost Heaven’s members. Otherwise, they could’ve put up a fight against Mythology.”

Many of the spectating major powers couldn’t help pitying Shi Feng. He clearly possessed inhuman strength that even Mythology had to be wary of.

Unfortunately, the gap between the Five Great Super Guilds and the other superpowers was simply too massive. Even if all of Frost Heaven’s participants were there right now, they still wouldn’t be able to threaten Lina’s group of seven.

“However, this is a valiant defeat for Black Flame. He can actually hold his ground against seven Tier 4 monsters simultaneously. He deserves his title of Sword King!”

“Sword King? As I see it, he’s strong enough to rank within the top six of the God’s Domain Experts List. Only the Five Great Super Guilds’ old monsters can fight him.” Many of the Tier 3 experts spectating the fight admired Shi Feng. Those that previously held doubts about his title of Sword King also stopped doubting him.

The seconds and minutes flew by. While everyone was feeling unreconciled for Shi Feng, the man himself suddenly leaped backward, distancing himself from the five vanguard Demidragons.

“Don’t even think of escaping us! We have wings! We are by no means slower than you when it comes to flying!”

Upon seeing Shi Feng pulling away, Sandstorm immediately accelerated, chasing after him.

When players gained a Mana Domain, they became capable of flight. However, flight achieved through this method was significantly slower than Flying Mounts. In comparison, Demidragons could fly nearly as fast as Flying Mounts.“Escape?” Shaking his head, Shi Feng said, “I just thought that time is almost up, so I plan to end this battle.” “You’re still arrogant even in the face of death! I want to see how exactly you’re going to end this battle!” Sandstorm sped up at Shi Feng’s words.

Time is almost up? Lina felt that something was amiss when she saw Shi Feng’s calm expression. What does he mean?

However, before Lina could ponder on the matter, Shi Feng sheathed the Abyssal Blade.

“You said before that I shouldn’t blame you for bullying using numbers. I very much agree with this point.” Gazing at Sandstorm and the other Demidragons, Shi Feng unsheathed the other longsword hung by his waist and said, “Now, you shouldn’t blame me, either, for bullying with numbers!”

After Shi Feng finished speaking, the Twilight Blade in his hand suddenly shone brightly, illuminating a radius of several thousand yards.

Twilight’s Shadow!

Twilight of the Gods!

The next moment, eight physical phantoms split out from Shi Feng’s body, every phantom identical to him.
