Chapter 351 - Original Sin

“He didn’t fall for the bait?” Red Feather was slightly surprised when he saw Shi Feng’s contemptuous gaze.

Indeed, he had planned to trick Shi Feng all along. After Shi Feng approached him, he would kill Shi Feng, gaining easier access to the dropped items.

When people were desperate, they would grasp at even the tiniest bit of hope. This was a basic human instinct, and Red Feather had sought to take advantage of this. For many, even if they knew they were being cheated, they would still choose the risk.

However, what about Shi Feng?

Currently, tens of thousands of players surrounded Shi Feng in all directions. Even a fly could not escape.

Simply put, Shi Feng had zero hope of escaping alive.

Faced with such overwhelming numbers, any normal person would have long since broken down from the pressure. Even Red Feather could not guarantee that he would not be affected. No ordinary person could endure the condemnation of thousands, not to mention the murderous gazes of tens of thousands. Yet, even in such a situation, Shi Feng seemed unaffected in the slightest. Shi Feng even had the spare time to send him a contemptuous gaze....

Red Feather started to wonder whether or not Shi Feng was a human. Shi Feng could actually maintain such calm.

“However, even if you don’t take my bait, you still won’t escape.” Although Red Feather felt somewhat disappointed, his intention to kill Shi Feng had not changed.

Fire and arrows blotted out the sky above Shi Feng. Even though he was Level 34 now and possessed a severe level suppression over the other players, he still would not survive these attacks.

Not a single person present believed that Shi Feng could leave this place alive.

In the next moment, however, Shi Feng confused everyone.

At this crucial moment, Shi Feng activated Defensive Blade and continued to pick up drops. One after another, he placed the items in his bag, showing that he valued money more than his own life.

Many players expressed their confusion.

“Does Black Flame really think he can escape?”

“Does Black Flame believe that, as long as he claims the loot, those items will not drop after he dies?”

However, Shi Feng still smiled faintly. He paid no attention to the incoming attacks.

Following which, wave after wave of spells and arrows landed within 20 yards around Shi Feng, transforming the area into an ocean of ice and fire. Meanwhile, all players within this 20-yard radius turned into ash; Shi Feng was no exception.

“Hahaha! Black Flame! Finally!” Lone Tyrant laughed psychotically as he watched Shi Feng turn into particles of light. Although Lone Tyrant had not done the deed personally, when the news of Black Flame’s death spread, he would definitely become the laughingstock of God’s Domain.

Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, Black Flame, had actually thrown his life away because of greed. What could be more ironic than this?

“Wait, none of the items Black Flame picked have dropped!” a player with powerful eyesight suddenly shouted in surprise.

Hearing this, a realization struck the crowd.

Indeed, just as the player had said, although Black Flame had died, the number of items on the ground had not increased. Rather, there even seemed to be a few more pieces missing.

What was happening?

Did this mean that there was no two-hour wait to claim the loot from the Mechanical Slayer?

At this moment, Lone Tyrant was stunned as well. His eyes were glued to the location where Shi Feng had died. However, no matter how hard he racked his mind, he could not figure out what had happened.

Even if there really was no two-hour waiting time for the dropped items, as a Red Name, Black Flame should have at least dropped a few pieces of the equipment he wore upon death. Yet, he had not dropped a single item after he died.

“Big Brother Red, this is bad! If the items don’t drop from a player’s inventory, it will be far more difficult to steal them!” Flourishing Willow panicked.

“Since that is the case, we’ll grab as many as we can. Let’s go.”

Originally, they had prepared their path of retreat. However, he never would have expected that the drops from the Mechanical Slayer would play such a trick on them, destroying his plans. As for whether Shi Feng had actually died or not, Red Feather had no doubts. Thousand of attacks had bombarded the area, and any stealth effects would have been useless. Moreover, even in the very end, he had not seen Shi Feng activate any skills.

“Brothers, attack! Don’t let the powerful Guilds take the drops! As long as we put the drops into our bags, the items will be ours!”

Originally, the independent players had only intended to observe. They had no plans to compete for the loot. After all, without a Guild protecting them, the moment they picked up an item would be the moment they lost their lives. At that time, not only would they lose the items they picked up, but they would also lose their own equipment and levels. Only a lunatic would try their luck. However, the situation had changed.

Black Flame had picked up so many items as everyone watched, yet, after he died, not a single item that he had picked up had dropped. This showed that the Slayer’s loot would belong to whoever picked them up.

Previously, none of the independent players saw any chances or hope of obtaining an item for themselves. Now that there was a glimmer of hope of obtaining a Fine-Gold or even Dark-Gold item, why wouldn’t they be excited?

Suddenly, the tens of thousands of players went into a frenzy. They frantically launched spells and attacks towards the dropped items, barring anyone from claiming the loot.

Unknowingly, the largest war in the entire Star-Moon Kingdom, no, in the entire God’s Domain, had begun in White River City. The battle was a complete mess. Even great experts could not play much of a role in a war involving tens of thousands of players. They might even find it difficult to survive.

“Big Brother Shadow Sword, should we try for some of the drops as well? We might grab ourselves a Dark-Gold item! If we’re lucky, we might even get an Epic item! If we do, we won’t have to worry about futures anymore,” Turtledove said in excitement. Currently, she stood on a rooftop far from the battlefield.

A war of this magnitude would shock anyone. They would find themselves wanting to join the battle and display their skills and obtain some treasures while they’re at it.

“Alright, we’ll try out luck.” As a person who pursued combat techniques, Shadow Sword would certainly not miss out on this golden opportunity. Although Shi Feng had warned them not to involve themselves, Shadow Sword had to agree with Turtledove’s suggestion.

If they could be like Shi Feng, grabbing thirty to forty items for themselves, even if they died, it would be an admirable death. After all, facing the attacks of tens of thousands of players, even the top ranking expert on the Secret Pavilion’s Experts List, the Undefeated God, could not possibly survive.

“For your own good, I advise you two not to go. Even if you snatch an item, you won’t get anything after you die.”

At this moment, a calm and indifferent voice reached Turtledove and Shadow Sword’s ears.

When the two heard this voice and promptly turned their heads towards the source, shock immediately appearing on their faces.

“You... How did you resurrect?” Turtledove gaped at Shi Feng with disbelief. Currently, Shi Feng still wore his Black Cloak, a calm expression on his face.

“Resurrect? I never died, so why would I need to resurrect?” Shi Feng chuckled.

Making one-way trips was not brave, but stupid. Since he had charged into battle, naturally, he had long since prepared an escape.

Before Shi Feng had charged towards the Mechanical Slayer, he had already activated Phantom Kill. He had then sent his doppelganger away from the battlefield while he forged ahead to steal both the last hit and the treasure. After he had his fill, he immediately swapped positions with his doppelganger, letting his doppelganger endure the rain of attacks while he departed from the battlefield.

“You didn’t die? How is this possible? I saw countless spells hit before you turned into particles of light and disappeared.” Turtledove walked up to Shi Feng, her bright eyes scanning his body. After an extensive examination, she revealed a look that said, “You can’t deceive me.”

Shi Feng laughed and said, “That’s only a doppelganger.”

“Doppelganger?” Originally, Turtledove had not believed Shi Feng in the slightest. However, at the mention of the word “doppelganger,” she suddenly understood the gist of the situation, feeling slightly shocked. She never expected that Shi Feng would have planned an escape.

However, Shadow Sword was far more shocked by this revelation.

With only the use of a doppelganger, Shi Feng had managed to toy with the tens of thousands of players present, causing them to start a massacre.

If Shadow Sword and Turtledove knew that Shi Feng had come to this tall building to look for an opportunity to re-enter the battlefield....

At this moment, Shi Feng sat quietly before calling up the system interface for the Seven Luminaries Ring.

“Finally, I can level these skills.” Shi Feng looked at the seven great skills displayed on the Seven Luminaries Ring interface, growing excited.

Even at Level 1, these seven skills were immensely beneficial. If he could level these skills several times, his combat power would definitely reach the next level. It would also significantly assist with his class change quest.
