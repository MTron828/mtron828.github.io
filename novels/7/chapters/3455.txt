Chapter 530 – Legend Re-emerges

As Shi Feng hovered in mid-air, the space caught within the illusory world he summoned repeatedly collapsed and mended itself, and this illusory world continuously expanded as time went on. In just three seconds, the illusory world had already covered a radius of several thousand yards, and it actively butted heads with Nightmare Chaser’s illusory world.

“He also has a Pseudo-Advanced Law Projection?!”

“Incredible! He actually reached Tier 6!”

“That’s not the point. This is a Pseudo-Advanced Law Projection we are talking about. The formation of one requires complete mastery over three Basic Laws. Not only is Black Flame a Golden Master, but he has also mastered three Basic Laws at such a young age. Is he a monster?”

Many of the various ordinary hegemonic powers’ executives and upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ experts were greatly shocked to see Shi Feng’s Law Projection matching Nightmare Chaser’s Law Projection in strength.

Although the strength categorization of Law Projections was a secret to most Tier 5 and Tier 6 players, executives of ordinary hegemonic powers and experts of upper-ranking hegemonic powers could still find out about it so long as they were well-connected.

Meanwhile, it should be known that Law Projections were different from Gold Combat Techniques. The use of Law Projections required players to have sufficient understanding and control over the magical elements, while the use of Gold Combat Techniques required players to have sufficient understanding and control over their bodies. The two couldn’t even be put in the same category.

Normally, just being able to master one of these two things to a high standard could already put a player at the Greater God’s Domain’s apex. As for mastering both, that was something most players didn’t even dare to dream of accomplishing.

“It seems the three upper-ranking hegemonic powers are in trouble,” One Step said as he looked at the two godlike existences clashing above Abyssal Star City. “Black Flame is just too strong. If this stalemate continues, even if the three upper-ranking hegemonic powers can win, it will be a pyrrhic victory. By the time the other upper-ranking hegemonic powers are ready to mobilize their experts, the Hades Society, Primal Empire, and Sacred Tribe will lose their ability to compete for the Miniature Ancient World.”

“No wonder the Desolate Star Corporation’s successor, Maria, insisted on partnering with Zero Wing at all costs,” Melissa said, nodding in agreement with One Step. At the same time, she couldn’t help but grow a little envious of Maria’s insightful decision. “Now that Abyssal Star City has Black Flame defending it, so long as the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers aren’t crazy, they will try to avoid fighting Black Flame as much as possible. And with Abyssal Star City’s status in the Miniature Ancient World, it won’t have trouble making Star Coins in the future.”

Star Coins were indispensable to any power or corporation operating in the real world. They were especially important in the cultivation of geniuses. After all, God’s Domain’s resources were not enough to offer geniuses comprehensive growth. They would also need to complement these in-game resources with real-world resources such as potions. Meanwhile, these real-world resources cost a lot of Star Coins.

Without sufficient Star Coins, no matter how powerful a power was in God’s Domain, its future achievements would be limited. There were even many examples of promising powers with meteoric rises disappearing from God’s Domain because they lacked the channels to earn Star Coins.

Now that the Miniature Ancient World had become a rest stop in the Void Sea for multiple Realms, any player operating nearby would definitely choose to enter the Miniature Ancient World and rest in its cities. After all, there were very few places for players to rest in the Void Sea, and fortresses in the Void Sea were always overcrowded.

Once the Void Sea’s players started entering the Miniature Ancient World, the Guild Cities situated near the Miniature Ancient World’s entrance were bound to be the first choice for these players to visit. At that time, even if these Guild Cities only charged an entrance fee of ten or twenty Star Coins, they could still make a killing. They might even be more profitable than the fortresses found in the Void Sea by virtue of Guild Cities being larger than fortresses.

While the players in Abyssal Star City were in shock, Nightmare Chaser suddenly distanced himself from Shi Feng.

“You are very strong, Guild Leader Black Flame. All of us have underestimated you,” Nightmare Chaser said, offering praise to Shi Feng without reservation. “With your strength, you are qualified to occupy a portion of the Miniature Ancient World. If you are willing to cooperate with us, I can promise you on behalf of the Hades Society, Primal Empire, and Sacred Tribe that we will not only have a truce but also return Withered Sea City to you. I am sure you are aware that neither of us will benefit from continuing this battle. It will only benefit the other upper-ranking hegemonic powers that will come in the future. The wisest choice to make here would be for us to cooperate.”

Many players were surprised by Nightmare Chaser’s sudden proposal. Both sides had already fought to such an extent, yet Nightmare Chaser was now taking the initiative to offer not only a ceasefire but also a partnership.

However, everyone also understood why Nightmare Chaser had made such a decision.

Whether it was the previous Zero Wing or the Asura Mercenary Alliance, neither was qualified to occupy a portion of the Miniature Ancient World. However, all of that changed following Black Flame’s appearance.

Meanwhile, be it in the real world or in God’s Domain, there were no permanent enemies, only permanent interests.

“You were the ones to pick a fight, yet you are now talking about cooperating? Aren’t you people thinking too highly of yourselves?” Shi Feng coldly said as he looked at Nightmare Chaser.

“You’d better think it through, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Nightmare Chaser calmly said. “If you think we are afraid of you, then you are dead wrong. You should be aware that no good would come out of a fight between our two sides. If I want to, I can even eliminate everyone here except you. At that time, neither Zero Wing nor Asura can continue surviving in the Miniature Ancient World.”

Nightmare Chaser’s words were full of arrogance, but nobody present refuted him. This was because his words were the truth. Apart from Shi Feng, nobody else present could survive against Nightmare Chaser. Rather than say that this battle was a fight between several powers, it’d be more accurate to say that it was a fight between two individuals.

“Is that so?” Shi Feng suddenly laughed. “Let’s see you try it, then!”

Immediately, dozens of Shi Feng’s doppelgangers appeared around Nightmare Chaser. These were the products of Flowing Space’s Second Step, Phantom Body. Under the effects of Holy Mana’s Shadow, Shi Feng could finally use the Gold Combat Technique’s second stage, elevating his mobility to a whole new level.

Meanwhile, although Shi Feng’s Law Projection was not as large as Nightmare Chaser’s, he still managed to suppress Nightmare Chaser’s Law Projection for an instant, weakening the bonuses the Berserker God received.

Third Sword, Holy Annihilation!

Boom!

Endless flames enveloped the sky above Abyssal Star City, instantly breaking the stalemate between Shi Feng and Nightmare Chaser. Moreover, because Nightmare Chaser failed to defend himself in time, and because Holy Annihilation’s attack was omnidirectional, the Berserker God ended up taking a direct hit and lost 6% of his HP.

My Law Projection is being suppressed? Nightmare Chaser was greatly confused when he experienced Shi Feng’s sudden increase in combat power. Even if it was only an instant, his Pseudo-Advanced Law Projection had still been suppressed, resulting in an imbalance in strength between both sides.

“Die!”

Shi Feng didn’t give Nightmare Chaser any time to think as he continued executing Flowing Space and Holy Annihilation, repeatedly plundering the Berserker God’s HP.

In God’s Domain, mastering and combining three Basic Laws wasn’t the only way to form an Advanced Law Projection. If players mastered an Advanced Law, they could similarly form an Advanced Law Projection once they reached Tier 6.

In his previous life, Shi Feng had mastered more than one Advanced Law. Although he couldn’t form an Advanced Law Projection due to him lacking a Tier 6 Divine Body, the Law Projection he formed with the help of Holy Mana’s Shadow still wasn’t something that a Pseudo-Advanced Law Projection could completely neutralize.

One hit… Two hits… Three hits…

Every attack Shi Feng executed took away some of Nightmare Chaser’s HP. Although Nightmare Chaser tried desperately to evade Shi Feng’s attacks in the hopes that he could drag out the fight until Shi Feng’s Holy Mana’s Shadow ran out, he was simply no match for Shi Feng when it came to mobility. As a result, he could only watch as his HP plummeted.

On the seventeenth attack, Nightmare Chaser’s HP fell to zero, marking the death of a Tier 6 Berserker God!
