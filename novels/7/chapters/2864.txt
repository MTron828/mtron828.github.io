Chapter 2865 - Special Loot

After Liang Jing left the room to prepare the listed materials, Shi Feng finally had time to sort through the loot from the Outerworld players.

Even the weakest among Quasi Eagle’s group was a Tier 3 player with Tier 4 combat power, so they all possessed excellent equipment, especially those Tier 3 players. If he could gather a complete set of their equipment, he would be able to increase Zero Wing’s number of Tier 4 combatants by one.

As Shi Feng inspected the loot, he couldn’t help feeling some awe at the Outerworld players’ equipment.

Every one of those Tier 3 experts was actually geared in Tier 3 Mana Set Equipment. In the current God’s Domain, a full set could easily sell for over 10,000 Gold.

However, compared to the Tier 4 experts’ loot, the Tier 3 experts’ loot was inferior by a large margin. Even the worst item dropped by the

Tier 4 Outerworld players was Level 150 Epic Equipment; some of them had even dropped parts of Epic Set Equipment. Judging by the loot, Shi Feng could say with certainty that these Tier 4 Outerworld players were using full sets of Epic Set Equipment.

Even the current Zero Wing didn’t have Epic Set Equipment.

Setting aside how rare Epic Set Equipment was, even if one found a way to obtain a set, one would still have to expend an incredible amount of time and manpower to acquire the full set. After all, there was no way to gather a full set just by killing one type of Boss monster; one would have to kill multiple types of Bosses. Moreover, these Bosses were not guaranteed to drop the equipment one desired. In other words, if one didn’t kill a large number and variety of Bosses, gathering a complete set of Epic Set Equipment would be impossible.

Meanwhile, killing a bunch of Level 150 Mythic ranked Bosses was a task that required a large number of Tier 4 players.

Of course, one part of an Epic Set Equipment from the Outerworld players didn’t prove anything.

However, Shi Feng didn’t have just one part but five. Moreover, this was merely the loot he got from killing Tier 4 experts of an Outerworld mercenary group. He could easily imagine how excellent the equipment of the Outerworld superpowers’ Tier 4 experts was and how many Tier 4 experts these superpowers possessed. Otherwise, it would be impossible for a measly mercenary group to gather so much Epic Set Equipment.

No wonder the eastern continent’s superpowers are powerless to retaliate. In terms of equipment standards alone, they are already behind by more than half a year. Not to mention, there is also the massive difference in the number of Tier 4 experts. Shi Feng’s head ached as he looked at the items before him.

Originally, he thought that the difference between Earth’s God’s Domain and the Interstellar Continent’s God’s Domain lay only in the number of Tier 4 experts and combat techniques they possessed. Now, he found that there was a massive gap even in weapons and equipment.

He had to admit that the threat level of the Outerworld’s players and forces exceeded his expectations.

After all, even now, Zero Wing could manufacture only individual pieces of Epic Equipment. Moreover, the production volume was incredibly low since only a handful of players could make them.

And worse, according to the statistics report regarding Zero Wing’s Tier 4 members, less than 30% of them were currently equipped with five or more pieces of Level 150 Epic Equipment. The rest had only three or so pieces of Level 150 Epic Equipment on average. As for Epic Set Equipment?

Dream on!

Zero Wing’s Tier 4 experts had that many pieces of Level 150 Epic Equipment mainly because of the Arctic Canyon. In addition, Yan Ya and Cleansing Whistle had returned from the ancient God’s Domain with a large number of Level 150 Epic Equipment. If not for these factors, Zero Wing’s Tier 4 experts would be even more poorly equipped right now.

However, it wasn’t exactly accurate to describe Zero Wing’s Tier 4 experts as poorly equipped. At the very least, they were much better equipped than the native superpowers’ Tier 4 experts. They were only inferior when compared to the Outerworld’s Tier 4 experts.

It seems I’ll have to start acquiring some top-tier Epic Weapons and Equipment once I finish setting up the intercontinental teleportation array. Otherwise, even if we have enough Tier 4 experts, we still won’t be able to go up against the Outerworld’s superpowers. While it was indeed important for one to acquire Legacy Guidances and improve one’s control over Mana after reaching Tier 4, that didn’t mean one could just ignore one’s weapons and equipment. After all, there was at least a 20% difference in Basic Attributes between a full set of disparate Epic Equipment and a full set of Epic Set Equipment. This difference would become even more significant with amplification by Skills and Mana control. After Shi Feng finished inspecting the weapons and equipment dropped, he set his sights on a shabby, crystalline statue. When he inspected the statue, though, he was stunned.

An Eternal Item?

No matter how he looked at the crystalline statue, it appeared ordinary. Yet, when he tried inspecting it, he actually failed to get any information. All he got was a bunch of “Unknowns.” Moreover, when he carefully spread his senses around the statue, he felt an urge to devour this statue, just like when he received the World Stone from Phoenix Rain.

Immediately, Shi Feng activated Omniscient Eyes to identify the statue.

Due to his Mana Body having reached the 120% threshold, Omniscient Eyes took less than 30 seconds to finish the appraisal.

[Origin Statue] (Eternal Item)

Effect 1: Guides the principle of all things.

Effect 2: Indestructible object.

Guides the principle of all things?

Shi Feng was momentarily confused by the item description. The World Stone’s description stated that it could stabilize the principle of all things. It had allowed him to log in and out of the game freely while in the ancient God’s Domain. However, what did the system mean by guiding the principle of all things?

Just as Shi Feng was wondering about the Origin Statue’s function, Liang Jing contacted

him.

“Guild Leader, I’ve prepared the materials you asked for. I can have them delivered to the Teleportation Hall now.”

“Okay. I’ll head over right away.”

At Liang Jing’s report, Shi Feng stopped studying the Origin Statue in his hand. After casually storing it in his bag, he hurried to the Teleportation Hall to strengthen the existing teleportation array. Only with the modification could the teleportation array manipulate enough Mana to connect with the western continent’s spatial node and form a stable teleportation channel.

And once a stable channel was established, easy travel between the two continents would become possible. He would no longer have to trouble himself with searching for unreliable ancient teleportation arrays.

Zero Wing City, Battle Arena:

The Battle Arena covered an area of several sports stadiums. Presently, the establishment was crowded with players, and even Tier 4 players were waiting in line to reserve a combat room. The liveliness here was even more exaggerated than the Auction Houses of imperial capitals.

Looking at MacAffrey and Crimson Witch, who had just exited a combat room, Fithalia asked curiously, “Affrey, what do you think of the combat room’s effects?”

Initially, they had visited the eastern continent to assist Zero Wing and deepen the relationship between Divine Tribe and Zero Wing.

However, after experiencing Zero Wing City’s Mana, they couldn’t suppress their curiosity about the effects of training in such an environment. Hence, they came to this place to sate their curiosity. After all, the Battle Arena was the only place in Zero Wing City that allowed players to do combat.

“How should I put it…” After pondering for a moment and mentally sorting his words, MacAffrey said, “If the Starlight Fortress’s training efficiency is a 10, then this place is above 30.”

“Isn’t that too much of an exaggeration?” Fithalia couldn’t help feeling skeptical of MacAffrey’s evaluation.

Although she knew that MacAffrey was an austere person and that Zero Wing City’s environment was extraordinary, MacAffrey’s evaluation of the city’s training effect was simply too exaggerated in her opinion. For players of their caliber, the quality of their training environment would need to be significantly better for them to see any improvements to their training efficiency. Hence, no matter how excellent Zero Wing City’s environment was, she couldn’t bring herself to believe that someone like MacAffrey would see his training efficiency triple.

“No! It’s not an exaggeration! Commander Fithalia, although the Mana here isn’t misty, when you start manipulating the ambient Mana, you’ll discover that its density is actually much greater than the Mana mist you find in the outside world,” Crimson Witch insisted earnestly. “If you fight against an expert of the same caliber in this environment, the insights you can get are on a completely different level. This is especially true for your control over Mana. I really don’t know how Zero Wing accomplished this. They actually managed to let a Guild City have such dense Mana. You can even view the operating principles of Mana with such high clarity!”

“She’s right. If I can train here, I’m confident I can further improve my Mana Body in less than ten days,” MacAffrey said, nodding. He then looked enviously at the Zero Wing members in the building.

The Divine Tribe trio had the fortune of visiting Zero Wing City only because they had followed Shi Feng to the eastern continent. If not for Shi Feng granting them access, they wouldn’t have been able to enter the city. They also wouldn’t have realized how astonishing the city’s environment was.

Meanwhile, Zero Wing’s members could actually enjoy the environment here every day. How could he not envy them?

At his current standard, increasing his Mana Body’s Completion Rate by even 1% was incredibly challenging. Yet, in Zero Wing City, he saw the chance to improve his Mana Body rapidly.

A glimmer appeared in Crimson Witch’s eyes as she insisted, “Commander Fithalia, we must recommend establishing a temporary Residence in Zero Wing City to the Grand Elders and Guild Leader once we return. It doesn’t matter even if we have to pay a significant price. The short-term effects might not be obvious, but the long-term benefits for the Guild are absolutely unimaginable. Surpassing the Five Great Super Guilds might even become possible.”

Fithalia smiled wryly at Crimson Witch’s strong recommendation. “I want to, but once the intercontinental teleportation array is activated, I’m afraid it’ll become difficult for Divine Tribe to secure a temporary Residence.”

Once Zero Wing’s intercontinental teleportation array began operating, so long as the two continents’ superpowers were not stupid, they would understand just how valuable Zero Wing City was, not to mention the extraordinary Mana environment in this place.

She could easily imagine how many superpowers would seek to garrison Zero Wing City at that time.

“No! You can’t say that, Commander Fithalia!” Looking at Fithalia, MacAffrey suddenly smiled and said, “I heard that Black Flame lives in Yuantian City’s Upper Zone. With your family’s influence and connections, if you personally paid him a visit, wouldn’t he agree to a partnership immediately?”

Fithalia was a potential successor of a powerful family based in the Upper Zone. Her beauty and figure in the real world were also at the level of toppling nations. If she personally visited someone in the Upper Zone and sincerely proposed a partnership, hardly anyone in the Upper Zone would refuse her.

Upon hearing MacAffrey’s suggestion, Crimson Witch nodded in agreement.

“You…two!” Fithalia sputtered, rendered speechless by her two companions. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, before Fithalia could say anything more, a sudden commotion came from outside the Battle Arena. Then, the Mana in the city grew violent and irritable.

When Fithalia and her companions walked out of the lobby, they promptly noticed a tower of light rising from the Teleportation Hall’s direction.
