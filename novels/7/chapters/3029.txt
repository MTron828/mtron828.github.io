Chapter 104 – Global Competition

A golden temple stood amidst an ancient forest. The temple had five floors in total, and it measured several hundred meters in height and occupied an area equivalent to six sports stadiums.

There was a massive stone tablet erected outside of every floor, and every tablet had a column of numbers going from 1 to 100 listed on it. Currently, though, the space next to these numbers was blank, and beneath these numbers was one line of text. Although the text on each tablet was similar, they weren’t exactly the same.

The texts were simple to understand, and they represented the rewards one could obtain from challenging the temple’s trials.

Simply put, the first 100 people to clear each floor would receive varying amounts of Association Points to be used with the God’s Domain Association. Meanwhile, the first 100 to clear the first floor would receive 100 Association points.

The first 100 to clear the second floor would receive 1,000 Association points.

The first 100 to clear the third floor would receive 10,000 Association points.

The first 100 to clear the fourth floor would receive 100,000 Association points.

The first 100 to clear the fifth floor would receive 1,000,000 Association points.

How generous of the Association. Not only is it planning on uncovering more talented newcomers, but it’s also offering such lucrative rewards to the instructors. Is the Association trying to get more experts to become instructors?

Shi Feng was a little surprised when he finished reading the rewards stated on the tablets.

The God’s Domain Association’s Association Points were an incredibly precious resource to the Association’s internal members. Even through official channels, one Association Point could be traded for 10,000 Credits. Of course, only a fool would exchange it for such a low price.

The God’s Domain Association had access to an ocean of resources, and even the various international corporations couldn’t hope to compete against the Association in terms of wealth. Meanwhile, internal members of the Association could exchange for resources that one normally couldn’t acquire through the public market.

So long as one had enough points, one could exchange for combat techniques, Legacies, and even S-rank Nutrient Fluids. Although the Association had put a price tag of 200 points per bottle on S-rank Nutrient Fluids, it was still a tempting opportunity for many people.

In addition, according to Shi Feng’s research, the God’s Domain Association even offered the incredibly rare Life Potions for exchange to internal members.

The Life Potion was an item that countless wealthy people sought after. Not only could it heal the wounds on the user’s body, but it could also rejuvenate the life force of the user’s body cells, extending their life expectancy and youthfulness.

However, the Green God Company only produced a very limited amount of Life Potion each year, and even the various international corporations had difficulty obtaining one per year. Yet, internal members of the God’s Domain Association could exchange for it simply by accumulating enough points. The only problem was that the Life Potion cost a whopping 10,000 points to exchange.

Ten thousand points!

This was an amount that most of the Association’s internal members would never acquire in their lifetimes.

However, the Association’s instructor certification test offered participating instructors the opportunity to make the impossible possible.

While Shi Feng was feeling shocked over the God’s Domain Association’s generosity, the outside world was similarly shocked over this situation.

“What is the Association trying to do, Commander Ziqiong?! Once news of these rewards gets out, even the various powers’ peak experts wouldn’t be able to sit still!” the burly middle-aged man standing beside Purple Jade exclaimed when he read the report he just received.

Setting aside the various top-tier training resources the Association provided, just the S-rank Nutrient Fluid it offered was already a fatal temptation to many experts. It was especially true for Tier 4 and Tier 5 experts. After all, one’s brain would have difficulty improving without a strong body to support it. Meanwhile, not only could the S-rank Nutrient Fluid repair the damage on one’s body, but it could also strengthen the physical body. Now that the God’s Domain Association was offering players the opportunity to acquire a large amount of Association Points, many experts would most likely be tempted to work as an instructor and take part in the Associations’ instructor certification test.

“I don’t know what the Association is trying to do,” Purple Jade said, shaking her head. Then, with a hint of fighting spirit in her eyes, she continued, “But once news of this gets out, most experts around the world will probably grow restless. We might even see a global struggle between experts. Even the various superpowers’ old monsters and God-ranked experts might not mind revealing their cards if it means gaining access to such lucrative rewards. Register me for the test as well, Star.”

“You’ll be participating as well, Commander Ziqiong?” the burly man with the pseudonym of Berserk Star asked in surprise.

Ever since Purple Jade reached tier 6, she had stopped participating in tests and competitions altogether. In fact, it had already been over a year since Berserk Star saw Purple Jade in action.

“Of course,” Purple Jade said with a light smile. “I’ve constantly been trying to find other God-ranked experts to fight previously, but those people are so secretive that it’s hard to find even one of them. This test is a good opportunity to compare myself with the others. While it might not be a frontal clash, it is still a good way to see how I match up with the others. So, how can I miss out on such an opportunity?”

There were only several dozen Tier 6 experts in God’s Domain. With the exception of a few newly-promoted Tier 6 experts, most veteran Tier 6 experts were incredibly secretive in their actions. Moreover, now that the various powers had already solidified their rule over their respective territories, there was almost no instance where Tier 6 combatants would appear on the battlefield. At most, clashes between powers would involve Tier 5 combatants.

Because of this, Purple Jade hardly had any chances to fight against other Tier 6 experts after reaching Tier 6 herself. She was especially curious to find out the gap between herself and the various first-place rankers on the God’s Domain Experts List that had disappeared over the years, the various old monsters, and those four people.

Now that the God’s Domain Association had provided the perfect place for her to test her standards, how could she miss out on this opportunity?

“Alright, I’ll get it done immediately.”

Immediately, Berserk Star stepped out of the lounge and contacted the God’s Domain Association’s staff to arrange for Purple Jade’s participation.

…

While Purple Jade was getting ready to take part in the test, the various superpowers’ Tier 6 experts also received news of the God’s Domain Association’s offer.

“Interesting! I’m going to try out this test!”

“Is the Association trying to come up with a global ranking list for experts?”

“I’ve hardly fought with other Tier 6 experts after reaching Tier 6 myself. This is a good chance to check out how strong the other Tier 6 experts are.”

Shortly after news of the God’s Domain Association’s test rewards got out, many Tier 5 and Tier 6 experts worldwide started applying for the Association’s test one after another.

For a time, the instructor’s test became the focus of the world’s peak experts and above. Many independent experts had even started broadcasting the status of the test’s stone tablets live.

…

Meanwhile, inside one of the test instances…

In the short time Shi Feng spent pondering over the Association’s actions, several dozen names had appeared on the first floor’s stone tablet. This meant that several dozen people had already cleared the first floor’s test.

So many got through already?

Shi Feng was a little surprised when he saw that the first floor’s tablet list was nearly filled.

According to the information the Association provided, instructors would gain the Bronze certification so long as they cleared the temple’s first floor. Meanwhile, one needed to be at the Flowing Water Realm at the very least to become a Bronze Instructor.

It had only been a few minutes since the test began, yet several dozen experts had already conquered the first floor’s test. This just showed how high the number and quality of experts participating in the test were.

Immediately, Shi Feng also chose to enter the temple. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

…

System: Registration is required to participate in the test. You may use your God’s Domain ID or a new name to register.

…

“I can choose my own name?” Shi Feng was a little surprised by this situation. “In that case, I’ll go with ‘Asura’ as my name.”

Currently, Shi Feng still did not wish to expose his name of Black Flame. After all, both himself and Zero Wing were far too weak right now. So, it was good news that he could use a different pseudonym to challenge the test.

…

System: Naming successful. Player ID Asura registered. Please check in on the first floor.

…

Immediately, Shi Feng transformed into a streak of light that disappeared into the temple’s first floor.

…

TL Notes:

200 Association Points = 2,000,000 Credits

Market value of S-rank Nutrient Fluid is 1,000,000 Credits.
