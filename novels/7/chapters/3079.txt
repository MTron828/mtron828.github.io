TL Notes:

Change made to Chapter 153:

Sealed Land -> Sealing Labyrinth

…

Players of the newer generations might not be aware of the Snow Goddess’s name, but for the Hundred Flower Palace members present, it was a name that was deeply engraved in their minds.

When God’s Domain first launched, Gentle Snow was one of the few female players regarded as a goddess by most players in the virtual gaming world. Meanwhile, out of the several goddesses, Gentle Snow was deemed to have the greatest potential to reach Tier 6.

Unfortunately, before Gentle Snow could reach Tier 6, she suddenly vanished from God’s Domain. Her disappearance had sparked many debates at the time. Even Ouroboros, the first-rate Guild Gentle Snow belonged to, had suffered a huge dip in reputation, and it took the Guild quite sometime before it managed to recover.

So, now that Gentle Snow had suddenly reappeared before them after all these years, it was inevitable that Hundred Flower Palace’s members were shocked.

“Why would Gentle Snow appear in Zero Wing?”

“Everyone thought she had died after all these years of silence. I never thought she would actually make her reappearance in Zero Wing. Could she be someone else who just looks like Gentle Snow?”

“Unlikely. I saw Gentle Snow during God’s Domain’s launch. Although her appearance has changed a little, her presence is still the same as before. So, she should be Gentle Snow.”

Hundred Flower Palace’s members couldn’t help but discuss Gentle Snow when they saw her approaching together with Shi Feng.

Not only did a legendary individual from the past make a reappearance, but she had even become a member of Zero Wing. If news of this got out, it would definitely attract the attention of many powers.

Currently, Zero Wing was already one of the most famous Guilds in God’s Domain. It was also publicly acknowledged that Zero Wing was close to rivaling the various superpowers when it came to resources and advantages in the Miniature Ancient World. Now that the Snow Goddess had also joined Zero Wing, it would undoubtedly increase the Guild’s overall strength.

“What a pity.” After Crimson Heart scrutinized Gentle Snow for a moment, she let out a rueful sigh and said, “If she hadn’t disappeared from God’s Domain all those years ago, she would’ve long since become a Tier 6 God-ranked expert already.”

Based on her observations of Gentle Snow’s movements, Crimson Heart could tell that Gentle Snow was only at the Void Realm standard. Gentle Snow’s combat standard remained the same as when she disappeared from God’s Domain. She might have the ability to perceive her surroundings clearly, but she lacked the ability of Domain Realm experts to turn her surroundings into her weapon.

While Void Realm experts were rare among the various first-rate powers and superpowers, that was it. They were nowhere near as strong and useful as Domain Realm experts.

Take the current situation, for example. The Void Realm expert was merely the minimum combat standard required to enter the Sealing Labyrinth.

If Gentle Snow hadn’t disappeared all those years ago, she would’ve long since reached the Domain Realm already. She might have reached the next level in the Domain Realm.

“Sorry for the wait. It took some time to prepare,” Shi Feng said apologetically as he looked at Hundred Flower Palace’s members.

“We are already more than grateful that you are willing to come here in person, Mr. Black Flame. We won’t even mind waiting for another day if it means we can get your help,” Crimson Heart said, her eyes filled with shock and anticipation when she saw that Shi Feng had already reached Level 109. “I’m afraid we’ll have to trouble you to lead us this time, Mr. Black Flame.”

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Shi Feng was Hundred Flower Palace’s only chance of securing more slots in the raid this time. After all, there was a high chance that all six of the Tower Alliance’s representatives were Tier 6 God-ranked experts.

However, after seeing that Shi Feng had already reached Level 109, Crimson Heart felt that their side wasn’t without a fighting chance. After all, there wasn’t much of a level difference between him and the Tower Alliance’s representatives. Not to mention, Shi Feng was also a bona fide God-ranked expert with a true Mana Domain.

“No problem. However, I have to reiterate that all of the loot we get inside the Sealing Labyrinth belongs to Zero Wing. Half of the slots you get in the end will also belong to Zero Wing,” Shi Feng said.

The maze sealing the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s pathway was a huge treasure trove. Although the loot inside the maze wasn’t as valuable as the entry slots to the Stratified Abyssal Realm, it was still more than enough to cause any power to go crazy.

This was because every Sealing Labyrinth had a chance of dropping Lineage Crystals.

Lineage Crystals were incredibly valuable treasures. Although they had an incredibly low drop rate, so long as one dropped, even the various superpowers would fight to get it.

This was because a Lineage Crystal could allow players to mutate their lineage, obtain a bona fide rare race, and gain talents outside the reach of most human players. With the Lineage Crystal, players wouldn’t have to do a bunch of troublesome quests to convert their race. In addition, the Lineage Crystal also granted players the freedom to choose from several hundred races to convert into.

Of course, the Lineage Crystal was only valuable to God’s Domains that had yet to gain access to the Greater God’s Domain. For those already linked to the Greater God’s Domain, the Lineage Crystal was a relatively common item. Some of the older God’s Domains even had one-third of their player population converted into a rare race already.

However, now that their God’s Domain had yet to gain access to the Greater God’s Domain, the Lineage Crystal could become a capital for Zero Wing to grow stronger.

“Since we are relying on Zero Wing for the raid this time, Hundred Flower Palace will not ask for any of the loot,” Crimson Heart said, nodding.

While Crimson Heart was speaking, the Tower Alliance’s members had also walked over.

“I see you are quite confident, Vice Guild Leader Crimson. You are already discussing how you’ll split the loot before we even start raiding the labyrinth,” the middle-aged dwarven man from the Tower Alliance named Blood Hammer said contemptuously as he looked at Crimson Heart. Then, impatiently, he asked, “So, can we open the Sealing Labyrinth now?”

Opening the Sealing Labyrinth required a special key. Although it was possible to open it with just half of the key, the labyrinth’s raid difficulty would be doubled.

“Yes. Everyone on our side is here already,” Crimson Heart said. Although she felt a little angered by Blood Hammer’s snide remark, she didn’t show it on her face. After all, the Tower Alliance indeed possessed the strength to ridicule Hundred Flower Palace.

Subsequently, Crimson Heart and Blood Hammer each took out a key and injected Mana into their respective keys. Immediately, the two keys radiated a dazzling glow, and the tightly shut stone doors slowly opened up a gap that allowed for several people to enter.

After the gigantic doors opened, a dark and ancient aura flowed out from the gap, the aura causing everyone present to shudder involuntarily.

“What dense Power of Darkness!” the Demidragon woman exclaimed. “As expected of a place that connects the Stratified Abyssal Realm. If a dark race were to live inside this place, they’d have a significantly easier time breaking through to higher tiers.”

“Alright, let’s head inside. The sooner we reach the fifth underground floor and kill the Guardian Boss, the sooner we can enter the Stratified Abyssal Realm,” the elven man standing beside the Demidragon woman said, an excited look appearing on his face. He wasn’t a normal Elf, but a Dark Elf instead. So, the denser the Power of Darkness in an area, the more beneficial it would be to him in his development. The strength he could exhibit would also increase significantly.

Hearing the elven man’s words, the Tower Alliance’s five other representatives nodded and charged straight into the labyrinth, showing no care for Hundred Flower Palace’s representatives whatsoever. Rather than operate as a team of twelve, they operated as a party of six instead.

Meanwhile, when Shi Feng saw Rain Song looking at him anxiously, he chuckled and said, “Alright, let’s head inside as well.”

The four players Hundred Flower Palace had sent to participate in the raid possessed extraordinary strength. Their class distribution was also excellent.

Rain Song was a Level 105 Guardian Knight, Crimson Heart was a spear-wielding Level 105 Berserker, Cleansed Rue was a Level 105 Elementalist, and Still Moon was a Level 105 Cleric. Rain Song and Still Moon were Void Realm experts, while Crimson Heart and Cleansed Rue were Domain Realm experts.

Even with the addition of a Swordsman and Berserker like Shi Feng and Gentle Snow, the party would still have a good class distribution.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
