Chapter 151 - Come If You Can!

Very quickly, South Wolf’s communication request arrived.

“Who are you? If you have something to say, then say it quickly. I’m very busy,” Shi Feng said in an annoyed tone after picking up the call.

“You... Do you know who I...”

Shi Feng’s words nearly caused South Wolf to lose it. However, in the end, he still endured it. After all, this was a task handed down to him from above, so he needed to carry out the job properly. If it were any other person who dared speak to him in such a way, they would definitely face a tragic end.

“If you have nothing to say, then I’m hanging up,” Shi Feng said.

South Wolf furiously said, “Why would I look for you if I have nothing to say?!”

“Then speak of it quickly; I’m very busy,” Shi Feng said, annoyed. There was a huge opportunity right before his eyes, so where would he find the time to bicker with a stranger?

South Wolf nearly burst out in rage once again at Shi Feng’s words. A loose expert like Shi Feng dared to speak to him in such a way. However, after giving it some thought, South Wolf realized that Shi Feng only dared to speak to him in such a way due to not knowing his real identity.

“I need to calm down... Calm down...” South Wolf consoled himself, saying, “As long as he knows my identity, he will definitely be shocked witless.”

“I am the spokesperson for Underworld. I assume that you have never heard of the name of Underworld, right? That’s because Underworld is a gigantic hidden organization. If a person does not reach a certain degree of standard, they will have no qualifications for knowing about our existence at all. As for the strength of Underworld, I can tell you about it right now. Even if it is an assassination expert like Absolute Heaven, after striving for three years, only now did he manage to obtain the qualifications to become an outer member of Underworld. Until now, he was just an existence at the very bottom.”

“What? Absolute Heaven is just an outer member of Underworld?” Shi Feng was slightly shocked.

Indeed, he had never heard of the name of Underworld before. He also did not know how powerful it was. However, if a top-tier assassin like Absolute Heaven was just an outer member, it could be seen just how unfathomable a background Underworld possessed.

Shi Feng also did not think that South Wolf was speaking a lie. After experiencing so many things in God’s Domain, Shi Feng was rather proficient at determining whether a person was lying or not. Moreover, the way South Wolf spoke carried the hint of someone speaking down from high above, like an emperor overlooking commoners. This was not an action that could be faked.

They can’t be wanting to take revenge because I killed Absolute Heaven, right? Shi Feng inwardly guessed. Previously, he had not discovered any Guild Emblem on Absolute Heaven’s person. Hence, he always thought that Absolute Heaven was a hidden expert working as a solo Assassin. He did not think that Absolute Heaven would have such backing.

Hearing Shi Feng’s shock, South Wolf felt slightly satisfied.

“Actually, this isn’t anything special. Underworld also possesses an unimaginable influence in the real world. The resources and information we possess far exceed your imagination. Even as an outer member, the strength you possess could cause even a major corporation in a city to tremble. Even the Snow Goddess, Gentle Snow, that you’re very familiar with, has to treat an intermediate member of Underworld with respect, not to mention the upper management of Underworld.” South Wolf laughed, proudly saying, “By telling you all this information, I am not trying to brag about Underworld, but instead, I am telling you just how powerful of a background Underworld possesses. If you don’t believe me, you can go ask Gentle Snow. Without sufficient strength, one would not even have the qualifications to know about the existence of Underworld.”

“I’m contacting you to tell you that you have already received the attention of Underworld. You now possess the qualifications to join Underworld.”

“Is it because I killed Absolute Heaven?” Shi Feng calmly asked.

“En, you can put it that way. If you did not have the strength to kill Absolute Heaven, then you really would not be able to catch the attention of Underworld.”

South Wolf was slightly astonished. Shi Feng was actually not the least bit excited after hearing his words. If others were to receive a similar message, they would normally be ecstatic, wishing they could join immediately. After all, by joining Underworld, one could have many chances to become acquainted with a group of large characters. Carrying out tasks in the future would also become much more convenient. The information Underworld possessed far exceeded what one could imagine, and it would have an unimaginable benefit towards one’s future development.

“So you’re saying, as long as I agree, I can become an outer member of Underworld immediately?” Shi Feng had long since weathered through plenty of storms. He was no longer that immature youth in his early twenties. Hence, he reacted extremely calmly.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, as the Guild Leader of Shadow, he had never heard of the existence of Underworld. However, Shi Feng did not find it strange either. After all, Shadow was only a second-rate Guild. In the eyes of first-rate Guilds, they were but an ant on the road, not worthy to be mentioned at all.

“You can put it that way as well. However, it would not be easy if you wish to join Underworld. Right now, you only possess the qualifications to join. Moreover, in Underworld, we have always believed that, if you wished to obtain something, then you need to pay an equivalent price for it. Only when you can afford the price to join Underworld, would you be able to officially become an outer member.”

“Can you tell me what sort of price I need to pay?”

“The price to join Underworld is a considerable amount. Even Absolute Heaven spent three years to join. However, you are extremely lucky. From my previous investigations, I discovered that there is a certain flame in your possession that is able to greatly increase your attack and destructive power. As long as you hand over that flame, and pay a monthly membership fee of 10 Gold Coins, you will officially become an outer member of Underworld.”

“I see,” realization struck Shi Feng.

The organization, Underworld, was similar to a grand chamber of commerce in real life. If one wanted to join the organization, then they needed to pay the membership fee. However, not just anybody possessed the qualifications to join the organization. Within the organization, members would be able to form platforms for mutual assistance, information sharing, and resource sharing. With this, members would be able to obtain many more business opportunities to develop their own enterprises further.

“Since you understand, when are you prepared to pay the price? I can’t stay too long in Red Leaf Town. I still have many other things that I need to do,” South Wolf said with a laugh. As long as he could obtain the Epic ranked flame in Shi Feng’s hands, coupling it with several years of accumulated contributions, he would be able to officially become an intermediate member of Underworld. At that time, he would be able to call the wind and rain as he pleased.

“Sorry, but I refuse to join. You should look for someone else,” Shi Feng said in a stern tone.

After his experience with Shadow, he no longer wished to join someone else’s organization. Moreover, he did not need to join someone else’s organization. With his advantage as a reincarnated person, he had knowledge of tons of information of which others were unaware. He also knew the trends in which the future would develop toward. If Underworld was seeking him out to cooperate as equals, then he could put some consideration into the matter. However, for him to become a member of Underworld, it would only be a different form of slaving off for someone else. Fortunately, he did not possess such a hobby.

Right now, he could already start establishing a large Workshop. The goal of establishing a large Guild was also within close sight, so he truly did not see any need to join Underworld. The most valuable thing one could obtain within Underworld was information about God’s Domain. In the eyes of others, although such information was extremely precious, to Shi Feng it was common knowledge.

The reason he spoke so much was simply to find out more about Underworld.

“What did you say?” South Wolf thought he had heard incorrectly. After speaking for such a long time, Shi Feng had simply rejected him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I’m not interested in joining Underworld. You should look for someone else,” Shi Feng reiterated once more.

“After speaking so much, in the end, you are just toying with me?” South Wolf angrily said, “Do you know what kind of consequences your actions will bring?”

“It is you who contacted me first. Now that I don’t wish to join Underworld, are you going to threaten me to join?” Shi Feng sneered.

“Since you dare to toy around with us, Underworld, you naturally have to pay the price. Hand over the flame, and I’ll consider it as if this matter never happened. Otherwise, prepare to suffer Underworld’s wrath!” South Wolf threatened in a cold tone.

“Hahaha! You finally revealed your fox’s tail. Since the beginning, your goal has always been the flame, right? You found out from Absolute Heaven that my flame is not anything simple, so you wish to have it for yourselves now, is it?” Shi Feng calmly said, “I only have one sentence to say to you: If you guys have the ability, then come!”
