Chapter 262 – Sword Law Saint

Dammit!

Shi Feng’s expression turned grim when he saw the oncoming lightning spear. He didn’t think the system would be so ruthless as to start the Legacy Power absorption without giving him any options or time to prepare.

However, Shi Feng dared not withhold his cards as he activated the Abyssal Eye’s Abyssal Power. Immediately, a layer of black fog enveloped him, and his body began radiating an aura close to rivaling Superior Mythic monsters of the same level.

Yet, even after activating Abyssal Power, Shi Feng could still feel the threat of death descending upon him as the lightning spear neared him.

As an eight-winged Tier 4 Valkyrie, Tia Pollena could exhibit Tier 5 power even with a casual attack, let alone with a spear that concentrated the power of lightning. An attack of such caliber could severely injure even a Superior Mythic monster of the same level.

Upon realizing that he still couldn’t survive the Valkyrie’s attack, Shi Feng promptly unsheathed the Winter of Eternal Night and activated Radiant Night, forcibly increasing the power of his attack by two ranks.

Subsequently, a black streak of light collided with the silver lightning spear. However, no sound or explosion came from the collision. On the contrary, the battlefield darkened and became devoid of sound.

Amidst the battlefield of shattered space, Shi Feng remained standing steadily. However, going by his disheveled hair, his trembling arms, and his HP bar that was only half full, it was obvious that he had lost to the Valkyrie in their competition of raw power.

As expected of an eight-winged Valkyrie. She really isn’t an opponent I can challenge at Tier 3.?Shi Feng couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile when he saw that Tia Pollena had already conjured a second lightning spear during the time he was defending against her first lightning spear.

It should be known that Shi Feng had used Sword’s Orbit in conjunction with Radiant Night to defend against Tia Pollena’s attack. This was the strongest combination he could currently muster, and it allowed him to exhibit power at the Tier 5 Intermediate standard.

Yet, even his strongest attack was only enough to just barely keep him alive. Moreover, he wouldn’t be able to use this attack again within a short period of time.

In fact, if he hadn’t switched out his Mana Equipment Set for the Blazing Flame Set, he might not even be alive right now.

Yet, the system wanted him to hold out for 30 seconds. This was just asking him for the impossible.

“Atone for your sins, human!”

When Tia Pollena saw that Shi Feng no longer had the strength to replicate his previous attack, she coldly threw the second lightning spear she conjured at him. She did not plan on giving Shi Feng any time to rest.

The lightning spear was incredibly fast, and it crossed the 200 yards that separated Tia Pollena from Shi Feng in the blink of an eye.

When Shi Feng saw that the lightning spear was only 30 yards away, he gritted his teeth and unfurled the ancient scroll he had secretly taken out after blocking Tia Pollena’s first attack. Meanwhile, this ancient scroll was none other than the Tier 5 Defensive Magic Scroll he had obtained from killing Diaclo the Nether King.

Tier 5 Magic Scrolls were extremely rare even in the Greater God’s Domain, each worth several Fragmented Legendary items. Tier 5 Defensive Magic Scrolls were especially valuable, and they were labeled as the best lifesaving tools in the Greater God’s Domain.

A Tier 5 Defensive Magic Scroll could even withstand the full-powered attack of a Tier 5 Dragon, giving players enough time to use Tier 3 or Tier 4 Teleportation Scrolls to escape to safety.

Originally, Shi Feng had planned to use this Tier 5 Defensive Magic Scroll when he embarked on his search for the God Slayer’s Legacy. However, he had no choice but to use it in this situation.

As soon as Shi Feng activated the magic scroll, an invisible barrier stopped the lightning spear in its tracks, preventing the attack from getting anywhere near Shi Feng.

“This is…Broken Space?” Tia Pollena frowned when she saw her attack failing to eliminate Shi Feng yet again. “What a lucky human you are.”

Shi Feng shrugged at Tia Pollena’s comment. Then, he said, “I’m sure you know about the Tier 5 Broken Space’s effect. It can keep me protected for one minute, so how about we call a truce?”

An eight-winged Valkyrie possessed high intelligence, so it was possible to hold a conversation with one. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmph. Keep your dreams to yourself. You might have a Broken Space protecting you, but you aren’t in control of it. So long as I keep attacking it and draining its mana, its reserve mana will run out sooner or later.”

Tia Pollena snorted coldly. Immediately, she began bombarding Shi Feng with lightning spears one after another. In only the blink of an eye, she had already thrown three lightning spears, the rate of her attack significantly greater than before.

Seeing this, Shi Feng couldn’t help but grow anxious.

It was just like Tia Pollena stated. The Tier 5 Broken Space stored in the Tier 5 Defensive Magic Scroll wasn’t under his control. Although the scroll’s introduction stated that Broken Space had a one-minute duration, that was under the assumption that the magic scroll’s mana reserve did not get depleted.

Meanwhile, the invisible barrier protecting him might be unfazed even after stopping multiple lightning spears. Still, he could tell that the barrier’s mana fluctuations were growing weaker with each subsequent attack. In a situation where he couldn’t supply more mana to the Defensive Spell, once the magic scroll’s mana reserves were depleted, the Spell would lose effect automatically.

Shi Feng, in his current state, did not have the strength to block another attack from Tia Pollena. If Broken Space couldn’t last for 30 seconds, he’d die for certain. However, if it could last for 30 seconds, he would still have hope of completing his Tier 4 promotion and getting out of this Legacy Land alive.

As for running away, that wasn’t an option at all. Unless he had a Tier 4 Teleportation Scroll or above, there was no way he could get away from an eight-winged Valkyrie’s Spatial Lockdown.

While Tia Pollena was frenziedly bombarding the Tier 5 Broken Space with attacks, time passed by quickly.

Ten seconds… Fifteen seconds… Twenty seconds…

Twenty-five seconds after Shi Feng had started absorbing the Ancient God’s Arm’s Legacy Power, the invisible barrier protecting Shi Feng started wavering as if it could disappear at any moment.

Three more seconds… Two… One…?Shi Feng stared at the loading bar before him intently while praying that Broken Space could last for a moment longer.

“It ends here!”

When Tia Pollena saw that the mana fluctuations separating her from Shi Feng still did not disappear completely, she resolved herself to use Sword of Judgment, the strongest Skill unique to Valkyries.

Immediately, a sword of lightning that measured several hundred meters in length appeared above Tia Pollena. Then, before Shi Feng could react, Tia Pollena swung the lightning sword at Shi Feng.

Bang!

The sound of glass shattering echoed throughout the battlefield as the invisible barrier generated by Broken Space crumbled. With the barrier gone, Shi Feng was now thoroughly exposed to Tia Pollena’s wrath.

“Die!”

Tia Pollena conjured a lightning spear and threw it at Shi Feng without hesitation.

However, Shi Feng did not grow anxious even after seeing this attack. This was because he had already received his long-awaited system notification a second before Broken Space lost effect.
