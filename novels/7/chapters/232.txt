Chapter 233 - Astronomical Transaction

“Miss Aqua has some urgent matters?” Shi Feng was slightly surprised.

“That’s right. Although I cannot reveal to Your Excellency what those matters are, I, Joking Scholar, can represent Miss Aqua in conducting the transaction with you.”

However, Shi Feng did not believe him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Every time he and Aqua Rose completed a transaction, both sides would gain massive profits. Logically speaking, there should be nothing more important than this matter. Even if Aqua Rose truly had an urgent matter, she should have at least notified him beforehand. However, Aqua Rose had not.

Shi Feng carefully observed this Maitreya-like person. Although he appeared absolutely harmless, his body exuded a sense of shrewdness that spoke of vast experience in the business world.

Virtual reality... In this realistic world, regarding a player’s expressions or demeanor, both would be fully displayed on their characters.

With over a decade of experience campaigning in God’s Domain, Shi Feng could immediately perceive the delight and panic hidden behind those beady little eyes.

“Since Miss Aqua has some matters to deal with, let us postpone our business transaction till next time, then.” Shi Feng smiled calmly before standing up, saying, “I still have some matters that I need to attend to, so I’ll leave first.”

Hearing that Shi Feng had no intention to continue the trade and intended to leave, Maitreya’s facial expression immediately changed. A hint of panic appeared in his friendly smile when Shi Feng stood.

“Master Black Flame, don’t be in such a rush! Although Miss Aqua is absent, Twilight Echo sincerely desires this trade’s success. We are willing to pay 30% more than the previously mentioned price!” Joking Scholar hurriedly stood and held back Shi Feng.

“Thirty percent? It seems that you guys really are sincere about this.” Shi Feng halted his steps, smiling. He then turned to face the panicked Maitreya, saying, “Since you’ve already made the offer, let us negotiate the price.”

“Of course, of course!” Joking Scholar hurriedly nodded his head, once more revealing his friendly smile.

Following which, the two sat and resumed their business transaction.

“Do you have what I asked of Miss Aqua the last time?” Shi Feng asked.

“Master Black Flame, please have a look,” Joking Scholar retrieved several Ore Bags. Hard Stones and rare forging materials filled the majority of these bags.

Moreover, aside from taking out five 400-slot Ore Bags, which were the largest Ore Bags currently available to players, he had also taken out a black leather bag. There were many runes carved on the exterior of this bag, and one could tell that it was not an ordinary item with just a glance.

It is as expected of Twilight Echo. They even have a Runic Ore Bag. Shi Feng was inwardly shocked.

The Runic Ore Bag was a Mysterious-Iron grade Ore Bag. It had a massive capacity of 1,200 slots, four times that of a Common grade Ore Bag.

However, this item was not easy to obtain. Only Lord ranked Bosses in mines had a chance of dropping this item.

Compared to the previous encounter, this transaction would be far larger. Joking Scholar had prepared over 2,000 stacks of Hard Stones, 300 stacks of Fine Iron Ore, 400 stacks of Silver Ore, and 200 stacks of Mithril Ore. Furthermore, there were also 100 stacks of Gold Ore, which was currently unavailable in Star-Moon Kingdom.

Just how much manpower and resources had they spent in the process of gathering such a large amount of precious ores?

This was precisely the strength of a first-rate Guild. It was not something a normal Guild could compare to.

“Good, everything that I requested is here. Deducting all these ores, if we factor in the 30% increase in price you previously mentioned, you just need to pay me an additional 120 million Credits.” Shi Feng took out a letter that had been encrypted by the System and placed it on the table. Only a specified person could open this letter, and outsiders had no way to discover its contents.

When Joking Scholar heard the price of 120 million Credits, his smiling expression immediately froze. He had nearly spat the black tea that was in his mouth, the teacup in his hand nearly falling to the ground due to his trembling.

“The 120 million Credits is the price of this encrypted letter?” Joking Scholar looked at the white envelope on the table, his facial expression turning extraordinarily ugly. His previously beady eyes abruptly widened as he sent a chilling glare at Shi Feng, coldly saying, “Master Black Flame, aren’t you going a little too overboard? We of Twilight Echo have come here with the sincerest intentions to conduct business with you. Are you looking down on Twilight Echo? Or do you not take Miss Aqua seriously?”

No matter how stupid Joking Scholar was, he knew that no transaction in God’s Domain could currently achieve such a frightening cost. That was 120 million Credits! Not 120 million Hell Money[1]! Such an amount was sufficient for a normal person to live the rest of their life in luxury! Even Joking Scholar himself would not earn such an amount in this lifetime!

The only possibility was that Shi Feng was toying with him, or that Shi Feng had already found out that he was a fake. However, as a preventive measure, he still used Aqua Rose’s name to warn Shi Feng.

Shi Feng calmly smiled at this Maitreya’s reaction. He paid no mind to Joking Scholar’s chilling and threatening gaze, unhurriedly saying, “How could you say such a thing? Weren’t you the one that suggested for the 30% increase in price?”

“I’ve fully followed our previous agreement and have brought what that Miss Aqua requested. Could Miss Aqua have forgotten to tell you about it? Or is it because you are fake?” A chilling light suddenly flashed in Shi Feng’s eyes as he loudly questioned.

“You!”

At this moment, Joking Scholar gnashed his teeth in anger.

Shi Feng had clearly pretended to be the fool here. Yet, he could not just reveal Shi Feng’s act.

“Master Black Flame, of course, I was sent here by Miss Aqua! Please stop trying to probe me! Miss Rose never agreed to this!” Joking Scholar was no fool. He thought that Shi Feng was currently trying to probe him, so he quickly cooled his temper.

“Probe? What reason would I have to probe you?” Shi Feng smiled as he said, “I am very serious. If Aqua Rose didn’t mention such an important agreement to you and you have no knowledge of it, then it seems you are indeed a fake. If that is so, then I am truly sorry. Our business transaction ends here.”

Saying so, Shi Feng stood and prepared to leave.

Joking Scholar immediately panicked. He could no longer discern whether Shi Feng’s words were true or not. In the beginning, he thought Shi Feng was trying to swindle him. Now, however, it would seem that his previous preconception might be wrong.

Have I really guessed wrong? Was this letter actually what they intended to trade? Joking Scholar felt that his brain was no longer sufficient to process this matter. He could not see through Shi Feng at all.

Previously, Shi Feng had expressed immense interest in continuing the trade. Now, however, Shi Feng was about to leave after scoffing. Just what was he supposed to do?

Joking Scholar had personally witnessed the benefits Aqua Rose had obtained through her transactions with Shi Feng. If Twilight Echo could periodically conduct similar trades with Shi Feng and obtain such immense profits every time, the other first-rate Guilds in their kingdom would have no chance to compete with them. They would become the tyrant of their kingdom.

Just by becoming the lord of a city, the benefits that ensued were enough to attract the world-class corporations’ investments. Not to mention receiving a few hundred million, they could even receive tens of billions of Credits. If Twilight Echo could become the tyrant of a kingdom, they could receive investments from over ten major corporations. The Credits they could earn were unimaginable. In comparison, the 120 million Credit transaction right now could be considered negligible.

However, 120 million Credits was not pocket change either. Moreover, their Guild had only obtained the many ores before him through the painstaking work. If they gave them all to Shi Feng, the losses would be mind-blowing.

Of course, if such a powerful benefit were truly available, it could greatly assist Twilight Echo in elevating its current position, becoming the tyrant of the capital city.

However, Joking Scholar could not see past Shi Feng’s thoughts at all. He did not know whether Shi Feng had the sincerity to continue their current cooperation. With his status, he did not dare make this gamble.

“Master Black Flame, please wait a minute! Maybe Miss Aqua has forgotten to mention this to me. I’ll have to ask Miss Aqua about this before making a decision. If there truly are no problems, then the 120 million Credits and these materials will all be yours.” Joking Scholar decided to hold Shi Feng back for now. He needed to report this matter to his superiors and let them decide what to do. That way, he won’t have to take responsibility for this matter.

TL Notes:

[1]Hell Money: a form of joss paper printed to resemble legal tender bank notes.The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors’ financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century. Early 20th century examples resembled minor commercial currency of the type issued by businesses across China until the mid-1940s.
