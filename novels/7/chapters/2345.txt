Chapter 2346 – Oppressing All Sides FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

As Shi Feng started collecting one dropped item after another, silence fell over the entire city.

“How is something like this even possible?!”

“Crap! Is he even human!?”

Everyone felt their world view crumble as they watched.

At this stage of the game, practically everyone had a healthy fear of war weapons. They could kill players in one hit, after all. War weapons could also cause significant damage to high-ranked monsters. Without Invulnerability Skills, players had no way to stand up against war weapons.

Relying on his own strength, Shi Feng successfully blocked every incoming cannonball and ballista arrow. Even his doppelgangers effortlessly deflected the hundreds of war weapon attacks. He was simply inhuman.

The various major powers’ members watched as Shi Feng steadily collected the loot with bloodshot eyes.

Every one of the Sunset King’s items radiated an incredibly powerful aura. In God’s Domain, such auras were proof of an item’s rarity and value. Even from so far away, they could see the Epic glow effect shining among the Sunset King’s loot, and a few items radiated a strange light and a faint trace of Divine Might.

“Kill him! Those items are mine!”

“Use Tier 4 Magic Scrolls! I refuse to believe he can stop those!”

The various major powers’ upper echelons nearly spat blood as they watched Shi Feng storing the Sunset King’s loot in his bag.

Had Shi Feng used an Invulnerability Skill to stop their attacks, they would’ve accepted their fate, but he blocked their attacks with his doppelgangers. With Doppelganger Skills’ average duration, Shi Feng would have more than enough time to collect all of the loot before his doppelgangers disappeared. If that happened, none of them would get anything from this Inferior Legendary Event.

A few of the major powers’ experts immediately retrieved the Tier 4 Magic Scrolls they had been saving and activated them against the Swordsman.

Tier 4 Spell, Heavenly Thunder!

Tier 4 Spell, Dark Domain of Arrows!

Tier 4, Hurricane Howl!

Have these people gone insane?! They’re actually using Tier 4 Magic Scrolls against him?! Lin Ya felt her scalp tingle as she watched the three Tier 4 Spells approach Shi Feng. At this stage of the game, Tier 4 Magic Scrolls were considered a part of a Guild’s foundation. Every one was worth as much as an ordinary Epic item.

Tier 4 Spells could do even more damage than Gnome Cannons and Large Ballistas, and not just because they commanded greater raw power. Players had full control of these Spells. They could manipulate the Spells’ trajectories and implement combat techniques as they cast them. Blocking a single Tier 4 Spell was impossible for current players, much less three.

Suddenly, a massive lightning bolt struck down on Shi Feng with enough speed to break the sound barrier.

At the same time, 12 dark arrows appeared around the Swordsman, each with enough power to rival a Mythic monster’s attacks.

Lastly, a gigantic tornado blotted out the sky as it rolled down toward Shi Feng.

These three Spells sealed off any path of escape for Shi Feng, and watching them move toward the Swordsman was like watching Armageddon begin.

The watching players felt their hearts skip a beat. The three Tier 4 Spells’ devastating power was stifling.

“How vicious!”

“That guy’s dead for sure now.”

“Not even a Mythic monster could take those Spells without suffering severe injuries.”

The general populace hadn’t expected Lake Mountain City’s various major powers to be so vicious and decisive. Not even superpowers would casually waste Tier 4 Magic Scrolls on a single player.

“Death awaits any who oppose us! Let’s see how you intend to block these attacks!”

The various major powers eagerly watched the Tier 4 Spells assault Shi Feng, waiting for the moment the Swordsman died and dropped all of the items he had claimed thus far.

However, as everyone expected the Tier 4 Spells to devour Shi Feng, the Swordsman’s aura exploded, and a strange black energy enveloped his body.

Power of Darkness!

“Scram!”

Shi Feng bellowed as he brandished Killing Ray.

Secret Technique, Lightning Flash!

Sword lights immediately appeared around him, cutting down the incoming streams of Mana. The lightning bolt and dark arrows scattered, and he sliced the descending tornado cleanly in two, dissipating the violent wind.

Silence!

As if time had frozen, silence filled Lake Mountain City.

The city’s independent players, the various major powers’ members, even Giant’s Heart’s members stared, dumbfounded.

Those three Tier 4 Spells would’ve even injured a Mythic monster, yet Shi Feng had countered all three with a single swing of his sword...

“How is this possible?!”

The upper echelons from the three major powers that had used the Tier 4 Magic Scrolls were frozen in shock.

They had originally saved the Tier 4 Magic Scrolls as trump cards to use against Mythic monsters, yet Shi Feng had stopped all three effortlessly. He hadn’t even lost a single HP, much less been injured.

So strong! Is this the true power of a Tier 3 class? Lin Ya felt overwhelmed as she watched Shi Feng.

She had seen the strength of a Tier 3 class when Shi Feng had fought the two Rock Giants outside the temple, but she hadn’t realized that a Tier 3 class was powerful enough to nullify Tier 4 Spells.

With such strength, none of God’s Domain’s superpowers could touch Shi Feng. He was on an entirely different level compared to Tier 2 players. Before a Tier 3 player, a Tier 2 player was no more than an infant learning how to walk.

Thank goodness! I’m so glad I didn’t pick a fight with him! I’d be doomed! Silent Rain inwardly celebrated after seeing Shi Feng emerged from the Tier 4 Spell bombardment unscathed.

Silent Rain had considered plotting a way to steal the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, but after this performance, he knew that not even a superpower’s main army could take that Swordsman down.

War Blood and Starlin are truly unlucky to have provoked such an individual. White Autumn couldn’t help but pity the two organizations.

War Blood and Starlink would’ve already found Zero Wing to be an incredibly challenging opponent with its Guardian Puppets and Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, but with a player like Ye Feng to protect the Guild as well, Zero Wing was essentially a natural disaster for the two organizations.

After countering the three Tier 4 Spells, Shi Feng glanced at the approaching players. These players, who still intended to fight for the Sunset King’s loot, halted their steps immediately. Even the various major powers leading the charge stopped, quietly watching Shi Feng. None of them dared to take even half a step closer, afraid of attracting the Swordsman’s attention.

They’d be gambling their lives if they tried to snatch the items from such a monstrous being. Even if they got their hands on one of the dropped items, they wouldn’t be able to escape with it. They’d just become a target for Shi Feng to practice his swordsmanship.

Seeing these players abandon their contest for the Sunset King’s loot, Shi Feng turned around and resumed his work. Everyone merely watched as he quietly gathered the remaining items.

“Who is that guy? Isn’t he a little too strong? He actually deterred an entire city of players by himself.”

“I know, right? Not even the Sea God’s Realm’s number one player, Scarlet Hand, would be a match for him.”

The players in the vicinity began to admire Shi Feng. They were also incredibly curious about his identity. As for the Sunset King’s loot, none of them dared object to the situation anymore.

Once Shi Feng had collected the dropped items, he quickly approached White Autumn, handing over the Mutated Heart. If possible, he wanted to leave Lake Mountain City as soon as he could. He planned to return to White River City immediately. Only there would he be safe enough to appraise the Sunset King’s loot.

In return for the Mutated Heart, White Autumn gave Shi Feng a whopping 10 Ocean Barrier Stones. Shi Feng then retrieved a Return Scroll and activated it, transforming into a streak of light and leaving the Sea God’s Realm.
