Chapter 2737 – Wealthy Shi Feng

Silverwing City, southern district:

On a sparsely populated street, four players wearing Black Cloaks walked slowly into an alleyway. They would also occasionally observe their surroundings to guard against being followed.

After the four of them walked a certain distance into the alleyway and verified that there were indeed no players following them, they breathed out a sigh of relief.

“What is this Black Flame trying to do? Why must we act so secretively and not let others notice us?” a female Guardian Knight with shoulder-length hair demanded in dissatisfaction.

“Blue!” Illusory Words, the Cleric in holy white robes, glared at the female Knight standing beside her. “I made an exception and brought you here this time! You’d best pay attention to your words and actions!”

Blue Gown was the vice commander and lead MT of the main force under Illusory Words’s command. She ranked third among the Guild’s new talents and was also Illusory Words’s confidant, who would succeed Illusory Words as Vice Guild Leader in the future. Unfortunately, Blue Gown had a common failing, one that plagued all newcomers trained by superpowers-she did not place anyone outside of super-first-rate Guilds and Super Guilds in her eyes.

After Illusory Words’s scathing reprimand, the beautiful female Knight dared not continue with her complaints.

“Big Sis Illusory, I won’t talk about this anymore, so you mustn’t forget to bring me along for future matters,” Blue Gown said pitifully.

“Pay attention next time,” Illusory Words said as she gave Blue Gown a pampering look. She then turned to Unyielding Soul and Mu Lingsha and said, “I apologize for letting you see such a joke.”

“It’s normal for newcomers to be a little arrogant. You can’t achieve anything if you don’t have such arrogance. You don’t have to mind us, Vice Guild Leader Illusory,” Unyielding Heart said. He had long since gotten used to similar sights.

In any other virtual reality game, being one of the top-ranking newcomers of a super-first-rate Guild was indeed something worth boasting about. After all, a single super-first-rate Guild or Super Guild was more than enough to rule an entire virtual reality game back then. How could the top talents of such Guilds not be a little arrogant?

Hence, it was only natural that these newcomers looked down on up-and-coming Guilds.

However, the situation was different now. At this point, God’s Domain was practically a unique existence already—a game that even international corporations poked their hands into. The influence the various powers in God’s Domain held was thousands of times greater than what they held in other virtual reality games. One couldn’t use common sense to judge the powers operating within the game at all.

Meanwhile, when Blue Gown heard Unyielding Heart’s words, although she didn’t say anything in response, her eyes held a hint of dissatisfaction.

“However, I wonder why Guild Leader Black Flame called both our Guilds over this time? He even instructed us to keep our visit a secret,” Mu Lingsha said.

The current Zero Wing was like the midday sun. Its current problems had a very easy solution: let major corporations invest in the Guild.

So long as Zero Wing possessed sufficient capital and background, maintaining its current sphere of influence would be a piece of cake.

However, Shi Feng did not do so. Instead, he had asked their two Guilds over to discuss business. Mu Lingsha couldn’t help her puzzlement over Shi Feng’s solution to Zero Wing’s current predicament.

“I can’t even begin to guess Guild Leader Black Flame’s thoughts, but based on his approach this time, I suspect this isn’t going to be a simple matter,” Illusory Words said, shaking her head.

Shi Feng had brought her too many surprises and miracles. Now, she wouldn’t find it surprising if he created another miracle. After all, Zero Wing had even managed to help Frost Heaven secure the sixth reserve seat. “We don’t need to guess anymore.” Pointing at tall walls some distance ahead, Unyielding Heart said, “That should be the place Guild Leader Black Flame told us about. Let’s just head inside and listen to why he called us over.”

When Illusory Words and the others saw the walls Unyielding Heart indicated, they were a little surprised. They never thought that the depths of this small alley would conceal such a massive structure.

Although the walls were only around a dozen meters in height, the area they occupied was significant. The enclosure they formed could easily fit a football stadium. Based on the enclosure’s size, the building inside should be at the Advanced Construction standard at the very minimum, yet nobody had discovered its existence, even now. When the group of four arrived before the steel gate in one of the tall walls, they were dumbfounded.

Four Level 130-plus Fine-Gold Guards manned the gate. There was even a Level 133, Tier 3 Dark-Gold ranked Great Mage protecting the gate in secret. The level of security was astonishing.

At this stage of the game, if these five NPCs worked together, they could annihilate a 1,000-man team of Tier 3 players.

Moreover, the various large Guilds were treating Fine-Gold and Dark-Gold Guards like precious treasures, showering them with all sorts of resources and ensuring their safety as much as possible. On the other hand, Zero Wing was actually using these precious guards as gatekeepers.

“This is private property. What business do you have here?” a Fine-Gold Guard clad in gray leather armor asked in a hostile tone when he saw Unyielding Heart’s group. “We were invited by Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Unyielding Heart promptly took out the invitation he received from Zero Wing, which had Zero Wing’s Guild Leader’s seal to prove its authenticity. “The magical mark is correct.” The Tier 3 Assassin clad in leather armor nodded. He then said, “Please follow me.”

“Okay.”

Unyielding Heart’s group then followed the Tier 3 Assassin through the gate.

Upon walking through the entrance, Unyielding Heart and the others gasped automatically.

“A Teleportation Hall?!”

“How is this possible?! Aren’t Teleportation Halls restricted to the national level?!”

Blue Gown couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the five-story-tall Teleportation Hall before her. She never thought Zero Wing could actually construct this sort of transportation tool in Silverwing City.

Even now, teleportation arrays were incredibly rare items among the superpowers, what more a complete Teleportation Hall. Teleportation Halls might be common in NPC cities, but for Guild Cities, they were priceless treasures that could skyrocket a Guild City into prominence. The world of God’s Domain was massive. It took a long time for players to travel to Level 100-plus maps even on Flying Mounts and much longer for players without Flying Mounts.

Many powers and adventurer teams would be willing to break the bank if it meant they could teleport directly to somewhere close to Level 100-plus neutral maps. After all, time represented both money and opportunities for these people. Unlike ordinary players, they couldn’t afford to progress at a leisurely pace.

“So, this is why we were required to come here quietly? How astonishing.” Unyielding Heart smiled bitterly as he looked at the Teleportation Hall. “This should be one of the privileges given to Guilds officially recognized by the War God’s Temple,” Illusory Words said, a hint of envy in her eyes. With such a privilege, developing a Guild City would be a piece of cake. Moreover, Silverwing City possessed an excellent environment and strategic location.

“That’s right. This is indeed one of the privileges of an Official Guild.”

A voice suddenly entered the ears of Illusory Words and the others, answering the question in their hearts.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, is this Teleportation Hall the important matter you wish to discuss?” Unyielding Heart asked in slight confusion as he pointed at the Teleportation Hall.

A Teleportation Hall was a godly development tool. So long as Zero Wing publicized the existence of its Teleportation Hall, combined with Silverwing City’s defenses, Silverwing City would have no problem developing rapidly; Unyielding Soul and Crimson Emperor’s participation wouldn’t make a difference in the endeavor. In fact, their two Guilds would want to ask Zero Wing for help instead. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Yes, but that’s not all of it.” Shi Feng nodded. He then smiled and said, “There’s no point in telling you about it now. Follow me.”

After saying so, Shi Feng promptly made his way inside the Teleportation Hall.

After Unyielding Heart, Mu Lingsha, Illusory Words, and Blue Gown exchanged looks, they followed him.

The next moment after the four stepped onto the teleportation array inside the Teleportation Hall, they found themselves inside the Twin Towers Kingdom’s Sky Spring City.

At this time, however, Sky Spring City didn’t have many players. Over 99% of the city’s population consisted of NPCs. When these NPCs saw Unyielding Heart’s group, they even began eyeing the group curiously as if they had just encountered some rare creatures.

“Let’s go. There are too many people here.” After glancing at the NPCs observing them, Shi Feng took out a Tier 3 Group Teleportation Scroll from his bag and activated it.

Before Unyielding Heart and the others could react, they were already over 10,000 yards outside of Sky Spring City.

Afterward, Shi Feng summoned the Thunder Eagle and ferried the group through the air for over half an hour. At the end of their journey, the group arrived at an ancient tower that pierced the clouds. The tower was easily over a thousand meters tall.

“The Secret Covenant Tower?” Illusory Words instantly recognized the ancient tower. Curious, she asked, “Why are we here?” She knew a little about the Twin Towers Kingdom’s Secret Covenant Tower.

The Secret Covenant Tower was an excellent leveling ground for players who had yet to reach Level 100. And while there was an entrance fee of one Magic Crystal per person, so long as players didn’t die, they could grind inside the tower for as long as they wanted.

Initially, many large Guilds had brought their new members here to increase their levels quickly. Only, after the introduction of several expansion packs, many more leveling spots became available. Since the monsters inside the Secret Covenant Tower didn’t drop any good loot, the various powers had opted to power-level their new members elsewhere.

With mainstream players having long since exceeded Level 100, the Secret Covenant Tower was now a thing of the past. “To grow stronger,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “To grow stronger?” Illusory Words was slightly surprised by Shi Feng’s words. “But we have long since passed Level 100.”

“The current Secret Covenant Tower’s limit is no longer Level 100,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. “Before the major update, the tower’s open underground levels were only up to the 18th floor. Back then, the tower was, at best, suitable for players up to Level 99. However, the tower’s open underground levels are now up to the 36th floor, and the monsters inside reach up to Level 150.

“Vice Guild Leader Illusory, I’m sure you understand what this means, right?”

When Shi Feng finished speaking, the eyes of Illusory Words and Unyielding Heart lit up with excitement.

Nowadays, due to the large number of NPCs competing for quests and monsters, leveling up had become incredibly troublesome. Yet, levels were what players currently lacked the most.

If, at the cost of one Magic Crystal per person, players could freely grind the crazed monsters inside the Secret Covenant Tower, their leveling speed would be much faster than what they could achieve in the outside world.“Guild Leader Black Flame, do you mean for us to cordon off the Secret Covenant Tower, monopolize it for ourselves, and let our Guild members level up rapidly?” Unyielding Heart asked, a hint of excitement in his voice.

It had originally already been difficult for players to level up past Level 100. With the additional competition from NPCs, the endeavor only became even more challenging. However, if Zero Wing, Unyielding Soul, and Crimson Emperor had a way to allow their members to reach Level 120 rapidly and start challenging their Tier 4 Promotion Quests, their Guilds’ development speed could surpass the other superpowers by a large margin.

“No, I don’t mean to cordon off the Secret Covenant Tower.” Shi Feng shook his head.

“Then?” Unyielding Heart prompted, confused by Shi Feng’s answer. “I want to thoroughly seal off Sky Spring City!” Shi Feng’s eyes gleamed with a manic light at this proclamation. “Aside from the members of our three Guilds, we will prohibit all outsiders from setting foot in Sky Spring City!”

“Cordon off the entire Sky Spring City?” Unyielding Heart was stunned.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, isn’t that a little overboard?” Illusory Words asked in confusion. “While the Secret Covenant Tower can indeed provide faster leveling, the manpower required to thoroughly cordon off an NPC city is too much. With the current state of the game, it will be incredibly taxing for our three Guilds to do so.”

Due to the NPC population boom, the various superpowers were short on manpower. Meanwhile, even if Sky Spring City was in decline, its player population still exceeded 100,000. The manpower required to chase away all these players from the city was no laughing matter. Not to mention, their three Guilds would also have to station many players in the city long-term.

“If we were doing this only for levels, it would indeed be a waste to cordon off the entire city,” Shi Feng said. He then walked to the Secret Covenant Tower, pointed at the second-floor teleportation array that led to the 19th underground floor, and looked at Illusory Words and the others. He then smiled and continued, “But what if the Secret Covenant Tower contains complete Legacies for the various Tier 3 classes?”
