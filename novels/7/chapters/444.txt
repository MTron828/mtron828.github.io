Chapter 445 - Golden Stone Tablet

Silver flames engulfed a stone pillar. Everything within 10 yards of this flame had been incinerated, transformed into a field of white ash.

“Guild Leader, the hidden door is inside this flame,” Fire Dance said as she pointed towards the silver fire.

Just before Shi Feng moved closer to have a better look, Fire Dance held him back, saying, “Guild Leader, be careful. The silver fire is extremely hot. When I stepped into that scorched region, I immediately lost 2,000 HP.”

“Such high flame damage?” Although Shi Feng could tell that the silver flame was something extraordinary, he had not expected it to be so powerful.

If it could deal -2,000 damage to players every second, he would take significant damage even with his 70 points in Fire Resistance. Even he would die if he occupied the region too long.

“Violet, heal me. I’ll go in and take a closer look.” After giving the order, Shi Feng entered the silver flame’s effective area.

Suddenly, a damage close to -500 points appeared above Shi Feng’s head.

Hot. Shi Feng felt as if he had dipped his feet into a hot spring the moment his boots touched the gray-white land.

He was even wearing the Flame Boots, which lowered the temperature his feet felt. If he had equipped some other shoes, he would probably have had to skip and hop constantly while inside this scorched region.

Following which, Shi Feng approached the burning stone pillar. The closer he got to the stone pillar, the higher the temperature became. Similarly, the damage he received also increased. When Shi Feng was roughly two yards from the pillar, he lost over 1,000 HP every second. Even though Shi Feng had long since recovered from his Weakened state, his HP returning to over 8,400, he would only last 9 seconds at most.

Fortunately, he had a powerful healer, Violet Cloud, supporting him. After Violet Cloud cast a Sacred Shield on him, he could just barely cope with the high DoT.

Sure enough, there’s a hidden door here. Shi Feng noticed that there was a tightly shut door on the burning stone pillar. There was also a blue chain not far from the door.

Shi Feng grabbed the blue chain, searching for a connection with the door.

However, the instant he touched the chain, Shi Feng suddenly felt a chill wash over him. The fire damage he received suddenly reduced from over -1,000 damage to just around -600 damage.

This chain really is special. I wonder what it is made of? It could be useful if I could find a way to take it. Shi Feng examined the blue chain, sorely tempted.

If he could claim this chain, raiding flame-type Dungeons or facing fire-type Bosses would become much easier. Just holding the chain increased his Fire Resistance by at least 40 to 50 points. It was even more impressive than an Intermediate Fire Resistance Potion. Moreover, the latter only had a duration of 1 hour, whereas one only needed to hold the former to gain the buff. Just how much money could he save on Fire Resistance Potions?

As Shi Feng pulled the blue chain, the stone door in the middle of the massive pillar opened slowly. A dark passage with zero visibility lay beyond the threshold.

After the stone door opened, the silver flames diminished gradually until they had been extinguished. Shortly after, the scorched earth also began to cool, allowing players to transverse through the region freely.

“Guild Leader, you’re amazing! Your Fire Resistance is so high! No one else could reach and open the door, even if they knew about it,” Blackie laughed.

Although they had obtained a bounty from this Land of the Fallen Star, it would mean nothing if they could not find their way out.

“Let’s go.” Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and the Purgatory’s Shadow as he crossed the threshold cautiously.

The passage beyond the stone door was cramped, and engravings of ancient texts and drawings decorated the walls on either side. From the looks of them, these texts and drawings seem to originate from an ancient era, and not even Shi Feng, someone who was very familiar with God’s Domain, recognized them.

The passage allowed, at most, three people to walk abreast, so it would be extremely challenging to coordinate their attacks. Fortunately, the party did not encounter a single monster along their entire journey.

After wandering down the passage for over half an hour, the party arrived at a towering altar.

Massive statues of wolf-headed men guarded each side of the altar, and the silver flame dancing on the altar was the same flame Shi Feng and the others had seen outside the stone door.

A short distance to the right of the altar, there was a teleportation magic array. A stone tablet emitting a golden glow sat to the left of the altar. Divine runes and drawings covered the tablet, and one could tell with a glance that the tablet was something extraordinary.

As the team walked up to the altar, they suddenly felt an extraordinary pressure weighing down on them. It felt as if someone pummeled them repeatedly with a sledgehammer.

“Guild Leader, look... over there...” Blackie said as he pointed at the space above the altar, goosebumps covering his skin.

Everyone shifted their gaze to where Blackie pointed.

A figure hovered above the altar, but due to the poor lighting around the altar, they could not see it clearly. However, they could feel an intense threat of death emanating from this figure.

Shi Feng could not get a clear view of that figure, either. However, he could feel this figure looking down at them.

Shi Feng then activated Omniscient Eyes and observed the figure.

The results were shocking.

[Anubis’s Gatekeeper] (Great Lord)

Level 30

HP 10,000,000/10,000,000

“Great Lord?” Shi Feng muttered.

Others might not realize how powerful a Great Lord was in God’s Domain, but Shi Feng knew full well what one was capable of. Their party of six would not even be enough to fill the gaps between this Gatekeeper’s teeth. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was especially true for such Field Great Lords. Although their HPs were far lower than Great Lords in Dungeons, Field Great Lords were more powerful. Even a team of several thousand Level 30 players would be no more than cannon fodder before this Gatekeeper.

“He won’t attack us, right?” Aqua Rose asked, feeling somewhat nervous as she watched Anubis’s Gatekeeper.

Aqua Rose wasn’t the only one nervous. Even Shi Feng struggled to keep his cool.

“Hopefully not,” Shi Feng said uncertainty. “However, since he hasn’t moved since we’ve arrived, let’s not take any risks.”

If Anubis’s Gatekeeper took the initiative to attack, even Shi Feng would be helpless against it. They could only try to escape. They would only throw away their lives if they tried to confront it. Attempting to find some trick against it would also be suicidal. Powerhouses such as Great Lords wouldn’t afford players such a chance.

According to the tiers of God’s Domain, a Great Lord was the equivalent of a Tier 3 class.

A Tier 3 class was as powerful as the city lord of an ordinary city.

After Shi Feng and the others silently examined the area, they faintly understood their situation.

“That Gatekeeper should be a monster tasked with guarding the golden stone tablet. So long as we don’t touch that thing, the Gatekeeper won’t attack us.”

Shi Feng had experimented with the Gatekeeper. When he approached the golden stone tablet, the Gatekeeper’s killing intent would intensify. As for the teleportation array on the other side, the Gatekeeper had not reacted when he had approached it.

“Aqua, you guys activate the teleportation array.” After some thought, Shi Feng said, “I’ll grab that tablet.”

“Guild Leader, that’s a Great Lord!” Fire Dance said, horrified.

Although none of them had ever seen a Great Lord in action, they could tell that, compared to this Great Lord, the Crimson Shadow Wolf they had previously faced was a joke. If Shi Feng really tried to steal the golden stone tablet, he might die in an instant.
