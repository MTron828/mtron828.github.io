Chapter 621 – Eternal Magic Armor

“These are…Eternal God Crystals?”

Shi Feng couldn’t help but doubt his eyes when he saw the piles of purple-black crystals Gentle Snow took out.

Eternal God Crystals!

This was a rare kind of God Crystal found in the Eternal Realm. While it might be different from the God Crystals acquired by human players in the Greater God’s Domain, it possessed all the effects and functions of the standard God Crystal.

In addition, unlike ordinary God Crystals, Eternal God Crystals could be absorbed by players.

Ordinary God Crystals were crystals made from concentrating the power of Gods. The creation of each God Crystal required a God to expend a significant amount of their power. Meanwhile, not only could these God Crystals be used to help Gods recover their power quickly, but they could also be used to repair weapons and equipment created by Gods.

Eternal God Crystals, on the other hand, were different. They were naturally occurring crystals found only in the Eternal Realm. Hence, even Tier 1 players could make use of Eternal God Crystals.

So long as a player absorbed an Eternal God Crystal, not only could they receive bursts of inspiration for a short period, but their Concentration and Mana Perception standards would also be temporarily increased by one rank. Whether players were looking to construct a Mana Body or a Divine Body, Eternal God Crystals could provide them with extraordinary assistance.

Meanwhile, the rarity of Eternal God Crystals far exceeded ordinary God Crystals and Fragmented Legendary items. Because of this, the market value of Eternal God Crystals could easily reach three ordinary God Crystals per Eternal God Crystal during Shi Feng’s previous life. Even then, few players would be willing to part with their Eternal God Crystals at this price.

However, while Eternal God Crystals offered many benefits, they also had a glaring flaw—they would drop on death, and they could not be stored in warehouses for long periods. Players must carry their Eternal God Crystals on them or use them quickly.

Currently, Shi Feng counted at least 400 Eternal God Crystals piled up before him. This was even more than the total number of Eternal God Crystals he had seen throughout his previous life…

“I’ve already tallied everything up. We obtained a total of 435 Eternal God Crystals,” Hidden Soul said excitedly as she walked over to Shi Feng and Gentle Snow. “Besides that, the Holy Race commander also dropped an Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set Design. It is a Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set that can be used to form Bronze Battle Arrays when present in large numbers.

“If we have 20 sets in a team, we can form a Small Bronze Battle Array. If we have 100 sets, we can form a Medium Bronze Battle Array. If we have 500 sets, we can form a Large Bronze Battle Array. If we can equip a team of 500 Tier 5 players with these sets, killing even Tier 6 Gods won’t be out of the question. Honestly, I can’t figure out why that Holy Race commander would carry such a priceless treasure on him.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Eternal Magic Armor’s design? Shi Feng couldn’t help but quickly read through the thick book Gentle Snow just took out.

The Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set’s name rang loudly in the Greater God’s Domain during his previous life. It was an equipment set rivaling the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Luminous Set. In fact, in terms of Basic Attributes, it even surpassed the Luminous Set. Moreover, unlike the Luminous Set, the Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set could be used by both human and Holy Race players.

The only problem was that the production of the Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set required Eternal God Crystals. Mass-producing the set was simply too difficult of a feat to accomplish. As far as he knew, only three full batches of 500 sets had ever been made, of which two batches belonged to the Holy Race, while one batch belonged to the Eternal Chamber of Commerce.

Seeing that the Holy Race commander had dropped the Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set Design, Shi Feng had reason to believe that the other party didn’t even bother to inspect the loot he acquired from the Guardian Dragon before pursuing Billowing Water and the rest of the Dawnlight Party. Otherwise, there was no way he would carry such a priceless treasure on him and risk losing it. He would have definitely chosen to store it in a warehouse for safekeeping right away.

As expected of the Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set… Just producing one set costs six Eternal God Crystals. Most of the apex powers back then probably can’t even afford to produce 500 sets. Shi Feng couldn’t help but be astonished when he finished studying the design.

The Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set was a six-piece set with a relatively low production difficulty. The average Grandmaster Forger could probably manufacture it at a considerably high success rate. The other materials required to produce the set were also easy to source. The only real problem was the Eternal God Crystals required.

He would need three thousand Eternal God Crystals if he wanted to produce a full batch of 500 sets. Even if he counted both his previous and present lives, he had never seen such an amount…

“Let’s hurry back to the Crystal City, Guild Leader. It’s not safe here,” Gentle Snow suggested. “If the Holy Race players find out what they’ve lost, they definitely won’t let us go.”

Although she didn’t know how the Holy Race viewed Eternal God Crystals, even a fool could tell the value of the Eternal Magic Armor Equipment Set Design. It was a treasure that could lead to the birth of an apex power. If the Holy Race players were to learn of their loss, they absolutely would go crazy.

“We might have gained a lot this time, but it is still too early to return. It’s especially so now that we have obtained such a valuable design,” Shi Feng said, smiling as he put the design away. “Have everyone take a break. We’ll be changing our route. Instead of the City Lord’s Mansion, we’ll be heading for the city’s underground treasury!”

“The city’s treasury?”

“Do you know where the Nameless City’s treasury is, Guild Leader?”

When Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul heard Shi Feng’s words, their eyes instantly brightened, and they couldn’t help but get the urge to shake an answer out of Shi Feng.

The Nameless City was undoubtedly a place of riches. This could be seen just by their harvest in the short time they spent here. Meanwhile, a city’s treasury usually stored the wealth the city had accumulated throughout the years. One could say that most of a city’s wealth could be found in its treasury.

Normally, when players were looking to capture a city, their foremost priority would be the city’s treasury, whereas the City Lord’s Mansion’s priority came in second. However, as city treasuries were usually hidden in secretive locations and made difficult to find, players almost always had no choice but to capture the City Lord’s Mansion first. That way, they would immediately learn the location of the city’s treasury. Not to mention, they could utilize the city’s barrier to weaken their enemies in the city.

Of course, it would be a different story if players learned of the location of the city’s treasury ahead of time.

“Naturally.” Shi Feng smiled and nodded. “So, rest up and get ready.”

Previously, he was utterly powerless against the Gorgon Queen, so he had no choice but to avoid her like the plague. But now that he had learned the Advanced Bronze Mana Purification Technique and included Azure Shadow’s group in his team, he felt they could fight the Primordial Godkin. Hence, he naturally wouldn’t let this opportunity slip by him.

Not to mention, the early liberation of the Soul-Eating Ancestor would most certainly accelerate the Holy Race’s development. If Zero Wing wanted a better chance at surviving and thriving in the upcoming Holy Mana War, it couldn’t rely on just the Mana Purification Technique. It would also need the Nameless City’s treasury.
