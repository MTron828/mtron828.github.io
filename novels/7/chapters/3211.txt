Chapter 286 – Sword Emperor and Sword Emperor

This… How is this possible?! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Death Omen’s mouth nearly fell wide open when she saw the 22 Tier 3 players from Zero Wing’s team giving off an aura no different than that of Tier 4 players.

It was incredibly challenging to increase the strength of one’s mana in God’s Domain. Although some tools could accomplish this feat, the effects of these tools were limited. Moreover, most of them could only take effect on one player. Even so, these tools were still considered rare and precious treasures in God’s Domain, so much so that not even the Paimon Conglomerate would be willing to provide such tools to its internal geniuses.

As for tools capable of improving the mana of multiple players? It went without saying that the value of such tools would be exponentially greater.

Yet, now, Zero Wing had taken out four of such tools. How could Death Omen not be in disbelief?

At this moment, even the Paimon Conglomerate’s geniuses were stunned by this situation.

Such wealth was something not even the Paimon Conglomerate could take out in the Miniature Ancient World. Moreover, even if the Paimon Conglomerate had such tools in the Miniature Ancient World, it wouldn’t hand these tools over to developing geniuses like themselves.

After all, such behavior was already beyond prodigal.

It should be known that Zero Wing’s Magic Tactical Vehicles were not Immortal items. The tactical vehicles would get damaged when attacked and become useless after their durability fell to zero.

Meanwhile, monsters would typically prioritize attacking items capable of improving players’ mana, such as the Magic Tactical Vehicle. They wouldn’t simply stand still and do nothing as the Magic Tactical Vehicle was strengthening the players trying to kill them.

Hence, taking out something as precious and fragile as the Magic Tactical Vehicle in front of so many Tier 4 Great Demons was an incredibly crazy move.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, isn’t it a little too much to take out four Magic Tactical Vehicles?” Colorful Lunarite asked anxiously when she saw the nearby Tier 4 Great Demons turning their attention to the Magic Tactical Vehicles.

......

The Great Demons were not only numerous, but every one of them could also use Tier 4 Spells. Even though their team had switched to focusing solely on defense, the Magic Tactical Vehicles’ durability was still decreasing steadily.

Rather than risk losing four Magic Tactical Vehicles, it’d be wiser to risk only two instead. After all, they should be able to keep themselves alive with just 12 players with Tier 4 mana.

“No, this number is just right,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. Then, he turned to look at the Paimon Conglomerate’s team, which was rapidly advancing toward the temple, and continued, “Any less, and we’ll have trouble competing with the other side.”

If they were simply looking to stay alive, he naturally wouldn’t take out four Magic Tactical Vehicles and risk losing all of them. After all, he didn’t have an unlimited supply of these powerful war weapons. He could only exchange a limited number of Magic Tactical Vehicles each month.

However, his current goal was to rescue the Dragon Princess. This meant that a clash with the Paimon Conglomerate’s team would be inevitable.

While it was true that their team had many players with Tier 4 mana, the combat standards of Su Qianliu and the others were significantly inferior to the Paimon Conglomerate’s geniuses. The gap was so significant that Meteor and Star Snail could kill Su Qianliu and the others all by themselves.

After all, fights between players differed from fights between players and monsters. Monsters possessed a significant HP advantage. Because of this, even the God-ranked Expert List’s top five experts would have great difficulty soloing a Tier 4 Mythic monster of the same level. However, if these top five experts were to fight players of the same level and tier, they would only need a few moves to finish the fight.

Not to mention, even with 23 Tier 4 combatants on their team, their speed of advance was only slightly faster than the Paimon Conglomerate’s team, which had only ten Tier 4 experts. Moreover, this was under the situation where the Paimon Conglomerate’s team was still conserving its strength. Hence, the use of four Magic Tactical Vehicles was absolutely necessary if they wanted to surpass the Paimon Conglomerate’s team.

“Competing with the other side?” Colorful Lunarite turned to look at the Demon King guarding the temple’s entrance when she heard Shi Feng’s words, and she couldn’t help but feel that Shi Feng was joking with her.

Unlike Nether King Diaclo, Demon King Firenze wasn’t a severely weakened Tier 5 monster. Instead, he was a Tier 5 Demon King capable of effortlessly annihilating Tier 4 teams!

.

The reason the Paimon Conglomerate’s team dared to come here must mean that they had come prepared. However, that was not the case at all for their team. They were dragged into this mess, so they didn’t come prepared in the slightest…

When Shi Feng, Colorful Lunarite, and the others reached within 100 yards of the temple’s entrance, the Paimon Conglomerate’s Meteor and Star Snail suddenly activated their Tier 4 Berserk Skills and charged for the temple’s entrance at full speed.

When Firenze saw this, he swung his scepter left and right, instantly creating two Tier 5 magic arrays beneath his feet.

Tier 5 Spell, Spatial Smash!

Tier 5 Spell, Dark Paradise!

Immediately, with Firenze as the center, space within a 100-yard radius ruptured, and spatial tears formed rapidly. At the same time, dark orbs capable of pulverizing space covered the ruptured space, the combination making it nigh-impossible for anyone to reach the temple’s entrance unharmed.

Su Qianliu and the others were rendered speechless by this scene.

The average Tier 5 monster was plenty terrifying already. Yet, on top of having Tier 5 Basic Attributes and Tier 5 Spells, Firenze also possessed control and mastery over Spells that could put Domain Realm experts to shame.

Tier 5 Spells were incredibly complex, and even peak magical class experts could, at best, employ speed-casting on Tier 5 Spells. Silent casting was simply out of the question for peak experts, let alone double silent casting. Moreover, Firenze perfectly combined the two Spells into a Tier 5 Combination Spell.

In terms of raw power, a Tier 5 Combination Spell was several times stronger than an ordinary Tier 5 Spell. Even Tier 5 players wouldn’t dare to try to receive such a Spell.

However, the Demon Monarch’s Tier 5 Combination Spell did not faze Meteor and Star Snail in the slightest. Immediately, Star Snail transformed her shield into multiple magic barriers, drastically increasing her defensive capabilities. Then, with the help of these magic barriers, she briefly stopped the spatial tears spreading in her direction, opening a path for Meteor to advance through safely.

As for Meteor, he transformed his broken sword into hundreds of threads. Then, he used these threads to guide the dark orbs floating in the air and have them float toward Firenze, his control over the flow of strength simply extraordinary. Under Meteor’s manipulation, it looked as if he were the one who had cast Dark Paradise instead of Firenze.

When Firenze saw this, he suddenly waved his scepter and transformed it into numerous lightning bolts that erratically spread to the surroundings. Not only did these lightning bolts break apart the approaching dark orbs, they also created a lightning field that prevented Meteor from moving within 50 yards of the temple’s entrance.

Absolute Control?!

After trying and failing to deflect the oncoming lightning bolts a few times, Meteor’s expression quickly turned grave.

Absolute Control could be regarded as an incredibly tricky mana manipulation technique to deal with. If a spellcaster knew Absolute Control, they could continue exerting control over their one-time-use Spells after launching them. They could even correct the trajectory of an Offensive Spell that had been deflected.

While Meteor was trying to figure out how he could get past the several hundred lightning bolts and reach the temple’s entrance without getting hit, a figure suddenly dashed past him and entered the lightning field.

Is he crazy? Meteor grew confused when he saw Shi Feng charging into the lightning field.

Every one of the lightning bolts Firenze summoned carried power at the Tier 5 Advanced standard. Even with a Berserk Skill activated, a Tier 4 player could, at most, survive a few hits. In a situation where it was impossible to evade or deflect these lightning bolts, there was no way a Tier 4 player could get past this lightning field alive.

“Are you that eager to die?”

When Firenze saw Shi Feng charging into his lightning field, he promptly had them attack him in an irregular pattern.

Demon God’s Armament!

Godslayer!

Shi Feng executed Sword’s Orbit without hesitation when he saw the several hundred oncoming lightning bolts.
