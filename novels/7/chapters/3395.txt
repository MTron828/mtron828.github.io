Chapter 470 – One Move?

“Six?” Mad Blade laughed at Shi Feng’s comment. “Do you think you’re the War God’s Temple’s Grand Adjudicator?”

War Goddesses were the War God’s Temple’s strongest combatants, and the birth of every War Goddess came with great difficulty. Even the War God’s Temple’s main headquarters did not have many War Goddesses operating directly under it.

Meanwhile, the War God’s Temple’s Grand Adjudicator was the only person with authority to command the main headquarters’ War Goddesses.

However, as soon as Mad Blade finished speaking, Shi Feng injected 5,000 more units of Seven Luminaries Crystal into the Feather of Oath, causing five lightning bolts to descend from the sky. Then, once the dust settled, five more lithe figures appeared before Shi Feng. Of these women, some wielded shields, some wielded greatswords, and some wielded great bows.

Everyone involuntarily gasped when they saw the six War Goddesses standing in a row in front of Shi Feng.

How is this possible?!

Unrestrained Lionheart’s eyes nearly fell out of their sockets when he saw the six War Goddesses.

War Goddesses!

Six of them!

Even the War God’s Temple’s main headquarters would probably have to send all of its War Goddesses to match this number.

“Old Blade! Kill him quickly!”

While everyone was in a daze, Moving Mountain suddenly shouted at Mad Blade, his powerful voice coming from his four-meter-tall body echoing throughout the entire basin.

Hearing this, Mad Blade instantly snapped out of his daze and used Storm Realm, his Legendary Greatsword’s Additional Skill, at Shi Feng.

War Goddesses were existences rivaling Dragons. Moreover, as they were NPCs, they could not only coordinate their movements with each other, but they could do it better than even players.

If six Tier 4 War Goddesses worked together, they could possibly slay even a Tier 5 Dragon.

Immediately, with Mad Blade as the center, space-shredding wind blades spread to the surroundings, covering a 1,000-yard radius.

“Too late!”

When Shi Feng saw Mad Blade using a Large-scale Destruction Spell, he promptly had the War Goddesses take action.

Subsequently, the six Level 150, Tier 4 War Goddesses could be seen attacking Mad Blade simultaneously. However, none of them attacked him with their weapons. Instead, they created numerous divine runes around Mad Blade, suppressing him and preventing any of his mana from spreading.

Tier 4 Medium-scale Combination Super Spell, Sacred Seal!

In the eyes of most players, War Goddesses were only NPCs who had mastered the art of combat to the extreme. Few people knew that War Goddesses were in possession of numerous Super Spells, especially Combination Super Spells.

War Goddesses could cast Small-scale Combination Super Spells if there were three of them working together, medium-scale if there were six, large-scale if there were nine, and super-large-scale if there were twelve.

This was why the Goddess of Space could go against Primordial Gods with the help of twelve War Goddesses.

Although Shi Feng could only summon Tier 4 War Goddesses right now, a Tier 4 Medium-scale Combination Super Spell’s might was already close to matching that of Tier 6 Curses.

Boom!

A deafening explosion echoed throughout the basin, stupefying everyone present.

He’s gone? Is this the power of War Goddesses? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When Unrestrained Lionheart saw that the place where Mad Blade originally stood had transformed into an empty void, an indescribable sense of shock filled him.

Although Unrestrained Lionheart knew that War Goddesses were terrifying foes to face, the ones Shi Feng summoned were only at Tier 4. In his opinion, even if six Tier 4 War Goddesses worked together, they would be fortunate if they could even pin down Mad Blade.

It should be known that Mad Blade was a Saint who had been active for over a century already. Now that he had risen to Tier 5, with the help of his Legendary Weapon, the average Tier 6 expert would be helpless against him. They might even get killed if they weren’t careful.

Yet, now, Mad Blade had failed to survive even one move against the six Tier 4 War Goddesses…

Incredible! Guild Leader Black Flame is simply incredible!?When Cross saw Mad Blade getting obliterated, his eyes glowed with uncontrolled excitement.

At least we’re safe now,?Thousand Scars thought in excitement and relief when she saw the six War Goddesses instantly eliminate Mad Blade.

Mad Blade was one of the strongest players present. If even Mad Blade couldn’t survive one move against the six War Goddesses, it should be simple for their team to break out of this encirclement. After all, even if all of the other rabbles worked together, the threat they posed to their team wouldn’t be comparable to the threat Mad Blade posed.

Meanwhile, following Mad Blade’s death, ugly expressions appeared on the players belonging to the two human alliances. It was especially so for the Red Dragon Nation members on Moro’s side.

“What should we do now, Lord Moro?” Desert Web quietly asked as he looked at Moro. “The combination attack of those six War Goddesses rival Tier 6 Curses. If Vice Guild Leader Frey’s team focuses solely on escaping, Moving Mountain and the others won’t be able to stop them…”

Frey herself possessed astonishing strength. Even if numerous ordinary fifth-floor experts worked together, they would have difficulty keeping her pinned. Only veteran Saints like Mad Blade and Moving Mountain could pin and kill her. This was also why the two human alliances had chosen the two veteran Saints to represent them.

Now that Mad Blade had gotten killed, if Shi Feng had his six War Goddesses keep Moving Mountain distracted, Frey could easily use one of her trump cards to escape.

“Nothing. We keep on waiting,” Moro said with a faint smile. Then, looking at Shi Feng’s distant figure, he continued, “It seems Black Flame is indeed capable. It’s no wonder Frey is willing to pay an exorbitant price to hire him. It’s a pity that Mad Blade and Moving Mountain aren’t the only players present capable of killing Tier 6 experts.”

“The Holy Race’s experts?” When Desert Web heard Moro’s words, he turned to look at the Holy Race players who had been calmly watching from the side throughout this entire time.

The strength of Holy Race players was apparent to all in the Eternal Realm. At the same tier, most human players were not a match for Holy Race players. In the case of Holy Race experts capable of using Holy Aura, even titled experts would have to work in pairs just to take on one such expert. Moreover, these were only the most common Holy Race experts they were talking about.

Among Holy Race experts, the truly powerful ones were capable of using their Holy Aura to execute Holy Arts.

According to the information human players have obtained thus far, Holy Arts could be categorized into three ranks. Similar to combat techniques, the ranks were Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Even experts capable of using Bronze Holy Arts could already rival the average Saint-ranked expert.

As far as Moro knew, out of the Holy Race players present, over thirty could use Bronze Holy Arts, and five could use Silver Holy Arts. Of the latter group, the leaders of the two Holy Race powers could even use Advanced Silver Holy Arts.

Meanwhile, after silence enveloped the battlefield for a short moment, the two Holy Race powers’ members suddenly stormed forward and surrounded Frey’s team.

“Bate! What are you trying to do?!” Moving Mountain shouted as he looked at the leader of one of the Holy Race powers. “Don’t forget our agreement!”

“You still dare bring up our agreement after this embarrassing display?” the man named Bate said disdainfully. “If not for your ability to seal space, do you honestly think we need to partner with you aliens? Since you have already proven yourself incapable of keeping them here, it is our turn to act. You just need to keep locking down this space. If you can’t do that much, don’t even think of getting any of the loot!”

After saying so, Bate gestured for his subordinates to attack.

Subsequently, Bate and more than 50 other Holy Race experts charged Frey’s team together. Every one of these Holy Race experts was at Tier 5. When clad in their Holy Auras, their presence was no weaker than that of Tier 5 Saints. Moreover, four among them had presences no weaker than Mad Blade.

Frey couldn’t help but gasp when she saw this scene.

A force of 50-plus Tier 5 Saints and four experts on Mad Blade’s caliber was something even the Red Dragon Nation would have difficulty fielding.
