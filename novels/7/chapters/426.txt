Chapter 427 - Raiding the Flame Guards

“There’s a way to deal with them?”

Although she did not voice it, Aqua Rose doubted her Guild Leader’s declaration when she saw his confident smile.

With Shi Feng’s frightening damage and support, it would be a breeze to deal with an ordinary Lord ranked monster. Aqua Rose had also witnessed this before personally.

However, the Level 28 Flame Guards were somewhat different. Due to White Fog Canyon’s unique environment, they were constantly in a berserk state. Their Attack Power and Attack Speed were far superior to Lord ranked monsters of the same level elsewhere. Their combat power could rival High Lords of the same level outside the canyon.

If they only had to kill one Flame Guard, they had a chance. However, there was a total of sixteen Flame Guards waiting outside the entrance. In other words, they had to face sixteen High Lords simultaneously. On average, they could only send 31 players to deal with each Level 28 High Lord.

In God’s Domain, an ordinary High Lord in the fields required a team of over a hundred players to defeat. If it were a powerful High Lord, then a team of over 500 players might be necessary. Furthermore, the Flame Guards outside the cave possessed a Flame Domain that covered a radius of 50 yards; players who entered the Flame Domain would lose 400 HP every three seconds. Even with the healers going all-out, it was impossible to keep everyone’s HP from plummeting.

If a team did not have high Fire Resistance, they would not survive in the Flame Domain.

Aqua Rose really could not think of any solutions to their predicament.

Without hesitation, Shi Feng ventured roughly 30 yards from the cave entrance. He then wandered around, adjusting his position. However, the Flame Guards standing outside the entrance had long since discovered Shi Feng. They all had squeezed against the cave opening, attempting to charge in and tear Shi Feng apart. Fortunately, the hole was just too narrow, and none of the Flame Guards could fit through.

Although these Flame Guards were unable to enter, the Lords were no fools. Immediately, they materialized Flame Spears and threw them at Shi Feng.

The scorching spears released a blazing white glow, causing even the air to tremble.

Xiu... Xiu... Xiu...

A series of six Flame Spears flew in from the cave entrance, heading straight for Shi Feng. The spears were so fast that their flight sounded like explosions. The ground that the spears passed over also erupted in flames.

However, although the Flame Spears were fast, Shi Feng wasn’t slow, either.

As the Flame Spears entered the cave, Shi Feng moved. By the time the spears arrived at Shi Feng’s position, the man had long since moved two yards away. As a result, all six Flame Spears struck empty air.

“This spot should be good.”

Shi Feng ignored the Flame Guards’ attacks. He focused on calculating the Lords’ attack range and angle, leisurely appearing as if the Flame Guards had never attacked him...

“Guild Leader’s dodge is so fast. He even avoided those supersonic attacks. If it were me, I would have no choice but to endure the attacks,” Cola sighed with admiration as he watched Shi Feng effortlessly dodge the Flame Guards’ spears. “It would be awesome if I had just half of Guild Leader’s dodging speed.”

If he had such a dodging speed, he might even become the number one tank in Star-Moon Kingdom or at least in the top ten.

“Cola, you have many things you need to learn, then,” Fire Dance chuckled. “Guild Leader didn’t just rely on his speed when he dodged the Flame Spears, but many other techniques such as his insight and judgment. Even if Guild Leader was just as fast as you are, he could still dodge those attacks easily.

“Linear attacks are monotonous. As long as one possesses sufficient insight, they can counter them easily. However, the Flame Guards’ attacks are too fast, and we are definitely not fast enough. Hence, we will also need to rely on accurate judgment to defend ourselves. The moment the Flame Guards launch their attacks, we need to make the most appropriate decision immediately and use the smallest of movements to achieve the best results.

“But that is still not enough. Look at Guild Leader’s position. As a precaution, he is standing precisely 40 yards away from the Flame Guards, a player’s maximum range. With this distance, even if the Flame Spears were 20 times faster than our Guild Leader, the spears would still have to cover a distance of 40 yards to reach him. As they do, Guild Leader has enough time to move two yards away. However, one must also have an accurate grasp of the Flame Guards’ attack timing. If one dodges too early, the Flame Spears will hit them.”

Although it looked like a simple dodging maneuver, it turned out that there were so many other techniques involved.

“The top seven ranged damage dealers come to my position and give it a try; see if you can dodge the Flame Spears. Healers, focus on healing them. Guardian Knights, activate your Fire Resistance Auras and give the seven of them Protection Blessings. Don’t let them die,” Shi Feng said in the team chat after confirming the positions.

The Flame Domain of the Flame Guards was indeed a powerful team-wipe skill. However, they were not without a fighting chance.

Shi Feng had already experimented with the cave’s size and distance. With a distance of 40 yards, they could fit eight players with each having three to four yards to dodge, allowing them to attack Flame Guards outside the entrance.

The Flame Guard was a Lord ranked monster that focused mainly on melee attacks, so its ranged attacks were limited and simple; it was certainly possible to avoid them. However, such a feat had a high requirement of a player’s insight and judgment. As for speed, even if the Fire Spears were faster, they were not 20 times faster than Zero Wing’s core members. This was even the case for the magical classes.

Shi Feng had even purposefully slowed down when dodging the Flame Spears. Yet, he still dodged the attacks effortlessly. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Also, as the effects of the Flame Domain did not stack, with the protection of the Fire Resistance Aura, each of the seven ranged players would only lose 300 HP every three seconds. There were over 60 healers in the team, more than enough to keep the seven of them alive. The healers could also take turns healing. They could afford to fight a battle of attrition.

Following which, the top seven ranged damage dealers took turns attempting to dodge the spears. The seven included Aqua Rose, Blackie, one of the Five Demon Generals, the Ice Queen Su Qianliu, another Five Demon General, the Ranger Minor Wind, Violet Cloud, and two others. Although they struggled in the beginning, none of these seven were ordinary players; they were all experts of Zero Wing. They quickly adapted to the Flame Guards’ attacks, and soon, they could dodge the attacks effortlessly.

After finishing with his experiments, Shi Feng reformed the team once again. After repeating the process, they started raiding the Level 28 Flame Guards.

The moment the battle began, ice spells and arrows flew across the cave and bombarded one of the Flame Guards outside the entrance. However, the Flame Guard’s magma armor possessed a frightening Defense, and a majority of the teams attacks only dealt around -300 damage. Among them, Aqua Rose managed to deal over -500 damage, whereas Blackie dealt over -600 damage with his Dark Arrow.

As for Violet Cloud, although she had already become an Astromancer, her instantaneous explosive power was still less than Aqua Rose’s, a Tier 1 Elementalist, and Blackie’s, who possessed an Epic staff and was a Tier 1 Cursemancer. However, even though she only dealt slightly more than -400 damage, it was still impressive.

The Flame Guard they struck bellowed with rage, growing more violent as it threw Flame Spears madly. Fortunately, they evaded each attack.

The Flame Guard was different from the Bosses in Dungeons. It only possessed 700,000 HP, and its battle recovery only replenished 7,000 HP every five seconds. The total damage dealt by the seven players far surpassed that, and they could gradually exhaust it to death.

At this moment, standing in the furthest corner, Shi Feng tossed the Blazing Meteor, striking the Flame Guard. Suddenly, a damage of over -1,000 points appeared above the Flame Guard’s head. Immediately, the Blazing Meteor’s Quadruple Phantom effect triggered, causing four consecutive damages of over -200 points. In an instant, Shi Feng became the highest damage dealer among the eight attackers.

Everyone was stupefied.

Shi Feng was a Swordsman, not a ranged class. Yet, his damage thoroughly overshadowed that of an Elementalist, a class known as a glass cannon. Moreover, this Elementalist was Aqua Rose.

If Shi Feng were not their Guild Leader, every team member would have cursed at him. How were ranged players like them even supposed to make a living now?!

“Guild Leader, you’re shameless! Speak! What did you eat? Why is your damage so much higher than ours?”

Aqua Rose was speechless upon seeing the damages above the Flame Guard’s head. Originally, she had intended to surpass Shi Feng in terms of damage output, satisfying her own little vanity. Now, however, even that dream had shattered...
