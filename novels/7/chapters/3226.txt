Chapter 301 – Hundred Refinement Building

Gazing Moon City, western district, outer zone:

Unlike the shops in the city center, the ones in the western district’s outer zone were dilapidated. Even so, many independent players chose to sell their items here because of the cheap rental fee. This situation made it so that the shops here stocked more items than the high-class shops in the city center.

On the overcrowded streets here, one could find even Tier 5 players hawking their items, the sight attracting many Tier 3 and Tier 4 players’ attention.

“Freshly made Tier 4 Defensive Magic Scroll Flame Barrier for 100 Gold Mana Coins! With it, you can block at least three attacks from a Tier 5 Legendary monster! Two more if it’s a fire-type attack! Only one left in stock! First come, first served!” a Level 165, Tier 5 Berserker yelled loudly while waving around a light-red ancient scroll.

“Aren’t you asking for too much? The shop ahead is selling Tier 4 Defensive Magic Scrolls for only 90 Gold Mana Coins. Both can stop the attacks of Legendary monsters, so why shouldn’t I buy that shop’s scroll instead?” a Level 153, Tier 4 middle-aged Guardian Knight said, shaking his head.

“Indeed. That’s a huge difference of 10 Gold Mana Coins. That’s about as much as I make in a month,” a Level 158, Tier 3 young Elementalist said, nodding in agreement.

“Don’t be so quick to decide!” the Level 165, Tier 5 Berserker calmly responded. Then, wearing a smile, he explained, “My Flame Barrier is a Tier 4 Peak Spell. Even if you don’t end up using the scroll, you can use it to research how fire-type mana operates. It can be of great help to you when you are looking to get promoted to Tier 4 or develop your Mana Body. It’s much better than Tier 4 Basic and Advanced Spells. If you get promoted to Tier 4 or progress in your Mana Body development thanks to it, wouldn’t you be able to earn back those ten coins easily?”

As soon as the Tier 5 Berserker finished speaking, many Level 150-plus, Tier 4 players began competing over the Defensive Magic Scroll. In the blink of an eye, a small auction had begun.

When Wu Xiaoxiao saw this scene from a distance, mixed feelings filled her heart.

She had already gotten used to seeing such scenes shortly after arriving in the Greater God’s Domain. Even so, she would always experience a moment of melancholy whenever she saw such scenes.

Reaching Tier 5 used to be her dream.

......

Back on the main continent in her homeworld, it was unthinkable for a Tier 5 expert to hawk wares out on the street. Any player who could reach Tier 5 would be a big shot in God’s Domain. Tier 5 players couldn’t even be bothered to hold conversations with Tier 4 players normally, let alone hawk wares to them.

However, unlike her homeworld, Tier 5 players were far too common in the Greater God’s Domain.

Only Tier 5 experts who had created a powerful Mana Body could be considered a person of significance. If a player reached Tier 5 by creating a Mana Body that only met the minimum requirements, their standing in society wouldn’t be any better than Tier 4 players. In fact, in the various powers’ eyes, such a Tier 5 player would be inferior to a Tier 4 player who had completed their Tier 4 promotion using a Tier 4 Peak Legacy Skill as their Mana Body’s core.

“What are we here for, Brother Black Flame? Don’t tell me you plan on settling here?” Midsummer curiously asked as she looked at Shi Feng, who was leisurely leading the way.

It was true that the western district’s outer zone possessed the cheapest shops and houses for sale in Gazing Moon City. However, there wasn’t much hope for development in this place.

Firstly, players from other cities would typically choose to do their shopping in the city center. Secondly, the security in the city center was much better than in the city’s outer zone.

The outer zone’s patrol squads were generally made up of Level 180, Tier 4 NPC soldiers only. However, the city center’s patrol squads were led by Level 180, Tier 5 NPCs. Even Tier 5 players would have to think twice when trying to make a move in the city center.

Now that Shi Feng had well over 10,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, he was more than capable of affording a shop or house in the city center.

“We are indeed going to settle here,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to withhold this information. He could also guess what was going through Midsummer’s mind, so he chuckled and continued, “This place is going to have incredibly great potential in the future.”

During his previous life, two major events occurred in the Ancient River Kingdom.

The first event was naturally the discovery of the Hundred Refinement Building, a Hidden Construction that sent tremors across the entire Starlight Realm. The second event was the invasion of the Magus Kingdom. The entirety of the Ancient River Kingdom’s northern region eventually fell to the Magus Kingdom. As a result, many players from the northern region flocked to the other parts of the Ancient River Kingdom. Among them, Gazing Moon City became the first choice for many independent players and powers.

Because of this event, Gazing Moon City’s player population skyrocketed to 500 million, becoming the second largest city in the Ancient River Kingdom.

Now that the various powers had already monopolized the shops in Gazing Moon City’s city center, the most Shi Feng could do was rent the shops and lands there. He could never truly own them.

However, it was a different story for the shops and lands in Gazing Moon City’s outer zone. Even though the city’s player population had already exceeded 200 million, there were still plenty of unoccupied shops and lands in the outer zone.

Once the magus Kingdom invaded and players flocked to Gazing Moon City, the value of the outer zone’s shops and lands would also rise. At that time, their value would more than double. Moreover, that was before the Hundred Refinement Building was discovered. After the Hidden Construction was discovered, the value of the outer zone’s shops and lands wouldn’t be inferior to the city center’s shops and lands in the slightest. Only, Shi Feng wouldn’t mention these things to Midsummer.

After the trio continued walking for a short moment, they arrived in front of a dilapidated, two-story building.

This two-story building was situated in the mid-mountainside. Most of the buildings in the mid-mountainside were two or three floors high, so this two-story house was relatively inconspicuous. Moreover, the area it occupied was smaller than a basketball court. So, even though this building operated as a Battle Arena, nobody was willing to visit it.

When Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao saw this two-story Battle Arena, their first thought was to turn around and leave. However, when they saw Shi Feng walking into the building with a somewhat excited look on his face, they had no choice but to follow him.

Meanwhile, this two-story Battle Arena was none other than the Hundred Refinement Building.

When Shi Feng entered the small Battle Arena, his eyes quickly shifted toward the old man sitting behind the front desk.

“Are you perhaps looking to rent a combat room, dear customer?” the old man, who was a Level 180, Tier 4 Great Wizard, asked with an expectant gaze. “Our combat rooms are very cheap. It will only cost you three Silver Mana Coins per hour.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao heard the price mentioned by the old Great Wizard, a frown immediately formed on their faces.

Although three Silver Mana Coins weren’t enough to rent an advanced combat room in the city center’s Battle Arenas, it was enough to rent ordinary combat rooms.

Compared to the large Battle Arenas in the city center, this shabby Battle Arena only had a total of four combat rooms on the first floor. Moreover, by the looks of things, each combat room should only be one-fifth the size of a standard combat room. The old man’s asking price of three Silver Mana Coins was no different than daylight robbery. It was no wonder nobody was willing to visit this establishment.

“No, I don’t plan on renting any combat rooms,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. Then, he smiled and continued, “May I know if this Battle Arena is for sale?”

For sale??Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in surprise.

With how small and shabby this Battle Arena looked, nobody would be willing to visit it, even if it offered to rent its combat rooms for free.

It should be known that dozens of Battle Arenas were located at the foot of the mountain. Moreover, even the smallest was a medium-sized Battle Arena with advanced combat rooms that could allow even Tier 5 players to fight to their hearts’ desire.

Meanwhile, after the old Great Wizard scrutinized Shi Feng for a moment, he hesitantly said, “It is for sale, but this Battle Arena is an old shop with a history of several centuries. I won’t sell it for anything less than 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.”

“Eleven thousand units?!” Midsummer instantly grew furious. “You might as well be robbing us!”

With 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, they could already buy two or three shops in the city center so long as they could find a willing seller. The money they could earn from renting these three shops would be enough for an ordinary Tier 5 expert to live leisurely for the rest of their life.

Moreover, 11,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal were all of the Seven Luminaries Crystals they had in their possession.

The old man before them was obviously pricing his shop based on their pockets!

Wasn’t it supposed to be 10,000 units?

A hint of surprise and confusion flashed in Shi Feng’s eyes as he looked at the old man before him.
