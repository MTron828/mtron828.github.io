Chapter 914 – Black Flame’s Influence

The lobby fell silent at Frey’s words as every guest present looked at the inconspicuous young man.

“What’s going on? Why is Miss Frey taking the initiative to greet that person?”

“Crap! Who is that guy? Miss Frey normally doesn’t even care to greet the heads of the pseudo-apex powers based in Galaxy City. Could that guy be an apex power’s chosen one?”

“Black Flame… I’ve heard of this name before. He made quite the name for himself in the Eternal Realm. He also recently debuted on the Divine Glory List as a top 300 expert.”

“What? That can’t be right. How can a top 300 expert on the Divine Glory List receive such treatment? I heard that Miss Frey didn’t even pay respect to the Skylight Association’s Nineteenth Sword, one of the current Ten Great Sword Gods.”

The guests present were executives of either conglomerates or top-tier upper-ranking hegemonic powers. They more or less knew about Frey’s circumstances, so they were greatly confused by her attitude toward Shi Feng. They now eyed Shi Feng as if looking at a monster.

Xia Qingying was also dumbfounded by this situation. She hadn’t thought that Shi Feng had been telling the truth when he said his invitation came from Frey.

After all, Frey’s current status had risen so much that even the Guild Leaders of pseudo-apex powers had to treat her with respect. She was already a popular figure in the Greater God’s Domain. When it came to influence, she stood among the top of the Greater God’s Domain. Hence, Xia Qingying couldn’t imagine how Shi Feng, who only entered the Greater World recently, could have dealings with Frey. Furthermore, judging by Frey’s tone, their relationship was not shallow.

So, he’s the Guild Leader of that Zero Wing? At Frey’s words, Lunar River looked at Shi Feng, intrigued.

“Miss Frey, do you know each other?” Crocodile Fang was stunned to see Frey greeting Shi Feng so affectionately.

Crocodile Fang visited Desolate Star City this time with two goals. He wanted to negotiate an alliance with King’s Paradise on Angel’s Retribution’s behalf and get acquainted with Frey, a popular figure in the current Greater God’s Domain.

Before the Eternal Realm’s appearance, the Red Dragon Nation was a mediocre pseudo-apex power and would never have garnered the attention of Angel’s Retribution. However, after the Eternal Realm appeared, Frey led the Red Dragon Nation’s forces to swiftly occupy a major city and expand the Guild’s operations. This brought the Red Dragon Nation abundant funds and resources. The many secret treasures the Red Dragon Nation obtained also enabled it to produce many experts, significantly increasing the Guild’s overall strength.

Now, the Red Dragon Nation already rivaled the Greater God’s Domain’s Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. Moreover, its foundations in the Eternal Realm were vastly superior to what many of them had.

For pseudo-apex powers looking to expand into the Eternal Realm, it would be in their best interests to join forces with the Red Dragon Nation. With the Red Dragon Nation’s assistance, they could establish themselves more quickly in the Eternal Realm. This point could be seen simply by looking at the attitude of King’s Paradise’s Lunar River toward Frey.

“That’s right. Are you Crocodile Fang, the representative of Angel’s Retribution that River mentioned?” Frey asked as she turned to Crocodile Fang.

“That is me.” Crocodile Fang nodded, not daring to put on airs.

“River mentioned that you had a conflict with someone at the auction venue,” Frey stated, narrowing her eyes. Then, she pointed at Shi Feng and questioned Crocodile Fang coldly, “You couldn’t have caused trouble for my guest, Guild Leader Black Flame, right?”

“This is a misunderstanding! It’s all a misunderstanding, Miss Frey!” When Crocodile Fang saw Frey’s dissatisfied look, he knew that he had provoked someone he shouldn’t have provoked. “I was only trying to invite Guild Leader Black Flame for a chat on my friend’s behalf. I had no other intentions. I am willing to apologize if I offended Miss Frey’s guest.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Crocodile Fang’s words stunned the surrounding guests. Even Xia Qingying and Endless Scars hadn’t expected the arrogant Crocodile Fang to react so flexibly.

“Misunderstanding? How can you call this a misunderstanding?! You were the one trying to snatch our room first! Not only that, but you even wanted to have Big Sis Xia apologize to that guy over there!” Drifting Bean retorted in dissatisfaction as she pointed at Xiao Quan. “Now, you say that this was all a misunderstanding?”

“Little girl, I already said I would apologize. What more do you want?” Crocodile Fang said, smiling at Drifting Bean nonchalantly. “Or do you want Miss Frey to make an enemy out of Angel’s Retribution before you are satisfied?”

Drifting Bean gnashed her teeth at Crocodile Fang’s words. However, she dared not say anything more.

Crocodile Fang had essentially just employed a feigned retreat. He knew he couldn’t afford to offend Frey, so he took the initiative to apologize. By doing so, he could show his respect to Frey while minimizing the humiliation he had to suffer. If Xia Qingying’s group continued to pursue the matter, they would become the inconsiderate guests in this situation.

Moreover, it was as Crocodile Fang said. Shi Feng was only a guest invited by Frey. Would Frey be willing to burn her bridges with Angel’s Retribution for Shi Feng? It should be known that Angel’s Retribution was the Angel Sanctuary’s number one power. It could rival the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers, similar to the current Red Dragon Nation.

“What do you think, River?” Frey suddenly asked Lunar River, acting like she had not heard what Crocodile Fang and Drifting Bean had just said.

However, Frey’s words elated Crocodile Fang.

It was obvious that Frey did not wish to offend Angel’s Retribution too terribly. Hence, she sought Lunar River’s opinion. And if King’s Paradise still wanted to ally with Angel’s Retribution, the result of asking Lunar River was self-evident.

“You are one of Desolate Star City’s highest authorities. Since this issue happened in Desolate Star City, you naturally have the final say,” Lunar River said, chuckling. Her behavior made it seem like she had already given her answer.

In the end, it’s still all about profits! Drifting Bean felt aggrieved when she heard the exchange between Frey and Lunar River.

“That person is ultimately Angel’s Retribution’s representative. This is already the ideal outcome for us,” Xia Qingying said, consoling the bitter girl beside her. “We can’t make things difficult for Miss Frey.”

Stronger! I must become stronger! Drifting Bean inwardly vowed. She decided that she must develop the Blood Wing adventurer team into a power that even Angel’s Retribution feared. At that time, she would be able to give Crocodile Fang a piece of her mind in a similar situation.

However, before Xia Qingying and Drifting Bean could react, a cold voice suddenly entered their ears and echoed in their minds.

“In that case, get lost! Desolate Star City doesn’t welcome you!” Frey shouted at Crocodile Fang and Xiao Quan, her voice sonorous and powerful. It sounded like a pronouncement of fate, and it made everyone in the lobby stare at her in disbelief.
