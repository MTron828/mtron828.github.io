Chapter 913 – Suffocation

Desolate Star City, Auction Venue: Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As time passed, more and more guests gathered in the auction venue’s lobby because of the commotion Crocodile Fang caused. Many of these guests looked at Shi Feng’s group sympathetically.

Angel’s Retribution was the Angel Sanctuary’s number one power. No matter how extraordinary the power backing Desolate Star City was, even it would likely have to defer to Angel’s Retribution. It was especially so when this situation involved Crocodile Fang.

Crocodile Fang was a famous bully in the Angel Sanctuary. He was the pampered son of Golden Leo, Angel’s Retribution’s Guild Leader, who had an absolute say over the Guild. Because of this, he could go about his bullying fearlessly and only had to be wary of the executives of apex powers.

“Miss Shuoyun, are you done with your call? What did Miss River say?” Crocodile Fang asked tentatively when he saw Shuoyun had ended her call.

While Crocodile Fang might be a prodigal and a tyrant, he wasn’t a fool. If he were to take action in King’s Paradise’s territory, even if King’s Paradise’s Lunar River chose not to say anything about it, she would be dissatisfied with him. Who knew what she would do to him in the future? He wasn’t strong enough to ignore King’s Paradise’s retaliation, either.

Thus, he needed to know Lunar River’s stance.

If Lunar River decided not to care about this matter, he could deal with Xia Qingying’s group at will. If she reacted negatively to his intentions, he would have to tone down his actions as a show of respect to King’s Paradise. If she expressed anger toward his intentions and had him get lost, he would have no choice but to give up on his persecution of Xia Qingying’s group today and find an opportunity some other day. After all, he’d be provoking King’s Paradise if he continued to take action after Lunar River’s warning.

While King’s Paradise might have chosen to operate behind the scenes in God’s Domain after failing in its challenge to become an apex power over half a century ago, it still wasn’t an opponent that Angel’s Retribution could afford to provoke casually.

Crocodile Fang had to be especially wary of Lunar River, who had inherited the position of King’s Paradise’s First Vice Guild Leader at a young age.

Yes, inherited!

Unlike others, Lunar River did not have to compete for her position in the Guild. This was because of her monstrous talent. She was the most talented player to have appeared in the Angel Sanctuary in the past few centuries, and she was practically certain to become King’s Paradise’s Guild Leader in the future.

At the age of 16, Lunar River had secretly debuted on the Divine Glory List under a pseudonym and achieved third place. Although her name suddenly stopped appearing on the list later on, Angel’s Retribution had kept track of her actions throughout the past decade or so.

Lunar River’s most recent public appearance was four years ago. Back then, she had already reached Level 240 and had killed the Giant Sanctuary’s number-one player in ten moves, along with the 100 Level 230-plus fifth-floor experts accompanying him. The event terrified the Giant Sanctuary’s powers; for some time, none dared to let their top experts leave the safety of their Holy Cities.

Four years had passed since then. Now, Crocodile Fang dared not imagine how terrifying Lunar River had become. The Angel Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers even guessed she might have achieved that standard already. Otherwise, King’s Paradise wouldn’t have made such a high-profile comeback.

“She said that she would be here soon,” Shuoyun answered. “Before she arrives, you are not allowed to do anything or leave!”

“She will come in person?” Crocodile Fang sighed in relief at this answer. “Okay, I’ll wait for her here.”

The news of Lunar River’s decision to make a personal appearance was neither good nor bad. It showed that she was upset about the situation, but not so much that she was willing to offend Angel’s Retribution. So long as he didn’t go too far in persecuting Xia Qingying’s group, Lunar River shouldn’t have any problems.

After saying so, Crocodile River returned to Xiao Quan and patted the other party on the shoulder.

“Brother Xiao, I promise to get revenge for you. I will have that pretty lady accompany you for a drink and apologize,” Crocodile Fang said confidently.

“I’ll look forward to it, Brother Fang,” Xiao Quan said joyfully. Originally, he had already given up getting revenge on Xia Qingying and Shi Feng after his superior instructed him to let go of this matter. He never expected fate to play in his favor.

“They want us to apologize?!” Drifting Bean exploded when she overheard Crocodile Fang and Xiao Quan’s conversation. “We were here first! Yet, not only do they want to take our room, but they also want us to apologize?! They must be dreaming! I refuse to believe Desolate Star City will turn a blind eye to this!”

The surrounding spectators nodded in agreement. Inwardly, though, none of them were optimistic about the situation.

The various powers revolved around interests. Without sufficient benefits, there was no way Desolate Star City would casually offend a behemoth like Angel’s Retribution.

“How about I reveal my Internal Elder status?” Endless Scars suggested. “With the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s influence, Crocodile Fang should tone down his actions.”

“Absolutely not!” Xia Qingying vetoed. “Your identity must be kept secret for your safety in the real world! You are our world’s greatest hope for achieving success! Nothing can happen to you!”

Very few people knew about Endless Scars’s identity as one of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce’s Internal Elders. Only those extremely trustworthy were let in on the secret.

This secrecy was to ensure Endless Scars’s safety in the real world. Internal competition within the Eternal Chamber of Commerce was extremely fierce and cruel. While revealing her status in Eternal might keep her safe from the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers, it would expose her to the dangers within the apex power. So long as her competitors learned of her identity, they would have plenty of methods to eliminate her.

“In that case, we can take shelter in the God’s Domain Association if the situation looks bad,” Endless Scars said after some thought. “With my mental strength standard, so long as Desolate Star City doesn’t take any direct action, nobody can stop us.”

The God’s Domain Association had a branch in every mobile city. It was also an existence that no power dared disobey. So long as they entered the God’s Domain Association, not even apex powers would dare touch them. They should also have no trouble leaving Desolate Star City. If Endless Scars had the Chamber of Commerce send a team of bodyguards to escort them, Angel’s Retribution wouldn’t dare continue standing in their way.

“I guess that’s our only option if things don’t go well,” Xia Qingying said, nodding.

Although Xia Qingying had heard from Shi Feng that his gold invitation came from Frey, she still didn’t feel safe. After all, Frey was the Galaxy Conglomerate’s Fourth Princess and a Vice Guild Leader of the Red Dragon Nation, a pseudo-apex power. She was also a popular figure in the current Eternal Realm. Why would such a big shot send Shi Feng an invitation to Desolate Star City? It was a gold invitation, no less. The two stood on parallel lines, and it was only due to luck that they had crossed paths before.

Suddenly, a commotion appeared outside the auction venue. Many of the guests in the lobby rushed to the entrance. It was obvious that Desolate Star City’s representative had arrived.

“Since Miss River has arrived, you bunch should start considering what to do! Otherwise, I will have my people decide for you!” Crocodile Fang sneered at Xia Qingying’s group when he saw the approaching crowd.

As Crocodile Fang finished speaking, a large group of people entered the lobby, led by two young women. The two women were none other than King’s Paradise’s Vice Guild Leader Lunar River and the Red Dragon Nation’s Vice Guild Leader Frey.

“Big Sis River, you’re here!” As soon as Crocodile Fang saw Lunar River, he immediately greeted her as if he were greeting a relative. He grew even more elated when he saw the woman beside Lunar River. He hadn’t expected to be able to attract the attention of a big shot like Frey. “Greetings, Miss Frey! I am Angel’s Retribution’s Crocodile Fang! It is an honor to meet you!”

While Crocodile Fang was introducing himself, the bored Frey suddenly noticed a young man standing a short distance behind Crocodile Fang. A smile immediately blossomed on her face, and she approached the other party without hesitation.

“Guild Leader Black Flame! You actually showed up!”
