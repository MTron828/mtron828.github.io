Chapter 370 - Legacy Stone Sword

Starstreak Trading Firm, third-floor meeting room. At this moment, all of the core members of Zero Wing had gathered here.

Compared to other Guilds, Zero Wing was more fortunate as it had a meeting place exclusively for its own members. Normally, other Guilds would have to use the temporary rooms available at the Adventurer’s Association. However, those temporary rooms could only hold a limited number of people at a time. Other than the Adventurer’s Association, Guilds could also pay a large sum to rent conference rooms at hotels or bars. However, only wealthy and powerful Guilds could afford such rentals.

“Guild Leader, we have completed all of the necessary preparations for tomorrow’s recruitment. We can start as soon as the Guild Residence’s construction has completed. In addition, here is the detailed list of tomorrow’s tasks. Everyone can take a look at what they need to do tomorrow,” Aqua Rose presented a list of tasks on the meeting table’s system screen and explained them one by one.

Aqua Rose had long since prepared for Zero Wing’s recruitment. However, when she considered the large number of players coming from other cities as well, she had to revise her plan. Moreover, she had also made detailed adjustments to the Guild’s benefit system. Now, they would not have to fear the sudden influx of members overloading Zero Wing’s capacity and harming the Guild’s development.

Aqua Rose’s list shocked everyone present.

The information Aqua Rose had compiled so impressively organized. They felt as if they were reading a university textbook. The section relating to Zero Wing’s benefit system consisted of over a dozen pages. Moreover, Aqua Rose had carefully planned how they were going to counter the spies sent by other Guilds. To access more information about the Guild and its benefit system, members would need to be promoted to a higher rank within the Guild.

However, the lowest-ranking members could still view the benefits that Zero Wing offered, and they were enough to impress many players.

“What? There are actually 150 private rooms available for rent in the Guild Residence? I thought there were only going to be seven or eight rooms available.”

“That’s only what is available for the normal members. Look at the benefits for elite members. They can actually rent 2-star private rooms. Moreover, there are a total of fifty 2-star private rooms available. Just how huge is our Guild Residence?”

Many of the core members present were shocked by the information revealed. Their curiosity about their Guild Residence grew.

“Look at their surprise. If they knew that our Guild Residence is White River City’s largest and most valuable residence, the Purple Sun Mansion, I wonder what kind of expressions they would make?” Blackie chuckled softly.

Although Zero Wing’s core membership had grown past a hundred, only a few actually knew where their Guild Residence was located.

After everyone had their assigned tasks, Aqua Rose suddenly stood. Clearing her throat, she said seriously, “The next thing we are going to talk about is classified information regarding Zero Wing. It is also what that everyone present is most concerned about today: the loot from the Mechanical Slayer. Other than the people here, no one is allowed access to this information.”

Everyone nodded nervously in reply to Aqua Rose’s words.

Every player who had been invited to this meeting today had a huge responsibility to the Guild.

The Mechanical Slayer was extraordinarily powerful. So, the items it dropped were also extraordinary. The importance of the role these items could play went without saying. Whether it was competing for a Dungeon’s First Clear or fighting in a Guild War, these items would definitely be of immense help a Guild’s development. If the information of these items went public, not only would their enemies have an edge against them, but it would also rouse the greed in others. At that time, their enemies would definitely plot to steal these items.

Looking at the anticipation in everyone’s eyes, Shi Feng slowly reported, “We have obtained a total of 102 items. Of them, there are 37 Fine-Gold items, 14 Dark-Gold items, 7 forging designs and recipes, 12 Tier 2 Magic Scrolls, 3 Tier 3 Magic Scrolls, 8 potions, 2 Epic items, and 19 rare materials.”

“What?! There are actually Epic items?!”

“Awesome! With Epic items, our Guild will flourish in Dungeons! We can claim all of the First Clears easily!”

Everyone grew incomparably excited after listening to Shi Feng’s report.

The large number of Fine-Gold and Dark-Gold items alone had greatly shocked the team. They could fully arm a 20-man team with so many items.

Just the thought of having a 20-man team fully geared in Fine-Gold and Dark-Gold ranked weapons and equipment was enough to give them the shivers. Not even first-rate Guilds could produce such a powerful team. Fully arming a team with Secret-Silver Equipment was already impressive. As for a 20-man team in Fine-Gold Equipment, that was simply impossible.

Meanwhile, if Zero Wing could establish such a powerful team, they would be invincible in 20-man Team Dungeons. The Dungeon Bosses would become pushovers. At that time, they could continuously supply the Guild with loads of precious equipment. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Most importantly, there were even two Epic items among the loot....

Previously, Epic items only existed in their thoughts and dreams. After all, since the launch of God’s Domain, there had yet to be any mention of anyone obtaining an Epic item. Now, their Guild actually had two Epic items! Everyone’s breath began to grow heavy at this revelation.

“Don’t get too excited. Although we obtained quite a few weapons and equipment, the lowest level requirement is 30. The same goes for the two Epic items.” Shi Feng smiled in response to their enthusiasm. He could understand how his team felt at the moment.

Epic items!

In God’s Domain, they were symbols of extraordinary strength.

In Shi Feng’s previous life, he, too, had been elated when he first saw an Epic item. After all, it was an item every player dreamed of having.

“I know that all of you are eager to see how powerful the Epic items are, so today, I’ll let all of you have a look at them. While we’re at it, I’ll let all of you know that I do not plan to allocate these two Epic items to anyone in particular. Instead, I’ll place both of them in the Guild Warehouse. However, only core members can see them. Once you have accumulated sufficient contribution points, you can trade your points for any of these two Epic items at any time,” Shi Feng explained. He then presented the information of the two items on the screen of the meeting table.

Of the two Epic items, the Song of Beatrice required 600,000 Guild Points, whereas Shadowcraft required 400,000 Guild Points.

One Guild Point was the current equivalent to around 30 Copper Coins. Even Aqua Rose and Fire Dance would require a relatively long time before they could accumulate so many points.

When everyone saw the Attributes on the two Epic items, they were all stupefied. The equipment they wore was simply too inferior compared to these two items. Meanwhile, when everyone thought about how they could trade Guild Points for these items, a passionate flame lit up in all of their eyes. The absurdly high demand of Guild Points didn’t deter their passion at all. At this moment, they wanted to rush out of the room and start earning Guild Points immediately.

“You’ve seen the Attributes on these items for yourselves. As to whether or not you can trade for them, that will depend on the effort you put in. In addition, I also have some good news to tell all of you. I will reward Guild Points to the first 100 members in the Guild to get promoted into a Tier 1 class. First place will receive a reward of 50,000 points, so all of you, work hard.” Seeing the high morale of the crowd, Shi Feng added more fuel to the fire.

Currently, not a single player had become a Tier 1 class in the entire Star-Moon Kingdom. The various Guilds around the kingdom were all focused on raiding the 50-man Team Dungeons in their respective cities. None of them knew the importance of Tier 1 players. Presently, only Shi Feng knew that Tier 1 players were the key requirement to raid a Level 20, 100-man Team Dungeon. In addition, Tier 1 players also played an important role in the competition between Guilds. The sooner a Guild possessed Tier 1 players, the more beneficial it would be to the Guild’s future development.

This was the reason why Shi Feng had ordered his Guild members to level up quickly rather than waste time competing over the First Clear for the Level 10, 50-man Team Dungeons.

Everyone’s fighting spirit soared once more when they heard Shi Feng’s announcement.

At this moment, they all viewed their decision to join Zero Wing as the best decision they had ever made.

No other Guild would offer Fine-Gold and Dark-Gold items to its members, much less Epic items.

On the other hand, not only had Shi Feng made the items available for trade, but he also spent a large sum of money to encourage everyone to raise their strengths. Players would never find these opportunities in any other Guild.

If they could earn the reward of 50,000 Guild Points, even if they didn’t want the Epic items, they could still gain several Fine-Gold or Dark-Gold items, greatly increasing their prowess.

After the meeting ended, the core members headed towards the Class Association to receive their Class Change Quest, afraid that the others would beat them to the top prize.

“It should be about time for me to upgrade my class as well.” Shi Feng smiled faintly.

Shi Feng had wanted to take on his Class Change Quest for a while now. However, he celebrated the fact that he had not already done so. He would have regretted that decision.

Before the meeting started, Shi Feng had already appraised the drops from the Mechanical Slayer. In the looting war, Zero Wing had actually managed to obtain 103 items, not 102. There was one item Shi Feng had not revealed.

The item Shi Feng hid was none other than the crystal-encased ancient sword.

Shi Feng had kept it hidden because that item was simply too frightening. Even if he added together the value of the other 102 items, it would not reach even a hundredth of the Sword in the Stone. If others learned about this item, it would definitely cause a sensation to sweep throughout God’s Domain, which was why Shi Feng had decided to keep silent about it.

The Sword in the Stone was neither a weapon nor armor. It was a Legacy Item. Moreover, the Legacy it contained was no ordinary Legacy. It was a Legacy Item even more powerful than the Magic Weapon Star’s Reminiscence.
