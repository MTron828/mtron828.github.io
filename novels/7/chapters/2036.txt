Chapter 2037 – Whimsical Battle

He blocked it? Mountain Passenger stared at the remnants of his arrows in astonishment.

He wasn’t the only one surprised by the outcome. The other nine members of Three Kills’ personal security team were also stunned.

Most of Starlink’s members might not know about Mountain Passage’s Triple Moon Strike, but as long-term friends, they were aware of how powerful the combat technique was. Not even they dared to intercept the move directly. Not only would they suffer grievous injuries by doing so, but it would also force them to reveal holes in their defenses.

Yet, Shi Feng had neutralized the technique effortlessly. For a moment, they wondered if their eyes had played a trick on them, and Mountain Passage had simply used an ordinary attack, not truly employing a combat technique.

“Not bad. While it looks like a normal attack, it’s actually an Advanced Combat Technique that can end a life if one’s not careful. No wonder why you were so confident,” Shi Feng praised, chuckling at the distant Mountain Passenger.

Mountain Passage wasn’t pleased to receive Shi Feng’s praise, but humiliated, giving the Swordsman an intensely frosty expression.

As one of Jormungandr’s peak experts, he had been quite famous in the virtual gaming world for over a decade. He felt humiliated and displeased to receive such an evaluation from an unknown junior, who was still in his early 20s.

“You have a big mouth for someone so young! You merely relied on your high Strength to block one of my moves! I’ll show you what a true expert is!” Mountain Passenger bellowed as he readied his bow.

Xiu... Xiu... Xiu...

One streak of black light after another flew toward Shi Feng. Although each attack carried Mountain Passenger’s normal Strength, the Ranger had lunched a large number of attacks simultaneously, his arrows raining down on Shi Feng without pause.

Advanced Combat Technique, Storm Barrage!

Unlike Triple Moon Strike, Storm Barrage didn’t rely on overwhelming power to destroy the target Rather, it relied on a continuous stream of attacks to suppress and whittle down the target.

Mountain Passenger had created the Advanced Combat Technique specifically to counter Strength-based players. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

While the Ranger fired his arrows, Seven Light and the other Zero Wing members shifted their gazes to Shi Feng.

“What? Are you thinking of helping him? If that’s the case, I’ve got some bad news for you! You won’t get past me!” Tyrant Dragon, a Level 61, Tier 2 Berserker and another member of Three Kills’ personal security team, chuckled at Seven Light and the others. “You can only blame that kid for provoking the wrong person. He might have lived a while longer, but now, no one can save him.”

“Help?” Giving Tyrant Dragon a curious look, Seven Light asked, “Why would we try to help him?”

“You don’t realize why he needs help? You guys are really looking down on Mountain Passenger.” Tyrant Dragon could not help but laugh at Seven Light’s response. He never expected to find a bunch of nobodies looking down on Mountain Passenger, someone who had been renowned in the virtual gaming world back in the day. “Mountain is quite strong. If he hadn’t been keeping such a low profile, he could’ve easily ranked among the top 100 on the God’s Domain’s Experts List.

But since it’s been so long since anyone has made me laugh, I’ll hold off for now and let you witness how powerless someone who only relies on overwhelming Strength truly is before Mountain Passenger. This lesson will benefit you all.”

As soon as Tyrant Dragon finished speaking, more of Mountain Passenger’s arrows rained down on Shi Feng.

Not only were these arrows incredibly fast, but they’d also collide while in mid-flight, altering their attack trajectories. The complexity of Mountain Passenger’s attacks was on an entirely different level than the Rangers who guarded the mountain path.

However, despite the arrows descending, he simply and leisurely walked toward the Ranger. As if they were deliberately avoiding Shi Feng, none of the falling arrows touched him. Although some of the arrows looked as if they’d find their mark, a blue light would flash before Shi Feng, deflecting the arrows and sending them to crash into other arrows. Like the domino effect, these arrows would then collide with other arrows. Eventually, every arrow that might have struck Shi Feng landed at his feet.

“Am I dreaming?”

Every player watching the battle was stupefied by the scene.

Although they had considered the possibility of Shi Feng avoiding the arrows or using a Skill to block them, they had never imagined that a player could counter a rain-like attack method using nothing more than normal attacks. Not even Domain Realm experts would necessarily succeed, let alone peak experts.

Storm Barrage consumed a lot of Stamina, so Mountain Passenger was forced to stop after a little more than ten seconds of using the technique. Now, when he looked at Shi Feng, who stood less than 20 yards away, he did so with an expression that was tenser than ever before.

Although he didn’t want to admit it, Shi Feng’s performance wasn’t anything like his previous feat.

The Swordsman had relied on brute force to counter his Triple Moon Strike, but now, he relied entirely on combat techniques.

“Although I don’t know why you would think that I’m not a real expert or why you chose to attack me first, I’d like to know if it’s my turn to attack now?” Shi Feng asked Mountain Passenger with a lackluster expression.

The moment Shi Feng finished his question, Mountain Passenger felt an unprecedented pressure weigh down on him. He immediately realized that Shi Feng wasn’t just some player with nothing but Basic Attributes, but someone with combat standards that could rival, or surpass, his own. Upon realizing this fact, Mountain Passenger pushed his five senses to their limits and focused all of his attention on Shi Feng.

However, Shi Feng suddenly vanished without a trace. By the time he relocated the Swordsman, the man had moved within attack range.

Tier 2 Taboo Skill, Instant Strike!

A blue flash passed by Mountain Passenger’s throat Despite seeing the attack, the Ranger had no time to block or dodge the strike. He could only watch as Killing Ray slit his throat, draining his HP bar. Eventually, his HP fell to zero, and he collapsed to the ground.

Only after Mountain Passenger’s vision faded and his body was thoroughly paralyzed did he understand that Shi Feng had killed him, and he had been utterly powerless to retaliate.

When Mountain Passenger died, the battlefield seemed to freeze as everyone stared at the Ranger’s corpse in silence. Mountain Passenger, one of Three Kills’ personal bodyguards, had died, just like that...

The players who were most shocked were undoubtedly Tyrant Dragon and the other guard team members.

Although they couldn’t believe that the Ranger was dead, their instincts as peak experts forced them to move. They immediately put more distance between them and Shi Feng, moving as far from the Swordsman as possible. Their instincts screamed at them that if this man came within attack range, they would suffer dire consequences.
