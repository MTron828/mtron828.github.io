Chapter 405 – Eternal Chamber of Commerce

“This can’t be real, right, Vice President Xia?” Lu Wen asked as she looked at Xia Qingying in disbelief. “This is the Luminous Glory List we are talking about. Black Flame has only repelled two of the Paimon Conglomerate’s core paragons. How can he qualify for the list?”

The Luminous Glory List might be the least significant list out of the Seven Luminaries Lists, but it remained an unreachable goal for most, if not all, paragons in the Starlight Realm.

This was because those capable of entering the Luminous Glory List were all experts who had reached the fifth-floor standard at a young age. After all, the Luminous Glory List only recorded geniuses under the age of 35.

It was true that the Paimon Conglomerate’s Storm and Saint Arm were rare paragons in the Starlight Realm. However, defeating the two of them was not enough to prove that Black Flame had reached the fifth-floor standard already.

“I don’t know how the Seven Luminaries Alliance came to this conclusion, either, but since the Alliance has decided on this placing, it should have some information that we aren’t privy to. After all, the Seven Luminaries Alliance has never been wrong. The Alliance will never add someone to the Luminous Glory List without verified information,” Xia Qingying said. Then, wearing a faint smile, she continued, “Although I’ve long since known that Black Flame could make significant achievements in the Greater God’s Domain, I didn’t think he would bring me such a huge surprise so soon. Those old fellows are probably panicking right about now.”

“Panic? They’re probably dying from regret right about now! This is a Luminous Glory expert we are talking about!” Lu Wen said ecstatically. “So long as a Luminous Glory expert reaches Tier 6, they’ll instantly rise to become one of the top 10 experts of their Realm!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Tier 4 experts might be insignificant in the Greater God’s Domain, but it was a completely different story for Tier 4 experts on the Luminous Glory List.

Such experts could no longer be regarded as budding geniuses. Instead, they were already bona fide powerhouses.

So long as a Luminous Glory expert reached Tier 6, even conglomerates would fear them.

At this time, the masked woman sitting next to Xia Qingying suddenly asked, “Are you certain about this, Qingying?”

The masked woman’s voice was void of emotions. Even hearing about the Luminous Glory List, something that would normally excite everyone in the Starlight Realm, the woman’s voice did not show the slightest bit of emotional fluctuations.

“I’ve made up my mind.” In a firm tone, Xia Qingying said, “I am going to use my reinforcement privilege!”

“Alright, but don’t regret it,” the masked woman said. “He is but an existence at the bottom of the Luminous Glory List. I hate to break it to you, but it is unlikely you can become one of our members by relying on him. If you fail, we will take back the token?she?

gave you, and you will lose your eligibility to join us.”

After saying so, the masked woman left the office without another word.

“Vice President Xia, this is the only opportunity?she?has left us with.” After seeing the masked woman leave, Lu Wen quietly asked, “Are you really going to gamble it on Black Flame?”

The masked woman was a representative of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce, an apex power standing at the pinnacle of the Greater God’s Domain. Out of all the powers in the Starlight Realm, only the Galaxy Conglomerate had some dealings with the Eternal Chamber of Commerce. The other powers in the Starlight Realm weren’t even qualified to get acquainted with the Eternal Chamber of Commerce.

“I don’t have a better choice.” Revealing a wry smile, Xia Qingying said, “The token?she?gave us has a time limit. Moreover,?she?isn’t a core executive of the Eternal Chamber of Commerce, so I am already fortunate I can have a reserve membership slot.”

The Eternal Chamber of Commerce only released 100 reserve membership slots across the Greater World each year, and many conglomerates couldn’t even get their hands on one. So, she was already incredibly fortunate to have received one of these slots, which gave her the qualifications to fight for official membership.

Inside a luxurious suite on the God’s Domain Association’s 600th floor…

Stepping out of the meditation room, Shi Feng couldn’t help but let out a rueful sigh as he looked out the window at the unobstructed night view of Star Lake City.

The God’s Domain Association’s 600th floor was a place off-limits to non-VIP guests. Meanwhile, even conglomerates would have to go to great lengths to obtain VIP status in the God’s Domain Association. However, in Star Lake City, so long as one became a vice commander of the Star Lake Legion, one could stay on the 600th floor for up to seven days for free every month.

Seven days might not seem like a long time, but it was enough to provide extraordinary benefits to those below the three-star mental strength grandmaster standard.

Not only could the God’s Domain Association’s meditation rooms help users recover from mental fatigue rapidly, but they could also accelerate the development of users’ mental strength by a large margin.

These meditation rooms were also why most of the Star Lake Legion’s vice commanders could reach the two-star mental strength grandmaster standard.

It’s a pity I can only stay here for seven days a month. If I could stay here for a full month, even reaching the mental strength grandmaster realm wouldn’t be out of the question,?Shi Feng thought as he felt his body’s energized state.?Going by the Star Lake Legion’s rules, once I use up my allotted seven days, I will have to pay 10,000 Star Coins and 10,000 City Contributions every day if I want to continue staying here. If I want to stay the full month, I will need 230,000 Star Coins and 230,000 City Contributions…

The threshold to becoming a mental strength grandmaster was incredibly difficult to reach. Even inhabitants born in the Greater World would have difficulty reaching it, with the chances of a person becoming a mental strength grandmaster being less than 1%.

However, so long as a person became a mental strength grandmaster, not only would their status and identity undergo significant changes in the Greater World, but their control over their mind would also undergo a qualitative transformation.

For Shi Feng, this qualitative transformation would be of significant help to him in lifting the seals on the Shadow Incinerator.

If he could remove even one seal from the Shadow Incinerator, further increasing the weapon’s strength, he would be confident in escaping with his life even if he came across the Paimon Conglomerate’s Tier 6 army without having to resort to using the Shadow Incinerator’s double-edged Skills.

Unfortunately, earning City Contributions wasn’t an easy task, even for a vice commander of the Star Lake Legion. If he wanted to earn tens of thousands of City Contribution quickly, he’d have to do so through city battles.

Meanwhile, the prerequisite for participating in city battles was to have a battle group.

Commander Red Frost has really given me a difficult problem,?Shi Feng thought.

Originally, Shi Feng’s plan was to join a random battle group to earn City Contributions while slowly solidifying Zero Wing’s foothold in Star Lake City.

However, because of Red Frost’s arrangement, he became a vice commander all of a sudden. While this position afforded him much more freedom and benefits than the average official participant, it also came with many problems.

Firstly, Shi Feng needed to form his own battle group. As a newcomer in the Greater World, this was not an easy task for him. After all, the various battle groups in the Star Lake Legion were backed by either a corporation or an in-game power. This allowed these battle groups to have a reliable supply of weapons, equipment, and even resources for developing mental strength.

In contrast, Shi Feng had nothing to offer to those in his battle group. And if he couldn’t offer anything, there was no way any expert would be willing to join his battle group.

Whatever. There’s no use thinking about these things. I’ll just post a recruitment notice at the training center tomorrow and try to recruit as many people as I can,?Shi Feng thought with a wry smile.

After verifying that God’s Domain’s system update was completed, Shi Feng laid into his new virtual gaming cabin and logged back into God’s Domain.

Shortly after Shi Feng logged into God’s Domain, the latest issue of the Seven Luminaries Lists also started being sold across Star Lake City.
