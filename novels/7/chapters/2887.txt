Chapter 2888 – Zero Wing in an Uproar

Fang Shihan couldn’t help a smile when she saw Shi Feng’s stunned face. She then asked leisurely, “Do my conditions confuse you, Master Shi?”

“Indeed, a little.” Shi Feng nodded.

There was no doubt that the Fang family had extraordinary origins. Moreover, Fang Shihan herself was Mythology’s First Vice Guild Leader. No matter how he looked at it, the woman already had a boundless future ahead of her. She was an existence nobody in the outside world dared to offend.

He might’ve become a mental strength master, but the benefits he could bring to Fang Shihan were merely limited to the Upper Zone’s commodities. This was also the main reason the Upper Zone’s various organizations bent over backward for mental strength masters. Apart from these trade commodities, he found it hard to imagine what other help Fang Shihan might need from him.

“I believe you should also understand what it means to own wealth beyond one’s capabilities, Master Shi.” Sighing, Fang Shihan said slowly, “The Fang family used to have a mental strength master. However, along with this master’s passing, the Fang family’s circumstances in the Upper Zone have deteriorated. At this point, many of the middle layer’s various organizations are even targeting the middle-layer reserve slot I own. Hence, I hope you can intervene in this matter for me, Master Shi. If you do, those organizations might back off out of fear.”

“A reserve slot for the middle layer?” Shi Feng was startled by Fang Shihan’s words.

The reserve slots for the Upper Zone’s base layer were already incomparably precious, and they were more than enough to tempt the base layer’s various organizations. A reserve slot for the middle layer would be even more precious and tempting

Moreover, based on Fang Shihan’s words, this reserve slot was transferable; it didn’t bind to specific individuals after use.

This reserve slot was countless times more precious than the temporary three-month slots the base layer’s organizations competed for in the contribution competitions. It would be strange if the middle layer’s organizations were not interested in acquiring this reserve slot.

“Master Shi, would you be willing to cooperate?” Fang Shihan asked, a hint of apprehension flashing across her eyes as she looked at Shi Feng.

Originally, she had already decided to give up on this reserve slot because she couldn’t keep it with Mythology’s strength.

However, an opportunity had presented itself to her now.

If she found the help of an ordinary mental strength master, the middle layer’s various organizations wouldn’t fear her at all. They would still try to snatch her reserve slot without fear. However, it was a different story if the mental strength master were Shi Feng. Shi Feng had become a mental strength master at an unprecedentedly young age. With his potential, the Green God Company was bound to place great importance on him. So long as Shi Feng was willing to stand up for her, she might be able to keep this reserve slot.

After Shi Feng gave the matter some thought, he said, “Alright, I agree to your conditions. However, I need to add one condition.”

“Please speak, Master Shi,” Fang Shihan responded without hesitation.

“One hundred million trade points!” Shi Feng stated. “What are your thoughts on this, Miss Fang?”

Apart from the trade points he earned from trading in Seven Luminaries Crystals to the Green God Company some time ago, he hadn’t made any extra points during this period. Meanwhile, apart from Life Potions, he also needed to spend a lot of trade points while living in the Upper Zone. This would only increase after he had Fire Dance and the others move into the Upper Zone. His expenditure of trade points would skyrocket if he had to nurture a mansion full of people.

Hence, acquiring trade points was a must. “One hundred million?” After pondering the condition, Fang Shihan gritted her teeth and answered, “No problem. I can transfer them to you through my account.”

Once Fang Shihan agreed to his extra condition, Shi Feng made his way into Zero Wing’s headquarters and signed a contract with her, assuring both sides.

After signing the contract, Fang Shihan promptly left Zero Wing’s headquarters to make the necessary preparations. She acted decisively and carefully on this matter.

Inside the maglev limousine heading to the airport...

“Vice Guild Leader, do you really intend to follow Shi Feng in the future?” White Feather asked as she looked at Fang Shihan, who had her eyes closed and was deep in thought. “If you leave the Guild so abruptly, the Guild won’t spare you. Although Shi Feng is now a mental strength master, there are significant differences between mental strength masters. He won’t necessarily be able to stop all the organizations operating in the middle layer. If he handles things poorly, you’ll not only lose your reserve slot but also have to face the Guild’s retaliation.”

Mythology was one of the Five Great Super Guilds. Some of the Upper Zone organizations that had partnered with the Guild because of God’s Domain had the support of powerful and high-ranking mental strength masters.

Fang Shihan was Mythology’s First Vice Guild Leader. Her abrupt departure from Mythology would deal a massive blow to the Guild’s reputation and morale. Mythology would seek revenge for this matter, both in God’s Domain and in the Upper Zone.

“I don’t have a choice. This is my last chance,” Fang Shihan replied with a wry smile. “If I continue waiting, I’ll lose the reserve slot for sure. Once that happens, I doubt I can get it back, even if a powerful mental strength master stands up for me. I can only pray that Shi Feng is capable of fending off those greedy organizations now.” Even mental strength masters had extreme difficulty securing one middle-layer reserve slot, and they treated these slots like family heirlooms. After all, these slots could allow a person to live in the middle layer unconditionally.

If she couldn’t retain this reserve slot, her chances of becoming a mental strength master were practically zero.

In the Upper Zone’s history, the people capable of becoming a mental strength master without ever setting foot into the Upper Zone’s middle layer were few and far between. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that 99% of the mental strength masters that had ever walked this world became mental strength masters only after living in the middle layer for some time.

While Fang Shihan was making her way back to the Upper Zone, news of Elder Qi’s group getting crippled reached Yuantian City’s Upper Zone, shocking the various organizations based there.

None of these organizations ever thought that Shi Feng possessed such frightening strength. He had single-handedly fended off the encirclement of so many grandmaster-level experts. This unexpected development prompted many organizations looking to sell the Infinity Master a favor to shrink back.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What should we do, Young Master? The organizations in Haitian City’s and Yuantian City’s Upper Zones are no longer willing to assist us,” Yi Kui asked worriedly after calling Lu Tiandi. “Moreover, now that Shi Feng’s prestige has increased, many organizations are considering partnering with him to acquire Seven Luminaries Crystals from Zero Wing.”

“I understand. Withdraw from Yuantian City’s Upper Zone for now,” Lu Tiandi said, smiling faintly. “Teacher has learned about this situation. He’ll most likely personally cripple Shi Feng. All we need to do now is sit back and watch.”

“Yes, sir!” Yi Kui grew joyful when he heard Lu Tiandi’s words.

If Fu Jiuzhong personally took action, then everything would be fine. Once Zero Wing no longer had Shi Feng backing it, Starlink would have a much easier time annexing Zero Wing.

Fenglin City, Zero Wing Tower:

Along with Shi Feng’s return, excitement filled Zero Wing’s members, particularly the experts who had joined Zero Wing only recently.

The reason for everyone’s excitement was Shi Feng’s awarding Life Potions to Fire Dance and a dozen other core executives in front of all of the Guild’s internal members. Afterward, he had announced that he would award those internal members who performed excellently with Life Potions. They even had the opportunity to enter the Upper Zone!

This announcement threw the entire headquarters into an uproar.

The Upper Zone was a dreamland countless people wished to enter. Let alone living in the Upper Zone, they usually didn’t even dare dream of entering the Upper Zone. This was because the Upper Zone was a place only a select few organizations in the world could come into contact with. Ordinary civilians like themselves had no chance of entering the Upper Zone.

However, the impossible had now become possible!

“Guild Leader, is this really fine?” Fire Dance asked worriedly when she saw the new reward system.

In the new reward system, a Tier 4 internal member that successfully raised their Mana Body’s Completion Rate to 110% would receive three bottles of Life Potion. Afterward, they would receive one bottle for every subsequent percent of improvement. If they reached 115%, they would receive another three bottles.

There was also a reward for Concentration standards. After one reached the Tier 4 Basic Concentration standard, every increase in rank would net them one Phantom Potion, three bottles if they reached the Tier 4 Peak standard, and ten bottles if they reached the Tier 5 standard.

As for combat standards, internal members would receive one Life Potion if they reached the Void Realm and three bottles if they reached the Domain Realm.

Most importantly, anyone in the Guild who got promoted to Tier 5 would get to live in the Upper Zone with 100% certainty!

Setting aside the Upper Zone’s residency, just the reward of the various potions was already plenty absurd. Others might not understand how precious these potions were, but Fire Dance knew that these potions were available only in limited quantities.

“Relax. There won’t be a problem,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “On the contrary, I hope more people can claim the rewards.”

The Life Potion was of significant help for improving a person’s physical fitness. Meanwhile, if Zero Wing wished to develop quickly, it wouldn’t do for the Guild to rely solely on him. Zero Wing needed at least several grandmaster-level experts under its command. Only then would it no longer have to fear the provocation of other forces. Hence, he needed to increase the rewards for Zero Wing’s internal members.

By doing so, he could also raise the motivation of Zero Wing’s members and the chances of producing Void Realm experts and Domain Realm experts.

Moreover, with the Life Potions he provided, Fire Dance and Master Lei Bao would break through to the grandmaster level in a few days. This was especially true for Fire Dance, who had already reached the Domain Realm in the Realms of Refinement and the Ascension Realm in the Realms of Truth. She only lacked a bit of inspiration and a boost to her brain activity to become a neutralizing grandmaster.

Afterward, Shi Feng discussed the Guild’s rapid development with Fire Dance and the Guild’s other executives. Dealing with the Outerworld forces’ invasion wasn’t an easy task. If handled poorly, the Guild might lose Silverwing City and Ancient Rock City.

One day went by quickly.

It’s about time I returned to the game.

After taking a look at his watch, Shi Feng drank a Life Potion, lay down in the virtual gaming cabin in his bedroom, and logged into God’s Domain.
