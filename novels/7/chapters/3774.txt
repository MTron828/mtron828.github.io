Chapter 3775 - 849 - Holy Dragon Spear's Strongest

Flame Vein Battle Arena, VIP Seating Area:

“I didn’t expect we would get to watch such an exciting first match. A face-off between the current and former number one chosen ones. Rarely has such a situation occurred in Holy Dragon Spear’s history.”

“I heard that Red Frost’s condition has improved. If she has recovered her peak strength, we will be in for an interesting match.”

“So what if Red Frost has recovered her peak strength? Don’t forget that Heiser is the most monstrous talent Holy Dragon Spear has nurtured in the last couple of centuries. She has long since caught up to Red Frost’s peak. Not to mention, Ember Dragon recently gave her a Peak Gold Combat Technique’s Legacy Guidance. With Heiser’s talent, she has probably grasped it completely already.”

“Dammit! How lucky can Holy Dragon Spear get? First, there was Red Frost. Now, there is Heiser!”

“With such monsters, I bet it won’t be long before Holy Dragon Spear climbs a few ranks higher in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary.”

When the big shots in the VIP seating area saw the first match-up, some exclaimed in surprise, while some sighed ruefully. The majority, though, expressed their curiosity about Heiser’s current strength and Holy Dragon Spear’s future ranking in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary.

The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary was one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries, and it was rumored that its existence predated the Greater God’s Domain. Many ancient families and powers operated in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, with those at the pseudo-apex standard numbering as many as eight. However, due to the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary having many Taboo Dungeons and Taboo Resources, competition within the Sanctuary was incredibly fierce.

To prevent outside forces from invading and stealing these Taboo Dungeons and Taboo Resources, the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s various powers had agreed to form a united front when dealing with outsiders. Additionally, they had agreed not to wage large-scale wars against one another. Instead, they would periodically host team competitions to decide how many Taboo Dungeons and Taboo Resources each power could occupy.

These team competitions restricted each participating team to 100 members. Due to this restriction, every participant mattered. Thus, the advent of Heiser and the return of Red Frost would benefit Holy Dragon Spear greatly.

Holy Dragon Spear was already the fifth-ranked power in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. If it could raise its rank by even one, the number of Taboo Dungeons and Taboo Resources it could own would increase by a large margin.

…

While the VIP spectators conversed, several dozen Level 230-plus, Tier 6 experts entered the VIP seating area. Upon seeing these experts, many VIP spectators rose from their seats to greet the two men leading the group.

Of the two men, one was a middle-aged elf with graying hair, while the other was a young demidragon with two pitch-black wings sprouting from his back.

The middle-aged elf was fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, and his level reached 239. This was a level that few players could reach in the Greater God’s Domain.

As for the young demidragon, though his level only reached 235, he was also fully equipped with Divine Artifacts. Additionally, the presence of Elemental Laws could be vaguely seen in his pale golden eyes.

“Great Commander? Why are you here?” When Xiao Yilong saw the middle-aged elf, he promptly went to greet the other party with a confused expression. “Has the problem at the passage been dealt with?”

The middle-aged elf was South Lake, the Holy Dragon Hunter. He was Holy Dragon Spear’s strongest member as well as the adventurer team’s Great Commander. After Holy Dragon Spear discovered the entrance to the Eternal Realm, he promptly left to preside over the situation there to prevent other powers from having any nefarious ideas.

“The situation at the passage has been stabilized. So, when Vice Guild Leader Ember expressed interest in our Battle of the Chosen Ones, I dared not ignore his request,” South Lake said with a smile.

As South Lake spoke, Xiao Yilong glanced at the young demidragon beside South Lake, a hint of disgust flashing in his eyes.

Ember Dragon!

He was the First Vice Guild Leader of the Dragon God Palace, one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. He was also known as the Uncrowned War God, one of the Divine Glory List’s top ten experts. Most importantly, he was the thief who had stolen Red Frost’s fortuitous opportunity and used it to become a powerhouse that few powers in the Greater God’s Domain dared to provoke.

“You flatter me, Great Commander South Lake. I am but a Vice Guild Leader of the Dragon God Palace,” Ember Dragon said with a faint smile. He behaved like he did not notice Xiao Yilong’s expression of disgust. “I came here hoping the Dragon God Palace could establish a partnership with Holy Dragon Spear. If we work together, I am certain our future achievements in the Eternal Realm can rival the various apex powers.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ember Dragon’s words greatly shocked the various powers’ executives present.

As the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s first-ranked power, the Dragon God Palace possessed incredible strength already. It was also one of the first ten powers to discover the Eternal Realm’s entrance. If Holy Dragon Spear partnered with the Dragon God Palace, they could establish control over the entrance. This, in turn, would allow their strength to skyrocket in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary.

“Great Commander, are we really going to partner with the Dragon God Palace?” Xiao Yilong was similarly shocked by the news.

It should be known that Red Frost wasn’t the only one who suffered from Ember Dragon’s actions. Holy Dragon Spear, as a whole, also suffered immensely. After all, the adventurer team had sacrificed many experts while competing for the ruin, with the faction that Red Frost and Xiao Yilong belonged to having sacrificed the most. Yet, they had nothing to show for their sacrifices. To make matters worse, Holy Dragon Spear’s rank in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary kept falling afterward, and only recently did it climb to fifth place.

Originally, Xiao Yilong thought that things would start to turn around for their faction now that Red Frost had recovered. But if Holy Dragon Spear truly partnered with the Dragon God Palace, neither Red Frost nor their faction would ever be able to see the light of day again…

“It’s not decided yet, which is why I returned. I will use the competition results to discuss this matter with the Elders and Grand Elders. You’ll naturally know the outcome after our discussion,” South Lake said, looking at Xiao Yilong calmly. “Alright, enough of this topic! Let’s watch the competition!”

Xiao Yilong dared not object. As he was merely a vice commander in Holy Dragon Spear, he had neither the strength nor authority to question South Lake’s decisions.

Frost, it’s all up to you now… Xiao Yilong prayed as he turned to the ring to look at Red Frost.

South Lake already made his intentions clear: he would decide based on the Elders’ and Grand Elders’ decisions. If Red Frost managed to win enough Elders and Grand Elders to her side after the Battle of the Chosen Ones, the partnership with the Dragon God Palace would fall through. However, if Red Frost couldn’t win enough support, she would no longer have a place in Holy Dragon Spear.
