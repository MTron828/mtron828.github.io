Chapter 3862 - 936 - Clash Between Experts

“How did they bump into each other?” Fervent Samsara was surprised by the news.

As someone who had participated in the last Continental Championship, Fervent Samsara remembered Ink Crystal and Garuda as if he had met them yesterday. His memory of Ink Crystal was especially vivid. After all, Ink Crystal was akin to a god in the Continental Championship. No mortal could ever forget her.

“Guild Leader, should we intervene?” Gentle Snow asked Shi Feng, her beautiful eyes filled with excitement and trepidation.

Gentle Snow was well aware that she had hardly contributed to their party in the Continental Championship. It was especially so when their party went up against Garuda’s and Ink Crystal’s parties. She had fared no differently than an infant against them. However, after returning from the Continental Championship and training in the Tower of the Abyss, she often considered challenging them.

“We can try,” Shi Feng said after some thought. “Soul, send us your coordinates. Send them to Purgatory Jade’s group as well. We’ll take action once everyone has gathered.”

Both Savage Gods and the Thunder Empire currently ranked among the competition’s top ten in the number of Everlasting City Tokens collected. With Ink Crystal and Garuda the central figures of their respective powers, they likely held many tokens. If Zero Wing could kill even one of them, it could occupy four plots of land with certainty.

Of course, killing these two individuals would not be easy. The teams that managed to survive this far were all elites among elites—far superior to even the two Evil Nature legions Zero Wing faced earlier. Not to mention, Zero Wing’s numbers had dwindled significantly since then. Zero Wing didn’t even have 200 members left in the competition, so tackling a force of over a hundred players would be a challenge.

“Okay.” Hidden Soul nodded before sending Shi Feng a set of coordinates.

After Shi Feng received the coordinates, he promptly used a Tier 5 Group Invisibility Scroll and headed to the coordinates with Gentle Snow and the others.

With less than two hours remaining in Everlasting City’s competition, the various powers had already grown desperate. They now resorted to any means to locate and kill other players.

Zero Wing had experienced their desperation on more than one occasion. During these encounters, Zero Wing’s forces had been bombarded with large-scale Destruction Spells that rivaled Tier 6 Curses as soon as they were detected. Moreover, these Spells hadn’t been cast one by one but in barrages of seven or eight. Even a tank as powerful as Purgatory Jade had nearly died under such assaults.

For this reason, Zero Wing’s forces would now only move out after concealing their appearances and aura. Otherwise, the probability of an unexpected failure would skyrocket.

…

About a dozen minutes later, Shi Feng’s group regrouped with Hidden Soul. Currently, a massive barrier enveloped a skyscraper several thousand yards away. The barrier isolated the members of Savage Gods and the Thunder Empire from the outside world. Evidently, the two powers did not want others to take advantage of their battle.

“Ink Crystal, there hasn’t been a moment I didn’t regret not fighting you in the Continental Championship. I even tried to find you using my connections after the competition, but you seemed to have evaporated into thin air; no matter how hard I tried, I never could find you. Thankfully, the heavens have been kind to me. Not only did you appear in this competition, but you even appeared before me now,” Garuda said, expressing his excitement and eagerness to fight Ink Crystal. “How about we fight to our heart’s content today? Just you and me; the winner takes all the tokens while the loser withdraws!”

“Are you sure you want to fight me one-on-one?” Ink Crystal looked at Garuda indifferently. “Have you forgotten losing to Black Flame? You might have grown stronger since then, but you are still nowhere strong enough to fight me.”

Ink Crystal’s arrogant and indifferent words enraged the Thunder Empire’s members. However, just as some were considering attacking Ink Crystal, a lithe figure suddenly stood in their way, the sight of this figure smothering their urges.

“Miss Ink Crystal, I admit you are strong, but if you think you have become invincible after reaching the sixth-floor standard, you are sorely mistaken!” Extreme Feather stated, staring at Ink Crystal coldly as she reached for the two Divine Artifact-ranked moon glaives on her back. Then, she vanished.

When Extreme Feather reappeared in everyone’s sight, she had already crossed a hundred yards and appeared behind Ink Crystal, her moon glaives bearing down on Ink Crystal’s back.

…

“How fast!” Hidden Soul was shocked when she saw Extreme Feather’s movements from afar.

This was the first time Hidden Soul had seen a player display such speed in God’s Domain. Extreme Feather had crossed the hundred-yard distance between her and Ink Crystal instantly. Moreover, by the time Hidden Soul had sensed Extreme Feather again, her weapons were already bearing down on Ink Crystal. Fifth-floor experts would not be able to react to her speed, even with their sixth sense.

As expected of the Angel of Death. Not only has she fused Phantom Dash with Lunar Cicada, but she has even integrated the fusion technique into her movements. At this rate, it won’t be long before she becomes peerless in reaction speed. 

Shi Feng was secretly amazed when he saw this scene.

Phantom Dash was a Tier 6 Skill that allowed its user to achieve instantaneous movement. It also enhanced its user’s Attack Speed and reaction speed. As for Lunar Cicada, it was a Gold Holy Art that thoroughly concealed the user’s existence when executed.

Normally, simply fusing the two moves would be a huge achievement. However, Extreme Feather had gone a step further, having integrated the fusion technique into her movements to the point where she could execute it instinctively. Only extraordinarily gifted individuals could accomplish such a feat.

If Extreme Feather’s opponent wasn’t ready for this fusion technique, they would be struck, even if they were a sixth-floor expert.

…

Extreme Feather’s moon glaives were only inches away from Ink Crystal when a stone cane suddenly appeared in their way, as if premeditated.

Clang!

The sound of metal and stone colliding echoed throughout the battlefield.

“You?!”

Extreme Feather looked at the bald young man wielding the stone cane in surprise. She had never expected anyone to be able to keep up with her speed.

“You are very fast. Had your opponent been an ordinary sixth-floor expert, your attack could very well have landed,” Desert River, the bald young man, said to Extreme Feather. Then, he glanced at Garuda and continued, “But you are still ten years too early to have my team leader fight you.”

After saying so, Desert River swung his cane, instantly compressing the surrounding space and sending Extreme Feather flying with an explosion that had reached the Tier 6 Limit standard.

“You’ve…reached the sixth-floor standard?!” Extreme Feather stared at Desert River in even greater astonishment, her hands trembling from the collision of weapons.

“That’s right,” Desert River admitted frankly. “Now, you should know you are not qualified to fight my team leader. I alone am enough to deal with you all!”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Is that so?” When Garuda saw that Desert River had reached the sixth-floor standard, he did not despair. Instead, he simply said in frustration, “I wanted to save this secret for Black Flame, but it seems that isn’t possible now.”

After saying so, Garuda threw a punch in Desert River’s direction. Multiple phantom fists hundreds of meters in size immediately appeared out of thin air and converged on Desert River. Each phantom fist carried power at the Tier 6 Limit standard, their fusion causing the surrounding space to collapse. Although Desert River had promptly responded to the attack by executing two Peak Gold Defensive Implement Manipulation Techniques, the impact still sent him stumbling several steps back.
