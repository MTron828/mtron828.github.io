Chapter 442 – Black Flame? A Saint?

“That’s right. It is very likely the Goddess of Space has left behind these ruins,” Unrestrained Lionheart said, nodding. Then, he cautiously continued, “It is why we must secure the ruins’ First Clear before the Holy Race does.”

“If it really is a relic of the Goddess of Space, indeed, we cannot let the Holy Race secure its First Clear,” Shi Feng said in agreement.

The Courtyard of Space left behind by the Goddess of Space was a place of incredible value as it housed two treasures made by the Goddess herself.

The first treasure was the Seven Luminaries Ring.

The second treasure was the Divine Spatial Potion.

The Seven Luminaries Ring was a ring that granted its wearer the best survival capabilities available in the Greater God’s Domain. Moreover, its use was not restricted by race. As for the Divine Spatial Potion, consuming it would permanently increase the user’s affinity to the power system(Mana or Holy Power) they were affiliated with by one level.

Meanwhile, both treasures could only be obtained from the Courtyard of Space’s First Clear.

In addition, players who secured the Courtyard of Space’s First Clear could obtain a large amount of Eternal Realm Reputation Points, which would greatly accelerate their development in the Eternal Realm.

“What do you think, Mr. Black Flame? Would you be willing to join our team?” Unrestrained Lionheart asked, taking the initiative to extend an invitation to Shi Feng. “So long as you agree to join us, I can pay you two Eternal Gold and one Fragmented Legendary item obtained from the ruins. If we successfully secure the First Clear, I will pay you an additional two Eternal Gold.”

As soon as Unrestrained Lionheart finished speaking, Death Omen and Thousand Scars couldn’t help but look at him in surprise and confusion.

The Eternal Realm had emerged only recently, so the various powers could only get their hands on a limited amount of Eternal Coins. For the most part, the various powers had to rely on their members to earn Eternal Coins.

Currently, the average Tier 4 titled expert in the Eternal Realm probably didn’t even have one Eternal Silver Coin in their pockets. So, even one Eternal Gold Coin was an unimaginable fortune.

It should be known that Unrestrained Lionheart had only promised two Eternal Gold Coins to the Tier 5 experts he had recruited thus far. Moreover, this amount would only be paid if they successfully secured the First Clear. Yet, Unrestrained Lionheart had promised Shi Feng, a Tier 4 player, a total of four Eternal Gold Coins and one Fragmented Legendary item from the ruins.

This was an unbelievable offer, even if Shi Feng was a Luminous Glory expert.

“That’s not a bad price,” Shi Feng said after pondering for a moment. “But if you want me to join, you’ll have to promise me two conditions.”

Unrestrained Lionheart was not surprised by Shi Feng’s words. Patiently, he said, “May I know what those conditions are?”

Nodding, Shi Feng said, “Firstly, I want command over the team. Secondly, I want the privilege of choosing any one item from the ruins’ harvest.”

…Is he crazy? Thousand Scars nearly jumped when she heard Shi Feng’s words.

The fact that Unrestrained Lionheart was taking the initiative to extend an invitation to Shi Feng was already plenty mind-blowing. After all, if given the opportunity, many Luminous Glory experts would probably offer to join their team for no remuneration.

Yet, even after receiving a sky-high offer from Unrestrained Lionheart, not only was Shi Feng not satisfied, but he was even asking to become the team’s leader and the privilege to choose any one item obtained from the ruins. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Death Omen similarly looked at Shi Feng in confusion.

The current Zero Wing was entirely reliant on Black Flame for its fame. Although it was proven that Zero Wing had some connections with Cheng Xin, the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s Little Princess, such a connection was far from enough to put Zero Wing on equal footing with Unrestrained Lionheart.

So, the fact that Unrestrained Lionheart was taking the initiative to invite Shi Feng could be regarded as a good opportunity for Zero Wing to form a connection with Unrestrained Lionheart. Yet, by the looks of things, Shi Feng had decided to let go of this opportunity.

Meanwhile, after listening to Shi Feng’s conditions, Unrestrained Lionheart silently pondered for a moment before saying, “I do not have the authority to agree to your two conditions, Mr. Black Flame. I will need to seek the commander’s opinion before I can give you a response.”

“No problem. You can contact me anytime after you have thought about it,” Shi Feng said, sending a friend request to Unrestrained Lionheart. Then, he promptly made his way out of the Flameheart Canyon.

After Shi Feng left, White Owl walked up to Unrestrained Lionheart and said, “Mr. Lionheart, I don’t think the commander will entertain Black Flame’s conditions for even a second. We might even get reprimanded for bringing them up.”

Shi Feng’s combat standard might have reached the fifth-floor standard, but he was nothing more than a bottom-ranked Luminous Glory expert. Such strength was nowhere near enough to attract their commander’s attention, let alone convince their commander to give him the command of the team.

“That might not be the case,” Unrestrained Lionheart said, smiling.

“It might not?” White Owl looked at Unrestrained Lionheart in confusion.

Looking at White Owl, Unrestrained Lionheart suddenly remembered something and patiently explained, “You might not know this since you weren’t in the Holy World previously, but some time ago, Black Flame defeated Hidden Wind, who is 42nd on the Luminous Glory List. Because of this, many people suspect that Black Flame might have already reached the realm of Saints. If we can have a Saint join our team, our chances of securing the First Clear will increase significantly.”

He defeated the 42nd-ranked Hidden Wind?

A Saint?

Whether it was White Owl, Death Omen, or Thousand Scars, all of them were dumbfounded by Unrestrained Lionheart’s words.

…

Pharos Town, Adventurer’s Association:

“I would like to purchase 300 Compounding Potions,” Shi Feng said as he presented his Adventurer Medallion at a VIP counter on the second floor.

The biggest function the Adventurer Medallion had during the Eternal Realm’s exploration stage was to let players purchase the Compounding Potion.

The Compounding Potion not only had the Holy Power Bottle’s effects but could also strengthen players’ mana. Moreover, it had a long duration of 12 hours and a low price of 10 Eternal Copper. It could be regarded as the best tool for players to survive in the Eternal Realm’s wilderness.

However, every town’s Adventurer’s Association would only sell 300 Compounding Potions each day. Once the Holy Race started to make their existence known in the Eternal Realm, there wouldn’t be enough Compounding Potions to go around, and players could make a fortune just by reselling these potions.

“Okay. That will be 30 Eternal Silver,” the beautiful receptionist behind the counter replied.

Immediately, Shi Feng paid the 30 Eternal Silver, put the 300 Compounding Potions into his bag space, and ran for the Alchemy Association.

…

Alchemy Association:

“How may I help you, Sir?” the female elf standing behind the commission counter asked as she looked at Shi Feng with a smile.

“Please help me start a material collection commission for Earthen Magic Flowers. I am paying one Eternal Copper for every ten Earthen Magic Flowers,” Shi Feng stated.

Although the Holy World evolving into the Eternal Realm had caused him to lose the opportunity to earn God Crystal Fragments, the appearance of the Holy Race had given him another opportunity to make a fortune.

Apart from handling commissions from NPCs, the various Associations in the Greater God’s Domain also handled commissions from players. Only, commissions made by players would not offer any EXP or Reputation Points on completion.

“How long would you like to keep your commission available?” the receptionist asked. “The handling fee the Alchemy Association charges is based on the commissions’ duration. Each day will cost 50 Eternal Copper, and you may only keep a commission active for up to three days.”

“Have it up for two days for the time being,” Shi Feng said as he took out the remaining 43 Eternal Silver Coins in his bag. “Use the rest to buy Earthen Magic Flowers.”

The Earthen Magic Flower was a material unique to the Eternal Realm, and it could be used to make all sorts of Mana Recovery Potions. However, as it was one of the more commonly available herbs that could be harvested out in the wilderness, it wasn’t worth much.

Currently, the market price for Earthen Magic Flowers was only one Eternal Copper Coin per 20.

However, this would change once the Holy Race made its existence known.

When players of the human race and the Holy Race fought, the penalty for death would be much more severe. For example, even after getting resurrected, human players killed by Holy Race players would continue to be tainted by Holy Power, and this Holy Power would cause their mana to grow incredibly unstable and prevent them from fighting normally.

Meanwhile, if players wished to recover the stability of their mana, they could either wait for a long time for their mana to recover naturally or use a Mana Stabilizer.

Consuming a Mana Stabilizer made from Earthen Magic Flowers could let players recover their mana’s stability immediately. Because of this effect, Mana Stabilizers would quickly be in high demand once the Holy Race began aggressively clashing with humans. This, in turn, would increase the demand for Earthen Magic Flowers. At that time, the price of Earthen Magic Flowers would quickly skyrocket.

Going by his memories, Shi Feng recalled that Earthen Magic Flowers had, at one point, sold for two Eternal Copper each. Even then, supply could never meet demand. As a result, Alchemists who had stockpiled Earthen Magic Flowers made a fortune during that period.

“Very well. Your commission has already been issued.”

After the elven receptionist received all the necessary information, she added Shi Feng’s commission to the Alchemy Association’s commission board. Shortly after this commission appeared, an uproar occurred among the players in the Alchemy Association.
