Chapter 3261 Chapter 335 – Six Great Secret Art

Although Shi Feng already knew the answer to his question when he saw the looks on the two girls’ faces, he still found it a little unbelievable that they had succeeded.

The mana techniques and combat techniques recorded in Ancient River Secret Land’s ancient steles differed from those recorded in Legacy Crystals.

Due to the dilapidated state of the ancient steles, the mana techniques and combat techniques recorded on them were also fragmented to varying degrees. Combined with the limitation of time, learning the techniques recorded on these ancient steles was much more challenging than learning techniques recorded in Legacy Crystals.

He had only gone offline for several hours. Even if he considered the time difference between the real and virtual worlds, no more than ten hours should have gone by in God’s Domain.

!!

Normally, it would be a stretch for most people to learn a Mana Technique from a Legacy Crystal in ten hours, let alone learn a God-ranked Mana Technique from an ancient stele.

It should be known that many new geniuses would enter the Ancient River Secret Land to learn Mana Techniques and combat techniques every month. Every one of these geniuses was an extraordinary individual. Yet, there would only be about a handful of players who could successfully learn a God-ranked Mana Technique or an Advanced Silver Combat Technique from the Ancient River Secret Land each year.

While Shi Feng knew that Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao were very talented at manipulating mana, he still found it incredulous that both of them had successfully learned the Mana Technique that only the old demon during his previous life had managed to learn.

“Mhm, we’ve learned it,” Midsummer said, nodding. However, aside from feeling excited, she also revealed a look of confusion as she added, “But what’s recorded on this stele doesn’t seem to be a Mana Technique…” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Not a Mana Technique?” Shi Feng was even more surprised now.

The old demon who joined Demon’s Gate was famous throughout the entire Starlight Realm during Shi Feng’s previous life. Meanwhile, either the old demon thought that nobody else could learn the Mana Cohesion Method or because the old demon thought the Mana Technique was no longer worth anything to him, but he had willingly revealed the Mana Cohesion Method’s existence during an interview with the Seven Luminaries Alliance.

Meanwhile, ever since the old demon broke the news, the Ancient River Kingdom’s Ancient River Secret Land had become a tourist attraction for many young geniuses in the Star Light Realm. Countless geniuses sought to learn the Mana Cohesion Method that had allowed the old demon to become famous throughout the Starlight Realm.

Unfortunately, apart from the old demon, nobody else had ever managed to learn the Mana Cohesion Method. As a result, the Mana Technique eventually became irrelevant in the Starlight Realm.

Knowing this, Shi Feng never expected any good news when he told Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao to try and learn the Mana Cohesion Method. Yet, now, not only did the two girls successfully learn the “Mana Technique,” but they were also telling him that whatever was recorded on the ancient stele wasn’t actually a Mana Technique?

Unless his memories were playing tricks on him, he was certain that the ancient stele before him was the same one mentioned by the old demon during his previous life.

“It seems to be a set of secret arts called the Four Gods Secret Art. Moreover, after we learned the secret art, the stele spat out these two things for us,” Midsummer said before taking out two finger-sized gold pieces. Not only did the two gold pieces radiate a dazzling glow, but they also exuded a frightening Divine Might.

The Four Gods Secret Art?! And these are…Divine Eternal Gold?! Shi Feng was shocked when he saw the gold pieces Midsummer took out.

“Are these things amazing, Guild Leader Black Flame?” Midsummer curiously asked when she saw the surprised look on Shi Feng’s face. From what she and Wu Xiaoxiao had learned about the Four Gods Secret Art, this secret art set wasn’t all that powerful. Rather than Mana Techniques that improved players’ combat power, the Four Gods Secret Art was closer to special items that improved players’ combat power.

This was great and all, but there was a problem in that the Four Gods Secret Art was split into four parts that corresponded to the Four Major Elements, and each part enhanced only one specific element. Moreover, only up to four players could learn the Four Gods Secret Art.

Currently, Midsummer had only grasped the earth element’s part, while Wu Xiaoxiao had only grasped the water element’s part.

To further complicate matters, they needed to expend a large amount of mana of corresponding elements to receive this improvement. If they tried to use items that contained an aggregate of mana, such as Magic Crystals and Mana Stones, as fuel, the improvements they would receive would be very small. If they wished to receive significant improvements, they would have to use Attributed Magic Crystals or highly valuable Seven Luminaries Crystals.

Moreover, even if they used Seven Luminaries Crystals to fuel the Four Gods Secret Art, they would only receive a 100% boost to Skills and Spells. While it might be a significant increase, it was by no means a worthwhile tradeoff. Rather than learn the Four Gods Secret Art, they’d rather learn a God-ranked Mana Technique.

As for the gold pieces the stele spat out, they might exude Divine Might, but they could only be regarded as ordinary Legendary materials. According to their item introduction, they could only be used to increase the forging success rate of weapons and equipment. Even then, the most they could do was increase the forging success rate of Fragmented Legendary items by 10%.

“Amazing? They’re far more than just amazing!” Shi Feng said, feeling a little exasperated when he saw the indifferent look on Midsummer’s face. “Setting aside how useful the Divine Eternal Gold is in weapon and equipment production, just the Four Gods Secret Art you’ve learned is of immense value. The Four Gods Secret Art is one of the Starlight Realm’s Six Great Secret Arts, and users of the secret art can rely on it to transcend tiers.”

Secret arts were different from combat techniques and mana techniques. They were special methods of using items in God’s Domain.

Among the Starlight Realm’s secret arts, six were recorded in the Starlight Realm’s Great Library as Great Secret Arts. According to legends, these Six Great Secret Arts could rival Gold Combat Techniques. So long as a player could fully grasp one of these Six Great Secret Arts, they would have the ability to transcend tiers. Moreover, unlike mana techniques and combat techniques, secret arts placed very little burden on their user’s Concentration. They relied mainly on external items for fuel.

The Four Gods Secret Art was the greatest achievement of the God of Four Elements. If players were to use only one out of four elements to execute the secret art, the effect they could exhibit would be weak. However, as the number of elements used to execute the Four Gods Secret Art increased, the greater the secret art’s effect would become.

Many powers in the Starlight Realm had expended countless manpower and resources to search for the Six Great Secret Arts. However, none of them had ever managed to come up with any powers.

Yet, now, Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao had learned one of these Six Great Secret Arts. Even if it was only a portion, it would still give the Starlight Realm’s various powers high blood pressure if they learned about it…

“By the way, in the time you were gone, many things happened in the secret land, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Wu Xiaoxiao suddenly said in an urgent tone. “Just an hour ago, the seventh qualifier had already appeared…”

“The seventh qualifier?” Shi Feng was stunned to hear this.

The official phase of the Rookie Competition had a three-day duration. It hadn’t even been half a day since the official phase began, yet seven players had already qualified to enter the Ancient River’s Heart.

Although there were many Heroic Spirits in the secret land, they weren’t everywhere. Originally, Shi Feng thought that with several dozen teams competing over these Heroic Spirits, it should take at least two days for the first qualifier to appear.

Yet, now, seven qualifiers had already appeared in just a little more than ten hours. This speed was simply astonishing.

Moreover, the fact that seven people had already qualified meant only three slots left to enter the Ancient River’s Heart.

While Shi Feng was in a daze, the sound of a system notification suddenly entered his ears.
