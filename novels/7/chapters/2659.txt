Chapter 2660 – Legendary Name

When Shi Feng pushed back the hood of his Black Cloak, a deathly silence filled his surroundings. If not for the mantle of his cloak swaying with the breeze, one would think that time had stopped.

“He’s actually...the real Black Flame?!”

Crazed Bull’s eyes nearly fell out of their sockets as he goggled at Shi Feng, his body shuddering involuntarily at this discovery.

Black Flame!

This was a name that every superpower on the continent knew.

Black Flame was an existence that had pulled off numerous miracles in battle, one that even the superpowers had great difficulty dealing with. In the hearts of independent players, he was akin to a living legend.

Although Black Flame had disappeared from the eastern continent for some time now, just his prestige alone had allowed Zero Wing to continue rapidly developing on the eastern continent unharassed. Even an overbearing superpower like Saint’s Hand did not dare mess around with Zero Wing and only quietly watched as the Faux Saint monsters chipped away at Zero Wing’s forces. Saint’s Hand did not dare directly target any of Zero Wing’s Guild Towns or Cities.

Moreover, because of Black Flame’s name, no superpower, aside from a few like Starlink, dared to hinder Zero Wing economically.

“He’s back... He’s finally back...”

Purple Eye could not help her excitement when she saw Shi Feng’s face. At the same time, though, an indescribable bitterness also filled her heart. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Although the gap between the Star Alliance and Zero Wing had been widening all this time, Purple Eye had never given up on improving herself. She still hoped to surpass Aqua Rose and Gentle Snow one day and develop the Star Alliance into a superpower as well.

However, against Saint’s Hand, her power had proven utterly insignificant. In the end, she could only watch as the Star Alliance’s main headquarters in Star-Moon Kingdom fell. In fact, she couldn’t even adequately stop the Faux Saint monsters’ ambushes.

Meanwhile, after a moment of silence, the various superpowers’ spectating members, as well as Saint’s Hand’s members, burst into laughter.

“Black Flame? Zero Wing’s Guild Leader?”

“So what if he returns now?”

“He’s been gone from the eastern continent for so long. Does he really think the continent is the same as before?”

They were indeed very surprised by Shi Feng’s appearance. However, that was it, nothing more. After all, Shi Feng had disappeared from the eastern continent for far too long. He simply didn’t know the situation the eastern continent was currently in.

“So, you’re Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame. No wonder you could shatter that five-man Combination Skill,” Thousand Eyes said, applauding as he looked at Shi Feng. In the next moment, though, he sneered, “But so what if you’ve returned? Now that the Faux Saint army has already given birth to a Mythic ranked Faux Saint Devourer, many more of its kind will be appearing in the future. Nobody can stop the Faux Saint army now. Do you think you can change things just because you’ve returned?”

He was familiar with the name of Black Flame. This was a monster that his Guild Leader had warned him to be careful of.

If it were a few days ago, he would indeed be terrified of Shi Feng. Now, however, let alone fearing Shi Feng, he didn’t even consider the Swordsman a threat.

“Boss, why are we wasting words with him? Since he is Black Flame, we should let this old bastard know that he is already obsolete! This is no longer his era!” urged Irontooth, formerly the Chief Shield Warrior of the Purple Thorns Kingdom’s number one Guild, Sin Realm, with a playful smirk on his face.

He had always wanted to destroy the Guild known as Zero Wing. Unfortunately, back then, Sin Realm was no match for Zero Wing at all. Now that he had joined Saint’s Hand, however, he understood that Zero Wing wasn’t a threat at all. Instead, it was merely a small stepping stone toward Saint’s Hand’s domination of the entire eastern continent.

“I guess you’re right.” Thousand Eyes nodded in response to Irontooth’s words. He then looked at Shi Feng and said calmly, “Since you are Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, then I’ll make an exception today and show you Saint’s Hand’s true power!”

After saying so, Thousand Eyes glanced at Irontooth, who stood beside him.

At this hint, Irontooth excitedly approached the Faux Saint Devourer, which was behind a twofold magic array.

“What is he trying to do?” The excited look on Irontooth’s face gave Purple Eye an inkling that something was amiss.

“It’s nothing much. He’s just going to show you people what the power of the new era is like!” Thousand Eyes said, a smirk appearing on his face as he looked at Purple Eye.

As Thousand Eyes said that, Irontooth took out a silvery-white crystal from his bag and started chanting an incantation.

Suddenly, the Faux Saint Devourer let loose a roar before its body burst into countless particles of silvery-white light. These particles then merged with Irontooth’s body.

In the next moment, Irontooth transformed into a six-meter-tall giant clad in silver armor, the aura he radiated much stronger than even that of the Faux Saint Devourer.

“This... How is this possible...”

Everyone present was stunned by this scene. They never imagined that players could obtain the strength of Faux Saint monsters. Moreover, it was obvious from the eyes of the armored giant that it was Irontooth. Only, Irontooth was currently much stronger than even the Faux Saint Devourer.

Previously, although the Faux Saint Devourer possessed an incredible learning ability, its combat standard wasn’t very high. It wasn’t capable of exhibiting its full strength.

However, now that Irontooth had gained control of this strength, the combat power he could exhibit would far exceed that of the Faux Saint Devourer.

“Amazing! Truly amazing! So, this is the strength of a Mythic ranked Faux Saint monster?” Irontooth was ecstatic when he sensed the power he currently wielded.

At this moment, the other Saint’s Hand members present could not help envying Irontooth.

In front of such strength, players were nothing!

If they could have such strength as well, they could single-handedly annihilate an entire army of players. They wouldn’t even have to fear Tier 4 NPCs!

...

Meanwhile, the various superpowers’ spectating members gaped in shock at the transformed Irontooth. They hadn’t suspected that Saint’s Hand had kept such a powerful trump card hidden all this time.

“This is bad! Although Irontooth is only in the Flowing Water Realm, with the Faux Saint Devourer’s strength, let alone Black Flame, even Silverwing Town’s Tier 4 Personal Guard might not be a match for him!” Illusory Words’s complexion darkened as she took in the armored giant displayed on the Magic Mirror.

Originally, Shi Feng’s appearance should have been a joyous matter. With the combat power he possessed, he would be of great help in the current situation.

However, Illusory Words had never imagined that Saint’s Hand would have such a trump card.

The strength Irontooth now wielded simply wasn’t something current players could hope to go up against. And if Shi Feng got killed at this point, his death would deal an unprecedented blow to both Zero Wing and Star-Moon Kingdom.

...

Meanwhile, after Irontooth experienced his newfound strength for a short moment, he turned around and stepped forward, instantly appearing before Shi Feng. He was so fast that even Purple Eye failed to react to his movements in time.

“Black Flame, weren’t you very powerful? Weren’t you Star-Moon Kingdom’s legendary figure? Weren’t you thinking of stopping Saint’s Hand? I wonder how you feel about the situation now,” Irontooth jeered as he looked down at Shi Feng.

Upon seeing Irontooth suddenly appear before Shi Feng, the expressions of the patrol army’s members turned indescribably grim. Even Purple Eye could not help panicking.

Irontooth was simply too fast!

By the time she sensed Irontooth moving, the latter had already appeared before Shi Feng. She simply did not dare imagine what would happen when Irontooth actually took action.

However, despite Irontooth appearing before him without any warning, Shi Feng’s expression remained ineffably calm.

“This move of yours is indeed amazing,” Shi Feng said as he shot a glance at Thousand Eyes. “However, do you think you’re the only ones that can transform into a monster?”

“What do you mean?” Thousand Eyes had a vague feeling that something was wrong when he saw how calm Shi Feng was.

However, before Thousand Eyes could say anything more, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade and chanted an incantation.
