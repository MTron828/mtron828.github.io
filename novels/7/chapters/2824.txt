Chapter 2825 – All-encompassing Seal

“A thousand Mythic Faux Saint monsters got done in, just like that?”

When Unyielding Heart and the others standing on the Mobile Fortress’s walls looked at the Faux Saint Saboteurs scattered on the ground and saw that these Mythic monsters had less than one-third of their HPs remaining, they couldn’t help gaping in shock. They had all anticipated a bitter fight. They had even prepared themselves to fight day and night and suffer innumerable casualties. After all, the Faux Saint monsters possessed above-average combat standards and cunning minds. Their ability to learn and improve on combat techniques also made them increasingly tougher to fight as the battle went on. Moreover, their high HPs meant these Faux Saint monsters could stay in battle for long periods. However, with just two rounds of attacks, the Mobile Fortress had heavily injured the 1,000 Mythic ranked Faux Saint Saboteurs and killed several hundred thousand lower-ranked Faux Saint monsters.

This wasn’t a battle but a one-sided massacre.

“No wonder he never paid any attention to the various superpowers from the very beginning. With this Mobile Fortress, even the Five Great Super Guilds would be helpless against the present Zero Wing.” Unyielding Heart smiled bitterly when he looked at the land of death below the fortress. Whether it was Starlink or Hundred Ghosts, neither of them mattered in front of the Mobile Fortress.

Meanwhile, atop the Fortress Lord’s Mansion, Shi Feng’s heart ached once more.

Activating all eight Magic Charging Towers had cost him 160,000 Magic Crystals. At this stage of the game, even first-rate Guilds would have 400,000 Magic Crystals, at most, in their stockpile. He had burned through nearly half of a first-rate Guild’s Magic Crystal stockpile in just one round of attacks.

On the other hand, outside the Mobile Fortress, Hundred Ghosts’s members, Lu Xingluo, and Beast Emperor all remained silent for a long time upon seeing the Magic Charging Towers’ attacks. Beast Emperor was especially shocked by this outcome. Originally, he thought that with his army of a million Faux Saint monsters, he could trample over the entire Twin Towers Kingdom, that nobody short of the kingdom’s NPC army would be a match for his army.

Yet, now... As for Hundred Ghosts’s members, they also felt pressured by this outcome. After all, the Mythic ranked Faux Saint Saboteurs had survived the Mobile Fortress’s attacks due only to their high HP. If players like themselves were to suffer a hit from one of these attacks, they would die without question.

At this time, Jade Leaf turned to Windshadow and said, “Elder Windshadow, this Mobile Fortress is too powerful. If we charge in blindly... I’m afraid our chances are slim...” In air combat, the Ancient Demonic Serpent was indeed powerful. It could even go up against a handful of Faux Saint Saboteurs simultaneously and still hold the upper hand. However, even if the Ancient Demonic Serpent could survive the Mobile Fortress’s heaven-defying blow, they, the Flying Mount’s passengers, would most definitely be reduced to ashes. Not to mention, despite the mutually destructive blow, the Mobile Fortress’s defensive barrier remained intact. Such being the case, even the Ancient Demonic Serpent’s strongest blow would only exhaust some of the barrier’s energy reserves.

After hesitating for some time, Windshadow announced, “We’re retreating!” The Ancient Demonic Serpent was a Tier 4 Legendary Flying Mount. Its strongest blow touched upon the threshold of Tier 5-an attack that even an Advanced Guild City’s defensive magic array couldn’t withstand.

Originally, Windshadow believed that, while the Mobile Fortress’s defensive magic array might be strong, destroying it shouldn’t be a problem for the Ancient Demonic Serpent, given enough time. However, let alone destroying the barrier, just surviving that purifying light would be a problem. Since it was evident they couldn’t do anything against the Mobile Fortress, they naturally had no reason to remain here. At this time, Windshadow wasn’t the only person with such thoughts. Beast Emperor similarly commanded his Faux Saint army to retreat immediately.

After ordering a retreat, Beast Emperor looked at Lu Xingluo and said, “Let’s go. There’s no point in staying here anymore.” Trying to clash with the Mobile Fortress now was simply suicidal. Their only choice was to retreat and figure out other options to deal with the fortress. Securing the Secret Covenant Tower was also no longer possible. So long as the Mobile Fortress remained in the tower’s vicinity, they couldn’t do anything about the tower. “Lord Beast Emperor, don’t you have any way at all? I’ve bet everything on you!” Lu Xingluo said, looking at Beast Emperor with crazed eyes. Starlink had suffered a massive blow from the battle in Sky Spring City. He would be finished if he failed to secure the Secret Covenant Tower as well.

“Xingluo, you might not be able to return to Starlink, but with the Starline Corporation’s financial strength, you can still follow me,” Beast Emperor consoled. “You’ve seen for yourself how quickly the Faux Saint army expands. It will only grow stronger from now on. Even that old undead backing you won’t be able to go up against the Faux Saint army in the future.

“As for Zero Wing, I will eventually erase its existence from God’s Domain!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Beast Emperor mentioned the name Zero Wing, his voice grew cold.

If not for Zero Wing’s interference, his army would’ve long since trampled over Star-Moon Kingdom and the Black Dragon Empire. He wouldn’t have had to resort to creating Saint’s Hand, an organization filled with cunning opportunists, to help him. As for the losses he suffered this time, he didn’t place much importance on them. After all, for his current self, Faux Saint monsters below Mythic rank were incredibly easy to produce. As for the Mythic ranked Faux Saint Saboteurs, while they were severely weakened right now, if they focused on fleeing, nobody could stop them. Zero Wing would be able to kill only a few of them at most. In addition, after today’s event, he finally understood the reason for Zero Wing’s confidence. Now, all he needed to do was wait.

He would wait until he produced a Tier 5 Faux Saint monster! So long as a Tier 5 Faux Saint monster appeared, let alone Zero Wing’s Mobile Fortress, even God’s Domain’s various kingdoms and empires would no longer pose a threat to him.

However, producing a Tier 5 Faux Saint monster wasn’t an easy task. It required a large number of Tier 4 Faux Saint monsters to serve as a base, as well as a large amount of resources. Only after fulfilling these two conditions could he produce a Tier 5 Faux Saint monster. Meanwhile, Lu Xingluo, the heir of the Starline Corporation, was the perfect cash cow to help him fulfill these requirements.

After hearing Beast Emperor’s words, Lu Xingluo could only nod in frustration, throwing in his lot with Beast Emperor. From today onward, he would stand against the players of God’s Domain and acquire the Upper Zone resources he needed from Beast Emperor.

This was also Lu Xingluo’s only option. Otherwise, let alone the position of Starlink’s Guild Leader, he might even get replaced as the Starline Corporation’s heir. After all, there were still several reserve heirs in the corporation eagerly waiting to supplant him.

Upon seeing the distant Darkfire Crow and Ancient Demonic Serpent turning around and leaving, Fire Dance smiled and said, “Guild Leader, it seems they plan to retreat.”

She found their enemy’s decision to retreat reasonable. After all, anyone would lose the will to fight after witnessing that devastating blow. Unfortunately, they couldn’t deal any additional damage to the Faux Saint army. Although the Mobile Fortress possessed incredible offensive capabilities, it had no means to seal its opponents in place. It would also be foolish to leave the safety of the fortress to pursue the Faux Saint monsters. This was most likely what Lu Xingluo and the others hoped to see the most. “Leave? Since they’re already here, then they shouldn’t think of leaving!” Shi Feng smiled when he saw the retreating figures of Beast Emperor and Hundred Ghosts’s members. He then took out 3,000 Mana Stones he had synthesized beforehand and injected them into the core of the unsealed World Mirror.

An invisible ripple of energy immediately spread rapidly from the Mobile Fortress to the surroundings. A moment later, a dense layer of mist formed around the edges of the map of the Secret Covenant Tower. If one looked at the map from the outside, the inside of the map would appear illusory, like it was completely isolated from the outside world.
