Chapter 2874 - Descending upon Ancient Rock City

Orc Empire, Ancient Rock City: The walls of Ancient Rock City were over 50 meters tall. Despite numerous Faux Saint monsters roaming the barren land outside the city walls, the Tier 3 players patrolling atop the walls completely disregarded these monsters as if they did not exist.

Surprisingly, the Faux Saint monsters that most of the eastern continent’s players regarded as a nightmare showed no intentions of attacking Ancient Rock City. They behaved like scarecrows under the city walls.

At this time, a merchant caravan, composed of over a hundred players and over a dozen horse-drawn carriages, slowly approached Ancient Rock City from a distance. Despite catching sight of these players, the countless Faux Saint monsters roaming the barren land outside Ancient Rock City behaved as if they did not see this caravan.

Looking at the Level 120 Faux Saint monsters around him, a Level 136, Tier 3 Swordsman escorting the caravan exclaimed, “The Sacred Heart Amulet Saint’s Hand sold us is amazing. Those Mythic Faux Saint monsters ignore us even when we’re only 30 yards away from them.”

Even NPCs were helpless against the Faux Saint monsters running rampant in the many neighboring kingdoms and the Black Dragon Empire. The danger made it increasingly difficult for merchant caravans to make money.

However, so long as a caravan carried a Sacred Heart Amulet, it could avoid the Faux Saint monsters’ attacks altogether.

At the Swordsman’s words, the Level 137, Tier 3 Guardian Knight sitting at the head of the caravan looked at the Sacred Heart Amulet in his hand. With a hint of ambition in his eyes, he said, “I know, right? We must buy some more of these Sacred Heart Amulets in Ancient Rock City! We can make a fortune reselling them in the neighboring kingdoms and empires!”

The Sacred Heart Amulet was a non-bag space item. Although players could wear it on their person, they couldn’t store it in their bags. It also couldn’t be transported by teleportation.

However, Saint’s Hand sold the Sacred Heart Amulet only in Ancient Rock City. None of Saint’s Hand’s other Residences sold it.

Many merchant players and adventurer teams had realized that they could make a fortune by purchasing the Sacred Heart Amulets in bulk from Ancient Rock City and reselling them in the neighboring kingdoms and empires.

Nowadays, many Faux Saint monsters roamed the territories of the neighboring kingdoms and the Black Dragon Empire. Leaving the safety of towns and cities would expose players to not only the standard monsters but also a large number of Faux Saint monsters. The Sacred Heart Amulet could mitigate the danger.

More importantly, the Sacred Heart Amulet was a Consumable, so it was always in high demand in the neighboring kingdoms and the Black Dragon Empire. Selling these amulets in these countries wouldn’t be a problem.

The main reason their Fighting Tiger adventurer team had invested a considerable fortune into hiring more than a dozen Advanced Carriages was to make an even bigger fortune off these amulets.

At this time, a Level 136, Tier 3 female Ranger standing atop the leading carriage pointed at a distant silhouette and shouted, “Commander, we’re almost at Ancient Rock City!”

“Okay! Everyone, get yourselves ready, newbies especially! Ancient Rock City is different from other Guild Cities!” the leading Guardian Knight shouted through the team chat. “Although the city prohibits fighting, it is still a bona fide Dark City! There are tons of Dark Players there, so make sure not to get marked by them! Otherwise, we’ll be in a ton of trouble once we leave the city!”

At the Guardian Knight’s words, the team’s veterans promptly took out a Magic Scroll for the Tier 1 Mana Guard Spell and used it on themselves. With the Mana Guard active, the common tracking mark would be ineffective against them.

Upon seeing this, the newbies to Ancient Rock City also took out the Magic Scrolls they prepared and used the scrolls on themselves.

As the caravan trundled increasingly closer to Ancient Rock City, the newbies couldn’t help gasping in shock at their first sight of the towering stronghold.

Ancient Rock City was undoubtedly the most spectacular Guild City they had ever seen in their careers in God’s Domain. Not only did the city have walls over 50 meters tall guarding it, but it covered an area rivaling NPC Main Cities.

Most importantly, two 30-meter-tall Faux Saint monsters flanked the city’s entrance. The two monsters wore steel plate armor, and each carried two gigantic swords.

If one inspected these two monsters with an Identification Skill, one would find that they were Level 160 Superior Mythic ranked Faux Saint Slayers!

The aura of these two Faux Saint Slayers sent involuntary shudders through all the players entering Ancient Rock City. Just by standing there, the two Superior Mythics made everyone feel as if their souls would get devoured.

Besides the two Faux Saint Slayers standing guard, more than 30 Evil Dark Dragons wheeled in the sky above Ancient Rock City. These 50-meter-long Evil Dark Dragons radiated auras close to rivaling the Superior Mythic ranked Faux Saint Slayers’. When the Fighting Tiger adventurer team arrived before the city gate, the members spotted a long line of players and NPCs waiting to enter the city.

Many of these NPCs exuded dense bloodlust, which proved that they roamed the dark side of God’s Domain. At this time, however, even Tier 4 NPCs were obediently waiting in line.

“Amazing! There are so many Tier 4 monsters and NPCs here! Even a kingdom’s capital city isn’t comparable to this place!” the first-time visitors among Fighting Tiger exclaimed.

“Of course. Ancient Rock City is Saint’s Hand’s main headquarters. Moreover, the city has already become a mecca for the dark forces operating in the neighboring kingdoms and the Black Dragon Empire. If we include the city’s defensive structures, even the Outerworld forces will have difficulty taking down Ancient Rock City. Now, many well-known and top adventurer teams are developing here,” the leading Guardian Knight explained. “From what I heard, the superpower Miracle has also dispatched many experts to garrison Ancient Rock City. Ancient Rock City is the safest city in the Orc Empire! Nobody will dare target it!”

The Saint’s Hand member conducting inspections nearby overheard the Guardian Knight’s words and couldn’t help putting on a prideful expression.

Currently, Ancient Rock City was only one step away from becoming a Main City. Its combat power far exceeded that of Guild Cities of the various superpowers. Had Saint’s Hand not been wary of the Outerworld’s NPC forces, it would’ve long since flattened the neighboring kingdoms and the Black Dragon Empire, becoming an existence surpassing the Five Great Super Guilds.

However, as the Fighting Tiger adventurer team was undergoing inspection, a gigantic figure suddenly approached Ancient Rock City from the distant sky. Its speed was as fast as a mighty gale, and it stopped only after arriving in front of the city. The steel behemoth over 100 meters long hung in the sky roughly 400 yards from Ancient Rock City, overlooking the entire city. Several dozen players stood on this steel behemoth.

At this steel behemoth’s appearance, the entire Ancient Rock City went into an uproar.

“It’s the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship!” “That’s Zero Wing’s Flying Ship!” “Quick, look! Isn’t that Black Flame?!”

Nowadays, almost everybody in God’s Domain was familiar with the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. After all, this thing had long since become Zero Wing’s signature. Zero Wing was even using some of these Flying Ships to transport cargo across the sea, to the envy of many superpowers. However, Zero Wing’s sudden visit to Ancient Rock City confused many of the city’s players. Meanwhile, upon spotting the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, the Evil Dark Dragons patrolling the city’s airspace let loose deafening roars. The two Faux Saint Slayers standing guard by the city’s entrance also raised their heads and gripped their weapons, going on full alert against the Flying Ship.

As everyone in Ancient Rock City fell into panic and confusion, Shi Feng looked down at the city below from aboard the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship and shouted, “Five minutes! I will give you five minutes to withdraw from the city if you do not wish to get dragged into Saint’s Hand’s problem!

“Anyone who doesn’t withdraw after five minutes will disappear from God’s Domain together with Ancient Rock City!”
