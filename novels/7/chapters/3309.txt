Chapter 384 – One-Versus-Two

Accompanied by thunder, the Thunder God’s Spear in Storm’s hand instantly flew through the sky and reached Shi Feng, its speed so fast that even Meteor and the other spectating Tier 4 experts had failed to catch it.

However, at the same time as the Thunder God’s Spear arrived before Shi Feng, the flow of time seemingly slowed down. Moreover, this phenomenon wasn’t limited to just Shi Feng’s vicinity. Everything within a 500-yard radius had seemingly entered a state of stagnation. The descent of the falling leaves had slowed to a halt, and the dirt raised from the ground stayed suspended in the air.

At this moment, Shi Feng, the epicenter of this strange phenomenon, appeared to be the only existence unaffected.

Subsequently, Shi Feng could be seen unsheathing the Winter of Eternal Night and executing a simple strike against the Thunder God’s Spear, forcibly altering its trajectory. Ultimately, the Thunder God’s Spear failed to hit Shi Feng, only brushing past Shi Feng’s shoulder and flattening a distant mountain.

!!

How can a Tier 4 player possibly deflect that kind of attack? Meteor was greatly shocked as he looked at the flattened mountain. After all, going by the destruction caused, Storm’s Thunder God’s Spear was already close to rivaling a Tier 6 player’s attack.

What did he do?

Saint Arm was similarly surprised by this turn of events. He knew very clearly how powerful the attack was. Now that Storm had reached Tier 5 already, few existences below Tier 6 should be able to stop her Thunder God’s Spear. Even if pseudo-fifth-floor experts could predict the attack’s trajectory, they wouldn’t be able to evade it, let alone deflect it.

Yet, Shi Feng had accomplished this feat. Through some unknown means, Shi Feng drastically slowed down the flow of time around him, causing the Thunder God’s Spear to lose much of its speed, which, in turn, allowed him to deflect the attack. This was the first time Saint Arm had seen such a phenomenon, and he couldn’t help but find it unbelievable. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As expected of Thunderstorm. I might have gotten killed if I hadn’t promptly upgraded the Winter of Eternal Night to the Legendary rank, Shi Feng thought, feeling a little surprised as he looked at the vibrating Winter of Eternal Night. It might seem like he had deflected the Thunder God’s Spear with little effort to everyone, but Shi Feng knew just how close to death he was just now.

The elven woman named Thunderstorm was one of the Paimon Conglomerate’s iconic figures. She might not be on the level of the Three Overlords, but she was still a top-tier presence in the Seven Luminaries A-League.

Thunderstorm was especially known for her mastery over the lightning element. Rather than an Elementalist, it’d be more appropriate to describe her as a War Goddess of Thunder. Her attacks were often so fast that her opponents would get killed before they could even react.

Although Thunderstorm had yet to reach Tier 6, her current strength was already plenty terrifying. If not for the Winter of Eternal Night having the hidden ability to freeze all things, Shi Feng would have definitely failed to react to Thunderstorm’s attack just now.

After all, Shi Feng was still only a Tier 4 player, while his opponent was a Tier 5 player equipped with a six-piece Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set and one piece of Legendary Equipment. Even if he had a Legendary Weapon and Tier 5 Physique, winning against an expert like Thunderstorm would still be impossible.

“Die!”

Not giving Shi Feng any time to rest, Saint Arm suddenly appeared in front of Shi Feng, wielding two massive shields. Then, he smashed both shields down at Shi Feng, his hulking frame making it look like a house was crashing down on Shi Feng.

However, Saint Arm wasn’t just attacking Shi Feng with a straightforward shield bash. During his attack, Saint Arm also executed a rapid footwork, instantly creating over 20 realistic afterimages around Shi Feng, his speed so fast he could put Tier 5 Assassins to shame.

Earthen Dance?

Shi Feng remained unfazed when he saw Saint Arm’s realistic afterimages. Instead, he calmly activated World of Frost, causing the flow of time around him to stagnate even more and creating nine frost swords around him.

Ninefold Sword’s Orbit!

Immediately, Shi Feng brandished the nine frost swords, creating a field of stars that rapidly orbited him in a 50-yard radius. He did not dare to underestimate Saint Arm in the slightest.

Saint Arm was of the Giant race, one of the few races with the Titan Bloodline. At the same time, he also had the Time Guardian class, which was considered a Lost Class in God’s Domain.

Unlike the Winter of Eternal Night, which manipulated time by freezing it, Saint Arm could manipulate time itself. Using this ability, he could accelerate his movements to a significant degree and maintain that accelerated speed throughout entire fights. Meanwhile, as a Tier 5 Time Guardian, Saint Arm could increase his speed by a maximum of 300%.(100% + 300%)

Of course, this powerful ability wasn’t without its flaws. Although Time Guardians could increase their Movement Speed and Attack Speed to extraordinary extents, their reaction speeds would remain unchanged. So, if a Time Guardian’s neural reactions couldn’t keep up with their movements, they would only worsen their combat performance if they accelerated themselves too much.

In Saint Arm’s case, he could only afford to increase his speed by 200%.

Subsequently, the countless stars formed around Shi Feng started striking Saint Arm’s twin shields one after another, each collision pushing Saint Arm back a little. In no time at all, Saint Arm was pushed out of the field of stars, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get within 50 yards of Shi Feng.

Dammit! Is he really just a Tier 4 Sword Emperor?! Saint Arm gnashed his teeth as he looked at the countless stars that orbited Shi Feng.

Normally, Swordsmen and Assassins were Saint Arm’s favorite classes to go against. This was because both of these classes relied on speed to achieve combat superiority.

However, ever since Saint Arm class-changed from a Shield Warrior into a Time Guardian, he was able to overwhelm both classes in terms of speed, negating the advantage of both classes. On top of that, Shield Warriors were inherently superior to Swordsmen and Assassins in terms of Strength. So, he had essentially become the perfect counter to Swordsmen and Assassins.

But now, not only were Shi Feng’s frost swords overpowering him, but they were also overwhelming his reaction speed. So long as he got within 50 yards of Shi Feng, he would have to face the attacks of at least five frost swords simultaneously. In such a situation, he didn’t have any room for evasive maneuvers and could only receive the attacks with his shield…

“Keep him pinned for me, Saint Arm!” Storm suddenly said to Saint Arm through the team chat. “I refuse to believe he can withstand Thunder Realm’s Avatar!”

“Thunder Realm’s Descent? You got it!” Saint Arm promptly nodded when he heard Storm’s words.

Thunder Realm’s Descent was a combination attack Storm had developed, and it was her ultimate trump card. The attack combined Thunder Realm with a magic barrier that enhanced the Curse’s power.

In the case of Thunder Realm, it was a powerful Curse that launched many thunderbolts. Now that Storm was at Tier 5, the Curse could easily overwhelm even the reaction speeds of Tier 5 players. As for the magic barrier, it functioned to enhance the power of the individual thunderbolts launched.

Subsequently, Saint Arm began attacking Shi Feng in a frenzied manner, forcing Shi Feng to defend himself with all of his strength to prevent the Time Guardian from getting close to him. In the meantime, Storm began chanting a series of incantations and drawing magic arrays with her staff. From time to time, she would also throw a bunch of Mana Stones at certain locations.

In less than ten seconds, over 30 Grandmaster Magic Arrays had appeared in Shi Feng’s vicinity, these magic arrays linking together to form one big magic array that covered a 1,000-yard radius.

“Amazing! She used less than ten seconds to create a Grandmaster Barrier!” Trecht exclaimed as he looked at the barrier before him.

The construction of magic barriers was complicated and time-consuming. Normally, Magicians would prepare magic barriers in advance using magic scrolls. That way, they simply needed to use the scrolls whenever they needed to use a magic barrier.

Of course, there was also a problem in doing so—barriers formed using magic scrolls would have weaker-than-average power. This was because mana needed to be supplied to the magic scrolls beforehand, and this stored mana would wear away with time. Moreover, due to the limitations of the materials used to create magic scrolls, only a limited amount of mana could be stored in them. Normally, a magic barrier constructed using magic scrolls would be fortunate to exhibit half of the power of the real deal.

But because it didn’t take much time to construct a magic barrier using magic scrolls, such barriers were much more practical in actual battles. Hence, hardly anyone in the Greater God’s Domain would attempt to construct a magic barrier from scratch in the middle of a battle.

Yet, Storm had used less than ten seconds to construct a Grandmaster Barrier. The level of skill she possessed was simply astounding.

When Storm saw that her magic barrier was active, she promptly waved her staff and shouted, “Thunder Realm!”
