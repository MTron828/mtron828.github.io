Chapter 253 – Tier 3 Instructor

Inside the isolated room the size of a football field, the nine other people in the room began scrutinizing Shi Feng as soon as they heard Breeze Wine’s words.

“He is the last person?”

Everyone grew confused after they were done scrutinizing Shi Feng.

Logically, anyone capable of getting into this room shouldn’t be a nameless nobody in God’s Domain. However, aside from Purple Jade, nobody else managed to recognize Shi Feng. To further their confusion, Shi Feng had an inconspicuous appearance and did not have any presence whatsoever.

“Did our God’s Domain have such an expert?” Fithalia quietly asked the others around her as she looked at Shi Feng strangely.

Shaking her head, Alice said, “I’ve seen every known Tier 6 God-ranked expert in our God’s Domain. He shouldn’t be any of the God-ranked experts we know.”

Prosciutto and the others weren’t surprised when they heard Alice’s statement.

Aside from the Tier 6 God-ranked experts that had abruptly disappeared, every God-ranked expert in their God’s Domain had met each other in the real world at least once or twice. In fact, one could easily find the real-life information of all known Tier 6 God-ranked experts on the internet nowadays.

However, Shi Feng definitely wasn’t any of these known God-ranked experts.

“I know him,” Purple Jade said. “His name is Shi Feng. He isn’t a God-ranked expert but an instructor of a God’s Domain Academy instead. He was a Level 200, Tier 3 Sword King at his peak. He used to be the Guild Leader of the second-rate Guild Shadow, but he was dismissed from Shadow and is currently the Acting Guild Leader of Zero Wing.”

Purple Jade had paid close attention to Wu Lingling ever since the latter had won against her disciple Lei Li. Hence, she naturally looked into Wu Lingling’s instructor as well.

In Purple Jade’s opinion, Wu Lingling possessed an extraordinarily sturdy foundation, and watching the girl carry herself felt like watching an old monster who had trained for many years. So, it wasn’t hard to imagine that the person responsible for teaching Wu Lingling possessed incredible knowledge and control over the human body. Even a God-ranked expert couldn’t necessarily produce a student of Wu Lingling’s caliber.

Only, the result Purple Jade got from investigating Shi Feng was disappointing.

Shi Feng was the Acting Guild Leader of Zero Wing, while Zero Wing’s true Guild Leader was Black Flame, a God-ranked expert from a different God’s Domain. After connecting the dots, it was obvious that Shi Feng must have handed Wu Lingling a special training method that he had received from Black Flame. There was also no way Shi Feng could be responsible for teaching Wu Lingling since Shi Feng was barely a Refinement Realm expert.

Hence, when Purple Jade saw Shi Feng appearing in the room and learned that he would be heading to the Greater World with their group, she couldn’t help but be surprised.

The Greater World was a very dangerous place. Even someone as strong as Breeze Wine had only recently managed to secure himself a foothold in the Greater World. Yet, a Refinement Realm expert like Shi Feng was planning on heading to the Greater World.

“Zero Wing?”

When Thousand Scars, who wore a white dress, heard Purple Jade’s introduction, the gaze she used to look at Shi Feng immediately turned cold. Although she had no personal grudges against Shi Feng, Zero Wing was the Flower of Seven Sins’ sworn enemy. The Flower of Seven Sins had even suffered severe losses recently because of Zero Wing.

Originally, Thousand Scars had planned on challenging Zero Wing’s Guild Leader Black Flame after the recent improvements she had made. That way, she could reduce Zero Wing’s momentum to a certain extent. However, because she needed to enter the Greater World and focus on becoming a core genius of the Paimon Corporation as soon as possible, she had no choice but to give up on challenging Black Flame.

Now that she had come across Zero Wing’s Acting Guild Leader, she wouldn’t mind taking care of him if the opportunity arose.

“Alright, that’s enough talking. All of you put on the quantum watch assigned to you and follow me inside,” Breeze Wine interrupted and pointed at the translucent glass door standing in the middle of the room. “If you don’t wish to listen to me now, you don’t have to listen to me once we reach the Greater World, either.”

Breeze Wine was the First Commander of the legendary Midnight Tea Party. Even though most of the people he was currently dealing with were God-ranked experts, he did not bother being courteous with them. Moreover, he had already proven his strength by securing himself a foothold in the Greater World without external help. So, Thousand Scars quickly dismissed her thoughts and followed Breeze Wine’s command.

In no time, everyone in the room had put on the quantum watches they had received from the Green God Corporation. Then, they followed Breeze Wine through the glass door and seemingly arrived in outer space.

Upon arriving in this space, everyone immediately took notice of the giant planet before them. The planet was thousands of times larger than the Sun, and countless continents orbited around the planet. These orbiting continents were of varying sizes, with the smaller ones being several times larger than Earth and the larger ones being hundreds of times larger. These continents were like arks that traveled the universe. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A moment later, everyone felt themselves being drawn toward a continent that was roughly three times the size of Earth.

The density of the continent’s air was less than 1% that of Earth, and its gravity was three times that of Earth. Many barriers could also be seen scattered across this continent, and many high-rise buildings and human beings could be seen within these barriers.

After another ten seconds, everyone arrived inside one of the many barriers, and the sight of a prosperous and sci-fi-like city entered their eyes.

“All of you are very fortunate. Thanks to the Green God Corporation’s many years of effort, you get to be assigned to a third-tier city and receive citizenship as soon as you arrive in the Greater World. You also get to enjoy a long lifespan and youth that cannot be achieved even in the Upper Zones of our world. In comparison, people from other Elementary Worlds can only start in third- to first-tier towns and rely on mining and collecting various cosmic resources to make a living,” Breeze Wine said as he turned around to look at everyone. Then, a smile appeared on his face as he continued, “But I also have bad news to tell you. Do you want to hear it?”
