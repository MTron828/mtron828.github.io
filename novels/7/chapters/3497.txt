Chapter 572 – Mythical Era’s Mana

Before Shi Feng and Billowing Water could recover from the initial shock of experiencing the Western Continent’s environment, hundreds of players suddenly swarmed them from all corners of the street. Each and every one of them resembled starving dogs that had just spotted two juicy pieces of meat.

“It’s been so long since we’ve had any new Superior Demigods! And this time, we got two!”

“Friends, how about joining our Falcon Party? I guarantee you’ll earn a hundred contribution points per excursion! At that rate, you can exchange for a Mana Purification Technique in just three days!”

“Come to our Rainstorm Party instead! We can help you obtain Bronze Purification Techniques, if not even Basic ones!”

“You folks from Rainstorm sure love to boast. A Bronze Purification Technique? Not a single person in your party has managed to learn one yet! Friends, join our Half-Leaf Party instead! Our party leader is an expert who has already mastered a Bronze Purification Technique. We earn far more contribution points than the other parties!”

The town’s players shouted offers to Shi Feng and Billowing Water, one after another, without giving them any time to react.

Mana Purification Techniques??Shi Feng was greatly surprised by the offers everyone made.

He had only learned how to improve his mana after accepting the Primordial Abyssal God’s Legacy. However, it was an incomplete technique that provided him with limited improvements.

Judging by the strength of the surrounding players’ mana and the superior Mana Purification Techniques they spoke of, it was evident that their techniques surpassed his incomplete one.

Logically, the strength of his mana should rank number one among players of the same tier because of the Tier 5 Legendary Mana Body he created. Even if there were some Tier 5 players with stronger mana, the gap between them shouldn’t be significant.

However, the Tier 5 players around him possessed significantly stronger mana than him. Some even had mana rivaling Tier 6 Gods, which was simply unbelievable.

If he could bring a large number of these so-called Mana Purification Techniques back with him or establish a long-term supply chain, it would undoubtedly lead to qualitative transformations in the overall strength of Zero Wing’s members.

Seven Luminaries Town, Seven Luminaries Bar:

After listening to the fervent invitations from various parties in the town, Shi Feng and Billowing Water chose to engage in further negotiations with a female elf named Moon Bamboo, who was a Guardian Knight and had mastered a Bronze Mana Purification Technique.

“How about it? Will you join us, friends? While Dawnlight might not be among the top five parties in town, we are solidly ranked in the top ten,” Moon Bamboo explained to Shi Feng and Billowing Water. After elegantly taking a sip of coffee, she continued, “We currently need two more members to complete our party. If you join Dawnlight, you’ll enjoy two major benefits that most other parties can’t offer.

“Firstly, you won’t have to worry about acquiring a Bronze Purification Technique. The party leader and I have already mastered one each, while the other two members have acquired their own; they just need to learn how to use them. So, if we obtain more Bronze Purification Techniques in the future, you two will receive your share right away.

“Additionally, once the other two members succeed in learning their Bronze Purification Techniques, Dawnlight will have four members who have mastered the technique. At that time, our party won’t have to fear encountering teams composed of monstrous Tier 5 experts from the Holy Race. As a side note, both the party leader and I have mastered two Gold Combat Techniques each.

“Secondly, you’ll save on accommodation fees. Normally, you would have to spend one Eternal Gold per day for accommodation in the town. However, our party has used contribution points to rent a six-person hotel suite for a month. We still have more than ten days left, so you won’t have to spend anything on accommodation during this period.”

While Moon Bamboo explained the benefits of joining the Dawnlight Party to Shi Feng and Billowing Water, a tall and muscular man, a Tier 5 Summoner, walked over to the table and unceremoniously sat down next to her.

“Bamboo, you’ve been negotiating with these youngsters for half an hour, and you still haven’t won them over? I thought you’d be more capable with that beauty and ‘big sister energy’ of yours,” the male Summoner said, sighing and shaking his head.

“I’m recruiting two Superior Demigods at the same time. Why don’t you give it a try, Mr. Party Leader?” Moon Bamboo said, rolling her eyes at the male Summoner.

There were very few players operating in Seven Luminaries Town, and the majority of them were members of the various pseudo-apex powers. Players from other powers constituted less than 10% of the town’s population.

It should be known that human players who died on the Western Continent would be sent back to the Eternal Continent with 100% certainty. If they wished to return to the Western Continent, they would have to pay an additional 150 Eternal Gold for the teleportation fee. Such an expenditure was exorbitant, even for the various pseudo-apex powers. Unless they had made significant contributions to their Guilds on the Western Continent, they would have to pay out of their own pockets.

Hence, it became very difficult for non-pseudo-apex power parties to recruit new members. After all, newcomers had plenty of parties to choose from, so they would naturally compare their options.

“My name is Sky Pivot, and I am the party leader of Dawnlight,” the male Summoner introduced himself to Shi Feng and Billowing Water with a smile. “Our party is planning to explore the Plain of Fallen Gods, a Level 160 to Level 180 map, soon. Rumor has it that the map drops treasures that can help with our Tier 6 promotion. As the party leader, I can exercise my authority to allow you to have first pick of one of the items we obtain during the expedition. If we acquire additional Mana Purification Techniques, I will also give them to you for free, so you won’t need to invoke your privilege for them. What do you think, friends?”

When Sky Pivot finished speaking, Moon Bamboo couldn’t help but look at him in shock.

Every party was currently preparing to tackle the Plain of Fallen Gods in order to achieve Tier 6 promotion as quickly as possible. After all, this would give them an advantage over the other parties in town and give them a head start in exploring the Primordial Demon’s Necropolis, a World Mode Regional Dungeon rumored to drop Advanced Bronze and possibly even Silver Mana Purification Techniques.

If they were to let the two newcomers have the promotion treasure first, it would likely impact their later exploration of the Primordial Demon’s Necropolis.

“If that’s the case, I would like to join your party,” Shi Feng said after considering his options.

His primary goal was to reach Tier 6. As for the World Fragment, obtaining it relied entirely on luck. Rather than blindly searching for a World Fragment, he would be better off securing a Mana Purification Technique first and learning more about the Western Continent. This way, even if he were to operate solo in the future, he would have a better chance of surviving and achieving his goals.

“I’m fine with it, too,” Billowing Water said, nodding. The promotion treasure and Mana Purification Technique also tempted her.

“Great! Then it’s settled! We’ll set off tomorrow!” Sky Pivot exclaimed, laughing heartily.

Following that, Shi Feng and Billowing Water raised their cups to celebrate their joining the Dawnlight Party. After enjoying a delicious meal at the bar, they rested in the hotel until dawn. At the break of dawn, under Sky Pivot’s urging, the entire party of six set off for the Plain of Fallen Gods.
