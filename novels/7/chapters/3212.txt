Chapter 287 – Dragon Princess

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Several hundred light-blue lightning bolts bombarded Shi Feng continuously, the clash between stars and lightning bolts sending echoes of explosions spreading across the entire island.

98%… 96%… 94%…

Because Firenze held absolute control over his Spell, there was no use in trying to deflect or make use of his attacks. Shi Feng could only block the attacks, and there were no opportunities to be seized.

In the blink of an eye, Shi Feng’s HP had already fallen close to 50%. Yet, when all of the several hundred lightning bolts disappeared from the battlefield, Shi Feng remained standing in mid-air. Although he had less than 5% of his HP remaining, there was no doubt he was still alive.

He didn’t die??Meteor subconsciously gaped in shock when he saw that Shi Feng hadn’t been reduced to ashes.?Is he a monster?

Firenze was not only a Tier 5 Demon King, but he was also a Demon Monarch among the Demon race. He was as strong as a six-winged Valkyrie of the same level and tier. In a situation where he had free rein over his Tier 5 Spells, he could obliterate a medium-sized NPC City all by himself. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Yet, Shi Feng had survived one of Firenze’s Tier 5 Spells without dodging, deflecting, or manipulating. He had blocked and survived a Tier 5 Demon King’s Tier 5 Spell despite being only a Tier 4 player. If Meteor were to tell this matter to others, they would definitely call him a liar.

After all, a Tier 5 Demon King’s Tier 5 Spell was not only powerful, but it also had a very high attack frequency and attack count. It wasn’t something a Tier 4 player could resist simply by activating a Berserk Skill.

He survived even an attack like that? Could he be wielding a Legendary Weapon??Star Snail, who had caught up to Meteor, couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in confusion.

......

It wasn’t impossible for Tier 4 players to hold their ground against Tier 5 monsters. However, players typically did so by deflecting monsters’ attacks. If players were to go up against a Tier 5 monster with Absolute Control, they would need a Legendary Weapon to stand a chance.

However, Legendary Weapons required a lot of time to obtain. It was why Legendary Weapons were considerably rare even in the Greater God’s Domain. Seeing as the Miniature Ancient World had only opened up not long ago, there was no way anyone could have gotten their hands on a Legendary Weapon already.

If Shi Feng truly was in possession of a Legendary Weapon, neither she nor Meteor would be a match for him.

Any fourth-floor expert wielding a Legendary Weapon could wipe the floor with them in their current state. Even as an MT, Star Snail doubted she could last more than 30 seconds against such an opponent. Not to mention, Shi Feng was even an expert who had mastered a Saint-rank Mana Technique.

However, what Star Snail did not know was that Shi Feng was in possession of the Tier 4 Overtier Spell Demon God’s Armament, the Spell increasing the effects of all of his weapons and equipment by 100%. Not only did this Spell boost his Basic Attributes drastically, but it also allowed his Physique and reaction speed to undergo a qualitative transformation. Hence, he barely managed to keep up with Demon King Firenze’s attacks.

Of course, out of the several hundred lightning bolts, only about a hundred had managed to hit him. Otherwise, even with Demon God’s Armament’s buffs, he would still be blown into smithereens.

Meanwhile, Death Omen fell silent when she saw this outcome from a distance.

Originally, Death Omen thought that Shi Feng would, at most, be a little stronger than Meteor. She thought that even if Shi Feng could win against Meteor, it would be a close victory. Hence, she felt that if Meteor and Star Snail were to work together, there would be no way Zero Wing’s team could leave this island alive.

But now… Even if the rest of the Paimon Conglomerate’s Tier 4 experts worked together with Meteor and Star Snail, it was unlikely they’d have any hopes of winning against Shi Feng…

Is this Guild Leader Black Flame’s true strength??Colorful Lunarite’s eyes widened in disbelief at what she had just seen. At the same time, she also understood why Shi Feng had reacted so calmly to seeing the Paimon Conglomerate’s Meteor and Star Snail.

With Shi Feng’s presence, Zero Wing was practically guaranteed to secure Crying Sea City’s Medium Shipyard now.

While everyone was feeling shocked and surprised, Shi Feng promptly charged into the temple as soon as he finished blocking Firenze’s lightning bolts. Although Firenze tried to stop Shi Feng, Shi Feng was too fast, so Firenze could only watch as Shi Feng entered the temple.

It really is the Dragon Princess!

After entering the temple, Shi Feng drank a Master Regeneration Potion he took out from his bag while observing a woman suspended in the middle of the temple’s hall.

The woman wore a holy dress and a silver crown. Her face was as delicate as snow, and she was seemingly asleep as her eyes were tightly shut.

Meanwhile, this holy woman was none other than the Dragon Princess Kelisha in Shi Feng’s memories!

However, before Shi Feng could further scrutinize the holy woman, the threefold barrier outside the temple suddenly shattered. At the same time, another threefold barrier formed at the temple’s entrance, sealing the temple shut.

At this time, Firenze had also appeared inside the temple’s hall. Calmly, he looked at Shi Feng and said, “I have to say that you are very lucky to be able to reach this place, heaven’s blessed. I even had to retract all my strength just to deal with you. However, you are all out of luck now!”

As soon as Firenze finished speaking, the density of the mana around him rapidly increased in density, doubling in the blink of an eye. The intensity of the aura he radiated was also vastly stronger than before.

“Guild Leader!” Su Qianliu immediately grew worried when he saw Demon King Firenze becoming even stronger than before.

.

If the previous Firenze was equated to a puppy, the current Firenze was akin to an adult tiger in his prime. There was simply no comparison between the two…

“The barrier is gone! All of you retreat immediately!” Shi Feng shouted through the team chat when he saw that Su Qianliu and the others intended to charge into the temple. “None of us will be leaving alive if you come in!”

. Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Su Qianliu and the others gritted their teeth and reluctantly retreated from the temple.

Despite their reluctance, Su Qianliu and the others understood that not even Tier 4 players could resist the current Firenze, let alone Tier 3 players like themselves. If they stood before Firenze, even moving their bodies would become a challenge, let alone fighting the Demon King. They would only drag down Shi Feng if they chose to stay.

Meteor was similarly surprised when he saw the change in Firenze’s strength. Without hesitation, he commanded, “Change of plans! Everyone, retreat immediately!”

After saying so, Meteor fled the area immediately, not daring to stay here even a moment longer. The violent mana Firenze currently radiated could already affect his movements. He had never experienced this situation when facing other Tier 5 monsters.

Firenze paid no heed to the withdrawal of the teams of Zero Wing and the Paimon Conglomerate. Instead, he looked at Shi Feng with a friendly smile and said, “Now that your friends have left, I hope you do not disappoint me. Otherwise, I’ll have no choice but to use them to compensate for my disappointment!”

It’s all or nothing!

When Shi Feng saw that Firenze was about to make a move, he dashed up to Kalisha and cut apart the chains binding her hands. He prayed that this would awaken Kalisha. Otherwise, he really would be dying here today.
