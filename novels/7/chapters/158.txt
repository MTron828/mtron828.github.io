Chapter 159 - The Forgotten History

The power of Tier 1 Magic Scrolls far surpassed the capabilities of the magic of players at this stage of the game.

The might of fire-type and ice-type magics that Shi Feng wielded was especially frightening.

A Tier 1 AOE scroll, Flame Explosion, instantly caused over -6,000 damage to the Golden Fish, while another Tier 1 AOE scroll, Cold Wind Blowing, caused over -5,000 damage.

With all three members of Shi Feng’s group attacking simultaneously, the Golden Fish had nowhere to hide.

Due to being frozen by the Frost Grenades, the Golden Fish were unable to move at all. Tier 1 Magic Scrolls bombarded them with magical attacks, one after another, rapidly reducing the Golden Fish’s HP and sending them into a crippled state.

After an all-out burst lasting more than ten minutes, Shi Feng completely exhausted all of the attack-type Tier 1 Magic Scrolls he obtained from the Moonlight Forest. They had also fully depleted the Frost Grenades he bought from the Blackwing City.

If totaled, the value of all of the items used was at least 20 Gold Coins. This loss could bankrupt a normal Guild.

However, their harvest during these ten minutes or so was bountiful. They captured a total of 247 Golden Fish during this time, increasing their total accumulated number to 1510 Golden Fish, far exceeding Shi Feng’s initial estimation. They had perfectly achieved the quest’s targeted number.

“Brother Feng, here’s the Golden Fish I collected.”

“Here’s mine as well.”

Blackie and Lonely Snow excitedly handed over all the Golden Fish they captured to Shi Feng. Anticipation filled their eyes as they waited for Shi Feng to trade for the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath. They wanted to see just how powerful the Attributes a Fragmented Legendary ranked item were.

Just as Shi Feng received all the Golden Fish, hesitation appeared on his face.

Originally, his goal from the beginning had been the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath. Now, however, he had an additional 500 or so Golden Fish in his possession, far exceeding his initial estimates. He did not know just what sort of items he should trade for with these extras.

“Brother Feng, what’s wrong?” Blackie curiously asked as he noticed Shi Feng’s thoughtful expression.

“Nothing much. I want to ask you guys for your opinions. Right now, we have over 500 extra Golden Fish; so we can gain plenty more items with them. If we trade them for Dark-Gold Equipment, we can get two to three pieces. If we convert them to Level 15 Fine-Gold Equipment, we have enough for more than ten pieces. If we trade them for Secret-Silver ranked items, we can outfit the entire party with them, greatly increasing the party’s strength. However, we can also exchange 500 Golden Fish for an Epic ranked item,” Shi Feng said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“When everyone reaches Level 15, the entire party can be fully equipped with Level 15 Secret-Silver Equipment?” Blackie trembled with excitement just from the thought of it.

Although they still needed some time before they reached Level 15, and by the time they reached that level, the scarcity of equipment would have decreased, an entire party fully geared with Secret-Silver Equipment was not a feat that even a first-rate Guild could achieve. Even the elites amongst the elites of these first-rate Guilds would, at most, have one to two pieces of Secret-Silver Equipment. Moreover, the equipment would be Level 10, not Level 15.

Possibly, only those very few apex experts that reached Level 15 could gather a full set of Secret-Silver Equipment. However, it would still be impossible for them to gather a complete set of Level 15 Secret-Silver Equipment. This meant that the moment all the members of the Zero Wing party reached Level 15, they would instantly soar to become an apex party in God’s Domain. None of the elite parties of the major Guilds would be their equal.

“We could surpass all the elite parties of first-rate Guilds and become the topmost Level 15 elite party in God’s Domain?” Lonely Snow grew excited as well.

“What do you guys think?” Shi Feng asked.

Blackie and Lonely Snow entered deep thought.

This was an extremely grave matter, as it was a problem related to the future development of the Zero Wing Workshop.

After the three of them gave the matter some thought, Blackie suddenly said, “Brother Feng, my suggestion is to trade for the Epic ranked item.”

“Although it would be awesome for our party fully equip Secret-Silver Equipment the moment we reached Level 15, it isn’t exactly impossible for us to get more Secret-Silver Equipment in the future. Meanwhile, an Epic ranked item is definitely something we won’t encounter again. We also don’t know when we’ll get another chance like this.”

“This is an extremely rare opportunity, so we need to grab it without hesitation. Although an Epic ranked item can only raise a single person’s strength, its benefits to the party not that great. However, with a single powerhouse in the party, we will have a much easier time obtaining Secret-Silver ranked items. On the other hand, even if we had a party fully geared with Secret-Silver Equipment, we won’t obtain even a single Epic ranked item. When considering the future, Level 15 Secret-Silver Equipment will sooner or later be worthless. However, it is a different matter for an Epic ranked item. It can bring us longer-lasting benefits.”

“I also agree. To a large Guild, the improvements brought about by an Epic ranked item might not compare to over a hundred pieces of Secret-Silver ranked items. However, these large Guilds are still willing to use hundreds of Secret-Silver ranked items to trade for just a single Epic ranked item. The reason being, although having a hundred or more Secret-Silver ranked items could temporarily increase our strength, what about the future? Leader, I think we should exchange for an Epic ranked item instead.”

Blackie and Lonely Snow exchanged looks with each other. They had both given Shi Feng their most earnest opinions. They both believed that, once Shi Feng grew stronger, by the time they reached Level 15, he could outfit them with a pile of good equipment. So, why should they carry out an action that was the equivalent of killing the chicken to get the egg?

“I get it. I’ll take a look and see whether or not the Epic ranked items available for trade will be of any help to us in the future. If they are useless, then I’ll exchange for a dozen or so Fine-Gold ranked items,” Shi Feng nodded his head.

In reality, Shi Feng had thought of this matter as well. However, he couldn’t be too selfish either. Compared to a Fragmented Legendary ranked item, an Epic ranked item was not as important. Hence, when trading for other items, he needed to consider everyone else’s opinions. After all, this was a result that was only possible through everyone’s joint efforts.

“Young adventurer, here is the list of items. Have a look, and simply tell me whichever items you wish to trade,” Faust said with a stiff expression.

He truly did not expect the young fellow before him to be so powerful. To actually obtain the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath that he had treasured for so many years... He had not been willing to sell it in the past, even when someone offered 30,000 Gold Coins. Yet, today, he was trading it away for only 1,000 Golden Fish...

Shi Feng looked at the list of items, discovering that there were three additional Epic ranked items available for trade. There was a necklace called Heart of Light, a longbow called Starchaser, and a staff called Mavis’s Guard.

As for the Dark-Gold ranked items and Fine-Gold ranked items, there were a ton of them available. Almost every kind of item was available.

However, the item that aroused the most attention was still the Fragmented Legendary ranked item, the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath.

It was needless to be mentioned that the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath had to be purchased. As for the remaining three Epic ranked items, one of them was a longbow, a weapon for Rangers, and it was useless to their current party. Hence, only the necklace and staff remained as options.

However, when Shi Feng looked at both the Attributes of these items, he was instantly speechless. He could not decide which item would bring the greatest personal improvement to his party.

“Which one should I choose...?” Shi Feng’s gaze kept switching between the two Epic ranked items before him, indecisive.

Faust only revealed a smile at this sight. What he loved watching the most was the distressed appearance of young people.

After hesitating for a long time, Shi Feng suddenly recalled a name in his memories from long ago. This name had once resounded throughout God’s Domain. However, after going through the ravages of time, this name slowly became unknown and forgotten.

“Esteemed Lord Faust, I wish to exchange for the Heavenly Dragon’s Breath, Mavis’s Guard, and this Level 15 Secret-Silver ranked ring, the Ring of Glory,” Shi Feng said.

“How do you know about this matter?!” Listening to the items that Shi Feng wanted to exchange, Faust was instantly dumbfounded. He fixedly stared at Shi Feng, asking in disbelief.
