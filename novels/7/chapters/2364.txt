Chapter 2365 – Humanoid Monster

Although the Darkmoon Bear had simply halted its charge as a result of Silent Wonder’s attack, the spectating crowd gaped in shock. As if time had stopped, silence fell over the competition venue.

“How is that possible?!”

“What did she do?”

Even Duan Hanshan, Long Xianglong, and White Autumn were shocked, not to mention the various superpowers’ experts.

Even a 100-man team of Level 100, Tier 2 experts would be annihilated if they tried to challenge a Level 100 Grand Lord without a magic array, yet Silent Wonder stood against such a beast alone.

Despite being only Level 99, Silent Wonder had stopped the Darkmoon Beat’s charge with a single spell. It was unbelievable!

“Since when has Wonder been able to silent cast Tier 2 Spells so proficiently?” Cold Memory stared at the smoking Darkmoon Bear, confused.

Although the power of Silent Wonder’s Spell had surprised Cold Memory, she was more surprised by the young Elementalist’s silent casting.

When one cast a Spell without chanting, they sacrificed a significant percentage of their Spell Completion Rate. Achieving an 80% Completion Rate as Yan Xiaoqian had was already impressive, yet Silent Wonder had gone a step further and cast her spell with more than a 90% Completion Rate. Cold Memory knew this because the Tier 2 Spell, Flame Spear, only generated a fire pillar on impact if the caster achieved a 90% completion rate or better.

Not even Silk Moon, a Domain Realm expert, could accomplish the feat.

However, of everyone in the venue, Silent Wonder was the most shocked to see this outcome.

So, this is the power of a Fragmented Legendary Weapon? Silent Wonder’s heart pounded as she glanced at the Brilliant Silver in her hand.

Shi Feng had secretly passed her the weapon before she had walked onto the battlefield. She had nearly stumbled when she had seen the staff.

A Fragmented Legendary Weapon!

The various superpowers constantly searched for such a weapon, and not even the Azure Chamber of Commerce had found one, yet Zero Wing had.

She had seen many powerful Epic Weapons, but they weren’t even in the same dimension as Brilliant Silver.

Setting aside the staffs Attributes, Brilliant Silver’s Passive Skills made it far stronger than an Epic Weapon.

Thanks to Soul Transition, she now possessed a Tier 3 soul, and as a result, her Spells were much easier to cast. With the bonus to her Mana Body as well, she had more control over Mana than ever before.

Before the spectators could recover from their daze, the Darkmoon Beat charged at Silent Wonder again, giving the Elementalist no time to prepare. The Grand Lord was clearly furious, and when it was only 30 yards from Silent Wonder, it jumped into the air and launched a Mana-filled swipe at the young woman.

A translucent paw of Mana formed in the air, and many of the watching experts despaired. Not only was this paw incredibly fast, but it also covered a 20-yard radius. Dodging the attack would be utterly impossible. As the paw manifested, it contained enough power to rip apart space itself. If they were to receive such an attack, they’d be left without a body to bury.

However, before the Mana Paw could land, Silent Wonder waved her staff and cast Enchanted Ice Wall, and a crystalline wall appeared before her immediately.

Boom!

The battlefield trembled for a moment after the Darkmoon Bear’s attack struck the Ice Wall, shaking the venue with the sound of a massive explosion.

“Impossible!”

“How high are her Attributes?!”

“Is she a monster?”

Everyone was flabbergasted as they stared at the Ice Wall, which only bore a few minor cracks.

When Silent Wonder had stopped the Darkmoon Bear’s first charge, they had been able to chalk it up to her luck, assuming she had simply struck a weak spot. However, they had no excuses for her performance in stopping the Darkmoon Bear’s Mana Paw attack with her Enchanted Ice Wall.

And yet, they still couldn’t believe what they were seeing. It was absurd to think a Level 99, Tier 2 Elementalist could have the Basic Attributes to rival a Level 100 Grand Lord. Nobody would believe this story.

“Im-Impossible! How are her Basic Attributes so high?!” Yan Xiaoqian, who watched from outside the barrier, couldn’t believe her eyes.

Yan Xiaoqian’s equipment definitely ranked among the very best in God’s Domain right now. Even the various superpowers’ Domain Realm monsters would likely be no match for her in this regard. However, she could only fight a

Level 100 High Lord at best, yet Silent Wonder stood her ground against a Level 100 Grand Lord, two ranks higher than a High Lord. How could she possibly believe this was true?

Even Cold Memory and South Dream were dumbfounded.

“Just what kind of Guild is Zero Wing to enable a Level 99 player to stand against a Level 100 Grand Lord?”

Cold Memory and South Dream could not help but turn to look at Shi Feng. They had never imagined that Zero Wing would have such a sturdy foundation. For a time, they were overwhelmed with curiosity about the Guild.

Zero Wing was merely a pseudo-superpower.

It had already been amazing that Zero Wing’s ability to nurture Lifestyle players rivaled Dark Pursuit. Now, it proved that it could procure better weapons and equipment than what Dark Pursuit could get their hands on. It was utterly unbelievable.

Everyone already realized that Silent Wonder would win this competition.

If Silent Wonder could block the Darkmoon Bear’s attacks, surviving for 10 minutes would not be difficult. In other words, she would earn the 20 sets of materials, whereas Silk Moon and Yan Xiaoqian would only have 6 sets each.

Zero Wing, is it?

Meanwhile, Duan Hanshan and Long Xianglong could not help but glance Shi Feng’s way.

First, the man had received a friendly greeting from White Autumn, and now, Silent Wonder put on an outstanding display. Regardless of their personal feelings, Duan Hanshan and Long Xianglong had to take Shi Feng seriously.

Rather than focus on Zero Wing, the various superpowers were curious about Silent Wonder’s equipment.

“Her equipment is definitely extraordinary if she can block a Level 100 Grand Lord’s attack at Level 99.1 wonder what kind of equipment she is wearing?”

“The magic runes on her robes seem to match. I suspect she’s wearing set equipment, but which set?”

“If I could get my hands on a set like that, neither my Tier 3 Promotion Quest nor defeating Field Bosses would be a problem.”

For a time, the various superpowers’ experts watched Silent Wonder in envy. If they had such incredible set equipment, they could roam Level 100 neutral maps without fear.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, may I know what set equipment Miss Wonder is using?” White Autumn curiously asked. “It has gathered so much of the ambient Mana.”

Naturally, he shared the same thoughts as the various superpowers. Such a set equipment would make killing Field Bosses in Level 100 neutral maps so much easier. The set might even help him during his Tier 3 Promotion quest.

“The Crimson Sunset, a Tier 2 Advanced Mana Set Equipment,” Shi Feng answered honestly.

“A Tier 2 Advanced Mana Set Equipment?” White Autumn’s breathing became excited. He had never realized that Zero Wing was this powerful. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He had heard of Mana Set Equipment before. It was top-tier set equipment that was even more powerful than Dark- Gold Set Equipment, but Mana Set Equipment was painfully rare in God’s Domain. Moreover, the higher the Mana Set Equipment’s tier was, the rarer it would be. As far as he knew, none of the various superpowers had a single complete Tier 2 Mana Set Equipment, yet Zero Wing had a complete Advanced Mana Set Equipment...

If he could equip Giant’s Heart’s peak experts with the Crimson Sunset, they’d have a better chance of completing their Tier 3 Promotion Quests, as well.

Vice Guild Leader White, are you interested in this Crimson Sunset?” Shi Feng asked.

“You jest, Guild Leader Black Flame. I doubt any player would turn away something like this,” White Autumn said, a hint of envy and desire flashing in his eyes as he gazed at the Crimson Sunset Silent Wonder wore.

“If you want one, Zero Wing has a few,” Shi Feng calmly stated.

Zero Wing certainly needed the Crimson Sunsets, but it needed money more. Since a wealthy Guild like Giant’s Heart was willing to work with Zero Wing, Shi Feng wouldn’t mind selling the Guild a few of the sets.

“Really?” White Autumn was instantly excited about the prospect. “How many sets can you sell?”

He had already witnessed the Crimson Sunset’s effects. If he could get two or three sets for Giant’s Heart, the Guild’s main force wouldn’t have to worry about grinding in Level 100 neutral maps, and he could challenge his Tier 3 Promotion Quest immediately.

“Zero Wing doesn’t have many sets. Will 30 be enough?” Shi Feng asked after giving the matter some thought.
