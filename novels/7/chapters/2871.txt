Chapter 2872 - God’s Domain Shaken

Zero Wing City, Battle Arena: “Guild Leader Black Flame has been promoted to Tier 5?” Sixteenth Cloud was stunned when she read the report she received. Looking at Sorrowful Silence, she asked, “Have you verified this?”

Although quite a number of God’s Domain’s Void Realm experts had gotten promoted to Tier 4 already, with Domain Realm experts even making considerable progress in developing their Mana Bodies, everyone was still a long way from reaching Tier 5.

Creating a Tier 5 Mana Body was an entirely different matter from improving the Completion Rate of one’s Mana Body.

Since most Tier 4 experts hadn’t even developed their Mana Bodies to a significant extent, getting promoted to Tier 5 shouldn’t be possible.

Hence, Sixteenth Cloud found it truly hard to believe that Shi Feng had already reached Tier 5.

However, instead of getting the answer she hoped for, Sorrowful Silence nodded solemnly. He then said in a shocked voice, “Yes, I happened to be in another reception room at the time, negotiating with Zero Wing’s representative for a long-term lease of the Battle Arena’s combat rooms. My room was quite close to the reception room used to host the Secret Pavilion and the three Super Guilds. Every Zero Wing member on the floor reacted strongly. I also saw Mythology’s and Solar Temple’s members leave the Residence, looking grim.”

In reality, Sorrowful Silence didn’t just hear about Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 5 from Zero Wing’s members. He had also personally experienced the frightening aura Shi Feng had exuded. Despite being in an entirely different room, he had still sensed that aura clearly, and it had been much stronger than the auras of the Tier 5 NPCs he had come across before.

Of course, the Tier 5 NPCs Sorrowful Silence met previously had never displayed any killing intent. They had even been actively suppressing their auras. In comparison, Shi Feng had not held anything back when he attacked Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe.

This was why Sorrowful Silence was confident Shi Feng had reached Tier 5.

“This is interesting.” Sixteenth Cloud revealed a hint of joy and excitement after hearing Sorrowful Silence’s confirmation. “Now that Zero Wing has a Tier 5 combatant and opened Zero Wing City to the public, the eastern continent’s status quo will get reshuffled!”

“That’s right! Thank goodness we’re already strategic allies with Zero Wing!” Sorrowful Silence said, nodding in agreement with Sixteenth Cloud.

Tier 5 existences were different from Tier 4 existences. Tier 4 players couldn’t capture a Guild City all by themselves. That was a task that required a large number of Tier 4 players.

When Tier 4 players were still scarce, Zero Wing might’ve been able to pose a significant threat to the various superpowers, but it didn’t threaten their roots.

However, the situation had changed.

A Tier 5 player could effortlessly capture a Guild City-even a superpower’s headquarters

—which meant that Zero Wing had the power to uproot and destroy superpowers.

Moreover, now that Zero Wing’s expert count had skyrocketed, it was entirely capable of expanding its territory and occupying more Guild Cities. It wouldn’t face a manpower shortage even if it captured five or six more Guild Cities.

When the eastern continent’s various powers received this piece of news, the superpowers that had always been working against Zero Wing fell into an awkward situation. This was especially true for Starlink. Upon learning about Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 5, Starlink’s executives all had ashen complexions. Inside the Guild Leader’s office of Starlink’s Residence in the Dark Night Empire…

“Commander, now that Black Flame has gotten promoted to Tier 5, he definitely won’t spare Starlink. Should we migrate our experts to the western continent now?” a Level 150, Tier 4 female Ranger suggested as she looked at the handsome youth quietly reading documents in the office.

“How many times have I told you to refer to me as Guild Leader? I am no longer just the commander of Tremorous Clown but Starlink’s Guild Leader as well,” Lu Tiandi said as he glanced at the enchanting female Ranger.

“Yes, Guild Leader,” the Ranger responded calmly as she looked at Lu Tiandi. She then repeated, “Should we migrate now?”

“That won’t be necessary.” Looking at the report in his hands, Lu Tiandi explained nonchalantly, “Black Flame’s promotion to Tier 5 is indeed a big problem for us, but there’s no need for us to be afraid of him yet. The eastern continent’s situation is no longer the same as before. The Outerworld’s forces are Zero Wing’s biggest problem. Black Flame’s promotion to Tier 5 should pose a considerable headache for those Outerworld players.

“Moreover, Zero Wing has severed all chances of friendly relations with Mythology and Solar Temple. In the next war, the eastern continent’s native NPC forces will definitely not provide Star-Moon Kingdom and the Twin Towers Kingdom with any support. At that time, Zero Wing might not even be able to defend its own Guild Cities, let alone target other forces.

“If I were Black Flame, I wouldn’t have exposed myself as a Tier 5 so soon and become a target for the Outerworld forces. Instead, I would focus on raiding Dungeons and World Bosses to raise my Guild’s strength. God’s Domain isn’t a single-player game. A single Tier 5 player cannot stop all of the Outerworld’s NPC forces!”

The enchanting Ranger’s eyes brightened at Lu Tiandi’s words. “Doesn’t this mean we have a chance?”

“We can forget about Silverwing City since the Outerworld forces will capture it. On the other hand, we can get our hands on Stone Forest City since it is close to the Dark Night Empire. Even if Black Flame is Tier 5, he can defend only one location at a time. Once the war resumes, he’ll be preoccupied with Zero Wing City. At that time, we can find an opportunity to secure Stone Forest City!” Lu Tiandi said, smiling. “However, this isn’t something we can accomplish alone. Go and contact the superpowers that have a grudge against Zero Wing now. I believe they will be more than willing to come on board this plan.”

“Yes, sir!” The Ranger nodded.

While God’s Domain’s various powers were reeling from the news of Shi Feng’s promotion to Tier 5 and preparing countermeasures, Shi Feng had finalized his discussion with the Secret Pavilion and Netherworld Empire over the specifics of their partnership.

“Guild Leader, now that we have the two Guild Legacies, we can probably nurture a batch of Void Realm experts and possibly Domain Realm experts within a short period,” Fire Dance said. When she thought about how the Secret Pavilion and Netherworld Empire would be sending all their information on the Realms of Refinement to Zero Wing’s headquarters tomorrow, she couldn’t help feeling excited.

Although the Guild Legacy Zero Wing received from Unyielding Soul previously was indeed valuable, the information provided allowed Zero Wing to nurture experts only to the Flowing Water Realm at a reliable rate. It was still a far cry from a complete Guild Legacy. After all, only Void Realm experts could serve as a superpower’s mainstay. Zero Wing had far too few of such peak experts.

The only reason Zero Wing managed to produce as many Tier 4 experts as it had now was the various God’s Domain Legacies and excellent training environment the Guild possessed. Even then, these Tier 4 experts could only rank among the lower rungs of Tier 4 players.

“That’s right!” Shi Feng nodded. He similarly felt happy over this matter.

Only when Zero Wing possessed a complete Guild Legacy of its own could it become a true titan in God’s Domain. Once the Guild had the Secret Pavilion’s and Netherworld Empire’s Guild Legacies, it would no longer have to worry about lacking peak experts. Zero Wing could also recruit more talented players since these talents would no longer have to worry about Zero Wing lacking a Guild Legacy.

“Guild Leader, what should we do next?” Fire Dance asked. “Now that we’ve become enemies with Mythology and Solar Temple, the Outerworld forces will target Star-Moon Kingdom and the Twin Towers Kingdom once the war resumes. Should we start withdrawing our forces from those two kingdoms?”

Mythology and Solar Temple held significant influence in the eastern continent. It was also certain that the Outerworld forces would target Zero Wing. However, with Zero Wing’s current strength, defending Star-Moon Kingdom and the Twin Towers Kingdom wouldn’t be feasible. To reduce Zero Wing’s losses, the Guild ought to begin pulling its forces out of these two kingdoms as soon as possible.

“Next?” Chuckling, Shi Feng said, “Go and gather all of the Guild’s Tier 4s now.” “Gather all of the Guild’s Tier 48?”

Shi Feng’s command confused Fire Dance. With the imminent war, what they should do was relocate the Mobile Fortress and Silverwing City. Otherwise, once the Outerworld’s NPC army arrived, Zero Wing would lose both strongholds.

“Yes.” Smiling, Shi Feng said, “Since I’ve reached Tier 5 already, it’s about time we took care of the trouble over at the Orc Empire. We’ll also use this opportunity to let the various superpowers know the consequences of offending us!”

The current God’s Domain had far too little knowledge of Tier 5 existences. Even if Shi Feng had killed Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe, the various superpowers only knew that he was much stronger than Tier 4 players. They still didn’t understand what Tier 5 represented.

“I’ll have them gather right away!”

Fire Dance burned with eagerness when she heard Shi Feng’s words.

Ever since she had gotten promoted to Tier 4, she had never had a good fight or launched an all-out war against other superpowers. She also wasn’t the only person to hold such sentiments. The other Tier 4 experts in the Guild harbored similar thoughts. Now, they finally had the opportunity to display their strength.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com
