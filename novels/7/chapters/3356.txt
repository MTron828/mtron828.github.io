Chapter 431 – Astronomical Contribution

Star Lake City, God’s Domain Association:

Following the end of the city battle, the God’s Domain Association became the liveliest location in Star Lake City. This was due to the Star Lake Legion’s many participants gathering here and forming a long line in front of the exchange counter situated in the Association’s second-floor lobby.

“We really lucked out this time! Not only did the city win an additional set of power furnace energy, but the City Lord even decided to give all legion members a three-month bonus to celebrate!” a young man in his late teens who had only joined the Star Lake Legion recently exclaimed as he looked at the numbers displayed on his quantum watch.

The pretty girl standing behind the young man nodded in agreement. Then, she enviously looked at a young man and woman waiting in line some distance ahead and said, “It’s thanks to Commander Red Frost and Zero Wing’s battle group. Otherwise, reserve participants like us would have nothing to do with the reward distribution this time. I wonder when I’ll be able to become an official participant. If I can get into Zero Wing’s battle group, I’ll also be able to strike it rich like Clay Blade and Pace Angel.”

Similar to Clay Blade and Pace Angel, the young man and pretty girl were also geniuses from the Blue Flash World.

Before joining the Star Lake Legion, they both thought they would enjoy great success once they joined the city legion. However, after making it into the legion, they quickly realized that life after joining the city legion wouldn’t be as smooth-sailing as they thought.

It was true that they could receive a fixed amount of contribution points each month after joining the Star Lake Legion. However, depending on one’s position in the legion, the amount of points one could receive would vary significantly. In the case of reserve participants, they would only receive 1,000 contribution points a month. That wasn’t even enough for them to meet the minimum qualifications to rent a room at the God’s Domain Association. They’d also have to complete a couple of missions on top of that.

To make matters worse, if a reserve participant didn’t have a corporation or powerful family supporting them, they would also need to figure out a way to earn enough Star Coins to pay for their accommodations in the God’s Domain Association. Otherwise, even with enough contribution points, they would still be evicted from their rooms.

Simply put, life as a reserve member in the Star Lake Legion was nowhere near as carefree as they initially imagined. They would still need to worry about making ends meet, and the luxury of visiting Star Lake City’s high-class establishments was still as far away from them as when they first arrived in the Greater World.

Moreover, even if they were lucky enough to become official participants later on, unless they could attract the attention of any corporation or powerful family, they would still have to work hard to cover their training resources and living expenses.

“Soon! Once we convert our 3,000 points into three chances to use the mental strength training room, we’ll definitely become one-star grandmasters! At that time, we’ll take the test to become official participants and apply to join Zero Wing’s battle group!” the young man said confidently.

There was a large variety of mental strength training resources available in the God’s Domain Association, and the most popular among them was the mental strength training room, which drastically improved the efficiency of its occupants’ mental strength training. However, while the mental strength training room was an excellent training facility, it cost 1,000 city contribution points and 10,000 Star Coins to use each time.

For participants belonging to the Star Lake Legion, 10,000 Star Coins was still a manageable sum. However, it was a different story for the contribution points required. Because of the steep cost, most official participants could only afford to enter the mental strength training room once or twice a month.

So, having three opportunities to use the mental strength training room was akin to a dream for reserve participants like them.

“Pace Angel! Just you wait! I’ll also be joining Zero Wing’s battle group soon!” The pretty girl nodded in agreement with the young man, and she couldn’t help but turn to look at the young woman waiting in line some distance ahead with eyes brimming with fighting spirit.

They were both top-tier geniuses of the same era in the Blue Flash World. In terms of talent, she was even superior to Pace Angel, and it wouldn’t be wrong to say that she was only one small step away from becoming an official participant in the Star Lake Legion.

…

Star Lake City, Star Lake Training Center:

Because most of the Star Lake Legion’s participants had gone to exchange resources at the God’s Domain Association, the usually overcrowded Star Lake Training Center had become somewhat deserted. Currently, only a small number of youngsters belonging to the various corporations and powerful families could be seen conducting their usual training here.

At this time, a man and a woman could be seen entering the training center’s main hall, the arrival of these two people instantly sparking a discussion among the training teenagers.

“Quick, look! Isn’t that Vice Commander Shi Feng?”

“Why is he here? I thought he would be exchanging resources at the God’s Domain Association .” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“He’s so handsome! I wonder if Vice Commander Shi is accepting female disciples?”

…

Because Star Lake City achieved victory in the city battle, the entire city was in a festive mood. This was true for both the city legion’s participants and the city’s inhabitants.

Meanwhile, as one of the biggest contributors to the city’s victory, Shi Feng received an astronomical amount of contribution points. Yet, rather than think of how to spend these points at the God’s Domain Association, Shi Feng had come to the Star Lake Training Center. This situation was somewhat surprising to the youths in the training center.

“Another corporation just contacted us, Guild Leader. They hope that we can sell them some points, and they’re willing to buy them using Star Coins at a ratio of 1:25,” Hidden Soul excitedly said.

Star Coins weren’t easy to come by in the Greater World. Yet, everything from training resources to living expenses cost a lot of Star Coins. It was especially so if one was looking to develop their mental strength as efficiently as possible. For example, the accommodations available on the God’s Domain’s Association’s 500th floor and above cost several thousand Star Coins per day. For people lacking in Star Coins like them, this was the perfect opportunity to earn some.

“That’s not a bad rate, but trading contribution points for Star Coins simply isn’t worthwhile at this juncture,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

Under normal circumstances, individuals were prohibited from trading contribution points with each other. However, participants of the city legion were eligible to donate their contribution points to others once a month. This was also the default channel for the city’s various corporations and powerful families to obtain contribution points.

Normally, the various corporations and powerful families would only offer a rate of 1:20 when purchasing Star Coins. In other words, one contribution point was worth twenty Star Coins. Even if an organization or powerful family decided to be generous, they would, at most, offer a rate of 1:22 or 1:23. Rarely would anyone offer a rate of 1:25.

Meanwhile, whenever a city battle ended, the various battle groups would receive a set amount of contribution points based on their performances. More specifically, each point they scored during the city battle would translate to 50,000 contribution points, and this amount would double should the city emerge victorious in the city battle. Then, once a battle group’s earnings were tallied, the Main God System would automatically distribute the points to the group’s members based on everyone’s individual performance.

Zero Wing’s battle group had occupied nine capture points during the city battle’s Tier 4 match, scoring a total of 45 points for Star Lake City. In other words, Zero Wing’s battle group received 4.5 million contribution points, the highest out of all battle groups in the Star Lake Legion.

Out of the 4.5 million contribution points, Shi Feng received four million, while the remaining half a million points were split between the battle group’s four other members.[1]

The average participant would normally only have between 10,000 to 100,000 contribution points for sale. In contrast, Shi Feng had four million contribution points in his possession. So, it was only normal for the various corporations and powerful families to make him a better offer.

Meanwhile, should Shi Feng choose to sell his four million contribution points at a rate of 1:25, he’d receive one hundred million Star Coins. That was already equivalent to the liquid assets of the average corporation in Star Lake City.

However, Shi Feng did not plan to exchange contribution points for Star Coins as it would be incredibly unwise to do so at this time.

The city gaining an additional set of power furnace energy meant that the city’s structure would undergo a complete overhaul. The city would be able to accommodate a larger population, and the value of the city’s real estate would increase. Meanwhile, if one wished to rent the city’s real estate, one must bid for it using the city’s contribution points. If one did not have enough contribution points, one shouldn’t even consider renting any real estate, even if one had the Star Coins to afford it.

Amidst their conversation, Shi Feng and Hidden Soul arrived at the top floor of the Star Lake Training Center. This was where the Star Lake Real Estate Center was situated at.

TL Notes:

[1]the remaining half a million points were split between the battle group’s four other members:

Leroja and the others aren’t part of the Star Lake Legion or Star Lake City, so they don’t receive any contribution points.
