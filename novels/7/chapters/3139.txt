Chapter 214 – Terror Descends

“A group of experts who are less than twenty years old?”

The people in the bar couldn’t help but doubt the sanity of the Wild Wolf Team’s members after hearing what they had to say. After all, only an insane person would say such nonsense.

Peak experts typically referred to Void Realm experts capable of grasping their surroundings with their senses to a masterful degree. Or, more specifically, peak experts could observe a battlefield they were fighting on from a third person’s perspective.

However, reaching the Void Realm was by no means an easy feat, especially not for someone under the age of twenty.

Experts capable of achieving this standard before twenty years old would typically be a peerless genius who had received the full support of a superpower. Meanwhile, a superpower would be smiling from ear to ear if it could nurture two or three of such geniuses per generation.

A force of 500-plus peerless geniuses was something one couldn’t find even if one added the peerless geniuses of all superpowers together. Hence, to say that such a force was attacking Windy Sand Town was simply absurd.

“Let’s go out and see who we’re dealing with,” Summar Wolf said as he stood up from his seat.

Summer Wolf similarly felt that the Wild Wolf Team members’ recount sounded absurd. However, he didn’t disregard their words completely. Since the attacking force had managed to cause the Wild Wolf Team members to grow so flustered, it should at least mean that the other party had many powerful experts.

After saying so, Summer Wolf walked out of the bar with the Flower of Seven Sins’ several dozen peak experts. At the same time, he also contacted the Flower of Seven Sins members operating near Windy Sand Town, having them hurry over for support.

“Boss Wolf, aren’t you being overly cautious to have everyone come back for support?” the short girl walking next to Summer Wolf asked. “Lord Gluttony’s side is in urgent need of a large number of Mounts right now. The invading force consists of 500 or so people only. If we have all of the core members come back from hunting, it’ll severely affect Lord Gluttony’s plans...”

Windy Sand Town had at least 7,000 Refinement Realm experts garrisoning it at all times. On top of that, there were also 100 Flower of Seven Sins core members stationed in the town. Every one of these core members was a peak expert. Not to mention, the town also had a large number of Red Players resting in it.

With so many experts on their side, they could withstand even an all-out assault from a superpower, let alone Zero Wing.

As for the 500-plus peak experts the Wild Wolf Team members mentioned, she estimated that the invading party would, at most, have 100 or so peak experts. After all, the average superpower in God’s Domain didn’t even have such a large number of peak experts. Even if Zero Wing borrowed the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s strength, it would already be plenty amazing if it could recruit the help of 100-plus peak experts.

“It’s better to be safe than sorry. Not to mention, Black Flame is leading Zero Wing’s team this time. If we can take him down here, it’ll be a devastating blow to Zero Wing and Asura!” Summer Wolf explained. “With Windy Sand Town’s strength, defending against a God-ranked expert will be easy. However, killing a God-ranked expert will be a challenge, especially after the Wild Wolf Team has gotten ambushed. If we want to ensure we kill Black Flame, we’ll have to rely on the lunatics under Lord Gluttony.”

Every commander in the Flower of Seven Sins had their own forces. Among them, the Sin of Gluttony was known for its madness. The Predators under Gluttony’s command were also regarded as lunatics within the Flower of Seven Sins.

On top of being Void Realm experts or above, these Predators fought without regard for anyone around them. The term “cooperation” did not exist in their dictionaries. Even when they fought as a team, they would only think of taking advantage of each other’s existence to kill their targets. They were willing to kill even their teammates so long as they could kill their targets.

In addition, the Sin of Gluttony had a special Legacy that granted these Predators the Bloodrage ability. With this ability, the Predators could increase their Basic Attributes and Physique by up to 50% without using battle arrays or magic barriers. All they needed to do was fight on the same battlefield. Meanwhile, the more Predators there were on a battlefield, the greater Bloodrage’s effects would be. Moreover, Bloodrage could also reduce the damage the Predators took by up to 95%.

When a group of twenty Predators fought together, even a Tier 6 God-ranked expert wouldn’t dare to clash with them head-on. Moreover, this was when those lunatics were fighting a Tier 6 God-ranked expert while being only at Tier 5 themselves. Now that everyone in the Miniature Ancient World was still stuck at Tier 3, the Predators would be an even greater threat to God-ranked experts.

It might only take ten Predators to kill a God-ranked expert of the same tier.

Shortly after Summer Wolf finished speaking, he and the other peak experts of the Flower of Seven Sins arrived at Windy Sand Town’s main street.

“Impossible!”

Summer Wolf was stupefied when he saw the sea of corpses before him.

At this moment, the main street that used to be crowded with Red Players had already transformed into a land of death, the corpses of players covering the entire street. Although these players were dead, their Red Name status did not disappear. So, Summer Wolf could instantly determine that the players lying on the ground were all Red Players...

“What...happened here?” The short girl standing next to Summer Wolf was similarly shocked and confused by the scene before her.

Only a few minutes had passed from when someone had come into the bar to tell them that the town was under attack until now. Yet, over ten thousand of Windy Sand Town’s experts had died in these few short minutes.

It should be known that these were all Red Players they were talking about. Moreover, most of them were Refinement Realm experts.

Before Summer Wolf and the others could recover from this shocking scene, several excited voices suddenly entered their ears.

“Hey! There are still some alive here!”

“These people are mine! You guys stay away from them!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Scram! I can feel that I’m already on the brink of a breakthrough! These people are mine!”

“Alright, stop arguing! If we don’t strike now, the others will notice!”

After a few verbal exchanges, a dozen or so figures jumped down from a nearby roof and began attacking Summer Wolf’s group with wild abandon.

“You little punks are courting death!”

When Summer Wolf got a clear look at the figures charging at him, he found that every one of these attackers was a youth no more than twenty years old. Yet, these youths were looking at him as if he were prey…

He, who used to send shivers down the spines of countless experts in God’s Domain, had actually turned into prey in the eyes of these children.

This situation enraged Summer Wolf.

However, a short moment after both sides started clashing, Summer Wolf’s anger turned into astonishment.

To his disbelief, every one of these dozen or so youths possessed combat standards rivaling Void Realm experts. In fact, the sharpness of their five senses was superior to even Void Realm experts. They could always avoid fatal blows in the nick of time.

After both sides traded blows for several rounds, it became apparent that the Flower of Seven Sins’ side had the advantage. Yet, no matter how the Flower of Seven Sins’ members tried, they simply couldn’t kill the youths attacking them.

No wonder the Wild Wolf Team lost. Even I will need some time to kill these kids in a one-on-one fight, Summer Wolf thought as he looked at the youths before him. At the same time, confusion filled his heart as he failed to understand how Zero Wing had managed to recruit so many peerless geniuses.

It was obvious that none of these youths had reached the Void Realm. Their stances were full of holes, and their control over Mana was crude. Yet, every one of them possessed extraordinary combat instincts that allowed them to dodge crucial attacks. It felt as if a third person was telling them how to move.

After observing the youths for a moment, Summer Wolf revealed a cold smile as he commanded, “Use the Soul Curse Scroll to increase their death penalties! Zero Wing will need a very long time to recover if we can get rid of all these peerless geniuses!”

The other Flower of Seven Sins members nodded in agreement. Although they didn’t know how these youths had managed to kill so many people in Windy Sand Town, they could at least avoid returning empty-handed if they could kill these peerless geniuses from Zero Wing.

Subsequently, some of the Flower of Seven Sins’ core members took out a dark-gray magic scroll from their bags. However, just as they were about to activate the magic scrolls, more players started appearing all around them.

In less than ten seconds, more than two hundred players had appeared around the Flower of Seven Sins’ members…

Meanwhile, in addition to looking very young, every one of these players gave off a very dangerous feeling.
