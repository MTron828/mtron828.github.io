Chapter 2885 – Sword Saint Black Flame?

Shi Feng couldn’t help taking a closer look at Fang Shihan when he heard her words.

Currently, Fang Shihan looked slightly frailer than the last time he saw her. She also no longer exuded the imposing aura of before, although the ambition in her eyes still burned bright.

“Just the two of us?”

Shi Feng stole a glance at the robust Matt and an elderly man standing among the group of superpower representatives. This elderly man possessed a powerful lifeforce; he was absolutely a grandmaster-level expert. Moreover, judging by how respectfully Matt was behaving around this elderly man, it was easy to guess that the elderly man held an eminent position in Mythology. He should be a Guild Elder at the very least.

However, seeing as Fang Shihan was asking for a private conversation, Shi Feng could tell that Fang Shihan had her own thoughts and that these thoughts did not align with Mythology’s plans.

“That’s right, just the two of us.” Fang Shihan nodded, then glanced at the long-haired man beside Shi Feng and smiled sweetly, saying, “Of course, you can bring someone with you. However, it’s not my fault if our relationship gets exposed.”

The long-haired man immediately revealed a look of shock and confusion when he heard Fang Shihan’s words.

Fang Shihan was the young lady of a major corporation. According to rumor, she was even an Upper Zone resident. In addition, not only did she possess a divine level of beauty, but she was even a Vice Guild Leader of Mythology. Countless talented young men wished to get close to her but never got the opportunity to do so. She had an air of indifference even when dealing with Zero Wing’s big shots like Cola.

Nevertheless, she was taking the initiative to seek out Shi Feng. Her friendly behavior with Shi Feng made the long-haired man doubt if she was even the same person as before.

Who is this guy?

Questions filled the long-haired man’s mind as he looked at Shi Feng. However, after snapping out of his daze, he gazed at Shi Feng with anticipation shining in his eyes.

Fang Shihan was an individual of high status. If he could get close to her by even a little bit, even if he were only a third wheel, this achievement would earn him bragging rights for the rest of his life.

“Alright, just the two of us, then.” Shi Feng nodded, ignoring the hopeful look the long-haired man was giving him.

Fang Shifan was not at all surprised by Shi Feng’s response. She pointed at a maglev limousine nearby and said, “Let’s talk in my car, then. Nobody will bother us there.”

Zero Wing’s battle at Ancient Rock City had thoroughly shaken God’s Domain.

Zero Wing City’s public opening also allowed Zero Wing to rake in tons of wealth and resources every day. The resources earned even included the Seven Luminaries Crystal that the Upper Zone’s various forces sought to obtain. The city was so tempting that even the Five Great Super Guilds had designs on it, let alone Fang Shihan.

Zero Wing was currently rejecting all partnership offers for Zero Wing City, choosing to monopolize all of the city’s benefits; the various superpowers could not get even the smallest cut of this juicy pie. To make matters worse, none of the superpowers could do anything about this situation.

However, Fang Shihan was confident she could accomplish what the various superpowers couldn’t. With her family’s position and resources in the Upper Zone, she should be able to get Zero Wing to agree to a partnership. After all, Shi Feng was currently in a lot of trouble because he had offended a mental strength master.

Although Shi Feng lived in a different Upper Zone from Fu Jiuzhong, the mental strength master had plenty of means to deal with him. Among the organizations operating within the three Upper Zones based in the country, those capable of protecting Shi Feng numbered very few—the Fang family just so happened to be one of them.

When Shi Feng saw the maglev limousine, a hint of envy appeared in his eyes. This limousine was a global limited edition, and it was constructed with a top-tier alloy used for spacecraft. This alloy not only had excellent sound insulation properties but could even withstand missile strikes. He had thought of buying one for Zero Wing but lacked the connection to do so.

Nodding, Shi Feng said, “Sure, let’s get in the

car.”

“In that case, this way, please, Guild Leader Black Flame!”

Fang Shihan smiled and took the initiative to lead Shi Feng to the limousine. Her words left the long-haired man stupefied.

“H-He’s...the...Guild Leader?”

The long-haired man stared at Shi Feng’s back with wide eyes. When he recalled how he had treated Shi Feng like a little brother, he suddenly felt faint.

After all, Black Flame’s name in God’s Domain was synonymous with a killing god. He would create rivers of blood because of a disagreement. He had even killed one of Mythology’s legendary figures without hesitation.

The long-haired man wasn’t the only one stunned by this revelation. The young men and women in queue also took some time to process this information.

“He’s Guild Leader Black Flame?”

“No way! He’s that Sword Saint?!”

“Don’t the rumors say that Guild Leader Black Flame is a man in his thirties? That guy looks no more than 22 or 23!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Apart from Zero Wing’s executives and a portion of the Guild’s core members, the only other people who knew Black Flame’s actual identity and appearance in the real world were the various superpowers’ executives. The average player was unaware that Black Flame was only a disguise. “You really know how to keep a low profile, Guild Leader Black Flame. Even the internal members of your own Guild don’t know who you are,” Fang Shihan said, smiling when she looked back and saw the long-haired man’s pale complexion. “That guy will probably lose sleep for the next several days.”

Shi Feng rolled his eyes at Fang Shihan. Fang Shihan knew that the long-haired man was unaware of his identity as Black Flame and had deliberately revealed his identity to mess with the man.

However, when Shi Feng and Fang Shihan were roughly ten steps from the limousine, Shi Feng suddenly stopped and turned to the crowd in the plaza.

“Guild Leader Black Flame?”

Fang Shihan was a little confused by Shi Feng’s actions. She followed Shi Feng’s gaze and looked toward the plaza.

Although there were well over a thousand people crowded in the plaza, Fang Shihan faintly sensed killing intent from that direction. Moreover, there wasn’t just one source of killing intent but more than a dozen.

This killing intent was well-hidden. If one weren’t a half-step grandmaster expert or above, one would have difficulty noticing it.

This can’t be! That side is already taking action?! Fang Shifan frowned. Only the Infinity Master Fu Jiuzhong could mobilize so many powerful experts. She whispered to Shi Feng, “Guild Leader Black Flame, they should be experts the Infinity Master sent. The other side has a significant advantage in numbers. It’s best if we pretend we didn’t notice them and get into the car quickly. Even if it’s them, they can’t do anything against my car.” A force of over a dozen half-step grandmasters or above was indeed powerful. However, against the global limited edition limousine, even these experts could only lament their lack of strength. This was also why many major corporations wished to purchase this limousine. However, only 100 people in the world actually managed to get their hands on one.

“No, there’s no need for that,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. He then began walking toward the plaza. “I initially planned to ignore them, but since they came all the way here, I’ll deal with them now. It’s annoying to have them constantly buzzing me like flies.”
