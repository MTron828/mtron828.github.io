Chapter 2787 – Unfathomable Black Flame

“A Flying Ship?!” “How is this possible?!”

Skyflare’s members gaped in shock as they looked at the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship in the sky, unable to get their minds around this scenario.

“This must be an illusion!” Blood Blade declared, his eyes filled with disbelief. “This must be fake! How can a Flying Ship appear in the hands of a player?”

In an era where players didn’t possess even Flying Mounts, a Flying Ship was basically an item of legends. In fact, he had only ever seen Flying Ships mentioned in books before. Not a single Flying Ship had ever appeared even in a trade city like Meteorite City. According to rumors, only the Holy City’s patrol guards had Flying Ships, which they would use when they patrolled the human territories of God’s Domain. Flying Ships simply weren’t objects players could get their hands on.

At this moment, let alone Blood Blade, even Lionheart was stunned when he saw the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship.

As for Crimson Billow and Wind Chaser, after briefly falling into shock, they turned reflexively to look at Shi Feng.

Who is this Black Flame? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This question continuously resounded in their minds.

They had conducted plenty of investigations into Shi Feng and his entourage. After all, they were planning a long-term partnership with him, so they had to gain some understanding of him.

Only, the more they looked into Shi Feng, the more they found him unfathomable. They simply couldn’t see through his depths.

Initially, they merely assumed Shi Feng was a Tier 4 expert from another NPC city. However, after they saw the effects of the Crystal of Souls and Soul Water he took out, they knew that they were definitely mistaken. After all, none of the neighboring NPC cities offered such items.

From then onward, they felt that Shi Feng was someone extraordinary, potentially the executive of a major power from a distant NPC city. Otherwise, he couldn’t have casually taken out such precious items. Not to mention, he also possessed incredible strength as an individual.

This was one of the reasons their commander, Lionheart, wished to display Skyflare’s strength to Shi Feng and rope him to their side. After all, partnering with a major power of such caliber would be of great benefit to the Skyflare adventurer team.

Now, Shi Feng even brought out a legendary item like the Flying Ship. They simply couldn’t figure out his identity.

At this point, the Skyflare adventurer team practically had exclusive ownership of Meteorite City already. Although Skyflare still wasn’t comparable to large Guilds that occupied several cities, it could already be considered an overlord in God’s Domain.

Even if Skyflare was still inferior to the various top Guilds, the distance between them definitely wasn’t that massive.

When Yu Luo saw the reactions of Skyflare’s members, she wasn’t particularly surprised.

After all, back when Shi Feng first revealed the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship in the modern God’s Domain, he had similarly shocked the entire world.

“Alright, let’s head up,” Shi Feng said before nonchalantly jumping onto the Flying Ship. The Crimson Dragon Flying Ship was an Advanced Flying Ship capable of carrying up to 130 people—just enough to accommodate everyone present. At Shi Feng’s words, Skyflare’s members promptly snapped out of their daze. They then silently boarded the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship while doing their best to suppress the excitement and shock in their hearts, afraid of appearing like provincials to Shi Feng’s group.

Despite their best efforts, their suppressed emotions instantly exploded as soon as they arrived on the Flying Ship’s deck.

After all, the feeling of overlooking Meteorite City while standing aboard the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship was simply wonderful.

Just the fact that the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship was parked in the air above Meteorite City instantly made it the most eye-catching existence in the city.

At this time, players and NPCs on the streets were gazing at the Flying Ship, their eyes wide with shock and envy. They also held heated discussions, curious about why a Flying Ship would appear above the Skyflare Hotel all of a sudden. The players, in particular, went into an uproar when they saw Skyflare’s members aboard the Flying Ship.

However, before Meteorite City’s players could come to any conclusions, the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship began gradually ascending into the sky. Afterward, it transformed into a streak of light and vanished from Meteorite City, even faster than the Flying Mounts available for rent.

“How fast! At this speed, we can probably reach the Ghostfire Hills in around a dozen hours,” Lionheart exclaimed. He was astonished to see Meteorite City rapidly shrinking behind him.

He had ridden Flying Mounts before. However, compared to the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, those Flying Mounts were significantly slower.

“The Crimson Dragon Flying Ship is still alright in terms of speed,” Shi Feng said calmly. “However, while it is indeed slightly faster than Common Flying Mounts, it is still much slower than Tier 3 Advanced Extraordinary Flying Mounts. In terms of destructive power, though, it is comparable to Tier 4 Advanced Extraordinary Flying Mounts.”

Although Shi Feng had spoken very calmly, Lionheart and the others paid close attention to his every word, afraid that they would miss out on even the tiniest bit of information. “Brother Black Flame, you must’ve spent a lot of Magic Crystals to secure this Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, right?” Lionheart asked after giving the matter some thought.

The Flying Ship he was standing on was simply too cool. From Shi Feng’s description of it, it was basically a tyrant of the skies. Anyone who said they weren’t interested in the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship would be lying.

“Quite a lot. Even now, my Guild has only managed to produce nine,” Shi Feng said, nodding

Most of the materials the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship needed were relatively common. However, it was a different story for the Titan Silver and Magic Elven Stones required, especially the Magic Elven Stones. Despite having bought out all of the Magic Elven Stones on the market, Zero Wing had managed to construct only nine Crimson Dragon Flying Ships until now.

“Nine?” Lionheart nearly failed to close his mouth.

In his opinion, a Guild would be plenty amazing to be able to procure even one of such sky tyrants. Yet, Shi Feng’s Guild had nine?

“Are you interested in the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, Commander Lionheart?” Shi Feng couldn’t help chuckling at Lionheart’s astonished expression.

“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t interested in such a treasure.” While scanning the Flying Ship’s deck, Lionheart said enviously, “If Skyflare could have a Flying Ship like this, let alone occupying multiple NPC Main Cities, even going up against the top Guilds wouldn’t be a problem.”

The Crimson Dragon Flying Ship’s combat power might not be a big deal for Skyflare now that the adventurer team had five Tier 4 players, but the Flying Ship’s carrying capacity and speed were simply astonishing.

With this Flying Ship, Skyflare’s teams would no longer have a problem leveling up. They could travel to anywhere they wished. Skyflare could even use the Flying Ship to ferry resources between cities and earn a ton of Magic Crystals.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the existence of just one Flying Ship could allow Skyflare to undergo a qualitative transformation.

Skyflare’s executives nodded in agreement with Lionheart’s words.

It would be wonderful if their adventurer team could get their hands on a treasure like the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship. In fact, even if Skyflare gained an additional dozen or so Tier 4 players, the value these Tier 4 players could bring wouldn’t even be close to what one Flying Ship could bring.

A faint smile appeared on Shi Feng’s face as he said, “Commander Lionheart, since you are so interested in the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, I can sell one to the Skyflare adventurer team.” The instant Shi Feng finished speaking, every one of Skyflare’s members turned to him involuntarily. Shi Feng’s words were a siren song; they couldn’t help getting ensnared. Lionheart’s breathing also quickened at Shi Feng’s words as he sought confirmation. “Brother Black Flame, is what you said true?” “Of course, but it won’t be cheap,” Shi Feng said, nodding In reality, part of the reason he had taken the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship out was to display it to Skyflare’s members and lure the adventurer team into buying it.

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, Lionheart answered with no hesitation whatsoever. “Brother Black Flame, please state your price! So long as you are willing to sell this Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, Skyflare will do everything it can to buy it!”
