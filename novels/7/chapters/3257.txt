Time quickly passed while everyone was busy discussing Hidden Soul’s astonishing performance. By the time everyone had recovered from their shock, Gentle Snow, who had gone into the test hall after Hidden Soul left it, slowly walked out of the test hall. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Changed:

While everyone was busy discussing Hidden Soul’s astonishing performance, Gentle Snow, who had gone into the test hall after Hidden Soul, slowly walked out of the test hall.

…

“Tenth? She came in 10th place on her first test?”

“Heavens! What did I just see?!”

“A paragon! No, a monster! She’s an absolute monster!”

When everyone in the lobby saw Gentle Snow’s results on the scoreboard, they reacted as if they had just seen Armageddon. Everyone was absolutely horrified by Gentle Snow’s results.

When Hidden Soul achieved a rank of 35 on her first test previously, everyone could still more or less accept it. After all, the precedent with Shi Feng had already raised everyone’s tolerance by a significant margin.

However, Gentle Snow’s test results were a completely different story. If anyone who had spent some time living in the Greater World wasn’t horrified by these results, there must be something wrong with their mind.

“That big sister got into the top 10 on her first test?” Pace Angel’s eyes sparkled when she saw Gentle Snow’s results. Then, she looked to the dazed youth next to her and asked, “Clay, do you know when was the last time a newcomer came in 10th place on their first test in Star Lake City?”

“This… I don’t know…” Clay Blade shook his head in a daze.

As one of the few powerful worlds that had managed to develop its God’s Domain into a Higher God’s Domain, the Blue Flash World possessed a rather comprehensive database of information regarding the Starlight Continent’s various cities.

Before their group of geniuses was dispatched to Star Lake City, they were already given detailed information Blue Flash had collected on Star Lake City. Included among this information was a list of geniuses who had managed to get into the top 100 of the Star Lake Legion’s selections held in the past 100 years.

However, if Clay Blade recalled correctly, no newcomer had managed to get within the Star Lake Legion’s selection’s top 10 on their first test in the past 100 years. In fact, nobody had even managed to get into the top 20 on their first test…

“It’s normal for you youngsters not to know about this,” the old man responsible for leading the Blue Flash World’s young geniuses said after approaching Pace Angel and Clay Blade. “In the 200 years I have spent working as a guide in Star Lake City, I have never seen the appearance of such a monster before…”

Even after the old man finished speaking, none of the members of Star Lake City’s local powers spoke up to refute him. It was evident that these people agreed with what the old man said.

…

“Elder Kong, has such a monster ever appeared in our Star Lake City?” Chen Qitian asked as he stood up from his seat and looked downstairs at Gentle Snow.

“According to the Dawn Light Corporation’s database, no such monster has ever appeared in Star Lake City’s history,” the butler, referred to by Chen Qitian as Elder Kong, said with a serious expression. “Not even the several neighboring cities have recorded the appearance of such a monster before…”

“So, there aren’t any precedents?” Chen Qitian got goosebumps when he heard Elder Kong’s answer. “Her! I must have her!”

The Dawn Light Corporation was a local corporation in Star Lake City. The corporation had a very long history, and the information it had collected on Star Lake City was far more comprehensive than what the Blue Flash World possessed. So, it was unimaginable for the Dawn Light Corporation to come across an expert of unprecedented caliber.

If Gentle Snow truly was such a monster, the so-called challenge of becoming a three-star mental strength grandmaster would be nothing but a joke for her.

Gentle Snow could absolutely go beyond the realm of mental strength grandmasters. Moreover, she wouldn’t just be a run-of-the-mill existence in that realm. She was talented enough to stand out, even beyond the realm of mental strength grandmasters.

It should be known that three-star mental strength grandmasters were existences qualified to create a corporation and pioneer a city in the Greater World. Because of this, every corporation would treat three-star mental strength grandmasters respectfully. They would also do their best to pander to individuals who had either become or had the potential of becoming a three-star mental strength grandmaster.

However, when dealing with monsters who could go beyond the realm of grandmasters, the reaction the various corporations would have wouldn’t be limited to just awe and respect. Instead, they would go crazy!

While three-star mental strength grandmasters had the qualifications to start a corporation, they weren’t at a level where they could single-handedly change a corporation’s fate, especially not a corporation with an established history. However, it was a different story for individuals who had gone beyond the realm of mental strength grandmasters. These were existences qualified to rule a significant portion of the Starlight Continent. At the same time, they were also a necessary foundation for corporations to get elevated into conglomerates.

Conglomerates!

These were existences standing at the apex of the Greater World’s various continents. The authority of conglomerates was so great that corporations wouldn’t even dare to offend the ordinary members of conglomerates. They would even try to pander to these ordinary members. Conglomerates were akin to emperors in the Greater World, and the only existences that could contend against a conglomerate were other conglomerates.

How many powers in the Greater World could possibly refuse the temptation of such great power?

At this time, Chen Qitian wasn’t the only person to have thoughts about obtaining Gentle Snow. Almost every young master originating from Star Lake City’s local corporations and powerful families shared similar thoughts.

…

Gentle Snow? Who on earth is she?

When Thousand Scars looked at Gentle Snow now, her confidence diminished drastically. She felt like a chicken who had just met a phoenix. She dared not look at the other party directly.

A three-star mental strength master at 19 years old?

An internal member of the Paimon Conglomerate at 19 years old?

These achievements were worthless compared to the results Gentle Snow had just displayed.

With her test results, Gentle Snow could make even the Galaxy Conglomerate extend an olive branch to her without hesitation. The conglomerate would even designate her as a core member and nurture her with the intent of developing her into a core executive in the future.

…

While everyone was staring at Gentle Snow, Shi Feng couldn’t help but reveal a bitter smile.

“You two really know how to find trouble for me,” Shi Feng said, holding his head as he looked at Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow.

Shi Feng had long since known that Gentle Snow possessed extraordinary talent. After all, she was one of Zero Wing’s Five Great Experts during his previous life. She was also an existence capable of fighting against Demon’s Gate’s Nine Great Experts.

In fact, when they competed purely in combat techniques in the past, Shi Feng wasn’t even a match for Gentle Snow…

However, what Shi Feng did not expect was for Gentle Snow to reach such a level in this life after only receiving the assistance of the Holy Annihilation Mana Technique and the Primordial Tower’s second floor. This outcome was completely outside of his expectations.

“Isn’t that because we wanted to make you proud, Guild Leader?” Hidden Soul said, a faint smile forming on her face when she saw Shi Feng’s troubled expression.

As for Gentle Snow, she revealed an apologetic smile, understanding that she had gone a little overboard in her test.

“Whatever. You two aren’t my only problems,” Shi Feng said, sighing. Then, he scanned the crowd in the lobby with his eyes before nonchalantly saying, “Let them come if they want. I’ll just take care of all of them together!”

After saying so, Shi Feng guided Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow to their assigned lodgings. He also gave them a detailed introduction to the Greater World and the God’s Domain Association’s many benefits.

As for the various powers, they could only watch as Shi Feng’s group of three disappeared into an elevator, nobody daring to make any reckless moves.

The God’s Domain Association prohibited people from fighting on its premises. This was an ironclad rule that the Association strictly enforced, and not even conglomerates dared to break this rule. Otherwise, they’d be making an enemy out of the entire God’s Domain Association.

However, at the same time as Shi Feng’s group left the lobby, news of Gentle Snow getting into the top 10 of the Star Lake Legion’s selection on her first test quickly spread across Star Lake City, the news sending shockwaves throughout the city.
