Chapter 90 - Starting from Zero Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As Shi Feng entered and spoke...

“Who are you?”

Wu Yi was slightly startled, his eyes evaluating Shi Feng. Shi Feng wore a cheap-looking white-blue sporting wear. Although his imposing manner gave Wu Yi chills down his back, after seeing that Shi Feng was not even wearing a quantum watch on his wrist, a hint of disdain entered Wu Yi’s eyes. In this day and age, even the slightly wealthier students all possessed quantum watches. Wu Yi determined that Shi Feng was not one of the wealthy children and that he was in a similar situation as Blackie.

“Brother Feng, why are you here?” Blackie’s expression was slightly panicked. He was worried Shi Feng would misunderstand and think he was trying to job-hop, “Brother Feng, I really didn’t seek out Shadow. I’ve also rejected them, but Wu Yi won’t stop annoying me about it.”

When Blackie’s classmates saw him panicking and explaining, they were all puzzled at the identity of this new arrival.

Blackie had already risen to Level 5 in God’s Domain, so he was definitely an expert. Many Workshops would fight over for him, treating him as an important guest. Even Shadow sent someone over to recruit Blackie. If the upper-echelons of Shadow met Blackie, they might also act very cordially and treat him with respect.

However, Blackie had respectfully addressed the stranger in front of them as Brother Feng, confusing them. Could the person in front of them be some famous person in their school? However, no matter how they wracked their brains, they could not think of such a person present in their university.

“I know,” Shi Feng sent Blackie an expression that told him to be at ease. Shi Feng then looked towards the man named Wu Yi and laughingly said, “I’m called Shi Feng, and I am the nobody who established the Workshop you just mentioned. Didn’t you wish to know the name of my Workshop?”

“I can tell it to you. The Workshop’s name is Zero Wing. It means that everything has to start out from zero and to spread your wings and soar. If you don’t have any other matters, please return and tell your boss not to try poaching the members of other Workshops. He is better off taking care of his own lands, lest they fall apart without him even knowing what happened.”

Hearing Shi Feng saying so, Wu Yu couldn’t help but reveal a sneer as he laughed.

“As expected, even a nobody knows how to start a Workshop. Why don’t you take a look at yourself? Do you think you can start a Workshop just by announcing it?” Wu Yi narrowed his eyes, mocking, “Do you know how large our Shadow Workshop is? Do you know how many members our Shadow Workshop has? Do you know who is backing our Shadow Workshop? Do you know how much our Workshop has invested? Do you still think that we need to poach members from worthless Workshops like yours?

“Just based on the fact that you guys are still using the trial helmet to play the game shows how dirt poor you are. Did you think that, just by being full of zeal, you could establish yourselves in God’s Domain and earn money? All the Workshops that have tried to establish themselves in God’s Domain have at least invested several millions of Credits. Meanwhile, you have no money, no members, no facilities, and not even the most basic of assurance. So, what right do you have to compare to us, Shadow?

“If you kneel down and beg me right now, I might even put in a few good words to Brother Lan. If you pay up some ten or twenty thousand Credits, you might be able to join the Workshop. How about it? Think about it; this is a rare chance for you.” Wu Yi smiled savagely. He then shifted his gaze to Blackie, coldly saying, “Shadow is already giving you a lot of respect by sending me here to recruit you. As long as you join, you’ll immediately receive the treatment of being a core member, and your monthly salary will be at least 5,000 Credits. It is hundreds of times better than staying in a Workshop that is barely surviving.”

When Blackie’s several dorm mates heard of this treatment, all of them had expressions of shock on their faces. They did not think that playing God’s Domain would be so rewarding. Compared to those city white-collar workers, Blackie’s salary was much higher. Suddenly, the gazes they used to look at Blackie changed. They no longer looked down on him; rather, their gazes now filled with envy and admiration.

They were only several months away from graduating from the university. Right now, they were still having headaches over finding jobs. Meanwhile, Blackie had someone personally coming to his door to recruit him, and the other party had even offered a minimum monthly salary of 5,000. As the saying went, ‘comparisons are odious.’

If they had known about this earlier, they would have properly played games and gave God’s Domain a try. They might have even become experts. They would not have had to chase after girls for their four years in universities and been looked down upon by those girls. If they managed to earn money, beauties would be lined up for their choosing.

However, after listening to Wu Yi, Blackie, instead, started laughing. Wu Yi actually dared to make fun of the Workshop Shi Feng had started, calling it worthless, and even wanted to make Shi Feng kneel before him in order to join Shadow. He was retarded. The Snow Goddess is even paying attention to Brother Feng, and she even wanted to recruit Shi Feng!

Who was the Snow Goddess?

She was the Vice Captain of the first-rate Guild, Ouroboros. She was the publicly acknowledged Goddess of the virtual gaming world. Compared to Ouroboros, Shadow Workshop was not even worth a dime.

Seeing Wu Yi’s mood sour, Blackie sneered at him and said, “Wu Yi, even if you exaggerate it to no end, my decision will remain unchanged. Although Zero Wing Workshop has just started, I believe that our future achievements will definitely be greater than Shadow’s. I advise you to leave Shadow a little earlier and join our Zero Wing Workshop. I’ll ask Brother Feng for a favor. If you kneel and apologize to him, who knows, you might even be able to become a member of Zero Wing!”

Blackie’s dorm mates were shocked upon hearing him. His declaration confused them greatly. In the end, which Workshop was truly the awesome one?

Could it be that, nowadays, choosing the Workshop that couldn’t even afford an official gaming helmet was the right choice?

“You... You are simply unreasonable!” Wu Yi was almost speechless with anger. Blackie actually used his own words to make fun of him. If it weren’t for Brother Zhang instructing him that he definitely must invite Blackie, he would have long since left. It was against his expectations that Blackie would have a brain defect, throwing away a good future and insisting on mingling in a gutter-like place. “Blackie, I am only reminding you because I value talent. Our Shadow is currently trying to annex the 45th ranked Workshop in Jin Hai City, Hungry Wolves Workshop. When Shadow succeeds in doing so, we will rank at the top of all of Jin Hai City. If you were to miss this chance now, there would be no more chances for you in the future.”

Wu Yi shot a glance at Shi Feng, coldly saying, “Meanwhile, your Workshop can’t even afford the official gaming helmet. How do you plan to play God’s Domain in the future? It would be better if you joined Shadow. A great future is awaiting you here.”

Faced with such a brazen way of poaching people, even if Shi Feng’s temper were much cooler, he would still get slightly angry.

Since they were fated to battle each other, then battle it was!

“Who said that our Workshop couldn’t afford the official gaming helmet?” Shi Feng took out the 20,000 Credits from his pocket, casually throwing it on the table, saying, “I previously decided that starting a Workshop would be too sudden, and I was never able to decide which type of official gaming helmet I would buy. So, I was only using the trial helmet as a temporary replacement. However, today, I’m here to give Blackie the money to buy an advanced gaming helmet.

“But really, it’s not that I’m trying to criticize Shadow, but aren’t you guys being too cheap in poaching for people? The salary I’m giving Blackie is 20,000 Credits minimum. Your Shadow is so rich, and has invested so much, yet, the salary you’re offering is only a minimum of 5,000 Credits?”

When Blackie saw the shining-white Credits on the table, he turned to look at Shi Feng astonished eyes. Nobody was more knowledgeable of Shi Feng’s financial condition than he was, so how was he able to suddenly throw down 20,000 Credits? Could it be that... Shi Feng robbed a bank?

The others in the dormitory swallowed their saliva when they saw the Credits scattered across the table.

Usually, Blackie remained hidden and did not seem like anything special. They did not think that his monthly salary would be 20,000 Credits. It was no wonder why he refused to join Shadow Workshop. After all, Shadow was only offering him 5,000 Credits, four times less than his current earnings. Even an idiot would know which side to choose.

What was even more unthinkable was that Shi Feng, who was wearing a suit of cheaply-looking sportswear, was actually a Brother Tycoon.
