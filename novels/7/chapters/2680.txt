Chapter 2681 – Arrogant Zero Wing?

System: Transportation Firm can be reconstructed once after promotion at the cost of 40,000 Gold and 100,000 Magic Crystals. Do you wish to proceed with the reconstruction? (Note: Promotion will take place even without the reconstruction.)

...

“Reconstruct it,” Shi Feng said without hesitation.

While Zero Wing’s funds were indeed tight, the Guild still had around 100,000 Gold and 400,000 Magic Crystals reserved for unexpected expenditures. And although reconstructing the Transportation Firm would not grant it any additional functions, there was one benefit—accommodating more NPC merchants to do business within it.

If a Transportation Firm had more NPC merchants, not only would there be more quests available for players to pick up, but there would also be more merchandise for sale. Both of these factors would attract more players to develop in Silverwing City.

As soon as Shi Feng made his decision, 40,000 Gold and 100,000 Magic Crystals vanished from his bag.

Immediately afterward, the Transportation Firm, which stood at the edge of the city, transformed into a cloud of black mist that expanded rapidly, growing to the size of four sports arenas in just five seconds, then dissipated. When the black mist cleared, a five-story-tall building appeared in its place.

While Shi Feng was quietly observing the reconstructed Transportation Firm, Youlan suddenly contacted him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Guild Leader, we’ve finished setting up the city’s security measures. We have also set the entrance fee to ten Silver, as you instructed. We can open Silverwing City at any time,” Youlan said excitedly.

Previously, after news of Silverwing Town’s promotion spread, many players from the neighboring kingdoms had eagerly made their way over to take a look at the city. Based on rough estimates, at least two million players had camped outside the city. With so many players seeking entry, Zero Wing could earn a small fortune just by collecting entrance fees.

Previously, Silverwing Town couldn’t collect any entrance fees since it was a town. Its main sources of income back then were Shop rentals and the Candlelight Trading Firm. Now that they could collect entrance fees from players visiting Silverwing City, the financial problems Zero Wing was currently facing would definitely be resolved.

“Alright, open the city,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

After receiving Shi Feng’s approval, Youlan promptly deactivated the magic array inside the City Lord’s Mansion that prevented outsiders from entering the city.

Immediately, the opaque magic barrier enveloping Silverwing City shattered, and the city appeared before the eyes of everyone outside the city.

The instant Silverwing City was opened to the public, the crowd waiting outside the city walls was dumbfounded.

“Crap! How spectacular! Isn’t this city on the same standard as Stone Forest City?!”

“The appearance isn’t the only thing that’s marvelous. The Mana radiating from Silverwing City feels just slightly inferior to Stone Forest City’s.”

“I’m just wondering how much the entrance fee will be. If it’s too expensive, ordinary players like ourselves will have a difficult time developing in Silverwing City.”

...

Everyone was curious about Silverwing City’s current situation.

It might be fine if it were any other Guild City, but Silverwing City was the only Guild City in the Faux Saint monsters’ territory. Previously, Silverwing Town was already able to fend off an army of more than four million Faux Saint monsters as an Advanced Town. Now that it was a Basic City, the Faux Saint monsters would most likely be helpless against it for the foreseeable future. Hence, one could say that Silverwing City was currently the safest location within the Faux Saint monsters’ territory.

Meanwhile, safety was the number one priority of both ordinary players and experts.

At this stage of the game, many players would fall into despair over even a single death. After all, after reaching Level 100 and beyond, not only did leveling up become much more difficult, but Level 100-plus equipment was also incredibly precious. Losing a single piece of Level 100-plus equipment would set a player back by days or even weeks.

However, after the gathered players lined up at Silverwing City’s main gate, they were stupefied by what they saw.

“An entrance fee of ten Silver? Is Zero Wing insane?” the black-clad, female Summoner from Frost Heaven exclaimed, her eyes widening in shock as she looked at the Tier 3 Personal Guards collecting the entrance fee.

Currently, Guild Cities located in neutral maps generally charged players an entrance fee of only two Silver. While it was reasonable for Silverwing City’s entrance fee to be a little more expensive, as it was the only Guild City in the Faux Saint monsters’ territory, a ten-Silver entrance fee was five times the going rate!

Moreover, the map Silverwing City sat on was not very high-leveled. Even after the transformation due to the Faux Saint monsters, the map had only been upgraded into a Level 80 neutral map, not a Level 100-plus neutral map. If players wished to head to Level 100-plus neutral maps to grind, they would still need to travel quite a distance. Hence, Silverwing City could, at best, be considered a transit station and resting place. Players didn’t need to stop by the city to grind in the Orc Empire’s Level 100-plus maps.

The female Summoner from Frost Heaven wasn’t the only person stunned by Silverwing City’s exorbitant entrance fee; the various superpowers’ members that were planning to enter the city were too. They could not help suspecting that Zero Wing had gone crazy for money.

Originally, there were already very few players willing to operate within the Faux Saint monsters’ territory. After all, the Faux Saint monsters only allowed players to level up faster. They did not drop any weapons or equipment, and the Coins and materials they dropped were inferior compared to the loot from other monsters. Not to mention, operating within the territory of Faux Saint monsters was much more dangerous than operating elsewhere. While a ten-Silver entrance fee wouldn’t be much of a problem for Tier 3 experts, it was a huge expenditure for Tier 2 players.

If Zero Wing insisted on a ten-Silver entrance fee for Silverwing City, hardly any Tier 2 players would be willing to visit the city.

Meanwhile, just how many Tier 3 experts were there in God’s Domain right now?

“Crap! Does Zero Wing take us for fools?!”

“Zero Wing really has gotten arrogant! A ten-Silver entrance fee? Does Zero Wing really think we need to develop in the Orc Empire?”

A large number of Tier 2 players complained about Silverwing City’s entrance fee, some even ranting in rage. Previously, they could continue operating within the Faux Saint monsters’ territory only because it did not cost any money to enter Silverwing Town. By collecting a ten-Silver entrance fee now, Zero Wing was basically chasing Tier 2 players like themselves away from Silverwing City.

In the meantime, a heavy atmosphere shrouded a 1,000-man team standing some distance away from Silverwing City’s main gate.

“Vice Commander, an entrance fee of 10 Silver is simply too much. If we have to pay such a fee, after deducting all our daily expenses, our Tier 2 brothers will earn almost nothing. I suggest we head somewhere else to develop. It is simply impossible for us to continue developing in Silverwing City,” a Level 107, Tier 2 Berserker said as he looked at Solid Wind.

“I truly did not think that Zero Wing would be so ruthless. We should’ve followed suit with the other adventurer teams and headed to one of the kingdoms or the Dark Night Empire to develop,” a Level 113, Tier 3 male Elementalist grumbled.

“Wind, this price is indeed too high. We can’t afford it in the long term. Why don’t we head to the Dark Night Empire and take a look there? I heard that there are Guild Cities established in Level 100-plus neutral maps there as well. Moreover, those cities are also collecting a ten-Silver entrance fee,” Crazed Bull suggested.

Many other members of the Blood Pact adventurer team nodded their heads in agreement. Compared to paying ten Silver to Zero Wing for no good reason, it would be much better to spend that ten Silver in a Guild City located in a Level 100 neutral map. They would definitely gain a much better harvest there than in the Orc Empire.

“Alright, then. However, we still have some quests we need to turn in,” Solid Wind said, sighing. “Bull, you and a few others will follow me inside. Everyone else, wait outside.”

The other Blood Pact members nodded in acknowledgment of Solid Wind’s instructions.

Aside from Blood Pact, the other adventurer teams made similar decisions, delegating the submission of their completed quests in the city to a handful of Tier 3 experts while planning to leave the Orc Empire entirely or head to one of the Guild Towns to continue developing within the empire.

Following which, despite the large number of players gathered outside Silverwing City, only a small number of Tier 3 experts actually entered the city.
