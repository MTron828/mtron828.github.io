Regional System Announcement: Congratulations! A team has successfully killed Tosas, the All-Consuming Demon. The Northern Badlands’ teleportation passage will open in 24 hours. All players may use it to travel to other regions.

All-Region System Announcement: Congratulations! A team has successfully killed Tosas, the All-Consuming Demon. The Primordial Divine Kingdom’s Taboo Legacy Land’s activation progress has reached 3%.

Upon receiving the system notifications, everyone snapped out of their daze and revealed ecstatic expressions.

“Hooray! We did it!”

“We’re the first team to kill a Taboo Boss! Our names will be remembered in the libraries across the various regions!”

“It’s not just in libraries! This is an all-region system announcement! The whole world will know of us now!”

…

Initially, none of Dragon’s Crown’s chosen ones were confident about killing Tosas. This remained true until the very last moment. After all, Taboo Bosses were symbols of invincibility in their world. Many powers and legendary teams had tried to kill them but never succeeded. In comparison, they were merely a bunch of chosen ones nurtured by Dragon’s Crown. Even if the Taboo Boss they fought was only Level 239, they were still unlikely to kill it.

Unlike the rest of their guildmates, Purgatory Jade and Kowloon Demon weren’t immersed in the excitement of killing a Taboo Boss. Instead, their attention was on the details of the all-region system announcement.

“The activation progress of the Primordial Divine Kingdom’s Legacy Land?” Kowloon Demon was shocked and excited. “I see! No wonder we could never gain access to that place!”

The Primordial Divine Kingdom’s Legacy Land had always been a sore point for the two royal powers of this world. It was also why nobody in this world could break through the limits of Tier 6.

But now, the Legacy Land had finally been activated. Although the activation process had only reached a meager 3%, it was a momentous step that could affect their entire world.

“It seems we won’t have any peace for the foreseeable future,” Purgatory Jade sighed. Nobody had placed much importance on raiding Taboo Bosses in the past because there weren’t any concrete benefits. Now that everyone knew the connection between the Taboo Bosses and the activation of the Primordial Divine Kingdom’s Legacy Land, the various powers would undoubtedly start hunting Taboo Bosses like there was no tomorrow. Naturally, the various powers would also pay special attention to the players who successfully raided a Taboo Boss. “Kowloon, did you say we only have a hundred slots for going to that other world?”

“Mhm. We can send only a hundred people there each time, and they can stay there for only three days,” Kowloon Demon answered.

“In that case, we must extend our partnership with Black Flame. The best-case scenario is to thoroughly tie Black Flame to us,” Purgatory Jade said after some thought. “That other world’s various methods are the key to raiding Taboo Bosses.”

“I understand.” Kowloon Demon nodded in agreement.

They had narrowly defeated Tosas. If not for Shi Feng luring Tosas out with his large-scale Destruction Spell and suppressing it with the help of the NPC he summoned, they never could have achieved victory.

It should be known that Tosas was the weakest Taboo Boss in their world. The Taboo Bosses of other regions were all Level 240 or above. If they wanted to raid those Taboo Bosses, they had to have the weapons, equipment, and tools of Shi Feng’s world.

While Purgatory Jade and Kowloon Demon conversed, Shi Feng leveled up twice and reached Level 218 following Tosas’s death. Red Frost and the others also leveled once.

“This Taboo Hunter title is incredible! Just having it equipped increases my Basic Attributes by 15%! The bonus is even doubled against Taboo Bosses!” Twilight Leaf exclaimed at her new title.

“It is indeed powerful. Even if we aren’t facing Taboo Bosses, it’ll be like gaining five extra levels on our weapons and equipment,” Red Frost commented. “I am currently at Level 231, but my Basic Attributes are comparable to those of the old fellows at Level 236.”

While his party members happily discussed the Taboo Hunter title, Shi Feng turned to Tosas’s corpse.

When Tosas died, it didn’t just contribute abundant EXP. It also dropped five items. Although this was a pitiful amount, all five items dropped were extraordinary. Even the weakest one radiated Divine Might at the Ancient God standard. The most eye-catching of the bunch—a blood-red crystal the size of a basketball—even caused the surrounding space to collapse with its mere presence.

Is that the Taboo Nucleus? Shi Feng subconsciously licked his lips as he looked at the blood-red crystal, excitement coloring his eyes.

The Taboo Nucleus was one of the key components for advancing to Tier 7, and only Taboo Bosses dropped it. Now that he had a Taboo Nucleus, 100 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, and the Inferior Divine Tier 7 Promotion Land Scroll, he finally had all the prerequisites to challenge his Tier 7 promotion.

If he wanted to, he could enter his Tier 7 Promotion Land this instant!

However, Shi Feng quickly suppressed the impulse.

Although he could indeed challenge his Tier 7 promotion right now, his current chances of success probably didn’t reach 10%. If he wanted a better chance at getting promoted to Tier 7, he had to kill the Undying Mother and receive the Abyss Workshop’s assistance. Otherwise, he would only waste his Taboo Nucleus and Promotion Land Scroll.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, the Boss has dropped five items: a Taboo Nucleus, two ancient tomes, and two pieces of equipment of unknown quality,” Kowloon Demon said as he approached Shi Feng. Then, he abruptly suggested, “According to our original agreement, we will split the loot 50/50, and you will have priority to pick the first item. But we managed this great feat only thanks to your trump cards, so how about you pick three items while Dragon’s Crown takes the remaining two?”

Kowloon Demon would be lying if he said he wasn’t interested in the Taboo Boss’s loot. However, considering that Shi Feng was Dragon’s Crown’s only recourse to access the outside world’s resources and the only reason they managed to complete the raid, he might as well use the loot to deepen Dragon’s Crown’s ties with Shi Feng.

“Since you said so, I will gladly take you up on your offer, Brother Kowloon,” Shi Feng said without reservation.

Shi Feng never even dared to think about raiding a Taboo Boss in his previous life, much less obtaining the loot of one. Every item dropped by Tosas was extremely precious, so he was more than willing to accept Kowloon Demon’s favor.

He immediately walked up to Tosas’s corpse and picked up the Taboo Nucleus without hesitation. Only after doing so did he turn his attention to the four remaining items.
