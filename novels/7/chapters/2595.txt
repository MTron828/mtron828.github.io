Chapter 2596 – Mighty Zero Wing, Times Have Changed Stone Forest City, Zero Wing’s Residence:

Long Wushang and Hermit sat by the French window, clearly unhappy, in Zero Wing’s large, luxurious reception room.

“So you’re saying that Guild Leader Black Flame has no intention of meeting us, Commander Rush?” Long Wushang demanded, glaring at Hell Rush, who had just notified them of Shi Feng’s reply. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“That’s right. He knows what you wish to discuss and requested that I relay a message. Once the family competition is over, he will personally take Silent Wonder to visit Violet Sword, so you don’t have to bother,” Hell Rush coolly informed the two men, nodding.

The message stunned both of them, particularly Long Wushang.

Long Wushang had considered many possible outcomes before visiting Zero Wing’s Residence, and had prepared a variety of arguments to persuade Shi Feng to let Silent Wonder go. However, he never considered that Shi Feng would simply refuse to meet with them, turning them away...

However, what truly surprised the bald man was the fact that Hell Rush had followed Shi Feng’s instructions, conveying the message personally.

The alliance between Netherworld Empire and Zero Wing was no longer a secret among the various superpowers, especially after the battle at the Dark World’s Teleportation Gate. That battle had exposed the relationship between the two Guilds.

Hell Rush, however, was a famous Slaughtering God on the western continent. He even commanded Netherworld Empire’s strongest trump legion. Even Violet Sword’s Guild Leader would have to take him seriously, yet, he obediently played the role of Shi Feng’s messenger...

“Good! Since Guild Leader Black Flame understands the situation, we won’t overstay our welcome!” Long Wushang decided after calming himself. He then stood to leave the room with Hermit.

After they left Zero Wing’s Residence, the air around Long Wushang dropped a few degrees, becoming so cold that nearby players shivered. Even the Azure experts that had tagged along shuddered as Long Wushang’s frosty aura swept over them

“To think that even the famous Hell Rush would obey Black Flame.... I hadn’t expected Zero Wing to have such a close relationship with Netherworld Empire. Violet Sword might make concessions if they find out about this,” Hermit surmised, glancing at the twisted expression his comrade was making.

“Concessions?” Long Wushang laughed. “I admit that Zero Wing is clearly close with Netherworld Empire, but after all is said and done, they are only allies. Zero Wing has barely any power in the west, while Violet Sword is a titan. It is obvious who holds the advantage on the western continent. How much help would Netherworld Empire possibly be willing to offer Zero Wing?

“Moreover, this matter involves Violet Sword’s future and prestige. The Guild won’t budge just because of Netherworld Empire’s interference. Violet Sword aims to join the Five Great Super Guilds, after all. So what if Zero Wing and Netherworld Empire are close allies?

“And as for Black Flame’s plan to negotiate with Violet Sword personally, that’s nothing more than fool’s talk!”

“Regardless, we have, more or less, completed our goals here. Will you return now?” Hermit asked.

“Of course, I am returning,”. Long Wushang growled, sneering at Zero Wing’s Residence. “Violet Sword has already warned the Long Family. Since Black Flame wants to be stubborn, he can’t blame me for passing his message on to Violet Sword. I can’t wait to see his confidence vanish!”

Long Wushang then left Stone Forest City and promptly returned to the western continent. He planned to inform the rest of his family and Violet Sword of everything that had happened.

Shortly after Long Wushang’s group left, Silent Wonder received news of Shi Feng’s reply.

“You’re not really planning to visit Violet Sword, are you, Guild Leader?” Silent Wonder asked as she watched Shi Feng’s image on the screen before her.

Refusing to meet with her fifth uncle might have been fine, but Shi Feng was playing with fire by declaring that he’d resolve the matter personally.

Zero Wing had become a titan in the east, but its roots were still weak on the western continent. Trying to convince the Zeus Corporation and Violet Sword to abandon their plans would be impossible with the power Zero Wing currently commanded.

If this matter weren’t handled carefully, Zero Wing could become the Zeus Corporation’s enemy, which wouldn’t be good news for the Guild.

“I’ve already committed to it, so naturally, I’ll pay Violet Sword a visit,” Shi Feng declared. “And we’ll be going in style!”

“Going in style?” Silent Wonder could not help but wonder if Shi Feng had finally gone mad.

They were talking about Violet Sword, and the meeting venue would be in the west. Once the Super Guild learned about today’s events, whether or not they reached Violet Sword’s headquarters alive would be a problem, not to mention arriving in style.

“I’ve heard that Azure’s younger generation has been invited to train with Violet Sword? Since that is the case, you should take a break from potion making and focus on training in the Lost Town,” Shi Feng said, paying Silent Wonder’s exasperated expression no mind. “We’ll show your family and Violet Sword Zero Wing’s strength!”

“But there are only a few days left before the family competition. I’m afraid it’s too late to start training now...” Silent Wonder complained.

Her trust in Shi Feng’s abilities, particularly his ability to help players level up, was unwavering. He had proven this with Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s main force members.

However, the upcoming competition wouldn’t be in the form of a standard duel between players. Rather, it would be a competition of combat standards and techniques.

The Azure Chamber of Commerce considered weapons and equipment to be external strength. The chamber was powerful enough that acquiring the best items was only a matter of time. Hence, Azure didn’t need its younger members to rely on items, but their potential.

However, one couldn’t just improve their combat standards and combat techniques in a short time. They would have to train arduously for long periods.

Now, there were only six days left until the family competition. Seeking a qualitative transformation within such a short time was simply unrealistic.

Moreover, while her combat talent was outstanding among Azure’s younger generation, she was nowhere close to a match for the top geniuses that devoted themselves to combat.

From what she had learned during the previous competition in Demonstone Town, two of the younger generation were already close to the Domain Realm. One individual had already reached the Domain Realm. In contrast, she had only reached the Half-step Void Realm standard. There was no way she could defeat those geniuses.

“I know, but beggars can’t be choosers. Besides, combat comes in various forms,” Shi Feng said, realizing Silent Wonder’s concerns. “In any case, just make your way here. I’ve already given you access to the Lost Town. You can head to the Residence to purchase a Transfer Scroll.”

“Alright, I’ll leave immediately,” Silent Wonder agreed. Since Shi Feng was so confident, she had no choice but to follow his wishes. She had grown massively during her stay with Zero Wing, and she couldn’t possibly sully the Guild’s name. Following which, she left the Candlelight Trading Firm and made her way to Zero Wing’s Residence.
