Chapter 3778 - 852 - Divine War Begins

When Heiser saw the two flame dragons before her, shock, desire, and doubt overwhelmed her. She even forgot to resist. All she did was mutter a question.

“You are…a Mortal God?”

Mortal God. This was a realm that Heiser could only dream of achieving, even after developing her own Advanced Gold Combat Technique. It was also the dream of countless players in the Greater God’s Domain.

Unfortunately, she couldn’t even find information on the World Tower’s sixth floor after scouring the Greater God’s Domain, not to mention information on Mortal Gods.

Yet, a living, breathing Mortal God now stood before her. After all, apart from a Mortal God, she couldn’t think of any other kind of expert that could simultaneously execute two Advanced Gold Fusion Techniques.

The difficulty of executing an Advanced Gold Fusion Technique was greater than even that of Peak Gold Combat Techniques. Even as a Half-step Mortal God, Heiser found executing a Peak Gold Combat Technique difficult. Naturally, a Twofold Peak Gold Combat Technique was out of the question.

Since Red Frost could accomplish such an impossible feat, it could only mean one thing.

Red Frost was an expert who had reached the sixth-floor standard!

Red Frost was a Mortal God!

However, before Heiser could get confirmation from Red Frost, the two flame dragons devoured her, and she was already outside the ring when she regained her senses.

…

Am I hallucinating? Did I just see a Twofold Advanced Gold Fusion Technique?

Watching from his VIP room, South Lake couldn’t help but rub his eyes as he looked at the battlefield. However, no matter how many times he had the system replay the match, the outcome did not change.

Silence!

South Lake’s room wasn’t the only place enveloped in silence. At this moment, time seemed to have stopped for the whole arena as the spectators stared at Red Frost, their faces colored with shock, excitement, and disbelief.

How?! How is this possible?! How did she reach the legendary sixth-floor standard?!

Ember Dragon gazed at Red Frost like he was meeting her for the first time, his eyes brimming with desire and disbelief.

In the human race’s Greater God’s Domain, anyone who was an executive of a pseudo-apex power or above would know that there wasn’t actually much of a difference in the combat standards of their strongest members.

Not to mention Half-step Mortal Gods, even experts who could develop their own Gold Combat Techniques were as rare as a phoenix’s feather among pseudo-apex powers. As for Half-step Mortal Gods who could develop their own Advanced Gold Combat Techniques, this was already the limit that apex powers could achieve. For this reason, Half-step Mortal Gods were typically key representatives or individuals with substantial influence in apex powers. They were the true foundation of apex powers.

As for the Mortal Gods of legend, if any apex power had an expert of this caliber, it would have already become the sole ruling power in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

This was because a sixth-floor expert’s technical knowledge was an irresistible temptation to experts who had reached the limits of the fifth-floor standard. Even if a sixth-floor expert was poorly equipped and low-leveled, many fifth-floor experts would still seek to become their follower, hoping to receive pointers and watch them fight up close.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that so long as a Mortal God issued a summons, countless experts would come together and form an organization of epic might and proportions under the Mortal God. Holy Dragon Spear would be nothing but a joke compared to such a behemoth.

…

A sixth-floor expert! Frost is a sixth-floor expert! Xiao Yilong grew ecstatic after realizing Red Frost’s combat standard. Then, he turned to Shi Feng and eagerly asked, “Guild Leader Black Flame, is Red Frost a sixth-floor expert already?”

Although Red Frost’s performance made it clear she was a Mortal God, Xiao Yilong still couldn’t help but turn to Shi Feng for confirmation. He felt that only Shi Feng could give him the real answer.

“Yes. Commander Frost reached the sixth-floor standard not long ago,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “Presently, she is the undisputed number one in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain when it comes to combat standards.”

Shi Feng could empathize with Xiao Yilong’s shock and excitement. He vividly remembered how shocked he was when the first Mortal God appeared in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

After all, this was a sign that human players could achieve greater heights!

“Great! This is great!” Xiao Yilong laughed, unable to contain his excitement any longer. “With this, the Elders, the Grand Elders, and even the Great Commander must stand with us!”

A Mortal God!

So long as Holy Dragon Spear’s Elders and Grand Elders had a functioning brain, they would know what this meant. As for the partnership with the Dragon God Palace, how could it compare to the humongous benefits Red Frost could bring Holy Dragon Spear?

…

“It is my loss. I shouldn’t have expected less from a genius the old commander admires,” Heiser said, taking the initiative to approach Red Frost when she saw the latter walking out of the ring. Then, she tentatively asked, “Can I ask for a chance to receive your guidance?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Guidance?” Red Frost was a little surprised when she saw the anxiety in Heiser’s eyes. She hadn’t expected her opponent to be so straightforward and innocent. Nodding, she said, “Of course.”

“Thank you.” Heiser couldn’t help but smile when she heard Red Frost’s answer.

Subsequently, after Heiser reluctantly made her way to the spectator stands, Twilight Leaf and the other chosen ones of Holy Dragon Spear swarmed Red Frost. They all expressed their wish to receive guidance from Red Frost in the future. Suddenly, the highly anticipated Battle of the Chosen Ones became an exhibition match.

However, nobody from the audience voiced any complaints about this change. On the contrary, everyone was more than happy to see Red Frost fight every participant.

…

“It seems there’s no longer a need to decide who is number one,” South Lake said, smiling wryly as he looked at the chosen ones surrounding Red Frost.

“Indeed,” the old man beside South Lake said, chuckling. “Now, our Great Commander should carefully consider how he should compensate our number one chosen one. Otherwise, she might very well lose her temper and leave Holy Dragon Spear. If that happens, his days as the Great Commander will be over.”

“You…” South Lake rolled his eyes at Apocalypse. “Fine. Isn’t it just making an enemy out of the Dragon God Palace? What’s there to be afraid of?”

However, before South Lake and Apocalypse could continue their conversation, the defensive magic array protecting Flame Vein Holy City suddenly shattered, and multiple space-time passages appeared above the city. Immediately afterward, Level 220-plus, Tier 6 NPCs and players flew out of these space-time passages in an orderly formation, forming an army of half a million in no time.

When the players in Flame Vein Holy City saw the two NPCs lead the army, they couldn’t help but be shocked.

Grand Duke of the Imperial Ice Empire, Hawke Barron, a Level 244, Tier 6 NPC!

Grand Marshal of the Five Saints Empire, Highgate the Heavenly Dragon, a Level 242, Tier 6 NPC!

“What’s going on?”

“Why are the two empires here?”

“Did the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty join forces?”

The army above the city consisted of NPCs and players from the Imperial Ice Empire and the Five Saints Empire. Members of two pseudo-apex powers, specifically the Dragon God Palace and the Divine Wing Dynasty, were also among its ranks. When Flame Vein Holy City’s players saw this, they were dumbfounded.

Regional System Announcement: The Imperial Ice Empire and the Five Saints Empire have declared war on Flame Vein Holy City. Flame Vein Holy City’s City Lord has requested assistance from all players in the Holy City. If the city wins the war, players will be awarded Contribution Points to exchange for treasures from the city’s treasury. If the city loses the war, all players will have their Flame Vein Holy City Reputation Points and ownership of the city’s real estate reset.

TL Notes:
Made a change to Chapter 844:
Original:
The Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboo Bosses were not equals. In fact, there was a huge disparity in strength among them. For example, the 22nd-ranked Taboo was only strong enough to give Ancient Gods a headache. The 14th-ranked Undying Mother, on the other hand, was a disaster that could devour Ancient Gods.

Corrected version:
The Greater God’s Domain’s Twenty-Two Taboo Bosses were not equals. In fact, there was a huge disparity in strength among them. If one were to consider the 22nd-ranked Taboo to be only strong enough to give Ancient Gods a headache, the Undying Mother would be a disaster that could devour Ancient Gods.
