Chapter 3254 - Chapter 328 - First Paragon?

Chapter 328 – First Paragon?

“First?” Lightning Chaser forgot to breathe when he heard Desolate Fury’s words. “Impossible!”

The Ancient River Kingdom might have been in a weak state for many years already, but those capable of ranking among the top 10 of the kingdom’s younger generation paragons were all extraordinary individuals. Even a peerless genius like Desolate Fury would be swiftly killed if he tried to fight any of the Ancient River Kingdom’s Ten Great Paragons in a one-on-one duel.

More importantly, it had already been a long time since the Ancient River Kingdom had officially crowned the title of “First Paragon” to anyone. Even a paragon as powerful as Saint Three was only known as one of the Ancient River Kingdom’s top three paragons. A specific ranking for the top three paragons did not exist in the Ancient River Kingdom.

Yet, now, Shi Feng was given the title of First Paragon after only one battle. No matter how Lightning Chaser looked at it, this news must be a joke.

!!

It should be known that when a kingdom decided to crown a player as its First Paragon, it meant that this player possessed the highest combat power out of all Tier 4 players operating within the kingdom. This player would become an expert that even the kingdom’s various hegemonic powers would have to treat respectfully. During kingdom wars, this player would also wield considerable authority and the right to select participants for the war.

It was no exaggeration to say that a kingdom’s First Paragon was an important individual who could decide the direction of the kingdom’s development.

Although Shi Feng had indeed slain Markless Blade and repelled three veteran paragons, his achievements should only be enough to get him recognized as one of the Ancient River Kingdom’s top three paragons. It didn’t make sense that he would be designated the position of First Paragon.

“It’s a logical decision for the Ancient River Kingdom to regard him as its First Paragon.” When Desolate Fury saw that Lightning Chaser refused to believe his words, he explained, “According to the Alliance’s investigative report, Black Flame has perfect mastery over a Saint-ranked Mana Technique. This factor alone is more than enough to qualify him for the position of the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon.”

Lightning Chaser thoroughly fell silent when he heard the mention of a Saint-ranked Mana Technique. At this time, he even started to feel a little fearful.

The achievement of perfectly mastering a Saint-ranked Mana Technique was far more frightening than becoming the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon. Even the various conglomerates would extend an olive branch to Shi Feng once they learned about this achievement.

If the Ancient River Kingdom’s First Paragon represented the peak of a kingdom’s genius, the perfect mastery of a Saint-ranked Mana Technique represented the future birth of an apex powerhouse in God’s Domain.

With such an achievement under Shi Feng’s belt, even the Heavenly Boa Guild would come to fear him, let alone Saint Three. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Suddenly, Lightning Chaser’s face twisted with expressions of regret and madness.

“Why? Why did things turn out like this?”

Even though Lightning Chaser had already become an official successor of the Extreme Eagle Corporation, he still wasn’t certain whether he could become first in the line of succession in the future. So, it was crucial for him to form as many connections with powerful experts as possible. Yet, now, he had actually cast aside the opportunity to get acquainted with a future apex powerhouse…

…

While Lightning Chaser was mired in regret, Shi Feng, Midsummer, and Wu Xiaoxiao finished killing off two Tier 4 Heroic Spirits in a small forest and stopped in front of a six-meter-tall stele.

“The two of you are Elementalists, so the Mana Technique recorded on this stele suits you perfectly. WIth our current damage output, it’ll be tough for us to collect enough Heroic Spirit Remnants in three days. It just so happens that we’ve collected six Heroic Spirit Remnants, so you two can use them to learn the Mana Technique on this stele. So long as you can learn the Mana Technique, our party will have a much easier time moving forward,” Shi Feng said as he pointed at the dilapidated stele in front of him.

“A Mana Technique that suits us?”

Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but look at the dilapidated stele before them strangely and worriedly.

If it was a Mana Technique suitable for magical class experts, it was most likely one that could provide a huge boost in combat power.

However, the ancient stele before them was clearly much more damaged than any other stele they had come across. In the Ancient River Secret Land’s central zone, the more dilapidated a stele was, the more difficult it would be to learn the Mana Technique recorded on it. Meanwhile, as long as they failed to learn the Mana Technique within a specified time, they would automatically forget what they’ve learned, wasting precious time they could have spent collecting Heroic Spirit Remnants.

“Don’t worry. The Mana Technique recorded on this stele isn’t particularly complex. It’s only a God-ranked Mana Technique. With your mastery over mana, you two should have no trouble learning it within the alotted time,” Shi Feng said, chuckling when he saw the worry on Midsummer’s and Wu Xiaoxiao’s faces. “Moreover, I have some matters I need to deal with offline. Since you two aren’t going to log out, you might as well use this time to learn the Mana Technique here.”

“It’s only a God-ranked Mana Technique?”

Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao felt relieved when they heard Shi Feng’s words. Immediately, they took out the Heroic Spirit Remnants they had collected and contributed them to the dilapidated stele.

Many of the Mana Techniques recorded in the central zone’s ancient steles were Saint-ranked Mana Techniques, and it was nigh-impossible for players to learn them within the allotted time.

However, it was a different story for God-ranked Mana Techniques. It was entirely possible for players to learn a God-ranked Mana Technique within the allotted time. In fact, one of the main reasons many geniuses sought to enter the Rookie Competition’s top 100 was so that they could learn a God-ranked Mana Technique.

When Shi Feng saw the two girls starting their learning process, he called up his system interface and chose to log out of the game.

There were no Heroic Spirits in the area. By now, everyone also knew that he and his party were active around these parts. So, hardly any parties were willing to come close to this area, and the two could study with ease.

As for the Mana Technique the two were learning, there was something he had neglected to tell them.

It was true that the Mana Technique recorded on dilapidated stele was only at the God rank. However, it wasn’t just any ordinary God-ranked Mana Technique. Instead, it was the Mana Cohesion Method created by the God of Four Elements, one of the Twelve Great Gods in God’s Domain.

So long as Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao could learn the Mana Cohesion Method, they could elevate the density of their mana to a whole new level. They could condense gaseous mana into liquid mana and liquid mana into solid mana. They could even use Seven Luminaries Crystals to amplify their Spells, strengthening the power of an ordinary Spell to the level of a Super Spell of the same tier.

Because of the Mana Cohesion Method’s incredible effects, it was also one of the most complicated God-ranked Mana Techniques to learn.

During Shi Feng’s previous life, a Tier 4 expert over 100 years of age had learned the Mana Cohesion Method. With the Mana Technique’s assistance, he had become a dangerous individual known throughout the Starlight Realm. Sometime later, he had even joined the apex power Demon’s Gate.

Honestly, Shi Feng was mostly trying his luck by getting Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao to learn the Mana Cohesion Method. He didn’t have high hopes for them to succeed. As for why he chose to take such a gamble, it was because he truly had matters he needed to tend to in the real world. Gentle Snow and Hidden Soul would be arriving in the Greater World today, so he needed to get their living arrangements sorted out. Hence, he decided he might as well have Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao try to improve their strength as much as possible. If they succeeded in learning the Mana Cohesion Method, they would have a much easier time killing Heroic Spirits and collecting Heroic Spirit Remnants afterward.
