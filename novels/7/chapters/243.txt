Chapter 244 - Establishing the Guild

At this moment, there was a crowd of players surrounding the Quest Board in the lobby of the Adventurer’s Association.

Although the EXP awarded by these quests were negligible, the Guild Reputation they gave was very high. Moreover, each player was limited to only three Guild Quests a day.

A Guild could be promoted after it accumulated a set amount of Reputation, and the members of the Guild would receive much better Guild benefits such as bonus EXP when doing Quests.

“Excuse me, sir, what can I do for you today?” the blue-haired lady standing behind the reception counter asked Shi Feng, a smile on her face.

“I wish to establish a Guild,” Shi Feng said.

“Understood. Please fill up this application form.” The receptionist passed Shi Feng a Guild application form.

It was very easy for players to establish a Guild in God’s Domain. Players only needed to decide on a name for their Guild and designate a Guild Emblem. They were then required to purchase a Guild Certificate for 10 Copper Coins and have at least seven independent players place their signatures on it. When all these things were completed, the Guild would then be officially established.

Newly founded Guilds would all start out as 1-Star Guilds, and the only benefit available for the members of a 1-Star Guild were the availability of the Guild Quests.

“Guild name, is it?” Shi Feng hesitated as he looked at the blank space meant for the Guild’s name, wondering what he should write in exactly. After giving it some thought, he decided to stick with using the Zero Wing Workshop’s name. In any case, along with the Guild’s development and growing fame, his identity would sooner or later be leaked. “Let’s name it Zero Wing, then.”

Shi Feng then designed the Guild Emblem in the form of six silver wings.

After purchasing the Guild Certificate, Shi Feng sent Fire Dance and the others a Guild Signature invitation.

Meanwhile, at the Black Wind Canyon, a Level 20 to Level 25 map, Fire Dance and the others were currently grinding on Level 22 Demonic Bats. They had come to this place under the suggestion of Shi Feng.

The reason Shi Feng had recommended it was because the Demonic Bats here belonged to the type of monsters that had high Attack but low HP. Most importantly, the monsters here were concentrated in number. Normally, the Demonic Bats would appear in groups of seven or eight, and any solo independent player would easily find themselves losing their lives here. However, to a party that had amazing AOE damage, this place was a holy land for leveling up.

In the case of Fire Dance’s party, Fire Dance herself was responsible for luring the monsters, as she had the highest Movement Speed out of everyone in the party. She would lure over a hundred monsters every time, and afterward, the Guardian Knight, Cola, would activate Protection Blessing and cast Devotion, a group aggro skill, to gather the monsters into one location. Meanwhile, Violet Cloud would be responsible for healing Cola, while Blackie would get rid of all the monsters in a single blow.

Throughout this process, everyone’s cooperation and grasp of timing was perfect.

If other players were to witness this scene, they would definitely be shocked into a daze.

Presently, the average level of players was only at Level 12 or so, while professional players would be around Level 13. Even the number one player on White River City’s Ranking List, Lone Tyrant, was only at Level 15 right now.

Yet, Fire Dance and the others had long since passed Level 15. Even the lowest leveled player in the party, the Oracle, Gluttonous Mouse, was Level 18. Meanwhile, Blackie, who was the highest leveled player in the party, was currently at 45% of Level 19. Although there was only a gap of one level between the two players, the difference in EXP could allow a player to directly rise from Level 0 all the way up to Level 15.

“Huh? What is this message?”

While taking a break, Fire Dance and the others simultaneously received a Guild Signature invitation. As long as they agreed to the invitation, they would immediately become official members of the Guild after the Guild was established.

Originally, Fire Dance and the others had intended to immediately reject the invitation. However, their hands unanimously paused when they saw the name of the Guild.

“Zero Wing? Isn’t that the name of our Workshop?” Blackie asked, curious.

“This is an invitation sent by Big Brother Ye Feng! Big Brother Ye Feng is finally going to establish the Guild!” Violet Cloud said excitedly when she noticed that one of the names inscribed on the Guild Certificate was Ye Feng. She then said with joy, “Great! We will have our own Guild in the future!”

“Isn’t it still too early to establish the Guild? We only have so few members right now. Brother Feng had also said before that we are lacking in members, and that we need to wait for some time before establishing the Guild. Did something happen?”

“Don’t bother about this for now. We should put our signatures first.” Fire Dance was similarly surprised by Shi Feng’s sudden decision. However, since Shi Feng had decided to do so, he must have had his own considerations. Moreover, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to establish the Guild ahead of time.

Immediately, everyone in the party clicked “Agree.”

They then received a system notification.

System: Congratulations on becoming a member of Zero Wing!

System: This is your first time joining a Guild. Activating Guild System.

On the other side, Shi Feng had already left the Adventurer’s Association, returning to the Starstreak Trading Firm.

At this moment, the Starstreak Trading Firm was packed with players. The trading firm was currently the most lively location in White River City, second to none.

“Hey, bro, I see that you’re here to buy those Basic Mana Armor Kits, right? With so many people lining up here, you would need to wait at least a week before you can even get one for yourself. However, I have here a way to help you save your time, letting you jump the queue to buy the Mana Armor Kits in advance.” A thinly built Swordsman walked around the entrance of the Starstreak Trading Firm, chatting up the players lined up outside the building.

“Really?” A player clearly grew interested.

“Of course. A Basic Mana Armor Kit costs 20 Silver Coins, while you only need to pay 2 Silver Coins to skip the long wait to buy it,” the thin Swordsman said with a smile.

“Alright, bring me there. It’s just an extra 2 Silver Coins. Our party won’t miss this little amount of money.”

Following which, the thin Swordsman led the player up to the second floor, skipping the long queue on the first floor.

“Really, any sort of business goes, huh?” Shi Feng couldn’t help but exclaim after seeing this sight.

The Basic Mana Armor Kits were in high demand. However, the Starstreak Trading Firm only sold 50 pieces of the item each day, so only a very small number of players could obtain them.

However, this couldn’t be helped. Shi Feng couldn’t just focus all his attention on producing the Basic Mana Armor Kits. He still had many things he needed to do.

The Basic Mana Armor Kit was simply an item for him to accumulate reputation. It was not meant to be a true money-maker for him.

Afterward, Shi Feng arrived at the fourth floor of the trading firm and entered a Forging Room. He then started forging the Arclight Shield.

During this crucial period, many Guilds were thinking of how they could obtain the First Clear of a 50-man Team Dungeon. Naturally, the equipment of their MTs became the top priority in their considerations, especially the shields their MTs used. Meanwhile, an excellent shield like the Fine-Gold ranked Arclight Shield would, without a doubt, attract the attention of these Guilds.

As long as Shi Feng placed the Arclight Shields up for sale, many Guilds would definitely pay a huge sum in order obtain it.

Hence, the sooner he produced the Arclight Shields, the higher the price he could sell them for.

However, the success rate for forging a Fine-Gold ranked item was extremely low.

A normal Advanced Forging Apprentice only had a 2% success rate, meaning that, out of 100 tries, they would only successfully produce two Arclight Shields. In reality, however, they might not even be able to produce one out of 100 tries.

However, Shi Feng had both the Book of Forging and Blacksteel’s Insignia. He also had the Ice-Blue Devil Flame and various other tools that increased his forging success rate. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even so, his final success rate at forging a Fine-Gold ranked item only sat at around 20%. In addition, Shi Feng was not familiar with the forging process of the Arclight Shield, so his success rate should be much lower than 20%.

If he was promoted to a Basic Forger, his base success rate would increase to 5%. However, that still wouldn’t make much of a difference. Only by becoming an Advanced Forger would there be a significant improvement. With the 10% base success rate of an Advanced Forger, in addition to the various supporting tools Shi Feng had, his success rate for forging a Fine-Gold ranked item could reach up to 30%.

However, Shi Feng needed to invest a lot of time in order to become an Advanced Forger, and time was something he sorely lacked right now. He had no choice but to give it a try now. In any case, he had plenty of materials to experiment with. He could simply try again if he failed.
