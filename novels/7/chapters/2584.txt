Chapter 2585 – Small Problem, Raid Begins!

Cold Spring Forest, Stone Forest City:

After acquiring the Disaster Blade, Shi Feng decided to leave Poison City immediately, using a Return Scroll to teleport back to Stone Forest City’s Freedom Hotel.

As he and his team appeared in the hotel lobby, they attracted a lot of attention from the hotel’s guests. Although most of the team members had hidden their statistics and auras under Black Cloaks, some hadn’t.

As a result, a heavy pressure bore down on the players in the lobby when the team returned. It was even stronger than that of Level 110 Great Lords, with some players radiating even more pressure than Level 110 Grand Lords...

“Crap! Aren’t these players’ auras a little too strong?! They feel even stronger than superpowers’ teams I’ve met before! Who are these people!?”

“Look, those NPCs are acting so respectfully before the Swordsman in the lead. Could that be the grinding team Black Flame led out of the city earlier?”

You might be right. Usually, those NPCs are even indifferent toward Gold Members. I suspect they’d only show respect to someone of Black Flame’s standing.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The players in the lobby fell into a heated discussion about Shi Feng’s team, and many independent players watched on in envy.

Now that Zero Wing controlled the Dark World’s Teleportation Gate, Stone Forest City was officially a sacred leveling ground for regular players. Countless players from various kingdoms and empires swarmed toward the city. Just entering the city had become a problem, not to mention renting a room in the Freedom Hotel.

Zero Wing’s members, however, did not have these problems. They didn’t have to stand in line to enter the city or fight for a room in the Freedom Hotel. Their Guild had already reserved rooms for its members. Moreover, Zero Wing’s normal members received a 40% discount if paid for their rooms with GCPs, while core members received a 50% discount.

These were the reasons that more players constantly sought to join the Guild. And to ensure that the Guild could continue its normal operations while providing the same benefits, Zero Wing had further increased the recruitment requirements. Countless players regretted not joining sooner.

Meanwhile, it wasn’t long after Shi Feng’s team had returned that the various powers within the city heard about it.

“Black Flame’s finally back?” Dawn Dominance, who had concealed himself with a Black Cloak and rested in one of the Freedom Hotel’s rooms, sneered as he read the latest report from his subordinate. “It seems he’s increased the combat power Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s members by quite a bit. It’s a pity that he’s too late. Demon’s Heart’s team has almost pinpointed the third Boss’s weaknesses. It’s only a matter of time before they defeat it and move on to the Final Boss.”

“Guild Leader, Flaming Light has reported that those people are now in Cold Spring Forest. Should we leave?” a Level 109, Tier 3 Elementalist asked from beside Dawn Dominance.

“Good. Yes, we’ll head over immediately. I want to see just what kind of powerful individuals Flaming Light has invited to declare that he can help World Domination take control of the Dark World,” Dawn Dominance said, nodding.

Following which, Dawn Dominance left Stone Forest City with his subordinates, making his way to Cold Spring Forest’s outer region.

At the same time, the various superpowers operating secretly in Stone Forest City only snickered at Shi Feng’s return. So what if Zero Wing controlled the Dark World’s Teleportation Gate?

In the end, the Dark World’s players would still reach the main continent in droves, and now that Zero Wing was their enemy, the Guild would suffer once they arrived. Nowhere would be safe for Zero Wing’s members outside of Cold Spring Forest.

Upon his return, Shi Feng instructed the NPC manager to arrange an advanced lounge for the team to rest.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, Demon’s Heart has already begun to raid the third Boss, yet you want to rest here...?” Blue Rainbow anxiously complained.

Although they were fatigued from their trip to Poison City, players would recover a significant fraction of their Stamina and Concentration when they leveled up. After that Final Boss, they had all leveled twice, so the team was in relatively good condition. They were more than capable of starting their raid in the Ancient God’s Tower.

Yet, Shi Feng had told them to rest for now almost as if he were afraid that Demon’s Heart didn’t have a strong enough lead.

“No. Your Stamina and Concentration might be fine, but the secret land’s death energy is still corroding your bodies. The Ancient God’s tower also has powerful foreign energy. On the off chance that these energies cause too much damage before you clear the trial, all of your efforts will go to waste. It’d be better to rest here for a while, rather than take such a risk. You can use the time to drink the Exotic Legacy Potions you’ve obtained, as well,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head.

“But the time...” Shi Feng’s insistence did nothing to calm Blue Rainbow’s worries.

The future of their two Guilds was at risk. If Demon’s Heart’s alliance captured the first floor before they could, their Guilds wouldn’t survive in the Dark World for long.

“I doubt there will be any issues if you take full advantage of that potion,” Shi Feng said, chuckling.

Neither the dropped weapons and equipment nor the awarded Legacy Skill Points were the team’s greatest reward. Instead, it was the Exotic Legacy Potions.

When players normally slew Poison City’s Bosses, each Boss only dropped one or two Exotic Legacy Potions. Furthermore, those Bosses only respawned after three days. Knowing this, it was easy to imagine how valuable the potions were.

However, because the team had completed the Inferior Legendary Quest, every member had been awarded one bottle.

Although a single Exotic Legacy Potion might not help someone fully unlock their Mana Body, in combination with the Freedom Hotel’s astounding environment, it would help these players unlock a sizable percentage. That percentage alone would grant a massive boost to their combat power since it tremendously improved their Skills and Spells’ power.

However, Shi Feng’s advice confused Blue Rainbow and Elder Gold. What did he mean by ‘take full advantage?’

Of course, he had a point. While their consecutive leveling had cleansed them of a portion of the foreign energy, much still remained. If this energy and the energy within the tower corroded too much of their bodies halfway into the raid, they’d be doomed.

Blue Rainbow and Elder Gold immediately stopped wasting time. They instructed all of their players to move to the reserved lounge, rest, and consume the Exotic Legacy Potions.

In total, the team rested for over an hour. Once they felt refreshed, Blue Rainbow and Elder Gold hurried toward the Dark World’s Ancient God’s Tower with their respective Guilds’ main force members.

By the time the group arrived, another four hours had passed.

The Ancient God’s Tower had seven floors and was over a thousand meters tall. Players, whom the Dark World’s various powers had stationed to guard the entrance, didn’t try to stop the group when Blue Rainbow and Elder Gold arrived. They simply stepped aside and let the force enter the tower, notifying the team within of their arrival.

Meanwhile, a six-meter-tall, Level 113 Mythic ranked Ore lay lifeless before Demon’s Heart’s team within an ancient city on the Ancient God’s Tower’s first floor.

“Elder Heart, our scouts have located the fourth ancient city,” a Level 110, Tier 3 Dark Ranger reported, approaching Furious Heart. “In addition, our brothers at the entrance have informed me that Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s members have entered the tower.”

“They’ve finally decided to show up?” The report surprised Furious Heart. “How many people did they send? Are Zero Wing’s members with them?”

Their team had already defeated the first floor’s third Boss and located the Final Boss. He found it surprising that the two Guilds would bother to show up now. They must have brought powerful support with them and were confident of surpassing the alliance team’s progress.

“Just a little over 200. We didn’t see any of Zero Wing’s members or the outside world’s players among their team,” the Dark Ranger reported.

“Just a little over 200? Have those Guilds lost their minds?” For a moment, Furious Heart wondered if he had misheard the Tier 3 Dark Ranger.

Demon’s Heart’s alliance had sent over a thousand Tier 3 experts just to increase their chances of raiding the Ancient God’s Tower!

What could a measly 200-plus Tier 3 experts possibly accomplish?

“Should we send our spies to find out more?” the Dark Ranger asked.

“No need. To think they would dare enter the tower with so few players, do they think this is some kind of playground?” Furious Heart said, shaking his head. Chuckling, he continued, “Let them struggle. They’re only fools if they thought they could rely on Zero Wing. Once we finish our raid, we’ll make them regret their decision!”

With that, Furious Heart commanded his team to head toward the Final Boss. He completely disregarded the matter involving Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society.

In the meantime, Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society’s main force members stopped before the doors to the Ancient God’s Tower’s first floor.

“Alright, let’s start the raid!” Blue Rainbow exclaimed, glancing over the team.
