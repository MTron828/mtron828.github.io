Chapter 2811 – Changes to Sky Spring City

Twin Towers Kingdom, Sky Spring City:

Accompanied by several bright flashes, three cloaked figures appeared in the city’s Teleportation Hall. These three figures belonged to none other than Shi Feng, Lifeless Thorn, and Solitary Nine.

The sight of a massive crowd of players greeted the trio upon arrival. At a glance, they could estimate that the building held over 10,000 players. The place looked much more prosperous than even the Teleportation Hall of the Twin Towers Kingdom’s royal capital.

The majority of the players present were Tier 3 and sported Guild Emblems belonging to various Guilds. These players all radiated a cold killing intent, which created a strange atmosphere inside the Teleportation Hall.

“Why are there so many Guild experts here?” Solitary Nine was surprised as he took in the surroundings. “Even Dragonheart City’s Teleportation Hall is far from comparable to this place!”

From what Solitary Nine could tell, quite a few of these Tier 3 experts were at the Refinement Realm standard. Even among the superpowers, Refinement Realm experts were treated as core members. However, he counted more than 500 Refinement Realm experts just in the Teleportation Hall alone-around the number of Refinement Realm experts an average superpower possessed.

“Friends, you must’ve just arrived in the Twin Towers Kingdom, right? I’ll have you know that this day might very well go down in the history books of God’s Domain,” a robust, Tier 3 Berserker said, smiling as he walked out of the teleportation array.

This Tier 3 Berserker had reached Level 122. He was fully equipped in Level 120 Fine-Gold Equipment and carried a Level 120 Dark-Gold Axe on his back. Based on equipment alone, he could rank among the top of Tier 3 players.

Moreover, this Berserker did not wear a Guild Emblem. This meant he was an independent expert. Being able to secure himself such high-quality equipment was a testament to his capabilities.

The dozen or so players following after the Berserker possessed similar equipment standards. Since everyone in the group had a white lion symbol marking their equipment, they evidently were members of the same adventurer team.

“Go down in God’s Domain’s history?” Stunned by these words, Solitary Nine asked curiously, “Friend, we have indeed just arrived in this kingdom. Do you mind telling us what’s going to happen here today?” “Our White Lion adventurer team just received news of this as well. It seems that Starlink somehow managed to recruit the help of some Tier 4 NPCs, and these NPCs captured around a dozen Guild executives from Zero Wing, Unyielding Soul, and Crimson Emperor during a fight at a blockade. These Guild executives are currently imprisoned in Starlink’s Residence,” the robust Berserker said. “Starlink has announced a crusade against Zero Wing’s blockade at the Secret Covenant Tower and is calling for all powers to gather in Sky Spring City. Starlink is also demanding the three Guilds remove the seal on Sky Spring City. Otherwise, it’s going to use the captured executives as a sacrifice as an opening gambit.

“I heard that besides Zero Wing’s Alluring Summer and Shadow Sword, even Unyielding Soul’s Vice Guild Leader Mu Lingsha and Crimson Emperor’s up-and-coming talent Blue Gown were captured. If the three Guilds don’t concede, Starlink will have the Tier 4 NPCs kill these people using a method that will harm their souls. Not only will these people suffer increased death penalties, but they will also enter a weakened state for a long period. There’s even a possibility that their accounts will get crippled.”

Upon hearing the Berserker’s words, Shi Feng frowned slightly. He never thought that the Secret Hand Association’s Tier 4 NPCs would actually interfere in this matter.

“How bold of Starlink. It dares wag its tail in Zero Wing’s territory and even use the three Guilds’ executives as a sacrifice?” Shi Feng sneered.

“I know, right? But you have to admit that Starlink is no longer the same as before. Rumors have it that Starlink has three Tier 4 players, as well as several superpowers backing it. Now, it even has an NPC force supporting it. In terms of influence on the eastern continent, even the Five Great Super Guilds can’t compare to Starlink now.” The robust Berserker nodded. “As our White Lion adventurer team is quite well-known in the Twin Towers Kingdom, we received an invitation to take part in the crusade. Hence, we decided to come to expand our horizons. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Moreover, I heard that the three Guilds’ executives would be making an appearance as well. If negotiations sour, it will definitely lead to the biggest battle in God’s Domain’s history!”

“I see.” Shi Feng nodded.

After listening to the Berserker, Shi Feng roughly understood what Starlink was planning

Simply put, Starlink was trying to show off its strength with this operation. One of its reasons for doing so was to deal with Zero Wing, Unyielding Soul, and Crimson Emperor.

Another reason was to present itself as an existence rivaling the Five Great Super Guilds. Hence, it had invited so many powers to take part and witness the operation.

“Friends, Sky Spring City is a mess right now. If you’re trying to enter that rumored Secret Covenant Tower, I’m afraid you visited the wrong city. Moreover, many superpowers are keeping a close eye on the tower right now. If independent players like ourselves are not careful, we might get treated as one of the three Guilds’ members. If that happens, things will get troublesome.” Looking at Shi Feng’s group of three, the robust Berserker cautioned, “You might get killed, if you’re lucky, or captured, if you’re unlucky. So, it’s best to be careful.”

“Thank you for the warning,” Shi Feng said.

After Shi Feng finished speaking, he left the Teleportation Hall with Lifeless Thorn and Solitary Nine.

After Shi Feng’s group departed, a male youth from the Silver Lion adventurer team looked at the robust Berserker in confusion and asked, “Boss, why did you start talking to those strangers all of a sudden?”.

“It’s nothing. I just thought that those three felt extraordinary. The more friends you have, the more options you have in life. It hasn’t been easy for our adventurer team to grow to its current state. If we manage to befriend some experts, it will only benefit us,” the robust Berserker replied, chuckling as he looked at the departing figures of Shi Feng’s group. “Also, that cloaked Swordsman looks quite familiar, though I can’t remember who he is at the moment.”

“Extraordinary? Familiar?” Snickering, the youth said, “Boss, everyone who visits Sky Spring City is at Tier 3. Which one of them isn’t an expert? It’s also normal to think that you’ve met someone familiar. After all, everyone looks mostly the same while wearing a Black Cloak. Honestly, I doubt that those three are anything amazing. After all, they came here without even knowing about the crusade. They also didn’t receive an invitation from Starlink. They are probably experts from some backwater city.”

Experts were a dime a dozen in God’s Domain nowadays. However, only a small portion of these experts could make a name for themselves. Meanwhile, any of such experts operating in the Twin Towers Kingdom and the neighboring countries would have received an invitation from Starlink. The fact that Shi Feng’s group didn’t proved that they were only ordinary experts unworthy of the White Lion adventurer team’s attention.

Meanwhile, outside the Teleportation Hall...

“Commander, are we going there now?” Lifeless Thorn asked when he saw that Shi Feng wasn’t heading for Zero Wing’s Residence.

“Starlink has invited experts from all over for a crusade and is even planning on using Zero Wing’s executives as sacrifices. How can I not go there to congratulate it?” Shi Feng said, rolling his eyes at Lifeless Thorn.

Shi Feng made his way to Starlink’s magnificent and luxurious Residence that stood on the city’s main street.
