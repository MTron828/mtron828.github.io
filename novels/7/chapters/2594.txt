Chapter 2595 – True Ascension Realm

Lost Town, Extraordinary Tower’s second floor:

As Shi Feng ascended the staircase to the third floor, more and stronger Swordsmen continued to appear. On the 1st step, he had only faced two Silver Swordsmen. When he reached the 89th step, his opponents were four Golden Swordsmen.

Not only had all of these Golden Swordsmen commanded combat standards nearly on par with the Refinement Realm, but all four had reached the Truth Realm, as well. Combining both aspects, their combat power was far stronger than ordinary Refinement Realm experts. Moreover, the four Golden Swordsmen’s coordination was as seamless as if they shared one mind. There were no gaps in their offense or defense, and they all possessed incredible Basic Attributes. Even Shi Feng struggled to cope with the Golden Swordsmen’s assault.

If he hadn’t had Sword’s Transmigration to defend himself, these Golden Swordsmen would’ve long since thrown him back down the staircase.

I can easily handle these Swordsmen one-on-one, but avoiding their coordinated attacks with the physique of a Tier 1 player is impossible. It seems my only option is to force my way through!

After three minutes of fighting these four Golden Swordsmen, Shi Feng realized that continuing this battle was a waste of time. He couldn’t find any weaknesses to take advantage of. The only method he could think of to reach the next step was to force his way past these Swordsmen.

Following which, Shi Feng stepped forward and sucked in a deep breath. He then raised the Abyssal Blade above his head, gathering Mana around the weapon.

A phantom of a gigantic greatsword immediately appeared above him. Although the Extraordinary Tower suppressed his physique to that of Tier 1, it did nothing to hamper his Mana Body. He could easily command his own Mana in combat.

In retaliation, the four Golden Swordsmen launched a joint attack, aiming for 16 of Shi Feng’s weak points. Before they had a chance to strike, Shi Feng swung down the Abyssal Blade.

Lightshadow!

Boom!

After the phantom greatsword’s descent, all four Golden Swordsmen stumbled back several steps, falling out of formation. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Shi Feng charged at the nearest opponent.

His target reacted quickly. Although the Golden Swordsman hadn’t regained its posture, it used a horizontal slash in an attempt to stop Shi Feng’s charge.

However, Shi Feng didn’t give the Golden Swordsman a chance to defend itself as his Sacred Sword transformed into a streak of light, deflecting the horizontal slash. He then thrust the Abyssal Blade at the Golden Swordsman’s chest.

Peng!

Sparks flew as the Fragmented Legendary Weapon collided with the Golden Swordsman’s armor, shoving it back a few more steps before it fell. Finally, Shi Feng tore a hole in the four Golden Swordsmen’s formation.

Now!

With his target on the ground, Shi Feng used Void Steps to confuse the three remaining Golden Swordsman and escape their encirclement. He then leaped onto the 90th step.

The moment Shi Feng landed on the 90th step, a Swordsman in black robes appeared before him. This Black Swordsman then thrust his weapon at Shi Feng.

The thrust was surprisingly powerful, and the instant the Black Swordsman’s blade shot forward, it transformed into numerous particles of light that shot toward Shi Feng. It was impossible to tell which attack was real and which was fake.

An Advanced Combat Technique? Shi Feng’s expression darkened when he recognized the move as a combat technique.

This Black Swordsman’s Basic Attributes and combat standards were even higher than the Golden Swordsmen Shi Feng had just faced. In fact, the Black Swordsman was on the cusp of reaching the Flowing Water Realm. Combined with its Advanced Combat Technique, Shi Feng was no match for this opponent with just a Tier 1 physique.

Of course, this disadvantage wasn’t enough to make Shi Feng give up. Instead, he brandished Killing Ray in response.

Sword’s Transmigration!

The instant the two weapons met, a deafening boom echoed throughout the second floor. The impact was so powerful that Shi Feng stumbled back down to the 89th step. He hadn’t had time to readjust his posture, and the four Golden Swordsmen he had left behind subsequently threw him back down to the base of the second floor’s staircase.

The 90th step’s Black Swordsman is amazing. I saw no excess movements, and it perfectly integrated an Advanced Combat Technique. Not even Domain Realm experts could find any opening to take advantage of and would be forced to face its attacks head-on.

Shi Feng wasn’t disappointed about returning to square one. Actually, he seemed rather excited. The Black Swordsman had highlighted some of his own flaws.

He had reached the Realm of Truth’s Ascension Realm, and his every action resembled a combat technique, but they weren’t. His movements lacked the power of combat techniques; they only possessed the deception of true combat techniques.

To put it simply, he hadn’t made much progress in the Ascension Realm, and his foundations were unsteady. He had only grasped the vague concept of the realm, lacking its crucial concepts.

The Black Swordsman, on the other hand, stood firmly in the Ascension Realm.

Because of this, Shi Feng couldn’t yet ascend to the Extraordinary Tower’s third floor, despite having reached the Ascension Realm.

If he could gain even a portion of the Black Swordsman’s mastery over the Ascension Realm and perfectly integrate Basic Combat Techniques with his every action, his combat power would definitely rise by a large margin.

Meanwhile, during the time Shi Feng was reflecting on his own flaws, a few other Zero Wing members were sent flying down the second floor’s staircase as well.

“I did it! I finally did it!” Shadow Sword shouted ecstatically as he looked at the dense Mana his body radiated.

Turtledove, Alluring Summer, and the others who had fallen down the stairs similarly radiated dense Mana. They had obviously unlocked their Mana Bodies’ full potential.

Moreover, Blue Frost, Flying Shadow, Stubborn Bone, and a few other Zero Wing members, who had only begun to unlock their mana Bodies, revealed excited expressions. They had made significant progress during their climb on the Extraordinary Tower’s second-floor staircase.

Training in the Extraordinary Tower is really this effective? Shi Feng looked at the players around him, astonished.

While the Extraordinary Tower’s Mana provided quite a bit of help to players developing their Mana control, Shi Feng didn’t think it’d be such an effective tool in helping them unlock their Mana Bodies. Learning the rules and how to manipulate Mana wasn’t an easy task, not to mention adapting those methods to one’s Mana Body.

Shi Feng estimated that although Shadow Sword and the rest had been close to unlocking all of their Mana Bodies’ potential, they should’ve still needed three to five days to reach 100%.

And yet, they had succeeded in less than half a day...

If every one of Zero Wing’s main force members could make this much progress, every one of them would fully unlock their Mana Bodies in less than 10 days, becoming true powerhouses in God’s Domain.

Just as Shi Feng turned his attention back to the second floor’s staircase, however, he received a call from Melancholic Smile.

“Guild Leader, Azure’s representatives have come to our Residence. They wish to speak with you about taking Wonder to develop in the west’s Violet Sword. They’re hoping we won’t ‘hinder her future’ and just let her go. They visited Wonder before coming here, too, but it seems Wonder’s reaction wasn’t positive,” Melancholic Smile reported.

Violet Sword, huh?” Shi Feng could not contain his smile. “Azure is certainly crafty.”

“Will you meet with them?” Melancholic Smile asked.

“That won’t be necessary. Have Hell Rush send them away. Also, have him convey a message; I’ll personally take Wonder to visit Violet Sword after the family competition to have a proper conversation with the Super Guild’s people, so they don’t need to bother!” Shi Feng calmly stated.
