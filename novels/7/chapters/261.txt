Chapter 262- We Are Very Strong

Aqua Rose was shocked.

“They are the eight players at the top of the Ranking List?” Aqua Rose whispered in silence.

Although she did not use any identification skills on these players, aside from the top eight players, she could think of no other members of Zero Wing that could possibly possess such excellent equipment.

“Yeah.” Shi Feng nodded his head. He then started inviting Fire Dance and the others into his team.

There were a total of 17 players in Fire Dance’s team. Aqua Rose had also brought along a good friend of hers, Icy Fruit. Aqua Rose had chosen her upon Shi Feng’s request for a healer who was Level 15 or above.

Shi Feng had exactly 20 members in his team now. Of them, two were MTs. One of them was the Guardian Knight, Cola, while the other was Ye Wumian, who was a Shield Warrior. There were also a total of four healers in the team. It was a standard composition for a 20-man Dungeon-raiding team.

Just as Shi Feng was about to enter the Dungeon, another team came walking over to the Dungeon’s entrance.

The members of this team were out of the ordinary. Let alone possessing Mysterious-Iron Equipment as their lowest ranked equipment, there were also several of them with Secret-Silver Equipment. This was a sight impossible to be found in an independent team.

Yet, contrary to expectations, these players were not Guild players but independent players. None of them wore a Guild Emblem on their bodies.

“War Wolf!” Fire Dance said in astonishment when she saw the slim-looking man walking over.

“Oh? Is it an acquaintance?” Whether it was his memory of this life or his past life, Shi Feng had no recollection of the man who looked to be the leader of this team.

However, if these players were able to come into possession of such quality weapons and equipment, they could definitely be considered an expert team. In theory, they should not be unknown existences.

Could they have stopped playing midway in the past? Shi Feng inwardly wondered.

“Hello. We meet again,” War Wolf said in greeting, looking at Fire Dance. “After not meeting for some time, I never imagined that Miss Fire Dance would have joined a Guild.”

“No. In truth, we were originally members of this Guild. It was only due to some complications that we did not establish the Guild before,” Fire Dance explained. “Let me introduce you. This man here is our Guild Leader, Black Flame.”

“What a shock. So it turns out that Your Excellency is none other than the famous Chief Forger of Star-Moon Kingdom, Black Flame.” War Wolf was somewhat taken aback by this revelation. Although he had long since known that Fire Dance and the others were not ordinary players, never would he have thought that their Guild Leader would be such a well-known character.

“Team leader War Wolf is the one who has left me in shock. You are actually starting to raid the Level 15, 20-man Team Dungeon already. The teams that are capable of diving into the Demon’s Castle at this time definitely belong to the apex of White River City.” Although Shi Feng had never heard of War Wolf before, a person capable of leading such a team definitely would not be a mediocre person. Shi Feng suddenly had the urge to recruit this team of players.

“Fortunately. We are only an independent team, and it’s impossible for us to compete with those Guilds over the First Clear of the Three Great Dungeons. So, we can only choose to come here. Since Guild Leader Black Flame has something to do, we won’t continue bothering you.” War Wolf did not possess any good feelings towards Guilds, so he immediately brought his team into the Dungeon after speaking a few perfunctory words.

“This person’s attitude is really weird. The previous time we met, he was welcoming when he spoke to us. Now, he only said a few words before taking his leave. Isn’t this change in attitude a little too much?” Blackie said in an unhappy tone.

“He probably doesn’t like Guilds too much.” Shi Feng revealed a helpless smile as he looked at War Wolf entering the Dungeon.

There were all kinds of people in God’s Domain, and naturally, there were bound to be some who disliked Guilds. After all, most Guilds usually acted in an overbearing manner. Many players just wanted to experience the world of God’s Domain, so they weren’t all that interested in Guilds.

Meanwhile, many of these players who were wholeheartedly chasing after adventure were surprisingly powerful. Among them, the most famous adventurer team in the past was the Midnight Tea Party. Although there were only twenty-plus members in the team, not a single Guild in God’s Domain dared to underestimate this adventurer team. Even Super Guilds had to draw a clear line with the Midnight Tea Party, both sides minding their own businesses.

Obviously, War Wolf belonged to this type of adventurer.

I guess it can’t be helped. Everybody has their own aspirations, Shi Feng silently lamented.

“There sure are a lot of powerhouses in White River City.” Aqua Rose was astonished to find that there were actually so many crouching tigers and hidden dragons in White River City.

Soon after, Shi Feng and the others had also entered the Demon’s Castle. However, Shi Feng had chosen a different difficulty from War Wolf’s team’s.

Hell Mode, a difficulty that made all players pale when they talked about it. Yet, Shi Feng had chosen it without much thought.

Aqua Rose was momentarily rendered speechless. She couldn’t stand it anymore. Shi Feng was always taking unconventional actions.

This was the Hell Mode of a 20-man Team Dungeon! At the very least, they should have started with Normal Mode to familiarize themselves with the Dungeon. They could then start accumulating better equipment from Hard Mode, before finally challenging Hell Mode. However, Shi Feng had started with Hell Mode right from the very beginning. Just what did he think of a Hell Mode Dungeon?

Even if they had powerful experts in their team, they couldn’t just be so reckless. Did Shi Feng forget the fact that almost half of the members in this team still didn’t possess particularly good equipment?

Meanwhile, these players in question were none other than the Five Demon Generals and the four experts from Green Leaf Workshop. Although they had already reached Level 15, and were also fully geared in Mysterious-Iron Equipment, they were still far from reaching the requirement to raid the Hell Mode of the Demon’s Castle. Hence, these nine players reacted with panic when they realized Shi Feng’s decision. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As this was Hell Mode, the monsters inside the castle all received an upgrade. Even the normal Elite monsters could cause one to tremble. Meanwhile, such monsters were wandering around in groups inside the castle corridors.

[Demon Maid] (Elite Rank)

Level 15

HP 80,000/80,000

Good at magical attacks, particularly fire-type damage.

[Demon Butler] (Elite Rank)

Level 15

HP 100,000/100,000

Good at melee attacks.

Of these two types of monsters, the Demon Butlers were more difficult to deal with, as they would ignore aggro when they used Charge. In addition, when their Charge connected, they would also inflict a DoT debuff called Blood Curse, causing players to continuously lose HP. Also, due to this being Hell Mode, the debuff was further strengthened. When afflicted with this enhanced Blood Curse, players would lose 300 HP every three seconds, and receive 10% additional magic damage for 30 seconds. The debuff was also stackable up to 10 times.

To make matters worse, demonic beings were born with high magic resistance, making them extremely difficult to deal with.

“Alright, Cola, go pull some monsters. Ye Wumian, you’ll act as support for Cola. Healers, pay attention to the MT’s HP and remember to cast Dispel when necessary. As for everyone else, just focus on your damage output,” Shi Feng instructed casually.

“Guild Leader, I suggest that we should take things slowly. After all, this is a Hell Mode Dungeon, not a Normal Mode. Even if Cola’s equipment is excellent, we still can’t act so recklessly.” Aqua Rose was close to collapsing from Shi Feng’s carefree attitude.

“It’s okay,” Shi Feng said, smiling. “We are very strong!”

Shi Feng had a clear grasp on the strength of this team, hence his carefree and confident attitude.

Cola was currently Level 18, and with the Arclight Guard equipped, his HP had already reached 3,340 points. His Defense was even a frightening 2,300 points. In terms of Attributes, not a single MT within White River City could match him.

The Elite monsters inside the Dungeon were only at Level 15. With three levels of suppression, these monsters could hardly harm Cola at all.

Meanwhile, Cola did not hesitate in carrying out Shi Feng’s orders. Immediately, he rushed at a group of monsters, raising his shield and throwing it at them. In a blink of an eye, the shield struck five Elite monsters, causing over 300 damage and placing a Silenced effect on each of the monsters, preventing them from using magic for six seconds. Shortly after, the shield returned to Cola’s hands.

Before coming to this Dungeon, Cola had experienced luring over a hundred Level 25 monsters. Of them, there had been no lack of Elite monsters. Compared to those times, the few Elites before him were hardly worth mentioning. These demonic monsters simply had slightly higher HP and slightly more powerful skills.

“All of you, come over!”

Cola executed Justice Roar, compelling monsters within a fixed range to attack only him. Letting out angry roars, the Demon Maids at a distance had no choice but to attack Cola. As if he had transformed into a steel wall, Cola fully blocked the charge of the three Demon Butlers and four Demon Maids. Cola then used the group aggro skill Devotion. As the sacred aura provided by the skill dealt holy damage, it inflicted amplified damage on the seven demons. Every second, the seven demons would receive 200 holy damage. Before long, the aggro Cola had on these monsters was unshakably stable.

On the other hand, the Demon Butlers only dealt around -240 damage with each of their attacks, while the Demon Maids dealt around -400 damage with their magical attacks. However, Cola managed to dodge the majority of these attacks by utilizing his nimble footwork, greatly reducing the damage he received. As a result, only Violet Cloud was actually required to maintain Cola’s HP above a safe threshold.

Meanwhile, the other healers and Ye Wumian could only watch helplessly on the sidelines.

“No way.”

Aqua Rose’s delicate body trembled slightly. Currently, the excitement she felt could no longer be described with words.
