Chapter 358 - Cornered Beast

Although Shi Feng knew that these Assassins intended to use the Six-star Extermination Magic Array, it was too late for him to stop them.

In the next moment, the crystal balls released a dazzling purple glow. Purple flames then burst forth, enclosing Shi Feng and the six Assassins within a barrier of purple fire.

This barrier only covered a small area of 30*30 yards. With their levels, it would only take a few steps to cross this distance.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, since you so arrogantly offended the Star Alliance, we’ve come to teach you some manners.”

“Tiger, what’s the point of talking to him? He is merely a frog at the bottom of a well. How could he possibly know how amazing our Star Alliance is? Let’s finish him off immediately. Boss Red Feather is waiting for us.”

“I’m trying to give him some time to mourn his own loss! Now that the barrier has been activated, nobody can possibly interrupt us. We can take our time dealing with him since there’s no way for him to escape anyway.”

“You’re right. Wouldn’t it be boring if we killed this insufferably haughty Guild Leader Black Flame in just two to three hits?”

“Does Guild Leader Black Flame have any last words? Hahaha!”

The six Assassins chatted merrily among themselves. They looked at Shi Feng as if he were an ant. It was as if everything was within their control, and victory was already within their grasp.

The Six-star Extermination Magic Array was a magic barrier that possessed several restrictions. Unlike a normal Magic Scroll, activation required six players. Moreover, once the barrier was cast in a specific location, excluding the six wielding the crystal balls, it would randomly choose one player within range and trap them within. As for everyone else who was within the magic barrier’s range at the time of activation, all would be sent out of the magic barrier including players, NPCs, and monsters. After erecting the magic barrier, not even an army of tens of thousands could penetrate it. The same went for those inside the magic barrier; they could not leave. The magic barrier would only dissolve itself when the targeted player died, or the six activators were annihilated. In addition, while the barrier did not impose restrictions on the six casters, the targeted player, on the other hand, was banned from using any skills.

To any player in God’s Domain, losing one’s skills was like a tiger losing its claws and fangs. It was similar to how Shi Feng could one-sidedly massacre hundreds of players after activating Absolute Time, a regional silencing skill.

Although part of the reason Shi Feng could achieve such a feat was due to his frightening combat power, the regional silencing skill Absolute Time played a similarly large role.

Currently, Shi Feng had to face six Level 20 Assassins who were capable of using all their skills. He was also trapped in this barrier until he defeated these six elite players. One could just imagine how dire the situation was.

“What a pity,” Shi Feng sighed as he looked at the purple flames surrounding him before shifting his gaze towards the six Assassins.

Normally, the Six-star Extermination Magic Array was used to deal with high-tiered mage-type Bosses. Compared to a high-tiered Magic Scroll, although Barrier Crystals possessed many restrictions, players could use it within a Dungeon. On the other hand, Tier 3 Magic Scrolls like the Water Dragon’s Flurry were useless inside a Dungeon.

At this moment, however, these six Assassins had used such a precious Barrier Crystal to deal with a single Swordsman like Shi Feng. The word “waste” could not even begin to describe their actions.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, so even you know the word ‘pity’? It would indeed be a pity if we were the only ones to witness your death. However, you can rest assured that we will upload a video of your death to the forums, showing everyone the end of your undying legend.

“When that time comes, Guild Leader Black Flame, you should not blame us for your ruin. Instead, blame yourself for being too arrogant and greedy. You actually dared to oppose the Star Alliance.”

The six Assassins laughed maniacally, having already foreseen how Shi Feng would become the laughingstock of God’s Domain in the near future. As for the six of them, after killing Shi Feng, they, too, would instantly become the focus of Star-Moon Kingdom.

Saying so, the six Assassins immediately activated Stealth and advanced on Shi Feng.

However, Shi Feng was a step ahead. Without the slightest bit of panic or hesitation, Shi Feng dashed towards the six Assassins with frightening speed.

The strength of Assassins lay in death from the shadows. If exposed, however, they were only half as dangerous. Knowing this, Shi Feng darted forward without hesitation and sliced up the six Assassins.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

Six clangs of metal clashing resounded inside the magic barrier, and the Assassins who had just entered stealth were immediately exposed. Enraged, they glared at Shi Feng. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Black Flame, no matter how much you struggle, the result will be the same! Since you want to die an early, let me fulfill your wish!” a tanned and short Assassin named Grey Squirrel tightened his grip around one of his daggers and jabbed it at Shi Feng’s abdomen. With even greater speed than before, Grey Squirrel drew a strange arc with his other dagger, sliding it smoothly towards Shi Feng’s side.

Under normal circumstances, players would instinctively try to defend against the first attack and neglect the dagger from the side. Even if they managed to discover the second dagger, their instincts would still focus on the first.

This deliberate misdirection clearly displayed how skilled this Assassin named Grey Squirrel was. He was not an ordinary player but an expert.

As long as the Assassin’s blade found its mark, Shi Feng would enter a Fainted state. At that time, he would be at the Assassins’ mercy. They could simply incapacitate him indefinitely until he died.

Moreover, while Grey Squirrel attacked Shi Feng, the other two Assassins beside him had also aimed their daggers at the Swordsman.

The three remaining Assassins standing at a distance, however, had not taken action. On the contrary, they simply stood there, watching with ridiculing smiles.

In their opinion, Shi Feng was just a cornered beast struggling to stay alive. His initial charge was simply his last-ditch effort at survival.

Just when the two daggers from Grey Squirrel were about to penetrate into Shi Feng’s body, Shi Feng shifted his footsteps slightly and retreated half a step, effortlessly evading the two daggers. Immediately, he spun sideways, escaping the pincer attack of the two Assassins behind him. The entire process was as smooth as flowing water without any excess movement.

The Assassins were inwardly startled.

Shi Feng had actually evaded their perfect joint attack with such simple motions.

Shi Feng’s quick-witted response left the six Assassins shivering slightly. However, he couldn’t care less about his enemies’ thoughts. Without a pause, Shi Feng brandished the Abyssal Blade and the Purgatory’s Shadow, sending over a dozen afterimages slashing at the three Assassins. Shi Feng’s swords moved with lightning speed, the three Assassins emitting ear-piercing screeches as the blades found their vital points.

The three attacking Assassins were greatly shocked by this counterattack. In a panic, they hurriedly used their daggers to defend themselves, even going as far as using Block.

Although all three of them managed to defend against the afterimages sent at them, Shi Feng’s superhuman strength forced them into a retreat, the clash leaving their hands numb.

“Such speed and strength.”

At this moment, these three no longer dared to underestimate Shi Feng. During their brief exchange, they could tell how powerful Shi Feng was. Normally, when the three of them attacked together, even Red Feather would temporarily retreat rather than face them directly. However, Shi Feng had done the exact opposite and fought them head-on. Surprisingly, he even forced them into a retreat. If they had not combined their strengths to block Shi Feng’s attacks just now, they might have joined the many souls who had died under Shi Feng’s swords.

All six of the Assassins instantly came to a conclusion.

Although the Shi Feng before them had lost his fangs and claws, he was no tiger. He was a monstrous beast clad in human skin. He could easily suppress them by only relying on his strength. Faced with Shi Feng, only death awaited them.

Suddenly, the Assassins realized that they had made a massive mistake. They had actually chosen to lock themselves up with such a monstrous beast....

As expected, it isn’t possible to get rid of them quickly without the 100% speed boost from Purgatory Power. Shi Feng’s onslaught had failed to achieve its intended purpose, though it did allow him to gain a general understanding of his attackers’ strengths. In conclusion, these Assassins were definitely experts.

The three Assassins had exposed many holes in their defenses after Shi Feng shook them off. Hence, he brandished his blades once more, intending to strike the iron while it was hot and finish them off before they could reunite with their other companions. At this time, however, the other three Assassins had already circled and arrived behind Shi Feng. They immediately launched a flurry of attacks, giving Shi Feng no choice but to stop his attacks and deal with the immediate threat first.

Shi Feng abruptly spun around, swinging his swords with all his might at the three new arrivals. Like before, his attack sent all three Assassins flying. Shi Feng then charged at the Assassin in front of him, brandishing his swords multiple times. The Assassin receiving Shi Feng’s attacks was greatly frightened. Immediately, the Assassin used Silent Steps, hoping to take advantage of the short period of invulnerability the skill provided to defend against all these sword flashes. By doing so, he could also gain some precious time to allow his companions to come to his rescue. Otherwise, only death awaited him.

The Assassin’s decision to use Silent Steps had undeniably given his five other companions plenty of time to react. After regaining their composure, the five Assassins immediately dashed at Shi Feng, forcing him into a momentary retreat.

“We can’t let this continue. We can’t hold back any longer. All of you, use the Berserk Potion,” Grey Squirrel commanded.

The other five looked at one another and nodded silently. At the same time, they all took out blood-red potions. This potion was none other than the extremely precious Berserk Potion. Originally, this potion was a last resort. They never thought that they would have to use it so quickly.
