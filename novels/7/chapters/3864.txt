Chapter 939 – Overlimit Skill

As King’s Paradise’s members surrounded Ink Crystal’s team, their eyes shone with eagerness, as if they hadn’t witnessed Ink Crystal’s display of power. Lunar River, the leader of King’s Paradise’s team, even appeared within 20 yards of Ink Crystal.

“As expected of the expert who killed Garuda. I didn’t think you’d be able to detect us from such a distance,” Lunar River said, smiling at Ink Crystal as she played with her ponytail. “Garuda was our original target, but since you’ve killed him and detected us, we’ll have you become our new prey, Miss Ink Crystal!”

Lunar River’s words caused a deathly silence to befall the area. Even Extreme Feather and the other surviving members of the Thunder Empire couldn’t help but stare at Lunar River in disbelief.

“How dare she?” Hidden Soul was similarly astonished as she looked at Lunar River from a distance.

Everyone who had witnessed Ink Crystal’s fight with Garuda should know how terrifying her strength was. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to call her a walking disaster.

While Lunar River’s team might hold the numerical advantage, it wasn’t big enough to offset Ink Crystal’s strength advantage. After all, Ink Crystal was directly responsible for destroying one-third of Plot 079’s land. She might not even break a sweat dealing with King’s Paradise’s 500-plus members.

When Savage Gods’s members finished processing Lunar River’s words, many burst into laughter, as if they had just heard the funniest joke in their lives.

“You want to treat us as prey? Are you sure you’re not biting off more than you can chew?” Desert River scoffed. Without waiting for Ink Crystal to express her stance, he swung his stone cane at Lunar River.

Suddenly, a powerful compression acted on the space within a radius of several hundred yards, compressing it to the tip of Desert River’s cane. The King’s Paradise members within the affected area felt as if they carried a mountain on their backs, their bodies becoming indescribably heavy. All they could do in this situation was watch as Desert River’s stone cane came bearing down on Lunar River.

Peak Gold Fusion Implement Manipulation Technique, Spatial Blast!

This was the same technique Desert River had used against Extreme Feather previously. He was going all-out immediately, not intending to show mercy to Lunar River.

However, even as Desert River’s cane descended upon her, Lunar River did not attempt to dodge or block it. Instead, she reached for the jet-black greatsword on her back and executed the Tier 6 Skill Dimensional Hexa Slash.

Immediately, six dimensional slashes converged on the tip of Desert River’s cane, colliding directly with the point of compressed space.

Boom!

A deafening explosion echoed across Plot 079. Immediately afterward, Desert River was sent flying back over 20 yards, his stone cane trembling and his HP depleting by nearly 10%.

…

“How is this possible?!”

Hidden Soul and the other Zero Wing members watching from a distance gawked at this scene.

Desert River was a sixth-floor expert. Although he wasn’t fully equipped with Divine Artifacts, even experts fully equipped with Divine Artifacts executing a Peak Gold Combat Technique shouldn’t be able to withstand his fusion technique. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Nevertheless, Lunar River had repulsed Desert River with only a Tier 6 Skill. This shattered their understanding of Tier 6 Skills.

No wonder she dares to face Ink Crystal. Shi Feng was similarly surprised by this development. However, unlike his teammates, he knew how Lunar River had achieved what she had just done. She can already reach the Overlimit standard with her Tier 6 Skills, is it?

In his previous life, there had been only one instance where a non-sixth-floor expert had managed to hold their ground against a sixth-floor expert with similar Basic Attributes.

The person who had accomplished this feat was none other than Verdant Rainbow, the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s God Hunter. She had single-handedly defeated one of the Holy Race’s old monsters at the time thanks to her ability to execute Tier 6 Skills at Completion Rates beyond 120%.

By design, it was incredibly difficult for players to achieve 100% Skill and Spell Completion Rates in God’s Domain. This was especially so for high-tier Skills and Spells. Even fifth-floor experts would have difficulty achieving a 100% Completion Rate with their Tier 6 Skills and Spells. As for those who could go beyond 100% and achieve the theoretical limit of 120%, they were as rare as a phoenix’s feather.

Of course, for those who achieved a 120% Completion Rate with their Skills and Spells, their journey wasn’t over. After all, 120% was only the theoretical limit of Skill and Spell Completion Rates. In reality, it was possible to go beyond 120% and enter the Overlimit territory. Once a Skill or Spell achieved the Overlimit standard, it would gain the power to break the limitations of its tier. In the case of a Tier 6 Overlimit Skill, its power would be no weaker than that of Pseudo-Tier 7 Skills.

However, achieving the Overlimit standard with Tier 6 Skills and Spells was easier said than done. Verdant Rainbow was the only player in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain to have accomplished this feat in Shi Feng’s previous life. Hence, he was surprised to learn that Lunar River had also achieved it.

…

The moment Desert River was sent flying, Ink Crystal turned toward Lunar River, her indifference replaced by fascination.

“A Tier 6 Overlimit Skill! To think the human race had hidden an expert such as yourself!” Ink Crystal exclaimed. “But you are still not my match. While Tier 6 Overlimit Skills might be powerful, they are limited by their Cooldowns. How many times can you defend against my Implement Manipulation Technique, I wonder?”

After saying so, Ink Crystal raised her vine cane and summoned two vine lotus flowers from the ground. The move she used was Twofold Thornstorm, the fusion technique she had used to eliminate Garuda earlier.

Lunar River did not panic when confronted with Ink Crystal’s Twofold Thornstorm. On the contrary, she smiled and said, “I naturally know that Tier 6 Overlimit Skills aren’t enough to defeat you, but I am not your only opponent, Miss Ink Crystal!”

As soon as Lunar River finished speaking, she and 499 other King’s Paradise members retrieved a light golden scroll from their bags and activated it. Immediately, divine patterns formed and hovered around them, linking them and causing their combined aura to skyrocket in intensity. Their aura became so powerful that even the Zero Wing members spectating from thousands of yards away shuddered.

A Large Advanced Silver Battle Array? Shi Feng gasped when he saw the divine patterns hovering around King’s Paradise’s members. Looking at these divine patterns, he finally understood why Lunar River was confident King’s Paradise could secure four plots of land in Everlasting City’s competition.

A Large Advanced Silver Battle Array!

Although battle arrays were not uncommon, their rarity increased with size and rank. In the human race’s Greater God’s Domain, Medium Silver Battle Arrays were already as rare as a phoenix’s feather, while Medium Advanced Silver Battle Arrays were regarded as a strategic resource by the various apex powers. As for Large Advanced Silver Battle Arrays, not even apex powers could get their hands on these things.

However, should a 500-man team come to possess a Large Advance Silver Battle Array, it could fight even Taboo Bosses, let alone a sixth-floor expert fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

Once the battle array took shape, Lunar River executed a cross slash at the two vine lotus flowers smashing toward her.

Tier 6 Skill, Divine Cross Slash!
