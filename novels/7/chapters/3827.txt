Chapter 3828 - 902 - Missing Realm

Star Lake City, Zero Wing Training Center:

Illuminated by the midday sun, the hatch of Shi Feng’s virtual gaming cabin opened, and Shi Feng climbed out of it, a sense of weakness spreading across his body.

Sure enough, spending ten days in-game is draining on the mind, Shi Feng thought as he looked at himself in the mirror and saw that he had lost weight. Fortunately, the flow of time in the remnant primordial world wasn’t too different. Had a month gone by while I was there, I’d need several days to recover, even with Stardew.

After the major system update, the souls of players and their accounts had essentially been synchronized. This had thoroughly changed the way players played God’s Domain.

In the past, it didn’t matter how long players spent in God’s Domain each gaming session. Only when they engaged in mentally stressful activities such as high-intensity battles would their exhaustion be reflected on their resting bodies in the real world.

However, after the major system update, even if players didn’t engage in battle, they would be subjected to constant mental stress so long as they had high-quality weapons and equipment equipped. It was as if players were genuinely living in God’s Domain and carrying their heavy weapons and equipment around all the time.

This situation made it impossible for players to rest properly in God’s Domain and required them to recuperate in the real world. Otherwise, they would eventually collapse from exhaustion in God’s Domain and be forcibly logged out.

While Shi Feng was about to drink the drop of Stardew he had retrieved from the refrigerator, a holographic projection suddenly appeared in his living room. The projection was of a graceful woman with an imposing appearance. This woman was none other than Xia Qingying, one of the Green God Corporation’s Senior Vice Presidents.

“Guild Leader Shi, you really don’t make it easy for others to get in touch with you,” Xia Yingqing grumbled, looking fatigued. “Where have you been this whole time? I’ve contacted Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow multiple times, but every time, they say you are busy with something. Yet, they refuse to tell me where you went.”

“They weren’t lying. I was indeed occupied with something urgent recently,” Shi Feng answered. Before he left for the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, he had informed Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow not to share his whereabouts. “Did something happen on your side?”

The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary was one of the Greater God’s Domain’s Twelve Sanctuaries, which every power in the Greater God’s Domain wished to engage. Meanwhile, as Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, he had long since become a thorn in the side of the Eternal Realm’s various powers. This was especially so after the appearance of the Tower of the Abyss, which had earned the attention of even apex powers.

If he was merely operating in the Eternal Realm, he wouldn’t fear anyone targeting him.

Although an entrance to the Eternal Realm had already been discovered, very few Level 230-plus experts could actually enter it right now. Additionally, the ones who did make it into the Eternal Realm didn’t have particularly good weapons and equipment. This was because most Level 230-plus experts did not wish to risk suffering a permanent death in the dangerous space-time passage. Furthermore, Level 230-plus players were the leading force in clearing out the monsters in the passage. Hence, he was more than capable of defending himself in the Eternal Realm.

However, it was a different story if he were to operate in one of the Twelve Sanctuaries.

The Twelve Sanctuaries were filled with Level 230-plus experts. A Tier 6 player who had yet to reach Level 220 like himself would be incredibly weak there. If any apex power intended to target him, his chances of survival would be less than 20%. Hence, before leaving for the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, he had reminded Hidden Soul and Gentle Snow not to share his whereabouts. He had even told them not to interrupt him if nothing serious happened.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Of course, something happened! Something huge happened!” Xia Qingying huffed, rolling her eyes at Shi Feng. “Since you left me with the task of training an absurd number of Divine Engravers, I’ve been trying every means to gather the necessary manpower across numerous mobile cities! Although I eventually secured the required manpower without attracting attention, the cost of materials is killing me! Do you know how many connections I had to pull to barely cover the expenditure of all these people?”

“Are you lacking Seven Luminaries Crystals?” Shi Feng quickly understood Xia Qingying’s problem after hearing about the other party’s complaint. “If it’s Seven Luminaries Crystals, I can have Hidden Soul send some to you now.”

It was indeed difficult for a single corporation to nurture 10,000 Divine Engravers in one go. This was because the main material used to produce Divine Engraving Scrolls was Seven Luminaries Crystals. The various powers considered Seven Luminaries Crystals a strategic resource, so it was difficult to obtain them in bulk under normal circumstances. Recently, the only reliable way to obtain Seven Luminaries Crystals in bulk was by selling Eternal Coins.

Fortunately, the current Zero Wing did not lack Seven Luminaries Crystals. Thanks to the Tower of the Abyss, Zero Wing had become the number one earner of Seven Luminaries Crystals in the Eternal Realm.

“Seven Luminaries Crystals?” Xia Qingying looked at Shi Feng in astonishment. “Where have you been all this time?”

“The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary,” Shi Feng answered truthfully. “What’s wrong?”

He had already established a partnership with eight of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers. He was even staying in Flame Vein Holy City, protected by over a hundred Level 240-plus experts. Even if apex powers sent Level 240 elite experts after him, he would not be in any danger. Thus, he didn’t mind revealing his current whereabouts.

“The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary? I didn’t think you’d have the means to go there.” At Shi Feng’s answer, Xia Qingying couldn’t help but scrutinize him in surprise. “But that’s not right. Even if you are in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, how can you not know about the Cruise Wing Realm’s disappearance?”

“The Cruise Wing Realm disappeared?” Shi Feng was momentarily stunned. “How is this possible?! Who did it?! Did a Primordial God take action?!”

Although some Realms had disappeared in his previous life, they were some of the weaker Realms in the Greater God’s Domain. However, he had never received any specific information about the reason for their disappearance; all he had heard were speculations.

As for the Cruise Wing Realm, it had always existed in his previous life. There had never been any problems with it. He knew this because the Cruise Wing Realm was no ordinary Realm. Even among the thousands of Realms in the Greater God’s Domain, it ranked among the top 100. Thus, any power that was a hegemonic power or above would know of its existence.

Furthermore, the Cruise Wing Realm was among the Greater God’s Domain’s top 30 Resource Realms. It was extremely rich in various resources. Because of this, various resources could be obtained from the Cruise Wing Realm at a much cheaper price than other places. Many powers could even profit by reselling the Cruise Wing Realm’s resources to distant Realms.

The Cruise Wing Realm was also incredibly strong overall. While not as strong as the Twelve Sanctuaries, it had as many as three pseudo-apex powers. Thus, even mighty Level 240 Ancient Gods could not make the Cruise Wing Realm disappear. Only a Primordial God could accomplish such a feat.
