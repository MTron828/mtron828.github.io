Chapter 454 – Courtyard of Space’s Benefit

The Orichalcum Secret Treasure stirred the desires of many on the team.

Everyone present was an expert, so everyone knew the importance of Mana Protection. It was especially important for high-tiered players like them.

The fact that the Orichalcum Secret Treasure the wearer’s Mana Protection by 15% meant that equipping it would allow the wearer to ignore 15% of the damage they received from most, if not all, attacks launched by players and monsters. And while 15% might not seem like a lot, it was enough to propel a player’s defensive capabilities to a whole new level.

If a player could originally only withstand a pummeling from six monsters of the same level and tier, upon equipping the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, they could increase that number to seven.

!!

In the Eternal Realm, where monsters were present in large numbers and possessed great strength, the Orichalcum Secret Treasure could be of great help to players in their exploration of the Realm.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, as per our agreement, if you do not want this Orichalcum Secret Treasure…” Holding the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, Frey looked toward Shi Feng and smiled, saying, “It’ll belong to me.”

Frey looked calm and composed when she spoke to Shi Feng, behaving as if she didn’t care whether Shi Feng used his privilege of selecting two items from the Courtyard of Space on the Orichalcum Secret Treasure. Unfortunately, try as she might, the hint of worry in her voice still betrayed her true thoughts.

In reality, Frey was incredibly worried Shi Feng might choose the Orichalcum Secret Treasure as one of the two items he would be taking.

Although their team had already obtained a Secret Treasure after killing the first three monsters they encountered in the Courtyard of Space, she’d be a fool to assume that Secret Treasures had a high drop rate in this Dungeon. As items capable of rewriting the Greater God’s Domain’s existing power structure, there was no way Secret Treasures would have a high drop rate.

The more likely explanation for the Orichalcum Secret Treasure dropping so early into the raid was that their team had lucked out and obtained an ultra-rare drop that would normally take many raids to acquire. For all she knew, the Orichalcum Secret Treasure’s value might even surpass the combined value of the Dungeon Boss’s loot.

When Shi Feng saw the worry in Frey’s eyes, he shook his head and chuckled, saying, “Don’t worry, Miss Frey. I am not interested in the Orichalcum Secret Treasure.”

Secret Treasures were indeed a rare drop in World Mode Dungeons. This was also why he was surprised to see one drop so soon.

Normally, even if players killed all of a World Mode Dungeon’s monsters, they’d be lucky if they could get three or four Secret Treasures. If unlucky, they might end up with only one Secret Treasure to show for their efforts. Moreover, the majority of the Secret Treasures dropped would only be Common-ranked Secret Treasures that could only provide a small boost to Mana Protection. They wouldn’t even increase the Basic Attributes of the attached piece of equipment.

However, while Secret Treasures might be rare, they were nothing compared to the Divine Spatial Potion and Seven Luminaries Ring.

“Thank you, Guild Leader Black Flame.”

Frey sighed in relief when she heard Shi Feng’s answer. If she could give the Orichalcum Secret Treasure to one of her team’s tanks, it would increase the team’s survivability significantly. This, in turn, would greatly help the team in exploring the Eternal Realm and raiding Team Dungeons in the future. The Secret Treasure’s value easily surpassed that of most Fragmented Legendary items.

With the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, she would also have a greater chance of coming out on top in her struggle with Moro.

After saying so, Frey handed the Orichalcum Secret Treasure to a Tier 5 Demidragon Shield Warrior. When the tall and large Shield Warrior received the Secret Treasure, he excitedly attached it to his Fragmented Legendary Gauntlets without hesitation.

As soon as the Demidragon Shield Warrior equipped the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, his mana underwent a significant transformation. Anyone sensitive to mana would be able to tell that the mana surrounding the Shield Warrior had become much more condensed.

“It truly is incredible. It’s a pity we’ll only get to look at it,” White Owl said as she enviously looked at the Demidragon Shield Warrior.

There were many powerful experts in the current Eternal Realm, and those who could match her existed in significant numbers. Competition out in the fields was originally very intense already, and it was made worse with the addition of the Holy Race players. If she could have a Secret Treasure in this situation, it would increase her survivability by a lot.

Standing next to White Owl, Death Omen and Thousand Scars nodded in agreement, and they couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in confusion.

Their agreement with Frey was different from Shi Feng’s agreement with her. According to their agreement, they would provide information on the Courtyard of Space’s monsters on the condition that Frey let them join her raid team. However, there was an added condition stating that they would have nothing to do with the Dugeon’s loot, and all they could get from the raid were the Reputation Points awarded by the Dungeon’s First Clear reward.

Shi Feng, on the other hand, could choose any two items obtained from the Dungeon. Yet, he had chosen not to take the Orichalcum Secret Treasure.

“Are you certain you don’t want the Orichalcum Secret Treasure, Brother Black Flame?” Desolate Fury asked as he looked at Shi Feng strangely. “If you have this item, it’ll greatly help you compete for an entry token in the Blood Hell Mountain Range once the map opens in five days.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Every Realm in the Greater God’s Domain was massive. Although nobody knew how large the Eternal Realm was currently, players in the current Eternal Realm could only operate in the vicinity of the various towns.

The Eternal Realm’s various towns were situated in maps below Level 150. If players wished to level up quickly after reaching Level 145, it was a must for them to enter Level 150-plus maps.

Meanwhile, the Blood Hell Mountain Range was the closest thing to a Level 150-plus map in this region. However, because of the Holy Race players’ appearance, once players entered the Blood Hell Mountain Range, a slaughter fest was bound to occur between human and Holy Race players once the map activated in five days. At that time, if players entered the map without sufficient survival capabilities, it was unlikely they would survive for long.

Moreover, the Blood Hell Mountain Range held the only NPC City discovered thus far. Meanwhile, if players wished to enter the city, they would need to obtain an entry token by killing the monsters inside the Blood Hell Mountain Range. Without the entry token, players would be unable to enter the city and obtain more information on the Eternal Realm.

“It might be of some help, but obtaining an entry token in the Blood Hell Mountain Range isn’t a difficult matter, to begin with,” Shi Feng said with a faint smile.

It was true that there would be an intense struggle in the Blood Hell Mountain Range once the new map was activated, and having the Orichalcum Secret Treasure would greatly increase his survivability during the struggle. However, so long as he could get his hands on the Divine Spatial Potion and Seven Luminaries Ring, securing an entry token for the city in the Blood Hell Mountain Range would be a piece of cake.

“It’s not a difficult matter?”

When Desolate Fury, Cross, and Leroja heard Shi Feng’s words, they couldn’t help but wryly smile.

Unlike Shi Feng, the three of them were not at all confident in obtaining an entry token in the Blood Hell Mountain Range. They’d be glad if they could even grind for levels in there. After all, even if they ignored the many human experts in the Eternal Realm, they were nowhere near strong enough to win against the Holy Race players in a fight.

When Shi Feng saw the wry smiles on the trio’s faces, he chuckled and said, “It’s not a tough thing for you three to accomplish, either.”

“You think too highly of us, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Leroja said, shaking her head. “We might not have any problems dealing with the Holy Race’s Tier 4 players, but we stand no chance against their Tier 5 players. And by the time the map opens in five days, many of the Holy Race’s players would have most likely reached Tier 5 already. At that time, we will have no advantages going into the Blood Hell Mountain Range.”

“If we are talking about your current selves, it will indeed be impossible for you to obtain an entry token,” Shi Feng said, nodding in agreement. Then, he continued in a whisper, “But haven’t you noticed something peculiar with the spatial blades flying around the Dungeon after fighting in here for so long?”

“Something peculiar?”

Hearing Shi Feng’s words, the trio promptly began observing the spatial blades flying about the garden. However, even after observing the spatial blades for over ten minutes, they failed to find anything special about them.

Eventually, Shi Feng decided to give the trio another hint, whispering, “Observe the spatial blades through mental perception and mana fluctuations. Doesn’t it look like these spatial blades’ attack patterns are forcing you to move in a way resembling a body technique?”

Realization immediately dawned on the trio, and they hurriedly began mentally simulating themselves dodging the spatial blades.

“It’s true!” Leroja quietly exclaimed. “Not just that, but this body technique resembles a Gold Body Technique I’ve seen before!”

Desolate Fury and Cross were greatly shocked when they heard Leroja’s words.

A Gold Body Technique?
