Chapter 362 - S-Rank

Although Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan had not voiced their opinions, their expressions exposed the disdain they felt. If Manager Xiao had not been present, they might have even taught Shi Feng a lesson, teaching him what it meant to be wet behind the ears.

As to why the two would not dare take action in front of Manager Xiao, it was not because of Manager Xiao’s position in the Big Dipper Training Center. Rather, they feared Manager Xiao’s personal strength.

Because Manager Xiao’s strength frightened Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan, they would not make any casual remarks in front of him. Why else would geniuses like them remain silent at such a ridiculous statement?

Manager Xiao’s full name was Xiao Yan, and he was well-known in Jin Hai City. He had also been a professional fighter during his youth. However, after winning a championship, he retired as a professional fighter. He then joined the Big Dipper Training Center and developed himself there.

Even though Xiao Yan was over forty now, he would frequently spar with some of the top fighters in the city, thoroughly defeating them.

“Uncle Xiao, why do you look so surprised?” Zhao Ruoxi’s lips curled up slightly when she saw Manager Yan’s face. “Since you don’t believe me, why don’t we place a bet?”

Zhao Ruoxi’s mesmerizing smile left Manager Yan greatly confused. He could not figure out what the little girl before him was trying to accomplish. However, since Zhao Ruoxi wished to play, he certainly wouldn’t mind humoring her for a while. When all was said and done, her father was a good brother of his, and he had pampered her like a little princess since she was a child.

“It seems that you have a lot of confidence in your classmate, Shi Feng, Ruoxi. In any case, since you’ve already made the offer, I’m guessing that you won’t let your uncle say ‘no.’ What do you wish to bet, then? However, I’ll tell you this in advance. Your Uncle Xiao cannot get you the Secret Pavilion’s information viewing rights,” Manager Xiao laughed, having already prepared to lose.

Hearing the words ‘Secret Pavilion,’ both Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan behind Manager Xiao were shocked.

What was the Secret Pavilion?

Anyone who played virtual reality games definitely knew about the Secret Pavilion.

The Secret Pavilion was the creator of the Experts List that recorded all the excellent individuals throughout the world. The Secret Pavilion’s information gathering was unmatched throughout virtual gaming world. It had also been titled as Omniscient. In the virtual gaming world, it was an exalted existence.

Other than the Experts List, one could also search for various information relating to the virtual gaming world through the Secret Pavilion’s official website. However, depending on the type of information, the price varied.

If one had a strong relationship with the Secret Pavilion, they could obtain different levels of information viewing rights. To those who played virtual reality games, that kind of access was a dream.

Even Shi Feng who taken aback by Manager Xiao’s words. He had not thought that the Big Dipper Training Center would have a relationship with the Secret Pavilion.

“I know. I never said I wanted to bet the viewing rights anyway.” Although Zhao Ruoxi made that claim, inwardly, she was somewhat disappointed. She then smiled and said, “Let’s bet three bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids! I know that you have recently received some!”

Manager Xiao laughed bitterly when he heard her offer. “Little girl, you are always thinking about taking what little family fortune I have left. I’ve only managed to obtain these few bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids after much difficulty, and I had planned to reward them to the most excellent students.”

When Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan heard these words, their hearts began to pound with excitement. They had even thought that they had heard wrong for a second there.

Even C-rank Nutrient Fluids were considered a luxury, let alone S-rank Nutrient Fluids.

S-rank Nutrient Fluids could not be purchased even if one had the money for it. When consumed, S-rank Nutrient Fluids provided notable physical recovery and enhancements. It even played a role in delaying the body’s aging process and was known as the Water of Life. Moreover, even if one found the opportunity to purchase these S-rank Nutrient Fluids, each bottle cost one million Credits. Ordinary people could not afford it even if they bankrupted themselves. Only a wealthy organization like Big Dipper could willingly award such an item.

If Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan could each obtain a bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluids before the Provincial Youth Fighting Competition, they would have more confidence in succeeding in the competition.

“Uncle Xiao, you aren’t going back on your word, right? If so, I’m going to tell Big Sis Bing Yu that you’re bullying me,” Zhao Ruoxi giggled.

“Hah... You’re the one who bullies your Uncle Xiao. Since I’ve already agreed to your bet, I won’t go back on my word. Say it, then. What are the terms?” Manager Xiao agreed without hesitation upon hearing the name “Bing Yu,” his actions stupefying both Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan.

“Hm...” After giving it some thought, Zhao Ruoxi shifted her gaze towards Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan. She then smiled faintly as she pointed towards the two, saying, “The two of them, then.”

“What do you want the two of them to do? Don’t tell me you want them to fight your classmate. Ruoxi, you should consider this carefully. Although Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan are not professional fighters, an ordinary university student is no match for them,” Manager Xiao kindly explained.

Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan both proudly raised their heads upon hearing Manager Xiao’s words, expressing their agreement. After all, they were the most excellent candidates selected by Big Dipper.

“Of course not. It would be too unfair to them if we let them fight Shi Feng,” Zhao Ruoxi said righteously. For a second there, even Manager Xiao almost believed her. “So, let’s compete using the punching power test and reaction test results. That way, they can’t complain when they lose.”

Zhao Ruoxi’s words left both high schoolers utterly speechless. The two of them promptly shot a glare at Shi Feng, provocation filling their eyes as if saying, “A brat like you thinks you’re fit to compete with us? You’ll pay for this!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Hah... Little girl, what goes through your mind all day long? You better not blame me when you lose,” Manager Xiao sighed. He then looked at Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan, asking, “What do you think? If you two lose, your S-rank Nutrient Fluid rewards will be gone. If you win, I will double the rewards.”

“We don’t have any problems. However, we wish to retake the test and use the new results. Will that be fine?” Wang Cheng and Wu Chuan had long since discussed the bet among themselves. Hence, they quickly put forward their request.

This surprised many of the silently spectating crowd. They could not understand why the two students would request for a retest. After all, their previous test results were the best out of three tries. If they retook the test, they might not get better numbers.

Only Manager Xiao understood the two students’ intentions. Nodding his head, he said with a smile, “Okay. I knew you two little brats were holding back just now.”

The realization struck the spectators upon hearing Manager Xiao’s words.

“They managed to get such high test results even while holding back? Are those two really high school students?”

“Those two are simply too frightening!”

Many among the crowd expressed their shocks at this revelation.

However, Shi Feng was not the slightest bit surprised at this news. Only, he was very surprised by Zhao Ruoxi’s actions. He could not figure out just what she was trying to do.

“I’ve earned you the chance to obtain three bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids. The rest is up to you now. Also, I prohibit you from losing!” Zhao Ruoxi walked up to Shi Feng and smiled, not giving him a chance to say “No.”

After Zhao Ruoxi issued her command, Shi Feng finally realized what she wanted to accomplish. It turned out that she had played this little game just to gain him three bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluids.

Before Shi Feng could utter a word of gratitude, Zhao Ruoxi, with slightly red cheeks, cut him off, saying, “Don’t think too much about it. Aren’t we friends? I know that you’ve been secretly and desperately training to improve physically. Since we’re friends, it is only natural that we help each other out. As for thanks, it isn’t necessary. If you really wish to thank me, then come to my birthday party next month. Even if you’re a busy man, you must come. You’re also not allowed to be late, alright?”

Shi Feng’s heart warmed when he heard Zhao Ruoxi speaking. Although he had many things he wished to say, after racking his mind on what he should say, a single, simple sentence left his lips, “I’ll be there.”

However, when Manager Xiao heard Zhao Yueru’s demand, his originally friendly smile suddenly froze. He then shifted a stiff gaze towards Shi Feng, looking at the youth with disbelieving eyes.

Just what sort of demonic power does this brat have? Manager Xiao could not help but pay more attention to Shi Feng. There must be a reason why the little swindling girl had such an optimistic opinion of him.

Following which, Shi Feng, Wang Cheng, and Wu Chuan walked towards the punching power testing apparatus to begin their examination.
