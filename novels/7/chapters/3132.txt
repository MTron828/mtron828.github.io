Chapter 207 – Mind-Blowing Wealth

“Change the content?” Laura quickly suppressed the excitement in her heart when she heard Shi Feng’s words. Then, she asked, “May I know what you have in mind, Mr. Black Flame?”

“Simple. I don’t need any Golden Laws. I only need you to become Zero Wing’s ally,” Shi Feng said after giving the matter some thought. “I will also need you to give your full support to Zero Wing’s development in the Stratified Abyssal Realm.”

A Golden Law might be an incomparably valuable item that even the Greater God’s Domain’s various apex powers would fight desperately to obtain. Still, it wasn’t something that was of any use to him right now. Or, more specifically, he didn’t have anyone who could learn the Gold Combat Technique recorded inside the Golden Law.

This was because players needed to reach Tier 5 first before they could learn a Gold Combat Technique. Moreover, that was only the minimum requirement. Whether one could actually learn it was an entirely different story.

According to Shi Feng’s knowledge, even the Greater God’s Domain’s various apex powers, existences that commanded a large number of Tier 6 God-ranked experts, only had a handful of players who had successfully learned a Gold Combat Technique.

While a Golden Law might seem like a wonderful thing, it was no different from a pie in the sky for the current Zero Wing. It’d be much better if he exchanged for something more practical.

Of course, it would be best if he could get Laura to join Zero Wing, but that evidently wouldn’t be possible. However, there should be no problem getting Laura to enter an alliance with Zero Wing. After all, there weren’t many restrictions or hierarchical problems in an alliance.

Meanwhile, Laura’s adventurer team was Slumber City’s number one power. If Zero Wing could acquire the full support of Glimmer, the Guild would have a much easier time achieving rapid development in Slumber City.

“If it’s only entering an alliance, I don’t see any problems with that so long as Zero Wing is fine with such an arrangement. But you should know that only four of us will be leaving the Stratified Abyssal Realm. We’re also at Level 120, Tier 3 only. We won’t be of much help to you in the Greater God’s Domain,” Laura said as she looked at Shi Feng incredulously. “As for support in the Stratified Abyssal Realm, so long as it is something Glimmer can accomplish, we will not refuse to help. However, now that the dozen or so neighboring cities have their eyes on Slumber City, I’m afraid there is very little Glimmer can do.”

Golden Laws should be the most attractive items to the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers. Yet, Shi Feng had refused a Golden Order and simply sought an alliance with Glimmer. Zero Wing stood to gain nothing from this deal, no matter how she looked at this.

As for the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s material resources, any hegemonic power worth its salt probably wouldn’t pay a second glance at these meager things. The only resource the various hegemonic powers wanted was the Stratified Abyssal Realm’s experts. However, recruiting these experts required the Stratified Abyssal Realm to be fully integrated into the Greater God’s Domain, and this was a very long process that could take many years.

There was also very little Glimmer could offer Zero Wing in terms of combat support. Currently, over a dozen NPC cities’ peak powers have already set their sights on Slumber City. Even if all of Slumber City’s local powers banded together, they still wouldn’t be a match for all of these peak powers.

So, Laura simply couldn’t understand what Shi Feng was thinking.

“It is fine so long as you agree to my terms, Miss Laura. Zero Wing doesn’t need any combat support. All Glimmer needs to do is sell Zero Wing Dark Crystals at market value. It would be even better if Glimmer could help sell some of Zero Wing’s Hypersensitivity Potions,” Shi Feng said, smiling.

His conditions might seem insignificant to Laura, but they were incredibly important for Zero Wing.

Although he also had the option of getting Laura to give him all of Glimmer’s resources for free, doing so would impact their partnership in the future. So, a fair deal must be done. After all, with Laura’s potential, he believed that she could easily achieve much more than Thousand Sword Saint Wordless Ember and Dawn Saint Sleeping Quicksand.

It should be known that Wordless Ember and Dawn Saint had slain over a hundred Tier 6 experts in a single battle during their prime. Back then, Zero Wing, at its peak, didn’t even have 100 Tier 6 experts…

Meanwhile, it didn’t matter how many peak powers he had to go up against so long as he had enough Dark Crystals. The peak powers from the neighboring cities could even band together for all he cared. In front of the Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle, those peak powers would be nothing but a joke.

In a situation where everyone was stuck at Tier 3, the Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle was God. Even Bronze Combat Puppets couldn’t resist the effects brought about by the Bronze Magic Tactical Vehicle.

“No problem,” Laura said without hesitation. “But I need to remind you that Glimmer doesn’t have a lot of Dark Crystals on hand. Currently, we only have around 250,000 Dark Crystals. Moreover, I’m afraid the sale of Hypersensitivity Potions won’t go very well. With so many peak powers targeting Slumber City, few people will dare to buy them in bulk if we price them too high. We’d be fortunate if we could get ten Dark Crystals per bottle.”

T-Two hundred and fifty thousand?!?Shi Feng was at a loss for words as he looked at Laura.

It should be known that Slumber City’s various powers were working tirelessly just to rake in three to five hundred Dark Crystals per month. Even in the case of a peak power like Purple Light, the Chamber of Commerce could only acquire around two to three thousand Dark Crystals per month. Even then, Echoing Judgment already deemed it a considerable amount of wealth.

However, compared to Glimmer, Purple Light was no different than a beggar…

Even if Shi Feng were to use Magic Crystals to trade for Glimmer’s Dark Crystals at market price, he wouldn’t be able to buy all of them with the two million Magic Crystals he brought. After all, the market value for Dark Crystals was two hundred Magic Crystals per Dark Crystal. With the Magic Crystals he had, he could, at most, buy 10,000 Dark Crystals from Glimmer. That wasn’t even 10% of the Dark Crystals in Glimmer’s possession…

Suddenly, Shi Feng had an urge to trade on credit.

However, Shi Feng eventually suppressed this urge. After all, he planned to establish a long-term partnership with the woman known as Laura Crader. It simply wasn’t worth abandoning this partnership for just 250,000 Dark Crystals.

I’ll have to exchange for some Magic Crystals from Hundred Flower Palace,?Shi Feng thought. If he wanted to buy more Dark Crystals from Glimmer, his only option was to look for Hundred Flower Palace for help.

Hundred Flower Palace had entered the Stratified Abyssal Realm intending to extend its operations to this place, so it must have brought a lot more Magic Crystals than he did. Hundred Flower Palace should also be more than willing to part with some of its Magic Crystals if he offered to sell them some Hypersensitivity Potions.

Afterward, Shi Feng signed a God’s Domain Contract with Laura.

According to the contract’s terms, Laura Crader and her companions would become Zero Wing’s allies. In exchange, Shi Feng needed to help Laura Crader and three of her companions leave the Stratified Abyssal Realm within a month. As for how Laura and her companions would get from the Miniature Ancient World to the Greater God’s Domain, it was up to them to think of a way.

At the same time, Laura Crader would also sell Dark Crystals to Shi Feng at two hundred Magic Crystals per Dark Crystal. This deal would remain effective over the long term. Unless Glimmer was having difficulties maintaining normal operation, the adventurer team would trade a minimum of 10,000 Dark Crystals to Zero Wing each month.

Since they signed a God’s Domain Contract, the contract’s terms would remain in effect so long as both parties remained in God’s Domain. If any party breached the terms agreed in the contract, the party that had breached the contract would suffer the contract’s penalty no matter which God’s Domain they were in. The only real way they could avoid the contract’s penalty was if they stopped logging into God’s Domain forever.

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng signed the contract with Laura, he promptly exchanged his two million Magic Crystals for ten thousand Dark Crystals. Then, he hurried over to the Matrix Tower.
