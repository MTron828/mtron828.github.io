Chapter 2895 – Treasure Trove-like Secret Land

The loot of the four Evil Blood Stalkers rained down from the sky.

At a rough glance, the four Superior Mythics had dropped a combined total of over 300 items, including at least 30 Epic items and two Fragmented Legendary items. The Evil Blood Stalkers’ loot was significantly better than that of the outside world’s Superior Mythics.

Even Shi Feng was slightly surprised by this situation. Although he had already expected the God Mode Secret Land’s monsters to drop significantly better loot, he was still shocked when he actually saw the loot.

Past Level 150, Epic Weapons and Equipment would have significantly reduced drop rates. One would be fortunate to get even two or three pieces of Epic Equipment from a Level 150-plus Superior Mythic.

Nevertheless, the four Evil Blood Stalkers had dropped more than 30. Moreover, these were all Level 150-plus Epic items! However, Shi Feng did not rush to collect the loot. Instead, he joined the others to clear out the Evil Blood Soldiers. Only after fighting for close to an hour did the team finish off the 100-plus Evil Blood Soldiers.

Although the deaths of the Evil Blood Soldiers did not raise anyone’s level, everyone still saw their experience bar increase by a sizable chunk. Moreover, the total number of Epic items the Evil Blood Soldiers dropped was not the slightest bit lower than that of the Evil Blood Stalkers. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Guild Leader, I found some Epic Weapons and Equipment! They can all be used up to Level 180! Moreover, one of them is even part of Level 180 Epic Set Equipment!” Cola said excitedly as he ran up to Shi Feng while waving a plate-armor glove in his hand.

Shi Feng was slightly surprised when he saw the glove Cola held. “The eight-piece Level 180 Saint’s Heart Set?”

Level 180 Epic Sets were rare in God’s Domain, and eight-piece sets were even rarer, rivaling Fragmented Legendary items. Typically, even the Guild Leaders of large Guilds would have difficulty getting themselves an eight-piece set. However, so long as one completed a set, the Basic Attributes they received from the set would be only slightly inferior to equipping eight discrete pieces of Fragmented Legendary Equipment. The set could be used up to Level 200 without any problems.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to call an eight-piece Level 180 Epic Set Equipment a graduation set in God’s Domain.

In his previous life, Shi Feng had owned only a six-piece set of Level 180 Epic Set Equipment; an eight-piece set had been something he could only dream of owning. Rather than trying to get an eight-piece set, it had been more realistic to try to obtain one or two Fragmented Legendary items.

He never thought that these Evil Blood monsters would drop eight-piece Level 180 Epic Sets. This was definitely a pleasant surprise.

A complete set would be the best set equipment available in the current God’s Domain. It could let an ordinary Tier 4 player gain Tier 5 combat power. Unless a real Tier 5 player appeared, this Tier 4 player would be invincible!

Shortly afterward, Yan Tianxing also picked up a part for an eight-piece set of Level 180 Set Equipment. However, this wasn’t for the Saint’s Heart Set but for the Spirit Abyss Set, a cloth-armor set. Moreover, this wasn’t the only piece their team got for that set; Violet Cloud also found one.

When all of the loot had been tallied, everyone couldn’t help their excitement.

They had obtained 71 Level 180 Epic Weapons and Equipment, including five pieces for eight-piece Level 180 Sets: one for the Saint’s Heart Set, two for the Spirit Abyss Set, and two for the Magic Dragon Set of leather armor.

They also had two Fragmented Legendary items. One of them was a shield called Wind’s Protection, and the other was a ring called the Spectral Ring. Most importantly, there was also one God Crystal among the loot.

Upon seeing the Evil Blood monsters’ loot, Cold Shadow and the others were exhilarated.

Although current superpowers had already acquired a substantial number of Fragmented Legendary items, with some powerful Super Guilds having up to 30, these were still far from enough to sate demand. With how many experts there were in a superpower, even core executives would be fortunate to obtain one Fragmented Legendary item. Moreover, the drop rate of Fragmented Legendary items did not increase along with the level of players. Players had only so many sources of Fragmented Legendary items.

The God Crystal, on the other hand, was crucial for the upgrade of many Fragmented Legendary items, and practically all superpowers sought to obtain a God Crystal. Unfortunately, nobody knew of any reliable sources of God Crystals.

After Shi Feng took a look at the two Fragmented Legendary items, he said, “White Feather will take the Wind’s Protection. The Spectral Ring is suitable for Assassins, so Fire Dance will take it. The GCPs for these two items will be gradually deducted from you two afterward. Does anyone have a problem with that?”

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s decision, White Feather hurriedly tried to reject his offer, saying, “Guild Leader Black Flame, I’m just a newcomer. Isn’t it inappropriate to let me have this shield?”

She would be lying if she said she didn’t want the Wind’s Protection. However, Fragmented Legendary items served as a Guild’s foundation. They would normally be passed to the most trustworthy members of the Guild. Meanwhile, she had joined Zero Wing just recently. If she were to receive a Fragmented Legendary Shield out of the blue, many people within the Guild would surely have opinions about it.

When White Feather tried to refuse the shield, Fire Dance said, “Little Sister White, you should take it. The Guild Leader naturally has his reasons for assigning the shield to you. Moreover, it’s just a Fragmented Legendary Shield. The other Tier 4 MTs in our team already have one. If you don’t use this one, it’ll just end up in the Warehouse. Rather than let it collect dust, we would be better off increasing our team’s combat power.” Cola, Ye Wumian, and Turtledove nodded in agreement. Only four MTs were participating in this raid, and White Feather was one of them. If she didn’t have a Fragmented Legendary Shield, she would be in for a tough time later. Seeing that none of the three other MTs objected to Shi Feng’s and Fire Dance’s words, White Feather decided to accept the shield. Although she didn’t voice her feelings, the sense of belonging she felt for Zero Wing increased significantly. She also secretly admired Zero Wing’s generosity. Following this, Zero Wing’s members continued exploring the Evil God’s Secret Land after an hour’s rest.

The team encountered many ambushes throughout the expedition, with some ambush parties having more than 200 Evil Blood Soldiers. The combat tactics these Evil Blood monsters employed also became increasingly subtle.

Initially, they only blindly charged at Zero Wing’s members. Afterward, they began launching sneak attacks and relying on healers in combat. At one point, they even set traps for Shi Feng, incapacitating him for short periods.

Fortunately, thanks to Shi Feng’s presence, Zero Wing’s team never suffered a catastrophic loss. After every battle, the dead were resurrected, and the team’s combat power returned to peak condition.

The team fought in the Evil God’s Secret Land for four consecutive days. Apart from logging off to rest and receive updates on the outside world’s situation, everyone spent the rest of their time exploring the secret land until they reached the inner region.

By the time the team arrived in the inner region, everyone was at least Level 165 already. Shi Feng had even reached Level 167. Their leveling speed was astonishing even for Tier 4 and Tier 5 players.

Past Level 150, every level-up required an astronomical amount of EXP. Tier 4 players would be fortunate if they could gain a level a day.

Yet, Zero Wing’s members had gained over ten levels in the past four days.

However, compared to their levels, what excited everyone more were the weapons and equipment they got.

At this point, everyone in the team had already replaced their old items with Level 180 Epic Weapons and Equipment. The team had also obtained a total of 45 Fragmented Legendary items.

Even Shi Feng was astonished by this harvest. He never thought that a Level 150-plus God Mode Secret Land would be such an amazing place. It was no wonder the various superpowers in the past had been so desperate to enter these secret lands.

In addition to this harvest, the team had also completed six eight-piece Level 180 Epic Sets: one Saint’s Heart Set, three Spirit Abyss Sets, and two Magic Dragon Sets. The sight of these sets rendered Cold Shadow and her subordinates utterly speechless.

In the current God’s Domain, Level 150 Epic Sets obtained by players numbered less than a handful, let alone Level 180 Epic Sets.

After some deliberation, Shi Feng had decided to give the Saint’s Heart Set to Gentle Snow, the Spirit Abyss Sets to Aqua Rose, Violet Cloud, and Yi Luofei, and the Magic Dragon Sets to Fire Dance and Yan Tianxing. Upon equipping these sets, the six players saw their combat power skyrocket. Now, their Basic Attributes were only second to Shi Feng’s. Gentle Snow, in particular, had her Strength Attribute near the 70,000 mark, surpassing even ordinary Level 150, Tier 5 NPCs.

Lastly, Shi Feng had given the 24 God Crystals they acquired during these past four days to Gentle Snow, Aqua Rose, and Fire Dance to upgrade their Fragmented Legendary Equipment to Legendary rank. Even Cold Shadow’s eyes had grown bloodshot at this sight, envy filling her heart. At this time, Fire Dance, who was scouting ahead of the team, suddenly reported through the team chat, “Guild Leader, I found a primordial ruin!”
