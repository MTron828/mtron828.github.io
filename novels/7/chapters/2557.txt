Chapter 2558 – Wildly Arrogant Zero Wing

Upon hearing Old Forest’s words, Magic Flash gasped.

“Fine-Gold Set Equipment that can be used up to Level 120?”

Currently, the best-known Fine-Gold Set Equipment in the Dark World could be used only up to Level 105. Even Dark Rhapsody’s peak experts sported only Level 105 Dark-Gold Equipment, which was the equivalent of Level 110 Fine-Gold Equipment, hardly comparable to Level 110 Fine-Gold Set Equipment.

Level 120 Fine-Gold Set Equipment was simply unimaginable.

“That’s right. Aside from Level 100-plus Epic Equipment, there’s no better equipment than this in the entire Dark World,” Old Forest said, nodding as he tried to suppress the excitement in his heart.

If the price was indeed 15,000 Darkness Crystals for Level 120 Fine-Gold Set Equipment, then it was definitely acceptable.

This was especially true when the Dark World’s various powers were frantically raiding Level 100 Team Dungeons. Due to the abysmally low drop-rate for Level 100-plus weapons and equipment, these powers were not making any significant progress with their Dungeon raids. This, in turn, led to a stagnation in their development. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he could secure a batch of Dark Demon Sets for Divine Society, then his Guild would have a massive advantage over the other Guilds. With this advantage, they could easily earn back the cost of the Dark Demon Sets.

As soon as Old Forest finished speaking, excitement also shone in Magic Flash’s eyes. Magic Flash immediately said, “Guild Leader Black Flame, Dark Rhapsody will also buy everything you have! Darkness Crystals definitely aren’t a problem!”

If he could get his hands on multiple Dark Demon Sets, then the plate armor classes of the Guild’s main force would be in for a wonderful time. They wouldn’t have to worry about finding equipment before reaching Level 125. Moreover, the main force would also have a much easier time raiding Level 100 Team Dungeons. In fact, Dark Rhapsody might even become the first Guild in the Dark World to clear a 100-man, Level 100 Team Dungeon.

The Dark Demon Set’s production is much more difficult than you think. I don’t have many sets available. Even now, we have managed to produce only four sets,” Shi Feng said, chuckling at the longing expressions of the two people before him.

Shi Feng wished he could produce as many Dark Demon Sets as he wanted. However, the Dark Demon Set was actually Level 110 to Level 120 Dark-Gold Set Equipment. The materials needed to produce it were extremely rare, which severely limited its production volume. Moreover, even when making the failed version of the Dark Demon Set, the production success rate was only 50%.

“Only four sets?”

Magic Flash and Old Forest felt a little disappointed when they heard Shi Feng’s words. However, after giving the matter some thought, they found it reasonable. After all, this was Level 120 Fine-Gold Set Equipment they were talking about. If it were so easy to produce, Zero Wing would be invincible.

“Of course, it isn’t exactly impossible if your two Guilds wish to purchase them in large quantities,” Shi Feng said, smiling when he saw the disappointment on the two men’s faces.

Upon hearing Shi Feng’s words, Old Forest immediately understood what Shi Feng was insinuating. Without hesitation, he replied, “Guild Leader Black Flame, please state your conditions. So long as they are within my authority, I can definitely agree to them on behalf of Deity Society.”

Just being able to purchase a few Dark Demon Sets at 15,000 Darkness Crystals per set could already be considered a miracle—all the more so for purchasing a large batch of the sets. With a sufficiently large number of the sets, a Guild could raise the overall strength of its main force by a large margin. Zero Wing was naturally under no obligation to give away such a wonderful opportunity to their two Guilds.

“It is the same for my side as well,” Magic Flash said. If he missed out on such a windfall, his Guild Leader and the Elders of the Guild would beat him to death when he returned. On the other hand, if he succeeded in this negotiation, then he would make a huge contribution to the Guild.

“Although the production of the Dark Demon Set is difficult, manufacturing several sets a day is still feasible. Zero Wing is willing to supply these sets to your two Guilds long-term,” Shi Feng said. “However, I hope that your two Guilds can help Zero Wing’s Candlelight Trading Firm establish itself in the Dark World’s major NPC cities and guarantee the safety of its operation.”

Silence momentarily fell over the entire room after Shi Feng finished speaking, as both Magic Flash and Old Forest looked at him in astonishment. They never thought that Zero Wing’s Guild Leader had such enormous ambitions.

The Dark World was equivalent to roughly three ordinary empires on the main continent. The Otherworld’s player population was larger than even that of the Fire Dragon Empire, one of the Four Great Empires of God’s Domain.

As the Dark World had been sealed all this time, it had almost no contact with the main continent whatsoever. Hence, the Dark World’s various powers thoroughly monopolized the Otherworld’s NPC cities. Moreover, the NPC cities found in the Dark World were different from those found on the main continent in that players held partial authority over them, which made taking over the Dark World’s NPC cities incredibly difficult for outside powers.

Meanwhile, the opening of the Dark World’s portal now presented both the Dark World’s powers and the main continent’s powers with a huge business opportunity. Needless to say, the main continent’s various superpowers would definitely contest over this opportunity and would naturally be willing to offer unimaginable prices.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, I’m afraid I don’t have the authority to decide on such a matter,” Old Forest stated honestly. “Moreover, this matter involves a lot of interests. Even if Zero Wing is offering up the Dark Demon Set, I do not believe my superiors will agree to your condition.”

As for Magic Flash, he inwardly rolled his eyes at Shi Feng’s demand.

The Dark Demon Set might be capable of further elevating the strength of their Guilds’ main forces, but its value was nothing compared to the wealth of three empires’ worth of players. This was also one of the reasons why the various superpowers were avoiding hostilities with Dark Guilds, as doing so would mean losing a massive business opportunity.

At this moment, let alone team leaders like Magic Flash and Old Forest, even the other four members of the party disdained Shi Feng. Shi Feng was actually trying to secure such a huge business opportunity by offering just a few sets of Fine-Gold Set Equipment. Did he take them for fools?

Moreover, Zero Wing was already having problems keeping its position in Cold Spring Forest, yet Shi Feng actually wanted to enter the Dark World’s various NPC cities. This was a complete and utter joke.

“Don’t be in such a rush to reject my offer. I understand that this involves a lot of benefits. I know even the Dark Demon Set is insufficient to persuade your two Guilds,” Shi Feng said, chuckling at the duo’s reactions. “However, what if I can make it so that the people of your two Guilds can freely move between the Dark World and Cold Spring Forest, while everyone else from the Dark World cannot?”

“Guild Leader Black Flame, what do you mean?” Old Forest asked, unable to grasp Shi Feng’s meaning.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, you should know that the portal connecting the Dark World and the main continent has already been opened. The Dark World’s players can come and go as they wish. This is something even Flaming Light, the holder of the portal’s key, cannot stop. What can Zero Wing possibly do?” Magic Light said, laughing.

“I don’t know whether Flaming Light can stop those players or not, but from now onward, Zero Wing is taking ownership of the Dark World’s portal in Cold Spring Forest!” Shi Feng said, smiling. He paid no attention to the ridicule Magic Flash and the others were displaying.
