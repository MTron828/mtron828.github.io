Chapter 319 – Ancient River’s Top 100

“Impossible!” Thousand Scars instinctively denied the words of the people around her. “You must be mistaken. Black Flame should still be in the Miniature Ancient World. How could he appear in the Greater God’s Domain’s Ancient River Kingdom?”

Her homeworld’s passage had yet to fully open, so her homeworld and the Miniature Ancient World remained isolated from the Greater God’s Domain. Meanwhile, before the World Passage opened, nobody in the Miniature Ancient World could leave it.

Moreover, it should be known that Black Flame had only appeared in the Top of Two Worlds’ new God Mode Regional Dungeon a few days ago and fought against the Paimon Conglomerate’s Meteor. It was because of this fight that he had managed to remain within the top 10 of the Miniature Ancient World’s God-ranked Expert List and gained some fame among the Greater God’s Domain’s various hegemonic powers.

It had only been a few days since then, yet she was supposed to believe that Black Flame had not only traveled to the Greater God’s Domain somehow, but he had even entered the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition and received a challenge from the Markless Blade? Even fantasies wouldn’t sound so far-fetched.

!!

“It shouldn’t be a mistake,” the cute girl said, shaking her head. “The Seven Luminaries Alliance is currently broadcasting the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition. The broadcast of Black Flame’s battles has also received the Alliance’s confirmation, and over 100,000 people have already paid to watch the broadcast. Everyone is paying close attention to see whether Black Flame can pass the preliminaries’ four rounds and get promoted into the official competition to fight against Vice Commander Markless.”

Although she did not know how strong Black Flame was exactly, Markless Blade was a big shot in Star Lake City. He was also the target of worship for many young men and women in the city. It was especially so for those seeking to join the Star Lake Legion.

Markless Blade was obsessed with training. Apart from participating in resource battles between cities, he would rarely show himself in public. Even his participation in the Ancient River Kingdom’s Rookie Competition had gone unknown initially.

If Markless Blade hadn’t taken the initiative to publicly announce his challenge to Black Flame, nobody would have thought that Markless Blade was actually taking part in the Rookie Competition.

Hence, the people seeking to join the Star Lake Legion curiously wondered whether Black Flame was strong or not. If Black Flame was sufficiently strong, they’d be able to observe Markless Blade’s strength during the official competition. They could also get to know more about him. That way, they’d have a better chance at joining Markless Blade’s battle group after they joined the Star Lake Legion.

The Star Lake Legion would recuit 1,000 people through its selection every year. After factoring in some special recruits, a little over 1,000 people would join the legion each year. After having existed for so many years, the Star Lake Legion possessed a very large number of official participants. Meanwhile, to manage all these participants effectively, the legion had split its official participants into teams and battle groups.

Firstly, players would be split into three teams according to their tiers. One team would be for Tier 4, one for Tier 5, and one for Tier 6. Then, each team would be split into multiple battle groups, and these battle groups would be further divided into ordinary battle groups and ace battle groups.

Normally, ordinary battle groups would be led by team leader-level participants, while the legion’s vice commanders would lead the ace battle groups. Among these two types of battle groups, members of ace battle groups would get to enjoy special privileges in the legion. Their chances of promotion in the legion were also much higher than members of ordinary battle groups.

“There are over 100,000 spectators already?” a short-haired beauty exclaimed. “I recall the Seven Luminaries Alliance charges an exorbitant viewing fee. The price to spectate individuals starts at 10 Star Coins and increases depending on their popularity, and the person being spectated can get 10% of the earnings. If there are 100,000 spectators already, the number of spectators might increase to over a million by the time Black Flame makes it into the official competition!”

In addition to being one of the most ancient powers in the Greater God’s Domain, the Seven Luminaries Alliance was also an information broker for all sorts of information. It had branches in the Greater God’s Domain’s various cities. So long as players paid the Alliance a fee, they could spectate the competitions organized by the Greater God’s Domain’s various kingdoms and empires. Meanwhile, the players being spectated would receive 10% of the generated profits.

Depending on the popularity of the player being spectated, the viewing fee the Seven Luminaries Alliance charged would also differ. For someone as famous as Markless Blade, it wouldn’t even be strange for the Alliance to charge double their minimum.

Because of this service, many top-tier experts who were famous in the Greater God’s Domain didn’t even need to join any corporation or power. By simply participating in battles and competitions taking place in the various kingdoms and empires, they could generate enough income to cause even corporations to grow envious.

Currently, even though news of Markless Blade’s challenge had just spread, over 100,000 people had already bought the viewing rights to watch the upcoming duel. It should be known that this was before Black Flame had even gotten promoted into the official competition. Once Black Flame successfully entered the official competition, the number of spectators could easily exceed one million. In that case, Black Flame could earn a minimum of one million Star Coins.

For ordinary participants in the Star Lake Legion, it would take them at least two or three years to earn one million Star Coins. Yet, Black Flame could earn this sum in only one competition… FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“A million Star Coins a competition?” Thousand Scars couldn’t help but grow a little envious when she heard the short-haired girl’s words.

She might receive a lot of resources as an internal member of the Paimon Conglomerate, but competition between the conglomerate’s internal members was incredibly fierce. She’d have difficulty competing with her peers if she relied solely on those provided resources. If she wanted to stay competitive, she would need to acquire additional resources.

However, if she wanted additional resources, she would have to acquire them herself.

She was still in her newcomer period in the Greater World, so she could use this advanced training room, which helped her improve her physical fitness and combat reactions rapidly, for free. However, once her one-month newcomer period ended, she would have to pay Star Coins to use this training room.

Not to mention, the advanced training room wasn’t even the best training room available in the God’s Domain Association. It was only the best training room that she could use for free during her newcomer period.

Above advanced training rooms, there were special training rooms, which cost 10,000 Star Coins per day. There were also meditation rooms that could help improve mental strength, and those similarly cost 10,000 Star Coins per day to rent.

These were places that many of the Paimon Conglomerate’s top-tier internal geniuses frequented. Some of these geniuses had even built an exclusive meditation room in their homes to have a greater chance of becoming a three-star mental strength grandmaster and getting promoted into an executive in the Paimon Conglomerate.

Although the Flower of Seven Sins had invested heavily into her, the organization could only earn a very limited amount of Star Coins before their homeworld’s World Passage fully opened. Moreover, the Flower of Seven Sins couldn’t afford to invest all of its Star Coins into her since it still needed to develop its other geniuses. As a result, the amount of Star Coins she received was nowhere near enough to put her on par with the Paimon Conglomerate’s top-tier internal geniuses.

Although the young masters of many companies and corporations in Star Lake City had sent her gifts…

One million Star Coins!

This sum was far more than what she had earned throughout her time in Star Lake City…

“Black Flame simply got lucky, Qianhen,” the cute girl said when she noticed the envious look on Thousand Scars. Then, she smiled and continued, “This will be the only time he can earn such a large sum. Another opportunity like this won’t come again for him in the future. Once Vice Commander Markless defeats him, nobody will pay attention to him anymore. Moreover, with your talent and beauty, you can easily get the various corporations’ young masters to line up before you. Any one of those people is easily a hundred times richer than Black Flame.”

Thousand Scars nodded to the cute girl and stopped paying attention to Black Flame’s matter. Instead, she walked into the reaction training room and started another training session.

There were countless geniuses and powerhouses in the Greater God’s Domain. There were also many geniuses and powerhouses who would appear and vanish like shooting stars.

Black Flame might have attracted Markless Blade’s interest, but his fame would be short-lived. It was simply impossible for a wild expert with no background like Black Flame to make any waves in the Ancient River Kingdom and Myriad Forest Empire, places where countless geniuses resided. Only the geniuses and paragons nurtured by the various hegemonic powers could survive long enough to spread their fame across the entire Greater God’s Domain.

…

While Star Lake City was in an uproar over Markless Blade’s challenge, Shi Feng’s group of three was conquering the Rookie Competition’s preliminaries one round after another in the Ancient River Secret Land.

Early morning the next day, the brutal preliminaries involving the participation of over a million geniuses finally ended.

Unsurprisingly, Shi Feng, Midsummer, and Wu Xiaoxiao passed all four rounds of their preliminaries and were successfully promoted into the official competition. As soon as the official competition’s 100 participants were decided, they were forcibly teleported to the Ancient River Secret Land’s central zone.
