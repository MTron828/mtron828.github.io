Chapter 2356 – Primal Void Stone Room

The Crimson Sunset radiated such a colorful glow that it illuminated the entire Meditation Room. Its aura was just as intense as that of Great Lord ranked monsters.

The strengthening effect improved it so drastically? Shi Feng read the Crimson Sunset’s statistics in shock.

He was already overjoyed that he had successfully produced the Advanced Mana Set Equipment. He hadn’t actually expected to trigger the Blacksteel Insignia’s effect as well. Now, the Crimson Sunset’s Basic Attributes could practically rival a Tier 3 Mana Set Equipment.

Mana Equipment wasn’t like ordinary equipment. It traded durability, which would continue to deplete with each use, in exchange for greater performance. Because of this, players could exhibit extraordinary strength with Mana Equipment.

If a Level 100, Tier 2 expert wore Tier 2 Advanced Mana Set Equipment, they could solo a Level 100 High Lord. Normally, a Tier 2 expert couldn’t even solo a Level 100 Lord and would need a full party to take one down.

This was why Shi Feng was so determined to produce the Crimson Sunset.

Zero Wing already had an adequate number of peak combatants, but when it came to lower-grade experts, the Guild was no match for the various superpowers.

If he could arm Zero Wing’s core experts with the Crimson Sunset, their combat power would undergo a qualitative transformation, and they’d only be weaker than true Tier 3 experts.

Now that he had the experience of producing the Crimson Sunset, Shi Feng began to mass-produce the Mana Set Equipment.

His production success rate was still quite low, but one Crimson Sunset would instantly arm Zero Wing with a Tier 2 expert that had the combat power to rival peak experts. Not even the various superpowers were capable of accomplishing this feat. Furthermore, the Crimson Sunset would be immensely helpful to players when they challenged their Tier 3 Promotion Quests.

Following which, Shi Feng forged 22 Crimson Sunsets, only stopping when he received a message from Melancholic Smile. She had contacted him to inform him that the second batch of Primal Void Stones had been retrieved from the Shared Warehouse. Blue Bay City’s members had also added the third batch to the Shared Warehouse.

They’re finally here. After reading Melancholic Smile’s message, Shi Feng decided to take a break from the Crimson Sunset’s production for now.

It took 24 hours to transfer items through the Shared Warehouse. Although the Shared Warehouse could only hold 200 Primal Void Stones at a time, it was the most convenient method for transferring non-bag space items that Zero Wing had right now. If he had to rely on the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship, it would take more than 24 hours to receive a shipment from Blue Bay City.

With two transfer cycles, White River City’s Candlelight Trading Firm had 400 Primal Void Stones in stock. Although 400 Primal Void Stones were far from enough to construct a building, they’d be more than enough to build a small room.

A small room might not be useful for combat players, but it would be for Lifestyle players. They didn’t need a lot of workspace, after all.

Shi Feng then contacted Melancholic Smile and had her deliver the Primal void Stones to one of the small reception rooms on the top floor, and he began to modify the room.

Shops in NPC cities had fixed layouts for their workshops, and players weren’t allowed to modify them, but the reception rooms and offices were a different story. Since these rooms didn’t have a specific function, players could modify them as they wished.

To protect the Primal Void Stones secret, Shi Feng saw to the modifications himself. Fortunately, one didn’t need to be an architect to complete the task.

Finally, after more than a dozen hours of work, Shi Feng had replaced the walls, ceiling, and floor with Primal Void Stones, spending 376 stones in total. If Sinned Heart saw the room, he’d have a heart attack.

If they had sold those stones, they would’ve earned nearly 20,000 Gold.

Even the various superpowers would find a 20,000-Gold modification to a small reception room to be a stroke of madness.

And yet, Shi Feng wasn’t satisfied. He also set up a Mana Gathering Magic Array within the room, increasing the room’s Mana density even further. Combined with the Primal Void Stone’s Mana gathering properties, the Mana in the small reception room was only slightly less dense than in the Research Workshop.

These Primal Void Stones are amazing! This is only a small room, yet it can improve a player’s mental strength by 20%. If I construct an entire building, I can likely increase that boost to 30%, Shi Feng thought as he sensed the improvement to his mental fortitude.

If he could train in such an environment, he might even be able to execute a perfect Lightning Flash, even if he were still at Tier 2. The Primal Void Stones were far more effective than he had expected.

Tools that could improve a player’s mental strength by 10% in God’s Domain already sold for astronomical amounts of money. One might not even be able to exchange a Fragmented Legendary item for such a tool.

However, a Primal Void Stone room could improve a player’s mental strength by 20%. Shi Feng finally realized why the various superpowers in the past had reserved their Primal Void Stone houses for their own use, refusing to rent them to outsiders. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Once he was satisfied, Shi Feng contacted Silent Wonder and requested her presence.

Silent Wonder had a huge headache from trying to create her new potion, having reached a bottleneck. She wanted nothing more than to spend the 48-hour day in the Research Workshop, but upon receiving Shi Feng’s order, she had no choice but to set aside her research and begrudgingly visit the small reception room in question.

“Guild Leader, this room...”After a moment in the small reception room, she was stunned by the sensation of it.

Silent Wonder hadn’t felt anything in particular when she had first entered the room. She had merely felt a refreshing coolness spread throughout her body, but after five seconds, she noticed that her mind was far clearer than before. In addition, her physical control and Mana had increased substantially.

“It’s not bad, right?” Shi Feng asked, chuckling at Silent Wonder’s shocked expression. “The Research Workshop can only provide a rough guideline. You’ll have to figure out the details on your own. Meanwhile, this room will help improve your control. You can spend time here to learn the techniques and concepts you’ve struggled with. With this environment, your chances of creating a new recipe should rise to 70% or 80%, right?”

“The room is simply magical! Forget 80%. I’m sure I can create a new recipe if I work in here for the next four or five days!” Silent Wonder excitedly and confidently exclaimed.

While in this room, she could finally understand some of the aspects of the Droplet of Life Recipe that had confused her. Moreover, the Advanced Magic Arrays she had struggled with no longer seemed difficult. She was 90% sure that she could draw the necessary arrays to produce the Droplet of Life now.

“Good, then. I’ll have Melancholic send some alchemy tools up in a moment. If you come across anything you can’t figure out in the Research Workshop, you can come here to figure it out,” Shi Feng said, not surprised in the least by Silent Wonder’s declaration.

A room of Primal Void Stones would even be useful to Grandmaster Lifestyle players, not to mention Master Lifestyle players. With Silent Wonder’s talents, it’d be a joke if she couldn’t become an Advanced Master Alchemist with the help of this room.

Once she had everything she needed, Shi Feng stopped bothering Silent Wonder and returned to his own Basic Meditation room to continue his work with the Crimson Sunset Mana Set Equipment.

With access to the Primal Void Stone rooms, Silent Wonder completed her promotion to Advanced Master rank in four days, becoming the first Advanced Master Lifestyle player in the Candlelight Trading Firm.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng worked arduously for five straight days, leveling up from 103 to 104. His leveling speed was absurdly fast for someone of his level. He had also produced 86 Crimson Sunsets, although he had blown through all of Zero Wing’s stockpiled Magic Crystals.

While he’d been busy, Fire Dance, Gentle Snow, Violet Cloud, and Aqua Rose had returned from the Tower of Four Gods, all four now at Level 100. Shi Feng instructed the four women to learn a Bronze Combat Technique using the Ocean Barrier Stones before he sent them off to challenge their Tier 3 Promotion Quests.

“Guild Leader, Azure’s people have arrived. They say they’re here to take me to the competition venue,” Silent Wonder suddenly contacted Shi Feng to inform him.

“They’re here?” Shi Feng set his tools down. Nodding, he continued, “I’ll go with you.”
