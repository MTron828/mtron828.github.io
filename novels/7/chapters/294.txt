Chapter 295 - Mirage Beast

Although Shi Feng was incensed by this news, Fire Dance and the others would have long since lost their lives by the time he arrived at the Silverleaf Forest.

“Alright, I’ll contact Gentle Snow immediately.” Shi Feng disconnected his call with Aqua Rose after saying so. He then called out his friends list, selected Gentle Snow’s name, and chose to contact her.

It was a fact that Ouroboros and Zero Wing were allies. Since an ally was under attack, Gentle Snow naturally did not refuse to send reinforcements when Shi Feng asked. Moreover, Gentle Snow had found out about this entire matter a step ahead of Shi Feng. Hence, she had already organized her subordinates even before Shi Feng contacted her, and they were just about to hurry over to the Silverleaf Forest right at that moment.

Gentle Snow had gathered 2,000 members from Ouroboros to aid Zero Wing. Of them, 500 were elite members of the Guild. Such a powerful force would pose a huge threat to the 6,000 members of Dark Star blocking the way into the Silverleaf Forest.

“Many thanks for your help, Miss Snow. In the future, members of Ouroboros that shop at the Starstreak Trading Firm can enjoy a 10% discount on all products,” Shi Feng said in thanks.

“You said this yourself. I’ll gladly accept your offer, then.” Gentle Snow revealed a faint smile. Currently, over half of the player population in White River City was patronizing the Starstreak Trading Firm. After all, not only were the items sold there of good quality, there was also a large selection available. Moreover, the product supply was plentiful. Normally, the various Guilds in White River City would always make a trip to the Starstreak Trading Firm before they went Dungeon-diving. If Ouroboros could receive a 10% discount when purchasing items there, it would save the Guild a lot of money.

“Really, though, just what is going through the minds of those people in Dark Star? It would be fine if it were just the usual minor skirmish. However, they have actually declared an all-out war on Zero Wing. Isn’t Lone Tyrant afraid that his Guild might suffer heavy losses and lose the ability to compete for the First Clear of the Three Great Dungeons?” Gentle Snow commented curiously.

The competition over the First Clear of the Three Great Dungeons had already reached its most crucial moment right now. Moreover, Dark Star only had the final Boss left to defeat in order to snag the First Clear of the Land of Death—and gain an absolute advantage over the other Guilds.

However, Dark Star had instead chosen to take action against Zero Wing at this critical junction.

God’s Domain had been launched just recently. At this early stage of the game, everyone was busy leveling up and raiding Dungeons to strengthen themselves. Guilds, in particular, were deeply afraid of falling behind others. Even if conflict arose between Guilds, both sides would usually choose to show restraint.

After all, an all-out war between Guilds would profit nobody. Worse, they might even get taken advantage of by a third party. If such a situation were to truly occur, then the damage to both Guilds would grow even more massive. Hence, unless there was a huge disparity in strength between both sides, nobody would casually choose to start a war.

Dark Star and Zero Wing were both among the top six Guilds in White River City, so the difference in strength between the two Guilds was not particularly wide. No matter how Gentle Snow looked at the situation, she could not figure out why Dark Star would choose to suddenly declare war.

“I am afraid that the one starting the war this time around isn’t Lone Tyrant, but the organization that’s backing him, Underworld,” Shi Feng said, laughing bitterly.

“Underworld!” Gentle Snow couldn’t help but wrinkle her eyebrows at this revelation. “So that’s how it is. I’ve been wondering how Dark Star had managed to suddenly obtain so many experts. It turns out the mysterious power supporting Dark Star is Underworld. However, how did you manage to find out about this? Even though I’ve planted many spies inside Dark Star, I never managed to uncover the forces hidden behind Dark Star.”

“Feng Xuanyang from Underworld came looking for me to buy some of Zero Wing’s shares. However, the price he offered was simply too low. I rejected his offer, so now he is trying to get back at me by destroying Zero Wing.” Shi Feng revealed the truth.

Gentle Snow immediately understood the situation after listening to Shi Feng’s words.

It was no wonder Dark Star was completely unafraid of commencing an all-out war. With Underworld’s background, it only needed to field a part of its forces located in the eastern region of Star-Moon Kingdom to completely destroy Zero Wing. With such a large disparity in strength, it was natural for Dark Star not to fear a war.

“So it is Feng Xuanyang. He is indeed a person who would take revenge for the slightest of offenses. However, with Underworld’s financial power, his offer to buy Zero Wing, which possesses a Guild Residence, should not have been low. At the very least, he should have offered 500 to 600 million, right?” Gentle Snow came to an abrupt realization. However, she also felt curious about this matter, as the Feng Xuanyang she knew was not a tightfisted person.

“One billion Credits and several hundred experts. In addition, they would also provide 100 Gold Coins as support every week,” Shi Feng said.

“One billion Credits and also 100 Gold Coins per week? Feng Xuanyang sure is generous. Even I might feel tempted if given such an offer. Yet, you actually complained that it’s too little? No wonder he’s angry.” Gentle Snow chuckled softly.

Shi Feng simply replied with a faint smile, not bothering to give an explanation on the matter.

Aside from a few core Guild members knowing about the Purple Sun Mansion being their new Guild Residence, nobody else knew anything about it. The others only knew that Zero Wing possessed a Guild Residence. They were not clear where exactly it was located. After all, there were simply too many plots of land available in White River City. Moreover, the Purple Sun Mansion was currently under reconstruction. It would take two more days before it can be used and also unveiled to the public.

Following which, Shi Feng made some small talk with Gentle Snow before ending the call. He then proceeded to start the 7th trial.

If nothing unexpected happened, the 2,000 players led by Gentle Snow could definitely break apart Dark Star’s encirclement around the Silverleaf Forest. Hence, what Shi Feng needed to do now was to increase his own strength by obtaining even better tools and equipment, slowly and gradually enhancing their Guild’s foundation.

In regard to the battle at the Silverleaf Forest, Shi Feng could only play the role of an observer. Even if he were to rush over there right this instant, everything would have long since been over by the time he arrived.

However, Shi Feng would definitely remember this debt of hatred. Sooner or later, he would repay this debt to Dark Star and Underworld ten times over.

The stage for the 7th trial was an ancient coliseum.

The moment Shi Feng laid eyes on his opponent, he was immediately shocked by what he saw.

“Why is it myself?”

Shi Feng looked at the familiar figure gradually appearing at a corner of the coliseum, feeling very surprised. However, when he used Observing Eyes on this twin of his, he immediately came to an understanding.

[Mirage Beast] (Rare Special Elite)

Level 20 Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

HP 200,000/200,000

This Mirage Beast was capable of replicating the appearance and skills of an enemy. However, unlike players, it had a frightening amount of HP. In a one-on-one situation, players would find it extremely difficult to kill the Mirage Beast.

In God’s Domain, the only advantage players had over monsters was the diversity of skills they possessed. Meanwhile, players could use these skills in various combinations to exert even stronger power. Yet, if the Mirage Beast possessed the same skills that players did, then players would lose even that little advantage they had. When comparing the power of skills, the Mirage Beast’s skills might even be more powerful than the players’.

“Good timing. I was just thinking of trying out a few things.” Shi Feng advanced, immediately directing a Chop at the Mirage Beast.

Meanwhile, the Mirage Beast had similarly charged at Shi Feng, and it, too, had sent a Chop at Shi Feng.

The moment the two swords clashed, sparks flew all around.

However, when all was said and done, Shi Feng was still a player. In terms of Strength, he was still far inferior to the Mirage Beast. Hence, Shi Feng was easily repelled, forced by the Mirage Beast to retreat step by step. Meanwhile, the Mirage Beast was also superior in terms of Attack Speed.

Although the ensuing damage from a collision of weapons was small, after clashing for tens or even hundreds of times, Shi Feng would eventually lose his life. After all, the Mirage Beast possessed 200,000 HP, while Shi Feng’s HP was just slightly over 2,600 after reaching Level 21. Moreover, Shi Feng was receiving more damage than the Mirage Beast from their exchanges.

Not to mention, both sides were also executing various skills.

When Shi Feng used Thundering Flash, the Mirage Beast would activate Windwalk to dodge the attack. It would then counter with a Thundering Flash of its own. Knowing that he could not receive the attack directly, Shi Feng, too, activated Windwalk to dodge. However, the Mirage Beast activated Wind Blade to immediately appear before Shi Feng. It then followed up with a Chop, sending an extremely quick vertical slash down towards its prey.

Shi Feng hastily used Parry to block the Mirage Beast’s Chop. He countered with a Thunder Flame Explosion right away. In the end, however, the Mirage Beast used Parry to fend off the powerful attack.

Shi Feng then followed up with a Flame Burst, which was promptly countered with a Defensive Blade by the Mirage Beast.

The exchange between both sides was extremely intense.

After a dozen seconds or so, Shi Feng’s HP had fallen to 60%. On the other hand, the Mirage Beast had lost only a negligible amount of HP. Just the Mirage Beast’s battle recovery negated most of the damage Shi Feng had caused.

“As expected of the 7th trial, even the monster’s normal attacks and skills are used with such viciousness.” However, instead of feeling afraid, a sense of excitement was bubbling within Shi Feng at the moment.

“However, do you know this move?” Shi Feng looked at the Mirage Beast, a faint smile appearing on his face. He then proceeded to activate the Black Emperor Inheritance.

Dark fog immediately started emerging from the Abyssal Blade and then entered Shi Feng’s body.
