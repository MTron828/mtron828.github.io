Chapter 945 – Suppressing the Four Royals

Above Plot 079…

The spectating players were shocked as the Thunder Empire, the Sun Dynasty, and Ninth Street joined the fight with their Epic Siege Weapons.

“Madness! This is madness! Four royal powers are working together to attack one person?!”

“Four Epic Siege Weapons! Such a force is likely already enough to raid Taboo Bosses!”

One player against four Epic Siege Weapons. This was undoubtedly a first in God’s Domain.

…

“Is there a need to go this far for one person? Do these royal powers not care about their reputation?” Verdant Rainbow, watching the battle in Plot 079 from another plot of land, couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the four royal powers using their Epic Siege Weapons against Shi Feng.

Normally, it would already be considered excessive for a royal power to use even one Epic Siege Weapon to deal with an apex power. As for the situation before where the Thunder Empire had used an Epic Siege Weapon against Ink Crystal, it was also an incredibly rare occurrence, and it had only happened a few times throughout the Holy Race’s and the Crystallian race’s history.

However, Verdant Rainbow had never thought that the four royal powers would be willing to use the four Epic Siege Weapons against Shi Feng. Not even royal powers had received such a treatment before.

“It can’t be helped. Black Flame poses too much of a threat to them,” Elder Martial said, shaking his head. “Black Flame has shown he can take on an Epic Siege Weapon by himself. If he escapes, he can undoubtedly affect the four royal powers’ plans and rankings. To protect their interests, they cannot let him get away.”

“Even so, isn’t this too much? Four Epic Siege Weapons! This much force is already enough to deal with a royal power!” Verdant Rainbow exclaimed, staring at the four Epic Siege Weapons in the Magic Mirror.

According to the information collected by the Seven Luminaries Alliance, the number of Epic Siege Weapons each royal power possessed ranged between one and four. Hence, a force of four Epic Siege Weapons was enough to take down most royal powers. Yet, such a force was now being used against Shi Feng…

…

Besides Verdant Rainbow, Lunar River also found the four royal powers’ behavior unbelievable. Never even in her wildest dreams had she thought the four royal powers would take Shi Feng so seriously.

“Vice Guild Leader, we still have a Divine Boundary Breaking Scroll. We should leave immediately. If we wait any longer, we might miss our chance to escape,” Shuoyun hurriedly reminded Lunar River when she saw that the battle in the sky was about to begin.

Although the four Epic Siege Weapons had placed a lockdown on Plot 079’s space and made it impossible for players to leave normally, their team just so happened to be carrying a Divine Boundary Breaking Scroll. With this scroll, they could leave through a teleportation passage, even if their surrounding space was sealed using World Power.

“It’s not the right time yet,” Lunar River whispered, her eyes fixated on Shi Feng’s unwavering figure. “The Divine Boundary Breaking Scroll needs time to form a teleportation passage. Although the four royal powers have their attention on Black Flame right now, they are also keeping an eye on us. We will use the scroll once the fight truly begins.”

“But there are four Epic Siege Weapons. I’m worried that Guild Leader Black Flame might not survive long enough for the passage to finish forming,” Shuoyun said worriedly as she watched Shi Feng clash with Evil Nature’s Blood God’s Heaven. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Although Shi Feng was evenly matched with Blood God’s Heaven, the balance would quickly collapse when the three other Epic Siege Weapons joined the fight. Once that happened, she wouldn’t even be surprised if the fight ended in a few exchanges. At that time, King’s Paradise’s team would lose its chance to escape.

“There’s nothing we can do about it. We can only pray he holds out for a while,” Lunar River said, her gaze still locked on Shi Feng’s figure.

Although Lunar River was frustrated by Shi Feng’s incredible display of strength, she could only hope that he could do better and last a little longer against the four royal powers’ Epic Siege Weapons. Otherwise, every King’s Paradise member here would die.

…

In the air, the battle played out as Shuoyun had anticipated.

As soon as the three other Epic Siege Weapons joined the fight, Shi Feng struggled to keep up. He could only execute one combat technique at a time to attack or defend. With the precise and coordinated attacks of the four Epic Siege Weapons, two or three attacks could always find their way past his guard.

After the two sides fought for about five seconds, Shi Feng had already lost over 20% of his HP.

“Black Flame! Let’s see how long you can hold on this time!” Slumbering Vocalist’s face shone with joy when he saw Shi Feng’s HP bar decreasing rapidly. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before he could pay Shi Feng back for the humiliation Zero Wing’s team had put him through.

As Slumbering Vocalist spoke, a Lightning of Destruction conjured by the Lightning Nation whizzed toward Shi Feng. Just as Shi Feng was about to block it with his claw, a flash of inspiration hit him, and he promptly retracted his claw.

Now that I’ve mostly adapted to using combat techniques, it’s time to try using Mana Techniques! As Shi Feng looked at the oncoming bolt of lightning, he gathered all available energy within a 10,000-yard radius at his tail and swung it as if he were swinging a sword.

Goddess-ranked Mana Technique, Dark Moon!

Boom!

Shi Feng’s tail bisected the Lightning of Destruction, which could rival Pseudo-Tier 7 Spells, cut through the Lightning Nation’s defensive barrier, and hurled the Lightning Nation back several hundred yards.

A loss of 129 durability points?! How is this possible?! Parting Forest was dumbfounded when he saw that the Lightning Nation had lost not only its defensive barrier but also 129 durability points.

Just a second ago, Shi Feng could only match the attacks of their Epic Siege Weapons. Yet, a second later, he had shattered the Lightning Nation’s attack and damaged the Lightning Nation directly. This situation was incomprehensible to Parting Forest.

The loss of 129 durability points was especially mind-blowing. It should be known that the Lightning Nation currently only had a little over 10,000 durability points remaining. Although it had a maximum durability of 100,000 points, it had already seen some wear and tear when the Thunder Empire found it. Its heavy use over the years had also taken quite a toll.

In other words, Shi Feng’s attack had caused the Lightning Nation to lose about 1% of its current durability. This was more than what the Epic Siege Weapon had lost over the past decade.

Before Parting Forest could recover from his shock, Shi Feng attacked the three other Epic Siege Weapons with Dark Moon, pushing them back over a thousand yards and causing them to lose nearly 200 durability points each. This situation immediately sent Slumbering Vocalist and the others into a panic.

Sure enough, a Primordial Dragon’s control over magic elements is much stronger! Shi Feng was very satisfied with the damage he dealt the Epic Siege Weapons, and he couldn’t help but want to continue testing his attacks on them.

However, before Shi Feng had time to execute another Dark Moon, Slumbering Vocalist and the others opened up space-time passages and retreated with their respective Epic Siege Weapons, none staying behind to fight Shi Feng…
