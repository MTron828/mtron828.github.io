Chapter 209 - Lone Tyrant Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Hearing that someone approached, Stabbing Heart thought that it was Shi Feng. Hence, he turned his gaze towards the entrance.

However, the person walking over was not Shi Feng at all. Moreover, it was not just a single player, but a group of players.

This was a 20-man team. The members of this team all wore impressive equipment; practically all of them wore a mix of Bronze and Mysterious-Iron Equipment, with the majority being Mysterious-Iron Equipment. There were also a few players among them wearing Level 10 Class-specific Set Equipment that only dropped from Level 10 Team Dungeons. Although they were only individual pieces, at this stage of the game, they were definitely considered top-tier equipment to Guilds.

The leader of this team was a Guardian Knight. Judging by appearances, the man looked to be around 25 years of age. There was a nasty smile on the man’s face. The man wore a mix of red and white-colored heavy-armor and carried a blood-red cross-shield and longsword.

“It can’t be, right? That Shield Warrior has the complete Bloody Brilliance Set Equipment! That’s a Level 10 Mysterious-Iron Set Equipment!”

“The glow from his shield and longsword show that they are both of Secret-Silver rank. How come I have never seen such equipment before?”

The members of Assassin’s Alliance started a quiet discussion when they saw the leading Guardian Knight.

The Bloody Brilliance Set Equipment could only be obtained from Level 10 Hard Mode Team Dungeons. The fact that this group of newcomers had gathered a full set displayed just how powerful their team was.

“They seem to be players from Dark Star.” Making a careful observation, Stabbing Heart suddenly discovered that the Guild Emblem these players donned belong to that of the Guild, Dark Star. He then observed the leading Guardian Knight, suddenly exclaiming in shock, “He’s Dark Star’s Lone Tyrant!”

Cruel Sword’s complexion immediately turned grim at these words.

Lone Tyrant of Dark Star was currently number one on the Ranking List. In addition, Dark Star had also managed to obtain the First Clear of two Hard Mode Dungeons. Due to the contribution of these two factors, Dark Star was already like the sun at high noon, and they were currently in their heyday. Cruel Sword did not think that Dark Star would make their move so soon; they were already attempting to raid a 20-man Team Dungeon. If they really obtained the First Clear of a 20-man Team Dungeon, the Assassin’s Alliance would truly be in an embarrassing position in White River City.

After all, due to obtaining the luxury guidebook of White River City in advance, the Assassin’s Alliance had made ample preparations before entering the city itself. As a result, they enjoyed a flourishing period after they entered White River City. Many players even thought that the Assassin’s Alliance had the possibility to surpass the first-rate Guilds.

Hence, now that Dark Star was on the rise, players would naturally compare the Assassin’s Alliance and Dark Star, resulting in the Assassin’s Alliance’s status in White River City becoming very awkward.

“Oh? Isn’t this the Guild Leader of the Assassin’s Alliance? What a coincidence!” Lone Tyrant laughed as he spoke to Cruel Sword, “Unfortunately, you guys have simply wasted your time by coming here, as the First Clear of the Hard Mode Beastman Munition Factory already belongs to Dark Star.”

The other members of Dark Star similarly revealed disdainful smiles as they looked at the members of the Assassin’s Alliance.

Currently, throughout the White River City region, Dark Star’s influence surpassed that of the Assassin’s Alliance. Moreover, Dark Star had a much shorter history than the Assassin’s Alliance. The Assassin’s Alliance current success lay in the fact that they had a long-established history, so the benefits they provided to their Guild members were slightly better. However, Dark Star would definitely surpass the Assassin’s Alliance in the future.

“We’ll see about that.” Cruel Sword ignored Lone Tyrant’s provocation, only coldly replying with a single sentence.

Only by personally experiencing it would one understand the difficulty of a 20-man Hard Mode Dungeon. It would be meaningless to argue with a little bastard over who would obtain the First Clear of a Hard Mode Dungeon.

When Lone Tyrant saw that his provocation had failed, he quickly lost interest and turned to leave.

At this moment, a deep and low voice resounded by everyone’s ears.

“Sorry, I’m late.” The person speaking was precisely Shi Feng.

As he had to repair his equipment, store his items in the Bank, and register more Hard Stones on the Auction House, he had wasted quite a lot of time before coming here.

“Brother Ye Feng, you’re finally here!” Stabbing Heart, who was originally enraged due to Lone Tyrant’s provocation, immediately cheered up when he noticed Shi Feng’s arrival. He hurriedly went up and welcomed Shi Feng.

Meanwhile, this was the first time Cruel Sword had personally met Shi Feng. He discovered that Shi Feng still used a complete Bronze Set Equipment. Shi Feng’s level and the quality of his other equipment were also indiscernible. Moreover, looking at Shi Feng’s age and appearance, he was obviously just an immature youth; he did not possess the sharp temperament of a top-tier expert at all. However, he had obtained the First Clear of the Hell Mode Dark Moon Graveyard with Gentle Snow. Coupling that with the widespread battle footage from before and the fact that Shi Feng was the first player to enter White River City, Shi Feng should possess some real skills.

However, they were not here to fight other players in the Dungeon. Although Shi Feng had impressive combat capabilities, one could not clear a Dungeon by depending on combat capabilities alone. Hence, Cruel Sword did not look favorably upon Shi Feng.

“Hahahaha! What a joke! So even the famous Assassin’s Alliance has to invite someone to raid a Team Dungeon! Moreover, you’ve even invited an independent player! It seems that the Assassin’s Alliance only amounts to this much. To think that I’ve always thought of the Assassin’s Alliance as an actual opponent, I was truly blind!” Lone Tyrant looked at Shi Feng, then turned to look at Cruel Sword again before involuntarily laughing.

“You!” Stabbing Heart wanted to flare up in rage; however, he had no counter to Lone Tyrant’s words.

After all, what he said was true.

The other Assassin’s Alliance members had also lowered their heads in shame. At this moment, their hearts harbored dissatisfaction towards Stabbing Heart. They were already disappointed with Stabbing Heart’s previous decision of inviting Shi Feng, so the humiliating situation now only made it worse. Yet, although they wished they could immediately chase Shi Feng away, they dared not voice their opinions.

After making fun of the Assassin’s Alliance, Lone Tyrant’s gaze shifted towards Shi Feng. Pretending to be surprised, he sneered and said, “And here I thought the Assassin’s Alliance had invited some amazing person. Isn’t this Ye Feng, the first player to enter White River City and the previous first place on the Ranking List?”

“I am truly sorry about this. I never imagined that you would be so easy to surpass, so I accidentally snatched away your first position. Oh? That’s not right? Why can’t I find your name within the top 100 of the Ranking List? It seems that there is a limit to a person’s good luck. Without any real strength, one would quickly be surpassed by others. Isn’t that right, Little Brother Ye Feng?”

Although Lone Tyrant could not see Shi Feng’s current level, he did not think that Shi Feng was anything amazing. Otherwise, why would he choose not to display his level? There was only one possibility for such an action, and it was because he was too shameful to show his level. Shi Feng was clearly the first player to enter White River City, yet, a majority of players surpassed him in levels. So it was very logical that he would choose to hide his level in shame.

“Brother Ye Feng, let’s just ignore him and enter the Dungeon.” Afraid that Shi Feng would grow angry and leave, Stabbing Heart hurriedly dragged Shi Feng away from the players of Dark Star.

“The players within the White River City region have constantly used the Assassin’s Alliance as a comparison to Dark Star. Previously, I had felt proud of this matter, but now, I can only feel embarrassment. Please don’t associate Dark Star with you all anymore in the future. We really can’t bear this sort of shame.” Lone Tyrant did not care much about an expert who was already past his prime. He shifted his gaze once more to Cruel Sword, mocking him.

“An apex second-rate Guild? Pah! They aren’t even comparable to a third-rate Guild!”

“The Assassin’s Alliance has truly declined. If I were them, I would have long since killed myself to avoid the embarrassment. They have actually allowed a lucky noob to join their team. Did they think that, by doing so, they could obtain the First Clear of the Hard Mode Beastman Munition Factory? Who are they trying to kid?”

“How could you say such a thing? This is known as birds of a feather flocking together! A trash of a Guild would naturally seek out a trash player to aid them! If this situation happened in our Guild, we would have long since expelled such noobs from the Guild! Allowing such trash to join our team would definitely lower our intelligence and strength!”

“Hey, you’ve got that wrong! In reality, the Assassin’s Alliance is so powerful that they are not afraid of having a noob as a team member! They could still clear the Hard Mode Beastman Munition Factory with no problems, even with such a member on their team! This is definitely something Dark Star can’t dream of comparing with!”

The relationship between Dark Star and the Assassin’s Alliance had long since been similar to that of fire and water. Now that there was such a good opportunity, the members of Dark Star took this chance to ridicule the Assassin’s Alliance.

Immediately, the atmosphere on the Assassin’s Alliance’s side became abnormally depressing. The players from the Assassin’s Alliance all resentfully glared at Stabbing Heart.

Contrary to expectations, however, Stabbing Heart did not feel any heartache due to these hateful gazes. Instead, he felt apologetic to Shi Feng. Originally, Dark Star merely directed its ridicule at the Assassin’s Alliance. Now, even Shi Feng had been dragged into this matter.

At this moment, Shi Feng could no longer stomach this situation. If this situation continued, they would have no chances of raiding the Dungeon, and he did not wish to lose the opportunity. After all, he planned to obtain the Wind Extinguisher Set Equipment and Basic Fire Resistance Potion Recipe from this trip. He did not wish to see Dark Star spoil this opportunity.

Having no better choice, Shi Feng stood out from the crowd. With pupils as deep as black holes, he gazed at Lone Tyrant. He then calmly said with a smile, “I’m very curious about something. If the nobodies that you’ve looked down on suddenly obtain the First Clear of the Hard Mode Beast Munition Factory a step ahead of you, then what would you all amount to?”
