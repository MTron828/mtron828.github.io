Chapter 585 – City Treasury

“A Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique?”

“Are you sure you’re not mistaken, Commander Heads? I heard that the humans have hardly any Saint-ranked Mana Techniques, while Primordial God-ranked Mana Techniques are no different than myths to them.”

When the team leaders of the legion led by Hundred Heads heard his conjecture, they quickly voiced their doubts.

The Holy Race and the human race might be from different factions and completely different worlds, but the Holy Race still had a certain degree of understanding regarding the human race.

Meanwhile, according to their understanding, Saint-ranked Mana Techniques were considered by humans to be the best Mana Techniques available, whereas Primordial God-ranked Mana Techniques didn’t even exist for humans. Otherwise, human players wouldn’t be so weak on average.

“No, I’m certain the attack he used is a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique!” Hundred Heads firmly stated. “Have any of you recorded the battle just now? I’m going to send it to Lord Thunder,”

“I did, but will you send it to Lord Thunder, Commander? Wouldn’t we be in for dire consequences if it turns out not to be a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique?” a team leader voiced his concerns anxiously.

While the Mana Techniques created by the humans’ Primordial Gods could only be used by human players, the strength of Primordial Gods was evident. In a one-on-one situation, not even their Holy Ancestors could be a match for the humans’ Primordial Gods. So, one could say that Primordial Gods were extremely skilled in using their available strength.

It was also why the Holy Race’s many powers had offered lavish rewards for anyone who could get their hands on the humans’ Primordial God-ranked Mana Techniques. These powers intended to use these Mana Techniques as a reference to enhance their Holy Power usage.

However, Primordial God-ranked Mana Techniques were simply too difficult to come by. Even after scouring the entirety of their own Greater God’s Domain, they failed to find even a trace of a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique.

Hence, if they were to present a clue that could reliably lead to the procurement of a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique, they would have made a huge accomplishment. And should this clue lead to the acquisition of an actual Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique, the various powers would definitely reward them handsomely.

But conversely, if the clue provided was false, they should also be prepared to face the wrath of the various powers.

“Don’t worry; I’ll take full responsibility!” Hundred Heads stated after he obtained the battle video from one of his subordinates. Then, he proceeded to forward it to Royal Thunder without hesitation. At the same time, he mentally added, But I’ll also take full credit for it.

…

On a certain street lined with ancient buildings forged completely out of steel, several Holy Race legions were currently engaged in heated combat with several Half-Snakekin monsters.

Many of these Half-Snakekin monsters were at the Tier 5 Legendary rank, and even the weakest among them was a Tier 4 Superior Mythic. Their levels also ranged from upwards of 170, and their numbers exceeded 10,000. These Half-Snakekins would also come together to fight using combination combat techniques, making it difficult for even individual and small parties of Tier 5 players to fight them.

However, under the might of the Holy Race’s several Tier 5 legions, the Half-Snakekin army quickly shrunk in size.

“How interesting. One of the humans from just now actually possesses a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique,” Royal Thunder, who was commanding the battle from the rear, said with a smile after reading a report he just received.

“A Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique?” Extreme Feather, standing next to Royal Thunder, revealed a look of interest when she heard the other party’s words. “Is the report accurate, Your Highness?”

“Seeing as Hundred Heads decided to send me this message, he must be very confident in his judgment,” Royal Thunder said. Then, he turned to Extreme Feather and asked, “Why, has your interest finally been piqued?”

“You jest, Your Highness. How can anybody not be interested in a Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique?” Extreme Feather responded. “Do you want me to go and capture the person for you now?”

“It’s not an urgent matter,” Royal Thunder said, waving his hand. “According to the report, the human named Black Flame has already entered the city. In that case, he must have been randomly teleported to somewhere in the city. This zone is special, so it will be difficult for the humans to leave, even if they want to. Not to mention, Black Flame is an expert of the Tier 6 Realm. I don’t doubt he and his party can traverse the city so long as they are careful, so it is only a matter of time before we encounter them. It won’t be too late to capture him when that happens.”

Extreme Feather nodded in agreement.

Of the groups that had entered the nameless city, the legion directly under Royal Thunder’s command should be the only group capable of taking down an expert of the Tier 6 Realm. The other powers’ legions would be helpless against an expert of such caliber, so there would be no need to fear that Black Flame’s party might get killed by other Holy Race legions.

In addition, the nameless city was a special zone that allowed players to leave via the designated exit found in the city’s depths. If players couldn’t find the exit, they would be trapped in the city for the rest of their lives, and not even in death could they leave the city. Thus, so long as their legion blockaded the city’s exit, they were bound to be able to intercept Black Flame’s party.

…

Meanwhile, as Royal Thunder had predicted, the Dawnlight Party was currently cautiously making its way deeper into the city.

“The monsters here feel endless. We can’t even finish a wave before another one comes at us,” Splashing Fire complained, his scalp tingling when he saw another group of several hundred Half-Snakekin monsters charging at their party. “We’ll die from exhaustion at this rate.”

“Don’t complain and be grateful, Fire,” Moon Bamboo, who was fighting against a Legendary-ranked Half-Snakekin Chieftain, said to Splashing Fire. “It is only thanks to Guild Leader Black Flame that we can enter the city. The drop rate of these monsters is more than double that of the monsters outside. There are also no Holy Race players here to harass us. Even if we end up dying a dozen times here, we will still end up making a huge profit once we leave.”

Everyone else nodded in agreement.

Normally, they would be forcibly teleported back to the Eternal Continent if they were to die on the Western Continent. However, when they entered this nameless city, they were informed that they would be resurrected inside the city should they die in the city. This point alone already made it worthwhile for them to face the endless hordes of monsters. Not to mention, the monsters inside the city had a significantly higher drop rate.

Even though they had only killed a few waves of Half-Snakekin monsters thus far, they had already acquired one Combat Secret Treasure and several Common Secret Treasures. They had even obtained as many as two Common Mana Purification Techniques.

Common Purification Techniques might be widely available in Seven Luminaries Town, but they were far from worthless. At present, players seeking to exchange a Common Purification Technique would have to fork out a Combat Secret Treasure. The average party would also need three or four days to get its hands on a Common Purification Technique.

In contrast, their party had already obtained two Common Purification Techniques and one Combat Secret Treasure after just ten minutes of grinding.

“We won’t have to worry about dying from exhaustion,” Shi Feng said as he joined the conversation. Then, while observing the surrounding Half-Snakekin monsters, he continued, “Half-Snakekins are nocturnal, and their senses are heightened at night. So long as we persist until daylight, we should be able to eliminate a wave of these monsters before another wave discovers us.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Half-Snakekins weren’t particularly rare monsters in God’s Domain, so everyone quickly recalled the habits of Half-Snakekins after hearing Shi Feng’s explanation, and they couldn’t help but sigh in relief. This meant that so long as they rested during the day, they should have no trouble surviving in the city.

…

Subsequently, time passed, and five days went by in the blink of an eye.

Throughout these five days, the Dawnlight Party ceaselessly fought at night and rested during the day to recover their Stamina and Concentration. Meanwhile, not only did every party member level up to 163 and beyond, but the party also obtained over 200 Combat Secret Treasures and over 1,000 Common Secret Treasures. In addition, the party also obtained over seventy Common Purification Techniques and six Bronze Purification Techniques. Even after evenly distributing the loot, every party member still managed to fully equip themselves with Combat Secret Treasures.

“Brother Black Flame, I think I found the city’s treasury!” Sky Pivot, who was in the midst of scouting the city via his summons, suddenly said in the party chat.
