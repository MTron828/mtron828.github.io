Chapter 2385 – Western Continent

“A portal to the western continent?”

Yan Tianxing and the others turned to their Guild Leader in astonishment.

God’s Domain’s various powers were no longer ignorant of the western continent, and a few superpowers had already gained the ability to travel between the two main continents. The resources these superpowers had returned with had made the various powers jealous.

God’s Domain’s continents had very different cultures. Not only did their developmental directions differ, but each continent had largely different resources. Thus, each continent’s players could greatly benefit from the other’s resources.

Based on what Yan Tianxing and his comrades knew, players on the western continent had very different daily expenditures than those on the eastern continent.

The eastern continent’s players mainly relied on Coins as a currency due to the continent’s focus on combat techniques. Naturally, relying on combat techniques in battle placed a huge burden on weapons and equipment, and as a result, players spent a lot of their money on repair fees.

On the western continent, players relied on Magic Crystals more than Coins. The western continent’s players focused more on Basic Attributes and Mana use. Thus, they needed Magic Crystals to strengthen themselves and their weapons and equipment.

Of course, Magic Crystals were a rare and precious commodity on both continents, but due to the western continent’s developmental direction, Magic Crystals were worth far more there. In contrast, the materials to produce weapons and equipment were much cheaper than on the eastern continent.

If Zero Wing were able to travel between the two continents, it would become a true superpower in no time.

“That’s right. I discovered a hidden clue about a Magic Gate here, one that’s been passed down since ancient times. As long as we activate the Magic Gate, we’ll be able to travel between the continents,” Shi Feng said, making up a random excuse to avoid suspicion.

The various superpowers were desperately searching for ways to travel between the continents, but very few had succeeded. It’d be strange if he discovered a portal by chance.

“Is the portal stable, Guild Leader?” Yi Luofei eagerly asked. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

When they heard Yi Luofei’s question, the rest of the team perked up in curiosity. None of them doubted Shi Feng’s word. Players had discovered many of God’s Domain’s quests and portals through hidden clues. There was nothing strange about one of these clues leading to a portal connected to the two main continents.

Rather, everyone was more curious about whether or not the portal was safe.

If it were a single-use portal, it wouldn’t be of much help to Zero Wing. At most, they could make a quick buck by reselling the western continent’s resources once. However, if the portal were stable, they could continue to make money until travel between the continents became the norm. The difference between the two would be massive.

“Based on the clue I found, it should be,” Shi Feng said. “Unfortunately, we’ll only know how large the portal is once we activate it.”

The portal they were looking for was stable, or he wouldn’t have bothered to travel all the way out here, but since he had never seen or used the portal personally, he didn’t know its exact details.

On the eastern continent, the Ten Saints Empire had the most portals that led to the western continent. Based on what Shi Feng knew, there were nearly 10 stable portals in the empire, and among them, the largest and most stable was under multiple superpowers’ control. That was also the portal most players relied on to travel between the continents.

After considering Zero Wing’s situation, Shi Feng had decided that the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s portal was the best suited for his Guild.

This portal was incredibly stable. During Shi Feng’s previous life, a dark power had secretly controlled it. The public had only learned about its existence after travel between the continents had become more commonplace, and the various superpowers had grown to envy the dark power that had controlled this portal.

Shi Feng’s answer excited his team. The Guild really wouldn’t have to worry about its development if they could secure this portal.

While Shi Feng and his players conversed, the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship reached a frozen lake within the Demonwolf Mountain Range’s inner region.

A layer of snow covered the frozen lake, which was so large it could easily contain several cities. If the system map hadn’t labeled this area as a lake, players would’ve likely mistaken it for a snowy plain.

However, before the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship began to descend, the team was overwhelmed by an eerie feeling.

They looked down at the lake, noticing a large number of frozen humans and beasts. The human sculptures all wore the same armor and clothing, and the weakest among them was Tier 3. If the Ten Saints Empire’s players saw these human’s armor, they would’ve been shocked.

The armor and clothing those statues wore were that of the Sacred Brilliance Division, one of the Ten Saints Empire’s Seven Mythic Knight Divisions. The Seven Mythic Knight Divisions had been the Ten Saints Empire’s prided source of apex combat power since ancient times. It was rumored that just one of these Knight Divisions could destroy an entire kingdom.

However, these several thousand Knights stood, frozen, on the lake below. Based on their positions and expressions, it was obvious that these Knights had been frozen before they had even begun to prepare for battle...

Those were several thousand Tier 3 NPCs they were talking about!

Just thinking about the implications of this made Yan Tianxing and his companions shudder.

God’s Domain operated on a system of cause and effect. A group of Tier 3 NPCs wouldn’t freeze to death for no reason. Something must have attacked these Sacred Brilliance Division Knights.

The scene even dumbfounded Shi Feng. According to his information, there shouldn’t be any NPCs here, let alone one of the Seven Mythic Knight Divisions. All he should’ve needed to do was repair the Magic Gate and protect it from the monsters in the lake.

“Look at that statue, Guild Leader! It seems to be radiating a faint glow!” Blackie said as he pointed at an ice sculpture beneath the flying ship.

Unlike the other frozen Knights, the sculpture Blackie pointed to glowed with a faint, golden light. It was also dressed more luxurious than the rest and gave off a trace of Divine Might. The Divine Might didn’t originate from an item, but from the NPC himself.

A Hero!?

Shi Feng was surprised to see the frozen NPC in question.

Heroes were apex beings among the human race, and although everyone knew they existed, meeting a living hero was an extraordinarily rare encounter. Most Heroes had died ages ago and only retained a fraction of their original strength.

And yet, Shi Feng could tell that the frozen Hero below him was still alive.

“Guild Leader, should we check them out?” Blackie asked.

“Let’s go take a look,” Shi Feng agreed after considering the situation.

They didn’t really have a choice. The Magic Gate they were after was sealed under the Hero’s feet. They couldn’t avoid approaching the NPC unless they gave up on the Magic Gate.

Shortly after the Crimson Dragon Flying Ship landed on the lake, a deep, powerful voice addressed the team. “Adventurers, might I trouble you to remove this seal?”

Shi Feng, the team leader, then received a system notification.
