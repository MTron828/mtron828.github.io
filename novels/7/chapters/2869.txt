Chapter 2870 - Shi Feng’s Sword

Fire Dance’s words resounded like thunder in the reception room, causing silence to descend on the room momentarily. Yuan Tiexin and Purple Jade also stared at Fire Dance reflexively.

Has she lost her mind?

Both Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe were big shots who spoke and acted on behalf of their respective Guilds.

The two had behaved rudely to show off their power and gain an advantage in their upcoming negotiations with Zero Wing, but Fire Dance’s words cornered them; they couldn’t back down without harming their reputation. If these two old men got angry for real, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Although Zero Wing City had many Tier 4 players and NPCs defending it, if the two old men were intent on making a ruckus, it would take a long time for the city to suppress them. They might even escape capture. After all, this wasn’t the first time they had done such a thing.

Most importantly, the two of them represented Mythology and Solar Temple, two of the Five Great Super Guilds.

Moreover, compared to the other three, these two Super Guilds held far greater influence on the eastern continent. The two Guilds might currently be incapable of retaliating against Zero Wing, but as holders of reserve seats for God’s Domain’s Twelve Great Guilds, they could ruin the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom with just a word. Now that the Outerworld’s forces were rapidly expanding their influence, the NPC kingdoms and empires had limited combat power to spare. As a result, the united army these countries formed couldn’t protect every kingdom on the continent. With the resumption of the war imminent, if Mythology and Solar Temple requested the NPC forces not to defend the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom, the two kingdoms would face swift destruction.

Without the support of these two kingdoms, even if Zero Wing had Zero Wing City and the ability to teleport between the two continents, its income would still plummet.

This was because most of the independent players and Guild players visiting Zero Wing City could reach the city only via Sky Spring City’s Teleportation Hall. It wasn’t possible to teleport to Zero Wing City from other NPC cities. If Sky Spring City disappeared, these players would naturally lose the means to teleport to Zero Wing City.

Meanwhile, Zero Wing couldn’t garrison any other NPC city at this time.

The special rights Zero Wing received from the War God’s Temple as a reward from the reserve seat competition were a one-time privilege. If Zero Wing wished to garrison another NPC city, it would have to become a reserve for God’s Domain’s Twelve Great Guilds. However, this wasn’t possible right now.

This was also precisely the reason Mythology, a Guild that had been suppressing Zero Wing all this time, dared to come to Zero Wing’s doorsteps and negotiate for partnership.

The next moment, Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe turned to Fire Dance, a hint of coldness and playfulness in their eyes.

“Little girl, we traveled a long distance to come to negotiate a partnership with Zero Wing. Is this how Zero Wing treats its guests?” Situ Qingtian asked as he visually inspected Fire Dance. Revealing a faint smile, he continued, “If Zero Wing doesn’t wish to partner with Mythology, Mythology will naturally find it unfortunate and frustrating. However, if Zero Wing comes across difficulties in the future, don’t blame Mythology for not helping.”

“Situ’s words might not sound nice, but they are logical.” Chiyang Tianhe also looked at Fire Dance and said in a deep voice, “We came here with kind intentions. Now that the Outerworld’s forces have invaded the eastern continent, only by cooperating will we be able to stop their advance. If we separate on bad terms here, the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom will suffer.”

When Fire Dance heard the two elderly men’s words, her complexion sank.

She never expected the two of them to suddenly stand on the same side and work together to pressure Zero Wing.

Seeing Fire Dance’s grim expression, Situ Qingtian chuckled and said, “I know you have your own difficulties, young lady. I’m sure you just made an unintentional mistake just now. Your words represent only your thoughts, right?”

At this time, Situ Qingtian did not dare to truly offend Zero Wing. After all, the benefits of Zero Wing City were too great to pass on. However, he still had to teach Fire Dance a lesson and let her know that she couldn’t provoke just anyone in God’s Domain.

Chiyang Tianhe, who remained seated, nodded and chimed in, “That’s right. There are some things you can’t say arbitrarily, little girl. Elders like us might be able to ignore such a transgression, but if it were anyone else, your words would have severe consequences!” Nether King Relos shook his head and sighed at this situation.

Fire Dance was too young. Because of her inexperience, she had failed to notice that Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe had aimed for such an outcome right from the very beginning. They had deliberately made a commotion in the reception room in the hopes of hooking Fire Dance. Now that she had taken action on Zero Wing’s behalf, she was bound to suffer humiliation.

Driving away Mythology’s and Solar Temple’s members wouldn’t be possible unless Zero Wing was willing to abandon the profits of the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom.

Just when Fire Dance was at a loss as to what to say, the doors to the reception room suddenly opened. A tall figure then entered, looked at Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe, and demanded coldly, “Do you old fools think Zero Wing’s main force commander cannot represent Zero Wing? Or do you think Zero Wing is a pushover?

“I can tell you now that Fire Dance’s previous words represent my will! You may leave now!” Shi Feng did not speak loudly, but a bone-chilling cold enveloped the entire room at his words. Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe, in particular, were dumbfounded. Even Relos, who had been a spectator all this time, was stunned. He never thought that Shi Feng would chase off Mythology and Solar Temple without any negotiations.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, aren’t you going a little too far?” Situ Qingtian asked in a cold voice. “Our two Guilds have come in sincerity. Are you going to abandon the Twin Towers Kingdom and Star-Moon Kingdom just because of a little girl’s few words?”

At this time, Chiyang Tianhe interjected hurriedly, “Guild Leader Black Flame, must you take things so seriously? We were merely making a joke.”

“Abandonment is a joke?” Looking at the two elderly men before him, Shi Feng sneered, “You two think too highly of yourselves! I’ll give you five seconds to leave! Otherwise, I’ll send you back myself!”

Shi Feng’s words shocked everyone present once more.

Is he really going to do that? When Yuan Tiexin looked at Shi Feng, he felt that Shi Feng was even crazier than Fire Dance.

Fire Dance had merely acted to preserve Zero Wing’s reputation. However, Shi Feng was blatantly declaring war on Mythology and Solar Temple.

After this declaration, even if Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe previously wanted to pursue negotiations for a partnership, they wouldn’t do so anymore. “Good! Very good!” Situ Qingtian suddenly smiled as he looked at Shi Feng. “This old man admires your will to make an enemy out of Mythology and abandon two kingdoms. However, I’m curious to see how you plan on sending this old man back!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After saying so, Situ Qingtian stood up and unsheathed the dark greatsword slung on his back. Simultaneously, not only did his body radiate a frightening aura, but the Mana surrounding him also took on a near-liquid form, sparkling as it circled his silvery-gray armor. Sensing the pressure he radiated, Fire Dance and the other youngsters in the room subconsciously took a step back.

As expected of this old bastard! His Mana Body has broken through the 115% threshold! He can probably hold his own against even a Superior Mythic monster of the same level now! Relos was astonished when he sensed Situ Qingtian’s unparalleled aura.

“Everyone has been saying that you are God’s Domain’s strongest, Guild Leader Black Flame. This old man has been curious about the validity of this rumor for a long time now!”

After Situ Qingtian unleashed his aura, Chiyang Tianhe, who sat nearby, also stood up and raised a crimson staff. The white robe he wore instantly transformed into a robe of flames, making it seem as if the God of Fire had just descended to the mortal world. The aura he radiated was not the slightest bit inferior to Situ Qingtian’s, and his level had even surpassed Situ Qingtian by one, at Level 154 already.

Amazing! So, these are the apex combatants of these two Super Guilds? Yuan Tiexin was astounded as he looked at Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe.

Under normal circumstances, the average Tier 4 expert would have difficulty fleeing from a Superior Mythic monster of the same level, let alone fighting one. Yet, these two elderly men now radiated an aura rivaling that of a Superior Mythic monster of the same level. Their combat power ranked at the very top of God’s Domain at this stage of the game. Now, even a dozen Tier 4 experts working together would most likely have difficulty suppressing Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe. Not to mention, the two’s combat standards were incredibly close to reaching the Beyond Domain Realm.

Let’s see how you recover from this now, Black Flame!

Cold Shadow, who now stood at a side, grew excited when she saw that Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe intended to take action.

She might not know precisely how powerful Chiyang Tianhe was, but she knew how powerful Situ Qingtian was. Moreover, it had been a long time since she had seen Situ Qingtian take action.

With the two of them working together, even a monster like Shi Feng would have difficulty defeating them within a short period.

A fight between Shi Feng, dubbed God’s Domain’s strongest expert, and two legendary figures in the virtual gaming industry deserved to be called an apex battle in God’s Domain. If both sides fought for a sufficiently long time, she might gain enough insight to improve her combat standards further.

Cold Shadow wasn’t the only person with such thoughts. Purple Jade, Netherworld Empire’s masked youth, and Solar Temple’s long-haired youth were similarly curious to see how this fight would play out.

“Since you two want me to send you back, I’ll grant you your wish!”

After glancing at the two elderly men, Shi Feng stopped concealing his aura and Mana. Immediately, the space within the room froze, a stifling pressure enveloping everyone. Even Situ Qingtian and Chiyang Tianhe subconsciously stumbled two steps back, their eyes filled with fear and confusion as they gaped at Shi Feng. Tier 5?

The same question simultaneously ran through the minds of the two elderly men. However, before they could respond to the situation, Shi Feng suddenly appeared before them, his movements so fast that it seemed as if he had split into two. Shi Feng then stabbed their hearts with his sword.

Afterward, Shi Feng returned to one entity, now standing quietly by the window wall behind the two elderly men. And before anyone realized what had happened, the sword in his hand was already back in its sheath, as if Shi Feng had never drawn it.

Meanwhile, Situ Qingtian’s and Chiyang Tianhe’s HPs, which exceeded ten million, had zero out by the time everyone realized what was going on. The two’s bodies then collapsed to the ground, neither managing to react from start to finish.
