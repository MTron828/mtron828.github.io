Chapter 425 - Jack of All Trades

After the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest unlocked, Shi Feng immediately tried to open it.

The instant Shi Feng touched the treasure chest, however, a sudden sense of danger flooded his mind. He felt as if some poisonous snake stared at him, his body trembling involuntarily.

“Guild Leader, what’s wrong?” Fire Dance, who stood to one side, asked curiously when she saw Shi Feng freeze.

Shi Feng did not answer Fire Dance’s question immediately. Instead, he frowned at the golden treasure chest in front of him, before examining his surroundings.

Suddenly, he discovered that the terrain here was somewhat unique.

The ground 30 yards around the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest was slightly indented. Although the ground around the treasure chest was 15 centimeters lower, the difference was indistinguishable due to the large area and the dim lighting in the cave.

To Shi Feng, whose five senses were extremely acute, he could even discover traces of spiderwebs.

While adventuring in the fields of God’s Domain, one would frequently stumble across traps. These traps were very powerful, and in the past, many players had given their lives to these traps. High-tiered players were no exception. In the past, while Shi Feng was a Tier 3 Sword King, he had fallen into a trap, losing his life. Hence, no one could afford to be careless while adventuring in the wild.

With the strange terrain before him, how could Shi Feng not grow suspicious?

“Fire Dance, stay 40 yards away from this place.” Although Shi Feng did not know what was special about the area, he would not give up this Dark-Gold Treasure Chest.

Even the most inferior quality item in a Dark-Gold Treasure Chest was Dark-Gold rank. There was even a small chance to obtain an Epic item.

“Mhm.” Although Fire Dance had no idea what was happening, she listened to Shi Feng’s command and distanced herself over 40 yards from the treasure chest.

As a safety precaution, Shi Feng unsheathed the Abyssal Blade from his waist.

Phantom Kill!

A doppelganger suddenly appeared beside Shi Feng. For 40 seconds, Shi Feng could swap positions with his doppelganger instantly.

Shi Feng had his doppelganger move 40 yards away from the treasure chest as well.

“Alright, everything seems in place.”

After Shi Feng prepared for the potential trap, he slowly opened the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest.

The instant he opened it, a blinding light escaped from the treasure chest, illuminating the cave. After the light dispersed, Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the contents of the treasure chest.

A lone dark-blue crystal pendant sat inside the chest.

Previously, Shi Feng had gained multiple items from the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest he had opened in the God’s Grave. Among those items, the most valuable was the Forging Manual for the Dragonscale Set Equipment. Now, however, there was a single pendant inside this Dark-Gold Treasure Chest.

“I wonder what’s so special about this pendant.” Although Shi Feng was slightly disappointed, pendants were extremely rare in God’s Domain. Dark-Gold ranked pendants were more scarce. Although it could not compete with the value of the Dragonscale Set Equipment Forging Manual, it was still a considerable harvest.

The moment Shi Feng picked up the pendant, a light-blue magic barrier appeared 30 yards around the treasure chest, trapping Shi Feng within.

“A trap that imprisons people?” Shi Feng carefully observed his surroundings, noticing that the light-blue barrier had sealed him in completely.

“Guild Leader!”

Fire Dance immediately grew anxious. Dashing up to the barrier, she used Instant Kill, a Tier 1 Assassination Skill. The skill allowed her to attack her enemy with astonishing speed while inflicting massive amounts of damage. It was one of the fastest and most powerful skills among the Tier 1 skills of Assassins.

However, when Fire Dance’s swift and violent attack struck the light-blue barrier, her attack was ineffective. The collision did not even generate a small spark.

After Fire Dance attacked the barrier, the earth began to tremble.

An Earthen Guard suddenly clawed its way out of the ground within the barrier. Similar to the Flame Guards, the Earthen Guard was a Lord ranked monster.

[Earthen Guard] (Lord Rank)

Level 28

HP 1,000,000/1,000,000

Compared to the Flame Guards, however, the Earthen Guard’s Attack Power and Defense were far stronger. Although the Earthen Guard was inferior to the Flame Guards against a group of players, against a solo or a handful of players, it was significantly more devastating than the Flame Guards.

“So it’s a twofold killing-type trap.” Shi Feng suddenly understood his situation.

If any other player were trapped in this place, the Earthen Guard might annihilate them. Fortunately, Shi Feng was no ordinary player.

When the Earthen Guard swung its iron fist down on Shi Feng, the air felt as if it had been blasted apart. Not daring to tarry a second longer, Shi Feng immediately swapped places with his doppelganger.

In the blink of an eye, Shi Feng’s doppelganger arrived inside the barrier and sent a Chop at the Earthen Guard’s fist. Meanwhile, Shi Feng had arrived outside the barrier, standing safely where his doppelganger had been.

However, the difference of strength between the doppelganger and the Earthen Guard was massive. Not only did the Earthen Guard toss the doppelganger, smashing it into the barrier, but it also dealt a damage of over -1,200 points; the doppelganger lost close to one-third of its HP after a single hit. If it had not attacked with its sword, its HP would have fallen to critical levels. The Earthen Guard’s second punch would have then finished it.

Against the Earthen Guard, even Shi Feng would last a few hits at best.

“Let’s go,” Shi Feng said to Fire Dance, who stood by his side. He could not be bothered to manipulate his doppelganger.

“What about the Earthen Guard?” Fire Dance asked worriedly as she watched the Lord inside the Barrier.

Fire Dance knew about Shi Feng’s Phantom Kill skill. Although Shi Feng’s doppelganger only had 70% of his Attributes, it could still overshadow anyone else in the Guild. Yet, Shi Feng’s doppelganger had barely survived a punch from the Earthen Guard. Its frightening Strength definitely surpassed the Flame Guards by severalfold.

If such a powerful Lord ranked monster attacked the team, Cola and the others stood no chance against it.

“Relax. It can’t get out of there.” Shi Feng understood Fire Dance’s concern. Smiling faintly, he said, “The Earthen Guard should be the barrier’s core. If one wishes to break the barrier, they would first need to kill the Earthen Guard. If the Earthen Guard doesn’t die, the barrier will remain in place. Hence, even if the Earthen Guard were more powerful, it would never escape.”

With Shi Feng’s assurance, Fire Dance relaxed. Unable to help her curiosity, she then asked, “Guild Leader, what did you get from the Dark-Gold Treasure Chest? Not only was it locked, but it was also trapped. The item should be quite valuable, right?”

“Right, I had almost forgotten about it. There was only a single pendant inside the chest. I’m not sure what its quality is, either. However, at the very least, it should be Dark-Gold rank. We will have truly lucked out if it is an Epic item.” Shi Feng then took the deep-blue crystal pendant from his bag. As it was Unknown, it could neither be identified nor equipped.

“What a high-end item,” Shi Feng laughed as he shook his head.

He then activated Omniscient Eyes and began his appraisal. Compared to other advanced identification skills, Omniscient Eyes was a jack of all trades. It could ascertain, perceive, and appraise. It was very convenient.

During the later stages of God’s Domain, most items players found would be Unknown, and such items needed to be appraised before use. As a result, players had another thing they had to spend money on—appraisal fees.

The more valuable an item was, the higher its appraisal fee would be.

As a result, many players had chosen to take on Appraiser as a subclass. That way, they could earn an impressive income. Only, it was not easy to raise an Appraiser’s Proficiency. Hence, if one wished to have an advanced item appraised, they needed to look for NPC Appraisers.

If a player managed to learn Omniscient Eyes, they could simply set up their own shop and work full-time as an Appraiser. Their fees alone could grant them a life of luxury.
