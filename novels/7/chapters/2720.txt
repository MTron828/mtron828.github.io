Chapter 2721 – Uproar

“Guild Leader, did you see that?!” Purple Eye goggled in shock as she pointed at the huge crater in the holographic projection. “Gentle Snow, she... How did she...do that?”

“Gentle Snow should’ve destroyed the space in the surrounding area to annihilate Miracle’s 1,000-man team,” Galaxy Past answered calmly.

“No! I know that, but I’m not referring to that,” Purple Eye said, shaking her head. She then turned to Galaxy Past and continued, “I’m talking about Gentle Snow’s 12 consecutive slashes. She actually stacked the power of those 12 slashes!”

It was challenging to combine the power of multiple sources. The more sources one tried to combine, the greater the difficulty. In fact, the difficulty increased exponentially.

Even apex experts who had reached the Domain Realm could, at best, combine the power of six attacks.

Yet, now, Gentle Snow had actually combined 12 attacks into one. Moreover, she had accomplished this feat while wielding a greatsword. This was no longer a matter of strength. Such a feat should be impossible for humans!

Gentle Snow was a genius of their generation. They had also entered God’s Domain at the same time. Even if Gentle Snow had made rapid progress, reaching such a level should be possible for her. At this point, she couldn’t even be considered human anymore. She was a monster in human skin! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Purple, calm down,” Galaxy Past advised. “You should be aware of Zero Wing’s strength. Zero Wing has always been able to accomplish feats other Guilds can’t. Gentle Snow might’ve learned a powerful Skill that allowed her to perform such an action.”

Galaxy Past could sympathize with Purple Eye’s unreconciled and helpless feelings. After all, this kind of power already exceeded the realm of humans. It was no exaggeration to say that Gentle Snow had become an existence that they would never surpass in their lifetimes.

Meanwhile, inside a lounge in Miracle’s headquarters in the real world, the lids of two virtual gaming cabins opened slowly.

“We still died. We didn’t even have a chance to escape. With this, we’ll have to wait even longer before we can start our Tier 4 promotions,” Elder Roc grumbled as he sat up in his gaming cabin, a bitter smile forming on his face.

“We are lucky. If this were the preliminaries, we would’ve lost five levels.” Elder Feather frowned as he sat up in his cabin. A hint of awe appearing in his eyes, he continued, “Truly, that kind of monster isn’t something we can go up against. She actually destroyed the entire space to prevent us from escaping. Even short-duration Invulnerability Skills are useless against that kind of attack.” “Thousand Miles truly screwed us over. His information is absurdly inaccurate,” Elder Roc snarled. “In hindsight, that little girl is the real monster, not Black Flame!”

“However, it’s fortunate we came across her so soon. There is still time to salvage this situation,” Elder Feather said, smiling. “What do you mean, Old Feather?” Elder Roc asked, puzzled.

“I relayed this information to the Guild Leader before we got killed. I’m sure the others know about this by now,” Elder Feather said. “Now that it is revealed that Frost Heaven has a Higher Domain Realm expert in addition to Black Flame, I’m sure you should know what this means.”

“Are you saying the Guild Leader will relay this information to the other superpowers?” Elder Roc couldn’t help growing a little excited.

That was a Higher Domain Realm expert they were talking about!

On Island No. 3, there was no way Black Flame could cause an upset by himself. However, it would be a different story if a Higher Domain Realm expert were added to the equation. Zero Wing might actually be able to secure two Resource Nodes and become the sixth-ranked Guild on Island No. 3.

In that case, Frost Heaven’s chances of winning the sixth reserve seat would increase significantly.

However, once Miracle spread this information, the various superpowers would most likely band together to prevent Frost Heaven from ousting them.

Just as Elder Feather assumed, Miracle did not conceal Gentle Snow’s information. On the contrary, the Guild publicized it throughout the arena. Every participating Guild became aware of Gentle Snow’s existence.

“Higher Domain Realm? Zero Wing actually had such an expert?”

“Could Miracle be lying to us? That’s the Higher Domain Realm we are talking about. How can a little girl like Gentle Snow reach it?”

“That shouldn’t be the case. According to our members on Island No. 3, Gentle Snow did indeed clash with one of Miracle’s 1,000-man teams. Moreover, their fight created quite a commotion; it could be heard even from miles away. After our members inspected the battlefield through magical observation, they found that Miracle’s 1,000-man team had indeed been annihilated. Moreover, Gentle Snow had even wiped out Miracle’s team with just one move.”

For a time, the various participating Guilds had heated discussions over this matter. Although most of them remained dubious of the claim that Gentle Snow had reached the Higher Domain Realm, they were still afraid of her.

The Higher Domain Realm was a secret among the various superpowers. Ordinary players weren’t even aware of its existence.

Currently, those who had reached the Higher Domain Realm were old monsters belonging to the Five Great Super Guilds, and these old monsters almost never revealed themselves to the public. In fact, the public had mostly forgotten about them. However, the various superpowers understood that the reason the Five Great Super Guilds could be referred to as such was precisely because of these existences.

So long as this group of old monsters took action, even peerless experts wouldn’t be able to stop them. After all, peerless experts were merely a bunch of people still stuck in the Domain Realm; even the stronger ones had reached only the Domain Realm’s upper stage. A more significant part of the reason peerless experts were called as such was their Basic Attributes, which far surpassed those of other Domain Realm experts.

However, it was a different story for Higher Domain Realm experts. These existences possessed inhuman combat standards. Moreover, there was almost no trial in God’s Domain that could trouble them. They could easily overcome the hurdles they faced and secure as many opportunities as they wanted in God’s Domain.

One could say that in terms of both Basic Attributes and combat standards, Higher Domain Realm experts far surpassed peerless experts. Even one such existence could turn the tide of a war.

Now that Gentle Snow was suspected of having reached the Higher Domain Realm as well, the various superpowers would have no choice but to take precautions against her.

Meanwhile, when Frost Heaven’s members heard this piece of news, every one of them was shocked.

“How is this possible?! That Vice Guild Leader from Zero Wing is actually in the Higher Domain Realm?!” Brilliant Blue felt like he was dreaming when he read his subordinate’s report. He simply couldn’t bring himself to believe it.

This was the Higher Domain Realm they were talking about!

However, at this time, the various participating superpowers were all talking about this matter. Moreover, the Frost Heaven members with Gentle Snow acknowledged that she had single-handedly wiped out Miracle’s 1,000-man team.

Miracle even publicly admitted that Gentle Snow had killed Roc and Feather, two of Miracle’s Elders, in a single move.

After taking all these factors into account, this matter was almost certain to be true.

“The heavens haven’t forsaken Frost Heaven!” Seven Wonders grew ecstatic upon hearing this news. He then looked at Hong Xinyuan, who had reported the matter to him, and said, “Old Hong, you’ve really found a huge treasure for our Guild this time!”

“Guild Leader, you overestimate me.” Hong Xinyuan shook his head with a smile.

In reality, even he had not been aware that Gentle Snow had reached the Higher Domain Realm. Had he known, he wouldn’t have offered just three Upper Zone reserve slots to Zero Wing.

Meanwhile, when Muxin, on Island No. 3, received the news about Gentle Snow, she was lost in thought for a long time. “Black Flame! Is Gentle Snow really at the Higher Domain Realm?!” Muxin couldn’t help asking Shi Feng.

“Probably.” Shi Feng chuckled.

“Probably? What do you mean ‘probably’? Has she reached it or not?” Muxin got irritated at Shi Feng for persisting in keeping her in the dark.

The various superpowers already believed that Gentle Snow was a Higher Domain Realm expert. Yet, Shi Feng was still so close-mouthed about it.

Shi Feng couldn’t help smiling bitterly at Muxin’s reaction.

Truthfully, he didn’t actually know what realm Gentle Snow had reached. After all, he didn’t know what kind of world the Higher Domain Realm was. In addition, when he looked at Gentle Snow, he felt as if he was looking at a cloud. He couldn’t see through her at all.

However, while he didn’t know whether Gentle Snow was currently at the Higher Domain Realm, he was sure of one thing-Gentle Snow was undoubtedly number one in the world in combat experience.

“However, Miracle has played a really vicious move this time.” Shi Feng frowned as he read Miracle’s public announcement. At Shi Feng’s words, Muxin’s face darkened.

“Are you saying Miracle plans to kill with a borrowed sword?”

“That’s right.” Shi Feng nodded. “On the surface, Miracle is expressing its indignation over Gentle Snow annihilating one of its 1,000-man teams. In reality, it is announcing to the other Guilds that Frost Heaven has a great chance of securing the sixth seat. This way, the other Guilds will have to consider banding together to target Frost Heaven.” “What should we do, then?” Muxin understood how vicious Miracle’s move was. If they didn’t handle this matter properly, Frost Heaven might come under attack from all sides. “Should I notify my Guild Leader of this?”

Shi Feng sneered, “Since Miracle wants Frost Heaven to become a thorn in the various Guilds’ eyes, we’ll make the various Guilds understand that the sixth seat belongs to us!”
