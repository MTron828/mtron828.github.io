Chapter 498 - Overnight Fame

Although the competition only lasted a moment, none of the spectators had been disappointed by the show. On the contrary, the stands exploded with excitement.

“He defeated Master Lei Bao at such a young age; his future will definitely be limitless!”

“We really didn’t waste the trip!”

“Get Master Shi Feng’s address. Rearrange my schedule as well. We must pay Master Shi Feng a visit!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The audience was not comprised of your average citizens. Every one of them was a reputable member of society.

Now that Shi Feng had defeated a top-tier master like Lei Bao, his future was limitless. A small stage like Jin Hai City would not hold Shi Feng. He could only shine brightest on the world stage.

If they did not try to befriend Shi Feng now, they would never qualify to do so in the future.

However, compared to these guests, the Chairman of Big Dipper, Xiao Yu, was so happy that he had nearly failed to contain his grin. He had originally thought that Lei Bao’s willingness to become the training center’s Head Instructor had been Big Dipper’s greatest fortune. Xiao Yu had never expected Shi Feng to be so powerful, even capable of defeating a top-tier master like Lei Bao.

This was a top-tier master! Even throughout the whole country, such mighty individuals were as rare as phoenix feathers. If Big Dipper Training Center employed such a martial arts master, its popularity and business would undoubtedly skyrocket.

“Uncle Xiao, how do you plan to thank me? After all, it was I who introduced Shi Feng to Big Dipper!” Zhao Ruoxi grinned, her eyes flashing with pride and excitement.

She felt as if Shi Feng’s victory were her own, and she basked in the success.

“Of course, we can’t forget about you! In a moment, I’ll have a Diamond Member Card prepared for you. Big Dipper has only ever given out five of these Member Cards, so you’ll be the sixth,” Xiao Yu laughed.

Zhao Jianhua could not help his shock when he heard Xiao Yu’s words.

Big Dipper’s Diamond Member Card was extraordinary. As a Diamond Member, one would receive a 50% discount, and all monthly expenses under a certain amount would be waived. Throughout Jin Hai City, only five people had received such privileges, and neither Zhao Jianhua nor Zhao Ruoxi’s father were of those five. Yet, his niece had actually become the sixth person to become one of Big Dipper’s Diamond Members.

Indescribable feelings colored Zhao Jianhua’s stern expression. Before they, the older generation, could even reach this far, the younger generation surpassed them.

Of course, this was all accredited to Shi Feng’s achievement.

Now that Shi Feng had defeated Master Lei Bao, becoming famous overnight, even the giants in flourishing, first-rate cities would scramble to recruit Shi Feng, much less those in Jin Hai City.

At this moment, Xiao Yu was deeply afraid he could not hold back a true dragon like Shi Feng. Now that he had a chance to solidify Big Dipper’s relationship with Shi Feng, he would maximize their generosity.

After the competition ended, although Lei Bao had suffered relatively severe injuries, with the aid of modern technology and S-rank Nutrient Fluids, he would quickly recover to his peak condition.

“Master Shi Feng, I am convinced of my loss in this competition. Please don’t hold back and state your conditions. Since I have made the promise, I will not go back on my word,” Lei Bao said weakly as he joined Shi Feng in the lounge. At this moment, Lei Bao was still slightly pale.

Lei Bao did not think that it was a coincidence that Shi Feng just so happened to have broken past his limits, obtaining power and physical reactions beyond his body’s capabilities, in the moment between life and death. At the very least, Shi Feng should have already touched the boundaries of that realm.

Shi Feng was just a young man in his early twenties, yet, he had already reached such mastery. Shi Feng was easily stronger than Lei Bao himself.

Lei Bao could not wrap his mind around it. Even if Shi Feng began training while still inside his mother’s womb and had received all sorts of resources, he should not be able to obtain the power to surpass his physical limitations at such a young age...

If Lei Bao was a martial arts prodigy, then the man before him was a demon.

Even if he were not convinced of his defeat, he had to accept it.

“Since Master Lei Bao has agreed, then I want you to join my Workshop,” Shi Feng laughed.

Lei Bao was a top-tier master who had trained both his inner and outer body to their limits. Shi Feng had only been able to defeat Lei Bao due to luck.

Fortunately, Shi Feng’s brain activity had improved before participating in this competition. He had even grasped the beginnings of the technique to unlock his brain’s physical limiter. Although he had only overcome the limiter for an instant, it had been enough for him to reach a new level of strength, allowing him to defeat his opponent. In addition, Lei Bao had also been caught unprepared. Otherwise, there was more than a 90% chance that Shi Feng would have suffered defeat in this competition.

To Shi Feng’s current self, it was still somewhat early for him to overcome his brain’s limiter.

The brain limited a person’s strength to protect the body. Before the physical body reached sufficient durability, actively trying to remove this limiter would only do more harm than good. Not to mention, Shi Feng had yet to grasp this power fully.

It might seem that Shi Feng had only received a small scratch during the competition, but in reality, his body had been significantly damaged due to the explosive force he had displayed.

Even without moving, Shi Feng felt like needles pricked his entire body.

Hence, the moment Shi Feng returned to the lounge, he had madly consumed A-rank Nutrient Fluids to alleviate his pain. After this competition, he would not be able to train for quite some time.

“Join your Workshop?” Lei Bao frowned. Every martial artist wished to remain free and unfettered. He barely had enough time to train and improve himself; how would he find the time to work?

“Master Lei Bao, please relax. My Workshop is a Virtual Gaming Workshop that focuses on the most popular game currently, God’s Domain. You only need to work at night while you rest. The Workshop will not interfere with your life during the day; you can do whatever you want during that time,” Shi Feng slowly explained. He knew very well what Lei Bao worried about.

Although Lei Bao had never come into contact with virtual reality games, especially God’s Domain, Lei Bao was still a top-tier martial arts master.

Currently, although Aqua Rose and the others had the potential, their foundations were lacking. They still needed to improve before they could become top-tier experts. However, Lei Bao was different. His combat foundation was extremely sturdy. If he familiarized himself with his body in God’s Domain and integrated the techniques he had learned in real life, he could very quickly become one of Zero Wing’s top combatants.

“Okay, I’m relieved to hear that.” Lei Bao nodded. He then left the lounge.

Lei Bao’s addition to Zero Wing would undoubtedly give the Guild another fierce general.

While Shi Feng rested, three others entered the lounge.

Lifting his head, Shi Feng noticed that one of the new arrivals was none other than Big Dipper’s Chairman, Xiao Yu with Liang Jing and Zhao Ruoxi following closely behind.

At this moment, Zhao Ruoxi wore a blue one-piece that looked both light and elegant. Her inky hair scattered around her waist like a waterfall, adding a few hints of elegance to her originally innocent temperament. Upon entering the room, Zhao Ruoxi beamed at Shi Feng, both worry and joy filling her eyes.

Now that Shi Feng had become famous overnight, the originally silent and unknown boy from school was no more. Now, he had become Jin Hai City’s focal point. Even Old Man Xu wished to have a proper chat with Shi Feng.
