Chapter 2410 – Rescue Team?

The surrounding players immediately noticed the Thunder Eagle’s appearance.

“A Flying Mount!”

“What a powerful Flying Mount! Based on its aura, it’s as strong as a Level 100 Great Lord!”

“Too cool! When will I get to ride a Flying Mount like that?”

The various major powers fell into a heated discussion when they noticed the Thunder Eagle, visibly envious. If not for the fact that Summoning Flutes occupied a bag space and had an abysmally low chance of dropping, they would’ve charged forth to try to steal the Flying Mount.

“So, this is the rumored Thunder Eagle?” Cleansing Flame stared at the massive bird of prey as it descended.

Although the various superpowers, Heaven’s Blade included, were searching for Homed Eagle Eggs in the Molten Ruin, none of them had a clear idea of what a Flying Mount was. They had only ever seen the creature on a video.

Seeing the Thunder Eagle in person, Cleansing Flame thought it was even more majestic than a private plane.

“Hop on. There are too many monsters on the way. We’ll get there faster by air,” Shi Feng invited Cleansing Flame on the Thunder Eagle’s back after jumping on himself.

Although the Molten Canyon was a dangerous area, players could fly if they had the means. Shi Feng had only refrained from using his Flying Mount because of how incredibly conspicuous it was. If he had flown into the Molten Canyon, everyone would’ve immediately realized that Zero Wing’s Guild Leader was in the area.

But he no longer cared about hiding his identity. The Tree of Life’s main branch was of utmost importance, and the only way his small team would reach the Molten Ruin quickly was by flying on the Thunder Eagle. Moreover, since War Blood had sealed off the Molten Canyon, players within the canyon couldn’t use their in-game communication system, which made it easier for Shi Feng to hide his tracks.

With Shi Feng’s invite, Cleansing Flame and the few surviving members of her team climbed aboard the magnificent Thunder Eagle. Once everyone was on its back, the Thunder Eagle flapped its wings and swiftly ascended several hundred meters into the air. It then flew straight toward the Molten Ruin.

This Flying Mount is amazing, leader! If we could get a few for ourselves, our leveling speed would skyrocket!” a Level 101 Assassin beside Cleansing Flame exclaimed as he watched the scenery pass below him.

“Indeed. With this Movement Speed and maneuverability, reaching distant Level 100-plus maps would be a lot easier,”

Cleansing Flame agreed, nodding. As she glanced down at the Level 100-plus monsters roaming the forest below, she, more or less, understood how beneficial a Flying Mount could be. It also explained how Zero Wing had become so powerful.

If they had the help of a Flying Mount, they could explore and grind in a Level 100 neutral map twice per day. They could spend nearly double the time grinding than if they traveled via Land Mounts. It was no wonder how Zero Wing had nurtured so many Tier 3 players so quickly.

On the Thunder Eagle’s back, the trip that should’ve taken them two hours was over in a dozen minutes or so. During that time, Cleansing Flame and her teammates had felt as if they were dreaming.

It had taken them a lot of effort and plenty of sacrifice to fight their way from the Molten Ruin to the Molten Canyon’s exit, yet without enduring a single battle, they returned to the ruin. They had even recovered some of their Stamina during the trip as if their earlier battles had been nothing more than a passing dream...

“Guild Leader Black Flame, our adventurer team has thoroughly explored the Molten Ruin’s outer region, so we know the path to the inner area. We can guide you there. We also have plenty of members stationed on the path to the inner area, so they should be able to help,” Cleansing Flame suggested.

Shi Feng had saved her team, so she owed him a big favor. Since he intended to race Thirteen Thrones to her commander, she would help him in whatever way she could. Moreover, they’d have a greater chance of victory with more players if they stumbled across War Blood’s members.

“I’ll have to trouble you, then,” Shi Feng said.

“I’ll contact them now. They should be assembled by the time we reach the cavern that leads to the inner region,” Cleansing Flame replied. She then instructed one of her team members to log off and notify Heaven’s Blade’s other members within the Molten Ruin’s outer region.

Cleansing Flame then directed Shi Feng and his entourage to the entrance of the Molten Ruin’s inner region.

In the Molten Ruin, even full teams of Level 100-plus experts in Level 100 Mysterious Iron Equipment risked a team- wipe.

The outer area was crawling with Level 100 Great Lord ranked Blue-eyed Spiders. A team would occasionally come across Level 100 Grand Lord ranked Demonic Flame Spiders, as well. These monsters were a major challenge for Tier 2 players. The Blue-eyed Spiders weren’t a big issue, but only death awaited them if they ran into the Demonic Flame Spiders.

Fortunately, Cleansing Flame’s team had long since familiarized themselves with the outer region, and they guided Shi Feng’s team around the Grand Lords. At most, the group dealt with a few Blue-eyed Spiders on the way. Shi Feng’s group hadn’t even needed to lift a finger throughout the journey. Cleansing Flame and her team members used traps to slow the Blue-eyed Spiders down, which allowed the group to escape the monsters’ pursuit.

After just half an hour, Shi Feng and the others arrived in a town-sized cavern. Azure crystals decorated the cavern ceiling, radiating a blinding light the illuminated the cavern.

A steel tunnel that was more than a dozen meters across let out of one corner of the cavern. A frightening aura seeped from the tunnel, and Shi Feng and his companions could even sense it from several hundred yards away.

The aura was extraordinary. A Tier 1 player wouldn’t even be able to approach the tunnel, and Tier 2 players would feel extremely uncomfortable as they got near, with the aura partially restricting their movements.

However, quite a few players had gathered at the mouth of the tunnel. Shi Feng counted more than 10,000 players with a rough glance, all of which were from the various superpowers’ expert teams. These players were high-leveled and well-equipped. Quite a few of them were even peak experts, wearing multiple pieces of Epic Equipment. Shi Feng also spotted several dozen Tier 3 experts.

Among the players, Shi Feng noticed a team wearing capes with Heaven’s Blade’s emblem. The team wasn’t particularly large, with only a little over 100 members, but their equipment standards were very high. Many of the team members were experts in Level 100 Secret-Silver Equipment. The team was also one of the more eye-catching groups standing near the tunnel.

Yu Luo! You guys sure got here quickly! We’ve rushed here as fast as we could, yet you still beat us,” Cleansing Flame said to the Tier 3 female Cleric leading Heaven’s Blade’s team in greeting.

The female Cleric was delicate and pretty. Although she had a small frame and looked harmless, none of Heaven’s Blade’s experts dared to look down on her. Rather, traces of fear and reverence flashed in their eyes when they looked at her.

You’re finally here. If you’d taken any longer, I would’ve challenged the path already,” the female Cleric named Yu Luo said cheerfully when she saw Cleansing Flame.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, let me introduce you. This is Yu Luo, Heaven’s Blade’s Chief Cleric. She is one of the top five Clerics on Dragonheart Island,” Cleansing Flame introduced. “Yu Luo, this is Guild Leader Black Flame. Guild Leader Black Flame is amazing. He even convinced Remnant Snow to spare us with just a few words.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Greetings, Guild Leader Black Flame,” Yu Luo said. After hearing Cleansing Flame’s introduction, she gave Shi Feng a careful, evaluating look. A moment passed, and she got straight to the point, asking, “May I know when your team will arrive? Our commander’s situation isn’t looking good. I’m not sure how much longer they can evade War Blood’s pursuit. I’d like to move out as soon as possible.”

In consideration for the team in the Molten Ruin’s outer region, Zwei had instructed Yu Luo to remain in that area. As a result, Yu Luo hadn’t been able to help her comrades when War Blood’s experts had attacked. If the inner corridor hadn’t been so dangerous, even for the various superpowers’ main forces, she would’ve long since rushed to her commander’s aid.

commander’s aid.

My team’s here already. We can get moving when you’re ready.”
