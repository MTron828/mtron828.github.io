Chapter 533 – Updated Sacred Glory List

Boundary Sea, Abyssal Star City:

A day had passed since the defensive siege took place in Abyssal Star City. By now, most of the city’s infrastructure had been restored, and many shops, hotels, and restaurants had resumed operating normally. Not only did Abyssal Star City not fall into depression, but it had become even more bustling than before.

Originally, Abyssal Star City would only see daily traffic of about ten million players. Moreover, most of it would consist of native players.

Now, though, not only did the city’s player traffic increase multiple times, but most of it also consisted of foreign players. Many foreign powers had even decided to make Abyssal Star City their base of operations.

!!

Meanwhile, all this was due to the shocking event in Withered Sea City yesterday.

“Is that where the Asura Sword Emperor lives?” a Level 160, Tier 5 Sword Saint of the Blood Elf race muttered as she looked at the majestic Guild Residence in the distance. The elven Sword Saint was two meters tall, and she wore the Guild Emblem of Azure Fang, a pseudo-apex power in the Greater God’s Domain.

When this elven Sword Saint walked down the street, many foreign experts would take the initiative to make way for her. Even fifth-floor experts famous in the Void Sea dared not get close to her.

“Why is Azure Fang’s Saintess here?! Has Azure Fang lost its mind?!”

“I heard Azure Fang’s Saintess recently constructed an Advanced Epic Divine Body and can get promoted into a Tier 6 Sword God anytime. Azure Fang has even prepared to appoint her as its Third Vice Guild Leader. Why would such a big shot appear in this place?”

“It is indeed strange. While the Miniature Ancient World might be a goldmine, it shouldn’t hold much appeal to a pseudo-apex power like Azure Fang.”

“You can’t say that. After all, the Miniature Ancient World is a meeting point for multiple Realms. There might not be many visitors now, but once news of the Miniature Ancient World spreads, tons of profits can be gained. With Abyssal Star City’s current location and facilities, its revenue will be considerable even for a pseudo-apex power.

“Not to mention, quite a few powers currently have their eyes on Abyssal Star City. Even if Black Flame is strong, he will probably have trouble dealing with all of them. If Azure Fang steps up now, so long as Black Flame is smart, he will choose to partner with Azure Fang for protection. In exchange, Azure Fang will get some extra income without having to make too big of an investment.”

The various powers’ experts started a hushed discussion among themselves when they saw Azure Fang’s Saintess making her way to Zero Wing’s Residence.

Initially, the various foreign powers operating in the Miniature Ancient World were given a huge fright when they learned of the decimation of the Hades Society, Primal Empire, and Sacred Tribe’s Tier 5 army in Withered Sea City. After all, the three upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ Tier 5 army was composed of tens of thousands of Tier 5 experts as well as the Tier 6 Wraith Saint.

Yet, all of these experts were killed in the middle of Withered Sea City, and nobody knew who was responsible for this slaughter.

It should be known that the Hades Society had invested a ton into Withered Sea City so as to solidify its foothold in the Miniature Ancient World, going as far as to set up a Great Grandmaster Defensive Magic Array for the city immediately after capturing it from the Asura Mercenary Alliance. This put the city’s defensive capabilities on par with the Void Sea’s fortresses.

Meanwhile, even a hundred Tier 6 experts attacking together would need a long time to break through such a powerful defensive magic array under normal circumstances. Yet, someone had managed to bypass the defensive magic array and annihilate tens of thousands of Tier 5 experts, all within an instant.

Never in their dreams would the various powers dare to imagine such a situation happening. However, it was a fact that such an incident had taken place, so how could the various powers not be frightened?

But after the various powers probed around, they discovered something even more frightening—the culprit behind this incident was none other than Black Flame, the founder behind the two organizations targeted by the Hades Society, Primal Empire, and Sacred Tribe.

Despite being only a Tier 5 Sword Saint, Black Flame had transcended tiers to slay the Tier 6 Nightmare Chaser. After that, he even utilized the teleportation arrays of the Large Group Teleportation Crystals used by the three upper-ranking hegemonic powers to escape to annihilate the three powers’ Tier 5 army. Both achievements sounded like they came straight out of a fantasy.

As a result of these achievements, Black Flame had thoroughly become a thorn in the eyes of the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers. The various upper-ranking hegemonic powers had even secretly joined forces with the intention of eliminating Black Flame first before competing for the Miniature Ancient World.

…

Inside a high-class bar in Abyssal Star City…

Many executives of ordinary hegemonic powers were currently gathered here to exchange information and form alliances. They were doing so to resist the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers and survive in the Miniature Ancient World.

“One Step, Melissa, aren’t your Guilds a little too crazy? Why did you decide to join Asura at this critical juncture? Are you not afraid of those upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ retaliation?” a Level 160, Tier 5 Shield Warrior said, expressing his confusion when he saw the two people before him wearing the Asura Mercenary Alliance’s emblem.

“It is indeed risky, but as the saying goes, a friend who helps you when you are in need is better than one that congratulates you when you are successful,” One Step said before taking a sip of wine. Though, despite how calmly he spoke, the hint of worry in his eyes betrayed his calmness.

Divine Hunters and Morning Light’s decision to join the Asura Mercenary Alliance was honestly a huge gamble. After all, once they lost the bet, they would permanently lose access to the Miniature Ancient World.

However, One Step did not regret his decision to push Divine Hunters into this decision as he had personally witnessed Black Flame’s growth. He firmly believed that if Divine Hunters did not join the Asura Mercenary Alliance now, they would come to regret it in the future.

“Risky? Is that so?” Melissa suddenly grinned as if she had just heard a funny joke. “One Step, our Guilds have hit the jackpot this time.”

“What jackpot?” One Step looked at Melissa in confusion.

In response, Melissa glanced at One Step with a rare hint of fervor in her eyes and said, “A friend of mine who’s in the Seven Luminaries Alliance just messaged me that the Sacred Glory List has just been updated. Who do you think got onto the Sacred Glory List this time?”

“It’s probably Guild Leader Black Flame, right?” One Step nonchalantly answered. “With his ability to transcend tiers, it’s only normal for him to get onto the Sacred Glory List. But even if he does get onto the Sacred Glory List, I doubt the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers will give up on targeting him.”

“You’ve guessed correctly. Guild Leader Black Flame did make it into the Sacred Glory List this time,” Melissa said, smiling at One Step’s nonchalance. “But do you know what new title the Seven Luminaries Alliance has given to him?”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
