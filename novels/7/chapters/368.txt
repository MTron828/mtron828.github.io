Chapter 369 - King’s Return

By demanding such a price, Shi Feng made it clear that he was still angry about Feng Xuanyang’s previous actions.

“Misunderstanding” was just another form of deceit.

Everybody knew this. After all, if anything could be chalked up to a “misunderstanding,” why would anyone need the police?

“Vice-Leader Feng, I’m really losing a lot with this transaction. If you aren’t interested, there are many others who will jump at the offer.” Shi Feng chuckled.

In fact, Shi Feng wasn’t lying. Many Guilds and organizations outside of Star-Moon Kingdom had expressed interest in collaborating with Zero Wing. In addition, there were also major corporations who had offered high prices to purchase the Guild. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this moment, Feng Xuanyang’s complexion darkened, and his eyes flashed with a fierce chill. Even South Wolf, who stood by Feng Xuanyang’s side, silently lowered his head, his legs trembling. He was deeply afraid that Feng Xuanyang would erupt with rage and take it out on him.

Whenever Feng Xuanyang was this angry, he would secure a painful ending for any who incurred his wrath. Meanwhile, Shi Feng had toyed with Feng Xuanyang many times now.

No one knew what Feng Xuanyang would do next.

After a long moment...

“Guild Leader Black Flame, I am very sincere here. How about this? In exchange for one billion Credits, I will ask for 5% of Zero Wing’s shares.” Feng Xuanyang suppressed his anger and expressed an extraordinary serenity.

“No negotiations. I will only do 0.1%. This is the very limit that I can offer. If Vice-Leader Feng is not interested, then forget it. I won’t demand your acceptance.” Shi Feng had only probed since he doubted Feng Xuanyang’s intentions. He had not expected that Feng Xuanyang could actually endure his games so well.

Feng Xuanyang had always possessed a dominant approach. He would immediately take action against anyone who disagreed with him. Now, however, he actually controlled his anger to negotiate with Shi Feng. Why wouldn’t Shi Feng be suspicious?

There must be a reason for Feng Xuanyang’s attitude change.

Feng Xuanyang gnashed his teeth to the point of almost cracking them when he heard Shi Feng’s reply.

One billion was not a small number. If he had to give away so much money, even his heart would ache. If it was in exchange for 10% of Zero Wing’s shares, he could barely accept it. However, he could never accept 0.1%.

Black Flame! You dare treat me like a fool! Sooner or later, I will make you pay this debt a hundredfold! Feng Xuanyang inwardly bellowed. As long as he became one of Zero Wing’s shareholders, he could investigate Zero Wing fair and square and insert his own men into Zero Wing’s core. When that time came, he could crush everyone in Zero Wing. Hence, suppressing his anger right now, he said in a low tone, “I understand. I hope that Guild Leader Black Flame will not disappoint me. Let’s sign the contract as soon as possible, then.”

Feng Xuanyang’s agreement surprised and concerned Shi Feng. Originally, he thought he could anger Feng Xuanyang and send the young master flying into a rage. He had expected Feng Xuanyang to break off their relationship completely, spouting a few curses and making some vengeful statement such as “not resting until one of them was annihilated” and the like. However, Shi Feng had never expected this ending. Feng Xuanyang had actually endured such an insult to his reputation....

Feng Xuanyang was actually willing to exchange one billion Credits for 0.1% of Zero Wing’s shares. Unless Feng Xuanyang had truly lost his mind, he was definitely plotting something.

Considering the events up to this point, Shi Feng revealed a faint smile and said, “Vice-Leader Feng, why are you in such a hurry? I still haven’t finished. Aside from the one billion Credits, I also want 50% of Underworld’s shares. If you can promise that, I won’t hesitate to sign.”

“Black... Flame...! You’re courting death!” Feng Xuanyang exploded. He was now fully aware that Shi Feng was not deliberately raising the price out of anger. Instead, Shi Feng was wholeheartedly toying with him right now.

Not only did Shi Feng want to sell 0.1% of Zero Wing’s shares for one billion Credits, but he also wanted 50% of Underworld’s shares.

What was Underworld? It was a force that far surpassed a first-rate Guild. Not to mention 50%, Feng Xuanyang did not even possess 1% of the organization’s shares. Yet, Shi Feng wanted 50%.

“Vice-Leader Feng, you’re not going to keep up the act anymore?” Shi Feng faintly smiled. “I wanted to play around with you for a little longer.”

“Black Flame, don’t think that just because you are invincible in White River City that I can’t do anything to you! You underestimate Underworld too much! Zero Wing is merely the overlord of White River City! Meanwhile, the several cities surrounding White River City have already fallen under our control! It won’t be long before I personally finish you off and eradicate your Guild!” Feng Xuanyang could no longer control his anger. Like a berserk beast, he let out a lung-piercing roar, causing everyone who heard it to shiver with fear. “Black Flame, originally, you could have had a billion Credits as your retirement fund! Now, you no longer have that chance! I will force you into a corner, bit by bit, and make you regret all your actions today!”

At first, Shi Feng was slightly surprised when he heard Feng Xuanyang’s fury. In the next moment, however, he smiled and said, “I will be waiting.”

Afterward, Shi Feng disconnected the call.

Although he had only said four words, his statement contained utter confidence and determination. Even Feng Xuanyang was slightly stunned, having no comeback.

Feng Xuanyang fully understood the meaning behind Shi Feng’s words.

“Zero Wing is not afraid to start a war. If you think you’re strong enough, bring it on!”

However, Feng Xuanyang was confused. Just how had Shi Feng remained so calm even when facing a billion Credits?

It seems that I need to speed up my plans, Shi Feng thought after he disconnected the call.

His surprise during the call had not been due to fear. Instead, it was because he had not expected Underworld’s background to be so powerful. They had acted so quickly and had already conquered the cities surrounding White River City. If it were not for Feng Xuanyang losing his cool for a moment and revealing this information, Shi Feng would not have known how serious the situation was.

However, Shi Feng could now release a sigh of relief. Fortunately, he had not discovered this too late. He could still prepare if he started taking action right now. It wasn’t Underworld’s iron grip on those several cities; rather they were under the absolute control of the Guilds beneath Underworld. Otherwise, Feng Xuanyang would not have tried to spend one billion Credits to bury Zero Wing.

Currently, the average player’s level was still low, so interaction between cities was limited. However, when players reached higher levels, they would have to head to higher-leveled areas. Meanwhile, these high-level areas were close to the common borders between cities. At that time, Underworld could trap Zero Wing. With enemies on all sides, Zero Wing’s members would not be able to level up safely as they would face the risk of an enemy ambush at any time. In the end, Zero Wing would slowly but surely be pushed into a corner.

However, thanks to Feng Xuanyang’s temper tantrum, Shi Feng could act early to prevent such a situation. Otherwise, by the time everyone had leveled up, Zero Wing would be declawed.

Considering the situation, Shi Feng hurried back to White River City.

Upon his return, Shi Feng discovered that the area outside the Teleportation Hall had already been fully repaired. Meanwhile, many players wandered the streets. A majority of these players were independent. Whenever these independent players saw someone wearing Zero Wing’s emblem, they would watch that person enviously, letting the Zero Wing member feel very proud.

As for the members of Dark Star and other Guilds, whenever they saw a member of Zero Wing, they would consciously avoid contact. These Guild players were no longer as arrogant as before.

Moreover, Shi Feng discovered that the independent players walking around on the streets possessed very high levels. These independent players were clearly above the standard of ordinary players. Currently, many of these independent players were trying to form parties to raid high-level Dungeons or grind in high-level areas.

Before Shi Feng had even left the Teleportation Hall, the atmosphere on the street changed. Practically everyone turned to stare at him.

“Isn’t he One-hit Asura, Black Flame?

“Guild Leader Black Flame has returned?”

“Where?! Where?!”

“Wah! It’s real! It’s the real deal! He’s just too handsome! Crap! I’m going to faint at this rate!”

Shi Feng was not currently wearing his Black Cloak, so he was easily and quickly recognized. Suddenly, everyone on the street grew excited. Some female players looked as if they would pounce on Shi Feng as soon as he passed, and many of them squealed in excitement.

However, before these female players even had the chance to pounce on Shi Feng, a group of players wearing dazzling equipment quickly swarmed over from a distance. The poorest-quality weapons and equipment these players had were Secret-Silver rank, and every one of these players was above Level 20. They all wore a six-winged emblem on their chests, and the appearance of this group immediately attracted everyone’s attention.

This group of players was none other than Zero Wing’s core team. In addition to these core members, there were also over a thousand elite members behind them. These players moved in unison, and the extraordinary momentum they displayed caused the players to make way for them unconsciously.

Meanwhile, all of these members of Zero Wing were here to receive Shi Feng.

“Guild Leader, welcome back!”

Aqua Rose, Fire Dance, and everyone else walked over, smiling faintly as they looked at Shi Feng.

This grand welcome left Shi Feng utterly speechless. He could only silently nod in reply.

Afterward, Shi Feng walked back to the Starstreak Trading Firm with the crowd from Zero Wing. Throughout their journey, the players of White River City had all promptly moved aside. These players gazed at Shi Feng with wonder as if welcoming the king’s return.
