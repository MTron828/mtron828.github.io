Chapter 934 – Evil Nature Defeated

“That guy blocked it?! Is he a monster?!”

“Isn’t that Commander Vocalist’s strongest move?! Don’t tell me that guy’s another sixth-floor expert?!”

“Two sixth-floor experts in a single team?! Wasn’t Zero Wing supposed to be beneath pseudo-apex powers?!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Evil Nature’s members were dumbfounded when they saw Kowloon Demon had neutralized Slumbering Vocalist’s attack.

As members of Evil Nature, they were well aware of Slumbering Vocalist’s strength. Although his combat standard was inferior to Unseeing Demon, he was already on par with Unseeing Demon in offensive capability.

Previously, Purgatory Jade, who was barely equipped with Divine Artifacts, could block Unseeing Demon’s all-out attack only because her combat standard had reached the sixth-floor standard. Thus, when everyone saw Kowloon Demon, who similarly had few Divine Artifacts equipped, block Slumbering Vocalist’s all-out attack, they could only assume that his combat standard had also reached the sixth-floor standard.

Besides Evil Nature’s members, the spectating members of the various powers were also shocked by this development.

…

A second one?! How many secrets has Zero Wing kept from me?! Verdant Rainbow was at a loss for words as she stared at Kowloon Demon in the Magic Mirror.

Sixth-floor experts were akin to myths in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain. Before the Crystallian race’s Ink Crystal appeared, everyone thought that reaching the sixth-floor standard was nothing but a pipe dream.

But now, sixth-floor experts had seemingly become stock items in Zero Wing’s team, with two appearing in a row. She wouldn’t have believed this development if she hadn’t witnessed it.

…

While everyone was in a daze, Slumbering Vocalist issued a command.

“All team leaders, cooperate with me and Commander Bladeweaver to kill these two Mortal Gods! Everyone else, proceed according to plan and swiftly eliminate Zero Wing’s other members!” Slumbering Vocalist executed the Peak Gold Holy Art Endless Blades to distract Kowloon Demon. “Team leaders, attack the Mortal Gods from afar! Tanks, protect those attacking! Do not engage the Mortal Gods directly! Coordinate with me and Commander Bladeweaver to wear them out!”

All 2,000 Evil Nature members took action at Slumbering Vocalist’s command. Among them, the 100 team leaders gathered into two teams and coordinated with Slumbering Vocalist and Bladeweaver to tackle Kowloon Demon and Purgatory Jade. They moved without hesitation, with full confidence that they could defeat the two Mortal Gods.

Sixth-floor experts might be able to use Peak Gold Fusion Techniques at little cost, but they would still burn some Stamina and Concentration in the process. They couldn’t use these powerful techniques indefinitely.

Moreover, as Slumbering Vocalist and Bladeweaver were strong enough to confront and distract Kowloon Demon and Purgatory Jade, the two Mortal Gods would not have much leeway to target anyone else. So long as enough experts worked together with Slumbering Vocalist and Bladeweaver, it would only be a matter of time before the two Mortal Gods collapsed from exhaustion.

As Evil Nature’s team leaders encircled Kowloon Demon and Purgatory Jade, about a dozen youths wearing Dragon’s Crown’s Guild Emblem charged forward to intercept them.

“Conceited brats! Do you think you can stop us with just the few of you?!”

When Evil Nature’s team leaders saw the youths charging them, they used their strongest moves without hesitation, wanting to eliminate these obstructions as quickly as possible.

These team leaders, who were fully equipped with Fragmented Divine Artifacts, either attacked with Advanced Gold Arts or worked together to execute Combination Holy Arts to launch a flurry of melee and ranged attacks. Although the power of their attacks was weaker than Slumbering Vocalist’s space-time storms, the coordination of these attacks was enough to kill any expert without an Invulnerability Skill or a Peak Gold Defensive Technique.

However, even as the attacks of the Evil Nature team leaders were about to land, the Dragon’s Crown youths did not falter. Six of them worked together to execute an Advanced Gold Combination Defensive Technique, while the remaining seven either executed bewildering footwork or started to glow brightly.

Boom… Boom… Boom…

Suddenly, a series of loud explosions echoed across Plot 095. Buildings several thousand yards from the source of the explosions collapsed, and numerous spatial tears appeared in their place.

After a round of offensive by both sides, the spectating players gasped when they saw the 13 Dragon’s Crown youths emerge from the dust unscathed. Many even started to doubt life.

“Heavens! Seven Half-step Mortal Gods?!”

“What kind of power is Zero Wing?! Besides two Mortal Gods, it also has seven Half-step Mortal Gods who are so young! Not even Evil Nature has so many Half-step Mortal Gods among its younger generation!”

When the Mortal God standard was still an impossible dream, the Half-step Mortal God standard became the extreme that the various powers’ experts sought. However, achieving this standard was easier said than done. Many of the various powers’ old monsters could only dream of reaching it, let alone experts of the younger generation. Even now, the number of known Half-step Mortal Gods was very limited.

Nonetheless, Zero Wing, a Guild of little renown before today, had seven Half-step Mortal Gods. Furthermore, every one of them was unbelievably young. Not even the Holy Race’s royal powers necessarily had such a foundation.

Where did the Guild Leader find all these monsters? Hidden Soul was astonished when she saw that the Dragon’s Crown youths had neutralized the Evil Nature team leaders’ attacks.

First, it was two sixth-floor experts. Now, it was seven Half-step Mortal Gods. Not even apex powers could come up with such a lineup.

Half-step Mortal Gods? When Slumbering Vocalist saw the 13 youths pinning down Evil Nature’s 100 team leaders handily, he couldn’t help but glance at Shi Feng in disbelief. Who are you people?!

If it were only the two Mortal Gods, he could still attribute it to Zero Wing having unprecedented luck. However, no amount of luck could let a Guild come into possession of so many talented youths. Only a Guild with incredibly formidable foundations could produce this many Half-step Mortal Gods. After all, even the Holy Race’s royal powers had to go to great lengths to produce even one Half-step Mortal God, let alone seven.

Just as doubts were assailing Slumbering Vocalist, a figure came crashing down near him from the sky. When he saw this figure, his pupils instantly shrank.

“Bladeweaver!” Slumbering Vocalist couldn’t believe his eyes as he stared at Bladeweaver’s empty HP bar.

Bladeweaver was the commander of the Holy Scorpion Legion. His combat standard was superior to Slumbering Vocalist’s, and his defensive capabilities surpassed even those of Unseeing Demon. It was why Slumbering Vocalist trusted him to deal with Purgatory Jade.

But now, Bladeweaver died in the span of only a few moves…
