Chapter 584 – Tier 6 Realm?

“They’re gone?”

“A thousand Holy Race experts disappeared, just like that?”

The Fire Demon Party’s members riding atop the Void Manta gaped in shock as they looked at the empty sky behind them.

That was a force of 1,000 Tier 5 Holy Race experts they were talking about. Faced with such a force, their party only dared to rely on a mental combat technique to slip by. As for facing the Holy Race experts in direct confrontation, that would simply be suicidal.

Holy Race players might not be proficient at ranged attacks, but so long as the several dozen Flying Mounts the Holy Race experts rode on could get within 100 yards of their party, it would promptly turn into a nightmarish scenario for their party.

Tier 5 Holy Race players might similarly lack the ability to fly on the Western Continent as Tier 5 human players, but they could strengthen their physical bodies with Holy Aura, which would, in turn, allow them to jump across a distance of a hundred yards easily.

At that time, the Holy Race experts could use their Flying Mounts as a springboard to close the distance with their party and attack them. If any of their party members lacked sufficiently strong defensive capabilities, they would last no more than a few seconds against the Holy Race experts.

Yet, now, the Holy Race experts they feared were knocked out of the sky by one of the Dawnlight Party’s newcomers in a single attack. None of the Holy Race experts managed to withstand the force of the newcomer’s attacks. This was simply unbelievable.

After all, these were Tier 5 Holy Race experts they were talking about!

With their Holy Auras activated, these Holy Race experts would gain Strength and Defense vastly superior to human players. Yet, of the one thousand Holy Race experts that approached the Dawnlight Party, not even one managed to remain on their Flying Mounts. They were all heavily injured and knocked out of the sky.

“That damned Sky Pivot!” Fire Bull was greatly shocked as he watched Shi Feng sheath his sword. “Where did he find such a monster?!”

Fire Bull previously thought he had already lucked out significantly when he recruited Cang Sha. But now, it turned out that one of the newcomers Sky Pivot recruited was even more monstrous.

The feat of heavily injuring a thousand Tier 5 Holy Race experts with one attack was something neither he, nor Sky Pivot could accomplish, even if they went all out. If anyone could pull off such a feat, it would have to be the old monsters in Seven Luminaries Town, who were fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment.

Has he reached the Tier 6 Realm already?

At this time, even Cang Sha couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in surprise.

Very few human experts in Seven Luminaries Town had reached the Tier 6 Realm. Each of these experts was fully equipped with Legendary Weapons and Equipment, and they rivaled Tier 6 Holy Race experts.

Currently, in a situation where none of the players operating on the Western Continent had reached Tier 6 yet, experts who had reached the Tier 6 Realm undoubtedly stood at the apex among the Western Continent’s experts. Even the Holy Race’s various powers wouldn’t dare to provoke such existences casually.

…

On the other side, Sky Pivot and the others also couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in astonishment. In fact, the shock they experienced was even greater than what the Fire Demon Party’s members experienced.

The Tier 6 Realm!

I must be dreaming! Our party actually has an expert of the Tier 6 Realm?!

Sky Pivot, Moon Bamboo, Budding Leaf, and Splashing Fire gaped in shock as they looked at Shi Feng.

Experts of the Tier 6 Realm stood at the absolute apex of the current Western Continent’s players. Unlike the four of them, who could only rival the Tier 6 human players outside the Eternal Realm, experts of the Tier 6 Realm could rival Tier 6 Holy Race players.

In the current situation where none of the Western Continent’s Holy Race experts had reached Tier 6 yet, a human expert of the Tier 6 Realm could go unopposed on the Western Continent. Even the Holy Race’s expert teams would have to avoid these human experts.

It would be akin to a group of Tier 5 human players outside the Eternal Realm coming across a Tier 6 human player. Even if the Tier 5 players had the advantage in numbers, they would be nothing more than a group of ants in front of the Tier 6 player. It wouldn’t be difficult for the Tier 6 player to crush the group of Tier 5 players.

How much strength has he kept hidden? Billowing Water was at a loss for words as she looked at Shi Feng.

Originally, she thought that after obtaining a Bronze Mana Purification Technique, she had reduced the gap in strength between her and Shi Feng. She had even been confident that she could surpass Shi Feng once she fully mastered the Bronze Purification Technique. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Yet, it turned out that her imagination couldn’t be any further from reality.

While she was preparing herself to die at the hands of the Holy Race experts, Shi Feng heavily injured all one thousand Holy Race experts with a single attack. Not only did the strength gap between them not reduce, but it had grown even larger instead…

“The city gates are open, Leader. Let’s quickly enter the city. It’d be the end of us if we get surrounded by the Holy Race’s army,” Shi Feng said when he saw Sky Pivot still in shock.

Contrary to Sky Pivot and the others’ conclusion, Shi Feng was not an expert of the Tier 6 Realm. He also couldn’t go up against the Holy Race’s Tier 5 army alone.

After upgrading his Concentration to the Tier 6 Advanced standard, it was true that he was able to reduce the time it took him to execute Sword of Space. And with the technique’s ability to let him surpass the limits of Tier 5, it was only natural the Tier 5 Holy Race players failed to resist his attack. However, it remained a fact that he needed time to channel his strength to execute the technique.

Previously, the Holy Race experts’ approach had given him ample time to execute Sword of Space. The fact that they came in a single direction also made it convenient for him to target them all. But had the Holy Race experts approached from all directions, he would only be able to strike down a portion of them, and he wouldn’t have the time needed to execute Sword of Space a second time before he came under attack.

And if several hundred Tier 5 Holy Race experts attacked him, Shi Feng doubted he would fare any better than Sky Pivot.

“Right! Let’s hurry on over!” Sky Pivot snapped out of his daze and hurriedly directed the Illusory Gryffin to fly over to the city gates.

Divine scripts and runes covered the towering city hovering above the Plain of Fallen God’s central region, and they protected the city from trespassers. If players wished to enter the city, they could only do so via the gates, which were devoid of any divine scripts and runes.

Currently, the gates were open, and the Holy Race players had yet to establish a proper defensive network, so it was the perfect opportunity for them to enter the city. But if they dragged their feet and allowed the Holy Race’s army to set up a defensive network, they shouldn’t think of entering the city anymore. At that time, not even a force of multiple experts of the Tier 6 Realm should think of barging into the city.

…

Meanwhile, after the Dawnlight Party slipped into the city, the Holy Race experts who were knocked out of the sky started to cause a commotion on the ground.

“Our luck is simply terrible, Commander Heads. We didn’t complete even one of the tasks Lord Thunder assigned us. What are the chances that we would meet an expert who has mastered an extremely powerful mental attack and an expert of the Tier 6 Realm? If the other legions learn of this, they’ll probably laugh their heads off,” a Level 163 team leader of the Holy Race said in exasperation as he watched the Fire Demon Party and Dawnlight Party flying into the nameless city.

Royal Thunder was of extraordinary origins, and countless players wished to get into his good graces. Yet, even though their legion had secured a good opportunity to perform, they ended up wasting it.

“Our luck is terrible?” The middle-aged man, who Royal Thunder previously tasked to eliminate the surrounding human parties, suddenly laughed as he watched Shi Feng disappear into the city. Then, he said, “I don’t think so at all. On the contrary, I think we are incredibly lucky! That man is no expert of the Tier 6 Realm.”

“We’re lucky? And how is that man not an expert of the Tier 6 Realm? His sword heavily injured all of our brothers. Had we not joined our Holy Auras together in time, that attack might have killed us all,” another team leader said in confusion.

“That attack has naturally reached the Tier 6 Realm.” Smiling, the middle-aged man named Hundred Heads said, “But the mana usage method of that attack is very similar to that of Primordial Gods! So, I suspect he has obtained the Primordial God-ranked Mana Technique that those big shots have always wanted!”
