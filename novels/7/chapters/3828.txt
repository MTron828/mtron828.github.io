Chapter 3829 - 903 - New First-Tier City

“You really don’t know.” After seeing Shi Feng’s surprised reaction, Xia Qingying explained, “The Cruise Wing Realm went missing five days ago. Shortly after the incident, news of it quickly spread across the Greater God’s Domain. The players operating in the Cruise Wing Realm were also abruptly logged out of the game and could no longer log back in.”

“Everyone was logged out of the game and can’t log in again?” Shi Feng was even more confused after hearing this.

In his previous life, although some Realms had disappeared abruptly, the players caught in these Realms could still log into God’s Domain. There had never been a case where a Realm’s disappearance caused players to lose access to God’s Domain.

“Yes. Because of this incident, the supply of raw materials in the Greater God’s Domain has become tight, and prices have increased by 50% to 100%. Some materials can’t even be bought with money anymore,” Xia Qingying said helplessly. “The production of Basic and Intermediate Engraving Scrolls requires Mana Sealing Wood. Although it’s a material that’s available in every Realm, the Cruise Wing Realm made up 40% of the Greater God’s Domain’s supply.

“Without the Cruise Wing Realm, I’d have no choice but to source Mana Sealing Wood from other places. In that case, I can only source several hundred players’ worth every so often. Any more than that, I’ll start attracting unwanted attention.”

“That is true.” After hearing Xia Qingying’s explanation, Shi Feng admitted that they had a huge problem.

Mana Sealing Wood was a rare material in the Greater God’s Domain. Although every Realm produced it, most only produced it in small quantities. The good news was that the demand for Mana Sealing Wood was low, and it was typically only used when producing special high-ranking Magic Scrolls. The bad news was that Mana Sealing Wood was one of the main materials needed to produce Divine Engraving Scrolls.

If Zero Wing intended to nurture only a few dozen Divine Engravers, it could easily procure Mana Sealing Wood without attracting attention. However, to source enough Mana Sealing Wood to nurture 10,000 Divine Engravers without relying on the Cruise Wing Realm, it would have to source from dozens of Realms or more. It was impossible to conduct an operation of such scale with absolute secrecy.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s why I have been looking for you,” Xia Qingying sighed. “Originally, the Cruise Wing Realm’s disappearance already presented a huge headache. Now, the various powers have even started frantically investigating the reason for its disappearance, fearing their Realms might be next. They aren’t letting any details slip past them. Although I stockpiled some Mana Sealing Wood before this incident, it can only last us another two days.”

“I can get some Mana Sealing Wood, but I’m afraid it’s impossible to supply tens of thousands of players long-term without attracting attention…” Shi Feng frowned.

There were many ways to obtain large amounts of Mana Sealing Wood. The simplest method would be to buy it from the Seven Luminaries Alliance. If they purchased it through the Alliance, they could easily nurture hundreds of thousands of Divine Engravers, let alone tens of thousands. However, if they were to buy such a large amount of Mana Sealing Wood, the Seven Luminaries Alliance would definitely look into the matter.

If it were revealed that Zero Wing could produce Divine Engraving Scrolls, it would truly be the end for Zero Wing.

It should be known that the significance of the Divine Engraving Scrolls was far greater than even that of the Tower of the Abyss.

Although the Tower of the Abyss could provide fifth-floor experts with opponents and directions to advance beyond the fifth-floor standard, the benefits of owning the Tower of the Abyss were still resistible to powers that could enter it. After all, not everyone could succeed, even when offered a path to success. Very few experts possessed the talent necessary to advance to the sixth-floor standard.

As for the Tower of the Abyss’s wealth-generating capabilities, it was true that it could generate astronomical amounts of Seven Luminaries Crystals. However, while it might be enough to tempt ordinary powers into action, it wasn’t enough to make apex powers forgo the method of reaching the sixth-floor standard. In a situation where Zero Wing allowed everyone besides its enemies to use the Tower of the Abyss, apex powers that weren’t hostile to Zero Wing wouldn’t care to seize the Tower of the Abyss.

Zero Wing didn’t have to concern itself with the envy of ordinary powers, either. Nobody could threaten Zero Wing in the Eternal Realm outside of apex powers.

However, it would be a different story if the various powers learned of Zero Wing’s ability to mass-produce Divine Engraving Scrolls.

Since the major system update, players had been subjected to a constant mental burden when using high-quality weapons and equipment. Because of this, Epic and Fragmented Legendary Weapons Equipment became mainstream in the Greater God’s Domain. In such a situation, having the ability to produce Divine Engraving Scrolls that could enhance the Basic Attributes of Epic and Fragmented Legendary items would be a game changer. There was no way the various powers could resist seizing this opportunity for themselves, especially when it was in the hands of a weak power like Zero Wing.

“Are you free these next two days?” Xia Yingqing asked suddenly.

“I don’t have anything planned,” Shi Feng answered without much thought.

“Good.” Xia Qingying smiled. “A new first-tier mobile city has appeared on the Starlight Continent. The birth of a first-tier city is rare and happens only once every few decades or centuries. To celebrate its achievement, the first-tier city in question has decided to host an auction of unprecedented scale, and the Green God Corporation just so happens to have received an invitation.

“Rumor has it that the auction will feature Fragmented Divine Artifacts and Eternal Stones. However, all transactions must be made with Eternal Coins. Many powers are also considering using this auction to earn Eternal Coins, so they are willing to auction some of their wealth. I dare say this will be the grandest trade fair the Starlight Continent has ever seen in the past century.”

“Even Eternal Stones are being sold?” Shi Feng’s eyes lit up after hearing this.

He had been trying to obtain Eternal Stones all this time. Unfortunately, since the Holy World became the Eternal Realm, obtaining them became even more difficult. Additionally, as everyone knew about the Eternity Set, those with Eternal Stones treated them like family heirlooms. This situation prevented him from turning the Eternity Gauntlets and the Eternity Crown in his possession into Divine Artifacts.

If Eternity Stones were sold at the aforementioned auction, it would be an excellent opportunity for him to obtain some. So long as he could get about a dozen more, he could turn the Eternity Crown into a bona fide Divine Artifact. At that time, the Eternity Crown alone would trump the God Chaser Set he currently used.

“All attendees will have their identities hidden, so we can buy Mana Sealing Wood in bulk without worry. I heard that you made a lot of money in the Eternal Realm, so it will be up to you then,” Xia Qingying said, smiling when she saw Shi Feng’s eagerness. “The Green God Corporation’s passenger plane will arrive at Star Lake City in three hours. Do you have any problems?”

“Three hours is enough.” Shi Feng nodded. “I’ll head over to the airport after I take stock.”

Zero Wing currently had plenty of Eternal Coins because of the Tower of the Abyss. After all, each player had to pay five Eternal Gold and 2,000 units of Seven Luminaries Crystal each time they challenged the Tower of the Abyss, and there were tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand players challenging the tower each day. Even after he repaid the debts he incurred for purchasing the upscale shop in Luminous Sky City and materials from the Seven Luminaries Alliance, Zero Wing should still have plenty of Eternal Coins on its books.

“Okay. Don’t be late,” Xia Qingying said, hanging up the call after getting Shi Feng’s agreement.

…

On the Green God Corporation’s supersonic passenger plane, a tall woman sat beside Xia Qingying. The woman sported a ponytail, and a black veil covered her face. Although the woman’s expression was hidden, she exuded a cold aura that made those around her tremble subconsciously.

After Xia Qingying ended her call with Shi Feng, the veiled woman glanced at the holographic projection of Shi Feng displayed above Xia Qingying’s wrist and asked, “Is he the rumored Black Flame from our world?”

“Mhm. He’s the one I mentioned to you before,” Xia Qingying replied, nodding. Then, with a playful smile, she continued, “Had he entered the Greater God’s Domain with your batch, his current achievements might have matched yours.”
