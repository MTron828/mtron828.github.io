Chapter 895 – Hidden Apex Power

Silence!

Incomparable silence!

Time seemingly stopped in the central plaza. Be it the independent players waiting for death to claim them or the ten pseudo-apex powers’ forces, everyone stared into the air in utter disbelief.

“The Hephaestus’s Flame disappeared?”

“Wait… It’s not just the Hephaestus’s Flame! Even the magic barriers have disappeared!”

“What on earth did he just do?”

When the players in the plaza saw the thoroughly shattered sky, their minds went into overdrive, trying to process what just happened. All they had seen was a dragon of flames lunging at Kowloon Demon and Kowloon Demon retaliating with his sabers. Then, the dragon of flames disappeared, and the sky shattered.

Could he have Divine Artifacts hidden on him? The Level 237 Berserker from the Dragon God Palace goggled at Kowloon Demon, his mind roiling with confusion and horror.

The leaders of the other pseudo-apex powers’ teams were equally puzzled.

Unlike most other players present, they were the chosen ones of pseudo-apex powers. They were fifth-floor experts who had mastered many Gold Combat Techniques and developed Gold Techniques of their own. Even the weakest among them had Concentration at the Tier 6 Peak standard. Thus, they had clearly perceived what had happened.

The instant after Kowloon Demon unsheathed his sabers, he had executed an attack that rivaled Peak Gold Combat Techniques against the Hephaestus’s Flame-turned-dragon at an incredible speed. More specifically, he had executed one Advanced Gold Combat Technique with each of his four arms, superimposing them to create a fusion attack that overwhelmed the Hephaestus’s Flame-turned-dragon.

A single person had executed four Advanced Gold Combat Techniques simultaneously! This was simply unheard-of!

…

Meanwhile, a deathly silence also enveloped the Advanced Tent the pseudo-apex powers’ core executives occupied.

“A Mortal God!” Apocalypse shouted as he stared at Kowloon Demon’s figure in the Magic Mirror, his voice nearly cracking. “He’s…a Mortal God!”

As soon as Apocalypse broke the silence, everyone in the tent revealed varying expressions.

Some reacted with excitement.

Some reacted with fear.

Some reacted with disbelief.

How can this be?! How can he be a Mortal God?! Ember Dragon’s expression was beyond ugly as he glared at his Magic Mirror. How can there still be another person who has reached that realm besides Red Frost?! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Have we been mistaken this entire time? Confusion also engulfed the bandaged youth standing beside Ember Dragon.

Until recently, the sixth-floor standard, also known as the Mortal God standard, had been nothing more than an unattainable dream for the Greater God’s Domain’s experts. Red Frost’s advancement to this legendary standard was a marvel in itself. Never in his wildest dreams did he anticipate seeing another sixth-floor expert so soon. This revelation completely invalidated the results of their previous investigations.

“It’s over! How can this person be an expert of that standard? What are we supposed to do now?”

“What are we supposed to do? Nothing. We’re doomed. Although this person has no Divine Artifacts, he’s a Level 240 sixth-floor expert. Not even the Divine Glory List’s current top three can necessarily beat him. If he is adamant about taking revenge, all we can do is bear the consequences…”

After realizing the severity of the situation, some of the pseudo-apex powers’ representatives began a panicked discussion.

Previously, when the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s various pseudo-apex powers learned that Red Frost had become a Mortal God, they had taken the news in stride. They only worried about the future Holy Dragon Spear. After all, Red Frost had yet to reach Level 240, and there was a massive difference between players who had reached it and those who hadn’t.

However, it was a completely different ball game with Kowloon Demon. The thought of him going on a rampage was too terrifying to contemplate.

Unless they hid in their Holy Cities and relied on the cities’ NPCs and magic arrays, Kowloon Demon could kill them whenever he wanted. If they left the safety of their Holy Cities, even if they operated alone or with a team, they would never be safe.

“Hahaha! I never thought there would be a time these bastards would panic.” South Lake was delighted when he saw the frightened representatives of the other pseudo-apex powers. Then, through the party chat, he said, “Thank goodness nobody on our side made a move. Now that these bastards have made themselves such a formidable foe, the old monsters behind them will have to be extra careful when going out in the future.”

“That might be the case, but it’s best if we also develop with caution moving forward,” Apocalypse said worriedly as he looked at Kowloon Demon through the Magic Mirror. “Until recently, there has never been any news of Mortal Gods existing in the Greater God’s Domain. Yet, shortly after Red Frost achieved the sixth-floor standard, another Mortal God suddenly appeared. There’s no saying whether other powers have such experts hidden. We should be especially wary of this possibility now that we have extended our reach to the Eternal Realm. The various powers will certainly reveal many of their trump cards to secure the Eternal Realm’s resources.”

“Indeed. I have never heard of any power named Dragon’s Crown. I even checked again just now, but no pseudo-apex power, conglomerate, or even upper-ranking hegemonic power goes by this name,” South Lake said, solemnly looking at Kowloon Demon. “Logically, a power capable of nurturing such an expert cannot be unknown. Yet, we’ve never heard of it. It seems the Greater God’s Domain’s waters are deeper than we imagined.”

While South Lake and Apocalypse were having a private conversation, an angry shout suddenly sounded in the tent.

“All of you, shut up!” Ember Dragon bellowed, his expression growing colder. “Why are you all panicking? It’s only a Mortal God. Even if he is strong, he is only one person. We are an alliance of ten pseudo-apex powers. The Flame Dragon God’s Treasury has placed a powerful suppression on all players. Even using combat techniques here is a great burden! He doesn’t have any Divine Artifacts, either. If he wants to execute that powerful slash, he will have to use that combat technique at all times. We can easily rely on Divine Artifacts and Hephaestus’s Flame to whittle him. Not to mention, we all have our trump cards. If we each use one, do you think he can survive?”

The various representatives calmed down at Ember Dragon’s words.

Kowloon Demon was indeed powerful, but he was only one person. He didn’t have any Divine Artifacts, either. In contrast, they had over ten Level 240 experts equipped with Divine Artifacts. In terms of Basic Attributes, they were superior to Kowloon Demon.

If Kowloon Demon were to fight using the same combat technique he used just now, he would quickly run out of steam, even if he was a sixth-floor expert. On the other hand, the Profound Skills of Divine Artifacts did not burden their users whatsoever; their Level 240 players could freely use various Divine Artifact Profound Skills against him. As long as they threw enough bodies at him, they could kill him.

“Since we have reached a consensus, let us take action together and teach this dastardly power a lesson! We must let everyone know that a mere Mortal God is still not enough to meddle with the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s affairs!” Ember Dragon said. As he spoke, he glanced at South Lake and Apocalypse, as if his words were addressed to Holy Dragon Spear.

Although South Lake knew Ember Dragon’s words were a veiled threat to Holy Dragon Spear, he dared not express any opinions.

Originally, the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s pseudo-apex powers maintained a delicate harmony, as there wasn’t much difference in their strength. They had even formed mini-alliances to keep each other in check. However, that all changed following Red Frost’s ascent to the sixth-floor standard. Even Red-Tailed Dragon, an ally of Holy Dragon Spear, had started to change its stance. If Holy Dragon Spear stepped too far out of line, it would likely face a similar fate as Kowloon Demon—ganged up on by the group.

However, Holy Dragon Spear was not a lone individual like Kowloon Demon. It was a large organization that many people depended on. It did not have the option of running away.

As Ember Dragon was about to leave the tent, the Magic Mirrors suddenly showed cloaked figures appearing in front of Kowloon Demon one after another. In just three seconds, 98 cloaked figures stood before Kowloon Demon.

Although these individuals’ cloaks concealed their information, such simple concealment methods were useless against the Peak Identification Skills of the various pseudo-apex powers’ representatives.

“This… How is this possible…”

“This must be an error! How can they all be Level 240 experts?! This is impossible!”

“Nearly a hundred Level 240 experts and a Mortal God? Could Dragon’s Crown be a hidden apex power?”

…
