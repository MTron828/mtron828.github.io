Chapter 111 – Ancient City Takes Shape

Jin Hai City, Qingzhu Villa District:

After spending the day at the Secret Pavilion’s branch headquarters, Shi Feng hurriedly returned to his villa to rest.

In reality, those touring the branch headquarters could choose to spend the night there. However, when Shi Feng considered the bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid he got from Qi Lianshan and the 11,100 Association Points he earned from the instructor certification test, he didn’t wish to waste even a moment longer there. Thus, he left the branch headquarters ahead of time.

One bottle of Life Potion and six bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid. These supplements should be enough to heal my body’s injuries and replenish my cells’ vitality, Shi Feng thought expectantly as he looked at the seven bottles he had just placed into the refrigerator.

The God’s Domain Association’s points could be exchanged for resources at the Association branches located in the various cities. To avoid attracting trouble to himself, Shi Feng had chosen to conceal his identity and exchanged his points at Liufeng City’s Association branch before returning to Jin Hai City. Meanwhile, he had spent all but 100 points to exchange for one bottle of Life Potion and five bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid.

Fortunately, as Liufeng City was a first-tier city, the Association branch there had all the resources the Association offered. Moreover, the exchange system was operated by AI. So long as he had enough points to exchange for the items he selected, the AI would send fully automated robots to deliver the items to him. No human was involved in the entire process, so there was no need to worry that his identity would get exposed.

Meanwhile, with six bottles of S-rank Nutrient Fluid and one bottle of Life Potion, he should be able to elevate his physical fitness to the standard of master martial artists. Most importantly, the Life Potion would rejuvenate his cells, returning him to his prime of youth. At that time, he would no longer have to worry about facing bottlenecks when developing his body.

While Shi Feng was conducting meditation training to put his mind and body into the perfect condition to consume and absorb the drugs, Blackie suddenly contacted him with an anxious expression on his face.

“Guild Leader, I just received news that the balance between the various powers has been broken because of the God’s Domain Association. Now, the various powers have started competing for leveling spots in both the main continent and the Miniature Ancient World. Battles involving tens of thousands of players have even taken place in a few places already,” Blackie said in a helpless tone. “Right now, the various first-rate Guilds and Guild alliances have already locked down all leveling maps under Level 110 in the Miniature Ancient World. They’re not letting any outsiders set foot into these maps. Qianliu’s side has even clashed with some teams already. Although they’ve won every fight so far, we’ve also suffered a lot of casualties…”

Currently, although Zero Wing’s internal members were ahead of the various Guilds in terms of levels, their optimum leveling spots were still Level 105 to Level 110 leveling maps due to the inconvenience of travel.

Originally, few Guilds would send their teams out to these maps, so Zero Wing’s internal members got to enjoy ample leveling resources. However, now that the various Guilds were laying claim over these maps, it became a lot more challenging for Zero Wing to monopolize these resources.

Although Zero Wing’s members could fend off those who tried to hinder them, most of the opponents they faced were experts from the various first-rate Guilds. Fighting against these experts while grinding would lower their grinding efficiency significantly.

Moreover, as a small Guild, the last thing Zero Wing wanted was to have a protracted fight with a large Guild. After all, a large Guild could afford to have a portion of their members keep Zero Wing busy while the rest of their members focused on leveling up rapidly.

“That is indeed a problem.” Shi Feng fell into thought for a moment when he heard Blackie’s report. Then, he said, “Have them switch to grinding in Level 110-plus maps for now. Although their leveling efficiency will still decrease, it will still be better than if they stayed and fought. Also, you don’t need to worry about recruiting new members. Just focus on leveling up for now.”

“Okay. I’ll notify Qianliu and the others,” Blackie said. After giving the matter some thought, he felt that this was the only solution they had right now.

After Blackie disconnected the call, Shi Feng also stopped meditating, took out a bottle of S-rank Nutrient Fluid from the refrigerator, and emptied it into his stomach.

It seems I’ll have to accelerate the Abyssal Star City’s construction.

Although Shi Feng had more or less expected the various powers to make a big move after the instructor certification test, he didn’t think they would act so quickly. He also didn’t expect the competition to reach the Miniature Ancient World as well.

After drinking the S-rank Nutrient Fluid and feeling a warm feeling spreading throughout his body, Shi Feng lied into his virtual gaming cabin and logged into God’s Domain.

…

Misty Canyon, Abyssal Star Ancient City:

When Shi Feng logged back into the game, he found that the Abyssal Star City had undergone massive changes.

“This…”

Shi Feng was stunned when he saw the pedestrians walking along the city’s main street.

The once deserted ancient city had become populated by numerous NPCs in less than a day. Moreover, many of these NPCs were merchants and adventurers.

NPC merchants and NPC adventurers might be a common sight in towns and cities, but it was incredibly strange to see so many of these NPCs in a city that had been summoned only recently.

It should be known that NPC merchants and NPC adventurers were crucial for a city’s early-stage development. After all, a city could only rent its Shops out if there were NPC merchants seeking to rent them, and a city’s Shops would also only have products to sell if NPC merchants were renting them. Meanwhile, a city could only defend itself if there were NPC adventurers applying to become guards. If a city lacked sufficient NPC guards, it couldn’t even maintain basic public security. NPC guards were especially important for the Abyssal Star City since it sat in the monster-infested Misty Canyon.

Meanwhile, after seeing how rapidly the Abyssal Star Ancient City had developed, Shi Feng couldn’t help but admit that Hidden Soul was indeed a capable person.
