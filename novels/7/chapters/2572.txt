Chapter 2573 – Popular Stone Forest City

When the group that had just burst into the Freedom Hotel excitedly announced Zero Wing’s victory of the Dark World’s invading army, the players in the lobby, who had been skeptical about Yuan Tiexin’s stunned announcement, were flabbergasted.

“What?! It’s actually true!?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“How could Zero Wing have possibly won?! We’re talking about an entire world of experts!”

The fact that the Secret Pavilion held some of Stone Forest City’s shares was no longer a secret. Thus, there had been a chance that Yuan Tiexin had been lying to boost Zero Wing’s reputation.

The players that had just arrived, however, were a different story. Every member of the group was an independent player, and a few of them were well-known among the adventurer teams unrelated to Zero Wing in the city. Because of this, they were considered quite credible.

Most importantly, they had just explained the sudden change in the various superpowers’ attitudes regarding Zero Wing.

Even with many players still doubting the news, assuming it was either a lie or outrageously exaggerated, there was no doubt that the Guild in question had done something to change the superpowers’ minds. That fact alone was enough to shock everyone in the lobby only moments before they were overcome with joy.

Without the various superpowers’ interference and with Stone Forest City’s defenses and terrain advantage, even the Dark World’s players would need a long time before they could capture the city. Meanwhile, resident players like themselves could safely and far faster than those based outside of Stone Forest City.

“Thankfully, we weren’t too rash, but I really doubt that Zero Wing’s foundations are this formidable. Demon’s Heart’s Flaming Light must be going mad with regret right about now,” the fierce man from Crimson Emperor said with a bitter smile.

The main reason that the various superpowers were so afraid of Demon’s Heart was the key in Flaming Light’s possession, which allowed him to open the Dark World’s Teleportation gate in any location he desired. If not for this trump card, Demon’s Heart wouldn’t have developed so smoothly in the Ten Saints Empire.

Flaming Light had intended to use this trump card to salvage Demon’s Heart’s reputation and deter the Ten Saints Empire’s various superpowers, but now, both his threat and plans had gone to the dogs.

In fact, Flaming Light’s trump card had unexpectedly benefitted Zero Wing, increasing both the Guild’s fame and fortune!

It was only a matter of time before word of the Dark World’s defeat spread across the main continent, and as it did, everyone would learn about Zero Wing. Not even the various superpowers were capable of accomplishing such a feat, yet Zero Wing had succeeded. Although the Guild had relied on a large number of Tier 3 NPCs to do so, those NPCs were considered a part of Zero Wing’s strength.

In addition, with the Dark World’s Teleportation Gate under Zero Wing’s control, even ordinary players knew this victory would usher in an era of power for the Guild. No one would be surprised if it instantly became a superpower in its own right.

And the one who granted Zero Wing this opportunity was none other than Demon’s Heart’s Flaming Light...

“That’s right. Without the Dark World’s assistance, Demon’s Heart will have a very hard time expanding in the Ten Saints Empire,” Illusory Words agreed, nodding.

Demon’s Heart had gone out for wool and come home shorn.

The Dark World’s Teleportation Gate should’ve triggered unprecedented change on the main continent. However, Zero Wing now controlled the gate, and the Guild had made it clear that it intended to collect a fee from every player that wanted to use the Teleportation Gate. This would significantly decrease the number of visiting Dark World players and, in turn, reduce the number of Demon’s Heart’s potential allies.

Unless the Dark Guild wanted to face the Ten Saints Empire’s various superpowers, it would have to keep a low profile for a considerable amount of time.

“You’ve done a great job this time, Illusory. Since the Grand Elders had nearly made such a catastrophic mistake, the Guild Leader has reclaimed a lot of authority in the Guild. The Guild Leader sent a message ago requesting that you represent Crimson Emperor in the negotiations with Zero Wing. It would also be best if you could rent a few of the Freedom Hotel’s rooms long-term. Don’t worry about the required money and materials,” the fierce man congratulated his comrade.

“The Guild Leader’s requests are certainly troublesome. Now that Zero Wing has defeated the Dark World, a ton of powers will try to rent a large number of the hotel rooms...” Illusory Words grumbled, offering a half-hearted smile.

With Cold Spring Forest now free of the Dark World’s threat, Stone Forest City was, once again, a sacred leveling ground. It would soon become a holy city for the eastern continent’s various powers and independent players, and when it did, even entering the city would become a challenge, let alone renting one of the Freedom Hotel’s rooms...

Shortly after the various superpowers’ meeting in the first-floor lobby had concluded, news of the Dark World’s defeat spread throughout the continent. As they learned of the event, many powers began to regret their decision to abandon Stone Forest City the moment things had turned south.

“Crap! How is this even possible!?”

“Zero Wing is so awesome. Even an entire Otherworld of players is helpless against that Guild. Who could possibly stand against it?”

“Stone Forest City? It seems like a good place to develop.”

When the various kingdoms and empires’ powers and independent experts learned about Zero Wing’s victory, many of them considered moving their bases of operations to Stone Forest City.

Aside from the fact that Stone Forest City occupied a Level 100 neutral map, the fact that the Dark World’s invading army hadn’t been able to shake Zero Wing’s foundations made the city incredibly valuable. None of the city’s residents would have to worry about suddenly losing their bases or another power taking over, which would render all of their investments useless. This concern was precisely the reason that many players developed in NPC cities, rather than in Guild Cities.

Now that Zero Wing had affirmed its strength, Stone Forest City’s stability wasn’t a concern. At the very least, it would be a long while before any power could bring harm to the city. This time period would be more than enough for players to earn back what they had invested in the city.

For a time, players from various kingdoms and empires swarmed toward Stone Forest City. The abrupt population boom was easily ten times larger than the initial wave of players that visited the city once it had reached Intermediate rank. Moreover, an astounding number of players had begun to apply to the Guild. Zero Wing had already received more than two million applicants among its various branches, with many of these experts capable of reaching the Trial Tower’s fifth floor and beyond.

Gentle Snow, Aqua Rose, and Zero Wing’s other management personnel were stupefied.

No matter how well they had managed Zero Wing in the past, few new experts had applied to join, yet after a single battle, everything had changed.

“Guild Leader, Stone Forest City’s player population has exceeded 8 million, and I believe even more players are on their way. Should we slightly raise the city’s entrance fee?” Aqua Rose asked, still blissful after reading the latest statistics report.

Their war with the Dark World had ended less than half a day ago, yet Stone Forest City’s player population had risen from less than 2 million to over 8 million. The number of players visiting the city had completely exceeded her expectations.

No, let’s forget about increasing the entrance fee. We still need a large number of independent players to settle down in Stone Forest City. However, we can increase the Freedom Hotel’s prices. Don’t normal rooms cost 30 Silver per day? Raise it to 1 Gold. Bronze Members will get a 10% discount, Silver Members will get 20%, and Gold Members will get 30%,” Shi Feng decided, chuckling.

Nothing in this world came for free. Since the various powers wanted their experts to develop as quickly as possible, he wouldn’t be courteous. He was incredibly poor right now, after all. To arm his Knight Division, he had spent almost all of the money he had.

“I understand.” The pricing astonished Aqua Rose a little. Not even ordinary experts could afford a daily expense of 1 Gold. “Ah, right. Guild Leader, Dark Rhapsody and Deity Society have contacted me and wish to discuss the offer you made them. They’re asking when you’ll be free to speak on the matter.”
