Chapter 2413 – Pray for Themselves

“This...”

“Isn’t that Guardian Knight a little too strong? Who is that guy?”

“Where did Heaven’s Blade find such a capable MT? With him in the lead, getting to the inner corridor will be at least 20% easier.”

As the various superpowers’ experts watched Shi Feng’s party disappear into the passage, envy welled up within them. Some even took the initiative to chat up Yu Luo’s team in hopes of working with Cola.

In God’s Domain, MTs were the core of a team. With a powerful enough MT, a team would have a much higher chance of successfully raiding Dungeons and exploring ruins. As long as a team could tank a monster, it could kill it.

The various teams had already found quite a few Horned Eagle Eggs in the Molten Ruin’s outer region already.

Needless to say, the min’s inner region would hold even greater treasure. If their teams had an amazing MT like Cola, the team’s overall strength would reach a new level, and they’d definitely be able to reach the inner corridor, gaining a massive advantage.

Meanwhile, Yu Luo and her team stared at the tunnel in stunned silence. Yu Luo’s expression was particularly gloomy. She had never thought Shi Feng’s party would be so strong. After Cola’s display, she had to reevaluate what she thought she had known about Tier 3 MTs.

“They’ve already gone into the tunnel, leader. What should we do?” a Level 102 Shield Warrior quietly asked.

They had run all the way here for the sole purpose of entering the inner corridor and rescuing their commander, and they had just missed their best opportunity to do so.

Even if they worked with another superpower to get through the tunnel, they wouldn’t have more than a 50% chance of success. Even if they made it to the other side, they’d suffer severe losses.

The Shield Warrior’s question made Yu Luo regret her earlier decision a little. She now knew she had been too impulsive. Had she followed Shi Feng’s party, her team would’ve already cleared the first checkpoint and had a much higher chance of reaching their commander. However, all they could do now was stand on this end of the tunnel and watch.

But who would’ve expected Cola to be so powerful?

“So what if they’ve entered the passage? I refuse to believe that we can’t reach the inner corridor without them!” Yu Luo snarled after snapping out of her daze.

Reaching the inner corridor was difficult, but it wasn’t impossible. Moreover, her team also had the information her commander’s team had collected. Avoiding the traps and monsters in the tunnel would be far easier for them, and they had much higher chances of success than any other superpowers’ team.

Yu Luo’s statement ignited the rest of her team’s fighting spirit. They, too, wanted to prove to Shi Feng’s party that they were capable of reaching the inner corridor without Zero Wing’s help.

After Yu Luo had negotiated with two superpowers and prepared to enter the tunnel, another team entered the cavern. Although this team only consisted of 50 members, it drew the attention of the various superpowers’ experts, who stared with serious expressions.

The new arrival’s collective aura was just too powerful.

Of the 50 players on the team, 16 had reached Tier 3. The Tier 2 players had all reached Level 102 and wore Level 100 Secret-Silver and pre-Level 100 Epic Equipment. The team members’ equipment standards were off the charts.

“Demon Palace! They’re going in, too?” Yu Luo’s expression became grim when she saw the team.

By now, every player on Dragonheart Island knew about Demon Palace. Aside from Super Guilds, Demon Palace feared no one.

War Blood’s current strength was the reason the various superpowers were so afraid of the Guild.

War Blood only used to be Dragonheart Island’s third-ranked adventurer team, but after allying with Demon Palace, it had become the island’s uncontested top adventurer team. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

War Blood’s rise had been due to the Demonic Hell World’s special Legacy. At Tier 2, the special Legacy provided incredible power, but after reaching Tier 3, experts with the Legacy gained even more strength, becoming far more powerful than ordinary Tier 3 classes. After witnessing this, none of the superpowers wanted to provoke Demon Palace.

Since War Blood had learned about the Tree of Life’s main branch in Heaven’s Blade’s possession, it was likely that Demon Palace knew of it.

While Yu Luo was lost in thought, Demon Palace’s team approached her. A robust, middle-aged man, who was 2.3 meters tall, stepped forward, smirking at Yu Luo.

“You’re Heaven’s Blade’s Yu Luo, right? I’ve heard that you’re one of the top five healers on Dragonheart Island. That’s certainly an impressive feat. Might I ask you to relay a message to your commander?” Evil Qilin, the middle-aged man, said, chuckling.

“What do you want me to tell her?” Yu Luo asked. She had a bad feeling about this.

“Let her know that it’s not too late to surrender. But if she continues to refuse until we reach her, it will be too late,”

Evil Qilin said before turning and leading his team toward the tunnel. He didn’t even bother to wait for a reply.

As Evil Qilin’s team walked away, Heaven’s Blade’s members fell silent. His tone had been amicable, but they had all sensed the killing intent in his words.

“Leader, what should we do now that Demon Palace’s members have gone in? Zero Wing’s members and Team Leader Flame aren’t far ahead of them,” the Level 102 Shield Warrior asked from beside Yu Luo.

Evidently, the Demon Palace wanted to join the fray, and Evil Qilin’s team wouldn’t spare a single Heaven’s Blade member they encountered in the inner corridor. The man’s request had merely been a warning of their imminent deaths.

The Demon Palace had sent 16 Tier 3 experts into the ruin’s inner region, and 34 of the 50 team members were Refinement Realm or greater experts. Moreover, every member of the team possessed the Demonic Hell World’s special Legacy. If Demon Palace’s team ran into Shi Feng and Cleansing Flame’s party, they’d be slaughtered.

“We can’t contact Cleansing Flame to warn her. Zero Wing’s members can only pray for their Guild Leader,” Yu Luo said helplessly. “Log out immediately and notify the commander of the situation. As for the rest of you, get ready. We’re entering the passage!”

With Yu Luo’s command, Heaven’s Blade’s members joined up with the two superpower teams they had partnered with and entered the tunnel.

Meanwhile, Demon Palace’s team effortlessly pushed through the monsters that had given the various superpowers’ experts headaches, arriving at the final gate leading to the inner corridor in less than 20 minutes.

A magic array sealed the final gate, and players would only obtain the key to remove it by defeating the Guardian Boss.

“It looks like someone’s just killed the Boss, commander!” a Tier 3 Ranger reported as he gestured to the steel gate enveloped in fog.

The Grand Lord ranked Guardian Boss lay before the gate, and a single player was busy looting the Boss while four others rested nearby.

That saves us a lot of trouble. You two, get rid of them and get me that key,” Evil Qilin ordered as he glanced at the two Tier 3 Assassins behind him.

“Understood!”

The Assassins licked their lips in anticipation and entered Stealth.
