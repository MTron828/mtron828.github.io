Chapter 283 - Arrogance

Feng Xuanyang’s words dripped with temptation.

Just the prestige of being the number one Guild in the entire eastern region of Star-Moon Kingdom would cause many to fight over it.

These exact same words might have been used to attract Lone Tyrant into cooperating with Underworld back then.

Under the banner of the number one player on the Ranking List, in addition to Underworld’s covert support, Dark Star had managed to rocket to fame, becoming a Guild capable of rivalling even the powerful Ouroboros.

So that’s how it is. Shi Feng suddenly came to a realization.

He finally understood why Dark Star could become so amazing, just like that, with experts appearing in the Guild out of nowhere. Its abrupt rise was all because of Underworld helping it in secret.

However, now that Zero Wing had established a Guild Residence, Underworld couldn’t help but reconsider its original plans, hence its interest in investing in Zero Wing.

Shi Feng couldn’t help but acknowledge that Underworld was indeed amazing.

They were willing to support an entirely different Guild even at the cost of sacrificing all their previous investments. From an outsider’s perspective, such an action was plain foolish. However, Shi Feng knew that Underworld’s decision was, in fact, very wise. It was obvious at first glance how great an influence a Guild Residence would have towards a Guild’s success. If it were up to him, he, too, would choose to take such an action.

“Master Black Flame, you should know that there are over 20 cities just in Star-Moon Kingdom’s eastern region alone. If Master Black Flame agrees to our proposition, in the future, you will become the absolute overlord of these 20-plus cities. Moreover, even though Underworld will be investing in Zero Wing, we will not interfere directly in the management of the Guild itself. Rather, we will provide you with a large sum in funding and manpower,” Feng Xuanyang slowly said in a tempting tone. “We at Underworld have already decided that, as long as Master Black Flame agrees, we will immediately inject one billion Credits into Zero Wing, and also provide the Guild with 100 Gold Coins every week. In addition, we will also provide 100 experts, and also one team of Underworld Guards for you, Master Black Flame, to command as you see fit. If Zero Wing develops well, Underworld will invest even more into the Guild in the future.

“Master Black Flame, what do you think?”

Feng Xuanyang had taken Shi Feng’s previous silence for hesitation, thinking that Shi Feng was definitely considering his proposition; hence he sweetened the deal. In God’s Domain, wasn’t the main purpose one established a Guild earning money and gaining status?

For a newly established Guild, one billion Credits was definitely an astronomical sum. Even a major corporation in a city couldn’t easily take out one billion Credits. Recently, due to God’s Domain’s raging popularity, the number of corporations investing in the game had been continuously increasing. The value of Guilds in God’s Domain had similarly shot up abruptly. Yet, even so, a third-rate Guild with a member count of 20 to 30 thousand would, at most, be worth two to three hundred million Credits.

Meanwhile, Zero Wing merely had several thousand members in its ranks. Although it had both fame and experts, its value was still not worth one billion Credits. After taking into account the value of a Guild Residence, Zero Wing would at most be worth 500 million Credits. Hence, it would be completely illogical for Shi Feng to refuse the offer of one billion Credits.

“I wonder how much shares Young Master Feng is intending to purchase?” Shi Feng asked, an indifferent smile on his face.

“Not much, just 50%. In exchange for 50% of Zero Wing’s shares, you can obtain one billion Credits, in addition to having many experts to assist you. I believe that no other corporation will be willing to offer such a high price,” Feng Xuanyang said confidently.

Shi Feng propped up his chin with his hand, entering into a deep contemplation. Shortly after, he slowly said, “Although your offer is indeed attractive, 50% of the Guild’s shares is simply too much. I am willing to sell 10% at most.”

Although Feng Xuanyang’s offer of 50% seemed as if both sides would be wielding half of the Guild’s shares, it was simply a trick to make Shi Feng drop his guard. In reality, wielding 50% of Zero Wing’s shares was already tantamount to full control of the Guild. After all, when Shi Feng established his Guild, he hadn’t claimed the full 100% shares of the Guild; he had given a small portion to Aqua Rose.

If Feng Xuanyang purchased 1% of Zero Wing’s shares from Aqua Rose, then he would have 51% of the Guild’s shares. At that time, Feng Xuanyang’s words would become law in Zero Wing, while Shi Feng would sooner or later end up in a situation like the one in his previous life. Shi Feng had sworn to never let something like that happen again in this life.

“Ten percent?” Feng Xuanyang did not dare believe his own ears.

He was going to spend one billion Credits on Zero Wing, yet, all he would get in return was 10% of its shares? Did Shi Feng really take Zero Wing for the number one Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom?

“Vice-Leader Feng, you must think that the amount I’m offering is too low, right?” Shi Feng asked, his indifferent smile still on his face. “It’s only normal that you would think so. However, what I’m trying to say is that one billion Credits really isn’t a big sum of money. I’m already giving Young Master Feng a lot of face by offering you 10% of Zero Wing’s shares. If it were anyone else here today, I would only offer them 1% at most.”

In fact, Shi Feng was not speaking conceited nonsense at all.

Just the Gold Coins he had on hand right now already exceeded 10,000. If he converted them into Credits, they would be worth at least 200 million Credits. His daily income was also continuously rising day after day. Just the benefits he could obtain from the Starstreak Trading Firm had already far exceeded one billion Credits. Not to mention, Zero Wing’s Guild Residence was also built on a strategic location like the Purple Sun Mansion.

The Purple Sun Mansion was the best location for players to establish a Guild Residence in White River City. It also occupied a broad tract of land, larger than even a football field, which could contain 50,000 people. Not to mention the current state of White River City, where every square inch of land was worth its inch in gold; even after a decade passed since God’s Domain’s official launch, the land of the Purple Sun Mansion would still be worth more than ten billion Credits.

Although one billion Credits was indeed an astronomical sum, it was truly not worth 10% of Zero Wing’s shares. Even 1% was an overestimation, not to mention 10%...

“Master Black Flame, there has to be a limit even to jokes. By toying around with me like this, do you take me for someone easily bullied?” Feng Xuanyang’s expression suddenly changed; his tone turned cold as well.

“Vice-Leader Feng, what I speak is the truth. If Vice-Leader Feng feels wronged, then let’s just forget about this matter entirely.” Shi Feng shook his head and laughed. After this meeting, he, too, started thinking of looking for an investment partner.

The falling flowers are yearning for love, but the heartless brook ripples on[1].

If Shi Feng had rejected Feng Xuanyang’s investment proposal from the very beginning, or had argued that Feng Xuanyang was asking for too high a percentage of Zero Wing’s shares, Feng Xuanyang might still have accepted Shi Feng’s answer with a smile.

This was the atrocity of the truth; hence people would often prefer to hear a lie than the truth.

The reason being, the truth was much crueler than a lie. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If Aqua Rose were here right now, she would definitely scold Shi Feng for speaking the truth.

Soon after, Shi Feng departed from the private room, leaving behind a thoroughly incensed Feng Xuanyang.

“South Wolf, get in here!” Feng Xuanyang roared.

South Wolf hurriedly entered the private room, asking, “Young Master Feng, why are you so angry? Did that brat Black Flame fail to appreciate your kindness?”

“Tell Lone Tyrant that he can take action immediately. I don’t wish to see the Guild called Zero Wing in White River City anymore.” Feng Xuanyang no longer had his elegant appearance from before. Instead, he revealed his sinister nature, saying, “Since he isn’t willing to cooperate with Underworld, then we will just remove him, one way or another. White River City does not need a Guild that Underworld cannot control.”

“Yes, I’ll notify Lone Tyrant immediately,” South Wolf said with excitement as he licked his lips.

After Shi Feng departed from the high-class bar, he immediately headed towards the Teleportation Hall. Spending 32 Silver Coins, he quickly arrived at Star-Moon City, Star-Moon Kingdom’s most affluent city.

Compared to White River City, the competition at Star-Moon City was much more intense. Just the number of first-rate Guilds present in the city already surpassed five. The second- and third-rate Guilds were even more numerous. Meanwhile, the player population at Star-Moon City was over three million. Such a number could easily match the total number of players in White River City and its neighboring seven cities.

One could say that Star-Moon City was a location that every Guild needed to compete for in the future. After all, it was a super-city that would be able to contain over ten million players in the future. Meanwhile, the resources available in the surroundings of Star-Moon City were even more abundant. There were plenty of high-level maps that were only a short distance away from the city. Obtaining Star-Moon City would be the equivalent of occupying a fifth of the entire Star-Moon Kingdom’s resources.
