Chapter 2452 – Steel Giant Reappears

As soon as Shi Feng finished his statement, the meeting room full of several dozen players fell deathly silent as Divine Tribe’s members turned to give Shi Feng disdainful looks.

“This guy’s really ambitious!”

“Crap! Star Valley? Does he think we’re his personal subordinates? He actually wants us to go on a suicide mission!”

The western continent’s various superpowers were very familiar with Star Valley. They all dreamed of owning a town or city in the map. Not only was Star Valley rich in ores, but it was also home to plenty of ancient ruins.

In addition, Star Valley housed one of the only two known God Mod Regional Dungeons on the western continent. It was everyone’s target for exploration and capture.

And Shi Feng wanted to capture the Starlight Fortress in Star Valley.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, that area is a Level 100-plus forbidden land. I’m afraid you overestimate the Silver Lion Legion. Even if with the Great Elder’s 100,000-man army, I doubt we’ll even get through the Starlight Fortress’s gate, much less capture it,” MacAffrey insisted. Rather than get angry at Shi Feng’s goal, he offered a bitter smile.

If Divine Tribe had the power to capture the Starlight Fortress, it would’ve done so long ago. There were too many benefits to owning a fortress in Star Valley to ignore. No superpower could ignore the temptation.

However, not a single superpower had successfully captured one of Star Valley’s fortresses.

MacAffrey acknowledged that Shi Feng was incredibly strong, beyond the reach of ordinary apex experts, but a handful of players wouldn’t be enough to capture a fortress, especially one in a forbidden land. One would need an extremely powerful army to succeed.

“I understand your concerns, Vice Commander Affrey. I’ve done my own research on the Starlight Fortress. I am sure, with the Silver Lion Legion’s help, we can capture it,” Shi Feng explained.

During his previous life, Star Valley had been extremely famous on the western continent due to its abundant resources. The fortresses in the forbidden land were goldmines, and the various powers had investigated them thoroughly. Even a second-rate Guild like Shadow had learned plenty about these fortresses.

After considering the Silver Lion Legion’s strength, Shi Feng had decided that the Starlight Fortress was their best option.

The Starlight Fortress was also one of the few fortresses that they had any chance of capturing. Star Valley was indeed a Level 100-plus neutral map, and as such, it was a dangerous location, even to veteran Tier 3 players.

However, that was precisely the reason that Shi Feng wanted it.

Star Valley’s fortresses had survived since ancient times, so they contained legacies that were far stronger than anything from the current era.

The human race had had far more Tier 3 individuals than it did now. In fact, completing their promotion to Tier 3 hadn’t been nearly as difficult during ancient times, but the human race had eventually lost many of their legacies in the countless wars since, making it far more of a challenge to reach Tier 3.

If he could capture the Starlight Fortress, Zero Wing’s Tier 3 experts would gain a massive boost in strength.

“Since you’ve made up your mind, I suppose I have nothing more to say, Guild Leader Black Flame. We can set out once the Silver Lion Legion has rested,” MacAffrey conceded. Seeing Shi Feng’s confidence, he gave up trying to dissuade the Swordsman. Divine Tribe had already forged an agreement with Shi Feng, and it was up to him which town or city they attacked. Whether or not they succeeded was none of his concern.

Following which, the Silver Lion Legion’s 8,000 members prepared for their expedition to Star Valley.

After the meeting, MacAffrey gave his report to Adolf.

“He wants to capture one of Star Valley’s fortresses? Doesn’t he realize that Star Valley is a special forbidden land, in which Berserk Skills are prohibited?” Adolf was a little surprised when he heard the news.

Players couldn’t rely on their Berserk Skills in the Star Valley, which was why the various superpowers had so little hope of capturing its fortresses. Those fortresses strengthened the Mythic monsters in the area, giving them far greater combat power than ordinary Mythic monsters of the same level.

Without Berserk Skills, not even Tier 3 players had a chance against those Mythic monsters. Furthermore, each of Star Valley’s fortresses contained more than one Mythic monster.

Based on the various superpowers’ reports, each fortress was guarded by at least three Mythics; some even had five. A ton of Great Lords and Grand Lords had also garrisoned these fortresses. Just thinking about fighting all of those powerful monsters made Adolfs skin crawl.

Even with Divine Tribe’s trump card, the Tier 4 Hero Summoning Scroll, they couldn’t capture a fortress of that caliber. Shi Feng, however, insisted on accepting the challenge...

“He is adamant that he’s done his research, and he’s confident that we can capture the Starlight Fortress,” Crimson Witch explained from beside MacAffrey, her tone dripping with contempt.

At this stage of the game, the various superpowers had barely scratched Star Valley’s surface. They had barely begun to exploit the forbidden land’s resources. To truly capture one of the Star Valley’s fortresses, the various superpowers would have to wait until they had several thousand Tier 3 experts under their command. Without those numbers, killing the fortress’s Great Lords and Grand Lords would be a problem, not to mention the Mythic monsters.

“I want all of you to be careful. If you lose over 20% of your forces, retreat immediately,” Adolf instructed after giving the matter some thought. The various superpowers have already begun to raid Level 100 Team Dungeons, and they will conduct many more large-scale operations in the future. We can’t afford to suffer serious losses at this crucial moment. Level 100 Team Dungeons are our Guild’s top priority!”

“Understood!” MacAffrey replied. He shared a similar opinion with the Great Elder. It was far better to focus their attention on raiding Level 100 Team Dungeons than aim for an unrealistic goal like capturing the Starlight Fortress.

Level 100 Team Dungeons had the weapons and equipment they needed to boost their strength by a large margin. That equipment would also help the Guild’s Tier 2 experts complete their Tier 3 Promotion Quests much sooner. Their Guild would only grow stronger as a whole if they had more Tier 3 players.

Following which, MacAffrey met up with Shi Feng’s group at the Teleportation Hall with the Silver Lion Legion in tow. They teleported to the Golden Sands Kingdom, the closest country to the Star Valley. The Golden Sands Kingdom was also a desolate country, with 80% of its territory comprised of desert.

Once they had reached the Golden Sands Desert, the group continued for another 10 hours or so on Mounts to reach the Star Valley’s outer region.

When the group arrived, the mighty Silver Lion Legion stunned the various major powers’ experts in the area. Although the legion members had concealed their identities with Black Cloaks, their intense auras drove off any Tier 3 experts in their way. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Finally, after another three hours of travel, Shi Feng and his small army reached the top of a forested hill a short distance from the Starlight Fortress. From this vantage point, they could all see the massive tower in the middle of the forest and the sturdy walls that surrounded it.

“Oh? People have made it here already?” Shi Feng was a little taken aback to see a group of players fighting a short distance away from the fortress.

Star Valley was a Level 100-plus forbidden land, and very few players had the strength to grind in its outer region, much less near the Starlight Fortress.

The Starlight Fortress was situated on the boundary between the Star Valley’s inner and outer regions. Even the weakest monster here was a Level 105 Lord, and the strongest was a Level 110 Mythic Boss. Not even the various superpowers’ main forces dared to approach this area casually.

And yet, a group of players fought near the fortress’s entrance. It was astounding!

There were only 500 members of the team, and every one of them was an independent player...

“What a powerful adventurer team! They have over 30 Tier 3 players on a 500-man team, and the lowest level among them is Level 105. This team can practically rival a top-ranked first-rate Guild’s main force,” Crimson Witch commented.

Of course, when Shi Feng’s group had noticed the adventurer team, the members of that team had noticed Shi Feng and his small army.

“There’s so many of them, Boss. What should we do?” a Level 106, Tier 3 Ranger asked the robust man tanking a Level 110 Grand Lord ranked Archaic Species.

Although this robust man only wore leather armor and wielded a pair of gauntlets as weapons, a layer of strange energy enveloped his form, which drastically reduced the amount of damage he took from the Grand Lord’s attacks. Even when the Grand Lord successfully landed a hit, the man only lost around 20,000 HP. To Tier 3 players, this amount of damage was practically negligible.

“This Quest Boss is already in the red. Ignore them for now. If they dare try to steal our kill, we’ll drag them down with us!” the robust man growled. His gaze contained no fear, even after he noticed the Silver Lion Legion’s overwhelming numbers.

“I agree. I have checked their Mana signatures. They might have more players, but only 70 of them are Tier 3 players. If it comes down to a fight, we’ll make them suffer!” A ruthless man, who wore similar leather armor and wielded a greatsword, agreed with a sharp nod.

Any other adventurer team would’ve likely fled if they encountered the Silver Lion Legion, but they were different. They’d never back down from a fight, even if they faced an army of 8,000 players with several hundred Tier 3 experts.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, should we make them leave?” MacAffrey asked as he turned toward Shi Feng.

They were here to capture a fortress. Even if they were merely a slightly powerful adventurer team, outsiders could affect the outcome of their operation.

However, as Shi Feng was their commander this time, and MacAffrey decided to seek his guidance, rather than take action immediately.

“That won’t be necessary. We’ll just do our own thing,” Shi Feng said, shaking his head. He had no intention of clearing out the area.

“If we don’t force them to leave, Guild Leader Black Flame, we won’t be able to besiege the front gate,” MacAffrey insisted, exasperated.

The Starlight Fortress only had one entrance, and it was the least protected area. Thick walls that were 12 meters high surrounded the fortress on every other side, and they were treated with special magic that prevented players from vaulting over them. In addition, many Level 110 Great Lord and Grand Lord ranked Elemental Guards paced atop the walls. Not only could these Elemental Guards launch long-range attacks, but they also had AOE Spells.

Those monsters would likely bombard them to smithereens before they could destroy the fortress’s walls.

Before MacAffrey could continue, however, Shi Feng retrieved a steel giant that blotted out the sky.
