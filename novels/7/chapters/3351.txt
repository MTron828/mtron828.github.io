Chapter 426 – Powerful Background?

“Sir?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

White Owl looked at Nameless Blade’s stunned expression in surprise.

Nameless Blade could be regarded as the most suitable successor for the Paimon Conglomerate. It wasn’t only because he possessed extraordinary talent. Aside from talent, he also had a calm temperament that allowed him to work without being swayed by his emotions. Even when faced with major events, he rarely showed any emotional fluctuations.

Yet, now, Nameless Blade was clearly expressing his shock through his voice and his face. This was the first time White Owl had seen Nameless Blade reacting in such a manner.

!!

“How is this possible? Why would someone of her stature appear here?” Nameless Blade muttered in disbelief as he looked at the projection in the sky.

“Her?” Out of curiosity, White Owl followed Nameless Blade’s line of sight and found that he was looking at an innocent and lovely woman. However, even after searching her memories, she failed to recognize the woman. “Do you know her, Sir?”

“I’m not sure if she’s the same person I know, but…” After catching his breath, Nameless Blade said, “If she really is that person, Zero Wing’s background is far more powerful than I initially thought.”

“Does that woman have a powerful background?” White Owl curiously asked. Nameless Blade was the Paimon Conglomerate’s Second Successor, so she found it hard to imagine anyone could awe him to such a degree.

It should be known that even when dealing with that woman favored by the heavens from the Galaxy Conglomerate, Nameless Blood would only show an appropriate amount of respect. He would never react in awe like he was now.

“It was roughly a year ago that I met her in Horizon City,” Nameless Blade said. “Back then, she was already ranked in the 600s of the Luminous Glory List. And after only one year, she improved her rank to 326th…”

“326th?” When White Owl heard Nameless Blade mentioning the Luminous Glory List, she quickly recalled the latest edition of the list she had memorized. Then, looking at the woman on the screen in disbelief, she exclaimed, “The Little Princess of the Platinum Realm’s Dragon Tongue Conglomerate!”

“Yes, that’s her,” Nameless Blade said, nodding.

“But why would a big shot like her help Zero Wing?” White Owl was puzzled. “Moreover, she is even helping Zero Wing in person. Could you be mistaken?”

The Platinum Realm was much stronger than the Starlight Realm. Meanwhile, the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s status in the Platinum Realm was similar to the Galaxy Conglomerate’s status in the Starlight Realm.

As for Cheng Xin, the Dragon Tongue Conglomerate’s Little Princess, she was one of the strongest and most talented individuals among the Platinum Realm’s younger generation. With her identity and strength, even the Paimon Conglomerate’s helmsman would have to treat her like an equal when dealing with her.

White Owl found it very hard to imagine why a big shot like Cheng Xin would be willing to help Zero Wing in a city battle.

It should be known that Cheng Xin would be humbling herself even if she participated in a first-tier city battle, let alone a third-tier city battle. For someone of her stature to participate in a third-tier would be humiliating.

“Let’s hope I am wrong,” Nameless Blade said as he sat back down in his seat and took a sip of tea.

If the lovely woman in Zero Wing’s battle group truly was Cheng Xin, it’d be very difficult for Thousand Scars and Death Omen to get Shi Feng to owe them a favor. After all, Cheng Xin was 326th on the Luminous Glory List. Even if she had a delay imposed on her actions, she could still exhibit extraordinary strength. While Cheng Xin might not be able to defeat the current Reckless Knight, she would have no trouble distracting him and giving the other members of Zero Wing’s battle group time to escape.

…

While Nameless Blade and White Owl were chatting at the VIP stands, the first round of the city battle between Star Lake City and Riverlight City officially began.

Shortly after the round began, five of Riverlight City’s battle groups assembled, each with twenty members. All five battle groups were Riverlight City’s ace battle groups, and even the weakest player among them was a titled expert. In addition, every one of them was fully clad in Fragmented Legendary items.

“All of our ace battle groups have assembled, Sir. We can march into Star Lake City’s territory at any time,” a Guardian Knight in his fifties said respectfully to the smart-looking young man in front of him.

“Okay. Move out according to plan,” the smart-looking young man said, nodding. After saying so, he immediately vanished from everyone’s sight, nobody managing to see how or where he had left.

“Is he even human?” a youth who had only recently joined one of Riverlight City’s ace battle groups exclaimed with widened eyes.

Players’ Physique in simulation warfare was significantly weaker than their Physique in God’s Domain. Even at Tier 4, players would, at most, have a Tier 1 Physique in simulation warfare. And although some weapons and equipment provided bonuses to Physique, these bonuses would be weakened considerably, and even Legendary Weapons could only provide a small improvement.

Yet, despite having a drastically weaker Physique, the smart-looking young man still managed to disappear under their noses. His speed was simply inhuman.

“Enough talking!” The Guardian Knight in charge of coordinating the five battle groups shouted when he saw that everyone started to chatter. Then, he commanded, “As planned, spread out and search for Zero Wing’s battle group once we are on Star Lake City’s side! Once you find them, inform Mr. Reckless Knight immediately!”

“Understood!”

Everyone responded in unison before dashing toward Star Lake City.

With five battle groups’ worth of members spreading out and searching for Zero Wing’s battle group, it took no more than ten minutes before one of them found a capture point occupied by Zero Wing’s battle group.

To occupy a capture point, participants only needed to insert their city’s flag into the designated location and keep it inserted for five minutes. Once the five minutes were up, the capture point would be assigned to their city. If the other side wished to take over the capture point, they would have to cut away the flag, insert their own flag, and wait for another five minutes.

Each round of a city battle would last for two hours or until one side was annihilated. Meanwhile, each city’s points would be tallied up at the end of each round.

Originally, whenever participants came across the enemy trying to occupy a capture point, they should try to disrupt the process right away. Otherwise, once a capture point was occupied, all friendlies within a fixed range of the capture point would receive a small buff to their Basic Attributes. Although it was only a 3% buff, it could still potentially have game-changing effects.

However, the Ranger who found Zero Wing’s battle group did not try to disrupt the occupation process. Instead, he contacted Reckless Knight and messaged him about the location of Zero Wing’s battle group.

“Good! Everyone assemble at that location! Do not let Zero Wing’s members get away!” Reckless Knight said through the team chat before making his way to Zero Wing’s battle group’s location.

…

Star Lake City, atop a building housing a capture point…

“Boss Markless, I don’t know why, but those people from Riverlight are gathering toward a single location and ignoring everything else. They don’t bother fighting any of us they come across, and they’re even willing to take damage for free just to get to that location,” a Level 140 Assassin hurriedly reported to Markless Blade. “Should we follow them to see what’s going on?”

“It seems these people are adamant about targeting Zero Wing,” Markless Blade said, exasperated by the report. “Contact the other battle groups and have everyone gather at Zero Wing’s location. We’ll rely on our numerical advantage to eliminate these suicidal battle groups.”

“Understood!”

Immediately, the Assassin began contacting the other battle groups, telling them to go and reinforce Zero Wing’s battle group.

…

“Should we go, Boss?”

“Of course not. If Markless Blade wants to go, he can go by himself. We don’t have the time to play with them. Now that Riverlight City’s ace battle groups are preoccupied, this is the perfect chance for us to steal their capture points.”

None of Star Lake City’s battle groups paid any heed to Markless Blade’s notice, as none of them were willing to let such a good opportunity to occupy more capture points get away. Not to mention, they had already made an agreement with Chen Qilin not to help Zero Wing, so it was all the more reason for them not to help Zero Wing.
