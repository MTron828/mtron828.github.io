Chapter 3771 - 845 - Complete Abyssal Eye

When Shi Feng accepted Enos’s offer, a series of system notifications rang in his ears.

System: Congratulations! You have accepted the Mythical World Main Storyline Quest “The Past World.”
Quest Content: Kill the Undying Mother and obtain its Undying Tentacle in three months. Rewards unknown.

System: You have accepted “The Past World” Quest. Enos’s Favorability for you has increased by 20 points. All items in the Abyss Workshop can be purchased at cost.

System: The Undying Mother senses your existence and curses your soul. As time goes by, your soul will gradually weaken until it ceases to exist.

Following the system notifications, the prices on the list in Shi Feng’s hands underwent drastic changes.

Advanced Epic Combat Puppets were now 40 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal each, down from 120 million.

The God of the North Sea Flying Ship now cost only 350 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, down from 600 million units.

Four Gods Potions were now 30 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal each, down from 60 million.

World Sources were now 35 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal each, down from 50 million.

The Primordial Abyssal Eye now cost only 80 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal, down from 300 million units.

“You’ve made a smart choice. But don’t forget: you only have three months. You must bring me the Undying Tentacle in three months,” Enos said. “Also, you’d best act within 45 days. Otherwise, your soul will become too weak to confront the Undying Mother. If you don’t have any questions, hurry up and buy what you want. You have thirty seconds left.”

As expected of a Mythic-ranked World Main Storyline Quest. Shi Feng wasn’t particularly surprised by Enos’s warning. He immediately returned his attention to the list in his hands.

A Mythic-ranked World Main Storyline Quest naturally wouldn’t be an easy quest to complete. He was well aware of this. It was unreasonable to expect him to kill the Undying Mother in 90 days, let alone 45 days. Even if the entire human race came together, he doubted they could find a way to kill the Undying Mother in such a short time.

However, Enos was a Primordial God-ranked existence. She must know he lacked the capabilities to complete her quest. Yet, she still placed a three-month time limit on her quest. This must mean that once he accepted the quest, there would be a lifeline he could rely on to complete it.

As for what that lifeline was, it was most likely the Primordial Abyssal Eye!

“I want to buy the Primordial Abyssal Eye,” Shi Feng said without hesitation. “I also want three World Sources.”

If there was anything he could use to kill a Taboo Boss like the Undying Mother, it would have to be the complete Abyssal Eye. After all, the Abyssal Eye was the Abyssal Lord’s possession. It could exhibit power far beyond the average Divine Artifact at its peak. If he leveraged it effectively, killing the Undying Mother wouldn’t be out of the question.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

So long as he killed the Undying Mother, not only could he complete Enos’s quest, but he could also obtain a Taboo Nucleus and challenge his Tier 7 promotion.

“Are you not going to choose the Advanced Epic Combat Puppets?” Enos looked at Shi Feng in surprise. She hadn’t thought Shi Feng would spend his remaining Seven Luminaries Crystals on World Sources rather than Advanced Epic Combat Puppets, which could help him against the Undying Mother. Nevertheless, she quickly took out the four items Shi Feng requested and said, “One Primordial Abyssal Eye and three World Sources. Your total comes to 185 million units of Seven Luminaries Crystal.”

“I’m fine with the World Sources. Here’s 185 million units,” Shi Feng said as he handed Enos the majority of his Seven Luminaries Crystals. When he received the Primordial Abyssal Eye and World Sources, he couldn’t help but look at them zealously.

Enos’s Advanced Epic Combat Puppets were indeed amazing. A group of sixteen could form a Small Gold Battle Array and gain the strength to rival Ancient Gods. Even if he bought just three or four, they could still help him greatly in his conquest of the Undying Mother.

However, the Abyss Workshop wasn’t the only source of Advanced Epic Combat Puppets for Shi Feng.

With enough Seven Luminaries Crystals, Shi Feng could modify and strengthen the Advanced Dark-Gold God Slayer Combat Puppets to the Advanced Epic rank. Even if the God Slayer Combat Puppets turned out to be inferior to Enos’s combat puppets, the difference shouldn’t be too significant.

But it was a different story for World Sources. They were items that might only appear after a Realm’s destruction. Who knew when he would get another chance to acquire World Sources so easily?

“Suit yourself,” Enos said, shrugging, as she couldn’t understand Shi Feng’s thoughts. Then, she waved her hand at Shi Feng and continued, “Since you’re done shopping, it’s time to leave.”

Immediately, Shi Feng felt a powerful force pulling him from behind and into a space-time passage. When he came to his senses, he was already back in his office in Shadowring Town.

Is this a Primordial God’s strength? When Shi Feng saw that he was back in his office, he couldn’t help but be amazed by Enos. The difference between them was so massive that he didn’t even have time to react to the other party’s actions. It was no longer a difference that could be compensated with Basic Attributes.

While Shi Feng recalled Enos’s capabilities, Red Frost suddenly called him.

“Guild Leader Black Flame, it’s almost the appointed time. Are we not leaving yet?” Red Frost asked, feeling a little puzzled as she looked at Shi Feng’s somewhat dazed expression. “The Primordial Dragon Sanctuary is far from the Starlight Realm. Although I have a Tier 6 Teleportation Passage Scroll for the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, the journey will still take several hours. If we don’t leave soon, we might not make it…”

“Leave? But isn’t there still a day to…” When Shi Feng heard Red Frost’s question, his first thought was that they still had plenty of time. However, before he finished his sentence, he suddenly recalled that not all places in God’s Domain experienced the same time flow. Thus, he quickly changed his words and said, “Okay, we’ll leave right away.”

Previously, he had already discussed with Red Frost that they would visit Holy Dragon Spear’s headquarters together. After all, Zero Wing needed to partner with Holy Dragon Spear to raid Taboo Bosses in the future. As Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, he naturally had to be present when Red Frost participated in Holy Dragon Spear’s Battle of the Chosen Ones.

“I’ll go to you now,” Red Frost said, nodding before hanging up.

After concluding his call with Red Frost, Shi Feng had Hidden Soul deliver the Tower of the Abyss’s recent profits to him. Then, he carefully took out the Primordial Abyssal Eye from his bag.

System: The Abyssal Eye has discovered the missing fragments of its core. Do you wish to repair the Abyssal Eye with the Primordial Abyssal Eye?

“Repair it!”

Shi Feng chose to repair the Abyssal Eye after taking a deep breath.

TL Notes:
[1]Battle of the Chosen Ones:
I have decided to capitalize “battle of the chosen ones.” I’ve already made the changes to previous chapters.
