Chapter 432 - One-hit Extermination

Upon listening to Oriental Sword’s words, a cold glint flashed across Shi Feng’s eyes.

Suddenly, the surrounding atmosphere froze.

“What? Want to fight?” Although Oriental Sword could feel a heavy pressure enveloping him, his confidence did not waver. He then unsheathed the longsword hung on his back, provocatively saying, “Come if you can, then. Seeing as everyone out there is calling you a god, I really wish to see just what kind of ability you possess.”

When Oriental Sword spoke in such a way, everyone from Overwhelming Smile sneered, secretly making preparations for battle.

With 150 players on their side, it would be a piece of cake for them to take care of just five players.

They were different from those noobs Black Flame had massacred before. They would not easily be defeated just because their skills were Silenced.

After learning and training in God’s Domain for such a long time, they had long since familiarized themselves with the combat styles of the game. Right now, they had no problems fighting solo with an Elite monster. Although a handful of them might not be a match for Black Flame, if all one hundred and fifty of them stood sparsely apart from each other and attacked together, they did not believe that Black Flame could walk out of this place alive!

However, before the crowd from Overwhelming Smile could react, Shi Feng, who stood ten yards away, suddenly disappeared.

“Where is he?”

Oriental Sword’s eyes were filled with disbelief when he suddenly lost sight of Shi Feng.

A Swordsman could actually suddenly vanish from thin air? Even Assassins required some time to enter Stealth.

Not to mention Oriental Sword, even Aqua Rose and the others were stunned. Shi Feng had just suddenly disappeared.

Did he log off? The only reasoning Aqua Rose could come up with was that Shi Feng had logged out of the game. However, when she checked the list of party members, Shi Feng’s status showed that he was still online; his name did not turn gray.

However, before one second had passed, Shi Feng suddenly reappeared beside Oriental Sword. Following which, blades of light slashed apart the air, silently cutting up Oriental Sword’s body. Before Oriental Sword knew what was going on, he suddenly felt pain bloom in his body. In the next moment, he saw blood gushing out like a waterfall in front of him.

“What’s going on?”

Oriental Sword touched the wounds covering his body, confused. Suddenly, his body lost all strength as it slumped down onto the ground. Laying on the ground, Oriental Sword saw Shi Feng through his grayed vision. He also saw the Abyssal Blade grasped in Shi Feng’s hand, fresh blood slowly dripping off the weapon.

The blood dripped to the ground as if it were a countdown to death.

“How?” Even at his moment of death, Oriental Sword still could not believe what had just happened.

He, a top-tier expert of Overwhelming Smile, had actually died without a chance to respond...

After Oriental Sword died, everyone from Overwhelming Smile who was originally feeling confident halted.

They simply could not comprehend what had just happened.

Shi Feng had just suddenly disappeared, before reappearing once again beside Oriental Sword. Immediately after, blood gushed out from Oriental Sword’s body. Simultaneously, a damage of -4,368 points appeared above the man’s head, the damage completely exceeding the Swordsman’s total HP.

Oriental Sword’s sudden death had struck fear into the crowd from Overwhelming Smile. The gaze they used to look at Shi Feng was as if looking at a ferocious beast.

When Shi Feng’s eyes landed on them, they felt as if they had lost control of their own bodies.

“Bug! This must be a bug!” a player from Overwhelming Smile suddenly shouted in fright. “He must have grasped a loophole in the system! Let’s send feedback to the Main God System right now! We’ll see what he can do then!”

Everyone present felt that those words sounded logical. Otherwise, how were they supposed to explain this unbelievable incident?

Hence, everyone started sending reports to the Main God System. Only by doing so would they possess a chance for survival.

“Guild Leader couldn’t have abused a bug, right?” Aqua Rose could not make sense of the situation, either. She was similarly shocked by the scene she had just witnessed.

The Main God System controlled God’s Domain. It was simply impossible for such a glaring loophole to exist in the game. Yet, if it was not a loophole, how could they explain the situation before them?

“Of course it is not a loophole in the system. Guild Leader is the number one expert of Star-Moon Kingdom. Previously, he had simply used an advanced combat technique. These people are simply too ignorant,” Fire Dance said proudly, a faint smile on her face. She spoke as if she were the one who had personally finished off Oriental Sword.

Within the Ruined Shrine in the inner region of White Fog Canyon, a large number of Guild players had gathered. Among them, members of Overwhelming Smile numbered the most, with over 5,000 members present.

There were a large number of monsters inside the Ruined Shrine. Moreover, a majority of these monsters were Special Elites. Among them were plenty of Chieftains. The monsters here ranged from Level 24 to Level 27. To the current elite members of Guilds, it was a level that they could barely handle. If not for the fact that they had the advantage in numbers, they would have long since been wiped out by the monsters inside the Ruined Shrine.

“Damn! The monsters here are endless! They’re even more troublesome than the Battle Monkeys before!” Lone Tyrant said, somewhat exhausted. Currently, he was going up against a Level 27 Chieftain, a Goblin Warrior.

Despite the Goblin Warrior being twice as large as an ordinary player, it was quite agile. In addition, the hammer it wielded contained frightening, destructive power. Even a Tier 1 MT of the same level would find it difficult to endure its series of violent assaults, much less Lone Tyrant, who was only a Level 25 Tier 0 Guardian Knight.

Although Lone Tyrant possessed impressive techniques, his dodging capabilities being first-rate, the Goblin Warrior also possessed powerful combat techniques. Whenever the Goblin Warrior attacked Lone Tyrant, it would always predict where Lone Tyrant would dodge and take that into account in its attack, forcing Lone Tyrant to accept the damage.

Moreover, every time he received an attack from the Goblin Warrior’s hammer, his defensive posture would always fail. This resulted in him being unable to use his shield to block the next attack, and instead, he received the attack with his body.

From just a single strike of its hammer, Lone Tyrant received close to -1,300 damage. Lone Tyrant only possessed 4,520 HP; he could endure four hits, at most.

If he were only dealing with a single Goblin Warrior, Lone Tyrant would not end up in such a miserable state.

However, aside from the Goblin Warrior, there were also many Goblin Mages at the sides. These Goblin Mages were all Level 26 Special Elites. They bombarded players with ice and fire, and any players struck by their spells would instantly lose around 1,700 HP. Other than MTs, nobody else could survive two hits.

Within the Ruined Shrine, aside from the members of Overwhelming Smile having a hard time, the other Guilds were similarly facing great difficulties.

The monsters inside the Ruined Shrine were simply endless. No matter how many they killed, the monsters just kept coming. Without sufficient strength, they simply had no way of reaching the Level 25 Great Lord in a short amount of time, let alone raiding it.

Before Overwhelming Smile had finished off the monsters at hand, another wave of Goblins charged over.

Suddenly, everyone from Overwhelming Smile felt a headache overcome them.

“Cursemancers, Cripple them. Elementalists, use Ice Walls and separate the incoming monsters. Rangers, lure some away and kite them; do not let the pressure on the MTs increase!” Youlan immediately shouted in the team chat.

Immediately, the elites of Overwhelming Smile started taking action, luring the Goblins away and letting the MTs take a breather.

Lone Tyrant could not help but send a glance at the charming and graceful Youlan. Inwardly, he felt displeasure towards the woman. He was actually required to listen to her commands. However, he also had no choice but to admit that Youlan was indeed amazing. They were only able to reach their current location thanks to Youlan. Otherwise, they would not have been able to pass through the Battle Monkeys. Even if they could, they would have had to suffer immense losses.

Take Emperor’s Light and the Assassin’s Alliance for example: since entering White Fog Canyon, their total numbers had already decreased by a quarter.

Meanwhile, under Youlan’s command, Overwhelming Smile was able to advance through White Fog Canyon easily. Along their way to the Ruined Shrine, they had only lost a small number of players.

Shortly after Overwhelming Smile cleared out all the Goblins, Youlan received a message. After reading the message, her expression turned grim.

Lone Tyrant could feel Youlan’s mood suddenly changing, and he could not help but ask, “What happened?”

After spending some time together, Lone Tyrant had a general grasp on this woman. She was always calm and collected. Even in the face of several Lord ranked monsters, she would remain unfazed. Yet, now, after seeing a single message, her expression had turned solemn... VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

How could Lone Tyrant not grow curious at this situation?
