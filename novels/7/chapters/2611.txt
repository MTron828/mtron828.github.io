Chapter 2612 – Negotiation Qualifications

Torre’s harsh rejection drove a chill down everyone’s spines. The players in the hall felt an intense pressure bear down on them, and some of the Refinement Realm trainees could barely even move...

Instinctual fear welled within the Tier 3 Assassin that had reported Zero Wing’s arrival. If he hadn’t been certain that he wasn’t Torre’s target, he would’ve likely turned and fled.

Instructor Torre has such high hopes for Solitary Frost’s group? Crimson Star was surprised to see the frosty look on Torre’s face.

Torre had stopped teaching people over a decade ago. She and the current commander of Violet Sword’s strongest trump card legion had been a part of his last student group. The commander had been Torre’s favorite pupil. Torre had even gone to great lengths to seek the Flame Bearer’s help in training the commander.

Hence, Violet Sword’s upper echelons had been stunned when Torre had agreed to train Solitary Frost’s group.

Crimson Star assumed Torre had only agreed out of respect for the Zeus Corporation, but seeing his reaction now, it seemed he had honestly wanted to help Solitary Frost’s group grow stronger. If he hadn’t been so invested, he wouldn’t have been so furious about their defeat.

“I’m afraid that sending them away isn’t wise, Instructor Torre. Zero Wing might not have much power on the western continent, but it can compete with many superpowers on the eastern continent. It even has control over the Dark World’s Teleportation Gate. Since Zero Wing’s Guild Leader has paid us a personal visit, others will criticize the Guild if we turn him away at the door,” Wildfighter tried to persuade Torre.

Violet Sword was a veteran Super Guild. While Zero Wing wasn’t based in the west, Violet Sword’s intel network had investigated this smaller Guild. They weren’t entirely unaware of Zero Wing’s background. Even if they hadn’t researched the Guild, it was difficult to avoid the name ‘Zero Wing.’ The Guild had become incredibly famous in the east, after all, and many superpowers were talking about Zero Wing.

“Did Zero Wing’s Guild Leader come alone?” Crimson Star asked the Tier 3 Assassin.

“No. He came with a group of a dozen or so people. The Long Family’s Long Wushang is with them, as well,” the Assassin replied.

“The Long Family? They certainly didn’t waste any time.” Wildfighter could not help but frown.

After learning that the Long Family’s second young miss had won Azure’s competition this year, Wildfighter knew it would be difficult making the family obey. Now, Azure’s strongest younger member was from the Long Family, and after all was said and done, the Zeus Corporation was merely one of the chamber’s shareholders. It wasn’t the largest shareholder. Once the rest of the shareholders saw the Long Family’s potential, they would offer it their support. Threatening the Long Family’s dominance in Azure would become incredibly difficult.Read more at l isnovel

Because of this, the Long Family now qualified to negotiate with Violet Sword, and it had only been a matter of time before the family sent a representative.

However, Wildfighter hadn’t expected the Long Family to act almost as soon as Azure’s family competition had ended.

“It seems the Long Family has found its confidence. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have shown up so soon,” Crimson Star said.

“It’s probably because of Zero Wing. The Guild has an alliance with Netherworld Empire, after all. In addition, Zero Wing is responsible for helping Silent Wonder win the competition. Obviously, Zero Wing is quite capable when it comes to nurturing talented players. The Long Family must think it’ll do fine on its own, without support from Violet Sword or the Zeus Corporation,” Wildfighter assumed.

The most important developmental aspects for any Guild were talented experts and resources. While Azure did not lack experts, it didn’t have nearly as many resources as a veteran Super Guild like Violet Sword. If Azure wished to continue its development, it would have to ally with the Super Guild. This was exactly what Azure’s various shareholder families and Grand Elders were pushing for.

However, if Azure no longer had to worry about nurturing its talented members, neither the Long Family nor the chamber itself would bother to ally with Violet Sword. Violet Sword was already demanding a high price for this alliance, and the partnership would basically transform Azure into one of Violet Sword’s vassals. None of Azure’s shareholders wanted this, but they had to agree due to the immense pressure the Zeus Corporation placed on them to agree.

“This is interesting. Show them to the reception room and make them wait for a while,” Torre decided. “I’m interested to see what ability Zero Wing has to make the Long Family so confident!”

“Understood!”

The Tier 3 Assassin breathed a sigh of relief as Torre calmed down. He then ran back to the Residence’s entrance.

Meanwhile, a crowd had formed outside of Violet Sword’s Residence, embroiled in a heated discussion regarding Zero Wing’s members.

The group of players was just too eye-catching.

Two gigantic Flying Mounts stood behind Zero Wing’s members: an eagle, with arcs of electricity dancing across its body, and a Skeletal Dragon, radiating bursts of cold. Both Flying Mounts had auras on par with Grand Lords of the same level, and when they stood side-by-side, they were impossible to ignore.

“Crap! Who are these people?! They actually have two Mounts that rival Violet Sword’s Netherflame Eagle!”

“What an amazing Guild! Violet Sword only has two Extraordinary Flying Mounts, yet these people have two, as well!”

At this stage of the game, Flying Mounts were still unattainable for most of God’s Domain’s players. Even the various large Guilds only had a few Flying Mounts, and most of those were common. Even so, it was enough to allow them to flaunt their strength.

Meanwhile, the various Super Guilds would go crazy for Extraordinary Flying Mounts, which could hold their own against Grand Lords of the same level. Not everyone could say the same. Even most Tier 3 experts would have to flee from such a monster. Only with a team of Tier 3 experts could take down Grand Lords of the same level.

However, not only could a Guild easily hunt Grand Lord ranked Field Bosses with an Extraordinary Flying Mount, but they could also broaden their sphere of activity, visiting far more dangerous locations in search of resources.

While passersby quietly discussed Zero Wing’s two Flying Mounts, Long Wushang, who waited at the entrance to Violet Sword’s Residence, began to grow nervous. He had never thought Shi Feng would go through with his claim and travel to Violet Sword as soon as Azure’s family competition ended. The Swordsman hadn’t even given Violet Sword any time to calm down after learning of its defeat.

The competition’s outcome had as good as ruined the Zeus Corporation and Violet Sword’s plans to take control of the Azure Chamber of Commerce. Needless to say, they’d be furious, and they’d definitely blame Zero Wing, the Guild that had played a major role in foiling their plans.

Although the Long Family and Zero Wing now qualified to negotiate with Zeus and Violet Sword, they shouldn’t push for negotiations while the other side was still fuming. Not only would they fail to change the corporation and Super Guild’s minds, but they might make the situation worse.

“Wonder, can you persuade your Guild Leader? I know he wants to negotiate with Violet Sword, but he shouldn’t do so during such a precarious time,” Long Wushang whispered to Silent Wonder. “At this rate, not only will negotiations fail, but Violet Sword might end up hating us. We’ll lose our advantage in Azure.”

Azure’s Elders and Grand Elders did not particularly mind whether Azure partnered with Violet Sword or not, but becoming enemies would be a different story. If that happened, everything would be over for the Long Family. Too many of Azure’s key resource areas were located within Violet Sword’s territories, among others. If Violet Sword decided that it no longer cared about those resource areas, the other Super Guilds wouldn’t hesitate to fight to claim the areas. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I’ll try my best,” Silent Wonder said. She agreed with her elder’s sentiments.

Zero Wing had barely any power in the west, while Violet Sword could easily deal a major blow to the Azure Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore, Zero Wing couldn’t avoid Violet Sword if it wished to develop on the western continent. She did not wish to see her Guild face Violet Sword’s wrath over her.

However, just as Silent Wonder was about to approach Shi Feng, a Tier 3 Assassin emerged from Violet Sword’s Residence and walked up to Shi Feng, apologizing, “Sorry for the long wait, Guild Leader Black Flame. Please, follow me.”

“Alright,” Shi Feng replied, putting away his Thunder Eagle. He then followed the Assassin into the Residence, giving Silent Wonder no chance to intervene.

Upon entering the Super Guild’s Residence, both Long Wushang and Silent Wonder were stunned.

Not only were the Violet Sword members in the Residence very high-leveled, but quite a few of them were also Tier 3 experts. Moreover, they spotted over 100 Refinement Realm experts with a glance.

When they reached the castle that acted as the Residence’s core, they were even more stunned as they felt such dense Mana that it had condensed into a white fog. The entire castle felt ancient.

All of the Super Guild’s members who entered and left the castle radiated astonishingly powerful auras, while quite a few were even stronger than Azure’s young geniuses.

“So, this is Violet Sword.”

Silent Wonder was amazed as she watched the dozen or so young, Tier 3 experts walk into the castle. Even a random group of players had so many Refinement Realm and Flowing Water Realm experts. Furthermore, this was only one of Violet Sword’s many Residences, and the Guild had several training grounds. If Violet Sword gathered all of the new recruits, the sight would be awe-inspiring.

“Please, come in!” the Tier 3 Assassin leading the way said as he gestured to the Guild Hall before him. When he noticed Long Wushang’s and Silent Wonder’s astonishment, he felt pleased and proud.

Overall, Violet Sword might not be as powerful as the Five Great Super Guilds, but it was just as capable of nurturing talented players, which the Guild was quite proud of. No ordinary Super Guild could compare.

After a moment, the Tier 3 Assassin led Shi Feng and his companions into the top-floor reception room in the Guild Hall.

Three players, Torre, Wildfighter, and Crimson Star, already waited in the room. However, none of them bothered to conceal their auras, and the combined energy felt stifling. They were obviously trying to intimidate Zero Wing’s representatives.

Sure enough. Long Wushang could not help but shake his head when he saw the three people. He knew these negotiations wouldn’t end well. There wasn’t even a point in continuing this facade. The pressure of their combined auras was simply too powerful. Even peak experts would struggle to breathe in the reception room, much less weaker players.

In Long Wushang’s opinion, aside from Shi Feng, Silent Wonder, and Violet Cloud, withstanding these aggressive auras would be troublesome for their party.

Meanwhile, the Tier 3 Assassin from Violet Sword sneered at this sight. Zero Wing might be a pseudo-superpower, but Violet Sword was no ordinary Super Guild, and Zero Wing had no place trying to instigate negotiations on a whim.

“This room is really stuffy. Aqua, why don’t you guys remove your cloaks? It’ll be cooler for you that way,” Shi Feng calmly suggested, never taking his eyes off of Torre and his two comrades.
