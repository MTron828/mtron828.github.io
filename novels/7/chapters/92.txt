Chapter 93 - Dark Clown

The spiral staircase led directly to the core control area on the highest floor.

After climbing an unknown number of steps, Shi Feng arrived at a winding corridor that led towards the core area. Ancient magical runes were carved into the walls on both sides of the corridor, and even though almost a millennium had passed, this corridor was still gleaming with light. Only some parts of the corridor had decayed, damaging the magical circuits etched in it and plunging those particular areas into darkness. Fortunately, not many parts of the corridor were badly decayed, so Shi Feng was still able to clearly see the entirety of the long, narrow, and maze-like corridor.

Just after Shi Feng set foot into the corridor, the alarm once again rang out. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Alert! Alert! The intruder has already invaded Area A of the fortress, the Magic Corridor. Activating Guardian Statues on duty!”

Shi Feng then heard loud booming noises coming from the corridor, as if some gigantic machine had started moving.

Shi Feng no longer dared advance slowly. He immediately used a Speed Scroll, dashing through the Magic Corridor at flying speed.

After taking several turns in the Magic Corridor, Shi Feng discovered a machine that had a flashing red light. Although this machine was just the size of a football, it was constantly producing alarms, as if it were a tool meant for guiding the Guardian Statues.

[Sentinel Guard] (Common Monster)

Level 10

HP 200/200

Shi Feng immediately understood how he was so easily discovered. This Sentinel Guard was just like a radar. It could detect enemies within a range of 500 yards, and after discovering them, it would set off an alarm. The distance between the entrance of the corridor and this location was roughly around 500 yards, so the Sentinel Guard was able to immediately discover Shi Feng. As long as Shi Feng could get rid of it, then he would be able to rid himself of the alarms of this area.

However, this thing had very sensitive reactions. It would not let any enemies get within 30 yards. Also, if it were attacked even once, it would try to retreat with all its might. Simultaneously, it would increase its speed of calling for its allies, and it would absolutely not give the enemy a second chance to attack. It was extremely hard to deal with.

“I guess I’ve no choice left. I can only give it a try.” Shi Feng unsheathed both of his swords. He could already hear the angry roars of the Guardian Statues coming from behind him. Based on his strength, fighting in this narrow area would only lead to his own death. His only chance of throwing off those Guardian Statues was to get rid of this Sentinel Guard.

When Shi Feng was nearing the 30-yard range, just as the Sentinel Guard was about to break into a run...

Shi Feng’s eyes locked onto the Sentinel Guard, the muscles in both of his arms bulged, and with the strength of his entire body, he cast out both swords.

Xiu! Both swords flew towards the Sentinel Guard.

Precision Throw!

The throwing distance of the skill was just at 30 yards, and it caused 150% of his weapon’s damage.

The Sentinel Guard was extremely vigilant. It rapidly moved its body, immediately dodging the Crimson Blade that flew at it. However, the Sentinel Guard’s dodge had, in turn, placed it in the flight path of Shi Feng’s second sword, the Abyssal Blade.

Peng!

The Abyssal Blade pierced through the Sentinel Guard, causing -211 damage and instantly killing it.

System: Level 10 Sentinel Guard killed. Level difference of 4. EXP obtained increased by 400%. Obtained 800 EXP.

Shi Feng activated Windwalk, his speed once again increasing by a notch as he rushed to pull out his swords that pierced into the ground. He then rushed towards the Magic Corridor’s exit. Without the guidance of the Sentinel Guard, the Guardian Statues were like flies that lost their eyes. They ran around all over the place, completely unable to find Shi Feng.

More than a dozen minutes later, after getting rid of another three Sentinel Guards, Shi Feng finally escaped the Magic Corridor, arriving at the control room.

There was a barrier in the central region of the control room. A dark grey colored sphere of iron was placed inside the barrier. This sphere of iron was the heart of the Steel Fortress, and it was the fortress’ source of energy. It was the Titan’s Heart.

“I never thought that, after so many years have passed, there would still be somebody who would come to this place.”

Before Shi Feng could examine the entire control room in detail, he heard a deep sneer coming from the entrance of the barrier. This sound was bone-chilling, and no human was capable of producing such a sound. Only a puppet or a corpse would be capable of sounding so emotionless.

“Welcome to my Steel Fortress Barrutia! In order to celebrate your arrival, I’ve decided to use your fiery flesh and blood to feed my baby! Come out, Hellhound!”

Shi Feng could faintly see the outline of a humanoid lifeform inside the barrier. However, the figure seemed to be currently absorbing the energy of the Titan’s Heart, so it did not have surplus powers to deal with Shi Feng, sending out its pet in its stead.

“Ao! Ao! Ao!” A large black dog, its entire body covered in flames, rushed out from the barrier.

[Hellhound] (Elite-rank)

Level 15

HP 6,000/6,000

“Crap, did I come at a bad time?” Shi Feng’s brows slightly wrinkled as he observed the Hellhound. According to the information in his previous life, there were definitely no lifeforms or monsters in this place. The person that did the Quest was able to safely take the Titan’s Heart away. So, why was it that, when it was his turn to do the Quest, a mysterious character appeared here, trying to steal the Titan’s Heart’s energy.

However, Shi Feng also thought of another possibility.

This mysterious character stole all the energy of the Titan’s Heart first. Meanwhile, the player who came here had merely taken away the Titan’s Heart that was empty of any energy. On the other hand, Shi Feng had coincidentally run into this energy thief. However, unfortunately for Shi Feng, he wasn’t even capable of defeating the pet of this mysterious character, not to mention the person, itself.

“Since you want to battle, then come!” Shi Feng pulled out his swords, his attention affixed on the slowly approaching Hellhound.

As the Hellhound’s distance from him continuously shortened, Shi Feng could feel his surroundings become exceptionally hot, causing his mouth to feel parched. Shi Feng thought of taking out a Cold Beverage to enjoy, but he currently couldn’t carelessly move about. He would immediately reveal a weak point as soon as he moved. As a Level 15 Elite monster, the Hellhound’s intelligence was already extremely high. It was the reason why it leisurely walked towards Shi Feng.

That was because the Hellhound knew the best time for it to launch an attack. As long as Shi Feng revealed a gap, it would immediately bite at him with all its might, not letting go of Shi Feng until he was completely dead.

In the confrontation between the two, after all was said and done, the Hellhound was still the more powerful. So, naturally, it would not simply wait. Its legs immediately pushed against the ground, leaping high into the air and transforming into a ball of fire. It then opened its flaming maw.

Shi Feng rolled to a side, dodging the Hellhound’s pouncing attack.

However, immediately after the Hellhound landed, its flaming claws slashed horizontally.

Shi Feng had long since prepared for this, so he used both of his swords to Parry.

Peng! Although Shi Feng did not receive any damage, his entire body was thrown.

The Hellhound immediately opened its large mouth, spewing scorching-hot flames. The flames wrapped around Shi Feng completely, preventing him from escaping.

Shi Feng clenched his teeth. He used Phantom Kill, and at the moment of imminent peril, he swapped positions with his doppelganger in mid-air.

Shi Feng’s doppelganger was immediately swallowed by the flames, instantly turning into a pile of ash. Meanwhile, the System Notification showed a damage of up to -3,000. Even if Shi Feng were to take the hit with his HP full and all of his Life Shield[1] activated, he still wouldn’t be able to shoulder this attack.

Shi Feng clearly felt how powerful the Hellhound was. Such damage was definitely not something a Level 15 Elite monster could dish out. Its strength was greatly increased because of the Quest’s Story Line. According to his experience, Shi Feng estimated the Hellhound’s actual level to be over Level 30, and it should be a Lord-rank Boss.

If the pet were already this powerful, then what about its owner?

Seeing that the Hellhound’s flaming claws were about to slap down at him, Shi Feng used Abyssal Bind. Even if the Hellhound were any stronger, it would still be restricted for 3 seconds. Following which, Shi Feng rushed into the barrier at the center of the room. Currently, the best option Shi Feng possessed was to snatch the Titan’s Heart and swiftly depart.

However, just after entering the barrier, Shi Feng immediately became shocked upon seeing this mysterious person’s true identity.

“Dark Clown!” Shi Feng immediately recognized the identity of this mysterious character. His heart could not help but be surprised, “Why is such a bastard here?”
