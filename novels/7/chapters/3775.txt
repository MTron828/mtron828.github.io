Chapter 850 – Divine Songstress vs Sky Piercer

Flame Vein Holy City, Flame Vein Battle Arena:

As Red Frost and Heiser stepped into the ring, a primeval forest materialized around them, indicating the start of the match. The crowd outside the ring burst into excitement at this sight, and even the spectators in the VIP seating area quickly took their seats.

The VIP seating area was on the top floor of the Battle Arena. When the match began, the entire floor split into a hundred private rooms suspended above the ring. Occupants of these rooms could not only overlook the entire arena through the floor-to-ceiling windows but also watch the battle from a distance of 20 to 30 yards.

…

Dragon God Palace’s VIP Room:

“Vice Guild Leader Ember, is she your former rival?” a young man covered in dark gray bandages asked as he looked at Red Frost, who was currently equipped with a suit of white holy armor and wielded a crimson spear. “She doesn’t look like anything great. Aren’t you making a mountain out of a molehill by coming here in person?”

If the occupants of the other VIP rooms could hear how the young man spoke to Ember Dragon, they would be frightened. They would also assume his life would be forfeited.

Ember Dragon was the First Vice Guild Leader of the Dragon God Palace, one of the Nine Great Pseudo-Apex Powers. He was also one of the Divine Glory List’s top ten experts. Few people in the Greater God’s Domain would dare criticize him. Even the Dragon God Palace’s Guild Leader had to behave politely when dealing with Ember Dragon. Yet, the young man covered in bandages openly criticized him.

However, the bandage-wearing young man’s behavior did not arouse any reaction from the dozen or so Dragon God Palace members present. Even Ember Dragon himself did not show the slightest hint of displeasure. Instead, he maintained a calm expression, behaving like this situation was normal.

“How can she possibly be my rival?” After glancing at Red Frost, Ember Dragon said, “Even if she has fully recovered, I can still defeat her in a few moves under the same Basic Attributes. I only came here this time to check on Heiser.”

“Is that little girl strong?” the bandage-wearing young man asked, feeling a little surprised when he saw Ember Dragon looking at Heiser with a serious expression.

“Right now? Not at all. Under the same Basic Attributes, I am confident I can kill her in 50 moves,” Ember Dragon said, shaking his head. Then, he continued in a serious tone, “But her growth rate is incredible. She conceptualized an Advanced Gold Combat Technique two weeks ago. I estimate she might even reach the Half-step Mortal God standard in a month and become qualified to join us!”

“A teenage Half-step Mortal God?” The bandage-wearing young man also started to look at Heiser seriously after hearing Ember Dragon’s evaluation.

Achieving the Half-step Mortal God standard wasn’t a big deal for those in their group. However, it was a big deal to achieve it before twenty years old.

If such a talent was properly nurtured, they might just be able to reach the legendary Mortal God standard.

…

While Ember Dragon and the bandage-wearing youth conversed, Heiser and Red Frost met in the primeval forest and stood one hundred yards apart.

“So, you are the former number one that Leaf told me about,” Heiser said, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes as she scrutinized Red Frost. “I shouldn’t expect anything less from a genius the old commander and the others admire. Even though your soul is still weakened, you give me the same feeling as those in the Divine Glory List’s top 30. I can’t imagine how strong you were at your peak.”

Heiser’s words immediately shocked everyone in the audience.

“What?! Red Frost can rival the Divine Glory List’s top 30, even though she’s not at her peak?!”

“No wonder she used to be labeled the most talented genius Holy Dragon Spear has seen in the past few centuries.”

Many among the audience looked at Red Frost in surprise and admiration. Although Heiser’s assertion sounded far-fetched, nobody doubted her.

Divine Songstress Heiser!

This name had long spread to all corners of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary. After all, Heiser was publicly acknowledged as the most talented genius the Holy Dragon Spear adventurer team and the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary had seen in the past few centuries. Thus, nobody had any reason to doubt Heiser’s evaluation.

“You’re not half bad, either,” Red Frost said, smiling. “You’ve already reached the Half-step Mortal God standard at such a young age. You can definitely be considered one of the best among the younger generation.”

Red Frost’s response immediately stirred up the audience once more.

“A Half-step Mortal God?!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Impossible! How can Heiser be a Half-step Mortal God already?!”

“A Half-step Mortal God? Isn’t that the realm few people in the Greater God’s Domain have reached?”

“Heavens! Am I dreaming? Aren’t we supposed to be the same age? How is Heiser a Half-step Mortal God already when I reached the Domain Realm only recently?”

Many youths in the audience felt like they were losing their minds right now. In the Greater God’s Domain, those who could reach the Domain Realm by 20 would already be considered rare geniuses, while those who could reach the fifth-floor standard by 20 would be given the chosen one treatment by apex powers.

As for the Half-step Mortal God standard, it was a realm that many older-generation monsters could only dream of achieving.

Yet, they were now being told that Heiser had reached it already!

…

Besides the general audience, the various executives occupying the VIP rooms also stared at Heiser in disbelief.

“She isn’t denying it?”

“A monster! She’s a monster! How can anyone become a Half-step Mortal God before twenty?!”

“Has Holy Dragon Spear’s time to shine finally come?”

Let alone the members of the younger generation, most of the old monsters of the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary’s eight pseudo-apex powers hadn’t even reached the Half-step Mortal God standard yet. After all, even the task of developing Gold Combat Techniques was already incredibly challenging, what more developing Advanced Gold Combat Techniques?

It’s over! It’s all over for us! A Half-step Mortal God! How can she be a Half-step Mortal God already?! Despair colored Xiao Yilong’s face as he looked at Heiser.

As a prominent expert in the Primordial Dragon Sanctuary, Xiao Yilong knew how much time and effort was required just to learn a set of Advanced Gold Combat Techniques. As for self-developed techniques, he had just barely reached the threshold of developing Gold Combat Techniques. He didn’t even dare to think about developing Advanced Gold Combat Techniques in his current state.

In God’s Domain, there was a huge gap between players who had learned the Advanced Gold Combat Techniques of others and players who had developed their own Advanced Gold Combat Techniques. It was especially so after the major system update. Just the difference in Stamina and Concentration consumption was like night and day.

…

“Didn’t you say she only conceptualized an Advanced Gold Combat Technique two weeks ago?” the bandage-wearing young man asked as he looked at Ember Dragon. “How is she a Half-step Mortal God already?”

There was a huge difference between conceptualizing an Advanced Gold Combat Technique and coming up with a finished product. Many talented geniuses would find themselves stuck at this step. Even if a person could ultimately succeed, it would typically take them several months to complete an Advanced Gold Combat Technique.

If Heiser managed to develop her own Advanced Gold Combat Techniques in just two weeks, words such as genius and monster would no longer suffice to describe her.
