Chapter 452 – Combat-Ranked Secret Treasure

Since when did Gravel and Executioner get so powerful?! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Unrestrained Lionheart was greatly shocked and confused when he saw the two tanks causing nearly 100 million damage each to the two Devouring Earth Dragons.

Despite being defense-focused classes, the two Tier 5 tanks named Gravel and Executioner had caused close to 100 million damage to the Devouring Earth Dragons. This situation made Unrestrained Lionheart, a Tier 5 Grand Wizard, start to question life.

After all, the Legendary-ranked Devouring Earth Dragons were probably close to rivaling Tier 5 Dragons in Defense. Based on his experience fighting the Eternal Realm’s monsters, Unrestrained Lionheart doubted he could cause over 30 million damage to the Earth Dragons, even if he blasted them with a twofold Tier 5 Spell. Yet, the two Tier 5 tanks managed to triple that amount.

How did those two do it?

White Owl, who was observing the situation from nearby, also found this development mind-blowing.

She had fought against Tier 5 Legendary monsters in the Eternal Realm before. However, even as a Tier 5 Divine Rune Warrior, her attacks could only cause a little over 20 million damage. Moreover, this was only because she was fully equipped with a Fragmented Legendary Set and wielded the Legendary-ranked Starlight Greatsword. If she didn’t have these two things, she’d be fortunate if she could even cause 10 million damage to a Legendary monster.

While everyone on the team was feeling confused and excited, the other tanks also started to land their respective attacks on the Devouring Earth Dragons.

-61,465,411!

-64,641,542!

…

A series of damage values exceeding 60 million appeared above the two Devouring Earth Dragons’ heads. Although the other tanks’ attacks were not as powerful as the two fifth-floor experts, the damage they caused was still enough to make it look as if the two Devouring Earth Dragons were fake. For a moment, everyone on the team couldn’t help but be frightened by this situation.

“Could this be the effect of that Compounding Potion?”

When Frey saw the damage caused by the Tier 5 tanks’ attacks, she quickly recalled the confidence Shi Feng previously showed.

Before, what worried her the most was the team’s lack of damage. Even if they could withstand the Earth Dragons’ attacks, they would ultimately die from exhaustion if they couldn’t kill the Earth Dragons fast enough.

Yet, Shi Feng reacted calmly to this concern. It meant that he was never concerned that the team might not have enough damage.

“Yes, this is the Compounding Potion’s effect,” Shi Feng said, nodding and smiling. “With this, you can rest assured now, right?”

The reason Shi Feng wasn’t worried whether they could successfully raid the World Mode Courtyard of Space was mainly the Compounding Potion. Under the potion’s effects, players could ignore a portion of their opponents’ Holy Power Protection and strengthen their Mana. These effects allowed players to cause as much damage as they normally would against monsters outside the Eternal Realm.

Tanking the monsters in the Dungeon also shouldn’t be a problem. After all, the team was composed of experts at the titled standard and above. And with his knowledge of the Dungeon, completing the Dungeon shouldn’t be a huge challenge.

“Do you have more of this potion?” When Frey heard Shi Feng’s words, she couldn’t help but look at him with glowing eyes. “I want to buy them in bulk. No, I’ll take everything you have.”

The most troublesome aspect of fighting the Eternal Realm’s monsters was the Holy Power Protection. This buff prevented players from doing damage normally.

However, the Compounding Potion perfectly negated this buff. If players had the Compounding Potion’s assistance, it would be of significant help to them in grinding, exploring, and raiding.

When Shi Feng saw Frey’s expectant gaze, he couldn’t help but chuckle and said, “Miss Frey, these Compounding Potions aren’t cabbages. Not only are they expensive, but they are also limited in quantity. I don’t have many left after deducting the ones I distributed to the team.”

The Compounding Potion was a precious treasure during the Eternal Realm’s exploration stage. This was because the various towns’ Adventurer’s Associations only sold 300 bottles a day.

If he wanted to have an easier time exploring the Eternal Realm’s various maps in the future, it was a must for him to stockpile Compounding Potions while he still could. Otherwise, once other players in the Eternal Realm took notice of the potion, it would become incredibly difficult to get his hands on it.

When Frey saw that Shi Feng was reluctant to sell her the Compounding Potion, she smiled and said, “I’ll buy 100 bottles at one Eternal Silver per bottle.”

One Eternal Silver per bottle??Shi Feng couldn’t help but be astonished by Frey’s generosity.

Even one Eternal Silver was a fortune to most experts in the current Eternal Realm.

As far as he could remember, even though the Compounding Potion had a high resale value due to its high demand, the highest the potion had ever gone for was 50 Eternal Copper. Beyond that price, most players would rather buy Holy Power Bottle instead. The Holy Power Bottle might not be as effective as the Compounding Potion, but it could still let players ignore a significant portion of the Holy Power Protection’s effects. It was also much cheaper and available in unlimited supply.

“This is already a very generous offer. I doubt you will find anyone offering you a better price in the two nearby towns,” Frey said, growing a little anxious when she saw Shi Feng’s expression remaining indifferent. “Other powers might be able to offer a higher price per bottle, but they don’t have the capital to buy 100 bottles.”

“Okay. We’ll make the trade once we are out of the Dungeon,” Shi Feng said after pretending to think over the offer for a moment. Although he wanted to stock up on Compounding Potions, opportunities to earn nine Eternal Gold were few and far between during the Eternal Realm’s early exploration stages. If he could get his hands on such significant capital, he’d be able to accomplish many more things.

By the time Shi Feng and Frey reached an agreement, Gravel and Executioner had also successfully lured the two Devouring Earth Dragons far away from the rest of the team. Following this, the team began bombarding the Earth Dragon tanked by Desolate Fury.

Subsequently, the Devouring Earth Dragon began losing HP in the dozens of millions. Occasionally, it would even take a hit that plundered over 100 million of its HP. All of a sudden, the Earth Dragon that everyone previously thought was undefeatable, no longer looked as invincible as before.

In less than ten minutes, the first Devouring Earth Dragon fell.

Then, in less than half an hour, all three Devouring Earth Dragons were handily defeated, their deaths contributing a huge amount of EXP to Shi Feng and the others. Although Shi Feng’s experience bar didn’t even budge due to the God of Time’s curse, many people on the team saw their levels increase from 140 to 141.

Meanwhile, along with the third Devouring Earth Dragon’s fall, everyone in the team couldn’t help but fall into a momentary daze.

“Are these really Legendary-ranked Earth Dragons? Why does it feel like I just killed some small fries?”

“This Compounding Potion is just too good. Using it makes me feel like I’m cheating. It’d be great if I could also use this potion for grinding.”

“Dream on. A potion with such a powerful effect must be very valuable. Who would let you use it to grind?”

“I wonder how Vice Guild Leader Moro will react if he learns about the Compounding Potion? Do you guys think he’ll get a stroke?”

…

Apart from feeling delighted, everyone felt a strong desire for the Compounding Potion after defeating three Legendary-ranked Devouring Earth Dragons so easily.

However, after everyone was done marveling at the Compounding Potion’s effects, a strong sense of disappointment filled them when they saw the Devouring Earth Dragons’ loot.

For the first two Devouring Earth Dragons they killed, the monsters only dropped two silver chests filled with coins and nothing else. The stinginess of the Earth Dragons was unprecedented in the Greater God’s Domain.

Fortunately, the third Devouring Earth Dragon had dropped a bronze sphere in addition to a silver coin chest.

“A Combat-ranked Secret Treasure?”

A flash of surprise appeared in Shi Feng’s eyes when he saw the bronze sphere.
