Chapter 312 – Asura Sword Emperor?

“No! Impossible!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lightning Chaser couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the three fourth-floor experts in the magic mirror collapsing to the ground.

Shi Feng had not only killed three fourth-floor experts in one move, but he had also done so without using any Skills or combat techniques. All he did was swing his sword.

Fourth-floor experts were not cabbages that could be found everywhere. They would be regarded as powerful experts in any city.

Unless there was an overwhelming gap in Basic Attributes, even titled experts would need to put in some effort to kill an ordinary fourth-floor expert. After all, experts of this caliber would have all factors within their immediate vicinity under their control. They could also make perfect predictions of their opponent’s attacks and take the necessary countermeasures. Unless they were targeted by a powerful AOE attack that couldn’t be dodged, there was no way they could be killed instantly.

Yet, three fourth-floor experts were killed by Shi Feng, an ant who didn’t have a Golden Leaf Emblem, with only one slash. Even dreams would be more believable than this situation.

This situation was so unbelievable that Lightning Chaser couldn’t help but suspect if the three fourth-floor youths were paid actors. Otherwise, why would they stand still and do nothing as Shi Feng killed them?

Lightning Chaser wasn’t the only person to have such thoughts. Many of the spectating participants in the plaza also thought as such. Aside from the three youths being actors hired by Shi Feng, they couldn’t think of any other reason to explain this bewildering situation.

While the spectators were speculating whether the three youths were paid actors hired by Shi Feng, the expression of the young male Assassin fighting Wu Xiaoxiao turned ashen as he looked at Shi Feng.

“He has a Tier 5 Physique?”

Although this Assassin youth spoke under his breath, his voice was conveyed clearly through the magic mirror, and his speculation shocked the spectating crowd.

“Tier 5 Physique? Could he have a piece of Legendary Equipment equipped?”

......

“No wonder! No wonder those three failed to even react! There’s no way Tier 4 players can keep up with a Tier 5 Physique’s reaction speed!”

“Legendary Equipment?! Could he be from an upper-ranking hegemonic power?”

Everyone participating in the Rookie Competition was a genius among the Ancient River Kingdom’s younger generation. Although they had yet to get promoted to Tier 5, they understood the significance of having a Tier 5 Physique.

Invincibility among Tier 4!

Indeed! This was true invincibility among Tier 4!

Players would see a huge improvement in various parameters for every tier they climbed in God’s Domain. It was especially true for their Physique.

The stronger a player’s Physique, the higher their reaction speed’s limit would be.

If one compared the reaction speed limits of an ordinary Tier 4 expert and a Tier 4 titled expert, the difference would only be about the same as the gap between the Tier 3 and Tier 4 standard, which was a relatively small gap. It was just that titled experts were much better at pushing their reaction speeds to their limit, with some even capable of keeping their reaction speed at maximum at all times. In contrast, ordinary Tier 4 experts couldn’t even push their reaction speeds to their limit. Hence, even after setting aside factors such as equipment and Basic Attributes, there was still a massive gap in combat performance between ordinary experts and titled experts.

However, the difference between having a Tier 4 Physique and a Tier 5 Physique would create a much bigger gap in reaction speeds.

It was basically a difference between one and two.

In the time it took a Tier 4 titled expert to execute one attack, a Tier 5 expert could execute two attacks. In other words, should the two clash, the Tier 4 titled expert would only be halfway to completing their defensive maneuver when the Tier 5 expert had already completed their attack. The Tier 4 titled expert’s body simply couldn’t keep up with the speed of the Tier 5 player’s attack.

Just this point alone made it impossible for most Tier 4 players to go up against Tier 5 players.

This was also why transcending tiers was such a difficult feat in God’s Domain.

If players wished to fight opponents of a higher tier in God’s Domain, especially at the higher tiers, they’d need to have a Legendary Weapon or Equipment. Either that or Hall of Fame-level Fragmented Legendary Equipment, at the very least. Otherwise, attempting such a challenge would be no different than committing suicide.

Dammit! He’s nothing but an ant who doesn’t even have a Golden Leaf Emblem! How can he have a piece of Legendary Equipment?! Lightning Chaser went mad with jealousy as he looked at Shi Feng in the magic mirror.

Legendary Weapons and Equipment served as foundations for the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers. They were so rare and precious that even the Tier 6 experts of hegemonic powers wouldn’t necessarily have one. So, how could an ant who couldn’t even conquer the World Tower’s fourth floor own one?

Even though Lightning Chaser had already become an official successor of the Extreme Eagle Corporation, the corporation would only assign a Legendary Weapon or Equipment to him after he had gotten promoted to Tier 5. He couldn’t get his hands on one at Tier 4 even if he wanted to.

After all, Legendary Weapons and Equipment were extremely precious. Any one of them could be used to create a powerhouse capable of transcending tiers. Only after players had reached Tier 5 could they adequately protect the Legendary Weapon and Equipment they owned.

Apart from upper-ranking hegemonic powers, apex powers, and conglomerates, no other power would dare to put their Legendary Weapons and Equipment in the hands of a Tier 4 player.

While the spectating crowd was looking at Shi Feng enviously, Desolate Era, who had remained silent all this time, suddenly gasped.

“I remember now!” Desolate Era exclaimed in realization. “I remember where I heard Black Flame’s name from!”

“Commander?” Lightning Chaser looked at Desolate Fury in confusion, failing to understand what was going through the other party’s mind.

So what if Desolate Era had heard Black Flame’s name before?

Black Flame was now the number one target Lightning Chaser had to deal with. Not only because of Midsummer and Wu Xiaoxiao, but also because Legendary items were incredibly important to the Extreme Eagle Corporation. If he could get his hands on an additional piece, he would have two Legendary items in his possession once he got promoted to Tier 5. At that time, he would have a greater chance of becoming first in the corporation’s line of succession.

“I was wondering why I had such a deep impression of Black Flame’s name before, but now I know why,” Desolate Era said, a flash of awe appearing in his eyes as he looked at Shi Feng’s figure. “It’s because I happened to watch a recording of Black Flame fighting, and that recording was shown to me by none other than the empire’s number two paragon! He even showed great interest in Black Flame!”

“Are you joking with me, Commander? That paragon from the Paimon Conglomerate is interested in him?” Lightning Chaser was dumbfounded.

The paragon in question was a genius from the Paimon Conglomerate who had shocked the entire Myriad Forest Empire. Not only did he triumph over the various upper-ranking hegemonic powers’ young paragons, but he had also fought the Myriad Forest Empire’s publicly acknowledged number one monster to a standstill.

If it weren’t for the battlefield’s constantly shrinking size putting the Paimon Conglomerate’s paragon at a disadvantage, he wouldn’t necessarily be in second place right now.

“I’m not joking,” Desolate Fury said, shaking his head. Then, with admiration, he continued, “Brother Black Flame had outperformed the Paimon Conglomerate’s Meteor in the video. Moreover, in the Miniature Ancient World that the Starlight Realm’s various hegemonic powers and even conglomerates have chosen to invest in, Brother Black Flame is known as the Asura Sword Emperor and currently ranks seventh on the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s God List. He is much stronger than even the Twin Saints Alliance’s Saint Nine.”
