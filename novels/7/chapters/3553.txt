Chapter 628 – Queen’s Fall

“No problem. If you can return to the Crystal City, you can head to Zero Wing’s Residence to collect 10,000 Eternal Gold today,” Shi Feng said, nodding and smiling. “Zero Wing will also deliver you at least 50,000 Eternal Gold every day after today, ensuring that you will receive 300,000 Eternal Gold within a week.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although Zero Wing currently only possessed about 4,000 Eternal Gold, so long as they sold some of the Guild’s Combat Secret Treasures, they could accumulate 10,000 Eternal Gold in no time.

Doing so wouldn’t affect the Guild’s operations either, as he and his team had obtained many Mana Purification Techniques and Secret Treasures while they were grinding in the Nameless City. Currently, just the Combat Secret Treasures they had numbered over 1,000 already, while their Common Secret Treasures numbered nearly 10,000. Moreover, some of these Combat and Common Secret Treasures came in sets that could be sold at a much higher price than individual pieces.

Honestly, should he choose to sell all of these Secret Treasures immediately, he could probably get Billowing Water the 300,000 Eternal Gold she needed before the end of the day. However, to avoid affecting the market value of Secret Treasures, he decided it would be better to sell the Secret Treasures in batches and let the Crystal City’s inhabitants digest them slowly.

“Okay! I’ll head over to Zero Wing’s Residence to sign the contract right away.”

Billowing Water sighed in relief when she heard Shi Feng’s answer. Out of all the powers she was closely acquainted with, none could take out 300,000 Eternal Gold within a week. She had only sought out Zero Wing’s help as a last resort. After all, if she were to ask for help from a power she wasn’t familiar with, she would risk exposing her possession of a City Building Order.

The value of a City Building Order in the current Eternal Realm was enough for even pseudo-apex powers to disregard their reputation. At that time, she might not even be able to protect her City Building Order, let alone use it in a transaction.

“I’ll have someone trustworthy contact you and make sure no third parties will learn of our transaction,” Shi Feng assured while suppressing the excitement in his heart. Then, afraid that something unexpected might happen over on Billowing Water’s side, after disconnecting the call, Shi Feng promptly opened a World-Breaking Gate next to him and had Hidden Soul return to the Crystal City with all of the Secret Treasures in his bag. He also had Hidden Soul conceal her identity while selling the Secret Treasures and dealing with Billowing Water.

A City Building Order for the Western Continent!

The current Eternal Realm was still in its infancy. Whether it was the human race or the Holy Race, neither side possessed any Tier 6 players in the Eternal Realm. In such a situation, it would be incredibly difficult for either side to take down a well-prepared Guild City. Meanwhile, once a Guild City was allowed to settle down and develop, the difficulty of destroying it would rapidly increase over time.

So long as Zero Wing could get its hands on Billowing Water’s City Building Order, the Guild’s influence in the Eternal Realm would immediately rise to a new height. It was especially so now that many powers had already learned of the Western Continent’s existence. Soon, many players from the Eternal Continent would be looking to enter the Western Continent. Meanwhile, if these players wished to operate on the Western Continent long-term, they would need to have a place settlement they could operate from.

Although the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s Seven Luminaries Town existed, Guild Towns and Guild Cities were two entirely different concepts. Apart from providing players a place to rest, a Guild Town’s private houses offered no other functions.

In comparison, a Guild City’s private houses allowed players to bind with the house’s teleportation array and, so long as they weren’t attempting cross-realm teleportation, teleport back to their houses directly. By doing so, they would also get to avoid paying the city’s entrance fee. They could even use this teleportation feature to teleport out of certain maps that prohibited teleportation.

Meanwhile, in the Eternal Realm where NPC Cities did not possess teleportation arrays, the teleportation feature of private houses was invaluable. It was especially so for humans operating on the Western Continent, as human players would be forcibly teleported back to the Eternal Continent when they died on the Western Continent. If these players wanted to return to the Western Continent, they would have to pay a teleportation fee of 150 Eternal Gold. Such a price was unbearable even for the executives of pseudo-apex powers, let alone other players.

However, if players owned a private house in a Guild City located on the Western Continent, they could teleport from the Eternal Continent to their house on the Western Continent, saving them the exorbitant intercontinental teleportation fee. Hence, if given the opportunity, many players would be more than willing to pay a significant upfront fee to buy or rent a private house on the Western Continent.

So long as Zero Wing could construct a Guild City on the Western Continent, it could make a fortune simply by collecting rent on the city’s private houses, and its income would absolutely exceed the various NPC Cities. In the future, the city’s revenue might even match the total income of a fully developed pseudo-apex power in the Eternal Realm.

Meanwhile, after Hidden Soul left, Shi Feng continued grinding down the Gorgon Queen’s HP with everyone.

Even though the Gorgon Queen was heavily injured, it was still a challenge to deplete its massive HP pool of four trillion.

Fortunately, Azure Shadow and the other Night Watch battle group members were Tier 6 players who had learned the Bronze Mana Purification Technique. In addition, they had also consumed an Eternal God Crystal, so whether it was their combat standard or mastery over their Skills and Spells, both were rapidly improving throughout the battle. This, in turn, increased the damage they dealt to the Gorgon Queen.

Azure Shadow’s improvements were especially apparent. After attacking the heavily injured Gorgon Queen for half an hour, he successfully stepped into the Extrasensory Realm and became a bona fide fifth-floor expert. As a result, his damage output experienced a qualitative transformation.

Furthermore, roughly ten minutes later, Gentle Snow, Wordless Ember, and Sleeping Quicksand had similarly reached the Extrasensory Realm one after another. Now, even in the Eternal Realm, they could be considered experts standing at the apex.

“Everyone, increase your damage output! We only have five more minutes before the Gorgon Queen recovers!” Shi Feng said when he saw that the Gorgon Queen still had 14% of her HP remaining.

Although he could still heavily injure the Gorgon Queen by summoning Kalisha’s phantom again, every summon he wasted would increase the risks he had to face when the Evil Demon’s Shadows came for him later. Unless absolutely necessary, he did not wish to summon Kalisha’s phantom for a second time.

Holy Mana’s Shadow!

World of Frost!

Suddenly, Shi Feng’s frame increased to twenty meters, and the aura he radiated skyrocketed in intensity. Then, he executed Sword’s Orbit with the twenty-one frost swords he summoned and bombarded the Gorgon Queen with attacks comparable to Azure Shadow’s.

The participation of the twenty-one frost swords was akin to a sudden addition of twenty-one Tier 6 experts to the battlefield. Immediately, the Gorgon Queen’s HP started to decrease at a much greater rate.

14％… 10％… 5％…

When the Gorgon Queen’s HP fell to 1%, the Gorgon Queen fully recovered from her heavily injured state. As if having expected this, the Gorgon Queen promptly launched countless mental blades at her surroundings, instantly annihilating every Tier 5 player except for Shi Feng. Immediately afterward, the Gorgon Queen silent-cast a Chaos Spear and used it to obliterate Growling Potato.

“Die!”

When Shi Feng saw the Gorgon Queen eliminating one of their Tier 6 tanks, he gritted his teeth and executed Dark Moon using a combination of three frost swords. Then, relying on the Eternal God Crystal’s Concentration boost, he consecutively executed the Goddess-ranked Mana Technique three times.

-37,067,064,246!

-36,198,718,458!

-36,815,715,419!

Three damage values exceeding even the highest damage caused by the Tier 6 War Goddess appeared above the Gorgon Queen’s head, instantly depleting the Primordial Godkin’s remaining HP.
