Chapter 867 – Godlike Party

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

Apocalyptic lightning bolts rained down on Fira. Sensing the danger they posed to her, she promptly cast a Tier 6 Defensive Spell, creating a magic barrier around herself. However, despite her best efforts, her magic barrier shattered after blocking seven lightning bolts; the eighth lightning bolt turned her into a charred corpse.

At a glance, Heiser’s attack did not seem sensational, affecting only a radius of several dozen yards. Even so, it petrified everyone outside Shi Feng’s party and created an eerie silence.

“The Vice Guild Leader…is dead?”

“The Vice Guild Leader got killed…just like that?”

“What did she do?!”

…

The White Dragon Nation’s members could not process what just happened. They all stared at Heiser with confusion in their eyes.

It all happened too quickly!

In merely an instant, Heiser had cast nine instances of a Tier 6 Spell!

They had never seen or heard of such a feat before!

Despite being known as the Elemental God in Nightmare Holy City, Fira could, at most, instant-cast six instances of a Tier 6 Spell. Even so, this already allowed her to be nigh-invincible in Nightmare Holy City.

Yet, Heiser had completed a ninefold Tier 6 Spell… Was this something a human should be capable of?

Not to mention, Heiser had overpowered Fira and killed her in the first exchange…

“Fira’s dead…”

“How is this possible?! That’s Fira we are talking about! Although she doesn’t rank among the top 10 in Nightmare Holy City, she is still among the top 20! How can anyone overpower her to such an extent?!”

“Besides Kowloon Demon, the Holy City’s number one expert, I can’t think of anyone else who can accomplish such a feat…

“Commander, do you know this person?”

Pale Horn’s members were similarly filled with disbelief. After all, Fira, one of Nightmare Holy City’s top 20 experts, had just been one-shotted. Moreover, the player responsible for her death was even ten levels beneath her. If this news were to spread, it would shock the entire Holy City.

Whirlwind Bulwark stared at Heiser in a daze as he quickly ran her face through his memories, trying to find a match with Nightmare Holy City’s experts. As for Heiser being an expert from outside Nightmare Holy City, he didn’t even entertain the possibility. After all, Nightmare Holy City was the only place known to be safe for humans.

This was also why everyone operating in Nightmare Holy City greatly feared the White Dragon Nation and the Holy Knights.

However, none of the experts Whirlwind Bulwark had met in Nightmare Holy City resembled Heiser. Although Leia, the sixth-ranked player in Nightmare Holy City, was also a female elf like Heiser, she was a Swordsman. Thus, the chances of Heiser being Leia in disguise were zero.

“I don’t know her, but we should get ready to break out of this encirclement,” Whirlwind Bulwark said through the team chat.

Now that Fira was dead, the White Dragon Nation’s experts no longer had a leader. This undoubtedly made it easier for their team and Shi Feng’s party to escape. Not to mention, they had an expert like Heiser fighting on their side.

Elementalists were known to be humanoid artillery. Heiser should have no trouble blowing a path for them.

As Whirlwind Bulwark finished speaking, the White Dragon Nation’s members also started to snap out of their daze. Immediately, they put aside their fear of Heiser and rushed at her en masse.

Admittedly, Heiser’s ability to one-shot Fira was terrifying. However, there was ultimately a limit to a person’s reaction speed. Any Tier 6 expert would lose when attacked by several dozen Tier 6 experts, let alone 200-plus Tier 6 experts.

“Die!”

“How dare you kill our Vice Guild Leader! All of you must die today!”

The White Dragon Nation’s 200-plus experts charged at Heiser as one, completely ignoring Whirlwind Bulwark and the others. This was because they knew that if they allowed news of what happened here today to reach Nightmare Holy City, none of them would have a place in the Holy City in the future.

It should be known that they were the elites of the White Dragon Nation. Each of them was a fifth-floor expert who had mastered several Gold Combat Techniques. Their equipment standards were also top-notch in Nightmare Holy City. If more than 200 of them working together couldn’t even kill a Level 227 Elementalist, they would be too embarrassed to show their faces in public.

In the blink of an eye, numerous Tier 6 Skills and Spells bombarded Heiser from all directions, making dodging impossible. Whirlwind Bulwark’s heart sank when he saw this. He never expected the White Dragon Nation’s members to shamelessly throw their strongest attacks at Heiser. Even a Guardian Knight like himself would not be able to defend against all these attacks. Moreover, even if he did catch them all with his shield, the residual damage would be more than enough to kill him from full HP…

This was the advantage of numbers. Even if the White Dragon Nation’s members were inferior to him in combat standards, several dozen of them working together could kill him with ease.

However, a second later, Heiser cast Tier 6 Defensive Curses one after another, instantly completing a threefold Tier 6 Curse and creating a triple-stacked barrier that isolated her from the rest of the world. Additionally, unlike Fira’s magic barrier, Heiser’s magic barrier did not outright block the attacks that struck it. Instead, it deflected the attacks, minimizing its energy consumption.

Peak Gold Combat Technique, Triple Samsara!

No matter how many attacks struck the barrier, none reached Heiser. Even after the initial round of bombardment ended, the barrier still had plenty of mana remaining. Naturally, Heiser never lost any HP.

“Did she just…instant-cast a threefold Tier 6 Curse?”

The White Dragon Nation’s members were dumbfounded.

“How is this possible?!”

Whirlwind Bulwark and the other Pale Horn members were similarly stunned.

Although they had seen others instant-casting Tier 6 Defensive Curses before, they had never seen anyone instant-casting a threefold Tier 6 Curse, much less single-handedly blocking the attacks of over 200 Level 230-plus experts. With such strength, Heiser could already be described as a humanoid fortress. They couldn’t even begin to imagine how terrifying Heiser’s Basic Attributes were for her to remain unscathed after receiving the attacks of so many players.

“Everyone! Don’t be scared of her! Executing such a combat technique must put a huge strain on her Concentration! I refuse to believe she can keep it up for long!” one of the White Dragon Nation’s members shouted.

The other White Dragon Nation members nodded in agreement. The more powerful a combat technique was, the greater its burden on the user’s Stamina and Concentration. Immediately, they started the next round of bombardment.

“Aren’t you guys going to make a move?” Ignoring the White Dragon Nation’s members, Heiser turned to Shi Feng and the others and said, “I’ll be taking these people’s lives for myself if you all keep standing there.”

When the White Dragon Nation’s members started another round of attacks, Whirlwind Bulwark and his team originally wanted to assist Heiser. However, her words gave them pause.

It sounded like she was confident she could eradicate the White Dragon Nation’s 200-plus experts by herself. Although it sounded like a joke, when Whirlwind Bulwark and his team saw the calm expressions of Shi Feng and his party, they couldn’t help but wonder if it really was a joke.

“Since you’re offering, I’ll use them for practice, then,” Red Frost said, itching to take action after hearing Heiser’s invitation.

The moment they arrived in this remnant of a primordial world, they experienced a World Suppression of unprecedented strength. Hence, it was necessary to let their bodies adapt to this new level of suppression. They had refrained from making a move thus far only because they wanted to see how strong exactly the White Dragon Nation’s Level 230-plus experts were. Otherwise, they would have taken action the moment Heiser killed Fira.

After Red Frost finished speaking, she vanished and reappeared in the middle of the White Dragon Nation’s members, her Divine Spear jutting out of a Level 233 Shield Warrior’s back. Immediately afterward, she stomped on the ground and turned her surroundings into a sea of flames.

Advanced Gold Fusion Technique, Flame Dragon Dance!

With a thrust of her spear, Red Frost skewered over 30 melee experts, killing them on the spot. Her display of strength was even more terrifying than Heiser’s…

“Is she really human?” Whirlwind Bulwark’s pupils dilated at this sight.

The White Dragon Nation’s melee experts were by no means mediocre. Any of them could withstand attacks from a Divine monster of the same level. Yet, Red Frost moved so quickly that she completely overwhelmed their senses. Additionally, she could pinpoint and strike their defensive blind spots with her every attack; from an outsider’s perspective, it looked like they were throwing themselves at her spear.

“It seems the equipment standard here isn’t the only thing different from the Greater God’s Domain. Their combat standards are also limited to the ordinary Gold standard.” Watching Red Frost and Heiser mow down the White Dragon Nation’s experts gave Shi Feng a general idea of the standards of the remnant primordial world’s players. Then, he stopped spectating and unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator. “Since we’re done collecting data, it’s time we put an end to this battle!”

Goddess-ranked Mana Technique, Dark Moon! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

With a swing of the Shadow Incinerator, Shi Feng instantly reduced several dozen fleeing members of the White Dragon Nation to ashes, leaving only their weapons and equipment behind…
