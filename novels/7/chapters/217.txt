Chapter 218 - Starstreak Trading Firm

After Shi Feng and Thoughtful Rain entered the Library...

Thoughtful Rain’s eyes flashed with a hint of shock when she saw the spectacular scene inside the Library.

The interior of the LIbrary was like something from a fantasy world. Countless documents and materials were displayed all around the Library, and a massive, transparent crystal globe occupied the center. This crystal globe was like a supercomputer; one could search for any information available pertaining to the Star-Moon Kingdom.

Meanwhile, numerous open-air meditation rooms made of Magic Crystals decorated the surroundings of the crystal globe. Inside these meditation rooms, players could either research new spells or practice using their current spells.

Normally, only Tier 3 and above mage classes would research new spells. The players at this stage of the game had yet to possess a deep understanding of magic, so researching new spells was out of the question for them. Moreover, the spells that players currently used were only entry-level spells. However, along with the increase in their levels, the spells they used would also grow more complex. If they did not possess a specific degree of understanding of magic, they could stop dreaming of casting any high-tier spells.

As a result, many mages in God’s Domain had given up on their adventuring career, switching to a Lifestyle class instead.

In fact, magic wasn’t the only thing that had stringent requirements for players. It was the same for battle techniques. The more powerful a battle technique was, the higher its requirement would be of a player’s control over their body. As a result, this requirement had created a gap in strength between the players of God’s Domain. It was one of the reasons that some players could advance to a Tier 5 class, while some failed even to reach Tier 3.

Although it would be of some help if players increased their Levels and Attributes, such factors would make little difference the further players advanced in God’s Domain.

This was also the reason why God Tier powerhouses were so rare.

Thus, Shi Feng continuously trained his body day in and day out, in addition to spending a large number of Credits to purchase nutrient fluids to improve his body’s physique. It was all meant to improve his brain’s potential and performance. Only by developing his brain’s potential could he master his body in the game and obtain extraordinary battle prowess. He could then advance to a Tier 5 class and take the challenge to advance to the Tier 6 godhood, reaching the pinnacle of God’s Domain.

“Let’s part ways here; I still need to look for someone. If you want to learn high-level skills, the Tier 2 instructor over there can help you,” Shi Feng pointed towards a mage in white robes standing by the large crystal globe.

“Thank you,” Thoughtful Rain appeared slightly embarrassed as she expressed her gratitude. Originally, she had intended to help Shi Feng. Never would she have imagined that she would be the one who received help instead. She then said, “Seeing as you are so familiar with this place, are you perhaps a professional player?”

“I guess you can put it that way,” Shi Feng nodded.

“Let’s add each other as friends, then. I don’t normally play games, so I usually buy my game equipment from others. In the future, if I am looking to purchase equipment or do a quest, I can also look to you for some help.” Thoughtful Rain beamed a smile as she sent Shi Feng a friend request.

“That’s fine, but if you need help with a quest, it would be best if you contact me about it in advance,” Shi Feng accepted the friend request.

He did not think that, by coming here to do a quest, he would actually meet a potential female customer.

When his Workshop started its operations in the future, aside from raiding Dungeons to obtain equipment, they would also need to look for tycoons and various corporations for sponsorship. However, it was extremely difficult for an upstart Workshop to obtain sponsorship from a large corporation. Newly established Workshops usually depended on rich players who were willing to spend large sums of money. Only after becoming a large Guild would a Workshop attract the sponsorship of large Corporations.

Although Shi Feng’s Workshop had yet to start its operation officially, there was already one customer waiting at the front door. His luck was relatively good.

After Shi Feng left, Thoughtful Rain inspected Shi Feng’s ID.

“Oh? He is Ye Feng, White River City’s number one expert?”

As Shi Feng had kept his ID hidden, it was only revealed after Shi Feng accepted her friend request.

Although Thoughtful Rain was not a gaming expert, having a poor understanding of the gaming world, Shi Feng’s fame had long since shaken the White River City region. He had also received many titles such as White River City’s number one independent player, god-ranked expert, and so on.

Furthermore, Shi Feng had also personally penned the luxury version of the White River City Guidebook she had bought. So, how could she not know who Shi Feng was?

“No wonder why I thought he looked familiar. It turns out that he is Ye Feng. This looks interesting.” Thoughtful Rain’s bright red lips slightly lifted upwards as she lost herself in her own thoughts.

On the Library’s uppermost floor, Star-Moon Hall...

Several Level 180 Tier 1 Knights stood guard outside of Star-Moon Hall. These Knights wore rigid expressions. Under normal circumstances, even normal nobles were not allowed into the Star-Moon Hall. However, these Knights did not stop Shi Feng this time.

On the contrary, they immediately parted the crystal doors for Shi Feng upon his arrival.

“I’ve been bitterly waiting for you for so long; why have you only decided to come now?” Sharlyn asked, smiling sweetly from her seat next to a shiny, stone table. The woman currently wore a set of pure white, magical robes. The delicate and luxurious robes radiated a faint silvery glow, making Sharlyn appear as though she were a flawless noble saint. She crossed one thigh over the other, revealing fair, supple skin. It was almost as if Sharlyn was trying to toy with Shi Feng.

At this moment, Sharlyn was no longer a Level 20 Tier 3 Divine Official, but a Level 180 Tier 3 Divine Official. Aside from the few Tier 4 tyrants, Sharlyn could very well be considered the most powerful person in White River City.

“Why are you standing there, daydreaming? Come over here and sit! We have plenty of time to have a lengthy chat.” Sharlyn smiled faintly as she pointed towards the empty seat beside her. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Shi Feng instinctively shuddered when he faced a golddigger like Sharlyn. He felt as if he were being stared at by a nine-tailed fox, his wallet no longer safe.

However, to obtain the clue for the Epic Quest, Shi Feng had no choice but to advance, taking a seat beside Sharlyn.

Shi Feng took out 10 Gold Coins, placing them on the table. He then asked in a soft tone, “Esteemed Lady Sharlyn, I’ve brought the 10 Gold Coins you requested. I wonder if you can tell me the location of the Bible of Darkness now?”

Sharlyn made a slight waving motion and the Gold Coins on the stone table immediately flew to her lily-white hand. Giggling, she played with the shiny Coins in her hand.

“I didn’t think that your moneymaking speed would be so fast. This big sister has truly underestimated you.” After storing the Gold Coins, Sharlyn unhurriedly said, “However, I now have a new piece of information. I wonder if you would be interested in hearing it? Moreover, this information is extremely accurate. It will definitely help you in locating the Bible of Darkness.”

Shi Feng’s lips involuntarily twitched at Sharlyn’s words.

She was going ask for more money!

“Say it. How much do you want?” Shi Feng truly felt regretful now. Due to the successful sales of Hard Stones, Shi Feng now had over 70 Gold Coins on his person. If he had known something like this would happen, he would have stored all his money in the Bank before coming to the Library.

However, there was also another possibility. Only when players possessed a certain amount of money could they trigger the revelation of new information. If so, without a doubt, Shi Feng had reached this goal.

“Not much; an additional 40 Gold Coins would be enough. Of course, you can choose not to listen to this new information. I’m not trying to belittle you, but with your current strength, it is impossible for you to locate the Bible of Darkness by relying on the old clue. Are you sure you don’t want to know this new clue?” Sharlyn blinked her eyes at Shi Feng, her body radiating a holy aura. Those affected by this aura would find it hard to refuse Sharlyn’s request.

A total of 50 Gold Coins.

At this moment, Shi Feng wanted to shout, “Why don’t you just rob me and be done with it?!”

However, Shi Feng endured it. As long as he could obtain the reward for the Epic Quest, spending 50 Gold Coins was nothing in comparison.

“Here is 40 Gold Coins.” Shi Feng ground his teeth as he placed another 40 Gold Coins on the stone table, forming a small, gold mountain.

Sharlyn’s eyes shone as she saw the small mountain of gold. After snagging the Gold Coins, she unhurriedly took out a letter and handed it to Shi Feng. She then said, “This is a contract for White River City’s Starstreak Trading Firm. As long as you bring this contract to President Henry, he will tell you how to reach the Dark Den.”
