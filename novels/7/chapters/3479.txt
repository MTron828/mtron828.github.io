Chapter 554 – Treasure Exchange

Thank you readers!

“While she is only a Basic Master Engineer right now, she is very talented, and it shouldn’t be difficult for her to become a Grandmaster Engineer in the future,” Aqua Rose awkwardly added when she saw the stunned look on Shi Feng’s face.

There were many Lifestyle classes in God’s Domain, and they allowed players to achieve prosperity in God’s Domain, even if they weren’t skilled in combat.

However, in the Greater God’s Domain, Lifestyle players would only be considered to have reached an entry-level after reaching the Master standard. It was especially so for the engineer subclass. While the various combat tools they produced were useful to low-tier players, they were mostly inconsequential to high-tier players. Even the tools produced by a Grandmaster Engineer for Tier 5 and Tier 6 players would pale in effectiveness compared to a potion produced by a Grandmaster Alchemist.

To make matters worse, engineers require a lot of resources to nurture. The cost of producing a Grandmaster Engineer was two or three times more than it would take to produce a Grandmaster of another subclass.

Because of these reasons, the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers were reluctant to nurture Engineers. It didn’t matter even if the Engineer player in question was very talented…

“Rest assured, Miss Aqua. I promise she will receive the best treatment in Zero Wing,” Shi Feng said, chuckling when he saw Aqua Rose’s awkwardness. “Moreover, I guarantee her future achievements will surpass your imagination.”

Silk Radish was known by all in his previous life. Her status in the Greater God’s Domain was so exalted that even the various apex powers wished to recruit her.

It was true that most engineers in the Greater God’s Domain were of little use to high-tier players. After all, the strongest combat tools that most engineers could produce could only reach the Tier 5 standard. They would be of little threat to Tier 5 players, let alone Tier 6 players.

However, Silk Radish wasn’t your average engineer. She was an engineer who had climbed to the Pseudo-Divine Craftsman rank in the Greater God’s Domain, and the combat tools she produced could shock even Primordial Gods.

Particularly, the Legendary Flying Ships she produced could scare even Ancient Gods into fleeing.

During Shi Feng’s previous life, some apex powers were willing to go to war with another apex power just to get a Legendary Flying Ship from Silk Radish. Silk Radish’s influence in the Greater God’s Domain was well above the influence of other Pseudo-Divine Craftsmen.

“That is good to hear,” Aqua Rose casually responded, simply taking Shi Feng’s words as pleasantries. Then, she handed the Gold Ancient Tome and Silk Radish’s contact information to Shi Feng, saying, “Here is my cousin’s information. I still can’t get in touch with her outside, but I believe the Green God Corporation will be holding its talent fair in Silver Frost City in a few days. I will have to trouble you when the time comes.”

“Okay, leave it to me,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to say anything else as he accepted the Gold Ancient Tome and Silk Radish’s information.

It was a fact that engineers did not have a favorable outlook in the current Greater God’s Domain, so his behavior of praising Silk Radish indeed looked perfunctory. After all, who could have imagined that a little girl would become a Pseudo-Divine Craftsman? And who could have imagined that the Greater God’s Domain’s various powers would start frantically nurturing engineers because of Silk Radish?

Meanwhile, after Shi Feng and Aqua Rose were done with their conversation, Seven Melody took the initiative to add Shi Feng as a friend. She even invited him to move his base of operations to Royal Eternal City, the most prosperous city in the current Eternal Realm.

Royal Eternal City was the only royal capital in the Eternal Realm. It wielded authority and unique functions that vastly surpassed other NPC Cities. Many pseudo-apex powers and apex powers have gathered there, and those without the backing of these powers couldn’t even establish a foothold in the city.

However, Shi Feng turned down Seven Melody’s sincere invitation. In regards to this, Seven Melody could only leave the Golden Spire disappointed with Aqua Rose and the others.

After Seven Melody left, Aurebeth couldn’t help but look at Shi Feng in confusion.

“Are you really going to offend Demon’s Gate just for a Gold Ancient Tome?” Aurebeth asked out of curiosity. “The people from Demon’s Gate are a bunch of lunatics. No matter how hard that woman tries to hide her cousin’s existence, Demon’s Gate’s people will eventually discover that little girl. Do you think it’s worth it?”

“For just a Gold Ancient Tome? Definitely not,” Shi Feng said, chuckling. “But if it’s for that little girl, I think it’s worth it.”

“It seems you are also a lunatic,” Aurebeth said, sighing. “But you have helped me a great deal this time. If you come across any trouble in the future, I can lend a hand once.”

After saying so, Aurebeth disappeared from the temple, leaving Shi Feng stunned. He never thought the Bloodsoaked Rakshasa would promise to help him once. This would have been an incredibly rare opportunity in his previous life.

However, Shi Feng didn’t dwell on the matter for long before he stepped into the exchange room.

Although he had already acquired a Gold Ancient Tome, plenty of other attractive items were still available in the Golden Spire’s treasury.

“Greetings, Sir. Here is your exchange list,” the mechanical puppet in the exchange room said as it handed Shi Feng a list. “According to the rules set by the Gods, you may exchange for only one item from this list.”

Shi Feng was familiar with the Golden Spire’s exchange rules, so he started browsing the list immediately.

Are these the available rewards for reaching the upper level’s 20,000-meter mark??Shi Feng couldn’t help but be shocked by the items listed.

The list not only contained the Gold Ancient Tome he needed, but it also contained many treasures that were very hard to come by in the outside world. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

For example, there were a total of 23 Gold Combat Technique Tablets available on the list. Not even the various apex powers possessed this many Golden Laws.

Aside from Golden Laws, Shi Feng could also choose from as many as eight Fragmented Divine Artifacts, fourteen God Guidances, and twenty-eight World Sources as his reward…

There were well over a thousand items Shi Feng had never heard of being available for exchange on the list, and every item could cause the Greater God’s Domain’s players to lose their minds. Even Shi Feng was not an exception.

A Goddess Armament?!

Shi Feng couldn’t help but gasp when he saw a striking name on the list.

Goddess Armament!

Also known as Fate’s Guidance!

There were only six instances of this item in the Greater God’s Domain, and every one of them had a chance of providing a female player with a full Divine Artifact Set.

Of course, the Divine Artifact Sets left behind by Goddesses were not so easy to obtain. While it was true that each Goddess Armament could become a complete Divine Artifact Set, whether players could obtain it was a different story.

Every Goddess Armament would put players through twelve trials. If players could pass all twelve trials, they would obtain a personalized Divine Weapon and the Goddess Armament Set, a six-piece Divine Artifact Set. However, if players failed to pass even one trial, they would forever lose the qualifications to rechallenge the trials.

Due to the Goddess Armaments’ potential, any power that got its hands on a Goddess Armament would treat it as its most prized possession and keep it safely guarded in the hopes that someone in their Guild could clear the twelve trials one day and become one of the strongest players in the Greater God’s Domain.

As far as Shi Feng was aware, a total of four Goddess Armaments were found in his previous life. Of them, three were acquired by apex powers, while one was acquired by the pseudo-apex power Azure Fang. However, even after obtaining the Goddess Armaments for many years, nobody from these four powers managed to obtain the Goddess Armament Set. This situation caused many people to think that the rumors surrounding the Goddess Armaments were false.

“Are you sure you wish to exchange for this item, Sir?” the mechanical puppet asked when it saw Shi Feng’s finger stopping on the Goddess Armament’s name. “You may not change your choice once you have confirmed your decision. You will also be unable to select any other treasures in your subsequent entries unless you reach the summit.”
