Chapter 2538 – Ten Saints Empire Shaken, Correct Decision

Ten Saints Empire, Heavenly Saint Capital City, Battle Wolves’ Residence:

A man in crimson armor and covered in illusory flames sat quietly before a crimson greatsword with his eyes closed in the top-floor lounge of a Guild Hall that was nearly 100 meters tall. Although this man didn’t make the slightest move, the sword and flames around it circled the man as if they had a life of their own. Divine runes began to appear in the air, one after another, attracting all of the ambient fire-type Mana and suffusing it with the man. As more Mana filled him, his aura grew more intense.

After a few seconds, the man’s aura was as intense as that of a Tier 4 being. He felt as he had transformed into a Fire Demon as brilliant flames filled the room.

If Shi Feng saw this, he’d certainly be surprised.

The man bathing in the Crimson Flames was none other than Sirius, one of Battle Wolves’ old monsters. Not only did Sirius command Tier 4 strength, but his control of fire-type Mana was also greater than Shi Feng’s who had mastered a Mana Technique. Sirius manipulated the Mana like an extension of his own body, with utter and delicate control. Now, he could even control the flow of different streams of fire-type Mana...

When Sirius finally reopened his eyes, the crimson fire around him took on a white-blue hue, and the room’s temperature instantly rose by several hundred degrees. Not even ordinary Tier 2 players could approach the man before they burned to death.

“I’ve finally finished absorbing this Fire Saint Bloodline. It’s about time I pay Demon City another visit,” Sirius said, smiling as he examined the blue divine runes on his arms.

During the battle in the Burning Forest, Demon’s Heart’s Vice Guild Leader, Flaming Light, had defeated him. He had initially given up hope of defeating Flaming Light anytime soon, but the Guild had been fortunate enough to find an extremely rare Advanced Bloodline—the Fire Saint Bloodline.

At first, he had assumed the Fire Saint Bloodline would only increase his strength by a fraction, but now that he had fully unified with it, he understood how terrifying it was. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was even confident that he could now barge into Demon City and walk out with his life, let alone exact his vengeance against Flaming Light.

As Sirius prepared to leave the lounge, however, a tall, middle-aged man with an imposing aura burst in. This man was Everlasting War, who had previously served as the Glorious Lions Battle Team’s leader.

“Commander, we’ve just received an update regarding Demon City. The report states that not only has Black Flame broken into the City, but he’s also slain Troubled Times, who had hidden within Demon’s Heart’s Residence...” Everlasting War announced.

“Troubled Times died inside Demon’s Heart’s Residence?” The news stunned Sirius, and for a moment, he wondered if he had misheard.

He was already amazed that Shi Feng had his team had made it to Demon City. Despite dispatching an army of over 100,000 experts, Battle Wolves hadn’t even caught a glimpse of the city’s gate.

But now, he learned that Shi Feng had broken into the city and killed Troubled Times within Demon’s Heart’s Residence. It was astounding!

“Demon’s Heart has lost most of its prestige in Demon City and now poses much less of a threat to the various superpowers. Should we still head to Demon City, Commander?” Everlasting War asked Sirius, who wore a strange expression.

News of Troubled Times’ death had already spread throughout the Ten Saints Empire. Keeping the matter under wraps was impossible for Demon’s Heart. Meanwhile, the situation had robbed Battle Wolves of the revenge it sought for the humiliation it had suffered. If the Guild targeted Demon’s Heart now, it would only earn the label of ‘bully,’ tarnishing the Guild’s reputation further.

“We no longer need to visit Demon City. Instead, we should visit Zero Wing,” Sirius said. “To achieve such a feat, Black Flame is indeed impressive. Unfortunately, Demon’s Heart isn’t a trivial opponent, and Flaming Light is particularly troublesome. If that weren’t the case, the Ten Saints Empire’s various superpowers would never have willingly allied with the Dark Guild.”

“Understood. I’ll take care of the necessary preparations,” Everlasting War said. After giving the matter some thought, he agreed with his commander’s decisions.

Two or three days ago, Everlasting War would’ve thought Zero Wing had just won a major victory, but based on what information Battle Wolves had gathered, Demon’s Heart had more power in Level 100 neutral maps than Zero Wing could imagine. All Shi Feng had done was yank on the tiger’s whiskers by tarnishing Demon’s Heart’s reputation. The act was both ignorant and foolish.

Meanwhile, all of the various superpowers that learned of Shi Feng’s accomplishments were similarly astonished. None of them had thought that Shi Feng would shake Demon City to its very foundations.

The Swordsman’s strength was simply inhuman!

Surprisingly, however, the Ten Saints Empire had remained extraordinarily calm despite the news. None of the various superpowers, which deeply hated Demon players, had shown any movement. Not one of them had tried to kick Demon City while it was down. Rather, the empire’s superpowers had sent a large number of experts to Zero Wing’s territories. This turn of events was indescribably strange.

“Have these superpowers gone mad, Vice Guild Leader? They’re not taking advantage of the situation to put pressure on Demon’s Heart and are aiming for Zero Wing instead...” the Tier 3 black-clad Assassin beside Illusory Words said after examining the details the Guild’s information network had gathered. “Did they miss the system announcement in the Burning Forest? The Demon players’ development speed in that area has substantially decreased. This is the perfect opportunity to strike.

“They haven’t gone crazy,” Illusory Words, who was busy sifting through the reports, replied, shaking her head. “They’ve only made the correct decision.”

“Correct decision?” The statement confused the Tier 3 Assassin. He didn’t understand what Illusory Words meant by that.

Since Shi Feng had destroyed Demon City’s defensive magic array, all of the city’s Demon players have suffered a 20% strength reduction. This was the best chance the various superpowers had to eliminate those Demon players.

Demon’s Heart had stopped the empire’s various superpowers from acquiring as many resources from Level 100 neutral maps. Those superpowers would only secure more if they suppressed the Dark Guild now.

“That’s right,” Illusory Words said, her lips twisting into a bitter smile. “Very few of the various superpowers’ members are aware of how frightening Demon’s Heart truly is. The Dark Guild has already allied with Mythology, one of the Five Great Super Powers. Both its overall strength and its foundations are far superior to Zero Wing’s. Naturally, the various superpowers want to take advantage of Zero Wing, not Demon’s Heart.”

“Demon’s Heart has actually partnered with Mythology?” Realization immediately dawned on the Tier 3 Assassin. He was also surprised by how formidable Demon’s Heart was.

Mythology was one of the five major titans in God’s Domain and far stronger than ordinary superpowers like Crimson Emperor. Ordinary Super Guilds couldn’t even compare. If Mythology were supporting Demon’s Heart, the Dark Guild wouldn’t have to worry about its development, even after the recent events.

While the Ten Saints Empire’s superpowers were busy attacking Zero Wing, a handsome man in white arrived at a Mana-rich location outside of the Fire Dragon Empire. This man was Flaming Light, Demon’s Heart’s famous Vice Guild Leader.

Not long after his arrival, two Level 107, Tier 3 peak experts intercepted him.

“What business do you have here?” a Tier 3 Shield Warrior demanded, flashing Flaming Light a contemptuous look.

“I have something I need to discuss with Vice Guild Leader Cold Shadow. May I know if she has time to spare?” Flaming Light cordially asked.
