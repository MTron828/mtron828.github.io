Chapter 316 - Shocking Star-Moon

The confrontation between Dark Star and Zero Wing had already become explosively popular on the forums.

Previously, using the name Black Flame, Shi Feng had declared that he would exact vengeance against Dark Star.

In response, those who knew of Dark Star’s strength were not optimistic about Zero Wing’s chances of success.

After all, everyone knew that Zero Wing had only recently established; it did not possess a significant background. However, Zero Wing was still the first Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom to possess a Guild Residence, so most considered it to have great potential. If it spent a few more months developing, it might become an existence that surpassed even Dark Star. At the moment, though, it was simply too early for Zero Wing to go against Dark Star.

Yet, sometime later, such remarks about Zero Wing completely disappeared.

World Dominators, veteran first-rate Guild, had actually suffered defeat. Moreover, the Guild had been eliminated from the competition for dominance over White River City. Zero Wing had played a significant role in achieving this feat, so it was apparent that Zero Wing was not as weak as everyone had imagined.

Hence, the moment the video of Shi Feng killing Dark Star’s Guild Leader, Lone Tyrant, uploaded, it’s popularity instantly grew.

In particular, the scene where Shi Feng indifferently faced off against an army of over a thousand elites and managed to kill Lone Tyrant by himself garnered huge amounts of attention.

Shi Feng’s actions made it seem as if killing the enemy commander while surrounded by an army as simple as taking something out of his pockets.

A scene that was only possible in storybooks had actually occurred in reality.

In the face of Shi Feng, the Guild Leader of Dark Star was like a little kid. Even as Lone Tyrant died, he had not offered the least bit of resistance. On the other hand, just a glance from Shi Feng caused the thousands of players of Dark Star to freeze in fright. At that time, Shi Feng was like a king. Before him, everybody else could only submit.

Also, the scene in which Shi Feng killed Ming Sha as he departed was even more amazing.

Anybody could tell at a glance that the Berserker, Ming Sha, was not just an ordinary expert. Yet, even so, Shi Feng killed him effortlessly. However, this did not mean that Ming Sha was weak. Instead, Shi Feng was simply too strong.

“This Black Flame is too powerful! With his skills, he can rank on the God’s Domain Experts List.”

“Not likely. That’s the God’s Domain Experts List you’re talking about. The Secret Pavilion has collected information on all experts in God’s Domain to compile that list and the God’s Domain experts that rank on it are all monsters. Previously, even though the god-ranked expert, Ye Feng, had killed over a hundred players all by himself, he still failed to earn a spot on that list.”

The Secret Pavilion was famous in the virtual gaming world, and one could find the Secret Pavilion’s presence in practically every virtual reality game available. The Experts List compiled by the Secret Pavilion was also well-received by many players. After all, by browsing through the Experts List, one could easily find information such as the major events that had occurred in God’s Domain, what kind of experts were present in the game, who the number one player was, and more. Players had no need to go through the trouble of searching for such information through the official forums. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Any player who managed earn a place on the Experts List was a target for recruitment of all of the major Workshops in the gaming industry.

Although nobody knew whether Black Flame was capable of ranking on the Experts List, undoubtedly, he had already earned his fame in Star-Moon Kingdom.

In the future, whenever people talked about Zero Wing, the first thing that would come to their minds would be Black Flame.

“Damn it! Damn that Black Flame!” Lone Tyrant burst into an uncontrollable rage when he discovered the video Shi Feng had uploaded.

His original plan to destroy Zero Wing had completely backfired, and instead, he became the laughingstock throughout Star-Moon Kingdom.

“Have we not found them yet?!” Lone Tyrant bellowed.

Dark Star had suffered a tremendous loss this time. Not only had it lost more than a thousand players to Zero Wing, but Dark Star’s fame and prestige had also been destroyed. Lone Tyrant’s reputation had gone up in flames. To make things worse, he still had to compensate World Dominators for its losses. The amount they had to pay would definitely put a dent in Dark Star’s funds, damaging the Guild’s development.

In this war, Dark Star had suffered a double loss]. However, Lone Tyrant was completely helpless about this situation.

“Guild Leader, we’ve already increased the number of people searching for them to 15,000. However, it’s as if they grew wings and flew away; even after rummaging through the entire Silverleaf Forest, we still can’t find any traces of Zero Wing. I suspect that they have long since left the Forest. Otherwise, if Black Flame and the core members of Zero Wing were still here, Zero Wing’s and Ouroboros’s forces would have carved a path of blood into this forest by now. They wouldn’t have dispersed and went on to do their own things.” Lone Tyrant’s confidant explained slowly.

Before, Lone Tyrant’s anger had blinded him, so he had not considered this. However, now that he thought it through, it was as his confidant said.

If Black Flame, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, were still trapped deep in his enemy’s territory, how could the other members of his Guild possibly sit and do nothing? They would have charged forward in desperation. If Zero Wing had joined hands with Ouroboros, based on Dark Star’s strength, Dark Star would have no choice but to back off.

Yet, Zero Wing had not done so. Even the reinforcements Lone Tyrant had called in from White River City received no obstruction whatsoever from the other Guild. Based on Zero Wing’s inaction, one could conclude that Black Flame had indeed already left the Silverleaf Forest.

“Damn that Black Flame! We’ve wasted so much time and manpower!” Lone Tyrant’s eyes burned with anger. However, he was simply helpless against Zero Wing. It was no longer possible to deal with their enemy now.

Previously, he had the help of World Dominators to hinder Ouroboros. Now that World Dominators was out of the competition, if Dark Star wished to deal with Zero Wing, it would have to fight both Zero Wing and Ouroboros simultaneously. Even with Underworld’s support, it was still not an opponent for these two Guilds.

Suddenly, Lone Tyrant seemed to age by several years.

“Pass on my command: everybody is dismissed. Those who should rest, rest. Those who wish to level up, go level up. As for the rewards and compensations, I will issue those later.” After Lone Tyrant finished speaking, as if all the strength in his body drained away, his entire person became powerless.

Soon after, everyone from Dark Star departed from the Silverleaf Forest, one after another.

As for the seal of Guild War Order, that, too, had dissipated.

When the thousands of players from Dark Star hunted Shi Feng’s group, having nothing better to do, Shi Feng and the others had spent their time searching for Silver Carp at a lake.

Currently, nobody that knew how precious Silver Carp were. Moreover, now that the underwater areas of the Silverleaf Forest had yet to develop, one could find a large number of Silver Carp in the lakes in the area.

Even in the very beginning, each Silver Carp sold for 20 Silver Coins. Presently, 20 Silver was worth 3,000 Credits; it could compare to the monthly salaries of white-collared workers. By the time everybody discovered the Silver Carp’s value, its price had soared from the initial 20 Silver Coins to 2 Gold Coins. To an average player, such an amount was a fortune.

During the several hours Dark Star had hunted them, Shi Feng and the others had managed to catch over 20 Silver Carp. They even discovered multiple Treasure Chests. Although they were only Bronze and Mysterious-Iron rank, it was still a considerable harvest.

“Guild Leader, as you predicted, Dark Star has released the seal on the Silverleaf Forest,” Fire Dance reported excitedly.

Although everything had gone according to Shi Feng’s plan, when everyone witnessed the area seal lifting so quickly, they could not help their astonishment. It was as if everything was within Shi Feng’s grasp.

“That’s that. However, we are now Red Players. If we aren’t nobles of White River City, we won’t have any way to enter the city safely. Most of us are already Level 20, so if we wish to upgrade ourselves further, we need to complete our class change. Let’s first wash away our Red Names. Otherwise, we can’t enter White River City to accept our class change quest.”

Shi Feng was not particularly surprised about the seal on the Silverleaf Forest releasing. After spending so much time and manpower, Dark Star had still failed to locate any of them. As long as Lone Tyrant was not an idiot, he would definitely stop searching for them like a fool.
