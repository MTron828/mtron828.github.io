Chapter 940 – Siege Weapon

When Ink Crystal’s Twofold Thornstorm and Lunar River’s Divine Cross Slash collided, a powerful space-time storm swept across Plot 079. However, Ink Crystal’s fusion technique turned out weaker than Lunar River’s Overlimit Skill, as the dazzling cross slash cut through the two vine lotus flowers like a hot knife through butter and continued toward Ink Crystal. Only after Ink Crystal followed up with another Twofold Thornstorm did she neutralize Lunar River’s attack.

As soon as the Divine Cross Slash faded, Ink Crystal created another set of vine lotus flowers to attack Lunar River. Her Concentration was seemingly boundless, and she gave her opponent no room to breathe.

However, Lunar River had apparently anticipated Ink Crystal’s attack, as by the time Ink Crystal’s third Twofold Thornstorm was bearing down on her, she had already swung her jet-black greatsword nine times, launching nine dazzling sword lights that shredded the two vine lotus flowers.

Peak Gold Combat Technique, Nine Polar Flashes!

Boom!

Boom!

Boom!

After Ink Crystal and Lunar River traded several dozen moves, the remaining two-thirds of Plot 079 shattered into dozens of small islands suspended in the air. The land of Plot 079 had been devastated, the sight stunning all spectating players.

“An entire plot of land got destroyed?!”

“Monsters! These two must be monsters!”

“Lunar River? Who is she? Why haven’t I heard of her before?”

Besides Zero Wing’s members, many of the players spectating from outside Everlasting City were also drawn by the activity at Plot 079. They had never thought a clash between two players could destroy a plot of land in Everlasting City. However, compared to the destruction, everyone was more surprised that Lunar River could hold her ground against Ink Crystal.

Ink Crystal’s strength spoke for itself. She was strong enough to one-shot Garuda, even after he had reached the sixth-floor standard. Yet, even after several dozen exchanges, the outcome of the fight between Ink Crystal and Lunar River remained indeterminate. This was simply unbelievable.

…

On one of the islands created from the remnants of Plot 079…

“This Lunar River person is incredible! She’s actually holding up against that girl!” Kowloon Demon exclaimed as he looked at Lunar River in the Magic Mirror. “If we compare only overall strength, she can probably rank in the top five in our world!”

Whether it was Mortal Gods or players who could use Tier 6 Overlimit Skills, they were all talents that royal powers like Dragon’s Crown could only obtain through luck. Royal powers regarded such individuals as their foundation.

Originally, Kowloon Demon thought there was nothing special about the Greater God’s Domain and that it couldn’t compare with the remnant primordial world he came from. After all, Red Frost was the only known sixth-floor expert in the human race’s Greater God’s Domain.

But ever since he participated in Everlasting City’s competition, the number of noteworthy experts he encountered kept increasing. Key among them was Ink Crystal, who even he felt inferior to. Now, he had even encountered an expert capable of using Tier 6 Overlimit Skills. This was truly a surprise.

“Although Lunar River is strong, that Crystallian girl is the true terror!” Purgatory Jade sighed as she watched Ink Crystal holding her ground against Lunar River’s powerful attacks. “She has nearly reached that realm at such a young age. In terms of talent, she probably exceeds even the Guild Leader in his younger days.”

“That monster would probably have a stroke if he learned of this,” Kowloon Demon said, agreeing with Purgatory Jade. “But now that they are evenly matched, it should make it easier to snatch their tokens.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The current situation was ideal for them to take advantage of. Regardless of which side won, both would ultimately lose.

“An easier time?” Purgatory Jade shook her head as she watched the two people clashing in the Magic Mirror. “I wouldn’t necessarily say that. On the contrary, we might have a tough fight ahead of us. While the two might be evenly matched, their teams are not. King’s Paradise has the numerical advantage and the support of a Large Advanced Silver Battle Array. Although Savage Gods has another sixth-floor expert to spare, its defeat is inevitable.”

…

As Purgatory Jade spoke, the rest of Savage Gods’s and King’s Paradise’s members finally entered the fray. Just as Purgatory Jade speculated, the odds did not favor Savage Gods. Despite being a sixth-floor expert, Desert River could only defend himself passively, as he faced dozens of fifth-floor experts with Basic Attributes rivaling players fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

After both sides clashed for several minutes, Savage Gods and King’s Paradise had lost about a dozen players each. Although the casualties for both sides looked similar, Savage Gods’s team comprised only about 100 members, while King’s Paradise’s team comprised over 500. Hence, while Savage Gods’s casualty rate reached nearly 20%, King’s Paradise’s casualty rate didn’t even reach 5%.

“Miss Ink Crystal, I’d suggest you simply surrender your tokens,” Lunar River said as she fought. “In ten more minutes, you’ll be all that’s left of your team. You will ultimately lose your life as well. You can still leave with your life if you hand over your tokens now. I’m sure you can make up for your loss in the remaining time with your strength. You don’t have to fight us to the bitter end.”

Originally, Lunar River sneaked into Plot 079 to ambush Garuda. With his tokens, King’s Paradise would instantly be propelled to the top ten in the number of tokens collected. Unfortunately, her plans fell short, as she hadn’t expected Ink Crystal to kill Garuda and discover her team. This left her with no choice but to use her trump cards against Ink Crystal.

Lunar River did not wish to fight an expert like Ink Crystal. After all, even if her team could ultimately defeat Ink Crystal’s team, it would be at the cost of significant casualties. The minimum number of players required to activate a Large Advanced Silver Battle Array was 500. If Ink Crystal managed to kill half her team, she would have difficulty finding replacements to activate the battle array again. And if she couldn’t activate the battle array, she would have a hard time facing the various powers throughout the rest of the competition.

Ink Crystal fell silent at Lunar River’s proposal. Although she was more than capable of continuing her fight with Lunar River, it was a fact that her teammates were not faring well against King’s Paradise’s members.

As Ink Crystal and Lunar River continued clashing in silence, something suddenly impinged on their senses. They immediately stopped fighting and turned toward a particular direction, a hint of gloom in their eyes.

“Team Leader?”

“Vice Guild Leader?”

When Desert River, Shuoyun, and the rest of Savage Gods’s and King’s Paradise’s members noticed Ink Crystal and Lunar River’s sudden pause, they couldn’t help but follow the two’s gaze in confusion.

A moment later, in the north of Plot 079, multiple massive space-time passages opened up in the sky. As soon as these space-time passages appeared, players started to emerge from them in batches like a well-trained army. Players riding flying machines also emerged from the largest of the space-time passages one after another. When these flying machines reached a thousand in number, they merged to form a palace of steel and iron, the sight of which numbed the scalps of Savage Gods’s and King’s Paradise’s members.

An Epic Siege Weapon!

A weapon exclusive to royal powers!

TL Notes:

Fyi, “That monster” is not referring to Dragon’s Crown’s Guild Leader. It is referring to an independent player in the remnant primordial world.
