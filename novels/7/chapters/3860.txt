Chapter 935 – Top 10 Teams

Silence enveloped the battlefield following Bladeweaver’s death. The players who had witnessed his death were especially terrified as they looked at Purgatory Jade. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Evil Nature members engaged in battle with Zero Wing’s forces might have been too busy to care about anything else, but it was a different story for the spectating players. They all saw the fight between Purgatory Jade and Bladeweaver.

In essence, Purgatory Jade had executed only one move against Bladeweaver. Unlike when she fought Unseeing Demon, she did not trade blows with Bladeweaver but defeated him with absolute speed.

As soon as their fight began, Purgatory Jade surrounded Bladeweaver with hundreds of afterimages and attacked him from all directions. Although Bladeweaver tried his best to block and dodge Purgatory Jade’s attacks, his HP kept decreasing, and he died a few seconds later.

Of course, this wasn’t to say that Bladeweaver was weak. It was just that he wasn’t as well-rounded as Unseeing Demon. Having specialized in defense, he hadn’t grasped any Peak Gold Holy Arts that amplified his Movement Speed and Attack Speed. Hence, even though he was superior to Purgatory Jade in Basic Attributes, he was still slower than her. This flaw allowed Purgatory Jade to land an attack once every few attempts, the compounding effects of which caused his swift demise.

Furthermore, Bladeweaver had fought Purgatory Jade without support, as the Dragon’s Crown youths occupied the Evil Nature team leaders. If he had even one healer assisting him, Purgatory Jade could never have killed him.

Before Slumbering Vocalist could come to his senses, Purgatory Jade appeared near him, evidently looking to cooperate with Kowloon Demon.

“Dammit!” Slumbering Vocalist frowned when he saw Purgatory Jade. He already had his hands full dealing with Kowloon Demon. If Purgatory Jade, who was even stronger than Kowloon Demon, joined the fight, he would share Bladeweaver’s fate.

Upon thinking up to this point, Slumbering Vocalist gritted his teeth, pulled out a crimson stone, and crushed it.

“He ran?” Kowloon Demon was surprised when he saw Slumbering Vocalist’s figure fading.

Although the battle was currently in Zero Wing’s favor, Evil Nature’s experts outnumbered Zero Wing’s experts. Zero Wing had already suffered over 30 casualties. Had Slumbering Vocalist chosen to fight to the bitter end, Zero Wing would have lost about two to three hundred members, greatly impacting its ability to collect tokens later.

“Just you wait! Evil Nature will make you pay!” Slumbering Vocalist shouted, glaring at Kowloon Demon and Shi Feng.

After saying so, Slumbering Vocalist commanded the Holy Hymn Legion and the Holy Scorpion Legion to scatter. The spectating players gawked at this outcome while Zero Wing’s members hurriedly gave chase, trying to collect as many tokens as possible.

…

“Slumbering Vocalist didn’t even hesitate to escape.” Verdant Rainbow was quite surprised as she watched Evil Nature’s members scattering in the Magic Mirror.

According to the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s intelligence, Slumbering Vocalist was extremely arrogant and overbearing. He was the type to fight to the bitter end, even in a hopeless battle. Although Evil Nature’s defeat was already guaranteed in this battle, he should have kept fighting to leave Zero Wing with only a pyrrhic victory.

“He made the right choice. After all, the competition has just begun. There will be plenty of opportunities later,” Elder Martial said calmly.

“Opportunities? Will Evil Nature dare to continue provoking Zero Wing after this?” Verdant Rainbow asked curiously. “Zero Wing’s team has two Mortal Gods and seven Half-step Mortal Gods. It also has that terrifying large-scale Destruction Spell and Guild Leader Black Flame, who is stronger than even Garuda. Not even royal powers can come up with such a lineup. Zero Wing’s team could probably even rank among the top ten teams in this competition.”

Verdant Rainbow did not doubt Evil Nature’s ability to take revenge on Zero Wing. However, even if Evil Nature managed to do so, it would be at a huge cost. Evil Nature might even lose its ability to occupy four plots of land.

“How can it be that simple?” Elder Martial shook his head and chuckled. “If we consider only the number of Half-step Mortal Gods each team has, Zero Wing’s team can indeed rank in the top ten. However, in terms of overall strength, Zero Wing would be fortunate if it could rank in the top twenty. You shouldn’t underestimate the various royal powers and apex powers. Currently, teams that can rank in the top ten all have trump cards that can easily kill sixth-floor experts.

“Also, as I said before, Everlasting City’s competition has just started. Many players are still in the competition, so the distribution of tokens is scattered. However, as time passes, fewer players will remain in the competition, making it more difficult to hunt for tokens. The distribution of tokens will also become more concentrated. When only one or two hours remain, that is when Everlasting City’s competition will truly begin. At that time, the various powers will start to reveal their cards to obtain more tokens.”

“Zero Wing still can’t rank in the top ten in strength, even with such a lineup?” Verdant Rainbow was astonished.

Besides the six royal powers, only a few other powers participating in Everlasting City’s competition commanded experts of Unseeing Demon’s caliber. Even the Seven Luminaries Alliance couldn’t confidently say it could win against Zero Wing in this competition. Hence, Verdant Rainbow found it hard to believe that Zero Wing couldn’t rank in the top ten.

“Here is the latest information collected. You’ll understand once you read it,” Elder Martial said, handing a piece of paper to Verdant Rainbow.

“How is this possible?!” Verdant Rainbow gasped when she read the paper.

The paper was a list of the various powers’ current performances. Unsurprisingly, all six participating royal powers were in the top ten. However, what surprised Verdant Rainbow wasn’t the royal powers’ performances but the performances of six non-royal powers. Although the paper didn’t have any specific records, it showed that each of these six non-royal powers had already collected over 40,000 tokens, nearly triple what Zero Wing had collected.

Among these six non-royal powers, two pseudo-apex powers of little renown stood out. One was the Crystallian race’s Savage Gods, while the other was the human race’s King’s Paradise. The two had collected 50,000 tokens thus far, their performances close to catching up with the six royal powers.

Zero Wing didn’t even rank in the top 30 in terms of the number of tokens collected…

“Rainbow, get ready.” While Verdant Rainbow was in a daze, Elder Martial ordered, “We will start our hunt now. If we can’t secure more tokens in the early stage, we will have difficulty securing four plots of land later.”

“Understood!” Verdant Rainbow promptly organized the Seven Luminaries Alliance’s forces at Elder Martial’s command.

…

Ten hours after the competition started, the lands inside Everlasting City lay in ruins. After hours of frenzied killing, over 90% of the participating players had been eliminated, and the remaining players all started to operate covertly across the city.

…

Plot 079:

“Guild Leader, I found two teams fighting here. The teams are small; they only total a little more than a hundred players,” Hidden Soul reported through the team chat. “One of the teams is from the Crystallian race’s Savage Gods, while the other is from the Holy Race’s Thunder Empire.”

“Who are they led by?” Shi Feng asked, his interest piqued by this information.

Currently, Zero Wing had only collected about 35,000 tokens. This still wasn’t enough to guarantee four plots of land. After all, there were only 144 plots of land in Everlasting City; only a maximum of 36 powers could leave with an Eternal World Magic Array. After factoring in powers that would occupy more than four plots of land and last-minute confrontations, it’d be fortunate if two dozen powers could leave with an Eternal World Magic Array.

Not to mention, Zero Wing hadn’t been doing particularly well at collecting tokens due to its lack of numbers. Although Zero Wing’s members had split into many groups, the team’s overall performance still couldn’t match that of the various apex and royal powers. Compared to the large haul at the beginning of the competition, Zero Wing’s subsequent income of tokens was pitiful. And worse, players in the competition started to operate more covertly as time passed. Now, large-scale battles were few and far between.

After a slight pause, Hidden Soul said, “Ink Crystal and Garuda.”
