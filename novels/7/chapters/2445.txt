Chapter 2446 – Repent!

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, silence fell over the area as Divine Tribe’s members gawked at Shi Feng, their eyes wide in shock.

Shi Feng had not spoken very loudly; ordinary players standing 20 yards away from him wouldn’t have been able to make out his words. However, everyone present was an expert. Their five senses were far superior to ordinary players’, so they heard Shi Feng’s words just fine.

Despite that, however, Divine Tribe’s members still could not help but wonder if they had heard wrong.

After all, how could there possibly be anyone that would dare speak to Divine Tribe in such a manner?

Not even the Azure Chamber of Commerce’s Guild Leader would dare speak to Divine Tribe in such an arrogant manner, yet a random Tier 3 player like Shi Feng actually had?

“Did you guys not hear what our Guild Leader said? If you apologize quickly and hand over 100 pieces of Level 100-plus Fine-Gold Equipment as compensation, then we will let this matter slide. Otherwise, the consequences definitely won’t be something you’d be willing to bear.” Cola repeated Shi Feng’s words as he looked at the stunned Divine Tribe members.

Unlike Shi Feng, Cola had shouted, and his words echoed throughout the entire mine below. Let alone the several Divine Tribe members before him, even the tens of thousands of players in the mine below heard him loud and clear.

“Who are these people? They actually dare spout such nonsense against Divine Tribe?”

“Although I don’t know who they are, they are definitely dead now.”

They won’t die just once today. Now that they’ve provoked Divine Tribe in such a manner, Divine Tribe will surely kill them back to Level 0!”

The Azure Chamber of Commerce’s members were stunned as they looked at Shi Feng’s group on the Thunder Eagle. Even their Chamber’s Guild Leader did not dare behave so arrogantly before Divine Tribe.

Divine Tribe was a top-ranking super-first-rate Guild. When God’s Domain first launched, Divine Tribe was already very close to becoming a Super Guild. Moreover, due to God’s Domain’s growing popularity, Divine Tribe had received capital injections from several major corporations. At this point, Divine Tribe’s strength already rivaled Super Guilds’. In fact, it was even stronger than some of the ordinary Super Guilds. This was why Divine Tribe dared to contest with the Azure Chamber of Commerce for the Demonic Silver vein.

“Xiaoqian, are these people insane?” the Berserker King Elder from Azure asked, similarly stunned by this situation. He had thought that Shi Feng’s group might turn around and flee, or that Shi Feng’s group might seek help from Azure. What didn’t occur to him was that Shi Feng might actually provoke Divine Tribe without hesitation.

At this moment, even if Azure’s Guild Leader showed up, it would still be impossible to dissuade Divine Tribe from taking action against Shi Feng’s group.

Yan Xiaoqian was likewise confused by this situation. If possible, she really wished to ask Shi Feng what he was thinking.

He can’t be thinking that this place is like Demonstone Town and that nobody can do anything to Tier 3 players, right?

As Yan Xiaoqian looked at Shi Feng, the only explanation she could think of for this situation was that he believed that no superpower would dare to touch him just because he was a Tier 3 player. After all, the various superpowers had shown the Swordsman great respect back at Demonstone Town.

However, the situations now and then were completely different!

Back then, Shi Feng could indeed act arrogantly as a Tier 3 player, as none of the various superpowers could do anything to him.

Now, however, every superpower had at least several dozen Tier 3 experts under their command. Let alone Tier 3 peak experts, even Tier 3 apex experts no longer had the qualifications to act arrogantly before the various superpowers.

This was especially true on the western continent, which was infested with Demonic Creatures. Players living here had much more combat experience than players living on the eastern continent. The Legacies and various items used by the western continent’s players for combat were also much stronger than those found on the eastern continent.

Let alone dealing with Tier 3 players, the various superpowers wouldn’t have trouble dealing with even Tier 3 NPCs. After all, the armies of Demonic Creatures had commander-level monsters that could rival NPCs when it came to intellect. In the end, however, the various superpowers had still slain those intelligent monsters.

While Yan Xiaoqian and the other members of Azure were stunned by Shi Feng’s crazy actions, Macaffrey suddenly smiled on the giant bat’s back.

“Very good. It seems you didn’t come here in ignorance. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have the guts to provoke Divine Tribe,” Macaffrey said, a cold glint flashing in his eyes as he looked at Shi Feng. “This will make things simple. Repent of your provocations! Otherwise, only eternal hell awaits you all!”

As soon as Macaffrey said so, the several Divine Tribe experts around him activated the Magic Scrolls in their hands, not only sealing the surrounding airspace but also placing a tracker on the souls of Shi Feng’s group. This way, even if Shi Feng’s group died and resurrected somewhere else, they could still track down the group.

At the same time, the several hundred Divine Tribe Tier 2 experts positioned on the ground beneath the Thunder Eagle formed multiple magic arrays and cast large-scale Combination Spells.

Several fire pillars and lances of light immediately emerged from the ground and flew straight at Shi Feng’s group, the power of these Spells not the slightest bit weaker than the Tier 3 Spells of actual Tier 3 players. In fact, some of these Spells could rival even Tier 4 Spells in terms of power.

Boom... Boom... Boom...

For a moment, the airspace the Thunder Eagle occupied turned into a sea of flames. The shockwaves from the explosions were palpable even over a hundred yards away.

“What a waste. Originally, these Spells were supposed to be used on Azure’s Tier 3 peak experts. Now, we’re actually squandering them on these people,” a Tier 3 red-haired, female Elementalist standing behind Macaffrey said, clicking her tongue.

Ten days ago, Tier 3 players were indeed existences that the various superpowers could not afford to underestimate.

However, the situation was different now. The various superpowers had secured not only the means to resist Tier 3 players but also the means to kill Tier 3 players.

In the face of a Combination Spell cast by 30 Tier 2 players, even monstrously strong Tier 3 players would fall if they were careless. Not to mention, they had used seven of such Combination Spells this time.

“Alright, get ready to use the Raise Dead Scrolls and resurrect them! I want to let them know how foolish it is to provoke Divine Tribe!” Macaffrey said, gesturing at the players holding Raise Dead Scrolls to move forward.

The Raise Dead Scroll was a precious tool that could be found only in ancient ruins. The scroll’s original function was to resurrect comrades that had fallen in battle. However, it was also useful when they wanted to repeatedly kill enemy players. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Yet, after the Divine Tribe members holding the Raise Dead Scrolls tried to resurrect Shi Feng’s group, they could not help staring at their scrolls in confusion.

“What’s wrong? Why aren’t you resurrecting them?” Macaffrey demanded after seeing that the Raise Dead Scrolls remained in his subordinates’ hands.

“Vice Guild Leader, for some reason, these Raise Dead Scrolls can’t resurrect them. The scrolls might be broken,” a Tier 3 Ranger reported.

“Broken?”

Macaffrey was a little surprised at this situation. He then returned his gaze to the sea of flames before him.

The Raise Dead Scrolls had never failed to activate before. If the resurrection failed, then that could only mean one thing.

The target of resurrection was still alive!

In the next moment, the flames started scattering, and the perfect figure of the Thunder Eagle appeared hovering amidst the remnant flames. Surrounding the Thunder Eagle was a barrier that thoroughly isolated the Flying Mount from the inferno.

This barrier was the product of Shi Feng’s Absolute Domain.

“Since you’re done attacking, it’s my turn now!” Shi Feng declared. He then raised his arm and started incanting, casting Flame Domain on Macaffrey’s group.
