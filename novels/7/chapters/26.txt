Chapter 27 - Shi Feng’s Improved Party

Hearing Shi Feng’s comment, the Summoner, Gluttonous Mouse suddenly panicked. He did not understand what Shi Feng wanted him to do. If he had performed badly and was kicked from the party as a result, he would regret it until he died.

It was hard to find a good party during this time, not to mention a party with an expert leading it. It was impossible to join such a party, even if you begged!

“Relax, I won’t let you do anything dangerous. You just have to summon out a Flame Sprite and follow my instructions. You don’t have to do anything else,” Shi Feng said with a smile, trying ease the nerves of Gluttonous Mouse a little.

Currently, Summoners were not strong; mainly due to the incapability of their skills. A Summoner’s method of attack mainly relied on their summoned creatures, whereas their normal attack was the low-damage Magic Bullet. However, a Summoner with awesome skills could become a one-man army. It was especially true for Summoners who could call out powerful elemental creatures. They could kill Elite monsters as if they were just playing around.

“Party leader, rest assured, I’ll definitely do it.” Gluttonous Mouse loudly said, his tone filled with respect. He was like a student who had met his teacher.

“Everyone else, distance yourselves from that rock, twenty yards away from it would be the best. Pay attention not to lure the other monsters.” Sh Feng turned around and said to the other party members.

“Yes, party leader!”

The other party members loudly replied. Their current attitudes were completely different from before.

Shi Feng was slightly shocked by everyone’s performance. Why was each and every one of them so obedient all of a sudden?

However, Shi Feng did not know that the single stone he threw just now had completely shocked every one of them.

They were filled with admiration towards Shi Feng’s stone-throwing technique. Such skill and accuracy were definitely not something a normal person could do; professional players might not even be able to do so.

Worshipping the strong was a common sight within a game. These Level 1 noobs were no exception.

At this moment, the gaze everyone used to look at Shi Feng was completely different. Before, they merely felt that Shi Feng was a good commander. Now, however, Shi Feng was a strong person they worshipped. They had faintly grown a sense of reverence for Shi Feng.

Standing to the side, Blackie clapped Lonely Snow’s shoulders, proudly saying, “How is it? Following Brother Feng isn’t bad, right?”

Lonely Snow silently nodded his head, rejoicing for the decision he made to follow after Shi Feng. Shi Feng was definitely a Beta Tester expert. Without sufficient experience and practice, such techniques were impossible to accomplish. Only a Beta Tester could possibly do it.

“Hahaha! What do you plan to do in the future?” Blackie suddenly asked. He started to hatch ideas towards Lonely Snow. Blackie wanted to poach Lonely Snow for their Workshop, even though the Workshop was still non-existent. There was a 100% chance for Cola to join them, but Lonely Snow still did not have any plans to move in such a direction.

“The future?” Lonely Snow had never considered it before. He was but an average player. He did not have any big ambitions, only wanting to earn some cash from playing games. He said honestly, “I have never considered it before.”

“I see that your techniques are quite good. Why don’t you join us for now?” Blackie nonchalantly asked.

“Really?” Lonely Snow had anxiety about his future after Blackie’s question. He did not know where he wanted to go. If he could party with an expert, then it could not get any better.

“Of course. However, we still need to look at your future performance. We don’t just simply accept people,” Blackie proudly said, pretending to be an expert.

“Thank you, Brother Black.” Lonely Snow happily responded. He never imagined his luck would be so great as to be noticed by an expert.

Seeing Lonely Snow agree, Blackie released a sigh of relief. Currently, Blackie was just a fox pretending to be a tiger. He couldn’t help out Shi Feng much in God’s Domain, but he could still help out in regards to administration.

There wasn’t even a shadow of their Workshop as of this moment. There was also the debt of 16,000 Credits. The Workshop’s members consisted of only Shi Feng and himself. It was definitely the poorest Workshop in history. If this was found out by the others, they would definitely turn around and leave. Now, Blackie could only fake being an expert to lure people to join their Workshop.

At this moment, Shi Feng was currently explaining the contents of the operation to the Summoner. The operation was to let Gluttonous Mouse lure the remaining six Night Rabbits by controlling his Flame Sprite. Because the Night Rabbit that was closest to the Boss was no more, luring the other Night Rabbits would not attract the Boss. They could lure the monsters with ease.

The Flame Sprite was extremely weak. Its HP was only a pitiful 15 points, and it would die in a single hit. However, its Movement Speed was extremely quick. Adding to its very small size, trying to hit it would be a difficult task.

“Start the operation. Mouse, remember to maintain a distance of 4 yards or above while circling around the rock,” Shi Feng reminded once more.

Gluttonous Mouse nodded his head. Carefully, he controlled the Flame Sprite to lure the six Night Rabbits. When the sprite entered the 35-yard distance, the nearest Elite Night Rabbit discovered the Flame Sprite. Suddenly, it turned its body around and rushed towards the Flame Sprite. The other Night Rabbits also came rushing along.

Seeing the Night Rabbits taking the bait, Gluttonous Mouse immediately controlled the Flame Sprite and ran. The six Night Rabbits were in hot pursuit, but their speed could no match for the Flame Sprite. In a moment, the Flame Sprite had arrived beneath the large rock. It had lured the six Night Rabbits over and started circling around the large rock.

On the other side, Cola had already aggroed the Night Rabbit that had left its unit. Cola interchanged between blocking and using his new skill, [Divine Strike]. With the effects of two pieces of Bronze Equipment, a single hit from Divine Strike had caused 26 damage. It was a lot higher compared to the 11 or 12 damage caused by a normal strike. Also, Divine Strike had the added effect of increasing Hatred. It became a lot easier to hold aggro.

The Night Rabbit was killed off within a short moment. It dropped 5 Coppers.

After this Night Rabbit was handled, only the six Night Rabbits that kept on circling around the large rock remained.

“I’ll lure the Night Rabbits. Cola, pay attention to pull the monster.” Shi Feng picked up another small stone, throwing it at the Night Rabbit that ran at the rear.

The Night Rabbit rubbed its cranium after being struck on it. The rabbit turned around, discovering Shi Feng that had thrown the stone. The Night Rabbit suddenly became enraged. It madly hopped towards Shi Feng with its powerful legs. As for the other Night Rabbits, they were still excitedly chasing after the Flame Sprite, failing to notice the disappearance of one of their companions.

“Receive it!” Seeing the Night Rabbit was only 20 yards away from the party, Shi Feng commanded. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Cola rushed ahead, sending a Divine Strike towards the Night Rabbit’s head.

The Night Rabbit’s target immediately changed, extending its claws towards Cola’s cranium. However, Cola had reacted quickly by dodging his body sideways. After avoiding the attack, Cola continued by using [Punishment]. The skill had once more strengthened the Night Rabbit’s Hatred to Cola.

“Everyone, focus fire.”

Shi Feng inwardly applauded after seeing Cola’s performance. He had never imagined Cola’s ability to learn would be this great. He had already found out about the Night Rabbit’s attack patterns after going through slightly more than ten battles. No wonder he was the core MT of a first-rate Guild, ten years later. His potential was limitless.

The Night Rabbit in front of Cola had fallen within 20 seconds. It had even dropped a skill book for Swordsman, [Double Chop].

Shi Feng immediately learned it without reservations.

[Double Chop] (Action-type)

Requires: Sword

Level 1

Proficiency 0/300

Rapidly deals damage twice. Every slash of the sword deals 120% +15 damage, also increasing Bleeding effect by 20%. Duration of 10 seconds.

Stacks up to a maximum of 5 times.

Cooldown: 8 seconds

This skill book had greatly increased Shi Feng’s explosive power. As for the problem of getting used to the skill, it was non-existent for Shi Feng. After playing for ten years as a Swordsman, the skills belonging to the Job were deeply ingrained into Shi Feng’s bones. As long as Shi Feng got ahold of these skills, he would be able to utilize them to their greatest potential.

Shi Feng had also lured the remaining five Night Rabbits over, one after another. The party had killed the rabbits one by one, and following the death of the final Night Rabbit, a golden glow appeared around Shi Feng’s body; he had risen to Level 2.

At the same time, the five Night Rabbits had contributed to the party a piece of Bronze Plate Armor for Guardian Knights. The equipment increased Cola’s HP to 390 points and his Defense to 56. It had also increased Cola’s ability to resist against the Night Rabbit Chieftain, Willie.
