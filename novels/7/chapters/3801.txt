At Kowloon Demon’s words, Whirlwind Bulwark and Star Butterfly hurriedly approached Shi Feng with nervous expressions.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Guild Leader Black Flame, don’t be impulsive. This is how Kowloon Demon behaves toward everyone,” Whirlwind Bulwark whispered. “Kowloon Demon has already risen to Level 240. He also possesses a Level 240 Fragmented Legendary Equipment Set. I’m afraid there is nobody in Nightmare Holy City who is his match now.”

Although Whirlwind Bulwark knew Shi Feng was strong, Kowloon Demon’s level advantage was simply too much to overcome. After seeing Kowloon Demon one-shot Heiser twice, he felt that even Red Frost was unlikely to be a match for Kowloon Demon.

Meanwhile, Shi Feng didn’t get angry at Kowloon Demon’s provocation. He merely observed the other party in silence.

“A Primordial Dragonoid?”

When Shi Feng looked at Kowloon Demon’s four horns and four arms, he suddenly thought of a Mythical Era race from the Greater God’s Domain.

Primordial Dragonoid!

According to rumors, Primordial Dragonoids rivaled Dragons in Life Rating, though their population was lower than even that of Dragons. Of the races human players could convert to, the Primordial Dragonoid race had the strongest Physique. However, throughout Shi Feng’s previous life, nobody from the human race’s Greater God’s Domain had managed to become a Primordial Dragonoid. More specifically, the method to convert to this Mythical Era race had never been found.

In addition to being a Primordial Dragonoid, Kowloon Demon also wielded four extraordinary sabers. All four were Level 240 Taboo Legendary Weapons. Such weapons were incredibly rare in the Greater God’s Domain; only apex powers had them.

“You are the first to recognize my race in Nightmare Holy City.” Kowloon Demon narrowed his eyes when he heard Shi Feng’s words. “Is your party not from here?”

“That’s right; we are not. We only came here by chance,” Shi Feng said, not bothering to withhold this information.

According to the information Whirlwind Bulwark provided, this remnant primordial world didn’t consist of just the Nightmare Holy City Region. Anyone who bothered to investigate would quickly know that his party didn’t originate from this region, so he might as well admit it.

The players and powers of Nightmare Holy City Region had to progress to other regions sooner or later. Before that happened, it would undoubtedly be in their best interests to partner with players from other regions. Hence, if the locals knew that his party came from outside the region, they would be more inclined to partner with his party.

“Is that so?” Kowloon Demon’s gaze suddenly turned cold at Shi Feng’s admission. “In that case, you should know that this isn’t a place you should covet! Anyone who dares to will be granted permanent death!”

As soon as Kowloon Demon finished speaking, the intensity of his aura skyrocketed. He no longer kept his aura suppressed, its true state startling even the resentful Heiser. Xiao Yilong, who was Level 230, revealed a terrified expression when he sensed Kowloon Demon’s oppressive aura.

He’s as strong as the Great Commander?

At this moment, Xiao Yilong felt like he was looking at South Lake, Holy Dragon Spear’s Great Commander, when he looked at Kowloon Demon. He felt utterly powerless and couldn’t even muster the thought of resisting.

However, Xiao Yilong couldn’t understand why he was getting such a feeling from Kowloon Demon. After all, Kowloon Demon didn’t have a single Divine Artifact on him. Nevertheless, the aura the other party radiated was comparable to that of South Lake fully equipped with Divine Artifacts.

As for Whirlwind Bulwark and the others, this situation shocked them even more.

“Is he really Kowloon Demon?” Star Butterfly felt like she was looking at a completely different person when she looked at Kowloon Demon.

Although Star Butterfly had known that Kowloon Demon was strong in the past, the difference in their Basic Attributes definitely didn’t reach a point where she would feel despair. Currently, it felt like Kowloon Demon could crush her with just a wave of his hand. This made her suspect that a Level 240 Humanoid Boss had disguised itself as Kowloon Demon and appeared before them.

As expected of a Primordial Dragonoid. This Life Rating is simply absurd. Shi Feng was similarly astonished by Kowloon Demon’s unsuppressed aura.

The current Kowloon Demon was like a Dragon equipped with weapons and equipment. Although these were only Legendary and Fragmented Legendary items, Kowloon Demon’s Basic Attributes should not be much inferior to the Level 239 South Lake.

“Considering that you came here by accident, I can give you a chance,” Kowloon Demon said indifferently as he glanced at Shi Feng. “Send someone from your party of six to fight me. So long as this person can last three moves against me, I will allow your party to leave Nightmare Holy City safely on the condition that you never return to this region. Otherwise, today will be the last day your party spends in God’s Domain!

“Of course, you can rest assured that I won’t take advantage of my Basic Attributes. I will fight you with similar Basic Attributes.”

Heiser and Xiao Yilong recovered their composure slightly when they heard Kowloon Demon’s follow-up words. Although they didn’t understand why Kowloon Demon had reacted so intensely when they mentioned they weren’t from this region, they knew he was serious—if nobody from their party could last three moves against him, he would erase them from God’s Domain.

Fortunately, Kowloon Demon didn’t intend to capitalize on his Basic Attribute advantage. In a competition of combat standards, Red Frost absolutely stood a chance against Kowloon Demon.

“Are you sure you will only fight with similar Basic Attributes?” Shi Feng asked for verification.

“Naturally. I always keep my word,” Kowloon Demon said with certainty. Then, he glanced at Shi Feng and added, “You’re not worth breaking my promise. Alright, hurry up and call that Red Frost woman over. My patience is limited, so you had best not waste time.”

When Kowloon Demon finished speaking, Xiao Yilong promptly tried to contact Red Frost, not daring to waste any time.

While Xiao Yilong was calling Red Frost, Shi Feng suddenly approached Kowloon Demon and calmly unsheathed the Shadow Incinerator, saying, “In that case, I will fight you. I hope you will keep your promise.”
