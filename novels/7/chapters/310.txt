Chapter 311 - Absolute Control

Watching up to this point, South Wolf knew that defeat was inevitable, though he was loath to admit it, and his heart was filled with indignation.

Currently, his team had fewer than 30 players, and practically all of them were mages and healers. He alone was the only melee class alive. With such a team composition, Dark Star stood absolutely no chance against Zero Wing’s core team, which currently consisted of over 30 players.

The single sword strike Black Flame had displayed far exceeded South Wolf’s imagination. Not only was Black Flame inconceivably fast, his grasp of his Skills had also reached perfection, as shown by his single attack’s impeccable coverage of all twelve Rangers. Such a feat required one to possess excellent control over the skill itself and the angle of attack as well.

South Wolf was no fool, and neither was he a greenhorn that had been playing virtual reality games for only one or two years. As a representative of Underworld, he had met with and recruited lots of gaming experts before. He had also participated in a considerable number of team battles, so his experience in the virtual gaming world was quite plentiful.

Naturally, he understood the strategy Black Flame had used since the start of the battle.

Black Flame made the Guardian Knights, Shield Warriors, and other plate armor classes charge forward to lure the members of Dark Star into gathering around them. The female Cleric, Violet Cloud, was pivotal to this strategy. Although on the surface her healing ability was only double that of the healers of Dark Star, the effectiveness she displayed during the team battle far surpassed that of three or four healers combined.

Violet Cloud had an excellent grasp of the battle situation. Not only could she keep Cola alive and well, she could also simultaneously stabilize several other players’ HP. Throughout the battle, she performed smoothly and calmly. She was definitely not an existence to be trifled with.

Originally, Zero Wing already had powerful experts like Fire Dance, the team leader of Zero Wing’s core team, and Blackie, the number one player on White River City’s Ranking List. Now, South Wolf suddenly discovered that Zero Wing possessed not only Fire Dance and Blackie, Cola and Violet Cloud were definitely first-rate experts as well. Everyone else in Zero Wing’s core team were also all experts.

Meanwhile, Black Flame, who had suddenly appeared, was even more terrifying. The strength he displayed far surpassed that of all those previously mentioned. The scene South Wolf witnessed was like a replay of the god-ranked expert Ye Feng slaying the hundreds of players of Martial Union.

South Wolf could not figure out why there were so many experts gathering at a newly established Guild like Zero Wing.

Even a Guild that was newly established by a major corporation could not achieve what Zero Wing had manage in such a short amount of time.

South Wolf truly wondered how Black Flame had accomplished such a feat.

Although South Wolf was shocked by Black Flame’s personal strength and by Blackie, who possessed a strategic-level skill that could affect the entire battlefield...

“Black Flame, you are indeed amazing. However, the entire Silverleaf Forest is already under Dark Star’s control. Although your team of 30 or so players can easily defeat an elite team with more than 100 players, do you think you can do the same against 3,000 players? You have simply delayed the time of your demise.” South Wolf laughed coldly as he looked at Shi Feng, his current appearance making it seem as if he no longer cared about the many elite players that had died.

“Let’s go. It will be their time of death when Guild Leader Tyrant arrives.” Since his team was no match for Zero Wing, South Wolf naturally would not remain in this place and increase his losses.

The fact that he had discovered Black Flame, Zero Wing’s Guild Leader, here easily made up for the elite players he lost.

After all, Black Flame’s death would become a huge blow to Zero Wing’s reputation and prestige in White River City.

“Coming and going as you wish, do you think the Silverleaf Forest is your house?” Shi Feng smiled calmly, his eyes revealing a cold killing intent. “Since you’ve already pursued us to this place, I insist that you stay.”

“Do you think you can keep me here?” South Wolf laughed in disdain. He was an Assassin, the class that boasted the greatest survivability in the wild. If he hid himself in the dense forest, nobody would be able to find him.

“You can try. If any single one of you manages to escape today, then I will let you go.” Shi Feng waved, and all 30-plus members of Zero Wing immediately charged forward, starting their hunt of South Wolf and the surviving players of Dark Star.

The reason why South Wolf had never participated in the battle before was to leave a path of retreat for himself. This was a habit of his. After all, once he entered combat status, he could no longer use Stealth. At that time, he would only be left with Vanish to enter Stealth mode. However, Vanish was a lifesaving skill, so it should only be used at the most crucial of moments.

Looking at the enemy players charging at him, South Wolf revealed a disdainful expression. Just as he was about to use Stealth and hide himself in the dense forest...

“What’s going on?” South Wolf suddenly discovered that he could not use the skill. Like a prisoner deprived of his freedom, South Wolf frantically called out his skill bar to look for the cause of this situation. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Boss South Wolf, we can’t use our skills! What are we supposed to do now?” the Elementalists of Dark Star asked, frightened.

Originally, they had intended to cast Ice Wall to delay Zero Wing’s charge. Now, however, none of them could use any of their skills—and an Elementalist that could not use skills was like a lamb to the slaughter. Aside from sacrificing their lives to earn a few extra seconds for their allies, they were helpless.

“Run first, talk later.” South Wolf was confused about this situation as well, and he suspected that something must have gone wrong with the system. Since none of them could use skills, they could only rely on their two feet to escape.

As an Assassin, South Wolf had great confidence in his own speed.

However, just as he was turning to escape, he suddenly discovered that his Movement Speed had been greatly reduced. Everyone else from Dark Star faced a similar situation as well.

“Just what is going on?” South Wolf started panicking as the players of Zero Wing raced closer and closer to them. However, he was simply helpless in the situation.

In the next moment, South Wolf noticed a black figure dashing past Cola and the others. Like a mad gale, the figure instantly caught up with the escaping players of Dark Star.

This person was none other than Shi Feng himself.

At present, Shi Feng’s Agility exceeded 240 points, and there were also the bonuses provided by the equipment he wore. In terms of Movement Speed, Shi Feng was definitely ranked at the apex of Star-Moon Kingdom.

Shi Feng used Silent Steps and appeared behind South Wolf like a ghost. He then said softly, “I’ve already said that you can’t escape.”

Previously, while Shi Feng was conversing with South Wolf, he had secretly switched the Aura of Fire on the Seven Luminaries Ring to the Aura of Time.

Meanwhile, the Aura of Time reduced the Movement Speed and Attack Speed of enemies within a 100-yard radius by 20%, and increased the Cooldown of their Skills by 20%. When its activatable skill, Absolute Time, was used, it would even prevent enemies within a range of 50*50 yards from using any skills or tools for 20 seconds.

After Shi Feng used Absolute Time to envelope this entire area, everybody from Dark Star could not use any skills or tools for 20 seconds. Dark Star’s current surviving members mostly consisted of mages and healers, so this restriction had truly rendered them completely helpless.

One could say that the moment South Wolf’s team stepped into this region of the Silverleaf Forest, their lives passed into Shi Feng’s hands.

Just what did he do? South Wolf’s heart was filled with shock when he noticed Shi Feng appearing behind him.

Before South Wolf could even ponder on the subject, Shi Feng’s Abyssal Blade had already left its scabbard.

Countless silver lights pierced the numerous vital points on South Wolf’s body. South Wolf had only leather armor, so every one of Shi Feng’s attacks managed to cause over -500 damage, while critical hits dealt over -1,000 damage. On the other hand, the Mysterious-Iron ranked chest piece South Wolf wore was like a piece of tofu. Not only was it easily pierced by Shi Feng’s Abyssal Blade, each attack it received greatly diminished the armor’s durability. Just three strikes had nearly reduced it to scrap already.

Shi Feng’s attacks were lightning-fast, and he had brandished his sword eight times in a single series. By the time South Wolf had recovered from shock, his 2,000-plus HP was completely gone.

Suddenly, South Wolf’s field of vision turned gray, while his body fell to the ground involuntarily. Even as he died, shock and confusion still filled his face.

As South Wolf had not participated in any of the battles so far, his name remained white all this time. After he died, only one piece of equipment dropped by his body. He also lost only a single level. However, were Shi Feng’s attacks as simple as they looked? The reason why Shi Feng had chosen not to use any Skills, and had instead carried out only normal attacks, was to destroy the equipment on South Wolf’s body.

When South Wolf died, nearly half of the equipment on his body had already turned to scrap. Now that he had dropped yet another piece of equipment, he had definitely suffered heavy losses.
