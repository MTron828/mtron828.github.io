Chapter 2790 – Heaven-defying Battle

The Demon Gate inside the cavern opened. However, when the door was only partly open, a cold voice suddenly came from beyond it. Shi Feng’s group and the awakened Infant Golden Dragon shuddered involuntarily upon hearing this voice.

“A little golden lizard and a heaven-blessed individual... Wait, no, you’re not an existence of this world! Interesting! How interesting! Oh? The Bible of Darkness is actually damaged? Wonderful! This is truly wonderful!”

The demonic words that came out of the door echoed in everyone’s mind.

Although the voice spoke in a calm tone, the aura escaping the door paralyzed everyone momentarily. The Infant Golden Dragon glared at the door in fear.

A Tier 5 Demon King? Shi Feng was astonished when he sensed the frightening aura from the Demon Gate.

According to his expectations, he would already be fortunate if he could summon even a Demon Prince. After all, the Bible of Darkness had yet to reach its perfect state. However, the existence behind the Demon Gate was undoubtedly much stronger than a Demon Prince. In fact, none of the Tier 5 existences he had come across thus far had exuded such a powerful aura.

“This book isn’t suitable for a little guy like you. Give it to me! Only if it is in my hands can I truly descend onto this land!”

At the Demon King’s words, Shi Feng suddenly sensed his control over the Bible of Darkness waning, and the Bible actually started flying toward the Demon Gate.

Seeing this, Shi Feng couldn’t help being shocked. He never thought that a Demon could resist and manipulate the Bible of Darkness’s power. Hurriedly, he used all his strength to wrestle back control over the Bible of Darkness.

“Stop wasting your energy, little fellow. I will be taking this damaged Bible of Darkness. However, you can also rest assured. Once my clan and I thoroughly descend upon this world, I will make sure to spare you!” At these words, the Bible of Darkness struggled even harder to break free from Shi Feng’s grasp. In fact, his connection with the Bible of Darkness was even severed completely, and the only thing he could do now was hold on to the book with brute force.

“Despicable human, you actually dared summon that thing here!” the Infant Golden Dragon bellowed. Evidently, it had figured out the identity of the existence beyond the Demon Gate. “I will not let you succeed! Die!”

After letting out a roar, the Infant Dragon suddenly widened its mouth. Immediately afterward, a threefold magic array took shape before it. “Not good! It’s using Dragon Breath! Everyone, dodge quickly!” Shi Feng shouted, surprised by the Infant Dragon’s actions.

A Tier 4 Dragon Breath would undoubtedly carry power at the Tier 5 Intermediate-rank standard. Let alone Tier 3 players, even Tier 4 players would die if they faced it. The only way they could survive this attack was to dodge it!

However, the Infant Golden Dragon was simply too fast. Before anyone could react, the threefold magic array had already taken shape. The next moment, a destructive energy ball shot out of the Infant Dragon’s mouth, the energy ball’s speed and size making it impossible for anyone to avoid in time. Everyone could only watch as the Dragon Breath approached them.

“It’s over...” Lionheart reflexively closed his eyes when he saw the approaching Dragon Breath that destroyed everything in its path.

As for everyone else, they also revealed looks of despair and bitter smiles. Previously, they thought that they still stood a chance against the Infant Golden Dragon, albeit a small chance. However, after seeing the destructive power the Dragon Breath carried, they realized that any form of resistance would be meaningless. The only thing they could do was wait for death.

However, just when the Dragon Breath was about to reach Shi Feng and the others, that cold voice came from the half-opened Demon Gate again.

“A little lizard thinks it can stop my descent?”

An illusory hand suddenly appeared out of thin air before Shi Feng’s team and caught the approaching energy ball. The giant hand then squeezed the energy ball, shattering it into countless dispersing particles of light.

“How is this possible?!”

Everyone was thunderstruck by this scene. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Dragon Breath that carried such devastating power had actually been stopped so easily. They couldn’t even begin to imagine how powerful the Demon behind the Demon Gate was.

However, despite this sudden turn of events, Shi Feng’s complexion did not improve. On the contrary, it even turned gloomier instead.

Despite being only halfway summoned, the summoned Demon King could already exert enough strength to block a Tier 4 Dragon Breath casually. The Demon King’s strength was definitely at the Tier 5 Peak rank. This meant that the existence beyond the Demon Gate wasn’t just an ordinary Tier 5 Demon King. It was a Tier 5 Great Demon King! If Shi Feng allowed a Great Demon King to descend onto God’s Domain, even if it was the ancient God’s Domain, it would still spell disaster for the entire continent.

However, before Shi Feng and the others could recover from their surprise, the Infant Golden Dragon suddenly appeared above them. At this time, golden runes covered its body, and the aura it exuded was significantly stronger than before.

It can still become stronger? When Shi Feng looked at the Infant Golden Dragon in the air, he was genuinely shocked for the first time in a long while. After all, the Infant Golden Dragon was much stronger than he expected. Comparable to Tier 5 existences? What a joke. The aura and power the Infant Golden Dragon currently displayed had already more than doubled. It was definitely much stronger than ordinary Tier 5 existences. In fact, he doubted he could survive one attack from it even if he activated his Berserk Skill.

“Despicable Demon, you can’t use your full strength while behind that door. I refuse to believe you can keep blocking my attacks! So long as your summoner dies, you will have to remain in that endless abyss forever!”

The Infant Golden Dragon glared at the Demon Gate, a hint of disdain and mockery in its eyes. It then opened its mouth and launched another Dragon Breath.

This Dragon Breath was much more terrifying than before. As soon as the Infant Dragon inhaled, Shi Feng and the others sensed the Mana within the cavern disappear completely. In addition, the Tier 3 players even had their Mana rapidly sucked from their bodies. And although the Tier 4 players managed to prevent their Mana from getting plundered, their ability to manipulate Mana was greatly hindered. Now, they couldn’t even exhibit half of their usual combat power. “This is that Infant Dragon’s true strength?” Blood Blade fell into despair as he looked at the massive figure in the air.

Seeing it now, he couldn’t help but find their previous notion of challenging the Tier 4 Infant Dragon laughable.

The Infant Golden Dragon was much stronger than what its HP portrayed. It simply wasn’t an existence Tier 4 players could hope to challenge.

This moment drove home to Shi Feng why the quest he received was of the Inferior Mythic rank. He also understood why humans capable of slaying Dragons were highly praised in God’s Domain.

It would already be a miracle if a human could fight a Dragon of the same tier and level to a standstill, let alone kill one. This was especially true for Dragons that had reached Tier 4 or above. It wouldn’t even be an exaggeration to refer to such a feat as a myth.

Roar!

Accompanied by a deafening roar, a dazzling energy sphere carrying devastating power descended toward the team.

“Little lizard, you have truly angered me now!”

The Infant Golden Dragon’s efforts to prevent the Great Demon King beyond the Demon Gate from descending enraged him.

Suddenly, boundless Power of Darkness flooded out of the Demon Gate. A gigantic hand five times larger than the one before emerged from the ground. The hand was so massive that the Infant Dragon looked like a toy in comparison.

Boom!

Not only did the gigantic hand shatter the Dragon Breath instantly, but it even grabbed the Infant Dragon. And despite the Infant Dragon struggling desperately to break free, the giant hand remained unfazed as it smashed the Infant Dragon into the ground.

Boom!

A crater with a radius of 1,000 yards and a depth of 100 meters appeared on the cavern floor. Apart from the Tier 4 players and the Tier 3 healers, who had consumed Master Steel Potions, the other players in the cavern were instantly killed by the resulting shockwave.

Although Shi Feng and the Tier 4 players remained alive, they had lost over two-thirds of their HPs. As for the surviving healers, their HPs had also fallen to a critical level; they had very nearly lost their lives.

Meanwhile, after the dust in the vast cavern dissipated, the giant hand was nowhere in sight. The only thing in the crater was the Infant Golden Dragon. Presently, however, the Infant Dragon had both its wings broken, with blood flowing out from all over its body. Its life aura had also weakened significantly, and its HP had even fallen to just 63%. Given the Infant Dragon’s current state, it was evident that the Great Demon King’s attack had heavily injured it.

How strong! So, this is the strength of a Tier 5 Great Demon King? Shi Feng was dumbfounded by this outcome.

The Infant Golden Dragon had put its all into the last attack, and the attack’s power had definitely reached the Tier 5 Advanced-rank standard. Yet, it still suffered a brutal beating. The difference in strength between the Infant Dragon and Great Demon King was clear for all to see.

In fact, if not for the Demon Gate severely dampening the Great Demon King’s strength, the Infant Dragon would’ve most likely died from that one attack.

Meanwhile, after the Great Demon King executed this attack, his control over the Bible of Darkness had also weakened significantly. At the very least, Shi Feng could now sense a connection between him and the Bible of Darkness.

Shi Feng hurriedly canceled the summoning.

Previously, due to the severance of his connection with the Bible of Darkness, he couldn’t stop the summoning even if he wanted to. However, now that he had recovered a small portion of control over the Bible of Darkness, he could cancel the summoning. As for the cost of forcibly canceling the summoning, he couldn’t care less about it right now.

After all, if he allowed a Tier 5 Great Demon King to descend onto the continent, only death awaited him. Moreover, the cost of this death wouldn’t just be a loss of one or two levels. Instead, his body might very well end up a puppet of the Great Demon King, and he would have no choice but to re-train a new account. Hence, he absolutely couldn’t let the Great Demon King exit the Demon Gate, even if doing so would leave himself in a weakened state.

“You damned heaven-blessed individual! I will make you pay a heavy price the next time we

meet!”

Upon seeing the Demon Gate closing, the Great Demon King bellowed angrily and repeatedly attacked the door, causing it to tremble violently. Fortunately, the Demon Gate was sufficiently powerful. No matter how much the Great Demon King assailed it, the Demon Gate continued closing at a steady pace.

Finally, 20 seconds later, the Demon Gate closed and disappeared from this space, leaving behind only the heavily injured Infant Golden Dragon and Shi Feng’s team in the cavern.

“Brother Black Flame, what should we do now?” Lionheart asked in an uncertain voice after seeing the Demon Gate disappear.

He didn’t know whether they should flee or try to kill the Infant Golden Dragon while it was heavily injured. Although the Infant Dragon was significantly weaker than before, it was still much stronger than Superior Mythic monsters of the same level.

“Is there even a need to ask?” Looking at the Infant Dragon that was struggling to stand up, Shi Feng said in a determined tone, “Now is our only chance to slay this Infant Dragon. With our strength, we can’t defeat it in its peak state. Don’t tell me you’re willing to miss out on such an opportunity, Commander Lionheart?”

At Shi Feng’s words, Lifeless Thorn and Solitary Nine nodded in agreement. If the Infant Golden Dragon wasn’t heavily injured, killing it with their present strength was nigh impossible. Only Tier 5 players could possibly go up against it. “I guess you’re right.” As Lionheart looked at the Infant Golden Dragon, a trace of determination also appeared in his eyes. He then said, “Since that’s the case, let’s kill it before it recovers!”

After saying so, Lionheart raised his shield and led the charge against the Infant Golden Dragon, with all the other Tier 4s-except for Shi Feng-following close at his heels.
