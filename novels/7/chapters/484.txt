Chapter 485 - Number One Guild

Near one of the mass graves in Watch Cemetery’s outer region...

A tear in space suddenly appeared in mid-air. In the next moment, Shi Feng emerged.

“I finally escaped.”

Even after Shi Feng landed, he could still hear the King of Ghosts’ angry roars.

However, the tear in space had already closed. Even if Monroe Bell recovered his strength as a Tier 3 Sword King, he could not reach Shi Feng now.

Now that I have the Promotion Order, it should be about time to make a trip back to White River City. Shi Feng’s lips curled up slightly when he saw the glittering silver token in his bag.

Originally, he had only intended to retrieve this Guild Residence Promotion Order after he reached Level 30. However, he had not expected to set foot in the Flowing Water Realm. Even though he was only Level 26, he was already capable of delaying Monroe Bell.

Other than the Promotion Order, Shi Feng had obtained three items from the King’s Tomb. Of these three items, one was a fiery-red two-handed staff, one was an azure two-handed greatsword, and the last was a silver stone tablet.

Appraising these items with Omniscient Eyes, Shi Feng discovered that both the two-handed staff and two-handed sword were actually Level 30 Dark-Gold Weapons. However, the silver tablet surprised Shi Feng far more than the two weapons.

Shi Feng was very familiar with this silver tablet.

[Secret Sword Technique]

The pattern engraved on this tablet is too vague and incomplete, and no information can be deciphered. However, some kind of divine power hides within this pattern. If one gathers all of the stone tablets, this vague and incomplete pattern can be restored.

The tablet for the Secret Sword Technique... Shi Feng had accidentally obtained a part of it while he had completed the Blade Saint’s Legacy Trial. Back then, he had suspected that the silver tablet was something extraordinary, so he had stored it in his Warehouse.

He never expected to obtain another piece so soon.

“Just what is this Secret Sword Technique?” Despite examining the tablet, Shi Feng could not find any differences between the tablet he had just obtained and the one he had found in the Origin Sword Domain. The two pieces looked identical. Shi Feng even suspected that the piece he stored inside his Warehouse had somehow grown legs and run to the King’s Tomb by itself. “Forget it. Let’s head back for now.”

Following which, Shi Feng retrieved a Return Scroll. However, just as he was about to start channeling...

Di... Di... Di...

Suddenly, Shi Feng’s communicator rang. Thoughtful Rain, a girl he had only met once before, was contacting him.

“Is she looking to buy equipment?” Shi Feng looked at Thoughtful Rain’s name, feeling slightly surprised.

Previously, when he had met Thoughtful Rain at White River City’s Library, the latter had expressed her interest in purchasing weapons and equipment from him.

Shi Feng felt a sense of familiarity from Thoughtful Rain. Now that his brain activity had increased, he could recall even the smallest fragment of the past. Yet, even after his memories had refreshed, he still could not recall the girl. He only felt that she was familiar, but he did not know why.

“Miss Rain, since you have contacted me, are you interested in purchasing some equipment?” Shi Feng asked pleasantly, smiling.

“I’d like to, but today, I’m contacting you because I have found a big business opportunity for you,” Thoughtful Rain said, smiling sweetly. “A group of people just happen to overhear me when I spoke about our acquaintance. In the end, these people asked me to contact you for them. They hope to meet with you now. Do you have the time?”

“Who are these people?” Shi Feng asked.

“He says his name is Everlasting War. He’s a Level 27 Guardian Knight, and his companions are all Level 26. From the looks of it, they seem quite powerful, and they have excellent equipment. I’m assuming that someone with significant financial power backs them,” Thoughtful Rain said.

“Alright, then let’s meet at Zero Wing’s Guild Residence,” Shi Feng nodded before disconnecting the call. He then activated the Return Scroll.

Shi Feng had heard of Everlasting War before. That person had been a famous character in God’s Domain, having the title of Everlasting War God. He was also an apex expert, and his fame was not the slightest bit inferior to Summer Sunshine’s. In a direct confrontation, even Summer Sunshine would not be a match for Everlasting War.

Twenty seconds later, Shi Feng transformed into a streak of white light as he teleported back to White River City.

The sky gradually darkened. A large number of players had returned to the city, and people crowded the streets. Passing through the lively streets, Shi Feng soon arrived at the Bank. He then stored all of the top-tier and advanced equipment he had obtained in the Guild’s Warehouse.

He also placed the Level 30 Dark-Gold staff, the Roaring Blaze Staff, and the Level 30 Dark-Gold greatsword, the Azure Heart, on full display in the Guild’s Warehouse.

For a time, the members of Zero Wing went into an uproar.

The war between Zero Wing and Overwhelming Smile had significantly depleted the stock of equipment inside the Guild’s Warehouse. Now, however, over 1,000 pieces of equipment had suddenly appeared. Aside from the large amount of advanced equipment, the stock of top-tier equipment had already exceeded 100 pieces.

Beyond that, there were actually Level 30 Dark-Gold Weapons inside the Guild’s Warehouse!

Currently, the players of various large Guilds still struggled to obtain Level 25 equipment. Bronze Equipment was a challenge to obtain, much less Mysterious-Iron. On the other hand, their Guild had Level 30 weapons; they were Dark-Gold Weapons to boot! They were definitely the best weapons in all of God’s Domain right now.

However, shortly after everyone in the Guild started spreading the news, Shi Feng had arrived at the Adventurer’s Association. He handed over the Guild Residence Promotion Order, officially promoting Zero Wing’s Residence to a 2-star Residence.

Star-Moon Kingdom System Announcement: Congratulations to Zero Wing for becoming the first Guild in Star-Moon Kingdom to own a 2-star Guild Residence! Rewarding 30,000 Guild Popularity, 500 Gold Coins to the Guild, and one Guild Smithy Promotion Order.

White River City System Announcement: Congratulations to Zero Wing for becoming the first Guild in White River City to own a 2-star Guild Residence! Rewarding 10,000 Guild Popularity and 200 Gold Coins.

The system announcement repeated three times, and every player in White River City heard it loud and clear.

“Damn! What is this crap? Our Guild hasn’t even obtained a Guild Residence, yet, already, Zero Wing has a 2-star Guild Residence?”

“What’s this 2-star Residence thingy?”

“Lots and lots of money!”

Suddenly, Star-Moon Kingdom’s official forums exploded with activity. Everyone discussed Zero Wing, and the various large Guilds had also begun asking around about the benefits of a 2-star Guild Residence. Also, what was a Guild Smithy Promotion Order?

However, the activity on Star-Moon Kingdom’s forums paled in comparison to White River City’s.

“Zero Wing is simply too amazing! Overwhelming Smile has only managed to establish its Guild Residence after much difficulty, yet, Zero Wing has already obtained a 2-star Guild Residence!”

“I’ve just received news that Zero Wing’s Warehouse has received an influx of top-tier equipment! There are even Level 30 Dark-Gold Weapons in there! Now, Zero Wing’s Guild Residence has been promoted to 2-stars! Zero Wing is simply overpowered!”

“It seems that Zero Wing is still the true overlord of White River City. Although Overwhelming Smile is rich, it still cannot compete with Zero Wing. Now, even Overwhelming Smile’s financial power in the game is no match for Zero Wing. We will have a better future if we join Zero Wing.”

“That’s not all. I’ve just made some inquiries and found out that Guilds can establish a Guild Smithy inside a 2-star Guild Residence. The repair fees there are 10% cheaper than elsewhere. Meanwhile, that Guild Smithy Promotion Order can be used to promote a 1-star Guild Smithy into a 2-star Guild Smithy. The repair fees of a 2-star are even lower, 15% cheaper. You can save so much on repair fees alone. Other Guilds have no chance against Zero Wing.”

“All hail Zero Wing! I want to join Zero Wing!”

For a time, Zero Wing became the number one Guild in the hearts of White River City’s players of White River City. Suddenly, White River City went into a frenzy as players tried to join Zero Wing.
