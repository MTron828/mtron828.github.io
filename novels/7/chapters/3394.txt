Chapter 469 – War Goddess’s Initial Appearance

Not good!

Unrestrained Lionheart panicked when he saw Mad Blade lunging in for an attack.

Mad Blade, also known as the Made Gale Saint, might be a Berserker, but he was in possession of the tigerkin race’s strongest bloodline, the Golden Bloodline. As a result, when engaged in melee combat, he possessed explosive speed and power that allowed him to surpass even Assassins of the same tier.

Currently, there were less than 100 yards separating Mad Blade from Shi Feng. This was a distance that even a normal Tier 5 Berserker could cover in an instant, let alone Mad Blade.

At this distance, there was nothing Unrestrained Lionheart or anyone else on the team could do to help Shi Feng…

So fast!

Standing behind Shi Feng, Death Omen and Thousand Scars went wide-eyed, shocked by the speed Mad Blade displayed.

Fast!

Mad Blade was too fast!

Even as Tier 5 Assassins, they barely managed to react to Mad Blade’s advance.

In the time it took them to blink their eyes, Mad Blade had already appeared in front of Shi Feng. The Berserker was so fast that it was as if he had used a high-tiered Teleportation Spell.

When Tier 5 Grand Wizards used a Tier 5 Teleportation Spell, while they crossed distances of over a thousand yards instantly and without any delays, they needed to reorient themselves and adjust their bodies accordingly. Meanwhile, this process required time. Although it would take little time, they must complete this process before taking further action.

However, Mad Blade didn’t need to do so. Because he had physically crossed the distance between himself and Shi Feng in an instant, it was as if he had always stood in front of Shi Feng.

Meanwhile, as soon as Mad Blade reached Shi Feng, the massive greatsword he wielded transformed into a wall of wind that smashed into Shi Feng. As the wall of wind covered a large area, facing it was akin to going up against the attacks of four Tier 5 Combat Puppets simultaneously.

As expected of a Saint who has created a complete set of Exclusive Absolute Techniques.

Shi Feng dared not take any chances when going up against the wind wall coming at him. Immediately, he activated Abyssal Power, increasing his Defense by 100%, Strength by 150%, Agility by 60%, Physique by 50%, and Endurance by 100% for three minutes. Then, he swung the Winter of Eternal Night, having it meet Mad Blade’s attack.

Radiant Night!

Second Sword, Holy Devour!

Suddenly, surging flames crashed into the wall of wind.

Boom!

The collision between the flames and wind created countless spatial rifts in the surrounding area and powerful shockwaves that sent nearby Tier 5 experts flying several dozen yards backward.

Subsequently, Shi Feng’s figure could be seen flying out of the fiery storm and landing in front of the teleportation gate. He then stumbled three steps backward before catching his feet.

Even after activating Abyssal Power, Shi Feng still lost 66% of his HP from blocking Mad Blade’s attack. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the Mad Gale Saint was already close to matching the sealed Holy Ancestor in terms of raw power.

“It seems you’re not all talk after all,” Mad Blade commented with a sneer when he saw Shi Feng still standing. “But this is the end of the line for you.”

After saying so, Mad Blade stepped out of the dissipating storm and charged at Shi Feng once more. Apart from Frey and a few other experts that rivaled Tier 6 players, nobody else present managed to follow his speed.

“Mad Blade! Do you think I’ll continue letting you run free?!” Frey shouted as she swung the Nethersoul staff.

Mad Blade had acted very suddenly just now, so Frey had failed to react to his attack in time. However, now that she was ready, she naturally wouldn’t let the Berserker act as he wished anymore.

Immediately, sixteen semi-translucent Soul Annihilation Spears flew at Mad Blade. As these spears were immune to the resistance of space, they flew faster than even a Tier 6 Ranger’s arrows. Like lightning bolts, they instantly reached Mad Blade and threatened to bombard him from all directions.

“You think you can stop me?” Mad Blade looked at the approaching Soul Annihilation Spears in contempt. Then, he promptly changed his footwork.

Exclusive Absolute Technique, Phantasm Steps!

Subsequently, all sixteen Soul Annihilation Spears harmlessly passed through Mad Blade’s body as if it was nothing but an illusion.

“Black Flame! Run!” Unrestrained Lionheart instinctively shouted when he saw Frey’s attack failing to connect.

The Phantasm Steps technique was Mad Blade’s trademark move. It was a footwork very close to reaching the Gold Combat Technique standard. Once Mad Blade executed this footwork, even Frey, someone who wielded a Fragmented Divine Weapon, could do nothing to him, and she would have no choice but to teleport away and avoid staying anywhere near Mad Blade temporarily. Either that or she’d have to waste a Lifesaving Skill to counter the technique.

“Dammit!” Frustration filled Frey when she saw Mad Blade disappearing. If only she had enough Seven Luminaries Crystals on hand. In that case, she’d have access to two Extraordinary-ranked Secret Treasures to bolster her strength, and she’d have no trouble fighting against Mad Blade.

Meanwhile, a brief moment after Mad Blade had disappeared from everyone’s sight, he reappeared in front of Shi Feng.

“Let’s see how you stay arrogant now, you little punk!”

After saying so, Mad Blade executed Wind Barrier, his offensive-type Exclusive Absolute Technique, for a second time.

However, the instant Mad Blade swung his greatsword, he could faintly hear Shi Feng muttering something to himself. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Sure enough, trying to fight Tier 5 old monsters with the strength of a Tier 4 Sword Emperor is still asking for too much.”

As soon as Shi Feng finished speaking, a purple lightning bolt suddenly descended from the skies, threatening to strike Mad Blade if the Berserker persisted in his frontal assault. However, relying on instincts, Mad Blade swiftly twisted his body, spinning away from the lightning bolt and smoothly transitioning into attacking Shi Feng from the side.

Clang!

A loud metallic clang echoed across the battlefield. Then, following it was silence.

“Who?!” Mad Blade bellowed as he turned to look at the person who stopped his attack. Although he didn’t back his side attack with any combat techniques, the attack still carried power at the Tier 6 standard because of his Legendary Greatsword. It wasn’t an attack ordinary Tier 5 experts could casually block.

“A War Goddess?”

Surprise flashed in Mad Blade’s eyes as he looked at the spear-wielding woman before him.

At the same time as Mad Blade got a good look at the person who had blocked his attack, everyone else present also saw the woman dressed like a holy knight standing in front of Shi Feng, protecting him. Immediately, shock and confusion spread.

Is this his trump card? A look of surprise flashed in Frey’s eyes as she looked at the War Goddess, who had suddenly appeared in front of Shi Feng.

There were some incredibly powerful NPCs in God’s Domain, and among them were War Goddesses. According to rumors, War Goddesses had developed their techniques to the extreme and mastered complete sets of Gold Combat Techniques. It was also rumored that War Goddesses could fight against Dragons of the same tier.

However, under normal circumstances, players couldn’t even come into contact with such NPCs, let alone summon one to fight for them. Such a feat was as difficult as summoning a Dragon to fight for them.

“So what if you have a War Goddess?” After his initial surprise, Mad Blade turned to look at Shi Feng in contempt. “At the end of the day, she is only a Level 150, Tier 4 War Goddess. Do you think she alone can block all of my attacks?”

War Goddesses might be frightening foes to fight against, but that was only if one went up against War Goddesses of the same tier or higher. A Tier 4 War Goddess might be of some threat to Mad Blade, but that wasn’t enough to stop him from killing Shi Feng.

In response to Mad Blade’s provocation, Shi Feng faintly smiled and asked, “If one’s not enough…what about six?”
