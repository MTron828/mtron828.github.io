Chapter 272 – The True Way of Using Holy Devour

I’m no match for him in a frontal clash?

One Step couldn’t help but be shocked and confused as he looked at his trembling hands.

The Titans were a race known for having incomparable Strength. Even Dragons were inferior to Titans when it came to Strength. Logically, the combination of his Titan Bloodline, Dragon Blade, and Tier 4 Legacy Skill Titan’s Wrath should allow him to damage even a Tier 5 monster in a frontal clash.

Yet, the Strength One Step prided himself in had actually lost to Shi Feng.

At this moment, One Step wasn’t the only one confused by this outcome. Everyone else present was in a similar situation.

The combat power One Step, Florence, Convict, and Melissa had displayed was sufficient to destroy even an entire city. Their combat power definitely ranked at the apex of the current Miniature Ancient World.

Yet, the four were no match for Shi Feng even after joining forces. They had even lost over one-third of their HP.

The Strength Shi Feng displayed was no longer just terrifying. It was simply incomprehensible.

The only person unsurprised by this situation was Shi Feng himself.

It was true that One Step and the others possessed combat power at the apex of Tier 4. However, it should be known that Shi Feng was equipped with the Blazing Flame Set, which granted Basic Attributes equivalent to a Level 135 Dark-Gold Equipment Set. In comparison, while One Step and the others might be equipped with Epic Equipment Sets, their sets only granted a Level 122 Epic Equipment Set’s Basic Attributes. A gap of 13 levels wasn’t something that could be overcome by just a difference of one rank.

Not to mention, when Shi Feng completed his promotion and became a Tier 4 Sword Law Saint, the Basic Attributes he received as a reward was significantly greater than other classes.

......

So, even if One Step and the others worked together, there was no way they could gain an advantage over Shi Feng’s Holy Devour.

“A Mana Technique! It’s a Saint-ranked Mana Technique!” Melissa said as she wiped the blood that had flowed down the corner of her mouth, a trace of fear appearing in her eyes when she looked at Shi Feng. “Moreover, it’s a perfectly mastered Saint-ranked Mana Technique. This is really bad.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Saint-ranked Mana Techniques were extremely rare even in the Greater God’s Domain, their rarity not the slightest bit lower than Gold Combat Techniques. Meanwhile, every expert she knew who had managed to perfectly master a Saint-ranked Mana Technique held the position of Honorary Elder in the Seven Luminaries Alliance.

Unlike Gold Combat Techniques, while Saint-ranked Mana Techniques did not grant players an instant boost in combat power, it had the advantage of being able to grow stronger as players reached higher tiers. By the time players reached Tier 6, they could defeat even Tier 6 Gods with a perfectly mastered Saint-ranked Mana Technique.

Although Shi Feng was only at Tier 4 right now, he was still a tricky opponent nonetheless.

“So what if it’s a Saint-ranked Mana Technique?!” Florence glared at Shi Feng. Then, he spoke to the other three through a private channel, “We might not be a match for him in a frontal clash, but we can whittle him down. Using a Saint-ranked Mana Technique is incredibly taxing. How many times do you think he can use it?”

Shi Feng indeed deserved to be called a monster if he could perfectly master a Saint-ranked Mana Technique. However, Shi Feng was currently only a Tier 4 player. In a situation where Stamina and Concentration were limited, Shi Feng could only use his Saint-ranked Mana Technique a few times. If he couldn’t kill all four of them in one move, they could easily whittle him down and kill him.

“It seems that’s our only option. I’ll block his attacks while you guys find opportunities to strike,” Melissa said before starting to chant an incantation. Immediately, gigantic serpents measuring over a thousand meters in length emerged from the surrounding sea, their appearance instantly dwarfing Florence’s golden lion.

The other three nodded. Then, they each took out a Master Regeneration Potion from their bags, drank it, and went into action.

Dark Banner Melissa was known to be invincible at sea because of her nigh-impeccable defensive capabilities. Moreover, so long as she was at a place with dense water-type mana, she could recover her HP, Mana, Stamina, and Concentration rapidly. So long as she didn’t get killed instantly, she could quickly make a full recovery and whittle down any player of the same tier.

“Do you really think you can outlast me?” Shi Feng remained calm even after seeing that his opponents did not intend to duke it out with him.

He could tell what was going through the minds of these four players.

There was a basic guideline for players on what to do should they come across an expert who had perfectly mastered a Saint-ranked Mana Technique as an opponent—flee or drag out the battle.

Shi Feng had come across many opponents who had tried the latter option against him during his previous life. Their strategy was always the same: to kite him with ranged attacks. They would never try to fight him at close range.

After saying so, Shi Feng held the Winter of Eternal Night horizontally before him. Subsequently, nine frost swords appeared next to One Step and the others and promptly lashed out at them.

Sword’s Orbit!

Each frost sword carried 120% of Shi Feng’s Strength. Shi Feng originally had greater Strength than One Step and the others already. So, the four had to go all out just to block even one frost sword. When faced with the attacks of two frost swords simultaneously, One Step and the others didn’t even have the time to breathe.

Even Melissa, who possessed nigh-impeccable defensive capabilities, could only focus all her attention on blocking the three frost swords attacking her. She did not have any spare energy to focus on Shi Feng.

For a time, apart from Melissa, One Step and the others started to get pushed back one time after another, their HP rapidly decreasing.

“Dammit! How is his Strength so high?!” Florence cursed. Whenever he clashed with Shi Feng’s frost swords, the phantom of the golden lion he summoned would darken slightly. Not only did the golden lion’s massive body not bring him any advantages, but it was even holding him back now as it gave Shi Feng a bigger target to strike.

While Florence was in the midst of blocking a frost sword, Shi Feng suddenly appeared within 50 yards of him and swung his longsword.

Holy Devour!

Crimson flames covered the sky once more. Even though Florence had responded to Shi Feng’s attack immediately by doubling his Defense and HP with a Lifesaving Skill, he still lost one-fifth of his HP to the attack.

Thank goodness I blocked it. Florence sighed in relief when he saw that he was still alive.

However, before Florence could distance himself from Shi Feng, another tide of flames assaulted him. Upon seeing this, he instinctively raised the golden lion’s paws to defend himself.

Boom!

Florence was sent flying over a dozen yards backward this time. However, before he could even stabilize his posture, a third flame pillar came at him again.

Fuck! What is going on here?!

Florence was stupefied when he saw the third fiery tidal wave approaching him.

Unfortunately, even though Florence had executed a defensive combat technique to block this third attack, he failed to execute the technique perfectly due to his unstable posture. As a result, when the tide of flames devoured him, he instantly lost all of his remaining HP.

Three times.

Shi Feng had used Holy Devour three times consecutively. He did not rest for even a moment in between these three executions. It was as if the Mana Technique did not cost him anything to execute, and he used it as casually as if he were using an ordinary combat technique…
