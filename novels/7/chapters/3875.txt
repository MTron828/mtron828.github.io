“Chisha, what’s wrong?” the middle-aged Cleric asked, surprised by Xuanwu Chisha’s behavior.

As long-time companions in the Greater God’s Domain, the middle-aged Cleric understood Xuanwu Chisha’s character well. She was a calm and ruthless killing machine, and very rarely could anything shake her composure.

The other team members also looked at Xuanwu Chisha curiously, wondering what had excited the taciturn Iron Valkyrie.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“It’s nothing. I just saw a fellow compatriot on the Divine Glory List,” Xuanwu Chisha said, her eyes wide with shock and disbelief as she looked at the name occupying the Divine Glory List’s sixth place.

“Someone else from your homeworld entered the Divine Glory List?” The middle-aged Cleric grew envious when he heard Xuanwu Chisha’s answer. “Your world is really amazing. That should be the second person from your homeworld to have entered the Divine Glory List, right? You yourself have even entered the top 100. In contrast, I am the only one struggling to support my world. I hope I can get some help soon.”

Following the middle-aged Cleric’s words, the other team members also expressed their envy.

It was incredibly difficult for players new to the Greater God’s Domain to establish themselves. This remained true even after they had grown strong enough to enter the Divine Glory List.

Their team was a small team established by a group of mediocre powers. Besides obtaining resources for their respective God’s Domains, their goal in forming this team was to better explore the Greater God’s Domain, develop their strength, and resist the teams of other powers.

For players originating from the same God’s Domain, they would undoubtedly have an easier time developing if they could have more companions of equal strength. At the very least, they wouldn’t have to worry about getting persecuted by the various powers just to obtain some resources.

“Big Sis Chisha, what is that person’s rank?” a petite girl, a Level 230 Berserker, asked curiously. “Did they get into the top 300? I heard that anyone who manages to enter the top 300 of the latest Divine Glory List can be considered a chosen one among chosen ones. The Seven Luminaries Alliance is even willing to transport them into the Eternal Realm for free.”

The others in the team also cast curious gazes at Xuanwu Chisha.

There was no room for doubt regarding Xuanwu Chisha’s strength and talent. She was second only to their team’s leader, Green Doctor. Oftentimes, she was also the one to bail their team out of troublesome situations. This made them wonder what kind of genius Xuanwu Chisha’s fellow compatriot was.

Could this person be in the new Divine Glory List’s top 500?

Or possibly the top 300?

“He’s sixth on the Divine Glory List,” Xuanwu Chisha answered truthfully despite her skepticism about Shi Feng’s ranking.

She couldn’t be faulted for her skepticism. After all, Shi Feng was only a genius on the Luminary Glory List when they first met. She was leagues ahead of him at the time. Although his subsequent achievements had enabled him to enter the Divine Glory List’s top 300, he was still far from becoming a true powerhouse.

But now, Shi Feng’s ranking on the Divine Glory List had skyrocketed to sixth place. He had even surpassed Solitary Warlord, the publicly acknowledged number one player in the Greater God’s Domain. No matter how Xuanwu Chisha looked at it, this situation felt like a dream.

“Sixth? You mean Black Flame?!” Green Doctor looked at Xuanwu Chisha in astonishment, feeling she was joking with him.

Sixth place on the Divine Glory List. This was an existence second to only Mortal Gods. This was also an existence far out of their reach.

“Yes, it’s him,” Xuanwu Chisha said definitively.

“We’re saved! We’re saved!” Green Doctor cheered excitedly at Xuanwu Chisha’s confirmation. “Chisha! Can you introduce us to him once we enter the Eternal Realm?”

“We’re saved?” Xuanwu Chisha looked at Green Doctor strangely, unable to understand what he was talking about.

They were currently being hunted by Demon’s Gate, an existence that even apex powers did not wish to provoke.

“It’s no surprise that you don’t know.” When Green Doctor saw Xuanwu Chisha’s confusion, he quickly put two and two together and explained, “A friend of mine in the Eternal Realm told me this: Black Flame has accomplished great things in the Eternal Realm. He offended not just Demon’s Gate but also several royal powers. However, neither Demon’s Gate nor the royal powers could do anything against him. Demon’s Gate even withdrew its bounty on him. By now, he can be considered a big shot in the Eternal Realm. If we can get his protection, Demon’s Gate’s bounty will no longer be a problem.

“Of course, we won’t be taking advantage of him! We’ll pay him appropriately for his help!”

When the others heard Green Doctor’s explanation, they all turned to Xuanwu Chisha in astonishment. They never thought her fellow compatriot could render even Demon’s Gate helpless.

“Okay, I’ll give it a try. But I don’t know if he will agree to help,” Xuanwu Chisha said in a daze. She couldn’t help but feel like she was dreaming as she looked at Shi Feng’s rank on the Divine Glory List. She also couldn’t imagine how Shi Feng could ward off the lunatics from Demon’s Gate. After all, the current Eternal Realm was no longer the same as before. The various powers already had access to a considerable portion of their means and foundations, drastically reducing the effectiveness of individual strength.

Eternal Realm, Shadowring Town:

After Shi Feng handed the Dragon-Hunting Artillery Construction Design to Melting Flame and Silk Radish for further research and tasked Hidden Soul with gathering the required Lightning Nuclei, he made his way to one of the Guild Residence’s secret rooms to study the Fourth Goddess Tablet.

The damage to the tablet is much worse than I thought. Shi Feng frowned as he inspected the stone tablet covered in cracks. No wonder the Galaxy Conglomerate treated it as scrap. Less than 10% of the tablet is identifiable. Without the correct mana interpretation technique, uncovering even basic information from it would be impossible.

Although Shi Feng had already known that the Fourth Goddess Tablet was severely damaged when he bought it from the Galaxy Conglomerate’s shop at Desolate Star City’s trade fair, he hadn’t expected it to be this damaged. He also finally understood why a behemoth like the Galaxy Conglomerate had failed to identify the Fourth Goddess Tablet.

The engravings on the tablet recorded crucial information. With less than 10% of the engravings intact, one couldn’t obtain much information from the tablet, even with the correct mana interpretation method. Gathering any information without the right mana interpretation method would be next to impossible.

After calming his emotions, Shi Feng retrieved an Eternal God Crystal from his bag and carefully interpreted the information on the tablet.
